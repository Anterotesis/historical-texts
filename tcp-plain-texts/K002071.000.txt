one of our conferences I think I told you  See page    Indeed the whole of Discourse  III  should be read and well understood before this sketch of Sacred History is studied as indeed should Discourses  VII VIII IX  and  X  before the view of English History  that all mankind from Adam until now have received the benefits of the death and passion of our Redeemer Of course our religion has been the same from the beginning of the world Men have ever acknowledged the same God as the Creator and the same Christ as the Saviour of the world But this acknowledgment was not sufficient to save mankind before the coming of our Saviour Men found it necessary to practise  natural  religion before the introduction of  revealed  that is to say to submit to the principles of right and equity which God had engraved upon their hearts before he thought proper to give them any directions on that head They did as they would be done by and acted in conformity to conscience and to reason Such was the religion of Adam and his posterity To render it however more venerable and testify their dependance on the sovereign majesty of God they made use of ceremonies and an outward form of worship they  erected altars and sacrificed on those altars certain animals and fruits of the earth as emblematical of the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ in aftertimes  Then  the distinction of priest and people was unknown Till the time the Moses all men were priests and very one offered to the Lord the humble homage of his dependance and his gratitude  EUGEN  The history of the first families on earth must be very interesting I should like to know something of them  ERAST  I will endeavour to gratify you in this particular shall not however enter minutely into every little incident attendant on this history I shall give you only the great outlines of the progress of that religion which it pleased the Creator to establish among men To assist your memory in this it will be necessary to divide the time into six periods that you may not confound one age with another  The  first  period then shall contain a view of the principal events that occurred from the creation of the world to the deluge or it's destruction by water  The  second  shall give you an idea of the history of mankind from the deluge to the calling of Abraham who was the father of the Jewish nation  The  third  will shew you the progress of the Jews to their entrance into the land of Canaan the land which God allotted for their inheritance  The  fourth  will lay before you the various revolutions that took place in this rising nation to the time of their most flourishing state when Solomon built his temple  The  fifth  shall begin with the captivity of Babylon whose people merited slavery by their crimes and  The  sixth  will represent to you the state of the same people from the time they recovered their freedom under the reign of Cyrus king of Persia till the birth of Christ  THE FIRST EPOCH  The first then of the six epochs or periods is that which begins with the world and ends with the deluge  and comprehends the occurrences of years that is to say from Adam to Noah  Not long after the fall of our first parents they had two sons CAIN and ABEL The dispositions of these two brothers were of a contrary cast Cain was of an avaricious proud impious turn of mind whereas Abel was all meekness humility and generosity now as the sacrifices or homage offered to God by the one was more acceptable to him than those of the other it occasioned such a jealousy and hatred in Cain that he sought an opportunity to murder his brother  The death of Abel armed the vengeance of the Lord against his murderer and God to punish him gave him over to the bitterest remorse A man's conscience when keen is a sufficient punishment for almost any crime To this conscience Cain was committed and we are told that his sin so afflicted him that it was  more than he was able to bear  He was driven out from society and thus agitated by his fears sat about building the first city as an asylum from the hatred and persecution of mankind  Adam was consoled for the loss of Abel and the depravity of Cain by the birth of Seth who was the second patriarch or head of a family before the deluge  The family of this man was virtuous and religious whilst that of Cain was the contrary and it was not till the time of Enos the third patriarch and son of Seth that the true worship of God took place in the family of Cain This was about years after the creation  The great greatgrandson of Enos was Enoch the father of Methuselah he who was the longest liver and died at the age of This Enoch was taken up into heaven in a miraculous manner soon after the death of Adam who dying at the age of plunged mankind into a general nourning  The death of Adam the taking up of Enoch and the old age of the other patriarchs who till now seemed to have kept men within certain bounds gave a loose to universal corruption Nothing could check it  The virtuous fell in with the depravity of the vicious in a word impiety grew to such an excess that God in equity of judgment determined to extirpate this criminal race of men from the earth  Among the whole there was only one good man This was the patriarch Noah the grandson of Methusaleh and of the tenth generation from Adam by his son Seth him God was pleased to favour and reveal to his design of destroying the world by an universal deluge and that years before it happened In order to save this man and his family he directed him to build a large vessel which we call an  Ark  During this interval Noah denounced to sinners the terrible event that threatened them but they shut their ears to his salutary admonitions and laughed at the dreadful account he held forth to them till the horrible event took place Noah alone his wife his three sons and their wives with a male and female of every animal then living were reserved to repeople and restock the earth This happened in the year of the world when Noah was about years old  EUGEN  I have heard the long lives of people living before the flood disputed and that that which we call a year was a period of much shorter duration  ERAST  Such things  have  been advanced but merely on conjecture In the early ages of the world when families on the earth were few it was perhaps necessary or at least not attended with any inconvenience that men should live and beget children for eight or nine hundred years in order to people the globe but was mankind to live now as long it is evident from the populousness of every country that the earth would be overstocked and not large enough to provide for mankind On this account Providence has wisely shortened our days and ordered that there shall be no more inhabitants than the earth is capable of maintaining Besides God might then have thought proper to extend the lives of men to a very great age in order to hand down to posterity the wonders of his power and his  goodness which as printing was then unknown could not be otherwise done than by tradition  The ten patriarchs that lived before the flood namely Adam Seth Enos Cainan Mahalaleel Jared Enoch Methuselah Lamech and Noah each of which was the son of the person preceding him were the depositaries of the holy law before it was published on Mount Sinai and of these ten Adam lived years after Lamech was born and Lamech lived till Noah was years old that is till within six years of the deluge and as Noah lived years afterwards it is plain that the history of above years was within the memory of three persons the accounts given therefore by these three men corroborating the assertions of the other seven patriarchs leave no room to doubt the veracity of their traditions  So again of the ten patriarchs after the flood Shem the first patriarch the son of Noah lived years after the birth of Abraham the tenth patriarch whose son Isaac was a cotemporay to Levi the father or grandfather of Moses Hence it follows that Moses wrote nothing but that was in the memory of man since he was not more than four or five generations removed from Abraham and Abraham being alive with many who had seen Noah and the deluge and Noah with many that had seen Adam and the first ages of the world it follows that Adam could not be unknown to Noah and his son Shem nor these to Abraham or Jacob nor Jacob to Moses particularly at a time when this tradition concerned their own family and was the only history fathers could teach their children  EUGEN  I have followed you Sir with attention and see clearly that the history of the first ages of the world have passed through too few hands to be altered in the days of Moses not more than seven or eight persons from Adams to Moses a period of near years But Sir there is a new difficulty which strikes me and which I wish to have cleared up and that is how so great a multitude of animals as two of each species which covered the earth could be contained in the ark  so long as a year which I understand the deluge continued  ERAST  In the first place it must be considered that according to the dimensions of the ark given us in scripture it was four times as large as a firstrate man of war which is capable of containing seven or eight hundred men with as many troops with necessary provisions for six months and at the same time loaded with rigging one hundred pieces of heavy cannon and their proper ammunition whereas in the ark were only eight persons besides the animals and their provisions for a year  In the next place it must be understood that the original species of animals were not so numerous as have been thought All the species of dogs for example may have arisen from one species as all the species of pears may have sprung from the first peartree or the different species of men from the same original  EUGEN  But Sir is it natural to conclude that men of different complexions white swarthy coppercoloured and black sprung from the same stock  ERAST  Yes Our exterior varieties are subject to change We no way resemble the ancient Britons of this country This race of people has ceased by mixing with others The Arabians who lived a long time in Spain and who were originally of a black cast have now retired to Morocco and Tunis The natives of the western part of Africa are  blacker  than they formerly were those about Tunis  whiter  Where there is no mixture of people the same colour has continued but one alteration is sufficient to destroy our conclusions that men of different complexions  must  spring from different stocks  No animal produced by two animals of a different kind ever breeds that is mongrels never perpetuate their species but a bitch produced by a greyhound and a terrier will have young of course a greyhound and a terrier are in fact of the same species we may say the same of a child born of a negrowoman and a white man But let us continue the history of religion  THE SECOND EPOCH  Soon after the deluge change of living and  animal  food being substituted in the room of  vegetable  with other causes brought on a decrease in length of life Some precepts were given to Noah the confusion of tongues happened at the tower of Babel in the year of the world which was the first monument of the pride and wickedness of men and the allotment of district to the three children of Noah was the first distribution of land  An account of these first three founders of nations is still preserved From Japhet the eldest son of Noah sprung the inhabitants of the north of Europe and Asia as well as those of the west from Shem came the people of the east as also the Jews and from Ham and his son Canaan descended the Canaanites Philistines Egyptians and the ancient possessors of Africa  A little after this first division of territory that is about of the world Nimrod a man of savage disposition became the first of conquerors and established his kingdom at Babylon He was the father of Ninus who founded the Assyrian monarchy  Every thing had a beginning there is no history so ancient that has not vestiges of the infancy of the world We have seen laws established manners become polished and empires formed men have risen by degrees from a state of ignorance experience has improved them and arts have multiplied and grown to perfection under their hands In proportion as mankind encreased mountains were passed rivers and seas were traversed and new habitations were established  The earth which in the beginning was merely an immense forest took on a new form Woods grubbed up gave place to fields to meadows to villages and towns men employed themselves in taking animals taming them and making them useful Meeting with opposition they first began their contest with wild beasts They next invented arms then turned those arms against each other and took pride in war Nimrod the first warrior and the first conqueror is called in scripture  A  great hunter  Afterwards men found out the art of cultivation converted metals to their use and turned every article in nature to some advantage  But though men enriched society by the invention and improvement of arts they on the other hand dishonoured it by the greatest excesses till in the end they drew upon them the vengeance of the Lord In vain did the world still dripping as it were with the waters of the deluge in vain did the striking decrease in the duration of human life in vain did the overthrow of nature still present dreadful monuments of the justice of an irritated Creator The knowledge of a Supreme Being was effaced from the memory of man ancient traditions were obscured and forgotten and fables took their place Instead of paying that tribute of adoration to the  MostHigh  which was due from all that breathed they prostituted a sacrilegious incense to animals and by an inconceivable depravity even kings fell down before them and worshipped them Scarce was found a family faithful to the God of Adam and of Noah insomuch that the Father of nature weary of threatning waiting and punishing abandoned mankind and left them to their perversenessSuch was the unhappy progress of sin in the short space of years the duration of this second epoch  EUGEN  What became then Sir of the true religion Did God in anger deprive men of it  ERAST  No The word of the Lord is irrevocable and the certain effect always follows his promise Had he attended only to the sin of our forefathers he would doubtless have destroyed that wicked race but his mercy kept pace with his justice and a prospect of the future merits of the Redeemer which he had announced to the world called back his clemency and induced him to forbearance  THE THIRD EPOCH  In the midst of these crimes which sullied the world God ever watchful for the preservation of religion perceived one just man of the family of Shem and  through him determined to separate the true worshippers from the rest of mankind This was Abraham and he was chosen to be the stock and father of the faithful This was in the year of the world  The MostHigh called him into a country inhabited by the posterity of Canaan determining to establish there his worship and the children of this patriarch whom he had resolved to multiply as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the sea To the promise he made him of giving this land to his descendants he added a more illustrious good namely that great blessing he bestowed through him on all the human race for of Abraham's family Jesus Christ was born  From Jacob the grandson of Abraham and whom Isaac his father blessed in preference to his elder brother Esau thus executing the will of God though he was apparently deceived into it sprang the Israelites or Jews so called from  Israel  the name given him from his wrestling with an angel in the year of the world  After the death of Jacob whose son Joseph had made such a figure in the court of Pharaoh king of Egypt and the administration of his government the house of Abraham became a great people and multiplied so prodigiously as to excite the jealousy of the Egyptians The Israelites or Hebrews faithful to their God were in the very centre of the most monstrous and absurd idolatry unjustly hated and unmercifully persecuted But the Lord raised up Moses as their protector and deliverer having saved him from the waters of the Nile where by an order of the king all the male children of the Israelites were thrown with a design to defeat a prophecy that one should then be born that should rescue the Israelites from their servitude From the waters of the Nile to which Moses then an infant was committed in the year of the world he fell under the notice of Pharaoh's daughter there walking who rescued him from a watery grave and brought him up as her own son  For forty years Moses despised the riches of the court of Egypt and moved with the distresses of his brother  Israelites whom Pharaoh continued to persecute combated every danger to comfort them But they far from profiting by his zeal and his resolution exposed themselves to the fury of Pharaoh who was determined on their ruin Moses saved himself by flight he fled into Arabia where he passed forty years as a shepherd at the end of which time he saw the burning bush from the midst of which God spake to him and directed him to return to Egypt and free his brethren from their slavery  The pains he took to effect this his remonstrances with Pharaoh his punishment of that king by bringing on his country the many plagues it endured his conducting the Israelites across the red sea where the water miraculously divided to the right and left to suffer them to pass through and united again to drown Pharaoh and all his host attempting to follow them in order to force them back you are too well acquainted with to need a repetition here All that is necessary to know is that Moses through the interference of God became the deliverer of the Jewish nation after more than two ages of servitude and years after the calling of Abraham This was in the year of the world or years before the birth of Christ  THE FOURTH EPOCH  God having freed his people from the tyranny of the Egyptians to conduct them to a land which he had promised to their father laid down the law which he would have them to follow  In the journey of these Israelites in number besides old men women and children God provided for them miraculously he rained down manna a kind of bread from Heaven and water gushed out from rocks at the command of their leader nor did their cloaths wear out but fitted them and their children during their whole journey which took up the space of forty years  They no sooner had passed the red sea and were free from the pursuit of the Egyptians than God directed Moses to ascend Mount Sinai occasionally the Israelites continuing at the foot of itwhere he delivered into his  hands two tables of stone on which he had engraved the decalogue or ten commandments and at times gave him such other instructions as he thought necessary This decalogue was by no means a new law but that which God had written in the hearts of all men long before it containing only the first principles of man's duty to God and to his neighbour His renewal of this law and giving it in writing was because the ignorance and passions of men had almost effaced it from their memory In one of his visits to the top of Sinai he continued forty days during which the Israelites murmured and fancying Moses had deserted them made a golden calf and fell down and worshipped it Moses on his return to punish the guilty called the children of Levi and ordered them to put the idolaters to death which they did to the number of three thousand  After God had delivered the commandments to Moses he gave him other precepts which he was to consider as an explanation of the written law He ordered him to build a temple or tabernacle to deposit this law in to erect an altar and stablish a priesthood To this office Moses appointed his brother Aaron Thus did God establish ceremonies and an outward form of worship and the Levites the grandchildren of Jacob by their father Levi were consecrated to serve at the altars  After these great establishments they pursued their journey into the desarts of Arabia Before the completion of which Moses died and God appointed Joshua his successor who ordered this history which Moses had begun to be continued  EUGEN  And where is this history to be found  ERAST  The hisory which Moses wrote is contained in the five books of  Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers  and  Deuteronomy  called the  Pentateuch  and which comprize the institution of religion  Genesis  contains the history of the world from the creation to the death of Joseph a space of years  Exodus  comprehends the history of the Jews from the death of Joseph to the building of the tabernacle an interval of years  Leviticus  unfolds the administration of the Levite's Moses  here treats of the ceremonies of the Jewish religion the different sorts of sacrifices and other things In  Numbers  we have what happened to God's people in the space of six weeks only In  Deuteronomy  Moses gives a recapitulation of the law to those whose fathers died in passing the desarts and relates every thing that happened from their leaving Egypt till that time The subsequent books continued by order of Joshua are the book of  Joshua  the books of  Judges Samuel  and of the  Kings  After the death fo Moses God multiplied his favours upon his chosen people Docile to the voice of Joshua as the  red sea  had divided in obedience to the command of Moses the river Jordan divided and presented them a passage also Every thing fled at the approach of the Hebrew general all opposition fell before him and the land of Canaan became the property of these new comers Ramparts of towns fell miraculously at the sound of their trumpets the sum supended his course to enable them to complete their victories and the powerful hand of the Master of Nature was seen in every step they took  EUGEN  Without the interfering hand of Providence it would have been impossible to have conducted on so great a multitude of people through so many difficulties and for such a length of time  ERAST  You reson right God you see  did  interfere He compelled Pharaoh to let his people go by repeated plagues or punishments on his country he opened a passage for them through the red sea destroyed their pursuers shewed himself to them on Mount Sinai gave them a written law put to death those who revolted fed and clothed them miraculously cleared the way before them fought their battles made the earth open and swallow up the mutineers and brought them almost in spite of themselves and the combined forces of the neighbouring states to the land he had promised to their ancestor Abraham  EUGEN  How awfully wonderful is God in all his works  ERAST  When they reached Canaan after a war of six years almost all the promised land acknowledged the  laws of the children of Jacob divided among them by the direction of Joshua It was divided into twelve provinces according to the number of the tribes the tribe of Levi indeed had no part in the division because God would have the Levites spread among all the tribes that by their example and advice they might keep up a spirit of religion among their brethren and preserve the worship of the true God as a remembrane of his goodness  The following table with shew you the succession of the Patriarchs and from whom they sprung each man below being the son of the one above him  BEFORE THE FLOOD  A Space of    Years  Adam created before Christ died  Seth third son of Adam born before Christ died aged  Enos born before Christ died aged  Cainan born before Christ died aged  Mahalaleel born before Xt died aged  Jared before Xt died aged  Enoch born before Xt taken up into heaven aged  Methusalah born before Xt died aged  Lamech born before Xt died aged  Noah born before Christ died aged years after the flood  AFTER THE FLOOD  A Space of    Years  Shem the son of Noah born died before Christ  Arphaxad born died before Christ  Salah born died before Christ  Eber born died before Christ  Peleg born died before Christ  Reu born died before Christ  Seneg born died before Christ  Nahor born died before Christ  Terah born before Christ died aged  Abraham born before Christ died aged  Now from Abraham through King David in a right line sprung Joseph the husband of Mary the mother of our Saviour David was a lineal descendant of Abraham fourteen generations removed and Joseph twentyseven generations removed from David so that Christ was only sixty generations from father to son removed from Adam This family from Abraham is traced in the first chapter of the Gospel of Saint Matthew  After the death of Joshua which happened soon after the establishment of the Israelites in the land of Canaan things went pretty smoothly on for a number of years At times they forgot the goodness of God to them and allied themselves to their idolatrous neighbours the consequence of which was the Lord threw them again into bondage As often as they returned to their duty the Lord was their friend and deliverer and whenever they failed in that duty they became slaves to some sovereign power In this state they continued with very little alteration till the end of the fourth Epoch and the reign of Solomon son of David their king years after their departure from Egypt and years before the birth of Christ  THE FIFTH EPOCH  After the death of Solomon which happened years before Christ the Israelites dissembled and chose Rehoboam the son of Solomon their king but the people under Jeroboam applying to him for the redress of some grievances and being harshly denied ten of the tribes revolted and set up Jeroboam as king of Israel whilst Rehoboam reigned over the tribes of Judah and Benjamin who preserved the religion of Moses and continued in the faith of Abraham To these the Levites joined themselves This faction or division of the kingdom of Israel lasted years  The reign of Jeroboam and his successors were however troubled he experienced the displeasure of Heaven whilst those of Judah were particularly patronized The revolving tribes felt the severe effects of war and famine so that mothers were reduced even to the necessity of feeding  upon their own children and were delivered over to  e tyranny and persecution of their enemies they were  ansported to Nineveh and mixed with other nations  hereas the other tribes continued under kings of the  ouse of David and were under the immediate protection  f the MostHigh and one time in particular being  esieged in Jerusalem by Sennacherib king of Assyria the  ord fought their cause and by an angel in one night  lew of the Assyrian army This was foretold  y the prophet Isaiah some time before  The people of Judah however fell like those of Israel into idolatry and became in their turn a prey to the Assyrian monarchy being taken by Nebuchadnezzar then king of Babylon who destroyed the city of Jerusalem and  aid waste the magnificent temple which Solomon had built  EUGEN  How many years was this after the discontinuance of the kingdom of Israel  ERAST  One hundred and thirtyfour years and after the revolt of the ten tribes Isaiah who predicted the fall of Jerusalem foretold also it's glorious reestablishment under Cyrus years before it happened Jeremiah who pointed out the certain ruin of this ungrateful people told them however that their thraldom would continue only seventy years  Babylon was triumphant but her affairs became afterwards disordered and the period marked by the prophets for the reestablishment of Juda arrived amidst these troubles Cyrus appeared at the head of the Medes and Persians every thing gave way to this formidable conqueror and the Jews once more recovered their freedom they were permitted to return to their own country and directed to rebuild the temple of Jerusalem with the utmost expedition The number that returned amounted to besides proselytes menservants and maidservants to the number of  THE SIXTH EPOCH  It was Zorobabel of the tribe of Juda and of the bloodroyal who brought back the captives The temple was rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem new raised and  the people of Israel enjoyed a profound peace under the kings of the Persia  EUGEN  Is there no other book in which the history of the Jews is related but the Holy Bible  ERAST  We have it there that is in the bible upon the most unquestionable authority but this history is also related in the works of Josephus a learned Jew who wrote soon after the death of our Saviour that is in the year  This peace however was in some measure interrupted by Alexander the Great about years before Christ who passing out of Europe laid waste the Persian empire Being on the march to Jerusalem in order to besiege it the highpriest put on his priestly habit and with a great number of people cloathed in vestments went out to meet him As soon as Alexander saw the highpriest he fell prostrate before him saying that whilst he was in Macedonia a man appeared to him in the very same habit and invited him into Asia promising to deliver the Persian empire into his hands and the highpriest shewing him the prophecy of Daniel  that a Grecian should come and destroy the Persians  he was confirmed in the perswasion that he himself was the man This led him to respect the temple he designed to pillage and destroy and to support the Jews in their privileges In short he subdued the Persians Darius was slain and Alexander became universal monarch over the eastern world  It was about this time that is about years before Christ that seventy Jews distinguished for their learning were employed by Ptolemy king of Egypt with consent of the nation to translate the bible from its original Hebrew into Greek It is from these called the  Septuagint  translation Hence the Jewish religion began to be the known among the Gentiles the temple of Jerusalem was enriched with gifts both from kings and people and the Jews were respected every where  Allured by the treasures within the temple Seleucus king of Syria sent a person to bring it away this man was struck down by angels and almost killed but at the prayers of the highpriest soon after recovered  Antiochus however who succeeded Seleucus on the throne of Syria conceived a design of destroying the Jewish nation and dividing it's wealth among his own people he succeeded in his enterprize sacked the city slew of the inhabitants took as many prisoners pillaged the temple and endeavoured to abolish the worship of God  Matthias and his son Judas Maccabeus opposed the violence of this tyrant and with a handful of soldiers performed wonders destroyed the army of Antiochus and purified the temple three years and an half after it's prosanation  EUGEN  This surely was an interference of the Almighty  ERAST  It certainly was Antiochus soon after died a miserable death He was suddenly siezed wiht a general putrefaction so as to breed worms in all parts of him and on his deathbed he admitted this to be a punishment for the injury he had done to Jerusalem  After this the Jews became a flourishing nation and continued so with but few alterations or changes till about years before the birth of Chrish when Pompey the Roman general disspossessed Antiochus the last king of Syria took Jerusalem and made the Jews tributary to the Romans  The Romans now being absolute masters of this whole country Herodan Idumean was by them appointed king of Judea and it was in Herod's reign that Jesus Christ was born years after the creation of the world  EUGEN  What wonderful revolutions and changes have happened to one single nation and how uniformly did God continue to support his chosen people and carry on the cause of his religion  A CURSORY VIEW OF English History  DISCOURSE I  ERAST  HAVING given you my dear Eugenius some account of Sacred History I will now endeavour to give you some light into that of our own country  EUGEN  You will find me all attention  ERAST  The History of England may be divided into three periods The first from the commencement of our knowledge of this country to it's conquest by the Normans the second from that conquest to the alteration of the constitution by the beheading of King Charles and the last from King Charles's death to the present time  Before the Romans entered this island which was fifty four years before the birth of Christ the country was populous and stored with great plenty of animals savage and domestic Towns were few and house were meanly built and scattered up and down The ancient Britons lived upon milk and flesh procured by hunting and went almost naked painting their bodies with different colours the only garments they wore were the skins of beasts thrown over their shoulders and another round their waists  EUGEN  Had they no sort of government among them  ERAST  What government they had consisted of petty principalities who united in cases of common danger and chose a leader by general consent In short the people were little better than savages  EUGEN  Had they no religion among them  ERAST  They had a fraternity among them known by the name of Druids who were majestrates as well as priests and who taught a morality which principally consisited in justice  ce and fortitude they lived in woods and caverns and  ollow trees and their food was acorns and wild berries It was in the spirit of conquest that Julius Caesar invaded his country from Gaul now France in order to add it  o the Roman territories He appeared off the coast of  ussex and though the Britons made the bravest oposition  ade good his landing and in a very littel time completed  is conquest for the British forces laid down their arms and acknowledged the Roman power Julius Caesar made  o long stay in this island but having laid the Britons under tribute returned to Gaul  The second expedition of the Romans into Britain was  ander Claudius in the year Caractacus their King made a brave defence but was at last defeated and taken prisoner From this time the Romans continued in Britain and mixed with the natives but their troubles at home obliging the Roman emperor to call back his forces from this country in the year the Britons were once more lest to themselves and such were the dissensions of this people among themselves that forty years afterwards they were driven to the necessity of applying to the Romans for re  ief against the inroads of the Picts and Scots  EUGEN  Who were these Picts  ERAST  They were part of the natives of Britain who had been driven by the Romans into the North of England and who were always ravaging the Southern parts whenever they had an opportunity  EUGEN  Did the Romans afford them any succour  ERAST  None they were too much engaged in quieting hostilities in their own country to think of a people at so great a distance the consequence of which was that the Britons invited over the Saxons who were then settled in Germany  EUGEN  Were the Saxons as savage as the Britons  ERAST  No the Saxons were a more polished people but not so refined as the Romans and they dressed with a degree of eleganceThe women wore linen garments trimmed and striped with purple and their hair fell in ringlets on their shoulders no part of their bodies was  exposed to the weather but their faces their arms and their bosoms  EUGEN  Did the Saxons come over  ERAST  On this invitation in the year great numbers came to the assistance of the Britons with Hengift and Horsa two brothers at their head They marched in conjunction with the British arms against the Picts and obliged them to retire into Scotland and finding themselves very powerful sent over for more forces turned their arms upon the Britons and in one century subdued all England and established here seven different kindgoms known by the name of the Saxon  Heptarchy  This took place about  EUGEN  What became of the Britons after this  ERAST  Many went over to France and settled in that part now called  Britany  many of the fell in a variety of engagements many were massacred and the few of spirit that remained to escape the fury of their conquerors retired to the mountainous parts of Wales and Cornwall Such as chose to continue among the Saxons became slaves to this people turning their hands to agriculture and holding their lands at the will and pleasure of their landlords The children of these miserable Britons belonged to the soil they tilled like the rest of the stock or cattle on it and were the property of their owners  EUGEN  I presame this is what is understood by  Villenage  ERAST  It is A horrid custom originally borrowed from the Romans and adopted by the Saxons by vicious imitation  The Saxons now finding no enemies to subdue began to fight with each other The princes of the seven kingdoms which they had erected namely  Kent South West  and  East Saxony Northumberland East Angles  and  Mercia  began mutually to rival and envy each other and for the space of above years all the misery that ambition treachery or war could bring upon a kingdom was the consequence of their animosity till at last in the year Egbert descended from the West Saxon kings partly by conquest and partly by inheritance became  he first sole monarch of England the seven kingdoms be  ng in him united into one  EUGEN  It was called England then at that time  ERAST  It then first took this name to distinguish it from the principality of Wales still possessed by the ancient Britons and from that part now called Scotland possessed by the Picts and Scots  No customs truly British or Roman were now to be seen The language of the country which had been either Latin or Celtic was discontinued and the Saxon that is English only was spoken The kingdom was divided into counties or shires and the English if compared to the naked Britons at the invasion of Caesar might be considered as polite Houses furniture cloaths and other luxuries were as general then as at present They were only incapable of sentimental pleasure all the learning of the times was centred in the clergy who were overrun with ignorance and superstition  EUGEN  Christianity I presume had not found a footing here  Austin the monk had been sent over by the Pope in in order to preach christianity and was made the first archbishop of Canterbury He made many converts but this little improved their manners  Egbert was scarce settled on his throne than the whole kingdom was alarmed by the approach of an unexpected enemy A swarm of those nations that possessed the countries bordering on the Baltic began under the names of Danes and Normans to infest the western coasts of Europe plundering those very people who some centuries before had invaded the places where they were now settled and driven out the inhabitants The Normans fell upon the Northern coasts of France the Danes on the Southern parts of England  A D The people of this island had been too much exhausted in civil war to make much opposition Some battles were fought but the Danes kept their footing fortified posts and passages and built castles for their defence of which there are many remains at this day  EUGEN  How did the Saxons relish this  ERAST  The Danes and Saxons were originally from the same country of course their similitude of language laws and manners soon produced an intercourse between both nations and though they were still enemies the Danes gradually mingled with the people of England and submitted to it's government  EUGEN  Were they of the same religion  ERAST  No The English were christians and the Danes Pagans of course though the English in some measure admitted them yet they secretly hated them this produced frequent contensts and frequently laid the country in blood  In this period of cruelty jealousy and desolation a man seemed raised up to defend the rights of his bleeding country and improve the age in which he lived This was Alfred the fourth son of Ethelwolf king of England and grandson of Egbert who on the death of his brother Ethelred was called to the English crown of which he was put into possession only nominally the country being overrun by the Danes  His reign began with wars and his first battles were fought with succeess but being at length overpowered he was obliged to save himself by flight He retired to the cottage of a cowherd in Somersetshire and lived six months there as a servant no one being privy to this retreat of his but his friend the Earl of Devonshire  EUGEN  What set him on the throne again  ERAST  A fortunate victory over the Danes by the Earl of DevonshireNot knowing how to get at the strenght of the enemy Alfred disguised himself as a shepherd and traversed the Danish camp with a harp and as he excelled on this instrument he soon got access to the Danish generals finding they were divided among themselves he seized the favourable opportunity flew to the Earl of Devonshire headed his troops forced their camp and gained a complete victory  EUGEN  A very enterprising man  ERAST  He soon by his address got himself acknowledged king by the Danes he then besieged London and took it fitted out a fleet and repressed any further invasion  To him we are indebted for many of our mildest laws  r the art of building with brick and for the university of Oxford which he founded The was an excellent histo  ian a good Latin scholar and from his reign English hisory may be said to commence  EUGEN  How long did he reign  ERAST  He died in the year aged fifty one after reign of more than twentyeight years and was succeeded by his second son Edward in whose reign the university of Cambridge was founded  EUGEN  Who succeeded Edward  ERAST  His natural son Athelstan in under whose auspices the bible was translated into Saxon and the thristian religion gained ground His son Edmund the first was his successor in whose reign is no otherwise remarkable than by his instituting the first capital punishment having ordained that in gangs of robbers when taken the oldest should be hanged He lost his life in a very extraordinary manner after a reign of seven years Solemnizing a festival in Gloucestershire and observing a fellow who had been banished the kingdom for his crimes fitting at one of the tables in the hall where he dined he was so offended at his insolence that he ordered him to be apprehended and perceiving the villain drawing a dagger in order to defend himself the king started up and catching him by the hair dragged him our of the hall but in doing this he met his death for the ruffian in the scuffle stabbed him to the heart  Edred his brother succeeded him and was so weak a prince that under him the monks gained great influence and had the chief direction of affairs He died in left several sons but being very young they were set aside and Edwy his eldest brother's son was placed on the throne At this time the crown appears to have been elective and those elections wholly influenced by the clergy The English during this short reign were divided by religious disputes and involved in civil war whilst the Danes were increasing in strength and sending over for fresh forces  EUGEN  What do you mean by  civil war  EREST  A war at home among ourselves one pa  of the people fighting with the other Edred was elected king by the secular priests but the monks in dethroned him and placed his brother Edgar in his room  EUGEN  England is said then to have been exceedingly happy  ERAST  Happier than under any former one Under this reign it's fleet amounted to upwards of four thousand ships Foreign princes came to Edgar's court and returned without molestation Music painting and poetry were held as refined accomplishments and gallantry was the characteristic of the king It is related that he was enjoined by Dunstan archbishop of Canterbury not to wear his crown for seven years for having debauched a nun His amour with the beautiful Elfrida is worth your attention  EUGEN  Pray let me hear it  ERAST  She was the daughter of the Earl of Devonshire and Edgar unwilling to credit the great report of her beauty sent Ethelwolfe a friend to see her that he might be better satisfied designing if report spoke truth to pay his addresses to her This friend no sooner saw her than he became desperately in love with her and forgetting his errand made proposals to her himself his hand was accepted and they were privately married returning however to court and assuring the king that she was so far from handsome that he wondered the world could speak of her Edgar thought no more of her Sometime afterwards he represented to the king that though the fortune of the Earl of Devonshire's daughter would be trifting to a monarch yet it would be an immense sum to a needy subject and solicited his permission to pay his court to her Edgar consenting Ethelwolfe returned to his wife and their nuptials were publickly solemnized Now though he had the precaution not to let her appear at court his treachery was not long concealed Edgar was made acquainted with the whole but disembling his resentment took an opportunity of visiting the part of the country where she lived Accompanied by his favourite when he was near the place he told him he had a curiosity to see his wife of whom he  had a curiosity to see his wife of whom he had formerly  ard so much Ethelwolfe thunderstruck did all he could disswade him but in vain all he could obtain was to  before under pretence of preparing her for the king's  eption He then informed his wife of the steps he had  en to be possessed of her charms and conjured her to  nceal her beauty as much as possible Elfrida promised  mpliance but prompted either by vanity or revenge set  rself off to the best advantage The king no sooner saw  r but was smitten and was instantly resolved to have  r He took his leave however with a seeming indiffer  ce Ethelwolfe was soon after sent to Northumberland  a pretence of urgent affairs and in his journey was  urdered in a wood by the king's command who took  frida to court and married her Edgar however was  aced among the number of the saints by the Monks  o have written his history  Ladies you see were admitted to court in this early pe  d but polite as the age seems to have been there was  ll a degree of savage barbarity among the people  he defects of Edgar's government fell upon his successors  e power of the Monks encreased and that of the state Tened in proportion Edgar

them for his safety but soon after strength  ed by an alliance with the duke of Normandy and  ich was the first connexion with that family he laid a  testable scheme to massacre all the Danes throughout  e kingdom The plot was carried into execution and  ost of them were destroyed in one day This was in  e year  Suenon king of Denmark exasperated at this slaugh  of his countrymen soon

Normandy with his brother Alfred  EUGEN  How long had the throne of England be in possession of the Danish kings  ERAST  Thirty seven years but with the death  Hradicanute expired not only the dominion of but  future attempts of invasion from the Danes Thou  their ravages had continued for above two hundred yea  yet they left no change of laws customs language or  ligion The many castles they built and the many  milies they left behind them served alone to discover  places of their establishment After the accession  Edward to the crown the English and Danes as if w  ried with mutual slaughter united in support of gove  ment and peaceably living among each other form  ever after but one people  The reign of Edward was long and happy he had li  long in Normandy and in some measure adopted the language and learning of that country It was by the  terest of Earl Godwin that Edward obtained the crow  having married this nobleman's daughter but having  children by her it led Godwin to endeavour at establ  ing his own son Harold on the throne which on the de  of Edward he succeeded in but not without Edward's having on his deathbed nominated William Duke of Normandy as his successor  EUGEN  Was not his Edward the first King who pretended to cure the king's evil by touching the affected part  ERAST  He wasAnd the superstituous ceremony continued to be practised by the sovereigns of England till the reign of King George the first who wisely dropped it It was the sanctity of Edward that gave rise to the belief of so extraordinary a cure and it was this his continence and his pretending to have the gift of prophecy that procured him a distinguished place amodg the saints he was called Edward the confessor  On the death of Edward in Harold the second the son of Earl Godwin took possession of the throne and with the consent of the people His brother Tosti also put in a claim for it as elder brother but Harold was in possession and though Tosti procured assistance from Norway and invaded England in the north it answered no purpose the invaders were defeated at the battle of Standford and were obliged to retire but the joy of this victory was soon damped by the news that Williams duke of Normandy had landed at Hastings in Sussex with a great army determined to support his claim to the crown from the nomination of Edward This happened Sep  EUGEN  Who was this William  ERAST  He was the natural son of Robert duke of Normandy by a tanner's daughter Harold returned from the north with all the forces he could muster and gave him battle on the th day of October following at Hastings William sent an offer to Harold to decide the dispute by single combat and spare the effusion of the peoples blood but Harold refused and said he would leave it to the determination of God Numerous were the forces on both sides and great was the contest William had three horses killed under him and lost men Harold lost near he was as active and brave as man could be but was conquered after all Making a  furious onset at the head of his troops he was shot through the skull with an arrow and all the courage of the English died with him  This was the end of the Saxon monarchy in England which had continued for more than six hundred years and closes the first period of the British history  DISCOURSE II  THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED  The Second Period  ERAST  TO pursue now the thread of our history we will enter upon that part which gives birth to our present happy constitution those laws so much esteemed by the rest of Europe and those liberties so dear to every Englishman  Immediately after the battle of Hastings the conquero  marched to London where the bishops and magistrate  met him and offered him the crown Numberless however were the insurrections of the people against their new monarch so that William though disposed to mildness was forced to pursue rigorous measures He had engaged to provide for those adventurers who accompanie  him to England and as he was diffident of the English he removed them from all places of trust and confidence and gave them to his Norman followers The English were deprived of arms and forbidden to have any light i  their houses after eight o'clock in the evening at which time a bell was rung called a  curfew  as a warning to pu  their fire and candle out  EUGEN  Were there none of Edward's family living t  contest the crown  ERAST  There was a son of Edmund II Edward th  martyr's brother called Edgar Atheling This young man was abroad when Canute took possession of the crown His father Edmund had been proclaimed king on th  death of Suenon king of Denmark in who had  surped the English crown but was soon after murdered at Oxford when Canute had quiet possession of the throne This young man Edgar Atheling applyed to the king  f Scotland for assistance and under his protection invad  d England in the north William met their forces but  nstead of a battle proposed a negociation Edgar resigned  is pretensions at this treaty and passed the remainder of his life as a private gentleman  William now seated securely on the throne introduced  everal new regulations he ordered all lawproceedings  o be in the Norman language deprived bishops from  olding the office of judges which they had enjoyed du  ing all the Saxons reigns restrained the clergy and laboured to abolish trials by  ordeal  and by  battle  EUGEN  Of what nature was this trial by  ordeal  ERAST  This was a remnant of Pagan superstition  eld in veneration by the Saxons and was made use of to prove whether persons accused were innocent or guilty  Waterordeal  was confined to the lower class of people  reordeal  to the upper In waterordeal the accused was thrown bound into the water if he sunk he was declared  nnocent if he swam guilty In fireordeal the accused person was brought into an open plain and several plough  hares heated redhot were placed at equal distances before him over these he was to walk blindfold and if he  missed them by treading between them he was acquitted of the charge As these trials were sometimes allowed to  e performed by deputy we hence derive the expression "of going through fire and water to serve another" This mode of trial was not however abolished till the  eign of Henry III  EUGEN  What was the trial by  battle  ERAST  This was another instance of the deplorable barbarity of the times It was performed by single combat in a place appointed for the purpose between the accuser and the accused He that conquered was deemed innocent and the other if he survived was sure to suffer as a malefactor some time after This mode of trial still continues legal though out of use Trial by battle as  well as ordeal was set aside in William's reign and that by a jury of twelve men with which you are acquainted and which was common among the Saxons was confirmed by him with all the sanction of royalty  EUGEN  It is certainly more consistent with reason and justice  ERAST  William having continued years in England now thought of revisiting his native dominions being established in the dukedom of Normandy on the death of his father but he was no sooner gone than a conspiracy was set on foot carried on by the Normans as well as English William to gratify his followers from Normandy had disposed of the estates of those who fell in the battle of Hastings among them He gave each a certain quantity of land with all the inhabitants dwelling on that land so that these inhabitants were wholly at the will of their Lord and they were called his bondmen For this land the Lord was obliged to arm his vassals and march out in defence of the king whenever he pleased to call upon them so that each lord of a district or baron was the head of a little army this manner of holding lands is called  feudal tenure  and was an improvement of that state of villenage of which I have already spoken for at this time there was no standing army  EUGEN  How long did this state of vassalage continue  ERAST  Military services for land was dropped under the reign of Henry II when money was paid in lieu of them but a remnant of this vassalage continues to this day I have explained to you the nature of manors and copyhold estates which are now held at the will of the lords of the manors in which those estates lie and for which certain acknowledgments are now made by the tenants See the Index  EUGEN  I recollect it well Please to go on with the conspiracy you mentioned  ERAST  The Norman barons conceiving themselves aggrieved carried on a secret correspondence with the kings of Denmark and Ireland and a number of Danish forces were to invade this country in the absence of  William but the conspiracy was discovered before the Danes arrived and two noblemen were beheaded on the  ccasion  Though good fortune seemed to mark his reign thus  ar the decline of it was interrupted with domestic quar  els He had three sons Robert William and Henry His eldest son Robert encouraged by the king of France  ade an attempt to sieze Normandy and William who could place no confidence but in the English was obliged  o use English forces to bring this unnatural son to his  uty and it so happened by the chance of battle that in  n engagement between the Normans and the English William and his son fought with each other unknowingly The son attacked him with such fury that his aged father  ell to the ground with the blow and had not William called out and his voice been recollected by his son his death would immediately have followed but Robert  tung with remorse and a consciousness of duty leaped from his horse raised his father from the ground fell prostate before him begged pardon for his offences and promised future obedience The king moved by the impulse of nature took him once more to his arms and both armies spectators of this affecting scene participated in their joy and reconciliation  William did not live many years after this he invaded France in the year with an English army and leaping a ditch the pummel of his saddle hurt him and occasioned a rupture of which he died leaving to his son Robert the dukedom of Normandy and the crown of England to his son William  William II on ascending the English throne had two very powerful parties to oppose the nobility who still aspired to the same freedom they possessed under the Saxon kings and the clergy who wished to erect themselves into a distinct government  Odo his own uncle took upon him to dispute his title and being supported in this by his brother Robert William waged war with Robert and carried it on with vigour and success Henry the third brother was also involved in this war having taken up arms for not being  paid the money his father left him Such an unnatural contest between three brothers ferved only to weaken themselves and strengthen their enemies The Scots and Welch took this opportunity to make incursions upon the English the clergy complained of encroachments on their privileges the people murmured at the increase o  taxes and the whole country was in arms  But now the attention of all Europe was called off to one of the most remarkable events that history can produce I mean the arming for the first  crusade  EUGEN  What was that  ERAST  Peter surnamed the Hermit who had beheld with indignation the cruel manner in which the infidels who had possession of Christ's sepulchre in the holy land treated the christians who went on pilgrimage there returned to Europe resolved to inspire the princes of christendom with a zeal for it's recovery for the christians of that age thought it an essential part of their duty to go to this tomb occasionally and say their prayers to God Bareheaded and barefooted therefore in the spirit of superstition he travelled from court to court preaching as he went and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people Pope Urban II himself preached the necessity of this holy war and numberless persons of all degrees and nations ardently embraced the cause and put on the redcross the badge of their profession Among this number was Robert duke of Normandy In order to supply money for this expensive undertaking he offered to mortgage his dukedom to his brother William for a stipulated sum William eagerly embraced the proposal He raised the money upon the clergy of this kingdom and when his brother was gone took peaceable possession of his dukedom  In this manner was Normandy again united to the English crown and from this union afterwards arose those wars with France which for whole centuries continued to depopulate both nations  EUGEN  Was not this William killed as he was hunting  ERAST  Yes In the new forest in Hampshire which his father had made by laying waste a number of  illages and banishing the legal possessors He was accidentally shot through the heart with an arrow by a gen  eman hunting with him This happened in the th year of his age and in the year  EUGEN  Who succeeded him  ERAST  There were now two competitors for the Throne Robert who was engaged in the holy war and Henry the youngest brother who remained at home Henry however took possesion of it and endeavoured to secure that possession by gaining the affections of the people He therefore once more confirmed the Saxon  aws and indulged the clergy in all their former privileges  On Robert's return from the holy land where he refused to be crowned king of Jerusalem he found himself deprived of a kingdom which as elder brother to William he considered as his birthright He could not however recover it nor his dukedom of Normandy but in his attempt was taken prisoner and confined twenty six years in Cardiffcastle in Wales where he died  To defend his possessions in Normandy Henry was obliged to wage war with France and during one of the engagements a French cavalier personally attacked the king and struck him twice on the head with such force that all his armour streamed with blood Henry however no way intimidated continued the single combat with resolution and summoning all his strength levelled such a blow at his antagonist as threw him from his horse and the king took him prisoner This decided the victory in favour of the English and hastened a peace  Henry now returning victorious from abroad brought with him a numerous retinue of the nobility In one of the vessels of the fleet his only son and several young noblemen his companions went together to render the voyage more agreeable The young prince desirous to be first ashore promised the seamen a reward if they came in foremost This emulation was fatal to them all the pilot ran the ship upon a rock and immediately she  was dashed to pieces The prince however was put into a boat and would have escaped had he not been called back by the cries of Matilda his sister who was married to the emperor of Germany Henry V and who was ther in the same ship he prevailed upon the sailors to row back to take her in and the approach of save their lives several leaped in so that the boat was overloaded and all except one went to the bottom The prince was eighteen years old When Henry was informed of this he covered his face and never laughed afterwards  EUGEN  Was Matilda drowned among the rest  ERAST  The vessel in which she was escaped and Matilda in it The emperor soon after dying she was married to Geoffrey of Plantagenet earl of Angou by him she had a son named Henry The king obliged the nobility to take an oath to support his daughter on the throne after his decease which they did by observed it no longer than whilst they were obliged to obey Henry did not long survive this but died in the year  During the reign of Henry the barons and the clergy were growing into power each was a petty tyrant over those who held under him In order therefore to confirm privileges so lately acquired they joined in electing a king who might owe his sceptre to them They fixed on Stephen nephew to the deceased king and as for their oaths to Matilda or Maude as she was called the bishops gave them an absolution  The kingdom now began to wear the face of aristoracy in which the barons and clergy might be said to command They built castles fortified and garrisoned them with their own troops from whence when offended they would bid their monarch defiance  EUGEN  And did Stephen submit to this  ERAST  He could not help himself he opposed their measures took some of their castles by force but as the people were dependant on the barons the king could make but little head against them Matilda now claimed the crown in pursuance of her father's disposal of it She came over from Normandy with an armed force and took  possession of the castle of Arundel in Sussex A civil war was the consequence a victory was obtained against the king and though he fought with a party of the enemy with the utmost intrepidity performing more than could be expected from a single arm his sword flying in pieces he was obliged to surrender himself a prisoner The conqueror conducted him from the field and ignominiously said him in irons  Matilda was now proclaimed queen but as she disdained to accept the shadow of royalty and the barons and clergy intending to grant no more offence was soon given Matilda was obliged to quit England again Stephen was released and once more placed upon the throne  Stephen like Matilda not caring to submit to the dictates of his subjects the barons invited over Henry Matilda's son then twenty one years of age who had been long acknowledged as duke of Normandy He soon landed with a formidable army and another civil war would have ensued had it not been agreed on by all parties that Stephen should enjoy the crown for life and that Henry should be his successor Stephen's death the year following soon put his rival in possession  Henry Plantagenet ascending the throne of England in by hereditary succession and with the universal assent of his people and conscious of his strength began to assume those privileges which had been torn from the crown through the weakness of his predecessors  EUGEN  What steps did he take  ERAST  He demolished the castles dismissed all foreign troops resumed the crown lands and enacted some laws by which the people became in some measure independent of the barons He chartered several towns and laid the groundwork of English liberty Having thus diminished the power of the barons by enlarging that of the people he undertook to humble the clergy He proposed that the bishops should not be permitted to go to Rome that no subject should appeal to the Pope that no officer of the crown should be excommunicated or suspended by the clergy and that the clergy themselves should be subject to the temporal judge These propositions  were agreed to Becket archbishop of Canterbury however a powerful and haughty man not caring to submit was condemned as a traitor but escaped punishment by flying his country  The Pope Alexander III espoused Becket's quarrel and after a variety of conferences and negociations with threats and excommunications on the part of the Pope which continued some years Henry thought proper to acquiesce and pardon him The archbishop then made his way into London amidst the exclamations of the people He was no sooner however reinstated in his power than he excommunicated two of the nobility and suspended several of the bishops who had been his enemies Complaint was made to the king then in Normandy and four gentlemen at the instance of Henry as is supposed undertook to curb his insolence they hastened to England entered the cathedral of Canterbury where he was officiating and with a few attendants beat out his brains with clubs at the foot of the altar  His death confirmed those privileges to the clergy which his opposition could not do He was considered as a martyr to his cause and to have fallen by the hand of Henry  In order to divest the attention of the public from suspicions of this nature Henry undertook the conquest of Ireland a project formed some years before but deferred on account of his longprotracted quarrel with Becket The more readily to gain the Pope's consent to this for nothing then could be done without the sanction of Rome he made oath that he was no way concerned in the assassination of this archbishop and made a solemn vow to go barefooted to Becket's tomb and there receive the chiscipline of the church he kept his vow and sometime after was whipped by the Monks accordingly  Having abtained the Pope's consent he subdued Ireland with a rapidity equal to his wishes but the happiness he received from this new accession of power was soon allayed by a conspiracy in his own family This monarch had not many vices but gallantry was one of them His queen was disagreeable and Henry was faithless  His amours with the fair Rosamond whom he kept se  etly in Woodstockpark were soon discovered by his  een She found her out went to her and obliged her  take poison  The matter ended not here the queen's sons took part  her resentment and a conspiracy was formed abetted  all the malecontents in the kingdom Henry opposed  ith his usual prudence and resolution and seemed every  here victorious but ascribing the opposition of his own children to the anger of heaven he was resolved by an  emplary penance to conciliate it's favour This pen  ce was going as I said to Becket's tomb and submitting  be scourged by the Monks It did not however recon  le him to his family so that he pined with grief and  nding his end approach caused himself to be carried into  e church at Chinon in Normandy and expired before  e altar with scarce a single attendant to deplore his fall  EUGEN  We are indebted however to this king for  e of our dominions  ERAST  Nay he not only conquered Ireland but raised l among king of Scotland he took him prisoner  nd made him give up the

personal bravery having concluded a truce with Saladin for three  ears he set sail for his return but tempestuous weather  liged him to land on the coast of Italy where pursuing  s way homeward by land he was taken prisoner near Vienna by the duke of Austria and put into the hands of the Emperor who ungenerously detained him on the  ost frivolous pretence  England had been left in his absence under the government of two bishops who disagreed between themselves and thus weakened the power of the cleargy John the brother of Richard took now advantage of his confinement formented this jealousy among the cleargy and putting himself at the head of the barons encreased their authority by the addition of his own But the cleargy faithful to their king raised l among themselves with this ransom procured his enlargement and he returned His brother John sued to him for pardon and was generously forgiven  Richard was some time after engared in a French war and whilst he was abroad an insurrection took place in London owing to a new tax which the people disliked One William FitzOsborne a lawyer commonly called Longbeard was their ringleader but the principal citizens being called to arms Longbeard was taken convicted and with nine of his accomplices hanged in chains This was the first instance of the people's rising in defence of their liberties independent of the barons or the clergy  EUGEN  How long did Richard reign  ERAST  At the siege of Chaluz near Limoges Richard received a wound on the shoulder with an arrow of which he died after a turbulent reign of ten years  The wars now kindled up between England and France continued to depopulate both countries and John the brother and successor of Richard pursued them with unabating vigour  John mounted the throne in exclusion to his nephew Arthur duke of Bretagne and not contented with this he wrested his dukedom from him also took the unfortunate Arthur prisoner confined him and he was never heard of afterwards John was suspected of putting him to death and this crime opened the way to his future ruin he was cited to Paris to answer for it but not attending his dominions in France were taken from him and John tamely submitted to it  Having thus given offence abroad he soon did the same at home He interfered in the election of an archbishop of Canterbury opposing the Pope's nomination  ich former kings had not done and thus drew upon  n the resentment of the clergy The Pope excommucated him forbad his subjects longer to obey him and  ve the kingdom of the England to the king or France  ilip the French king accepted the gift and prepared to  ke possession of it whilst on the other hand John  d raised army of men and marched to Do  r to oppose him The Pope however stepped in be  een them and by his legate or ambassador in a confer  ce with John at Dover advised him to put himself un  r his protection as the only means to save himself and  ngdom from the king of France John swore to perform  at the Pope should propose and this was to resign his  ngdom into the Pope's hands which he accordingly did public in the most solemn manner  EUGEN  And was the church by this means absolutely  st to him  ERAST  No He held it still but as a tributary prince  the see of Rome that is to say he agreed to pay a cer  in sum annually for the kingdoms of England and Ire  nd and to act in all things as the Pope should direct him  e by this means saved himself from an invasion of the  ng of France  Thus did this king render himself contemptible in the  es of all the world He had now only to offend the  rons to render himself perfectly obnoxious and this he  d not fail to do They demanded the reestablishment  their ancient privileges and John believed himself au  orised to resuse them yet demanded their assistance  recover his lost dominions in France They refusing  is in their turn hostilities began a confederacy was  rmed and he found himself compelled to sign that char  r called  Magna charta  by which the English are said  hold their liberties to this day  This charter was in fact giving the barons leave to  present to the king what they thought grievances and  d he was in forty days to give them satisfaction or  ey were legally impowered to command it This was  infringement of the royal prerogative which he com  ied with through fear but as soon as he was at liberty  retracted from and complained to the Pope of the usurpation of the barons Upon this the Pope excommunicated them  EUEN  You have frequently mentioned excommunication What is this  ERAST  A power the Pope formerly claimed of depriving a person of the benefit of the laws of his country excluding him from the bosom of the church the ecclesiatical court retains the same power now and denounces it on particular offenders When the king was excommunicated the Pope absolved his subjects from their allegiance forbad them to obey and gave away his kingdom to another  What the Pope had formerly done the barons thought proper to do now they offered the crown of England to France and Philip accepted it with joy but fearing the Pope's displeasure he prevailed on the English barons to elect his son Louis In this they agreed and the city of London lent it's assistance Louis landed in England with a large army in John was deposed and Louis was crowned at London which so affected John's spirits that it occasioned his death the same year in the fifty first year of his age after having reigned seventeen years  EUGEN  Did Louis continue king  ERAST  No Had Louis dissembled till firmly seated on the throne he might have retained the crown but the barons wanted a monarch subservient to their power and Louis refused a kingdom upon such conditions He of course after a defeat left England and Henry III the son of John then only ten years old was crowned in his stead and the earl of Pembroke appointed his guardian  Things went on pretty well during the regency of the early of pembroke as he kept up his interest with the clergy and thus preserved a ballanced in the state but no sooner was Henry of age and took the reins of government into his own hands than numberless insurrections and calamities were the result of his obstinacy his folly and his vice Infinite were the struggles of power between the barons and the king Henry's luxury and profuseness  continually rendered him a petitioner to the assembly of  e barons for money for since the abolition of military  rvices kings asked money instead of soldiers and they  constantly demanded a confirmation of their former pri  leges  He found various methods however of raising money  exaction but not sufficient to supply his wants and  e barons finding nothing could be done with him for  e space of forty years at last shook off their allegiance  nd sent the king notice that they renounced the fealty  ey owed him and considered him only as the common  emy of mankind  Both parties were now in arms the country became  gain the treatre of a civil war and nothing was thought  f but the decision of the sword a battle ensued and the  ing and his son Edward were taken prisoners  The barons and the clergy now called in the sanction  f the people in order to new model the constitution  nd from this time we may truely date the origin of Eng  ish liberty A parliament was summoned in which the  ing was obliged to give orders that four knights from  ach country should sit in order to represent their respec  ive shires This is the first rude outline of an English  ouse of commons The people had been gaining some consequence since the diminution of the feudal laws and  he establishment of corporations by which men were not  o dependent on the men of land and property As arts  ncreased the number of corporations increased and they  ere now so numerous as to be consulted in the legislation Had the barons and people at this time been una  imous they might have governed the nation without a monarch but they disagreed another battle ensued The king's party was victorious and Henry and his son were restored This was in He lived about seventeen years after this died at the age of sixty five and was succeeded by his son Edward I  DISCOURSE III  THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED  ERAST  At the death of his father Edward I was engaged in the holy war where he was wounded and as it is said with a poisoned arrow and that his queen Eleanor who was present healed the wound by sucking out the poison with her mouth  On his return to England he took possession of an undisputed throne and being satisfied with moderate power laboured only to be terrible to his enemies he marched against the Welch and defeated them killed their king and annexed it's principality to the crown of England giving the title of prince of Wales to his eldest son  His next attention was bestowed on Scotland where there were two competitors for the throne Bruce and Baliol Edward was umpire between them that is determined the difference and fixed the crown on the head of Baliol less as a king than as a vassal of England But this bringing on a civil was in that country Edward marched there with a numerous army and had nearly conquered it intending to unite it with England but death interrupted his career in the th year of his age and th of his reign  It is to Edward I however that we owe the great power of the people finding the cleargy and barons were rivals he studied to weaken their force for this purpose he threw weight into the scale of the commons and law was enacted that no tax should be levied without their consent his design was to render himself absolute by their assistance but he died and left the people a share of authority which was given them for very different purposed than the promotion of liberty  He was succeeded in by his fourth son Edward II By his maladministraction and countenancing some favourites in opposition to the barons he brought on a civil war battles were fought many noble prisoners taken on both sides and the scaffolds were drenched with  English blood the leaders of the different parties when  en being instantly put to death Edward's queen was  oud haughty and revengeful woman sister to the  g of France and being faithless to her husband in  guing with Mortimer earl of March the king en  voured to secure him And on her being sent over to  nce on a negotiation her paramour went with her perswaded her brother to espouse her cause and re  ned with an army of which Mortimer was at the head  ve the king battle took him prisoner deposed him  her son a youth of fourteen on the throne hanged her  band's favourites and took upon her the regency du  g her son's minority Nothing now but the death of  ward was wanting to complete her guilt he was sent  m prison to prison the sport of his mercenary keepers  d suffered all the indignities that cruel and ingenious  lainy could devise and was at last very cruelly mur  red in Berkeleycastle by ruffians supposed to be em  yed by her and Mortimer This was in  EUGEN  And did the nation submit to this  ERAST  They did and it is a proof in my opinion their pusillanimity for Edward's greatest fault was the  olence of his friendships Edward III however his  when of age punished his mother and her friend  ortimer for the murder of his father Mortimer was  agged from the queen's presence in spite of her entrea  es to the contrary and was hanged and the queen was  nfined for the rest of her life which was a space of  ears  Under Edward III our parliament the bulwark of  r constitution was reduced to a better form A spirit  liberty breathes in all his laws but no one knew how  make himself more absolute He began his reign by  ducing the Scots to the most distressful situation and  ce more obliged them to acknowledge their dependence  n the crown of England but his attention was soon  rawn off to objects of greater moment On the death  f Charles king of France who left a young wife with  hild there being no apparent heir the next heir to the  rown was to be regent and this office Edward III as  the grandson of a king of France by his mother's fi  claimed in preference to Philip Valois the next he  by the male line Philip's claims were admitted and th  widowed queen being brought to bed of a daughter Philip was elected king Edward therefore disputed th  crown and invaded France with a powerful army  On Edward's landing Philip challengedhim to fing  combat and Edward accepted it but some obstacles intervening the war was prosecuted in the usual manner  many skirmishes took place which at last drew on the decisive battle of Cressy that every honest Englishman boas  of to this hour Philip was at the head of me  and Edward only of the first line of whose ar  was commanded by Edward's son called the black prince from his black hair a youth of fifteen years of age The valour of this lad filled even veterans with astonishment and to him the success of the day was committed In short the English were victorious French were slain and not English Edward in his way home took the town of Calais of which the English kept possession years  Whilst the English were thus employed abroad th  king of Scots took the opportunity and invaded England The queen in the absence of her husband marched at th  head of a large army northwards gave the Scots batth and took their king prisoner  Philips of France soon after dying was succeeded by John and the war continuing Edward the black prince at the head of and English army defeated the French again at the battle of Poictiers and took their king prisoner Thus did Edward see two crowned heads his captives i  London  EUGEN  He would have made a fine heroic king  ERAST  He never lived to be king for the died five years before his father which happened in in the th year of his age after having reigned years H  successor was his grandson Richard a minor eleven year old the son of prince Edward and the regent was  uncle John of Ghent duke of Lancaster  EUGEN  What became of the two captive kings  ERAST  They were both ransomed that is released  he promise of their respective countries paying England  m of money but France not making good her pay  ts John returned to London and died in the Savoy  t this time in order to assist Portugal it was necessary  aise a large sum of money and this parliament thought per to do by a poletax that is each family paying much a head according to the number it consisted  This was so unpalatable to the people that an insur  tion was the consequence headed by one Wat Tyler  wbred man and a desperate one It began in Essex  soon spread to London The people burned and pil  ed where ever they came and when they reached Lon  n took up their quarters about the city Richard  n but fifteen years old riding to Smithfield invited  em to a conference there Tyler with his party gave  n the meeting on horseback and made several proposals  nded in justice but Tyler during his conversation lift  g up his sword in a menacing manner so exasperated  alworth then mayor of London who attended the  ng that the struck Tyler down with his mace and Phil  one of the aldermen riding up run his sword through  bodyTyler's party now bent their bows in order to venge the death of their leader but Richard instead of  ing rode up to the rebels crying out with a resolute  ice "What my lieges will you kill your king Be not concerned for the loss of your leader I myself will be now your general follow me into the field and you shall have whatever you desire  The rebels immediately desisted and the next day re  ived a charter of freedom and a general pardon but  ese only were extorted grants and soon retracted and  e ringleaders were tried and put to death  From this noble act of Walworth's the sword has been art of the city arms ever since  EUGEN  Did no bad consequence follow Richard's reach of his word  ERAST  Yes It made the lower class of people his  nemies and at the age of seventeen he offended the parliament through a scheme he had laid of rendering  himsels absolute The barons were presently at the he  of men and the king was obliged to submit  making a fresh attempt three years after it did not  so well having found means to bring over the pa  ment to his measures many of the opposers lost their li  on the occasion and some were banished The peop  however were far from satisfied and Richard having a  bitrarily banished his cousin the duke of Lancaster's  and the duke of Norfolk for quarrelling the forme  on the death of his father took the opportunity in  whilst Richard was over in Ireland to quell an insurrection there and landed in England when on shore he cal  the people to his assistance they presently raised an ar  of men and became so powerful that Richard  his return could make no head against them he w  obliged therefore to throw himself on the generosity of his enemy Richard was dethroned and the duke Lancafter took the crown as Henry IV  EUGEN  What became of Richard  ERAST  He was sent a prisoner to the tower where was soon after murdered by ruffians employed for th  purpose but not till after he had slain four of his assassin  EUGEN  What was Henry's claim to the crown  ERAST  He was the grandson of Edward III by  fourth son John duke of Lancaster whereas Richard was grandson of Edward III by his eldest son Edward t  black prince but as there was a descendant of the du  of York an older brother than Henry's father his chi  claim was the resignation of Richard in his favour  From this seizure of the crown by Henry IV begand th  contests between the houses of York and Lancaster whi  for several years afterwards deluged the kingdom wit  blood but which in the end contributed to give streng  and consistency to the constitution  Henry during his reign had to contend with the Sco  and the Welch and various rebellions in favour of the hou  of York were stirred up against him the former he ha  the good fortune to defeat and the latter to suppre  The murmurs of the clergy however were of greate  moment Wicklifle who first preached the protesta  doctrine in Germany had published his opinions about  he end of Edward the third's reign and the clergy of England were apprehensive of its' prevailing here Henry  arnestly therefore recommended it to his parliament to prevent it and an act was passed that condemned heretics  o the flames In consequence of this act the rector of a  hurch in England a follower of Wicklifle was condemn  d to the stake and burnt alive the first man in England  ho suffered death in the cause of religion  On the death of Henry IV in his son Henry V who in his juvenile days had led a profligate life associ  ting with men of very abandoned characters ascended  he throne At this barbarous period learning was little  aught after even bishops could scarcely read or write their names Courage seemed to be regarded as the only virtue and that with superstition stamped the character of heroism  EUGEN  Did Henry the fifth's reign proceed undisturbed  ERAST  Henry began his reign in attempting to extirpate the heresy of Wicklifle and Sir John Oldcastle  aron of Cobham the chief protector of this sect was condemned to the flames Such steps must naturally create not only horror but disgust in the people at the severities of such a government Great at this time were the domestic troubles in France and Henry thought it no  ad opportunity to insist on a restitution of Normandy and those provinces that had been taken from England in preceding reigns He for this purpose invaded France with men but an epidemic disorder carried off three fourths of his soldiers Reduced now to men he was opposed by a French army of this disparity of number however did not discourage Henry The two armies met at Agincourt and the English being resolved either to conquer or die fell upon the enemy with such impetuosity that they soon routed them Henry alighted from his horse and fought at the head of his men on foot eighteen french cavaliers resolving either to kill him or fall in the attempt rushed on him at once and one of them stunned him with the blow of a battleax  when two or three Welchmen came to his assistance a  the eighteen Frenchmen were slain Tois intrepidity  their king inspired the English troops with new courag  and the French were defeated Henry made a triumph entry into Paris and receiving the fealty or homage of th  French nobility returned to England to raise fresh forced in order to subdue the country entirely depose thier king who was a lunatic and fix the crown on his own head He went over to France again for that purpose but dea  stopped him in his carreer at the age of thirtyfour  Henry VI and son of Henry V succeeded to th  throne at the age of nine months the duke of Bedford his uncle being appointed regent It was determined  prosecute the French war and Charles VI it's lunat  king being dead and his son Charles VII his next hei  disinherited for the murder of the duke of Burgundy it was resolved to set Henry on the throne of that kingdom He was accordingly proclaimed king of France and the duke of Bedford declared regent of that kingdom whilst his brother the duke of Glocester another of th  king's uncles had the government of England Charle  VII the nominal king of France whenever he attempte  to face his enemy was overthrown and nothing could have helped him but almost a miracle  To bring about by art what force could not atchieve  French gentleman fixed upon the servant maid of an inn  a woman of masculine strength and courage pretendin  to be but eighteen when in reality she was twent  seven years of age and instructed her in the duties of  warrior and prophetess This was Joan of Arc the re  +nowned maid of Orleans She equipped herself in the habit and arms of a man and gave out that she was inspi  ed She was examined by the university and they eithe  deceived or willing to be so affirmed that that be commission came from heaven  The English were at that time besieging the city  Orleans Charles VIIth's last resource and were upo  the point of becoming masters of it when Joan undertoo

 Was Joan of Arc rewarded equal to her de  s  ERAST  In the midst of the French king's good for  e she was taken prisoner by the English prosecuted them for sorcery and condemned and publickly burnt  witch  The loss of France was a distressing calamity to the  glish and at this period the duke of York asserted his  im to the English crown He was a nobleman descend  by the mother's side from Lionel one of the sons of ward III but older than John duke of Lancaster  m whom Henry III was descended of course had a or claim The ensign or banner of the duke was a  ite  rose that of Henry a  red  one This gave names the two houses whose contentions were about to drench  kingdom with slaughter  The queen who was a princess of Sicily and an enter  zing woman had the management of affairs and go  ned every thing with an unlimited authority The  of Suffolk was her favourite and an avowed enemy the house of York but being impeached in parliament  banished and on his passage to France was beheaded board the vessel by a common sailor The death of  man set the duke of York more at his ease  Among the insurrectioins of these times was that in  led on by Jack Cade a man of low condition at head of Kentish men who marched to London  sent to court a list of grievances but which was sup  sed by his being taken and put to death Though  rebel met such a fate his chief object was to favour cause of the duke of York who aspired to the crown  quiet however this powerful man the duke of So  set protector was sent to the tower and the duke of  k appointed in his stead but the king then twenty  three years of age not chusing to be any longer under controul deposed the duke from his power and had re  course to arms being taken however prisoner at th  battle of St Alban's the duke of York was again reinstated in his protectorate Henry was soon after released but being ill the queen took arms in his defence a  led his forces on to oppose the duke's army headed by the earl of Warwick him she gave battle to the king looking on a tame spectator and had the misfortune to b  worsted and her husband taken prisoner a second time  The duke how openly clained the crown the matt  was debated in parliament and it was determined th  Henry should possess the throne for life and should b  succeeded by the duke in exclusion of the prince of Wale  Henry's son  All except the queen agreed to this but she a woma  of spirit and pride flew to Wales animated her o  friends acquired new ones and raised an army to defe  her cause She and her old enemy the duke of York met at Wakefield victory was on her side and the du  and his second son were slain The queen now marche  to London in order to set the king at liberty gave batt  to the earl of Warwick defeated him and released him but the city of London exasperated at his conduct of th  queen's elected the duke of York's son king by  name of Edward IV The queen on this collected great army in the North to the number of  the earl of Warwick accompanied by young king E  ward opposed her with men Never was En  gland depopulated by so dreadful a day Warwi  gained a complete victory but men fell a sacrif  in the contest Edward IV was established on the thro  and the queen fled with her husband to Scotland for p  tection  Wretched as this reign was yet the art of print  was introduced in it through which the age grew m  and more enlightened Learning at this period was  known among the common class of men but by no me  neglected by the clergy  EUGEN  Did the queen set down quietly under this  efeat  ERAST  No Nothing was able to abate her perse  erance She entered England again with her husband  nd five thousand men granted her by the French king  ave her enemy battle and was again defeated when  enry was taken prisoner and conducted to the tower The queen however escaped and retired to her father in  icily  The earl of Warwick who had seated Edward on the  rone proposed his marrying a foreign princess and  dward refusing it so enraged the earl that he became  is enemy and determined to set his brother Clarence on  e throne who had married the earl's daughter To  ring about this purpose he invited Edward to

Edward  ERAST  Edward though an exile in Holland had  ny partizans at home after therefore an absence of  e months he returned to England under a pretence of  iming the dukedom of York when here he usurped  ngly authority made Henry a prisoner again and soon  sing an army in his interest gave Warwick battle at  rnet and there defeated and killed him  The queen still made head against him accompanied  th her son the prince of Wales but she was again de  ted by Edward and the prince was taken prisoner  t he did not long survive for the spirited boy being  ought before his victor and asserting his right the bar  rous monarch struck him with his gauntlet and instantly  the kings brothers viz the dukes of Glocester and Clarence rushed on him with their daggers and destroyed him To complete the tragedy Glocester afterwards Richard III entered king Henry's chamber alone and mundered him in cold blood  EUGEN  What became of the queen  ERAST  She also was taken prisoner but Louis XI king of France paid the king of England crowns for her freedom and she died a few years after in privacy in France  Edward being now settled on the throne wreaked his vengeance on all the Lancastrian party putting all to death whereever he could find them But the great object of his vengeance was Henry earl of Richmond afterwards Henry VII  EUGEN  Who was this nobleman  ERAST  He was the great grandson of the earl of Somerset who was the eldest son of John duke of Lancaster by his last wife whereas Henry IV the grandfather of Henry VI was the duke of Lancaster's son by a former wife  EUGEN  But who was the earl of Richmond's father  ERAST  One Edmund Tudor a Welch gentleman who married a granddaughter of the earl of Somerset I have mentioned of course he was fifth cousin to Edward IV He lived in France to secure himself from Edward's cruelty  Edward had two brother the dukes of Glocester and Clarence Clarence had assisted him in obtaining the crown but being treated afterwards with indifference and reproaching his brother for it the king unmindful of the ties of kindred or of gratitude had him arraigned condemned and put to death He was drowned in a butt of malmsey wine a death of Clarence's own choosing  The rest of Edward's life was spent in riot and debauchery He was going to war with France but died before it took place Edward was handsome and brave but mentally deformed with every vice  EUGEN  His reign was surely a horrid one  ERAST  Horrid as it was you must prepare for events in the next still more so  Edward left two sons the eldest of whom a boy between twelve and thirteen was proclaimed king in and his mother who lately raised among the nobility wished to hide her want of rank among a new promotion was for having a number of peers created This gave offence to the old nobility and Richard duke of Glocester the king's uncle who was of a tyrannical disposition fomented their discontents Having shewn the danger of  etting the queen have the government in her hands he procured himself to be chosen protector of the realm and thus got possession of the young king and his brother the duke of York a child about seven years of age whom  nder a pretence of providing for their safety he sent prisoners to the tower  EUGEN  How was the queen reconciled to this  ERAST  She could not prevent it She had with the princes taken sanctuary in Westminsterabbey but on  he duke of Glocester's promising to be a father to her children she was induced to part with them though with  eluctance  Glocester had no sooner secured their persons but he  asterdized them by act of parliament and by pretended  bstacles put off the young king's coronation Lord Hastings Lord Stanley and some other of the nobility  oresaw the protector's design upon the crown and form  d plans to prevent it But Glocester being aware of it  alled a council at the Tower and when Hastings and  tanley were there charged Hastings with high treason  nd had him immediately beheaded a blow was levelled  t Stanley's life but he escaped under a table Some  thers fell a sacrifice at this time to the protector's resent  ent The duke of Buckingham who was in Richard's  nterest stirred up the people in his favour and prevail  d on the city of London to offer him the crown which  e seemed at first unwilling to accept but was at length  revailed on from an idea that his brother's children  ere bastards and of course not entitled to inherit  and that was the young king to be crowned the kingdom would not be safe in his hands  Richard was accordingly crowned and his next ste  was to make away with his two nephews then in th  Tower To effect this he gave secret orders as it i  said to one Tyrell to put them to death which wa  done by smothering them between two pillows and bur  their bodies under the staircase  EUGEN  Did this Tyrell escape unpunished for hi  crime  ERAST  No Vengeance though late followed hi  and he was executed for it in the succeeding reign whe  he confessed the whole  Thus did Richard wade through every obstacle to th  throne but he did not enjoy it long His friend th  duke of Buckingham not having been rewarded according to his expectations conspired against him and declare  for Henry duke of Richmond whom I have alread  mentioned  EUGEN  In what situation was this gentleman  ERAST  He was at this time an exile in Bretagn  and had the good fortune to survive the numerous mass  cres of the preceding reigns He was once delivered up  the ambassadors of Edward IV and was just on the poin  of being brought back to England where he would certainly have been put to death but the duke of Bretag  repented of the act and took him from the ambassador just as he was brought on shipboard Henry was th  only remaining branch of the house of Lancaster and  was the person whom the duke of Buckingham pitch  upon to dethrone the tyrant Richard  EUGEN  How old was Henry  ERAST  Quite a young man not more than twent  seven He promised in case he succeeded to the thron  to marry the daughter of Edward IV the only survivi  heir of that family and Richard having rendered hi  self exceedingly unpopular the people were in gene  against him Henry was therefore encouraged to inva  England which he did at the head of about foreign  ops and was joined when here by about English  d Welch  EUGEN  Did not the duke of Buckingham join him  ERAST  He headed a party of Welch Henry's fa  our but being deserted by his followers was obliged to  crete himself in the house of one who had originally been  s servant and to whom he had been very kind yet this  rvaat gave him up for a reward and he was beheaded  en without a trial  EUGEN  Did not this discourage Henry  ERAST  Not at all It was rather a spur to his en  rprize He gave Richard then at the head of  en battle at Bosworthfield where he had the good  ortune to slay him but not before Richard had displayed  me very astonishing acts of personal valour  Richard's crown being found by one of the soldiers was  mmediately placed on the head of the conqueror by  at very Lord Stanley whom Richard had endeavoured  destroy at the council in the tower Thus in the death of Richard ended the race of the Plantagenet kings which  ad been in possession of the crown for three hundred and thirty years and in him also ended the contest between the houses of York and Lancaster which had for thirty  ears been a scourge to the kingdom and in which above  hundred thousand men lost their lives either by battle  r the scaffold  EUGEN  Had Richard no family  ERAST  None He married the widow of the young  rince of Wales Henry VIth's son whom he had mur  ered but she felt the consequences of her ingratitude to  er former husband in the inhumanity of Richard for he  reated her so ill that she broke her heart as he wished  is view being to marry his niece the daughter of Edward IV but she detested the proposal and would not think of it  From the accession of Henry VII to the throne of this country the whole government seems to have put on a  ew form If he was not the greatest prince he was by far the most useful one that ever reigned A nation of tumult was reduced through him to a civil subordination  an insolent and factious aristocracy was humbled wise laws were enacted commerce restored and peace and happiness introduced to a people little better than in a state of barbarism for thirteen hundred years before  Henry's first care was to marry the princess Elizabeth daughter of Edward IV thus uniting the interests of the houses of Lancaster and York He has been accused of avarice but perhaps unjustly so Before his reign it was usual for high treason to take away the life of the aggressor and give away his fortune to some court favourite This Henry perceived had two bad effects it excited resentment by it's cruelty and made a favourite too powerful for subjection to avoid this he deprived such as were taken in arms of their property and reserved it for the use of the crown He was a great economist which enabled him not only to be useful to the poor but just to his own creditors  Immediately after his marriage he issued out a general pardon to all who would accept of it but those who flew to arms were quelled and some of the ringleaders executed  Sagacious however as Henry was he was jealous of his power and though the earl of Warwick a son of the duke of Clarence Edward the IVth's brother was only a boy and nothing alledged against him still as he was related to the house of York he shut him up a close prisoner in the tower This youth was however made an instrument to deceive the people A priest of Oxford had trained up one Lambert Simnel a baker's son to counterfeit the person of this earl and having prepared him for his purpose he sat out for Ireland and there opened the scene The plot unfolded to his wish Simnel was received and proclaimed king and was conducted by the people and officers of state with great pomp to the castle  EUGEN  What could have induced this priest to play off this trick  ERAST  It was a scheme of the queen dowager's to dispossess Henry of the crown for which she was confined in a monastery where she remained many year till she died To get rid however of this imposture Henry  rdered the earl of Warwick who was still a prisoner in the tower to be led publickly through the streets of London to convince the people of the deception But this did not answer the purpose Simnel being joined by some of the discontented party came over to England and marched to York The people here did not join him and the king giving him battle Simnel's party was de  eated and he himself taken prisoner Henry had too  uch greatness of mind to put him to death but appointed him to a mean office in his service in which post  e died As for the priest his instructor he was made a prisoner for life  All things being thus adjusted Henry laid a design of recovering his French dominions by an attack upon France and the parliament furnished him with supplies for that purpose but when the money came to be collected it occasioned a new insurrection and the earl of Northumberland in attempting to enforce obedience to  he laws was killed by the mob in Yorkshire The mutineers did not stop here but by the advice of one John  Chambre marched towards London to give the king battle and the consequence was a defeat and the death of their ringleader who was executed upon the occasion  Scarce was this matter ended but the old duchess of Burgundy sister to Edward IV set on foot another impostor She first spread a report that the duke of York Edward IVth's second son was not murdered in the tower as was said but was still alive and then pitched upon a genteel young man the son of a Flemish Jew to personate him At the desire of the duchess the king of France received him but afterwards at Henry's request discountenanced him  Henry took some pains to shew the people the fallacy of this by proving that the duke of York was dead and punishing his murderers and by tracing the impostor whose name was Perkin Warbeck to his original obscurity but so determined was the king's enemies to dispossess him of the crown that nothing could interrupt their design Warbeck landed in Kent but was soon driven off again by the inhabitants He went from thence  to Ireland and next to Scotland where James IV ki  of that country received him acknowledged his prete  sions and gave him in marriage one of his kinswomen a daughter of the earl of Huntley and by marching a army into England made another attempt to set him o  the throne James however not finding the country  in his cause retired into Scotland and obliged Perkin  seek for a new protector  EUGEN  He must have played his part very well obtain such countenance  ERAST  If he was not the duke of York he certain was very well instructed but there are historians w  say that he and his brother Edward V were clandestine sent abroad that Edward V died but that his brother survived and was the same who was afterwards known  the name of Perkin Warbeck However be this as  will he had been acknowledged in France Flanders Ir  land and Scotland as lawful heir to the British crow  and had made some bold attempt to second his pretensions There was at this time also an insurrection Cornwall under one Flammoc a lawyer in opposition to some taxes that were levying by act of parliament and as every insurrection now was followed with a project dethroning the king the insurgents marched to London and encamped at Blackheath where the king's for  surrounded and defeated them Some of the ringleader were executed and the rest were permitted to retu  home These men on their return sent for Perkin Warbeck then in Ireland to head them he accepted the invitation landed in the west took the title of Richa  IV and with a body of men attempted to sto  the city of Exeter but without success The ki  marched against him Perkins losing all his courag  fled and took sanctuary in the monastery of Bewdle  â–ª Soon after on the promise of a pardon he surrende  himself and was sent prisoner to the tower where concert with the earl of Warwick plotting against Henry and being convicted of a degsin to escape by killing t  keeper of the tower they were in the year both p  to death  This same year Henry's eldest son Arthur was married  o the princess Catharine of Arrragon the daughter of the  ing of Spain and he dying soon after such was Henry's unwillingness to pay back her marriageportion as by agreement that he consented to her being married again  o his second son afterwards Henry VIII on pretence that the first match had not been consummated  His eldest daughter Margaret was soon after married  o James IV of Scotland through whom the kings of Scotland became possessed of the throne of England and  rough whom our present king George IIId's descent is raced from Henry VII  EUGEN  I wish you would explain this to me  ERAST  For the present let it suffice to say that on the death of queen Elizabeth the granddaughter of Henry VII her cousin James VI of Scotland the greatgrand  on of James IV and Margaret daughter of Henry VII became king of England I will shew you from whom  ur present king is descended when I come to speak of the reign of this James VI who was James I of England  EUGEN  Why did you so extol the character of Henry  ERAST  Because he was fond of peace and seemed to  ave the interest of his people at heart He had no am  ition to extend his power except by treaties and by wisdom and his great plan was to equalize the people by  epressing the nobility and clergy and giving the popu  ace more weight in the scale of government but his greatest efforts were to promote trade and commerce He  ied at the age of fiftytwo having reigned twentythree years  In Henry VIII his son and successor all factions were  xtinguished and all divisions united By the father's  de he claimed the crown from the house of Lancaster by the mother's from the house of York and his father  eft him a kingdom in peace prudent ministers and a full treasury  EUGEN  I presume then his reign was a happy one  ERAST  Far from it The advantages he had he  wed not to himself but either to nature fortune or his  ather Though well educated Henry wanted wisdom and  virtue so that he did not turn the blessings he enjoyed to advantage If ever there was a tyrant he was one  EUGEN  What acts of tyranny was he guilty of  ERAST  The first act of injustice which marked hi  reign was the prosecution and execution of Empson an  Dudley two judges whom his father had appointed t  enquire into cases of treason and levy fines in proportio  to the offence Their conduct was examined and a nothing capital could be brought against them they suffered death upon a false accusation  He next aimed at the crown of France but at the loss of a very considerable treasure He was the dupe of the emperor Maximilian the poorest prince in Europe and gave himself up to the guidance of Cardinal Wolsey  EUGEN  Who was this Wolsey  ERAST  He was the son of a private gentleman was brought up to the church and rose by degrees to be employed as an ambassador to Henry VII When Henry VIII came to the crown he was dean of Lincoln but becoming a favourite with the king and admistering to him in all his pleasures and amours he w  made a privy counsellor lord chancellor archbishop  York bishop of Durham prime minister and through Henry's interest a cardinal and legate to the Pope In short he was grown so powerful that the nobility were jealous and the duke of Buckingham son of him wh  lost his life in the reign of Richard III labouring to oppo  him was charged by Wolsey with hightreason and th  fell a sacrifice to his resentment  EUGEN  But this man I understand fell at last himself  ERAST  He did and I will shew you by and by b  what means but prior to this I must inform you that a  in the last reign the miseries of the people chiefly aros  from the licentiousness of the nobility in this they proceeded from the usurpations of the king yet during th  whole reign there was no rebellion not from the people love for their sovereign but from fear of nonsucces  Henry VIIth's prudence having made such measure doubtful  EUGEN  Had not this king many wives  ERAST  No less than six His first wife was his brother's widow whom he afterwards divorced and two of his  eens he put to death on charges of adultery  EUGEN  Who were these two  ERAST  Anne Bulleyn and Catharine Howard  enry was lost as it were in the embraces of his mistresses ever attended to the complaints of his people and Wol  y who had the sole administration of affairs pursued very measure to keep him ignorant in order to increase  s own authority But an event took place in this reign  at put an end to Wolsey's exorbitant power  EUGEN  What was this  ERAST  That which is know in history by the name  the  Reformation  EUGEN  Shall I trouble you to explain it to me  ERAST  Till the reign of Henry VIIIth the Roman  tholic doctrine was the religion of this country and pro  bly would have continued longer so had not Henry  und the Pope's power inconvenient to him for though  e protestant faith had been preached by Luther in  ermany and seemed to gain ground in that country  t Henry took up the pen in opposition to it and de  nded the errors of the church of Rome to the utmost  his abilities for which work the Pope honoured him  th the title of  Defender of the faith  an appellation con  nued by our kings to the present day But no sooner  d Henry find the Pope averse to his divorcing his first  fe who was the widow of his brother not being able  bring Anne Bulleyn to his wishes without marrying her  an he thought proper to question the Pope's power and  olsey taking part with the pontiff drew on him Henry's  imosity This led the way to the reformation He de  rmined to throw off the Pope's yoke and the parlia  ent cooperating with him a change of faith took place  nd the religion of this country was altered This event  as in  EUGEN  Why was the reformed religion called the  rotestant  ERAST  Because at the diet or assembly of the German  tes at Spires in several  protested  against a decree  of the diet to support the doctrines of the church  Rome  EUGEN  I presume it was this opposition of Wolse  to the king's will that occasioned his downfall  ERAST  It was Henry degraded him from his office  confined him to his country house and deprived him  the greatest part of his property  EUGEN  Could Henry do this of his own accord  ERAST  It was done indeed under the sanction of la  He was charged with introducing bulls from Rome with out the king's consent was tried found guilty and th  parliament confirming the sentence of the courts he wa  sent an exile to his country seat Soon after he was  rested by the king's orders and died in his way to London not without the suspicion of his having poison  himself  EUGEN  What are those  bulls  you mentioned  ERAST  Decrees of the court of Rome so calle  from  bulla  the seal hanging to them  EUGEN  What was Henry's general character  ERAST  That of a cruel tyrant Some sovereig  have been tyrants from contradiction and revolt so  from being misled by favourites and some from a spirt  party but Henry was cruel from disposition alone cr  in his government cruel in religion putting many  death on account of it and cruel in his family yet t  rant as he was he died peaceably a natural death whi  Henry VI the most harmless of all monarchs was de  throned imprisoned an assassinated It is folly to sa  that good or bad actions are their own recompences he  The wicked have their good things in this life the vi  tuous must look for them in another  EUGEN  Was the protestant religion perfectly  delled during the reign of this prince  ERAST  No the alterations in Henry's reign w  rather separations from the Pope than a reformation  religious abuses In the reign of his son Edward VI  errors of Rome became truly reformed This prince  but nine years old when he came to the crown and th  in His uncle the duke of Somerset was ma  protector and the whole administration devolved on him  d his council He was an amiable man and all the  tions of his life were directed by motives of religion  d honour This nobleman in conjunction with Cran  er archbishop of Canterbury undertook to make a  al reformation in religion when Henry VIII only pre  nded to do it  EUGEN  Did the Roman catholics in general submit this reform  ERAST  Far from it There were insurrections in  rious parts of England but the protector who was a  iend to the populace did every thing to redress their  omplaints and thus stopped their fury for a while He was however obliged at last to have recourse to violence  nd the commotions were quelled The nobility however  ok part against him accused the duke of hightreason  e was convicted condemned and lost his head in  EUGEN  How did the young king act in this affair  ERAST  He was too young to enter into it of course as passive He did not however long survive it for  e died in  EUGEN  Who succeeded him  ERAST  It was a custom with monarchs in this age  leave the crown by will Henry VIII in conformity  this practice bequeathed the throne first to Edward  s son by his third wife next to Mary his daughter by  s first wife and after her in case they had no issue to  lizabeth his daughter by his second wife These daugh  rs having been deemed illegitimate by parliament gave  casion to other persons claiming the crown as I will  y and by shew you  EUGEN  Did Edward VI make a will  ERAST  Yes and left the crown to Lady Jane Grey  girl of sixteen daughter of his aunt she being next in  ccession admitting that his sisters Mary and Elizabeth  ere set aside for illegitimacy She accordingly claimed  e crown and had a party to support her but the people in general being in favour of Mary Lady Jane Grey's  rty was overpowered and she and her husband were  eheaded  EUGEN  Was the nation much indebted to Mary  ERAST  Mary now settled on the throne proceeded  like a female fury to reesablish popery throughout th  kingdom and again involved the nation in bloodshed  EUGEN  Was not Mary a great bigot  ERAST  Very much so and her hushand the king  Spain was not less remarkable for his attachment to popery During her reign many protestant bishops among whom was Cranmer and others were burnt because they would not deny their faith  EUGEN  Did Mary proceed in this spirit of perfection from motives of virtue  ERAST  It is allowed she did Her father Henry VIII was a tyrant from vicious principles but the enemies of Mary admit she was one from virtuous principles She had imprisoned her sister Elizabeth from a fear th  she would take part against her Elizabeth being in he  heart a protestant and nothing but Mary's death in prevented that of her sister's  EUGEN  Did she mean then to take away her life  ERAST  It was not absolutely so declared but it wa  universally thought that Mary waited only for some favourable pretext to do it  Elizabeth now ascended the throne amid the acclimations of the people During her confinement she cultivate  her mind and learned the different languages and sciences and commenced her reign with the reestablishment  protestantism and it is to the measures she pursued and the plans she fell upon that this country owe the blessing  of the present established church But whilst she was th  securing peace at home the neighbouring nations France Scotland Spain and the Pope were all combined again  her  EUGEN  Was not her title to the crown disputed  ERAST  Yes by her cousin Mary queen of France and Scotland and this lady's cause was supported by the popish faction but it ended in the fall of Mary for when her husband the king of France died she came over to England where by a breach of hospitality Elizabeth  seized her person kept her confined eighteen years  d then brought her to a sham trial and cut off her head  EUGEN  Did the neighbouring nations disturb the  ign of this queen  ERAST  Very little Elizabeth had a great deal of  t and cunning and contrived by somenting disputes  on the continent and setting the states there at variance  ong each other to divert their attention in a great mea  re from this kingdom Her brotherinlaw Philip II  ng of Spain who would have married her on the death  her sister sent a large fleet to invade this country but  the skill and courage of the admirals and the favour of  ovidence this fleet called the  Spanish armada  was  estroyed The Spaniards are said to have lost ships of  ar and men  EUGEN  Such a blow could not be owing to an en  gement  ERAST  Not wholly so they suffered much before our  ns but more by a storm for the seas and a tempest  ished the destruction a which the English arms begun  EUGEN  How long did Elizabeth reign  ERAST  Forty five years she died in in the  ventieth year of her age but not before the people were  ed of her this is evident from the general joy testified  all ranks at the accession of her successor James VI  Scotland son of that Mary she had put to death  EUGEN  What relation was James to Elizabeth  ERAST  Third cousin James was the son of Mary  d Mary was the granddaughter of Elizabeth's aunt  e sister of Henry VIII Thus were the two countries of England and Scotland united under one monarch  King James came to the throne with the universal appro  ation of all orders of the state for in his person was unit  every claim to the crown that either descent bequest  parliamentary sanction could confer  EUGEN  Did James in no wise resent the putting his other to death  ERAST  He made an attempt to invade England with  army but policy soon induced him to drop it England  ing too powerful at that time However when he came  to the throne he would not wear mourning for Elizabeth nor suffer any one to appear acourt in black  James began his reign by labouring to unite both kingdoms into one but the jealousy of the English put a st  to it for the present lest the offices in the English co  and government should be disposed of to Scotchmen  EUGEN  Were not the kings of Scotland more d  potic than the kings of England  ERAST  Yes and James wished to govern his English subjects in the same way he did his Scotch ones whi  occasioned numberless disputes between the king and  parliament He was for raising money occasionally wit  out the consent of parliament which the parliament  ways opposed and this matter being carried to grea  lengths by this son in the next reign cost Charles I  life as I shall have occasion to explain to you hereafter  EUGEN  Was there not a plot laid in this reign  blow up the parliament with gunpowder  ERAST  There was It was a plot of the Roman  tholics to destroy the king and parliament at one stro  having been refused some indulgencies they requestsâ–ª For this purpose they contrived to stow many barrels gunpowder in the cellars under the parliamentho  which they meant to set fire to when the king and parliament were assembled For this deed of desperation number of persons united and how horrid soever the co  trivance every member seemed faithful and secret in  league every thing was prepared to their wishes and  conspirators expected the day with impatience A  morse however of private friendship saved the kingdo  when all the ties divine and human were too weak  do it One of the conspirators desirous of saving  life of an intimate friend cautioned him ten days bef  the meeting not to attend the house and sent him a my  terious letter for this purpose The letter was no foo  received than the contents of it were communicated to  secretary of state and the king was the first person  unravelled it's meaning Accordingly the cellars we examined the night before the meeting of parliament a  whole plot was discovered The ringleaders were  n after discovered and put to death  EUGEN  Is it not from a daughter of James I that  present royal family sprung  ERAST  It is This daughter was married to the  ctor palatine who soon after became king of Bohemia And this lady was the mother of the princess So  ia mother of George Ist  EUGEN  How long did James I reign over this  gdom  ERAST  Twentytwo years He died in and  is succeeded on the throne by his second son Charles I  eldest son Henry having died before him  EUGEN  This was the prince that was put to death  the people  ERAST  It was For though no monarch ever came  the throne of England with a greater variety of fa  urable occurrences yet as his father had considered the  yal privileges as sacred pledges and defended them to  utmost of his power by words it was Charles's mis  rtune to assert them by action He wanted to govern  people who had for some time learned to be free by  axims and precedents that had their origin in times of  norance and slavery In short he wanted to be despo  and when his parliament was not conformable to his  shes he would immediately dissolve it From small  ides he proceeded to greater and when the parliament  und that the king was disposed to be arbitrary they  ere determined to grant no supplies or raise him any  oney till their grievances were redressed  EUGEN  I have understood he raised money without  e concurrence of his parliament  ERAST  When they would not vote any supplies he  id arbitrary impositions on trade which many refused  pay and extorted money from individuals under a pre  nce of borrowing it for as he had a war to maintain  ith France and Spain large sums of money were continually wanting  EUGEN  And did the parliament raise him no money  ERAST  Sometimes it would and sometimes it wo  not This so embarrassed him that he proceeded gre  lengths to procure it At last the parliament resent  it raised an army in their own defence for there was  standing army at that time and the king raised an ar  likewise This was the beginning of the civil wars th  continued eight years and ended with the execution  the king in  EUGEN  How was that event brought about  ERAST  The parliamentforces were commanded  Oliver Cromwell and the king's forces by himself A  after a variety of battles in different parts of the kin  dom and a deal of blood shed every where Charles w  taken prisoner tried for hightreason against the sta  and beheaded at Whitehall  EUGEN  What became of his family  ERAST  During the civil wars his queen and so  fled to France and were there protected she being  daughter of France  EUGEN  How were matters disposed in Englan  on the death of Charles  ERAST  Oliver Cromwell who was a leading man  the faction was appointed protector of the kingdom  life and the constitution from being monarchical imme+diately became republican which continued all Cron  well's life  DISCOURSE IV  THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED  The Third Period  EUGEN  DID Charles II son of the deceased kin  take no steps to recover his kingdom  ERAST  He came over to Edinburgh was there r  ceived with all the formalities of a crowned head and ha  an army raised in his defence Cromwell however marche  into Scotland and after a little opposition Charles  obliged to fly and escaped his pursuers by disguising  self in the dress of a peasant  EUGEN  How long was it before Charles II was  bred to his succession  ERAST  Not till two years after Richard Cromwell  son of Oliver had succeeded his father as protector of  commonwealth Richard was by no means equal to  father he had nothing active in his disposition had  her talents for business any knowledge of government  any ambition or importance of course it was planned  ng the king's friends to bring him back to the throne  EUGEN  General Monck they say was very instru  ntal to this  ERAST  It was owing chiefly to him He had begun his  tune under the command of Charles I and was taken  soner in his service On the death of his master he  released from a long confinement and had a com  nd under Cromwell His loyalty however prevailed  r every thing and being at the head of Scots  determined to restore the royal family but used every  caution necessary for their safety and his own Being  last commander in chief of all the forces in England  tland and Ireland he marched to London intimidated  parliament and compelled them to a restoration of the  al family This took place in and Monck went Dover and received the young king as he landed  EUGEN  Did Charles II on his coming to the throne  venge the death of his father  ERAST  In some measure he did The bodies of  omwell and some others were taken from their graves  agged to the place of execution and there hung up a  ole day and afterwards buried under the gallows and  t of eighty persons then living and concerned in the  ath of Charles I ten were executed Had Charles II  en an active monarch he might have been an absolute  e for the parliament was all obedience but instead  desiring an ascendency over them he was content to be  humble dependant on their bounty  EUGEN  It was in this king's reign I believe th  the great plague ravaged in London  ERAST  This happened in the year swept  more than of it's inhabitants and was imm  diately followed by a conflagration which burnt f  three days and almost destroyed the whole city but t  spirit of the people soon surmounted these calamities a  London rose more beautiful from it's ruins The city w  supposed to have been fired by the Roman catholics a  the monument in London was erected as memento of th  catastrophe  EUGEN  Was not Charles a man of great gallantry  ERAST  Very much so he kept several mistresses and enobled them all From these have sprung several of o  noble families the dukes of St Alban Grafton an  Richmond As the king was not married and his brother James duke of York was a declared papist the parliament passed a law to exclude him from the throne but notwithstanding this on the death of Charles whi  happened in his brother succeeded him as James II  EUGEN  And without opposition  ERAST  Every opposition seemed to vanish at his accession He made an early declaration in favour of the church of England and thus became popular for the people crushed a rebellion of the duke of Monmouth wh  was a natural son of Charles II and the troubles attending it ended with his excution  EUGEN  What was the duke of Monmouth's plea f  rising  ERAST  He claimed the crown under an idea that th  king was married to his mother but it proved otherwise  EUGEN  James however was not a protestant in his heart  ERAST  No he had married a Roman catholic lady the daughter of the king of Spain had Romish priests abou  him abetted all of that perswasion and received a nuci  or legate from the Eope  EUGEN  And what was the consequence  ERAST  The church of England took the alarm and many great men in England and Scotland applied for re  to William prince of Orange who had married  es's eldest daughter He was a prince of great abili  and a declared enemy of the papists  EUGEN  And what relief did he afford them  ERAST  William being an ambitious prince all his  ons were levelled at power and he no sooner received  invitation to come over to England with an army  in he equipped a fleet sufficient to transport men  mes now saw his errors and would have retracted his  asures in favour of popery but it was too late Wil  m sailed from Holland and landed at Torbay in De  nshire with troops The people joined him  d the nobility who formed the court and council of king  mes left their old master to solicit protection from the  w  EUGEN  How did James act in this case  ERAST  He sought assistance from France and Germany but in vain He was however at the head of  men but when he was told that his favourite  ughter Ann had gone over to the prince of Orange  s spirits sunk and meeting with little encouragement  om his council he thought of nothing but flying to  rance accordingly he sent away his queen and son then  months old and soon after followed himself thus  dicating the crown and leaving his daughter Mary and her husband in possession of it This event is called the  Revolution  and took place in  EUGEN  What became of him afterwards  ERAST  Being arrived in France he found protection here and enjoyed for the remainder of his life the  mpty title of a king and the appellation of a saint  EUGEN  Did he make no attempts to recover his kingdom  ERAST  The French king assisted him with a fleet and some troops to assert his claims and he set sail at Brest  anded at Kinsale in Ireland and was received with open  rms by the catholics in that kingdom but William followed him there gave him battle at the Boyne defeated him and obliged him to fly the kingdom Another attempt was made the next year to send a number of  French troops into England but the French fleet being opposed by an English one and beaten all future

and grandson afterwands made attempts on the crown of England in and as I will shew hereafter but were also repulsed  EUGEN  How was William received on his coming to London  ERAST  With all the congratulations imaginable The people having prescribed to him the terms by which he was to rule offered him the crown jointly with his wife and they were crowned by the titles of William III and Mary king and queen of England  EUGEN  Did William reign after the death of his queen  ERAST  Some few years only for he was naturally of a feeble constitution his death was hastened by fall from his horse in March and he was succeeded by Anne the next daughter of James II She was thirtyeight years old when she began to reign and as the French king thought proper to countenance her brother wh  was called  the Pretender  she waged war with France The duke of Marlborough was her general who was so able and successful as to carry every thing before him He fought a great many battles and gained them all Blenheim Ramilies Oudenarde Lafeet c The manor of Woodstock in Oxfordshire was conferred upon him for his services and Blenheimhouse built for him and now kept up by government  EUGEN  Were there any remarkable things happened in her reign  ERAST  Gibraltar a fort belonging to the Spaniards and deemed impregnable was taken by Sir George Rooke and continues in our possession to this day  And the union between Scotland and England was effected and took place in  EUGEN  I think you told me that these countries  ere united before by James VI of Scotland succeeding to the crown of England  ERAST  I did but this is not the union I mean  efore the two countries were governed by separate parliaments as at present it is with England and Ireland but now the Scotch Peers choose sixteen of

were soon driven back by the king's forces und the duke of Argyl and the Pretender himself who land in Scotland in the interim was obliged to decamp  EUGEN  By this it appears that the crown of England is by no means hereditary  ERAST  It certainly is hereditary but subject to a  terations in that inheritance by the parliament that to say when parliament does not interfere for wise a  politic reasons it then descends to the next heir  EUGEN  The succession I find has often been alter  ERAST  It was altered in Henry IV Henry V  and now again in George I  EUGEN  How long did George I

they are chiefly  within your own memory would be useless I shall  mention to you the loss of our colonies in America  In the year an act was passed here for laying stampduty on the British Colonies of North America which the people there thought an infringement on the privileges as by their charters they claimed a right raising the quota they were obliged to pay towards  support of government in their own way for they  assemblies or parliaments of their own as we have  soon as it was known in North American that this act  passed the whole continent was in a flame and all  stamped paper sent over was burnt as soon as land  When the minister here was informed of this they ga  the matter up and an act was passed to repeal the one th  was so obnoxious and all things were quiet again B  a year or two after the British parliament not being abl  to lay an absolute duty or tax on any commodity sent on to America as this would be raising money on the people without their own consent attempted to affect the same thing in another way for to enable the EastIndia company to pay the state a large annual tribute they allowe  them to export their teas dutyfree The Americans  ware of this contrivance opposed it unanimously burn all the tea there imported and in boarded sever  ships in Boston harbour and threw the cargoes of tea in  the water  This conduct excited so much indignation in the government of England that they proceeded to rigorous measures they blocked up the port of Boston and would  suffer it to have any trade The Americans now combined raised an army and a civil war was the consequence This was continued to the year when it ended  the sovereignty and independence of that country an  was the greatest loss this nation ever sustained  ome BOY learn to be Wise  DISCOURSE I By Way of INTRODUCTION  ERASTUS AND EUGENIUS  ERAST  THIS is just what I wished for an agreeable shade let us sit down Eugenius  profit by it  EUGEN  For my part Sir I am not the least  gued I could walk here from morning to night  hout being weary  ERAST  At your age I should have said the same  s you as old as me you would hold a different language  EUGEN  It is very true but before I reach forty years I have please God a long way to go  ERAST  Alas my child though you should live  enty thirty fifty years that interval which seems  you so considerable will escape you as a fleeting  dow It is very remarkable that the more our  advances the shorter our years seem to be In  ancy weeks appear to be months and months  ars  EUGEN  And why this  ERAST  Because at that time life exempt in embarrassment from care and anxiety is wholly  voted to pleasure but no sooner are we entered in  busy scene of the world than care chagrin and busin  crond in upon us and succeed with so much rapid  that we are scarce sensible of our existence You a  my dear Eugenius in the very springtide of life a  it would be a blessed time if you were thoroughly se  sible in what true happiness consists Man if I m  use the expression goes out of the hands of nat  pure full of innocence and candour peace joy  liveliest and purest pleasures divide his hours He  like a young plant which grows and which wa  only the care of a skilful and industrious hand to bra  it up an ornament to the garden The infant mind  like soft wax to which we may give any kind of fon  The soul at that period free from prejudice fro  vice from those passions that tyrannize over th  greatest part of mankind is susceptable of good  virtuous impressions The mind is a fertile field th  requires only good culture and good seed to make bring forth in due season a plentiful harvest  short can we suppose Eugenius that man wo  ever become so vicious and so wicked if his mind  early formed to virtue  EUGEN  I hope Sir you do not allude to me this for I should be unhappy if you thought me of wicked turn If you will assist me with your advi  probably I may be as good as you can wish  ERAST  That I will with pleasure and if  second my intentions you will one day be not on  pleased with me but with yourself  You are no longer my dear Eugenius in th  infant state of life when man is too weak to listen  the voice of reason you are sixteen years of age time when the mind begins to open and form a judgment of what it sees a time when young men  capable of perceiving and knowing what is to con  tute their wellbeing Could I have the happine  my friend to make you sensible from this moment the value of a good education how estimable m  and of what use knowledge is in the commerce of  you would be enflamed with a desire to learn and know What is it that distinguishes one man from other but his capacity and knowledge Does not  e ignorant man he who has no talent no acquision resemble the brute beast who knows only how  eat to drink and to sleep Whereas he who has understanding and knowledge is distinguished every  here he is useful to himself and to society and is an  onour to human nature Whilst neglect and contempt  er accompanies him who is devoid of merit the man  f understanding has a thousand advantages and is  evered and respected by all who know him  EUGEN  I should be really ashamed to be re  oached with want of understanding  ERAST  Well then my dear let us endeavour  o avoid it Let us apply ourselves with alacrity Charmed with the emulation I discover in you I will  ouble my attention to you I will not consider you  s a boy but as a reasonable young man as my friend Hitherto in our walks we have discoursed of  rifles and a thousand indifferent things that answered  ut little purpose in future our conversations shall be more interesting more instructive and at the same  ime far more agreeable  EUGEN  With all my heart Sir and upon what shall they turn  ERAST  Upon the most useful and more necessary knowledge in the commerce of life that state of life to which you are called Will you not rejoice to know the nature of the world and what is done in it We will turn our thoughts to every thing about us we will study the great book of nature we will contemplate the productions of the Creator and we shall then see throughout the most striking proofs of his power his wisdom and his love to man Do you approve of the plan  EUGEN  Certainly Sir but if it should happen that at any time I should misunderstand you you will excuse the liberty I shall take in asking a further explanation  ERAST  Without doubt You shall ask me wh  you please and I will satisfy you to the best of  knowledge and be assured the more questions you  me the better pleased I shall be But do not imag  I am proposing to you a study or a disquisition  subjects No my friend our conversation shall be real amusement and you will be surprized to fin  that in the course of our evening walks you will  prove fast in knowledge even without pains an  without study I will endeavour however to thro  your thoughts into some order lest want of arrangement should lead you to forget what you hear  DISCOURSE II ON THE NATURE OF MAN AND OF EDUCATION  ERAST  AGREEABLE to our plan my dea  Eugenius let us begin by casting o  eyes upon ourselves and endeavour to know who an  what we are  EUGEN  Is it possible that we can need an enqui  of this kind Are you not Erastus and am I no  Eugenius  ERAST  Such is not the knowledge I allude to I would have you learn at least Femember that you are man  EUGEN  That I am man Do not I know th  already  ERAST  I believe you know it but I am certain that you have thought very little about it and th  you have not yet entered into the distinction between man and other creatures about him By what chan  is it that you and I and all the persons upon earth are what we are  EUGEN  It is not chance that has made us wh  we are but God  ERAST  You are right We owe to God alone  ry advantage that we have and that we are such  ngs as we find ourselves cloathed walking dis  rsing in a word thinking and rational animals  ilst there are upon the earth a prodigious quantity  creatures of a different kind But tell me why are  ey not called man as well as us since they are born  ow and die like us  EUGEN  Because they are not endowed with  ason  ERAST  True It is reason that essentially dis  guishes us from brutes but what is it that dis  guishes man and brutes from all these plants from  is tree for example which lives and grows like us  d like that colt that bounds across the meadow  EUGEN  I know no difference unless it be that I  d that animal utter sounds run jump whereas the  ee neither speaks nor moves  ERAST  But this stone which I touch with my foot equally dumb and immoveable and yet it is neither tree nor a plant Learn then the principal difference between a brute a plant and a stone The brute  es and at the same time has certain senses the plant  es also but has no sense and as to the stone it has  either life nor sense  We have in common with the brutes the natural  nses of the body for example sight smell hear  g tasting and feeling and in general in animals  ey are more delicate than in man The cat has a  etter sight the dog a better scent and the hare a  reater power of hearing The plant has nothing in  ommon with man and brute but life that is to say  egetation The stone has nothing in common with  ther one or the other but the substance or matter of  hich it is composed We are formed from the dust  f the earth and to that dust we shall return  Let us look into ourselves now God alone has made us what we are Were we to examine the  ructure of our bodies we should find that the mi  utest part of us is finely formed to answer the purpose or which it was designed Our whole frame is such an  xquisite piece of mechanism as no human art could  complete Could we see our internal make we should stand much more amazed than we do in examining t  work of a watch and to the curious philosophic ey  we should appear as much more beautiful than we na  rally are as the inside of a watch is more beautiful th  when covered with its cases God having then forme  us as we are had he pleased he could have continue  us in our original nothingness but he thought prope  to draw us forth and place us here upon the earth among milions of objects of which the earth is fu  â–ª He has in short made us man And what is th  human individual Is he not the most noble creat  that has issued from the hand of the Almighty Th  only animal that reasons thinks can reflect upon itself and raise its mind even to the author of its being in a word is he not the monarch of all that exists Have you ever attended to that preeminence of m  over all the other objects of nature Do you comprehend the greatness of your privileges What thi  you of this Eugenius  EUGEN  I am confounded and astonished Sir  what you tell me From this moment only have begun to perceive the remarkable kindness of th  Creator in making me what I am I own till now I never turned my thoughts upon the subject  ERAST  Is it sufficient to be sensible of the to  vantages God has given us Is there nothing owing to the giver of them  EUGEN  Certainly Sir our gratitude and than  are due to him  ERAST  We not only owe him gratitude but a  our love and as we receive every good gift from him to whom should we apply in any of our wants but to him Hence then the necessity of our religious duties it is our duty not only to thank him and to hono  him but also to pray to him In performing this duty we do no more than what is right than what good sense and the sentiments of the heart point out na  were we placed here on earth merely as the brut  to live and die and without any other hope we shou  equally owe a homage to the Divinity for endow in  us with reason and making us so much superior  her animal but when we come to consider the  any acts of kindness our Creator has bestowed upon  we should fail in our duty if we did not give him  all our heart and all our love But is there nothing  e that distinguishes us from brutes  EUGEN  We have a soul that shall never die  ERAST  There lies the preeminence that chiefly  arks the difference between men and brutes and  ery other animal on the face of the earth Our  odies which are merely organized earth will share  e fate of other animals but the more noble part of  s the soul is ordained to live for ever Now why  s God given us this immortal soul How ought it  be attended to You cannot be ignorant of this  ou must remember the many lessons on this subject  ou have been taught in your childhood but I wish to  ow what consequences you draw from the reflection  at though the body be born to die the soul will  ever die  EUGEN  It seems natural to conclude that we  ught to live well since the soul after death will be  ernally happy or unhappy according to our conduct  this life  ERAST  True my friend you enter perfectly  nto my ideas I am charmed to find you compre  end that man is born for an end worthy of himself This is the point I am at Nothing is more impor  ant  ant than to think of one's latter end St Bernard  sed frequently to say to himself "Bernard for what  nd did you come into the world" And surely an  ternity of happiness or misery is no trifling matter He who does not study it is little else than a mad man Yes my dear Eugenius to live as if we were not to die or as if we had nothing after death either  o hope or to fear is the height of blindness it is to forget that we are men it is in short to debase ourselves below the brute creation Under the want of such a thought the state of brutes would be the most preferable for if they have nothing to hope for after death they have nothing to apprehend so that all they do in life is indifferent but man is capable of good and evil and you find that it is not a matter of  indifference to him for if he acts well he will be  warded eternally if ill he will be punished T  the essential business of man during his short stay  earth is reduced to the necessity of living well Th  world is to him merely a place of passage and is  inn in his journey to the next and it is in this ro  through life that he is to take care not to lose his wa  fince if through misfortune he has taken the wro  road he is loft without recovery  EUGEN  Men should therefore be extremely ca  +tious and enquire the right road before they proce  upon their journey and when on it submit to  calamity that may befal them rather than be put o  of their way  ERAST  Admirably said It is instruction al  that can teach man how to proceed that is to say h  he ought to live so as to act conformably to the defi  for which his Creator made him Then how is th  instruction to be acquired but by education My d  Eugenius you have brought me yourself to th  subject on which I designed to talk to you I mean  education of youth and I hope you will attend to its consequences  EUGEN  I certainly conceive that education necessary for without it how can we know what  ought to know  ERAST  True Children are capable of northi  by themselves They know nothing but what oth  take the trouble to teach them of course how gre  a misfortune must it be to want the advantages of ed  +cation Judge by what you see every day How  you find those children whose parents take no  care  EUGEN  Oh Sir they are wicked quarrelson always ready to do evil to ill treat and injure o  another Some will swear and say the worst of thin  â–ª They pay no respect to persons they are disobedie  untractable and slothful They love nothing but run about and play the fool Should they some  in go to church it is only to laugh and make remarks others without attending to the holiness of the pla  and the great majesty of the divinity that dwells the  ERAST  You have given a tolerable good picture those unhappy people but what think you of the rents of such children  EUGEN  I think their parents very culpable and at they will have to answer to God for their neglect their children must in such a case turn out very  d  ERAST  Nothing is more true I deplore the fate those thoughtless parents who have not discharged  is sacred duty They will one day have a terrible account to give Was I a legislator I would impose  e severest penalties on such fathers and mothers who  ave it in their power to instruct their children and yet  mit to do it They are not only the cause of sending broad into the world as many bad members of  ociety as they have children but it is probable that  ose bad children will also neglect the education  f their descendants and from this unfortunate pro  ression a multitude of bad citizens may arise from  he neglect of their ancestors Do you feel the force of this reasoning  EUGEN  Very sensibly  ERAST  An anecdote of antient history will make  ou conceive the advantages of a good education still  etter Lycurgus the Lacedemonian lawgiver de  rous of shewing his people how necessary it is to form  outh early if we would make them useful to the  ate took two little dogs of the same species and  rought them up in a very different manner One he  ndulged in every thing the other he inured to the  hace When age had strengthened their bodies and confirmed them in what they had been accustomed to  e brought them out into a public place in presence of all the citizens whom he had convened together and having set before these two dogs some dressed  ood he turned loose a hare before them One of the two dogs immediately fell to devouring the meat to which he had been accustomed the other set off after the hare which it presently caught All the people applauded his design When Lycurgus addressing the assembly said thus "These two dogs  are of the same species see what a difference edu  tion has made between them"  EUGEN  Lycurgus could not give posterity a m  useful lesson It is astonishing that I should never ha  thought of this Oh Sir if children conceived a  conceive at present the inestimable value of edu  tion they would be more attentive and more wise th  they are  ERAST  Alas Did they but know how well  wish them were they sensible of the many anxio  hours we pass on their account they would be mo  grateful than they are But come I see you are d  posed to listen to instruction and I will do my utmo  to make you acquainted with every thing a young m  ought to know Our first conference shall be a God the author of all things but we will defer the subject till we have more time to spare  DISCOURSE III ON GOD THE CREATION AND FALL OF MAN  ERAST  OF all the truths my dear Eugenius which religion teaches the first and the rest is the knowledge of a Supreme Being th  Author and Creator of all things How do you apprehend I shall prove the existence of this Sovereign Arbiter of Nature  EUGEN  Nothing seems more easy Sir When I see a fine building I say to myself this superb edifice has been erected with great order and regularity An able architect and ingenious workmen have been its contrivers and executors So when I think of the world and all the wonders I behold in that world I naturally cry out certainly these things must have  in the workmanship of an Almighty power and  s power is the God I adore  ERAST  You reason right To be convinced of  e existence of a sovereign Wisdom it is sufficient  open our eyes and look about us If the conside  tions of the heavens and the stars their beauty  eir brightness their regularity and their wonderful  volutions so constant and exact will not convince us  this truth we shall find it strongly imprinted in the  aves and upon the shores of the sea in plants in the  roduction of herbs and fruits in the variety and  stinct of animals in the structure of our bodies and  n the features of our faces In short God having  reated us for himself he has graven in our hearts the  ruth of his existence There is no people nor any  ation even the most savage who have not an idea of a Divinity It is true some pay their homage to objects unworthy of their veneration but it is for want of a more enlightened understanding and a better  nformation  EUGEN  They may have abilities to conceive but no person to direct their conceptions to the right object  ERAST  This is one of the best remarks I have heard upon the subject and convinces me I shall not lose my time and labour in endeavouring to improve you Let us then enquire into the nature of God as far as our capacities will carry us but at best we can have but a very imperfect idea of him and we can know no more of his attributes than he has condescended to discover in the Old and New Testaments which are the writings of inspired authors dictated by God himself and as such are the precious deposites of our faith  Now the attributes are there declared to be that he is  independant  that is that he is selfexistent deriving his existence from no other being that he is  eternal  that is to say that he never had a beginning nor ever will have an end That he is  infinite  by this we mean that he has an unlimited power and possesses all imaginable perfections in a sovereign degree that he is a  pure Spirit  having neither body  figure nor colour of course that he cannot bel  perceived nor touched  EUGEN  Permit me Sir to interrupt you  You say that God has neither body nor figure  then is mention made of his hands and feet Ho  it said that he appeared to the patriarchs  ERAST  Man being limited in his understandi  was the Deity not described to him in terms  which he is acquainted he could have no concept of what is told him It is for this reason that st  terms are made use of and when we are told in  scriptures that God spoke and shewed himself to m  we are to understand that it was an angel only w  descended in the name of the Most High and appear in human form to communicate to men the orders the Supreme Being  Another attribute of the Deity is  immensity  th  is to say he fills all space and is at one and the fa  moment in all parts of the universe confined to no particular spot or place  He is also  immutable  that is not subject to chang  â–ª If it be said in the Scriptures that God is angry  that he repents we are not to understand by thi  passion or change but these so described to us th  we may comprehend them  He knows all both the present the past and th  future nothing is hid from him and he penetrates th  very thoughts of the heart  He is  Almighty  for he would cease to be God i  his power was not immense and absolute  He has drawn from nothing every thing that exis  and that by the sole act of his will "Let there b  Light" said he "and there  was  light"  He preserves all creatures and guards their existence continually for if he ceased to support them they would sink into that nothingness from whence h  first formed them  In short nothing happens in this world without hi  order and permission God then disposes all the event  of the world The smallest action of every creature the least thought of the mind is all regulated by his  ite wisdom And in this administration this go  ment of the universe which seems to us so im  ose but which to him cost far less trouble than  king of the eye to us he had no other object in  than the manifestation of his glory to all created  gs  EUGEN  But Sir of God consulted only his glory  ll that passes here why does he permit for ex  le the many disorders which reign among men  ERAST  He permits evil to draw from it a greater  d If he afflicts good men in this life it is to re  d their virtues in another If he gives the wicked  sitory prosperity he makes use of their malice  er to exercise his justice or his mercy upon his  tures Such is my friend the idea which God given us of himself and of his attributes  EUGEN  What idea have you of angels  ERAST  My idea of angels is that they are spi  al creatures not formed with bodies of course not  ble of being seen perceived or touched for the  re of a spirit is to have neither body form nor  ur And if some angels have appeared to men  mentioned just now by order of the Almighty  have put on an apparent body rather than a  one  ngels were created for eternal life that is never  e to know God as he is and to enjoy him ever  gly They are endowed with a very pure under  ding so as to know what is good with a will well  sed to love and every necessary grace for conti  g in the love of the Creator and enjoying ever  g happiness  any of them however lost themselves by their  Fancying themselves more perfect than God  elf or at least coveting to partake with the Su  e Being the exercise of his almighty power they  to withdraw themselves from his controul The  to punish this audacious sacrilege of their black  titude threw them headlong down into a dreadful  called hell where remorse and despair will for  forment them The rebellious angels are called  Powers of Hell Demons Malicious Spirits  and Angels of Darkness and we have given to o  whom we suppose their chief the name of Satan  EUGEN  Are these demons then confined in he  If so why is it said that the devil "is roaming abo  seeking whom he may devour"  ERAST  These fallen spirits suffer that eternal punishment due to their rebellion but this does  prevent many of them wandering over the earth u  the day of judgment These are constantly end  vouring to draw men into sin that they may ha  companions in their misfortune  EUGEN  But Sir why does God who is infinite  good suffer them to seduce mankind  ERAST  For the same reason that I told you permitted evil that he may draw from it a great good We are to resist the temptations of the de  and he that resists them will have everlasting life  EUGEN  Can you give me a better idea of  Creation than what the Scriptures afford  ERAST  All our information on this head is gath  ed from the Scriptures that historical part written Moses I may possibly help you to form some o  ception of it but the whole can only be imagina  It is supposed that this globe that is the ex  for we can speak only of the planet we inhabit  before the creation a confused mass of matter which we have given the name of Chaos That tho  the Almighty took the space of six days to compl  his purpose he could have given being to every th  at one and the same instant for he had only to wi  to say "Let it be" and it was Having in one created the Light in another the Heavens and Earth in a third the Waters in a fourth the  the Moon and the Stars in a fifth the inhabitance the Air and the Waters that is birds and fishes on the sixth day created every terrestrial animal done desirous of giving the world so formed a ma  and placing upon earth a rational creature who m  partake with the angels before created the h  ness of praising the Lord he made man after his image that is the soul of man in imitation  rational faculties though in a much inferior deg  EUGEN  He was formed we are told of the earth  ERAST  We are to suppose he formed his body of  earth and then breathed into him a living soul  ich is the principle of human life  EUGEN  I have been always given to understand  that the blood is the principle of life for if we  re to take from a man all the blood in his veins he  uld die  ERAST  It is true that such a man could not live  we must not hence conclude that the blood is the  inciple of life it is only the instrument and there a great deal of difference between the principle and  instrument In writing would you say it is the pen  at writes It is the pen certainly that traces the  aracter but it is the hand that directs the pen and  soul that guides the hand In the same manner  soul gives motion to the blood and directs the cir  lation and as this motion and circulation is the  strument of life it follows that the soul which directs  em is the principle  EUGEN  As the soul is so necessary let me know you please its nature  ERAST  The soul is an immortal spirit created  ter the image of God  In the first place it is spiritual that is to say it has  same properties as angels have to have neither  dy figure nor colour of course not to be seen  erceived or touched It is thus reason proves its  irituality  It is in the second place immortal that is to say  ll exist for ever not independant of God but with  permission for as he created the soul he could  ertainly annihilate it  EUGEN  In what manner is the soul and body  ed  ERAST  It is impossible to answer that question  t by conjecture it being one of the mysteries of  ure of which we are at present unacquainted We  e convinced of the union but no one can tell how  ll that experience will permit us to say is that the  ul continues with the body whilst the body preserves  e organs necessary to carry on the different operations  of the soul and that it leaves it when the harmony this wonderful machine is destroyed Then man ce  to be for that which constitutes man properly spe  ing is the union of soul and body  EUGEN  How did God form the soul of the  man  ERAST  The Scriptures teach us that God h  ing formed the body of earth breathed into it  it became a living soul but what is this breath God The expression can only indicate the spiritual of the soul  EUGEN  You will excuse Sir my impertin  questions Curiosity which brought on this gr  subject leads me to it I have but one more to  and that is whether God creates every soul in unit  it with the body or whether the soul of man althou  spiritual and immortal is an emanation of and sprit  from the soul of Adam our first parent  ERAST  Some of the fathers of our church h  refused to decide upon this question but St Jer  â–ª St Ambrose and others have taught that God crea  every soul when he unites it with the body Thi  the general opinion of divines as conformable to b  writ  EUGEN  I have often enquired whethe ani  have souls but could never get a right answer  ERAST  Men are divided upon this subject so  have thought they have but the far greater p  believe the contrary As you have read the B  through and through and are tolerably well inform  in Scripture History give me an account Eugeni  of the creation of the first woman  EUGEN  After God had created man we are t  that the Lord threw Adam into a deep sleep  whilst he slept took from him one of his ribs  which he formed the woman called her Eve and p  sented her to Adam when he awoke and that Ad  at first seeing her cried  This is bone of my b  and flesh of my flesh Therefore shall a man l  his father and mother and cleave unto his  and they shall be one flesh  ERAST  And do not you remark in these words  institution of marriage  EUGEN  Clearly But there is one thing that  barrasses me much in this account It is not said  t God gave a soul to Eve as he did to Adam  ve women therefore no souls  ERAST  It was not necessary that the Scriptures  uld say so God in creating woman designed to  ke her a fit companion for Adam to do this he  ld do no less than endow her as he did the man  h reason and give her a soul with the same proper  s and privileges  EUGEN  How is it then that we see the generality women have less understanding than the men  ERAST  Be cautious how you give into this It certainly true that a great number of women have  t faculties equal to a like number of men but this  ference rises not from the nature of the soul but  m want of equal education and from the delicacy  their frame  The education of girls is very much neglected par  ularly among the better sort of people Instead of  plying to study their time is spent in trifles and  curious idleness which enervates their mind and  akens their bodies And what is the result They  ow what they ought to be ignorant of and are norant of what they ought to know But let us proed on the subject we were upon  After the creation of the man and the woman God  o formed them only to make them happy placed  em in a delightful garden where nature seemed to  ve collected all her riches They were to cultivate  d take care of this terrestrial paradise of which God  ve them the command except of one tree which he  rbad them to touch upon pain of death The cul  vation of this garden whilst man continued innocent  as not a work of labour as the earth produced every  ing spontaneously that is of itself but a sweet and  anquil employ which varied every instant and fur  shed them with motives to adore and praise the  unty of the Creator Blessed with the natural lights  which man is capable we do not trace in Adam  and Eve any of that gross ignorance which obscu  our understanding in the instant of our birth  defect in judgment and reason tarnished the beauty  their minds They were at full liberty to act as the pleased and had a will well disposed to do righ  without any determined inclination to evil God g  them all the assistance all the grace necessary if th  made a proper use of it to procure them eternal life and without which they could not obtain it But  gardless of their interest they sinned  EUGEN  And how  ERAST  I told you that God left them at  liberty to make free with every thing in the garde  but one tree which he called the Tree of knowledge  good and evil because in abstaining from it they woul  have been happy and have known no evil wherea  eating of that tree they became unhappy and consequently by fatal experience became acquainted wi  evil  EUGEN  Was it not an appletree  ERAST  That is of little consequence The wo  which the Scriptures express it by is that which w  translate  apple  though it expressed in general all tree that bore fruit  EUGEN  But why did God lay our first pare  under such a prohibition  ERAST  To give them an opportunity of desen  ing by their obedience the happiness he designe  for them and remark the goodness of the Lord eve  in this prohibition He might have contented himse  with simply forbidding man the use of that dangerou  fruit but no he laid before him the consequences  his disobedience and the misfortunes that would follo  his transgression We read however that in spite  such interdiction the devil in the form of a serpen  tempted Eve to eat and she prevailed with her husban  to do the same  EUGEN  What happened to them after this  ERAST  Guilt stared them immediately in t  face they became instantly sensible of their crim  and God to punish their disobedience told the m  that the earth should henceforth produce thorns a  briers  and that he should eat his bread "in the sweat  his brow" and as to the woman that she should  ng forth children with pain and be under the con  ul of her husband all her life but this was not all  y were from that instant made subject to infirmi  s and death their inclinations got an evil way and  lined them to sin their liberty was abridged and  ey had not the power of doing right with the same  diness as before they lost the command which  od gave them over the brute creation and as they  volted against God so the brutes revolted against  em and they were both disgracefully driven out of  radise without a possibility of returning In short  bject to the empire of Satan heaven for which  ey were created was shut against them and they  erited everlasting damnation  EUGEN  In what part of the world was Paradise  tuated  ERAST  In the Holy Land between the con  ence of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris and their  paration  EUGEN  The punishment however seems to me  rrible and I had almost dared to say excessive  ERAST  You would think differently if you con  dered the infinite greatness of the person offended  esides how easy was the task enjoined It was in the  ord's power to have returned them into that nothing  ess from whence his goodness drew them and as he  id not do it it was a mercy  EUGEN  So far I agree Sir but why should he  ring us all into the world guilty of a crime we never  ommitted Why should he entail the punishment  pon all his posterity  ERAST  I love to hear your reasoning Had Adam  nd Eve obeyed God and by such obedience have  erited the happiness annexed to their fidelity would  ou have asked why their posterity reaped the fruits of  heir deserts  EUGEN  I certainly should not  ERAST  Then why ask why we are born guilty of his crime I will admit there is something incom  rehensible in this transmission of original sin but  man is incomprehensible even without this sin  having however clearly revealed this article of  faith in the Scriptures the church teaches it  it is on this belief that the whole extent of reli  is founded  EUGEN  And why so Sir if you please  ERAST  Because it is this doctrine which supp  the necessity of the incarnation the death the r  rection and ascension of Jesus Christ the baptis  infants and the urgency of prayer repentance  other Christian duties  EUGEN  You will pardon my want of compreh  sion but this does not appear to me very clear  ERAST  I will explain it then Had God trea  man as he deserved he would have abandoned him  his sentence and have doomed him to eternal mis  with the rebellious angels but by an effect of  infinite mercy which ever disarms his justice  wished to draw man from that misery into which  crime had plunged him For this purpose he det  mined to send his only Son into the world to die  and thus satisfy his justice for the sins of man  After having passed sentence on the man a woman for their offence he condemned the serpe  whose form the Devil and assumed to crawl up  its belly all its life and among other things he  a continual enmity between him and man saying  "the posterity of the woman should bruise his head words by which the Almighty announced to morta  the miraculous birth the victory and empire of  Redeemer over sin and Satan To accomplish  promise the Son of God was in after times born of pure Virgin and by his death reconciled us  the Almighty Father and it will be our faults no  if we are not everlastingly happy  EUGEN  You talk now of the Son of God and the Father as there is in reality but one God apprehend it is a mystery that cannot be unravelled  ERAST  It is The Trinity is past our comp  hension but we flatter ourselves it will appear v  clear to us in a future state when we shall see God and know him as he is God in his Holy Scripture  hought proper to declare that Father Son and  Ghost though described as three are only one  ence and equally eternal and if we are not able to  prehend it it is because we have no intelligible  to express it by You may possibly form some  of its from comparison The soul is but one yet it has an understanding that knows a will  determines and a memory that can recollect things Now these three faculties are very diffe  and yet exist in one and the same soul  o the sun is the principle of light and heat both  one and the other are as old as the sun for the  cannot subsist a moment without shining and by  ing it gives both light and heat You see there  that there are things in ourselves and in nature  ld as the principle from which they spring as  ily therefore may we believe that though in  work of our redemption the Father is said to  his Son the Son to obey the Father and the  y Ghost to apply the infinite merits of the Son to  kind yet they are not inferior one to another  that the union between the three is so great  in speaking of one of them it may necessarily  y our meaning to the other two  EUGEN  But if this Redeemer was so necessary  y did not God send him upon the earth immediately  er the fall of the first man  ERAST  Because he would have men learn by the  erience of four thousand years the necessity of  measure  EUGEN  Are all men damned then who were  in before the birth of our Saviour  ERAST  By no means "The Lamb of God says John was sacrificed before the creation of the  rld" that is to say God not only formed the  nal decree of the death and passion of Christ but  took care that the merits of the sacrifice he made  on the cross should reach back to the beginning of  e so that all mankind from Adam until now  ve received the benefits of it All that man had  do before the redemption was to believe in one  God adore and serve him anxiously waiting for  hoping in a future deliverer  EUGEN  I am very desirous of knowing Sir  men began to form themselves into societies an  enter into all the luxuries and indulgences of  â–ª Can you give me any information on this head  ERAST  Though it pleased the Creator to be  upon man every thing that was necessary for existence and he was formed to live upon the nat  productions of the earth yet he endowed him  a thirst for indulgences and without such a th  societies could neither flourish nor exist Witho  desire indeed for indulgences our intellectual fa  ties would be a disadvantage to us we sh  languish away our hours in stupidity occupied  with the momentary want It is the idea only of proving our situation and adding to our happi  that urges us to the trouble of thinking  EUGEN  I apprehend men were first in a saw state and it was a desire of improving this situ  that led them to form societies  ERAST  Exactly so Man originally lived  hunter state and depended upon his bow for daily subsistance so that it required an exten  district of land to maintain a tribe of men for  not a small spot that will maintain a number people who are to live upon wild animals taken  hunting As men therefore grew populous tha  encreased in number they found it necessary to  tivate land in order to procure them food and  cultivation led on to society for when they bec  possessed of property it was necessary to guard  property from encroachments Hence the law  M  m  and  J  m  that is from this time they p  ceeded to defend their property by law And w  they could preserve it they endeavoured to encr  it they built houses furnished those houses  each head of a family became a husbandman  EUGEN  I can readily conceive that by  means a very large stock of provision might be ac  mulated  ERAST  Yes more than enough This ind  numbers to turn their talents to other things Some  loyed themselves in making untesils others in  icating cloaths and sundry necessaries which  gave in exchange for corn and other produc  s of the land It is easy to conceive from hence  societies grew and became flourishing  EUGEN  The method of exchanging property  have been exceedingly inconvenient  ERAST  In large purchases between men of opu  e the inconvenience might not be great but in  ll purchases such exchanges must have been  ublesome It was this that gave rise to the inven  of money which is easily carried and by general  currence is a very good substitute for any kind of  modity we may wish to give in exchange for an  er we are more in want of and that this money  uld never vary it was thought proper to place it  the hands of government and protect it by the  wer of the laws  DISCOURSE IV GENERAL IDEA OF STUDY AND  OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES  EUGEN  I Am delighted Sir with the information you are pleased to give me and  plan of study you have laid down for me and if  knew in what situation of life I should be thrown  to I would request you to give me some directions  my conduct  ERAST  May that happy disposition of your's be  sting God will not fail to assist your intentions in  at is right and honest It is no matter what situa  on of life you are in no man in any situation can  respectable without honour without prudence  d without abilities  EUGEN  A great deal depends upon the ma  of our education  ERAST  True Man is like a tree Look yo  to the banks of that river to the right and lef  can see that those two rows of elms have been u  the direction of different men One row  young has been better trained up than the o  â–ª You may see they are of the same species by the  and the bark and the soil of both is of the f  quality Take notice of this row How  neat and well cut how green and flourishi  â–ª How spreading and majestic There is scarce a  through any of their bodies in short there is fault to be found with them but they afford  greatest prospect of turning out fine timber  your eyes now on the other row see how scrubb  knotty crooked and full of moss and cankers  are Ragged bark yellow leaves with small with  heads Whence now arises the difference in t  two rows of trees if not in the manner in which t  were trained when young One was certainly atte  ed to and the other neglected And there is  doubt but that in time one row will turn out exc  lent timber for building while the other will be  only for the fire  EUGEN  A very striking comparison It bri  to my mind the story you told me of Lycurgus  his dogs and all you have said on the differ  effects of education But is it necessary that all  world should receive all education equally goo  â–ª Should the poor and the working part of mankind educated in the same manner as the rich  ERAST  No that is not necessary Different esta  of men and different faculties should be differen  educated but no person should be deprived of a  gious and a virtuous education Let a man's profe  be ever so low if he is an honest man industrious  a good workman he will be always respectable  the better instructed he has been the more sub  sive obliging and respectful you will see him  he will acquit himself in his work with the m  courage and cleverness In short you will be m  pleased with him than one less instructed and will em  y him in preference Such is the fruit of education  the lower class of people as well as in the upper  EUGEN  I see instances of it every day But pray  l me what is the use of a university education  ERAST  I am very much pleased with this question  was my design to give you a succinct idea of the ob  t of Study and of the Sciences and Arts  EUGEN  What are the liberal Arts  ERAST  We call those arts liberal in contradistinction  working trades which are less honorable and which  quire less talents and less knowledge architecture  ulpture painting engraving and the like are liberal  ts  EUGEN  I have been told that the antients excelled in  chitecture and sculpture Who were these antients  d where did they reside  ERAST  The Grecians who inhabited Greece on  e borders of the Archipelago now in the possession of  e Turks They flourished many years before the  rth of Christ and were renowned for their sculp  re and their architecture Many antiquities or pieces  f antient sculpture have within these few years back  een found buried in the earth in Italy and Greece  here are variet  of figures vases and other things in  e Museum that were dug out of the ruins of Hercula  um a famous city in the neighbourhood of Naples  at was swallowed up by an earthquake in the year  Its ruins were not discovered until w  thin these  orty years  EUGEN  To profess these liberal arts is it necessary  o have an education  ERAST  Not a very finished one but we can certainly discern among the professors of these arts those who have studied and have been better instructed than  thers They require genius and readiness and such as  ossess these talents make a greater progress in their  rofession than others  There are also the sciences which are principal ob  ects of study Indeed without study we cannot ac  uire any knowledge  EUGEN  Pray make me acquainted with the names  the sciences  ERAST  Of all the sciences the most essential i  moral philosophy that is to say the science that teache  us the duties of religion and those of society We live my dear Eugenius but to die Judge then of the importance of morality which teaches us how to live well so that we may die well But there are other sciences still which are not only useful but entertaining We will run through them as you seem to wish it  We will begin with Writing which indeed is rather one of the liberal arts it is truly the art of painting words and of speaking to the eyes and is one of the finest inventions of man To read well is also very useful Good reading is as it were a comment upon the subject it explains it as it goes on Besides to read ill is a mark of want of education and nothing is so vulgar it looks as if we did not understand what we read  A principal perfection in writing is orthography Can you tell me in what this consists  EUGEN  It is to spell the words right  ERAST  It is To write correctly and grammatically to spell the words properly and use right stops is a mark of good sense and a good education It is the first thing we judge by Now the best way to acquire this is to accustom ourselves to copy with attention some pages of a book correctly printed Nothing serves more to mark a gentleman and man of understanding than a proper choice of words This is chiefly acquired by reading but to assist on this subject let me recommend you to a book I have published for the purpose it points out THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WORDS ESTEEMED SYNONIMOUS in the English language and will be found of use to such as wish to speak or write with propriety and elegance  Sold by  R Baldwin  PaternosterRow price three shillings and sixpence  Another knowledge as necessary as writing is Arithmetic without which a tradesman cannot carry on his  business and a gentleman is liable to be cheated every day In arithmetic lies the whole art of calculation There is indeed another method of calculating and a much shorter one I mean Algebra but it is very difficult and but little used  Will you know what is taught at the Universities  EUGEN  I shall be happy to hear but first explain to me the nature of a University  ERAST  A University is a seminary or school for  earned men and such as every wise government thinks right to establish within their dominions Some countries have many some fewer England has two Oxford and Cambridge Scotland has four Edinburgh Glasgow Aberdeen and St Andrews and Ireland has one established at Dublin Each of these Universities consists of one or more colleges with certain endowments Government having granted them charters with certain privileges large sums of money have been given from time to time by well disposed persons to found certain houses or colleges in those  owns In Oxford there are twenty colleges in Cambridge sixteen in Dublin but one Each of these colleges are through noble contributions of the rich in possession of estates sufficient to maintain a certain number of persons called Fellows who live together in society and who employ themselves in educating young men either in law physic or divinity Such as go there for study pay for their education and to encourage persons to send their sons to these places there are certain privileges annexed to those on whom the Universities shall be pleased to confer a degree or mark of distinction A clergyman cannot hold two livings unless he has taken the degree of Master of Arts or Batchelor of Laws in one of our Universities nor can he be made a bishop until he has taken a Doctor's degree so likewise in physic A physician cannot practice as such until he has taken the degree of a Doctor of physic And before these degrees are given the candidates for those honours are examined as to their proficiency in the science they profess  EUGEN  It is a very laudable institution I have heard of Doctors of Music what are they  ERAST  Music and poetry are held there a  sciences and degrees are occasionally given in both The degree of Doctor of Laws is rather an honorary degree and is frequently given to noblemen and other great personages as a compliment There is a  certain discipline observed in the Universities and they govern by laws of their own  EUGEN  What are the chief studies there  ERAST  Besides the general studies of Law Physic and Divinity they give lectures in Algebra Mathematics Astronomy Natural Philosophy Rhetoric and Logic  EUGEN  Will you be kind enough to explain them separately  ERAST  Algebra I have already mentioned  Mathematics is the science which contemplates whatever is capable of being numbered or measured  Astronomy is the study of the heavenly bodies  Natural Philosophy is the science of nature It explains the elements Air Earth Fire and Water and searches into their causes and effects You see how extensive this branch of science is it includes mathematics and mechanics it comprehends all that respects powers or strength extent measures weights and the machines employed in different arts  Rhetoric explains all the figures of beauties of language and serves to give it more energy or more grace it teaches us the difference of style and how to vary it according to the subject matter In short it is the art of oratory whereas Logic is the art of close reasoning  EUGEN  But there are other studies than these  ERAST  Yes many but not taught and the Universities  EUGEN  Will you just name them  ERAST  Besides the living languages such as French Spanish Dutch and so on there are the dead languages Hebrew Greek and Latin called  dead  from not being perfectly spoken any where  Jurisprudence is the science of the laws  Physic Under this head we include Anatomy the structure of the human body Surgery the art of amputation and healing wounds Chemistry or the art of decom  sing bodies proper for the use of medicine or of dividing mixing and purifying different metals Botany or the study of plants and Pharmacy the art of composing medicines  Geography shews the situation of countries and the use of maps  Geometry is the art of measuring  Heraldry is that of knowing the arms of noble families towns and kingdoms  Politics is the science of princes and ministers and indeed is the whole art of government  Fortification is the science of defending towns against the assault of an enemy  Gunnery is the science of artillery teaching the method of using cannon c  Tactics is the science of the army  Navigation that of equipping and conducting vessels upon the sea  The Manage is the science of horsemanship  Agriculture the art of cultivation  Architecture the art of building  Music the science of composing tunes and pieces of music and  The Belles Lettres which is polite literature viz Poetry History c  Economy is the science of adapting our outgoings to our incomes and regulating our domestic expences  Thus I have run concisely through the principal branches of study some of which it is necessary for all men to be acquainted with  EUGEN  What a crowd of arts and sciences to choose from  ERAST  There are others still but I must pass over them in silence You will acquire a knowledge of them as you advance in the world All I aim at now is to give you at least an idea of the utility and extent of studies You see the different arts they lead to I will explain some of them in our future conversation more particularly but I must repeat here and you  will observe it through life that such persons as have received the best principles and who knew how  profit by the instructions that were given them in youth will have infinitely the most honour in the world  DISCOURSE V OF TRADE AND COMMERCE  EUGEN  RETURNING to town Sir I passed by several markets What hurry and bustle  â–ª Nothing but provisions and merchandise buyers and sellers every where  ERAST  Commerce consists in this and to give you a better insight into it we will go into one of these markets Here then we are What a crowdâ–ª Take notice what a number of empty carts and waggons There must have been a great sale of corn to day  EUGEN  Is not that so much the better  ERAST  Certainly  EUGEN  And why  ERAST  You do not know then that wheat is the most essential of all merchandise being the first necessary What would become of the inhabitants of a city if those if the country were to discontinue bringing wheat to market for only six weeks There would  no bread The poor would die with hunger and the rich would be embarrassed with their money they could not eat gold and silver You may judge from this of the benefits we derive from agriculture and know that of all merchandise the necessaries of life an  powerfully interested to encourage the commerce o  corn for the more open and unrestrained that commerc  is the more likely are towns to be populous and flourishing whereas if cities had no corn market the would soon be deserted grass would grow in th  streets and the inhabitants would be more miserable than the villagers themselves but let us go on We shall come presently to the beast market  EUGEN  This is the chicken market I apprehend What a quantity of fowls of all sorts chickens turkies ducks poultry ready for the spit eggs butter cheese fruit and vegetables in abundance  ERAST  Thus are towns supplied with provisions Take notice what a variety of articles we draw from the country How much do we owe to the industry and care of the husbandman who procures us such things as we could not well do without But this sale of provisions even assists those to live who live in the neighbourhood of towns They are all brought to be converted into money  EUGEN  Is it not right that they should profit by the fruit of their labours We ought to be obliged to them even though we pay them for they work for us as well as for themselves But let us pass to the beast market I see a prodigious multitude of horses cows sheep and pigs What a crowd of people there is about them Is it a good thing Sir to have such large markets of cattle  ERAST  Certainly The better a market is served the greater the variety we can then have such cattle as we want and such as please us best Every person here in laying out his money helps the tradesman and artist to live for those who receive money for the provisions they bring to market lay it out again in the same town for the necessaries and conveniences they want  To accommodate the people in all towns is the reason of establishing markets once or twice a week and besides these stated days weekly there are particular markets at certain times of the year called Fairs These fairs are authorised by government and are established for the benefit of the neighbourhood where they are held and for the convenience of selling that merchandise that is produced in the places round about For example some fairs are considerable for the sale of horses others for horned cattle or sheep others for cheese for linens and other things according to the manufactures in the countries where they are held At  Chester there is a great fair annually for Irish linen  brought over there by the manufacturers from Irelandâ–ª These fairs or free markets by the certain privileg  they have by the abundance and great choice of merchandise they furnish and by the concourse of people they bring together animate commerce and occasion a great circulation of money  EUGEN  I have seen wakes in the North of England where there has been nothing bought or sold  ERAST  But wakes are not fairs A wake is annually held on the feast of the dedication of the parish church that is on the day the church was consecrated and on these festivals every housekeeper keeps an open table and welcome every comer All sorts of rural amusements go forward on these days but it is a day of pleasure and not a day of business  EUGEN  Will you stop here much longer  ERAST  No we will go on to the navigable canal  EUGEN  What a number of boats there are there Was the canal made on purpose for them  ERAST  It was A single river which nature alone has formed is not in general so strait nor so convenient for the passage of boats Rivers generally wind a great deal and have a number of shallow places that are difficult to pass besides rivers do not always run from town to town as these canals are made to do Here the banks are made for the purpose of horses to draw the barges along and with wharfs for the convenience of loading and unloading them See how the merchandise is ranged in different places timber firewood bricks paving stones sand coals and other things which are here to be conveyed away in waggons to the places they are going to  EUGEN  Canals then are very beneficial to a town  ERAST  Very much so Towns where there is a port as well as a canal that is where a navigable river joins it flourish very much for such rivers bring a variety of things from the sea and other places out of the reach of a canal and commerce in such a town is much more extended  EUGEN  How is this pray  ERAST  Transporting of merchandise by water is  much less expensive and more convenient than conveying it by land There now is a boat loaded with coals for this town It is brought from the colliery or coal mine twenty leagues from this place and contains fifty ton weight of coals more than forty waggons with four horses each can draw and yet it is drawn upon the water by eight horses of course here is the expence of one hundred and fitytwo horses and thirtyseven men to drive those horses saved for three men are sufficient to conduct this boat and the eight horses that draw it You see now how money is saved of course the seller of the coals can afford to let his customers have them at a much less price than if they were brought all the way by land carriage It is the same with timber with corn and other merchandise conveyed by water so that the carriage if not quite so expeditious is less expensive  EUGEN  I comprehend it very well And p  ay who are at the expence of cutting these canals  ERAST  A certain company of gentlemen Suppose for example one hundred join one thousand pounds apiece that is one hundred thousand pounds this done they apply to parliament for leave to make the canal and when parliament have passed an act for that purpose allowing them to take passeson it they carry their plan into execution So that each of these gentlemen have one hundredth share in such canal and the profit arising from the toll after the expences of keeping the banks c in repair is divided among them in proportion to their shares By which means they get often a large interest for the use of the money so advanced and they can sell their shares at any time Turnpike roads are made by the same means and the toll paid at the gates is the property of the persons who contribute to make the road Before turnpikes were made the roads were impassible no one therefore should grudge a few pence for the convenience of good roads Turnpikes are now made from town to town all over the kingdom and in process of time canals will be as general But if you would see a commercial scene indeed you must go to a seaport  EUGEN  I suppose so  ERAST  You would there see a number of people  all countries and speaking different languages vessel  of various structures and different nations some moore  in the port others coming in others hoisting their sails to go out French vessels English Dutch Swedish Russia Spanish Portuguese c There are vessels tha  carry from fifty tons burthen to six hundred that is t  say large and small that will carry a greater or a le  quantity of merchandise Each ton is twenty hundre  pounds weight In one place upon the stocks are ship  building in others upon the beach ships laying on one side to be repaired Every ship has its sails its cordage its anchors its boats in short every apparatus necessary to navigation Manning a vessel for sea is putting on board a number of men sufficient to navigate her and a pilot to conduct her out of port All these men have p  ticular offices from the captain to the cabin boy There are ships of war and merchant ships The first belong to the state and are employed for the defence of the kingdom and its colonies and for the protection of the merchant ships the latter belong to particular merchants or trading companies such as the East India Company the South Sea Company and others It is with such trading vessels that they run over all the known seas with merchandise and from one part of the globe to another  EUGEN  How is a ship directed upon the sea  ERAST  By her rudder which is a board fixed at the stern or tail of the ship under water upon hinges and moves to the right or to the left if moved to the left by the action of the water against it it will turn the head of the ship to the  ight if moved to the right it turns the ship to the le  This rudder is directed by a handle upon deck which the pilot moves at his pleasure  EUGEN  And how do they know which way to go when ought of fight of land  ERAST  Out at sea they are directed by the compass of which I will give you some day a more particular description It is like the hand of a dial that always turns to the north this is placed before the person who  steers directs the ship and as the ship moves this  and moves and points out whether the vessel is going  ts right course for as it is known in what part of the  ompass the place lies to which the vessel is bound  hat is to say whether the port they are going to be  orth south or so on the compass will always direct  hem to that port by directing the ship so as that the hand shall point north south or to that part of the globe to which it is bound near the coasts they are directed by sea marks trees or steeples planted or  erected on high grounds for the purpose and at night by lighthouses that is towers with fires burning at the top of them  EUGEN  Who are at the expence of these erections  ERAST  Masters of ships  themselves In this country there is a corporation of gentlemen under the name of the Trinity House of which there are thirtyone governors called  Elder Brethren  These gentlemen are authorised by government to collect from every master of a ship a certain toll for the purpose of erecting beacons and landmarks to point out shelves and sand Lighthouses are supported also by a similar toll paid to particular people to support the necessary expences of such lights  EUGEN  When a ship is out of sight of land for many weeks is it possible to know how far they have got upon their voyage  ERAST  Yes They know this by the Longitude and the Latitude  EUGEN  Be pleased to explain them to me  ERAST  The longitude of any place is its distance east or west from the port we sail And to find this out we calculate by the pace or rate that the ship goes at Knowing how far distant the place is to which the ship is going seamen take notice at several periods through the day and night how fast the vessel sails as whether she goes six seven or eight miles an hour more or less This is found by throwing what is called the log line which is a line with a knot at certain distances wound off a reel into the water at the ships side by a minute glass and in proportion as the ship runs from the knots in this line each of which is a mile  they by experience measure its pace which is  down every time the line is thrown and calculated  the end of the day But this is a very uncertain way  findidng it out They are often very much deceived  their reckoning The latitude which is the distance  one place from another north or south they can te  very accurately as I will hereafter explain but th  longitude is what seamen wish to discover and for thi  purpose most nations have promised large rewards to the discoverer It may be known by a watch if on  could be made to keep time regularly without the lea  variation one Harrison invented such a timekeeper and received from government a reward of twenty thousand pounds but this does not quite answer the  purpose it having been found to vary  EUGEN  I am anxious to know how a timekeeper will discover it  ERAST  I will explain that to you at some future time when I give you an account of the earth's motion as you will then better understand it And I will at that time describe the latitude we will therefore resume our subject I was telling you I think that each ship to be equipped for her voyage must have a sufficient number of men on board her to work her in her passage  EUGEN  What are the officers on board a king's ship  ERAST  The officers that rank as gentlemen are the captain the lieutenants and the midshipmen the chaplain the surgeon and the surgeon's mate A young man must be a midshipman six years before he can be made a lieutenant and must undergo an examination before the Admiralty as to his proficiency in his profession  EUGEN  Does six years service entitle a man toi a lieutenancy  ERAST  No some that have not interest to be appointed lieutenants have continued midshipmen all their lives  EUGEN  Are there more than one lieutenant to a ship  ERAST  According to the size of the ship a first and secondrate ship have six lieutenants each a third  rate five lieutenants a fourth or fifth rate three each  nd every other vessel one  EUGEN  What are the several ranks of navy officers  nd their pay  ERAST  An admiral and commander in chief has  ve pounds a day an admiral three pounds ten shillings  vice admiral two pounds ten shillings a rear admiral  ne pound fifteen shillings captains according to the  ize of the ships from one pound fifteen shillings per day  ach to eight shillings master and commander eight  hillings lieutenants some five some four shillings and  idshipmen the pay only of a common man four or  ive pounds a month the chaplain nineteen shillings a  onth and four pence a month from each man's pay  he surgeon five pounds a month and two pence a  onth from each man's pay The other men are paid different salaries according to their offices  hese officers have some other perquisites besides a share  f the prizes or ships they take from the enemy in time  f war  EUGEN  Are there not some land forces always on  oard ships of war  ERAST  Marines who have nothing to do with working the ship their duty is merely to defend it in war and attack the enemy when the ship is fighting There is generally a company on board each ship about  orty in number under a captain and two lieutenants And there are seventy companies of marines in the whole  EUGEN  Are the officers of the navy as much  esteemed as those of the army  ERAST  Equally so and they rank before the army  hat is to say a captain of a ship ranks with a lieutenant  olonel in the army and a lieutenant of a man of war  anks with a captain  EUGEN  Are there any officers in the marines higher  han a captain  ERAST  Yes but not so many in number There  re but three divisions or regiments of marines each of  hich has two or more majors from two to four lieute  ant colonels one or two colonel commandants and a  olonel There is also a lieutenantgeneral and a gene  al of marines  EUGEN  Is there any provision made for tho  unfortunate seamen who are wounded in the service  ERAST  Yes besides a sum of money given to each in proportion to his wound called  smartmoney  there an  two charitable institutions for this purpose the chest a  Chatham and Greenwich hospital  The Chest at Chatham gives gratuities for wounds and small annual pensions to such as have been wounded in proportion to what they have suffered  Greenwich Hospital receives such seamen as by age wounds and other accidents are disabled from furthe  service and provides for the widows and children  such as are slain In this hospital are generally tw  thousand three hundred men one hundred and fifty boys and one hundred and forty women as nurses to the sick They are lodged cloathed and fed for life and have each something allowed for pocketmoney They boys are taken in at eleven years of age and go our at sixteen either to sea or trade This hospital is supported by government and by sixpence a month pai  out of every seaman's wages  EUGEN  A very comfortable provision truly Be kind enough to give me an account of some of the trading companies you mentioned  ERAST  If I explain one you will understand the whole I will then give you some idea of the EastIndia Company  The East India Company is a number of people in partnership together for the purpose of trading to the East Indies Government has granted them a charter for that purpose on their paying the public four or five hundred thousand pounds a year so that you see how large their gains are The Company's stock of money with which they carry on their trade consist  of many millions and their profits are such that after paying all expences and losses that occur in this joint trade they get about twelve per cent for the money they employ This partnership is open and free to every one that will join them There are every day persons to be found that will sell a share of this great concern A five hundred pounds share will entitle a person to a voice or vote in  the concerns of the Company which is principally con  ucted by thirteen directors chosen annually out of the  artners or proprietors This Company since their  irst establishment have driven the natives of Bengal  to the back part of the country and are now possessed  f a great extent of territory and they keep an army or the defence of it The South Sea Company the  ussian Company the Hudson's Bay Company and the  frican are much upon the same plan though not so  ich nor trading with so large a stock The value of each share or which is the same of each one hundred  ounds stock rises and falls in proportion to the imaginary state of the Company  EUGEN  New you mention stock I could wish to have the nature of government stock explained  ERAST  I must first tell you that persons who have money to spare can by lending it to those who want  it have five pounds annually for the use of every hundred pounds but no more as five per cent is the legal interest allowed by law but as the security such persons generally give for the return of the principal sum lent is not considered so good as government security government when in credit can borrow money at less interest than five per cent When government has established a tax to pay the interest of the money they wish to borrow they call upon the public to lend them the money upon the faith and credit of the nation When this sum of money is advanced it is called  Stock  and government every half year pays the interest of this stock to the persons possessed of it Now suppose I lend government one hundred pounds and wish some time afterwards to have it again under an idea that government will never be able to repay me the principal I cannot get this money back from the state but I offer my one hundred pounds stock to you You tell me the state may be a bankrupt for any thing that is known to the contrary and then it will not be worth one shilling however if I chuse to sell it you will give me sixty pounds for it which I agree to take It is on this account that the stocks rise and fall every day according to the number of buyers or sellers in the stock market A piece of bad news will frighten people and  occasion many sellers and few buyers of course  lower the value of stock and a piece of good news  on the contrary occasion many buyers and few selle  of course raise the price of stock The stocks of  trading companies rise and fall in proportion wi  government stock As the interest of money in  stock keeps pace with the interest in another Th  stock is called the  public funds  EUGEN  Is the sinking fund a fund of the sam  kind  ERAST  No government always takes care  establishing new taxes to answer every contingent  pence of the state and  generally contrive that th  taxes and other revenues of the crown shall exceed th  public expenditure or outgoings so as to leave a surp  of gain every year This surplus or saving is tr  sured up for the purpose of paying off at some futu  time a part of the money they have before borrowe  and the money or stock so saved or treasured up  called the  sinking  fund the design of it being to sink  lessen the public debt  EUGEN  And do they often pay off the debts the  owe  ERAST  They will now and then pay off a few mi  lions by means of the money so saved but they wi  never be able to pay off the whole for owing to wa  and a variety of unforeseen expences the national debt amounts now to upwards of two hundred an  twenty millions of pounds so that government ha  enough to do to find money to pay the interest of tha  debt which interest at three per cent amounts annually to seven millions It is this enormous debt that ha  injured the credit of the nation for people begin  think now that some time hence so far from paying o  the principal they will not be able to pay the interest and it is under this idea that one hundred pounds stock will not sell for sixty pounds  EUGEN  How long has this great debt been growing  ERAST  Not a hundred years  EUGEN  What Sir are the navy bills  ERAST  When the commissioners of the navy pu  chase any naval stores or employ any shipping to tran  port  provisions troops c to distant parts they pay  these things in papermoney that is to say they  e the seller an order upon the treasurer of the navy  so much money which order specifies that if the  is not paid in six months the holder of such bill shall  ve four per cent interest on the sum due until it be  id These bills are generally sold but at a disadvan  ge one hundred pounds will scarce sell for more than  ety pounds But let us return to the subject we were  on  EUGEN  I should like to take a voyage in one of  ose great ships  ERAST  Nothing would be more interesting or  ely The sea is like a chain that unites all parts  the globe together Without navigation commerce  uld not exist or at least could not flourish Every  e would find himself limited to the productions of his  n country We should be deprived of that infinite  sistance we receive from foreigners and could not  eld them any Besides the sea trains up a pro  gious quantity of seamen which in time of war are  r principal defence A great number are also em  oyed in our fisheries which is a further nursery for  amen  EUGEN  A seafaring life must however be attended  ith great dangers Do not they dread storms and  ipwreck  ERAST  The sea has undoubtedly its dangers but  the land exempt from them Are we not every day  posed to a thousand accidents Without the aid of an  powerful hand who could protect us It is a consi  ence in God that leads seamen to brave the tempest  e shallows the sandbanks the currents the gulfs the  irates or robbers on the sea and all the dangers of the  eep God preserves mariners as he does other men  nd in fact we hear of very few perishing in propor  on to the great numbers that follow a seafaring life  ut one in a thousand If there was they would not  e so ready as they are to embark The sea is as it  ere their natural element They are not happy on  ore Besides the great sums of money they gain at  sea is an object and they deserve all they get for  risks they run  EUGEN  A whirlpool they say is a danger  thing what is the nature of it  ERAST  It resembles a whirlwind in the air as  one is a circular current of air that sweeps things off  ground and takes them up aloft with it a whirpool  circular current in some parts of the sea that will dra  vessel or any other thing within its reach to the centre  middle of such whirling current and there suck it in  sink it so as perhaps to rise no more It is suppo  to be caused by a hole or cavern at the bottom of the  beneath it by which the waters are conveyed throu  a subterraneous passage to some other part This  duces the same effect as appears in the top of a fu  when its contents are running into a bottle beneath  a hole in the centre of the fluid and a strong sucti  downwards  EUGEN  I conceive many curious things are  with in long voyages  ERAST  Many The seas are immense and  whole globe may be traversed by means of navigati  The most powerful European nations are the Engli  â–ª the Dutch the French the Spaniards and the Por  guese These have possessions beyond the seas Isla  have been discovered by subjects of European princ  and some of them continue under their dominions  this day They have colonized them that is they ha  peopled them by sending inhabitants there from th  own countries The vast tract of America was peop  chiefly by this country and was under English gove  ment until within these few years  EUGEN  Were these places uninhabited that we  thus colonized  ERAST  No They were inhabited but by na  savages These the people who landed there drove ba  into the interior parts of the country and when th  had built a town they defended it from the incursio  of the natives  EUGEN  But can this violent seizure of land reconciled with justice  ERAST  Certainly All territory was originally  qui  red by conquest This gave rise to the several states  on the earth And when a number of people come  d form a settlement upon a tract of land which the  tives have no other claim on than an unrestrained  erty of ranging it for food it such settlers put them the way of living more comfortably and gratify them  th a thousand indulgences which otherwise they  uld never have heard of instead of having reason to  mplain they would in my opinion have cause to  ess themselves at the fortunate event  It is to these distant parts then and to the different  ctions of the world that Europeans transport merchan  se the growth of their respective countries bringing  ck in exchange wealth of every kind gold silver  ecious stones skins cottons sugar tea coffee cocoa  chineal indigo pepper cinnamon tobacco and any other things which we have We trade to the  ast of Guinea for negroes that is for black slaves  d carry them to the plantations abroad where they are  ld and employed in agriculture and where inhumanity  eats them little better than brutes In sailing to these  imates we see remarkable things and the different pro  ctions of the countries We become acquainted with  eir manners their customs their religion and form of  overnment in short we acquire an infinity of know  dge no less useful than curious But let us return to  ommerce by land  Merchants seldom go to sea themselves they transact  the business at home and ships convey their merchan  ise out and home Was you in the countinghouse of capital merchant you would be astonished to see that  ithout going out of that room they transact business in  ll parts of the world Some employ the ships of others  thers have ships of their own Commerce in its utmost  xtent is a prodigious thing You may judge of its  xtent by the postage of letters which merchants annually  ay There are houses in London that is merchants whose letters cost them upwards of six or seven hundred  ounds a year and who will return more than seven or  ight hundred thousand pounds annually I mean do business to that amount Merchandise carried out of  England to foreign parts are called Exports  brought in Imports  EUGEN  Exclusive then of the imports what  principal branch of our commerce  ERAST  Manufactures are the most considerable of English commerce and the manufacture of woo  cloths the principal To encourage it government  obliged every person to be buried in a woolen  under the penalty of five pounds But besides branch of commerce we have a manufactory of established in SpiralFields London of cottons vel  muslins and a variety of other linens painted and  at Manchester of ribbands at Coventry of stocki  at Nottingham and other places of glass at Newca  and of hardware of all sorts at Birmingham Sheff  and Leeds whereas Scotland and Ireland are ch  distinguished for linen As France and Spain are  nowned for their wines England is remarked for its  of which almost every county boasts of taking lead  EUGEN  I presume the great towns generally away with the principal part of commerce  ERAST  Pretty much so Where there is the adv  tage of a good sea port there is much business can on at least to foreign parts for example at Lond  Bristol and Liverpool but the manufactures are chi  established in cheap countries and such as are wro  by fire in places abounding with coals  EUGEN  What is the difference between a whole and a retail business  ERAST  A wholesale dealer is usually a merchan  a manufacturer and sells only to those who sell ag  of course deals out his goods in large quantities an  contented with smaller gains whereas a retail tra  parcels out his goods to the consumer and in such so quantities as he may have occasion for  EUGEN  Which is the most profitable then a wh  sale business or a retail one  ERAST  A wholesale business is generally the  lucrative for though wholesale dealers get less p  upon every hundred pounds worth of goods they  yet as their returns in trade are very large and th  dealings very considerable they are generally large  ers upon the whole but they are at the same time  osed to greater losses and such a trade requires a  e sum of money to carry it on But a retail trader  has a great deal of business and many customers  in common a great deal of money and often  re than many wholesale dealers because he has a  ater profit and his money is quicker returned not  ng obliged to give so long credit nor risk such large  s We have seen retail traders get very great  tunes but not generally in small towns for where  re are but few inhabitants and many shopkeepers  trade is too much divided to admit of large gains  EUGEN  It is owing to great losses I apprehend that  see so many bankrupts  ERAST  Every situation of life my good friend has disgraces you will be better acquainted with this as  advance in life The risk of loss I confess is a disa  eable thing in trade When a man cannot pay his  ts he is liable to be arrested and sent to prison and  en once he is supposed to be deficient in this respect  his creditors fearful of losing their money apply to  m for it this frequently occasions him to secrete him  f and shut up his shop Such a man is then said to  l or be a bankrupt for his creditors then seize upon  he has and divide his property among them in pro  rtion to the several sums he owes Sometimes the  editors will get half their demands sometimes a fourth  rt and sometimes not so much but if on examining his  counts it appears that he has acted fairly they  stomarily give him a general discharge which is called  ning his certifitate  and suffer him to begin trade again  he can unmolested  EUGEN  The accidental burning of a tradesman's  atehouse or the loss of a ship load of goods at sea may  in the fairest dealer unexpectedly  ERAST  There are precautions against such unforesseen  sses In London there are assuranceoffices that for  small annual premium will insure any man's property  om loss by fire or the dangers of the sea These con  of a number of opulent men whose fortunes are  sponsible and adequate for any sums they insure  tradesmen can have their houses and goods insured three or four shillings in the hundred pounds  is on paying three of four shillings a year for e  hundred pounds they think proper to insure should fire accidentally destroy their property these offices  make good their losses as far as the hundred pou  they have insured and they may insure to any among  In like manner may ships be insured during the voy  they are about to make and that for about three or fo  pounds in the hundred pounds The persons w  do this are called  underwriters  Nay these assuranc  offices will go further they will insure any man's  for a sum of money in proportion to his age and  chance there is of his dying Suppose a man was to gi  one thousand pounds for one hundred pounds per ann  for his life that his family may not lose the benefit  the money so laid out he can by paying to some of the offices twenty thirty or forty pounds a year more  less out of the one hundred pounds leave the thousand poun  at his death to whom he pleases for die whe  he will these offices will pay the money  EUGEN  Are they not often sufferers on this a  count  ERAST  No When it is considered how many persons property they insure the chance is much in the favor of course their losses are not so great as to ma  them losers in the whole for they make their calcu  tions so that the premiums or rewards they receive for insuring are more than sufficient to make good every lo  they are likely to sustain  EUGEN  Where a man can insure his property  this manner it is unpardonable in him to fail as it mu  be owing to some neglect or inattention of his own  ERAST  It is too frequently so Men too often wi  to get rich on a sudden they therefore undertake mo  business and risk more money than their fortunes will enable them to do and to do this they run in debt for a variety of articles which perhaps afterwards they cannot sell Sometimes they will pay too little attention to their accounts and from an ignorance of their situation will spend every year more than they ca  afford Some men again will break fraudulently that  will take up goods upon credit abuse the confidence  men put in them and spend the money such goods  for in extravagant living to the injury and often the  of those who trust them  EUGEN  Was I a tradesman I could easily find a  hod not to lose any thing by bankrupts  ERAST  If you would teach that method to others  would do them a great service What method  ld you take  EUGEN  I would trade only for ready money then  ould lose nothing  ERAST  Was every one to do so he could not lose  that is impracticable Credit is the very soul of  de which could not subsist without it There is no  aler's fortune so large but that he carries on more  de than he can immediately pay for of course he obliged to have credit Many a man deals largely on credit without any real fortune of his own besides often happens that a man would not know what to  y for goods when he buys The seller may not be able  mediately to ascertain their value and the buyer may  have had an opportunity to inspect the quality of the  ods bought or they may be purchased at a conside  ble distance from the buyer perhaps in the country at a seaport In which cases the money is afterwards be remitted or conveyed to the seller Do you know  e nature of papermoney  EUGEN  Indeed I do not  ERAST  You know the nature of a bank note which a written promise of the governors of the Bank of  gland to pay a certain sum there specified when  ed for This was contrived for the convenience of  de it not being troublesome to carry and can be  nveyed by the post in a letter For the same purpose  en in business instead of paying money for goods will  quently give promissory notes of hand to pay the  oney in one two three or four months more or less in  rds to this effect "Three months after date I pro  ise to pay to Mr or his order the sum of  lue received" These notes are negotiable that is  ll pass current from one to another the whole three  onths they have to run when the possessor of the bill  when payable carries it to the house of the person  first gave the note for payment  EUGEN  And suppose he will not pay it  ERAST  He then loses his credit and the hold of the note obliges him to pay it by law with all  expences attending the recovery  EUGEN  And what is a bill of exchange  ERAST  This is contrivance to pay money in a  distant part Here is a merchant in London  example that trades with a merchant at Amsterd  â–ª Suppose A wants to pay one hundred pounds to B  friend in Amsterdam A applies to this merchant London pays the hundred pounds to him and begs  to remit it to Amsterdam he accordingly gives A a  of exchange or draft upon his correspondent there words to this effect "At sight pay to A or his ord  one hundred pounds and place it to the account yours c" At then puts his name upon the back of  bill which is called  indorsing  it and sends it to  friends B by the post This indorsement intimates to  merchant a Amsterdam when brought to him for p  ment that A has authorised it and the money is imm  diately paid By this means too the merchant at A  sterdam conveys one hundred pounds to the merchant London so that it is a convenience on all sides T  is called a  foreign  bill of exchange when such bills  between traders in the same country they are call  inland  bills  EUGEN  From your account of trade it  busy pleasant life and  grow rich    ERAST  It is perhaps the readiest road to acqui  competency and without being obliged to any  â–ª Say what you will of trade it must be honourable at is pleasant to owe our bread to no one but oneself could mention twenty examples of very rapid form made in trade from very small beginnings  EUGEN  What is the best kind of commerce to deal in  ERAST  That depends upon opinion and talents  as I to choose a trade it should be where the articles  e and fall considerably in price  EUGEN  And for what reason  ERAST  Because a clever sensible man who knows  profession may make his fortune suddenly in such a  de For example I would buy but small quantity of  h an article when it was dear because if it fell in its  ce I should then lose but little but when it was cap I would lay out all the money I could and keep  ill it was dearer and by felling it then I might per  get treble the sum I paid for it especially if the  rchandise I bought would keep This is what trades  call speculation buying on foresight Sometimes a  son has been injured by this scheming for no one  answer for events but not very often  But it is time to think of returning home  EUGEN  We are just got to the banks of the river  hat a quantity of boats What a bustle on the quay  me loading and others unloading From whence  ne these sawn planks  ERAST  They are fir planks or deal and come from  lland The Dutch bring them from Denmark and  er northern countries Probably some of these larger  els are laden with wool from Spain Further are ves  laden with cod from Newfoundland herrings from  etland oranges and lemons from Spain sugar and rum  m Jamaica silk from Turkey rice from Carolina  s from Canada brandy from Flanders claret and  gundy from France and portwine from Portugal  is my dear Eugenius the train and chain of  mmerce one may say it is an immense and perpetual  eam which flows from city to city from kingdom to kingdom and from one end of the world to the other  u see from its giving employment and maintenance to  usands how great an object it is to a kingdom and  ides this there is not an article that does not pay some  siderable duty or tribute to the state It is an exten  commerce joined to good husbandry that has  dered England so numerous so rich and so flourish  DISCOURSE VI ON THE OBJECTS OF NATURE  EUGEN  IT is now three weeks Sir since we pa  visit to our friends in the country a  from that time we have not been a day out of the city I long to be there again This fine weather is a  tation Winter will soon shut us up within our walls  ERAST  The weather these fifteen days past  been too cool for a country excursion but as it  seems fine we will profit by it we will go an see  the corn looks after so much rain for when it is cut good deal of rain will make it shoot  EUGEN  And when the wheat shoots is it not so goo  ERAST  No It loses in its weight of course it d  not produce so great a quantity of flour besides  flour from such wheat is not of so good a quality It the same with oats and other grain with which we f  cattle If it is injured by too much wet it is not nourishing nor will it keep so long as if got in in a  season  EUGEN  This is one reason then that we dr  continual rains and stormy tempestuous weather it does a great deal of damage But whence arise th  effects Why does God permit it What is the ca  of the variation of the seasons What is the use of  stars above us You see Sir I am not ashamed of  ignorance There are a thousand things in nature  I do not comprehend If you remember you once p  mised to explain them to me shall I request you to it now  ERAST  With pleasure I admire your curios  â–ª It is certainly pleasing to inquire into the works of  ture You have opened to me a wonderfull scen  things and to the best of my abilities I will give an insight into them  To make you acquainted with natural history  must proceed with a degree of order Let us first  back to the origin of the world I do not mean the history of the creation that you have a knowledge of already all that is necessary to remember now is that Moses the author of that history was not deceived having received his intelligence from God himself with whom he conversed face to face All that God thought proper to communicate to Moses and the prophets by inspiration we call  Revelation  His holy Spirit enlightened their minds and taught them such things as they wished to know and to teach to others so that men who would speak of the origin of the world without an attention to revelation let them be as wise as they may can only set forth false systems which destroy one another and are little else than dreams of the imagination whereas by the recital of Moses so simple and at the same time so sublime the formation of the universe unfolds itself to us in a very satisfactory manner We will contemplate then to day the works of the Lord the sole author and preserver of nature And we will first turn our thoughts to the heavens which declare his power and his glory What other hand what other force than his could support in the infinite expanse above those great globes which we fee What other wisdom could regulate their course and preserve that regularity with which they have rolled in that immense space for six thousand years  EUGEN  It is a spectacle truly worthy of the greatness of God Of all the havenly bodies the sun seems the finest and the most striking  ERAST  It does It is on this account that many  idolatrous nations dazzled with the brilliancy of its  ays and amazed at the influence of its heat on the productions of nature take it for a God and adore it There was a famous temple at Heliopolis dedicated to the worship of the sun Many who have not received the benefit of revelation to whom the gospel is unknown remain at this day in that deplorable ignorance  EUGEN  Shall I trouble you Sir to explain the nature of the sun moon and stars I am ashamed to know  o little concerning them  ERAST  It would be useless to you to give you an account  of the different systems which celebrated  have invented for the structure of the heavens I will only inform you of that which is now universally admitted It is the system of Copernicus a native of Thorn in Prussia improved by Sir Isaac Newton of England  Except the sun and moon we in general call all those celestial globes stars which we see scattered up and down in the immensity of the heavens many of them are luminous bodies that is to say give light of themselves but there are some that are not luminous but opake and give light only by reflection from the sun  that is to say the sun shines upon them and they throw back his light in the same manner as we see the windows of a house frequently do towards the evening when the sun is setting Of this latter kind is the moon and the planets  EUGEN  I wish Sir you would begin with the sun  ERAST  I ought indeed the sun being apparently a  a torch to the universe or the principle of all lightâ–ª Would you believe it Eugenius that there are a prod  +gious quantity of suns  EUGEN  How a quantity And do we see more tha  one now  ERAST  No But in the night we discern stars in numerable and philosophers assert that they are a  suns probably larger than the one that gives us light i  the day If so at what an enormous distance from th  earth must these suns be placed for the farther off a  object is the smaller it appears and if we look at th  stars through a telescope which brings them some mi  +lions of miles nearer to the eye they do not app  larger Let us suppose a bullet shot from a cannon  wards the nearest star and to go at the rate of mi  an hour it would be years in going the  â–ª The stars are fixed that is they occupy constantly  same space in the firmament They have no moti  but a rotatory one like a wheel round its axle We  lieve them from their twinkling to be of the same  ture with the sun  EUGEN  If the stars are fixed what are those wh  we observe occasionally to shoot and fall  ERAST  This is one of those optic illusions that de  eive our eyes The falling star as you call it is no other than a meteor resembling a star and at no very great distance from us it is formed from certain exhalations that rise in the air suddenly take fire and soon  isappear and is of a similar kind with what is called  n  ignus fatuus  or a  will o' the wisp  EUGEN  I have heard frequently of that but never  ighly understood it  ERAST  That also is a meteor formed of a like matter and is chiefly seen at night in marshy places The country people call it  jack in the lanthorn  and suppose it misleads the traveller frequently into those bogs over which it hovers  EUGEN  A childish tale I suppose There is another  minous appearance I have noticed I believe it is  alled the northern lights  ERAST  Yes the Aurora Borealis or northern dawn  an extraordinary meteor a luminous appearance  ewing itself in the nighttime in the northern part of the  eavens it appears commonly in the form of an arch  iefly in spring and autumn after a dry year but ge  erally transparent so as to see through it Many have  tempted to account for it but in vain it is however  lowed to be a kind of electric fire issuing from the air  are those faint streams of light that frequently flash  the heavens at night and which are called Lights in  e air  EUGEN  Of what nature Sir is the sun  ERAST  An immense ocean of fluid fire which never  nsumes We suppose the sun to be a globe because his round and to be fire because it gives light and  at as fire does we suppose it fluid like water because spots are observed on it that change their situation  d shape These spots are thought to be bodies diffe  nt from the nature of the sun floating in its sub  ce and thrown upon its surface like the scum upon  ing oil With respect to the size of this globe of  it is according to the calculation of philosophers but a million of times as large as that of the earth  Conceive now an immense round space of the hea  s almost infinite in the centre of which the Creator  has placed the sun There it is fixed except that it rolls continually like a wheel round its axis with an inconceivable swiftness but which on account of its enormous size it is twentyfive days and a half in doing and notwithstanding this as its circumference is miles it must turn at the rate of miles a day to perform its revolution in that time To give you an idea of the distance of the sun from us which according to allowed calculations is of miles off were we to travel to the sun and at the rate of miles a day we should be years in going  In this immense space where the sun is fixed there are certain planets that at different distances revolve or roll in circles round him  EUGEN  What are these planets  ERAST  There are six of the first order their name  are  Mercury Venus  the  Earth Mars Jupiter  and  Saturn  They all move round the sun one way from west to east Mercury makes its revolution round th  sun in about three months Venus in seven the Earth in twelve which is one year Mars in two years Jupiter in twelve and Saturn in thirty years These planets are opake sold globes like the earth and giv  light as I told you by reflection from the sun They may be known from the stars by their never twinkling  These planets have also a rotatory motion round the own axes as a wheel turns round its axle which revolution they perform in certain stated times For example the earth while it employs a year in making its revolution round the sun turns round its own axis ever  twentyfour hours and that from west to east I sha  not mention the times the five other planets take in pe  +forming their revolutions as I would not burthen you memory with unnecessary things  EUGEN  Are there no more than these six planetsâ–ª  ERAST  There are ten others of a second orde  which are called Satellites These attend upon th  respective planets The earth has one called the  moon  Jupiter has four and Saturn five that is to say Jupiter has four moon revolving round it and Saturn five d  ing the time they themselves revolve round the sun  EUGEN  Pray Sir what is a Comet  ERAST  A Comet is a kind of planet vulgarly called a  lazing star from its having a fiery tail It is distin  uished by a long train or trail of light in a direction  pposite to the sun We are not certain how many there  re we know only that they describe a prodigious  ngthened circuit round the sun which makes them appear at certain stated times once in a number of years  eventy or eighty Comets when viewed through a  lescope have a most awful appearance being large  obular bodies with long blazing tails and something  ke fiery darts or streams of burning rays about the  obe itself Various have been the conjectures of what nature they are but none to any purpose  EUGEN  I think you said Sir that the planets are not  minous bodies and of course do not give light from themselves like the sun  ERAST  I did They are dark opake and more or  ss solid bodies like the globe of the earth That  e of them which the sun shines on reflects a light  ck which we see when the sun is not visible so as to  lipse their light Were we in one of the planets the  eth would appear to us then as the planets do to us  w that is like a star  EUGEN  Permit me Sir to say that this system ap  ars very singular you advance that the sun is a fixed  dy except its turning round its own axis and that the  rth and other planets make a periodical revolution  und it from west to east Now Sir if we believe our  n eyes we are taught the contrary for the sun seems  move and the earth to stand still Does not the  rise every day in the east and set in the west  ERAST  In appearance it does but not so in reality  e earth as I observed to you besides its annual revo  tion round the sun turns like a wheel round its own  s every twentyfour hours and by this wonderful  ntrivance every inhabitant on the earth is by rotation  esented to the sun and enjoys the benefit of its salutary  nence When this motion brings any part of the  th within view of the sun it is called  day  but on  t part where the sun does not shine it is called  night  us in every twentyfour hours is day and night al  nately occasioned all over the world This motion of  the earth being from west to east causes an apparent motion of the sun the contrary way and other heavenly bodies that is from east to west for the fixed stars appear to us to rise and set as does the sun  EUGEN  And how is this accounted for  ERAST  Because we are not sensible of our own motion You must have taken notice that when we were in a boat the shore we looked at and every thing upon that shore seemed to move the contrary way to that we were going for such is the wise direction of Providence that partaking of the motion of the earth in common with the earth we are not sensible of its moving and of course are led to suppose that the objects move on which we look The earth whirls round at the rate of miles an hour and were we to be sensible of its motion the consequences would be very bad Indeed every thing upon it partakes of the common motion of the globe itself and is not any way affected by that motion in the same manner as no alteration takes place in any thing on board a ship let the ship move as fast as it will A bottle of water for example hung up or board a vessel to empty itself drop by drop into another bottle placed under it with a narrow neck the drops will all fall directly into the bottle though the ship shall have run many inches whilst the drop was in the air  EUGEN  How Sir are the seasons accounted forâ–ª  ERAST  As the hours and days are accounted for by the motion of the earth round its axis so are the months and seasons by its revolution round the sunâ–ª It makes its great circuit once in twelve months A  as the sun is not immediately in the centre of that great circle which the earth describes it must happen that in its course it is at one time of the year nearer th  sun than at another When it is farthest from the s  it is our summer when nearest winter and whe  between the two extremes spring and autumn  EUGEN  How is that possible The nearer th  earth is to the sun one would suppose the more it must feel its heat now we feel less of its heat in winter than in summer  ERAST  This arises from the position the earth  with respect to the sun When the sun is farthest  rom the earth as in summer it is over our heads and its rays fall down perpendicularly upon us and in that direction a great many more rays fall on any parricular spot than when they fall on us in an oblique direction or come upon us sideways as they do in winter the sun being then apparently lower in the heavens Besides in summer then sun though further off is more hours with us every day than in winter of course the longer it shines on us though perhaps not so hot the more it warms the earth than a greater heat would  o in winter in fewer hours  Therefore as the earth is round it is plain to see  rom its daily and annual motions that the season and the days and nights must vary on the different parts of the globe It is summer in one part when it is winter  n another and the days increase and decrease according to the time that the sun is in view In some parts of the globe there is only one night and one day throughout the year that is the sun is seen for six months in the year and is not seen for the other six in these places the sun never rises very high but yet sets  ot during the whole six months but seems to go round and round us during the other six months it never  ises The Greenlanders are in this situation who generally quit the island when the sun leaves it  Talking of the revolutions of the earth round the sun leads me to say something to you of the late alteration of our Style Have you a proper knowledge of it  EUGEN  I must confess my ignorance  ERAST  The I will explain it to you Though generally speaking we say that the earth takes a year to  ake her circuit round the sun yet the exact time she  akes is days hours wanting some minutes now  s our year is divided into days in four years we  hould lose nearly a day if we did not add it occasionally to the calendar To remedy this every fourth  ear in the shortest month February we add a day  aking it to consist of twentynine days instead of twentyeight and this fourth year is called leapyear  ut by this occasional addition of a day we gain fortyfour  minutes every year which in years amount to one day and in a greater number of years we had gained eleven days government therefore in order to retrench the time so gained to prevent any change of seasons by such acquisition and to regulate our year by that of other countries who had before take the same step thought it necessary to throw out the eleven days from the calendar in September and to call the next day after the second the fourteenth Some years hence it will be necessary to take some such step again  EUGEN  If you remember you promised when you had explained the earth's motion to give me an account of the timekeeper for ascertaining the Longitude  ERAST  I did and I cannot do it at a better time than now  The earth's surface is divided into equal parts by imaginary lines drawn from north to south which are called  degrees of longitude  The earth's daily revolution round its axis eastward as I told you is performed in twentyfour hours consequently in that time the places under each of those imaginary lines or degrees become in turn opposite to the sun that is the sun is as it were over the heads of persons dwelling or being in those places and it is then noon or twelve o'clock at such places Now from the time any one o  those lines passes the sun till the next line passes it mu  be just four minutes for twentyfour hours which i  minutes divided by will give four minutes so that for every degree of longitude we sail to the east we as it were meet the sun and noon will be four minutes sooner than it would have been had we continues where we were and on the contrary if we sail westward we as it were retire from the sun and noon will b  four minutes later Now if when it is exactly noon  the place we sail from which may be known by th  sun we set the timekeeper at twelve o'clock and sa  eastward if this timekeeper does not vary it will always tell us the hour it is at the place we sailed from if upon examination some time afterwards we find it t  be exactly noon or twelve o'clock when the timekeeper points to ten in the morning it is evident that we a  two hours eastward of the place we sailed from whi  s equal to miles reckoning sixty miles to a degree for two hours is thirty times four minutes and each four minutes being a degree two hours is exactly thirty degrees or miles  EUGEN  You have explained it very clearly Now Sir for the Latitude  ERAST  The Latitude is the distance of any one place from the Equator or a supposed line drawn round the globe of the earth in the middle between the two poles or ends that is the distance from north to south To have a proper idea of this you must consider the earth as round or globular and that there is a fixed star in the north part of the heavens called the Polestar When we are at the Equator or middle of the earth this polestar appears level with the ground we stand on but as we travel towards it that is to the north this star is observed to rise higher in the heavens but were we to turn our backs upon it and travel to the southward that is from it we should soon lose sight of it as the roundness or swell of the earth would hide it from our view In this case we should see a variety of stars that in our present northern hemisphere or situation we can never see and the more we continued our journey southwards the more new stars would arise  n view but on our return towards the north we should lose them again Now as when placed in the Equator or the middle of the earth the polestar appears on a level with the ground we stand on so as we travel northward or towards it it appears to rise higher in the heavens and by measuring its height which is done by an instrument made for that purpose called a  uadrant  we can tell exactly how far we have travelled northward for every degree the polestar is risen in the heavens we have travelled sixty miles from the Equator so that when we arrive in England and measure the height of this star and find it fiftyone degrees and a half which is the height of the polestar with us we know that we are about miles distant from the middle of the earth  I will endeavour to explain this better by comparison Suppose the weathercock on a churchsteeple to be seen  st above the top of a hill as we rise the hill part of  the steeple will appear and the weathercock will apparently rise higher In like manner the higher we get and the more we get over the hill the higher will the weathercock appear as the body of the church will he then seen under it Let the weathercock be now the north or polestar and the hill the swell or rotundity of the earth as the further we advance upon the hill and travel towards the weathercock the higher it seems to be so the further we travel towards the star and rise over the rotundity of the earth the higher will the polestar appear in the heavens and of course the height of the star will measure the length of way we have travelled  EUGEN  The comparison is a very just one and answers the purpose you designed by it You said Sir that the Moon was a secondary planet to the earth and not only revolved round it but continued so revolving during the earth's whole revolution round the sun  ERAST  I did  EUGEN  Be kind enough to explain to me the appearances of the moon What are those spots we observe in it  ERAST  The Moon is an opake solid body like the earth and all the other planets It is like them also a globe about fifty times smaller than the earth from which it is distant about miles Being an opake body it gives no light of itself but what it reflects back whils  the sun shines upon it When in her course round the earth she happens to be between the earth and the sun as at new moon the side on which the sun shine is turned from the earth and we do not see it Whe  it is in the opposite part of the heavens and we a  between the moon and the sun as at full moon th  sun shines full upon that side that is turned towards u  and we see its full face when it is in the midway be+tween both we see only half the globe of the moo  enlightened this is in its first and third quarters wh  it appears horned and what we call gibbous or humpbacked according to the quantity of the enlightened pa  we can perceive Observe the horns of the moon always  turned from the sun It is thus we account for  s different appearances throughout the month  As to the spots we see so distinctly upon its face or  sk when viewed through a telescope they seem to  e the effects of water and hills upon the surface of its  obe hence we presume it is a solid body like the earth  d may possibly be inhabited but it appearing to  ve no atmosphere the people there if any do not  eathe Indeed all the planets for any thing that we  ay know may be inhabited and each star may be a sun  e centre of a system of worlds This opinion does not  all interfere with the almighty power of the Creator  o may according to his pleasure create as many  orlds as he forms grains of sand  EUGEN  It is a pity that no one has taken a jour  y to the moon to know what is doing there  ERAST  We hope one day to be satisfied in that  rticular A very curious person examining the moon  rough the great telescope at the observatory at Paris  ought he saw in it an animal that moved Struck with  e sight and not doubting of the fact he called others  he witness of it they ran and examined and saw as  hey supposed an animal that seemed to walk upon the  ce of the moon But it was very far distant from that  EUGEN  What was it then  ERAST  The telescope was twenty feet long and  e person had conveyed a mouse into it purposely  lay the fool with this observer  EUGEN  It was a pleasant trick But what are the  ses of the Eclipses You see Sir that if I know no  ng more I know at least how to ask question  ERAST  It is a proof of your judgment and I am  ased with it As the moon revolves round the earth  the earth with its revolving moon round the sun  ust happen at times that the moon will be between  earth and the sun in which case it will intercept  light of the sun from some part of the earth as if  put your hand between your eye and a candle it  obscure the candle either in whole or in part where  light is so intercepted the sun will be eclipsed and  e or less according to the quantity of light inter  ed so that to a spectator on the earth the sun will  seem to be darkened by the moon passing before it this must always happen at new moon as we find eclipses of the sun do when the light side of the moon i  turned from us should it happen by the same me  that the earth comes between the moon and the sun and directly opposite to each other the earth being a solid substance casting and shadow behind it and the moon passing through that shadow will be eclipsed more or less as she passes more or less through the shade Thi  most always happen at full moon Eclipses of the su  are seen only in particular places where the sun's ligh  it intercepted from them but eclipses of the moon must be universal and are seen every where it be+ing obscured by the earth's shadow  EUGEN  We are apt to think a good deal of thos  things and that we are under the influence of the star  but for my part I do not know whether my planet  good or bad  ERAST  You make me smile with your planet Ex+clusive of the effects of heat from the sun's rays whic  sometimes have very sensible influence upon natur  and that influence which we attribute to the moon up  the tides be assured there is no other The stars ta  no part in any thing that concerns us The influence of the planets is an old and vulgar error The anc  Romans considered all the fingular phenomena whi  they remarked in the heavens as so many prodigi  â–ª The Egyptians used to beat kettles and thus made great noise to frighten away the dragon which t  said attacked the moon when they saw it eclipses The truth of astronomical knowledge has convinced of the vanity of judicial astrology and has cured us its chimaeras  EUGEN  You are now clearing up things to which I had no comprehension of but how was knowledge acquired and what proofs are there of  ERAST  From the earliest ages men have attac  themselves to the study of the stars They observed phenomena of nature and remarked the regular re  of seasons the constant and wonderful order of heavenly bodies Philosophy and astronomy have gone a  great wayinto this enquiry in short by  assistance of glasses that bring objects nearer to the  iew I mean telescopes which by chance were dis  covered  EUGEN  I beg pardon for interrupting you But  ow was this discovery made  ERAST  Very remarkably The children of a  ectacle maker at Middleburg in Zealand having put two glasses into a tube one before the other by way of  musement and looking through them at the cock upon clock it appeared so large and brought it so near to the  ye that they ran and told their father of it who was  urprised at the effect He presently made the first telescope we had which since had been so much improved as to enable us by their help to demonstrate  eometrically what passes at very great distances The  alculations of good astronomers are such that they  now how to predict a number of years before both the hour and minute of the return of each season the mo  ent the greatness and duration of eclipses and point  t those which are visible to us and to others but as  the predictions of rain or fine weather which we  eet with in almanacks they are fit only to amuse fools  he alteration of the weather depends more or less on the weight of the air and the direction of the winds  f course who can fortel their variations  EUGEN  I could wish to have some account of the  r and the winds  ERAST  The air consists of an infinite number of  rticles or small bodies of water and other matter ex  led from the earth and sea by the heat of the sun  ese rise some miles above the earth and being con  used or pressed together form clouds which be  ming too heavy by collecting for the air below to  pport them fall in rain or in cold weather in snow or  il which is nothing more than rain frozen into flakes of ice in the upper region of the air  EUGEN  What are Fogs and Dew  ERAST  Dew is the vapour or watery particles raised  the sun from the earth but in the mornings and  mings at sunrise and sun  set the sun yields not suffi  nt heat to carry it up into the air of course it is by  e cold condensed or thickened and falls upon the earth  agains This frozen in the winter gives the white  oarfrost  A Fog is also the vapour rising from the earth and owing to the cold morning particularly in spring and autumn is condensed and of course becomes too heavy to rise in the air it hovers therefore upon the surface of th  ground and sometimes so low that you may see over it  A Mist is the same vapour but carried rather higher It is in fact a thin cloud that falls before it b  sufficiently condensed but not so low as to touch the surface of the ground of course by stooping down  may see under it This vapour according to its degree  condensation will sometimes appear only as a mist an  at others in drizling rain so that you see the fog  rises  b  the mist  falls  I have seenin an evening and a morning in hot weather the vapours rise from the top of a hig  hill in one particular spot like smoke from a chimney and in such quantities as to be too heavy to be carried u  into the air of course have fallen down again presentl  and in a quarter of an hour have covered the who valley with mist  EUGEN  How high will these vapours rise  ERAST  The atmosphere surrounds the earth an  rises above it to the distance of about fortysix  fortyseven miles but the clouds are not generall  above two or three miles high the tops of the hills a  frequently above the clouds The higher we ri  in that atmosphere the thinner we find the air a  it is supposed that at the height of six or seven miles from the surface of the earth it would be too th  to support life for it is by breathing air of a certa  weight that we live In wet weather the air is con  +derably lighter than in fine weather  EUGEN  How is that Sir Do not we call da  weather heavy weather And do not we feel  spirits oppressed at such times whereas in fine weather we are light and active  ERAST  We do but this is owing to our reason from effects A certain weight of air is necessary keep us in health was I to mention the weight of which the body of a man supports it would be al  incredible it is not less than about pounds  nearly fourteen tons a weight that would crush him Providence had not wisely provided against it but he  is made air of so subtile a nature as to pervade all  b  stances let them be ever so compact of course  roughout the frame of man there is a quantity of  ternal air that acts as an equipoise to the external  essure so that we are not incommoded by it If then  e weight of the air be reduced to thirteen tons we find  rselves disordered for if fourteen tons weight of air  necessary to constringe and brace the fibres and nerves  the body a loss of one ton must of course relax  and a heaviness of spirits ensue it is owing to this  at we call a light air heavy and a heavy air light  is this weight of air that foretels the weather in the  rometer or weatherglass The air being extracted between the surface of quicksilver and the top of the  ss as the weight of the atmosphere presses upon the reservoir of quicksilver in the bason at bottom it  es in the tube of course the heavier the air the  gher it rises and the lighter the air the lower it sinks  hen therefore we observe the quicksilver to sink we  pect rain as the air becoming lighter will not have  fficient strength to buoy up the clouds  EUGEN  Now you mention the weight of the air  me if you please what these airballoons are that  ve made so much noise of late  ERAST  It is a known principle in natural philosophy  t in any fluid the lighter body will rise to the top in the sea a lighter body as wood and cork will rise to  e surface so in the air bodies lighter than the air will  e in it for example smoke feathers c Now it  lately been discovered that a light hollow globe  ed with Gas which is an ebullition or air extri  ted from certain substances as vitriol steelfilings  e putrefaction of animal bodies or other things  ich there is a means of doing acids poured upon  elfilings will procure this gas which is lighter than  air and will naturally raise the globe till it meet with  art of the atmosphere as light and thin as itself when  ill rise no higher Ingenious men from this disco  y may hereafter find a method of directing it in the  air and by this means a way of conveying things from one place to another  EUGEN  I have heard Sir that the Rainbow is o  ing to a reflection of the light from the drops of rain falling from the clouds Is it so  ERAST  It is and it arises from a beautiful disposition of colours which the rain takes on when th  sun shines upon the falling cloud a disposition o  dained by the Alimighty as a token of his promise t  Noah that he would never again drown the world Th  full moon shining on the rain will also occasion a rain+bow but a fainter one  EUGEN  You mentioned the subtilty of the air and its pervading all substances  ERAST  I did It is the  primum mobile  or principal agent of all nature It acts upon vegetables as well  animals Nothing can live without it By means  the lungs we inspire and expire alternately that is  say we draw in the air and throw it out again by tur  The air has a great influence upon health when  tiated by accidental causes it occasions epidemic sick+ness both to man and beast It pervades the wate  and the very bowels of the earth It is this in conju  tion with fire that causes Earthquakes The earth  closes in its bowels a great deal of inflammable matte  which very easily takes fire and will then expand t  air pent up in subterraneous caverns and convul  the earth sometimes it will burst its inclosures ma  great mists in the earth swallow up every thing up  the surface and belch out its flames in great abundan  Hence arise the Vulcanos or burning mountain  many parts of the world which are a kind of tunn  or chimnies where this subterraneous fire has ve  Vesuvius has burnt for more than a thousand years  From this account of the nature of air you  form a good idea of the Wind which is merely a c  rent of air more or less violent according to the im  +tuosity with which it moves for the air fluctuates  the waves of the sea and is as capable of being agita  to the utmost degree  The winds take different names from the points fr  whence they blow  viz  north east south and west  Seamen who conduct their ships from place to place the wind find it necessary to know the least varia  ns of course they divide these four names into  rtytwo but such an accurate knowledge is not ne  sary for you It is enough to know the effects of  four winds A north wind in winter is very sharp  in summer it moderates and refreshes both plants  animals And a south wind in winter temperates  cold These are the winds that bring and chace  ay the rain It is the property of wind to dry the  d it is of use to turn windmills where there is not conveniency to erect watermills but one of the  at benefits which the wind affords is that of assist  the vegetation of plants Its action serves to raise  sap and keep it in motion  EUGEN  But I have known dreadful effects from  wind I have seen it tear up trees by the roots and  rturn buildings by its rage  ERAST  I believe it The violence of the winds  o be dreaded when they cross and clash with each  er When an east wind and west wind rages and  ets each other with fury they excite whirlwinds tem  s and hurricanes which sweep away all before them Whirlwind is a circling wind that frequently in the  dy desarts of Arabia will carry up the dust a con  erable height in the air and smother a traveller that  pens to be in it Hurricanes are such a scourge to  igation that mariners dread them exceedingly  ere was such a furious hurricane at Guardaloupe in  that lifted out of the waters a vessel of eighty  s burthen then at anchor in the port and by one  t carried her more than paces upon the land  are my friend the different effects of air and wind  th respect to the velocity of wind it goes in a great  m at the rate of fifty or sixty miles an hour a  mon brisk wind flies about fifteen miles an hour  some winds move not one mile an hour Now  are on the subject of air there is a phenomena  two that I would make you acquainted with  EUGEN  I am all attention  ERAST  One is Sound the other is the Eccho Sound  e effect of air struck or pressed on by some compulsive  cause till it reaches our ear Air undula  like water and as when we strike the water in any o  place it communicates its motion to the water nexts  and so on till the force of such stroke is felt at a considerable distance so is it in air If we give moti  to the air by our voice that motion will mo  the adjoining air and will extend the communication in proportion to the agitation we first give it T  louder the noise the further the sound is thus communi+cated In a word the air is a fluid so subtil and de  +cate and its motion is so quick that the sound of great clock will be carried feet in a second of time  EUGEN  Now Sir for the eccho  ERAST  An eccho is accounted for on the sa  principles An undulation is given to the air by  concussion of the voice this undulation reaches so  wall some house or some wood meets there with resistance and is reflected or reverberated back to  ear so that we shall hear the same words some secon  after we have spoken them If there are two or three or more resisting objects in the way the will e  send back the sound in their turn and we shall hear  same word repeated two three or more times  EUGEN  I have been told that Light is a body  that it passes a great deal quicker than sound  ERAST  Light is another phenomenon in natural not less wonderful than air it is a fluid that ex  without ceasing We admit that light is part of  substance of the sun from whence it flows and is subtil as to penetrate every where throughout the  Its velocity or quickness of passing is so great that will run neat twelve millions of miles in one min  It is by the combined effects of the air and light t  we are indebted for the Dawn and the Twilight  EUGEN  Pray Sir explain it to me  ERAST  If it were not for the atmosphere as  as the sun sets we should lose the benefit of his li  and be in instant darkness but though the sun by  +ting is hid from our view it still continues to  light to the upper part of the atmosphere which  +flects it down upon us and gives the twilight so break of day was it not for the air as soon as the  rises we should have instant day and the sudden glare  uld hurt our sight but the Almighty has provided  ainst it It illuminates the atmosphere above some  e before it rises forms what we call the Dawn  d introduces the day to us gradually  EUGEN  I think Sir in speaking of the winds you  d nothing of the MonsoonsWhat are they  ERAST  There is something wonderful in the phenomena of the monsoons or trade winds They always  w from one and the same quarter of the globe In  Ethiopic Atlantic and Pacific oceans to thirty degrees of the equinoctial line they are found to blow  tinually towards the west but in the bay of Bengal  abian Chinese and Indian seas they blow in the  mer to the northeast and in the winter to the south  t So that if the seamen who sail in those parts ob  e the seasons they never fail of a fair wind to  ry them out and bring them back They waft the  el generally at the rate of about nine miles an hour  EUGEN  And to what is this owing  ERAST  To the powerful influence of the sun in  e warm climates for when the air is very much  ed it will rise to the upper part of the atmosphere  the adjacent air will rush in to supply its place  therefore there will be a stream or current of air  all parts towards the place where the heat is  it being the property of heat to rarefy or expel the  the same phenomenon will take place in a room  a fire in it for as the fire expels the air round it  adjacent air will rush in so that there is a constant  ght between the window if open and the fire and  reen the doors and the fire of course to fit in such  ents or draughts of air is not only unpleasant but  gerous to the health  EUGEN  Of all the four elements Fire I apprehend  ost to be dreaded I have a very imperfect notion  re and shall be happy to be better imformed  ERAST  Fire my dear Eugenius is like water a  good servant but a very bad master  EUGEN  You mean that it is very useful to man  kept within bounds but very destructive when  ed to rage or get head  ERAST  I do With respect to its nature it is inexplicable riddle We know only that fire is a p  +digious elastic fluid which gives heat and light T  burning fluid so subtle and to which we give the n  of electric matter is spread throughout the atmosphere and exists invisibly more or less in all body As long as it is shut up it is peaceable and as it we  captive It requires only a certain degree of motion make us perceive it Two bodies striking against rubbed hard upon each other is sufficient to let it lo  it then sparkles gives light and will communicate wh  it can Its action lasts till the object it attacks and f  it is reduced to ashes Take notice how the air agit  and encreases fire If it wants air it will smother  disappear The more the air is condensed that  say the thicker and heavier it is the more it presses  fire and increases its heat This is the reason that is more lively in winter because the air that surro  it is at that time more condensed For the con  reason the air being more ratified that is to say lig  in summer fire then has less force You must have served that the sun shining upon the fire will put it and for the reason I mentioned  EUGEN  You must allow however that it is i  summertime and in hot weather that fire make  greatest ravages for example the Thunder W  think you of that dreadful phenomenon  ERAST  The real opinion of the best natural  +osophers is that Lightning is no other than that  +tric matter of which I have told you a kind of fluid infinitely subtle and penetrating This fire communicate and join itself with almost every th  and become more active and more violent It rises the earth into the upper regions of the air and  meeting with a great quantity of imflammable ex  tions which are a kind of food to electric fire s  lightning and thunder This is so true that ho  +mates where the air is full of bitumen sulphur  +petre and other like substances are more subject lightning and thunder than other parts It thu  frequently in Italy and almost all the year in Jam  but much more seldom in cold countries and  ere is great deal of rain Lightning is no more  an sparks from electrified clouds Clouds driven by  ontrary winds collect and beat one against another  is creates an infinity of sparks which are the foreruners of thunder If the sparks meet with a good deal  f inflammable matter collected it augments the action  f the electric fire so as to break in thunder and thunderbolts The sudden firing of this matter and the  xpansion and terrible explosion of these globes of fire  riking the air with great violence produces a dreadful  ife which is heard a great way off Though we  ow not the nature of this fire if we judge of it by  s effects the powers of lightning when accompanied  ith thunder is great and wonderful We have known  e blade of a sword to be melted in the scabbard and  e scabbard not hurt  a foot burnt in the shoe and the  oe not injured liquor disappear in a corked bottle  d the bottle not broke When thunder is heard  d no lightning is seen it is that the clouds which  casion the storm are so thick so close and so dark  not to suffer the lightning to be visible It was for  erly an custom in thunder and lightning to ring the  lls in a church steeple in hopes of destroying the  ect of the lightning by agitating the air with the  and of the bells but it has been known to attract  e lightning and bring it down upon the bells and  on the ringers rather than disperse it To avoid the  structive effects of this electric fire which will frequently shake the steeples of churches and other high  ildings wires are now fixed to serve as Conductors  it has been proved that a wire raised above the top  a building and carried at a small distance down the  e of such building into the ground below will attract  lightning and conduct it into the ground without doing any injury in its passage  EUGEN  We hear almost every year of some new acci  arising from thunder but I was ignorant until now  t it was a natural effect I thought God had sent  nder always to alarm the wicked But I find by at explanation that  an element of consequence the catalogue of nat    ERAST  It is the ve  oul of nature It gives life  to every thing When too much cold takes away th  fire that exists even in the coldest water the wat  freezes When fire ceases to warm the air the air becomes cold and frosty In short without the beni  influence of fire all nature would die and the ear  would produce nothing  EUGEN  We certainly receive the greatest bene  from fire it affords us light and heat and dresser o  food I do believe that without its assistance men wo  not be able to subsist  ERAST  You may carry your views a great way father besides being the principle of the life both animals and vegetables it is by this that we distil  rits and perform a number of chemical operation by this we melt and refine ores calcine stone a  make lime to build with by this we make glass wonderful composition of ashes and sand which p  vents the wind and cold entering our dwellings  yet suffering the light to pass by this also we m  those glasses that assist a weak sight and those telesco  by means of which we read the very heavens It is account of its many services that some have adored f  as a beneficent divinity The Chaldeans the Persi  offered sacrifices to it At Rome vestals were appoint  to preserve and keep up continually the sacred fire a  were punished with death if they put it out  EUGEN  You have enumerated I confess  essential services of fire but you must allow Sir t  its malignity in a great measure takes off from its  rits We can never put any confidence in it it is  a traitor Besides fire pervading the earth prod  those dreadful combustions you have been describi  and expanded through the air gives birth to that thun+der which commits such devastation Is it neces  that God should suffer these things  ERAST  These seeming disorders in nature are  +tainly a real good in the profound views of Provide  though human capacity is too limited to find it but to return to your question Though the effect lightning are dangerous it is useful in the syste  nature it refreshes the air and purges it of an in  of noxious vapours If subterraneous fires  ose inflammable substances in the bowels of the earth  hat cause volcanos and earthquakes they are at  he same time the prolific principle of every natural  roduction

oubted but that this internal fire exists Workmen  ho labour in metalic mines assure us that the lower  ey go the greater is the heat especially beyond the  epth of feet Naturalists atribute the heat of  ot baths to the effects of these subterraneous fires or a mixture of pyrites or firestones which heat in dis  ving We have in Europe many springs of this kind  hose waters more or less hot are very beneficial in  any disorders Bath Buxton and Matlock in England  audeFontaine and AixlaChapelle in Germany  he degree of heat in the last is so great as to boil an  g hard in five minutes

these different substances which  ders their virtues more or less esticacious and proper  the cure of many disorders  EUGEN  Before you close the article of fire please give me some account of gunpowder  ERAST  It was known in China a long time be  e it was discovered in Europe but the wise Chi  e made no other use of it than for their amusement  example in forming a variety of artificial fires which they excelled In the year it was dis  ered in Europe by one Shwartz of Cologne He a great chymist and grinding one day upon a stone  e brimstone saltpetre and charcoal a spark of accidentally fell among the composition and with a  ible explosion blew the stone into the air and filled whole laboratory with smoke Such is said to be  origin of this discovery so fatal to the human race know I presume the ravage which firearms es  ally cannon have made throughout Europe  EUGEN  What is it gives gunpowders that force  ERAST  It arises from the air pent up in every grain of powder and suddenly dilated by being set on fire The greater the quantity of powder and the more i  is compressed the greater is the explosion and th  more violent its effects Nothing resembles more th  noise of thunder than that which arises from the explosion of gunpowder  But the fire of the sun when its rays are concentre  in the focus of a burning glass that is brought to  point by suffering the sun to shine through a thick conve  piece of glass  is far more active than earthly fire  it as powerful as it may It was by this means the  say that Archimedes the greatest mechanist in th  world burnt the Roman fleet before Syracuse F  through such a glass the sun's rays may be collected  a point at a great distance from the glass In a wo  to close this subject fire pervades both the Heave  and the Earth and would destroy every thing if G  did not confine it within certain limits and the insta  he shall please to let it loose it will terminate in th  universal conflagration and dissolution of the element which will put an end to the world  EUGEN  Having now entered I believe pretty ful  into the heavenly bodies and into two of the element namely Fire and Air let me request if I have  tired you to give me some account of the other t  Earth and Water  ERAST  As you seem disposed at attend we w  from the heavens descend upon the earth Here t  we are and as the waters occupy the greatest part the surface of the terrestrial globe we will be with considering the Sea  EUGEN  ow Hhappy should I be to see this g  element  ERAST  In a calm when there is no wind would see immense fluid greenish plain always  +dulating but in no great degree at other times w  the wind blows you will see it very much agitated rising successively in great billows beyond the rea  the eye dashing as it were the very clouds  whole extent of the sea is not yet discovered We  that it surrounds and divides different parts of the e  To different parts of the sea we give different na  EUGEN  What is there remarkable belonging to the sea I have heard of the Tides as a thing very singular  ERAST  This phenomenon is an effect so extraordinary in the nature of Water that the best natural philosophers have not yet able to pass more than some rational conjectures on its true cause It seems as if it pleased God to conceal this among a number of other secrets of nature which are impenetrable to the human mind However the general opinion is that the sun and particularly the moon are mostly concerned in the flux and reflux of the sea The waters of the sea in the flux flow or are gently drawn from south to north for the space of six hours in the reflux they employ the same time in returning from north to south resting about a quarter of an hour between the  ebb and flow and the flow and ebb When it has lowed its six hours the water is considerably higher in the place to which it has flowed and we call it highwater at that place When it has returned or ebbed its  ix hours we say it is lowwater But this periodical low and ebb is not general in all seas nor equal  EUGEN  Can you give me no farther account of it  ERAST  These tides are of great use when there is little or no wind in carrying vessels up certain rivers  n their flow and conveying them back again in the  me of ebb they are of similar use about the coasts  nd carry ships at the rate of about five miles an hour The moon acts upon the water according to a re  eived opinion by attraction that is to say it raises or  raws the water towards it at some certain situations her course round the earth at which time it occasions swell of the sea in that part directly under the  oon and of course as the waters rise in one place  e waters from other parts will run there This  casions the current in certain directions  EUGEN  If this was general there would be a tide all rivers which I understand is not the case  ERAST  I told you it was by no means general In  ers of little or no breadth where the moon cannot  in one part stronger than in another there will be tide for the attraction being equal in such narrow  streams the water cannot shift or move from one place to another so as to cause a flux and reflux  EUGEN  Is the moon's power of attraction always the same in the same parts  ERAST  No it has a greater attraction at new and full moon than at the first or third quarter for the situation of the moon with the respect to the sun at the new and full is such that the sun conspires with the moon at those times to attract the waters and causes a higher tide than when the moon is in the first or third quarters At new and full moon the tides are called  springtides  and rise nine or ten feet above the level of the water at lowwater mark When the moon is in the first and third quarter the water does not rise so high and the tides are then called  neaptides  From the time of neaptide to that of springtide the water rise every tide more and more till they get to the highest from springtide to neaptide they gradually fall more and more  EUGEN  Does not the tide alter its time of flowing every day  ERAST  It does and is in this regulated by the moon for as the moon rises every day fifty minute later than the day before so does the sea rise also that is it flows minutes later To give you a better o  clearer account of it it would be necessary to explain it by drawings I have said enough to give you general idea which is all I aim at  EUGEN  I understand it very well and am much obliged to you I have been told that Seawater  not fit to drink What is this owing to  ERAST  Because it is salt and bitter and of marshy smell These qualities render it disagreeable to the taste though it may not be so to a great man who live almost wholly upon the sea The Czar Pet  the Great obliged his sailors to accustom their children to drink nothing but seawater and they all die  Masters of vessels always provide fresh water for th  ship's company before they fail The important seen of making salt water fresh to a certain degree ha  indeed been discovered for some years and most se  men know how to do it but they have recourse to the  method only upon urgent occasions Seawater is heavier than riverwater will of course float greater burdens and it is on account of its weight that it evaporates more and freezes less it is also more or less salt in certain places Do not imagine that the salt it contains is useless Providence has made nothing in vain The Sun by its heat attracts from the surface of the sea a quantity of vapours impregnated with light particles of salt these vapours rise in the air and form clouds They fall again in rain in snow in  hail and sprinkle the land and by the salts they contain assist vegetation Besides seawater affords us salt for our different wants They make it at the seaside and those places where they make it are called saltpits They pump in a quantity of water into  hallow pits leave it there some time to be evaporated by the sun by which means the water is exhaled and the salt remains after this to purify it and make it white they boil it in vessels till it is dry and fit for use  EUGEN  The sea affords us still greater benefits for example fish in the greatest abundance Is it known Sir how many sorts there are  ERAST  The sea is a liquid world peopled with an  sinity of inhabitants different in species in size and manner of living We are acquainted with a great many but there are probably many we are unacquainted  ith We find some particular kinds of fish in certain  as and other fish in other seas as Cod on the banks of Newfoundland Some come in shoals at particular  imes as Herrings and Mackrell others alone some  eep about the coasts others out at sea some never quit be mud that is they crawl at the bottom others  im near the top The greatest number of fishes are  iparous that is to say the young spring from the  awn or eggs of the female which are impregnated  y the male others are viviparous that is produce  heir young completely formed Some fish are covered  ith skins others with scales and others with shells  ue sort is good to eat another for different uses  ome they catch after one manner some after another Almost all fish are fish of prey and feed upon others  at the voracious are the least prolific whilst  those which serve others for prey multiply prodigiously so that no one species can be thoroughly destroyed The Creator has given to fishes as to other animals instinct and a means of procuring their subsistance Every species has its mode of attack its art of defence and method of stealing away from the pursuit of its enemy  EUGEN  You can tell me no doubt many remarkable things of fishes  ERAST  As far as my reading and some few conversations I have had upon the subject has enabled me  The Whale is called the Queen of the Sea because she is the greatest fish and the largest of the watery tribe Whales have been taken from to feet in length but they are in general about or feet long The head of a Whale is of an enormous size and is about a third of its whole length but its eye are no larger than the eyes of an Ox Its whole strength and defence is in its tail which is very large It live upon small fish which abound in the North seas It  chiefly on the coasts of Greenland and about Spitsberge  that they are caught The Dutch are annually at great expence in this fishery The fat of the Wha  yields a quantity of train oil which is a great artic  of commerce with the Dutch Many ships go annual from Englands and to encourage the fishery whic  with the God fishery at Newfoundland is a nursery s  seamen government gives a bounty for every What that is brought home It is this fish alone that yield the whalebone The Whale and other fishes of t  like kind which we call  cetaceous  are viviparou  they carry their young nine or ten months and ha  only one or two young Whales at a time which th  suckle a year Great Whales lay themselves up un  the ice which they pierce to take air for they can remain more than half an hour under water with  coming to the surface to breathe They have two tu  on the head through which they throw up the w  to a great height and with great noise  EUGEN  I am curious to know how they are cau  ERAST  I will tell you then An expert str  sailor throws a harpoon at the Whale which is an  pole about five or six feet long with a barbed point and a rope fastened at the other end As soon as the Whale feels this stick in its back it flies and the cord which is of great length is suffered to run out with the Whale The fish is pursued with boats and presently  oses its strength with its blood and expires on the surface of the water When dead they cut it up as it  ies on the water and take only on board such parts of t  as are useful  EUGEN  Are there any other great fishes  ERAST  There is the SeaUnicorn so called on account of a long tooth it carries on the left side of its  pper jaw This fish is a great enemy to the Whale There is a Swordfish that has a bone in his nose like sword that attacks and combats the Whale and puts  to flight There is also the Porpoise and the Dolphin which are large fishes The Dolphin by no means resembles what painters describe it it is a  ery swift swimmer being continually in pursuit of  mall fishes of which it devours a prodigious quantity  Different seas yield different kinds of fishes but among seamonsters one of the most mischievous and  oracious and which is found almost every where is  e Shark They have been seen twentyfive feet long  is called the tyrant of the seas It makes cruel war  ith other fishes and has been known to swallow a  an whole even when he was armed some have imagined that it was in the belly of this fish that the prophet Jonah lived three days  EUGEN  I should dread the teeth of this monstrous  h if I was out at sea Are these Sir the only remarkable fishes  ERAST  There are many of an amphibious kind at is such as live both by land and by water For  ample the SeaCow the SeaWolf the SeaBear  d the SeaLion who have only two feet which are  hands or fins to swim with whereas all other fishes  ve four fins These frequent great rivers They  e been known to weigh from to lb weight They continue more or less time in the water and Then out of the water are found feeding reposing or  ping upon the ice upon a rock or upon the shore  It is at this time they are generally taken The Tortoise is also a kind of amphibious shellfish of which there are three species LandTortoises SeaTortoises or Turtle and those of fresh water The Tortoise or Turtle is oviparous and lives a long time its flesh and eggs are good to eat Travellers affirm that they have seen Turtles ten feet long and seven feet wide A single one has yielded two hundred weight of flesh A female Turtle lays more than one hundred and fifty large eggs They are found in the sand on the shore  in holes where they are deposited A fat Turtle will yield more than thirty pints of oil drawn from its grease This oil is good in cookery when new and fi  to burn when old The fat has even a good flavour will keep and supply the place of butter In a word the shell is beautiful and serves to make a variety of curious things In some seas they find Turtles in abundance  It would be unnecessary to acquaint you with tha  multitude of fishes that is brought from the coasts t  market and those various species of shellfish such a  Oysters Muscles Crabs Lobsters c which you ha  frequently seen I will trouble your memory only with a few other singularities which the sea presents Fo  example we find in the American isles a fish who  skin and scales are red at Cape Comorin they hav  what they call the Goldenfish which takes its nam  from a circle round the eye and a streak from th  head to the tail of a golden colour In the East In+dies there are small fishes black and white scattere  with spots of gold and silver The great men of th  country keep them as a curiosity In warm climate  there are fishes they call Flyingfish because they jump out of the water when pursued by their enemy an  fly in the air for some little distance There is a fi  in the Mediterranean called the Crampfish whic  will benumb the arm that touches it while living by sudden stroke that it gives there is among the she  fish one called a Seahedgehog covered with sha  points which it makes use of to roll itself in the mu  there is another fish called Nautilus which resembles little boat its skin is arranged in such a way as to serve  a sail so that it is driven upon the waves by the wind There is another like an Eel called the Torpedo which then touched emits sparks of electric sire and will give  n electric shock Specimens of these fishes are pre  erved by the curious in their cabinets In the Eastern  eas are caught in great abundance a kind of Oyster those shell is motherofpearl and in which pearls are  ound The most valuable pearl we have in Europe  ecorates the crown of the kings of Spain It is as  arge as a pidgeon's egg  EUGEN  I have heard persons talk of Mermaids  alf women and half fish that is women to the  raist and fish from the waist downwards Is there  uch a thing  ERAST  Naturalists still doubt it but if we can be  ieve particular writers there seems testimony enough  o establish it We read in the History of England  hat in a Mermaid was taken off the coast of  ffolk which bore so near a conformity with man  hat it seemed to want nothing but the speech We are  lso told that in West Friestand some girls in  aught one that was floundering in the mud that  hey took it home dressed it in women's apparel and  aught it to spin it fed like one of them but  ever would try to speak another writer says they  aught it some notions of a Deity and it would bow  ith reverence when it passed a crucifix Another ac  ount wellattested says that in some fishermen caught in the East Indies seven Mermen and Maids  nd other writers make mention of such creatures being  aught at other times but as such monsters have not  een seen of late years I am myself in doubt about it  EUGEN  How wonderful is the Creator in his pro  uctions and what singularities does the sea alone  fford  ERAST  I could mention many others if it would  ot be entering too minutely into the subject But  efore I quit it I would have you observe that the  ottom of the sea in many places resembles a sort of  ountry it is covered with moss with turf with herbs with roots with plants and shrubs innumerable of different kinds colours size and form Besides the  retreat and nourishment these afford to a number of fishes and creeping insects which here deposit their eggs some of these plants are made use of by men in medicine and other things It would be happy for us if the uses of all were known There are still other marine productions for example Coral whose fishery is very curious It is much esteemed in Africa where they make a variety of pretty toys with it spunge which is found at the foot of rocks and of which great use is made in many mechanical arts Let it be remembered that coral and spunge and many like substances are not seaplants as has been supposed but serve as a refuge for certain insects to lodge in  EUGEN  Is the sea very deep  ERAST  We are assured that its common depth is about fathom each fathom six feet and its greate  about We know also that in certain parts of the sea there are cavities and caverns especially in th  centre of mountains whose tops rise above the surface Mariners do not so much dread these rocks that ar  above water as those whose tops are below the surface and the many sandbanks and currents by them occasioned which are very dangerous to navigation  The different seas are scattered with islands that i  to say with land more or less extensives surrounde  with water these islands are the tops of great hill and mountains at the bottom of the sea The greate  number of islands are found in the neighbourhood  great continents The Archipelago is a part of th  Mediterranean sea where there is a great quantity  islands more or less considerable and at a little distanc  from each other  It is supposed that the greatest part of the island have appeared since the deluge which occasioned a  universal overthrow in the surface of the earth It  probable that before the deluge the waters occupie  only one side of the globe We know however tha  earthquakes have sometimes raised land from the botto  of the sea and formed new islands By the same effect certain islands have sunk and suddenly disappeare  The ancients say that there have been moving  floating islands that is islands which have been supported  on the surface of the sea without touching its bottom but we conceive this to be a fable or to have been great drifts of floating ice  EUGEN  I have heard that seamen meet occasionally with waterspouts in their voyages which they dread approaching almost as much as a rock under water  ERAST  Waterspouts are a great quantity of water drawn up into the air by the attraction of a low cloud which seems to descend for that purpose at a distance it appears like a large funnel the small end touching the sea the broad end enveloped in the clouds Under the small end the water bubbles up and appears to boil Was a ship to run foul of one of these spouts the waters would break deluge the vessel and probably sink it Seamen generally fire a shot at it when within reach and thus disperse it which the agitation of the air by the explosion seldom fails to do  EUGEN  There is only one thing more on the subject of the sea that I wish to be informed of  ERAST  What is that  EUGEN  The nature of the mariner's compass  ERAST  This owes its origin to the loadstone a ferruginous stone found in iron mines which has the power of attracting iron The virtue of this stone was known to the ancients Pliny says it was discovered by chance from a shepherd's finding that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferule of his staff clung to a loadstone over which he walked but they were ignorant of that singular property it possesses of turning towards the poles We do not know to whom to attribute this important discovery The invention of the compass is given to a Dutchman in the year It is an iron needle or hand like the hand of a clock fixed on a point so as to run round and one end being touched by the loadstone which communicates its virtues to it makes it always turn to the north Thus a mariner knowing what way he is to go is always directed though he  es no land And what revolutions in things has the loadstone produced It has made us acquainted with the new world before this invention seamen never ventured out of sight of land but now they have traversed the whole globe It is to this we are indebted to  not only for the discovery of new countries but for the rich mines of gold and silver which these countries produce and which would have been lost to us if we had never reached those shores  EUGEN  All these particularities are worthy our knowledge but after having run through the Heavens and the Waters shall we turn our thoughts to the Earth  ERAST  If you please and we will penetrate its very bowels We have hitherto considered the earth as a planetary globe performing its stated revolutions according to the order which the Creator has established in his arrangement of the world let us look now into it's composition and into it's internal and external productions  The earth is divided by the sea into four great quarters Europe Asia Africa and America These different parts of the world are very different in size form climate and productions The Author of nature has been pleased to throw into his work a  infinite variety Here are immense plains there inaccessible rocks and farther off are mountains that to  the clouds The inequalities on the surface of th  earth we attribute to the great overthrow of nature at the general deluge to the currents of the sea and the rivers and to subterraneous irruptions Th  learned presume to say that since the creation th  globe has been alternately sea and land that is t  say that such parts as are now land were once covert with the sea and such parts as the sea now overflow were once dry land but this is difficult to demonstrate  EUGEN  Can you tell me Sir which are the highe  mountains on the earth  ERAST  The Cordeliers of Peru in America whi  are a chain of mountains near leagues in lengthâ–ª One of these is perhaps the highest mountain in t  world It reaches to the middle region of the air  summit is yards above the level of the sea nearly six miles in height There are other mounta  not quite so high For example Mount Sinai in  +pan the Pike of Teneriffe in Africa Mount Ce  in the Alps Mount Atlas and many others and in observable that we experience more cold in eleva  places particularly on the mountains than in the val  ies or plains  EUGEN  Why is this As being nearer the sun I should suppose the contrary  ERAST  Because the air is keener and the sun's rays do not fall on them perpendicularly It is thus we see the highest mountains almost always covered with  now The cold is so excessive at a certain height on the Cordeliers that men and animals will freeze and become as hard as stone without putrefying  EUGEN  What good purpose do these high mountains and deep vallies answer The earth would apparently be more beautiful and convenient had the Creator made it uniform  ERAST  His profound wisdom knew well to the contrary Besides the agreeableness to the view which his irregularity of the earth affords the mountains  heck the impetuosity of the winds and serve as a salu  ry shelter to the vallies round about and frequently field them at times showers by the clouds pressing against  em in their passage which condenses the water in  ch clouds and causes it to fall in rain They are also a  treat for wild animals useful to men for their skins  nd their furs and they yield a variety of plants  hich will grow no where else Besides the hollows of  ountains contain immense reservoirs of water whence  oceed streams rivulets and rivers  EUGEN  How is that possible  ERAST  Have not I told you that the sun exhaled  om the earth and sea and drew up into the air an  inity of watery particles that these vapours con  sed form clouds and fall again on the earth in  n and snow the snow melts by degrees and with  rain which falls gives a great quantity of water  ich is collected in the hollows of these eminences  es out again by its weight and fluidity and  s springs and rivers These are increased by others  ich join them in their course till they reach again  sea from which they originally sprang Hence are  ived all those waters that circulate in the bosom the earth which is pierced with channels beyond  ber Water will puzzle out its way through the  different stratus or beds of earth sand and stone  ill it finds room to escape then it forms a spring whose waters run according to the declivity of the ground or fall into wells or reservoirs which they naturally make where they find the least cavity  EUGEN  What Sir is a cataract  ERAST  A waterfall such for example as the Cataract of Niagara in North America which is perhaps the largest in the world This is a fall of a whol  river a mile and a half broad It tumbles headlon  from a precipice seet high and flows with suc  violence as to make an arch beneath it under which three men can walk abreast without being wet Th  mist it makes by its fall rises as high as the clouds and may be seen at fifteen miles distance When th  sun shines upon it it forms a rainbow  EUGEN  If all water proceeds from the sea what o  +casions the freshness of River water  ERAST  The Almighty has so contrived it for th  purposes of Man by passing through the earth it philtred and strained of its saline particles and render  refresh and such watery particles as the sun exhales form clouds which afterwards fall in rains are  lighter parts of the water the saline particles being n  turally too heavy to be exhaled and it is a wise pro  sion of Providence that the rain so exhaled does  fall in large quantities which would deluge a country but in showers  I shall some day or other explain to you the g  advantages we derive from streams and rivers Th  supply our wants as well as our pleasures and yield quantity of fishes of various kinds Some riv  abound with some sorts of fishes others with differ sorts and ponds agree best with others In places distance from the sea they supply our tables  riverfish in plenty In short there is scarce stream that does not yield it But the utility streams and rivers as formed by nature and those canals made by the industry of man stops not h  They are of great service in transporting of lime  nure merchandize coals and provisions from town to another which would be very dear and ex  ive  if conveyed by landcarriage They save a great deal of labour in other respects by turning of mills for grinding corn for forges fulling making gunpowder scowering leather and linen for making oil paper sugar spinning and twisting silk sawing of planks and other things  EUGEN  Now you mention coals you will doubt  ess give me some idea of mines  ERAST  There are mines of gold and silver in all  he four quarters of the world Gold and silver mines  ave been found in Norway Sweden and Hungary in  urope but the richest are those of America The  old mines of Chili are the most celebrated The ore taken from the veins of a rock with great labour Many rivers in foreign countries and even in France  oll a sand and spangles of gold which are collected  pon the shores but in very small quantities Gold  nd silver have been found mixed with ores in the  ines of England but not in sufficient quantity to  nswer the expence of separating Gold is the most  eavy the most ductile the most tenacious

length  EUGEN  Wonderful Has there never been found a  ethod of making gold  ERAST  Projectors have often attempted it but  uld never succeed This is called searching for the  losopher's stone It has been said lately that Dr  ce of Guildford succeeded in his endeavours this  y by mixing quicksilver with other materials but  t the expence in obtaining it was more than the  ue of the gold so

whatDo you suppose that I woul  deceive youIt is by such gaping surprize that th  ignorant and unexperienced become ridiculous At t  least extraordinary thing you see them struck wi  wonder All that goes beyond the reach of their c  pacity all they have not seen they conceive to  impossible There are Eugenius to sorts of fools those who believe every thing and those who believe nothing To believe that which is impossible and co  trary to reason is a stupid credulity To reject extraordinary things which may be true though perhap  improbable because we have not seen them or b  cause we do not comprehend them is an affectation strongly marked with obstinacy and ignorance Be pe  suaded my dear fellow that I am neither a deceive nor a boaster I am not even one of those who belie  every thing

consider the different uses to which forest trees are put they are more necessary than fruit trees  ERAST  They certainly are But what refreshment that delicates do fruit trees afford us There are fruits  f a thousand species according to the seasons and ac  ording to the climates Plenty of common fruit helps  n feed the poor and serves the tables of the rich A repast without fruit seems to want something essential you know likewise that we extract from certain fruits  ur best liquors and on this account the vine alone those wood is scarce worth burning deferves the high  st encomiums Of the different branches of agriculture the Vine after Corn is the most considerable that which employs most hands There are a great  riety of wines which differ in colour taste quality  nd duration The best wines of France are Burgundy Champaigne and Claret Those of Spain are Malaga  erry and Mountain Port is the produce of Portu  al Old Hock of the countries adjoining the Rhine Germany and Madeira

larger than a man's head and which contain perfect fruit An excellent liquor is made from the fruit  d it affords milk for children We find also in the same  ntry the Cacoa whose flowers give the Cocoa and  ose fruit yields the Chocolate The Coffee is another  markable tree It grows fifty feet high though its  ok is not more than four or five inches in diameter yields fruit two or three times a year in great abun  ce The best coffee is that of Moka in Arabia  ich is brought to us through Turkey though it is a cultivated in America The Tea is another re  rkable tree and is the produce of

and place in it some twigs of a tree of a d  ferent kind  ERAST  That we call grasting There are seve  ways of performing this operation one of which called budding that is taking the bud of one t

does this change of nat  operate in the body of the wild tree  ERAST  It operates by the circulation of the  or juices that flow in the body of the tree from root to its leaves It is the sap that enlivens it n  rishes and makes it grow it flows continually it parts of vegetables as the blood circulates in the b  of animals The true cause of the cirulation of sap is yet one of the mysteries of

all this immense country where all sorts of  oduction abound I do not know which to admire  ost the power or the goodness of the Creator  ERAST  Your reflexion is sensible See what a pro  gious quantity of grain the surface of the earth  esents us now near the end of harvest the most  uable part of it wheat that which constitutes the  ff of life and is the support of man is almost ga  red in The rest to be gathered such as oats beans  d the like is designed for the feed of beasts  But take notice of the profound wisdomof the Creat  in the fruitfulness of the plains in general We have so

wonderful variety there even in the form of her productions No  plant not a leaf resembles each other If we reflect on that prodigious fruitfulness which the Creator has bestowed upon the seed of each plant to perpetuate its species we shall find it a miracle It is calculated that a single Elm has in its body more than millions of germs very dislinct each germ containing an Elm which again contains a like quantity for reproduction Let us now proceed to an examination of  nimals  EUGEN  I am eager for the task This part of the works of the Almighty will afford us variety of observations How extensive it is Having discoursed of  ishes it remains to enquire into birds insects and  ourfooted beasts  ERAST  You begin Eugenius to know the prin  ipal difference which characterizes the animal race Those which swim those which fly those which creep and those which walk As we yesterday examined  he first class let us now run through the three others beginning with birds  Animals in general are naturally endowed with  particular instinct to know how to conduct themselves  o seek their own good to foresee and avoid danger to  t  ach themselves to their own species and to perpe  ate it They are sensible of pleasure pain love  atred jealousy friendship and frequently even of  ratitude in short this instinct is so certain and so wonderful that we are often led to think it reason Was I to speak of all birds I should tire you with the  etail I will therefore confine myself to those which  re remarkable  Those birds then which live upon flesh we call  arnivorous  and those which prey upon others  rapa  ous  EUGEN  Why is the Eagle called the king of birds  s it larger than all the rest  ERAST  No but it is the fiercest the most cou  agious and the strongest for its size It is also a  ery swift flier There are several species of them In  gure this bird resembles a Parrot it has a curved  ll short feet with very stong hooked talons It  as a piercing eye lives a long time and is an inhabitant  of cold countries The Eagle chooses the top of the highest trees or the clifts of the steepest rocks to build its nest in There are a great many of thes  birds in the North of Scotland and in the mountain of Switzerland The largest species of this bird ha  strength enough to take up a sheep or a child A peasant once knocked one down with a pole that woul  have taken away a child of five years old  EUGEN  It is then a very dangerous bird I su  pose there are more voracious birds  ERAST  We reckon birds of prey among this clas  Such as Hawks of which there are several kinds di  ferent in size in plumage and in swiftness These a  continually at war with other birds Would you b  lieve it There is a species of these rapacious birds  example the Goshawk and Falcon which they tu  out in pursuit of game they train them up for  purpose a man carries them upon his wrist and wh  and bird is in view he lets the Hawk loose who fl  after the bird darts down upon it and brings it his master in his talons who then treats the Ha  with the entrails of the bird it has caught for its pai  This sport is a royal diversion But among the c  nivorous birds there is one more terrible still  EUGEN  Is it possible What is it  ERAST  The Contor It is a bird of Peru perhaps the largest in the world They have been s  when flying to be more than thirty feet across  wings Judge of the strength of this tyrant of air When it has appeared it has frightened w  herds of cattle and their herdsmen It has a b  calculated to rip open the belly of an ox Tw  them will destroy an ox I have been told they devour children ten or twelve years old But b  act of Providence this destructive bird is very  The female lays only sufficient eggs to perpetuat  species otherwise it would be too noxious an an  There is one in the collection of the Royal Socie  London which was killed at Chili by some peop  the suite of an English gentleman  EUGEN  Let us drop the subject of these birds they make me shudder and let me kno  there is not some equally curious though not so mischievous  ERAST  I could name many for example the Cassiowary one of the tallest and largest birds in India I have seen one in the king of France's Museum more than five feet high The Cassiowary is remarkable for its long black shining feathers that resemble hair but of all birds the tallest is the Ostrich common in Africa although its body is rather small The Ostrich like the Cassiowary does not fly but both are so swift of foot that i  is difficult to keep up with them even on the fleetest horses Ostrich feathers are large and beautiful We dye them of various colours and use them for ornament its down or hair serves to make hats or bonnets This bird like many others will swallow iron flint and other hard substances in order to assist digestion but they do not digest it as people have supposed They say also erroneously that the imprudent Ostrich deposits its eggs in the sand and leaves them to the care of the sun when it is certain that they sit on them in the night though they leave them in the day knowing that burning heat of the climate is sufficient to hatch them  Among our European birds you have seen the Peacock so remarkable for the beauty of its plumage  EUGEN  and the horridness of its cry I hate the bird on this account  ERAST  You would not say so of the Nightingale  EUGEN  Oh no If its cloathing be not so gaudy  ts voice is enchanting There is no inhabitant of the groves that can vie with it in melody  ERAST  They say that besides its melodious notes he Nightingale has an excellent memory that it will  etain a whole song and repeat it with the same modu  tion of voice with which it was sung Having made  ou acquainted with the largest birds I will now give  ou some account of the smallest  EUGEN  What is it Sir  ERAST  The Humming bird This bird so com  on in America especially the male is a masterpiece  f nature It is wonderful not only in the variety and  reliness of its colours but also in the littleness of its  body It is not bigger than a small nut There is in Canada a species still smaller called the Birdfly which is not larger than a great fly Its flight however is extremely rapid Could you suppose it This small bird will attack a crow and beat it down from the middle of the air It is so beautiful a bird that the Indians make earrings of it  EUGEN  And the Parrot does it not merit our attention  ERAST  Certainly It is perhaps the most wonderful bird in the world Not only for the beauty of its feathers but its faculty of imitating the human voice This is a native of America They reckon more than fifty species of Parrots different in figure in size and in colour They fly in flocks and live in the forests In a cage they will eat any thing and may be fed with any thing except flesh which is not good for them  EUGEN  I should admire the Parrot beyond any bird if it was not so dirty so humoursome and so clamorous Your are doubtless acquainted with other particuarities among birds  ERAST  Shall we enter upon those of Passage who go and come according to the seasons Quails for example pass from Africa to Europe in the Spring and return towards the end of Autumn you may see them traverse the Mediteranean sea in flocks They are frequently taken on board ship where they alight to re  themselves As they love a moderate climate an  Africa is too hot in Summer they pass that season i  Europe and as the cold is too sharp here in Winter they then go to Africa There are also other birds o  passage Wild Geese and Ducks Cranes Woodcock Snipes and many more whose instinct leads them  select those countries that agree best with them So  fly in confused flocks others preserve order and t  in rows in order to cut the air the better That whi  flies first is relieved from time to time by others  It is imagined that Swallows who appear in t  Spring pass a great part of the Winter in Europ  although such as leave us about the end of Autumn frequently caught in great quantities on the decks  ships tired with flying The truth is those of the Northern countries of Europe do not go away in Winter They are found in Sweden collected in heaps hanging upon one another in a torpid state in hollow places they quicken and appear again with the first warm weather  It is very singular that all these birds foresee the time to depart collect themselves together fly night and day and go to the place designed without wandering Where is the traveller who in so long a journey would not be obliged to enquire his way  EUGEN  They are certainly directed by Providence for who but him can give so much foresight to animals  ERAST  Say not only foresight but address and sagacity You have taken notice of the structure of a bird's nest These architects have no other tools than their beaks and their feet You see however how curiously they build their houses and how carefully they line them that their callow young may lie so't What mason could build a swallow's nest which is con  tructed of mud and hangs under the eves of houses The nests of the Titmouse and Wren are masterpieces of industry The most able artist could not make one like them How wonderful is the care and exactness of all birds in sitting upon their eggs and sufficient  ngth of time to hatch their young how attentive are  ey afterwards to feed them and bring them up See  ith what resolution a Hen will defend her Chickens from a Dog Was it a Bulldog she would put it  flight  Shall I relate to you now the birds that live equally  land and by water Such have their feet webbed  at is provided with a membrane spread between their  es for the purpose of swimming They are covered  th down and feathers so compact as to keep out the  ter Some have long beaks adapted to raking in  t mud where they find their food others are fishers  d live upon fishes such as the Cormorant the King  er and others others again live upon herbs and  suction as the Waterhen and Seaduck There are  d that are enemies to the day and fly only in the  night as Owls and Bats Of all birds the Bat is the only one that does not lay eggs This is rather a flying Mouse being covered with hair and having the head and body of a mouse You have seen them I dare say It flies about at dusk and is called a Flittermouse It suckles its young and brings forth two at a time There are several species of this animal which seems to have nothing of the bird but the power of flying  EUGEN  By the detail you have given me I am now acquainted with most of the feathered tribe Will you next give me some account of Insects and Reptiles  ERAST  Nothing is more wonderful than the manner in which the Creator has peopled the universe with animals of all kinds and we may say that Insects a  vile as they may appear are one of the principal pro+ductions of nature The greatness and wisdom of God is not more conspicuous than in these little animals  There is an infinity of Insects The air the earth the waters swarm with them Some are pleasing t  look at others hideous some are useful others hurtful There are infinitely more invisible than such as we see Some fly and others crawl There is one insect the most remarkable of any and at the same time the most useful of any  EUGEN  That is I suppose the silkworm  ERAST  You are right You know that it is from this we draw that most delicated thread that compose our finest silks The silkworm was brought into Europe from the East Indies about the year its la+bour is very curious At first this insect is only th  egg of a butterfly or moth in the spring the he  hatches it and it becomes a small worm a caterpilla  which grows very fast and is nourished by the leaves  the Mulberrytree When this worm has changed i  skin three times its growth is finished it then spi  about itself a cod or pod of silk in the middle of which it forms a retreat in something like a tender shell  enclosure in which it shuts itself up thence it become a Chrysalis that is envelloped in a case and after+wards a moth or butterfly when come to this state pierces it cod and comes out some days after it la  its eggs and dies A single moth will lay more th  eggs which are preserved till the next year This metamorphosis or change is common so many kinds of insects as Caterpillars Bees and Wasps which from worms hatched from eggs become chrysales and then Flies or Flying Insects  You have no doubt taken notice of the Ant It gives us an example of industry Ants will assemble many together to draw a little piece of wood or a grain of corn to the bottom of their subterraneous granaries It has been supposed that they hoard it up in magazines to feed themselves in winter but we have known that they remain benumbed and without eating all this season heaped up upon one another in an anthill In certain countries there are larger Ants that very much incommode the inhabitants  EUGEN  And the Bees Sir is not their industry and labour very remarkable  ERAST  Very a hive of Bees has been compared to a republick where each subject labours for the common good and where all things are kept in good order There is in all hives the mother Bee which is called the queen she is larger longer and brighter coloured than the rest This mother lays all the eggs from which the whole hive of Bees are hatched She is so fruitful that in the course of a year she will sometimes give life to more than Bees The Bees have such an attachment to their queen or common parent that was she to die they would disperse or suffer themselves to perish Wherever she goes they will follow her Some men have searched for this queen Bee and having found it placed it on their arm and the whole swarm have there followed it They will not sting unless rudely treated or roughly handled When the hive it too full of Bees the young ones will swarm out and establish themselves in some other place Bees are very useful on account of the honey and the wax that they yield and which they collect from flowers and deposit in the money combs within the hive  EUGEN  You do not appear to me Sir to have described that quantity of flies and gnats which we every where see I admire very much the surprizing variety of figures and colours in Butterflies  ERAST  Would you suppose that in France they carry collections of Butterflies to a foolish excess There have been people who have ruined themselves in collecting of flies The finest Butterflies that we have seen in the cabinets of the curious are from the Indies  EUGEN  I have been often struck in the evenings with the brightness of Glowworms  ERAST  It is only in great heat of weather that Glowworms throw out this light but there are still more luminous insects in America Travellers have related that sometimes the Americans have made use of no other light in their huts and that to this day when they walk out at night they take one of these insects in their hands and fasten one to each foot These are by some called the Lanternfly They give as much light as a lamp so as to enable us to read and write by them There are other things that will give light in the dark Lobstershells Touchwood and other things And there are substances that will take fire of themselves when exposed to the air without any fire being communicated to them phosphorus for example "which i  a chemical mixture producing a powder but to retur  to our subject since we are on the subject of reptiles I will make you acquainted with one that has drawn th  attention of naturalists more than all the rest  EUGEN  Pray what is that  ERAST  The Polypus It is a little worm of the figure of a hollow tube There are several species of them This worm is sometimes taken for an aquati  plant it lengthens and contracts itself at pleasure I  breeds prodigiously and what is most astonishing contrary to the common order of animals it produces with+out the assistance of a male Cut a Polypus in five parts and each part will become a complete animal which will produce others before even the first shall be quit separated from the trunk of the old Polypus What have advanced concerning this worm is the opinion  the ancients though some moderns have supposed it  fable and to imply a republic of little animals labourin  to form a colony like the metropolis from whence the sprung  We may take notice here of another phenomenon  the reproduction of Snails Naturalists assure us that if we cut off the head of one it will not die but get a new one A learned observer of modern times published a tract containing the sentiments of many celebrated natural historians It has been said that the four horns which the Snail shoots out and draws in at pleasure are a kind of telescopes through which it sees but this observer maintains the Snail hath no eyes but that these horns are a kind of very sensible antennae which nature has given the reptile and which it puts forth to feel whether any thing approaches it If this be the case it is perhaps of all animals the only one that is deprived of sight which even the Mole is not without  EUGEN  This is very singular but how is it that men apply themselves to the study of objects so little important For my part I do not see the use of it  ERAST  I agree with you that in the study of nature there are many things which are objects of mere curiosity but the human mind is insatiable for knowledge besides when in the examination of smaller objects we seek only to contemplate the infinite wisdom of the Creator this consideration is not unuseful to man nor unworthy of him since nothing that exists is judged unworthy of the great Author of nature But let us not lose our time in reflections  EUGEN  Are there any other reptiles  ERAST  Yes and very dangerous ones especially Serpents Different countries have different species of Serpents there are some which we have no reason to dread they are so familiar Some are winged others amphibious There are some more than twenty feet long which attack and destroy the largest Quadrupeds there are water Serpents and Serpents of the sea of a prodigious size and very formidable to seamen Among other Serpents we reckon the Rattlesnake as one so dangerous and yet so common in America In Nu  nidia many persons have been destroyed by the bite of Serpents The Viper a kind of Adder is viviparous whereas all other Adders are oviparous The Asp is another species of serpent which the ancients considered is one of the most venemous They say it throws the person they bite into a lethargic state and thus destroys  him History says it was thus Cleopatra Queen of Egypt put an end to her existence that she might not fall under the power of Augustus We hardly know now to what species of Serpents to give the name of Asp but that which we call the Asp in Europe and which resembles the Viper is not venemous Besides we never fail of remedies abainst the venom of Serpents It is remarkable that in countries where there  the greatest quantity of venemous animals there  found the greatest collection of simples and counterpoisons Many of these reptiles are very useful in medicine We employ the Viper for the cure of many disorders The oil and powder of the Scorpion whose bite is mortal are excellent remedies We cure the wound made by many animals by bruising them upon the wound Viper oil is a cure for the bite of a Viper In short there is none even to the toad that is not of use in medicine Snakes have been thought venemous but there are persons who hunt them and eat them  EUGEN  Among insects is not the Spider for example poisonous  ERAST  In certain countries the Spider is very large and venemous What is related of the bite of the Tarantula is singular It is a kind of Spider very common in Calabria They pretend to say that it will make some sing others laugh and others cry and that the cure is brought about by the sound of some musical instrument which sets the patient a dancing till he faints with exercise but all this is mere trick These Spiders are no more dangerous than ours which have been eaten with safety  EUGEN  What a wonderful spinner the Spider is  How is this accounted for  ERAST  The Spider is furnished with six nipples from whence flows that matter of which its web is drawn The female Spider forms a cod of silk about its eggs In the year a person at Montpelier collecte  enough of this silk to make a pair of stockings and  pair of mittens which he sent to the academy of science at Paris  EUGEN  This discovery would not probably have  been very useful in commerce Have you finished your observations on reptiles and insects  ERAST  I shall soon have done All I would further observe is that in insects and reptiles the male is commonly smaller then the female whereas in quadrupeds it is the largest of the two I would add that by the assistance of a microscope which is an instrument that magnifies exceedingly it has been found that there is an infinity of living animals swimming in all liquors floating in the air and swarming in the earth much smaller than a handworm which the eye can scarcely discern Would you believe that in a drop of the infusion of an herb of vinegar or of blood we discover by a glass a multitude of animalcula or small animals of different kinds which move with great agility Millions of insects are spread thoughout the air where they are invisible and the eggs which they deposit in liquors are hatched there by fermentation In short when we come to consider that every one of these living atoms has eyes and the different parts of an organized body that there are in these several parts muscles nerves veins blood and all things of which an animal body consists and almost imperceptible what are we to think of the supreme artist that formed them  EUGEN  We cannot sufficiently adore his infinite powers  ERAST  But we shall have now a new motive of adoration and gratitude in his magnificence and bounty It remains that we examine into quadrupeds that is fourfooted animals He has created the greatest number to supply the wants and convenience of men They are also exceedingly varied in figure in nature and in instinct  EUGEN  Let us begin our review with those animals that are useful  ERAST  It is natural so to do Among these you must be sensible we owe the first rank to horned beasts and those which furnish us with wool How great is this benefit to man If a hen is a little treasure to him by laying as some will eggs in a year a cow is a great one she supplies us with milk with butter and with cheese and gives us each year a calf What a  consumption is there at our tables of beef and veal What is more healthy or more nourishing If we are in want of horses to cultivate the land or draw heavy burthens the ox comes to our assistance It is employed in draught in many countries Though slower it is capable of more fatigue than a horse and is fed at less expence After he has worked some years he is fatted and killed and his flesh is brought to market Neither do his services end with his life his skin tanned is valuable this gives leather In short the gall the blood the fat the bones the horns the guts the hair and even the dung of this animal is converted to some useful purpose  EUGEN  You cannot say so much of the sheep  ERAST  A agree with you as to services of strength but in every other respect this animal so timid and which seems so pitiful in itself is very valuable to man since it supplies us at the same time with food and raiment not to mention the other advantages we draw from its tallow its skin its guts and its bones The flesh of mutton is light succulent and of easy digestion The milk of the sheep is sweet and wholesome befides we know that the wool is one of the greatest objects of commerce and how much its use is extended It is different in quality and Sheep themselves vary very much in different climates we call the male of the Sheep a Ram Many Sheep have horns upon their heads some are covered with hair instead of wool In Spain the wool is much finer than with us and our best cloths are made of Spanish wool The Tails of the Sheep at the Cape of Good Hope weigh fifteen or twenty pounds and are broad enough to turn back and cover their whole backs In Tartary such tails have weighed near eighty pounds  EUGEN  You will have much to say to doubt of the Horse  ERAST  You are so well acquainted with this animal that it is needless to describe him I will observe to you only that he is endowed with a wonderful instinct The relate very singular acts of his goodnature and h  character We have heard of an old horse feeding be+tween two young ones and that the young ones chewe  his hay and oats of him and presented it to him in his manger The Horse is reckoned old at twelve years of age though he sometimes lives twenty or thirty After seven or eight years old he diminishes in value in proportion as his age advances  EUGEN  The Ass I presume deserves but little attention  ERAST  The Ass does not deserve the contempt it meets with His long ears perhaps is one cause This animal in however very useful it lives upon little and can bear a great deal of fatigue and the milk of the female is reckoned very salutary to consumptive habits In some countr  es the Ass is swiftfooted In some parts of France they run post with Asses as they do in Spain with Mules Arabian Asses are excellent for riding they get on so fast that no Horses can keep up with them  Mules are a distinct species they are engendered between an Ass and a Mare As Mules are of two natures  nited they are very rare for they never breed themselves They are reckoned very surefooted and in Spain they breed them with care and sell them at a great price  EUGEN  You have named I think the principal animals but there are more quadrupeds the one domestic as the Dog the Cat and so on others wild as the Hare the Rabbet the Goat and there are others again that are dangerous and hurtful as the Wolf the  ox the Wild BoarI hope you will speak of all in  urns  ERAST  Was I to do this I might go on till tomorrow I cannot however pass over all of the in  lence You mention the Dog for example It is  ne of the animals endowed with most perfect instinct One would even suppo  him to have reason so much understanding has he industry and sagacity One phi  sopher advances that beasts are merely machines  nother that the souls of devils lodge in the bodies of  imals but we smile at the singularity not to say the  xtravagance of their systems the Dog is of all domestick animals the most attached to men He is caressing  obedient and submissive He is not even discouraged by blows but is the more serviceable  EUGEN  That is true for I have seen six Dogs harnessed to a small loaded cart and they have drawn it in obedience to the whip of their master  ERAST  I have seen a Dog too turn a spit by putting him in a wheel that runs round but they render us greater services They hunt guard the house and the flocks of their master What fidelity they possess They are the very emblem of this virtue Many Dogs have broke their hearts and died for the loss of their master I had a Spaniel that suffered himself to die with jealousy because I placed my affections upon another little dog Many have defended the life of their master at the expence of their own others have discovered the assassin In short there  thousand remarkable things of the fidelity the address and other qualities of the Dog But let us leave him and a multitude of other animals which are spread through different countries and are natives of different climates and come to the king of animals  EUGEN  You mean the Lion  ERAST  I do Perhaps he might be better name  the tyrant of the woods We call him the King be+cause be has apparently more courage and more strength than all animals besides His air is noble and fierce When he is angry his eyes sparkle His roar alone will frighten the inhabitants of the forests Every beast flie him he is a great hunter and preys upon every anima  he seizes The Lion however is the emblem of gene+rosity as he is the symbol of courage There are man stories to prove him full of gratitude The followin  in one among the rest A Knight of Malta being o  a hunting heard some dreadful cries He advance and saw a Lion entwined with a great Serpent touche  with compassion he killed the Reptile without wounding the Lion From that moment the Lion became attache  to his deliverer and would not quit him The Knigh  being about to embark on board a ship they told hi  they had not sufficient provisions on board the vessel  take charge of the Lion They determined therefo  to leave him on the shore The animal seeing the vest  depart set up a hideous cry threw himself into the sea and swam after the ship till he could swim no longer and was drowned  EUGEN  What a wonderful act in a beast It must be allowed Sir that animals frequently set us examples of a good disposition which we do not follow so closely as they do You said the Lion was the strongest animal Is not the Elephant stronger  ERAST  Yes but then it is much larger It is the tallest and biggest of all animals It is a living colossus They have been seen more then fifteen feet high There are many Elephants in Asia and Africa but those of the East Indies are the largest The figure of an Elephant is unlike that of every other quadruped It is a heavy mass without proportion It has two great teeth on each side of its mouth which are its weapons of defence Besides this it has a long nose like a tube with which it takes up its food and which it uses as a hand The Elephant eats a great deal though it can stay seven or eight days without eating or drinking Although very heavy it is swift of foot and can gallop but it does not turn readily This animal though wild is very docile being easily tamed There is nothing to fear from it but when it is irritated We derive great services from the prodigious strength of the Elephat It will carry more than pounds Formerly they were used in war Towers full of bowmen and archers were placed upon their backs and they pushed on among the thickest  atallions men horses machines all give way to their  normous weight The greatest enemy of the Elephant is the Tiger the Lion the Rhinoceros Serpents and  specially Man by the various means he makes use of  o kill him or to tame him There are various ways of  king them Hunting the Elephant is one of the great  easures of Asiatic princes The Africans who take  im only for what he produces dig in their way holes  hich they cover over lightly and in which they fre  uently fall Others dare to attack them openly Some  onderful things are related of the instinct and cha  cter of this animal of his docility his understanding  is address his affection and gratitude for his conduc  we allow him even the sense of shame All these  qualities are the cause of the great veneration the Elephant is held in by many people At Siam officers are employed in the service of a white Elephant He is lodged in a magnificent pavilion walks under a canopy and is served in vessels of gold Eastern nations are foolish enough to believe that the soul of their emperors pass after their death into the body of an Elephant I shall close this long account with telling you that it is a longlived animal and that its great teeth yield the ivory of which so much use is made  The Rhinoceros is the most curious and after the Elephant one of the largest quadrupeds It is more than six feet high and twelve long and is said to grow fifteen years and live a hundred It carries upon it  nose a long strong horn which is sometimes double and with this it attacks and throwns down the Elephant Its horn is much sought after as many qualities are at+tributed to it as well as the blood and its very strong skin It feeds much as does the Elephant and is found in the same countries  EUGEN  Are these the only extraordinary animal  that are found in foreign countries  ERAST  I am not acquainted with all however  can name you another That is the Camel a very useful quadruped His common height is about seven feet and a half from the crown of his head which he carrie  very high He has a very small head upon a very long neck and his body is about the bigness of an Ox There are several kinds of Camels those of Arabia have a bunch upon their backs They are sometimes called Dromedaries Those of Persia has two bunches It  hair is short and soft and in the spring it falls off i  three days Of the hair are made pencil brushes fo  painting and some of the finest hats This animal i  of little use but for burthen and it will carry near pounds In order to be laden it kneels down It wil  travel from twentyfive to thirty leagues a day and wil  go near nine days without drinking The Camel eat but little and feeds upon herbs hay and the leaves o  trees It lives commonly fity years They never bea  it to make it go on the driver need only to whistle o  sing I will next mention a few strange animals o  another kind Such as are amphibious like those fishes described who live by turns on land and in water  EUGEN  If you please  ERAST  The most formidable of these animals is the Crocodile which is found on the borders of the Nile and other great rivers There are some monstrous ones  n the marshes adjoining the Ganges in the East In  ies One was taken in the island of Madagascar more  han fifty feet long and much larger have been seen History relates that there was one on the borders of the  iver Megrada in Africa a Crocodile so monstrous that  defended itself a long time against the efforts of a whole army At that period cannon were unknown  nd they could only destroy it by knocking it down with great stones which they threw at the spine of its  ack Regulus sent its skin to Rome and it was more  han eighty feet long The Crocodile has short feet  nd its body is covered with scales as hard as to resist  on  EUGEN  What a strange beast Is the Crocodile as mischievous as it is hideous  ERAST  It will devour both men and animals when  seizes them it is very artful in obtaining its prey it  ides itself and imitates a plaintive cry to attract pas  engers Hence it is we say affected distress is only Crocodile's tears  EUGEN  Such monsters may commit great ravages Does it multiply fast  ERAST  No Providence has wisely prevented this  has taken care to give being to two other animals  qually amphibious who are mortal enemies to the Crocodile One is the Hippopotamus or SeaHorse This animal is as large as an Ox with a head some  hing resembling a Horse its skin is an inch thick and  hard that a musquet ball will scarce penetrate it  is one of the most furious of amphibious creatures  nd has terrible teeth with which it attacks the Croco  le The other is the Ichneumon or the Egyptian  at which is something less then a Co  This little  nimal is so mischievous that it attacks Serpents Dogs  nd even Camels It devours young Crocodiles and  estroys their eggs which it finds in the sand It is on  account of the essential service it renders in preventing too great an increase of Crocodiles that the ancient people of Egypt have ranked the Ichneumon in the number of their Gods But I must dwell no longer on animals We will finish with the Beaver  EUGEN  Is that an amphibious animal  ERAST  Yes and is one of the most remarkable and at the same time one of the most sagacious animal in providing for its safety and convenience The Beaver  is truly an architect They are more industrious than either the Bee or the Ant They build houses upon land opposite to the current of great rivers with stake and cement and that with an art and cleverness that i  astonishing And yet they have no other instruments fo  this purpose then their teeth their feet and their tail  Their tail which is flat and large serves them for a trowel Their teeth is their saw and with their feet they brea  and soften the clay Beavers work and live in societie  with a wonderful order and police They procure the  a supply of food at the approach of winter which the pass shut up in their cabins Beaver hair makes fine hat  EUGEN  What a prodigious number of animals the  are of all kinds It is however to be lamented th  there are so many dangerous ones I think the Creat  should not have given birth to them or at least shou  have endued them with better qualities  ERAST  It is presumed that at the Creation th  were endowed with a better disposition The Lion a  the Tiger were about of first parents without givi  them the least dread of their doing harm No anim  would have been savage had Adam and Eve not sinne  Their revolt against God occasioned that of anim  against men Some of these animals trouble him  sects incommode him and all this is the unhappy  +sequence of sin However let it be remarked that an effect of the goodness of our Supreme Parent  +chievous animals encrease much less than those wh  are useful and that we have at all times means of p  +serving ourselves from the former  EUGEN  You must permit me Sir to make one  +flection more That which I admire most in the cond  of the Creator is the manner in which animals per  tuate  their species but I do not know how it is that corruption engenders worms  ERAST  Corruption does not engender them It is  n old error which has deceived you Nothing can spring from putrefaction if it did we should see every+day new animals which is not the case The Creator  n forming the world established a general and immutable law in all things and by this law every animal engenders or begets its like and will do so to the end of time Thus all animals proceed from their father and mother This is sufficiently to be seen in the larger  nimals If we observe occasionally swarms of insects  ise from the midst of putrefaction it is as I have told  ou that female insects of the same species have there deposited their eggs and that heat warming them fer  entation has hatched them Natural instinct teaches  nsects to choose out those substances readiest to corrupt  nd of course best adapted to supply their young with  ood as soon as hatched Be assured this is the case There is none but uninformed persons who suppose the contrary but it is time to finish I see we are close upon the town  EUGEN  We have in imagination made a very large  ourney for in two days we have run through the hea  ens the earth and the waters in short through the  hole course nature We have cast a rapid eye over  he works of God and nearly in the order they were  reated  ERAST  And for what my dear Eugenius do you suppose all these wonders were produced  EUGEN  For you for me in short for man  ERAST  You say right God having produced all out of nothing would next give being to a creature that  hould surpass the whole He could not create him  reater or more noble than after his own image in  oing this he employed only his will he made no use of his hands but took a little earth breathed into it the  reath of life and man became a living foul a moment  fter he gave him a companion and these were the first  air So done he made him king and master of all that  he earth and sea produces  DISCOURSE VII ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THIS COUNTRY THE PARLIAMENT NOBILITY CLERGY AND MAGISTRATES  EUGEN  I Very much long Sir that you should give me some account of the Constitution of this country for I think not to be acquainted with the nature of the government under which we live is disgraceful to a man of any understanding  ERAST  It certainly is and as you have a desire t  know I will do my best to inform you  Political writers of antiquity will allow but three regular forms of government  Democracy Aristocracy  and  Monarchy  When the sovereign power is lodged in a  assembly of all the free members of a community it is called a  Democracy  when in a council composed of select members an  Aristocracy  and when entrusted in the hand of a single person it is stiled a  Monarchy  EUGEN  What are the advantages of each kind o  government  ERAST  In a Democratic state which is a republican government where the right of making laws rests in th  people at large public virtue or uprightness of intention is most likely to be found but though public spirit and a degree of patriotism is generally to be found in the assemblies of the people such assemblies are of ten abusurd in their contrivance and weak in their execution  In aristocratic governments they being composed o  intended so to be of the most experienced citizens an  men of the greatest property more wisdom is to be ex+pected but less honesty and less strength than in a mo+narchy for where the government is vested in a few men will be apt to consider their own interest  A monarchy of course is the most powerful of any being a conjunction of the powers that make laws an  carry them into execution placed in the hands of the  rince but in monarchies there is danger of the prince's  mploying those powers to impolitic or oppressive pur  oses Thus have these three species of government their several perfections and imperfections  EUGEN  Of what kind then is the British Constitions  ERAST  It is a mixture of the whole has all the per  ctions of one without the imperfections of either  r the executive power that is the power of carrying  e laws into execution being lodged in a single person  instance in the king the laws have all the advan  ges of strength and dispatch to be found in the most absolute monarchy and the legislature or power of  aking laws being entrusted to three distinct powers  ally independent of each other namely King Lords  d Commons the Lords being an aristocratical assembly of persons selected for their piety their wisdom their valour and their property and the House of commons being a kind of democracy chosen by repre  nting the people at large who are a body actuated by  frent springs and attentive to different interests no convenience is to be dreaded from either each power  ving a negative voice so as to contradict and oppose  it pleases any improper or dangerous innovation or  croachment of the other two  The executive power then in our constitution that is  power of enforcing the laws is vested in the king  ne who is of course the supreme magistrate but the  gislative power that of making these laws rests in the  ng Lords and Commons which is the parliament  Great Britain  EUGEN  Must a law or an act of Parliament then  e the concurrence of King Lords and Commons  ERAST  Yes otherwise it would be no law Thus  n see that the Commons are a check upon the Lords  d the Lords upon the Commons by the privilege each  of rejecting what the other has resolved whilst the  g is a check upon both preserving thus the execu  e power from incroachment Nay the two Houses  Parliament Lords and Commons have a privilege  calling the King's evil ministers and counsellors to  account and punishing them for any had conduct checking thus the executive power itself  EUGEN  Of what does the House of Lords consist  ERAST  Of the Spiritual and Temporal Lords of t  realm The Spiritual Lords are the two Archbishop and twentyfour Bishops the Temporal Lords are  the Dukes Marquisses Earls Viscounts and Baron whose number may be increased at the will of the Kin  Sixteen of these Lords or Peers are chosen by the Pee  of Scotland and sit as their representatives since the uni  of the two kingdoms The other Peers sit there virtue of their peerage  EUGEN  When did the union take place  ERAST  In the year Before this time a se  rate Parliament was always held in Scotland as ther  in Ireland for on the death of queen Elizabeth in  James I then king of Scotland became by success king of England and the two nations belonged to  same crown By an agreement therefore in  +tween the Parliament of England and that of Scotla  the two nations were united under one Parliament  that of Scotland was abolished so that the Peers Scotland elect sixteen Lords to represent them in  Parliament and the people of Scotland elect fortymembers that sit in our House of Commons to repre  the Commons of Scotland Ireland has a Parliam  of its own as Scotland had before the union  EUGEN  Are there not more Lords than sit in Par  ment  ERAST  None sit in our House of Lords but the P  of England The Irish Peers sit in their own coun  but not here none of the Scotch Peers sit but the  +teen chosen ones and as to other Lords the titles  merely titular being the sons and brothers only of Pe  EUGEN  Of what does the House of Commons  +sist  ERAST  The Commons of England consist of all men of property throughout the kingdom as have sears in the House of Lords every one of whom  vote in Parliament but as the people of England too numerous to assemble to do business in one p  certain districts choose two Representatives who  n Parliament and vote for them These districts are  he counties cities and borough towns The counties  re represented by persons who have pounds a year  land chosen by the freeholders that is men who possess a free estate of not less than forty shillings a year  nd those persons when elected are called  knights of the  ire  or county and represent the landed property of the  ingdom The cities and borough towns are repre  nted by persons possessing an estate not less than three  undred pounds a year elected by the freemen of those  ties and towns that is by the mercantile part of the  eople and those persons so elected are called  Burgesses  o that the House of Commons with the fortyfive mem  ers elected by the people of Scotland consists of five  undred and fiftyeight The President or Chairman of the Parliament is called the  Speaker  EUGEN  How often are these people chosen  ERAST  Once in seven years but the King has a  rivilege to dissolve the Parliament when he pleases  nd they never meet till he thinks proper to call them  ogether  EUGEN  Suppose he was never to call them  ERAST  Then there could be no Parliament In  ormer times the nation has been without a Parliament  or many years but as the King now cannot establish  ny tax or raise any money without the consent of the  eople or Parliament and as money is always wanted for  he purposes of Government he finds it necessary to call  he Parliament together every year King Charles the  irst made an attempt to raise money without the con  nt of the People or Parliament and the consequence  as that the People and the King went to war the King  as taken prisoner by the Parliaments army and be  eaded This was in the year  EUGEN  Do the Members of each House vote ac  ording to their consciences  ERAST  They ought to do so but it is a doubt  hether they always do or not The King has such a  umber of valuable appointments in his gift places of  ofit and power which are generally given to the Mem  ers of both Houses of Parliament and which he can  ke away again at his pleasure that he generally commands  a majority of votes in both Houses and it is th  influence of the Crown that makes the people diss  tisfied for when the King can influence the Member  of the House of Commons he can induce them to fu  nish him with any sums of money he pleases be it ev  so opposite to the inclinations of the people they repr  sent and this has too often been done and is call  venality  EUGEN  And have the people no redress  ERAST  None but that of turning out the Me  ber who voted so contrary to their wishes at the ne  new Parliament  EUGEN  And do they  ERAST  Very seldom for these members profit  their situation and find it their interest to bribe the pe  ple to elect them again Some gentlemen will spe  from pounds to pounds to gain a seat  Parliament and this money goes among the Electo  Indeed the members of the House of Commons lose th  seat there upon taking a place or office under gove  ment but the influence of money is such that they  themselves rechosen  EUGEN  But there should be a law to punish th  who bribe the Electors  ERAST  So there is but they generally find mea  to evade that law  EUGEN  I have heard of  Torys  and  Whigs  W  are they  ERAST  By  Tory  is understood the party in fav  of the King and by  Whig  that in favour of the Peo  Two names of reproach first given in the last century  EUGEN  Do not Judges sit in the House of Peers  ERAST  Yes but they have no vote they sit th  only to give their advice in matters of law when t  advice is asked for  EUGEN  What are their salaries  ERAST  The Chief Justice of the King's Bench pounds a year the Chief Justice of the Com  Pleas pounds the Chief Baron of the Exche  pounds and the puisne or under Judges  pounds a year each  Ev  when formerly there was no other religion in the Country  ERAST  Because they experienced the inconveniences and became sensible of the absurdities of this religion Until the year when Henry VIII shook off the Pope's power over the people of this kingdom the established religion in Great Britain and Ireland was the Romish but the people examining into the nature of it discovering its many errors and finding the King as ready as they were to introduce the Protestant religion which had at this time gained a footing in Germany the Parliament cooperated with him in reforming the church and altering the religion of the country This event is called the  Reformation  EUGEN  Why was the Reformed Religion called the  Protestant  ERAST  Because at the Diet or Assembly of the German States at Spires in several  protested  against a decree of the Diet to support the doctrines of the church of Rome  EUGEN  It does not appear that all the people of England are of the same opinion for there are many Dissenters from the church of England  ERAST  There are and these are Presbyterians Anabaptists Quakers and Methodists  EUGEN  And what distinction is there between them  ERAST  To enter into all the distinctions would take up a great deal of time The great ones are that the Presbyterian doctrine excludes Episcopacy that is admits of no Bishops nor any form of prayer and is the established religion of Scotland Anabaptists will not admit of Infant Baptism but baptise their followers when at full age Quakers admit of no preachers but such as think themselves inspired they are called Quakers from their affecting to quake when the Spirit a suppoted to give them utterance at other times they are silent at their meetings and as to the Methodists they pretend to profess purer doctrines than those of the church of England but they are all Protestants notwithstanding and deny the authority of the Pope and of  e church of Rome  EUGEN  There is no variety of religion in Roman Catholic countries Why is there here  ERAST  Because those States will not suffer it but it is one of the blessing of our constitution to be indulged in a liberty of conscience All religions are allowed here even the Roman Catholic in private chapels and under certain restrictions and this general indulgence is called  Toleration  from their being here tolerated But we are wandering from the subject we were upon that of the duty and privileges of the King of England His duty I told you His privileges are as follow  The King is the chief and sole magistrate of the nation can of his own authority reject any act of Parliament presented to him for signing and in such cases it never passes into a law he can make any treaty with foreign powers create any Peers and pardon any offence except where the constitution interferes The King can also make war and peace without the consent of his Parliament but though he can declare war he cannot carry it on without money and this money he cannot get without the people's consent this therefore obliges him never to make war but with the approbation of Parliament He has the appointment of Ambassadors to foreign Courts who represent the King that sends them and protect their countrymen when occasion requires it  The King is considered as the head of the Church Army and the Navy and as such has the appointmen  of all the Bishops and Officers He is also considered as the fountain of honour and of course confers all titles  EUGEN  How is the King ans his family supportedâ–ª Has he any estates of his own  ERAST  As Elector of Hanover he has a prett  considerable revenue but not sufficient to support hi  and his dignity as King of England there are som  estates in this country that belong to him as King b  his chief support is from the people of whom he  obliged when he comes to the Crown to ask for a b  coming maintenance the Parliament are always read to support his dignity for the honour of the Crown an  at this time they allow him annually pounds a Year out of which he pays all the State Officers the Judges and all the expences of his family And whenever any of his children arrive at manhood Parliament always makes a separate provision for them the Prince of Wales has pounds a year  EUGEN  The taxes I presume are appropriated to the expences of government and to pay the interest of the National debt  ERAST  They are  EUGEN  Can you give me a general account of the taxes  ERAST  The first great tax is a Land Tax by which gentlemen who have estates pay four shillings in the pound or pounds out of every pounds this with the tax upon Malt raises about pounds  There is next a tax on the exportation and importation of Merchandize This is conducted by the Commissioners of the Customs  Then there is an Excise duty that is a tax on Beer Cyder Perry Spirits Silks Linens Starch HairPowder Carriages things sold by Auction travelling in Post Chaises Men Servants Coffee Tea Chocolate Wines Paper Vinegar Glass Hops Candles Soap Leather Malt and a variety of other articles These are under the controul of the Commissioners of Excise  Another tax is four shillings and twopence on every bushel of Salt  Another are the Stamp duties under the Commissioners of the Stamp Office This is a tax on Writings relative to LawSuits and agreements of every kind upon Almanacks NewsPapers Advertisements Pamphlets Cards and Dice Receipts and Bills of Exchange  There are others upon Houses and Windows Hackney Coaches and Chairs within the Bills of Mortality Le  acies and one shilling in the pound out of all salaries  nd perquisites of Offices and Pensions paid by the Crown  EUGEN  What do you mean by the Bills of Mor  lity  ERAST  These are accounts or registers kept by the Clerks of every parish within the cities and suburbs of  London and Westminster specifying the numbers born married and buried annually of course by within the bills I mean within the districts where these registers are kept  EUGEN  A very useful institution Pray what do the taxes amount to in the whole  ERAST  To upwards of ten millions of pounds annually  EUGEN  What an enormous sum  ERAST  Having now given you an account of the Chief Magistrate shall I make you acquainted with such as are below him  EUGEN  If you please  ERAST  The Sheriff of the county then is the first His office is that of Chief Gaoler and he has the custody of all criminals and delinquents in the district within his command Though I call him Chief Goaler he is by virtue of his office for the time being the first man in the county and ranks before every nobleman therein There is one presiding over every county and is appointed by the King out of the gentlemen resident in that county The county prison and the keeper of that prison are under his controul and it is his duty to execute the sentence of the law upon all criminals himself or to find one to do it for him though that sentence extend even to death Most gentlemen aspire to the office of Sheriff though it is attended with the expence of or pounds for the year they serve There are two Sheriffs for the City of London chosen by the City  The next officer to the Sheriff is the Coroner Every county has more than one Some have four some six according to the extend of the county He is chosen by the freeholders and his office is for life though he may be removed for misconduct His duty is to enquire into the death of such as are killed die suddenly or in prison he has fees upon the occasion so that his place is a place of emolument  The next order of subordinate Magistrates are Justices of the Peace the chief of whom is the  Custos Retulorum  or the keeper of the county records  EUGEN  Can any one be a Justice of Peace  ERAST  No Hemust have a property of pounds a year to qualify him and is appointed by the Lord Chancellor at the recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant of the county  EUGEN  What is the Lord Lieutenant  ERAST  He is generally some man of rank in the county and is appointed by the King during the pleasure of the Crown  EUGEN  What is his office  ERAST  He acts under the King in a military capacity Besides appointing the Magistrates for the county he appoints all the Officers in the county Militia and is himself the Colonel and in case of any invasion by a foreign enemy would take the military command of the county This is held to be a very honourable employ and is much coveted by men of the first rank  EUGEN  You have frequently mentioned  rank  is it of any use to a man  ERAST  Of great use Precedence in rank is more attended to by great people then you are aware of Precedence generally takes place in the following order Princes Archbishops Dukes Marquisses Earls Viscounts Bishops Barons Knights of the Garter Privy Counsellors Judges Baronets Knights of the Bath Knights Doctors Esquires and Gentlemen The nobility are very particular to preserve their rank on all public occasions and you will find a title respected every where Besides if there are any offices of profit in government the church the army or the navy the nobility can procure them for themselves or their relations in preference to other people and all the departments about the King are commonly filled with them And add to this they have a number of privileges A Peer like a Member in the House of Commons cannot be arrested and thrown into prison for debt they have  ll their post letters free of expence and can frank or free the letters of others A peer if guilty of a criminal act is tried always by the House of Lords and can command an audience of the King at any time that  can see him and speak to him without fearing to be  refused admittance and they as well as Clergymen receiving the benefit of clergy are not burnt in the hand  EUGEN  I do not comprehend what you mean by Benefit of Clergy  ERAST  What is called  Benefit of Clergy  had its rise in the pious reverence of christian princes for the church in its infant state being an institution to exempt the Clergy from being criminally proceeded against by secular or lay judges Popish exclesiastics soon made an ill use of this for they afterwards claimed this indulgence not only for themselves but for all attendants upon the church whether they were Clergymen or not and in length of time this exemption grew general and all who could read had the same indulgence reading being a great mark of learning in those days of ignorance till an act of Parliament of Henry VII made a distinction between Laymen and Clergymen subjecting the former for certain crimes deserving death to be burnt with a hot iron on the left thumb and denying them this privilege a second time and they are now not even required to read but the indulgence is generally granted to all persons both men and women Clergymen however if found guilty of such offences as claim this benefit of clergy are not burnt in the hand but immediately discharged and this as often as they offend whereas others suffer death for the second offence and as to Peers when found guilty they are discharged without burning in the hand but if condemned for the same offence of second time will like other laymen suffer death  EUGEN  How do persons procure title  ERAST  By interest that is to say by their influence with the King or the Ministers of State and sometimes by services which they have done the State  EUGEN  Of what kind is this influence  ERAST  Many Gentlemen from their extensive property can command the votes of freeholders and freemen of towns which send members to parliament of course they can appoint such members and these members will naturally give their vote as the person shall direct to whom they owe their seat in the House of Commons The King therefore will often bestow a  title upon the Gentleman who appoints those members in order to obtain  votes but titles are frequently given for services done to the State for example to great Statesmen Generals Admirals and men learned in the Law The Chancellor is always made a Peer which generally adds two or three to the House of Lords every reign and sometimes the Judges are made Peers  EUGEN  I do not at all wonder then that men of great fortune are ambi  ious to be created Peers if so much respect is due to their rank Are there any more public offices besides those you have named  ERAST  Yes but the next are of lower order I think the next is the  Constable  of which there are two degrees High and Petty High Constables are appointed by the Bench of Justices at the Quarterly Sessions of the Peace which are held quarterly at the principal town in the county for the administration of justice in matters of small concern They preside over a district called a hundred consisting of several parishes Petty Constables are inferior officers in every town and parish selected by the High Constables from the Parishioners and are subordinate to the High Constables They are appointed by two Justices to serve one year the duty of a Constable is to keep good order in the parish and for this purpose he can take up disorderly persons confine them and carry them before a Magistrate This office is not held very reputable and frequently those that are appointed for all must serve in their turn will pay a fine or sum of money to be excused serving in this case another takes the office  The next public officers are the Surveyors of the Highway  EUGEN  What are these  ERAST  Every parish is bound to keep the High Roads through it in repair except the Turnpike Roads and Surveyors are appointed to see this business properly done There are generally two in every parish appointed out of the substantial inhabitants by two neighbouring Justices of the Peace  The last officers I shall now mention are the Over  ers of the Poor Till the reign of Henry VIII the  Poor subsisted throughout England upon private charity but under Queen Elizabeth Overseers in every parish were appointed from substantial housekeepers yearly in Easter week by two neighbouring Justices Their duty is to raise money in the parish by collecting from every one in proportion to the rent of the house lives in for the relief of their own Poor who are not able to work and to provide work for such as  are  able and cannot get employ  EUGEN  Now you mention poor Sir I could wish to know what Gipsies are  ERAST  Gipsy is a corruption of Egyptian These are a peculiar race of people supposed to come originally from Egypt and to be endowed with the gift of Prophecy they made their appearance first in Germany about but have been since banished from all parts of Europe What are called Gipsies now are a set of vagabond poor who live in the open air wandering about in companies from one part of the country to another pretending to tell silly people their fortunes and subsisting wholly upon plunder they are liable by our laws to be taken up and if they have cheated any one of money to be hanged  EUGEN  You have omitted to speak of the ChurchWardens  ERAST  I shall speak of them after I have mentioned the Clergy for ChurchWardens are officers of the Church  EUGEN  I beg your pardon are you going to speak of the Clergy now  ERAST  I am the people are divided into two classes The Clergy and the Laity The Clergy being an order of men set apart to attend the service of God have certain privileges allowed them Among the rest one is not to be liable to serve temporal ofices as Sheriff Constable Overseer and the like but then they have certain disabilities on account of their spiritual avocations they are incapable of sitting in the House of Commons nor can any Rector or Vicar take any lands to farm or follow any way of business  EUGEN  Some of the Clergy do hold farms not withstanding  ERAST  They are allowed to hold sufficient land to maintain their families and under this pretence will often buy and sell like other farmers but they are liable to pay ten pounds a month to the King for so doing  EUGEN  Are there not several ranks of Clergymen  ERAST  Several Archbishops Bishops Deans Prebendaries Archdeacons Parsons Vicars and Curates  EUGEN  Shall I trouble you to describe them  ERAST  England is divided into two provinces over each of which presides an Archbishop Three of the Bishopricks Durham Chester and Carlisle are subject to the Bishop of York and the other twentyone to the Archbishop of Canterbury An Archbishop is the head of the Clergy in his whole province and governs the Bishops as well as the inferior Clergy At the command of the King he calls the Bishops and Clergy of his province to meet in convocation All the Bishops have some livings more or less to give away among the Clergy and when a Clergyman of any parish dies of which the Church is in the gi  t of the Bishop if the Bishop does not dispose of it in six months the Archbishop has the giving of it away he can grant a licence to a Clergyman that is a master of Arts in one of our Universities to hold two livings and he can grant special licences to marry at any place or at any time he has also the privilege of conferring a Doctor's or other degree in the same manner as do the Universities  EUGEN  What cannot people be married when and where they please  ERAST  Not without the Bishop's licence which costs ten pounds The laws obliges people to be married at their own Parish Church and between eight and twelve in the morning  EUGEN  You mentioned his calling the Clergy to convocation What is that  ERAST  The Convocation is a Parliament in miniature the upper house consisting of the Bishops represents the House of Lords in which the Archbishop of Canterbury presides as King and with Royal State the lower house is composed of representatives chosen by the Clergy Rectors and Vicars in the several Archdeaconries  and by the Prebendaries of the several Cathedrals resembling the House of Commons with its Knights and Burgesses  EUGEN  What business do they do and how often do they meet  ERAST  They meet as often as the Parliament does but meet only to disperse again for they have no sooner chosen their Prolocutor or Chairman than the King prorogues them or prevents their continuance They formerly settled the business of the church but being found to enter into matters that did not concern them the King has never suffered them to do any business since the year The form is still preferved as being part of the constitution of this country But to return  A Bishop as well as an Archbishop besides the power of ordaining Clergymen and other holy ordinances has authority to inspect the manners of the Laity as well as of the Clergy and punish delinquents by ecclesiastical censures to this end they hold courts of Civil Law  EUGEN  How are Bishops appointed and in what manner do their revenues arise  ERAST  Bishops and Archbishops are chosen by the Chapter of their Cathedrals that is by the Dean and Prebendaries belonging to the Cathedral but they are obliged to choose such persons as the Kind recommends Their revenues arise from the great tithes of several Vicarages in their gift and from lands appropriated to the bishoprick  EUGEN  What are these tithes  EUGEN  Tithes are the tenth part of the produce of the lands lying in each parish which time out of mind have been the property of the Rector or Parson of the parish but for the maintenance of the Bishops several of these Rectories have been converted into Vicarages that is the tithes have been divided and the great tithes as corn hay and such things as are most valuable have been appropriated to the use of the Bishops and the smaller tithes as milk fruit c have been settled on the Clergymen who served the Church and whom the Bishop appoints such Clergymen are called  Vicars  Whereas such as have all the tithes of a parish both  great and small are called  Rectors  or Parson Rectors also have generally some land annexed to their houses the Vicars little or none of course rectories are of great annual value from forty pounds ayear to hundred pounds ayear and often not so much as twenty pounds  EUGEN  You tell me that the great tithes of a parish are the property of the Rector how is it then that some have fallen into Lay hands for I have a relation who gives away the living to a Clergyman but who receives the great tithes himself  ERAST  This originated among the Friars before the Reformation when there were societies of Roman Catholic Clergymen living together in one house called  Convents  as many now do in France and Spain and other countries in the same manner as I have told you the Fellows live together in the several Colleges in our Universities By consent of the King they begged and bought all the Church livings within their reach appropriating the tithes to the use of themselves and giving a Priest some small stipend or the small tithes for serving the Church who was thence called a Vicar which means a substitute Now at the Reformation when the Popish religion was abolished the monas  eries were dissolved or broken up and these appropriations or great tithes vested in the King who afterwards granted them to private persons not Clergymen who have from time to time sold them or disposed of them to whom they thought proper These appropriations from being improperly in the hands of Laymen are called  Impropriations  Crown lands and obey lands were ever exempt from paying tithes  ch lands therefore to this day continue tithefree  EUGEN  What are firstfruits and tenths  ERAST  The first fruits of living were the whole  ofits of the first year according to a rate settled in  and originally paid to the Pope The tenths were a tenth part of the annual income of each living  the same valuation At the Reformation the y were  nexed to the Crown and that valuation made by  hich the Clergy are now rated but by the bounty of  Queen Ann all livings under fifty pounds ayear are discharged of these payments and what others pay is vested in Trustees for ever as a perpetual fund for the augmentation of poor livings  EUGEN  I should like to know how it happened that several noblemen and gentlemen have one or more livings in their gift  ERAST  I will explain this by and by to do it now would be breaking in upon the order in which I proposed to describe to you the several officers of the Church  EUGEN  I will interrupt you no more  ERAST  Before either Rectors or Vicars I should have mentioned a Dean and Chapter The Dean with the Chapter of the Cathedral Church that is the Canons or Prebendaries which are Clergymen that attend the service of the Cathedral are the Bishop's counsel to assist him with advice in matters of religion or the temporal concerns of his bishoprick most of the Deans are appointed by the King and some few by the Bishop of the diocese It is the same with the Prebendaries some of whom are nominated by the King and others by the Bishops  The next person to be mentioned is the Archdeacon This is also a clerical officer is subordinate to the Bishop of the diocese and is appointed by the Bishop but has a kind of episcopal authority independent of him It is the province and duty of a Bishop to hold a visitation in the several parts of his diocese that is to go round his bishoprick once in three years to confirm the children inspect the manners of the Clergy so that the churches are kept in order and that every religious instruction is properly attended This I say th  Bishop does once in three yars but the Archdeaco  does it every year except the year the Bishop attend The Archdeacon has also a court for trying spiritu  offences and punishing them with spiritual censures there are one or more Archdeacons in every bishop  according to the extent of it  Rectors and Vicars I have mentioned The Cu  is an officating Minister assisting the Rector or Vic  for which be is paid a stipend of about fifty pounds year  EUGEN  That is a small salary considering the great incomes of some livings What do the revenues of Bishops and Deans generally amount to  ERAST  The Archbishoprick of Canterbury is pounds ayear that of York pounds and the several Bishops including livings they sometimes hold have from pounds to pounds Deaneries are from about pounds ayear to about pounds and Prebends from about pounds ayear to pounds So much then for the Clergy I have now only to explain the inferior offices of the church  viz  ChurchWardens Parish Clerks and Sextons  There are generally two Churchwardens chosen for every parish one by the inhabitants and one by the Rector or Vicar these are the Guardians of the church and the representatives of the body of parishioners Their duty is to keep the church in repair and collect money from the parishioners in proper proportions for that purpose and they with the Overseers have also the management of the poor  Parish Clerks are generally appointed by the Rector or Vicar and are sworn into their office by the Archdeacon their duty is to attend the Minister in the offices of the church  EUGEN  I have been told that Parish Clerks are often Clergymen  ERAST  In parishes where the office of Clerk is worth a Clergyman's notice it is sometimes given to persons in holy orders but they never officiate as Clerk but appoint a deputy to do the duty  Sextons are persons that toll the bell dig the graves and keep the churches clean and quite during divine service  EUGEN  Now Sir you have gone through the whole permit me to remind you of giving me an account how the gift of livings fell into Lay hands when I think they should be in the disposal of the Bishop  ERAST  Though Laymen may be the patrons of livings that is have the gift of the church yet the Bishop has the examination of the persons appointed whether he has sufficient learning and whether he be  man of good character or not If he is found to be an  improper person the Bishop can reject him and Patrons must nominate another But now for an answer to your question  To make you rightly understand the nature of  Patronage  I must first acquaint you with the origin of Manors  EUGEN  I am all attention  ERAST  Manors are as ancient as the Saxon Constitution which was general in this country before the year when it was conquered by King William I A Manor consisted of a certain district or extent of land the extent of one or more parishes or perhaps but part of one the usual residence of the owner and some part of which he kept n  ihis hands for the use of his family the rest was distributed to tenants who for the use of the land consented to do whatever the Lord of the Manor commanded him so that they sometimes went out to war with him and fought for him sometimes they cultivated the land he kept in his own hands and did other services which he required of him This was the state of the  scodal  system so much spoken of in history men were then at the will of their Lord Since that time certain indulgencies of Lords of Manors certain constructions of law and certain incroachments of the tenants have made some alteration in this and though such tenants still hold their lands or estates at the will of the Lord yet it is such a will as is agreeable to the custom of the Manor which customs are preserved in the Courtroll of the Manor and kept by the Stewards and those tenants who have nothing to shew for their estates but admissions in consequence of such customs witnessed by copies of entries in their possession made by the Stewards are called  Tenants by copy of Courtroll  and their estate is thence called a  Copyhold  for such estates they pay a small annual sum by way of acknowledgement perhaps a few shillings called qui  rent and the Lord when they die takes generally the best beast such tenant possessed this beast is called a  heriot  Lords of Manors have it in their power to release such estates from heriots and quitrent in which case the estate is called a Freehold and the owner  Freeholder  and these are the people who elect the Knight  of the shire to serve in Parliament provided each man's Freehold is not less than forty shillings ayear  Now then this understood you will comprehend the nature of patronage Great part of these Manors as now consisted of waste ground and as Christianity spread the Lords of these Manors began to build Churches on their wastes for the accommodation of their tenants and obliged those tenants to appropriate their tithes to the support of one officiating Minister which before were distributed among all the Clergy in the diocese and this tract or extent of land the tithes of which were so appropriated was called a parish and because they built the Church they were allowed to nominate a Minister subject to his examination by the Bishop This right of nomination is called an  advowson  and is saleable like an estate provided the Rector or Vicar is first appointed  EUGEN  You have given me such a clear account of every thing you have told me that I trust I shall remember it  ERAST  We will then finish for the present lest your memory should be too much burthened Our next subject shall be upon the Army  DISCOURSE IX ON THE ARMY NAVY AND MILITIA  EUGEN  I Think Sir our discourse this day is to be upon the Army  ERAST  It is and you shall be told every thing I know upon the subject The profession of arms comprehends all those who engage to serve their King and  ountry in war with honour and sidelity the King has he nomination of all the officers and gives them pay in  roportion to the rank each one holds in the service  rom the common Soldier to the General This pay is  mething encreased in time of war by some advantages  he officers have during their encampment  The army is divided into three branches the cavalry infantry and artillery for I shall say nothing of the Navy now having mentioned that when I was speaking of the sea  EUGEN  Will you do me favour to describe each in its turn  ERAST  By the cavalry is understood the horse of which there are two troops of Horse Guards of Life Guards so called because they attend upon the King only and defend his life two troops of Horse Grenadier Guards one regiment of Horse Guards four regiments of Horse three regiments of Dragoon Guards and eighteen regiments of Dragoons in all about twentysix regiments or about men  EUGEN  What officers are there belonging to a regiment of Horse  ERAST  A Colonel a LieutenantColonel a Major eight or ten Captains and as many Lieutenants and Cornets an Adjutant a QuarterMaster a Chaplain and a Surgeon with Kettle Drummer Trumpeter Serjeant and Corporals  EUGEN  What is the pay of the Cavalry  ERAST  The Horse Guards have better pay than the Dragoons a Colonel of Dragoons has l s per day a LieutenantColonel l s d a Major ls d each Captain of a troop s d a Lieutenant s a Cornet s The Adjutant s Surgeon s and the Chaplain s d The Drummer s d the Trumpeter s a Serjeant s d a Corporal s d and each private man s d The Colonel has the cloathing of his regiment for which he is allowed sufficient to clean or pounds a year after paying for the cloaths and a Captain of a troop has also some perquisites The Colonel of the two troops of LifeGuards attend upon the King at Court on Court days and their regiments are not worth less to each all things considered than l pounds a year A regiment of Dragoons is considered worth pounds a year and a regiment  Foot pounds a year in time of war and about pounds in time of peace  EUGEN  And why this  ERAST  Because a regiment in time of war consists of men and in time of peace of not above half the number of course if a Colonel gets pounds a year by cloathing men he can get but half the money by cloathing  EUGEN  How many regiments of Foot are there  ERAST  Sometimes more and sometimes less In peace there is about seventytwo regiments In war about besides three regiments of Foot Guards that are always a kept up in war or peace each regiment consisting of men so that in war reckoning regiments of men each is and Guards but in time of peace the regiments are reduced to about seventytwo of each that is about men  EUGEN  How are the regiments divided  ERAST  Into ten companies each Each company has a Captain a Lieutenant and an Ensign and over the whole there is a Colonel a LieutenantColonel and a Major A company of Artillery has four Lieutenants  EUGEN  Have the Infantry no Chaplain  ERAST  Yes each regiment has a Chaplain an Adjutant a Surgeon and a Surgeon's mate besides Serjeants and Corporals  EUGEN  What is the pay of the Foot  ERAST  The Foot Guards have better pay than  arching regiments they continue in London which  a more expensive place than the country where other  egiments are quartered and where owing to being  artered or lodged at Public Houses the officers can  e cheaper besides the uniform or cloaths of the of  cers of the Foot Guards is more expensive than those  f marching regiments The officers of the Foot Guards  ave also better or more rank than officers of other re  ments An Ensign of the Guards ranks or is upon an  uality with a Lieutenant of a marching regiment a  eutenant of the Guards ranks as a Captain and a  aptain of the Guards as a LieutenantColonel and is  lled Colonel Now with respect to their pay  The Colonel of a marching regiment has l s per  y the LieutenantColonel s the Major s each the Captains s a Lieutenant s d an Ensign s d  the Adjutant s the QuarterMaster s d the Surgeon s and d a month out of each man's pay the Surgeon's mate s d and the Chaplain s d a Serjeant s d a Corporal s and each private man d  EUGEN  It is very little pay how do they contrive to live upon it  ERAST  It is with difficulty Indeed the officers seldom do they have generally small fortunes of their own The army is a profession of honour rather than of profit and so great is the eagerness of young men to get into it that commissions are oftener purchased than given away pounds is the price given for an Ensigncy and the pay is not more than about fifty pounds a year In time of peace when regiments are quartered or settled in a country place an Ensign can make shift to live upon his pay the inns upon the roads are obliged to give him a bed and three good meals a day for one shilling in which case he has two shillings and sixpence left for cloaths and other things and as to the common Soldiers the public houses are obliged by act of parliament to give them a lodging small beer fire and utensils to dress their food with salt pepper and vinegar for nothing or to find them in victuals for fourpence a day  EUGEN  I have heard say that the army is the best school in the world for young men why is it so reckoned  ERAST  Because they enter very early into it and are brought up with high notions of honour bravery and politeness to each other There is such a discipline in the army that no officer dare contradict dispute or disobey the orders of a superior officer tho' that officer shall perhaps be only an older Captain or an older Ensign on pain of being tried by his brother officers for disobedience of orders and of being punished broke and disgraced if found guilty a lad that is undutiful to his parents or masters will be there soon taught subordination and obedience he will learn to live upon sixpence a day to bear heat and cold and fatigue and never to commit a dishonourable action  EUGEN  What are the field officers of a regiment  ERAST  The Colonel LieutenantColonel and the Major who take a particular command when in the field of battle  EUGEN  Is there no higher rank in the army than a Colonel  ERAST  Yes BrigadierGenerals MajorGenerals LieutenantGenerals Generals and Field Marshals and last of all Commanders in Chief who command the whole army whereas other Generals in proportion to their rank command only a branch of the army in the day of battle  EUGEN  What is the pay fo these Generals  ERAST  They have no pay but when employed Admirals are always in pay but Generals not When they are paid their pay is in proportion to their rank from two pounds a day to ten pounds which is the pay of the Commanders in Chief  EUGEN  What is the office of the Adjutant and the QuarterMaster  ERAST  The Adjutant's business in to assist the Major to deliver his orders and to regulate the regimental accounts that of the QuarterMaster to procure proper accommodations for the men in quarters and camp and to keep every thing in order These officers in each regiment with the Chaplain and Surgeon are appointed by the Colonel as are the Serjeants and Corporals by the Captains  EUGEN  What are the Grenadiers  ERAST  They form one company of every regiment  hat march at the head of that regiment they are the  allest bestmade men picked out of the whole and wear  ong caps on purpose to make them appear taller in or  er to give the regiment a noble appearance  EUGEN  Is a soldier when enlisted obliged to serve  or life  ERAST  He is obliged to serve twenty years unless  e be disabled or can procure his discharge before It  in the option of his Colonel who if he has behaved  ell will discharge him for eight or ten guineas in order  procure another in his room or will give him his dis  arge for nothing  EUGEN  Is an officer ever promoted in the army by seniority  ERAST  Sometimes particularly if he is abroad in service in time of war If a Lieutenant dies or is killed the eldest Ensign of the same regiment will come in youngest Lieutenant if a Captain dies or is killed the eldest Lieutenant will now and then succeed but this succession will not often take place in officers of higher rank than Captains it will require interest and recommendation as for great attention to duty some gallant act of bravery or the like When an officer once ge  s the rank of Colonel his rank goes on and no Colonel is put over his head All the Colonels of the same standing are made MajorsGenerals together and all MajorGenerals of the same standing LieutenantGenerals a  the same time but it does not follow that because a man is a General he is to be employed as such The King singles out for a command such as he thinks are men of the best abilities and heroism  EUGEN  I have heard of Volunteers what are these  ERAST  In time of war a young gentleman who perhaps cannot get a Ensig  cy for asking for and has  pounds to purchase one will request the Colone  of a regiment in service to take him as a Volunteer  accepted he acts in the station of a private soldier at  own expence without pay but yet associates with th  officers and such Volunteer will have the first Ensigncy in the regiment that drops given to him as a reward for his alacrity and readiness to serve his country  EUGEN  Have there not been instances of privat  Soldiers obtaining in course of time great rank in th  army  ERAST  There have been some few instances of th  kind The late Generals Bland and Salter were one common soldiers An industrious man in the Guard may by the favour of his Colonel soon be appointed Serjeant it is then his d  ty to teach the men their  erene and if they are clever and expert at this wh  new regiments are raised they generally give one  two of such men commissions in each of those n  raised regiments in order to exercise the men and  they are properly disciplined When the th re  ment  was raised in the last war there were seven Serjeants taken from the Guards and made Lieutenants of that regiment though they had never been Ensigns a Serjeant of the Guards being almost considered upon an equality of rank with an Ensign of a marching regiment but this was a singular circumstance When once they are in commission it is easy to see that in time of action something may happen to forward their promotion  EUGEN  Is there any provision for disabled Soldiers as there is for disabled seamen  ERAST  When a soldier has served twenty years he is entitled to be an outpensioner of Chelsea Hospital for which he receives about seven pounds a year and is at liberty to set up his trade in any town in the kingdom which no man else can unless he be a freeman of those towns and if he is unable by wounds to get his living and is desirous of being taken into the Hospital wholly he will be received lodged cloathed and maintained for the rest of his life but sometimes in time of war when soldiers are wanted to go abroad they will select the most able of the outpensioners to serve in Forts and Garrisons within the kingdom Indeed the Garrisons of Great Britain are chiefly manned with invalids of which there are twentysix companies and officers who have lost a leg or an arm in the service are generally removed to them where they live comfortably the remainder of their days  EUGEN  Is there no provision for their widows if they are killed in battle  ERAST  None The widows of officers have pensions after their death whether they are killed in battle or not A Colonel's widow has l a year a Major's l a LieutenantColonel's l a Major's l a Captain's l a Lieutenant's l an Ensign's l and a Chaplain's and Surgeon's l each  EUGEN  What becomes of the officers and men of the reduced regiments  ERAST  The men are disbanded that is discharged and the officers have half pay for their lives  EUGEN  Now Sir will you explain to me the Ar  ery  ERAST  The Artillery is employed in firing of cannon and throwing of bombs  EUGEN  I know what a cannon is but do not rightly understand the nature of a bomb  ERAST  A bomb is an iron shell hollow within filled with combustible matter with a fuse or artificial fire communicating with the contents of the shell and which takes fire without when shot out of a mortar or piece something resembling a cannon It is designed to be shot into towns and forts and is so contrived that the fu  e which burns all the way it goes shall set fire to the contents of the bomb as soon as it falls to the ground and burst it into a thousand pieces which will destroy and fire every thing within its reach The soldiers generally see them as they fly in the air and avoid them when they can they are thrown into forts like a cannon ball by the force of gunpowder  EUGEN  How many regiments of Artillery are there  ERAST  Only one which consists of four batallions whose province it is to work mortars great guns or cannons spring mines throw bridges over rivers and other such things  EUGEN  I do not comprehend what you mean by springing of mines  ERAST  A mine is a subterraneous passage dug under the wall or rampart of a fortified town designed to be blown up with gunpowder when the enemy is passing over it  EUGEN  Is there any difference between the Artillery and the Engineers  ERAST  The corps of Engineers is a part of the Artillery their business is to contrive attacks at sieges and defend towns when besieged This corps has one Colonel two LieutenantsColonels four Majors twentyfour Captains and thirtyeight Lieutenants  EUGEN  How many men does a batallion consist of  ERAST  From five hundred to eight hundred  EUGEN  How many forts are there in Great Britain  ERAST  Thirtyfour or thirtyfive each of which has a Governor and LieutenantGovernor besides other officers and some Artillery The pay of the Governors is from pounds a year to pounds and  the Lieutenant Governor from pounds to l All these offices are in the gift of the King  EUGEN  Does the King dispose of them himself  ERAST  Very seldom they are given away as are the bishopricks generally by the King's ministers to their families or to those whom they wish to oblige  EUGEN  How many Ministers has the King  ERAST  About eight or nine and these generally consist of such of the Privy Council as bear the great offices of State The First Lord of the Treasury The Lord Chancellor The Lord President of the Council The First Lord of the Admiralty The Chancellor of the Exchequer The Secretary of War The Commander in Chief of the Army when there is one and the two Secretaries of State but the First Lord of the Treasury is the ostensible Minister and if these gentlemen should advise the King to any wrong measure they are liable to be called to an account for it by the Parliament which is called  impeaching  them and to be punished even to the loss of life Have you any more questions to ask  EUGEN  Oh yes a great many I want among other things to know what a siege is and the nature of it  ERAST  It is in sieges that the artillery are chiefly  mployed When a fort of fortified town that is a  own round which thick walls are built and great ditches  ug to defend it against the approach of an enemy then such a strong place is attacked it is said to be  esieged and the business of the besiegers is to get into  nd take possession of such fort or town  EUGEN  Is a fort and a fortified town the same thing  ERAST  No A fort is merely a place walled and ditched  und like a fortified town for the shelter and security of a  mber of soldiers and like that is called a  garrison  A  all number of soldiers from such a place can occasionally  ly or go out and annoy the enemy and retire within the  again and be safe it is therefore I say the business of  e besiegers to drive this garrison out and take possession  the place For this purpose artillery are employed  both sides that is bombs are thrown and cannon  d those from the besiegers to knock down the walls  destroy the fort those from the besieged to drive  away the enemy by firing on them from the walls If the besiegers can make a breach in any part of the walls they will rush in and take the fort by force This is called  storming  it If they cannot do this they will cut off all communication with the fort either by sea or land by carefully watching that no persons shall go out of it nor any provisions ammunition or other assistance be taken in and by this means in a length of time they will starve them out and oblige them to surrender for when their provisions or ammunition is gone they can hold out no longer  EUGEN  And are things always carried to such extremities  ERAST  No The besieged generally surrender if overpowered before things are brought to the utmost extremity for the General of the besiegers always sends to the Commanding Officer of the Fort and tells him that if he does not surrender he will shew to Garrison no quarter that is if he is obliged to get possession by force he will put every man to death should they hold out to the last they lie wholly at the mercy of their enemy If the besieged are driven off or think proper to desist from their enterprize they are said to raise the siege  EUGEN  How do they send to each other when all communication is cut off  ERAST  They will sometimes as the Romans did shoot a letter upon the point of an arrow from one to the other or a party will advance from the chief body of the enemy with a flag which is called a flag of truce this is generally seen by the other party and is known to be the signal for a parley or conference  EUGEN  Who Sir were the Romans  ERAST  They were a warlike people that inhabited Italy from about years before Christ to about after Christ that is for about the space of years who carried their conquests into most parts of Europe Asia and Africa and became masters of all the know  parts of the world but owing to too great an extent o  empire they were not able to keep their subjects i  subjection who as they grew more powerful se  up kings of their own in the different parts of Europe  This gave rise to the present kingdoms and the Roman empire sunk away and was lost in the establishment of other States  EUGEN  In mentioning the soldiery you have not once named the Militia  ERAST  The Militia are a distinct body of men though they are disciplined like the army and cooperate with them in time of war  EUGEN  How are they raised  ERAST  Every county is obliged to raise a certain number out of the inhabitants of that county and the men so raised are trained to arms and serve three years when others are drawn by lot in their room  EUGEN  Are they under arms all these three years  ERAST  No Only in time of war at which time they are cloathed and paid like other soldiers and are under the same discipline but in time of peace they  re called out for one month at Whitsuntide and are taught their exercise or the use of arms and during the month only that they are so out they are paid  EUGEN  How are they chosen  ERAST  Each parish chuses yearly by lot a propor  ionable number of their inhabitants perhaps three or  our or more sufficient to make up the number their  ounty is to furnish If any of these inhabitants object  o serve by paying five or six pounds a substitute may  e found to serve the three years for them  EUGEN  How are the officers chosen  ERAST  They are appointed by the Lord Lieutenant  the county out of the gentlemen of the county the  ord Lieutenant being always the Colonel of the  ounty Militia  EUGEN  And are they obliged to serve  ERAST  As the Militia are never sent out of the  ngdom gentlemen are veryeager for these appointments so that none are chosen but such as have a  tain independant property which is called a  Quali  tion  EUGEN  What are the necessary qualifications  ERAST  Lieutenant Colonels must have an estate of  unds a year the Majors and Captains pounds Lieutenant pounds and Ensigns pounds One half of  which property must be in the county they are chosen for  EUGEN  Is there any provision for a wounded Militia man  ERAST  They are like other soldiers entitled to the benefit of Chelsea Hospital and have other privileges like them  EUGEN  How many men do the several counties raise  ERAST  England and Wales together furnish private men  EUGEN  When all the army are together they must make a vast body  ERAST  Certainly not less in time of war reckoning the Cavalry Infantry Militia Marines and Artillery than about besides seamen so that without officers the army and navy may be reckoned in war to amount to above men A vast number for so small a territory as Great Britain to find and support  EUGEN  Does not Ireland assist upon this occasion  ERAST  Yes But in the last war they raised among themselves for the defence of their own country Volunteers and every man was well disciplined and bore his own expences without calling upon the State for any assistance which added to the number of the army reckoned before makes men  EUGEN  A vast number indeed  ERAST  Such a number as dispelled all fear of being attacked in any quarter for the success of a battle generally depends upon numbers few Generals caring to risk an engagement if their army is not pretty near upon an equality with the enemy in point of number  EUGEN  How many ships for war have we  ERAST  We had last war in commission small and great about on which there are on board nea  guns or cannon  EUGEN  Are these all fighting ships  ERAST  When I say I include ships of it line which are ships carrying more guns than  frigates brigs galleys schooners cutters fireship and yatchs Cutters are chiefly employed to gua  the coast from smugglers  EUGEN  What are smugglers  ERAST  Such as bring by sea tea brandy rum and other articles into the country without paying duty by which means the rob the state of part of its revenue  EUGEN  They are liable to be punished for this  ERAST  Their goods and vessels are liable to be seized and if they make and resistance the offence is death  EUGEN  By what means does the Admiral in an engagement give his direction to other ships  ERAST  By signals that is by flags hoisted on certain parts of the ships and by firing of guns  EUGEN  These signals must be then very numerous how do they contrive not to mistake one for another  ERAST  They are all settled before hand and wrote down and an officer on board each ship is appointed to explain them In short a mariner is so well acquainted with all the business of navigation that there are few mistakes but what are wilful  DISCOURSE IX OF THE COURTS OF LAW AND THEIR OFFICERS  ERAST  HAVE you my dear Eugenius a right comprehension of the Courts of Law  EUGEN  Very far from it it would give me pleasure to have them properly explained  ERAST  I shall not enter into a minute detail of them but content myself with saying only so much as will give you a general idea of the principal of them which are four for there are several that will be unnecessary to burthen your memory with we will begin with the lowest  The first then is the court of Common Pleas calculated to redress injuries committed by one man upon the property of another in any part of the kingdom  It was established in Westminster Hall by King John in where it has continued ever since The Judges of this Court are four in number the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and three  puisne  or Under Judges who sit every day in Term time to hear and determine all matters of law arising in civil causes real or personal  EUGEN  What is meant by civil causes  ERAST  By civil causes are meant all infringements upon property carried on or prosecuted by the person injured in contradistinction to criminal causes which are considered as breaches of the peace and though commenced by the party aggrieved are carried on in the King's name as the chief magistrate and enforcer of the Laws  The Court of King's Bench is the next so called because the King used to sit there in person and is the Supreme Court of Common Law in the kingdom It has also four Judges a Chief Justice and three  puisne  ones  EUGEN  Did the King sit in that Court as a Judge  ERAST  He sat there as he is supposed to do now but was not empowered to determine any cause but by the mouth of his Judges  EUGEN  What is the authority of that Court  ERAST  This has the superintendance of all Civil Corporations commands Magistrates and others to do what their duty requires protects the liberty of the people hears and determines both in criminal and civil causes and is a Court to which we may appeal against all determinations of the Court of Common Pleas and other inferior Courts  EUGEN  You mentioned Common Law what it understood by this  ERAST  Common Law implies whatever has been customary throughout the kingdom is perhaps as old as the kingdom itself and the term is used to distinguish it from those Laws established by Act of Parliament and which are therefore called  Statute  Law  There is another principal Court of Law called the Court of Exchequer which is a Court of Equity too and was established originally to recover debts due to the King people may however apply to this Cou  for redress such grievances as they generally apply to the Court of Chancery for There are four Judges also of this Court called Barons of the Exchequer a Lord Chief Baron and three others  But the fourth and last is the High Court of Chancery the most important of all in matters of civil property Here the Lord Chancellor sits as Judge and determines the matter by his own decree whereas in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas the matter is heard and determined by a Jury of twelve men But if a man thinks himself aggrieved even by a decree of the Chancellor in the Court of Chancery he may refer his cause to the decision of the House of Lords where it may be reheard  EUGEN  What is it you mean by a Jury of twelve men  ERAST  This is esteemed one of the greatest privileges of a British subject that of being tried or having his cause determined by twelve indifferent persons chosen by him out of fortyeight respectable men of his own country who are summoned for that purpose by which means the decision is not left to the determination of the Judge alone who might possibly be thought partial  EUGEN  I think you said the Court of King's Bench had the superintendance of all Civil Corporations I wish to know the nature of a Corporation  ERAST  Corporations are bodies of man united by a Charter or Privilege from the Crown for the purpose of protecting their own rights or the rights of the Community to which they belong They are empowered to make certain laws of regulation among themselves and to enforce the execution of them if they be not contrary to the laws of the land Cities and all Borough towns that send members to Parliament are towns corporate or little republicks and the Mayor and Aldermen of such corporate bodies are generally Magistrates within the limits of the Corporation  The Corporation of the City of London like that of other towns consists of three branches The Lord Mayor Aldermen and Common Council in imitation of King Lords and Commons The City is divided into twelve wards and each ward elects an Alderm    and a certain number of Common Council The Aldermen meet by themselves and so do the Common Council and thus between them the business of the Corporation is adjusted  EUGEN  Why is the Mayor of London called Lord Mayor  ERAST  By a particular privilege the Mayors of London York and Dublin have the title of Lord for the year they serve which the Mayors of other towns have not  EUGEN  What are those Courts that are held in the Country I mean the Assizes  ERAST  They are a kind of Assistant Courts sent by the King's Special Commission twice a year all round the King's dominions Their business is to try by a Jury of the respective counties such causes as must otherwise be brought up to Westminster Thus for the case of the subject justice is brought home to every man's door disputed facts are tried if required in the country by neighbours and criminals are prosecuted where the witnesses are near at hand to attend  EUGEN  Are there no other Courts of consequence  ERAST  Yes The Court of Admiralty is one at which the Lord High Admiral or his Deputy presides This Court is held three or four times a year at the Old Bailey in London and one of the Judges generally acts as the Lord Admiral's deputy It tries all offences committed on the seas or in parts out of the reach of the Common Law Courts  There are Courts also for trying Ecclesiastical causes and there is the Prerogative Court for the trial of wills the Judge of which is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury  EUGEN  Now you mention wills shall I trouble you to tell me the office of an Executor  ERAST  The Executor is generally some friend o  the deceased appointed by him in his will to execut  what is there directed to dispose of the effects and distribute the property according to the will of th  testator  EUGEN  Suppose he does not chuse to undertake it what is then done  ERAST  The next of kin in such case will administer that is apply to the Bishop's Court and take out what is called  Letters of Administrations  which are granted by the Bishop for that purpose and who will then take care that the tenor of the Will is properly complied with But to go on Besides the Courts I have mentioned there are little Courts in almost every county town throughout England called  Courts of Conscience  for the recovery of debts under forty shillings  EUGEN  Who are the principal people employed in these Courts  ERAST  The three chief parties on a trial are the Plaintiff that is the complainant the Defendant or the party complained against and the Judge but in the principal Courts there are Attornies and Counsel as Assistants  EUGEN  What is the office of an Attorney  ERAST  An Attorney at Law in civil Courts is as the Proctor in the Ecclesiastical Courts a person whom the Plaintiff or Defendant appoints to appear for him and manage and conduct his cause These Attorney  are now formed into a regular body and when admitted to the execution of their office by the Courts of Westminster Hall are officers of those Courts who admit them and can practise in no other  Of Counsel there are two degrees Barristers and Serjeants Barristers after they have been admitted five years in any of the Inns of Court such as the Temple Lincoln's Inn c that is after five year standing are called to the bar and after sixteen years standing they may be called to the degree of Serjeants The Judges are always admitted Serjeants before they are made Judges Out of these Barristers of Serjeants the King's Counsel are usually selected the two principal of whom are called his Attorney and SollicitorGeneral who are always Members of Parliament  EUGEN  Have the King's Counsel any particular privilege  ERAST  They are employed always in Crown causes but can be employed in no cause against the Crown without special Licence They are heard always before other Counsel and even before Serjeants  EUGEN  Is merit in this profession ever the means of promotion  ERAST  It seldom is in the church and seldom in the army but almost always here they must have able men and good speakers for Judges and for the Attorney and SolicitorGeneral but of two able men he who has most interest is commonly preferred From common Barristers they are promoted to be King's Counsel and from King's Counsel generally to be Masters in Chancery and Judges Such of the Counsel as are appointed to be Solicitor and AttorneyGeneral to the King generally come to be Chief Justices or Lord Chancellor The SolicitorGeneral is commonly promoted to the office of Attorney General and thence to be either Chief Justice or Lord Chancellor which seldom fails to procure him a peerage For the Lord Chancellor does not usually continue long in office  EUGEN  Was I to chuse my profession then it should be that of a Barrister  ERAST  You must be first a man of abilities and a good Orator for without these a Counsel makes but a poor figure and he may be never heard of as long as he lives but if he is a sensible man a good Lawyer and a good Orator from being at the Bar he may get into Parliament and there by his eloquence may carry every thing before him and arrive at the highest honours  DISCOURSE X ON SUNDRY USEFUL SUBJECTS  EUGEN  BY the benefit Sir of your instruction I think I am pretty well master of almost every thing necessary to be learded by a young man coming into the world but there are two or three subjects which I am still ignorant of and of which I am very desirous of some little account and that I may not forget them I have minuted them down on a sli  of paper Will you give me leave to mention them  ERAST  There is one principal part of instruction as necessary to youth as any I have mentioned which in our late Discourses I have not yet touched upon That is the art of politeness and of rendering ourselves agreeable to the world and the art of knowing and living in that world but as I have put together every requisite instruction upon that head and published them under the title of PRINCIPLES OF POLITENESS AND THE ART OF KNOWING THE WORLD I will refer you to that book At present let me hear the subjects you wish to have explained  EUGEN  They are as follow The Trojan war The nature of Magna Charta the Habeas Corpus Bill the Navigation Act Naturalization Morgages Patents and Passports  ERAST  It is very proper you should understand them all and I will explain them to you one after the other The first I think is the Trojan war  EUGEN  If you please  ERAST  The siege of Troy though founded on fact is so enveloped in fable that the whole has by some been considered as fabulous It is made the subject of an Heroic Poem written in Greek by Homer the first of Poets who lived nine hundred years before the birth of Christ To give you a complete account of it you should first be acquainted with the Heathen Mythology or the fabulous Deities of Antiquity However I will give you the best notion of it I can  The City of Troy was situated in that part of Phrygia adjoining the Bosphorus of Thrace which is now called the Straits of Constantinople and flourished about one thousand two hundred years before Christ We are told that Hecuba the wife of Priam King of Troy when with child of Paris dreamed that she was brought to bed of a flaming torch which being construed by an Oracle who was supposed to have the gift of prophecy to imply that the child of which she was big would one day be the ruin of his country and his family her husband Priam ordered him when born to be put to death but Hecuba secreted him and had him brought up by a shepherd Many years afterwards Paris who  was unacquainted with his birth came to Troy to contend for a prize which the king proposed to give among his young nobility and won it Hector the eldest son of Priam enquiring about this young man soon found him to be his brother King Priam received him acknowledged him and gave him that rank that was his due Some time after Paris having been at Sparta to recover his aunt Hesione whom Hercules had run away with took away be force Helena the wife of Menelaus king of that city and swore he would never return her till his aunt Hesione was returned The Grecian princes round about took part with Menelaus and engaged themselves by oath never to lay down their arms till they had overthrown the city of Troy  The Grecian army was conducted by leaders kings princes or heroes much celebrated at that time for singular atchievements And Agamemnon king of Argos and Mycene was declared commander in chief Among the Grecian leaders were Nestor Achilles and Patroclus his friend Ajax son of Telamon the other Ajax Idomeneus Diomedes Ulysses and Palimedos Their fleet was composed of vessels  The superb city of Troy was defended by the all the princes of Asia and who to equal the forces of Greece assembled a very powerful army They were commanded also by very valiant princes and by all the sons of Priam which were in number the eldest of which was Hector who alone could have sustained and repulsed all the efforts of the enemy had fate not destined it to the contrary The Trojans were every where conquerors under this hero they drove the Greeks from every part and burnt their fleet so that they repented of their expedition for Achilles was offended with Agamemnon and had withdrawn himself which changed the face of things In this general discomfiture Patroclus the friend of Achilles anxious to recal their good fortune took the arms of Achilles and put himself at the head of the Grecian army repulsed the Trojans and challenged Hector to single combat Hector advanced and Patroclus fell a sacrifice to his sword Achilles then exasperated  at the death of his friend forgot the offence of Agamemnon attacked the Trojan hero killed him tied him to his chariot wheels and dragged him round the walls of Troy and the grave of his friend Patroclus  The death of Hector was as great a loss to the Trojans as the retreat of Achilles had been to the Greeks Priam demanded a truce or cessation of arms for some days during which time he went with part of his family and some rich presents to request of Achilles the dead body of his son that he might bestow upon him the last honours Achilles moved with the tears of Polixena Hector's sister whose beauty had smitten him yielded to Priam's request Paris profited by this circumstance and revenged his brothers death he promised Achilles to give him his sister in marriage and kept his word and they were scarce assembled in the temple to solemnize the marriage than Paris took an opportunity to murder Achilles  Enraged at this Pyrrhus the son of Achilles came with a considerable reenforcement and joined the Greeks to revenge the death of his father But the oracle having declared that Troy never would be taken whilst it possessed the  Palladium  which was a statue of Pallas the goddess of war superstitiously supposed to have descended from heaven and to have placed herself upon the altar Diomedes and Ulysses took upon them to take it away which they did with great cleverness  The Greeks however not being able to make themselves masters of the city by force undertook to surprise it They pretended that Minerva had punished them for taking her from the Palladium and after ten years siege in which it had cost them the lives of so many great and illustrious men they had recourse to this stratagem They constructed a wooden horse in the belly of which they shut up a great number of armed soldiers and concealed it in the island of Tenedos they gave but that they built this horse as an atonement for the injury they had done Minerva The Trojans on the Greeks leaving it crowded round the figure and seduced  by a vain hope which was heightened by one Sinon whom the Greeks instructed to say that if that horse was conveyed within the walls of Troy it would thence forth be impregnable seduced I say by this story they instantly proceeded to make a breach in the walls and introduced this fatal machine This day which was the last of Troy became a day of merriment in which each man gave way to the blind transports of folly Night came on and when the whole city was at rest wrapt up in fatal security the Grecian soldiers opened the sides of the horse and under cover of the night spread themselves in all quarters of the city to which they set fire and the flames was a signal to the enemy who entered by the breach and put all to the sword The Trojans made a desperate defence and did not yield till they were overpowered by numbers Pyrrhus in particular committed unheardof cruelties He broke into Priam's palace and slew the prince and all his family at the foot of the altar where they had fled for refuge Polixenes was considered as the cause of Achilles's death her Pyrrhus sacrificed upon the  tumulus  or tomb which the Greeks had raised to his memory Andromache Hector's wife had concealed her son Aslyanax in the tomb of that hero Ulysses found him out and threw him down from the top of a high tower Pyrrhus took Andromache to Epirus afterwards and married her  Such was the sad fate of the proud city of Troy which took place in the year before Christ She saw perish before he walls Greeks and within her bosom of her own citizens  EUGEN  Was there not a Trojan prince that escaped from Troy and carried his father upon his shoulders  ERAST  It was Eneas he was of the blood royal and fled from the ruins of his country with his father Anchises on his back and his son Iulus in his hand History tells us that he afterwards settled in Italy and that one of his descendants founded the empire of Rome of which I have given you some little accountWhat was the next thing you wished to know  EUGEN  The nature of Magna Charta  ERAST  Magna Charta is the great charter of liberty which the barons that is the nobility of this country being at war with King John compelled him to sign in the year Under all despotic governments the king not only makes free with the purses of his subjects but also with their persons that is will not only take away their property when he has occasion for it but will imprison them at his pleasure By signing this charter king John renounced for ever in the name of the kings of this country all such arbitrary measures and acquiesced to such terms as to this day have secured the liberties of the subject The Habeas Corpus bill and act passed in the reign of king Charles II is one of the glorious consequences of this great charter  EUGEN  I wish your would explain it  ERAST  By virtue of this act of parliament no man can be imprisoned without knowing the cause of such imprisonment and having his case fairly argued in a court of justice In all illegal confinements the prisoner may have a writ of Habeas Corpus directed to the person detaining him and requiring him to take him before a court or before a judge within days of the writ being delivered if a judge refuses to grant such a writ he forfeits l to the prisoner if the keeper of a prison refuses to obey the forfeits l for the first offence and l for the second If when his case is argued he be acquitted he cannot be imprisoned again for the same offence  EUGEN  This certainly is but just  ERAST  It is however what no country but this can boast of What is your next question  EUGEN  The Navigation Act  ERAST  Great Britain being an island its whole warlike strength depends upon its marine or its power by sea As a nursery for seamen therefore the fisheries were established and every encouragement is given to foreign commerce and with the same view the navigation act was passed during the republican government of this kingdom when the parliament had put king Charles to death By this act not merchandize can be imported into England but in English ships of which  the master and threefourths of the crew must be English subjects except it be in the ships of that European country of which the merchandize is the growth or manufacture  EUGEN  Why was this exception made  ERAST  To encourage foreigners to trade with us for it would have been hard to have obliged them to hire English vessels to bring here the goods of their own country All we wished to prevent was that no other nation should be the carriers of our merchandize it was America chiefly we had an eye to and the people there before their independence could send nothing here but in English vesselsWhat is your next question  EUGEN  The nature of Naturalization  ERAST  To naturalize a man is to give him the privilege of a subject born in this kingdom Neither a Jew nor a foreigner can purchase an estate in this country nor inherit one from his ancestors but when he is naturalized he can and foreigners pay more duties on imports and exports than natural born subjects  EUGEN  Can all be naturalized that please  ERAST  Yes If they chuse to be at the expence of an act of parliament which they cannot be without receiving the sacrament according to the Church of England and taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance  EUGEN  What are these oaths  ERAST  By the oath of allegiance the man swears loyalty and fidelity to his King and by the oath of supremacy he abjures the Pope and acknowledges the King to be the head of the Church  EUGEN  What in the expence of an act of parliament  ERAST  About l To encourage the Jews who are a very trading people to settle with us in preference to other countries some years ago a general naturalization bill was passed to reach to all under certain restrictions but the people of England were so aver  to it that had not the parliament immediately re  ealed it they would have knocked the Jews on th  head They went so far as to kill one or two at Northampton  EUGEN  The other things I wish to know are Mortgages Patents and Passports  ERAST  Passports are letters of safe conduct granted under the King's seal to subjects of a foreign power with whom we are at war for without such a passport they cannot pass safely in this country from place to place nor can they convey their merchandize at sea from port to port without its being liable to be seized  Patents are exclusive privileges granted by the King to the author of any new invention to have to fole manufacturing and vending of the said invention for fourteen years  EUGEN  Can any one obtain a Patents  ERAST  Any one the applies for it on his swearing that he is the original inventor But it is in the breast of the King to refuse it if he thinks proper  EUGEN  What is the expence of obtaining one  ERAST  About fourscore pounds  EUGEN  Now Sir for Mortgages and I will make my bow  ERAST  A Mortgage is when a man borrows of another a certain sum of money and grants him an estate on condition that if he repays the money on a certain fixed day the person holding the estate shall return it to its former owner The person borrowing the money is called the  Mortgagor  and the person lending it the  Mortgagee  There is another article which you have not enquired about but which is equally necessary for you to know  EUGEN  What is that Sir  ERAST  The nature of the Mortmain Act When Popery was the established religion of this country it was customary for the Monks to persuade persons on their death beds by alarming arguments to leave part if not the whole of their property to the convent to which they belonged and they so often succeeded as to become proprietors of very considerable estates which were thus perpetually inherent in one  dead hand  To prevent this many laws from time to time have been  ade and no person now can leave by will any sur  of money to a charitable use unless it be bequeathed and enrolled in Chancery twelve months before the death of the testator  EUGEN  Accept my best thanks for the information you have given me and you shall see that I will profit by it  EUGEN  Do this my dear Eugenius and I am amply gratified  INDEX  The Nature of the following
