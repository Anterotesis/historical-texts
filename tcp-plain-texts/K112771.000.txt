 THE PEERAGE OF  SCOTLAND  Containing an  Historical  and  Genealogical  ACCOUNT OF THE  NOBILITY  of that Kingdom  Collected from the Publick Records of the NATION the Charters and other Writings of the NOBILITY and from the most approved Histories  By GEORGE CRAWFURD  Esq  EDINBURGH  Printed for the AUTHOR Sold by  George Stewart  at the  Book  and  Angel  in the  ParliamentClose    THE PREFACE  _THE Nature of this Work seeming to render something of a Preface necessary I shall for that Reason intirely dedicate it to the Service of the Reader in as few Words as possibly I can  Having formerly written a short Essay upon the Royal Family of  STEWART  to which was prefixed an Historical Account and Description of the Shire of  Renfrew  I had no sooner publish'd that little Book than several Persons of eminent Distinction for their Learning and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation for whose Judgment I had the most profound Regard set upon me to write  A Peerage of SCOTLAND  a Book very much wanted which at length by their Importunity and promised Assistance I was prevailed with to undertake  When I first set about this Work as I did entirely devote and dedicate my Time to the Study of Antiquities particularly those of our own Country so I made it my Business to collect all those Historical and Genealogical Tracts that had been done on the Nobility that I could come to the Knowledge of The Oldest of that Kind I have met with was a few loose Sheets on the Genealogies  of our Nobility said to be done by  James  Lord  Ochiltree  in the Hands of my very worthy Friend and one of our best Antiquaries Mr  Baillie  of  Castlecary  but the Accounts even of the few Families that Lord treats of are very lame and I observe where he goes much higher than his own Time they are purely traditional and therefore I could not depend on them  I perused also the large Genealogical Collections concerning the Nobility by Sir  James Balfour  who was Lord Lyon King at Arms in the Reign of King  Charles  I but they are written so very loosely and I have seen them contradicted so frequently by Writs and Charters that I give them but little Credit I suppose Sir  James  never intended these Papers should have gone further than his own Closet for he was a Learned and Curious Gentleman as appears from his Annals in which he is much more exact especially as to what occurred in his own Time  I procured likewise a Copy of the Historical Essay on the Principal Families of the Kingdom Alphabetically digested by the learned Lord Advocate Sir  George Mackenzie  of  Rosehaugh  but I apprehend these Papers have been only some first Draught of a greater Work Sir  George  intended which he lived not to finish Of this there are many Copies in several Hands the most exact by very far of any of them I have seen was that which I had the Use of from  Thomas Crawfurd  of  Cartsburn  my Brother who by his own Reading and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation has rectified a great many of Sir  George  's Mistakes at least of his Amanuensis and has with great Accuracy embellished his own Copy with a vast deal of fine Historical Remarks that it well deserves the Character of a curious Manuscript  I had moreover a Sight of the Genealogies of the Nobility collected by Mr  Dunlop  the late Principal of the College of  Glasgow  who was Historiographer for  Scotland  a Gentleman of great Integrity and Learning and an excellent Antiquary I understand he intended to have written  A Peerage of SCOTLAND  and for that End made very full Collections on that Subject But I observe that most of Mr  Dunlop  's Accounts are composed of those Genealogical Descents that the Nobility have in their own Families and are handed about by their Friends and that ingenious Gentleman did with great Accuracy and Judgment  add Historical Memoirs to the Genealogies which give them a great Ornament and he is very exact as to his Authorities The MS was communicated to me by my very worthy Friend Mr  Dunlop  the present Professor of  Greek  in the University of  Glasgow  the Principal's Son  But after I had made all those Collections I have mentioned and a great deal more of that Kind I cannot stay to particularize I found I had not any tolerable Foundation for the carrying on the Work I had undertaken for the Honour of the Country the Design it was principally for or my own Reputation and therefore by the Advice and Direction of my ingenious Friends who had engaged me in the Design I did with as much Humility and Modesty as I was Master of address every Peer by myself or some Friend for the Assistance of their own Charters and Writings to enable me to do their Families Justice in this Undertaking  Such Helps as I sought were very generously afforded me by the greater Part of the Nobility who allowed me the Perusal of their CharterChests and original Writings from which I composed the Accounts of their Families as they stand in my Book Severals indeed I did not see some were unwilling to shew their Family Writs for divers Reasons some were Minors others were Abroad and out of the Country and even to such I have done all the Justice was possibly in my Power But if the Accounts of such Families whose Charters I have not had Access to be shorter and less connected than others that was what cannot be supposed I could help I took Care timeously to advertise every Body concerned and if they did not incline to shew me their Writs the Blame cannot be laid on me  But that I might be the better able to carry on the Work I had undertaken with Advantage and to form Accounts of those noble Families whose Writs I had not seen and to supply if a  Hiatus  did happen as it frequently did in such Families whose Writings I had perused I searched all the Publick Offices and Libraries about  Edinburgh  By the Publick Offices I mean the Registers of the Great Seal which I perused from the Charters of King  Robert  I down to our own Times in the Laigh ParliamentHouse and in the Chancery I look'd over also the Records of the Justiciary and all the Chartularies in the Lawyers Library  and noted every Thing as exactly  as I could and the Keepers of these Offices were so obliging as to allow me Access at all Hours ordinary and extraordinary whenever I call'd and to whom therefore I do with all due Gratitude return my most humble and hearty Acknowledgments  But after all my Labour I am so far from being so vain as to imagine this Essay is not capable of any further Improvement that on the contrary I am sensible I have thro' Inadvertency and the Errors of the Press especially in Dates and Proper Names of the present Age fallen into many Mistakes but I beg the ingenious Reader will pardon these Omissions which are inevitable in such Books and where he discovers an Error he will correct it with his Pen  Perhaps some may think that I have been fuller upon some Families even some that are extinct than on others who are much more ancient than those I enlarge more upon The Reason is plain the Representatives Relations or Descendents of those noble Families shew'd me their Writs and encouraged my Design If others had done so I doubt not but I should have been able to have done them as full and vouched them as well For I can say and do here declare on the Word of a Gentleman That I had no Regard in the doing of Justice in my Province as an Author to the Encouragement I received from any Man otherwise than to reckon myself very much obliged to such and I own I did not spare either Time or Pains to discover any Particular I thought could give an Ornament to the Antiquity or a Lustre to the Honour of their Families  But where I have been assisted from the Publick Records or Authentick History I have been as full on those Families who never incouraged the Design as I have been upon those who gave me the greatest Assistance every Way and for the Truth of this I can and do appeal to severals of the Nobility themselves who will find very long deduced and well vouched Descents of their Families in this Peerage who never encouraged my Undertaking in any Degree But as I said before That I had had no Respect to for my chief and only Regard was and shall be Truth and the Honour of our Country as far as I am capable to discover the one or defend the other  As to the Work it self I shall say nothing But after so great Labour and Expence of Time the Essay being new and never before attempted how defective soever it may be I cannot but hope will meet with a favourable Reception from the Ingenious and more particularly have the Approbation and Countenance of Persons of Distinction who frequently read such Books and know how useful and acceptable Undertakings of this Kind have ever been accounted in all the Polite Nations of  Europe  THE Peerage of SCOTLAND  HAMILTON Earl of  Abercorn  THE First of this Collateral Branch of the Family of  Hamilton  was Lord  Claud Hamilton  third Son of  James  Duke

which Titles he used till he was rais'd to a higher Honour  The Earl of  Fife  and  Menteth  was a Person of great Parts and Spirit which he manifested in all his Actions both in Peace and War His Father the King had so great an Esteem of his Abilities that in his old Age he made him Governor of  Scotland  and he continued in the Administration till the Death of the King  Upon the Accession of his Brother  Robert  III to the Crown the King being aged and valitudinary thought fit to continue the Earl of  Fife  his Brother in the Regency and further dignified him with the Title of Duke of  Albany Anno  and he discharged that great Trust very well throughout the Whole of his Brother's Reign and the Prince King  James  I being a Prisoner in  England  at the Time of his Father's Death the

Duke of  Albany  was succeeded by  Murdack  his Son both in his Estate and in the Government of  Scotland  but he came very far short of his Father for being a weak Man and of small Parts was scarce able to govern his own Family much less the Kingdom But that which should attone for all his Oversights and preserve his Memory from all unkind Reflections was the glorious Part he acted in conducing so much toward the Restauration of King  James  I in which he was the great Instrument Not long thereafter the King growing jealous of the Duke's Power which no doubt was very great and discovering some treasonable Intrigue in which he was concern'd he was first put under Arrest and sent Prisoner to the Castle of  Carlaverock  and being shortly after brought to his Trial he was found guilty of HighTreason by his Peers for which he lost his Head on the th  May    This great but unfortunate Duke married  Isobel  Daughter and Heir of  Duncan  Earl of  Lennox  by whom he had Sir  Walter  and

 Anne  his second Wife Daughter  to the Count de  Bulloign  the Duke left a Son  John  Duke of  Albany  to whom the Administration of the Affairs of the Kingdom was committed in the Minority of King  James  V and he discharged that great Trust with invincible Constancy and Courage till the King came to Age that he retired into  France  where he had a fair Fortune in Right of his Wife In the Service of that Crown he exercised the highest military Commands under  Francis  I with great Honour and Reputation even till his Death  Anno  The Title by Reason he had no lawful Issue did extinguish with him  The next who had this Honour by Creation was that comely and graceful Prince  Henry  Lord  Darnly  whom Queen  Mary  a few Days before she took him to be her Husband did with great Solemnity invest in the Title of Duke of  Albany  which ceas'd again upon his Marriage that he was proclaim'd King of  Scotland  and had his Name put upon the Coin with the Queen's  Henricus Maria Rex Regina

this Time  Seol Diarmed  that is the Posterity and Offspring of  Diarmed  From this  Diarmed O Dwbin  the  Bards  have recorded a long Series of the Barons of  Lochow  I have seen a very ancient Manuscript History of the Family of Argyle that derives them from a very long Train of Ancestors much farther back than can be vouched by Writings or Records and seems to be founded upon the traditional Accounts of the Sanachies and Bards whose Office consisted chiefly in recording the Actions and Atchievements of the great Men of the respective Families to whom they were attach'd  whose Actions they tell us were very renown'd both for Valour and Courage  Paul O Dwbin  Lord of  Lochow  his Successor call'd  Paul in Spuran  so deno+minate from his being the King's Treasurer having no

found memorable of him in our pulick Records  The particular History of the Family of  Argyle  does represent this Sir  Colin More  to have been a very renown'd and warlike Chieftain they tell us  That he was slain in a Conflict with a great Neighbour of his own the Lord of  Lorn  that after he had defeat his Adversary pursuing the Victory too eagerly he was slain at a Place called the  String  in  Cowall  and there interr'd where a great Obelisk was erected over his Grave  Historical and Genealogical Descent of the illustrious Family of Argyle MS penes me    His Death occasion'd great Bloodshed in those Parts and kindled such a Flame betwixt the Two Families  of  Lochow  and  Lorn  as was not extinguished for many Years thereafter even so long as the  Argadii  Lords of  Lorn

referr'd the Decision of their respective Claims to  Edward  I of  Engalnd  Mr Prin's large Collections wherein Sir Nicol or Neil Campbell is there mention'd as one of the great Men who were the

his Loyalty to that heroick Prince insomuch that he was thought most worthy and pitched upon to command a Party of Loyalists that were sent to  Argyle  Shire to curb and overawe the Lord of  Lorn

of the Peers who made a very strong and vigorous Opposition to it and on the  November  when the first Article of the Treaty was Enacted and Ratified his Grace enter'd this Protestation which from the Records of Parliament I transcribed  I  John  Duke of  Athole  Protest for my self and all others who shall adhere to this my Protestation that an Incorporating Union of the Crown of  Scotland  with the Crown of  England  and that both Nations should be represented by one and the some Parliament as contain'd in the Articles of the Treaty of Union is contrary to the Honour Interest fundamental Laws and Constitutions of this Kingdom the Birthright of the Peers the Privileges of the Barons and Burgesses and  Act Parl Ja  it is ordain'd that none of the Leiges presume to take upon them to impugn the Dignity and Authority of the Three Estates of Parliament or to seek or procure the Diminution of the Power and Authority of the said Three Estates under the pain of Treason and is contrary to the Claim of Right Property and Liberty of the Subject And the    d Act of Her Majesty  's  Parliament    it is thereby declared high Treason in any of the Subjects of this Kingdom to quarrel or impugn or endeavour by writing or malicious and advised speaking or any other open Act or Deed to innovate the Claim of Right in any Article thereof  Likeas on the  January  when the d Article of the Treaty of Union in relation to the Number of Representatives for  Scotland  in the Parliament of  GreatBritain  came to be debated the Duke gave in this Protest which in Justice to his Grace I could not forbear to insert  Forasmuchas the Peers of this Realm who are Hereditary Members of Her Majesty's great Council and Parliament do hereby become Elective and so Her Majesty is deprived of Her born Counsellours and the Peers of their Birthright And whereas at present they are    in Number they are by this Article reduced to    which    are to be joined with the House of Lords in  England  whose Number at present consists of above    whereby its plain that the  Scots  Peers share in the Legislative and Judicative Powers in the  British  Parliament is very unequal to that of the  English  tho the one be Representative of as Free and Independent a Nation as the other and is therefore a plain Forfaulture of the Peerage of this Kingdom contrary to the  Honour of the Monarchy disgraceful to the Kingdom and prejudicial to the Barons and Burrows of this Realm  This noble Lord married first the Lady  Katharine Hamilton  Daughter of  William  and  Anne  Duke Dutches of  Hamilton  a Lady of

Hungarion  Extraction so it was no less illustrious for it's Allyances as the whole course of this Work doth testify but in regard I had no Access to see any of their Writes I cannot make a Deduction of them I shall only remark that the last Lord whose very Name I could never so much as learn died without Issue since the Restauration of King  Charles  II and with him the Honour of the Family failed  MURRAY Lord of  Bothwel  ALL our  Scots  Historians make mention of the  Moravii  as a bold and Warlike Tribe who about the middle of the first Century were very assistant to King  Corbred  I in his Wars against the  Romans  whose Captain  Roderick  and a great many of his followers were slain in that famous Expedition of Queen  Baudicea  related also by  Cornelius Tacitus  But that I may proceed to my Design in giving a Historical and Genealogical deduction of the antient and noble Family of the  Murrays  properly so called I shall begin with their Ancestor one  Friskinus  who was a great Man in the Northern parts in the Reign of King  David  I  Anno  For it's certain he was not only possessed of the Country of  Moravia  now called  Moray  but likewise that of  Sutherland  which he divided betwixt two of his Sons and from whence they took their respective Sirnames  Writes of the Episcopal See of Murray in the Registers of that Church in the Lawyers Library MS  and his Descendents even to this Time carry the same Coat of Arms  viz  Three Molets differing only in the Tincture  William  de  Moravia  Filius  Friskini  seems to be a very great Man about the Court of King  William  as appears from the frequency of his Witnessing the Deeds of that pious Prince to the Cathedral Church of  Moray  and to the Bishops of that See  ibidem confirm by King William Ric Epis Moraviae Ecclesiae de Forress  to which this great Man was likewise himself a Benefactor He left Issue  William  de  Moravia  who is intituled  Willielmus  de  Moravia  filius  Willielmi filii Friskini  in a Donation which he made in pure and perpetual Alms  Ecclesiae sancti Trinitatis de Spiny Collegio Canonicorum ibidem Deo servientium Ecclesiam de Artindoll cum pertinen coram  Hugone  fratre suo  Archibaldo  de  Dowglas  Cartulary of the Cathedral Church of Elgine in Bib Jurid  He left Issue several Sons of whom diverse antient Families of the  Murray  's branched  ibidem  beside  Walter  de  Moravia Miles  who is designed  filius Domini  Willielmi  deMoravia  ibidem in an Indenture between him and the Bishop of Moray relative to the Church of Artindole ad Annum and was likewise a Donator to St Nicolas's Hospital near the Bridge of Spey by his Gift of the Lands of Achinway ad sustentationem pauperum ibidem recipiendorum of which the Bishops of Moray were Patrons  He gave to the Church of  Elgin  and the Chapter of the Episcopal See of  Moray Ecclesiam de Inerallel cum pertinen pro salute animae suae  and is the same  Walterus  as I take  it  who is one of the great Men  Magnates Scotiae  mentioned as a Guarantee in a Treaty of Peace betwixt our King  Alexander  II and  Henry  III of  England Anno    Rymer's foedera Angliae ad Annum  He left a Son  Willielmus  de  Moravia Filius Walteri  de  Moravia  who is so designed in the Act declaratory of the Succession of the  Scots  Crown to King  Alexander  III and his Heirs  Anno    ibidem ad Annum  And is the same noble Person designed  Panetarius Scotiae  and  Dominus  de  Bothwel Drumsargard  Rymer's foedera Angliae ad Annum and  under which Title there are many Donations made by the Heirs of this noble House to the Chapter of the Episcopal See of  Moray  after they came to have Possessions in the South and spred there into many noble Branches  This  Willielmus  de  Moravia Dominus  de  Bothwel Drumshargard Panetarius Scotiae  was one of the great Barons summoned to  Bervick  as an Auditor of the Claims of the  Bruce  and the  Baliol  anent the Succession to the Crown  ibidem His Title of Drumshargard distinguishes him from another Sir William de Moravia de Tilybardin mentioned in the same Write of Summons  when that great Affair was in Agitation and which afterward was by King  Edward  I of  England  determined in favour of  John  de  Baliol  how justly I shall not say  The same illustrious Person according to the Devotion of those Times gave for the Safety of his Soul

great Lover of Antiquities  where they were deposited by Bishop  Beaton  at the Reformation in  Scotland  By his Wife Daughter of Sir  John Cuming  Lord of  Badenoch  Winton's History in Bib Jurid MS

de Bothwel penes D Abercarny which Piece of History is the best vouched and instructed of any of that kind I have ever perused and it carries a great Air of Antiquity with it and is very nobly oramented with accurate Historical Remarks and well deserves the Character of a curious Book the Author beside other Instructions for the Original descent of the Murrays of Drumshargard and Abercarnie from the Moravii of Bothwel does very judiciously observe that both the Baronies of Bothwell and Drumshargard now called Camslang were in the Person of Sir William de Moravia Panetarius Scotiae design'd Dominus de Bothwel and Drumshargard and indeed can I observe be well made out from comparing the English Foedera Prynne and the Chartulary of Glasgow together and that immediately upon his Death they came to be two distinct Lordships Andrew being Lord of Bothwel Sir William's Eldest Son whom we know was so by his hereditary Office of Panetarius Scotiae and Sir John whom my Author calls his Younger Son was Lord Dominus de Drumshargard and which he makes well appear and concludes it's plain he was Sir William's second Son for his patrimonial Estate of Drumshargard lay contiguous with and was a part of his Lordship of Bothwel and given him off by his Father for in Matters of so remote Antiquity we conclude for certain what is instructed so rationally by such Manuscripts as are neither contradicted by Writes nor any Authentick History but confirmed by constant uninterrupted and universal Tradition  in  Perthshire  Andrew  de  Moravia Panetarius Scotiae Dominus  de  Bothwel  was just such a Patriot as his Father whom he did not long survive for he lost his Life in the Attempt at  Stirling  to redeem his Country from the Subjection and Slavery it was under to the  English  on the memorable  th September    Buchanan and Abercromby  leaving Sir  Andrew  his Son and Heir who tracing the Steps of his noble and loyal Father in a firm and resolute Adherence to the Interest of his Country of which he had given such pregnant Instances and of his eminent Courage and Conduct in diverse Encounters with the opposite Party that he was thought worthy to be joined with Sir  William Wallace  in the Command of the Army which  Anno  entered  England  and performed such Actions of wonderful Courage that they became very terrible to the Enemy and thereafter when  Robert  the  Bruce  took upon him the Title of King of  Scotland  and declared his Purpose of doing all was in his Power toward the Redemption of his Country and the retriving of the Independency of the Nation no body appeared more hearty in his Interest than Sir  Andrew Murray  or stood more firm to that Glorious Monarch in all the Vicissitudes of Fortune that befell him And it was no doubt in Reward of his great Merit that the King bestowed upon him his Sister the Lady  Christian Bruce  in Marriage  Carta Rob I Domino Andreae de Moravia Panetario Scotiae Cristianae Sponsae suae sorori nostrae carissimae de

King  Robert  he was no less so to his Son King  David  the II to whose Interest inviolably adhering he was one of those Patriots who joined the Governour and came to his Assistance before the Battle of  Duplin  where he signalized his Courage insomuch as he was upon the Death of the Earl of  Mar  the Governour unanimously elected Regent in his Room and he held that great Office except a little time he was a Prisoner in  England  with the universal Approbation of the whole Nation and the Applause of all Men even till his Death  Anno    Buchanan says that having reduced Lothian to the Obedience of his lawful Soveraign King David to give himself a little Relaxation he made a progress into the North to visit his own Lands and Possessions Transmontana praedia intervisit which no doubt was his own old Northern Estate in Elginshire and out of which his Sons made Mortifications to the Cathedral Church of Elgine where their Father was interr'd  whose Character drawn  by the Great  Buchannan  I cannot pass over Speaking of his Death he says  summum apud omnes bonos desiderium sui reliquit  was much regrated by all good Men and that  tantas enim res biennio ac semestri quibus in Magistratu fuit gessit ut suffecturae cujuslibet magni Ducis aetati viderentur  He was solemnly interr'd with his Ancestors in the Cathedral Church of  Elgin  under a Canopy of free Stone in Armour as big as the Life with his Coat of Arms over him Dr  Johnstoun  celebrates his praises in a very handsome Poem which I shall take the Liberty to insert here by way of Epitaph  Obvius armato quoties sese

the Lordship of  Bothwel  as Heir Male out of which he was kept by the power of the Earl of  Dowglas  and adduces many Arguments to prove that point  History of the Panetarii Scotiae penes D Abercarny the Author of this History represents that Archibald Earl of Dowglass who married the Heiress of Bothwel was a very bold Man That it was he who oppressed Thomas Fleming out of the Earldom of Wigtoun because it lay contiguous to the Earl's Lordship of Galloway That it was the same Earl of Dowglas who influenced King Robert the III to break the Marriage Articles he had entred into with the Earl of March whereby the Prince the King's Son was to have married the Earl of March's Daughter and in place of that Lady to substitute Elisabeth Dowglas his own Daughter And who says he is so much a stranger to our History as not to know that from the Time of this Earl till the extinction of the Stem of that Illustrious Family the Earls of Dowglas did not overaw the Crown and were too great

Armies which he commanded with great Success and Glory till in which time he performed such Actions as wanted nothing but a better Cause to have made his Fame immortal But War being then decreed against  Scotland  by the Parliament and an Army appointed to march thither he declared his Resolution not to command it or invade that Kingdom and thereupon laid down his Commission which soon after was bestowed on  Oliver Cromwell  then Lieutenant General under him  What the Reasons were that induced this great Man to lay down so high and important a Command was at that time variously reported some as  Clarendon  relates imputing it to his Affection and Kindness to  Scotland  of which he had always been a great favourer and whereof he was born a Peer but others to his not being satisfied with the Parliaments having pusht things so far against the King and to his secretly favouring the Interest of his Son K  Charles  II then admitted to the Government in that Kingdom and crowned there which Opinion was confirmed by the Part he afterwards acted at the Restauration In order to which he entered very early into Measures with General  Monk  to whom he gave considerable Assistance in the Prosecution of that glorious Design upon the happy issue whereof he had the Honour to be one of the Commissioners which composed the solemn Deputation sent by the Parliament to the King upon that great Occasion and arriving at the  Hague  was received by his Majesty with singular Favour and Goodness and great Marks of Honour and Esteem which he ever after continued to wards him notwithstanding

of the Earl of  Carnwath  to perpetuate the Memory of a brave and hazardous Exploit perform'd in taking down from the Gallows the Body of a Favorite of King  Kenneth II  hung up by the Picts For as the Story goes the King being exceedingly grieved that the Body of his Minion and Friend should be so disgracefully treated he profer'd a considerable Reward to any of his Sub+jects who would adventure to rescue his Corps from the Disgrace his Enemies had put upon him But  adds he  When none would undertake this hazardous Interprise at last a certain Gentleman came to the King and said  Dalziel  which signifies  I Dare  and actually did perform that noble Exploit to his immortal Honour And in Memory of it got the foresaid remarkable Bearing and afterward his Posterity took the Word  Dalziel  for their Sirname and the Interpretation of it  I Dare  as the Motto of their Family  But the first of this Name I have found upon Record was Sir  Robert de Dalziel  Knight who faithfully

and the Yoke of a Foreign Power Were it here proper to enter on a particular detail of his Actions I could even add a great deal more for the Honour of his Memory than what the latest Writers of his Life have said upon that Subject But in regard of the Brevity of this Work it shall suffice to say no Age has produced a more extraordinary Man than King  Robert  the  Bruce  examine all the Heroes of  Plutarch  and all those great Men that have lived since that Historian and it will be difficult to find any upon Record who possessed more  eminently all those Virtues and Qualities that enter into the Composition of a great Man All I shall further add shall he to take notice of his Children not only such as have been mentioned by our Historians but others who have been very unaccou  tably

Douglass  THIS Family is a very great and ancient one in  Lanark  shire of which there is a particular History  wrote by a very learned Pen who equalizes them to any of the ancient  Roman  Families and gives them the preference to all other in  Europe  those of crown'd Heads excepted They have been particularly famous for great Generals there having been more of this Name than any other that is to be met with in History neither was it their native Countrey alone that was indebted to their Valour but they signaliz'd themselves in most places of  Europe  and particularly in  France  where they have had great Commands and Titles as Duke of  Turrin Count de Longoville  c In short this Family exceeded all the rest in the Kingdom for the Number of Nobility and Gentry of their own Name according to those old Lines  So many so good as of the  Douglasses  have been  Of one Sirname was ne'er in  Scotland  seen  The Origin of this illustrious House is derived from one  Sholto  who in the Reign of  Solvathius  King of  Scotland Anno Christi  having been the principal Man that routed  Donald Bane  and his Forces who in+vaded the Countrey and being a  Dou glass  or a black pale Man as these Words signify says my Author both in old  British  and  Irish  the King royaly rewarded his Services and made him a Grant of large Pos+sessions in the County of  Lanerk  which either he or his Successors called  Douglass  and from thence took the Sirname of the Family This  Sholto  was the Father of  Hugh  of whom there is nothing memorable He was succeeded in his Inheritance by his eldest Son  Hugh  II whose younger Brother  William  being sent by  Achaius  King of  Scotland  pursuant to his League with  Charlemaign  with choice Men into  Italy  against the  Lombard  's he performed many glorious Actions and became the Root of the Family of  Scoti  at  Placentia  But to leave the Family of the  Scoti  in  Italy William  is supposed to be the Son of  Hugh  Lord of  Douglass  and the Father of  John  who was the Father of  William  the next Lord of the Family who is Witness among others to the Charter of King  William  whereby he confirm'd the Lands of  Dalgarnac  given by  Adger  the Son of  Dovenald  to the Church of the Holy Cross at  Edinburgh  in the former part of that Reign He left Issue two Sons  Archibald  who succeeded in the Lordship and  Bricius  first Prior of  Lisma  agoe

for which his Memory will still be honoured He entred early into the Service of King  Robert Bruce  and in  Abercrombie's Martial Atchievments  he assaulted and took the Castle of  Roxburgh  from the  English  and the next Year he commanded the left Wing of the  Scots  Army at the famous Battle of  Bannockburn  where he behav'd so well as to merit the Honour of Knighthood in the Field  Barber's

Bruce's  Coronation to the time of his Death in which happened fighting against the  Saracens  the Enemies of our Faith Now tho what is above recorded of this noble Lord were alone sufficient to preserve his Memory yet cannot I omit adding this Epitaph which Mr  Hume  gives him  Quicquid sors potuit mortali in pectore ferre  Vel facere hoc didici perficere atque pati  Prima ubi luctando vici

of his own Body In he resigned the Lordship of  Douglass  in favours of Sir  William  his Nephew Son of  Archibald  Lord of  Galloway  who was slain at the Battle of  Halydonhill  so fatal to the  Scots Anno  whereupon he obtained from King  David Bruce  a Charter  De omnibus terris reditus possessiones per totum regnum Scotiae de quibus quondam Jacobus Dominus de Douglass avunculus suus Archibaldus pater suus obierunt vestiti cum regalitate libera warena integre honorifice una cum ducatu hominum Vicecomitatum de Roxburgh Selkrig  In the he was Warden of the  East Marches toward  England  and accompanying King  David  to the Battle of  Durham  he was taken Prisoner with his Sovereign  Hume  but was soon afterward released In he was one of the Commissioners on the part of  Scotland  authorized to treat with the  English  about the Redemption of the King  Rymer's Foedera Angliae  and among other Nobles bound to  Edward  III for a hundred thousand Pound  Sterling  Ransom in which Deed he's designed  Willielmus Dominus de Douglass miles  Much about the same time he was dignified with the Honour of Earl of  Douglass  for I find him intituled  Willielmus comes de Douglass  when he's joined in Commission with diverse Lords to treat with  English  Commissioners about King  David  's Inlargement  Rymer  This Earl was deeply engaged on the  French  side in the memorable Battle of  P  ictiers  where  John  King of  France  was taken Prisoner by the  Black Prince  and very narrowly escaped being then Ambassador from King  Robert  II to the  French  Court where the ancient Alliance betwixt the two Crowns was renewed and confirmed As for his Works of Piety I have only discover'd that he gave in pure Alms to the Abby of  Melross  and the Monks serving and perpetually to serve God there the Patronage of the Church of  Cavers  with its Tithes for celebrating Divine Service there according to the Tenor of a special Ordination by him made  viz  for certain Priests who were to perform that Service for the good Estate of his Sovereign Lord King  David  and of himself during his Life and for the health of his Soul and his Ancestors and Successors after his Departure hence and which Donation the said King ratified in the th of his Reign  He married first  Margaret  Daughter of  Donald  Sister and at length sole Heir of  Thomas  Earl of  Mar  Here I take the liberty to differ from Mr Hume who says this Earl's first Marriage was with the Earl of March's Daughter and that he had by her James Earl of Douglass killed at Otterburn which is a Mistake for I have seen a Mortification by Margaret Countess of Douglass and Mar to the Church of St Mary of Garrioch for the Soul of William Earl of Douglass her Husband and James Earl of Douglass her Son and Heir Also there's a Confirmation by the same Earl James to the Monks of Melross of the Church of Cavers wherein he's designed Comes de Douglass Mar Moreover 'tis to be considered that upon the Decease of Earl James Isabel his Sister of the whole Blood succeeded him in the Honour of Mar when the Earldom of Douglass devolved upon Archibald their Brother of the half Blood  by whom he had  James  his Son and Heir and  Isabel  a Daughter after the Death of her Brother Countess of  Mar  who became first the Wife of Sir  Malcolm Drummond  of  Cargill  who in Right of her was intituled Lord  Mar  Charta penes Ducem de Douglass  and thereafter of Sir  Alexander Steuart  Knight in whose favour she resign'd the said Earldom  Anno    Causa  says she  Matrimonii contracti inter dominum Alexandrum Senescal nos dictam Isabellam  Charta in Rotulis Roberti III  which Honour he enjoy'd till his Death  This Earl  William  's second Marriage having Divorc'd his former Wife was with  Margaret  Daughter of  Patrick  Earl of  March  This is with greater Probability than that he was Brother by the same Mother to James Earl of Douglass killed at Otterburn for when he succeeded to the Honour and Estate of Douglass he made no Claim to Mar which descended to Isabel Earl James's Sister as is above narrated  by whom he had  Archibald  Lord  Galloway  afterward Earl of  Douglass  And his third and last was  Margaret  Daughter and Heir of  Thomas Steuart  Earl of  Angus  by whom he had  George Douglass  first Earl of  Angus  of that Name He departed this Life in and was interr'd in the Abby Church of  Melross  according to Mr  Winton  whose Words are these  To  Douglasdale  as I heard say  An Sickness took him by the way  And there he dyed in short space    To  Melrose  then they took his Body  And there it bury it right honourably  This Earl was succeeded by  James  his Son between whom and Sir  Henry Percy  there were glorious Feats of Arms performed in Honour of their Country He was killed at the Battle of  Otterburn  of  July  fought betwixt him and Sir  Henry Hotspur  Son to the Earl of  Northumberland  an Encounter says one managed with that unparallelled Courage on both sides that it was hardly to be matched in History and was the Occasion of an old Rhime of which this is a part  It fell about the  Lammas  Tide  When Yeoman win the Hay  The doughtie  Douglass  gan to ride  In  England  to take a Prey  Mr  John Johnston  our famous Poet has endeavoured on his Part to perpetuate his Memory by the following Elegy  Quaeritis ô quid agam en animam jam

Courage and Conduct of a certain Labourer who perceiving his Countrymen flying before the conquering Enemy he and his two Sons stopped them with their  Plow Gear  in a certain Defile and upbrading them for their Cowardice obliged them to rally whom the  Danes  supposing to be fresh Succours he became thereby the means of transferring the Victory to the  Scots  side And King  Kenneth  advanced

Ancient Times is thought by the learned  Spelman  and  Selden  to have been the King's principal Minister in a Province no doubt invested with a Power of Administration of Justice to which certain honourary Priviledges were annexed 'Tis thought it was not at the first Institution properly a Title of Dignity but of Service They were of two kinds either such as served the King in greater Places of Eminency who were called  Thani Majores  or  Thani Regis  as the Thanes of  Fife Caithness Argyle  and  Murray  were these that served under them were termed  Thani Minores  But when the Title of  Comes  and  Dux  became Hereditary so the Learned are of Opinion the Title and Privileges of  Thani Majores  did descend with the Lands from Fathers to their Children tho the lesser did not yet they still retained the old Name of Thanes and Thanedoms as the Baronies of  Boyn  in  Ba  ff  shire and  Calder  in  Murray  c are called to this Time And perhaps the Difference betwixt the two consisted in this That the greater  Thanes  derived their Power and Authority immediately from the King and held them of the Crown  in capite  for Knights Service which by a certain Constitution made them Hereditary and were of the same kind with them that afterward came to be Parliamentary Barons The lesser  Thanes  had only Commissions from them and were held in the ordinary way for Services done and to be done All our Histories do agree that  Mackduff  formerly  Thane  was created Earl of  Fyfe  by King  Malcolme Canmore Anno    Balfour and other Scots Historians  and that in Consideration of his extraordinary Services to that Prince in assisting him to revenge his Father's Death upon  Mackbeth  and to recover his Crown for which he gave him and his Heirs these great and noble Privileges  I That his Posterity should have the Honour to place the succeeding Kings in the Chair of State at their Coronations  II That they should lead the Van of the Royal Armies  III That if any within the th Degree in Relation to his Family should be guilty of the unpremeditated Slaughter or casual Homicide of a Gentleman he should pay twenty four Merks of Silver and but twelve if a Plebeian for Expiation of the Crime flying to a Sanctuary near  Newburgh  in  Fyfe  on the Confines of  Strathern  Which was much the same Privilege granted to  Mackduff's  Kindred as the Cities of Refuge were to the  Isralites Joshua  At the Place of  Girth  there was an high Cross erected containing an Inscription of old  Macaronick  Verses a Mixture of  Latin Saxon Danish  and old  French  Words to this Purpose

Ancestors possest when Sirnames became first fashionable so 'tis not to be doubted but the Sirname of  Gray  has the same Derivation Some are of Opinion that it took its Rise from a City in the  Franche Compte  which is still so named others and among those  Francis de Bellowforest  derives the Sirname of  Gray  from the Castle of  Gray  in  Picardy  and adds That one  Rollo  Chamberlain to  Robert  Duke of  Normandy  who possest the aforesaid Castle was the first who assumed that Sirname However 'tis certain one  Anchitil de Gray  came over to  England  with  William  the Conqueror and that when the general Survey was made in the th of that King's Reign he held many Lands in  Oxford  Shire and elsewhere From him many great and illustrious Families in  England  are descended as the Dukes of  Kent  and  Suffolk  the Earl of  Stamford  the Barons  Gray  of  Chilingham  and  Werk  with their numerous Cadets whose Names and Heroick Actions are frequently to be met with in the  English  History  That the Lord  Gray  in  Scotland  has his Descent from some of these cannot be doubted Mr  Camden  the great  English  Antiquary and others of our own Country also are mistaken as to the Time of their Ancestors coming to  Scotland  as will appear afterward but they assert and with great Probability That the first of this most noble Family was a Son of the House of  Chilingham  indeed the Armorial Bearing of both Families are still the same and 'tis observable that the Lands of  Browfield  the first Inheritance of the  Grays  in  Scotland  ly in the County of  Roxburgh  or  Teviotdale  at no great Distance from  Chilingham  in  Northumberland  which Lands were given off in the Reign of King  Robert  I to Sir  Andrew Gray  his Son who and his Posterity enjoyed the same for several Generations till  Andrew  Lord  Gray  who was JusticeGeneral in the Time of King  James  III exchanged them with the Earl of  Angus  for  Brughtie  Castle  Bagilo  and the Fishings thereof Now every Body knows that some Northern Counties of  England  and  Northumberland  in particular were some Times possest by the Kings of  Scotland  and 'tis well known that some of those who held Lands of the Crown of  Scotland  in the Northern Counties  of  England  had also Possessions within  Scotland  the  Bruces  and  Baliols  and many others did so And when War broke out betwixt the Two Nations the Families so stated divided among themselves and adhered to either of the Kings in whose Dominions they had largest Possessions Thus it is probable that Sir  Andrew Gray  the first whom we find on Record with us adhered to King  Robert the Bruce  whose Subject he was upon the Account of his  Scots  Estate This Sir  Andrew  was undoubtedly a brave Man and a great Favourite of that glorious Monarch  Robert  I from whom he had a Grant the th of  February  the th Year of his Reign  Anno  of the Barony of  Long forgan  in the Shire of  Perth  and of many other Lands in  Forfar  Shire for his good and faithful Services as the Charter bears  Charta penes Dominum Gray  He also acquired the Lands of  Broxmouth  in the County of  Roxburgh  from Sir  Alexander Fraser  Kt and these Two Records which I my self have seen and perused tho' there were no other extant do sufficiently confute a very gross Mistake of  Boethius Buchanan  and  Camden  who say That the first of this noble Family came only to  Scotland  with King  James  I when he was relieved from his Captivity out of  England Anno  whereas the Chief of this Family another Sir  Andrew Gray  was by the Estates of  Scotland  sent to  England  one of the Hostages for that King's Ransom but of this afterward With whom this gallant Sir  Andrew  was married it does not appear but from the Archives of the Family of  Gray  'tis evident he left a Son Sir  John Gray  who succeeded him in his Estate who in several Records is stil'd Lord of  Broxmouth  as are several of his Descendents after him  This  John Gray de Gray Dominus de Broxmouth  had a Grant of the Lands of  Craigie  in the County of  Forfar  from  William de Troup  for a very valuable Consideration mentioned therein and that Grant was confirmed to him by King  David  II the th of  September  the Twenty Seventh Year of his Reign  Anno  with whom it would appear he was no less in Favour than his Father had been with the great King  Robert  I find this noble Person had very great Superiorities beside his own proper Estate as a Proof of which there is a Charter granted to him by  Hugode Giffard  whereby he acknowledges Sir  John Gray  to be Superior Lord to  Henry de Fotheringham  of the Lands of  Lourenston  and  Huhcuman  now call'd  Littleton  of the Date at  Langforgan ultime Februarii    Ibidem  I find also that  John Gray  was  Custos Rotulorum Registri  in the Reign of King  David Bruce  and likewise of his Successor King  Robert  II who had for Pension during Life  ducentos solidos Sterlingorum  out of the Profits of the Court of the Chamberlain and Justiciary  Charta in Archivis David II ad Annu  etiam Charta in Rotulis Roberti II  a Sallary that has been observed by a learned and judicious Person to amount to as much as the Constable or Marischal enjoyed as the Fees of their Offices in those Days To whom Sir  John Gray  the Lord of  Broxmouth  was married it does not appear from any Record of the Family but 'tis clear that he left Two Sons  John  the eldest who was one of the Hostages for the Ransom of his Royal Sovereign King  David Anno    Rymer's l'oedera Angli    with whom he had been made a Prisoner at the Battle of  Durham  in the Year and Sir  Patrick  who succeeded him in his great Estate and in the Royal Favour for King  Robert  II in a Charter to this Sir  Patrick Gray  designed Lord of  Broxmouth  and to  Margaret  his Wife of sundry Lands in the Barony of  Longforgan  the King gives  him the distinguishing Appellation of  Co  sanguineus Noster  Charta penes Dominum Gray  likeas he had by the said King  pro Retinentia sua  a yearly Pension of  L    s    d Sterling  and that during Life  Ibidem  which is all I have found memorable of him By  Margaret  his Wife aforesaid but of

HAMILTON Duke of  Hamiltoun  AS this illustrious and most noble Family is the first of the Peerage of  Scotland  so it is one of the most considerable whether we Respect the Nobleness of its Extraction the Multiplicity of its Branches or the Grandeur of its Alliances and tho' they are not of so long a Continuance in this Realm as some others mentioned in this Work yet 'tis sufficient to say That this noble House has been established by an undenyable and uninterrupted Succession of full Four Hundred Years and had the Honour to be grac'd with the Intail of the Crown and imperial Dignity of this Realm One Hundred and Sixty Years ago which was ratified in a full Assembly of the three Estates of Parliament to which all of them set their Seals  I must acknowledge I have not had the Honour to peruse the more ancient Writes of the Family of  Hamiltoun  wherefore I am obliged to rely upon the Account given me from Mr  Hamilton  of  Wishaw  an Antiquary of no little Fame who says  "That Sir  Gilbert Hamilton  the first of this illustrious Race who transplanted himself from the Kingdom of  England  was extracted from the ancient Earls of  Licester  of whose Grant his Progenitor had Lands in that County called  Hamilton  from whence they assumed a Sirname and that the occasion of his coming to  Scotland  is delivered by Historians after this manner"  Sir  Gilbert say they  at the Court of  Edward II  chanced to talk with Honour and Respect of the great Merit of King  Robert  the  Bruce  whereupon one  John del Spencer  gave him a Blow which arrogant Treatment he resented so highly that encountering him the next Day he killed him and to avoid punishment fled to  Scotland  where he was well received by King  Robert  Who to make amends for what he had forfaulted on his account at home generously rewarded him with the Barony of  Cadzow  in the county of  Lanerk  then an appendage of the Crown  He was a very brave Man and to him are ascribed a vast many great Exploits particularly that he distinguished his Valour and Conduct in the decisive Battle of  Bannockburn  which happened on the the th of  July  so eminently that he was knighted in the Field and got a Gift of diverse Lands My former Author further informs me that he was matched with a Lady of the Family of the  Randolphs  rais'd in that Reign to the Honour of Earl of  Murray  by whom he had two Sons Sir  Walter  his Successor and Sir  John Hamilton  of  Rossaven  Knight of whom sprung the Family of  Prestoun in Vicde Edinburgh  and its Branches To Sir  Gilbert  's Memory this Epitaph was composed by a famous Author  Iure ego deserui patriam veteresque penates  Nempe fidem jus fas deserit illa prius  Jam nova jura libens inii sub rege benigno  Qui profugo patriam qui potiora dedit  Hinc res at que decus fortunaque laeta secuta est  Hinc regum thalamis nobilitata domus  Esto solum verti at patriam inveni haec dedit auxit  Quae modo perdideram quae potui illa dedi  Sir  Walter  his Son was a Man of great Fame and Character he had several Military Commands in the Service of  Robert  I which he perform'd with great Diligence and Success in Consideration whereof he had by that Prince's Grant a Charter of the Barony of  Cadzow  to be held in as ample manner as Sir  Gilbert  his Father held the same Also in the th of the same Reign to reward his great Merit and acceptable Services he had a Grant of the Barony of  Machanshire  in the County of  Lanark  which formerly belonged to  John Cumin  Knight Further in the the King bestowed on him the Lands of  Kinneil Larber Brimage  and  Auldcathie  in the Shire of  Linlithgow  and the very same Year the Lands of  Kirkinder  and  Kirkowen  in the County of  Wigtoun  for good Services done and to be done by him as the Charter bears Thus by his Princes Bounty and Favour arriving to great Wealth and Honour he strengthened his Family by a very noble Alliance taking to Wife  Isobel  Daughter of  William  Earl of  Ross  Wishaw's Account of the Family of Hamilton  and Neice to the King by her Mother by whom he had two Sons who survived him Sir  David  and Sir  John Hamilton  from whom the Families of  Innerweek Ballincrieff  and the present Earl of  Haddingtoun  are descended  To Sir  Walter Hamilton  succeeded Sir  David  his Son who served King  David  II in his Wars against the  English  He was with the King at the unfortunate Battle of  Durham Anno  where he was taken Prisoner with his Master  Mr Rymer's Foedera Angli  but paying a Ransom he was released That he had great esteem from that King is plain enough for in the th of his Reign he had a special Grant of all the Lands which belonged either to Sir  Gilbert  his Grandfather or Sir  Walter  his Father in any part of the Realm  The Charter is dated September  and at the same time the King was pleased to discharge for ever to him and his Heirs a Feuduty that had been formerly payable to the Exchequer out of the Barony of  Cadzow  a Sign of the Prevalency of his Interest at that Prince's Court where Men of Merit were only imployed In the th of King  Robert  II  Anno  he had Summons to Parliament and appends his Seal to the Act recognizing his Majesty's Title to the Crown and in settling the Succession upon all the King's Children lawfully begotten either by  Elisabeth Mure  his first Wife or  Euphame Ross  then his Queen  Acts of Parliament still extan  in the Records where he is mentioned in both  What is further remarkable of this Sir  David  is That according to the Devotion of that Age when Donatives to the Church could sanctifie and merit for any Person he gave in pure and perpetual Alms to the Cathedral  Church of  Glasgow  an Annuity of Ten Merks  Sterl  out of the Barony of  Kinneil  for the Support of a qualified Person to celebrate Divine Service at the Altar of the Blessed  Virgin Mary  in the said Church  Pro salute animae Roberti quondam Regis Scotiae nec no  pr  prosperitate serenissimi

could not procure any Memoirs of him proper to be inserted here His Wife was  Janet  Daughter of Sir  James Douglass  of  Dalkeith  Ancestor to the Earl of  Morton  By her he had  Sir  James  his Successor  David  who first founded the Family of  Dalserf in Vic de Lanark  of whom the  Hamiltons  of  Blackburn Allarshaw Ladyland Green  and others derive themselves  Thomas  of whom descended the House of  Raploch  out of which issued the  Hamiltons  of  Torrence Stanhouse Woodhall Aikenhead Dechmont Barns  and several flourishing Branches in the Kingdom of  Ireland  of which the Earl of  Glenbrysall  was the Head  Having done with the younger Brothers I proceed with Sir  James Hamilton  of  Cadzow  the eldest Son who in the with  David  his Brother obtained Letters of safe Conduct from  Henry  IV to come into  England  as far as the Castle of  Calthorp  in the County of  Lincoln  yet on what occasion is not said  Mr Rymer's Foedera Angliae ad Annum  And twelve Years after when

Baillies Notes on the Family of Hamiltoun    in Vic de Lanark  His second Wife was  Euphame  Daughter of  Patrick Graham  Earl of  Strathern  Countess Dowager of  Douglass  by whom he had a Son and two Daughters  Sir  John Hamilton  of  Shawfield in Vic de Lanark  Mary  married to  William  Earl  Marishal  Elisabeth  to  David  Earl of  Crawfurd  afterward Duke of  Montrose  NOTA  Here it will I apprehend be neither improper nor ungrateful to my Reader to offer some Considerations to obviate that Ass  rtion of George Buchanan and other Historians who have copied and translated from him who insinuate th  t the Lady Mary the King's Sister was forced by her Brother to marry James Lord Hamilton when Thomas Boyd Earl of Arran her Husband was alive And this is generally believed by every Body who reads George Buchanan's History and enquire no more about it but depend on our Affairs as wrote by him who indeed to do him Justice was a very learned and polite Person and has wrote the History of Scotland not much inferior in Style to the best Roman Authors I shall here offer what I have observed in relation to this Affair All Histories commend the Lady Mary's Affection to her Husband and tell us That she could not be prevailed with to forsake or desert him when he fell into Disgrace but transported her self with him into foreign Parts to share with him in his Misfortunes and sojourned with him in Denmark and Flanders for some time till she understood from Scotland that her Presence and Solicitation with her Brother might prevail with him to suffer my Lord Arran to return home to his Native Country and accordingly she came to Scotland But the King continuing inexorable and the Lady detain'd from going abroad the poor unfortunate Earl of Arran soon after died of Grief at Antwerp She continuing a Widow till the is then I find married to James Lord Hamilton Moreover I'm told by Mr Hamilton of Wishaw that the Contract of Marriage is still preserved among the Archives of the Family but I have not seen it but there is a Charter in my hands dated the th of July to James Lord Hamilton and the Lady Mary Stewart the King's Sister of the Lands of Kinneil c Moreover I think the Testimony of Mr John Ballenden Arch Dean of Murray who was Co temporary with the Lady whom we find alive in the and for ought I know lived much longer ought to be regarded He at the Command of King James V translated Hector Boethius History of Scotland into English printed in the Year under this Title  The History and Cronicles of  Scotland  compleated and newly corrected and amended by the reverend and noble Clerk Mr  Hector Boeis  Canon of  Aberdeen  translated by Mr  John Ballenden  ArchDean of  Murray  and Canon of  Ross And there he says Book Cap  The first Daughter of King  James II  was married to the Lord  Boyd  of whom was begotten a Son whilk was slain by the Lord  Montgomery  and a Daughter married to the Earl of  Cassils  and after the Death of the Lord  Boyd  this Daughter of King  James II  was married on the Lord  Hamilton  and that way the House of  Hamilton  is Decorit in the King  's  Blood  I say I think the Authority of this learned and ingenuous Author should determine any Man of Judgment more than a posterior Partywriter such as every one knows George Buchanan was with all Deference to his Character otherways For every Body may perceive who reads his Book that he takes all Opportunities to blacken and misrepresent this nob  e Family sometimes with very great Inconsistency with himself as a judicious Historian and if this be not sufficient to disprove this part of Buchanan's History take also the Testimony of a very ingenious Foreign Historian Ralph Holinshed who wrote a History of Scotland wherein he says  "That after the Death of the Lord Boyd the Daughter of King James II was married to the Lord Hamilton"  But how far will not an Author depart from Truth who is the devoted Servant of any Party as Buchanan was who wrote the latter part of his History to serve a particular turn well enough known  James  Lord  Hamilton  was succeeded by  James  his Son who was constituted one of the Lords of the Privy Council  Anno  in which Station he continued till from some Mistake he entred into that memorable League with the Earls of  Douglass Ross Crawfurd Murray  and  Ormond  wherein they solemnly swore never to desert one another during their Lives that Injuries done to any one of them should be considered as done to them all that they should concurr against whatsoever Persons within or without the Realm and spend their Lives Goods and Fortunes in Defence of each other But when Sir  James Hamilton  discerned their violent purposes against the King he sever'd himself from them and returned to his Duty whereupon ensued the ruin of the Earl of  Douglass  who persisted in his Rebellion In the Reign of King  James  III he was no less considered and valued than he had been by the former King for in the when a Treaty of Peace was set on foot with the  English  he was one of those noble Persons who met the Lord  Howard  and other Commissioners on the Part of the King of  England  and treated of a  League and Amity betwixt the two Nations Thereafter on the th of  March  he was with  William  Bishop of  Aberdeen David  Earl of  Crawfurd John  Lord  Darnly  and  Archibald Whitelaw  Secretary of State by a Commission under the Great Seal appointed to treat with the Ambassadours of  England  upon a lasting Peace betwixt the two Realms His excellent Qualities and heroick Virtues gain'd so much upon his Sovereign King  James  III that he was pleased to bestow upon him his Sister the Lady  Mary  Countess of  Arran  in Marriage the greatest Honour any Subject was capable of With this most vertuous Lady he lived in all conjugal Affection till the th of  November  he departed this Life  Obituary of Glasgow in the Chartulary of that Metropolitan See in the Hands of Alexander Baillie of CastleCarrie a

Which  James  being a Nobleman endowed with all the great Qualities suitable to his high Birth began early to distinguish himself in the publick Service in the Reign of King  James  IV for when he was very young his Majesty called him to his Privy Council and in the sent him to  England  to conclude his Marriage with  Margaret  eldest Daughter to  Henry  VII Soon after which the said King being sensible of his great Merit and eminent Services was pleased to give him the Earldom and create him Earl of  Arran  on the th of  August  where the remarkable Expressions used by his Majesty as the just Motives of bestowing the Honour are sufficient to illustrate those of his Posterity and are thus set furth in the preamble of his Patent  Sciatis nos propter propinquitatem sanguinis inter nos

jacen in Vicecomitatu  e Bute  c  Charter of Erection of the Earldom of Arran in favours of James Lord Hamilton in the publick Register of Charters This may likeways serve to correct the Mistake of those Historians who say That when James Lord Hamilton married the Sister of King James III that he got with her the Earldom of Arran which Marriage I have made evident was in the and yet this Grant of the Earldom of Arran was not to him nor his Son for Twenty Nine Years after the Marriage of his Father and Mother From this we may remark how George Buchanan and other Historians who copy from him are to be relyed on who take Materials and Vouchers of their Histories from other Authors who have wrote before them and never looked into the National Records where proper Materials for a Historian are to be found For I cannot imagine that Mr Buchanan ever gave himself the Trouble to turn over one Roll in the publick Archives of the Kingdom otherwise he could not but have discovered the Error of Robert III's Illegitmacy and many other Things relating both to the Royal Family as well as to this Noble Family I now write of for since the Time of King Robert the Bruce the Records are pretty full so that if diligently perused would have rectified many very gross Errors all our old Historians have fallen into whom Buchanan as to the History has followed exactly for he only turned their Books into that ornate Latine Style we now read his History of Scotland in For I cannot imagine Buchanan saw the Records otherwise he could not have been so Wicked or so Perverse an Historian as to have concealed Matters of Fact so evident there and of such importance to the Royal Family except ye suppose as indeed many do that he was well pleased to find that any before him had wrote of the illegitimacy of King Robert III and thereby to make it a Precedent for the Succession of another Bastard to the Crown who was his Patron in Prejudice of the lawful Heirs and James Duke of Chatlerault being then the presumptive Heir of the Crown failling of Queen Mary and her young Son King James VI I believe Mr Buchanan had a particular View to that in his malicious and false Aspersions against that most Noble and Worthy Lord and his Family both in his History and in another scurrilous Pasquil he wrote entitul'd  An Admonition to the true Lords  and which is the most false and most scandalous writing that ever flowed from the Pen of any Man of the least Worth which shall be answered elsewhere to the Conviction of any who will allow themselves to believe Truth all clearly made out from original Writings accidentally come into my Hands    His Lordship being now higher in Dignity the Year following had the Command of the Forces sent from  Scotland  to the Assistance of  Christian  II of  Denmark  which Service he happily perform'd with Conduct Diligence and Fidelity Having gone thus successfully through this Affair his royal Master again intrusted him with the Command of the Four Thousand Men sent into  France  to the Assistance of  Lewis  XII where he acquired immortal Honour and when that Service was over he returned Home richly rewarded by that Prince besides a Pension during Life While he stay'd in  France  the Death of King  James  IV happned in the un+fortunate Battle of  Flowdon  then he returned home to settle the disturbed State of his Native Country which ordinarily falls out in all Minorities and stood fair to have been elected Regent to the young King  Many  says my Author  gave their Voices for him as being nearest in Blood to the King and a Man affecting Peace more than others and every way sufficient for such a Charge  but he generously and justly yielded his Pretensions to his CousinGerman  John  Duke of  Albany  who was as near to the King in the Male as his Lordship was in the Female Line Upon the Duke's Promotion to the Supreme Government his Lordship was named Captain of the Castle of  Edinburgh  Drummond's History  Provost of that City and not long after Warden of the Marches toward  England  Also in the this Earl was appointed one of the Six Guardians of the Realm who were to Rule by Turns when  John  Duke of  Albany  went to  France  to renew the ancient League which had been kept inviolable for many Centuries past betwixt the two Realms There being nothing more to be found in History concerning this great Earl we shall draw toward the Close of his Life and observe his Marriages and Issue  His first Wife was  Beatrix  Daughter of  John  Lord  Drummond  Charta in Rotulis Jacobi IV  by whom he had only

Arran as it was led and deduced before Mr Patrick Coventree and other Judges delegate for that Effect in the and is still preserved in the Charter Chest of the Family whereby it appears she had been formerly married to Sir Thomas Hay who then was alive and so could not be married to any other Man This by the by is sufficient to correct the Mistake of the Author of a History of the Church of Scotland called  Knox's History  who makes James Duke of Chatlerault born in unlawful Wedlock in regard Elisabeth Hume his Father's first Wife was alive but that Author had not access to see or know of this Divorce otherwise I have more Charity for him than to think he would have transmitted a Falshood to Posterity  he was again enabled to marry so he next took to Wife  Janet  Daughter of Sir

Command of that Body which was sent to Desend the EastBorder where he soon heard the mortifying News of the Loss of the Army at  Solway  which was not long after attended with the Death of that Monarch who yielded his last Breath on the of  December  Then my Lord  Arran  was by the unanimous Consent of Parliament chosen Protector to the young Queen  Mary  and Governour of  Scotland  which

March to which all the Seals of the Noblemen Prelates and Burroughs are appended which I have seen and from which I took this Note    As soon as the Earl was in Possession of the Government he sent the Earl of  Glencairn  Sir  George Douglass William Hamilton  of  Sanquhar James Learmont  of  Balcomy  and Mr  Henry Balnaves  of  Hallhill  Secretary of State unto  England  in order to treat both about a Peace which was become necessary by reason of the King's Death and other concurring Circumstances and a Match betwixt the Infant Queen and  Edward  Prince of  England  Accordingly a Peace or at least an Abstinence as it was then termed and a Marriage betwixt the Queen and Prince  Edward  were agreed to and ratified by a great Majority in the Parliament which met at  Edinburgh  in  August    I need not mention in this place how this advantagious Union was spoiled by the then Clergy and the  French  Faction it being so fully treated on by Bishop  Lesly  and Mr  Buchanan  only I shall add what neither of them have taken much notice of That the Earls of  Huntly Argyle Montrose Bothwel Monteith  Lord  Fleeming  and a great many more of all Ranks entred into a most solemn Bond and notwithstanding of the Act of Parliament bound and obliged themselves to oppose the intended Match with  England  and consequential Union with all their Power tho' with the hazard of their Fortunes and Lives at the same time they endeavoured all they could to bring the Governour into a Complyance with the breach of the Treaty and the more effectually to win him over to them they proposed to secure the Crown to his Posterity by bestowing the Infant Queen upon the Lord  Hamilton  his eldest Son But so invincibly was he attached to what he thought the Interest of his Country and his own Reputation and Honour  in the Observation of a Treaty he himself had caused to be ratified in Parliament that he kept it inviolated on his part till King  Henry  VIII not only refused to ratify it on the other Part but also caused his Officers to seise upon a great many  Scots  Ships that had sailed to  England  loaden with  French  and  Scots  Commodities upon the Faith of the Treaty of Peace before concluded This undenyable Breach of the Articles condescended on the Governour resented to that degree that he called a Parliament in  December  and in it declared the Treaty to be void and null in regard the  English  had broke it first Then he applyed himself with the utmost Diligence to carry on a War and immediately raised what Forces he could to oppose the  English  Army that had invaded  Scotland  under the Command of the Lord  Evers  whom he encountred at  Ancrum  in  Teviotdale  and tho' they were to not above put them to the rout with considerable Loss on their Side and scarce a Man on his Lordship's Not long after this he was join'd by Monsieur  de Lerges  Count of  Montgomery  with  French  Auxiliaries and marched toward  England  in search of the Earl of  Hartford  who to retrieve the former Loss had entred  Scotland  and had already laid waste a great part of the  Merse  and  Teviotdale  but retir'd upon the approach of the  Scots  Army The Governour in his Turn invaded  England  beat the Enemy where ever he found them ravag'd the Country and return'd with the Glory of having defeated one Army and given the Chase to another in one Campaign Neither am I to forget that at this time King  Francis  I sent him the Ensigns of the most noble Order of St  Michael  To proceed in the when the Duke of  Somerset  was made Protector of  England  and Tutor to  Edward  VI upon the demise of  Henry  VIII in Prosecution of the War he invaded  Scotland  upon the head of a mighty Army seconded by a Fleet by Sea His Grace hastning to raise all the Force he could to oppose him so advancing toward  Pinkiecleugh  where the Enemy were incamped the  English  obtained the Victory on the th of  September  and left Eight Thousand  Scots  killed on the Field After which they ravaged the Country five Miles round sacked  Leith  and made an Attempt upon  Edinburgh  but by the Activity of the Governour they were repulsed with Loss After which his Lordship repaired to  Stirling  where he had appointed the Nobility to meet him In this Assembly he appeared not at all dejected or dispirited but addressed himself in this Speech that Monsieur  de Larrey  has thought fit to insert in his  French  History of  England  translated by an ingenious Author from whom I have presumed to borrow it  "I Doubt not but that many of you My Lords and more of the Vulgar whose forward preposterous Understandings seldom judge of Things but by the various Events they are liable to may be apt to disapprove a War that has been attended with Consequences so fatal to most of us I own that I advis'd you to Undertake it and as then so I am still of Opinion that 'tis one of these Evils the Glory and Liberty of the Nation do not allow us to avoid I know not but you may have other Sentiments at this time and have therefore call'd you together to congratulate your Magnanimity if you remain unshaken as I am in your Resolution to repulse the Encroachments made upon us  and if you are otherwise dispos'd as I hope you are not to upbraid your Fear the Inglorious Enemy of Reason and Courage When I took the Command of our Armies upon me you unanimously pre+ferr'd an Honourable War to a Peace you thought equally Unsafe and Disgraceful and shall we be so Mean as to yield to the first Signal Injustice of Fortune No I am perswaded that as Grating as our Misfortune at  Pinky  must needs be to you all you'll nevertheless choose to pursue a Noble Revenge rather than sit down with the Affront or submit to the threatn'd Slavery Come on't what will I am fix'd in my first Opinion and I had rather preserve the Monarchy at any rate I mean tho' at the Expence of such of the Subjects Fortunes and Blood as have been or may yet chance to be wasted than to spare the Estates and Lives of private Men tho' ever so Great or Deserving with the Loss of our Common Country Let us labour by all Means to save the Ship that saves all and to effect this let us not grudge to cut down the Mast nor to see our own Shares of the Loading thrown over Board If the Foundation of an Edifice stands firm 'tis no great Matter what comes of the Ceiling or Furniture Our private Losses are so many Sacrifices that are due to the Publick they weaken the State I own it but the Ruin of the State it self must needs involve us all in Universal Irretrivable Miseries Consider My Lords with what an Enemy we have to do and on what Terms we may purchase a Peace Our Enemy is he not the same old Inveterate One whose Avarice has by Unjust Wars so often attempted to Devour our Existence And is not this present War alone sufficient to make us tremble at the very Thought of falling under the Power of Tyrants so unconscionably Implacable We cannot descend to the Terms they propose without stooping under the Imperious Yoke of a People that thirst for our Blood and whose Insolence is whetted with Fury Cast your Eyes on the other Hand on your Ancient Unalterable Allies the  French  they never yet fail'd us in our greatest Exigencies and will not in the present Juncture of our Affairs Neither do we want Friends in  Italy  Nay there are few Potentates in  Europe  that will unconcernedly look on and behold our Destruction Resolve in fine Whether we had best Defend our Liberties or give them up Whether 'tis most expedient to die if it must be so Free and Independent or to live Eternal Slaves to our greatest Foes 'Tis true they offer us fair Things our Laws and Rights are by the Treaty to remain untouch'd But pray who is Guarrantee for this And if the  English  shall in an Aftergame either Break or Encroach upon the Articles agreed to Who will Redress our Grievances To what Tribunal shall we appeal 'Tis a Jest to offer to set up either for Liberty or Property when in effect we shall have given them away We must begin by surrendering our Mistress to a Husband that is to a Master which done I don't see why he may not as such subject her Crown to his own or rather Unite and Confound them in one And thus  Scotland  must inevitably become a County or Province of  England  'Tis impossible to reflect on the Ambitious Project without Horror and Detestation And how can we choose but to have the meanest Sentiments of and greatest Contempt imaginable  for such of our Countrymen as shall shew themselves Villains enough to comply The uncertain Events and Length of the War may perhaps intimidate some of us But is't the first time that  Scotland  has seen herself expos'd to Dangers of this kind When reduc'd to the like Extremities did ever our Ancestors hesitate to prefer their Honour to Life And are we so far Degenerated as to render our selves their Offspring unworthy of the inesteemable Treasure they purchas'd with so much Valour and transmitted to us with so much Glory Had the malign Influence of our Birth involv'd us in Slavery how far we had been oblig'd to endeavour the Recovery of that Freedom we had never enjoy'd I shall not determine but since we were born Free 'tis plain that our Posterity can never pardon our Cowardice if we become willing to resign the Independency our own Birth and Forefathers Courage have entitl'd us to I  but a part of our Estates and Honours were invaded we might plead some Pretence or Excuse for dispensing with it But the Body of the Nation is attack'd our Country nothing less than our Country is at Stake its Ancient Laws and Fundamental Constitution are on the Point of being subverted I cannot disown but that 'tis hard to tell what Success it shall please the Almighty to give to our Arms 'tis certain however that as we must bear with Patience those Maladies the Infirmity of Nature has made us liable to so we are oblig'd to suffer with Constancy such further Losses as the Enemy's good Fortune may procure us 'Tis not only in these our Days that the  Scots  Nation equal to the  Romans  in this Point have stood firm in the midst of Dangers or that they have conquer'd their hard Fate by the Steddiness of their Courage Let us for no reason affront the Memory of those Heroes that gave us a Being and far from following the Example of those in the  March  and  Teviotdale  let us rather detest the Infamy of their Defection The more Vigor we shall express by our Unanimity in this Meeting so much the more may we expect the Assistance of our Friends beyond Seas Nay Fortune her self seems to take Pleasure in raising that Virtue she has in vain attempted to depress One thing at least we are sure of the Boldness of our Resolutions cannot fail of conveying the Praises we shall deserve down to the old Age of Time whereas our Cowardice if express'd on this Occasion would render us Infamous and Unhappy at once"  This Speech so lively and so admirably well adapted to the Humour of the Nation at that time had its desired Effect The Nobility applauded his Design they talked of nothing but of Means to prosecute the War and whatever the Event might be they resolved to hazard all rather than submit to the  English  So it was agreed to have recourse to the King of  France  who they thought alone able to retrieve their Losses and to transact with him about marrying the Queen when fit for a Husband to  Francis  the first his Son the  Daulphine  Then the said King was pleased to create his Lordship Duke of  Chattlerault  in that Kingdom and to assign him for the better support of the Honour a Revenue of Livres a Year to him his Heirs and Assigneys for ever After which his Grace continued Governour of  Scotland  for six Years till the he resigned that great Post in full Parliament to the Queens Mother He was again declared to  be the presumptive Heir of the Crown failing Queen  Mary  and the Issue of her Body and this at a Time when he had devested himself of all Authority delivered up the  Regalia  and consequently was not in a Condition to influence the Members nor byass the Judgment of the Nation after which his Grace liv'd much at Home in a State suitable to his Quality imploying himself in the Service of his Country upon all Occasions with untainted Honour  When Queen  Mary  returned Home from  France Anno  her Majesty was pleased prudently to make choice of a new Privy Council all or most of whom were Protestants the better to conform her self to the present posture of Affairs and confiding much in the Duke of  Chattlerault  he was chose one of that Number wherein he worthily served her Majesty in settling the Kingdom then in no small Ferment always showing a great steddyness to the Interest of his Country and the Protestant Rel  gion The Queen having found the benefit of his faithful Services at Home was pleased in  Letter under the Privy Seal  to send him over to  France  to take care of her Interest there where he did all the Service he could that was consistent with his Honour and the Protestant Cause Here he continued till the Queen was forc'd to make the Resignation of the Government in favours of her Son the Prince Then the Duke of  Chattlerault  was called home to be the Head of the Loyalists  History of Scotland ad annum  So soon as he came to  Scotland  his Grace used his utmost endeavours to have had the Earl of  Murray  then Regent degraded from his usurped Authority the Queen reponed to the Exercise of her royal Power and the Peace of the Country restored and for that end by vertue of a Commission from her Majesty he gathered together what Forces he could raise in so short a time but seeing no manner of hopes of Assistance from  England  and knowing that a Civil War was just breaking out in  France  he resolved to make no other use of his Arms than to obtain to himself and his Friends honourable Conditions of Peace and the benefit of living quietly at Home till indulgent Providence should afford him an Opportunity of serving his Queen and his Country for which End the Bishop of St  Andrews  his Brother was sent to the Regent to procure a safe Meeting in order to bring their Differences to an Accomodation and the Time and Place being agreed to after many Disputes on both Sides the following Articles were drawn up and mutually signed which I shall set down in the primitive Style  "IT is desired for the part of my Lord Regent that my Lord Duke and his Adherents shall recognosce the King and his Authority and acknowledge themselves to be his Subjects and promise unto him Service Obedience and Fidelity in all time coming as their Sovereign"  "IT is required on the part of the Duke's Grace and his Adherents that every Nobleman be admitted to have his Place in Council as their Predecessors have been in all time of other Princes of this Realm And my Lord Regent bearing the King's Authority shall be sworn solemnly from that time forward to behave himself uprightly and indifferently to them as the remanent Noblemen of this Realm in all their honest and just Causes without Particularity or remembrance of any Offence conceived amongst them during the time of their Contraversies"  "  Item  That all these who shall be content in time coming to behave themselves as faithful Subjects to  the King and acknowledge their Obedience to him shall be restored to their Lands Bounds Heritages and Possessions notwithstanding the Doom of forefaulture led against them Providing always that this Benefit shall not extend to them that has been forfaulted for Art and Pa  rt of the Slaughter of umquhile the King's Father"  "  Item  That my Lord Regent and remanent Noblemen joyned with himself shall condescend to sick Heads and Articles as may re+dound  o the Queen's Honour Advancement and Commodit  and may best serve her Turn providing that the same be not prejudicial to the King nor his Sovereignty whereupon depends the Security of all Noblemen and others professing themselves to be his Subjects"  "And because my Lord Regent and others on his part are as well content to yield to thir reasonable Desir  s foresaid as to crave the Performance of his Desire towards the King's Obedience at their hands and w  lleth that all come toge  her at a time because now publick Leisure cannot serve to compleat these things that are necessary to be done to the Queen it is thought convenient that on tenth day of  April  next to come shall be assembled and conveened together at  Edinburgh  in quiet and peaceable manner thir Persons following They are to say my Lord  Regent  my Lord  Duke  the Earls of  Huntly Argyle Athol Mortone Marr Glencairn  and my Lord  Herries  "  "And in case of Absence of any of thir Nine Persons be Sickness or other lawful Impediment ane other Nobleman of that Party shall be chosen to supply his Place And there in Friendly manner to Treat Conclude and Agree upon sick Heads as shall be performed to the Queen and what the saids Persons shall find redound to her Honour without prejudice to the King the hail Noblemen on both sides shall condescend thereto And for the Security of the coming of the Nobility foresaid my Lord  Regent  promises on his Honour that they shall be Skaithless and without Danger in their Coming Remaining and Returning"  "  Item  It is agreed that my Lord Duke  Chattlerault  nor his Adherents shall not Challenge Use nor Execute no Authority of Lieutenandry be any Commission of the Queen or that any Impediment be made be them against the King's Authority in the mean time and ordains Forces of fensible Men on all sides to be dissolved that no Injury be done to any Subject be way of Deed"  "The Regent promises to perform upon his Honour so far as concerns his Part and therefore Wills the Duke's Grace the Earl of  Cassilis  and my Lord  Herries  to enter sufficient Pledges presently for performance of their Parts to wit for the Duke one of my Lord Duke's Sons for the Earl of  Cassilis  the said Earl's Brother and for my Lord  Herries  the said Lord's eldest Son"  According to Articles most of the Persons concerned met at  Edinburgh  on the th of  April  to treat at large of a thorow Agreement and especially of such Points as related to the banished Queen Being all in one Room the Regent first rose and drawing out a Paper asked the Duke if he would instantly subscribe an Acknowledgment of the young King's Authority or not to which he modestly replyed  That he and his Friends had laid down their Arms conditionally nor could he think himself or them obliged to subscribe their Allegiance to the King unless according to  these Conditions the Regent at the same time should grant what might be reasonably demanded in behalf of the distressed Queen and therefore hoped he would not proceed to Acts of Force and Fraud too since not only he and his Friends but their Hostages likewise were in his Hands desiring him to remember that they had religiously observed every Article of the late Treaty and had come secure and unarmed as to a Friend faithfully relying on his Honour and those assurances of Safety he had given them in the most solemn manner under his own Hand  To this easie Remonstrance of the Duk's  Murray  made no manner of return says my Author  Drumsoy's Memoirs  but against all the Laws of Honour sent him to the Castle of  Edinburgh  Melvil's Memoirs  where he was kept close Prisoner till the Regent was murdered by  James Hamilton  of  Bothwellhaugh  on the of  January  then he had his Liberation after having purged himself by Oath from all manner of Suspicion in that Affair  What a loyal and honest Part my Lord Duke of  Chattlerault  acted for the Interest of his Sovereign Queen  Mary  in the time of her greatest Distress is so well known was so frequently own'd acknowledg'd by her Majesty that I don't think it necessary to be further insisted on here  Queen Mary always called the Duke of Chattlerault  Father  and that his Loyalty was not easie to him is evident from the manifold Sufferings and Hardships he underwent during the continuance of the Civil War for as soon as the Earl of  Lennox  was elected Regent he burnt down the Castle Town of  Hamiltoun  and that these honest Patriots might be heartily humbled not so much as the CornFields and Trees belonging to a  Hamiltoun  were spared the Duke himself with his two Sons and most of the Gentlemen of the Name of  Hamilton  were all forfaulted for their Rebellion against the young King notwithstanding he resolutely persisted in the Queen's Service and had a large share in the Misfortunes of that unfortunate Queen but being aged for the better Security of his Person from the violence of his Enemies he retired into  France  where he stayed some time during the Rage of the War which had reduced his Country to the last extremity and returning home he gave way to Fate on the of  January  As for his Character notwithstanding the Envy of some and the Malice of others it shone very bright in that great and difficult Trust of Governour of  Scotland  which he held in the most difficult Times so he discharged it for twelve Years with no less Prudence and Dexterity than Honour and Reputation a Praise which few of his Enemies ever denyed him in any time For in his Court says a reverend Historian  ArchBishop Spottiswood's History of the Church of Scotland    There was nothing to be seen the severest Eye could censure in the publick Administration such a Moderation was kept as no Man was heard to complain  And continues my Author  He was a Nobleman well inclined plain and without all Dissimulation and Fraud that by the goodness of God who always favoureth the Upright he was carryed thro many Difficulties and died in Peace and Honour well advanced in Age  This noble Duke married  Margaret  eldest Daughter of  James Douglas  Earl of  Morton  by whom he had Issue  James  Earl of  Arran  his eldest Son a Gentleman of the highest Expectations who gave early Proofs of inheriting all the Vertues of his Ancestors to an eminent Degree but he became Defective in his Understanding and thereupon retired from the World dying without Succession  Anno    Lord  John  thereafter Marquess of  Hamilton  Lord  Claud  Progenitor to the Earl of  Abercorn  Lord  David  who dyed a young Man  Lady  Margaret  married to  Alexander  Lord  Gordon  Son and Heir of  George  Earl of  Huntly sans  Issue and after his Death to  James  Lord  Fleming  Ancestor to the Earl of  Wigton  Lady  Anne  to  George  Earl of  Huntly  Lord High Chancellour of  Scotland  Progenitor to the present Duke of  Gordon  Lady  Jean  married to  Hugh    d  Earl of  Eglingtoun  but had no Succession  His Successor in the Honour was  James  Earl of  Arran  his eldest Son but he being  non compos mentis John  his next Brother represented the Family This noble Lord was born in the and had by the bounty of King  James  V the Commendatory of  Arbroath  Abbey one of the richest Benefices in  Scotland  bestowed on him  Anno    Charta in Bibliotheca Juridica MS a Gulielmo Wilson Clerico Sessionis deputato Facultati Juridicae donata codemque in Regni hujus Antiquitatibus haud parum versato  by which Title he was designed for some time after We hear not much of his Conduct till the breaking out of the Civil War in Queen  Mary  's Time  Anno  that he most faithfully adher'd to her Majesty's Interest and upon her Imprisonment in the Castle of  Lochlevin  his Lordship with several others entered into an Association wherein they promise  "To use their utmost Endeavours by all reasonable Means to procure her Majesty's Freedom and Liberty upon such honest Conditions as may stand with her Majesty's Honour the Commonweal of the whole Realm and Security of the whole Nobility who at present have her Majesty in keeping Whereby this our Native Rea  m may be govern'd rul'd and guided by her Majesty and her Nobility for the common Quietness the Administration o  Justice and Weal o  the Country And in case the Noblemen who have at present her Majesty in their Hands refuse to set her at Liberty upon such reasonable Conditions as said is in that Case We shall employ our Selves our Kindred Friends Servants and Partakers our Bodies and Lives to set her Highness at Liberty as said is and also to concur to the Punishment of the Murther of the King her Majesty's Husband and for sure Preservation of the Person of the Prince as We shall Answer to God and on our own Honours and Credit and to that effect shall concur every one with other at our utmost Power And if any shall set upon Us or any of Us for the doing as aforesaid in that Case We promise faithfully to espouse one another's Interest under pain of Perjury and Infamy as We shall answer to God"  My Lord  Hamilton  's most Loyal and firm Adherence to the Crown was very dear to him for the contrary Faction who were Masters of the young King prosecuted him and his Family with the utmost Severity for no other Reason but because they owned Queen  Mary's  Authority and therefore in one of their Parliaments held in  October  both he and his Brother Lord  Claud  were forfaulted My Lord  John  to avoid the Storm that threatned him fled on Foot in a Seamans Habit into  England  and from thence made his Escape into  France  where he was kindly entertained by  James Beaton  Bishop of  Glasgow  then Ambassador at the  French  Court for Queen  Mary  here he had great Offers made him by the House of  Guise  if he would change his Religion and imbrace Popery but such was the goodness of God toward him that he persever'd in his Religion which tho' it lost him  the Favour of the  French  Court it preserv'd him the Peace of his Conscience which he ever afterward reckoned one of the most signal Favours of Heaven toward him Notwithstanding the hard Usage his Lordship met with he continued true and faithful to the Queen to the last of which her Majesty was so sensible that when that severe and unparalleled Sentence of Death was passed on her in  England  she took a Ring off her Finger and gave it to one of her Servants and order'd him to carry it to her Cousin Lord  John Hamilton and tell him that that was all she had to Witness her great Sense of his Families constant Fidelity to her and their Sufferings for her Interest and desired it might be still kept in the Family as a lasting Evidence of her Kindness to it  This Ring is still preserved with a due regard in the Family to this Day and I have seen it in my Lady Dutchess of Hamilton's Custody    This noble Lord in the Course of his Exile sojourned in diverse foreign Parts till some time after King  James  IV came to manage by his own Councils that he returned to  Scotland  and on the first of  November  together with several other Lords and Barons petitioned the King to redress certain Grievances of the Nation  Sir James Melvil's Memoirs  representing to him in a humble manner  That the hard handling by partial Persons about his Majesty had compelled them upon plain Necessity and for their last Refuge to take the boldness to come into his Presence in Arms for the Surety of their Lives and Lands  Adding  That they were ever humbly minded to serve his Majesty and obey him hereafter as became dutiful and loyal Subjects  To which the King replyed  That tho' their Enterprise was Treasonable yet in Respect of their Necessity and in hope of their good Behaviour in time coming he would remit the Crime  And further directing himself to my Lord  Hamilton  He said  My Lord I did never see you before and must confess that of all this Company you have been the most wronged you were a faithful Servant to the Queen my Mother in my Minority and when I understood not as I do now the State of Things hardly used  Hereupon a Parliament was called wherein the Act of Forfaulture of the  Hamilton  's was repealed and the Family again restored to all the Titles of Honour Estate and Precedency lost either by the Attainder of himself or of  James  Earl of  Arran  his Brother and the same Year his Lordship was sworn of the Privy Council and constituted Captain of his Majesty's Castle of  Dumbartoun  The King placing great Confidence in the Fidelity of this Lord was pleased in the  Writes of the Privy Seal in the publick Records  to give him a Commission under his Privy Seal to be Ambassador Extraordinary to accomplish the Marriage betwixt his Majesty and the Princess  Anne  of  Denmark  and this with full Consent of his Privy Council but his Lordship declining that Honour by reason of his Age and the King himself going in Person to  Denmark  his Majesty named my Lord  Hamilton  Lieutenant of the South of  Scotland  which great Trust he discharged fully to his Majesty's Satisfaction and the Expectations he had conceived of him The Royal Favour toward his Lordship did not stop here but the King in Memory of his long and faithful Services was pleased to raise him to the Degree and Dignity of Marquess of  Hamilton  with great Ceremony on the of  April    Sir George Mackenzies Herauldry  continuing ever afterward without any the least Interruption in great Esteem with that Prince who gave him frequent Visits at his Palace of  Hamilton  and treated him with the same Respect the Queen his Mother had done the Duke of  Chattlerault  and called him always  Father  To conclude this  noble Person died in the highest Favour with Prince and People the th of  April    Chart  in Cancellaria S D N R  and was interr'd among his Ancestors in the Collegiate Church of

Lord  Max well  Ancestor to the present Earl of  Nithsdale  John  Marquess of  Hamilton  was succeeded by  James  his Son who was born in the After his Accession to the Honour he was appointed one of the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council and afterward preferred to be one of the Gentlemen of the Bed Chamber and that he might the better support his Character his Majesty was pleased to dissolve from the Crown the Abbey Lands with the Patronages and Tithes of the Monastery of  Arbroath  in  Forfarshire  and to e  ect them into a temporal Lord ship in favour of my Lord Marquess and that especially in Consideration of his Fathers Faithfulness and Sufferings for Queen  Mary  by his royal Charter bearing Date the th of  May    Charta in Rotulis Jacobi VI ad annum    Besides this vast Augmentation of his Fortune in Lands he likewise bore several great Offices in that Princes Reign as Lord High Steward of his Majesty's Houshold and Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament which began on the of  July    Mr Calderwood's History of the Church of Scotland  wherein the five Articles of  Perth  Assembly were ratified and after having surmounted all the Difficulties that occurred in that Ticklish Juncture he put a period to that Session on the th Day of  August  ensuing His Lordship highly meriting for his Services to the Crown his Majesty was pleased in Recompence thereof on the of  June  to creat him a Peer of  England  by the Honour of Earl of  Cambridge  a Title that had only been born by very illustrious Persons all of the Royal Family of  England  And as a further Instance of his Royal Favour to admit his Lordship into the most noble Order of the  Garter  and accordingly he was installed at  Windsor  th of  July  from henceforth living in the highest Favour with his Prince whose Affection and Esteem he had a greater Power over than any Man of that time says one the Duke of  Buckinghame  only excepted He departed this Life at  London  in the prime of his Age  d  of  March  aged Years to the great Grief of the King who prophetically apprehended that as the Branches were now cut down the Root would quickly follow for the Duke of  Lennox  died the of  February  preceeding and his Majesty's Death happened on the th of  March  ensuing  He married  Anne  Daughter of  James  Earl of  Glencairn  by whom he had Issue three Sons and three Daughters  James  Duke of  Hamilton  William  Duke of  Hamiltoun  Lord  John Hamilton  died young  Lady  Anne  married to  Hugh  Earl of  Eglingtoun  and had Issue  Lady  Margaret  to  John  Earl of  Crawfurd  and had Issue  Lady  Mary  to  James  Earl of  Queensberry  but had no Issue  James  Marquess of  Hamilton  his Son was born on the th of  June  he had his Education in  Scotland  till the th Year of his Age He was sent for to Court and married to the Lady  Mary Feilding  Daughter of  William  Earl of  Denbigh  by  Susanna  Sister to  George  Duke of  Buckinghame  After which he went to the University of  Oxford  where he continued during the Time it was judged necessary his Lordship should follow his Studies there  The next Qualification for a young Nobleman was to accomplish himself with travelling into Foreign Countries which he did into  France Spain  and several other Parts beyond Sea Dr  James Baillie  of  Carnbrew  accompanying him as his Governour who faithfully discharged the Trust reposed in him  Upon King  Charles  's coming to the Crown he was sworn of his Majesty's most honourable Privy Council in both Kingdoms and that he might have a nearer Relation to the Court was constituted Gentleman of the BedChamber and on the th of  June  preferred to be Master of the Horse then void by the Death of the Duke of  Buckingham  Dr Burnet's Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton  Neither are we to forget that his Majesty was pleased to honour his Lordship with the Dignity of the most noble Order of the  Garter Anno  at the Baptism of K  Charles  II where my Lord Marquess had the Honour to Represent the King of  Bohemia  as one of the Godfathers at the Font  In the his Majesty taking into his Consideration the State of the King of  Bohemia  his BrotherinLaw was pleased from the entire Confidence he had in the Marquess to allow him to Treat with  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  for raising an Army of Six Thousand Men to join that Monarch in his Expedition into  Germany  to be imployed against the  Imperialists  for the Recovery of the  Palatinate  Dr Burnet makes out this fully  And 'tis more re+markable that this Lord should be intrusted with so great a Command because he was but then Twenty three Years of Age but that Enterprise ending without so much Advantage as was expected from such an Army to the Protestant Cause neither his Absence nor want of thorough Success in his Negotiation diminished in the least his Masters Esteem of him for upon his return to Court he was received with all the Respect that could be given a Subject  Upon the first Insurrection in  Scotland Anno  occasioned by the pressing of the  Liturgy  he was sent down as his Majesty's High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church with Instructions to compose and appease the Disorders of the Nation then in a great Ferment but in that Judicature my Lord Marquess not being able to carry what the King designed he according to Order dissolved the Meeting and Inhibited them to sit any longer under pain of Rebellion which was all his Lordship could do Next Year he was intrusted with the Command of the Fleet sent down to reduce the Covenanters to their Duty to the King his Majesty himself being on the Head of Six Thousand LandForces advanced as far as  Berwick  but by the Marquess's Mediation and good Offices with the King a Treaty was set on Foot and a Pacification ensued  On the breaking out of the Civil War in  England Anno  he was one of the Peers who sign'd a solemn Declaration  That his Majesty abhor'd all Designs of making War upon his Parliament and that all his Endeavours tended to the firm and constant Settlement of the true Protestant Religion the Privileges of Parliament and the Laws the Peace and Prosperity of the Subject  The Earl of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion  and at the same time he offered to the King to go into  Scotland  undertaking that he would at least keep that People from doing any Thing that might seem to countenance the Carriage of the  English  Parliament but to be only Spectators of what was done in  England  without engaging themselves in the Quarrel and would endeavour if possible to oppose the Calling of a Parliament in  Scotland  which the King had absolutely refused to do till the time  came agreed on at his Majesty's last being there  The Earl of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion Civil War  but as soon as he came down to  Scotland  he quickly discerning the strength of the Covenanters gave way to it that there should be a Meeting of the Estates rea+sonably enough concluding that the absolutely refusing to suffer a Parliament to be called would not quiet the Debates nor secure the King but more inflame those who desir'd it and who would take some other time when many of them who opposed it should be absent to propose it and so would carry it and that therefore they were better be absent at first whereby the other Party might without Opposition send out their Summons fo  a Parliament to assemble at the Day they should think fit and that as they who would serve the King would not be there so they should prevail with as many others as they could not to be there like wise where by the Number which appeared would be so inconsiderable that they would not dare to sit and perfectly disperse and this Disappointment would for ever quash that Design and render those who advised it odious to the People as Men who desir'd illegally to engage the Nation in unjustifiable Ways to disturb the publick Peace but his Lordship changing his former Opinion concerning their being absent at the time of the Meeting or Parliament since their meer absence would not be discountenance enough and that they who sat as indeed many would have done would carry the Reputation of a Parliament and the People would be guided by them and therefore he proposed to the King's Friends that they would all resolve to be present and take their Places that when the House should be set and any Man should stand up to propose the taking any Business into Consideration he would first make his Protestation against proceeding in so unlawful a Convention and that they should all make the same Protestation and he did hope that the Number of the Protesters would be great enough to dissolve the Meeting and thus they should put the best End to the Matter that could be desir'd but if it should succeed otherways then would be the time to withdraw and put themselves in Arms towards which he would make the best Preparation he could and desired them to do the like and this last Overture the King himself liked best approv'd of that they should meet in the Convention which they did accordingly at the Day appointed Then his Lordship according to his Promise and Concert took an Opportunity to make a Protestation against the Legality of the Meeting upon which many of the Members who had been always most engaged against the King were very warm and demanded that he should declare himself clearly whether he did protest against the Parliament but his Lordship fearing as he declared the fatal Issue of adhereing to his Protestation to the King's Service he excused himself after the best manner he could tho' no Man had a greater dislike of the high Proceedings of that Meeting in exceeding the Limits of their Duty to the King or had a greater Affection for his Majesty's Service than my Lord Marquess had for he oppos'd all their Determinations with all the vigor he thought seasonable concurring only so far with them as was necessary to keep up his Credit whereby he might with the more Authority advance the King's Cause and a Peace which he and all good Men so passionately desired His Majesty that he might testify the Esteem he had of my Lord Marquess's Services and of his Fidelity to his Interest was graciously pleased to promote him to be Duke of  Hamilton  on the th of  April    Diploma Jacobi Ducis de Hamilton in Rotulis Car I  How this  Convention in  Scotland  was consen'd and overreached by Sir  Henry Vane  every one knows for he perswaded them that there was nothing intended against the King by the  English  Nation but only that they should interpose for a good Peace to them which would be an Honour to them and a great Obligation to his Majesty  Earl of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion  As for the History of this Convention and its subsequent Acts and the fatal Effects as well as Infamy of the  Scots  joining with the  English  Parliament against the King as the consequent of the  Solemn League  and  Covenant  are all particulars so well known and have been so much enlarg'd on in several Treatises particularly wrote to that purpose that the further mentioning of them in this place will be but needless seeing the noble Person whose Memoirs I write was free from any Accession or Guilt therein  As soon as the Convention was over the Duke and his Brother the Earl of  Lanerk  left  Scotland  to give the King then at  Oxford  an Account of all their proceedings but notwithstanding of his Grace's good Intention toward the King his Enemies for not a few he had used all the Artifi  es they could to render him suspected to his Majesty as if he secretly countenanc'd at least did not sufficiently abhor the unnatural Rebellion of his Countrymen and this Imputation was with so great Art insinuated that it got so much Credit with those about the Court that the King upon my Lord Duke and his Brothers arrival commanded them to keep their Chambers and ordered a Guard to attend them  Ibidem  so after some time his Grace was sent in Custody to the Castle of  Bristol  and from thence to  Exeter  and so to the Castle of  Pendinnis  whence he was removed to St  Michael  's  Mount  in  Cornwall  upon the surrender of which to the Parliaments Forces  Anno  he obtain'd his Liberty which he imployed with much Zeal in the King's Service to the loss of his Life by which he was not only vindicated in the Opinion of all Men from all those Jealousies and Aspersions he had lyen long under but the proceedings that had been against him at  Oxford  were looked upon by many as void of that Justice and Policy which had been requisite and they concluded by what he did after a long Imprisonment how much he might have done more successfully if he had never been restrain'd  Ibidem    As soon as my Lord Duke was at Liberty it was believ'd that the Animosity was so great between him and some others of great Name that he would rather meditate a Revenge than concur in any Action which might advance the King's Interest but his Grace well consider'd both his Duty to his Majesty and his own Danger at such a Juncture to think of private Contention and matters of Revenge when the publick was so much at Stake so that his former Treatment made no other Impression upon him then to make him show his steadiness more and more to his Majesty's Service who then so much stood in need of the Assistance of his faithful Subjects  When the King put himself into the  Scots  Army before  Newark  in the my Lord Duke having obtain'd his Liberty came to wait on his Majesty  Bishop Burnet's Memoir's of James Du  e of Hamilton  and was well received by him After they had conversed some time together his Majesty was pleased to express the sense he had of his long Sufferings and told him in these Words  That he had ever judged him Innocent as to the bulk of things tho he confess'd there were some particulars he was not so well  satisfied with but that his Restraint was extorted from him against his Heart for he had stood out against all the Importunities of his Enemies till the very Morning he came to  Oxford  His Lordship's next Care was to bring his Majesty and the Committee of Estates to a happy Peace and Accommodation  Dr Burnet's Memoirs  and as he earnestly endeavour'd to have them satisfied with the Kings Concessions so he dealt fervently with his Majesty to yield to the abolishing of Episcopacy in  England  as he had in  Scotland  as the only way to induce the Presbyterian Party to declare for him but the good King could not be be prevailed on to consent to buy his Peace as he said  at so dear a Rate as the peace of his Conscience  so the Treaty at that time had not its desir'd effect  When it came to be considered in Parliament what way his Majesty's Person should be disposed of still in the  Scots  Army my Lord Duke finding that the House by a Majority were inclin'd to deliver him up to the  English  Parliament his Grace took an Opportunity that he might declare to the World his abhorrence of an Action attended with so much Infamy and spoke against it to this purpose  Would  Scotland  now quit a Possession of    Years Date which was their Interest in their Sovereign and do it to those whose Enmity both against Him and them did visibly appear Was this the effect of all their Protestations of Duty and Affection to his Majesty Was this their keeping of their Covenant wherein they had sworn to defend the King's Majesty's Person and Authority Was this a suitable return to the King's Goodness both in his consenting to all the Desires of that Kingdom  An  and in His late trusting His Person to them What Censures will be past upon this through the whole World What a stain would it be to the whole Reformed Rel  gion and in fine what Danger might be apprehended both to the King's Person and to  Scotland  from the Party that was now prevalent in  England  But notwithstanding all the Opposition the Duke and his Friends could make against it yet the same was carryed upon the th of  January    That the King should be delivered up into such Hands as the  English  Parliament had appointed to receive him  Ibidem  to the great Grief of the Duke and all true hearted  Scots  Men and that his Grace might again in any Degree retrive the Dishonour the Nation suffered in the giving up that excellent Prince he endeavour'd all he could to infuse a sense of Shame and Horror in all People for the late Action which might prepare them to a Reparation of it by a generous engaging in the King's Quarrel and in doing so most of the Year was spent even till the meeting of the next Parliament which sat down the  d  of  March    Bishop Guthrie's Memoirs  at the opening of which my Lord Duke did all he could to inflame the People with Zeal for his Majesty's Relief against the Army of  England  who he said  "had forced the Parliament there to break the Treaty between the two Kingdoms in their ill usage of the King who was Imprison'd by the Army nor was it in the power of the Parliament to set him at Liberty That they had now upon the matter absolutely deposed him by not suffering him to perform the Office of a King not permitting any of his Subjects to repair to him in which the Kingdom of  Scotland  was concern'd in that being independent upon  England  and the Paliament of  England  they were  by them depriv'd of their King and could not be admitted to speak with him nor his Majesty to send to them which was such a Presumption and violation of the Law of Nations and such a perfidious breach and contempt of the  Solemn League  and  Covenant  and of the Treaty between the two Kingdoms that they were bound by all the Obligations Human and Divine to be sensible of it and to redeem their King's Liberty and their own Honour with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes and all that was dear to them and therefore he desired that they might enter upon those Counsels which might soonest get an Army together which should no sooner enter  England  but it would find a conjunction from that whole Kingdom except only the Army and that it would then quickly appear that the Parliament of both Kingdoms desired the same thing and to live happily under the Government of the same King"  This Discourse urg'd by the Duke seconded by many of the principal Members was entertain'd with so general a Reception that it was agreed to  hat an Army should be raised for the Relief of his Majesty whereof his Grace was appointed General which being Levied with all the Diligence imaginable entered  England  about the th of  July  consisting of twelve thousand Foot and five thousand Horse and next day had the Town of  Carlyle  delivered to them from Sir  Philip Musgrave  The Life of James Duke of Hamilton  and after some Days stay there he march'd to  Kendal  and thence to  Prestoun  in  Lancashire  where he was so closly pursued by  Cromwell  's Horse under  Lambert  that on the th of  August  his whole Army was routed and his Grace put to the necessity of rendering himself Pri  oner upon Articles of Capitulation at  Exeter  in  Staffordshire  to the Lord  Gray  of  Groby  The Capitulation is set down a  length in Dr Burnet's Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton Peerage of England  from whence he was carried to  Ashby  where he continued till the beginning of  December  he was sent Prisoner to  Windsor  where he had the Society of the Earls of  Norwich  and  Holland  the Lord  Capell  common Sufferers in the same Cause with himself where they were all kept in close restraint till the murder of the King The Duke then perceiving his own Danger attempted to make an escape  c  in which he had so well succeeded that he was out of his Enemies hands full three Days but being impatient to be at a greater distance from them he was apprehended as he was taking Horse in  Southwark  and carried Prisoner to the Tower from whence he was on the th of  February  brought before that monstrous High Court of Justice whose Hands were still reeking in the Blood of their Sovereign Mr  Steel  and Mr  Cook  Council for the Parliament  Life of James Duke of Hamilton  exhibited a Charge of high Treason against him  That he the Earl of  Cambridge  had traiterously invaded the Nation in a hostile manner and levied War to assist the King against the Kingdom and People of  England  c  In his Defence he us'd all the lawful means in the World and insisted  upon the Right and Priviledge of the Kingdom of  Scotland  that it had not the least Dependence upon the Kingdom of  England  but was intirely govern'd by its own Laws that he being a Subject of that Kingdom was bound to obey the Commands thereof and the Parliament of that Kingdom having thought it necessary to raise an Army for the relief of their King and constituted him General of that Army it was not lawful for him to refuse the Command thereof and whatever Misfortune he had undergone with it he could not be understood to be liable to any Punishment but what a Prisoner  of War was bound to undergo  He was told  That the Rights and Laws of the Kingdom of  Scotland  were not call'd in question nor could be violated by their proceedings against him who was a Subject of  England  against which he was charg'd with Rebellion and Treason that they did not proceed against him as Duke  Hamilton  of  Scotland  but as Earl of  Cambridge  of  England  and they would judge him as such  His Council Mr  Hales  Mr  Chute  and Mr  Parsons  defended him with great Learning and Judgement as may be seen in Bishop  Burnet  's Memoirs of his Life at large but all Arguments in his favour signified nothing he was born down with the Torrent of the Times and together with the Earls of  Holland  and  Norwich  the Lord  Capel  and Sir  John Oven  had Sentence of Death pronounced against them to  los  their Heads  To conclude the Fate of this great Person he was on the th Day of  March  brought to  Westminster  the Place appointed for his Execution and ascending the Scaffold with a composed and undaunted Courage  He spoke of his Devotion to the Church of  Scotland  and the Protestant Religion established by Law and profest in that Church of his Loyalty to the King whose Restauration and Prosperity he heartily prayed for and Affection to the Welfare Happiness of the Kingdom as Matters unquestionable  After which with a marvellous Tranquillity of Mind he delivered his Head to the Block which sever'd it from his Body at one Blow which together with the Body was convoyed by Sea into  Scotland  and buried in the Church of  Hamilton  according to his own Order  His Grace by  Mary  his Wife aforesaid Daughter of  William  Earl of  Denbigh  besides three Sons and a Daughter who died in their Childhood he had two Daughters who surviv'd him Lady  Anne  Dutchess of  Hamilton  and Lady  Susanna  married to  John  Earl of  Cassils  James  Duke of  Hamilton  being thus impiously cut off leaving no Sons behind him his Estate and Honour did descend to  William  Earl of  Lanerk  his Brother he was born th  December    Life of William Duke of Hamilton  being deprived of his Father in the th Year of his Age his Mother a Lady among the most Eminent in all Vertues redoubled her Care of his Education in the Schools and University at home and then his Brother the Duke sent him abroad  Bishop Burnet's Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton  to qualify him by Travel and otherways for the service of his Country continuing beyond Sea till his twenty first Year  Ibidem  Anno  His Majesty King  Charles  I conceiving an extraordinary good Opinion of him was graciously pleased as a distinguishing mark of his Favour by Letters Patent bearing Date the of  March  to honour him with the Titles of Earl of  La  erk  Lord  Machanshire  and  Polmont  Diploma Gulielmi Comitis de Lanerk in Rotulis Car I ad annum  and  William  Earl of  Stirling  Secretary for  Scotland  giving way to  ate in the beginning of the Year  Lives of the Officers of State MS penes me  the King discerning my Lord  Lanerk  adorn'd with all the Qualifications he judg'd necessary for the discharge of that Imployment was pleased to promote him thereto an Office his Lordship discharg'd with eminent Sufficiency and the general applause of all Men for some Years after tho' it's remarkable he was but aged twenty four Years at his Promotion  The cruel and bloody Civil War hast'ning on my Lord  Lanerk  used his utmost Endeavours to allay the unhappy Differences which had arisen between his Majesty and his Subjects of both Kingdoms and bent all his Thoughts to mediate a Peace to the Honour and Safety of the King and the Wel  are and Happiness of the  Kingdom In the Convention of Estates which met on the of  June    The Bishop of Duakeid's Memoir of the Civil War  his Lordship acted with his usual Zeal for the publick good but discerning that the Royal Party in that Assembly had not Authority or Power enough to cross any thing that was done to the prejudice of the King  Earl of Clarendon's History and Bishop Burnet's Memoirs compar'd  and that a direct Protestation against the Convention in that conjuncture of time was to destroy themselves to no purpose his Lordship and other loyal Peers did give in a Declaration and took Instruments both in the King's Name and their own  Burnet's Memoirs  which was all that could be pradently done in that Season soon after which my Lord  Lanerk  for Reasons and from Motives that History is altogether silent in which is not clear enough to this time he put the King's Signet with which he was intrusted as Secretary to the Proclamation for the general Rendevouz of all Men in the Kingdom from such an Age to such an Age whereby the Army was presently formed which afterward join'd with the Parliament of  England  against the King the fatal Consequences of which are so well known that they need not be told  Clarendon's History  This Action was not thought capable of any Excuse was afterward very much represented to his Disadvantage and was the first Cause of the King's Jealousie both of the Duke his Brother and his Lordship and thereby their Sincerity and Affection to his Majesty's Service came to be very much call'd in question but the Earl of  Lanerk  presuming he had enough to excuse himself of any Disloyalty as soon as the Convention was over went with his Brother the Duke to wait on the King at  Oxford  Guthrie's Memoirs  being confident that when he should be admitted to speak with his Majesty he would give him satisfaction in that Affair  Clarendon's History  Upon their arrival there both the Brothers were put under a Confinement but the  Earl perceiving  Burnet's Memoirs  that they were not like to obtain a Trial for clearing their Innocence and discovering the Forgeries of their Accusers and his Lordship fearing a long and cruel Imprisonment he made his escape by means of Sir  James Cuningham and presently repair'd to  London  After some stay there returning to  Scotland  he easily found means to make his Peace with the Estates by taking of the Covenant  Guthrie's Memoirs  whereby he came to have a great Influence on their Counsels and did not a little contribute to moderate the fury of the leading Men of that side to hearken to Propositions for Peace and Accomodation with the King  After this we hear not much of the Conduct of the Earl till the when the King came to the  Scots  Army at  Newark  he was with other two Lords sent Commissioner from the Committee of Estates  with an humble Offer of their Duty to his Majesty and of their sincere Intentions to serve him and withal to give him assurance that the Preservation of his sacred Person and his just Power and Greatness was and should ever be dear to them  Here my Lord  Lanerk  us'd all the Perswasions and all the Importunities he could with his Majesty to give Satisfaction to the Desires of his Subjects and as a Preparation to this that he would send his positive Orders to the Marquess of  Montrose  to lay down his Arms extirpate Prelacy out of  England  as he had done in  Scotland  and to agree to such Propositions as should be brought from the two Houses in  England  The first Proposal he graciously condescended to To the next he returned this Answer  That when he was satisfied in his Conscience of the lawfulness of what they desired then and never till then would he grant their Demands  As for the Message from the  English  Parliament it was so high that his Majesty could not gra  t    or my Lord  Clarendon  says  It contain'd such  an Eradication of the Government of the Church and State that the King told them he knew not what Answer to make to them till he should be informed what Power or Authority they had left him and his Heirs when he had given all to them which they desired  On that ominous Day th of  January  when the great Transaction came to be debated in Parliament about the disposing of his Majesty's Person who was in the Hands of the Army  Whether they should leave him in  England  to the two Houses yea or not  Thus was the Question stated against giving up of the King my Lord  Lanerk  argued strenously and spoke against it  as the most barefac'd Violation of their Faith and Allegiance to deliver up their Native Prince who had put himself into their Hands against his Will and Consent into the Custody of such as would put his Sacred Person in eminent hazard  but to the eternal Infamy of the Majority of that Convention it was carried  To deliver up the King  whereat his Lordship was so perfectly overwhelm'd with the horror of so sinful and shameful a Deed that he expressed his Dissent from it in so passionate a manner that it would be to do him wrong to omit to give it in his own Words  As God shall have mercy on my Soul  said he  at the great Day I would rather choose to have my Head struck off at the Cross of  Edinburgh  than give my Consent to this Vote  and then adds  That this was the blackest Day that ever  Scotland  saw  Bishop Burnet's Memoirs I wish latest Posterity may not for ever have cause to remark with equal Sorrow and Regret the same ominous Day threescore Years  viz  sixteenth of January one thousand seven hundred and seven on which the late Treaty of Union betwixt the two Nations was ratified and approven b  Act of Parliament whereby alas Scotland is now no more well may ScotsMen who think on the Transactions of that Day say with the Poet  Quis talia fand  temperes a lachrimis    As the Earl of  Lanerk  had from the very beginning of the War been always disposed to Peace so shortly after this by his Dexterity and Influence a Treaty was set on foot betwixt the King and the Parliament of  Scotland  his Lordship with the Earls of  Lauderdale  and  Loudon  being appointed Commissioners for that end in pursuance of which laudable design they repair'd to his Majesty as soon as he was at the Isle of  Wight  and undertook to invade  England  with an Army to restore him to his just Rights and in order to this they proposed to him many Conditions which would be necessary for his Majesty to perform toward the Nation without whichit  ould not be easie to induce them to be so unanimous in an Engagement for him as was necessary for such an Enterprise They requir'd that the Prince of  Wales  should be present with them and march in the Head of their Army That such a number of  Scots  Men should be always in the Court of the Bedchamber and all other Places about the Persons of the King Prince and Duke of  York  That  Berwick  and  Carlyle  should be put into their Hands They demanded moreover that as soon as his Majesty could with Freedom Honour and Safety be present in a free Parliament to confirm the  So+lemn League  and  Covenant  by Act of Parliament  Clarendon's History  providing that none who was unwilling should be constrain'd to take it They likewise oblig'd his Majesty to confirm Presbyterian Government in  England  for three Years and after the Expiration of that time such a Government shall be determined by his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament as was most agreeable to the Word of God That an effectual course shall be taken for the suppressing of all Heresies and all Principles and Practices contrary to the Principles of Christianity This Agreement  his Majesty was pleased to sign the of  December    The Earl of Clarendon in his History has the Substance of the Treaty  and to oblige himself  in the Word of a King to perform his part of the Treaty  as the Commissioners also engaged themselves  upon their Honour Faith and Conscience and all that is dear to honest Men to endeavour to the utmost of their Power that the Kingdom of  Scotland  should engage to perform what was on its part to be performed  Any Body who reads this Treaty in which his Majesty's Concessions are so full could scarcely have thought that any Party would not have been perfectly pleased with it and so all would indifferently concur in that dutiful loyal and generous Design of relieving the King then made a close Prisoner by  Oliver Cromwell  and the Officers of the Army but the rigid Clergy and the Lords of that Side not only declared against the Engagement as unlawful and sinful  Bishop Guthrie's Memoirs  and all the Persons who advanc'd and promoted it as Deserters of the Covenant but also raised what Force they could in the  Western  Counties to oppose it which at last came to be formed into a kind of an Army under the Command of the Earls of  Eglintoun Lowdoun  and some of the leading Clergy  Ibidem  whom for Respect to their Character as Church men I won't name Against this illegal Insurrection the Committee of Estates ordered some Troops to be levied which the Earl of  Lanerk  was chosen to command but his Lordship was  o sincerely throughly devouted to preserve the Peace of his Country and to accommodate Matters calmly and without Blood that he brought the Matter to an Agreement very much against his Mind and to his Prejudice yet so violent and Perfidious beyond what can be imagin'd were these Times that tho' my Lord  Lanerk  comply'd with them in their own Terms in whatever they demanded yet knowing his Lordship to be a throughpaced Loyalist and that his Principles were quite opposite to their Designs they resolved to be rid of him at any rate and therefore without the least Pretence of any Breach of any Article of their Treaty they put him under a Restraint resolving to send him to their Brethren in  England  who had by this time barbarously murder'd the King to be punish'd as an Incendiary that is to have his Head cut off wherefore he thought it his most adviseable course to get out of the sight of the Calamity of his Country and to retire beyond Sea which he did into  Holland  with an offer of his Service to King  Charles  II  And brought with him  says the Lord  Clarendon A Heart and Affection clearer and less clogg'd with Scruples and Reservations for the King's Service than any other of the Nation had  When his Lordship arrived at the  Hague  he first came to know that he was Duke of  Hamilton  by the Slaughter of his Brother this sad News afflicted him so much that he kept his Chamber for some Days without so much as waiting on the King who sent a gracious Message to him to condole for the loss of his Brother And all the Lords and other persons of Qualility about the King made their Visits of Condolence to him with all Civility His Grace stayed in the  Netherlands  till the King and the Commissioners from  Scotland  had agreed to the Terms on which they would make him their King My Lord Duke being very instrumental to prevailupon his Majesty to submit to the most rigid Terms the Kirk requir'd of him At the same time in the end of the his Majesty was pleased to acknowledge and recompense the Dukes Loyalty and Merit by bestowing the  Garter  on him as a distinguishing mark of his Royal Favour He accompanyed his Majesty to  Scotland Anno  but his Enemies would not permit him to come to Court so having given his Majesty the best Advice he could with his leave he retir'd to the Isle of  Arran  where he stayed till the Parliament met at  Stirling  in then his Grace was suffered to come to Court being welcomed by the King and nearest in his Confidence So soon as the Army was rais'd for restoring the King my Lord Duke rais'd a Troop of Horse for his Majesty's Service on his own Charge with which he march'd to the fatal Battle of  Worcester  d of  September  charging the Enemy very vigorously he received a Shot in his Leg whereby he fell into the Enemies hands and on the of  September  died of his Wounds and thereby prevented the being made a Spectacle as his Brother had been which the Pride and Animosity of his Enemies would no doubt have caus'd to be having the same Pretence for it by his being a Peer of  England  as the other was The Earl of  Clarendon  having furnish'd me a Character of this noble Duke in his History of the Civil War I shall presume to insert it in his Words  He was  says that noble Lord  A Man not inferior in Wisdom and Parts of Understanding to the wisest Men of the Nation of great Honour Courage and Sincerity in his Nature and which was a rare Virtue in the Men of that time was still the same Men he pretended to be and in truth was in all Respects a very accomplish'd Person of an excellent Judgement and clear and ready Expression and tho' he had been driven into several unwarrantable Actions he made it very evident he had not been led by any Inclination of his own and passionately and heartily run to all Opportunities of redeeming it and in the very Article of his Death he express'd a marvellous Cheerfulness that he had the Honour to lose his Life in the King's Service and thereby to wipe out the Memory of his former Transgressions which he always professed were odi  us to himself  He married in the  Elisabeth  Daughter and Coheir of  James Maxwell  Earl of  Dirletoun  by whom he had a Son

Honour of the Family did devolve on his Niece the Lady  Anne  eldest Daughter of  James  Duke of  Hamilton  a Lady who for constancy of Mind evenness of Temper solidity of Judgment and an unaffected Piety will leave a shining Character as well as Example to Posterity for her Conduct as a Wife a Mother a Mistress and in all other Conditions of Life Her Grace married  William Douglass  Earl of  Selkirk  eldest Son of  William  the first Marquess of  Douglass  by  Mary  his second Wife Daughter of  George  Marquess of  Huntly  who by the Marriage Articles yielded to change both his Sirname and the Sirname of all his Children to  Hamilton  whereupon he was by King  Charles  II raised to the Dignity of Duke of  Hamilton  for his own Lifetime  Charta in Rotulis Car II ad annum  by Letters Patent on the th of  September  but such was the Humour of the Times the prevalency of Parties that save that his Grace was in the Council he had no Employment in the State during all King  Charles  's Reign tho' he had a large share of his Majesty's Esteem which he testified when he chose him into the Society of the most noble Order of the  Garter  Miscellany Collections  Anno    When King  James  VII came to the Throne in the beginning of the he found more Favour with the Court than he had done in the former Reign for he was not only a Lord of Council but also of the Treasaury and Session an extraordinary Lord Also on the th of  October  he was sworn a Privy Councellour for  England  History of England Vol III  in all which Offices he continued till his Majesty retir'd into

him the Administration of all Affairs Civil and Military the disposal of the publick Revenue and Fortresses of the Kingdom that he would do every thing that was necessary for the Preservation of the Peace of the Kingdom until a Meeting of the Estates of the Nation which they desir'd his Highness to Call to be holden at  Edinburgh  the th of  March    The Convention upon the Prince of  Orange  's Letters meeting at the Day appointed began with the choice of a President which fell on his Grace the Duke of  Hamilton  by a Majority of ten Voices more than the Marquess of  Athole  Memoirs  f the Convention of Estates MS  a  ter which they passed an Act asserting and maintaining the lawfulness of the Meeting and declaring that they would not dissolve but continue sitting until the Government

to take Arms upon Advertisement from the meeting of Estates for securing the Protestant Religion the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom  Acts and Orders of the Convention of Estates  At length on the th of  April  they proceeded and came to the following Resolution  viz That King  James VII  being a profest Papist did assume the regal Power and acted as King without ever taking the Oath required

what has already been said there remains nothing more to be observed  of him but that by her Grace  Anne  Dutchess of  Hamilton  he had a numerous Posterity of Sons and Daughters  viz  James  Duke of

which being qualified by Travels rendered him a most accomplished young Lord Upon his return home he was by the Favour of King  Charles  II on the th of  January  made one of the Gentlemen of his Majesty's Bedchamber  History of England Vol III  with ample Acknowledgements of the Loyalty of his illustrious Family whic  had not fuffered a little for the Crown his Lordship continuing in great

Revolution his Lordship firmly adhered to his unfortunate Master and never left him till he attended him to  Rochester  Sand  ord's Genealogical History of the Kings of England  where his Majesty embarked for  France  d  December  In the beginning of  January  when the Prince of  Orange  desired the advice of the  Scots  Nobility and Gentry then at  London  what was fit for him to do in reference to the Affairs of  Scotland  this occasioned a free Conference among them and my Lord  Arran  offered his Opinion in these Words  Miscellany Collections of the Year    I have all the Honour and Deference for the Prince of  Orange  imaginable I think him a brave Prince and that we owe him great Obligations in contributing so much for our Delivery from Popery but while I pay those Praises I cannot violate my Duty to my Master I must distinguish betwixt his Popery and his Person I dislike the one but have sworn and do owe Allegiance to the other which makes it impossible for me to sign away  that which I cannot forbear believing is the King my Masters Right for his present absence from us in  France  can no more affect my Duty than his longer absence from us has done all this while and the Prince desiring our Advice mine is that we should move his Majesty to return and call a free Parliament for the securing our Religion and Property which in my humble Opinion will at last be found the best way to heal all our Breaches  His Lordships Constancy to the Interest of King  James  even after the Prince of  Orange  was declared King of  England  occasioned such a Suspicion of his Conduct that he was sent Prisoner to the Tower  History of England Vol III  but being discharged some time after he retir  d for a time into  Scotland  his Father's Death happening in the brought no Accession either o  Honour or Estate to the Earl the same being hereditary to the Dutchess his Mother who nevertheless with the Consent of King  William  before the end of that Princes Reign resigned that Title to him  The Patent making the Earl of Arran Duke of Hamiltoun bears Date at Loe the th of August but it allows him the Precedency by his G  ndfather's Creation th of July  whereby he became a Peer  His Grace for many Years after was not engaged in any publick Affairs except Parliamentary ones as they occurred where he ever on all occasions show'd a tender Concern for the Honour and Prosperity of  Scotland  more particularly in the great Opposition he made in the Union of the two Kingdoms which as it did demonstrate his entire Affection to his Country so on that account it c  allenges a just Esteem and honourable Remembrance of his Memory as a noble Patriot by all the Lovers of their Country to perpetuity  The Matter of the Union being concluded in Parliament his Grace retir'd to his Country House in  Staffordshire  History of Europe for the  upon the News of the Invasion from  France Anno  he was by Order of the Council taken into the Custody of a Messenger upon Suspicion of his being privy to that Expedition but his Grace was admitted to Bail the Duke o  Newcastle  the Earl of  Whartoun  the Lord  Hailyfax  being Surities for him Whatever sinister Opinion some in  England  might entertain of the Duke at this Juncture it's certain the  Scots  Nobility had quite different Sentiments of him for on the th of  June  at a solemn Election of the Peers to testify the Honour and Esteem they had of him he was nominated and chosen one of the Sixteen Peers to the ensuing Parliament  When things came to take a new turn at Court upon her Majesty's change of her Ministry his Grace was on the st of  October  appointed Lord Lieutenant of the County  Palatine  of  Lancaster  History of Europe for the  in the room of  James  Earl of  Darby  and on the th of  December  thereafter he was sworn of the Privy Council  Ibidem  and accordingly took his place at the Board Also in the Month of  June  the Queen was pleased to make him a Peer of  Great Britain  by the Titles of Baron of  Dutton  and Duke of  Brandon  and the Preamble to his Patent runs thus  Cum generis claritate promeritorum praestantia constanti immaculata fidelitate vel ad mortem usque

English  Lords apprehending it might be dangerous to their Constitution to admit into their House a greater Number of the  Scots  Peers than were agreed to by the Act of Union and therefore resolved to oppose the said Claim Hereupon  Monday  the th a Motion was made for taking that Matter into Consideration which was done accordingly but after a few Speeches the Debate was adjourn'd to the th and after some time spent therein the further Consideration of that Business was put off till the th Upon which Day the Lords resum'd the Debate the Queen being present  incognito  after learned Council in the Law for her Majesty the House of Lords and the Duke of  Hamilton  several Speeches were made on both sides so that the Debate lasted till near Eighth in the Evening when the Question was put whether the Twelve Judges should be consulted with which being carried in the Negative by Fourteen Voices Proxies included Another Question was put Whether  Scots  Peers created Peers of  Great Britain  since the Union have a Right to sit in that House which was also carried in the Negative by five Voices Altho by this Decision the Royal Prerogative the Duke of  Hamilton  and the whole Peerage of  Scotland  receiv'd a great Mortification yet her Majesty was pleased to continue her Royal Favour to his Grace by making him Master General of the  Ordnance  and Knight of the most noble Order of the  Garter  at a Chapter held at  Windsor  th of  October  and shortly after appointed him to go Ambassador extraordinary to  France  upon the Conclusion of the Peace but while he was preparing his Equippage suitable to the Grandeur of his Character he had the Mis  ortune upon the th of  November  to fight a Duel in  HydePark  with the Lord  Mohun  where he kill'd that Lord upon the Spot and his Grace died of his Wounds by the time he got into his Lodgings  Nota  His Grace the Duke of Hamilton and the Lord Mohun had married two Ladies who were near Relations both Nieces to Charles late Earl of Maclesfield and having been at Law for some time about an Estate they met twice and the last time on the th of December at Mr Orlebars in Chancery at his Chamber in the Rolls where upon the Examination of Mr Whiteworth who had been Steward to the Lady Gerard and the Maclesfield Family the Duke happening to say  He had neither Truth nor Justice in him  Mohun in Answer reply'd  He had as much  ruth as his Grace  This was the unhapp  beginning of the Quarrel upon which a Challenge was carried by LieutenantGeneral Mack  rtney the Lord Mohun's Second who according to the positive Oath of Colonel Hamilton the Duke's Second and the general Clamour wounded the Duke in the Side after the Lord M  h  n  ell which I suppose was the immediate Cause of his Death notwithstanding the Rewards promised both by the Government and her Grace the Dutchess of Hamiltoun and the  trictest Search after him he made his escape and got off  his Death was universally lamented for the many noble Qualities he was endu'd with of which Love and Zeal for his Native Country was not the least and for that Reason his Loss can never be sufficiently be  ail'd by all true  Scots  Men and who ever  after him shall deserve best of the  Scots  Nation he can never think himself undervalu'd when he is laid in the Ballance with and compar'd to the Duke of  Hamilton  He

this Gentleman Sir  Patrick Maclellan  was so deeply resented by his Relations of the Sirname of  Mackclellan  that they committed great Depredations upon the  Douglas's  Lands within the bounds of

Daughter  Helen  married first to  Andrew  Earl of  Errol  and thereafter to  John  Earl of  Sutherland  Matthew  Earl of  Lennox  like other great Men of that Age betook himself to Arms and served the Crown of  France  in the Wars of  Italy  where his gallant Behaviour procured him a very great Name and Reputation He was always in very high Esteem with his own Prince King  James  V for his Father's Sake after whose Death he was sent over from  France  to prevent any Detriment to that Crown by the Minority of the young Queen but being a frank and openhearted Person he fell into the Snare laid by Cardinal  Beaton  Bishop of St  Andrews  for him and in a little Time lost the  French  King's Favour and when it was come to that Pass that he could neither stay at Home nor return to  France  with Safety he went into  England Anno  and put himself under the Protection of  Henry  VIII who generously received him into his Favour and gave him his Neice Lady  Margaret Douglas  in Marriage and an Estate in  England  to the Value of Seventeen Hundred Merks  Sterling per Annum  as an Equivalent for his own Fortune which was forfeited in  Scotland  and this Agreement the Earl made with that Prince that he should deliver into his Hands the Castle of  Dumbartoun  with the Isle of  Bute  and the Castle of  Rothesay  Rymer's Foedera Angliae  which tho' the Earl resolutely undertook yet the Success did not answer He lived at the Court of  England  till the he was called Home by Queen  Mary  and his Forfeiture repealed by Act of Parliament after he had been banished from his Country for Years his Son  Henry  Lord  Darnly  soon following him who being a young Nobleman of Illustrious Birth extremely handsome and of a Temper as well mix'd as his outward Proportions Queen  Mary  at first Sight became so enamour'd of him that neither the Menaces of Queen  Elizabeth  nor any other Considerations could deter her from marrying him when to render him the fitter Match for her she rais'd him to the Dignity of Duke of  Albany  After this when he had not been above Five Months in  Scotland  and did not exceed his Nineteenth Year she married him and with the Consent of most of the Peers declared him King  of which happy Marriage upon the th  June  to the perpetual Advantage of all  Britain  her Majesty was delivered of a Son King  James  VI First Monarch of  GreatBritain  But tho' the Queen's Love to the Lord  Darnly  at first had been very warm yet it began soon afterwards as much to cool toward him the Unkindness between them being chiefly fomented by one  David Rizio  an  Ita+lian  her Secretary for the  French  Tongue which Indignity the King revenged by entering into the Cabal with those who contrived and and murdered the poor old Man with Circumstances that were not at all allowable and 'tis probable that it was in Resentment of  Rizio  's Death that the Earl of  Bothwel  and Others officiously as thinking it might gratify the Queen most inhumanly murder'd this lovely Prince in his own Lodgings as he lay a Bed on the th of  Feburuary  tho'  Bothwel  who was the Murderer did maintain the Queen's Innocency to his last Moments And I think there was no other Ground for believing the Queen to be concerned in that  oul Action but her imprudent marrying that profligate Person so soon thereafter who by common Fame was reputed to be the Murderer of her Husband  Upon the Death of King  Henry  the Earl of  Lennox  his Father prosecuted the Earl of  Bothwel  as the Regicide but that Earl's Interest at Court so over ruled the Jury that he was formally acquitted of all Sus  cion as well as Action in the Murder which  Lennox  was forced to acquiesce in and from that Time forth he lived in Retirement till the Death of the Earl of  Murray  the Regent that he was unanimous  y chosen Reg  nt to the young King  James  VI his Grandson which great Tru  he executed for Months till he was murdered by a Party of the Queen's Friends on the th of  September    Buchanan's History  He was interred in the Chapel within the Castle of  Stirling  with this Inscription on his Tomb  Lo here a Prince and Potentate  Whose Life to understand  Was good he Just and

Kindness admitted him into his inwardest Councils and made him Duke of  Lennox  and Lord High Chamberl  in of  Scotland Anno  This extraordinary Favour of his with the King procured him Envy from many who secre  ly matter'd that he being a Man most devoted to the  Romish  Religion was sent from  France  to subvert the true Religion and that which increased the Suspicion the more was that he applied himself and gave Countenance to those who were most in the Interest of the King's Mother so that  William  Earl of  Gowrie  and Others imployed all their Wi  o remove him from the King  d thus they went to Work  The Duke having gone from  Perth  where the King then lay to  Edinburgh  to exercise his Jurisdiction as Chamberlain  Gowrie  and Others taking the Opportunity when he was out of the Way

and Others from Banishment and to send  Lennox  back again to  France  The Duke being a Man of a very mild Spirit did for the Publick Quiet's Sake and at the King's seeming Perswasion which they had forced him to use with him return to  France  where he soon after contracting Sickness died at  Paris  th  May  and at the Point of Death openly professed as he had done before the Protestant Religion

the King's Interest with signal Fidelity and Affection and made so entire a Resignation of himself to his Majesty that he abhorred all Artifices to shelter himself from the Pejudice of those who how powerful soever failed in their Duty to the King and therefore he was pursued with all imaginable Malice by them as one that would have no Quarter and as he had received great Bounties from the King

considering with what Lustre and Glory the House of  Lennox  had shone in former Times and that while the Dignity was in his Majesty's own Royal Person it was suppressed in the Crown wherefore that the Honour might be again revived and his Majesty having bestowed the Estate of  Lennox  upon the Lord  Charles Lennox  one of his Natural Sons whom he so sirnamed by  Lovisa de Querovale  Dutchess of

Earl of  Leven  was the Son of Captain  George Lesly  extracted from the House of  Balquhain  in the County of  Aberdeen  one of the most illustrious Families of the  Leslies  Laurus Lesl  ana  Being a younger Brother he entred early into the Life and Condition of a Souldier upon that Stage where some of all Europe then acted between the  Spainard  and the  Dutch  in the Lord  Vere  's Regiment in  Holland  where he attained the Reputation of a very good Officer in the Quality of a Captain to which he attained after few Years Service  After which he went to  Sweden  and entered into the Service of the greatest General of that Age  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  against the Imperialists where he performed such great Actions as procured him a general Estimation and thereby gained so much Honour that the King promoted him to be Lieutenant General and then Velt Marshal of his Armies with general Approbation as a Person who well deserved the Preferment Yea that King had so great an Opinion of Sir  Alexander Lesly  that in the when the Emperor had reduced all  Germany  except  Strals  nd  which was then invested by Count  Walstein  the Citizens having a Jealousy of their Governor at the desire of some of the  German  Princes made application to the King of  Sweden  to send them an Officer to command in that Place which he willingly granted and pitched upon Sir  Alexander Lesly  as a Person fit for that Station and he acquitted himself with so much Conduct and Gallantry that tho' the Plague was in the City the outWorks in a very ill condition and Count  Walstein  the  Imperial  General before it with a formidable and victorious Army he obliged him to raise the Siege with considerable loss tho' 'tis reported the Count was so confident of Success that he swore  Tho'  Stralsund  were hung in Chains betwixt Heaven and Earth he would have it  and General  Lesly  's behaviour was so agreeable to the Burghers that they made him a rich Present in Gold and struck several glorious Medals upon that Occasion some of which they presented him with  One of which I have had  he Honour to see still preserved in his Family    In the General  Lesly  was sent by the King of  Sweden  to make an Attack upon the Isle of  Rugen  in order to drive the Imperialists out of it which he effected And his Conduct and Bravery on this occasion was so very remarkable that it drew upon him the greatest  Encomiums  both from Friends and Enemies that could be devised by which means he opened a Way for the King of  Sweden  's marching into  Germany  General  Lesly  continued in the  Swedish  Service after the Death of King  Gustavus  under his Daughter Queen  Christiana  till the Year that the Troubles began in  Scotland  he returned to his Native Country upon an Invitation from the disaffected Nobility and as soon as the Covenanters began to list Men toward the raising an Army under the Obligation of the Covenant he was chosen to be their General to which he was by all Men held very equal having had good Experience of the most active Armies of that time and a Courage very notorious But that Enterprize ending without any Action by reason of a Pacification which was then agreed to the General had no Opportunity to signalize himself at that time But the Peace being of a short Duration and a new War breaking out the next Year Sir  Alexander Lesly  was again constituted General of the  Scots  Army which entred  England  in  August  who having routed a Party under the Lord  Conway  at  Newburn  took Possession of  Newcastle  where they kept their head Quarter Soon after which a Cessation was agreed to and a Treaty appointed at  Rippon  and afterward carried to  London  where a Peace was happily concluded The particular Articles whereof were ratified by his Majesty in the Parliament at the Conclusion of which General  Lesly  was created Earl of  Leven  The  Irish  Rebellion breaking out at this time his Lordship was appointed General of the  Scots  Forces that were raised and transported into that Kingdom upon the Charge of  England  for suppressing the Rebellion there in which Service he continued till the he was called over by the Parliament to form and command the  Scots  Army that was sent into  England  to assist the Parliament against the King by whose help the  Paliament's Forces obtained their great Victory at  MarstonMoor    July  where a noble and judicious Memoirist of the  English  Nation I mean the Lord  Hollis  does General  Lesly  the Honour as well as the Justice to ackowledge that his Lordship who commanded the  Scots  Horse and his Countryman Major General  Crawford  who was Major General to the Earl of  Manchester  's Brigade  were the Persons who did the principal Service that Day  quite contrary to what another celebrated Historian of the same Nation says of the General's Conduct in the Battle Only it is to be observed that that Author's Account of this Affair is wrote with so much Rancor and Prejudice and with such Circumstances of Inconsistency that the manner of the Narrative takes off much of the Credit of what he wrote in that Matter  In the Year when the Estates of  Scotland  raised an Army for the Relief of King  Charles  when he was made a Prisoner in the Isle of  Wight  General  Lesly  so well preserved his Reputation with those of his own Country who wedded the King's Interest most that he had the Command of the Army offered him but he thought fit to decline it upon Account of his Age and Infirmities which was happy for him considering the unfortunate Issue of it  After the Murder of the King his Lordship appeared mighty earnest and forwad for restoring of King  Charles  II and the Reestablishment of our Old Constitution and frankly entred into those Designs and Measures that were set on foot for the raising an Army for his Majesty's Service and was at the Battle of  Dumb  r  in Person in the Quality of a Volunteer After the Defeat of the  Scots  Army there and when another Design was set on foot for raising an Army to march with the King into  England  no Body appeared more forward in that Service than his Lordship but while General  Monk  lay before  Dundee  the old General with several other Noblemen having appointed a Meeting at  Eliot  in  Angus  to consult of Means to relieve the Town and other Matters concerning the War of which  Monk  having got Advertisement sent a strong Party of Horse and Dragoons commanded by Colonel  Morgan  to surprise them Which he did in the Night and the old General and the Principals of them being taken were sent to  London  and committed Prisoners to the  Tower  And notwithstanding all the Services he had done the  English  Parliament his Lordship did not receive the least Favour from them nor from  Cromwel  but underwent Sequestration and all other Severities the most loyal of his Countrymen suffered But the Crown of  Sweden  having entred into an Alliance with the Parliament of  England  her  Swedish  Majesty calling to Remembrance the great Services performed by General  Lesly  to the Crown of  Sweden  was pleased to interpose by her Resident then at  London  for his Liberation which being obtained his Lordship was so sensible of the Honour that Princess had done him that to shew his Gratitude for so singular a Favour he went over in Person to  Sweden  to return her Majesty his humble and hearty Thanks At which Court his Lordship was treated with all the Civility and Respect due to his Quality and Merit and returning thence to his Native Country lived mostly at his Seat of  Balgony

Foot by his Electoral Highness which he brought over with the Prince of  Orange  in his Expedition into  Great Britain Anno  Upon that Prince's Accession to the Crown my Lord  Leven  was sworn of the

is Sir  Peter Fraser  of  Dores  Baronet descended in a lineal Course of Succession as appears from his Writings which proves the Family beyond Dispute to be one of the most ancient and best extracted Families in the County of  Kincardin  where it hath still remained and except for a short Interval still continues with Lustre A more particular Account of which may be deduced in the subsequent part of this Work whereby it will appear to be very honourable as well considered in it self as in its illustrious Alliances and Branches  The Family of  Lovat  which this Title leads me more particularly to treat of as it is one of the best extracted so it is one of the most noble and most numerous of all the  Frasers  They are derived from Sir  Simon Fraser  Son of Sir  Alexander Fraser  and Nephew

I one  Livingius  was then possessed of that Barony in  WestLothian  which he called  Livingstoun  from his own Name according to the Custom of that Age for he makes a Donation to the Monks of the HolyCross at  Edinburgh de Ecclesia de Livingstoun cum dimidia carrucata Terrae ad dictam Ecclesiam pertinente prosalute animae suae  Records of Holyroodhouse Abbey in the publick Registers of King  He was succeeded in the Barony of  Livingstoun  by his Son  Thurstanus  called  filius Livingii  in a Charter of Confirmation to the Convent of  Holyroodhouse  of the Church of  Livingstoun  with the Lands and Tithes thereunto belonging for the Prosperity of his Soul both here and hereafter  Sir James Dalrymple's Historical Collections  He left a Son  Alexander filius Thurstani  as he is designed in a Charter of King  William  's who being Lord of the Barony of  Livingstoun  assumed first that Appellation and transmitted it to his Posterity for a Sirname in whose Line it continued above Years till the Reign of King  James  IV that Mr  Bartholomew Livingstoun  of that Ilk died without Issue  Ch in pub Arch  and with him the Family was extinct  The immediate Ancestor of this Noble Family was Sir  William Livingston  who in the th of King  David  II had a Grant of the Barony of  Calendar  in the County of  Stirling  then in the Crown by the Forfaulture of  Patrick de Calendar  Charta penes Vicecomitem de Kilsyth  whose only Daughter and Heir  Christian  he took to Wife the better to fortify his Title thereto Likeas in the th of the said King they had a Grant to themselves and their Heirs of the Lands of  Kilsyth  then in the King's Hands by the Decease of  Margaret  Daughter of  Robert De la Wall  This Robert De la Wall had acquir'd I find the Barony of Kilsyth from Malcom Fleming Earl of Wigton who was the King's Donatar upon the Forfaulture of Patrick de Calendar    This Sir  William  was a brave Man and one of the  Scots  Barons who were taken Prisoners with King  David Bruce  at the Battle of  Durham  on the th of  October    Rymer's Foedera  But being afterward releas'd the next ensuing Year when a Treaty was set on foot for the King's Redemption he was one of the Commissioners employed in that honourable Negotiation  Ibidem  tho without Success at that Time Likewise in the he was together with  William  Bishop of St  Andrews Thomas  Bishop of  Caithness Patrick  Bishop of  Brechin Patrick  Earl of  March  Sir  Robert Erskine  appointed by  Robert  Lord high Steward of  Scotland  Lieutenant as he's design'd to the most illustrious Prince  David  by the Grace of God King of  Scotland  in a full Council holden at  Perth  with Advice and Consent of the Prelates Nobles and whole Community of the Kingdom Plenipotentiaries and Commissioners with Power to them to treat about the Redemption of the King and a final Peace with  England  which was happily agreed to on the d of  October  thereafter the Ransom being a Merks  Sterl  Money  Ibidem  for which Sir  William Livingston  's Son and Heir was delivered one of the Hostages  By the foresaid  Christian de Calendar  his Wife he had Sir  William  his Son and Heir Father of Sir  John Livingstoun  of the  Calendar  who was slain in the Service of his Country at the Battle of  Homildoun  against the  English  on the th of  March    Hume's History of the Earls of Douglas and Angus  His first Marriage was with  Monteith  Daughter to  Monteith  of  Carse  Genealogy of the House of Livingston penes me  By her he had Sir  Alexander  and two younger Sons  Robert  Progenitor of the first Branch of the  Livingstons  of  Westquarter  of whom sprung the House of  Kinnaird  first raised to the honour of Viscount and then Earl of  Newburgh  and  John Livingston  Esquire His second Wife was  Agnes  Daughter of Sir  James Douglas  of  Dalkeith  Charta penes Vicecomitem de Kilsyth  by whom he had Sir  William Livingston  first of the House of  Kilsyth  Ibidem  and a Daughter  Agnes  Wife of Sir  John Gordon  of  Gordoun  Which  Alexander  was one of the Hostages for the Ransom of King  James  I when he was relieved from his Captivity in  England Anno    Rymer's Foed  By whom he was made a Knight and frequently employed in Affairs of the highest Importance for I find he was one of the Barons that sat upon the Trial of  Murdoch  Duke of  Albany  by whom that Duke was Sentenced and condemn'd to lose his Head Upon the Death of King  James  I he was by the Advice and Consent of the three Estates of Parliament appointed Tutor to the young King  James  II whose Person was still in the Custody of Sir  William Crichton  the Chancellor in the Castle of  Edinburgh  of which he was Governor tho very probably he was  kept by him contrary to Law Wherefore that Sir  Alexander Livingston  on whom the Parliament had conferr'd that high Trust might get the King's Person into his own Custody he fell upon this Stratagem to bring it about  The Queen Mother was intirely in Sir  Alexander  's Interest and to effectuate her Purpose cometh from  Stirling  to  Edinburgh  pretending a friendly Visit to her Son which the Chancellor very willingly allowed her in the Castle several Days During which Time she cajolled the Prince into an Obedience to her Will and the Chancellor into a Belief that she designed nothing but what she own'd At length she told the Chancellor that she would but stay one Night longer in the Castle being the next Day to set out for  Whitekirk  in  Buchan  to perform a Vow which she had made for the Health of the King whose Person she earnestly recommended to his Care till she should return He assured her of his Fidelity both in that and all other respects and so left her Thus all Eyes but those of a trusty Few being asleep the young King was carefully put up in a Chest among his Mother's Furniture and then convoyed to  Leith  and from thence by Water to  Stirling  where Sir  Alexander Livingston  and those of his Party received him with great Joy  But notwithstanding this great Favour of the Queen's to Sir  Alexander Livingston  yet for some Reasons of State not long thereafter he and some of his Friends did restrain her Majesty in the Liberty she had some while enjoyed of the Company of her Son Which her Majesty resented as a very high Indignity But on the th of  September  the Business was settled betwixt the Queen and  Livingston  by a solemn Indenture still extant in the Earl of  Linlithgow  's Custody And because it seems very much to correct all our Historians even the very latest Writers of the Life of King  James  II in the Chronology and sets the History of that Prince's Minority in a truer light than it has been hitherto done I shall here insert the original Indenture  "This Appoyntment made at

thus got the young King into his Custody in order to countenance his after Actions he began to carry with a very high Hand as being assured that none would dare to controul him in so much that he created many Enemies to himself and among the rest the Queen Mother whom upon Suspicion or Pretence that she and Sir  James Stewart  her Husband were carrying on some Intrigue with the Earl of  Douglas  committed Sir  James  to Prison and the Queen her self to a narrow Apartment in the Castle of  Stirling  which so much incensed her that she resolv'd upon Revenge and being as yet Mistress of her Son's Inclinations very soon brought about a second Turn of Affairs at Court For while Sir  Alexander Livingston  was at  Perth  employed in the publick Affairs  Drummond's Hist of King James the II  She carried on a Plot so closely and dextrously with the Chancellor that one Morning as the King was Hunting in the Park of  Sirling  his small Retinue were on a sudden surrounded with a Body of about Horse commanded by the Lord Chancellor in Person so that the King was carried off without any Opposition to  Edinburgh  where he was welcomed by the Acclamations of the People  Sir  Alexander Livingston  upon Advice of what had happened came to  Edinburgh  and wisely considering that the Chancellor could not more probably stand his Ground amidst so many Difficulties without him than he had done without his Assistance he thought the best way was to endeavour to bring him to Terms of Accommodation which by the Mediation of the Bishops of  Aberdeen  and  Murray  was at length effected the Chancellor continuing in his Office as formerly and the Custody of the King's Person was again committed to Sir  Alexander  which high Trust he executed with great Fidelity till the that the King now arriv'd to the Age of Years began to govern in some Measure by himself Soon after which the Earl of  Douglas  became the principal Favourite at Court who bearing no good Will to Sir  Alexander Livingston  or any of the former Ministry prevail'd so far with the King as  o call a Parliament Which accordingly  met at  Perth  Black Acts of Parliament  Thither he and others of his Party were Summon'd to Answer to such Accusations as should be ex  ited against them Sir  Alexander  was accused of having alienated the Crown Lands wasted the Royal Revenues and seized upon the King's Jewels the Furniture of his Houses and what else he could divert to his own private Use In consequence of which he was declared Rebel his Estate confiscated and sent Prisoner to  Dunbartoun  there to remain during Pleasure This Treatment of Sir  Alexander  's was thought very hard But the Fate of  William Livingston  his second Son Sir  Robert Livingston  of  Drumray  late Lord Treasaurer was much harder for they were both beheaded in the Castle of  Edinburgh  where Authors say that Mr  Livingston  being a young Man of admirable Parts and great Eloquence made such a moving Discourse upon the Vanity of the World and the Vicissitude of humane Affairs as drew Tears from the Eyes of all that were present But after some time of Imprisonment the King was pleased to restore Sir  Alexander Livings  on  to

whom his Majesty King  Charles  I honoured with the Title of Earl of  Lowdon  Charta in Rotulis Caroli I ad Annum  by Letters patent bearing Date  th  of  May  and that for the greater Splendor of his Majesty's Coronation  When the Troubles broke out in the Year the Earl of  Lowdon  was one of the most leading of the Peers who testified a Dislike of the Ways and Methods had been taken in Reference to the Liturgy and the other Innovations then brought into the Church and assoon as the Party who pressed for Reformation did resolve themselves into Societies his Lordship was one of the Nobility who were chosen to conduct their Affairs and to represent their Grievances which he did in a Speech before the Council on the  st  of  December  to this Purpose  "That by the Methods lately taken it appeared there was an entire new Model of Government in Church and State intended That the late Service Book and the Book of Canons which were then set out and imposed on the Nation had passed no Approbation of the Assembly nor any Convocation of of the Clergy nor had been so much as communicated to the PrivyCouncil but appeared to be so many new Laws imposed on the Kingdom by the King's sole Authority contarary to the established Laws of the Land merely contrived by the Bishops on whom he craved Justice in a legal way"  When his Majesty had raised an Army against the Covenanters in and was advanced as far as the Borders my Lord  Lowdon  was one of the Peers who signed an Address to the King  "Lamenting their ill Fortune that their Enemies had so great Credit with his Majesty as to perswade him to believe that they were or could be disobedient to him a Thing that could never enter into their loyal Hearts that they desired nothing but to be admitted into the Presence of their gracious Sovereign to lay their Grievances at his Royal Feet and leave the Determination of them entirely to his own Wisdom and Pleasure"  The Humility of the Stile wrought so upon the King's Nature who thought it great Pity that any Blood should be spilt in a Contention which he himself might put an End to by his own Royal Word as soon as he should hear their Complaints That he easily consented to bring the Business to a fair Treaty to which the Earl was named one of the Commissioners upon the Part of the Covenanters and who accordingly met with such  English  Commissioners as his Majesty was pleased to appoint at the  Berks  where they entred upon and concluded a Pacification whereby  "The Armies were to be disbanded an Act of Oblivion pass'd the King's Forts and Castles to be restored and a Parliament and a General Assembly to be called for a full Settlement that thereby all Factions Animosities might be reconciled and composed"  But this Peace was of a very short Duration for the Pacification being ill kept on both Sides the King disowning what had been said to have been transacted upon his Part and the Covenanters remitting nothing of their  Zeal against the Bishops and the Liturgy having likewise entred a Protestation  "That they did not intend by any Thing contained in the Treaty to vacate any of the Proceedings which had been in the late General Assembly of  Glasgow  "  By these Proceedings the Breach became greater and wider and Preparations for War began to be renewed on both Sides with more Vigour than ever But before Things should come to the last Extremity and that if possible Matters might be composed without Blood his Majesty thought fit to re+quire the Covenanters to send some Persons intrusted by their Body to attend him to give an Account of their Proceedings and which was the Thing they always most desired Accordingly certain Commissioners were named of which Number the Earl of  Lowdon  was one At this Time when the Commissioners repaired to  London  there happened to be a Letter intercepted and transmitted to his Majesty that had been signed by the Earl of  Lowdon  and the chief of the Covenanters written to the  French  King directed  An Roy  a Stile only used by Subjects to their natural King  "In which they complained of the Hardness Injustice of the Government that was exercised over them put him in mind of the Dependence  Scotland  formerly had upon that Crown and desired him now to take them into his Protection and give them Assistance  Clarendon's History of the Civil War  "  This Letter being seen and perused by the Lords of the Council of  England  and the Lord  Lowdon  being examined and refusing to give any other Answer than  "That it was writ before the Agreement and thereupon reserved and never sent that if he had committed any Offence he ought to be questioned for it in  Scotland  not in  England  insisting upon his safe Conduct demanded Liberty to return"  But notwithstanding all the Defences the Earl was able to make he was committed Prisoner to the Tower and tho his Commitment was highly resented by the Parliament as a Breach of the publick Faith yet he continued in Prison some Months thereafter till by the Interposition and Intercession of the Marquis of  Hamilton  he was enlarged on the  th  of  June    Burnet's History of the two Dukes of Hamilton  when his Lordship renewed all Professions of Duty to the King and a Readiness to engage in his Service as  oon as he should return to his native Country where his Power Interest was as great as any Mans which he did by disposing all those upon whom he had Influence to hearken to all Over tures for a Peace with his Majesty But notwithstanding all the Endeavours of the Lord  Lowdon  and others who heartily desired an Accommodation Matters came to a second Rupture and upon a Party of the Covenanters having routed the Lord  Conway  at  Newburn  who appeared for the King and having taken  Newcastle  they thought fit after that to present a humble Petition and Address to the King for a new Treaty which his Majesty condescending to and  Rippon  being named the Place of Meeting the Earl of  Lowdon  was appointed one of the Commissioners for the Treaty But all they they did there was only to agree to a Cessation of Arms a safe Conduct being granted to his Lordship and the rest of his Collegues for going to  London  to carry on and conclude the Treaty there Which they did with all possible Diligence and which his Majesty confirmed and the Lords of the Privy Council were made the Conservators of the Peace during the Interval of Parliaments  The Peace betwixt the two Nations being thus happily concluded it was judged necessary that the Treaty  should be ratified by the Parliament of  Scotland  which in the his Majesty was pleased to hold himself in his own Royal Person for the full Satisfaction of his People and wherein all Particulars that had been in Dispute were adjusted to the seeming Joy and Satisfaction of every Man and the Security of all that was then established was sufficiently provided for In the End of the Session his Majesty was pleased to bestow Honours and Offices on some principal Persons who had merited well at his Hands and who were best able to serve him so the Chancellour's Place was bestowed upon the Lord  Lowdon  during Life and that with the full Consent and Approbation of the Parliament  Rescinded Acts of Parliament  who looked on him as he was throughout the whole Kingdom as a very wise Man excellently fitted and qualified for the Discharge of that great Trust as the Exigence of Affairs then stood  When the Civil War broke out in  England  the Chancellour repaired to the King at  York  Clarendon's History  when his Majesty did so fully satisfy his Lordship with the Justice and Honour of his Carriage toward his  English  Parliament that he wrote to the  Scots  Commissioners at  London  in the Name and by the Direction of the Lords of the Secret Council  "That they should present to the two Houses the deep Sense they had of the Injuries and Indignities which were offered to the King whose just Rights they were bound to desend and that they should conjure them to bind up those Wounds which were made and not to widen them by Sharpness of Language and to give his Majesty such real Security for his Safety among them by an effectual declaring against Tumults and such other Actions as were justly offensive to his Majesty that he might be induced to reside nearer to them and comply with them in such Propositions as should be reasonably made  Ibid  "  Soon after which taking leave of the King his Lordship renewed all imaginable Professions of Duty to his Majesty and a Readiness to ingage in his Service which the King was very well assured he could do  In the the Chancellour was sent Commissioner from the Privy Council of  Scotland  who called themselves  the Conservators of the Peace between the two Kingdoms  to his Majesty while he was at  Oxford  desiring to pass as a Mediator betwixt the King and the two Houses in  England  when his Lordship used all Importunity and Arguments to perswade the King in private to consent to the Alteration of the Government of the Church of  England  assuring him that it would be a Mean not only to hinder the Subjects of  Scotland  from adhering to the  English  Parliament but that it would oblige them to assist his Majesty to the outmost in the Vindication of all his Rights But he found the King too strongly fixed to be sway'd in what he thought a Case of Conscience by a Consideration of Convenience  He then betook himself to his own proper Errand which consisted of two Parts the one to offer the Mediation of the Conservators of the Peace of the Kingdom for the Composure of the Differences between his Majesty and the two Houses the other to desire his Majesty that he would summon a Parliament in  Scotland  In Answer to the first Demand of Mediation His Majesty told him  "That he could not find any colour or pretence of Authority granted by the Act of Pacification by which the Commissioners for  Scotland  could conceive themselves interested in a Faculty of Mediation that the Clause mentioned by them related only to the Differences that might grow between the two Nations which his Majesty said had  been and should be inviolably observed by him and therefore he could not admit of any such Mediation as they proposed"  For the other Demand of a Parliament in  Scotland  The King told him and the rest of the Commissioners  "That against the Time by which they could legally demand a Parliament naming the Day which was to be on the first Tuesday of  June  he would issue out his Writs and there being no emergent Cause to do it sooner he would forbear to put his Subjects there to that Trouble which those Meetings how necessary soever would naturally carry with them"  So his Lordship perceiving that he should not receive Satisfaction in either of these Proposals at last returned home  re infecta  In the when his Majesty did renew his Offer of Peace to the two Houses of Parliament which they likewise agreeing to and  Uxbridge  being assigned for the Place of Meeting the Chancellour the Earl of  Lawderdale  Sir  Charles Erskine  and Mr  Robert Barclay  Member of Parliament for the Burgh of  Irvine  and Mr  Alexander Henderson  in Matters only which related to the Church were sent Commissioners from  Scotland  But that Treaty unhappily coming to nothing a bloody civil War thereupon ensued  When the King put himself into the  Scots  Army before  Newwark  and the  English  positively demanded the Delivery up of the King's Person the Earl of  Lowdon  was appointed to treat with the Parliament of  England  about that important Affair where in a free Conference with the two Houses he publickly declared  "That an eternal Infamy would ly upon the whole Nation if they should deliver up the Person of the King the securing of which was equally their Duty as it was the Parliament's and the Disposal of his Person in order to that Security did equally belong to them as to the Parliament However he said he would use all the Perswasion and all the Importunity he could with the King that his Majesty might yield and consent to the Propositions the Parliament had sent to him"  In the the Lord Chancellour was one of the Commissioners appointed to attend the King from the Parliament of  Scotland  while he was at the Isle of  Wight  to treat with his Majesty anent a full Accomodation with that Kingdom and which they at last concluded on Terms of great Advantage to the Nation in Recompense of which the Chancellour and his Collegues undertook to raise an Army to rescue and relieve his Majesty from the Captivity he was then under and to restore him to his just Rights and that no Time might be lost as soon as the Treaty was signed the Chancellour departed for  Scotland  where at first he used his outmost Endeavours to procure such Persons to be elected Members to the Parliament as he knew to be most inclined to the Service in hand in which the Honour of the Country was so much concerned  When the Parliament met on the d of  March    Rescinded Acts  the Lord Chancellour was chosen President of the Convention wherein he employed all his Power and Interest to bring the Parliament to comply with the Engagement declare for the King tho the Affair met with great Opposition yet the Resolution was carried in putting the Country in a Posture Defence and raising an Army to relieve the King I need not here recount the Fate of that Army which marched into  England  under the Conduct of the Duke of  Hamilton  nor how unsuccesfull it proved for the Design it was intended    b  Cromwel's Indemnity to the People of Scotland  All I shall further observe is that as there had been a Party in the Parliament whom the King's Concessions did not satisfy so they declared against the Engagement as unlawfull and ungodly and the violent Party of the Clergy joining with them they passed an Act against the  Engagers  that was all those who had been the Promoters of it ranking them into several  Classes  whereby they were excluded from all Offices of publick Trust and vote in Parliament till they had satisfied the Church by a publick Profession of their Repentance for their Accession to the  unlawfull Engagement  as it was called  When the Parliament met after the Murder of King  Charles  I the Lord Chancellour was chosen President of that Session who by their Act proclaimed King  Charles  II 'Tis beyond all Doubt the Chancellour gave all imaginable Assistance he could to bring over the King from  Holland  and to raise the Army that marched with his Majesty into  England  but that Army being unhappily defeated at  Worcester  and the Usurpers absolutely prevailing over all the three Kingdoms the Chancellour was not only outed of his Office but was for ced for the Security of his Person to fly to the  Highlands  where he lay concealed till the Earl of  Glencairn  by vertue of his Majesty's Commission drew together a small Body of Horse and Foot for his Majesty's Service that the Earl of  Lowdon  repaired to him for which he was for  eited by the Powers that then prevailed and thereafter when  Cromwel  granted an Indemnity to the People of  Scotland  both the Earl of  Lowdon  the Lord  Ma+chline  his Son were particularly excepted After which his Lordship the Chancellour continued in the  Hills  till all Hope of serving the King was given over that he capitulated to lay down his Arms and live quietly at his own House which he did in a Country Retirement till it pleased God to bring back King  Charles  II to his Throne which the Lord  Lowdon  did not long survive for he died in the Beginning of the This noble Lord left Issue by  Margaret  Baroness of  Lowdon  his Wife aforesaid  James  his Successor Lady  Jean  married to  George  Earl of  Panmure

Continent at  DuchalCastle  in  Renfrew  shire Tho I have not seen directly any Mention of them till King  William  's Time that  William de Isle  is one of the Witnesses to that Deed which  Walterus

of the former is Witness to the Vendition of the Lands of  Aldingstoun  to the Abbot of  Paisley  and his Title being added to the Sirname is an undoubted Evidence that he was then a very remarkable Person for I cannot but observe that this is the very first time I have found any in the Western Parts adding a local Title to the Sirname  In the grand Competition betwixt  Bruce  and  Baliol  for the Crown Sir  Walter Lyle  was upon the  Bruce  's Side as his Friend and Namesake Sir  Allan Lyle  was upon the  Baliol  's afterward and adhered to the Interest of  Edward Baliol  in all the Turns of the Times In Consideration whereof upon his coming to the Crown he made him Sheriff and Governor of  Bute  and Lord High Chamberlain of  Scotland  Sir James Balfour's List of Chamberlains  But whether this Sir  Alan Lyle  was the Head and Representative or only a Branch of the Family I do not know however it is certain that  John Lyle  of  Duchal  was in Favour with King  David Bruce  in

he had the hard Fate to be taken Prisoner and sent to  England  where he endured a long and tedious Imprisonment of no less than eight Years till after the Battle of  Bannockburn  he was exchanged for another Person of Quality  Anno    Rymer's foedera  How or where he passed the rest of his Life till the I cannot take upon me to ascertain that  Thomas  Earl of  Murray  Governour of  Scotland  in

Sir  Alexander Stewart  eldest Son of  Alexander  Earl of  Buchan  Brother to King  Robert  III when she resigned the Earldom of  Mar  and Lordship of  Garioch  which was vested and seased in her

Highlanders  effectually secured the Government against the like Attempts for many Years thereafter But tho he had great Wealth at home yet he shewed himself so averse to Idleness and Pleasure that with a gallant Company of his Countrymen Volunteers he went over to the LowCountries after the Battle of  Harlaw  and entred into the Service of the Duke of  Burgundy  Abercromby  where he made so fine a Figure in that Country that after the Death of his first Lady he gained the Countess of  Holland  in Marriage and in her Right laid Claim to that Sovereignty But the  Hollanders  would not submit to the Government of a Foreigner which obliged him to return to  Scotland  in the Reign of King  Jomes  I in whose hands he resigned the Earldom of  Mar  in favours of Sir  Thomas Stewart  his Natural Son  Charta in Rotulis Jac I  reserving his own Liferent but he dying without Issue as well as his Father whom Death overtook in the Year there arose a Competition betwixt the King and  Robert  Lord  Erskine  about the Earldom of  Mar  the  main Plea for the King was a Right from the last Earl It was pleaded in behalf of the Lord  Erskine  that his Right was derived from his Ancestors by Proximity of Blood as nearest Heir of Lady  Isabel Douglas  the last Countess of  Mar  In the End Judgment was given against his Lordship in favours of the King who thereupon possessed himself of the Earldom of  Mar  and annexed it to the Crown where it continued till King  James  II gave it to his Brother  John  then created Earl of  Mar  Charta in publ Archivis  But he dying without Issue it fell back again to the Crown where it remained till the Queen  Mary  erected it into an Earldom in Favours of  James  Prior of St  Andrews  her natural Brother and thereafter restored  John  Lord  Erskine  to be Earl of  Mar  by way of Justice  Anno  in lieu of which the other noble Lord was made Earl of  Murray  ERSKINE Earl of  Mar  ALtho 'tis not above three hundred Years since the  Erskines  had any Title to the Earldom of  Mar  yet this illustrious Family considered in it self is very great and eminent if we respect either its Antiquity or the many great Employments and Perferments they have been honoured with these four Hundred Years past and tho I cannot show the precise Time when or by whom the Name was first assumed yet 'tis certain it was derived from the Barony of  Erskine  in the Shire of  Renfrew  and so being a local Sirname is of Consequence very ancient tho the first mention I have found of them is no higher than the Time of King  Alexander  II in the  th  of whose Reign  Henry de Erskine  is Witness in the Gift which  Amelick  Brother of  Maldwin  Earl of  Lennox  made to the Chanons of  Paisly  of the Patronage of the Church of  Roseneth  with the Tithes

conspicuous for his firm and stedfast Loyalty to King  David  than his Father had been to King  Robert  even when his Interest was at the very lowest and the Usurper  Baliol  upon the Throne for as soon as the Loyalists took the Fields and Declared for their lawful Sovereign Sir  Robert Erskine  joined the Lord High Steward and other Patriots who fought with and defeated the Rebels and thereby recovered a great part of the Country to the King's Obedience for which he was afterward rewarded as his singular Merit deserved  When a Treaty was set on Foot for redeeming King  David  from Captivity when he was taken Prisoner at the Battle of  Durham Anno  Sir  Robert Erskine  Lord of  Erskine  as he is called in the Record was one of the Commissioners employed in that honourable Negotiation  Rymer's foedera  but that Treaty not taking effect he was always one of the Plenipotentiaries that were appointed for the same purpose and renewed every Year tho all of them were

with the  English  Nation who at length agreed that King  David  should be released set free and ransomed for Merks  Sterling  Money to be paid Yearly by Merks till the whole Sum was paid to which no Man seems to have contributed more frankly than Sir  Robert  and gave his eldest Son one of the Hostages for Performance of the Treaty  Rymer  This signal Loyalty to his distressed Sovereign could not fail to be nobly rewarded and therefore his Majesty no sooner returned home than he constituted him Justiciary for the Northern District of  Scotland Anno    Charta in publ Archivis  and the same Year

more parti+cularly he made him a Grant of an Annuity of Forty  Me  ks Sterling  for merly payable to the Crown out of the Barony of  Cadzow  which he ex+changed with Sir  David Hamilton  for his Lands

valu'd and esteem'd by  Robert  III for his Wisdom Prudence and Experience for in that King sent him his Ambassador into  England  to treat with that State upon Affairs of the highest Consequence

Earldom of Mar  which he was obliged to acquiesce in But notwithstanding the hard Measure he thought he had undergone from the Crown and which might have been thought would have made him ready to have taken all Occasions of being severe to it yet he was a Person of so much Honour and Vertue that in the succeeding Reign of  James  III when he had a very fair Opportunity to be revenged yet he no sooner saw the ways of Duty toward the King declined and his just Power invaded by a strong Party of the Nobility than out of pure Conscience to serve his Majesty when he was in Distress he frankly ingaged in his Quarrel and when the War broke out accepted a Command in the Army in which he continued till the very End that the King was miserably killed in the Field of  Stirling  on the  th  of  June  where some Authors without any just Ground have asserted that his Lordship had the same Fate with his Master But that it was not so evidently appears from several Memorials concerning him which

High Trust he approved himself with so much Fidelity that the King when he came to Age highly valued him insomuch that he sent him upon a solemn Embassy into  France anno  to propose a Match betwixt the King and a Daughter of that Crown which having performed to his Majesty's Satisfaction  Buchanani Historia Rerum Scoticarum  he soon thereafter employed his Lordship in the same Quality to  Henry  VIII of  England  to congratulate that King for their joint Prosperity and to consult with him about a Marriage betwixt his Nephew King  James  and a Daughter of the Duke of  Vendosme  's whom the  French  King had offered him his own Daughter being of a weak and sickly Constitution  Mr Drummond of Hawthorden's Life of King James V  which Office he discharged with Exactness and Fidelity and was

Erskin  was a Person of such noble Nature generous Disposition and other bright Qualities as rendred him very capable of acting the Part of a most consummate Statesman which he did afterward in the highest and most eminent Stations a Subject could attain to Being at first a younger Brother his Father judged the best way was to provide for him in the Church and therefore having given him Education accordingly he was in due time made Commendator of  Inchmach  mo  in the end of King  James  V's Reign no doubt for his better Support in the prosecution of his Studies to qualif  e him for a higher Office in the Church but both his Brothers dying without Heirs of their Bodies he was obliged to quit the Character of a Churchman and marry in order to raise up Heirs to the Family Which he did and matched with  Annabella  Daughter of  William Murray  of  Tillibardin  Paternal Ancestor to the present Duke of  Athole  by whom he had  John  his Successor and a Daughter  Margaret  married to  Archibald  Earl of  Angus  Upon his Accession to the Honour through the Demise of his Father tho he was but then a very young Man he had so fair a Reputation and was so generally well esteemed that the Queen Regent thought fit in the  Dr Anderson's History of Scotland MS in Biblioth jurid Edin  to give his Lordship the Command of the Castle of  Edinburgh  in which Station he behaved so well that he preserved himself in the good Opinion of the Queen's Majesty and the whole Nation  When Queen  Mary  returned from  France Anno  her Majesty having made Choice of a new Privy Council my Lord  Erskine  was named one of that Number in which Station he soon rendred himself very gracious to the Queen insomuch that she made him a Grant of the Abbey of  Inchmachomoe  and diverse other Church Lands then newly dissolved His Interest at Court now being very great he thought it a favourable Opportunity and a proper Season for him to renew his Claim to the Earldom of  Mar  and having made good a Title through a long deduced Pedigree from  Gratney  Earl of  Mar  his Pretensions being supported by the Queen's Countenance  his Claim was allowed and ratified by Act of Parliament And tho' my Lord  Mar  was a very zealous Protestant 'tis worthy our Remark Queen  Mary  trusted him as much as she could have done any of her own Profession which she did eminently manifest by the Confidence she reposed in him for as soon as she was happily delivered of the Prince  James  VI her Majesty committed him to the Tuition and Custody of the Earl in the Castle of  Edinburgh  then under his Command and he discharged that great Trust so well and was so much superior to all Tentations of Infidelity that when the Earl of  Bothwell  had married the Queen he could not prevail with my Lord  Mar  either by Promises or Menaces to deliver up the Prince to him which was the Thing in the World that wicked Earl had set his Heart most upon when 'tis known his Lordship could have made his own Terms In the End when  Bothwell  found all his Offers rejected he was glad to allow the Earl to carry the Prince to  Stirling  Castle of which he himself was heritable Governor and then delivered up  Edinburgh  Castle to  Bothwell  on the st of  May  who immediately plac'd a Creature of his own Sir  James Balfour  in it by which Means the Earl of  Mar  became under God the happy Instrument of the Prince's miraculous Preservation during his long Minority However he still retained great Duty and Affection to the Queen even after Things came to an Extremity so it would appear that nothing but a pure Principle of Conscience for the Preservation of the Heir of the Kingdom first engaged his Lordship in the Company of those who set the Crown upon the Head of the Prince when he was an Infant little more than one Year old When the Civil War began I do'nt find this generous and prudent Lord much engaged on either Side for his particular Province being to take Care of his Royal Pupil he stay'd himself much with him and as he grew up in Years gave him a Princely Education appointing the famous Mr  Buchannan  Mr  Peter Young  Mr  David Eriskine  Commendator of  Cambuskenneth  and Mr  Adam Erskine  Commendator of  Dryburgh  to be his Instructors Gentlemen who wanted none of those Qualities which were to be wished to be in the Persons to whom the Education of a great and hopeful Prince was committed and for framing his Mind and Manners in his young and tender Years  My Lord  Mar  bore no publick Office in the State till the that upon the Death of  Matthew  Earl of  Lennox  the Regent the Earl of  Mar  was a Nobleman so generally well esteemed that he was by the unanimous Consent of the King's Party chosen Regent of  Scotland  in his Room  Sept  In which great Office he had says one  Less Satisfaction than he expected for when he had strugled no less under the turbulent Councils of his own Party than the Insolencies of his Adversaries died for very Grief after he had governed only Thirteen Months upon the    th of  October  and left behind him so unblemished a Reputation as cannot be very easily parallel'd in the like Circumstances  He was interr'd in the Vault of his Family among his Ancestors in the Paroch Church of  Alloa  under a plain Monument without any other Inscription than signifying him to be the Person there interr'd  To  John  Earl of  Mar  succeeded  John  his Son then under Age of whom I have found little memorable till the his Lordship being then very young he was induced to join with others of the discontented Nobility who seized on the King at  Ruthven  Castle and petition'd his Majesty that he would remove Sir  James Stewart  who then stiled himself Earl of  Arran  from his Councils being a Person of evil Fame and Disaffection to the publick Peace of the Kingdom and an Instrument of Discontent between the King and his Nobility But the Way and Manner of that Enterprize being afterwards adjudged treasonable the Earl was obliged to give up the Command of  Stirling  Castle and to leave his Majesty's Dominions which he did and transporting himself into  Ireland  from whence he came over to  England  and joined the the Lord  Hamiltoun  and others who had been outlaw'd during the Regency of the Earl of  Mortoun  with whom he returned to  Scotland Anno  when he obtained his Majesty's Pardon was restored to his Command of  Stirling  Castle and to a more than ordinary Share of his Majesty's Favour which his Lordship never afterward forfaulted by any undutiful Behaviour  In the when it pleased God to bless his Majesty with a Son Prince  Henry  the King reposing full Confidence in his Lordship's Fidelity committed the Tuition of his Royal Highness to him and his Majesty was at the same Time pleased to write with his own Hand the following Letter to his Lordship  My Lord of  Mar  BEcause in the Security of my Son consisteth my Security I have concredited to you the Charge of his Keeping upon the Trust I have in your Honesty This I command you out of my own Mouth being in the Company of those I like otherwise from any Charge that can come from me you shall not deliver him and in Case God call me at any Time see that neither for the Queen nor Estates their Pleasure you deliver him till he be Eighteen Years of Age and then he command you himself  How the Earl discharged this great Trust will best appear from the Exoneration which his Majesty gave him under the Great Seal when his Lordship carried the Prince to  London  upon his Father's Accession to the  English  Crown a Copy of which I shall here insert  JAMES  by the Grace of GOD King of  GreatBritain France  and  Ireland c  Whereas it is not unknown that upon just and necessary Considerations we did commit in the Year of our Lord    the Custody of the Prince our Son to our Right Trusty and wellbeloved Cousin and Councellor the Earl of  Mar  as well in Regard of our Security which consisteth in his Security as in Respect there was none more fit to take that Charge than the Earl of whose Sincerity in Religion Affection and Fidelity to our Person to our State together with his Discretion and Judgment we have had so good Experience having now otherwise resolved to dispose of him and considering how just and necessary it is for us to give as ample a Discharge to our Cusin the Earl of  Mar  as may be We do therefore first declare to all Persons whatsoever by these Presents That we have very great Cause most graciously to allow of that great Care which he hath shewed in providing for his vertuous Education Next That he hath observed our Directions for his Delivery And lastly That he hath been received in so good State of Health and Constitution of Body and Mind that we have Occasion not only to take Comfort in God's Favour thereby so confirmed to us but do now testifie and declare by Vertue of these present Letters that we do discharge acquit and exonerate against us our Heirs and Successors our said Cousin the Earl of  Mar  concerning the Education and Delivery of our Son as foresaid and do hereby notifie to the World that we have received full and intire Satisfaction answerable to the Trust reposed in him and are resolved to lay it up in Memory as a Record of his constant Love and Duty towards us and  taking ourselves bound on the Honour and Gratitude of a Prince not only to give him Acquittance but to reward him in Time coming for so great and memorable a Service  June  Neither are we to forget That in the his Majesty sent him Ambassador to Queen  Elizabeth  to con+gratulate that Princess upon her sup+pressing the audacious Attempt of the Earl of  Essex  In which Negotiation his Lordship deported himself with such Prudence and Conduct that he brought the Principals of the  English  Ministry to favour his Majesty's Succession to that Crown which took Effect in less than Two Years there after which upon another Occasion his Majesty did very gratefully acknowledge and own

April  d and shortly thereafter caused him to be sworn of his Majesty's most honourable PrivyCouncil of  England  and made him a Grant of sundry Abbacies and other ChurchLands then dissolved from the Crown But his Majesty being still more and more desirous to confer greater Honours on his Lordship was graciously pleased to constitute him Lord High Treasurer of  Scotland  upon the Removal of Sir  Robert Ker  Earl of  Somerset  and had the WhiteStaff delivered to him on the d of  December  in which Office he demean'd himself so well that he did his Master much Service and preserved himself in the good Opinion and Acceptation of the whole Nation and he had the Treasury so full at the King's coming down to  Scotland  in that the Court were entertain'd with the greatest Magnificence imaginable out of the Profits of the Crown and it was observed by the  English  Nobility who attended the King in that Progress that his Majesty appear'd with no less Lusture at  HolyRoodHouse  than

Session Whether it was this or any other Act of Unkindness he met with from the Court I cannot say but 'tis certain upon the first Appearance of the Troubles in his Lordship being then Governor of  Edinburgh  Castle his Majesty did not seem to be absolutely satisfied of the Affection of the Earl to his Service and therefore removed him from that Command and put the Castle into the Hands of Major General Ruthven as a Person on whom he could firmly rely and yet his Majesty was willing that his Lordship's Remove might not be attended with any Act of Disobligation and therefore gave him  lib

Penreith  plunder'd the Country took and demolished the Fortresses of  Werk Ford  and  Cornwall  but after all these great and loyal Services to his Prince and Country he revolted to the  English  in the Time of  Robert  III the Occasion of which is thus delivered by our Historians  The King in Consideration of a great Sum of Money say they a Part of which he actually received had contracted his eldest Son the Prince to  Elizabeth Dunbar  the Earl of  March  's Daughter But  Archbald  Earl of  Douglas  having endeavoured all he could to obstruct the Marriage and having great Interest with the King at the Time prevailed with his Majesty to rescind the former Contract and to substitute the Lady  Marjory Douglas  his own Daughter in Place of  Elizabeth Dunbar  The Earl of  March  's high Spirit being unable to bear so signal Affront he therefore committed the Care of his Castle of  Dunbar  to Sir  Robert Maitland  of  Leidingtoun  his Nephew renounced his Allegiance to the Crown of

he meant to do nothing contrary to Law he appointed a Parliament to meet at  Perth  the th of  January  The next Day both the King as Pursuer and the Earl stiled Sir  George Dunbar  as Defendant compeared by their Procurators They for the Earl pled That his Father had been pardon'd by the Duke of  Albany  the supreme Magistrate for the Time but the Advocates for the King replied That the Power of restoring Exiles was never lodged in the Person of a Governor In the End after a long Debate the Parliament found and declared  Quod Ratione forisfacturae Domini  Georgii  de  Dunbar  quondam

call them Surnames not as if they were the Name of the Sire or Father but because they are superadded to the Christian Name The  Hebrews  to keep up the Memory of their Tribe in their Genealogies

was chosen to remonstrate against it and to apply to the Lords of Session for Redress in the ordinary Course of Justice which was so highly resented by the Council as an Act of Insolence and a

more than ordinary Zeal shown himself against a Popish Successor to the Crown which was the Sourse of all his Troubles and King  James  having made open Profession of  Popery he joined with the Earl of  Argyle  and came over with him in the Invasion but that Attempt being by the Providence of GOD overthrown and the Party dispersed Sir  Patrick  found Means to conceal himself in  Air  Shire for Three Weeks a Report being industriously spread abroad by his Friends that he was dead that the Search for him might be discontinued till a Vessel was provided for him on the  WestCoast  which in a few Days safely landed him at  Dublin  but not thinking it safe for him long to continue in  Ireland  for by this Time he was forfaulted and declared a Rebel he went over to  Holland  where he met with the same kind and generous Reception from the Prince of  Orange  as formerly tho' perhaps not so avowedly And there he continued to reside till the he came over with the Prince of  Orange  in his Expedition to  Britain  The Prince had so great an Esteem of his Sincerity to the Protestant Religion and of his Fidelity and Affection to his Highness's Design that he thought fit particularly to consult with Sir  Patrick  in that difficult Juncture And when the Government was dissolved upon King  James  's withdrawing into  France  Sir  Patrick Hume  was one of the most leading and forward in the Address from  Scotland  to the Prince of  Orange  to take upon him the Administration of Affairs both Civil and Military till a Meeting of the Estates should be call'd to settle the Nation which his Highness having call'd Sir  Patrick  was chosen a Member thereof for the Shire of  Berwick  wherein he became very instrumental in bringing about the Revolution and in procuring the Settling of the Crown on King  William  and Queen  Mary  Assoon as their Majesties came to constitute a Privy Council Sir  Patrick  was nam'd a Privy Councellor and appointed one of the Commissioners to treat of an Union betwixt the Two Nations and as a farther Mark of their Royal Favour he was raised to be a Peer of this Realm by the Title of Lord  Polwarth  of  Polwarth  on the th of  December  wherein their Majesties did express their great Esteem of Si  Patrick  's Services and Merit in the Preamble of his Patent in these Words  Quand  quidem nos grato admodum animo recolentes merita egregia

William  was pleased in the very Patent creating his Lordship into  the Honour to assign him an  Orange  proper ensign'd with an Imperial Crown to be placed in a  Su  tout  in his Arms in all Time coming as a lasting Mark of his Majesty's Royal Favour to the Family of  Polwarth  and in Commemoration of his Lordship's great Affection to his said Majesty a Warrant being directed to the Lord Lyon for that Effect And that his Lordship might have the more Interest in his own County and appear the more considerable there their Majesties King  William  and Queen  Mary  were pleased to constitute him Sheriff Principal of  Berwick  Shire on the d of  Octob  And to aggrandize him more and more he was named one of the Four Extraordinary Lords of the Session and took his Place accordingly the th of  November    Charra penes Comitem de Marchmont  But these Employments being mostly honorary that his Lordship might a little more effectually taste of the Royal Bounty his Majesty was pleased to prefer him to be Lord High Chancellor of  Scotland  on the d of  May    Ibidem  upon the Removal of the Marqui  of  Tweddale  and the Title of Lord Baron being thought too low a Degree of Honour for the Lord Chancellor before his Lordship had continued one whole Year in the Place his Majesty was pleased to augment his Honours and therefore advanced him to be an Earl by the Stile and Title of Earl of  Marchmont  Viscount of  Blassonberry  Lord  Polwarth  of  Polwarth Redbrays  and  Greenlaw  by Letters Patent d of  April    Ibidem  and the next ensuing Year was named High Comissioner to represent his Majesty's Person in Parliament and was likewise one of the Commissioners both of the Treasury and Admiralty After which he held the Chancellor's Place above Four Years with the universal Approbation of the whole Kingdom and the general Applause of all Men for his Justice Integrity sound Judgment and eminent Sufficiency in the Discharge of that Office a Praise which none of his Enemies ever denied him in any Time And the King his Master was so fully satisfied with his faithful Discharge of that and all the other great Employments committed to him while he was the first and prime Minister of State that he was pleased to give him a very ample Approbation of his Services under the Great Seal  April  th wherein his Majesty declared  Quod praefatus Comes in omnibus muneribus a nobis concreditis  andore integritate summa cum approbatione satisfactione nostra sese gessit exoneravit  In his Majesty was pleased to appoint the Lord Chancellor to be Commissioner to represent his Royal Person in the Assembly of the Church But during the Sitting of the Assembly King  William  died which did very sensibly affect his Lordship and all the hearty Lovers of the Revolution His Commission being determined by the Death of the King her Majesty Queen  Anne  the very Day she came to the Crown granted a new Commission to the Lord Chancellor to represent her Royal Person and hold her Place in the Assembly In the End of her Majesty having made some Alterations in the Ministry the Earl of  March  ont  was removed from being Chancellor to which Office the Earl of  Seafield  was preferred But his Remove did not in the least diminish his Lordship's Zeal for what he thought the Interest of his Country but rather  eightned his publick Spirit for having always most at Heart the Security of the Protestant Religion and a Successor  to the Crown of that Religion in the first Parliament after the Queen's coming to the Crown the Earl was the first who proposed an Overture for settling the Succession to the Crown on the Princess  Sophia  Dutchess Dowager of  Hanover  and the Heirs of her Body being Protestants in Default of Issue of her Majesty Queen  Anne  and at the same Time presented another Act for securing and settling the Presbyterian Government in Doctrine and Worship as being most agreeable to the Word of GOD But tho' the first Overture did not at that Time take the Parliament having a View of an Union with  England  yet the last carried and was approved by a great Majority And when the Treaty of Union came before the Parliament his Lordship there as well as in the Commission of the General Assembly of the Church us'd his utmost Endeavours to have it brought about as the only Means he thought could secure Religion and establish a firm and lasting Peace betwixt the Two Nations a Protestant Successor to the Crown being thereby secured which was the Thing his Lordship long'd most passionately to see before he should leave this World And when that Settlement took Place by the Accession of King  George  to the Throne his Majesty was pleased to restore the Earl to be Sheriff of  Berwick  Shire on the th of  November  in the Room of the Earl of

ACcording to our Historians this noble ancient Family derives its Origin from a certain brave Man who signaliz'd himself in the Battle of  Barry  against the  Danes  in the Reign of King  Malcolm  II where  Camus  the  Danish  General was slain  Hist Scot  His noble Services were rewarded by that Prince with the Barony of  Keith  in  Lothian  from whence his Posterity took their Surname and either he or some of the first who descended from him were dignified with the hereditary Title and Office of Marischal of  Scotland  for we don't find by our History  or any other Document that this Office

gloriously redeemed his Country from Slavery and Usurpation King  Robert  had a great Value and Esteem of Sir  Robert Kieth  insomuch as in he sent him Ambassador together with the E of  Murray  to

Honour and Fidelity  In the when a Rising toward a Rebellion was threatned in the Northern Parts His Majesty named the Earl Marischal his Lieutenant with a Power to raise what Forces he should judge necessary for that Service and he behav'd so well throughout the whole Affair that he intirely suppress'd the Insurrection without the Effusion of one Drop of Blood which made his pacifick Master very much applaud and commend his Conduct The same Year his Lordship made a noble Foundation of a College at  Aberdeen  Middleton's Appendix to Bishop Spotiswood's History  which he indued with sufficient Funds toward the Support and Maintenance of a Principal and Three Professors of Philosophy and tho'other Professors have been since added by the Piety and Bounty of other great and learned Men yet the

MELVIL Earl of  Melvil  IF Tradition may be credited the  Melvils  are as ancient in  Scotland  as the Reign of King  Malcolm  III that a Gentleman from  Hungary  accompanied Queen  Margaret  the Wife of that Prince into this Realm where he got Lands in  Lothian  which he call'd  Melvil  after his own Name and there fixed his Residence But be this as it will it appears from Writs I have seen the  Melvils  were very considerable in the Time of King  William  both for the many Lands they enjoyed and the great Offices they held under the Crown  Galfred de Malevile  in that Reign gave the Church of  Malevile  to the Monks of  Dunfermling cum  tota illa Terra quam eidem Feclesiae assig navit in Dedicatione coram  Hugone  Episcopo  Sanctae Andreae  Chartulary of Dunfermling And 'tis to be remarked That this Hugh Bishop of St Andrews was by King William promoted to the Episcopal See soon after the Year and died And further 'tis worth taking Notice of that some Families Abroad in Foreign Parts particularly in Hungary still carry the Surname of Malevile and give a Coat of Arms much the same with the Earl of Melvil  viz  Gules  Three Crescents  Argent  within a Border charged with Eight

Balgony  Geneal of the House of Raith  by whom he had a Son  John  and a Daughter  Margaret  married to  James Bonnar  of  Rossie  Which  John  was made a Knight by King  James  IV with whom he lost his Life at the Battle of  Flowdoun  th  September  leaving Issue by  Margaret  his Wife Daughter of  William Bonnar  of  Rossie  John  his Son and Heir who had the Honour particularly to be known and favour'd by King  James  V For the King finding him a Person of Wisdom and Integrity made him General of the Ordnance  Charta in Pub Arch ad annum  and Captain of his Majesty's Castle of  Dunbar  Melvil's Memoirs  and a Knight and to the very Hour of his Death prosecuted him with all Manner of Kindness and Respect This worthy Man was among the first of Note in those Parts who embraced and favoured the Reformed Religion which made him the Object of the Hatred and Malice of the  Romish  Clergy Bishop  Beaton  of  St Andrews  and Mr  Durie  the Abbot of  Dunfermling  his Neighbours did particularly own it The Bishop accused him before the King of Heresy at least a Favourer of  Luther  's Doctrine which as the Times went could not fail of being penal to him if the King who had a particular Favour to Sir  John Melvil  had not interpos'd and sav'd him from their further Prosecution But the wicked Bishop did not rest here for what he could not effect in Course of Law he intended to execute by a barbarous Assassination having for that  End hired some Villains to intercept and murder Sir  John  in the Way as he rode Home to his own House But by the good Providence of Almighty GOD and the Courage and Fidelity of his own Servants and Retainers who were very  umerous the Design was prevented But what Bishop  Beaton  could not bring to pass his Successor Bishop  Hamilton  effected on Pretence of a treasonable Correspondence with the Nation's Enemies abroad and the Matter was thus In the Minority of Queen  Mary  a War breaking out betwixt  Scotland  and  England  upon the Breach of the MarriageArticles that had been agreed on betwixt  Edward  Prince of  Wales  and Queen  Mary  whereupon all Correspondence betwixt the Two Nations was forbid upon the highest Penalties And it happening that Sir  John Melvil  having before that sent his eldest Son to  England  for the Improvement of his Education after the War broke out he wrote to him wherein the good old Man admonished his Son to live and demean himself as became a Christian and a Gentleman without any Thing relating to a treasonable Correspondence or Intelligence as was pretended but the Letter being intercepted was brought to the Bishop of St  Andrews  and his Interest being th  n superior to any Man's with his Brother the Earl of  Aran  the Governor Sir  John  was suddenly seised and sent Prisoner under a strong Guard to  St  rling  and it being resolved he should be cut off in a seeming Way of Justice an Indictment of High Treason was prepared against him and Care being taken before by his Accuser the Bishop to provide Witnesses to prove the Charge he was found Guilty and condemn'd to lose his Head which was accordingly executed on him in the End of the Year Nor did Bishop  Hamilton  's Malice abate toward him after his Death for they seised on his Estate dispossessed his Lady and Children with all the Circumstances of Barbarity Malice could invent and never left persecuting his Family till they had reduced it to the lowest Penury and Want by disposing and giving away all the Fortune that should have supported them But they were under the Care of a higher Hand for the Almighty ordered Matters so that all the younger Children were better provided for than they could have been by their Father if he had been alive as Sir  John  himself had  oretold his Lady to comfort her under the disconsolate Circumstances of his Death By  Helen  his Wife Daughter of  Alexander Napter  of  Merchistoun  Ancestor to the Lord  Napier  he had  John  his eldest Son thereafter

this Honour I'm to speak of him more particularly He was by the Care of his Mother well brought up and for his further Improvement at a proper Age was sent abroad to travel which he did into Foreign Parts where he spent divers Years  After which he betook himself to the Court of  France  where he was much taken Notice of for his prudent and generous Behaviour insomuch as  Henry  II soon placed him in his Service in a very honourable Station in which he continued many Years to his Master's great Satisfaction  Upon his Return to  Scotland  his known great Parts and the very good general Reputation he had acquired inclined Queen  Mary  to call him to her PrivyCouncil and to send him Ambassador to  England Anno  and he discharged his Trust with Prudence and Dexterity insomuch as when King  James  VI came to act by himself his Majesty sent Sir  Robert  Ambassador to  England  in Conjunction with the Master of  Gray  to inte  pose with Queen  Elis  beth  in Behalf of Queen  Mary  that the Sentence of Death which was passed on her might not be put in Execution where says my Author  Sir James Melvil's Memoirs    He spoke such brave and st  t Language before the Council of  England  that the Queen threatned his Life and would have retained him Captive had not the Master of  Gray  's Interest prevented it who was his Collegue  But as this faithful Discharge of his Trust did and alwise will reflect Honour on his Memory so it endeared him very much to King  James  who reposing great Confidence in Sir  Rob  rt  named him ViceChancellor of  Scotland  when the Chancellor the Lord  Thir  stane  was abroad in  Denmark  negotiating the King's Marriage made him also TreasurerDepute and a Lord of the Session and last of all to reward his Merit and Services made him a P  er

Gracefulness of his Person particularly by the Queen Mother who carrying a singular Favour and Affection toward him insomuch as she was pleased to do him the Honour to marry him and then got him made a Peer by the Title of Lord  Methven Anno    Drummond's History of King James V  from a Barony in the County  of  Perth  then dissolved from the Crown and erected in a Lordship to him and his Heirs Male upon the Queen's resigning her Join  ure of the Lordship of  Stirling  Mr Baillie of Castlecarry's Notes upon Dalrymple's Edition of Camden  But by her Majesty his Lordship had no Child save one

were born him by Queen  Margaret  who was Daughter of  Henry  VII of  England  and have of late improv'd it so far as to alledge that this was one of the Motives of the Death of  John  Earl of  Gowrie  at  Perth  th of  August  because he stood in an equal Degree of Relation in Blood with King  James  VI to the Crown of  England  But this being now known and own'd as a Mistake I need not inlarge much upon disproving what has been said upon that Subject But to put the Matter beyond Dispute I have seen MarriageArticles betwixt Sir  Colin Campbel  Son to  Archbald  Earl of  Argyle  and who was thereafter Earl him self and  Janet Stewart  Daughter of  Henry  Lord  Methven  wherein her Mother  Janet Stewart  Mistress of  Sutherland  Spouse to  Henry  Lord  Methven  is expresly mentioned as a

Countess of  Gowrie  the Lord  Methven  's Daughter were performed in the most solemn Manner upon the Eschutcheons of his maternal Line the Arms of the Earl of  Athole  were placed as the Father of the Lady  Methven  which appears from the printed Account of the Marquis's Funerals And 'tis not to be imagined if this illustrious Person had been descended of the Royal Family of  England  that such a great Mistake would have been committed as to have placed the Arms of the House of  Athole  instead of the Royal Arms of  England  at his Obscquies where the outmost Care and Charge was bestowed to perform them with all imaginable State and Solemnity So it would appear this Story has been the Invention of later Years  MENTETH Earl of  Menteth  THE Country of  Menteth  had Earls very early In the

Appearance in Behalf of King  Robert the Bruce  whose great Favourite he afterward became  Alexander  Earl of  Menteth  was a strenuous Asserter of the Honour Freedom and Independency of his Country in the Time of the War with the  English  under  Edward  I which will derive his Name down to latest Posterity as a Patriot of his Country By  Matilda  his Wife he left Three Sons  Allan  and  Murdack

when his Majesty began more narrowly to inquire into his Royal Patrimony it was found that tho' both this  Maliss  and his Mother had used the Title of Earl and Countess of  Strathern  yet they had no other Right to it than a  e  r Connivence of the Governors in the Absence and Minority of the King in Respect that King  Robert  II had given that Earldom to his Son  David  and his Heirs Male

his eldest Son and Heir acquired the Lands of Gartmore from John Alexander  Esq  the Earl of Stirling's Son who had married the Heir Female of that House whence he took his Title and Designation He

Cromwel the Earl of Airth being then infirm and not able by Reason of his Age to lead out his Men his Lordship reposed so much Confidence in Gartmore's Loyalty and Sufficiency that he directed a Commission to his well beloved Cousin William Graham of Gartmore to call together and command all the Earl's sencible Men whenever he should judge it necessary for the Service of the Country And his Majesty King Charles II placed so great Confidence in Gartmore's Loyalty and Affection to his Service that on the th of July he gave him a Commission to guard the Passes on the River of Forth and to apprehend and secure all Deserters from the Army And he discharged the Trust reposed in him with such Fidelity and Diligence that William Duke of Hamilton wrote him a Letter of Thanks in the King's

and Sufficiency But while his Lordship was in the Height of his Greatness and very much in the King's Favour he serv'd himself Heir to his Ancestor  David  Earl of  Strathern  and thereupon applied to his Majesty to have that Title confer'd upon him and the King without considering any Inconveniency that might attend that Creation gave him a Patent ratifying and approving him in that Dignity But 'tis reported being very much exalted with that Title his Vanity was not a little supported with the general Error of our Historians of  David  Earl of  Strathern  's being the eldest Son of King  Robert  II's first Marriage with  Eupham Ross  his Queen and some high Expressions in Reference to his Right to the Crown having inadvertently dropt from the Earl the Matter came to be talk'd at Court

Reduction of his Title whereby he was not only deprived of the Title of Earl of  Strathern  but also of that of  Menteth  But his Majesty was graciously pleased soon thereafter to make him Earl of

Which  William  having no Issue of his Body convoy'd his Estate to  James  then Marquis now Duke of  Montrose  and died on the th of  September    MIDDLETON Earl of  Middleton  OF this Ancient Family

John Middleton  of  Middleton  disposed of the Lands of  Middleton  to  David Falconar  of  Halkerton  after which his Successors I think went by the Title and Designation of  Cadham  in the County foresaid  Lieutenant General  John Middleton  was the Son of  John Middleton  of  Cadham  by  Helen  his Wife Daughter of  John Strachan  of the Family of  Thornton  who being bred a Scholar intended to have made his Fortune that Way but the Civil War breaking out he laid aside that Resolution and betaking himself to the Profession of Arms engaged in the Service of the  English  Parliament where the Eminency of his Courage made him so much taken Notice of when he was not above the Degree of a Captain of a Troop of Horse that by the Time Sir  William Waller  was sent with an Army into the West of  England  distinct from the other commanded by the Earl of  Essex  Captain  Middleton  was made his Lieutenant General  Clarendon's History of the Rebellion  and he continued in that Service with singular Reputation till the Parliament cashier'd the Earl of  Essex  and made their new Model he quit all Command there and betook himself to the Service of the Estates of  Scotland  where he gave frequent Testimonies of signal Courage and Valour in several Actions insomuch as when the Parliament  Anno  rais'd an Army for the Rescue of the King upon his being made Prisoner in the Isle of  Wight  he was appointed Lieutenant General of the Horse and at the Battle of  Preston  he maintained a Dispute with the Enemy with great Courage and with very great Loss to them for several Hours  Memoirs of John first Earl of Middleton MS  till losing his Horse he had the ill Fortune to be taken Prisoner and sent to  Newcastle  Ludlow's Memoirs  where he continued till after the Murder of the King he found Means to corrupt the Marshal who had the Keeping of him and made his Escape into  Scotland  by the Time K  Charles  II arrived in this Kingdom where he was received by his Friends with great Joy to whom such a brave Officer and of such intire Affections to his Majesty could not at such a Season but be very acceptable and when the Parliament had raised another Army to march into  England  with the King  Clarendon  whereof his Majesty himself was General Lieutenant General  Middleton  had the Command of the Horse and at the Fight of  Worcester  d of  September  at that Part where  Middleton  commanded there was a very brave Resistance made and he charged the Enemy so vigorously that he beat that Body that charged them back in great Disorder and with great Loss  Ibidem  But in the Action he received several Wounds whereby he fell into the Enemy's Hands and assoon as he was fit to be removed was sent Prisoner to the Tower of  London  Ibidem  and destin'd to be sacrificed by  Cromwel  against whom he thought he might more warrantably proceed than against any other of the  Scots  Prisoners because he had heretofore in the Beginning of the War serv'd the Parliament and to that Purpose he erected a high Court of Justice for the Tryal of some Persons that had been troublesom to him especially MajorGeneral  Middleton  And the Time approaching that he was to be try'd his Friends in  London  gave him so good and so particular Advertisement that he ma  his Escape and after he had co  c  aled himself there a Fortnight or Three Weeks that the Diligence of the first Examination and Enquiry was over he had the good Fortune to get himself safely transported over to  France  and came to the King to  Parts  to the Grief and Vexation of the very Soul of  Cromwel  who earnestly thirsted after the Blood of this noble Person  Lieutenant General  Middleton  continued to attend on the King till the his Majesty being importun'd by many Exp  esses as well from the  Scots  Lords who were Prisoners in  England  as from those who were at Liberty that Lieutenant General  Middleton  might be sent over to the  Highlands  with his Majesty's Commission and with some Supply of Arms and that by the next Spring they would have an Army ready strong enough to meet with General  Monk  and tho' the King did not says the Lord  Clarendon  expect that any notable Service would be performed by his Friends in  Scotland  for his Advantage or their own Redemption yet did not think fit to seem to undervalue the Professions and Overtu  es of those who had during his being among them made all Professions of Duty to him and therefore gave such a Commission and Instructions to the Lieutenant General as were necessary and dispatched him to  Scotland  where he arrived with some few Officers and such a Supply of Arms and Ammunition as could be got upon his own Credit and Activity in the Winter of the Year when the Earl of  Glencairn  delivered up the Command of the Troops to him and he continued at the Head of them for a whole Year thereafter but never getting  any Supplies from Abroad he was at length totally routed and suppress'd by General  Monk  after which he found Shelter in some honest Mens Houses where he was conceal'd till Opportunity serv'd to transport him beyond Sea that he came to the King at  Cologn  and attended his Majesty's Fortune throughout the rest of the Exile  Upon the Restoration his Majesty in Commemoration of the long and faithful Services of General  Middleton  was pleased to raise him to the Degree of an Earl by the Title of Earl of  Middleton  by Letters Patent bearing Date st of  October    Charta in Rotulis Caroli II  made him Commander in Chief of his Majesty's Forces in  Scotland  Governor of  Edinburgh  Castle one of the Lords of his Majesty's most Honourable PrivyCouncil and appointed him Lord High Commissioner to the st and d Sessions of the Parliament and But being impatient to be the sole Favourite in his last Session of Parliament he procured an Act to pass by which certain Persons were to be incapacitated from all Offices of Honour or Trust and that by a very new and unheard of Way of Billoting By which Act the Secretary of State the Earl of  Lauderdale  the Treasurer the Earl of  Crawfurd  the JusticeClerk Sir  Robert Murray  and Others who had given very signal Testimony of their Affection and Fidelity to the King were particularly levell'd at But his Majesty finding the Earl had very far exceeded the Limits of his Commission in the framing and passing of that Act and that it was highly derogatory to his Majesty's Justice and innate Goodness he had such a deep Resentment of the Indignity that he gave Orders to reseind the Act of Billoting and it fell heavy on the Earl himself for he was immediately removed from all the Offices he held under the Crown the Castle of  Edinburgh  was given to the Earl of  Lauderdale  and the Command of the Forces to the Earl of  Rothes  who had contributed very much to his Overthrow But his Majesty calling to Mind the great Merit and Services of the Earl of  Middleton  during the Exile thought it improper he should be dismiss'd with any further Marks of the Royal Displeasure and therefore that he might be out of the Way and never more in a Condition to compete with or controul the Earl of  Lauderdale  who had the Ascendant of the other in the King's Affections he was made Governor of the new  English  Fort of  Tangier  in  Africa  which was little other than a more decent Exile there he liv'd till the Death overtook him in that remote Corner of the World where his Body was committed to its Rest He married first  Grisel  Daughter of  Durham  of  Pi  kar    Sister to Sir  Alexander Durham  of  Large  and again  Martha  Daughter of  Henry  Earl of  Monmouth  Dugdale's Baronage of England  By his first Wife he had  Charles  his Son and Heir and Two Daughters  Helen  married to  Patrick  Earl of  Strathmore  and  Grisel  to  William  Earl of  Morton  Which  Charles  was bred up at the Court of King  Charles  II But whether he had any Preferment there before the I cannot take upon me to determine But at that

Napier Dorothea  to  James  first Lord  Rollo Beatrix  to  David  Lord  Maderty  James  Earl afternam'd Marquis of  Montrose  was born in the having had the Misfortune to lose his Father when he was young and being I think the only Son of the Family his Friends in order to raise up Heirs to his illustrious House prevail'd with him when he was but a Youth to marry which he did into a very noble Family This Marriage broke off the Course and gave a great Interruption to his Studies but quickly finding the Loss he should sustain if he did not go thro' with his Education he got good Masters at Home and enter'd into a close Course of Study wherein he made so great a Proficiency and Progress that in a very little Time he became not only a great Master but a Critick in the  Greek  and  Latin  after which for his greater Improvement and giving an Ornament to his hopeful Person he travel'd into Foreign Parts where he spent some Years in attaining the Language and in learning the Exercises then in Vogue in which he excel'd most Men and came over to  England  by the Time he was Twenty two Years of Age  He then betook himself to the Court intending to live there in a View of serving the Crown and of raising himself to those Honours and Imployments  both his Birth and personal Qualifications did intitle him to but in his Attendance there meeting with some Discountenance of the King which was very artfully brought about he left the Court and returning to  Scotland  just before the breaking out of the Troubles he joined with the discontented Party who appeared most forward for the Redress of Grievances of the Church which was all that was at that Time pretended insomuch as he soon became one of the principal and most active Lords for the Covenant and Reformation But after the first Expedition of the Covenanters into  England  the Earl upon his Observation of the unwarrantable Prosecution of the Ends of the Covenant he gave over that Party and his Command in the Army and made a full Tender of his Service to his Majesty which brought him so much into the Jealousy of the Party he had formerly been of that there was no Room left to doubt of his Sincerity to the King The Earl of  Clarendon  does very unjustly insinuate in his History of the Civil War that while the King was in  Scotland  the Earl of  Montrose  offer'd to make away Two Great Men he thinks were not so cordial in the King's Interest as could have been wish'd but as this Calumny is most false as I am fully able from Original Writs and Papers to justify him from that Aspersion so I shall offer no more here for his Vindication but to declare to the World and which I'm able to demonstrate that the Marquis of  Montrose  was a Prisoner in the Castle of  Edinburgh  for corresponding with the King from the Month of  June  till  January  thereafter and the King came down in  August  and returned in  November  so 'tis clear he was a Prisoner all the while his Majesty was in  Scotland  Original Instructions of all this I have had the Honour to peruse in the Duke of Montrose's Custody  After his Releasment he liv'd most part privately at his Seat in the Country till the Meeting of the Convention he privately withdrew out of  Scotland  and came to the King a few Days before the Siege was rais'd from  Glocester  and gave his Majesty the first clear Information of the Proceedings of the Convention of the Resolutions would be there taken and of the Posture the Kingdom would speedily be in and made some Propositions to the King for the Remedy which there was not says the Earl of  Clarendon  then Time to consult of But assoon as his Majesty return'd to  Oxford  after the Battle of  Newburry  he was very willing to hearken to any Overture the Earl should make in Reference to what could be done to prevent the Mischief was like to ensue to his Majesty's Affairs by a Combination betwixt the  Scots  Covenanters and the  English  Parliament wherefore that his Majesty might have this important Affair brought to a full Resolution he was pleas'd to hold several Conferences with the Earl But all the Advances which were made toward the Execution of any Attempt for the King's Service were check'd by his Majesty's not being able to give any Troops to the Earl by the Protection whereof the Loyal Party of the Kingdom might come to his Assistance and discover their Affections to his Majesty notwithstanding of which the vigorous Spirit of the Earl of  Montrose  stirred him up to make some Attempt which he thought might be of Service to the King And therefore proposed that his Majesty should give a Command to the Earl of  Antrim  to raise and send over a Body of Two Thousand Men into the Highlands of  Scotland  to be a Foundation for raising Forces there and that if his Majesty would grant him a Commission to command that Army he would himself be in the  Highlands  to receive them and run his Fortune with them and that if no Time were lost in prosecuting that Design he did hope  that by the Time the  Scots  Army should be ready to take the Field they should receive such an Alarm from their own Country as should hinder their Advance into  England  Clarendon's History of the Rebellion  Upon this Overture the King conser'd with the Two Lords and finding the Earl of  Antrim  forward to undertake the raising as many Men as should be desir'd his Majesty resolv'd to encourage it all he could and therefore that the Earl of  Montrose  might depart with the better Character and Testimony of his Ma+jesty▪s Favour and good Opinion and be thereby the better qualified to per form the great Trust reposed in him his Majesty was pleased to give Order for a Warrant to make the Earl Marquis of  Montrose  Charta penes Ducem de Montrose data May  and gave him a Commission constituting his Lordship CaptainGeneral and Commander in Chief of all the Forces to be rais'd in  Scotland  for his Majesty's Service and so taking his Leave of the King accompany'd with several Gentlemen he began his Journey as if he meant to make his Way in Company with them into  Scotland  but after he had continued his Journey two or three Days in that Equipage which he knew could be no Secret and that it would draw the Enemies Troops together for the Guard of all Passes to meet with him the Marquis was found missing one Morning by his Company who after some Stay and Enquiry returned back to  Oxford  whilst this noble Person with incredible Address and Fatigue had not only quitted his Company and his Servants but his Horse also and found a safe Passage most Part on Foot thro' all the Enemies Quarters till he came to the very Borders  Clarendon  from whence by the Assistance of Friends whom he trusted he found himself secure in the Border of the  Highlands  with his most faithful Friend the Laird of  Inchbrackie  Guthry's Memoirs  where he lay quiet without undertaking any Action until the Earl of  Antrim  did make good so much of his Undertaking that he sent over Colonel  Alexander M  Donald  with a Regiment of Fifteen Hundred Soldiers who landed in the  Highlands  at or near the Place that had been agreed on  Bishop Wishart's Memoirs of the Marquis of Montrose  where the Marquis was ready to receive him which he did with great Joy and quickly published his Commission of being General for the King over all the Kingdom  With this Handful of Men thus brought together with those Circumstances he brought in so many of his Countrymen to join with him as were soon strong enough to arm themselves at the Charge of their Enemies whom they first defeated and every Day encreased in Power till he fought and prevailed in the several Battles of  Tippermuir Alfuird Aldearn Aberdeen Inverlochy  and  Kilsyth  that he made himself in little more than one Year upon the Matter Master of the Kingdom and did all those stupenduous Acts which are deservedly the Subject of a History excellently written in  Latin  by Dr  George Wishart  thereafter Bishop of  Edinburgh  tho' very ill translated since by an unknown Hand  After the Battle of  Kilsyth  his Excellency the Marquis mareh'd Eastward took the City of  Edinbutgh  The Bishop of Dunkeld's Memoirs  and advancing his Course toward  England  he was unexpectedly attack'd by Major General  David Lesly  with the whole Strength of the  Scots  Horse at  Philiphaugh  on the th of  September    Bishop Guthry's Memoirs  where he was totally defeated so that his future Triumph  was not only prevented but he was compel'd with great Loss to retire again to the  Highlands  for recruiting of his Army in which he had wonderfully succeeded when he received his Majesty's positive Orders while he was in the Hands of the  Scots  Army before  Newark  to lay down his Arms by a certain Day prefixed and to leave the Kingdom  Lord C  rendon's History  till when they pretended they could no  declare for his Majesty and this was done with so much Earnestness and by a particular Messenger known and trusted that the Marquis obey'd and transported himself into  France  toward the End of the Year  Bishop Wishart's Memoirs of the Marquis of Montrose Clarendon  where he did for some Time reside and took the Opportunity while he attended at that Court to make some Overtures to Cardinal  Mazerine  to raise any Army for the Service of the King which the crafty Cardinal did not receive says the Lord  Clarendon  with that Regard the Marquis's great Name deserv'd Thereupon his Excellency left  France  and made a Journey into  Germany  to the Emperor's Court and thence to  Brussels  where he lay privately and as  incognito  for some Time till he hear'd of the Murther of the King that he came to the  Hague  and presented himself to King  Charles  II with the Tender of his Service  c  and his Majesty received him with a very good Countenance and as a most gracious Testimony of his great Fidelity and Merit presented him with the Ensigns of the most noble Order of the Garter  While the King remained at the  Hague  there were at this Time beside the Marquis of  Montrose  and those of the Nobility who adhered to him the Commissioners who came from the Council and the Kirk to invite his Majesty into  Scotland  and the Duke of  Hamilton  and others of the Nobility who joined with him and tho' there was nothing the King wished more than that some Expedient might be found out to unite all those Parties especially that there might be an Union and Reconciliation betwixt  Mentrose  and the  Ha  iltonion  Faction who had an equal Desire to serve the King and were as much persecuted by the Party who then govern'd as the Marquis was yet the Animosity of each of them was such against him that they were equally his implacable Enemies insomuch as they did not only refuse to meet with him but assoon as he came into the Room where they were tho' his Majesty himself was present they immediately withdrew and left the Room  Ibidem  and desir'd that the Marquis whom they call'd  James Graham  might be forbidden to come into his Majesty's Presence because he stood excommunicated by the Kirk and degraded and forfaulted by the Judicatory of the Kingdom With which Demand his Majesty declared his being very much offended which he made manifest by using the Marquis with the more Countenance and in holding the more frequent Conferences with him  But when the Marquis clearly perceived that it was not possible that the Lords of the other Parties would ever unite with him and that his Attendance on the King might possibly bring some Prejudice to his Service he therefore propos'd that his Majesty would give him Letters and Credentials to several Princes in  Germany  and to the Northern Crowns by which he might appear Ambassador Extraordinary from the King if he should find it expedient to the End he might by the Help of these Princes obtain the Loan of Monies Arms and Ammunition to enable him  to prosecute his intended Descent into  Scotland  and the King says my Author the Earl of  Clarendon  glad that he did not press for ready Money which he was not able to supply him with gave him such Letters as he desir'd and a Commission to gather such a Force together as by the Help of those Princes he might be enabled to do Upon which the Marquis went for  Hamburgh  which he appointed for the Rendezvous for all those Troops which he expected from  Germany  and from whence he could in the mean Time visit such Courts of the Neighbour Princes as he should be encouraged to do and keep such Intelligence with his Friends in  Scotland  as should provide for his Reception In a Word he sent or went in Person both to  Sweden  and  Denmark  where he found the Performance very disproportionable to the Hopes and Encouragement he had received from thence so that the Marquis was obliged to return to  Hamburgh  with very small Supplies from either or both these Kingdoms and there he received no better Account from those Officers whom he had sent to  Germany  and therefore concluding upon the Whole that all his Hopes from  Germany  and those Northern Princes would not increase the Strength he had already which did not amount to above Five Hundred he caus'd those Soldiers he had drawn together to be imbark'd for  Scotland  and sent Officers with them who knew the Country with Directions that they should land in such a Place and remain there till he came to them or sent them Orders and then in another Vessel commanded by a Captain very faithful to the King he embarked himself and near an Hundred Officers and landed in another Creek not far from the other Place whither his Soldiers were directed and both the one and the other Party were set safely on Shore in the  Orkneys  on the th of  April    Memoirs of the Marquis of Montrose  from thence he came over to  Caithness  History of the Revolutions in England by a French Clergyman where Montrose's Expedition is particularly narrated  and presently repair'd to the House of a Gentleman of Quality with whom he corresponded by whom he was well received and thought himself to be in Security till he might put his Affairs in some Method After he had staid there a short Time he quickly possess'd himself of an old Castle which in Respect of the Situation in a Country so impossible for an Army to march in thought strong enough for his Purpose Thither he convoy'd the Arms Ammunition and Troops which he had brought with him and then he published his Declaration  That he came with the King's Commission to assist those his good Subjects and to preserve them from Oppression That he did not intend to give any Interruption to the Treaty that he hear'd was enter'd into with his Majesty but on the contrary hoped that his being in the Head of an Army how small soever that was faithful to the King might advance the same However he had given sufficient Proof in his former Actions that if any Agreement were made with the King upon the first Order from his Majesty he should lay down his Arms and dispose himself according to his Majesty's good Pleasure  With these Declarations which he sent to his Friends to be scatter'd by them and dispersed among the People as they could be able he writ likewise to those of the Nobility and the principal Heads of the  Highland  Clans to draw such Forces together as they thought necessary to join with him and he received Answers from many of them by which they desir'd him to advance more into the LowLands  and assured him that they would resort to him with good Numbers of their Friends and Followers which many of them did prepare to do with great Sincerity  The Alarm of  Montrose  's Landing startled the Parliament which was then sitting at  Edinburgh  in so much that it gave them no Leisure to think of any Thing else than of sending Forces to hinder the Recourse of others to join with him and therefore sent Colonel  Strachan  with a choice Party of the best Horse they had to make all possible Haste toward him and to prevent the Insurrections which they feared would be in several Parts of the  Highlands  and within few Days after Lieutenant General  Lesly  followed with a stronger Party of Horse and Foot The Encouragement the Marquis received from his Friends and the Unpleasantness of the Quarters in which he was prevail'd with him to march with these few Troops more into the Land and the  Highlanders  flocking to him from all Quarters made him undervalue any Enemy who he thought was yet like to encounter him and the Marquis being without any Body of Horse to discover the Mo+tion of an Enemy but depending upon all necessary Intelligence from the Affections of the People  Strachan  made such Haste toward him that he was within a small Distance of him before he heard of his Approach and those  Highlanders  who had seem'd to come with much Zeal to him whether terrified or corrupted left him on a sudden or threw down their Arms so that he had none left but a Company of good Officers and Five or Six Hundred Foreigners  Dutch  and  Germans  with these he betook himself to a Place of some Advantage by the Inequality of the Ground and there they made a Defence for some Time with notable Courage but the Enemy being so much superior in Number the common Soldiers being all Foreigners after about a Hundred of them were kill'd upon the Place threw down their Arms And the Marquis seeing all lost threw away his Ribband and  George  and found Means to change his Clothes with a Fellow of the Country and so after having gone on Foot Two or Three Miles he got into a House of a Gentleman  M'Leod  of  Assint  Mercurius Politicus ad Annum  where he remain'd conceal'd about Two Days but whether by the Owner of the House or any other Way the Marquis was discovered and became their Prisoner and was the next Day or soon thereafter delivered to the General who was come up with his Forces and had now nothing left to do but to carry him in Triumph to  Edinburgh  When he came to one of the Gates of  Edinburgh  he was met by some of the Magistrates to whom he was delivered and by them presently put into a new Cart purposely made in which there was a high Chair or Bench upon which he sat that the People might have a full View of him being bound with a Cord drawn over his Breast and Shoulders and fasten'd thro' Holes made in the Cart When he was in this Posture the Hangman took off his Hat and rode himself before the Cart in his Livery and with his Bonnet on the other Officers who were taken Prisoners with him walking Two and Two before the Cart in this Manner he was carried to the common Goal and received and treated as a common Malefactor  Within Two Days after he was brought before the Parliament where the Chancellor made a very bitter  and virulent Speech against him told him  He had broken all the Covenants by which the Nation stood obliged and had impiously rebelled against GOD the King and the Kingdom that he had committed many horrible Murthers Treasons and Impieties for all which he was now brought to suffer condign Punishment  with all those Reproaches says my Author against his Person and his Actions which the Liberty of that Place gave him Leave to use  Permission was then given him to speak and without the least Trouble in his Countenance or Disorder upon all the Indignities he had suffer'd he told them  Since the King had own'd them  o far as to treat with them he had appear'd before them with Reverence and bare headed which otherwise he would not willingly have done That he had done nothing of which he was asham'd or had Cause to repent that the first Covenant he had taken and comply'd with it and with them who took it as long as the Ends for which it was ordain'd were observ'd but when he discover'd which was now evident to all the World that private and particular Men design'd to satisfy their own Ambition and Interest instead of considering the Publick Benefit and that under the Pretence of reforming some Errors in Religion they resolv'd to abridge and take away the King's just Power and lawful Authority he had withdrawn himself from that Engagement That for the League and Covenant he had never taken it and therefore could not break it And it was now too apparent to the whole Christian World what monstruous Mischiefs it had produced That when under Colour of it an Army from  Scotland  had invaded  England  in Assistance of the Rebellion that was then against their Lawful King he had by his Majesty's Command received a Commission from him to raise Forces in  Scotland  that he might thereby divert them from the other odious Persecution That he had executed that Commission with the Obedience and Duty he ow'd to the King and in all the Circumstances of it had proceeded like a Gentleman and had never suffer'd any Blood to be shed but in the Heat of the Battle and that he saw many Persons there whose Lives he had saved that when the King commanded him he laid down his Arms and withdrew out of the Kingdom which they could not have compell'd him to have done  He said  he was now again enter'd into the Kingdom by his Majesty's Command and with his Authority And what Success soever it might have pleased GOD to have given him he would always have obeyed any Commands he should have received from him  He advised them  to consider well of the Consequence before they proceeded against him and that all his Actions might be examin'd and judged by the Laws of the Land or those of Nations  Assoon as he had ended his Discourse he was ordered to withdraw and after a short Space was again brought in and told by the Chancellor  That he was on the Morrow being the one and Twentieth of  May  to be carried to  Edinburgh  Cross and there to be hanged up on a Gallows Thirty Foot high for the Space of Three Hours and then to be taken down and his Head to be cut off upon a Scoffold and hanged on  Edinburgh  Tolboth his Legs and Arms to be hanged up in other publick Towns of the Kingdom and his Body to be buried at the Place where he was to be executed except the Kirk should take off his Excommunication and then his Body might be buried in the common Place of Burial  And 'tis admirable to consider with what Magnanimity Firmness of Soul he heard the Judgment that condemned him to be quartered concerning which he said to the Chancellor that pronounced it  That he was prouder to have his Head set upon the Place it was appointed to be than he could have been to have had his Picture hang in the King's BedChamber That he was so far from being troubled that his Four  Limbs were to be hang'd in Four principal Cities of the Kingdom that he heartily wished he had Flesh enough to be sent to every City in  Christendom  as a Testimony of the Cause for which he suffer'd  He desir'd after the Sentence to have said somewhat to the Parliament but was not suffer'd and so was carried back to Prison and the next Day every Part and Circumstance of the Sentence was executed upon him with all the Inhumanity imaginable and he bore it with all the Courage and Magnanimity and the greatest Piety that a good Christian could manifest When he had ended all he had to say and was expecting to expire they acted yet one Scene more of their Barbarity upon him the Hangman brought the Book that had been published of his truly Heroick Actions whilst he commanded in the Kingdom which together with his Declaration was tied in a small Cord that was put about his Neck At this new Instance of their Malice the Marquis smil'd and thanked them for it and said  he was glad it should be there and was prouder of wearing it than ever he had been of the Garter  and so renewing some devote Ejaculations he patiently endured the last Act of the Executioner  Thus died the gallant Marquis of  Montrose  after he had given says the Earl of  Clarendon  in his Character of him  'as great a Testimony of Loyalty and Courage as a Subject can do and performed as wonderful Actions in several Battles upon as great Inequality of Numbers and as great Disadvantages in Respect of Arms and other Preparations for War as have been performed in this Age' And he adds 'That  Montrose  was in his Nature fearless of Danger and never declined any Enterprise for the Difficulty of going thro' with it but exceedingly affected those which seem'd desperate to other Men and did believe somewhat to be in himself above other Men which made him live more easy towards those who were or were wi  ing to be inferior to him toward whom he exercised wonderful Civility and Generosity than with his Superiors or Equals He was naturally jealous and suspected those who did not concur with him in the Way not to mean so well as he He was not without Vanity but his Vertues were much superior and he well deserved to have his Memory preserv'd and celebrated amongst the most illustrious Persons of the Age in which he liv'd'  His Body was interr'd at the Place of Execution where it rested till the Restoration of the King that by his Majesty's special Appointment his scattered Parts were gathered together and deposited in the AbbeyChurch of  HolyRoodHouse  where it remained till the th of  May  his Corps was with the greatest Magnificence and Solemnity that could be devised carried to the Cathedral Church of St  Giles  and interr'd in the Isle belonging to his Family  Relation of the Funerals of the great Marquis

the War under his Father After whose Death being divested of his Estate he liv'd quietly and privately under the Powers that then prevail'd retaining his Affection and Fidelity to the Crown which he made manifest in performing all the Offices of Fidelity and Duty to the King throughout the whole Course of the Usurpation that a generous and worthy Person could find any Opportunity for with which his Majesty was abundanty satisfied and pleas'd  Upon the Return of the King the Marquis was restor'd to his Estate and the Act of his Father's Forfaulture repell'd and he was nam'd one of the Lords of his Majesty's PrivyCouncil But that which was thought strange and administred much Discourse both then and afterwards was that his Lordship was not preferr'd to any of the great Offices of the Crown considering the transcendent Merit of his Father and the great Value and Esteem the King had of himself as a Nobleman of great Honour and Integrity but the Reason I have ever hear'd assign'd for it was that the Marquis did not affect any publick Character a Life of Privacy and Quiet being really his own Choice and what was more suited to his Humour and Nature and dying in the Month of  February  in the  Charta in Cancellaria S D N R  was upon the d of of  April  thereafter  interr'd at the Chapel of  AberRuthven  in  Perth  Shire where the Bones of his Ancestors were committed to their Rest and his Funeral Sermon was preached by Dr  Alexander Burnet  then ArchBishop of  Glasgow  wherein he gave the Marquis a very good Character He was a Nobleman of great Honour and Probity so

his Years upon the th of  April    Charta in Cancellatia S D N R data d February  to the general Regret of the whole Nation and the particular Sorrow of his own Relations who lamented his Death exceedingly as a great Loss to his Family By  Christian  his Wife Daughter of  John  Duke of  Rothes  he had only a Son  James  the present Duke of  Montrose  This noble Lord being a Person of very bright and distinguishing Parts and the Head of a very noble Family that had in no Time swerv'd in its Fidelity to the Crown her Majesty Queen  Anne  soon after he came to Age called him to her PrivyCouncil made him first Lord High Admiral of  Scotland  in the Beginning of the  Ibidem data February  and then Lord President of the Council in little more as a Year thereafter  Ibidem  in which Station and in all other Capacities his Lordship did exert himself with the most ardent Zeal and Vigour in promoting the Succession to the Crown in the Protestant Line and on that Account did all he could to consolidate the Two Kingdoms in an incorporating Union and thereby giving a Sanction to the Title of the most serene House of  Hanover  to the Crown of this Realm in Consideration whereof as well as in Respect of his Lordship's personal Merit and in Honour of his noble Family for which the Queen did always prosess a very great Value and Regard her Majesty was pleas'd by Letters Patent th of  April  to make the Marquis Duke of  Montrose  Ibidem  and 'tis to be observed as a special Instance of her Majesty's more immediate Favou  that the Honour was not restricted to the Heirs Male of the Duke's own Body but was to descend to his Heirs of Entail  His Grace continued Lord President of the Council till the Parliament of  Great Britain  thought fit to dissolve the  Scots  PrivyCouncil

he was laid aside for not complying with the Measures of the Court during the  Earl of  Oxford  's Administration and the Duke of  Athole  was made PrivySeal in his Place  The Duke's firm and inviolable Adherence to the Protestant Succession which his Grace had so early and with so much Zeal maintain'd and asserted could not fail to intitle him to a more than ordinary Favour of the illustrious Family in whom the Right was established by Law and therefore when the Successor his Electoral Highness the Duke of  Brunswick  was by Act of Parliament impower'd to nominate so many Persons as he should think proper to be joined with the Seven great Officers of State in the Administration of the Government till his Arrival  An Historical Account of the Affairs of Great Britain

Honour to be named one of the Lords of the Regency But being at his Seat in the Country when the Act of Settlement of the Crown did actually take Effect by the Demise of Queen  Anne  of glorious Memory on the st of  July  his Grace made Haste to  Edinburgh  where he was present at the Proclamation of King  George  and taking Post for  London  he arrived there on the th of  August  thereafter

Peace and Tranquillity of the Kingdom King  George  having arrived in  Britain  on the th of  September  Six Days thereafter his Majesty was pleased to appoint his Grace the Duke to be One of His

the Service of his Country at the Battle of  Pinky  which Settlement thereafter took Place upon the Death of the Earl of  Angus  In the the Earl of  Morton  was one of the Peers who entered into a Bond of Association to promote the Reformation of Religion and the Year thereafter was sent Ambassador to  England  to treat with Queen  Elizabeth  about the maintaining a firm and lasting Peace betwixt the Two Crowns when he established himself so much in the Favour of that Princess that her Friendship was never in any Degree diminished toward him till his dying Day  After Queen  Mary  returned home from  France  in her Majesty made Choice of the Earl as one of her PrivyCouncil and in less than a Year thereafter he was sent Ambassador to the Queen of  England  in which Negotiation he behaved himself with great Prudence and Dexterity insomuch as upon his Return he was prefer'd to be Lord HighChancellor and he continued in the Office till the th of  March  he was deprived and forced to flee to  England  for alledged Accession to the Murder of  David Rizio  the Queen's  French  Secretary  But in a short Time thereafter by the Mediation and Interposition of the Earl of  Bothwell  he obtained his Pardon which he paid dear for afterward for that Earl thought by this Favour to bring the Earl of  Morton  over to his Interest but he soon found himself mistaken For tho' he had all Duty and Gratitude to him as a Friend yet the wicked Earl  Bothwel  did no sooner propose to him the Design and craved his Assistance toward the Murder of the Lord  Darnly  the Queen's Husband as a Piece of Service which would be very acceptable to her Majesty but he conjured him to lay  side the Thoughts of so base and unworthy an Enterprize and which would be attended with so much Infamy and Danger And when he could not prevail in that Point in Testimony he did abhor so detestable a Design he left the Court and retired to the Country when that bloody and barbarous Tragedy was to be acted And I think the Earl of  Morton  's Circumstances at this Time cannot but be pitied for if he had revealed the Earl of  Bothwel  's Design of taking away the King's Life it had cost him his own and his concealing it then brought him to die upon a Scaffold many Years thereafter  After the Murder of King  Henry  when the Nation both Protestants and Papists began to be alarmed with the Queen's Marriage with the Earl of  Bothwell  who was shrewdly suspected as the Murderer of her former Husband and the Danger the young Prince was in by such an Union the Earl of  Morton  was one of the most forward among the Nobility who enter'd into an Association for the Preservation of the Prince and when the Queen resigned the Government to the End her Son might be invested in the Sovereignty the Earl of  Morton  took the Coronation Oath for the Infant King at his Inauguration on the th of  July    In this new Turn of Affairs the Earl of  Morton's  Share was so considerable that assoon as the Earl of  Murray  had accepted the Regency the Earl of  Morton  was declared Chancellor upon the Removal of the Earl of  Huntly  who adhered to the Queen and made heritable Lord High Admiral of

the first Motion he made to resign the Government in the was accepted in a general Convention of the Nobility wherein it was agreed to that the young King should take upon him the Administration when he was not full Thirteen Years of Age and yet the new Court kept fair with the Earl for they procur'd a Parliament to be call'd wherein the late Regent obtain'd a Remission and Exoneration during his Regency in the most ample Manner he himself could devise and after that he play'd his Game so well that he was in a short Time again made President of the Council  and was in great Credit with his Majesty  Melvil's Memoirs  but that being what was not at all acceptable to the other Party who had the young King in their Hands and who were willing to be  rid of the Earl of  Morton  at any Rate for that End Sir  John Mattland  and Sir  Robert Melvil  his profess'd Enemies brought about his Ruin by pushing on Captain  James Stewart  the Lord  Ochiltree  's Son to accuse him as accessory to the Murder of the King's Father which the Captain did before the Council where the Earl himself was present on the st of  December  whereupon he was committed Prisoner to the Castle of  Edinburgh  and was thence sent under a strong Guard to  Dunbarton  from whence he was on the first of  June  thereafter brought to his Tryal at  Edinburgh  and being found guilty by his Peers of  Art and Part  in the Murther of the King's Father in so far as he had conceal'd and not revealed it when the Earl of  Bothwell  propos'd it to him he was condemn'd to be hang'd drawn and quarter'd which the King was pleas'd to mitigate so far that instead of being hanged he had the Favour to be beheaded which was accordingly execute on him at the Cross of  Edinburgh  on the d of  June    Upon the Death and Forfaulture of the Regent the Title of Earl of  Morton  was bestowed upon the Lord  Maxwell  but his Majesty having recalled and revoked that Deed and being further willing and desirous that all Animosities and Grounds of Contention among the Nobility might be removed for that End a Parliament was call'd in the wherein his Majesty pass'd an Act of Oblivion whereby every Body who had been forfaulted during the Troubles in the King's Minority were indemnified except such as had been accessory to his Father's Murder And tho' the Earl of  Morton  had been convicted of that Crime and suffer'd for it yet his Majesty considering  Bona fidelia gratuita Servitia Nobis facta per quondam Comitem de  Morton  in Gubernatione Administratione Nostri Regni nec non alia debita egregia Officia

Erection for in the Reign of King  David  I  Angus  Earl of  Murray  rais'd a Rebellion in the Northern Parts  Anno    Chron Sanctae Crucis de Edinburc mentions that in Anegus Comes Moraviensis a Scotis interfectus est  which ended in the Ruin of himself and his Abettors  King  Robert the Bruce  in the gave the Earldom of  Murray  to his Favourite Nephew the renown'd Sir  Thomas Randolph  comprehending  omnes Terras suas in  Moravia  sicut fue runt in Manibus Domini  Alexandri  Regis  Scotorum  Predecessoris nostri ultimo defuncti  Haddington's Collections from the Publick Records  This nobel Earl was upon the Death of his Uncle King  Robert  by the unanimous Consent of the Estates as well as by the Destination of the King named Regent to the young King  David  II but before he had continued two full Years in that exalted Station which he very worthily discharged he was taken away by Death in the leaving Issue by  Isobel  his Wife Daughter of Sir  Alexander Stewart  of  Bonkil John  his Son and Heir and several Daughters  Agnes  married to  Patrick  Earl of  March  and  Isobel  to Sir  William Murray  Kt  Which  John  did eminently signalize himself in his Loyalty to King  David  and in his Affection and Duty to his Country during all the Attacks were made upon our Constitution either by the  English  or a disloyal Party of our own CountryMen who adhered to

 leaving no Issue so that his Estate and Title devolved to the Countess of  March  his Sister in whose Right or by the Courtesy of  Scotland  the Earl her Husband design'd himself Earl of  March  and  Murray  DUNBAR Earl of  Murray  IN the King  Robert  II did by his Royal Charter under the Great Seal erect the Earldom of  Murray  in Favours of  John Dunbar  the Earl of  March  's Son and  Marjory  his Wife the King's Daughter  Charta in Rotulis Roberti II data in pleno Parliamento March Anno Regni R R Secundo  and to their Heirs  They had Issue  Thomas  Earl of  Murray  and  Alexander Dunbar

James Dunbar  of  Frendraught  his Cousin who espoused first  Isobel  a Lady of the Family of the  Inneses  who bare him a Son Sir  Alexander Dunbar  who was thereafter Sheriff of  Murray  But this Lady dying before the Marriage could be consummated according to the Rites of the  Romish  Church which behoved to proceed upon a Dispensation by Reason  of Consanguinity betwixt the Parties The Earl married again  Janet  Daughter to the Earl of  Huntly  by whom he had Two Daughters  Janet  the Elder marry'd to the Lord  Crichton  's Son and  Marion  the Younger to  Archbald Douglass  Son to the Earl of  Douglass  who in Right of his Wife was Earl of  Murray  but unhappily taking Part with his Brother the Earl of  Douglass  in his Rebellion in the Reign of King  James  II was forfaulted with him and others his Adherents in  STEWART Earl of  Murray  FROM the Time of King  James  III the Earldom of  Murray  continued in the Crown and there remained till the Reign of King  James  V that that Prince by Letters Patent bearing Date on the th of  J  ne    Charta in Rotulis Jacobi IV  gave it to  James Stewart  his Natural Son whom he had by  Jean Kennedy  the Lord  Kennedy  's Daughter his Paramont  He married  Isobel  Daughter to the Earl of  Argyle  and dying th of  June  left only one Daughter  Mary  married to  John  Master of  Buchan  so the Earldom of  M  rray  went back again to the Crown and being in the Sovereign's Disposal Queen  Mary  on the th of  February    Ibid in Rotuiis Mariae R  gave it to  George  Earl of  Huntly  But her Majesty recalling that Deed she was afterward graciously pleased to bestow the Earldom of  Murray  upon  James  Prior of  St Andrews  He was the natural Son of King  James  V by  Margaret  Daughter of  John  Lord  Erskine  who being by the Care of his Father as of all the rest of his illegitimate Sons were bred to the Church he was when very young provided to the Priory of St  Andrews Anno  then void by the Promotion of  Patrick Hepburn  to the Episcopal See of  Murray  but by Reason of his Nonage Dr  Alexander Miln  Abbot of  Cambuskenneth  and President of the College of Justice was appointed Administrator of the Benefice  Charta in Pub Arch  both with Respect to the Spiritual and Temporal Discharge of the Function  By Reason of the Prior's Youth I have met with nothing memorable of him till the Beginning of the Reformation he was among the first who embraced the Protestant Reform'd Religion tho'he was far from giving any Countenance to the Popular Reformation as is manifest from the many and frequent Addresses he and others of the Protestant Nobility made to the Queen Regent that she would please to concur by her Authority in reforming of the Church  But the Queen peremptorily refusing not only to comply with their Supplications but having also violated some Articles of Pacification she had very solemnly enter'd into with the Protestant Lords of which the Prior of St  Andrews  himself stood Guarantee he thereupon left her and join'd himself with  the Lords of the Congregation  as they were call'd whereupon the Prior the Lord  James  was summon'd before the Council but he did not think fit to answer the Charge otherwise than to return this Answer to the Messenger  That her Majesty had broken the Conditions with the Lords of the Congregation which by Warrant from herself he had made and entred into with them he would have no more Meddling in such dishonest Courses and would do the best to repair Things he  could  This Answer gave Occasion to the Queen to signifie to the Prior  That she suspected that Religion was the least Thing he or his Party had in their Thoughts and that she did not doubt but that under the Covert and Pretext of Religion he intended to make an At+tempt upon the Crown  The Prior in the mean Time disowns the Charge and thought himself obliged for his further Vindication to make a very solemn Protestation that he had no other View or Design in what he had done than the Advancement of the true Reformed Religion and the Preservation of the Liberties of his Coun+try which he could not but bewail he saw so signally invaded by her at least by those who pretended to act by and derive their Authority from her after which he was so hearty a Promoter of the Reformation that he became the Head of the Protestant Party  When Queen  Mary  became a Widow by the Death of King  Francis  II the Prior of  St Andrews  was sent by the Protestant Nobility to invite the Queen home and soon after her Arrival her Majesty having nam'd a new Privy Council the Lord  James  her Brother was appointed one of the Number and not long thereafter he was sent with a Commission of Lieutenancy to the Borders to suppress an Insurrection that was threatned in those Parts and he discharged the Trust reposed in him with such Cou+rage and Fidelity that upon his Return the Queen was graciously pleas'd to bestow upon her Brother the Earldom of  Mar  then in the Crown but the Lord  Erskine  being found to have Right to the Earldom of  Mar  that Lord was by Way of Justice restored to that Honour in Lieu whereof the Prior of  St Andrews  was made Earl of  Murray  th  February    Charta in Pub Arch    After this the Earl continued in the greatest Favour with the Queen without any Interruption till the that her Majesty declared her Resolution to marry the Lord  Darnly  that my Lord  Murray  and many others did oppose the Match upon Pretext of the Danger that might arise to Religion and to the State by that Union forasmuch as it had not been practised at any Time to impose a King upon the Nation without the Advice and Consent of Parliament and in order to put a more effectual Stop thereto  They made  says Sir  James Melvil an Essay to take the Lord  Darnly  in the Queen's Company at the Raid of  Baith  and as they alledged to have sent him to  England But sailing in their Enterprise they were so closely pursued by the Queen's Troops that they thought it the safest Course for them to flee to  England  where they met but with a very cold Reception from Queen  Elizabeth  tho' she had very much encourag'd them underhand to enter into those Measures to disturb the Peace and Tranquillity of  Scotland  and to fully the Glory of Queen  Mary  's Reign  After the Queen's Marriage with the Lord  Darnly  a Parliament was call'd before which the Earl of  Murray  and his Associates were summon'd to answer a Charge of HighTreason which was prepar'd against them and the Earl would have undoubtedly been denounced Rebel and forfaulted had not the Murther of  David Rizio  prevented it which happen'd Three Days before the sitting down of the Parliament At the Day appointed the Earl of  Murray  returned home and went straight to the Parliament House and took Instruments that he was ready to answer the Summons of Treason but such was the Confusion of Affairs that no  Evidence came against him and the Queen believing him innocent of  Rizio  's Murther was pleased to give him a gracious Pardon restore him to her wonted Favour and to place an unsuspected Confidence in him but the Broils of the Country still increasing more and more especially after the Murther of the Lord  Darnly  he obtain'd the Queen's Leave to travel which he did first into  England  and thence into  France  where he remained till the Queen had made a Resignation of the Government and the Prince King  James  VI her Son set upon the Throne that he was call'd hom  to be Regent to the young King to which Office he was chosen by those of the Nobility who adhered to the Prince in his Absence on the d of  August  In  December  thereafter he call'd a Parliament wherein the Pope's Authority was abolished and the true Protestant Religion receiv'd a new Sanction thereafter having settled the Government and seeming secure in it he was on the d of  January  unexpectedly as he was riding thro' the Street of  Linlithgow  far from apprehending any Danger shot from a Window with a Musket in the lower Part of his Belly by  James Hamilton  of  Bothwelhaugh  in Revenge of a private Injury the Regent had done him and in the Instant falling from his Horse died the same Evening Few Days after his Body was removed to  Edinburgh  and with great Funeral Solemnity interr'd in St  Giles  's Church where a Monument was erected over his Grave with this Inscription upon it  Pietas sine Vindice luget  Jus exarmatum est    Januarii    JACOBO STEWARTO  Moraviae  Comiti  SCOTIAE  Proregi  Viro Aetatis suae longe optimo ab Inimicis omnis Memoriae deterrimis ex insidiis extincto ce  Patri communi Patria maerens posuit  As to the Regent's Character Mr  Buchanan  his old Tutor and faithful Friend draws a very fair and bright one of him and some later Writers whose Pens perhaps have been directed as much by Malice as Truth have endeavoured to give the World a very ill Impression of him and I observe that generally Men pass their Judgments upon him according to the Party they are of for these Reasons I shall not take his Character from any Party Writer either of the one or the other Side And therefore shall rather choice to recite that given by Bishop  Spotiswood  than add any of my own  His Death  says that Reverend Author  was by all Men greatly lamented especially by the Commons who loved him as their Father whilst he liv'd and now m  urn'd grievously at his Death the great Things he had wrought in his Life having in the Space of one Year and little more quieted the State which he found broken and disorder'd made his very Enemies speak of him with Praise and Commendation above all his Vertues which were not a few he shined in Piety toward GOD ordering himself and his Family in such Sort as it did more resemble a Church than a Court for therein besides the Exercise of Devotion which he never omitted there was no Wickedness to be seen nay not an un  eemly wanton Word to be heard a Man truly good and worthy to be ranked among the best Governors that this Kingdom hath enjoyed and therefore to this Day is honoured with the Title of  The Good Regent  The Regent married  Agnes  Daughter of  William  Earl Marischal by whom he had Two Daughters  Margaret  Countess of  Murray  the Heir of his Honour and Estate and  Mary  married to  Francis  Earl of  Errol  Which  Margaret  was married with  James Stewart  Lord  Down  who in Right of her his Wife became Earl of  Murray  He was a Person of great Parts Magnanimity and Courage  Nota  The Lord Down's Paternal Ancessor was Sir James Stewart of Bieth Third Son of Andrew Lord Evandale who being one of the Gentlemen of the BedChamber to King James V and in great Favour with that Prince was made Captain of Down and after that Stewart of Menteth By Margaret Lindsay his Wife Dowager Barroness of Innermeath he had James and Henry of whom is Stewart of  urro Which James was Commendator of St Colm at the Time of the Reformation and thereafter was by King James VI created Lord Down and made Collector General of his Majesty's Revenue He married Margaret Daughter to the Earl of Argyle By her he had James his eldest Son who married the Countess of Murray as above Henry Lord St Colm and Two Daughters Mary married to Sir John Weems of ThatIlk and Jean to Simon Lord Lovat  and wanted nothing but Age and Experience to have render'd him a most accomplish'd Nobleman Upon some Maters of Interest there fell a Misunderstanding betwixt him and the Earl of  Hantly  which grew into such an Animosity between them that the King very much apprehended the Danger of those Divisions there ha+ving been some Blood shed and Men kill'd upon thei  private Contests so that the Country was passionately divided between them his Majesty therefore in order to settle the whole Dispute upon the hearing all that could be said by either Party and being desirous to accommodate the Mater himself caus'd summon them before the Council and both the Earls obeying the Charge it was determi+ned that the Earl of  Huntly  should be ordered home to the Country and my Lord  Murray  to stay at Court for some Time  But asso  n  says Sir  James Melvil as  Huntly  went home he triumphed and took sundry Advantages upon the Earl of  Murray  's Lands giving him just Cause of Complaint and  Murray  after sundry Representations getting no Redress he retired himself from the Court and became so malecontent that he took plain Part with the Earl of  Bothwell wh  had attempted to seize upon the King's Person at his Palace of  HolyRoodHouse  in order to oblige his Majesty to receive him into Favour  The Earl of  Huntly  being advertis'd  continues my Author  that his Adversary  Murray  was an Outlaw with the Earl of  Bothwell  he return'd to Court to get some Advantage of him But in the mean Time the Lord  Ochiltree  endeavouring to agree them with Consent of his Majesty in order thereto drew the Earl of  Murray  to  Dunibirsel a Seat of his own in  Fife to be near Hand that Conditions and Articles might be added and pared at the Pleasure of their Friends The Earl of  Huntly  being made Privy to  Murray  's coming to  Dunibirsel  obtain'd incontinently a Commission to pursue the Earl of  Bothwell  and all his Partakers  whereupon with an armed Force consisting most of his own Vassals and Retainers he unexpectedly beset the House of  Dunibirsel  and upon the Earl's refusing to surrender himself to  Huntly  the House was set on Fire notwithstanding the Earl made his Way thro' the Flames and also bravely thro' his more merciless Enemies and had so far succeeded in his Escape that he was got fairly out of their Hands and had concealed himself among the Rocks by the Sea But the Tip of his HeadPiece which had taken Fire before he left the House discover'd him thro' the Darkness of the Night  Mr David Simpson's Historical Narrative of the Murther of the Earl of Murray by the Earl of Huntly MS penes me  whereupon his Enemies set upon and instantly murther'd him with many Circumstances of Barbarity on the th of  February  His Death was universally regreted and the King bore it with extraordinary Grief  For little knew  says Sir  James Melvil his Majesty that  Huntly  under this general Clause of pursuing  Bothwell  and his Accomplices he was minded to assail the Earl of  Murray  at his own House and to kill him as he did to the Regret of many  By the Countess of  Murray  his Wife he left Two Sons  James  the next Earl  Francis Stewart  Esq  also Three Daughters  Margaret  married to  Charles  Earl of  Nottingham  of the

was the Son of  Patrick  first Lord  Lindores  by  Jean  his Wife Daughter of  Robert  Earl of  Orknay  being a younger Brother he entered when he was a Youth into the Life and Condition of a Soldier

excellent Officer  When the Civil War broke out he left the  Swedish  Service and betook himself to the Service of the Parliament of  Scotland  by whom he was preferr'd to be Lieutenant General of the Army which in the was sent to  England  to the Assistance of the Parliament there against the King and after that he continued in the Head of the  Scots  Army in all their prosperous Successes with singular Reputation till the End of the War  When the Parliament declared for King  Charles  II and rais'd an Army to oppose the  English  Invasion under  Oliver Cromwell  in Lieutenant General  Lesly  was chosen General and tho' that Army under his Command was quickly and intirely routed at  Dunbar  yet his Reputation was so intire as an Officer of great Experience and the King thought him so faithful to him and worthy of any Trust or Command he should confer on him that assoon as another Army was rais'd to march into  England  with the King of which his Majesty was himself General he appointed Lieutenant General  Lesly  Lieutenant General under him And tho' neither in the March nor yet in the fatal Day at  Worcester  did he perform the Office of a General with that Vigour and Spirit as he had done formerly on other Occasions yet the King did not believe he had been false to him For upon all the Enquiries that were afterward made when most of the false and treacherous Actions which had been committed were discovered there appeared no Cause to suspect that the Lieutenant General had been  unfaithful in his Charge and as it was not a little Vindication to him that from the Time of his Imprison ment that he was taken after  Worcester  till the Restauration of the King he never received any Favour from the  English  Parliament nor from  Cromwell  but underwent the same Hardships and Severities the most loyal of his Countrymen suffered  Clarendon's Hist of the Rebellion  And that which put his Fidelity to the King beyond what the utmost Calumny of his Enemies could invent was that his Majesty after his Return immediately created him a Peer of the Realm by the Title of Lord  Newark  st of  August    Charta in Rotulis Caroli II  and thereafter wrote him a Letter in his Vindication in these Words  Although we have upon all Occasi+ons both abroad and since our happy Re+turn declared our self fully satisfied with your Conduct and Loyalty in our

and  England  behave yourself with als much Conduct Resolution and Honesty as was possible or could be expected from a Person in that Trust and as we told you so we do again repeat it that if we had

very hopeful young Nobleman who died about the Age of Sixteen at the University of  Eainburgh  the th of  February  with many Circumstances of Regret of which this was not the least that with him did the Honour  of this illustrious Family expire and come to an End I have been told by some who knew this Lord  Och  ltree  that he was a most hopeful Scholar a great Friend to the Muses and there are some Fragments of his Poetical Fancy extant which very much discover the Excellency of his Genius that Way  OLIPHANT Lord  Oliphant  THE Ancestor of this ancient Family  David de Oliphard  was one of those Barons who accompanied King  David  I to  England  with an Army to the Assistance of  Maude  the Empress his Niece against King  Stephen  of whom 'tis memorable that after the raising of the Siege of  Winchester  in the King  David  was so closely pursu'd that he was in a very great Hazard of being made a Prisoner had it not been for the singular Valour of this noble Person who had the Honour to rescue and bring off the King his Sovereign to his immortal Honour  Dalrymple's Collections P  This Piece of signal and eminent Service was enough to intitle him to a more than ordinary Share of that good King's Favour who with out doubt rewarded him according to his Merit and that he was much about him afterward in some Office of Trust or Attendance appears from the Frequency of his being found witnessing the Deeds of that Prince to many religious Places  He's Witness to the King's Grants to Coldingham and Dunfermling  particularly in one to the Prio  y o    whereto his Seal is append  d which by the bearing thereupon  viz  Crescents  clearly prove him to be the Ancestor of this noble Family who still bear the same Figures in their Ensigns Armorial  Another  David de Oliphard  perhaps the Son of the former  David  was no less the Favourite of King  Malcolm  and King  William  than his Predecessor had been of King  David  In a Charter by King Malcolm to the Monks of Scoon he David de Olyphard is a Witness thereto and in another by King Wil to the same Convent likewise in a Charter by the same King Fratribus hospitalis Sa  cti Andreae also in one to the same Priory of St Andrews by King William with Nicol Cancel  in the Beginning of whose Reign he was constituted  Justiciartus Laodoniae  David de Olphard Justiciario is Witness in a Grant by King Wil to

Andrews to the Priory there  at the same Time when  Comes Dunec  us  was  Justiciarius Scotiae  which Office he held for any Thing I have discovered to the contrary even till his Death To this  David  succeeded  Walter de Oliphard  his Son who in the th of King  William  was one of the Hostages given for the Ransom of the said King when he was taken Prisoner by the  English  at the Battle of  Alnwick  on the th of  July  and that which shows Sir  Walter  was a very great Man are the Collegues who were joined with him  viz Comes Waldave Comes Dunecan Comes Gilebert  together with  Richard Morvil  Great Constable of  Scotland  Rymer's Foedera    This  Walter  made a very great Figure under  Alexander  II in the th of whose Reign  Anno  he was named one of the Guarantees in a Treaty bet

the recovering of his Province of  Gascony  Rymer's Foedera  But I don't think he obey'd the Summons for soon thereafter when the War brok  out betwixt the Two Kingdoms Sir  William  had the ill Fate

than was necessary to put himself in Equipage to attend and serve King  Edward  in the Army he design'd to employ against  France  But I have all the Reason in the World to believe he had little Regard to the Promise he had made for assoon as he came home he heartily and personally engag  d himself in the War against King  Edward  for recovering the Honour and Freedom of his Country which that Prince had so signally invaded and thereafter when the  English  invaded  Scotland  in Sir  William Olyfend  was appointed Governor of  Stirling  Castle which he defended with great Resolution

the Title of Duke of  Orkney  But no sooner was the Marriage consummate between the Queen and the Duke than some of those very Persons who advised and most advanced the Match which was certainly the most unfortunate Step of her Life entered into Cabals and Associations to ruin them both and which they very speedily and successfully effected For in less than a Year thereafter they imprisoned the Queen and forced the unhappy Duke to fly out of the Country and then condemned and forfaulted him whereby he was not only depr  ved of his new acquired Title of Duke but also of Earl which had been in

Earl of  Panmure  and the other Branches of that most noble Family  MAULE Earl of  Panmure  BOETHIUS  and some other Historians of the  Scots  Nation do reckon that the first Ancestor of this ancient and noble Family came from  Hungary  to  Scotland  in the Reign of King  Malcolm  III in the Retinue of  Edward  the Outlaw of  England  and of  Margaret  his Sister thereafter Queen of  Scotland  But as this Assertion of Mr  Bois  's is without Authority or even so much as Probability so I rather incline with some modern Antiquaries who have enquired with great Curiosity into the Origin and Progress of Sirnames among us to think the first Ancestor of the  Maules  to have come from  France  and extracted from the noble Family of  de Maulia  so call'd from a fair Lordship of that Name in the Dutchy of  Nor mandy  the first of whom I have found using the Sirname was  Petrus de Maulia Filtus  Ansoldi  Filit Guarini  who gave  Anno  to the Monks of  Uttica  the Churches of St  Mary  St

and afterward retiring from the World for the better disposing himself as he thought to Devotion he took upon him the Habit of a Monk of St  Bennet  in that Cloister where he ended his Days not long after and was there interr'd with this Epitaph upon his Tomb writ by  Odo  of  Monstrewel  Si quis erit si scire velit dum vivus adesset  Quis fuerat quem Tumba tegit quod nomen haberet  Ansoldi

Maulta  and tho' he was afterward so far reconciled to his Prince as that he accompanied him to the Battle of  Breunivil  against  Henry  I of  England  in the    Ibidem  yet for what I have found he never recovered so much Favour as to be restored to the Possession of his Estate And 'tis highly probable at least much more so than  Boethius  Story that upon the falling low of the Family of  De Maulia  in  France  a Branch of them was transplanted to  S  tland  in the Time of King  David  I who  e Bounty and Generosity we know was not confin'd to his own Subjects but was also very liberally

Appearance and ever afterward treated  Panmure  on that Account with the greatest Respect and Esteem insomuch as after his Majesty assumed the Government on himself he grants a Dispensation to this

their Privilege of sitting in Parliament I am at a Loss to know in regard I find several of them design'd in old Writs  Nobiles potentes Domini  a Title which was afterward made a sufficient Authority to establish a Family in the Dignity of Lord Barons in the Decreet of Ranking  Anno    Tho' this Loyal Gentleman was after this under no Necessity of ever appearing in any publick Action by vertue of the King's Dispensation yet he no sooner saw his Country threatned with Danger by Party and Faction after the Death of King  James  V than at the Command of the Regent the Earl of  Arran  he rais'd his Vassals and Re  ainers joined the Lord  Gray  and others and attacked the Town of  Perth  which the Lord  Ruthven  held out against the Queen's Authority Tho' they were at first repuls'd and the Laird of  Panmure  who first made the Attack was taken Prisoner yet in the End the Affair came to be adjusted to the Satisfaction of the Governor  Mr Maule's Hist MS  At the same Time the Laird of  Panmure  was a strenuous Opposer of the intended Match betwixt Queen  Mary  and  Edward  VI of  England  from an Apprehension his Country might suffer not only in its Freedom and Independency but also in its other valuable Privileges by such an Union So that when the War broke out betwixt the two Nations on the Breach of the Articles that had been formerly agreed to and on which ensu'd the Battle of  Pinky Panmure  's Affections being known that Way the  English  Governor of  Bruchty  detached a strong Party from the Garison to seize and apprehend him in his own House and notwithstanding  of the Surprize yet a very noble and brisk Defence was made within and the old Gentleman himself received divers Wounds but not being prepared for a Siege he was at length forced to surrender  Mr Robert

Elbuife  the  French  Ambassador to  Scotland  with the Regent of  England  in whose Company he came Home in the and being by this Time aged he thenceforth pass'd the Residue of his Time in a happy

Valour at the Fight of  Haldonrig  Ibidem  against the  English  where he had the ill Fortune to be taken Prisoner and was sent to  Morpeth  where he remained till after the Death of King  James  V that King  Henry  VIII did then politically release all the  Scots  Prisoners of Note and Character in Hopes to engage them to promote the Union he designed of the Two Kingdoms by the Marriage of his Son Prince  Edward  and Queen  Mary  But tho' the Laird of  Panmure  had a very grateful Sense of the Favour that Prince had done him yet it had never the least Influence on him to engage him in any Interest or Party that prov'd prejudicial to his Country but upon the breaking out of the War with  England  he heartily and personally engaged in the publick Service and was at the Battle of  PinkyCleugh  Ibidem  where with great Difficulty he got his Escape made having lost many of his Friends and Vassals particularly  Thomas Maule  of  Boath  his own ConsinGerman After the End of the War as he liv'd in great Splendor at home and made a very considerable Figure in the Country so he had severals of Notes who were retained to serve him and among others I find  John Scrimzeor  Constable of  Dundee  gives him his Bond of Manrent and Service as his Superior in Consequence of a former Obligation of the same Nature which Sir  James Scrimzeor  his Predecessor had formerly made to Sir  Thomas Maule  of  Panmure  which by his own Obligation he ratifies and renews of the Date th of  May    Comitem de Panmure I have seen other Bonds of Manrent in the Custody of the  Panmure by the Gentry of Forfarshire but this single one I thought sufficient to mention  This loyal and brave Man afterward accompanied Queen  Mary  in her Northern Progress as far as  Aberdeen  and would have march'd with her all the Length she design'd in those Parts had not the afflicted Circumstances of his Family call'd him to return Home with the Queen's Permission so that he was not at the Fight of  Corichy  which happen'd soon thereafter but her Majesty did not want any further Testimony of his Loyalty having been fully satisfied in his Fidelity and Affection to the Crown by many repeated Instances through the whole Course of his Life before  When the Troubles broke out in this Reign he did not meddle much with either Party but kept himself as much if not more out of the Broils of the Times than any other of his Quality in the Kingdom for in all the publick Transactions during the Course of the War I don't find him ever concerned in any publick Deed save in that Association  Bond at G  asgow now printed  which was entered into in the Year of GOD by the Bulk of the Nation for the Inauguration of the young Prince King  James  VI upon the Queen his Mother's Resignation And I observe the Bond is not only signed by those who were the greatest Promoters of the Reformation but even by others of the Nobility and Gentry who were of the  Roman  Religion and afterward adhered to the Queen with great Firmness and Fidelity which gives me Ground to believe they were not then throughly acquainted with the Circumstances by which the Dimission was extorted from her otherwise I cannot think that Men of Honour could have shifted as so many of them did all of a sudden and become most inveterate Enemies to the Government that succeeded during the whole of the young King's Minority  This Gentleman was first espoused to the Lady  Elizabeth Lindsay  Daughter of  David  Earl of  Crawfurd  Contract of Marriage penes Comitem de Panmure a    and thereafter he married

Turn to Antiquities particularly of his own Country in which he was very exact He wrote several Treaties with great Judgment and Learning one which he calls  Periodi Gentis  Scotorum the Abstract whereof he gives in these Words  Has in septem partiti sumus quarum prima initium ducit a primo  Scotorum  ex  Hispaniâ  adventu in  Albium  appulsu tempus illud totum occupabit quo nostri sub

as also another Treatise  De Antiquitate Gentis  Scotorum in a tolerable pure  Latin  Stile which he says was written  contra  Anglorum  Calumnias Mendacia  and seems to be plainly levelled against the  English  Antiquary Mr  Cambden  who about that Time I think had published his  Britannia  wherein he asserts some Things that the  Scots  Antiquaries were mightily displeas'd with and none more than Commissar  Maule  who was one of the most strenuous Asserters of the Freedom and Independency of  Scotland  and among the first who attacked  Cambden  in which he was seconded by Mr  Hume  of  Godscroft  and afterward by the learned Mr  Drummond  of  Hawthornden  Beside other very judicious Remarks on the History of his Country I observe from the little I have seen of Mr  Maule  's M S that he hath happily hit upon a better Notion of the ancient  Culdees  than any Author before him and when I have Occasion to peruse more of his Book in Relation to that Matter I shall not fail to do his Memory all imaginable Justice and frankly own the Helps I had from him in a Dissertation concerning the  Culdees  I have by me and which I intend GOD willing to communicate to the World  Thomas Maule

Appearance as some of his Predecessors it being a Time of profound Peace he lived in tho we cannot say what Figure he might have made had he had any Opportunity to exert himself in the Service of his Country in the Wars against the  English  but then all National Animosities were outwardly removed by the Union of the Crowns in the Person of King  James  VI of glorious Memory who before the Time of his Accession to the  English  Crown as a Mark of his  Favour to the Laird of  Panmure  did make him heretable Bailiff of the Barony of  Barry  an Office his Ancestors had exerced by Commission from

pleasant Humor and Disposition of a notable Affability in his Behaviour and well qualified by his Breeding for any Service his Master should think fit to employ him in he quickly grew to be very acceptable to the King and into a general Esteem with the Court insomuch as his Majesty in a short Time made him one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber about the Time or a little after his Entrance to  England  in and as he attended his Majesty into that Kingdom so he lived upon his own Fortune without any other Support than the Profits of his Place and his Majesty's Favour Mr  Maule  liv'd always decently and in a fair Intelligence with the Favourites having always Credit enough to provide for his own Interest without troubling himself with that of other Men And that which made him exceedingly beloved in the Court was that he never desired to get that for himself which others laboured for but was ever ready to use his Interest with his Master to promote the Pretences of worthy Men As this his Behaviour made him many Friends so few or none had the Confidence to avow themselves to be his Enemies and as he had always a full Share in his Majesty's Esteem and Favour who looked on him as a wise and faithful Servant so he was graciously pleased to give many Testimonies thereof particularly in a new Charter to him under the Great Seal of his ancient Barony of  Panmure  in The Narrative bears the Grant to be made by his Majesty  i  Consideration of the good loyal and acceptab  e Service done and performed to Us by Our intirely beloved familiar faithful and domestick Servant  Patrick

Capacity to do Us all laudable Service at all Times and on all Occasions as he shall be commanded by Us of which his most faithful and acceptable Service We have full and sufficient Experience  Moreover in the new Gift of the same Charter whereby the King dispones to him the Patronage of the Church of  Panbride  His Majesty declares his Motive to the Grant to be  upon His own sufficient Experience of the Wisdom Di  cretion and Judgment of the said  Patrick Maule  of  Panmure  and his prudent  Management of his own Affairs and of the ardent Zeal and Affection which he has for the Propagation of the Gospel  For King  James  was ever most solicitous after the restoring of Episcopacy to have the Laick Patronages in the Hands of such Persons as were Friends to the Church as then established by Law and his Son King  Charles  of ever blessed Memory who did not come short of his Royal Father but rather exceeded him in his Zeal for the Church being fully satisfied of Mr  Maule  's Affection that Way and of his unblemished Integrity in the Protestant Religion his Majesty gave his Royal Consent and Approbation to the Transaction which passed betwixt him and the Earl of  Dysart

commended him to his Son King  Charles  as a Person to be relied on in Honour and Fidelity of which that Prince himself was also very well satisfied and pleased for he not only continued him in his Bedchamber but made him also SheriffPrincipal of  Forfarshire  when the Crown acquired the Hereditary Right of that Office from the Family of  Gray  in  Charta in Rotulis Caroli I ad Annum  the King always lodging these new acquired Jurisdictions in the Hands of such Persons as he could confide in  When the Troubles broke out Mr  Maule  being a Person of most eminent Affection and of intire Devotion to the Crown adhered to the King with great Honour and Fidelity was with him in all the Battles in which his Majesty was ingaged in his own Royal Person and thereafter went with him to  Oxford  where he stay'd till the first War was brought to an End by his Majesty's putting himself in the  Scots  Army before  Newark  Assoon as it was known where the King was Mr  Maule  repaired to him and waited on him thence to  Newcastle  when his Majesty thought fit to put a lasting Mark of his Favour on his old faithful Servant and made him a Peer by the Title of  Earl of Panmure August  d  Charta penes Comitem de Panmure  with as great Circumstances of Grace and Favour as could be expressed For in the Preamble to the Patent his Majesty was graciously pleased to call to Remembrance his Lordship's Services to his Father and his Fidelity to himself which he declared in these Words  WHEREAS We have particular Knowledge of the long and faithful Service of Our well beloved  Patrick Maule  Baron of  Panmure  one of the Gentlemen of Our Bedchamber both in the Reign of Our most dear Father of ever blessed Memory and also ever since Our Accession to the Throne now these one and twenty Years by a close Adherence to Our Sacred Person and seeing We are most ready to bestow some Mark of Our Royal Favour on the said  Patrick  now that he is turning old  KNOW YE THERFORE That We have created  c  Thereafter when the King was delivered up by the  Scots  Army to such Persons whom the  English  Parliament had appointed to receive him the Earl of  Panmure  attended on his Majesty to  Holmby  in  Northamptonshire  and tho the Parliament's Commissioners had declared that his Majesty should be treated with all Demonstration of Respect and Duty and waited on by such of his Servants as he should appoint yet he had not continued there many Days before the Parliament gave Orders to dismiss such of his Servants as were there and had waited on him at  Ox+ford  And tho the Demand was very grating to the King  Journal by the Earl of Panmure of what pass'd during his Lordship's Attendance on his Majesty at Holmb  penes Comitem de Panmure  yet that he might not seem to refuse to give them Satisfaction in any Thing they required he yielded to their Desire but in the Instant they were to be discharged the King signified that it would be well pleasing to him that the Commissioners would allow only Two of his old trusty Servants to attend him and this he would look upon as a Testimony of their Respect to him which being granted his Majesty was pleased to pitch upon the Earl of  Panmure  and the Earl of  Dirletoun  both the Earls being Persons in whom his Majesty had an absolute Confidence and that he was sure neither of them would either deceive or betray him The Earl of  Panmure  was with his Majesty when Cornet  Joice  came on the d of  June  with a Troop of Horse and violently seized on the King's Person and carried him from  Holmby  to the Army and after to  HamptonCourt  his Lordship having Liberty to attend his Master in all the Removes he made which was to his Majesty's great Satisfaction And tho at first the King enjoyed himself much more having the Liberty of his own Servants than he had before when he was at  Ho  mby  Yet alas It was not long before the chief Officers of the Army seem'd more regardless of the King and treated his Servants with less Civility insomuch as his Majesty  rom an Apprehension they had some secret Design upon his Life made his Escape upon the th  November  from  Hampton Court  Clarendon's History of the Rebellion  and unhappily went to the Island of  Wight  which prov'd so fatal to him Thither his Lordship so soon as he had Intelligence where the King was gone repaired to him having no Reason to doubt but that his Presence would be very acceptable to his Master  Journal by the Earl of Panmure while his Lordship waited on the King during his Imprisonment  And his Lordship attended in his Office in the Bedchamber till his Majesty having refused to give his Royal Assent to the four Bills the Parliament had then sent to him which he said did divest him of all Sovereignty that Colonel  Hamond  the Governor of the Place by Order from his Masters caused all the King's Servants to be immediately put out of  Carisbrook castle  and forbid any of them to repair thither any more upon their Peril  Clarendon's History of the Rebellion  whereupon the Earl after the King had used many gracious Expressions of his Lordships faithful Services kissed his Majesty's Hands and took a sad Farewell of his Master appearing to have little Hope ever to see him again in this World and departing for  Scotland  lived quietly at his own House in the Country keeping his Heart and Affections always intire for the King  After the Murther of his Majesty and the total Suppression of the Royal Cause tho the Earl of  Panmure  was very aged and so out of Capacity himself to have appeared in any  Action for the King's Service yet when  Cromwel  prevail'd and got himself made Protector that ArchTyrant and Traytor did by an Ordinance of his Council very arbitrarily impose a Fine on the Earl of  Panmure  of  lib Sterl  Printed Ordinance of Cromwel's Council in penes me  for no other Reason but his being a Person of known Loyalty and having his Sons engaged in the King's Service  After which he lived with Ease and Plenty in his Fortune which was very great and in great Reputation with all those who wished well to the Crown the Restoration of which as no Man more heartily wished so he had the Comfort of seeing it brought about by a most surprising Act of Providence when there appeared least Hope of it and least worldly Means to bring it to pass which was the Thing his Lordship had longed most passionately to see before he should leave the World He died on the d of  December  and was inter'd in the Vault of his Family at  Panbride  Church with his Ancestors  This noble Earl married three Wives first  Frances  Daughter of Sir  Edward Stanhope  of  Grimstoun  of the County of  York  Knight of the same Family with the Earl of  Chesterfield  in  England  by whom he had four Children  viz  George  Lord  Brechin  his Successor in the Honour  Colonel  Hary Maule  of  Balmakelly  who in the End of the Reign of King  Charles  I betook himself to the Service of the King and had a Regiment bestowed on him in the Army that was raised in order to redeem his Majesty from Prison and restore him to his Freedom and Liberty but being taken Prisoner at the Battle of  Preston  he found Means to make his Escape into  Scotland  and with the same Affections the Colonel engaged again in the Service of King  Charles  II and had the Command of a Regiment of Foot at the unfortunate Battle of  Dunbar  where he gain'd the Reputation of a stout and active Officer  He married first  Jean  Daughter of  John  Earl of  Weems  by whom he had a Daughter  Mary  who died at  Panmure Anno  and again

William  Earl  Marshal  but by neither the other Lady nor the Countess  Marshal  had he any Children that came to Age  To  Patrick  Earl of  Panmure  succeeded  George  Lord  Brechin  his Son This noble Lord was too young to be engaged in the War when it first broke out during which Time he had his Education in  France  and  Italy  But by the Time King  Charles  II arrived  in  Scotland  in pursuant to the Treaty of  Breda  his Lordship being now of Age of Parts and undoubted Loyalty and Affection to the Crown waited on his Majesty his Father the old Earl being now struck in Years and troubled with the Infirmities of Age And assoon as the Parliament raised an Army for the King the Lord  Brechin  being a Nobleman not only firm to the Principles of Monarchy but also of great Duty and Affection to the Person of the King heartily engaged in the Service himself and endeavoured to dispose all those upon whom he had Influence to take the same Resolutions and it soon appeared his Interest in the Country was very great for his Lordship being appointed Colonel of the  Forfarshi  e  Regiment of Horse many of the principal Gentlemen engaged themselves in the Service and came to his Regiment out of Devotion and Respect to his Lordship as well as Duty to the King and served under him as Officers His Lordship was at the Head of his Regiment at the unsuccessful Battles of  Dunbar  and  Inverkeithing  at both which he fought with very remarkable Courage and at the last of these his Regiment behaved so well and suffered so much that he himself was wounded his Lieutenant Colonel and Major and many other of his Officers killed and when the Action was over his Soldiers were so dispersed that scarce sixty of them could ever be got together again But that Misfortune did not in the least discourage him from being every Way as active and forward again in advancing and conducing all he could toward his Majesty's Service for after the Coronation was over in which his Lordship assisted as a young Peer  Mr Douglass's Sermon preached at the Coronation of King Charles II first of January  when the Parliament appointed another Army to be raised for the Recovery of his other two Kingdoms  Scotland  being intirely united in his Majesty's Service no Body appeared more forward to advance the Work in Hand than the Lord  Brechin  in order to which his Lordship was one of those who met with old General  Lesly  Earl of  Levin  and several other Peers and Officers of Note at  Eliot  in  Augus  as a Place which was thought very favourable for making Levies which they all intended but they had not stay'd long there when the Lord  Brechin  gave it as his Opinion that the Place where they were had nothing for Defence and advised the General to draw further into the Country for their Security and told the General that he was not sure that if a Detachment from the Garrison of  Dundee  should make a brisk Attempt they might not be all surprised and taken out of their Beds But the General being of another Mind his Lordship who better knew the Country than any of the other Lords and so more sensible of the Danger to secure himself left the Committee and retired to  Sidlawhills  and it was soon evident what the Lord  Brechin  had advised was right for the very Evening of the Day or soon after he had left them the whole Committee was surprised and taken Prisoners by a strong Party of the  English  and sent to  London  and committed to the  Tower  where all of them except General  Lesly  underwent a long Imprisonment even till the Restoration of the King  The Lord  Brechin  being at Liberty in the  Hills  the Loyalists from all Quarters resorted to him after the Fight of  Worcester  and put themselves under his Command and his Lordship behaved in that Station very worthily and made often Skirmishes  N B When the Government was first alarmed by an Insurrection in the South in so soon as the Resolution was declared to raise an Army to suppress it they who had the chief Direction of Affairs did repose such Confidence both in the Earl of Panmnre's Loyalty and Skill in military Affairs that he was appointed to command the Gentry of Forfarshire but the Defeat at Pentland by General Dalziel prevented the raising that or any of the Northern Counties the Peace of the Kingdom being thereby secured  with the Enemy and sometimes with notable Advantage and made frequent Incursions in the Night into the  English  Quarters which gave General  Monk  some Trouble But being convinced of the Impossibility of keeping up an Attempt which at last must prove ruinous to himself and could do the King no Service he made his Peace with the General next Year without any other Compliance to the present Powers than the laying down his Arms and thereupon retired to his own House where he remained quietly prepared and disposed to run the Fortune of the Crown to which he was most entirely devoted in any other Attempt  When the King came Home in his Lordship repaired to  London  to congratulate his Majesty and the Royal Family upon their happy Restoration and tho' his Majesty received his Lordship with a very good Countenance yet he was not rewarded with any great Dignity or Preferment as was expected and with which some others were who had not been so faithfull to the King as the Earl of  Panmure  But as that was the Fate of very many of the loyal Party who had served the King with the utmost Fidelity as well as his Lordship so it was much more to be imputed to the Ministry than to the King himself For 'tis reported that some in great Credit with his Majesty endeavoured to instill into the King's Mind a Principle that he must prefer his Enemies and advance them to gain them to be his Friends and for his old Friends it was no matter how he used them for they would be so still And indeed it fell out so that very many who had suffered most in their Persons and Fortunes for the Crown were not recompensed upon the Restoration according to their Merit or considered as they deserved Of which Number this Noble Earl I may truly say was one of the most eminent Instances which mistaken Politick of the then Statesmen as it was observed thro' that whole Reign so many great and wise Men have thought that its being followed did bring no small Prejudice and Inconve  ence to the Crown thereafter But notwithstanding his Lordship was overlooked as to any Preserment yet he did not on that Account as many others did oppose himself to the Court but in all the Parliaments and National Conventions which were called while he lived and on which his Lordship constantly attended he always distinguished himself by a hearty Concurrence in whatsoever was proposed for advancing the Honour of the Crown and the Welfare and Happiness of the Kingdom which he made manifest by his several Speeches whereby he left behind him lasting Monuments of his great Knowledge in our Constitution and Laws of his unshaken Loyalty to his Prince and his intire Love to his Country insomuch as I have heard some eminent Men who were his Contemporaries speak of him with great Honour as a Nobleman in as high Reputation for his great Abilities and eminent Integrity as any Man of his Time and dying of  March  he was interr'd at  Panbride  with his Ancestors  This Noble Earl married  Jean  eldest Daughter of  John  Earl of  Lowdoun  Lord High Chancellor of  Scotland  in the Reign of King  Charles  I  by whom he had three Sons and a Daughter  viz  George  Lord  Maule  his Successor in the Honour  James Maule  of  Balumby  now Earl of  Panmure  Hary Maule  of  Kelly  who in his younger Years travelled into foreign Parts and spent much of his Time at the Courts of  France  and  England  At the Revolution he was a Member of the Convention of Estates which he left when he perceived they would forfeit King  James  and has never since been concerned in any publick Affairs having always continued a Nonjuror but in his Retirement has greatly improved his natural Parts by a close Application to the History and Laws of his Country He married first  Mary  Daughter of  William  Earl of  Wigton  by  Henrietta  his Wife Daughter of  Charles  Earl of  Dumfermling  Lord PrivySeal in the Reign of King  Charles  II by whom he had  George  who died an Infant  James Maule  Esq  William Maule  Esq  and two Daughters  Henrietta  who died

John  first Viscount of  Garnock  By her he had  Patrick John Thomas  and a Daughter  Margaret  all young and  David  and  Charles  who died Infants  Lady  Mary Maule  only Daughter of  George  Earl of  Panmure  was married first to  Charles  Earl of  Mar  and thereafter to Colonel  John Erskine  Son of Sir  Charles Erskine  of  Alva  George  Earl of  Panmure  being a young Nobleman of very bright and conspicuous Parts was by King  Charles  II when he came to Age call'd to his Majesty's Privy Council as he was likewise of the Council to King  James  He married  Jean  only Daughter of  John  Earl of  Wigton  by  Anne  his Wife Daughter of  Henry  Lord  Kerr  by whom he had a Son  George  Lord  Maule  who died an Infant whom the Earl himself did not long survive for Death overtook

he eminently signaliz'd his Courage insomuch as his Valour was very particulary taken Notice of  Upon his Accession to the Honour he was named one of the Lords of his Majesty's PrivyCouncil from which he was soon thereafter removed for not complying with the Design of the Court in taking away the penal Laws against Popery But tho' his Lordship did always shew himself very firm to the Protestant Interest thro' the whole of that Reign yet in the Convention of Estates he vigorously appeared for the Interest of King  James  and when the Crown was settled on King  William  and Queen  Mary  he left the Meeting and has since continued a Nonjuror  When the great Affair of the Union with  England  came to be considered in the Parliament tho' his Lordship did not think fit to qualify himself by taking the Oaths enjoined by Law to enter his Dissent against it in a Parliamentary Way as a Peer yet no Body was more heartily averse to it as appeared both from his meeting with the Principals of those who  were the most zealous Opposers of it and in promoting and influencing Addresses against it from the Places where his Interest lay judging it against the Honour and Interest of the Nation and subversive of the Sovereignty and fundamental Constitution of the Kingdom His Lordship married the Lady  Margaret  third and youngest Daughter of  William  and  Anne  Duke and Dutchess of

particularly the Marquis of  Argyle  who was his Lady's near Relation his Life was sp  r'd yet he continued a Prisoner till the Marquis of  Montrose  and the Committee of Estates came to a Capitulation whereby the Marquis was to depart the Kingdom which he did and thereupon several of his Friends were set at Liberty of which Number this worthy Person whose Memoirs I write was one Thereafter when the Parliament declar'd for the King and  ais'd an Army to relieve him when he was a Prisoner in the Isle of  Wight  no Body appear'd more forward in a prudent Way to advance that Enterprize than Sir  Archbald Primerose  which was afterward very gratefully remember'd by the Crown upon a more favourable Conjuncture  When Sir  Archbald  had the Honour of Knighthood confer'd on him I cannot say but I apprehend it was in the End of when he was set at Liberty that he waited on his Majesty when he put himself into the Hands of the  Scots  Army before  Newark  tho' I have not found him so designed in any Write for some Time after  Sir  Archbald  having continued his faithful Services to King  Charles  II the Time he remained in  Scotland  he likewise marched with him into

restoring the King and Kingdom  meaning  Scotland to its primitive Hon  ur and Interest  Ibid  and concluding he says  I with the same good Spirit may possess you to the End and with the same Success while we here endeavour to follow your Example which indeed hath already been of great Use to us  He was a great Lover of his Country which he alwise manifested for in the Matter of the Billoting in Parliament tho' he was the Parl of  Middleton  's Friend yet he could never be brought to favour that Project but opposed it with all his Power Which the Earl of  Middleton  did not resent against Sir  Archbald  well knowing as he himself owns that the Lord Register's opposing him in the Project of the Billoting did not proceed from any Dislike to his Lordships Person but from his known Principles of Moderation and the Earl did not only then acknowledge the Sincerity of the Register's Friendship to him but even afterwards at a Time when Professing to be the Lord  Middleton  's Friend was not thought very meritorious  Thereafter when the Ministry in that Reign did as was thought outface the Law by many bold Pressures upon the Subject Sir  Archbald Primerose  tho' he was courted to enter into a strict Union with them and that on his own Terms yet could never be induced to concur in any Thing that had not a sufficient Foundation in Law but rejected all Offers that were made for his own private Advantage that were not consistent with the Good of his Country and therefore he joined with those Lords who appeared most zealous for the Redress of Grievances which brought him so much into the Jealousy of the CourtParty that upon a very trivial Account he was together with the Duke of  Hamilton  the Earls of  Drumfrieze  and  Kineardine  and the Lord  Cochran  all in one Day turn'd out of the Council but the Resentment was carried further against the Lord  Carringtoun  and    a  Charta penes Comitem de Rosebery  many and very powerful Efforts were made to get him turned out of his Place too but his Majesty who had a great Esteem of him as a very wise Man and very worthy the Trust he had reposed in him could not for a long Time be prevail'd with to hearken to any Overture that could be made for his Removal till the Court Party which the King resolved to support did represent that it was necessary to have a Person in his Post in whom they could confide and that Sir  Archbald  being struck in Years he himself desired to exchange his Office with another of an easier Nature and upon this very Supposition and on no other Consideration did the King give Order for his Removal from the Register's Place and at the same Time p  efer'd him to be Justice General But he continuing still firm to his Party the Torrent against him ran so high that his Majesty who still retain'd a very great Kindness for and Esteem of him thought fit at length to take his Place from him to which Sir  George Mackenzie  of  Tarbat  a Person of great Honour and Worth was prefer'd the th of  October    Thereafter when the Differences run high betwixt the Two Parties the Duke of  Hamilton  the Marquis of  Athole  and the other Lords of that Side who desir'd the Grievances of the Nation might be redressed humbly petitioned the King for a Hearing in his own Royal Presence that the Matters in Difference might be more clearly understood and more freely transacted and his Majesty having granted their Desire thought fit to propose that some fit Persons might be allowed to treat with the like Number of the other Side in such a Manner as might best tend to compose all Things in a peaceable Way and Sir  Archbald Primer  s  being look'd on as a Person of the greatest Wisdom and Experience and one who throughly understood the whole Frame and Constitution of the Government in Church and State The Duke of  Hamilton  the Marquis of  Athole  the Earls of  Cassils Perth  and  Kincardine  Lieutenant General  Drummond  and the Lord  Cochran  well knowing how very useful Sir  Archbald  would be in the present Exigence did all conjunctly write very pressingly That he should hasten up to  London  to be present at the Conference which was to be in his Majesty's Presence and the Earl of  Perth  wrote him a most pathetical Letter lively representing the Dangers which threatned and were like to overwhelm the Nation if not prevented by a speedy Remedy that now they had an Opportunity of making their Country happy by removing all Grievances if he and others would do their Duty and therefore conjured him by many Arguments no longer to defer his Coming up and concludes with these Words  My Lord you see how  Scotland  is you see how your Friends Reputation lyes at Stake you see there is but this Pull for it and you see how fairly it lyes at your Hand The great God direct you toward doing what is for his Honour your Country's Good the King's Interest your Friends Reputation and your perpetual Credit  Sir  Archbald  thinking he had now a fair Opportunity of advancing the publick Good and doing all those Offices to his Country he had ever so earnestly desir'd and notwithstanding he was stricken in Years and troubled with the Infirmities of Age yet he undertook a Journey to  London  that he might be assisting in carrying on this good Work Both  Parties being heard before the King and his Majesty finding there could be no compounding this Dispute amicably but that one Side must be sup+press'd he resolved therefore in the End by the Advice of some in his nearest Confidence to dismiss the Lords of the Country Party without a present Redress forasmuch as it would reflect Dishonour upon his own Government if he did not ap+prove of the Administration of a great Minister whom he had so long employed in his Service and solely and entirely trusted in all that related to  Scotland  and  Scots  Affairs And now all Endeavours for Redress of the Nation's Grievances being render'd fruitless and to no Effect Sir  Arch+bald  with all convenient Expedition set out for  Scotland  and sickning in his Return died within a few Weeks thereafter on the th of  November    He married first  Elizabeth  Daughter of  James Keith  of  Benholm

Rymer's Foedera Angliae  but for some Reasons of State that Grand Affair could not be brought to a Close tho' 'tis not to be doubted but those great Men who had the Honour to be employed in the Treaty did all they could to have it concluded Thereafter in when the  English  carried over King  James  into  France  Abercromby's Life of King James I  to try if his Presence could draw the  Scots  who were in the  French  Service over to that of the  English  Sir  William Dou+glass  of  Drumlanrig  went over to wait on his Master in order to which he had a safe Conduct granted him from the King of  England  but with this remarkable  Proviso  that he should do nothing prejudicial to him or to his dearest Father the King of  France  but the  Scots  did well then distinguish the Deference which they owed to their King when captivated and when independent and free for tho' they sent Persons to guard his sacred Person yet they adhered firmly to that Interest which he seemed outwardly to oppose tho' I have no Reason to believe but that Sir  William Douglass  kept his Promise to the King of  England  and did not ingage against the  English  Interest at that Time yet he afterward lost his Life

born on the th of  December  after he had gone thro' the Course of his Studies at the University of  Glasgow  he went into Foreign Parts to accomplish himself by Travels  Anno  and upon his Return in was by King  Charles  II made one of the Privy Council and Lieutenant Colonel of a Regiment of Horse commanded by Lieutenant General  Graham  thereafter Viscount of  Dundee  and he continued in these Posts till the Year about which Time he quitted them for Ill Usage at Court and upon the Account of the Disagreement of his Principles with their Measures  The Revolution then happening to come on he appear'd early in it and was by the Prince of  Orange  upon his Acceptance of the Government made Colonel of the  Scots  HorseGuards and at the same Time one of the Privy Council and one of the Gentlemen of his Majesty's BedChamber  In the King  William  sent him into  Scotland  to command a separate Body of Troops under Lieutenant General  Mackay  Two Years after he was made one of the Lords of the Treasury and in the Parliament he was authorized to sit and vote as Lord High Treasurer his Father being then alive and he not a Peer could not otherwise sit but as an Officer of State which depends on the Sovereign's Nomination  The Duke his Father departing this Life as aforesaid in he laid aside all Thoughts of Military Employments quitted the Command of the Guards and was thereupon made Lord Privy Seal and one of the Extraordinary Lords of the Session  His Majesty in was pleas'd to make him Lord High Commissioner to represent his Royal Person in Parliament where he held Two Sessions by virtue of Two distinct Patents and upon his Return to Court his Majesty on the th  June  was pleas'd to honour the Duke with a distinguishing Mark of his Royal Favour for that Evening a Chapter being held of the most noble Order of the Garter at  Kensingtoun  where the Sovereign was present the Duke was then elected a Companion of the Order and install'd at  Windsor  the th of  July  thereafter His Grace having serv'd King  William  as long as he liv'd with great Fidelity her Majesty Queen  Anne  upon her Acc  ssion to the Throne first made him Secretary of State and entertaining the same just Sentiments of his Ability and Conduct appointed him to be her Commissioner to represent her Royal Person in that Session of Parliament which met at  Edinburgh  the th of  June  but the Legality of that Session meeting with great Opposition from a strong Party in the Parliament who declared openly that they did not conceive themselves warranted to meet and act in that Session as a Parliament  The Duke of Hamilton presented a Paper which contained the Reasons of his Dissent which may be seen at large in the History of Europe and the Memoirs of Scotland but is foreign to my Purpose to insert it here  and therefore did not only dissent from any Thing that should be done or acted therein but withdrew and remov'd from their Attendance Wherefore her Majesty to quiet the Minds of her People was pleas'd to order the Duke to prorogue the Parliament which his Grace did and thereupon set out for  London  where he was soon thereafter appointed One of the Commissioners upon the Part of  Scotland  for treating of an Union betwixt both Nations but tho' the Commissioners of the respective Kingdoms met several Times and settled Preliminaries on both Sides yet upon a more mature Deliberation the Court concluded that it was not a fit Season to promote that Business but to suspend the further Prosecution of it until a more favourable Conjuncture The former Parliament being dissolved it was necessary another should be call'd as had been usual at the Entrance of all Sovereigns to the Crown and therefore her Majesty issued out Writs for the Calling of a new Parliament which met according to Summons upon the th of  May  to which the Queen was pleas'd to honour the Duke of  Queensberry  by appointing his Grace to represent her Royal Person as Lord High Commissioner The Parliament being open'd with great Solemnity they began chearfully in passing an Act recognizing her Majesty's Title to the Crown but that Unanimity did not long continue among them for a very strong Party in the Parliament having brought in and carried an Act for the Security of the Kingdom presented it to the Lord Commissioner for the Royal Assent but the  Act of Security  being transmitted to the Court the  English  Ministry were so wholly averse to it and the Country Party in the Parliament of  Scotland  as strenuously insisting to have it pass all the Duke could well do in such a Conjuncture was to keep it off till he should receive Instructions from above which he did with the outmost Dexterity till her Maj  sty having declared that some Difficulties having fallen in in that Affair so much press'd she would take Time to consider them before she could be determined to give the Royal Approbation and therefore ordered the Lord High Commissioner to adjourn the Parliament on the th of  September  after they had sat full Three Months which the Lord Chancellor did in the usual Forms  How great soever these Services of the Duke's were esteemed to be for a Time yet 'tis certain that in less than a Year thereafter upon a Change of some Measures at Court his Grace was remov'd from all Publick Employments except that of one of the Extraordinary Lords of the Session which was for Life and of which he could not be deprived  But upon another Change at Court in the when the Duke of  Argyle  was declared Commissioner for holding the Session of Parliament that Year the Duke of  Queensbe  ry  was made Lord Privy Seal in Place of the Earl of  Rothes  and one of the  Commissioners of the Treasu  y 'Tis foreign to my Design to assign the Reasons here of the Change that was found in the Disposition of the  English  Ministry in Reference to the Act of Security which h  d passed in the Parliament from what it had been in the Session before wherein the Duke preceded as Lord High Commissioner However the forementioned Act of Security put the  English  Ministry under a Necessity of effecting the Union of the Two Kingdoms and in order thereto her Majesty being imp  wered by the Parliament in did nominate and appoint Commissioners to treat with those of  England  for uniting the two Kingdoms of which Number the Duke of  Queensberry  the Lord Privy Seal was one  The Commissioners of both Kingdoms having accordingly met at  London  on the th of  April  the Preliminaries were easily agreed to on the th The Two succeeding Months were taken up in carrying on of the Treaty and being much forwarded by her Majesty's Royal Presence and Recommendation to bring it to a Conclusion the Articles were compleated and signed on the d of  July  there  f  er  Tho' the Treaty of Union was concluded by the respective Commis+sioners of  Scotland  and  England  yet it b  hooved to be approven and con+fi  med by both Parliaments before it could be perfected and the Parliament of  Scotland  being to meet for that End the th of  Oct  ber  the Duke of  Queensberry  was pitch'd on as the fitte  Person to be her Majesty's Commissioner to bring that great Affair about in Parliament  So difficult and nice a Work as incorporating the Two Kingdoms could not be effected without very considerable Opposition both from within Doors and without but his Grace being supported by her Majesty's Authority and a f  ll and hearty Concu  re  ce of a Majority in the Parliament who were well affected to the Union went on vigorously in the Prosecution of his Duty and with so much Dispatch that the whole Treaty was enacted and ratified on the th of  January  by the Lord Commissioner by the Touch  f the Royal Scepter in the usual Manner  The Duke of  Queensberry  having thus concluded the Union and surmounted all the Difficulties he met in his Way to compleat it in  April  thereafter set out for  London  where he  ound that gracious Reception from the Queen which his eminent Services h  d deserved And it was but very just that he who had expended so much of his Time in the publick Service should have some suitable Compensation and therefore the Queen gave him the Compliment of a Pension of  L per Annum  out of the Fost Office Her Majesty's Goodness and Bounty did not stop here seeing she was pleas'd in  May  to create him a Peer of  Great Britain  by the Titles of Baron  Rippon  Ma  quis of  Beverly  and Du  e of  Dover  which Honours were to descend to the Earl of  Solloway  his second Son  The Queen continuing still her Royal Favours to his Grace was pleas'd on the th of  February  to declare in Council that by Reason of the Increase of the publick Business she thought fit to appoint a d Secretary of State of  Great Britain  and

this noble Family by perusing their Writings as I could have wished it cannot be reasonably expected but that my Memoirs of the House of  Rothes  should be less connected than others whose Line and Descent I deduced from the Writings of their own Families for tho' one Mr  Lesly  has set out a Book in  Germany  of the Name of  Lesly  he calls  Laurus Leslaeana  yet in his Accounts of the Families he treats of except  Balquhain  whose Writs it would appear he had seen and perused the rest especially  Rothes  is such a Mass of confused unchronological Stuff that no Man now a Days will venture to cite him for an Authority if he think he himself is to be believed and therefore I shall proceed to mention such Writs and Charters without Respect to the  Laurus Leslaeana  I either observed from our national Archives or otherwise as are proper to illustrate the Honour and Antiquity of this most noble Family  'Tis certain that the first Possessions of this illustrious Family was in  Aberdeen

there are several other concurring Writs in the Duke of Douglass's Hands fully clearing this Marriage  He is  one of the Barons in the Letter to the Pope  Anno  wherein the Independency of  Scotland  is very fully asserted and vindicated which is all I have found memorable of him A Successor of Sir  Andrew  was another Sir  Andrew Lesly  who in the First of King  Robert  III resign'd in the Sovereign's Hands the Lands and Barony of  Banbrech  in  Fife  the Lands of  Lour  and  Dulopy  in  Forfar  the Lands and Barony of  RotheyNorman  and  C  cychne  in  Aberdeen  Shire reserving the

without any Issue Male the Honour fell to his younger Brother  William  who was slain at  Pinky  leaving Issue by  Margaret  his Wife Daughter of  Michael Balfour  of  Montquhany George  his Successor and  John Lesly  of  Parkhill  Which  George  being a Nobleman of great Wisdom and Prudence was much esteemed by King  James  V who carried him over to  France  in the when his Majesty was espoused to  Magdalen  a Daughter of that Crown After whose Death during the Regency of the Duke of  Chattlerault  he was sent Ambassador to  Denmark  in which Negociation he behav'd himself with great Prudence and Dexterity and being look'd on generally throughout the Kingdom as a very wise Man he was named one of the Commissioners to go to  France  to the Queen's Marriage with the Dauphine where he died at  Deip  on the th of  November  not without Suspicion of being poisoned  I'm heartily sorry there are not such Documents in my Hands as should fully enable me to set the Marriages of this noble Earl in a true Light Mr  Lesly  gives the Preference to Lady  Margaret Crichton  as the Earl's first Lawful Wife tho' I think his Authority is little to be valued for 'tis clear from a Charter of  George  Earl of  Rothes  in the wherein he gives both  Nicolas Somervel  and  Margaret Crichton  a Liferent out of the same Lands Mrs  Somervel  is expresly call'd his Wife and is first mentioned before the other Lady who is no otherwise designed than by her Name tho' she was of much greater Quality of Birth than the other Yet 'tis also clear by another Charter in the That Lady  Margaret Crichton  is designed  Countess of Rothes  Charta in Pub Arch ad Annum  and then is certainly his lawful Wife For the clearing this Matter I shall humbly  offer my Opinion about it from such Writs as I have seen relative to it The Case I take to have been this The Earl of  Rothes  in the Heat of Youth and without a Dispensation according to the Rites of the Chuch for the Earl and the Lady were within the forbidden Degrees did uncanonically marry Lady  Mary Crichton  the Lord  Crichton  's Daughter which then in the Construction of the Law could not be valid without a Dispensation or the Children considered as begot in lawful Marriage tho' certainly the Earl thought otherwise himself for when  Norman  his Son by her was a very young Man he put him in Fie of his Estate and in all the Transactions afterwards about it upon his Forfaulture he's never designed the Earl's natural Son but only his Son simply and Fiar of the Earldom of  Rothes  And probably the Earl and the Lady disagreeing they chose to live separate or she left him and he married again as was commonly done in that Time  Nicholas Somervel  Daughter of Sir  John Somervel  of  Camnethan  and Widow of  John  Lord  Fleming  by whom he had  Andrew  his Father's Successor in the Estate and Honour and the Lady dying soon thereafter the Earl was again reconciled to Lady  Margaret Chrichton  and legally married her otherwise she could not have been as I observed she was designed Countess of  Rothes  and in this State of lawful Marriage she bare the Earl a Son  Robert Lesly  the Founder of the House of  Findrassy  and from his being Brother to  Norman  the Master of  Rothes  both of the same Father and Mother has the Mistake proceeded and the Story been patch'd up of his being as he is call'd the  righteous Rothes  for 'tis plain that  Norman  being forfaulted for the Murder of Cardinal  Beaton  his Father the Earl redeemed his own Estate again in the Terms he had made it over to him and so could not but in Justice settle it upon his Son  Andrew  who being indisputeably born in lawful Marriage was preferable to  Robert  who was not born of  Margaret Crichton  till very long after the Death of Dame  Nicholas Somervel  for 'tis plain at first the Earl had no other Son by  Margaret Crichton  but the aforesaid  Norman  Master of  Rothes  Andrew  Earl of  Rothes  so succeeding his Father was very faithful to Queen  Mary  throughout her whole unfortunate Life and was highly honoured by King  James  as a Nobleman of great Honour and Probity He married first  Jean  Daughter of Sir  James Hamilton  of  Evandale  by whom he had  James  Master of  Rothes  and  Andrew  Lord  Lindores  likewise Three Daughters  Margaret  married to  Archbald  Earl of  Angus    Eupham  to  James

Mary  tho' this Lord was a great Zealot for the  Roman  Catholick Religion and very devoted to the Queen yet no Body more heartily concur'd in the Preservation of the young Prince King  James  or contributed more to settle and establish him on the Throne and it ought not to be forgotten that the brought to the Battle of  Langside  to the Assistance of the Earl of  Marray  the Regent a greater Number of his Retainers and better appointed than any other Lord on the King's Side for his Interest and the Reputation of his Family in the Country was very great In Consideration of these his good

He was far from being of that Earl's Principles in Politicks for he was alwise a most devoted Servant of the Crown and tho' he was of that Religion that does not dispose Men to be the quietest Subjects yet when other  Roman  Catholick Lords entered into a Combination with the King of  Spain  to overturn the Reformed Religion in  Scotland  the Lord  Semple  would never meddle in any Degree with them which made the King alwise after love and esteem him as a Man to be depended on in Point of Honour and Loyalty In the his Majesty was pleased to send him Ambassador Extraordinary into  Spain  in which Negotiation he behaved with great Prudence and with the concurrent Testimony of his being a very wise Man and tho' King  James  had a great Value of him yet he could never employ him in any of the Civil Offices of the State because of his Religion which he never dissembled which considering his Parts few would have discharged with greater Sufficiency  He married first  Agnes  Daughter of  Hugh  Earl of  Eglingtoun  by whom he had  Hugh  his Successor also Four Daughters    Anne  married to Sir  Archbald Stewart  of  Castle  isk  and had Issue    Barbara  to Sir  Coll Laumont  of  I

Capacity than a private Gentleman He liv'd in great Splendor and Magnificence was alwise well attended with a very numerous and noble Equipage when he went abroad yet being a frugal Man he left his

most eminent and sublime Parts who to the great Joy of his Relations did quit the Superstitions of the Church of  Rome  in which he had been educated and embrac'd the Protestant Religion as practis'd in this Church and took his Place in the first Parliament of Queen  Anne Anno  in which and all the subsequent Sessions thereof he behaved himself with singular Honour and Integrity for tho' he was under very great Temptations and at the same Time had very considerable Offers made him if he would comply with the Measures of the Court in Relation to the Union yet nothing could corrupt him or make him swerve from what he thought was the Interst of his Country so that he gave the Union all the Opposition that was in his Power and voted against every Article of it and he was wont to say  That tho' the Union was attended with no other Inconveniency than the making the Peers elective he wonder'd very much how any of that Rank could be for it for being all Peers by Right of Inheritance their being made elective he took to be a divesting them of their Peerage because not being sure of being always chosen to every Par  iament of  Great Britain  they consequently must lose when left out the Benefit of sitting in Parliament what was ever deem'd an inseparable Right of the Peerage  Beside his Lordship there were also several other younger Children Captain  Robert Semple  who was kill'd

 William  Earl of  Orkney  and  Caithness  by  Elizabeth  his Wife Daughter of  James  Earl of  Douglass  but why he had so small a Share of his Father's Estate I cannot assign the Reason precisely 'Tis said  he was a very profuse Man and for that Reason his Father gave his Estate and the Title of Earl to a younger Son of his own by a Second Wife and the Barony of  Roslyn  to another Son of the

resolv'd to dispose of his Fortune to his other Children that little should have accompanied the Honour after his Death And therefore to do all he could in a prudent Way to preserve as far as in him lay the Memory of his Family he made over a good Part of his Estate to  Hugh Somervile  of  Drum  his Second Son  viz  The Lands of  Drum Gilmerton  and  Gutters Anno    Ibidem  and the old Man was not disappointed in his eldest Son for in few Years by an Excess in his Way of Living he so entirely consumed the whole Fortune that descended to him that when at his Death he was forc'd to leave the Honour to his younger Brother having no Male Child of his own to inherit it he left nothing to him to support it which made his Brother decline to take on him the Title tho' his Descendents have

we reckon they were first hereditarily affi  'd to Families at least with us was in the Reign of King  David  I for before that the most eminent Persons we find are distinguished either by some personal Appellative or Patronymically by the Name of the Father as is clear from the most ancient Writs that are extant and of which many Instances could here be given And that which further confirms this Opinion is That the very first Sirnames are all taken from Lands as  Douglass Hume Crawford Cathcart Dalrymple c  all which have been assumed from their own Lands by the then Proprietars when hereditary Appellations became customary  The First using this Sirname is  Adam de Dalrymple  who was possessed of the Barony of  Dalrymple  in  Air  shire in the Time of King  Alexander  III  There is a Charte  in the Rolls of King Robert II the first Year of his Reign Anno ratifying a  ant which Malcolm filius Gilchrist filius Adae de Dalrymple made of the Half of the Barony of Dalrymple to Sir John Kennedy and the Granter having then a Son John Dalrymple who ge  s a Charter about the same Time of the whole  Dominium  de Dalrymple 'tis no Stretch but a very modest Computation in Chronology to place Adam the Great Grandfather as high as  lexander the III's  me    Adam  was succeeded by  Gilchrist  his Son and he again by  Malcolm  his Son from whom sprang  John  and  Roland de Dalrymples  who had the Barony of  Dalrymple  divided betwixt them which their Heirs made over to Sir  John Kennedy  in the  Altho' the  Dalrymples  ceased to possess their old original Estate of  Dalrymple  yet some of them continued to make a very considerable Figure  Jacobus de Dalrymple  was  Clericus R  gis  in the Time of King  Robert  III  Charta in Pub Arch  and another  John de Dalrymple  of  Bolton  in the Time of King  James  II being a Man of Parts and Experience in Affairs was join'd in Commission with Dr  Nicol Otterburn  and sent upon a solemn Embassy to the Duke of  Burgundy  Ibidem ad Annum  to congratulate that Prince for their joint Prosperity  The Family of  Stair  to which I shall now confine my Memoirs of the  Dalrymples  has of a long Time been consider'd as the chief Family of all the  Dalrymples  They came first to possess the Barony of  Stair  which lies near to  Dalrymple  in Right of  Marjory  the Daughter and Heir of Sir  John de Montgomery  The Montgomeries of Sta  were certainly one of the ancientest and best Extracted Families in Air shire I observe that  an de Mundegumbri del Cont de Air their Ancestor is in the Rogman Roll or the Submission of the Scots Barons to King Edward I of England Anno  who brought i  to her Husband  Malcolm de Carrick  the Son of  Henry  the Son of  Fergus  a Branch of the old Earls of that Name and Title for tho' the Earldom of  Carrick  went very long before to the  Bruces  by Marriage yet the Sirname was carried on by several Male Branches for beside this  Malcolm  afore mentioned there was at this Time another  Malcolm de Carrick  of  Newbigging  He is designed Filius Joannis filius Negeli de Carrick Charta penes me ad Annum  and a  John de Carrick  who was Chancellor of  Scotlan    both in the Reign of King  David

Heir married first to  Ronald de Shanks  but being left a Widow by him without any Issue she married again a Gentleman of the Name of  Kennedy  by whom he had a Daughter  Agnes  at length the sole Heir of the Barony of  StairMontgomery  who was married to  William Dalrymple  Esq  the paternal Ancestor of this noble Family But Mr  Dalrymple  and the Lady standing in the Degrees of Consanguinity pro+hibited by the Laws of the Church then in Force the Marriage did proceed upon a Dispensation granted by Bishop  Kennedy  of  St Andrews  Charta penes Comitem de Stair ad Annum  by a Delegation from the Pope to that Effect By the said  Agnes  his Wife he left Issue  William Dalrymple  of  Stair  his Son who married  Mar  on  Daughter of Sir  John Chalmers  of  Gadgirth  a Lady o  great Piety and Virtue  Knox's History mentions this Lady whose Name he mistakes and calls Isobel was summoned before the Bishop of Glasgow's Court as one of the Lollards of Shyle in and was a Lady of excellent Worth and Virtue  by whom he had a Son who died before himself but left a Son  William  who being his Grandfather's Heir apparent the old Man in made over his Estate to him reserving such a Provision for himself and  is Wife as supported them during their joint Lives  Charta in Pub Arch  which they did not long survive This last mentioned  William  married  Margaret  Daughter of  Wallace  of  Ca  rnhill  Ibidem  and had by her  James  his Son and Heir who in the Beginning of the Reign of Queen  Mary  was among the very First of any Account who made open Profession of the Protestant Religion to which he always continued very firm and constant In the Year he joined with the Earls of  Lennox  and  Glenca  rn  against the Governor the Earl of  Arran  whom the Protestants pretended was not then altogether so zealous for the Reformation as he had been at first and was at the Conflict on  Glasgow  Moor for which he got afterward from the Duke of  Chattlerault  the Regent a Remission  for his being in Feir of Weir at the unlawful Convocation of the Queen's Leidges on the Moor of  Glasgow  with  Matthew  sumetime Earl of  Lennox  and  William  Earl of  Glencairn  Ibidem ad Annum  He married  Isobel  Daughter of  George Crawford  of  Lochnorris  by whom he had  James  his Son and Heir who with his Father's other Virtues inherited his Zeal for the Protestant Religion for as soon as a Confession of Faith was compil'd by our Reformers and ratified by Act of Parliament he was one of those who sign'd it and enter'd into a solemn Association for the Defence of the Tree Reform'd Religion as it was then publickly professed in the Kingdom  Knox's History  In the we find he was one of those who with the Duke of  Chat  lerault  and others opposed the Queen's Marriage with the Lord  Darnley  by Reason of the Danger they apprehended might arise to Religion by that Union but the Duke sailing in the Attempt he made to seize  Darnley  and to send him to  England  his Adherents were oblig'd to take Remissions for it the Laird of  Stair  's I have seen in  Charta in Rotulis Priva  Sigilli ad Annum for Treason and assisting the Duke of Chattlerault to defend the Castles of Drassan and Hamilton against the Queen  s Authority  Soon after this when the Nation was alarmed with the Murder of the Lord  Darnley  the Queen's Husband and the Measures that were then taken no Body appear'd more zealous in a prudent Way than this Gentleman for the Safety of the young  Prince King  James  VI and the Preservation of the Protestant Religion for we find he was one of the many Barons who together with the Bulk of the Nation entred into that famous Association  Bond at Edinburgh  wherein they  bind themselves to Inaugurate the Prince and with all their Strenth and Forcis promote concur fortifie and assist to the promoting and establishing him in his Kingdom and Government as becumis Faithful and Trew Subjects to do to their Prince and to resist all sick as would oppon them

Dalrymple  of  Stair  who by  Janet  his Wife Daughter of  Fergus Kennedy  of  Knockdaw  had  James  the first Viscount of  Stair  This excellent Person was born in  May    Charta in Pub Arch  his Father dying when he was very young He was by the singular Care and Affection of his Mother well brought up and at a proper Age having been taught his Humanity at the best Schools in the Country was sent to the University of  Glasgow  where having run through his Course of Philosophy with great Application and Success he took the Degree of Master of Arts in the The Civil War breaking out soon thereafter Mr  Dalrymple  betook him+self to the Service of the Parliament and had a Company of Foot bestow'd on him in the Earl of  Glencairn  's Regiment While he was a Captain upon the earnest Sollicitation of some of the Professors of  Glasgow  upon the falling vacant of a Philosophy Chair in that University he was prevail'd on to stand a Candidate at a comparative Trial for the Post to which he was preferred with great Applause and he successfully perform'd that Provence for some Time and bred several Schollars who prov'd afterward very eminent both in Church and State While Mr  Dalrymple  continued in this Station he studied the  Greek  and  Latin  with the History and Antiquities of  Greece  and  Rome  the better to qualifie him for the Study of the Civil Law to which he betook himself and wherein he made a very eminent Progress  Mr  Dalrymple  being esteemed a Man of great Parts and good Address was employ'd by the University to sollicite Grants for the Increase of their Revenues and other Affairs which led him to see the Form of Proceedings in the Courts of Justice and brought him to be known and acquainted with the great Men who were then at the Head of Affairs and the most eminent Lawyers both on the Bench and at the Bar At length in the Beginning of the Mr  Dalrymple  with these useful Preparations and Advantages entred an Advocate and in short Time Time became very eminent in his Profession for his Abilities and Reputation for Judgment and Integrity in so much as when the Parliament proclaimed King  Charles  II and named certain Commissioners to go over to  Breda  to treat with him about his coming to the Exercise of his Royal Power Mr  Dalrymple  was pitch'd on to be Secretary to the Committee whereby he had an Opportunity to be known to the King and the great Men about the Court who were very well pleased with the Abilities Sincerity and Moderation he shew'd in the whole of his Demeanour on that critical Occasion for which the King did ever afterward esteem him and was pleased to express himself very obligingly of him even at the Time when he was prevail'd on by his Ministers to remove him from the Presidentship  of the Session as being in no Degree a Friend to the Designs then on Foot And I cannot but remark that tho' Mr  Dalrymple  was then but a young Lawyer yet he was so well esteem'd for his Knowledge in the Laws that the Parliament in his Absence while he was in  Holland  nam'd him one of the Commissioners to revise the Laws Acts of Parliament and Practice of the several Judicatures but what Advances they made in that Matter is to me unknown  Mr  Dalrymple  return'd with the Commissioners before the King in the and so soon as his Majesty arrived he waited on him at his first Landing and was very well receiv'd and thereafter in the Cou  se of Affairs he used his outmost Endeavours and did all he could to unite all Parties for his Majesty's Service especially in the grand Affair of raising an Army to invade  England  upon which all the Hope of his Restauration depended  After the Defeat of the Royal Party at  Worcester  Mr  Dalrymple  continued his Practice in the Law during the U su  pation till the Oath called the  Tender  abjuring the Royal Family of the  S  e  arts  was imposed that he and most of the eminent Men of that Profession withdrew from the Bar till  Cromwel  thought fit by some Act of Connivance to dispense with it and a Correspondence being made up betwixt the Bench and the Bar we find Mr  Dalrymple  was one of the Four deputed by the Faculty of Advocates to declare to the Judges  That it was their Opinion That for the better Administration of Justice to restore the ancient Form of the OuterHouse which had been supprest  and which they accordingly thought fit to comply with  Mr  Dalrymple  still increasing in Reputation and Practice he was upon the Death of Judge  Learmont  of  Balcomy  pitch'd on by General  Monk  with Consent of the Protector's Council to be his Successor and the Choice proceeded merely upon the Fame of his Abilities and Integrity and he was far from seeking after the Employment he having no Inclination to have any Office under that Administration but there being such an universal Desire of the People that the Post should be fi  led with a  Scotsman  and a Person eminent for Integrity and Knowledge of the Laws and being importun'd from People of all Ranks and Perswasions he was at last perswaded to accept of the Place and so he suffered himself to be made one of the Judges without any other Compliance with the then prevailing Powers than taking the Oath  de fideli Administratione  as the Act of his  Admission  bears  July  st While this worthy Judge continued in this Station he took all Opportunities that offered to serve his Country and to do all the good Offices he could for his Friends with those in Power in getting Grievances redressed which as it mightily increased his Reputation and very much recommended him to Men of all Degrees so it brought him into a particular Acquaintance with General  Monk  who had a great Esteem and Value for him insomuch as the Day before he marched with his Army to  England  he reposed so much Considence in Judge  Dalrymple  as a very wise Man and of an excellent Understanding that he call'd him to a private Conference and desired he would give his Opinion freely what he thought was the likeliest Way to settle the Three Nations To which he readily answered  That the wisest and fairest Way was to procure a free and full Parliament to be called  and at the same Time he very earnestly recommended to the General to interpose at  London  for setting the Courts of Justice a going which were then stopped by reason of the Disorder and Discomposures of the Times which Counsel the General followed as appears from his Letter to Judge  Dalrymple  dated  from  Dunstable  the th Day of  Janu+ary    Upon the Restauration Mr  Dalrymple  went up with the Earl of  Cassils  to  London  to pay his Duty to the King and congratulate his Majesties happy Restauration and the King the first Time Mr  Dalrymple  waited on him was graciously pleased as a Mark of his Favour to make him a Knight and as a further Testimony of the Trust and Confidence he reposed in him named him one of the Senators of the College of Justice at the first Settlement of that Judicature in the Year and in  November  thereafter the Lord President Sir  John Gil+moir  being call'd up to  London  the Lords applied to the Earl of  Middleton  his Majesty's Commissioner to name a President in the Absence of the President and his Grace was pleased to name the Lord  Stair  to be VicePresident And I cannot fail to remark that the Lords themselves had such an Esteem for the Lord  Stair  that they ever choos'd him VicePresident as often as Sir  John Gilmoir  's Health or other Occasions hinder'd him to be present except once when he was at  London  in the WinterSession as one of the Commissioners for the Treaty that was then set on Foot betwixt the Two Nations  The Parliament having appointed an Oath to be taken called  The Declaration  by which all who were in Publick Offices were oblig'd to declare against defensive Arms and the Conduct of the late Troubles particularly against the National Covenant as explain'd in the Year and the Solemn League and Covenant entred into betwixt the Two Nations in as contrary to the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom This caused no small Uneasiness to the Lord  Stair  some Things being in the Oath disagreeable to his Principles and withal being absent in the Country at his Mother's FuneralObsequies when the rest of the Lords subscribed the Declaration they acquainted him  That the King in his Letter to the Privy Council had ordered the Places of such of the Lords as did not sign the Declaration by a precise Day should be declared Void and that no written Explanation or Declaration should be admitted which would look like the stating of a Party  To which the Lord  Stair  return'd Answer excusing his not Compliance for that he had sent his Demission to the King before the Date of the Letter Whereupon the Lords declared his Place vacant on the th of  January    The Lord  Stair  being thus at Liberty took a Tour into  France  with  John  his eldest Son who then about Sixteen Years of Age began to travel for his Improvement and my Lord  Stair  returning by the Way of  London  and having had the Honour to wait on the King his Majesty was pleased to tell him that he would not accept of his Demission and allow'd him to clear or explain his Mind in what Sense he would take the Declaration and accordingly his Lordship having satisfied his Majesty the King by a Letter to the Lords signified  That bei  g well satisfied with Sir  James Dalrymple  of  Stair  one of their Number his clearing himself in the Matter of the Declaration and of his Affection to his Service and of his great Abilities to serve in that Station therefore it was his Pleasure that the Lord  Stair  signing the Declaration continue in his Place as if the Demission had never been made  Upon Receipt of the Letter and Sir  James  's signing the Declaration the Lords rescinded their former Act declaring his Place void and he took his Place on the Bench again at the sitting down of the SummerSession About this Time his Majesty as a further Mark of his Royal Favour to the Lord  Stair  was pleased to create him a Knight Baronet and to the Heirs Male of his Body for ever  In the when a Treaty was set on Foot for uniting the Two Kingdoms of  Scotland  and  England  the Lord  Stair  was named one of the Commissioners for that important Affair and tho the Treaty did not take Effect yet the Lord  Stair  in the several Discourses that passed on that Subject gave such clear Proofs of his great Knowledge in our Constitution and the Laws that the next ensuing Year Sir  John Gilmoir  Lord President resigning his Office his Majesty was pleased to confer it upon him and his Promotion was not attended with any Envy or Dislike so far as I have ever heard  As my Lord  Stair  was a great Lover of his Country and had the true Interest of it always very much at Heart so he embraced every Opportunity to promote and advance the Good of the Nation for it was the Lord President and several other Patriots who concur'd with him who represented to the Duke of  Lauderdale  upon his coming down in the several Abuses and illegal Practices that had been committed and the Duke thereupon was pleased to get several Acts of Council made correctory of these Abuses particularly that of citing Persons for ChurchIrregularities without libelling special Circumstances of Time and Place which was very ill taken and highly resented by the Archbishop of  St Andrews  and several of his Highflying Brethren  My Lord  Stair  did with the same Fidelity labour to disswade the Duke from bringing in the  Highland  Host upon the West and from obtaining an Order of Council for a Bond to be taken for discovering apprehending and bringing to Judgment  Presbyterian  Ministers who held Conventicles But tho' he did not prevail in this Point yet the Lord President could never be induc'd either to subscribe the Bond or approve the  Highland  Inroad for Reasons founded both in Law and Religion  When his Royal Highness the Duke of  Albany  came down to  Scotland  in the End of the the Lords of the Session and other Members of the College of Justice thought it their Duty to wait on his Highness at the  Abbay  of  Holyroodhouse  when the Lord President made a fine congratulatory Speech in the Name of the Society wherein among other Expressions he had one to this Effect  That it was a Matter of great Joy to the Nation to see one of the Royal Family among them after being for so many Years depriv'd of that Honour and the Nation being intirely Protestant it was the fittest Place his Highness could make his Recess to at that Time  His Lordship did afterward with a becoming Freedom and the ourmost Fidelity disswade his Highness not to attempt any Thing that might seem to have the least Tendency to weaken the Establishment of the reform'd Religion as it was secur'd by the Laws In the Parliament to which his Royal Highness the Duke of  Albany  was his Majesty's High Commissioner the Lord President was chosen a Member for the Shire of  Wigtoun  In the Beginning of the Session his Lordship the Earl of  Argile  and several others were named on a Committee of the Articles for Religion which by the Custom of all  Scots  Parliaments was the first Thing treated of Accordingly the Committee did prepare an Act securing the Protestant Religion which Act did ratifie the Act approving the Confession of Faith and also the Act containing the Coronation Oath appointed by several standing Laws and Acts of Parliament to be taken by our Kings before their Entry to the Exercise of the Government But this Draught which the Committee had prepar'd was laid aside in respect it was thought to limit too much the Power of a Popish Successor to the Crown in Place whereof a general Statute did pass ratifying all former Laws for settling and securing the  Liberty and Freedom of the Protestant Religion However when the Act  asserting the Right of Succession to the Crown according to the Proximity of Blood without Respect to any Difference in Religion  did pass it was thought expedient even by those who promoted it to have a more special Law made for Security of the Protestant Religion Accordingly a D  aught of the Act about Religion was transmitted to the Parliament which provided only for the Preservation of the Protestant Religion as contained in the Word of GOD which could not discover Papists who pretend to walk conform to that Rule The Lord  Stair  the Earl of  Argyle  and other Patriots were forward to have a particular Standard of the Protestant Religion established that might more effectually prevent  Roman Catholicks  getting into Publick Offices in the Event of a Popish Prince upon the Throne and the Lord President urged the Matter with so much Strength of Reason that the first Clause in the  Test  which was agreed to did exclude all Persons from Publick Trust in the Government who did not swear  That they own'd and sincerely professed the true Protestant Religion contain'd in the Confession of Faith recorded in the Parliament    and that they believed the same to be founded on and agreeable to the written Word of GOD and that they should adhere thereunto all the Days of their Lifetime and educate their Children therein and that they should never consent to any Change or Alteration contrary thereunto  Tho' the Act passed yet the urging of that Clause by the Lord President was highly re  ented by his Royal Highness the Duke of  Albany  the Lord High Commissioner who the very Night the Act passed said to some about him and in his nearest Confidence  That the Lord  Stair by bringing in the Confession of Faith into the  Test had ruined all honest Men  meaning  Roman Catholicks  Tho' the Lord President was pleased with the first Part of the TestAct which seem'd to be a very effectual Security against Popery yet he could not sign the latter Part of it which struck against  Presbyterian  Dissenters therein call'd  Fanaticks  and therefore he went up to the King to declare so much and to desire his Majesty's Leave to retire and to lay down his Employment but before he arrived at  London  his Behaviour in the Parliament was improv'd as so heavy a Charge against him at Court that he was remov'd from his Office in the Session without mentioning of any Cause tho' he held his Place in the ordinary Way of Judges  ad vitam aut culpam  But his Remove from his Place was not all he was like to suffer for after that he was not allowed to live without Disturbance in his Retirement at his Seat in the Country for his Tenents were harassed with grievous Fynes for Nonconformity and he got a Hint from his Friend Sir  George Mackenzie  the Lord Advocate that he could not secure him that he might not be thrown in Prison My Lord  Stair  finding himself in these Circumstances thought it safer for him to retire and to go into a voluntary Exile into  Holland  in the End of where he printed his  Philosophia nova Experimentalis  which as it gain'd him great Reputation with the Learned so 'tis generally read with great Applause  While the Lord  Stair  was abroad many Witnesses were examined and reexamined not only his own Domesticks but some of his nearest Relations to find out Matter for a Criminal Pursuit against him but nothing was discovered save that some Persons suspected to have been engaged in the Rebellion liv'd upon his Ground or lu  ked about his House in the Country while he attended on the Session at  Edinburgh  However he was pursued for Treason first before the Justiciary  and then before the Parliament upon the common Ground of Harbour and Reset of Rebels But the Probation was so scrimp that by their own Rules they could not condemn him for he was a wise Man and had taken Care to live with all possible Circumspection and Caution  The Lord  Stair  sojourn'd in  Holland  till the he came over with the Prince of  Orange  in his Expedition to  Britain  to relieve these Nations from Popery and Arbitrary Power in which glorious Design no Man engaged more frankly than the old Lord  Stair  And when the Prince was just setting Sail for  England  'tis reported his Lordship took the Freedom to ask his Highness  What his true Design was in going to  England To which the Prince was pleased to answer  That he designed the Glory of GOD and the Security of the Protestant Religion  Upon which 'tis said the Lord  Stair  pulled off his Wig and said  Tho' I be now in the    th Year of mine Age I'm willing to venture that  meaning his Head  and his own and his Childrens Fortunes in such an Undertaking  This the Prince took in very good Part and reported it to others as that which very much encouraged him to prosecute his Design  When the Prince landed at  Torby  his Highness expressed a particular Concern about the Lord  Stair  and sent to enquire concerning his Health and understanding his Horses were not come up the Prince sent him Horses of his for his Accomodation  Upon the Advancement of the Prince and Princess of  Orange  to the Throne their Majesties who had a very great Kindness and Esteem for the Lord  Stair  as a Person of great Integrity and of unquestionable Zeal for the Protestant Religion were pleased to restore him to his Office of President of the Session in the conform to the  Claim of Right  But their Majesties thought this Piece of Justice was not enough to reward the Lord  Stair  's great Merit wherefore they were further pleased to raise him to the Peerage by the Stile and Title of Viscount of  Stair  by Letters Patent bearing Date th  April  after which his Lordship continued without the least Interruption in the favour of his Prince and enjoyed his Office which he had discharged in all Times with great Abilities and singular Integrity till his Death which happened on the th of  November  aged and was with great Funeral Solemnity interred in the Cathedral Church of St  Giles  This excellent Person married  Margaret  eldest Daughter of  James Ross  of  Balneel  with whom he had a fair Fortune in Land and had Issue by her  Sir  John Dalrymple  thereafter Earl of  Stair  Sir  James Dalrymple  of  Borthwick  who being a Person of great Parts and Learning was bred to the Law and became an Advocate and was afterward made one of the principal Clerks of the Session and a Baronet Sir  James  's Genius even from his Youth having led him to the Study of Antiquities  My noble and very worthy Friend Sir James Dalrymple did collect and furnish Sir George Mackenzie with the most of the Materials of what he wrote in Defence of the Royal Line and his Jus Regium tho' without any Acknowledgment to his Friend Mr Dalrymple which I and many others have wondred at when it was so well known at that Time Sir James has also publish'd a new Edition of Cambden's Britannia wherein he gives us the first right Draught of the Line of the Royal Family of the Stewarts and rescued it from the Blunders and Mistakes of all that ever wrote before him which is such an eminent and notable Service to the Crown and his Country that ought never to be forgotten but gratefully remembred to his Honour and the Honour of his Memory for I can well say that all that has been advanced since on the History of the Royal Family are but Superstructures upon that Foundation which Sir James has there laid down  particularly those of his  own Country he became a wonderful Proficient and one of the Learnedst Men of that Prof  ssion of which his Book  Collections concerning the Scots History  is a pregnant Instance a Book full of Learning and that Learning so closely and solidly applied that it has justly gain'd him a very great Reputation with learned Men as one of the greatest Antiquaries this or indeed any other Age has produc'd  Sir  Hugh Dalrymple  of  Nort  berwick  Baronet who likewise applying himself from his Youth to the Study of the Law commenced Advocate and advancing daily in Reputation and Practice after he had been some time one of the Commissaries of  Edinburgh  he was in the promoted to be Lord President of the Session which had been vacant from the Death of his Father Here is a large Field to expatiate upon the great Learning and other Qualities of this Gentleman but he being still alive I shall entirely wave it  Dr  Thomas Dalrymple  first Physician in Ordinary to his Majesty for the Kingdom of  Scotland  Sir  David Dalrymple  of  Hailes  Baronet who being a Person of incomparable Parts and having studied the Law in his younger Years came to the Bar with great Applause and growing very eminent in Reputation and Practice insomuch as her Majesty Queen  Anne  was pleased to make him Sollicitor and then Lord Advocate from which Office he was removed toward the End of that Reign but upon the Accession of King  George  to the Crown he was restored to his former Digaity which he at present enjoys with the universal Approbation of the whole Nation and the general Applause of all Men for his Justice Integrity sound Judgment and eminent Sufficiency in the Discharge of his Office a Praise which was never denied him at any Time  Janet  eldest Daughter of  James  Viscount of  Stair  was married to  David Dunbar  Son and Heir apparent to Sir  David Dunbar  of  Buldoon  Bart but had no Issue    Elizabeth  to  Allan  the present Lord  Cathcart    Sarah  to  Charles  Lord  Crichton  Son and Heir of  William  Earl of  Dumfreis    Isobel  to Sir  David Cuninghame  of  Miln  raig  Bart and had Issue  John  first Viscount thereafter Earl of  Stair  was by the Care of his Father though his eldest Son bred to the Study of the Law and being admitted to the Bar in short Time became very eminent in Practice insomuch as when the Earl of  Argyle  was pursued for High Treason in the for his giving an Explanation of the Test when he took it Sir  John Dalrymple  who was by this Time very much taken Notice of as a Lawyer of great Ability and Learning was one of the Earl's Council But quickly after this the Court conceiving a Displeasure against the Lord  Stair  Sir  John  's Father and it being well known that his own Principles were altogether against the Measures that were then taken they had a very jealous Eye upon him and he became so much the Object of their Envy that in the End of the upon Pretence that he as heritable Baillie of the Regality of  Glenlace  interfeiring in Jurisdiction with the new nam'd Justiciar and She  iff of  Galloway Graham  of  Claverhoase  had fined his own and his Father's Tenents too low for haunting Conventicles and tho' he had never meddled in any publick Matters yet he was committed Prisoner to the Castle of  Edinbargh  and fined in  lib sterl  but being set at Liberty he was again in the upon various Pretences seiz'd on at his own House in the Country and tho' the Officer that apprehended him brought him to the  Abbay  of  Holy ro  d house  in Expectation that he might have been  bail'd Yet so great was the Torrent against him that tho' they could not find any Ground of Accusation whereupon to found an Indictment yet he was committed to the Tolbooth of  Edinburgh  where he lay three Months and for some Weeks was a close Prisoner  Tho' Sir  John Dalrymple  was very much frown'd on at this Time by the Court he would by no Means forego his Principles tho' his Wisdom and Experience put him upon acting circumspectly and with great Caution during the Remainder of King  Charles  his Reign But after King  James  's coming to the Crown that Prince upon his own Observation of Sir  John Dalrymple  's Abilities in his Pleadings as a Lawyer was pleased to conceive a very good Opinion of him insomuch as he was pleased to make him Lord Advocate upon the Removal of Sir  George Mackenzie  who was laid aside in the for not complying with the Design of the Court in taking away the penal Laws against Popery tho' it could never be said by Sir  John Dalrymple  's greatest Enemies that he had in any Degree contributed thereto but on the contrary endeavour'd all he could to animate the Members of Parliament to stand firm to their Religion and not to open a Door to let in Popery and many other Inconveniencies Sir  John  behav'd with great Moderation and Temper while he held that Office but Sir  George Mackenzie  having found Means to reconcile himself to the Court he was restored to be Advocate and Sir  John Dalrymple  was thereupon made JusticeClerk upon a Vacancy thro' the Demise of Sir  James Foulis  of  Colingtoun  and he continued in the Office till the Government was disso  v'd by King  James  's leaving  England  and retiring to  France  Sir  John Dalrymple  being a very zealous Protestant all the Favours he had confer'd on him by King  James  and others he might have expected were no Temptations to bring him into the CourtMeasures at that Time and the Revolution coming about he fell heartily in with it and with those who were the most zealous Promoters of it  In the Convention of Estates Sir  John Dalrymple  shewed himself a steady Asserter of the Religion and Liberties of his Country and particularly expressed on that Occasion a hearty Desire that a Treaty might be set on Foot for a nearer Union of the Two Nations But that Design meeting with Opposition from Persons of very different Principles it was dropt at that Time and when the grand Affair of settling the Crown came to be debated the Estates found at first great Difficulty how to declare the Throne vacant at length Sir  John Dalrymple  ended the Debate by such Reasons that the Convention went into his Proposals and settled the Crown upon the Prince and Princess of  Orange  So soon as it passed into an Act he was one of the Commissioners sent up from the Convention with the Offer of the Crown to the Prince and Princess of  Orange  with the Nations Grievances and Claim of Right which their Highnesses having accepted of they were graciously pleased to reward Sir  John  's Merit and Zeal shown for their Advancement to the Throne by making him Lord Advocate in and in less than a Year thereafter he was constituted one of the Principal Secretaries of State and he discharged the Office with eminent Sufficiency till the that the Parliament having made some Attempts against him about the Affair of the horrid Massacre of  Glenco  he resigned his Place merely that the King might not be made uneasie by his continuing in so eminent a Post so near his Royal Person tho' his Majesty did highly resent the Treatment the Secretary had met with and turn'd all those out of his  Service who had been the greatest Sticklers against him  Tho' the Master of  Stair  did not think he had been well used yet he never shewed the least Resentment against the Court but on the contrary by his great Wisdom and Temper interposed to moderate the Heats and Animosities which arose both in the Parliament and in the Country upon the Disappointments of  Darien  and the Figure he made in the publick Debates by his Speeches in Parliament were sufficient to convince every Body that he might have been employed again in some of the highest Offices of State but he constantly declin'd Preferment for he was resolv'd never to be further concern'd in publick Affairs than as a Privy Councellour  et at the same Time not to omit what he really thought his Duty to his Country upon any Occasion  When Queen  Anne  came to the Crown the Viscount of  Stair  was named on of the Lords of the Privy Council and as a further Testimony of her Majesties Favour was raised to the Honour of Earl of  Stair  by Letters Patent the th of  April    Charta in p  b Archi  is    The Earl of  Stair  had from his Youth entertained an Opinion That an intire Union of both Kingdoms was the most likely Way to procure the lasting Tranquillity and Happiness of  Britain  and for that End very readily concurred in the Session of Parliament that Power should be given to the Queen to name Commissioners to treat of an Union pursuant to which Commissioners were n  med by h  r Majesty of which Number the Earl himself was one But that Treaty breaking off without coming  o any Conclusion it had no other Effect than  o let bo  h Nations s  e it w  s practicable and it being ag  in resumed in the by new Authority from the Parliament of both Kingdoms his Lordship was by her Majesty named one of the Commissioners upon the Part of  Scotland  in the carrying on of which he had so considerable a Share both in the Time of the Treaty and in the Parliament of  Scotland  that many have thought that without the Earl of  Stair  it could not have been brought to a Conclusion considering the many Difficulties were raised against it all which he just liv'd to see overcome for being exceedingly sollicitous to have the Union perfected he assisted the Day before his Death at the Debates on that Subject in the Parliament pressing the Point with great Earnestness And tho he walked home and dined very chearfully with Company yet about Four next Morning he  ll into an Apoplexy which in a few Hours put an End to his Days the th of  January  aged  He married  Elizabeth  Daughter and Heir of Sir  John Dundas  of  NewListon  by whom he had  John  the present Earl of  Stair  Colonel  William Dalrymple  of  Glenmure George Dalrymple  Esq  one o  the Barons of Exchequer also a Daughter  Margaret  married to  Hugh  Earl of  Loudoun  John  the present Earl of  Stair  was born at  Edinburgh  the th of  July  He gave very early Marks of a lively and great Genius having succeeded beyond his Fellows in his first Studies of Latin and Greek both at home and in  Holland  whether at the Desire of his Grandfather then at  Le  den  our young Student was sent when he was about Eleven Years old In a very few Months he acquired the Habit of speaking  French  and  Dutch  in both which he has been since improved to a Degree of Perfection to which seldom any Stranger has attained His Masters at  Leyden  were exceedingly pleased with him and remaked that though he seem'd fond of Play and solicited his Fellows to it yet he was never found  out of his Place at School But while he seemed thus devoted to his Play he advanc'd in his Learning as if he had minded nothing else He was promoted from Class to Class with the Approbation of the Magistrates Professors and Masters of the School at  Leyden  and had one of the first  Praemiums  at every Promotion according to the Custom of that School for distinguishing the Merit of the best Scholars and for exciting in them a greater Desire of going forward  After the Earl had made a good Progress in the Schools there he returned to his Father in  Scotland  and in the University of  Edinburgh  pursued the Study of the Greek and Latin adding the Study of the Logicks and other Parts of Philosophy under Mr  Kennedy  then Regent in that University He studied the Mathematicks under the learned and very justly celebrated Doctor  David Gregory  then Professor at  Edinburgh  and afterwards  Savilian  Professor at  Oxford  The Earl had also the Assistance of Mr  Gregory  the present Professor of the Mathematicks at  Edinburgh  And he had the constant Happiness to be the Favourite of his Masters and to be much beloved by his follow Students  In the Beginning of the Year he went again to  Holland  to visit his Grandfather and Grandmother to whom he was very dear and returned in  October  that Year to  Scotland  to reassume his Studies in the University but the Commotions that happened at  Edinburgh  in  November  interrupted the stated Course of every Thing till the Revolution was completed and the Government established in the Person of King  William  In the Beginning of the Year he went with his Father to  London  From this Time forward the present Earl then Mr  Dalrymple  begun to ply the Study of the living Languages as well as that of the dead and to improve himself in these Kinds of Exercises that belong to a young Gentleman still with the same Constancy and good Effect  He returned again to  Scotland  with his Father and saw the Meeting of the Estates and the two first Sessions of the Parliament of  Scotland  under King  William  and Queen  Mary  in the Year and  His Father being made Secretary of State in the Beginning of the Year his Son the present Earl had the Advantage to be much at Court which was a new Kind of Education that added both Ornament and useful Improvement to those he had acquired before And when his Father followed the King to  Flanders  the Earl went along In the Summer he was in the Camp and was present at the Battle of  Steenkirk  where the brave Earl of  Angus  was kill'd on the Head of his Regiment with whom the present Earl of  Stair  advanced to the Enemy as a Volunteer  In the Winter the Earl returned once more to his Studies at  Leyden  heard the famous Professors there read on  Grotius  and the Institutions of the Civil Law and had at the same Time Colleges of History imploying every Minute to the best Advantage  After these Foundations laid there remained nothing more to fit the Earl for Business but travelling to see how Men of different Tempers and Religions lived among themselves and other Men and to learn from the first Hand the Genius Manners Constitutions and Languages of some of the most considerable Nations in  Europe  He set out with the Lord  Lexington  who went in the Year to  Vienna  Ambassador The Earl having been some Time at that Court went on to  Italy  visiting  on his Way the several great Cities Republicks and Courts in  Italy  At  Rome  he applied himself to the Knowlege of Antiquities Architecture and other Things which are taught there studying with much Application the  Italian  Language and because he could not then go into  France  during the War then between King  William  and that Crown he studied the  French  very carefully by the Help of a  French Abbé  whom he found at  Rome  that he might enter deeper into the Strength Genius and Beauties of that Language so universally in Use  Having made the Tour of  Germany  and  Italy  he returned to  England  in the and that Year came to  Scotland  with his Father where he continued until the at which Time there being new Regiments to be raised in  Scotland  he went to Court to offer his Service upon the Appearance of an approaching War The King received him very graciously but a Scheme of Officers was formed for these Regiments leaving him out His Majesty having observed it told that he was resolved to provide for Mr  Dalrymple  who by that Scheme was neglected and for that Reason his Majesty resolved to make him Second Lieutenant Colonel of his Regiment of Foot Guards in  Scotland  But King  William  's Death happening just then his Commission as Second Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Foot Guards was signed by Queen  Anne  on one of the first Days of her Reign  Being now in the Army where his Inclination had ever led him to serve he embraced the first Opportunities to appear in that Way which soon happened For the late Queen being engaged with the Confederates in the Second War against  France  and having sent over an Army under the Command of the Duke of  Marlborough  the Earl made the very first Campaign as a Volunteer and distinguished himself in the Actions of greatest Hazard and Consequence as at the taking of  Venlo  and  Liege  and at the Cannonade of  Peer  He was also imployed by the Duke as his  Aidde Camp  It was in this Campaign that he laid the Foundation of that Friendship with which that great General has constantly honoured him since  The Account of the Earl from that Period is so interwoven with the great Events Civil and Military that have happen'd that tho all the Materials for going thro' with a just and exact History were at Hand yet the Nature of this Undertaking would not admit of pursuing it or the Share he had in these great Actions which besides has been remarkable enough by many very considerable Circumstances well known I have therefore contented my self in a plain Way and without enlarging on Particulars to set forth what concerns his Youth and Education which has been one constant Series of Application to those Things which might fit him for the eminent Station where he is now placed  I shall therefore finish what concerns him with the bare Enumeration of the Employments he has gone through  He had a Commission as Colonel of Foot in the  Dutch  Service in  April  in the Year he succeeded Brigadeer General  Fergusson  deceast in a Regiment of Foot on the  English  Establishment and after the Death of Lord  John Hay  he had the Command given him of the Royal  Scots  Dragoons by the Name of the  Royal Greys  by a Commission bearing Date the th  August  which he continued to command till the last Year of the late Queen when he was ordered to sell it to the Earl of  Portmore  He commanded a Brigade of Foot at the Battle of  Ramellies  and was immediately after that Battle made  Brigadeer His Commission bears Date from the Day of that Battle He was Brigadeer in the Battle of  Audenard  and carried the News of the Victory into  England  he commarded as MajorGeneral at the Battle of  Tanier  near  Mons  and was made LieutenantGeneral at the Siege of  Deway  He was sent Envoy Extraordinary to the King of  Poland  in the Winter of the Year where he resided till  May  that he returned to the Siege of  Doway  and having left his Secretary in  Poland  continued in that Character till the Year that Mr  Scot  was sent to that Court  Since King  George  's Accession to the Crown the Earl has been made Lord of the Bedchamber one of His Majesty's most honourable PrivyCouncil in the  and in  January  thereafter he was sent Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of  France  but at the same time he had Powers and Credentials to treat as Ambassador and Plenipotentiary and when his Lordship should judge it necessary to assume that Character  His Lordship married the Lady  Eleanor Campbell  Daughter of  James

of the Lands of  Menstry  to himself and  Elizabeth Douglas  Daughter of  Robert Douglas  o  Lochlevin  his Wife in Li  erent and to  Andrew Alexander  their Son in Fee which was ratified by a Charter under the Great Seal th of  January    Ibidem  whose Heir and Successor  William Alexander  of  Menstry  being a young Man of very great Parts he much improv'd them by a good Education which being seasoned with Years qualified him for the highest Trusts He travelled at first abroad as Tutor to the Earl of  Argyle  and was a considerable time with that noble Lord in Foreign Parts After his Return he betook himself to the Court where he liv'd in great Reputation under no other Character than a Gentleman of the most polite Parts and  Learning Mr  Alexander  having an Inclination and a Talent from his Youth to Poetry he declined all other Business and delivered himself up in+tirely to his own Genius in which he made a wonderful Proficiency in the Study of the ancient Poets by whom he form'd an excellent  Goust  of Poetry insomuch as in a short Time he came to be looked on as one of the most eminent of that Profession K  James  who then reigned was a Prince of great Learning and Knowledge and delighted much in the Conversation of learned Men particularly Mr  Alexander  who presented him with several elegant Poems to the King's great Delight and the gaining the Applause of Persons of the first Rank for Quality and Wit to himself to whom in a short Time he grew very acceptable After he had lived some Years about the Court his Majesty who looked on him as a wise Man was pleased to prefer him to be Master of Requests and a Knight in But his Majesty's Bounty did not rest in the conferring one single Favour on him for Sir  William  being a learned and projecting Man and having settled a Colony in  Nova Scotia  in  America  upon his own Charges King  James  made him a Grant of it by his Royal Deed on the of  September  and did intend to erect the Order of Baronet for encouraging and advancing so good a Work But the Two or Three last Years of that Prince's Reign having been less pleasant to him by the Jealousies which about that Time began in  England  he thought fit to suspend the further Prosecution of that Affair until a more favourable Conjuncture which he lived not to see But King  Charles  I who with his Father's other Virtues inherited his Affection to his native Kingdom immediately upon his coming to the Crown proposed nothing more than the furthering of that Design which was projected to be of so great a Benefit to the Nation and therefore made Sir  William Alexander  Lieutenant of  New Scotland  and instituted the Order of KnightBaronet for the encouraging and advancing of that Colony and gave him the Privilege of coining small CopperMoney a Gift which was inveighed against even at that Time with great Bitterness But his Majesty who thought that too great Encouragement could not be given to learned and worthy Men such as Sir  William  was and being fully satisfied of his great Abilities and Integrity was graciously pleased in to make him Secretary of State in place of the Earl of  Haddingtoun  and a Peer by the Title of Viscount

particular History written of this noble ancient Family in  English  by a very able Pen the Learned Sir  Robert Gordon  of  Gordonstoun  Baronet and very accurately epitomiz'd by Mr  Ross  in  Latin  the Author of the  Pansebeia  wherein both Sir  Robert  and Mr  Ross  have been at much Pains to vouch the Antiquity and illustrate the Descent of the Earls of  Sutherlands  and they have done it so well and instructed it so clear that the Peerage of this illustrious Family is not only one of the oldest with us in  Scotland  but for what I know of any other Nation of  Europe  And I can't but remark that our Historians do make mention that the Family of  Sutherland  were Thanes before the Title of Earl was introduced among us for not only Sir  Robert Gordon  and Mr  Ross  but even our publick National Historians do take Notice That  Allan  Thane of  Sutherland  a brave and warlike Man gave a very signal Defeat to a Detachment of the  Danish  Army who invaded the Country of  Sutherland  and that he was cruelly put to Death and murdered under the Usurpation of  Macbeth  for his firm Adherence to his rightful Sovereign King  Malcolm Canmore  King  Duncan  's Son and for endeavouring to set him on his Father's Throne and when in Providence that was happily brought about that heroick and generous Prince thought it but just to restore the Children of such who had been forfeited on his Account during the Usurpation and therefore  Walter  the Son of  Allan  Thane of  Sutherland  in Memory of his Father's Merit as well as his own signal Services in contributing toward  the Restoration was not only restored to his Estate and Honour but was likewise one of those whom that King further dignify'd with the then introduc'd Title of Earl  Sir Robert Gordon Buchanan and Hume  and dying was succeeded by  Robert  his Son and Heir who built the Castle of  Dunrobin  which he called after his own Name which is still the principal Seat of this noble Family This Earl was imployed to apprehend  Harold  Earl of  Caithness  who had committed a very horrible and barbarous Murder upon the Bishop of  Caithness  whom he brought to exemplary Justice He was succceeded by  Hugh  his Son call'd for Distinction  Hugh Friskin  i e  Hugh with the ready Whinger  because he was a bold daring Man He attack'd the  Danes  when they invaded his Country whom he de  eat in Battle at  Embo  in  Sutherland  and slew their General  To  Hugh  Earl of  Sutherland  succeeded  William  his Son who died and was succeeded by  William  his Son who in the Reign of King  Alexander  II enter'd into a solemn Agreement with  Archibald  then Bishop of  Caithness  wherein both Parties narrate That there had been a long Dispute and Controversy  inter venerabiles Patres Predecessores nostros

Succession did take Place in the Person of that young Princess thro' the Demise of her Grandfather this noble Earl was one of the Peers who addressed King  Edward  I of  England  That a Treaty of Marriage might be set on Foot betwixt his Son the Prince of  Wales  and the young Queen of  Scotland  whereby the Two Kingdoms might be for ever unite under one Sovereign but the Death of the young Princess falling out soon thereafter the Treaty which was concluded had no Effect When the Competition happened about the Succession to the Crown betwixt  Robert Bruce  and  John Baliol  the Earl of  Sutherland  was one of those great Men who were appointed to go to  Berwick  to hear King  Edward  's Decision of that grand Affair the Determination of which had been referred to him Upon the breaking out of the War thereafter he was firm to that Side which did most regard the Honour Interest and Independency of his Country and was very assistant in bringing King  Robert the Bruce  to and maintaing him on the Throne He did in a very eminent Manner signalize his Valour and Courage at the famous Battle of  Banno  kburn  whereby the Slavery and Usurpation under which  Scotland  had long groand was gloriously redem'd and retriev'd The same Earl is one of the Peers who with other great Men of the Kingdom wrote that memorable Letter to the Pope in to which all of them put their Seals a

an old Man th  May  was succeeded by  John  his Grandson Son of  John Steuart  of  Caverston  his eldest Son who died in the Lifetime of his Father by  Margaret  his Wife a Daughterof the Lord  Ochiltree  's Family  Which  John  being a Person of great Parts and of an excellent Understanding was elected Knight of the Shire to the Parliament  Sir James Dalrymple's Cambden Edit  for the County of  Twedale  where his Parts were quickly taken Notice of and having behav'd himself very well in all Things relating to the Crown his Majesty King  James  VI was pleased to call him to his Council and to confer the Honour of Knighthood on him  King  Charles  I soon after his coming to the Crown contracted an extraordinary Opinion of Sir  John Stewart  as a Man w  ll versed in all Parts of Learning and of great Experience in Affairs insomuch as he pre  erred him to the Honour of the Peerage th of  April    Charta in Cancellaria S D N R  by the Title of Lord  Steuart  of  Traqua  r  and made him TreasurerDepute at the Time when the Earl of  Mortoun  was made Lord HighTreasurer and his Lordship having a near Relation to the Court and much in it he contracted a great Friendship and Familiarity  ith Dr  Laud  then Bishop of  London  and being well able to spea  in the Affairs of the Church took Care to be thought by the Bishop a very zealous Defender of it and of the Episcopal O  der which very much endear'd him to the Bishop by whom he was recommended  to the King as fittest to be trusted not only in the Administration of Civil Affairs in which indeed it cannot be denied but he had great Experience but also in the conferring of Ecclesiastical Preferments in which he was not always very fortunate  When King  Charles  made a Journey into his Kingdom of  Scotland  to be there crown'd the Lord  Traquair  at+tended on his Majesty throughout that whole Progress and at the Solemnity of the Coronation was raised to the Honour of Earl of  Traquair  by Letters Patent bearing Date at  Holyroodhouse June    Charta in Cancellaria S D N R  and growing every Day more in Credit with the King and in Favour with Dr  Laud  who by this Time was become Archbishop of  Canterbury  his Majesty was pleased to make him Lord HighTreasurer of  Scotland  in the upon the Surrender of that Office by the Earl of  Mortoun  The Earl being thus invested in the greatest Office of Benefit in the Kingdom and his Majesty believing he had provided a strong Support to his Government both in Church and State and having exceedingly set his Heart upon the uniting of his Three Kingdoms in one Form of GOD's Worship and publick Devotions by a publick Liturgy he committed intirely the bringing about of that Business so far as related to the Civil Part of it to the Lord Treasurer and tho' his Lordship was very well affected to the Work in Hand in his own Judgment yet he did not think the Season was ripe for it's being published when it was by the King's Proclamation appointed to be first read at  Easter  and therefore the Lord Treasurer perswaded his Majesty to defer it for a Time till some good Preparation might be made for the more favourable Reception of it And as this Pause gave the discontented Party more Time for their Negotiations so the Consequence of it made him suspected to be secretly an Enemy to the Liturgy and the Bishops Of this the Lord  Clarendon  clears him and says  That there was never any Ground either then or in all the after Part of his Life for that Suspicion but that if the Lord Treasurer had been as much depended upon to advise the Bishops in the Prosecution of the Liturgy and for the Conduct of it as he was to assist them in the carrying on whatsoever they proposed it is very probable either so much would not have been undertaken together or that it would have succeeded better  But whatever Suspicion some of the Bishops might entertain of the Lord Treasurer's not being devoted to some of them 'tis certain the King had no Jealousie of the Earl as if he had been in any Degree corrupted or disaffected to the Government as it was establish'd by Law insomuch as when his Majesty was pleased in the to call a Parliament and an Assembly of the Clergy in order to appease the Commotions and to extinguish the Fire that the Endeavour of bringing in the Liturgy and the Book of Canons had kindled he pitch'd on the Lord Treasurer whom he knew to be as wise a Man as the Nation then had and very equal to the Work to represent his Royal Person both in the Parliament and the Assembly in that great and difficult Trust he acquitted himself to his Majesty's great Satisfaction and did with the outmost Vigour and Fidelity assert the Royal Prerogative as established by Law or ancient Custom and when he thought that was invaded either in the Parliament or in the Assembly of the Church he opposed it with all his Power and gave them all the Trouble he could  As the faithful Discharge of his great Trust did very much establish and confirm the Treasurer in his Majesty's good Opinion so it drew upon him the implacable Resentment of the other Party who pursued him with so extraordinary Animosity that in the next Parliament of they prevailed with his Majesty to take the WhiteStaff from him and impeach'd him of High Treason of which they likewise found him guilty but having refer'd his Punishment to the King his Majesty was so far from conceiving the Earl had merited such a severe Prosecution that he gave Orders that in all Events a Pardon might be prepared under the Great Seal  The Remission I have seen and perused in the Hands of the Earl of Traquair  wherein his Majesty does not only very fully absolve him from the Crimes objected against him in the Impeachment but annexes to the Remission an ample Testimony of his great Abilities and singular Integrity in the Discharge of all the great Employments he had been intrusted with under the Crown  But this Testimony of the King's gracious Affection to the Earl did him very little Service for during the Civil War by Virtue of the Judgments that had formerly passed on him his Estate was sequestrated and taken from him and for the greater Security of his Person he was forced to flee out of the Country and tho' they allowed him to return Home and live at his own House yet he continued under Restraint till the that he was enlarged and suffered to sit in the Parliament where he endeavoured all he could to bring the Nation to a thorough Engagement to redeem and relieve the King who was then a Prisoner in the Isle of  Wight  and the Parliament having raised an Army the Earl of  Traquair  upon his own Charges levied a Regiment of Horse and ma  ched  the Head of them to the Battle of  Prestoun  where both his Lordship and the Lord  Linton  his Son were taken Prisoners and by Order of the  English  Parliament sent to  Warwick  Castle where the old Earl continued for the Space of Four Years and tho' he was set at Liberty yet the Sequestration of his Estate was continued Nor did the Malice of the Usurpers abate toward him till they had reduced him to the lowest Penury and Want that can be imagined and in that disconsolate low Condition of Fortune he spent the after Part of his Life till the End of  September Anno  Death put an End to his Days  This noble Lord married  Katharine  Daughter of  David  the first Earl of  Southesk  by whom he had  Charles  his Son and Heir and Four Daughters  Lady  Margaret  married to  James  Earl of  Queensberry  Lady  Elizabeth  to Sir  Patrick Murray  st Lord  Elibank  Lady  Ann

he brought to the King's Army at  Philiphaugh  many Gentlemen of  Twedale  shire engaging themselves in the Service out of their personal Affection to him as well as Conscience of the Cause And tho' he surviv'd those Times of Usurpation and Anarchy and saw the King restor'd yet it cannot be denied he was not recompensed according to his Merit or considered  as his Sufferings deserved But in this his Lordship was not singular for the current Doctrine of that Time was  That it was no Matter how the King used his old Friends f  r they would be so still  He married first  Henrietta  Daughter of

pure and perpetual Alms an Annuity of Twenty Five Merks out of his Estate which he made redeemable from the Monks for a hundred Pounds when he or his Heirs should offer the Redemption in any Time thereafter As Sir  David  was a very wise and devout Man so he seems to have been a Person of great Generosity for our Historians tell us that it was he who gave the exil'd Earl of  Northumberland  Notice of his being to be given up to his Sovereign the King of  England  by an Article in a Treaty which was then concluded betwixt the Two Nations whereupon the Earl shifted for himself and this Act of Generosity was so highly resented by Sir  James Douglass  who had some Pretence that the Earl was his Prisoner that he set upon Sir  David  at  Langhermistoun  as he was returning home after having

During the Government of Duke  Murdo  his Brother in Law Sir  Malcolm Fleming  was frequently employed in managing Treaties with  England  particularly with Relation to the Redemption of King  James  I which being happily brought about he was one of the Hostages for the Ransom but all this signal Loyalty did not secure him upon the King's Return from being suspected of having concur'd in the Duke's illegal Administration and therefore when the Duke of  Albany  was first arrested and made Prisoner so was Sir  Malcolm Fleming  Drummond's History of King James I  and others who had been in the Duke's greatest Confidence but as his greatest Crime seems to have been his near Alliance with the late Regent so the Court were soon so sensible of his Innocency that he was shortly thereafter released without ever being charged with any particular Crime 'Tis plain Sir  Malcolm Fleming  liv'd retir'd and did not meddle in any Faction during the Reign of King  James  I pro+bably he was disgusted with the Treatment the Duke of  Albany  's Family had met with yet he stuck close to his Friends the  Douglasses  which cost him dear for he was together with the Earl of  Douglass  and his

Consent to the Death and Slaughter of Sir  Malcolm Fleming  this Lord's Father  Moreover it would appear that when King  James  II himself came to Age he was so much satisfied with the Injustice Sir  Mal  lm Fleming  had met with that he gave Order to direct Precepts to the Sheriffs of the several Counties where Sir  Robert Fleming  's Estate lay to inseft him as Heir to his Father who by several Inquests of Persons of great Honour is found and declared to have died at the Faith and Peace of his Sovereign Lord King  James  II then reigning  Ibidem  notwithstanding of his pretended Forfaulture
