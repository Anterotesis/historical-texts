 A Brief DESCRIPTION OF Orkney Zetland PightlandFirth Caithness WHEREIN  ter a short Journal of the Author's Voyage thither These Northern Places are first more Generally Described Then a Parti∣cular View is given of the several  Isles  thereto belonging Together with an Account of what is most Rare and Remarkable therein with the Author's Observes thereupon  EDINBURGH  Printed by  George Mosman An Dom  MDCCI  To His GRACE JAMES DUKE Of HAMILTON  May it please Your Grace  U  Pon my Return from  Zet∣land  as bound in Duty I payed my Respects to Your GR Who was pleased to ask If I had kept a Diary Which I acknowledged but could not shew it till the Remarks therein con∣tained were Transcribed which when done Y GR should have them to glance at some leisure Hour Thus Your Com∣mand giving Rise to this Undertaking I have presumed to make the Dedication to Y GR  The  Noble  and  Illustrious Family  of HAMIL∣TON the first in the Nation standeth in no  need of Panegyricks from me to set

GR Honourable Appearance for and Acknowledgment of Presbyterian Govern¦ment in the last Session of Parliament wa  Acceptable to many And I hope Y GR shall never have Cause to Repent of Your Con∣tinuing to Favour the Ancient Government o  this Church which as it is Conform to the ScripturePlan so the Lord hath been Graci∣ously Pleased to owne and Countenance it in the Great Things he hath done for and by the Ministers and Professors thereof  Among these things for which You stand Obliged to the Wise Conduct of Providence One is That You have been so well Directed in the Happy Choice of Your Consorts Your Present LADY of a Sweet and Gentle Temper Her Carriage Obliging and Discreet to all Her Loving to Entertain Pious and Religious Dis∣course Her Modest and Exemplary Dress I wish She

Branches of Y Illustrious Family do Flourish in several Parts of the Nation tho God in His Holy Providence hath made lately a Breach thereupon to Y Grief and the Na∣tions Loss  Your GR Relation to the Ancient and Ho∣nourable Family of  Douglas  gives me occasion to mention that old Alliance betwixt that House and the Princes of  Orkney William  Lord of  Niddesdale  commonly called the  Black Douglas  by  Egidia  or  Giles  Daughter of King  Rob  had a Daughter of the same Name Married to  Henry Sinclar  usually Styled Knight of the  Cockle  of the  Garter  Hist of the House of  Douglas    Angus  and Prince of  Orkney  To Him Succeeded his Son  William Sinclar  Married to  Elizabeth Douglas  About the end of the and be∣gining of the  Cent  Daughter to  Archibald  Earl of  Douglas

of  Scotland c  My L the Knowledge of History is that which the most of Men are taken with as be∣ing both Pleasant and Useful And it cannot but stain the Reputation of any tho able to give Account of what is Rare in other Coun∣trys if they be Ignorant of their own and Places which Depend thereupon where things no less Remarkable do Occur which may both Ex∣ercise the Ingenious and Edify the Gracious Inquirers  But above all Blessed are they who make a Religious Improvement of Natural Observes and use all Arts and Sciences as Handmaids to Religion and Piety The Knowledge of Christ is the Queen of Sciences Hence a Learned  Paul determineth to know nothing but Christ and Him Crucified  And those who in all Ages have been Wise unto Salvation have preferred Christ's Cross to the Worlds Crown And with  Moses reckoned His worst things better then the Worlds best  The Knowledge of all other  things without the Knowledge of Christ is as a Shadow without the Substance and a Body without the Head as some have Instituted the Comparison Yea they are  without Mind and Judgment The Cardinal Vertues as they are called may be Attained in Shew but not in Truth  Quid enim illis cum

trouble the Sweating Press tho I might use and plead the common Topicks taken from the Advice and Impor∣tunity of others and to prevent the Publishing of some of these Remarks excerpt from my Papers by some into whose hands they had fallen after they had lien by me several Months  There are several Grave Persons in these Isles of good and solid Judgment both Ministers and Others who being better acquainted with the Places of their ordinary Residence then it can be supposed I had occasion to be might have Published some∣thing more Valuable on this Head and set their Remarks in a clearer Light As likewise some of my Dear Brethren of the  Commission  might have done it to greater Advantage Yet the En∣gagements that lay on me to Transcribe the most Remarkable Occurrences and the Solicitation of some thereupon to Publish them have some way obliged me to make this Appearance However if others  hereby shall be excited to serve the Publick by giv∣ing a fuller and clearer  Description  of these Gener∣ally little known Places this Essay will not prove al∣together unuseful And if I had known that any in∣tended to have Published something of this nature the World had not been troubled with my Scribling  I hope none will judge that I Act without my Line in giving Descriptions of this Nature see∣ing all are called to  Remember the Works of the Lord and Talk of His Doings  as they have occasion And all along I endeavour to keep in mind the Character I bear dropping something of a Spiritual Improvement  Our Historians such as I have consulted have given but a very brief and lame and in some things a false Account of these places especially  Zetland  which is unknown to the most of the Nation if not that they have only heard there were such Isles a  the  Zetlandick  It is true there is one Mr▪  Wallace  a late Minister in  Orkney  who hath gratified the World by giving a Description of the  OrkneyIsles  But neither  Zetland  no  Caithness  doth he meddle with And as to  Ork∣ney  there are several things which deserve their own Remark he makes no mention of And others have fallen out since his time which I have noticed So that on the whole the Account now given even of  Orkney  will appear almost new to any who shal  be pleased to compare the two Descriptions together  No doubt but such as know these Places will de∣siderate several things no less Remarkable then wha  are Observed But still my Reader would remem∣ber That this is but a Diary Transcribed Yet thi  may say as I have not willingly suffered my self  be imposed on so neither have I imposed any thing  n the Credulous World but delivered such things  hich either I was witness to or had good ground  beleive from Persons worthy of Credit So that  any thing appear Questionable I have ordinarly  n general given my Author for it  Omne tulit punctum qui mi  cuit uti∣le dulci  I suppose the judicious Reader in perusing the  ollowing sheets will find things borh Curious and  nstructive affording matter of Meditation to the Wise Observers of Providence  As to any Philosophical or Philological Observes  s I am unfit for so am I far from a Magisterial  ictating of them to any but soberly proposed my  wn Sentiments which if my Reader do not relish  e may follow his own  Altho the Style be not Quaint and Elegant  mbellishd with the Ornaments of Art yet I hope it will be found plain and intelligible and tho sometimes obliged to express my self in the Dialect or Idiotism of the Countrey yet ordinarily such Words and Phrases are some way explained So when I speak of  Orkney  or  Zetland  as not in  Scotland  tho depending thereupon I express my self as the Countrey do  As to the Commissions Work I have not meddled therewith except when the threed of the History did require me to touch it However this I may add Our weak endeavours for the Advance∣ment of the Interest of Our  LORD JESUS  in these remote Corners have not been found by Su∣periour Judicatories altogether unsuccessful And I suppose it repents none of us of our Voyage thi∣ther however dangerous it did prove  THE CONTENTS  Of the Chapters  INtroduction  Pag  Chap I  A Journal of our Voyage  Chap II  A

several Stations according to their Capacities are carefully to study the maintain∣ing and promoting of the good and interest of  at Kingdom Nation or Society whereof they are Members For if it go not well with the Publick in  mmon it cannot reasonably be thought that the hap∣  ness of any in particular can long continue more than  can go well with the several Members of a Natural  ody when the Body it self is distressed  Non nobis nati sed Patriae Re  publica  Cicero  Dulce decorum est pro Pat¦riâ mori  It was this  enerous Love and Concern for their Country that so  gnalised the  Ancient Romans  and made them in a short  me arrive to such a height of Glory and Honour  nto this did their Philosophers Poets and Oratours  armly excite their FellowCitizens so that the more  the less any laid out themselves this way their At∣  eivements accordingly were reputed Noble and He∣  ick and their Persons renowned  Yet much more will we find our selves bound to  dvance one another's good  Especially Christians bound to this  if we look on our selves  ot only as Men and Members of the Body Politick  ut as Christians and Members of that Body whereof Christ is the Head Therefore our Love of Care for    Rom    Cor  c  nd Sympathy with one another is much commended  n holy Scripture which the Apostle well illustrateth  in several places by that apposite and elegant similitud  of the Members of a natural Body  Phil    their conspiring t  the mutual good of one another and expressly com¦mandeth  Look not every Man on his own things but a  on the things of others  And the want thereof he do  heavily regrate in the same Chap  For I have no M  likeminded who will naturally care for your state For  seek their own not the things which are JesusChrist  Which selfish and narrow Spirit as it hath too much prevailed in all Ages of the Christian Church since the Days of the  Apostles  so in none more then this o  ours  Owen on Hebr    As the learned  Owen  observeth imputing th  shame the almost Ruine of Christianity thereunto  The Lord Christ  saith he  hath ordained that th  Members of the same Church and Society should mutually watch over one another and the whole Body over all the Members unto their Edification And that the practice of it is so much lost as it is i  the shame and almost Ruine of Christianity  Guberna∣tores Me∣taphorâ a N  cleris Navem

Ministers being as Pilots or Governours under Chris  to the Ship of the Church as Magistrates under God are to that of the State And the Charge of Minister having a more immediate respect to the Soul and bet¦ter part of Man they are called the more diligently to take heed thereto and so to steer their Course through the boisterous Sea of this World as that not only the themselves at length may arrive and rest at the  Fa  Havens  of  Immanuels Land  but that also through Grace they may carry alongs many with them emba  ¦qued on the same bottom of the Covenant by th  Means of  Word  and  Discipline Ministers  are  Stewards Watchmen Shepherds Bishops  or  Overseers  c All which do imply a Charge to be discharged by them for th  good of others  Ministers Considered in a fold Relation  Ministers may be considered in a threefold Rela¦tion As Christians related to Christ which i  common to them with all believers As Ministers  related to that particular Church or portion of the  hurch in general the inspection whereof is assigned  them and in which more especially and immedia∣tly they are called to labour As they stand rela∣ted to the Church National whereof they are Mini∣  ers whose good they are to endeavour as God in  s holy wise Providence shall afford them access  nd that in all these respects Ministers may the more prove themselves unto their great Lord and Master  cording to his Appointment the Apostles Example  d the Practice of the Church in all Ages they do  sociate themselves unto Councils Meetings or Assem∣  ies more or less General that so by common Coun∣  Consent they may consult the interest of the  urch of Christ within their respective districts and  unds Which as it hath been the laudable practice other Churches so of the  Church  of  Scotland

short Journal of his Voyage thither with some cu  ¦sory Observes thereupon  CHAP I  Containing a brief Journal of our Voyage fro  Leith  to  Orkney  and thence to  Zetland  likewise of our Return from  Zetland  by  Orkne  to  Caithness  Together with a Summary A  ¦count of the remarkable Dangers we were in  We set Sail from  Leith  ON Friday April about six a Clock  the Morning we set Sail from  Leith  for  Or  ¦ney  the Wind fair tho faint which not being a  to bear us up against the Tide we dropt Anchor t  Miles East of  Inchkeith  where we lay from Ten t  three in the Afternoon when a Briskgale arising  weighed Anchor and Sailed down the  Firth  the Sh  making so good way that before next Morning at bre  of Day we were past  Montross  On Saturday the Wind lessened yet about St  set we past  Peterhead  Steering towards the point  Kinnaird  leaving the  Bridges  of  Ratray  a ridge of B  Rocks on our Larboard Next Morning being  Lords Days with a gentle Wind we made the  of our way through  Murray Firth  Pass  Mur∣ray Firth  spending the  in Religious Exercises with the Mariners and so Passengers in company with us When before  Pe  head  we saw the fins of a great Fish about an y  above the Water which they call a  Pricker  Also ab  Ten at Night a  Whale  was seen by the help of Mo  ¦light at a little distance from our Ship casting fo  the Water in a hideous manner  Next Morning about Seven a Clock we got sight  Orkney  and the Wind blowing some what harder  en it had done the former Night in the Afternoon  passed the East end of  Pightland Firth  Land in  Orkney  which though  inarily raging with the impetuous current of a Sea  reason of the many Tides meeting there yet we  nd it not so but in the midst of that part we pas∣  dined upon Deck so meeting with least danger  ere we feared the greatest We put in to  Holms∣  nd  and arrived there about Seven at Night on the  onday after our setting sail  The Ship's Crew told us  The Voy∣age favo∣rable  that tho they had fre∣  ently Sailed these Seas to and from  Orkney  yet never  d they a better or pleasanter Voyage Which Pro∣  dential favour was the more observable the Wind  xt Day after we Landed blowing strong from the  orth and lasting several Days Which if it had come  before we had accomplished our Voyage we  ould not only have been blown back to sea but  ereby a tempest arising we had been in no small  nger We desired to look upon this as a signal Mercy  d a token for good  We would have hired our Bark to  Zetland  but  e Master being under Charterparty  We forced to hire an open Boat from  Ork∣ney  to  Zet∣land  was obliged to  turn with a fraught of Victual to  Leith  and not  ving the occasion of any other Ship or Bark we  ere forc't to hire one of these open Boats of about six∣  Meils which the  Orkney Men  use for carrying Victual  Zetland  else we could not go for  Zetland  this sea∣  n tho the Ministers and others told us our Passage  ight prove dangerous  Our stay in  Kirkwal  the chief Town in  Orkney  assisting that Presbytery in some of their affairs was  om the to the of April when with Mi∣nisters of this Country on the Commission we took  oat for  Sanda  about  We go for  Sanda  from  Kirkwall  Miles NorthEast from  Kirk∣wal  and in our way to  Zetland  having ordered our own Boat to follow with the first fair Wind We put  off about two in the Afternoon the Men rowing wit  six Oars about half way when the Wind rising some¦thing favourable with a little Sail and Oars we go  over  Stronza Firth  Tho as we came near our landin  place in  Sanda  the increasing Wind raised the wave so high that sometimes they intercepted the sight  the  Island  Yet we got all safe on shore betwixt  and at Night The Mercy of our escape was th  more remarkable that our Boat was throng'd wit  Passengers and so overloaden that the Water came al¦most to her brim so that if the Sea had not bee  smooth and calm when we past throw  Stronza Firth  we had been probably all lost As these who had know¦ledge of those Seas did afterwards declare unto us  Go from  Sanda  to  Eda  We waited in  Sanda  for a Wind from April till May when the Wind presenting we went t  the  Isle  of  Eda  lying a little to the West of  Sanda  where our Boat was but before we could get aboard the Wind shifted to SouthEast and then to East an  by South which was too scrimp to fetch  Zetland  how¦ever the Wind now being very changeable we judge  it expedient for us to ly near our Boat and lay hold o  the first occasion So May the Wind at SouthEa  we put to Sea but scarce well were we without t  RedHead  of  Eda  when the Wind proving contrary we returned to  CalfSound May  being the Lord's Day we spent in Religious Exercises with the Peopl  of the  Isle  in the Evening the Wind turning fair we resolved next Morning early to get Aboard if the Wind held This last Night after we returned to  CalfSound  was terrible for Wind and Rain from the West the Wind soon altering after we had got it again to  CalfSound  with which we could not have kept the Sea in all probability A great Mercy the  it was that we were determined to return and did not keep the Sea as some advised for tho within half an hour after we had got in to the  Sound  the Wind  turned fair yet being too strong the Sea became foul  ad tempestuous which was not for our open Boat  Munday Morning  May  about two of the Clock  e were called to go Aboard which we did according∣  the Wind at West or West and by North the  ale was brisk but not very great which we were  lad of thereby expecting a speedy passage  Putting off from  Eda  we in great danger  So we  ith two other Boats in Company loosed but scarce  ere we a League without the Heads we saw a storm  f Wind and Rain making in the West whence the Wind blew wherupon one of the Boatmasters in com∣  any advised us to tack about and endeavour to  etch  CalfSound  again which counsel we judging to be  afe accordingly essayed to follow it but the Wind  nd Sea rising more boisterous and the Current of the  bb being strong from the Sound we could not by any means effectute our design tho we made several Trips  ot without danger the Sea with its broken and swel∣  ing waves threatening to swallow us up every mo∣ment The Mariners stood by their sails crying This work was very dangerous and at one time as one of them observed the Boat had taken in about Barrels of Water the Pump was still kept going we  udged our selves to be lost Men and some expressed  o much In these straits we desired the Boatmaster  itting by the Helm to see if he could make any other Harbour or Bay He answered God have Mercy upon  s for the Sea we dare not keep and there is not  nother Harbour in  Orkney  we can make The Men were fatigued with the toil of their hard work and  lmost at the giving over We then knew to our experience the meaning of that Scripture Ps of Seamen in a storm's being at their wits end Tho the Wind was fair for  Zetland  yet we durst not hold on our Course the Sea not only being tempestuous but we had also several Rousts or impetuous Tides to pass and then the Ebb was in the Sea which made them so much the more dangerous Thus streitened we  thought it adviseable to go down with some Sail be∣fore the Wind to the North end of  Sanda▪  endea¦vour to get in to  Otterswick  or  Taphness Bay  Get in to a  Bay  we fir  attempted  Otterswick  and lest we should have been blow  by the Bay's mouth we held so near Land that th  Boat beat several times upon a Rock however we go  in and drop't Anchor on the weatherside of the shore  Go to Sea again  We were all much refreshed with this great delive¦rance from so imminent a danger When we had rid¦den some hours at Anchor the Wind and Sea calmed About at Night one of the Boatmasters in company who had entred the  Bay  a little before us weighed An¦chor and put to Sea again Some of our number we  for lying still till the Weather was better setteld others thought that seeing  God  had commanded a Calm that we had a favorable Wind that the skie appeared t  be well set and promising and that the other Loade¦ned Boat had gone to Sea before us it might seen from these things Providence invited us to Sea again  Whereupon we put off but before we had come th  length of  North Ronalsha  scarce a League distant from the  Bay  we had been in the Wind became so faint that the Mariners took them to their Oars to help them through  North Ronalsha Roust  thence when w  came to  Dennis Roust  we made some way with our Sail without Oars the Tide then turning and the Flood be¦ginning to run in the Sea  Blown back by contrary Winds to  Stronza  Tuesday  May  about or in the Morning th  Wind shifted to East South East then to East an  our Boatmaster telling us that he was forced to ste  a Northern Course else he could not bear Sail an  so holding on not a stone in  Zetland  he could hit a  he expressed himself we all judged it most prop  to return to  Orkney  When we had tacked about th  Wind shifted to North East a strong Gale together wit  great Rains which caused a rolling and a swelling Se  for Rains here without Winds do raise or canker as they terme it the Sea and much more when Win  and Rain come on at once however we got in safely to  Stronza Road  which was the readiest we could make It was a happy Providence that we then returned at that nick of time for the Flood not being all spent we were thereby likewise hastened in our way so that within a few hours we came to our Port tho as was reckoned we were near midway between  Orkney  and  Fair Isle  The storm increased with the Day and after our landing it was so very great that we were oblig∣ed to keep within doors for several hours And if then we had been at Sea it is terrible for us to think upon the dismal effects which might have fol∣lowed thereupon for without all peradventure we had certainly perished if the Lord by some wonder of mercy had not rescued us as indeed he had former∣ly done  O that we would praise the Lord for his Goodness and for his wonderful works to the Chil∣dren of Men And that so long as we live we may never forget the th and th Days of  May  wherein the Lord wrought a great deliverance for us  Thus being discouraged  Tho dis∣couraged with dang∣ers we yet resolve to go for  Zetland  we were in great per∣plexity not knowing what to do Whether to make any further attempt or to return home  re infecta  seeing God in his Providence had so crossed us hith∣erto and it might be his mind we should not go for∣ward Upon these fluctuating and perplexing thoughts we askt God's mind in the matter after which more light did arise and we unaminously resolved yet to trie what the Lord would do with us  Fryday  May  between and in the morning  We arrive at  Lerwick  in  Zet∣land  Wind and skie promising well we put to Sea and passed the  Fair Isle  about Afternoon keeping it on our Starboard then our Gale increasing but con∣tinuing fair at SouthWest we made good way A¦bout Midnight we past  Swinburgh Head  the southernmost point of Land in  Zetland  having thence Miles to Sail up within Land to  Lerwick  whether we were bound The Wind growing more vehement we  lowed our Mainsail and took in a Riff With the break∣ing of the Day there arose a Mist whereby we could scarce see Land however we judged it safest to keep as near it as we could and sailed away by the Coast but being to pass through a  Sound  having the Isle of  Musa  on our Starboard and  Burra Land  on our Larboard  A danger escaped  our Seamen mistook the point of  Musa  tak∣ing another point in the  Mainland  for it and the Mist lying on we were almost engaged in the Land and so would have fallen among rocks which they coming to suspect held to Sea resolving to Sail without the point which they did with difficulty the Boat being so close haled and the blast great that the Helmalee was scarce able to command her and keep her by the Wind Which when they had done came to discover their Errour Hence sailing through  Musa Sound  we came to  Brassa Sound  and arrived at  Lerwick  on Sa∣turday about in the Morning  Some re∣markable Provi∣dences by the way  We had a quick passage sailing about Miles in or hours time Especially considering that we were not half an hour on shore when a strong Wind blew from the North which if it had come on but a little Soonner▪ we would have been driven back to Sea There is likewise another Providence remark∣able that we had only an ordinary desirable Gale when we passed the  Fair Isle  where always there goes a great rolling Sea but when within the Heads of the Land of  Zetland  we had it very strong so that scarce∣ly we could have wrestled and held out against it in the Ocean  We leave  Zetland  and arrives at  Kirk∣wall  in  Orkney  We arrived in  Zetland May  and having brought to some Period and Close our principal work there we set Sail for  Orkney June  saluting and bidding heartily farewell to the Ministers and some Gentle∣men of the Countrey and to the most considerable In∣habitants of  Lerwick  who kindly accompanied us to our Boat We left  Zetland  Teusday  June  about Afternoon and having the Wind at NorthWest or  North West and by North we passed the  Start Head  of  anda  about next Morning and endeavouring to  et in to  Ketteltaft  in  Sanda  A danger escaped  to put one of the Mini∣  ters of that Isle ashore our Boat through our Boatmasters inadvertency struck on a rock without sus∣taining any dammage we knew But the Wind not per∣mitting to turn up to that Road we all came to  Kirk∣val  and arrived there before in the morning Our  astage from  Zetland  to  Orkney  was yet quicker then  t was from  Orkney  to  Zetland  we being but hours  n running or as some say Miles Staying  n  Orkney  a few days  Pass  Pightland Firth  to  Ca  thness  and thence home by Land  we passed  Pightland Firth  to  Caith∣  ess  and having dispatched our work in conjunction with the Presbytery there we came home by Land  epairing with joy to our several Charges Where we may set up our  EbenEzer  saying  Hitherto hath the Lord helped us  I think we are called seriously to reflect upon the Man∣  er of the Lord's dealing with us  Some Re∣flections upon the dangers we had been in  we have been long detained and crossed in our way to  Zetland  tho we made several attempts to goe forward As to our  Com∣mission  we were appointed by the  General Assembly  of this  Church  and it being put upon us without any desire of ours or inclination that way we accordingly un∣detrook our Voyage and came with a favourable Gale to  Orkney  It is true that there are natural causes of Wind and Rain whereof we are to make a Spiritual improvement especially when they do impede or pro∣mote our designe Moreover Gods Judgements are a great depth and by the course of Nature in giving greater or lesser Winds at his pleasure he may carry on his more General Works of Providence and yet thereby more especially intend the punishment of the wicked or the Chastisement of his People which they are called to consider and improve And as true it is God in his Wise Soveraignity may so deal wi  h his People for the trial of their Faith and other Graces that they may be still and know that he is God ruling  as he pleaseth among the Children of Men The Devil also who is the  Prince of the power of the Air  may have an evil and malicious hand in things of this nature Especially when Men purpose to do good which tends to the overthrow of his Kingdom O that what we have met with may be so blessed as to render us more zealous against him and all Sin whereby his Kingdom is established in the World  That we may fight with Devil  and be more then Conquerours through him who loveth us  I say tho these things and the like sometimes may and ought to be had a regard unto yet  I  do humbly judge that upon these so very dreadful dangers we have in great mercy escaped we are called to examine our¦selves and search unto our Sins as we are  Christians  and as we are Ministers for which the Lord may have a controversie with us Our not being so faithful in our personal and pastoral work in working out our oun  and others Salvation Our impatience in not waiting the Lords time but being too anxious to be in  Zetland  at any rate And it is like in our not being so single in our ends in goeing as we ought to be c I con∣clude this Chap As the  Psalmist  doth  Ps  Re∣flecting on the Wonders of Providence  Who is wise and will observe those things Even they shall understand the loving kindnesse of the LORD  CHAP II A Description of  Orkney  its Situation Name first Planters Language manners of the People Wholesomeness of the Air Corns c  THE  Isles  belonging to  Scotland  have commonly been divided into three Classes The Western scaattered in the  Deucaledonian Ocean  The Isles belonging to  Scot∣land  divi∣ded into three Clas∣ses  on the West the  Orkney  and  Zetlandick  both lying to the  North  of  Scotland  As to the Western Isles tho in number far exceeding both the Isles of  Orkney  and  Zetland  yet  I  take no notice thereof in the subsequent Descriptione  r Commission not being deputed thither so only the  tter shall  I  give some breif account of not intending  advance any thing but what  I  have either found  be true from my own observation or had by good  formation from sensible and grave Persons worthy of  edit And shall begin with  Orkney  as order requireth  e first Landing there  Orkney  lyes to the North of  Scotland  The Situ∣ation of  Orkney  bounded on  e West by the  Deucaledonian Ocean  on the East by  e  German  On the North by the Sea which divides  Orkney  from  Zetland  And on the South by  Pightland  rth  Miles broad from  DungisbieHead  or  John  rot's House  the Northermost House in  Scotland  to  urwick  in  SouthRonaldsha  the Southernmost point of  Orkney  It is commonly said to be about the th de∣gree of Latitude at  Kirkwal  which lyes within the Coun∣  ey tho the Southmost point of  SouthRonaldsha  is  istant from the Northernmost of  NorthRonaldsha  ear a degree  That  Orkney  or  Orcades  is the name of these Isles  Concern∣ing the Name  agreed in by ancient and modern Writers But of  he Etymologie and whence the name is derived none  suppose will be found to give a satisfying account Some alledging it to come from  Orcas  which  Ptolomy  reckons to be a Promontory of  Caithness  opposite to  Orkney  Others from the Greek word  Coerceo  these Isles breaking and restraining the force of the rage∣ing Waves Or from  Hurricano  because of the boister∣ous Winds and Hurricanes which often blow in this Countrey Or from  Erick  or  Orkenwald  or some other Pictish Prince famous there at its first Plantation Which derivations some of them at least cannot but appear far fetcht to the thinking Reader  Injuriâ Temporis multa in oblivione jacent sep∣ulta  And indeed many in giving the Reasons of names do rather please their own Curiosity then render a true account of their Origin∣al seing the Reasons generally of the Ancient Names of Countries are buried in oblivion through the want of Writers and neglect of the first Inhabitants especially  in these parts of the World wherein Learning more slowly advanced  The st Po¦ssessors of the Count∣rey  The first Planters and Possessours of the Countrey seem to have been the  Picts  there being several old Houses both here and in  Zetland  which to this Day are called  Picts  or  Pights Houses  and the  Firth  between  Orkney  and  Caithness  is still called  ightland Firth  Whereupon some of our Historians as  Boethius  Writing of the Isles of  Orkney  doth observe design  Orkney  the most ancient Kingdom of the  Picts  Boeth  Hist de orchad  Orchades insulae antiquissimum Pictorum Regnum a quibusdam nostrarum rerum Scriptoribus vocitatae  And we find mention made of the Kings of  Orkney  Buchan  Histo on  Ewen    at  Buchanan  tells us of one  Belus  who having Invaded  Scotland  was defeated and put to Flight by  Ewen  d  King  of  Scots  Killing most of his Army upon which  Belus  being much discouraged and broken in Spirit despairing of life put hand in himself  Both Hist Lib  and became his own Executioner  Boethius  calls him  Balus Balus autem Orchadum Rex fractus animo desperatâ Salute ne in hostium potestatem ventret manum fibi intulit  And in the  Church  of  Birsa  at the West end of the  Mainland  in  Orkney  there is a long Stone yet standing erect with the name  Belus  inscribed there∣on in ancient Characters Probably this was the Place of his Interment Also the  Minister  of  Sandwick's Manse  is said to have been the Residence of one of the Kings of  Picts  and therefore to this Day is called  Kon∣ing  gar  or the  Kings House  And that part of the Manse which they say served for the Palace of a King▪ is so litle tho now keept in some Repair that it could not accommodate a Family of an ordinary rank The Figure thereof and contrivance of its two Rooms or Chambers one above and another below of narrow di∣mensions are antick and the Building hath been but course  Boethius  likewayes tels of another King called  Banus  whom  ClaudiusCaesar  having subdued  anno Christi  He carried him with his Wife and Children Cap∣tive  to  Rome  and were led by him in Triumph  Buch∣  nan  questiones the truth of this History  Buchan Hist in vitam Ca∣rataci  Tacitus  af∣  irming that part of  Britain  then to have been altogether  nknown to the  Romans nec temere

Wed set reduced by Act of Parlia∣ment Mr  Wal∣lace  his De∣scription of of  Orkney  eam Britannia partem Romanus  no incognitum fuisse  But if  Boethius  his Relation be  rue the vanquishing of  Orkney  hath been reputed some∣thing considerable seeing not to every Conquerour was  llowed by the  Roman Senate  the Glory of a Triumph  It is also probable the Government of these Isles continued with the  Pictish Princes  till the Dayes of  Kenneth  d  King  of  Scots  a Warlick Prince who having prevailed with his Nobles contrairy to their own inclin∣  tion by a notable peice of craft to engage in a War against the  Picts  with an undaunted valour and courage routed the  Pictish Army  and wasted their Countrey with Fire and Sword pursueing them to the  Orkney Isles  which he then annexed to the Crown of  Scotland  reign∣  ng from  Orkney  to  Adrian's Wall  Anno Dom Thence  Orkney  continued in the Possession of the  Scots  till the Dayes of  Donald Bane  about the Year who that he might secure the Kingdom to himself promis∣ed the Isles to  Magnus King  of  Norway  if he would assist  im with a necessary force Which offer  Magnus  accept∣  ng the  Norvegians  became Masters of the Isles till  Alexander  d about the Year Recovered them by  xpelling the  Norvegians  Which ever since were possess∣ed and disposed of by our Kings To be breif at length  William Douglas Earl  of  Mortoun  got a Wadset of  Orkney  and  Zetland  from  King Charles  the first Which Wadset with all the Rights Contracts Infeftments c There∣  nto appertaining was reduced by a  Decreet  of the  Lords  of  Session  obtained at the instance of his  Majesties Advocate  against  William Douglas  also  Earl  of  Mortoun  Grandchild to the foresaid  Earl February  which Decreet was ratified and confirmed by  Act of Parliament  he  December  following erecting the Earldom of  Ork∣ney  and  Lordship  of  Zetland  into a  Stewartry  to be calle  in all time comeing the  Stewartry  of  Orkney  and  Zetland  The reason comonly given why the  Earl  of  Morto  lost the Wadset was because some Chests of Gol  were Seised by the  Earls Deputs  in  Zetland  got out o  a rich Ship called the  Carmelan  of  Amsterdam  cast awa  there Anno None of this Gold coming to th  Kings Thesaury  tho some of it as was alledged cam  to the  Earls  hands  The Con∣try of  Ork∣ney  and  Zet∣land  reck∣oned con∣siderable and the Ti∣tle honour able  From our History we may know that  Orkney  an  Zetland  have been reckoned so great and considerable a part of his  Majesties Ancient Kingdom  that for dive  ages they occasioned much expence of Blood and Trea¦sure for the maintaining thereof against the Invasion  Foreiners and recovering the same out of their hand by Arms and Treaties The Title likewayes of the  Isles hath still been reputed honourable hence it hat  pleased Our present King to confer this Title of  Earl  Orkney  upon  Lord George Hamilton Brother to his Gra  the 'Duke of Hamilton  for good services done by hi  to his Majesties Person and Government  The state of the Con∣trey consi∣dered the People per¦sonable and hospitable Their Clo∣thes  I proceed to consider the present state of the Coun¦trey The People here are Personable and comely an  many of them as I observed are of a Ruddy complex  ¦on which may be by reason of the Sea Air and their fre¦quent Fishdiet such a colour and countenance as o  Mariners use to have and retain for some Dayes afte  they are come from Sea They are generally Hospitab  and civil giving kind and humane entertainment t  Strangers which we found to our experience Bot  Men and Women are fashionable in their cloths  Men here use Plaids as they do in our Highlands  the North Isles of  Sanda Westra  c Many of the Cou  ¦trey People wear a peice of a Skin as of a Seale comon called a Selch Calf or the like for Shoes which th  fasten to their Feet with stringes or thongs of Leathe  Their Houses are in good order and well furnish  according to their qualities  They generally speak English neither do I think  Their Lang¦uage  hey have so much of the Northern Accent as in ma∣  y places of the North of  Scotland  yet several of the  sles  have some Words and Phrases peculiar to them∣selves There are also some who speak  Norse  especial∣  in the  Mainland  as in the Parish of  Hara  there are a  w yet living who can speak no other thing this  anguage not being quite extinct among them since  e  Norvegians  whose Language it is  The Air wholsome  had this Countrey  possession And tho  Caithness  be near to  Orkney  yet none  n  Orkney  can speak  Irish  tho the greatest part in  Caith∣ness  can Nor any in  Caithness  speak  Norse  tho some in  Orkney  yet can do it  The Air as it is peircing and cold  Hence ma∣ny old Persons  so it is free and  ealthy Hence many arrive at a good old Age One  Evie  brought forth a Child in the Year of her  ge as the Minister who had enquired thereunto de∣  lared A Man in the Parish of  Holm  who died not many Years since lived with his Wife in a conjugal  ate above Years as the present Minister of the  lace informed me A Gentleman in  Stronsa  who died  bout two Years since was begotten of his Father when  Years old this was attested by the Ministers who  new the truth thereof One  William Muir  in  Westra  lived  Years and died about Years agoe by a de∣  ay of Natures heat and vigour incident to such an in∣  decrepit age without any ordinary Sickness as a Gentleman in these bounds well acquainted with him old me  They sub∣ject to the Scurvy  The disease they are most obnoxious unto  the Scurvey occasioned as is judged by the Sea∣  ir Fishes Saltmeats c It is observed likewayes that  is colder in the Summer time then it is with us in  e South but warmer in the Winter the Snow not  sing to ly long For beside other things that might  e said on this head  The temp∣erament of their Cli∣mate  which also respect other Countreys  n the Summer cold breezes come off the Sea which  empers the heat And in the Winter season the same  eezes may qualify the extreme cold and frost which  useth to be greatest when the Air is most quiescent a  least disturbed with Winds The great motion also of  rapid Tides may contribute not a litle thereunto  Their Corns and Bread  Their ordinary grains are Oats and Barley and  other grains should be sown the product would  be great if any at all they not taking with such a w  and cold soil and the many brinish blasts these Isles exposed unto As for Wheatbread it is rare and sca  to be had if not at  Kirkwal  and some Gentlemen Houses who bring the flour from  Murray  or the So  of  Scotland  As for their Oats and Barley the gra  is less and blacker then it is with us Yea tho th  should bring good and fair seed from other Countrey  within a few years it would degenerate and beco  like their own which is the reason why their Me  and Bread are of such a black colour Yet in some pl  ¦ces the Meal is whiter and said to be better then others Their not being so diligent in winnowi  their Corns nor having such good Mills for grind  as we have may be partly the cause thereof In so  place also they use not to shear their Corn but pluc  it up by the roots as we do the Lint because of t  scarcity of fodder to their beasts which Corns if o  taken pains upon will abound with sand and dul  Nevertheless for ought I hear or know their Brea  and Ale are wholesome and the Natives take we with them I thought first when we Landed in  Orkne  their Oat bread and Fleshes also had some Fishtaste but when we had tarried some Days there we we  not so sensible of it  The na∣ture of the Soil and the Product thereof  Their arable ground is better and more fertile the  at first to strangers appeareth whence I heard so  Gentlemen declare It was wonderful to think ho  great the product of these Isles is considering the man barren mountains and much waste ground that are i  them They dung their Land for the most part wit  Seaware which having gathered they suffer to rot  either on the Coasts or by carrying it up to the Lan  on Horses or on their backs they lay it in heaps the time of labouring approach Which is the rea∣  why the skirts of the Isles are more ordinarily  tivated and do more abound with Corns then  ces at a greater distance from the Sea where they  ve not such gooding at hand Their Ploughs are  tle and light having only one stilt and but little  n in them hence when at the end of the ridge  who holds it lifts it up and carries it to the other  le of the ridge and if he please may carry it home  his shoulders The reason they give of this is that  hough some of their ground be strong yet their  asts are weak and unable to go through with a plough any considerable weight  Their Horses Kine Sheep  Concer∣ning their Cattel and their price  Lambs c are of a  sser size then with us and are to be bought at an  s  er rate for a good Cow will be had for  lib  Scots  r  ib    ib  at which price they are obliged to sell  er at  K  kwal  about Martinmass A good Wedder  r  sh  Scots A Hen for  sh  or  sh    d  c The Sheep here are generally wild therefore when  hey would have them taken they ordinarily do it by Dogs trained for the purpose the Owner of the Sheep giving to the Master of the Dog  shill  Scots for each  me that is taken and it they be not so wild but  shill  Some Husband Men told us they would rather la∣bour their Land over again then take their Sheep when they would have them washen and shorn I saw young Man come from the hills wet and weary hav∣  ng a long time pursued one to kill for our use Their Kine are of divers colours some white others of  a pyed some red others red and white c  No Ri∣vers but some Brooks here which cause their Mills to go  So that  think there are as many of these colours as are of a black They have no Rivers no place of the Land being above or Miles distant from the Sea there∣fore they draw water out of wells for their Cattel or drives them to Lochs or Lakes some whereof they  have or to some small brooks which run from the Lochs Which Lochs likewise cause their Mills to go  Plenty of Cattel Butter and Milk  They have abundance of Cattel in many places whereby is afforded them plenty of Milk which yeeld¦eth much Butter some whereof is very good yellow and sweet but that which is called  Orkney Butter▪ Edinburgh  is only their FarmButter which they a  obliged to pay to the Taxmen or Masters whereof quantity according to compact and agreement bein  gathered they are at little or no trouble to make a  keep it clean Their Sheep also are very fruitful ma  of them having two and some three at a birth which as  Mr Wallace  lately  Boeth Hist de Orcad  so  Boethius  of old did observe  Oves illic pene omnes geminos immo trigeminos pleraeq  partus edunt  Their Fishes  Fishes of divers sorts are taken in great plenty y  not so numerous as formerly for now before the catch their great fishes as Keelling Ling c the must put far out into the Sea with their little boats an  thereby undergo great danger which in former time they used to get nearer the Coasts However such  number is taken that beside what serves for their own supply many are sent abroad to other Countrys fo  sale Particularly there are grey fishes called Silluks scarce half so big as a Herring generally which swee  and are taken in great numbers upon the Coasts  that sometimes they will sell of them for or  still  Scots This fish is pleasant to the taste and also they say very wholesome which seems to be confir¦med by this that in the late years of great scarcity the poorer People lived upon them almost as thei  only food they often not enjoying a crum of Bread so many  Weeks  So our good God on the shutting o  one door opened another in his holy and wise Provi¦dence for the relief of the poor  Herrings  Herrings do sweem here in abundance which for¦merly occasioned several Ships frequenting these Isles but since the Battle of  Kilsyth  they say that Trad  th failed many of the  Enster Men  who were ordi∣  ry fishers upon these Coasts being killed there  hen I was in  Papa Westra  they pointed out to me a  olm  upon the East side of the Isle where I saw the  ines of some Huts or little Houses whereunto these  nster Men  sometimes resorted during the Herring∣  hing A Gentleman living in this Isle told me that  e former Year there was a great quantity of  erring Sperm or Spawn driven upon the shore and  y there for some time in heaps which evidenceth  at Herrings in their season are yet on these Coasts  o means be not used to take them  Beside the many other excellent fishes as Keeling  Many other good Fishes  ing Scate Turbot and sometimes they say Stur∣  eon c there are also many Shell fishes taken as Lobsters sold for an half penny or  pen  Scots Oisters  uch bigger then with us for  shill  Scots per  artens and Mussels and Cockles in so great plenty  hat they make much good Lime of their shells  Lime made of Cockle shells  beside which they have no other Lime in  Orkney  save what  hey bring from the South  They have plenty both of Land and Sea Fowls  Plenty of Fowls  as Eagles Hawks EmberGoose ClaikGoose Dun∣  erGoose SolenGoose Swans Lyres Scarffs Keriwaiks  lover MuirFowl Duck and Drake c The King's Falconer useth to go every year to these  sles taking the young Hawks and Falcons to breed and every House in the Countrey is obliged to give him a Hen or a Dog except such as are exempted The Eagles do much hurt to the young store falling doun upon their Lambs and Hens and taking them away with them to their Nests Killing and pulling out the eyes and hearts of their Sheep Hence there is an Act standing in the Steward's books that whoever shall kill an Eagle shall have a Hen out of every House of the Parish where he is killed yet notwithstanding of this encouragement I hear but of few killed they fleeing high and dispatching their prey so quickly  I saw a young one in the Palace of  Birsa  almost twi  the bigness of a Goose tho not a month old it is ravenous fowl and would have run upon us if we h  not kept it of with our slaves As to its colour it  for the most part black and something of a yellow  golden colour about the Head and in some parts o  the wings It is observed of the Eagle that he do  more destruction in places at some distance from h  ¦nest then in these that are nearer it Eagles Haw  and such like fowls have their nests ordinarily o  some high ragged rock washen by the Sea beneath some of which we saw as we had occasion to sail b  them  An ac∣count of the EmberGoose  The EmberGoose tho not altogether so big as ou  LandGoose yet it useth to weigh a stone weight I  hath short wings not able to bear up the body for fleeing hence it is never seen flee neither sit on an  rock in the sea as other Fowls do but hath it's nest wherein it hatcheth its Eggs one or two at once under the Water at the foot of a rock as they infor∣med me hath been found It is of a darkish grey co∣lour and white about the neck of broad feet like ou  LandGoose and a long beck and tho ever in the Wa∣ter yet hath not I think such a strong fish taste a  the SolenGoose It is more difficult to get them shot then other Sea fowls they being very quicksighted and on the st apprehension of danger get beneath the Water Yea by reason of their many fea∣thers they will receive a shot on their breast and it not penetrate wherefore who would be at them design for their Heads or to shoor them against the feathers  And Lyre  The Lyre is a rare and delicious Sea fowl so very fat that you would take it to be wholly fat it is somewhat less then a Duck  SeaFowls numerous  The Seafowls are so numerous that a Gentleman in  Westra  told his Minister that some Years ago he for his own part killed so many as afforded him and some Years stone weight of feathers  hereby accrues to the Owners more gain then by  e flesh of the fowls tho for some seasons past he  th taken but few For it is observed that these  wls follow the small Fishes which are their ordi∣  ry food hence the mo Fishes the mo Fowls and  hen the Fishes forsake this and the other place the  wls likewise do so within a short time Because of  is abundance of Fowls therefore it is that the  entlemen and some others have the rocks in several  aces divided among them as they have their Land  hich Fowls they either kill by small shot our of Boats  the foot of the frequented rocks or else Men are let own by ropes from the top of the rocks who search  r the Nests taking the Eggs and what Fowls they  n apprehend Many kinds of the SeaFowls are of a  yed colour some of which are not to be found with  s in the South  There are here no Partridges  No Par∣tridges but abun∣dance of MuirFowls  but plenty of Muir  owls hence in some Isles they will take or  o pair in one day the hills covered with heather  eing by Nature fitted for their living and accommo∣  ation Conies also do abound in most of the Isles but  o Hares are to be seen  No Hares but Rab∣bets in a∣bundance  so that if any be brought into  he Country as they say hath been tried they will  ot live and propagate as in other places I hear of  ew if any venomous creatures in these Isles as  Boe∣  ius  of old did observe  Boeth Hist de Orcad  Serpentes aut aliud animal vene∣  osum nullum id quod de Hiborma quoque verum est  No Bees either are here  No veno∣mous Creatures  there being no provision proper  or them beside they would not take well with this  old Climate  No Trees there are in this Countrey nor Bushes  No Trees  ave a few in the Bishops Garden at  Kirkwal  which  re esteemed as a rarity for when planted and taken are of they sometime grow up the height of their Garden Wall but afterwards they gradually go back  nd decay This several Gentlemen very desirous of  aving Trees to grow declared Which then must be  imputed to the nature of the Soil and sharpness the Seaair and not to the sloth of the Inhabitant as our Historian asserts  Nulla usquam Arbor ac ne Fr  tex quidem praeter Ericam  Buchan Hist L    nec id tam coeli aut so  v  quam incolarum ignaviâ quod facile ostenditur ex arbo  radicibus quae pluribus in locis eruuntur  For tho ind  it be true that Roots and sometimes Bodies of Tree  are found in Mosses yet this is rare and only to be ha  in some places whereas Gentlemen say they brin  in exotick or foreign Plants they sow Seed for Nur∣series which useth to arrive at some greater growth then what is planted yet after all their pains and ex¦pence in using such proper means so conducive fo  obtaining their end no perfection or bearing of Frui  can be attained And that Trees which yet are b  small and look dry and withered do grow in the Bishops Garden may be because of its inclosure hav∣ing the Church on one side the Town of  Kirkwal  on another and the Bishops house on a third Which kind of fences may keep off the cold breezes that come from the Sea and destroy the growth of Tree  in other places  Tho there be no Trees and so no Fruits for the Table  Good Roots  yet there is no lack of good Roots for the Kitchen as Cabbage Carrots Parsnipes Turnipes Crummocks Artichoaks c All which useth to be bigger here then with us ordinarly especially their Artichoaks excel hence some Gentlemen do barrel and send them out of the Country for a present to their Friends Beside these they have likewise variety of Herbs in the field very beneficial to such as un∣derstand their vertue and use  Pites and Turff are the ordinary fewel they use which they have very good and in great plenty through the Country  Their few∣el  except in some places which do not so abound therewith as in  Sanda  they are obliged to bring pites from the adjacent Isles they not hav∣ing in their own Isle to suffice them And the usual  ner of agreement with the Proprietor of the  s is for so much a day for so many Peits as a Man  cast And in such places where there is scarcity  ewel the poorer sort make use of dried Kine's dung Tangles which in Summers heat they prepare for the  nters cold They have a few SaltPans in some  ces where plenty of Pites which are very useful to  Country At some times much Timber the  ack of Ships cast away at Sea or broken on their  s is driven ashore which the Inhabitants seising  p for burnwood and if good and fresh as some∣  es Ships from  Norway  suffer Shipwrack upon or nigh these Isles they make other uses of it  I  saw seve∣  Chimney pieces thereof The more ignorant People  nstruct this as a favourable Providence to them there∣  e they call these wracks  God's send  tho not so favour∣  e to the poor Mariners and others who suffer there∣    Although the Sea seemeth to favour them  Danger∣ous sailing here  by  inging such Timber and sometimes Casks and  ogsheads of Wine Brandy c to their doors yet is turbulent swelling Sea and strong Current of a  ide pays them home sore for frequently thereby their  hall Passage or FisherBoats are cast away sometimes  in them perishing at other times some saved with  fficulty And at all times it is highly dangerous  r any not experienced with these Seas to pass  rough between the Isles tho with small Boats be∣  use of the many blind Rocks lying there upon which  ometimes the Inhabitants themselves do spleet what  rough some mistake inadvertency darkness of the  ight or otherwise  The Ministers inform us  Even to the Inha∣bitants  they are often in great  anger in going to their Churches from Isle to Isle Visiting their Parishes going to the Presbytry c  ometimes pale death with its grim countenance  resenting it self and stareing them in the Face as  ne drawn out by the hair of the Head another  escaping on the Keel of the overwhelmed Boat Som  ¦times they are arrested by a storm in the Isles a  kept from their own Families for some weeks eve  when the passage will be scarce a Mile or half a mi  over They tell us in the Isle of  Westra  there w  a Marriage not long since where about Perso  were conveened from other Isles and were detaine  for or weeks together so that tho many of the  daily saw their own houses yet they durst not adve  ¦ture to pass over till the falling Wind and Sea too  off their confinement  In every Isle there is a  Wart  or  WardHill  th  highest Hill in the Isle  The  WartHill  on the top whereof they use to kindle a fire when they saw an Enemy approach¦ing or discerned any danger that so they mig  alarm the Neighbourhood that the dispersed Inhab  ¦tants of the Country having thereby notice given the  might conveen for their succour or be upon the  own Defence which Beacons on the tops of Moun∣tains the Scripture makes mention of as  Isa    And a late  Learned Author  asserteth  Edward's Scrip stile Vol    Chap    That great fla  with smoke rising up out of the City which was appoint  as a sign between the Men of  Israel  and the Lyers in wa  Judg    seems to be meant by this  The Pro∣prietors of the Country  There are several Gentlemen in  Orkney  who ha  considerable Estates but the King is the great Pro¦prietor having about the one half of the Rents of t  whole Country Which Rents are let out to Taxme  for so much per Annum as is agreed upon at the pub∣lick Roup who by their Deputes gather in the R  ¦venues of the Crown and being the Kings Stewar  they are the principal Judges of the Country T  Rents when Collected whether payed in Mone  Meal Oats Barly or Butter are ordinarly sent Sou  which causeth a great grudge among the People some  them thereby being redacted to great straits not getti  Meal Barley or the like sometimes to buy as in t  late dearth tho then the product of these Isles com¦paratively  were beyond that of many other places in  e Kingdom The Bishops Rents amounting to or    Merks per Annum  and so more considerable then  e Rents of several other Bishopricks in the Kingdom  w since the abolition of Prelacy coming in to the  ings Treasury and at his disposal are also sent  uth and not consumed within the Isles as they used  rmerly to be when the Bishops resided here at which  e People are likewise dissatisfied and thereby as some  etter acquainted with their humours and inclinations do  form me the Presbyterian Government is made the  ess acceptable to many of them  The People greatly cry out of the Oppression they groan under  The Peo∣pel com∣plain of oppression  by reason of the frequent change of Stew∣  rds their Masters who being Taxmen and so only  o continue for such a definite time each endeavours  o gather in his Rents and that as soon as may be which many of the poor People cannot get so quickly given whereupon several of them are put to doors and all taken from them which hath occasioned much of the King's Land now to be lying waste and lee Whereas if they always had one Master their Circumstances might be much better for sometimes it so falleth out that the HusbandMan will gain as much in one year as will compense the loss of another the Master like∣wise would be more encouraging to them and con∣cerned in their wellfare and they having Leasses set them would more endeavour the improving of their ground which now they do not they not knowing but the next year they may have a new Master whose little Finger may be thicker then his Predecessours Loyns Yet let not my Reader judge that  I  hereby intend the Impeachment of any particular Person or Persons who have been Taxmen there or now are but my design is to shew that this is the common complaint of the Coun∣try both in  Orkney  and  Zetland  The Gentlemen tell us  Their Hol∣ding  they have another kind of Holding here then is in other places and the best right  they have to their Lands is that which they call  Udall right  a Possession which the Natives successively have without either Charter or Seasin All their Lands be∣ing either such  Udall Land    or  Kings Lands  or  Fewed Lands  This  Udall right  is said to be called from one  Ulans  King of  Norway  who when he possessed the Countrey gave to the Inhabitants a Right to so much Land he alwayes retaining to himself the d part and enjoying the increase thereof

Parishes belong∣ing to  Orkney  are enumerated and breifly described  HAVING geven some description of  Orkney  in gener∣al  The Num∣ber of the  Orkney Isles  I shall now give some more particular account of the several Isles thereunto belonging Which are di∣vided into such as are Inhabited and so are more com∣monly called  Isles  And such as are not Inhabited which they call  Holms  only useful for Pasturage The Isles are said to be in number viz  Pomona  or the  Mainland  being much larger then any of the rest  Gram¦sey Hoy Swinna SouthRonaldsha Burra Lamb∣holm Flotta Faira Cava

sometimes inhabit∣ed in the Summer time and  Waes  which in a high  ream is divided from  Hoy  whereunto it is joyned by low and narrow neck of Land As also the  Calf  of  Eda  it having a Salt Pan in it It may be observed  hat most of the Names of these Isles end in a or  ey  which in the  Teutonick Tongue  signifieth Water to shew  hat these Isles are pieces of Land surrounded with Water  The first is  P  mona  or the  Mainland  Pomona  or the  Main∣land  The Town of  Kirkwal  described  said to be Miles in length  rom East to West and in some places  or Miles broad nigh to the midle whereof is the  Toun  of  Kirkwal  about quarters of a Mile in length from South to North the only remarkable Toun in  ll this Countrey and beside which there is no other RoyalBurgh in  Orkney  or  Zetland  The  Danes  who  ad the  Orcades  long in possession called it  Cracoviaca  which Name  Buchanan  takes to be the same with  Kirk∣wal  but corrupted "Quod Dani Cracoviacam appela∣  bant nunc nomine corrupto Kircua Scotis dicitur It  andeth upon the North side of the Isle in a low and moist Ground hence a Minister in this Countrey told me that in several places of their large Church where  he more respected Burgers ordinarily Bury their Dead they can scarce dig two foot of Earth but Water will rise so that he hath seen when they Interred the Corps  hey behoved to press them doun in the water till the Mold or Earth was cast upon them It is now much  ecayed as to Trade and Number of Inhabitants as many ancient Burghs in this Kingdom are In it hath  een two stately Edifices the  King's  and the  Bishops Palace  he former is now very ruinous being the Ancientest  f the two built as is thought by some of the Bishops  f  Orkney  It having the vestige of a Bishops Mitre  nd Armes Engraven upon the Wall that looks to the  reet And in which it is said the Bishops of old  had their Residence The other called the  Bishop's Palace  wherein the Bishops lately lived was built by  Patrick Stewart Earl of Orkney  Anno son to  Robe  Stewart Natural Son to King James  the th This Palace i  also goeing to Ruine Tho with some expence i  could be keept in good Repair  the Church of  Kirkwal  The Church is a very noble and large Structure Hav  ¦ing in it or strong Pillars on each side Th  teeple standing on bigger and higher Pillars in th  midle of the Church wherein there are several old an  good Bells In the Easter part only of this grea  Church is Divine service performed which is furnish¦ed with good Seats for accommodating the Inhabitants and other conveniencies proper for that end It i  commonly called  St Magnus Church  being built  at least as some say the foundation laid by  Mag¦nus King of Norway  Whom they report to have bee  Buried here Tho others say he was Buried in  Eagle  sha  an Isle to the North of  Kirkwal  There are ma∣ny of this name of  Magnus  in this Country  A safe Road at  Kirkwal  At  Kirkwal  there is a safe Road But Ships comin  from the South cannot get so easily into it by reaso  that the same Wind which brings them to  Orkney  o  ¦ten will not suffer them to turn up to  Kirkwal  the  being obliged to encompass a point of Land stretchin  to the NorthEast before they can make the Road  that frequently they ly at  Elwick  or  DeerSound  tw  Anchoring places to the East or NorthEast of  Kirw  until that the Wind shall favour them  Goodgrass and Corn in some places of the  Main∣land  The  Kings House  in  E  a  On the  Mainland  good Corns do grow in several pl  ¦ces tho likewayes there be much moorish Ground b  the pleasentest part of the Isle  I  take to be the West e  thereof about  Birsa Hara Sandwick  and  Stromness  whe  there are several spots well furnished with Grass a  Corn In the Parish of  Birsa  is the Kings House situat  ¦on a plain Champain Ground on the West end of t  Mainland  nigh to the Sea or  Deucaledonian Ocean  whi  rmerly when in order hath had several pleasant and di∣  erting Avenues about it At a large quarter of a Miles  istance to the south we saw the pleasantest mixture of  owans so commonly called or Daisies white and yellow  n every side of the way growing very thick and co∣  ering a considerable piece of the Ground that ever  ve had occasion to see The Palace was Built in form  f a Court by  Robert Stewart Earl of Orkney  about the  ear it is two stories high the upper hath been  rettily decored the Ceiling being all Painted and  hat for the most part with Schems holding forth scrip∣  ureHistories as  Noah's Floud Christ's Riding to Jer∣  salem  c And the scripture is set doun beside the Fi∣  ure It was Inhabited within these Years but is  ow fast decaying When we entered the Palace gate we  w above it that Inscription so much talk  of and re∣  uted treasonable by "King James the th Robertus  Steuartus Filius Jacobi ti Rex Scotorum hoc Aedifici∣  um instruxit which inscription could not but offend  he lawful Heir of the Croun for it cannot well be  hought that the Earl and all about him were such blun∣derers in the Latine Tongue as to put doun  Rex  in stead of  Regis  if there had been no design in it Within  he Palace we saw also the Motto above his Arms  Sic  uit est erit  which was a piece of too great arrogancy  or any Man to assume that unto himself which prop∣erly belongs to the Son of GOD whose wise Judge∣ment is not unworthy of our Remark that now only  t can be said of his House and Family now extinct  Dan  ic suit  Which that great King  Nebuchadnezar  knew  o his experience  That these who walk in pride God is able to abase  Among other pleasant places in this West end of the  Mainland  we may take notice of  KirfalHill  Kirfal Hill  a litle to the East of the House of  Brachness  in the Parish of  Sandwick  which is very large on the top and plain almost like a BowlingGreen so that or Men could easily be drawn up in order thereupon It is all over very  green without any Heath or such like growing there nei∣ther are there any rising Hillocks on it that we could dis∣cern as ordinarly are to be seen on other Hills and be∣cause of it's being so very pleasant the Inhabitants about call it  ChearfulHill  Loch  of  Stennis  Within a few Miles also of he Westend of the  Mainland  is the Loch of  Stenni  the largest in  Orkney  whereon are some Mills some Trouts and Sal∣monGilses are found in it and the Brooks that run from it  Several good Har∣bours on the  Main∣land  Beside  KirkwalRoad  there are several other Har∣bours or Bays on the  Mainland  wherein Ships can safe∣ly ly as one at  Kerston  a small Village at the West end of the  Mainland  much frequented by Ships going to the West of  Scotland  or  Ireland  or coming therefrom Another is at  Holmssound  towards the SouthEast side of the Isle to which sometimes Barks do resort from the South several Ships also going through Land from the South to the WestSea drop Anchor here and when they pass they must Sail between  Lambholm  a litle Isle in the  Sound  and the  Mainland  for the way on the other side between  Lambholm  and  Burra  tho it seem more open yet it is they say shallow and dang∣erous But none I think will dare to Sail through these Isles without some measure both of skill and experi∣ence else it will be to the hazard of their lives and the loss of Ship and Cargo There being several Turnings BlindRocks and Shallows Wherefore many do judge it the safest Course to keep the WideSea and so Sail without the Isles especially if the Weather be not well set and promising Another convenient Road is at  Deersound  to the East of the  Mainland  where a great Bay commodious for Navies to ride in Some other Harbours and Bays also there are upon the  Mainland  but these are the most remarkable  A Ship cast away  Nigh to the point of  DeerNess  some Years ago was cast away a Ship transporting some Prisoners to  Ameri∣ca  who were for the most part WestCountry Men ap∣prehended Emprisoned and then Banished for adhering to Presbyterian Principles There were as is said  ove who Perished being kept under the Hatches  ed together by pairs whereas if they had been at li∣  rty the greatest part if not all might have been sav∣  as a few were then upon Deck with the Mari∣  ers The Countrey People here did and do think that  e Captain of the Ship willingly suffered her to drive  on this point and the Men there to Perish and if so is probable that others tho not Aboard have been  ncerned in this mischievous desing as the Authors  d Abettours thereof  In the  Mainland  are  Parishes but Kirks  The Isle of  Copinsha  for  any Ministers in  Orkney  have and some Kirks  herein they ordinarily Preach by turns the first is  eerness  and S  t  Andrews  at the Eastend of the Isle  here two Kirks one at  Deerness  and

North in many places a Mile or a mile and  half and in some scarce half a mile broad having  veral tongues of Land washen by the Sea hence some  o compare it to the shape of a Lobster No place in the

payeth to  e King Chalders of Victual every one of which  h  lders is Bolls of our Measure The whole Isle  but as one rich Cuningar or a Cony Warren for I  ever saw a greater number of Conies runing in any  lace then I did here Hence the Heretors kill  everal hundreds of them yearly for their use There  e several Bays for Ships as  Kitletoft O  terswick  and  aphness Bay  Some Gentlemen also who have consi∣  erable Interests as  Burgh Lapness c  Many Fowls  equent this Isle as Duck and Drake Plover c  o that there is good sport for the Fowler The Stir∣  ns or Stares are as numerous I judge as the Spar∣  ows are with us  In  Sanda  are two Ministers one having one Kirk  alled  LadyKirk  on the East side of the Isle towards  he North end thereof in this Isle are some sober  nowing and good People particularly in this Lady Parish in the former Presbyterian times there was a Godly Zealous Minister Mr  Arthur Murray  who went South after the Revolution  An  and died  here some of the old people yet alive who were un∣  er his Ministry cannot speak of him without Tears  The Righteous shall he had in everlasting remember∣ance The other Minister hath under his inspection three Kirks two

Ro∣nalsha  and dangerous for Seamen who cannot discover them at any distance especially in a misty day or dark night till close upon them and so are ready to suffer Ship wrack as many do  The Isle of  Westra  To the West of  Sanda  lyes  Westra  seven Miles long it is well Inhabited having much Corn in it here is  F  tta Hill  where they say the Fairies are frequently seen it is the highest hill in all the Northern Isles of  Orkney  In the North end of this Isle is the Castle of  Noutland  built by  Gilbert Balfour  for the use o  James Hepburn  Earl of  Bothwell  The  Castle  of  Nout∣land  Married to  Queen Mary  the of  May An  in the  Abbey of Holy Roodhouse  who fearing he should not always retain and enjoy his present Grandure which the Nobles en∣vied him for he likewise being suspected guilty of the Murder of my Lord  Darli  her former Husband caused build this strong Castle which upon a change of the Scene he might betake himself unto situated upon a Rock nigh to the Deucaledonian Ocean having plain Champain ground about it It is Stories high and the lowest is strongly Vaulted above which i  a large Hall having two Airholes through the Arch so to give a vent to the Pouder if at any time they showld be surprised with a blast the walls ar  very thick and all the free stone for the building was brought from the South The Roof is flat and fenced with Rayls of Stone whence we have a sai  view of the circumjacent Country There are severa  hols or slits in the Building not only to let in the light but to gall an approaching Enemy with smal shot if at any time they should be attacked But the Lord often taking the Sinner in his own craftiness  uffered him not so to escape by sheltering himself in this Nest This Castle was never compleated for in one part thereof the Walls are but half the height in∣  ended and never hitherto covered with a Roof and  e being pursued by the Lords of the Congregation never possessed it or so much as saw it if not at a distance for he taking himself to Sea with two or three Ships came to  Kirkwal  in  Orkney  and being dri∣ven thence by  William Kircaldy  of  Grange  he fled to  Zetland  where the Pursuer had almost overtaken him if the Pilots skill in these Seas had not made a way to escape in holding down by the side of a blind Rock well enough known to the Pilot which the Pursuer ignorant of spleet upon which Rock to this day is called the  Ʋnicorn  from the Name of the Ship that perished upon it  Bothwel  escaped to  Norway  where being apprehended he was taken to  Denmark  and cast into a filthy Prison where he died after years Imprisonment His wicked life having this mi∣serable end Tho hand join in hand the wicked shall not go unpunished and ordinarly Murder where∣of he was suspected to be guilty so cryeth from the ground that it bringeth down remarkable and often tremendous Judgments in time There are several Gentlemens Houses in  Westra  The Minister of  Westra  hath three Churches where∣in he Preacheth  per vices  two in  Westra  one at the west end of the Isle called the  WestKirk  and another nigh to the North end called the  NorthKirk  the third Church is in  PapaWestra  a little Isle of Miles long from South to North  The Isle of  PapaWestra  Betwixt it and  Westra  there is a convenient Harbour for Ships at  Piriwa  As also in the same Sound a little to the North of this Harbour lyes a holm wherein there hath been a little Chapel whereof some of the ruinous Walls are yet to be seen  PapaWestra  aboundeth with Rabbets and hath some Corn Land but not so much as some other Isles it being hard and stonny ground It belongeth to a Gen∣tleman  called  Holland  and hath been reputed famous for  St Trodwells Chappel  and  Loch  or  Lake  To the Ea  of this Isle lyeth the Holm where the  Easter Men  had their Hutts as above  The Isle of  Rousa  To the South of  Westra  lyes  Rousa  an Isle Miles long full of heathy Hills abounding with Moor Fowls there is not much corn in it and but thinly in∣habited There is a Loch and Mill thereon that goeth ordinarily all the Summer over which is rare in these Isles The Minister of  Rousa  hath two Kirks one in  Rousa  and another in  Eglesha  The Isle of  Eglesha  a pleasant Isle two Mil  s long where a Church much frequented by supersti∣tious People with a high Steeple seen at a great distance where as some would have it  St Magnus  was buried To his Charge also belongs  Inhallo  The Isle of  Inhallo  a little Isle to the West of  Rousa  also  Wyre  a small Isle  The Num∣ber of Parishes  Thus  I  have glanced at the Description of the  Orca∣des  most of which  I  have had occasion to see wherein we see there are Parishes in the  Mainland  Viz  Kirkwall Holm Deerness  and  St Andrews Evie  and  Rendat Firth  and  Stennis Orphir B  rsa  and  Hara Sandwick  and  Stromness  and in the other Isles Sciz  South Ronalsha  and  Burra Waes  and  Flotta Hoy  and  Gramsey Shapinsha Stronsa  and  Eda Lady Kirk  in  Sanda Cross Kirk  and  Burness in Sanda  and  North Ro∣nalsha Westra  and  Papa Westra Rousa  and  Eglesha  But there are Kirks And these Ministers look upon themselves as more happily posted who have only one Kirk especially if they have not more Kirks in seve∣ral Isles this tending more to the Edification of the People under their Charge and consequently to their peace and encouragement they every Lords Day dis∣pensing Ordinances in the same place to the same People whereas these who have more Kirks commit∣ted to them are sometimes obliged to preach in one place and sometimes in another and the People gene∣rally frequent but their ou  Kirk especially if they be in different Isles hence ordinarily they enjoy the Ordi∣nances  only every other Sabbath and in some places  t one of three which cannot but obstruct the pro∣  ss of the Gospel among them Besides it is uneasy  ensive and dangerous for them to travel from Isle to  e and sometimes a storm arising they are necessarily  ained there The stipends here are small and for  most part payed by the Stewart or his Depute the  ng being the principal Proprietour yet they can  e very well upon them Victuals being had at an  ie rate  The People are generally tractable  People re∣spectful of their Mi∣nisters  submissive and  pectful to their Ministers which is very desirable  d encouraging to these who labour among them  hen true Zeal enlargeth the desires and putteth an  ge upon the Spirits of Pastors in the discharge of the  rd's  Work for the good of Souls  CHAP IV  ome things remarkable in  Orkney  as Ancient Monuments strange Providences c are represented  HAving taken a view of the Countrey in general  Things re∣markable in  Orkney  and the several Isles in particular I shall now di∣  ert my Reader with some things remarkable not together unworthy of our Observation such as some  ncient Monuments strange Accidents and some  her things not only curious and delectable but also  ofitable to the Judicious affording matter "of medi∣tation to the wise Observers of these things who re∣gard the Works of the Lord and duely ponder the operation of his hands in the years of Ancient and Latter times  The first we take notice of is the Stone  The Dw  rfie Stone  called the  warfie Stone  lying in a Valley between two Hills to  e North of the Hill of Hoy it is about foot long  or broad and thick hollowed by the hand  of some Mason as the Print of the MasonIrons do  shew it hath a square hole for the Entry looking  the East foot high with a stone proportionab  standing before this Entry at foot distance with at one end is hewen out a bed with a pillow where two Persons may ly almost at their full length opp  ¦site to this at the other end is something also hew  out like a Couch between which Bed and Couch the  is a large Hole above about the bigness of the Entry through which a Person may come up to the top  the Stone and might serve for a Vent to the smok  if so be they had put any fire upon a Hearth betwe  the two Beds Beneath this stone runs to the South  cold and pleasant spring which might afford drink  the Inhabitant Who hewed this stone or for wh  use it was we could not learn the Common Traditi  among the People is That a Giant with his Wi  lived in this Isle of  Hoy  who had this stone for the  Castle But I would rather think seeing it could  accomodate any of a Gigantick stature that it mig  be for the use of some Dwarf as the Name seems import or it being remote from any House might the retired Cell of some Melancholick Hermite T  stone also may be called the  Dwarfie Stone per A  ¦phrasin  or by way of Opposition it being so  great  Some∣thing shines wonder∣fully on the  WartHill of Hoy  To the NorthWest of this Stone is an high Mo  ¦tain of a steep Ascent called the  WartHill of Hoy  loo  ¦ing to the North Nigh to the top of which Hill ab  MidDay is seen something and that at a good  ¦stance which glitters and shines wonderfully a  tho some have climbed up and searched for it  could find nothing It shines most in the summer ti  The People talk of it as some enchanted Carb  ¦cle Others take it to be a Water that reflecteth  Sun's Rays and so causeth such a sparkling and spl  ¦dour But a Gentleman who liveth nigh to  Rock told us that is shines most in the greatest Drought  hen no Water is near it  At the West end of the Mainland  A street of stones of diffe∣rent fi∣gures  about a Mile  d an half to the West of the House of  Skeal  on the  p of high Rocks there is something like a street  ear to a Quarter of a Mile in length and between  and foot in breadth all laid with Stones of  fferent Figures and Magnitudes of a Reddish co∣  ur some of which stones bear the Image and Repre∣  ntation of a  Heart  others of a  Crown  others of a  hoe  a  Leg  a  Last  a  Weavers Shuttle  c And that  hich renders it yet the more strange is when these  ones are raised many of them have the same figure and  ape below on the one side that they have above on  e other which street all beholders look on as very wonderful  I  saw a part of the Garden Wall of the House of  Skeal  decored in the forepart thereof with  hese stones we intended to have sent a parcel of them  outh to our Friends as a rarity if they had not been  orgot at our return from  Zetland  Whether these  tones be so laid and figured by Art or by Nature will  e hard to determine For there is no House nigh to  his street neither are the ruines of any which former∣  y have been there to be seen So puzling are the Works of God to the most ingenious and accurate ob∣servers of Providence  At the Loch of  Stennis  in the  Mainland  A Circle of stones  in that part thereof where the Loch is Narrowest both on the West and East side of the Loch there is a Ditch within which there is a Circle of large and high stones  erected The larger Round is on the Westside above  paces Diameter the Stones set about in form of  Circle within a large Ditch are not all of a

which there is not an equal distance but many  of them are about or foot distant from  other On the other side of the Loch over which  pass by a Bridge laid with stones after the manner of street the Loch there being shallow are two ston  standing of a like bigness with the rest whereof o  hath a round hole in the midst of it at a little distan  from which stones there is another Ditch about ha  a Mile from the former but of a far less Circumferenc  within which also there are some stones standing something bigger then the other stones on the We  side of the Loch in form of a Semicircle I think ra¦ther then of a Circle opening to the East for I s  no stones that have fallen there save one which wh  standing did complete but the Semicircle Both  the East and West end of the bigger Round are tw  green Mounts which appear to be Artificial In on  of which Mounts were found  Mr Wal∣lace Des∣c  iption of Orkney  saith Mr  Wallace    Fibulae  of silver round but opening in one plac  like to a Horseshoe  It is most probably thought that these were the High Places in times of  Pagan Idolatry  whereon sacrifice were offered and that the two Artificial Mounts o  Earth served for the same

opened some years ago there was nothing  ound in it save the piece of a Backbone of a Man  reater then the Backbone of any Horse This the Minister of the place declared unto me who saw the Grave opened and measured it from the Head to the  oot stone thereof who also for some time had the  one in his Custody The vulgar Tradition is that  here was a Giant there who was of so tall a stature  hat he could have stood upon the ground and put the Copstone upon the Chappel which no Man now liv∣  ng by far could do  And in  Westra  There are also Bones found in  Westra  between  Tukey  and the  West Church  as great as Horsebones as the Minister of Westra informed me And some there have been lately of a Gigantick stature in these Isles A  that Man who died not long since whom for hi  height they commonly called the  Meikle Man of Waes  Several  Obelisks  through the Coun∣trey  Through this Countrey we find several  Obelsiks  o  very high and great stones set up as one in the Isle o  Eda  another on the Mainland within a Mile of  B  c they appear to be much worn by the washing o  Wind and Rain which shewes they are of a long stand∣ing and it is very strange to think how in these place  and times they got such large stones carried and erected  Mirabile profecto quisquis ea spectaverit  Boeth in vitam Ma  us  quâ art  quibus Corporis viribus lapides tantâ mole in unu  locum fuerint congesti  The Reason and End of their setting up cannot be certainly known however we may conjecture that probably it was in remembrance of som  famous Battle or hath been the Ancient Funeral Monu¦ments of some renouned Persons who have fallen i  Battle or been buried there Several of which stone and Monuments are to be seen in many places through  Scotland  and in  Norway  they are very common a  our Travellers who have seen them inform me An  it is like these stones have been set up by the Norve¦gians when they possessed this Countrey  The Bi∣shops of  Orkney  at their st Landing used to be presented with a large Cup full of strong drink  In  Scapha  about a Mile from  Kirkwal  to SouthWe  it is said there was kept a large and ancient Cup whic  they say belonged to St  Magnus King of Norway  wh  first instructed them in the Principles of the  Christian Rel  ¦gion  and founded the  Church  of  Kirkwal  with which fu  of some strong drink their Bishops at their first Landin  were presented which if he drank out they highly prai  ¦ed him and made themselves to beleive that the  should have many good and fruitful Years in his tim  This  Buchannan  relates and as Mr  Wallace

learn where it was And  deed that which renders this the more credible is  at the  Norvegians  at present as Merchants and Mari∣  ers inform us have a custom like unto this that if any  ome to pay them a visite especially if they be strangers  hey use to present them with a large Cup full of drink which they take not well if their guests drink not out They say some of these Cups will contain three Mutchkins others a Pint and some a Quart of our Measure  The Wind and Sea  The Sea in a storm beats most vehement∣ly on the Rocks  in any storm beats most tem∣pestuously and vehemently here upon the Rocks a  ittle to the West of  Kerston  in the  Mainland  there is a Rock called the  Black Craig of Stromness  about Fath∣oms high Upon which in a Storm the Sea from the  Deucaledonian Ocean  doth beat with such violence and force that the Waves breaking thereupon cause the Wa∣ter to rise to the top of the Rock like Snow and flee like a whit Sheet before the Wind blasting the Corns for or Miles behind the Rock if it fall out In or a little before Harvest And this it doth likewise in several other places of the Countrey as some Gentlemen who knew it to their experience did declare Yea so great is the violence of these Tempestuous Seas that thereby some great Stones are cast out and others are worn so that large Caves in some places run from the Sea within the Rock beneath the Ground for some considerable way I saw one of these at the Eastend of the  Mainland  in the Parish of  Holm  it is all covered above with the Rock and Earth save that within these few Years some of the  Rock and Earh fell in or was blown up as they ca  it in one night by a violent Storm blowing from Sou  East hence now there is a hole in the Hill above lik  the Eye of a Coalpit which is terrible to look do  into There is another something like this in  Sou  Ronalsha  In these Caves Doves and Sea Fowls in gre  numbers use to Nestle  Several strange Fishes sometimes seen here and little Whales c  Several strange Fishes are here taken or cast ashor  sometimes which are they say very beautiful to loo  upon but we never had occasion to see any of them There are likewise a great number of little Whales whic  sweem through these Isles which they call spoutWhale or Pellacks some of which I have seen and they tel  us it is dangerous for Boats to fall in among them le  they be overturned by them The former Year Anno There were of these Whales driven ashor  upon  Gairsay's Land  and upon  Eglesha's  about on  time as the Gentlemen themselves did inform me o  which Oyl is made very benificial to the Masters of th  Ground The Ottars also Seals or Selchs and othe  such SeaCreatures are very numerous but now thei  number is so much diminished that not one o  Twenty is to be seen and they have found severa  of them lying dead upon the Shore some hence ob¦serving that the Judgements of GOD as to scarci¦ty of suitable Provisions to these Creatures are upo  the Waters also  The Tides Rapid  The Tides here are so rapid that they will carry  Ship alongs with them tho the Wind be contrary  not very strong and in going among these Isles scarc  are they out of one Tide when they are engaged in an  other and in going from place to place they will find sonetimes the same Flood for them and at other times against them and so with the Ebb Especially there are some impetuous Tides which they call  Rousts  caused by the strong current of a Tide meeting with a narrow pass∣age the quickness and rapidity of the Tide compensing the  narrowness of the passage as it is in Lanes which  tens the blowing Wind and makes the Wind to  w so much the harder in a proportion to the pres∣  e it suffers by the straits of the Lane So may we  on concerning the Rousts which run among the Isles  ave seen some of these Rousts boyl like unto a seeth∣  ot with their high white and broken Waves and  t in a calm Summer Day when there was no Wind  wing At one time Sailing by the side of  Lasha Roust  ween  Sanda  and the  Calf of Eda  the Roust getting  ne hold of us turned about the head of our Boat  y quickly and tho there were able young Men  ing beside the help we had by the Sail we could  without great difficulty make our way through it  hey tell us that if the greatest Ship in  Britain  fell into  s Roust where it is strongest it would turn her ab∣  at its pleasure and detain her till the Tide fell weak  n tho she had a right favourable Gale These Rousts  more dangerous in an Ebb then in a Flood the Ebb  ng observed still  taeteris paribus  to make the foulest  t most Tempestuous Sea and especially they'le Foam and  g if the Tide be running in the Winds eye And when  re is any storm they will cause any Ship or Boat to stand end and be ready to sink her in the fall Several of which  usts we had occasion to meet with but the Lord  ought us safe through  Tho the General Current of the Tide be still the  e from West to East in a Flood  Some strange Re∣ma  ks a∣bout the Tides  and from East to  est in an Ebb yet running with violence upon the  nd they cause a contrary motion in the Sea next to  which they call  Easter  or  Wester Birth  according to Course And there are some things which have been  served as very strange in the running of the Tides  that it flows two hours sooner on the West side of  nda  then it doth on the East And at  Hammoness  in  e same  sle both Ebb and Flood runns one way ex∣  pt at the b  ginning of a quick stream when for or  ures the Flood runs South in  North Faira  the Sea  Ebbs hours and Flows but But the reasons of  Phenomena will not be so intricate or hard to res  if we consider the situation of these Isles whe  Tide see  s to alter his Course for the Flood co  from the West to the West side of  San  a  it t  some time before it can get about the point  the Isle to the South side thereof so in  North  the Sea is more open whence the Flood cometh the Ebb runeth through several Isles turning m  points of Land before it come to  North Faira  w  cannot but retard its motion So at  Hammoness Sanda  the Situation of the place much determineth running of the Tide  The rapid motion of these Tides makes sailing dangerous  The rapid motion of these Tides among the Isle  and their meeting with one another makes it very d  ¦gerous and sometimes more especially in a Calm a Minister there told us that he was never near death in his Life then in a de  d Calm when night  Westra  for they saw the Sea coming which th  thought should swallow them up and there being  Wind they could not get out of the way but God so  ¦dered it in his wise Providence that the Sea or sw  of the Sea which they feared broke on the forepa  of the Boat and so they escaped  There are frequently  F  nmen  seen here upon t  Coasts  Finmen  frequently seen here  as one about a year ago on  S  onsa  and an  ¦ther within these few Months on  Westra  a Gentle¦man with many others in the Isle looking on him nig  to the shore but when any endeavour to apprehen  them they flee away most swiftly Which is ver  strange that one Man sitting in his little Boat shou  come some hundred of Leagues from their ow  Coasts as they reckon  Finland  to be from  Orkney  may be thought wonderfull how they live all th  time and are able to keep the Sea so long His Bo  is made of Seal skins or some kind of Leather  also hath a Coat of Leather upon him and he sitte  in the middle of his Boat with a little Oar in h  Fishing with his Lines And when in a storm he the high surge of a wave approaching he hath  y of sinking his Boat

Chappel whereof some of the sidewalls are only  w standing in which they say there were seven Si∣  s buried who were Nuns and desired to ly in this  lm about whose Graves this Chappel was built  out a

de∣scription of  Orkney  which shews that such places have  en Cemeteries or burying places for their dead of  d of a square figure and the stones are joined to∣  ether by some cement when opened Earth and some∣  imes Bones are found in them The reason some do give of this is because the way of interring dead bodies among many of the Ancients as among the  Saxons  n the  Isle of Britain  was not in deep Graves but un∣der Clods or Turfs of Earth made into Hillocks But none of these we had occasion to see Concerning that Rock called  Less  surrounded with the Sea nigh to the  Nouphead  in  Westra  upon which some say if any Man go having Iron on him the Sea will instantly  rage so that no Boat can come nigh to take him  nor the sea be setled till the piece of Iron be cast  to it when in  Westra  we enquired about it  found no ground for the truth thereof  A remark∣able provi∣bence  Mr  Wallace  narrates a remarkable Providence wh  the Ministers here confirmed to us as a truth C  ¦cerning four Men in  Stronsa  who u  ed to  ish togeth  in one Boat among whom there was one  John  ne  whole Wife being desirous he should inter  it  Fishing for a time he having purchassed a great

Innern  ss  and was almost the length of the Isle of  Eda  where he lived the Boat turned and lay upon her side but the Sails being spread in the water hindred the Mast to go down and her altogether to overturn much of what they had in went to the Sea and he with the other Seamen in Company sat upon the side of the Boat and so were for some hours tossed up and down whither the Tide did drive them they in the mean time comforting and refreshing one another with places of Scripture and notes of Sermons which lately they had heard and sometimes puting up earnest Prayers to God whom the Wind and Seas do obey At length God not turning  away his Mercy from them nor their Prayer from  im graciously gave ear unto their cry and  rought them all safe ashore together with the Boat on  he west side of  Sanda  much of the Timber and what  hey had in being driven ashore to that same very place  efore them A great Mercy when not only they but  heir Boat and most of their Loadening were saved  ome of these Men whom I am acquainted with and  o judge Godly cannot speak of this deliverance but  ith great concernedness and affec  ion which makes  e to think this Mercy not to have been a cast of  ommon Providence but a gracious Return of their  rayer  The Effects of Thunder in this Country are very  urprising  The effects of thun∣derstrange  The Steeple of  Kirkwal  was brunt with Lightening And  A  there was a Gen∣  leman in  Stromness  in the west end of the  Mainland  nd a stall wherein there were Kine the Thun∣  r killed every other one killing one and passing  other so that there were killed and alive  his the Ministers confirmed as a certain truth to their  nowledge  There was a Man that died not many years ago  An Eagle taketh up a Child  ho when a Child being left in the Field the Mo∣ther as some say shearing at a little distance from  im was taken up by an Eagle and carried from  he Parish of  Orphir  in the  Mainland  to the Isle of  Waes  ver or Miles of Sea but in God's good Pro∣  idence the Eagle being quickly pursued to his Nest  hither the Child was taken he was recovered with∣  ut any hurt  It was observed that in these Isles before the late earth there were several strange Birds seen  Several strange birds seen  such as  hey have not seen formerly nor since One of the Mi∣nisters told me that one Bird frequented his House  bout that time for a quarter of an Year which was  f a black white red and green Colour As also he  saw another all stripped or sprainged on the back which Birds were beautiful to behold  There was a Monster about Years ago born of one  Helen Thomson  Spouse to  David Martin  Weaver in  North Ronalsha  A monster born  having its Neck between Head and Shoulders a quarter and an half of an yard long with a Face Nose Eyes Mouth c to the Back as well as before so that it was two Faced which Monster came living into the World This the Minister declared unto us having taken the Attestation of the Women present at the Birth he not being on the place at the time And it is said that a certain Woman should have wished this unto the Mother whom she alledged had lied upon her in her wrath wishing that if she spoke a lie she might bring forth a Monster which accordingly came to pass in God's Holy and Wil  Providence  Concern∣ing mines shells c  Some say there are several Mines of Silver Tin Lead c Also some Veins of

Discourse concern∣ing  Orkney  I shall give an Account of some C  ¦stoms yet prevailing among them which can be con¦structed  to be nothing else save the sour dregs of Pa∣  an and Popish Superstition and Idolatry yea and ma∣  y of them such as the Charms practised by them  o be the meer and woful effects of pure Devilry and  ot the product of Natures Operation  But least I should be mistaken I judge it not amiss  o premise  A caution given  That not all nay nor the generality of  Orkney  re hereby impeached as guilty of these evils for I know there are many judicious and wise Men and I hope some real Christians among them who abhor  nd detest such things as much as any but hereby some  oolish and silly ones are intended whom deceiving  nd being deceived Satan leadeth Captive at his will Nor yet that all the Isles are alike lying under the Charge for there are some of them whose Inhabitants  re generally more Moral and Discreet Neither is it  lledged that such sinful and corrupt Customs pre∣vail as much now as formerly for they are much away  y what they were and that even of late Nor is  t denied but that honest and faithful Ministers will  abour to have them abolished every where seeing alas There is much horrid wickedness and manifest Devilry  oo with us in the South as well as with them in the North so that no part of the Kingdom can plead  not guilty  But my principal Scope and Design  My design in this chap  is to manifest  he Works of Darkness and to shew how busy the God of this World is in deluding and blinding poor Souls and now ready we are to be his drudges and slaves that so these things being wisely and seriously considered all may be induced to make a Christian improvement thereof both with respect to themselves and others whom they are called to pity and pray for  If peradventure God will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth that they may be recovered out of the snare of the Devil  And more especially that the General Assem∣blies and other Judicatories of this Church as they are called may be pleased to continue their Fatherly Care  over these Northern Isles that tho they bee remo  from them as to Situation yet they may be near unto them as to a warm and kindly affection which o  Church hath not been wanting in hitherto  Some things pro¦per to be premised  And st we would take notice that the old Max¦ime  Ignorance is the mother of Devotion  so much crye  up by the Papists and their judicially blinded Clergy i  so far from being the Mother of Devotion that it i  both the Mother and Nurse of the most damnable Er¦rours Superstitions and Delusions as these Isles kno  to their sad Experience for Ignorance of the Princi∣ples of our Holy Religion doth greatly prevail among the Commonalty so that as one of their Ministers no  without some concern and greif for the same told me▪ Not one of a hundred in some of their Parishes can read How this comes to pass that the People should be so grossly Ignorant I shall not undertake to determine it is commonly imputed to their want o  Schools through the Country which indeed I will not say but is one great cause thereof and therefore that this so very dreadful an evil may be effectually re∣medied care should be taken by all concerned that Schools be Erected in every Parish and a competen  Salary provided for the Masters Maintainance and En∣couragement and that also in every Isle where there is any number of inhabitants some Person should be appointed for the Instruction and Education of their Children and until that such a course be taken the People generally will be Ignorant still and the Mini∣sters as to the Preaching part may complain in the words of the Prophet  Isa    Whom shall we teach knowledge and whom shall we make to understand doctrine then that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts  For it is much about one to Preach to Auditors besot∣ed with Stupidity and Ignorance as it is to give Ex¦hortation unto Babes Therefore it is that our Church in her Assemblies hath so frequently and seriously pressed the Learning of Children to Read and the providing  o  Schools for that end Pastours to be diligent in that  itiating and necessary Work of Examination and  eaching Catechetick Doctrine and the Concurrence  arents with both in laying out themselves for the  struction of their Children as well by themselves by others Godly Ministers well knowing that the  ccess of Ordinances and Edification of their People  pendeth much thereupon  Isa    Jo    c  as the means which the  rd useth to bless for the bringing in of his Elect  nowledge being so necessary to the Being of Faith at the latter is sometimes expressed by the Name of  e former  And seeing they retain not God in their knowledge  is no wonder they be given over to a Reprobate find to do things which are not convenient  God's judgment upon the ignorant  No  onder they frequent their old Chappels for Super∣  tious Ends of which the corrupt and purblind Rea∣  n of Man hath been always very fond No wonder  t being in the dark without the Lanthorn of the  owledge of Scripture Revelation they mistake their  y and by the using of Charms and consulting of  armers they  run to Beelzebub in stead of having re∣  se to the God of Israel  Which Ignorance to be the  use of these Evils will appear the more evidently  we consider that in these Isles where there is a  eater measure of the knowledge of God there is not  th a following of these horrid and hellish Practices  There are several old Chappels in these Isles which  e People resort unto but that which I heard of as  ost famous is St  Tredwels Chappel  in  Papa Westra  Several old chappels through the Isles  ich they have such a Veneration for that they will  me from other Isles in considerable numbers to it  me of us having occassion to be on that Isle we saw  s Chappel situated on a small low Rock within a Loch  mmonly called St  Tredwels Loch  St  Tred∣wels  chap∣pel  to which we  ssed by steppingstones before this Chappel door there  s a heap of small stones into which the Supersti∣ous People when they come do cast a small stone or two  for their offering and some will cast in Money the Ch  ¦pel hath been but little and is now Ruinous only so  of the Walls are standing which the People are so  from suffering to be demolished that they labour  keep them up and tho the Proprietour of the grou  hath some way enclosed it yet this proves not effect  to prevent the frequenting thereof At the North E  side of the Loch nigh to the Chappel there is a  stone standing behind which there is another stone  ¦ing hollowed in the form of a Manger and nigh to  there is another high stone standing with a round  through it for what use these stones served  could not learn whether for binding the Horses  such to them as came to the Chappel and giving the  meat in the hollow stone or for tying the Sacrific  to as some say in times of Pagan Idolatry is uncert  St  Tre∣dwels  Loch held Medi∣cinal  This  S  t  Tredwel's Loch  nigh to the East end of whi  this Chappel is is held by the People as Medici  whereupon many diseased and infirm Persons resort to some saying that thereby they have got good A  certain Gentleman's Sister upon the Isle who was  able to go to this Loch without help yet return without it as likewise a Gentleman in the Country who was much distressed with sore Eyes went to the Loch and Washing there became sound and whole  he had been at much pains and expence to cure t  formerly With both which Persons he who was Mi¦nister of the place for many Years was well acquai  ¦ed and told us that he saw them both before and al  the Cure The present Minister of  Westra  told me t  such as are able to walk use to go so many times ab  the Loch as they think will perfect the Cure bef  they make any use of the Water and that without spe  ¦ing to any for they beleive that if they speak  will marr the Cure Also he told that on a cer  Morning not long since he went to this Loch  found six so making their circuit whom with s  difficulty he obliging to speak said to him they  me there for their Cure  How it cometh to pass that this Loch should ac∣complish the cure of any I leave to my Reader to judge  How the water of this Loch should ac∣complish the cure of any exa∣mined  whether it be by any Medicinal or healing Vertue in the Water which I incline not to think the Cure being  circumstantiated or if the force and strength of the  agination of the Persons afflicted may have any ten∣  ncy that way which some judge hath its own in∣  ence in some such like cases Or rather by the  d and assistance of Satan whom God in his Holy and  se Providence may permit so to do for the further  dicial blinding and hardning of these who follow  ch unwarrantable and unlawful courses God so punish∣  g them by giving them up to such strong delusions  et I hear that when they have done all that is us∣ual for them to do as going about the Loch washing their Bodies or any part thereof leaving something  the Loch as old Clouts and the like c It is but few in whom the effect of healing is produced As  r this Loch's appearing like Blood before any dis∣  ure befal the Royal Family as some do report we  uld find no ground to beleive any such thing  These Chappels the People frequent  These Chapels frequented also for Prayer and paying of Vowes  as for other  ds so for Prayer they placing a kind of Merit there∣  when performed in such places and this they ob∣serve more than private Retirements And if they be  nder any Sickness or in any danger as at Sea they  ill vow so to do And when they go to the Chappels  pay the Vows taken on they use to lay several  tones one above another according to the number  Vows which they made some of which heaps we  w in  St Tredwells Chappel  And none must go empty  anded but leave behind them something either a peice of Money or of Bread or a Stone which they judge will be sufficient  As at all times when occasion offers  Especially in the time of Lent  they observe these Superstitious Practices so especially during Lent  they will not neglect their Devotions in such places a  on  EasterSunday  several Boats will be seen going  them from other Isles And tho' their Ministers both privately and publickly have spoken to them yet they cannot get them to forbear and abandon these Custom  And the Minister of  SouthRo  alsha  told us that ma  of the People in that Isle especially such as live at the south end thereof nigh to the Kirk called our  Lady Kirk  whereof tho now the Walls only be standing without a Roof yet the very Stones thereof they re∣verence and are not far from adoring And so ten  ¦cious are they that when in rough weather he hath procured the conveniency of a Barn to Preach in ye  the People obliged him to come to this ruinous Fabrick else many of them would not have heard They an  now about the putting of a Roof on this Church which the Gentlemen of the Isle are not inclined to judging other places more commodious for it to be built in but Proposals of this nature do not relish with the People they being so superstitiously wedded to the place of i  present Situation Whereupon the Heads of Fam  e will rather by themselves contribute to the repairing of this Old Church than suffer a new one to be built in any other place of the Isle tho less to their cost  In this old Fabrick of our  Ladys Church  there is a Stone lying about foot long  Concern∣ing a one lying in  Our Ladys Church  and foot broad but narrower and round at the two ends upon the surface of which Stone there is the print of two feet con∣cerning which the Superstitious People have a Traditi∣on that  St Magnus  when he could not get a Boat on a time to carry him over  Pightland Firth  took this stone and setting his Feet thereupon passed the Firth safely and left the Stone in this Church which hath continued here ever since But as  I  think and some more judicious People do likewise suggest it hath been a Stone upon which under Popery the Delin∣quents stood bare footed suffering Penance It is like when thus  St Magnus  came over the Firth it hath been  that time when he was seen riding through  Aber∣  e    giving the first account of the defeat of the  English Bannockburn  and afterward was seen going over  Pight∣land Firth  And indeed both are alike destitute of any  adow of Truth credible only by these superstitious  d silly ones whom the GOD of this World hath  inded  Several of the Isles have their Saints Days which  me do superstitiously observe  Several of the Isles have their Saints Dayes  There is one day in  arvest on which the more ignorant especially in  uld  say if any work the Ridges will blood The  ark some call our  Ladys Hen  And some such Po∣  sh Dregs are to be found The Lord preserve this  and from Poperys Inundation for as it is credible  om what hath been said and some better acquainted  ith this Country did inform us That if Popery get  oting again from the fears of which in the good  ovidence of GOD we were lately delivered  n any  the Inhabitants of these Isles would readily embrace  and by retaining some of these old Popish Rites and  ustoms seem to be in a manner prepared for it  Next to glance at their Charms  Concern∣ing their Charms  which I shall breif∣  do and not give any Account how they perform  em left thereby I should seem to point out to any how  try the experiment of this Hellish Art and tremen∣  us Devilry which I think I do sufficiently guard  ainst not only by barely reciting there are such▪ but  by proper Precautions adduced in this Chapter  They have a Charm whereby they stop excessive  ooding in any whatever way they come by it  A Charm to stop ex∣cessive bleeding  whe∣  er by or without External Violen  ▪ The name of  e Patient being sent to the Charmer he saith over  me words which I heard upon which the Blood  tantly stoppeth tho the blooding Patient were at the  eatest distance from the Charmer Yea upon the say∣  g of these words the Blood will stop in the blooding throats of Oxen or Sheep to the astonishment of Spe∣  ators Which account we had from the Ministers of  e Country  Another for the Toothach  There is a Charm likewise they make use of for  Toothach whereof  I  had the following instance fr  an Honest Man worthy of Credit Some years ag  there was one who used this Charm for the ab  ¦ing the pain of one living in  Eda  tormented therewith and tho the Action then was at a distance the Cha  ¦er not being present with the Patient yet according the most exact calculation of the time when the Cha  er was performed by the Charmer there fell a livi  Worm out of the Patients Mouth when he was at Su  ¦per This my Informer knew to be a Truth  the Man from whose Mouth it fell is yet alive in t  Isle of  Sanda  Whether this Worm was generated the corrupted part and so fell out by the Devils mean at the using of the Charm or the Worm was brought by an evil Spirit  aliunde  to the mouth and thence  a  ¦ling down I shall not determine  Thei  Beasts and Boats sprinkled with fore∣spoken Water  Also when the Beasts as Oxen Sheep Horses  c  are Sick they sprinkle them with a Water made  by them which they call  Forespoken Water  wherewith likeways they sprinkle their Boats when they succee  and prosper not in their Fishing And especially o  HallowEven  they use to sein or sign their Boats an  put a Cross of Tar upon them which my Informer ha  often seen Their Houses also some use then to sein  They have a Charm also whereby they try if person be in a decay or not and if they will die thereof which they call Casting of the Heart  A Charm for any under a decay  Of this the Minister  Stronza  and  Eda  told us he had a very remarkable Passage in a Process yet standing in his Session Re¦cords  Several other Charms  Several other Charms also they have about thei  Marriage when Women in Travel when their Co  is calfing when Churning their Milk or when Brew∣ing Or when their Children are sick by taking the  to a Smith without premonishing him who hath ha  a Smith to his Father and a Smith to his GrandFather And of several such like Charms we had an accou  from the Ministers as likeways how these Charms  re performed but of these enough  Although these Charms sometimes yet not always they produce the desired Effects  These Charms not al∣wayes ef∣fectual  As in the instance staying of Blood one of the Charmers Wives fell  ce a Blooding which he by all his Art was not able stop Whereupon he is said thus to have expressed  self "  I  have stopped the Blooding of and yet I cannot do it to my Wife  That such admirable Effects upon the using of the  harms are produced by the Agency of Demons  Acts of Assem∣blies are standing against such As by the As∣semb  hink few if any will doubt God so permitting it  be in his Holy and Wise Providence for the fur∣ther punishment and judicial blinding of those who  low such unlawful courses and the Devil thereby engaging his Slaves more in his Service Yet not al∣wayes the effects desired and exspected do follow  at all may know the Devil is a chained one and can  nothing without the permission of a Soveraign God  o is Lord over all Our Assemblies sensible of the  eat Sin and Evil that is in using these Charms and  nsulting of Charmers have made several Acts both against the one and the other strictly inhibiting and dis∣charging all such Hellish Practices and requiring all  inisters diligently to see to the observance and Execu∣tion thereof  Evil Spirits also called Fairies are frequently seen in several of the Isles dancing and making merry  Fairies frequent∣ly seen  and sometimes seen in Armour Also I had the account of  e wild Sentiments of some of the People concerning  em but with such I shall not detain my Reader We  stning our Voyage to  Zetland  CHAP VI A Description of  Zetland  The Country in General  Described  The  Soil Product Manners  of the People  c  hinted at  Situation of  Zet∣land  ZETLAND  lyes to the N East from  Orkney  be¦twixt the and Degree of Latitude the  being about or Leagues betwixt the  Sta  Head  of  Sanda  the Northernmost point thereof and  Sw  ¦burghHead  the Southern most point of Land in  Zetland  over a very rolling and swelling Sea▪ wherein the constantly runs the strong Current of a Tide▪ which causing the Sea to rise with its swelling waves the whole passage betwixt  Orkney  and  Zetland  is but  one continued Roust or strong and impetuous Tide especially about the  Fair Isle  still such a great Sea goet  even in the greatest Calm that the Boats are like  sling the masts out of them and our Boatmaste  told us that frequently when he had been passing t  Fair Isle  in a dead Calm the Boat hath been so tosse by the swelling Sea that it would have taken in wa¦ter on every side And I have heard Mariners ofte  declare that there is more hazard in these Seas the  in going to the  Eastern  or  Western Indies  The  Fa  Isle  of which more afterward is reckoned to b  but Leagues from  Zetland  whereas it is about or Leagues from  Orkney  so that we shall consider it together with the Isles belonging to  Zet∣land  The Isles  Zetland  consisteth of moe Isles than  Orkney  whereof some are more others less considerable beside  many Holms serving for Pasturage  Mainland  The largest of  em is that which they call the  Mainland  Miles  ng from South or South and by West to North or  orth and by East as to breadth not all alike for  o in some places it be miles yet in other it scarce one Mile broad it being so intersected with  es Sounds or Lochs that it may be said to consist  a great number of Promontories or Branches of  and stretching themselves into the Sea  All this Country consisting of so many Isles goeth  nder one common Name called by some  Hethland  Original of the name  Zet∣land  others  Zetland  and also  Schetland  The Etymo∣  gy of which Names is very uncertain as was that of  Orkney  some assigning one Reason of the Name  nd others another at their pleasure That which  emeth most probable is that this Country is called  ethland  because it is very Mountainous and riseth  igh above the waters so a high land in Norse is called  Hoghland  It is called  Zeland  or  Zetland  because of the great Sea wherewith on all hands it is encompassed  Zee  being  Sea  in that Language And called  Schetland  The Forti∣fication  Schatt  or  Scat  in  Denmark  levyed  an  is a Tax with a witness or very great saith the modern account of  Denmark  because of a kind of Custom or Tribute called  Scat  which they payed to their Norvegian Masters when they were in Possession of this Country and the Tri∣bute or Custom imposed upon the Inhabitants of  Nor∣way  to this day is called  Scat  and tho  Zetland  be now annexed to the Crown of  Scotland  yet there is a cer∣tain Rent or due which the Gentlemen and some others here do pay Yearly to the King or his Stew∣ard which is still called  Scat  I say altho we cannot be positive in determining the reasons of the Name yet it seems to be of a  Norvegian  or  Danish  Original  Seeing I have already had under consideration  By whom it was first planted and posses∣sed  by whom  Orkney  was first Planted and Inhabited and how it hath been disposed of hitherto I judge it not very needful for me to add any more to that purpose concerning  Zetland  for it is more then probable that about the same time by the same Persons hath  Zet∣land  also been Inhabited seing there are many mo Pi  Houses remaining there and some of them as outward appearance in better case then are to found in  Orkney  and always our Historians in th  Descriptions of these Northern Isles of  Orkney  and  Z  ¦land  have reckoned them as under the Government the same Masters Therefore without further premise Preliminaries of this nature I come to consider the p  ¦sent state of the Country  The Coun∣try mossey and but thinly In∣habited  Altho the Country be large yet it is in many places thinly Inhabited and that for the most part upon Coasts and indeed otherwise it cannot well be there are few if any places in  Zetland  but they are wi  in two Miles of the Sea which they incline to do  nigh unto being more convenient for their Fish  and for the gooding of their Land which is ordina  by Seaware hence it would be incommodious them upon these accounts to be at any distance from Besides the Country is generally Mossey and Mounta  ¦ous all covered over with Heath yea the far gr  ¦est part thereof is as one great Moss or Quagmire m  up of Water and Earth blended together which k  of ground would require much Labour and Expe  to bring in either to be Grazing or CornLand i  all in many places they could get it done for fr  Scalloway  on the West side of the  Mainland  to  Le  on the East side thereof four Miles over land it is a continued tract of Moss and Moor so that the  not one House all that way till we come near u  Lerwick  whereas we would think that this peice ground should be better Inhabited then many oth  considering the great resort of Strangers in the Sum  time thereunto if Nature had not laid such incon¦veniences in the way which would prove so diffic  to overcome  The peo∣ple discreet and fashi∣onable  The People are generally Discreet and Civil no  Rustick and Clounish as would be expected in such place of the World which may be much owing  eir Converse and Commerce with Strangers who  pair to these Isles in the Summer Season with whom  e inhabitants do keep a constant Bartering or Trade  hich Trading as it makes them the better to live so  may tend not a little to the Cultivating of their Man∣  s They are also very Fashionable in their Clothes  d the Gentry want not their fine Stuffs such as  Hol∣  d Hamburgh  c do afford so that they are to be seen as good an Order and Dress as with us in the South  he Bowrs Fishers and other Country People also do  honestlike and decent in their Apparel as becometh  eir station  They also have always been in repute for  Hospitality  Hospi∣table  d indeed we have seen no other to contradict that which is spoken so much to their Commendation and  aise for at any time when we had occasion to visite  entlemen Merchants or others we were always by  em kindly Entertained And so much they are said  be given to this commendable peice of Humanity  at if they do purchase any thing from Foreign Mer∣  ants which they put any value upon such as Wheat∣  ead some strong Liquor c Even the Country people will not use it themselves but reserve it for the  tertainment of Strangers As for those old Inha∣  tants of the  Danish  Blood of whom it was said  That  were seeming Fair but really False and superlatively  oud  they are much worn out of this Country and  at any time Ships be driven ashore upon their Coasts  Inhabitants use very kindly and Humanely to treat  distressed Company of which Humane Treatment  Ship belonging to the Firth had a late experience  ing broke on the Coast there in  December  last as  e of the Ships Company informed me Such a kind  d generous Reception Merchants and Mariners meet  t with in many places upon which they are unhap∣  ily cast from whom better things would be expected  The body of the peo∣ple igno∣rant  to the matters of God and Religion the Body of  People are said to be very Ignorant by these who  know them better then we can be supposed to have ha  access to do considering the short time of our stay and abode among them Which may be imputed to thei  want of convenient Schools for the Instruction o  their Youth in many places of the Country Which also was assigned as the reason why  gnorance doth s  much prevail in the  Orkney Isles  Which great Evil  the Mother and Leader of many others all should la∣bour to redress as they are severall called and concern∣ed Authority also interposeing their Command and not denying their Countenance and Encouragement thereunto  Yet fre∣quent Gos∣pel ordi∣nances  Yet we must say that the People do frequent the dispensing of GospelOrdinances and seem to hear with some measure of Attention and Reverence and as ap∣peared to us not without some seriousness and con∣cern upon their Spirits which after hearing continued with some as we found by our Converse with them which encouraged us to set and keep up two Week days Sermons at  Lerwick  during our stay in the bounds which the People thronged unto thereby shewing great respect to the Ordinances dispensed by us S  that matters looked far otherwise then what was ex¦pected by our selves and many others before we cam  to this Country And indeed after conference upon this head all of us judged that if things were got pu  into a better order and some evils removed which forbear to mention knowing that they will come un¦der the cognizance and consideration of others wh  are in a capacity to redress them there might be Harvest through Grace  No latine school there  Altho there be a Latine School at  Kirkwal  in  Orkney  yet there is none in all this Country which cannot but be very prejudicial to the Inhabitants the Advance¦ment of the Education of their Youth being the eb  hindered many promising and pregnant Ingenys los  and Letters discouraged For Gentlemen are either obliged to keep their Children at home and so the  must want that peice of Learning which tends so much to Form and Folish their Mindes and to com∣pleat them as Gentlemen or else send them to other Countries where Education is to be had which many are averse to do not only because of the Charge and Expence they will be at but also of the fear they will be in in sending their Children over Sea and keeping them so long at such a distance from them As for Chaplains tho they could be had which would be with difficulty in this corner yet all Gentlemen who have Children to Educate cannot well bear the Charges of bringing them over from  Scotland  and keeping them with them for so long a time Whereupon the Mi∣nisters there are very desirous that the Government may be Addressed for Encouragment to SchoolMasters through the Country and particularly that a Latine School be set up either at  Lerwick  or  Stalloway  English  is the Common Language among them yet many of the People speak  Norse  or corrupt  Danish  Their Lan∣guage  especially such as live in the more Northern Isles yea so ordinary it is in some places that it is the first Lan∣guage their Children speak Several here also speak good  Dutch  even Servants though they never have been out of the Country because of the many  Dutch Ships  which do frequent their Ports And there are some who have something of all these three Languages  English Dutch  and  Norse  The Norse hath continued ever since the  Norvegians  had these Isles in Possession and in  Orkney  as hath been said it is not quite extinct tho there be by far more of it in  Zetland  which many do commonly use  It is observable that the Names of the Descendants of the old Inhabitants  Names  differ from the Names of others now numerous among them for these only have a Name without a Sirname save what is taken from their Fa∣thers Name and by adding Son or Daughter thereun∣to  Exemp Gra Agnes Magnus Daughter  her own Name is  Agnes  her Fathers is  Magnus  to which  Daugh∣ter  is added which is the whole Denomination or De¦signation under which such a Woman goes So  M  ¦rion Peters Daughter Laurence Johns Son  c Which they say is yet the  Danish  way of Expressing and Dis¦tinguishing Names And for further clearing if ther  be two Men or Women of the same Name they u  also to design them by the places where they ordin∣arily reside as  Agnes Magnus Daughter in Trebister  that so she may be discriminated from another Woman of the same Name living in another place It is pro∣bable that hence flowed these Sirnames such as  Wil∣liamson Robertson Jamieson Davidson  c which d  abound with us in  Scotland  In some words also their Pronunciation doth differ from that of ours as for In∣stance they often use to leave out the Letter H in the  Pronunciation as if it did not belong to the Word s  Three  they pronounce as  Tree Thou  as  Tou  or  Tu  c They have also some  Norish  words which they com∣monly use which we understood not till they were explained such as  Air  which signifies a Sand Bank  Oyse  an Inlet of the Sea  Voe  a Creek or Bay  c  And these words are much used both in  Zetland  and  Ork∣ney  The Coun∣try better inhabited then for∣merly  It would appear that the Country is now much bet∣ter Inhabited than formerly some ages agoe it hath been for we hear but of few who leave this Country having once fixed their abode therein tho there be ma∣ny who have lately come to it from  Orkney Caithness Sutherland Buchan  and other places especially in the North of  Scotland  So that in all  Lerwick  the most considerable Town in the Country there are but very few whose Grandfathers have lived in those Isles And in  Lerwick  it self about years agoe there were only Houses and some years before there were none at all tho now there are between two and three hundred Fa∣milies in it  People healthful and many live to a good age  Tho the ground be generally bad and the Climate cold yet it is not unwholesome living here as appears  from the many vigorous old People that abound in the  sles whose health I think is rather more firm and  ound then with us neither are they lyable to such fre∣  uent sickness whither this is to be imputed to the  eeness and purity of the Air or to the quality of their Diet or the Sobriety of their living or to all these and the like I shall not judge Yet they tell us they used  o live much longer in former Ages then now they do as of one  airvile  who lived years and all his time never drank Beer or Ale His Son also and GrandChildren lived to a good old Age who seldom or ne∣ver drank any other thing save Milk Water and their CountryBland It is said also that this  Tairvils  Father lived longer then himself There was also one  Laur∣entius  in the Parish of  Waes  whose Heir Oyes do yet live there who arrived at a great Age whom  Buch∣anan  mentioneth that he lived in his time marrying a Wife after the year of his Age and in the went a Fishing with his little Boat when the Sea was Tempestuous  Salubritatis firmitudo in Laurentio quo∣dam nostra atate apparuit qui post Centisimum annum uxo∣tum duxit centesimum quadragesimum annum agens  Buchan Hist L  savis∣simo mari in sua  naviculâ  piscatum prodibat Ac nuper nulla vi gravioris morbi labefactatus sed sento solutus decessit  For surely as all Skilful Physicians do grant there is nothing more Conducive to the maintaining of a Sound and Healthful Constitution then a sober and regular Diet whereas they who live otherwise to speak with respect to d Causes do impair their Health and cuts themselves off often in the midst of their days espe∣cially such as feed high and indulge themselves in drink∣ing strong Liquors which tends to the exhausting of that Natural and Innate Heat the Fountain of our Ani∣malLife whereas it is observed of all these who ar∣rived at such a great Age that they seldom if ever drank any strong Liquor  They ob∣noxious to the scurvy  There is no Sickness or Disease this Country i  more subject unto then the  Scurvey  as is  Orkney  like∣wise which is occasioned doubtless by their Saltmeats Fishes upon which many for the most part do live SeaAir c And sometimes this Scurvey degenerates into a kind of Leprosy which they call a  Bastard scurvey  and is discerned by hairs falling from the Eyebree  the Nose falling in c Which when the People come to know they separate and set them apart for fear of Infection building Huts or little Houses for them in the feild I saw the Ruines of one of these Houses about half a mile from  Lerwick  where a Woman was for some Years kept for this Reason This Bastard Lepro∣sy they judge is caused by the many grey Fishes such as Sillucks Piltocks c which they eat for Bread failing many of the People in the Summer time that often for or Months they will not taste thereof these Fishes are almost their only meat and especially the Livers of these Fishes which are thought to be more unhealthful then the Fishes themselves and they much incline to eat do occasion this The drinking also of hot Bland which is a kind of a Serum of Milk of which more afterwards together with these Fishes do beget such corrupt humours to the dis∣tempering of the Body These Scorbutick Persons are more ordinarily in  Dunrossness  and  Delton  and more rare in other places And that because they have mo Grey Fishes in these two Parishes then in others▪  And it hath been observed often by the Inhabitants that when in Holy Providence any Sickness cometh upon or breaketh up in the Country  When any sickness breaketh up in the Country it quickly spreads Small pox lately there  it useth to go through them like a Plague so that since we came of  the small Pox hath seised upon many both old and young and was so universal that upon one Lord's Day there were Prayed for in the Church of  Le  ∣wick  all sick of the same Disease whereas when we were there a few weeks before there was not one that we knew sick thereof They say a Gentleman  Son in the Countrey who had lately gone from the  uth and was under it when he came home brought with him which very quickly spread among the people the old as well as the young and so sad have  en the desolating effects thereof that one told me  ho arrived here lately from the place that he verily  dgeth the third part of the People in many of the  es are dead thereof  Altho many of the Inhabitants have each their par∣ticular Trades and Employments wherein more espe∣  ally they lay out themselves and are taken up about  Their Employ∣ment  et are they all generally some way acquainted with  e Sea and can with some dexteritie and skill attained  Experience manage their Boats not only because of  eir frequent passing from Isle to Isle and going over the  oes or Lochs which ly in upon and cut the Mainland  it by Reason of their great Fishing not only for their  n use but for the use of Merchants who buy their  ishes or give them the Value in foreign Commodi∣  es Hence most of the Inhabitants not only have some  asturage for their Cattel and some Corn Land about  eir Houses which they manure but also their parts  Boats for the end forsaid Yet there are many who  llow no Trade but their Fishing  Beside their FishTrade with foreign Merchants  They trade with  Ork∣ney  they  o likwise drive a great Trade with  Orkney  from which  very Year several Boats do pass to  Zetland  Loaden with Corns Meal Malt c upon the coming whereof they  ften wait for Barley seed tho the last Year they had Considerable Crop so that the Barley Seed was sown before the Boats came over The  Orkney  Men also bring sometimes Stockins Ale and the like which they know  be vendible here Hence every Year considerable  ums of Money go from  Zetland  to  Orkney  And some  ave told me that most of the Money they have in  Orkney  is from  Zetland  So great is the Advantage that these Isles do reap by their Neighbourly Commerce with one another for as  Zetland  could not well live  without  Orkne'ys Corns  so neither could  Orkney  b  well without  Zetlands Money  Their Money from for∣reign Mer∣chants  As  Orkney  have much of their Money from  Zetla  so  Zetland  have all theirs from foreign Nations Countreys whose Merchants traffick with them as f  Holland Hamburgh B  eme  c The Dutch Mo  doth Ordinarily pass among them as Stivers half S  ¦ers and since the Rates of the Money were raise  Scotland  many here have been considerable gainers the Ducketdouns which is the species of Money  the  Hollanders  bring more ordinarily with them  The Kings Rents  The Kings Rents are but the d part of what t  are in  Orkney  The Bishop had no Rents from this Countrey  For tho this Countrey be by far gre  and more spacious then  Orkney  yet it is not so well in bited neither is the ground so good These Rents payed to the Taxmen in Butter Oyl and Money T  Oyl is made of the livers of Fishes and is sent So for the making of Soap or is otherwise disposed of may be most Advantageous The Bishops had no Re  from this Countrey And tho it belong to the Dio  of  Orkney  and is a considerable part of that Charge we did not hear that ever any of these sole Pastour their Diocesses as some are pleased to call them visi  these bounds  Little Cornland here  There being so little CornLand here is the ca  why none of the Revenues of the Croun are payed Meal or Corns whereas in  Orkney  it is far otherwi  as hath been said for any CornLand they have is or¦dinarily but a few Ridges nigh to the Coasts for any distance from the Sea and in many places a  nigh unto it there is nothing but a Mossy and Mo  ¦tainous Desert covered with Heather and only so  places plenished with a few Kine Sheep or Shelt  tho in other places ye will go some Miles and see no  This Moss and Moor which so much aboundeth r  ¦ders Travelling very dangerous even to the Nati  themselves and so deep is it in many places and t  in the Summer and droughty season that Horses c  t pass it and Men on foot not without difficulty and  zard As in the Isle of  Yell  the Minister in going to the  hurch from his House is obliged to go on foot  iles almost wading up to the knees And indeed the  siest and safest way of Travelling is by Sea in Boats  out the skirts of the Isles which also is not without  nger  And tho the greatest part of this Countrey be thus  ossy and Moorish  Some pleasant Spots through the Coun∣trey  yet there are some pleasant Spots  it well furnished with Grass and Corn as nigh to  alloway Ʋstness  c in the  Mainland  some places in  e Parishes of  Dunrosness  also on the  Main  in the  fle  f Unst c Hence some Years they will have Fold  Increase but this is more rare for at other times in  veral places they will scarce have the double of their  ed They make much use of BarlyBread which  ppears to be fairer then their OatBread for their  rly they take to be the best Grain it agreeing bet∣  r with the ground then Oats And as it is in  Ork∣ney  so is it here if any white Corn be brought unto  e Countrey for seed it will soon degenerate and be∣  me like their oun  I think the Kine and Sheep are of a greater Size  Concern∣ing their cattel and harvest  en they are in  Orkney  tho their Horses be of a less  for the Sheep I take them to be little less then they  e in many places of  Scotland  they Lamb not so soon  s with us for at the end of  May  their Lambs are  ot come in Season their Harvest also is much latter  r they Judge it very early if they get their Corns in  gainst the Middle of October They observe that our  easons will be two months before theirs but I do  ot think they differ so much  If their Sheep were well kept  Their sheep  it would be very  easant to behold them in Flocks they being of di∣  ers colours some of a pyed others of a broun others  f a broun and white others of a black colour some  so have black spraings on their backs others on their  reheads and some say they have as great a number of  black Sheep as they have of white which diversity colours would render them very beautiful if they we  taken a due Care of for they neither wash nor c  their Sheep nor have they any shears for that end b  pulls the wooll off them with their hands which as is painful to the beasts so it makes them look not well favoured but like these with us whose w  is scratched with briars or thorns  Their or∣dinary drink  Their ordinary drink is Milk or Water or Milk a  Water together or a drink which they call  Bland  m  common in the Countrey tho not thought to be ve  wholesome which so they make up having take away the Butter from their churned Milk as likewi  the thicker parts of this Milk which remains after t  Butter is taken out they then pour in some hot W  ¦ter upon the Serum Whey or the thinner part of t  Milk in a proportion to the Milk Which being do  they make use of it for their drink keeping some f  their Winter provision And this drink is so ordina  with them that there are many People in the Cou  ¦trey who never saw Ale or Beer all their Lifetim  The Ale is rare among them they making bread much of their Barley grain but the Hamburgh Be  both small and strong is to be had in plenty tho at  good rate  sh  or  sh  our pint which Beer and oth  Liquors as also wheat Bread the  Hamburghers  bring wi  them in the Month of  May  for Sale hence sometim  Liquors as Beer Ale c cannot be had for money  the  Hamburghers  bring it  Victuals  earer then in  Orkney  The great confluence of strangers makes Kine Shee  Hens and almost all Victuals to sell at a greater rat  then in  Orkney  for often when the Bushes are her  they will give Double or Triple for a Sheep or a He  then it is to be bought in  Orkney  for for the  Holland  with their Bushes being Numerous on these Coast they send sometimes a shore to buy fresh meats whi  if to be had they will not want for the price  Fowls in plenty  They have Fowls especially SeaFowls in great ple  ¦  y  which do frequent the Rocks Holms c which they take as they do in  Orkney  and are very beneficial  o the Proprietours There are also many Eagles which do great prejudice and hurt to the Countrey for the Lambs they will lift up in their Claws and take whole to their Nests and falling doun upon the Sheep they fix one foot on the ground and the other on the Sheep's back which they having so apprehended they st pick but their eyes and then use the Carcases as they please All sorts of Duck and Drake Dunte Geese CleckGeese EmberGeese c they have as in  Orkney  They have many Crows but neither here nor in  Ork∣ney  are they of that Colour which they are of with us  Crowes  or their Head Wings and Tail only are black but their Back and Breast from the Neck to the Tail are of a Grey Colour and the Countrey People look upon it as a bad  Omen  when black Crows come to these Isles they portending that a Famine will shortly en∣sue  There are many Conies in some places but no Hares  Many rab∣bets no mair fowles or hares few rats no frogges or venomous creatures  neither are there any Moorfowls which are numerous in  Orkney  some say that a few from  Orkney  have been brought over for triall but they could not live here No Poddocks or Froggs are to be seen tho many in  Orkney  Neither are there any Rats to be found ex∣cept in some Isles and these are greater then ordinary and thought to come out of Ships when riding at An∣chor nigh to the shore but they have Mice in aboun∣dance Neither are there any venomous Creatures in these Isles They have many Ottars one of which was so tamed that it frequently used to bring Fishes out of the Sea to a Gentleman's House in  Haskashie  as one told me who knew the Truth thereof  They have a sort of little Horses called  Shelties  Concern∣ing their horses cal∣led shelties  then which no other are to be had if not brought hither from other places they are of a less Size then the  Ork∣ney  Horses for some will be but others Nives or Handbreadths high and they will be thought big Hor∣ses  there if eleven and although so small yet are they full of vigour and life and some not so high as others often prove to be the strongest yea there are some  whom an able Man can lift up in his arms yet will they carry him and a Woman behind him Miles for∣ward and as many back Summer or Winter they never come into an House but run upon the Mountains in some places in flocks and if at any time in Winter the storm be so great that they are straitned for food they will come doun from the Hills when the Ebb is in the Sea and eat the Seaware as likewise do the Sheep which Winter storme and scarcity of fodder puts them out of Case and bringeth them so very low that they recover not their strength till about St Joh'ns MassDay the th of June when they are at their best They will live till a Considerable Age as or Years and they will be good riding Horses in especially they'le be the more vigorous and live the longer if they be Years old before they be put to Work These of a black Colour are Judged to be the most durable and the pyeds often prove not so good they have been more numerous then now they are the best of them are to be had in  Sanston  and  Eston  also they are good in  Waes  and  Yell  these of the least Size are in the Northern Isles of  Yell  and  Ʋnst  The Coldness of the Air the Barrenness of the Mountains on which they feed and their hard usage may occasion them to keep so little for if bigger Hor∣ses be brought into the Countrey their kind within a little time will degenerate And indeed in the present case we may see the Wisdome of Providence for their way being deep and Mossie in Many places these ligh∣ter Horses come through when the greater and heavier would sink doun and they leap over ditches very nimbly yea up and doun rugged Mossy braes or hil∣locks with heavy riders upon them which I could not look upon but with Admiration yea I have seen them climb up braes upon their knees when otherwise they  could not get the height overcome so that our Horses would be but little if at all servicable there  The great Fishing which they have upon the Coasts  Their fishes nu∣merous  makes the place desirable to the Natives and to be fre∣quented by strangers it excelling any other place of the  King  of  Brittan's Dominions  for Herring White and Grey Fishing the White Fishing they call the Killin and Ling c their Grey the Silluks and seths there are also somtimes very strange Fishes here to be found As about Years ago there came a great number of small thick Fishes into a Voe on the South side of  Ne∣ston  they were of a Golden Colour very pleasant to behold they were about the bigness of an ordinary Trout and all of an equal Size they being very nume∣rous the Countrey made much use of them who Judged them very savoury tasting Like a Turhot And never before or since that time were these Fishes seen in these seas As my Informer an old Gentleman could remem∣ber Their Tusk is a rare Fish but more ordinary with them of which more when we come to speak of their Fishing Also many rare Shells are to be found on the Coasts but we had not time to enquire and look after them  Through the Isles for fewel they have good Pites in aboundance tho  Fewel  in some places they are at a distance from them as these who live in the  Skerries  are obliged to bring them from other Isles as from  Whalsey  and the passage being dangerous many boats are cast away with them some also living in  Dunrossness  are at a loss this way they not having the Moss at hand as gene∣rally they have in other places on the  Main  Much broken Timber also is driven ashore upon these Isles so that the Inhabitants of the  Skerries  trust the one half of their provision to this driven timber and broken Ships in great quantity often cast ashore partly through the many Ships that spleet on these Isles and partly as the wrack of Ships cast away at some distance which is  brought here by the Ebb from  Norway  or other place lying to the East of  Zetland  No trees  There are no trees in this Countrey more then  Orkney  we saw some old white and weather bear  Stocks standing in  Scalloway  for whatever Reasons ma  be alledged for trees not growing in  Orkney  far more  I Judge they will hold in  Zetland  both with Respect  the Air and to the Soil There are also at  Scatroway  son  Goose and Rizzerberrie bushes which use every Yea  to be laden with fruit which are a great rarity in the place of the World  Many ex∣celent herbs Scurvey grass in aboun∣dance  Many excellent Herbs are found growing here th  little knoun or made use of A Certain English Physi∣cian and skilled Botanist who was at  Lerwick  some Year  ago told our Host that there were many choice an ra  e Herbs here not to be found in  England  They have much scurveyGrass God so ordering it in his wi  Providence that  Juxta venenum nascitur Antidotum  that seeing the scurvy is the common Disease of the Coun∣trey they should have the Remedy at hand  Much LimeStone  There is here much Limestone tho for ought heard not to be found in  Orkney  which in some place they have but lately come to the knowledge of as i  Unst but about Years since and in other places they know not yet how to use it The Parish of  T  ngw  they say consists almost of Limestone they having few if any other stones then such  Stones for building broad  The Stones wherewith they build are generally broad and like Flagstones by reason of which figure and shape the stones lying the more easily the builder  are at less trouble in fitting them for the wall and have observed that in some Houses there is little Lime clay or any such thing for cementing of the building which renders their dwelling so much the colder the peircing Air passing through between the Chinks of the Stones which they have no need of under this cold and airish Climate But some of these Houses they ma  designedly so build that the Wind may have free pas∣sage  through them for drying of their Fishes which  ouses some ca  l  keas  There are several superstitious Customs and Practi∣  s which the more ignorant People follow  Several Supersti∣tion Cu∣stoms  some of which we will have occasion to note in the sequel of  is Discourse but not so many did we hear of as there  e in  Orkney  But I hope the vigilance and Diligence  our Church in inspecting these Isles and putting all  their Duty will prove a blessed Mean in the hand  God for the eradicating and utter abolishing of these  elicts of Paganism and Idolatry  Sailing about these Coasts is often very dangerous  Sailing dangerous  hence the Waters prove Graves to many of the Inha∣  tants While we were there in the Month of  May  a  at was cast away going by the shore to  Dunressness  d a Man and his Sister therein perished and another  an in her was saved by getting upon the keel of the  at and sometimes Boats are cast away when not one  ved About the Isles are many blind Rocks which the  atives sometimes unhappily fall and break upon ei∣their through a Mistake or the Tide and Wind driv∣ing them upon them At other times the Wind rising  seth the Sea so to swell that the Waves breaking upon  eir small Boats are ready to overset them and some∣times do Also tho the Wind be not so strong there will  me Flanns and Blasts off the Land as to their swift∣  ess and surprisal something like to Hurricanes which  ting with a great Impetus or force upon their Sails  verturns the Boat and in a moment hurries them into  ternity By such a flan the  La  d of Muna  a Gentle∣man in this Countrey is said to have perished the for∣ther Year when within sight of his ou  House  nd all that were in the Boat with him said to be  Persons save one servant who escaped upon the  eel I remember that night we came to the Land of  Zetland  our Seamen thought fit in their prudence not to Sail too nigh the Land for fear of such flans O  to be as Watchmen on our Towers looking out a waiting for the Lord's coming  Little Com∣merce in the Win∣ter  For this cause it is that during the Winter Sea  they have ordinarily Converse or Commerce wi  none except that Ships be driven in by stress of W  ¦ther for the open Boats dare not come and the clo  decked not without danger the Sea commonly at the time being so tempestuous the Tides and Rousts rapid that they threaten all who come near them w  being swallowed up Therefore it is as they tell u  that from  October  till  April  or  May  they Ordinar  see no strangers nor know any News which makes t  Winter so much the longer and wearisome unto them An Instance whereof we had that the late Revolution  when his Highness the Prince of Orange our present King  was pleased to come over to assert our Liberties a  deliver us from our fears falling out in the Winter it was  May  thereafter before they heard any thing of  And that st they say from a FisherMan whom some would have had arraigned before them and impeach  of high Treason because of his News as some did  form us  They sometimes infested by Pirates  Their Countrey lying very open and in many p  ¦ces but thinly Inhabited exposeth them to the Host incursions of Pirates in a time of War as of late the  Frenches  did much infest their Coasts some of their M  Landing did by shot Kill their Kine and Sheep and take them away with them yea sometimes they spare not the Churches but sacrilegiously robbed them pu  ¦ling doun the Timber thereof as Seats c and taking them for burnwood so they did to a Church in  Nor  Mevan  But they never came into  Brassa Sound  le  they had been locked up within Land Winds turning contrary  Some light all the Night over in  June  In the Month of  June  they have a clear light all t  Night over for at the darkest hour thereof you w  see clearly to read a Letter the Sun setteth between and at Night and riseth between and  e Morning but for this they have so much the shor∣  r Day and longer Night in the Winter  CHAP VII A particular Vien is given of the several Pa∣rishes and most considerable Isles in  Zet∣land  THus far having Considered the state of the Coun∣trey in General  A brief Descrip∣tion of the several Parishes with the Isles there∣unto be∣longing  we come next to take some par∣  cular view of the Isles which that I may the better and  ore methodically do I shall lay before my Reader  e several Parishes with some brief description of the principal Isles therunto belonging For as to the Num∣  er of the Isles  I  never heard an Exact account given  ereof there being many of them small wherein is  ly a Family or two and so but little noticed  The st  Parish of  Dunross∣ness  is the Parish of  Dunrossness  on the  Mainland  to the South and is the Parish which lyes next to  O  k∣  ey  and  Scotland  wherein are Churches in which  eir Minister performeth divine service  CrossKirk  nwich  and  Fair Isle  In this Parish are several very  ood Voes or Harbours commodious for Ships to ride  In this there is also much CornLand ther ground  aring the Richest Grain in many places not so Mossy  d covered over with Heath as other Parishes are  hich makes them to have less fewel tho more corn Much of the Land here is sanded and the Sea almost early gaineth something on the lower parts thereof  e Land lying so low and sandy in many places is  onvenient for Conics which abound here about the  e  s or southern most point of Land In this Parish there is a great Fishing This southermost point hath two Heads  Swinburgh Head  and  Fitwalls Head  Swinburgh and Fit∣walsHead  two high  ocks seen by Mariners coming from the South at a great distance which when discovered they direct their Course towards them  St Ni∣nians Isle  To the NorthWest of the Ness lyes  St Ninians Isl  very pleasant wherin there is a Chappel and ane Alt  in it where on some superstitious People do burn Can  ¦les to this Day Some take this Isle rather to be a ki  of Peninsula joyned to the Main by a Bank of San  by which in an Ebb People may go into the Isle t  sometimes not without danger  The Fair Isle  The  Fair  Isle belongeth to this Parish lying Leagues or Miles to the South or South and by E  of  Swinburgh Head  by  Burhannan  it is called  Insu  a  b  the pleasant or pretty Isle Tho I do Judge  FAIR  m  be as well taken  roperly as Appellatively for the  Faira or Fara there being another Isle lying to t  North of this which they call  North Faira  which rela  to another  Faira by South  now there is no  sle lying the South of this  North Faira  which hath any nat  that can be interpreted  Faira  but this Fair Isle Mo  over I neither did see nor was I informed of any thin  that afford us any Reason why this Isle should be appellatively taken and denominated  bella  or  Fa  This  Fair Isle  riseth high above the Waters and is se  by Mariners at a great distance it i  about an Mile a  a half long from south to North and nigh to a M  in breadth the side thereof towards the West is a co  ¦tinued ragged rock from one end to another alwa  beat upon by the Impetuous currents of a swelling Se  above this Westside is the Craig which they call t  SheepCraig  whereon there are no Houses nor Co  Land but Sheep use to feed The side lying to t  East is lower declining towards the Sea There are it two Harbours one upon the NorthernEnd looki  to  Zetland  and another towards the Southern poi  but Ships or Boats do not ordinarily resort thereunt  if not put to it  Inh  bi∣tants and some CornLand and Pa∣sture in  Fair Isle  and better cannot do for so it ha  been a safe shelter and refuge to many  There use to be about or Families in it b  now they say Death hath almost depopulate the Isl  the small Pox having lately raged there and swe  away two thirds of the Inhabitants so that there is not  sufficient number spared to Manage their FishBoats that Gentlemans Son abovementioned having tou∣  hed here in his way to  Zetland  They have good Pa∣  turage for Sheep and Kine and some CornLand and  e very hospital and kind Their Minister useth to  isite them once in the Year in the Summer time and  aving with them about a Month Preaching Baptiz∣  ng their Children and doing other parts of his  a∣storal Work after which he returning to  Zetland  they  re without publick Ordinances till the next Years Revolution  The Hawks they say  Good Hawks there  which are to be had in the  Fair Isle  are the best in  Britain  which use to flee to  Zet∣land  or  Orkney  for their prey these being the nearest Lands and sometimes they'le find Moor Fowls in their Nests which they behoved to bring from  Ork∣  ey  seeing there are none in  Zetland  and the nearest Isle they could have them in was  Stronza  or  Westra  which is between and Miles of Sea over which at one flight they must carry these Fowls to their Nests  Many Ships use to cruise about this  Fair Isle  in the Summer time  Ships use cru  se there∣about  and by it the  Holland's  Fleet going to or coming from the EastIndies use to pass tho some∣times as in the late Wars they Sailed by the North of  Zetland  that they might be more free of danger Ships also going to or coming from  Norway  or the East Sea frequently pass this way when Wind serveth them so to do and this Fair Isle being seen by them at or leagues distance in a clear Day it is as a Myth or Mark for directing their courses  The d  Parish of  Tingwal  is the Parish of  Tingwall  lying on the East of the  Main  to the North of  Dunrossness  wherein are Churches  Tingwall Whiteness Wisedale  and  Lerwick  but the Minister useth not to Preach by turns at  Lerwick  as he doth at his other Churches he not finding himself obliged so to do it being but built  lately at the expence of the Inhabitants however som  ∣times he hath Sermon there and Baptizeth the Children  Lerwick  in this Parish is now become t  Principal Toun in the Countrey lying on the East  the main at  Brassa Sound  over against the Isle  Brasse  Town of  Lerwick  Lerwick  is more then half a Mile in length lyin  South and North upon the side of the Sound and w  consist of between and Families it is but withi  these few Years that it hath arrived to such a numbe  of Houses and Inhabitants It is become so consider¦able because of the many Ships which do Yearly fre¦quent the Sound whereby Merchants and TradesMe  are encouraged to come and dwell in this place an  not for the pleasantness of its Situation or the fertilit  of the Countrey about for it is built upon a Rock  peice of Ground wherein they can have no street bu  a kind of a narrow passage before their doors betwix  them and the Sound which in some places will not ad¦mit of two Mens going in a breast and at the back o  the Toun there is a Hill of black Moss wherein they cast their Pites which in some places cometh to their very doors and no CornLand is there about it save a little within the Castle for near a Mile of way  Many of their Houses are very Commodious to dwell in most of them being two stories high and well furnished within their Inhabitants consist of Merchants TradesMen and Fishers who keep up a good Trade with Foreigners from whom they buy much of their domestick provision some of them are Persons of a Considerable Stock which they have many ways to improve for their advantage They are very Civil and kind of an obliging temper which we had the Experience of during our abode among them there are but few begging poor to be seen here or in any place of the Countrey where we had occasion to be there being a great store of small Fishes for the supply of their necessity  They have upon their own Charges Built a conve∣nient Church at the back of the middle of the Town  A Church built in  Lerwick  but no Mi∣nistr settl∣ed there  nd furnished it with good Seats high and low they  re at present a part of the Parish of  Tingwal  but very  esireous to be disjoined and erected into a Parish by themselves that so they may enjoy a Minister of their own For the promoting of which good Work they are most willing according to their Ability to Contri∣  ute for the settling of a Fond for a Stipend to a Mi∣nister but not being in a Capacity to give all they  esolved to make Application to the Government for to have some Allowance out of the Revenues of the Bishoprick of  Orkney  or otherwise as the Wisdom of the Government should see meet that so there may be a Competency made up  Upon their application to us  Fit this Town be Erected into a Pa∣rish  we judgeing it most convenient yea necessary that this Town with some of the adjacent Countrey should be Erected in∣to a Paroch cherished this their pious design Telling them that we intended to recommend it to the Commission of the General Assembly That they may interpose with the Lords and other Honour∣able Members of the respective Judicatories before whom this affair shall come for the better effectuat∣ing the same For the Town it self is considerable and the principal one in the Countrey much fre∣quented by the Gentry As also by Strangers in the Summer time And their Minister Preaching seldom here they are ordinarly destitute of GospelOrdi∣nances The People scarce being able in the Sum∣mer season and all most impossible for them in the Winter to travel to the next Church where their Minister Preacheth It being about Miles distance from them of exceeding bad way As we knew when we did perambulate the bounds Which want of Ordinances maketh their Case very sad and deplo∣rable It nurseth ignorance Occasioneth much Sin especially horrid prophanation of the LordsDay by  strangers as well as by inhabitants And doth effect  ¦ally obstruct the conversion of Souls Preaching of t  Word being a special mean of convincing and co  ¦verting Sinners and building them up in Holine  and comfort through Faith unto Salvation  Citidale of  Lerwick  At the North end of the Town is the  Castle  or  Ci  ¦del  of  Lerwick  begun to be built in the time of t  Dutch War  Anno By Workmen sent by  Autho  from Scotland  for that end but the Work was new perfected the Work men returning home Anno that time also Souldiers were sent over fort  Defence of the Countrey against the hostile Incu  ¦ons of the  Hollanders  and were quartered in pla  nigh to the Fort who likewise returned home a  out the same time with the Wo  kmen The Gar  ¦son could do much to command the Sound for th  there was no Town here so that none durst La  nigh unto them The walls are yet in a good con  ¦tion high in some places without but filled up wi  Earth within whereon they raised their Cannon the weakest part of the Wall towards the North the hath been a Sallyport dangerous to Attack by reas  of a deep Ditch before it fed by a Spring into whi  the Garison by cunning Artifices might endeavour draw the Enemy who by the Stratagems of War th  being brought on and ensnared did incontinent sink down into the Sound below them at the foot the Hill whereupon the Castle is situated With the Walls is a House of Guard which hath been t  Stories high burnt by the  Dutch  after that o  Souldiers had left the Fort Upon the Walls towar  the Sound are standing Iron Cannons one a an  ¦ther a and a d a Pounder not left by the  who kept Garrison but since that time within the Years taken out of the Sea nigh to  Wnalsey  a Sh  of Force there being cast away about Years be¦fore Which Guns the Inhabitants of  Lerwick  late mounted upon the Walls of the Castle whereby the  might be in a Capacity to Defend themselves against the  th  Privateers who at any time should come up the  nd and Assault them  Between  Lerwick  and the Isle of  Brass  on the East with a pleasant Bay or Sound  BrassaSound  commonly called  Brassa Sound  Famous for  s being so safe a Road for Ships Anchor and Ride in and that in the greatest Storm  ng enclosed with Land on every side except the  try thereunto from the South which is half a Mile  ad but within the Sound as at  Lerwick  its a Mile hath another narrow passage at the North end of  but dangerous to go out or in at because of some  nd Rocks therein This Sound is the ordinary place which the  Holland  Bushes do resort in time of  ring Fishing who before they put out their Nets which must not be according to a Law they have among themselves before the th  June  use to come  re and put themselves Ships and Nets in order  d the time by them appointed being come they all  to Sea together Fishing near to this Land Some∣  es there have been seen in the Sound or  d at once and every Year some Hundreds as Yea sometimes so thick do the Ships  y in  Sound that they say Men might go from one side  the Sound to the other stepping from Ship to Ship  d during their Fishing they will come in to the  nd for fresh Water or other necessary Provision and return to Sea again  To this Parish of  Tingwal  also belongeth  Scalloway  Scalloway  ng on the West side of the  Mainland  Miles which is the breadth of the Country in that place  m  Lerwick  It was formerly the cheif Town in the country and the Seat of the Presbytry enjoying by  r a pleas  nter situation then  Lerwick  about which is good Grass and Corn and some Meadow betwixt which and the Church of  Tingwal  is the  Strath  of  Ting∣wal  two Miles of hard even and pleasant way They  y about  Scalloway  is as pleasant a spot as is in all this  Country In all the Town there will be scarce  or Persons there not being such Encourageme  by Trade to live here as at  Lerwick  At the East or South East end of the Town stan  the  Castle of Scalloway  built An  Castle of  Scalloway  By  Patrick E  of Orkney Son to Robert Stewart also Earl of Orkney  w  built the  Palace  of  B  sa  formerly mentioned Abo  the Gates as we enter into the House there is this I  ¦scription  Patricius Orcha  ia Zetlandiae Comes  a  below the Inscription this Distich  Cujus fundamen sax  est domus illa manebit Lab  is e contra si sit arena pe  That House wh  se Foundation is on a Rock shall stan  But if on the Sand it shall fall The reason of the I  ¦scription is reported to be this The Earl great Oppressed both  Orkney  and  Zetland  and particular at the building of this House his hand lay very hea  on the poor People by causing them in great numbe  to be imployed about the Building which could not b  divert them from their ordinary Work as Fishing  whereby they provided Sustinance for themselves Families After this one Mr  Pitcawn Minister NorthMevan  said to be a Godly and Zealous Ma  coming to pay his Respects to the Earl the Earl d  ¦sired him to Compose a Verse which he might p  upon the Frontis peice of his House from this the M  ¦nister took occasion to lay before the Earl his great S  of Oppression upon which the Earls anger was ince  ¦sed and in his Rage he threatned him with Impriso  ¦ment However the Earl afterwards coming to so  Composure of Spirit Mr  Pitcawn  said unto hi  well if you will have a Verse I shall give you o  from express words of Holy Scripture  Luke  whi  Verse the Earl being pleased with caused Inscribe on the Lintle above the Gate with  Luke  added the Verse The Minister thereby insinuating that t  House could not stand long having such a San  Foundation as Oppression As indeed neither did it  shortly after the Earl being Beheaded the House was  t taken care of and is now become ruinous  And herein the Wise Providence of God may be ob∣  rved  Observe thereupon  that as the Inscription on the Gate of the  ace  of  Birsa  in  Orkn  y  did hold forth the Ambition of  e Father so this Inscription on the Gate of the  e of  Scalloway  in  Zetland  did shew the Oppression of  Son and tho it be many Years since the death of  m both yet the very Houses built by them to take their Honour and Grandour to appear do yet and to their Dishonour and Infamy and in a manner  bear Witness against them So truly verified in  em is that Scripture  Psal    Psal    Pro    That tho the inward thoughts of  a  be that their houses shall continue for ever and  r dwelling places to all generations Nevertheless they  to in honour and not understandin  are like the beasts  at p  ish And the Right  ous shall be in everlasting  memberance But the Name of the wicked shall rot  This House or Castle is Stories high beside Kitch∣  nes and Wa  drobe  A Descrip∣tion there∣of  and hath in it many excellent Cham∣  ers and other Apartments with their several Conve∣  iences Also there hath been much good painting  ome of which is yet to be seen tho much defaced  e Chambers are high between floors but especially  e Gallery or Dining Room In the Kitchin there  a Well in the side of the Wall the water whereof is  ery good tho little used The Sclaits have for the  ost part fallen from the Roof and are daily falling  ith every Storm so that the Timber much of which  yet very good and fresh is beginning to rot and con∣  me by the rain falling through the house from  oor to floor The stone Walls are yet in a good Condition they being considerable thick In the build∣  g are many freestones as Lintels Jams c which  hey say were brought from  Scotland  I give a more  articular account of this House because Built in this Country and to shew how Transient Passing and Perishing the Glory and Riches of the World are In  this  Castle of Scalloway  some  English  Souldiers for so  time kept Garrison when their Army was in  S  ¦land  The Church of  Wisdale  which belongeth to t  Parish is much frequented by the Superstitious Coun  People  Church of  Wisdale  who light Candles therein drop Money in a  about it go on their bare knees round it and to wh  in their Straits and Sickness they have their Rec  u  yea some are so silly as to think that if they be in a distress tho not at this Church yet if they turn t  faces to it God will hear them One of the Justi  told us that tho they have laid out themselves to  these Superstitious Conceits Eradicated yet they c  ¦not get it altogether effectuated but still they contin  among the People A Minister also told me that was much frequented by Women who when th  desire to Marry went to this Church making th  Vowes and saying their Prayers there so assuri  themselves that God would cause Men come in  of them But this is not now so much in use as fo  ¦merly  Isle of  Trouar  Before  Scalloway  lyeth a little Isle called  Trou  two or three Miles long wherein are a few F  ¦milies  Parish of  Neston  The third Parish is  Neston  to the East of the  Main

of the Men as they report were saved but who  ere on the Top mast discovering the Land But  fore they could give timeous advertisement to the Captain the Ship struck on a Rock and the Mast  reaking by

Isles  yet the greatest part  the Isles the Principal whereof are  Unst Yell Fetlor  ssa  and  Burra  Whence we see there is no Minister here but hath  least Churches  Ministers exposed to much

ngerous to the Respective Ministers they also not  ving little Manses or Houses for their Accomodation  en they come to many of them tho often when  rms do arise they will be detained in the Isles for

done to have Ministers constantly to  ach in the several Chuches even in the most consi∣  able Isles yet there might be some moe Ministers  here than there are or at least to whom the Tith  if rightly

Isles of  Zetland  THE Works of Creation and Providence are all  ¦ry wonderful  Observ∣able things in  Zetland  sought out of them who have pl  ¦sure therein among which some more ordinarly oc  and are the subject of our meditation and others no  commonly presenting themselves are the more surprisi  and amusing both which are to be had a due rega  unto they being either mediatly or immediatly by without d Causes the Work of the Lord and Operation of his Hands And seing there are s  things that deserve their own observation which eit  I had occasion to see or to hear of in  Zetland  I  give a brief Relation thereof not denying but t  there may be other things no less if not more observa  there which we came not to the knowledge of  The Picts Houses which are frequent through this  ountrey  Concern∣ing the Picts Hou∣ses  the Inhabitants take much notice of as be∣  g the Ancientest Monuments they have some of which  e more others less ruinous they are round in the  m of some Dovecoats or something like un∣  an Egg bulging out in the middle but narrower at  e bottom and yet more narrow at the top They  ave a little door for an entry at which a man of an  rdinary stature could not enter without bowing with∣  which door there is a Stair going up between two  one Walls leading to the several Apartments instead  Windows they have Slits or long narrow Holes in  e Wall such as are in many of our old Castles for the  onveyance of light unto them they are strongly built  t the conveniency for dwelling hath been but little  or their Diameter is but about or Foot and their  eight scarce or I think these Picts Houses are much like  Arthurs Oven  upon the Water of  Carron  in  rlingShire  These have been the Domiciles or Dwellings of the  icts  Observe thereupon  the old if not the first Inhabitants of this Coun∣  ey who were very numerous in the  North of Scotland  ed in  Orkney  having their own Kings as hath been  id in our  Description of Orkney  They are convenient∣  y situated through the Isles each one being within the  ight of another hence in a few hours advertisement could  e given by Fire or other signs they might condescend upon through the whole Countrey signifying unto them any danger that being thereby alarmed they might meet together or be upon their own defence These Houses are also called  Burgh    which in the old T  utonick or Saxon Language  Rich Ver∣stegan in his Anti∣quities of the English Nation and their Saxon Kings  signifyeth a Town having a Wall or some kind of an Enclosure about it as also a Castle for as one observeth in his  Dictionary or Explanation of our most ancient English words All places that in old time had among our Ancestours the name of Bur∣rough Bury or Burug were places one way or other fenced and fortifyed  Whence it appears that these Houses  have been Castles or places of Defence to the Pic  Seing it is generally acknowledged that both the Pic  and the Saxons were originally descended of the sa  German Nation  and so might call their Castles by t  same name I have also heard it observed That in  Orkn  several places wherein they used of old to bury th  Dead were called Burghs so likewise these Houses  Zetland  might serve for the same purpose from the Sax  Word  Byring or Buriging or Borogeing  which we n  call  Burying  No place called  Thule  here  I enquired if there was any Place or Hill here whi  they called  Thule  or  Ʋle  if so be we could receive a  Information or Light from them concerning the  Th  of the Ancients  but they answered they knew none  that name only there was an Isle wherein a high  called  Foula  on the west side of the Mainland but suppose that ever the  Ancient Romans  understood  Th  thereby beside other things that might be alledged  would be a manifest streatching of and an offering vi  ¦lence to the word But altho what this place is ha  been much controverted by Ancient and Modern A  ¦thors attempting the Discovery thereof yet it is gen  ¦rally agreed upon that it is toward the North a  many take it to be one of the British Isles and a late A  ¦thor in an  Essay concerning the Thule of the Ancients  e  ¦deavoureth to prove it to be the  North East part of Br  ¦tain  Conr Cel Itinere  aith  lying over against the Isles of  Orkney  citing som  Authors to this purpose as  Conradus Celtes Orc  ¦dibus qua cincta suis Tyle Glacialis Insula Clau¦dian Maduerunt sanguine fuso Orcades incalu  ictorum sanguine Thule Scotorum cumulos flev  glacialis lerne  And others who call  Thule Britann carum Insularum septentriona  ssimam  the most Norther  of the British Isles  Island  also lays claim to it and t  above cited Author supposeth  Island  to be the  Thule  b  I judge without any shaddow of Truth for beside wh  is now said  Rich Ver∣stegan  I  greatly doubt if ever the  Romans  had th  knowledge of  Island  their Eagles never having com  and been displayed to the North of  Scotland  or  Orkney  peru fuerat Romani Scotia limes  Saith the great  Sca∣  er Ptolomey  will have it to be among the Isles of  tland  and  Boeth  our Historian distinguisheth be∣  ween a st and a d  Thule  calling  Ila  the st and  Leuisa  e d

having it for our Zenith or Vertical Point we would have a continual Day without any Night for several Moneths the Sun all that time de∣  cribing a Circle almost parallel to our Horizon I say  lmost parallel because beside the Diurnal there is al∣  o the Annual Motion of the Sun in the Eclyptick O now exact and beautiful an order and symmetrie is to  be seen in the Works of God they all speaking for the goodness Wisdom and Power of their Maker  What a wonderful Creature is the Sun  Coming fo  as a Bridegroom out of his Chamber  A Refle∣ction thereupon  and rejoiceing as a str  Man to run his Race  absolving every day his circ  round our Terrestrial Globe from East to West a  travelling every year between his Tropicks the Lim  and Boundaries prescribed him of God beyond whi  he is not to pass from South to North and from No  to South giving shorter days to those who inhab  the midle of the Earth under the Torrid Zone  th  not being able to bear his longer continuance abo  their Horizon because of his scorching heat  longer to these who can better endure it under  temperate and yet longest to these who live near to the Frigid Zones or to the Poles whom his h  cannot prejudge as it doth these who live under or n  to the Line or midle of the Earth on whom he da¦eth down his Perpendicular Rays wherefore the W  ¦dom of his Maker will have him to stay a shorter th  above their Horizon  How wonderful then in Cou  and excellent in working is this God whereupon not only Saints do bless him for the benefites wherewith they are lo  ¦en but all his Works do praise him after their manner  Caves  There are several Caves here or hollow places in a  through the Rocks particularly there is one in the  of  Ʋnst  entering from the Sea at one side of the I  and opposite thereunto on the other side there is a  ¦ther going in as it were meeting the former unto  end of any of which none will undertake to goe t  it hath been attempted the rage of the Sea in th  Caverns of the Earth the failing of the Light of D  and the raggedness of the Rocks by which they m  pass making it terrible unto them as also the thick  of the Air something annoying them but the Ent  thereunto being opposite one to another giveth grou  to judge that it is an continued cave from the one s  of the Isle to the other tho Miles broad which c  t be thought to be artificial but natural washen  rough by the violence of the Waves and the less  onder it is for it so to be if we consider that if  lla cavat lapidem  much more  rapidi tumidi fluctus  abunt  that if in a short time the drop will wear the  one much more in the Tract of some Thousands of  ears the rageing and tempestuous Waves daily break∣  ng on the Rocks will produce this Effect and that  ore in some places than in others where the Rock will  e more friable and brittle and the force of the Waves  ess broken by the bounding and swadleing sand  There is something like unto this yet more surpri∣  ing in the Isle of  Foula  A hole in  Foula  on the West side of the Main∣  and if it be true what is storied of it In this Isle on the top of a hill there is a hol the mouth whereof may  e and some say now is covered with a Slaitstone going downwards to the bottom of the Rock which is said to be of a great depth particularly a Dutch Ship  aster is reported to have made a trial thereof for the gratifying his curiosity by taking up a barrel of lines with him which he let all down and yet could not found the bottom Some say he let down barrels which is very wonderful considering a barrel of lines is reckoned to be several some say Miles of length What can be the reason of such a Conveyance from the top of the Rock to the bottom and further if we may give credit to what is said I cannot possibly ima∣gine for that such a thing should be done by Art we cannot well conceive the reason why nor the Manner how it could be done and that nature should have such an operation will be as difficult to unfold  That this Countrey is generally Mossy  Dange∣rous Tra∣veling  soft and spungey hath been formerlie told as likewise that it is dangerous for people to travel through it of which many Instances may be given I shall only name two which  I  had from the Ministers of the respective bounds one Traveling in the Isle of  Yell  fell unto such a Mossy and loose piece of ground his Horse beneath him Furniture  and all sank doun and was no more seen and he him∣self with great difficulty struggled out and was save  And another in the Parish of  Tingwal  on the Mai  not long since walking on foot not far from his o  House fell into such another place wherein there d  not appear to be any hazard and over which several times for  erly he thought he had passed with safety and sank doun to the arm pits but he by stretching o  his Arms keeping his head above the surface of t  ground by the help of his servant then providential  with him and a staff fixed in the ground got wrestl  out So dangerous it is Traveling here even to the in¦habitants  Variation of the Compass remark∣able as at  Udsta  On the West side of the Isle of  Fetlor  there is a plac  whereon a Gentlemans House called  Ʋdsta  into whic  place or House if a Mariners Needle and Compass b  brought the Needle resteth not in its Poles as it doth i  other places but hath a tremulous undulating motio  and sometimes turneth round as some say to all th  points of the Horizon And a Gentleman who was in¦quisitive to know the truth of this told me that upo  trial he found it to be so and further to try the expe¦riment he took the Compass to the top of the House where it had the same effect And one of the Minister of the Northern Isles informed me that if any Ship o  Boat Sailed by or came nigh unto that place the sam  did befall their Compass  And on a Hill in  Whalsey  Also there is a little Hill nig  to the Sea on the Westside of the Isle of  Whalsey  t  which if the Compass be brought the Flowr de Luce o  that point which is ordinarily obverted to the North turneth about to the South but if the Compass be re¦moved the distance of two of three foot from the top o  the Hill there is no such effect produced This th  late Minister of the place assured me of having trie  the experiment  Observes thereupon  The many wonderful properties and effects of th  Magnes  or  LoadStone  and of other things endue  with or which do partake of this Magnetick vertue  discovered in these latter Ages hath deservedly raised  e Admiration of  Philosophers  and awakened them to  ake a diligent enquirie and Search into the reasons of  hese strange Phenomena That the Magnes hath two  oles answering to the Poles of the World to which it  o  eth it self That the Load Stone draweth Iron unto  That Iron brought unto and rubbed upon the LoadStone receiveth from it that Attractive or as some will  ave it that impulsive vertue and power and other  alities inherent in it hence the invention of the Needle so useful and necessary to Mariners for directing their Courses That if there be two spherical Load  tones they will turn to one another as each of them  oth to the  oles of the Earth and if they be detained  a contrary position they will flee from one another  nd so is it with the needle in the compass when a  oad Stone or piece of Iron is brought unto it the  eedle either cometh to or fleeth from it according to  s situation wherefore Mariners are careful that no  on be in▪ nor lying near unto their Lightroom where  e compass standeth  Renat Des Car∣tes in his Princip Philos reckoneth  That tho you should take the  eedle from its beloved Pole yet when let alone and  ft to it self it will incontinently move and take no  st until it return thereunto These strange and un∣  uth Properties hath the Load Stone as likewise  any others no less astonishing reckoned up by it's admirers many of which are known to the rudest  d most illiterate Mariner but to explain the nature of  e LoadStone and to resolve and answer the Propo∣  ls of Nature upon the head by giving the Reasons of  ese admirable effects  hoc opus hic labor est  this is the difficulty which hath vexed many and taken up the studies of the sagest and most ingenious Modern Philoso∣  ers  I shall not presume to give the reason of this strange  henomenon  An Essay concern∣ing the Reason thereof  the Needles leaving it's rest at the Pole  nd betaking it self to such a motion whether tremu∣  us and undulating or circular round the points of the  compass or the Flower de Luce turning to the So  Only I would suggest two things which if they t  not to clear what is proposed they will furt  hold out how wonderful the Loadstone and Properties are First upon the ordinary suppositi  whereby these Properties are explained that the Ea  is as a great Loadstone on the surface and exter  parts whereof a great number of volatile screwli  Particles called the  Magnetick matter  doe uncessan  move travelling from Pole to Pole alongst the surfa  of the Earth whereby the Poles of the Loadstone a  the point of the Needle affected with its vertue a  obverted to the Poles of the World Which suppositi  being made we would know that this Ma  ¦netick matter may not alwayes have the sa  motion but in some places it may be upward a  perpendicular to the surface of the Earth so that these places where they thus move perpendicularly t  Needle will not be determined to one point more th  to another of the Horizon this matter alike affecti  all the parts of the Needle by its perpendicular motio  which the  Ingenious Rohault  alledgeth as the reason w  the Compass serveth not the use of the  Hollanders  wh  they have Sailed far to the North in order to find o  a new and shorter passage to the  EastIndies  th  Needle then not turning to the Poles as it doth in ot  places but alike to all the points of the Horiz  the motion of the Magnetick matter in these more No  ¦thern places being in Lines perpendicular to the surfa  of the Earth and so likewise it may fall out in ot  places where a greater quantity of this Magneti  matter riseth from the Earth  A d thing that I would take notice of is that t  Magnetick matter in it's passage from Pole to P  meets with several Iron Mines into which it go  aside so diverting its straight Course between the Pol  because it finds an easier passage through the Pores the Iron then by passing through other places he  e variation of the Compass is Judged to be so much  kt of by Mariners in some places greater and in  hers less accordingly as the Magnetick matter is  t or less determined by the several Iron Mines into  hich it turneth aside Now in some places it may so  out that there may be a greater quantity of Iron  ough which the Magnetick matter passing and from  ich it arising may cause such a Motion whereby  needle not only inclines not to one point more  n to another in the Horizon but also by the Mag∣  ick matters ascending from and returning to the Iron  nes it may produce such an irregular motion in  e needle And that there is a great quantity of Iron  Zetland  may be knoun by the remarkable variation the Compass there for as Mariners inform us when  y Sail by the SouthEnd of  Zetland  they find the  ation to be but one point but when passing the  orth end they find it varies points and upon this  iation in directing their Course to this or the other  ce they make their reckoning Which is very ob∣  vable that in less then a degree of latitude for no  e will the length of the Isles of  Zetland  be it va∣  a a point of the Compass which must be according the Reason commonly assigned because there is  th Iron in these Isles and more especially on the  st side of the Isle of  Fetlor  for other places of the  e Isle have no such Influence on the Compass  That yet much if not the greatest part of the diffi∣  ty remains I readily grant  Some difficulty remains  and leaves it to the study  he learned and curious and indeed in many things acknowledge our Ignorance hath been reputed no all part of Wisdom so hard it is to solve and unridle  tures Secrets wherein the greatest Lights have  n benighted the following often rasing the Foun∣  ions of the Doctrines of the Former How won∣  ful are the Works of God that in Wisdom he hath  e them all And how narrow and shallow are Capacities that we cannot find out the

lead u  Glory  Little Chappels  There are in these Isles many little Chappels  generally ruinous as in the Isle of  Ʋnst  there are and upwards In the Isle of  Yell  there are many in other Isles I saw one of them in the Pa  of  Tingwal  wherein also there are several m  would have contained scarce People as I ju  and tho so little yet very great Stones were in Walls which was strange to me how that in Countrey where their Beasts are weak and they  not the help of Machines they got them lifted laid These are said to have been built by Supers  ¦ous Zealots in the times of  opery or as some ra  think by Ship wrackt Seamen who coming safe shore have Built them according to their Vows m  by them when in danger which they dedicated t  many several Saints whom they looked upon as Patrons of their Respective Chappels About w  also Men and Women of Old had their night walk  which occasioned much uncleanness but now  walkings are but little used  Snails which are medicinal found about the walls  About the Walls of these old Chappels are fo  Snails called  ShellSnails  which they dry and  ¦verize mingling the dust with their drink for the Ja¦dice by which means these who labour under this s  ¦ness in or days time will recover of the sa  but if they let this dustly for a Year without mak  use of it it turneth into small living Creatures or V  mine which they dry and bray over again if t  make any further use of it  A mettal like Gold found in  Ʋzta  In  Ʋzta  an Isle lying nigh to  Ʋnst  there is a N  ¦tal gotten having the colour of Gold which sev  of the  Dutch  Merchants have taken with them to  H  ¦burgh  and tried it there but by the force of Fire it  not become Liquid but crumbled into small pieces It is to be had there in great plenty This sheweth there may be Minerals in these Isles tho not known nor searched for  In the ChurchYard of  PapaStour  A gravestone in  PapaStour  in the Parish of  Waes  lyeth a Stone foot long at the one end two and at the other one foot broad concave from the one end to the other of which the common Tradition goes that this stone came a shore on that  sle with a dead Man tied to it who lys buried there beside it It ap∣pears to have been the Grave stone of some Person of Note in the Country which sheweth they have also had that Custom of laying at least some of their dead in such large Stones made Concave and cut out for the purpose which hath been frequent in many places with us in  Scotland  At a little distance from  Papa Stour  A Rock i  the Sea where th  ruines of an old house  lyes a Rock encompassed with the Sea called  FrauaStack  which is a  Danish  word and signifieth  our Ladys Rock  upon which are to be seen the Ruines of a House wherein they say a Gentleman did put his Daughter that so she might be shut up and secluded from the company of Men but tho a Maiden when put in yet she was found with Child when brought out notwithstanding of her being so closly kept but whither this came to pass by a Golden Shower the most powerful Courtship or not the Country hath lost the Tradition How∣ever it seemeth strange how a House should be Built on such a bare and small Rock when so many large and pleasant Isles were near unto it  The three IronCannons formerly mentioned now lying in the  Citadale  of  Lerwick  being rusted by the Sea  Cannons discharge them∣selves  wherein they had lien for Years The Inhabi∣tants of  Lerwick  to take of the rust and so fit them for their use about Years ago did set a heap of Pites about them which they puting Fire unto the Guns so soon as they were warmed and hot did all discharge themselves to the great surprisal of the Spectatours  and the Balls as some observed went half over  Brassa Sound  Which deserveth some remark that the Pow¦der all that time should retain its Elastick Force th  water if at all yet not so insinuating if self with th  Powder as to wash it away or much diminish it  vertue These who were Eye witnesses gave me this Relation  Fishes and Cattel  ittle or no  iver  It is observable that the former Year the Fishes had little or no Liver but something black i  lieu thereof which was a great loss to the Fishers they making their Oyl of those Livers As also the Oxen Sheep Swine c had little or no Fat on their Livers which useth not to be there being a kind of Con∣sumption upon the Livers of Creatures both by Sea and Land which mindeth me of  Rom    Man's sins making the Creation to groan and earnestly long as with an uplifted head for a deliverance  So that it the Creatures could speak with  Balaam  's  Ass  they would reprove the madness and sin of Man  In  Vaila  no Cat will live  There is a little Isle on the West side of  Waes  called  Vaila  wherein there is no Cat neither will any stay tho brought in as hath been done for trial but will quickly be gone they either dying or betaking them∣selves to Sea they endeavour to sweem to the next Isle Yet about Years ago there was one seen upon this Isle about that time when a Gentleman the Proprietor thereof was Tormented and put to death by the Witches but never any were seen since save what were brought in for trial as now said The reason of this I could not learn from the Ministers who gave the Information it is like because of the Air or the smell of something upon the Isle tho not per∣ceivable by the Inhabitants which agreeth not with the Temper and Constitution of these Animals  nop of  ebister  here a  arlet or  izard  ed  About a Mile from  Tingwal  to the North there is a Hill called the  Knop  of  Kebister  or  Luggies Know  nigh to which Hill there is a House called  Kebister  where a Varlet or Wizard lived comonly designed  Luggie  concerning whom it was reported that when the Sea was so Tempestuous that the Boats durst not go off to the Fishing he used to go to that Hill or Know wherein a hole into which he let down his Lines and took up any Fish he pleased as a Cod or Ling c which no other could do but himself Also when Fishing at Sea he would at his pleasure take up any rosted Fish with his Line with the Intrals or Guts out of it and so ready for his use This was certainly done by the Agency of evil Spirits with whom he was in Compact and Covenant but the OEconomy of the Kingdom of Darkness is very wonderful and little known to us He being convicted of Witch∣craft was burnt nigh to  Scalloway  As for Witches I did not  ear much of them  Concern∣ing witch∣es  as if they abounded more in this than other Countries tho I make no question but that there are many such here thus deluded by the Devil There is not then such ground for what is so commonly talkt by many with us anent their Devilry which might have affrighted us if given heed unto as if it were dangerous going or living there Tho it is said here there are many of this Hellish Stamp in  Island Lapland  and other places to the North of  Zetland  which may occasion the mistake  We said before that there were but few Rats  Concern∣ing Rats and Mice  and that only in some of the Isles and thought to come out of Ships but that they had Mice in aboundance yet in the Isles of  Burra  and  Ha  kashy  no Mice are to be found yea if they take some dust or Earth out of these Isles to other places where they are they will forsake such places where the dust is laid  When Rats leave the Ships it is lookt upon by Mariners as fatal to these Ships  It may be for the like reason why no Cats can or will live in  Ʋaila  Sometimes when the Ships are lying nigh Land the Rats will come ashore which when any of the  Hol∣landers  or others see they look upon it as Fatal to the Ship out of which they come portending that her end  some way or other will shortly approach And like¦wise it is observed that these Rats will not live abo  or Years in that Land to which they come So  of our Seamen tell us of the like as to their Ships is talkt also that these Creatures will leave Houses b  ¦fore any dismal accident befal them What grou  there is either for the one or the other  I  know not b  if true it will be hard  I  suppose to give the reas  thereof  Evil Spirits  Not above or Years ago almost every Fa¦mily had a  Brouny  or evil Spirit so called which serve  them to whom they gave a Sacrifice for his Service  as when they Churned their Milk they took a pa  thereof and sprinckled every corner of the House wit  it for Brounies use likewise when they Brewed the  had a stone which they called  Brounies Stone  where  there was a little hole into which they poured som  Wort for a Sacrifice to Brouny My Informer a Mi¦nister in the Country told me that he had converse  with an old Man who when young used to Brew an  sometimes read upon his Bible to whom an old Wo¦man in the House said that Brouny was displeased with that Book he read upon which if he continued to do they would get no more service of Brouny But h  being better instructed from that Book which wa  Brounies Eyesore and the object of his wrath when he Brewed he would not suffer any Sacrifice to be given to Brouny whereupon the st and d Brewings were spilt and for no use tho the Wort wrought well yet in a little time it left off working and grew cold▪ but of the d Browst or Brewing he had Ale very good tho he would not give any Sacrifice to Brouny▪ with whom afterwards they were no more troubled  I  had also from the same Informer that a Lady in  Ʋn  now deceased told him that when she first took up  House she refused to give a Sacrifice to Brouny upon which the st and d Brewings misgave likewise but the d was good and Browny not being re∣garded  nor rewarded as formerly he had been aban¦  ed his wonted service Which cleareth that Scrip∣  re  Resist the Devil and he will flee from you  Ja    They also had  acks of Corn which they called  Brounies Stacks  which  o they were not bound with strawropes or any way  need as other Stacks use to be yet the greatest storm  Wind was not able to blow any straw off them  Now I do not hear of any such appearances the Devil makes in these sles  Evil Spirits not now so frequently seen as for∣merly  so great and and many are  e blessings which attend a Gospel dispensation The  ounies▪ Fairies and other evil Spirits that haunted  were familiar in our Houses were dismissed and  ed at the breaking up of our Reformation if we  ay except but a few places not yet well reformed  om Popish Dregs as the Heathen Oracles were sil∣  ced at the coming of our LORD and the going  rth of his Apostles so that our first noble Reformers  ight have returned and said to their Master  Lu  as the  ce did  Lord even the Devils are subject to us through  y Name  And tho this restraint put upon the Devil  as far latter in these Northern places then with us to  hom the Light of a Preached Gospel did more early  ine yet now also do these Northern Isles enjoy the  uits of this restraint  The ap∣pearance of an old Man in the Water  About two Years and an half or three Years ago  ere was a Boat passing with several Gentlemen of the Countrey in it and by the way in the  Voe  of  Quarf  through which they went  here appeared something  nto them with its Head above the Water which as  hey could discern had the Face of an old Man with  long Beard hanging down first it appeared at some  istance from them and then coming nearer to their  o  t they had a clear sight of it The sight was  very strange and affrighting that all in the Boat were very desirous to be on Land tho the Day was fair  nd the Sea calm a Gentleman declaring as a Mini∣  ter in Company with them and saw this sight in∣  ormed me that he never saw the like tho he had tra∣  elled through many Seas  And of a Woman  I heard another remarkable story like unto this th  about Years since a Boat at the Fishing drew h  Lines and one of them as the Fishers thought having some great Fish upon it was with greater difficulty th  the rest raised from the Ground but when raised came more easily to the furface of the Water upon which a Creature like a Woman presented it self at the side of the Boat it had the Face Arms Breasts Shou  ¦ders c Of a Woman and long Hair hanging dot  the Back but the nether part from below the Breast was beneath the Water so that they could not under¦stand the shape thereof The two Fishers who were the Boat being surprized at this strange sight one  them unadvisedly drew a Knife and thurst it into h  Breast whereupon she cryed as they judged  Al  and the Hook giving way she fell backward and w  no more seen The Hook being big went in at h  Chin and out at the upper Lip The Man who thr  the Knife into her is now dead and as was observed never prospered after this but was still haunted by an evil Spirit in the appearance of an old Man who  he thought used to say unto him  Will ye do such a thing who Killed the Woman  the other Man then in the Bo  is yet alive in the Isle of  Burra  This a Gentleman and his Lady told me who said they had it from the Baillie of that place to which the Boat did belong  being so strange  I  enquired at severals thereane  which tho many were ignorant of yet some said that they had heard thereof and judged it to be very tru  Creatures in the like∣ene  of Men fre∣quently seen at Sea  That there are SeaCreatures having the likeness  Men and Women seems to be generally acknowledge  by all who have enquired thereunto they having found it confirmed by the teffimony of many in sever  Countreys as their Histories do bear Hence are a  ¦counts given of those Sea Monsters the Meermen an  Meermaids which have not only been seen but appre¦hended and keept for some time And hence probab¦ly the fiction of the Poets concerning the Sirenes ha  had its rise these enchanting Songsters translated  eermaids by our Lexicographers whose snare Ulysses  happily escaped  They tell us that several such Creatures do appear to fishers at Sea particularly such as they call  SeaTrowers  Several such Crea∣tures ap∣pear to Fi∣shers at Sea as Sea Trowes  eat rolling Creatures tumbling in the Waters which  they come among their nets they break them and sometimes takes them away with them if the Fishers  e them before they come near they endeavour to  eep them off with their Oars or long Staves and if  ey can get them beaten therewith they will endea∣vour to do it The Fishers both in  Orkney  and  Zetland  e affraid when they see them which panick fear of  eir's makes them think and sometimes say that it is  e Devil in the shape of such Creatures whether it be  or not as they apprehend I cannot determine  owever it seems to be more then probable that  il Spirits frequent both Sea and Land  A Gentleman in the Parish of  Dunressness  told one  the Ministers in this Countrey  Fresh Cockles got on the Land  that about Years  nce a Plough in this Parish did cast up fresh Cockles to the place where the Plough was going was three  arters of a Mile from the Sea which Cockles the  entlemen saw made ready and eaten How these  ell Fishes came there and should be fed at such a  stance from their ordinary Element  I  cannot know if they have not been cast upon Land by a violent Storm such of the Ground of this Parish especially what  ey Labour lying very low and the Sea hath been observed in such Storms both to cast out Stones and  ishes Or if these Cockels have been found in some  ep Furrow from which to the Sea there hath been  conveyance by some small stream upon which the  a hath flowed in stream Tides especially when there  also some storm blowing If only Shells were found  ch as of Oysters and the like the marvel would not  e great seeing such are found upon the tops of high  ountains at a greater distance from the Sea which  in all probability have been there since the Unive  deluge but that any ShellFish should be found some distance from the Sea and fit for use is son what wonderful and astonishing  A Tortoise found in the Sand  Tho no Tortoises use to be found in all these North∣ern Seas yet in  Ʋ  teFirth  in the Parish of  North  there was one found alive upon the sand in an ebb t  Shell of it was given me as a present by a Gentlem  of the Countrey it is about a Foot length and a lar  half Foot in Breadth The Inhabitants thought  strange never any such having been found in these  formerly which ever they came to the knowledge  that they could not imagine what to make of it son saying that it hath fallen out of some  EastIndia  Ship  a  ¦ing alongst by the Coasts which looks not so probably  There is a pl  ce in this Countrey called the  Neip  the Parish of  Neston  looking to the East Sea  The Par¦son of  Or∣phir  killed  where th  Parson  of  Orphir  in  Orkney  was Killed the story is thi  Patrick Stewart Earl of Orkney  as hath been said w  a great Oppressour enacting several severe and cru  Acts whereof complaint was made to  King James  And as it is reported some  Zetlanders  went to the King with their SkinCoats laying the oppressed con¦dition of their Countrey before him wherewith the King was moved yet altho not only the Earls Honour and Reputation withall was much stained and unde  a cloud by reason of his cruel and oppressive wayes but his person was hated and abhored by the People whose Superiour he was the  Parson of Orphir  d  Zealously stand in the Earls defence notwithstanding whereof the Indignation and kindled wrath of the ex  ¦asperated People against the Earl increasing the Pars¦on was forced to flee to  Zetland  for his safety upon which the People of  Orkney  not quieted some of them pursued him thither they say the Pursuers were Bre∣thern of the name of  Sinclar  who coming to the  Nei  where the Parson had his ordinary residence they ap∣prehended and dewitted him one of the Brethren tak∣ing  a sop of his heartblood As for the Earl being first emprisoned at  Dumbartoun  he was thence brought to  Edinburgh  where he was Beheaded Anno for Treason and Oppression  There are also in this Countrey as well as in  Ork∣ney  many Eagles which destroy their Lambs Fowls  Concern∣ing Eagles  c For the preventing of which some when they  ee the Eagles catching or fleeing away with their prey  se a Charm by taking a string whereon they cast some knots and repeats a form of words which be∣ing done the Eagle lets her prey fall tho at a great distance from the Charmer an instance of which I had  rom a Minister who told me that about a Month before we came to  Zetland  there was an Eagle that  ew up with a Cock at  Scalloway  which one of these Charmers seeing presently took a string his garter as was supposed and casting some knots thereupon with the using the ordinary words the Eagle did let the Cock fall into the Sea which was recovered by a Boat that went out for that end  They tell a pleasant story of an Eagle and a Turbot About Years since an Eagle fell doun on a Turbot sleeping on the surface of the Water  Concern∣ing an Eagle and a Turbot  on the East side of  Brassa  and having fastned his Claws in her he at∣tempted to flee up but the Turbot awakning and be∣ing too heavy for him to flee up with endeavoured to  raw him down beneath the Water thus they strugled for  ome time the Eagle labouring to go up and the Turbot to go down till a Boat that was near to them and beheld the sport took them both selling the Eagle to the  Hollanders  hen in the Countrey For they say when the Eagle hath  astned his Clawes in any Creature he cannot loose them this pleasure but useth to eat them out so that the prey sometimes cometh to be a snare to this Rapacious Fowl  On the Westside of the Mainland  A Holm frequented by Sea Fowls  there is a Holm belonging to a Gentleman in the Parish of  Northerne van  much frequented by Fowl that when sometimes they go in to it in the Summer season Fowls of several  kinds will flee so thick above their Heads that th  will cloud the very Air yet therein there are few  none during the Winter but in  February  they use  begin to come by pairs and for two or Dayes aft  they first come they will sit so close that almost they m  be taken hold of which is imputed to their being wearied after a long flight from some far Countrey▪ The Proprietour of this Holm may almost every Day in Summer take a Basket full of Eggs out of it and they scarcely be missed for it is so well furnished th  none almost can set doun a Foot for young Fowls  Eggs which are very serviceable to this Gentleman  House and the Countrey about  Noss of  Brassa  high  To the East of  Brassa  is an Isle called the  Noss Brassa  wherein a ragged Rock looking to South East the highest in all this Countrey serviceable to Mari¦ners for directing their course when Sailling to the West from Eastern Countreys some Gentlemen told  that they verily think from the surface of the Water to the top of the Rock it will be Fathoms up¦on which a great many Fowls have their Nett  whose Eggs they take in the Summer time as also some of the Fowls by letting a Man doun from the to  of the Rock by a Rope Tied about his middle Be¦fore this Isle lyeth a Rock Raggie On all sides about Fathomshigh from the surface of the Water but b  reason of its Raggedness and Declivity and its being sur¦rounded with Sea on all handes it is scarce possible t  climb it  A Holm dying be∣fore it where Fowls nu∣merous  Yet the Owners of the Isle being desirous to be a  the Fowls and Eggs numerous upon it about  Years since there was a Man for the hire of a Co  undertook to climb the lesser Rock and to fasten  Pales or Stakes thereupon which he accordingly did bu  in the cominng down he fell into the Sea and Perished  The way how they get into this Holm Remark∣able  The way how they get into this lesser rock is ob¦servable which is thus opposite to the two Stakes o  the lesser there are also Stakes fastened on the highe  Rock it being but fathoms over between the  Rocks to which Stakes ropes are fastned reaching from Rock to Rock the Ropes they put through the  oles of an Engine called a Craddle all which being so prepared a Man getteth into the Cradle and warpeth himself over from the Noss or the greater Rock to the  ffer and so having made a good purchase of Eggs and  owls bought at the expence of the danger of his life  returns the same way he went These Ropes hang  ot on all Winter but in the Summer time in the Month of  June  ordinarily when the Day is calm they  st the Ropes from the greater to the lesser Rock Which so they do they have st some small Rope or  ordage to which there is a stone fastned and they  eeping both the ends of this small Rope in their  ands an able Man throweth the stone into the lesser  ock and when casten over the stakes they heave or  ft up this small Rope with a long Pole that so the  ought of the Rope may be gotten about the stakes which being done they draw to them the small rope  ll a greater tied to it be brought about also  and so  oth ends of the greater Rope they secure by the stakes  n the top of the Noss  Industriae nihil Im∣possibile Nil tam difficile est quod non solertia vincat  on which strong and greater  ope the Cradle being put it runneth from Rock to  ock Easily a Man in the Cradle goeth from the Noss  the Holm or Rock by reason of its descent but with greater difficulty do they return therefore there is a  mall Rope tied to the Cradle whereby Men on the  loss help to draw them back I do not hear that any there such another Cradle is to be found How many  re the Inventions which Man hath found out  This Holm is much frequented by Fowls more than  ny other place on the East side of  Zetland  This Holm frequented by Fowls  as the  ther Holm of  NorthMevan  is on the West side the  owls have their Nests on the Holms in a very beau∣tiful order all set in raws in the form of a Dovecoat and  ch kind or sort do Nestle by themselves as the Scarfs  y themselves so the Cetywaicks Tominories Mawes  c There is a Fowl there called the Scutiallan of a  black colour and as big as a Wild Duck which do  live upon the Vomit and Excrements of other Fow  whom they pursue and having apprehended them th  cause them Vomit up what meat they have lately take not yet digested The Lords Works both of Natu  and of Grace are wonderful all speaking forth H  Glorious Goodness Wisdom and Power  Concern∣ing the dangers the Inha∣bitants un∣dergo  Remarkable are the Dangers which many in the Isles do undergo in climbing the Rocks for Fowls a  Eggs especially in  Foula  where the Inhabitants in the Summer time do most live by this kind of Provision and are judged to be the best climbers of Rocks in a  this Country for some of them will fasten a Stake o  Knife as some say in the ground on the top of the Rock to which they ty a small Rope or Cord and  they will come down the face of the Rock with th  in their hand or Fathoms and do re¦turn bringing up Eggs and Fowls with them but in¦deed very many of them lose their lives this way ye  it is observed that few old Men are to be seen ther  they being so cut off before they arrive at old Age  Many of them are weary of the dangers and hazard  they daily incur yet neither will they leave the place nor give over these perilous attempts all the sad in¦stances of their Friends and Neighbours Perishing an  death cannot have this influence to deter and affrigh  them from undergoing the like hazards  Labor om∣nia vincet Improbus duris urgens in rebus Eges∣tas  Virg  At so sma  a rate do they value their lives that for a few Fow  and Eggs they will endanger them whereas they might have as good and a much safer living elsewher  As this sheweth both their Folly and their Sin  Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos per Ma  e pauperiem fugiens per laxa per Ignes  what fatigue and danger Men will expose themselves t  for the avoiding Poverty and Straits for the upholding this Clayie Tabernacle which ere long will mould  into the dust and often not so much for the satisfying the necessary cravings of Nature as the superfluous an  insatiable desires of our Lusts Sometimes one Ma  will stand on the top of the Rock holding the end  the Rope in his hand and another will go down  hich neither is without danger as they tell us of one  o thus holding his Neighbour did let the rope slip  d down fell the Climber into the Sea but providen∣  ly there being a Boat near by they got hold of him  d took him in and so came home before his Neigh∣bour who judged him to have perished The other  an at length came home with great Sorrow and Greif  grating the Death of his Neighbour but he hearing  he was already come home was not a little con∣  unded and astonished at the report until that at  eeting the Man in danger narrated the manner of his  eliverance which afforded unto them both great  atter of refreshment and joy  In all

Church  of  Ireland  a Promon∣  y belonging to the Main f  om the top of one of  hich Towers you can see another Built they say by  ree Sisters who from their several Towers could  ve advertisement to one another  The Church of  Tingwal  standeth on a Valley be∣tween two Hills lying East and West  A Holm called the  LawTing  and is about the  ddle of the Mainland It was in this Parish in a  all Holm within a Lake high to this Church there the Principal Feud or Judge of the Country  el to fit and give Judgment hence the Holm to this  ay is called the  LawTing  from which probably the  arish of  Tingwal  had its name we go into this Holm  steping stones where three or four great Stones  e to be seen upon which the Judge Clerk and other Officers of the Court did sit All the Country concerned to be there stood at some distance from the  olm on the side of the Loch and when any of their  auses was to be Judged or Determined or the judge  ound it necessary that any Person should compear be∣fore him he was called upon by the Officer and went  in by these steping stones who when heard retur  the same way he came And tho now this place be  the Seat of Judgement there is yet something am  them to this day which keepeth up the Memory their old Practice for at every end of the Loch th  is a House upon whose Grass the Country Men co  ¦ing to the Court did leave their Horses and by rea  the Masters of these Houses did suffer a loss this w  they were declared to be Scatfree hence at this pres  time two places in the Parish of  Sanfling  do pay S  for the one and  Coningsburg  in  Dunrossness  for t  other  Scat  is a kind of Rent or Due which is Yea payed to the  King  or his  Taxmen  by the Gentlem  and several others in the Country This Court thought to have

crowd of People standing on the side the Loch without being apprehended and touch  Steeple of the Church of  Tingwal  the Sentence of Dea  was Retrieved and the Condemned obtained an Inde  ¦nity For

Scalloway  there an high Stone standing in form of an Obelisk as so  Ancient Monument concerning which the People ha  various Traditions some saying that in the  Strath Tingwal  where this Stone is erected there was a Bloo  Fight between the  Danes  and the old Inhabitants Natives of this Country and that the  Norvegian Danish  General was killed in this place where t  Stone is set up Others report that one of the Ea  of  Orkney  had a profligate and prodigal Son who  this cause being animadverted upon by his Father fl  to  Zetland  and there built a Castle or a strong Ho  for himself within a Loch at  Stroma  within two Mi  Tingwal  to the West the ruines whereof are yet be seen His Father not being satisfied with his  ape and the way he took for his Defence sent from  kney  or Men to pursue him to whom he gave  ders that they should bring his Son to him either  d or alive The Son thereupon not finding him∣  safe enough in his Castle made his escape from  Castle where the Pursuers lay in Ambush but was  ertaken by them in the  Strath  of  Tingwal  and killed  re whereupon this Monument was erected The  rsuers took off his head and carried it with them to  Father but in so doing they were so far from gra∣  ying of him that he caused them all to be put to  Death notwithstanding of the orders given by  There is in the Parish of  Tingwal  a little off the way  we go from  Lerwick  to  Scalloway  Concern∣ing a Spring  a Fountain or  ing of very pure and pleasant Water which run∣  through a great Stone in the Rock by the passage of  ound hole which if you stop the Water forceth its  y through the pores of the Stone in other places  Stone it seems being very porous and spungy  One of the Ministers told us of a Monster born the  Year in the Parish of  Neston  about or  Monsters born  les from  Lerwick  That one day when he was com∣  g to the Presbytry and standing at the Ferryside  er which he was to pass two Women came to him  quainting him with fear and greif that their Neigh∣  ur near by had been Travelling in ChildBirth under  d Labour for days past and had brought forth Monster which had upon its Forehead like a Pirwig  Flesh and Hair raised and towered up and by  e sides of the head there were like wires of Flesh  ming down Moreover it had two raws of Teeth  th a Mouth like a Rabbet destitute of Arms and  gs After the Birth there was some life in it and  moved a little but lived not long the Women  isting at the Birth for a time were affraid to touch it  it being such a strange and formidable sight T  Minister desired to see it but it was Buried before came The same Woman also formerly had brou  forth two Monsters the first whereof was a con  and undigested  mp of Flesh and the second ha  Mouth in its Breast  We enquired concerning the Woman and they t  us that they knew nothing of Scandal they could la  her Charge but that she had lived soberly all her li  only one of the Ministers informed us that after had brought forth the first Mon  ter he heard that a Years time thereafter she used to go bare footed the Church of  Wisdale  every Lord's Day and p  there according to the Vow she had made after Birth thinking thereby that this might Atone what was past and prevent the like for the Future this be true God hath judicially punished her Conceiving and Bringing forth the two follow Monsters each more wonderful and preternatural t  the other  God's judgments on Adul∣terers  Several Adulteries came before the  Commission  atte  ¦ed with heinous aggravating Circumstances One  ¦stance we had very remarkable of one  James Mo  in the Parish of  North Mevan  who had been lying Adultery with one  Clara Tutloch  his Wi  e being d  not many Years since Between which  Mowa  Tulloch  there were several Children Procreated  were all Idiots and Fools so that they could not k  themselves either from Fire or Water or put t  meat in their Mouths tho there be one of them of Years and others of them tho younger yet come some considerable Age Which sheweth the mani  Judgment of God against Adulterers he often or  ¦ing his Providential Dispensations so towards the  that they may read their Sin in their Punishment this wretched Man was forced by the power of his so convinced Conscience to confess before the Presbyt  That he was sensible the Judgments of God were p  ¦suing  him whereof he gave the said sad Instance as  et to be seen from the Presbyteries Records Another Adulterer also did Compeir before us who did con∣tinue in the Commission of this his Sin for many Years  nd doth bear in his Face the shameful reproof there∣of and the just marks of the Lords Indignation against him for the same It is a very sad thing for any to be pining away both in Judgments and Sins  A Minister here told me a passage not to be passed without a Remark of God's Righteous Judgment and Holiness  Another instance of God's judgments on Adul∣terers  A certain Woman in his Parish about Years since fell into Adultery with an old Married Man he to cover his Villany advised her to give way to another young Mans sinning with her who then was  n suit of her and frequented her Company that so if there were a Child she might Father it upon this young and unmarried Man Accordingly as was ad∣vised it fell out the young Man sinned with her and she being found with Child is summoned to compeir before the Session who having interrogated her con∣cerning her Uncleanness and who was the Father of the Child she answered that she never knew or had Carnal Dealing with any save such a young Man But this covering could not serve the turn in palliating their Filthiness God in His Wise Providence so order∣ing it that tho there was the Interval of Months between the old and the young Mans sinning with her yet when the time of her delivery came she first brought forth a perfect Child of Months and the day after another imperfect of Months according to the several times of the old Man and the young Mans sining with her She being convinced that this was of the Lord and that she could not hide her sins from God tho she sought to do it from Men she in∣genuously acknowledged her Guilt with both and for the Scandal is now giving Satisfaction in the Parish of  Ʋnst  Another instance  We had also the Lamentable Account of the Tra¦gical end of one  Mr Gilbert Hendry  Adulterer in re¦pute for his acuteness of wit and the many excellen  Poems he composed He being a married Man had car¦nal converse with another Woman at which his Friends and Welwishers being greatly concerned one o  them laid hold of an oppertunity to accost and set upo  him earnestly intreating he might break off his unclea  and debauched converse with that Woman holding ou  unto him his sin and Misery and using what Argu¦ments he thought might prevail for that end but h  gave a deaf ear unto all that was said and by no mean would be disswaded from haunting her Company ye  in contempt of the admonition and reproof made as  he were going to that Womans House the same night and so parting from his freind went in the evening to Water or Loch side where he walked for some tim  alone and then appeared a Man in company with him all in black and thus they contiuned walking together till Night as the People observing did Judge and the next Morning this miserable wretch was found dea  with his brains dashed out tho there were no stone near to that place where he lay on a Hill side at a little distance from the Water his head and shoulders lying dounward to the descent of the Hill his brains wen  scattered and the ground about him was all troden a  if there had been saith my Informer Men and Hor¦ses for hours upon the Spot It is not many Year since this fell out So bad a recompense doth the Devi  give his Vassals and Slaves for their service for  Whore¦mongers and Adulterers God will Judge  which Judgment often he beginneth to inflict in this life for the punish∣ment of the guilty and the terrour of all and to shew that he is of purer eyes then that he can behold such horrid Iniquity  Observe on the  Spa∣nish Ar∣mado  tho the pouring out of the full vials of his Wrath he reserveth for the

the whole  The Fish∣ing de∣cayed be∣side what formerly it hath been  The Fishing here is much decayed by what it wa  for now neither is there such a great number of Fish taken nor so easily can they be had as formerly  not above or Years since the Fishers wo  have taken the great Fishes such as Killen Ling in the Voes or Lochs and that in great numbers a  so were not necessitated to underly such danger a  toil in going out to the Sea but could have lien b  ¦fore their oun doors and drawen the Fishes whi  certainly was more safe easy and convenient to the  in many Respects Whereas now they are obliged  put out some Leagues unto the Sea and so far oft  that they almost sink the Land else they cannot  a  any Fishing worth their expence and pains whi  cannot but be very toilsome and dangerous in case storm should arise and blow off the Land and so p  them to Sea with their little Boats or Yoals not ab  to keep ong out against the violent and swelling wav  and so hath it fallen o  t unto some who being toss  to and fro whether tide and Wind did drive the  have never seen Land any more And as it is dang  ¦  s  so it is toilsome and costs them much labour  ing often they ly some Nights and Days at Sea and  come ashore  The Fishing formerly being greater then what now  s occasioned they say  Notwith∣standing their Fi∣shing yet is great  some hundreds of mo Ships  sort Yearly unto this Countrey then what now  to do when Fishes cannot be had for to serve them  indeed neither now are the Fishes so sought after  ometime they have been when they could be easily  many being willing rather to stay at home and  ch what they can about the Coasts which ordinarily  but the smaller Fishes then to undergo such hazards  toil in following the greater which an  Hamburgh∣  chant  waiting for a lading complained to me of  Altho when we institute the Comparison between  former and the latter times  Fishes taken in great numbers Anno  their present Fishing  l appear to be but small yet if we take it und  r  w as it is in it self without such a respect we will find  o be very considerable for tho in some Years it be  ater then in others yet every Year many trading  os are thereby laded and this same Year the  ing is thought to be very good an Instance whereof Merchant gave us that in one Week in the Month  June  there were taken by some Boats belonging to  place of  Northmevan  Ling all which were  ught in for the Loadening of that Ship wherein he  concerned And another Gentleman added that  e other Boats at a little distance from these drew  ut mo  but this was something exterordinary  useth not often to fall out that in one Week they  e such a number  The Fishes that do most abound here are Killin  What Fishes abound here  g c which being salted and dried Foreigners export  m to other Countreys of these as hath been said  re is a great plenty but are not ordinarily taken near  Land as for Haddocks Whitings and such lesser  ite Fishes they care not so much for the seeking af∣  except what is for their oun use for strangers use  but seldom to buy them And these greater Fishes th  get a greater quantity of in some places then in othe  as off  Dunrossness Northmevan Ʋnst Yell  c  Herring numerous  Great shoals of Herring do sweem also in these Se  which are taken in the Summer season especially the Month of  July  and the beginning of August sometimes then they will come within a Penniest  cast of the shore and be sweeming so thick and ta  so fast that one Boat will call upon another to co  and help them and take a part of their Fishes Th  Herrings taken here are reckoned to be very good  not among the best that are taken upon the Isles  longing to the  King of Britain's Dominions  and as n  said of the white Fish so it is of the Herrings they f  ¦quent some places more then others as off  Brassa  to t  East and between  Brassa  and  Whalsey  or the  Skerr  where the Bushes do commonly ly within sight of  Land of  Zetland  And whatever may be said of  Gro  his Mare Commune or Liberum  yet it holds here for a  have or take liberty to come and Fish in these se  without any way acknowledging that Soveraig  whereunto these Isles do belong  So Silluks and Seths out of whose Livers good Oyl is got  There are likewise here a great many Grey Fis  taken which they call Silluks and Seths which  Judged to be the same kind of Fish only the Seths▪ a greater and older Silluks a thick and fat Fish out of one liver of some Seths they will get a pint our measure of Oyl with which Oyl the Inhabita  pay part of their Rents and sells the rest unto M  ¦chents The Oyl they get after this Manner They  the Liver into a Pot or Pan half full of Water wh  when seething the Oyl by the force of the fire or be¦ing Water is drawn from the Liver which so be  separated and sweeming above they take or scum  off and puts in vessels for the use These Seths are be had about all the Coasts but more especially ab  Dunrossness Delton  and some other places The  ¦luks as hath been observed are very numerous in O¦    but more rarely are the Seths to be had there tho  e same kind of Fish but in  Zetland  there is no scarci∣  of both  Among the many other excellent Fishes which are  re for to be had there are the Tusk a rare  Tusk a rare Fish  wholsome  d delicious Fish no less pleasant to the taste then  ey are to the eye some of them are as big as Ling  a broun and yellow colour with a broad tail when  aking ready for use they swell in the pan more then  y other Fish when made ready their Fish is very  hite and clear when new haled they are much  ore pleasant to eat then when salted and dryed for  n I think they lose much of their Savour and Re∣  h They begin to Fish for them about the end of  May  beginning of  June  and are taken to the East of the  e of  Brassa  or between  Brassa  and  Whalsey  opening to  e Coasts of  Norway  and here only are they to be  und and more rarely in other places except off  Dun∣  siness  where also sometimes they are got The Fi∣  ers often go out about the beginning of the Week  d not return home till the end of it and the further  ey go off to the Sea they will get them the bigger  d in greater numbers They use to sell them to the  amburghers  for or  lib  Scots the or six  ore and some of them also are taken to other places  here they are much desired by such as know them  Those who commonly frequent this Countrey and  ade with the Inhabitants are  Hamburghers  This Countrey frequen∣ted by  Hambur∣gers Bre∣mers  c  and some∣  mes  Bremers  and others who come here ordinarily  the Month of  May  or about the beginning of  June  d in several places set up Booths or Shops where  ey sell Liquours as Beer Brandie c and wheat∣  ead as that which they call Cringel Bread and the  ke they also sell several sorts of CremeWare as Li∣  n Muslin c And these Merchants seek nothing  tter in Exchange for their Commodities then to tru  k  ith the Countrey for their Fishes which when the  shers engage to the Merchants will give them ei∣ther  Money or Ware which they please and so  Fishers going to Sea what they take they bring o  in the Week or oftener as they have occasion  layes them down at their Booth Door or in any o  place where the Merchant appoints them to be  and they being there numbered the Merchants acco  for them accordingly these Fishes which are o  arly great white Fishes as Killen Ling and the like Merchants or their Servants having dried they t  them Aboard of their Ships Several such  D  Booths are to be seen through the Isles as ord  ¦arily in the Isle of  Ʋnst  two in  Yell  c  Holland∣ers  also re∣pair there unto for HerringFishing  The  Hollanders  also repair to these Isles in  J  as hath been said for their Herring Fishing but t  cannot be said so properly to Trade with the Count  as to Fish upon their Coasts and they use to bring sorts of Provisions necessary with them save s  fresh Victuals as Sheep Lambs Hens c Wh  they buy on shore Stockins also are brought by  Countrey People from all quarters to  Lerwick  and s  to these Fishers for sometimes many thousands of the  will be ashore at one time and ordinary it is wi  them to buy Stokins to themselves and some likew  do to their Wives and Children which is very ber  ¦  ial to the Inhabitans for so Money is brought in the Countrey there is a Vent for the Wooll and t  Poor are Employed Stokins also are brought fro  Orkney  and sold there whereby some gain accrues the Retailers who wait the coming of the  Dutch  Fle  for a Market  Much ad∣vantage redound∣eth to them from their Trade with the  Hamburg∣ers  But especially much advantage doth redound  them from their Trade with the  Hamburgers  for b  ¦sides that they are furnished by them with Provision what necessary what convenient these Merchants brin  a considerable Sum of Money with them so that  one of their Ministers told me Ships are ordinar  reckoned to have Dollars aboard which the  leave behind them not only for Fishes but also fo  several other things which are the product of the Countrey as Butter Oyl c And if any please not to take their Commodities they presently give them Mo∣ney upon the receipt of the Goods The Proprietors also or Masters of the Ground upon which these Booths are Built reap a considerable Gain for some of them will get to Dollars  per annum  for the use of a House in the Summer Season to be a Booth and I think twice or thrice the Sum will Build them  Upon the whole of this Chap we may entertain these following Reflections First  Some re∣flections on this Chap  Hence we may observe the  P  wer Wisdom  and  Goodness of GOD  His  POWER  in that his Hands have made this great and wide Sea  Ps    wherein are things creeping innumer∣able how many Millions of great and small Fishes are every Year taken yet the next we expect to be served with as great a number God giving these Creatures the Sea for their proper Habitation and providing suit∣able Provision for them in that Element where neither Seedtime nor Harvest yet all these wait upon Him  Psal    and he giveth them their Meat in due Season His  WISDOM  in that wise and beautiful Order to be ob∣served among these Brutal Creatures the several kinds knowing their coming and their going time and their loving to frequent one place of the Water more than mother tho both under the same Climate Their going forth all of them by Bands tho they have no King Overseer or Ruler these  Squammosae Cobortes  tho  ot governed by Principles of Reason yet by their Na∣tural Instinct being reasonably Acted each to their proper ends for the Maintenance and Preservation of their several kinds give occasion to reasonable Man to Acknowledge Admire and Adore the Infinite Wis∣dom of his and their Maker Here also the  GOOD∣NESS of GOD  is to be observed in this that all these  e given for the Service of Man that not only our Tables should be Furnished with the Creatures that  reath in the same Element with us but also with these  that live in another and seeing all these are as it we Sacrificed for our use  Rom    should we not  Present our selv  Souls and Bodies living Sacrifices Holy and Acceptable u  God which is our Reasonable Service  Seeing that G  hath made Man to have Dominion over the Beasts the Field the Fowls of the Air and the Fishes of t  Sea should we not gratefully shew forth His Prai  and say with all the wise Observers of Providence  Psal    Lord our Lord how excellent is thy Name in all  Earth  It is the Fishing only which makes this Countr  any way desirable else it would be very unpleasant li  ¦ing there  Hec Boeth Hist  as  Boeth  of old did observe  Quorum o  universae in piscibus sole arefactis quas quotannis ad eos  ¦cedentes Hollandi Zelandi ac Germani aliarumque rer  vulgarium permutatione mercantur  Yea if we abstra  from their FishingTrade in many places there cot  not be any living at all they not having Fields eith  for CornLand or Grazing but they Trading  Fishes with Foreign Merchants who Import ma  Goods for the more comfortable living of the Countre  their coming in the Summer is very refreshful to all t  Inhabitants the thoughts and expectation of which the Winter doth not a little revive them when th  shall enjoy some better Fare than what their Countre  doth afford when  Hamburgh  Liquors and Commod  ¦ties shall be brought to their Doors which being e  ¦pected and desired may occasion sometimes their ta  ¦ing of a larger Cup they knowing that the Booths w  not always stand open  It is to be observed that still the further Nor  we go  Non om∣nis fert omniae Tel∣lus  the Fishes are to be had in greater aboundanc  in  Zetland  more than in  Orkney  and in  Island  to th  North of  Zetland  more than in either the Inhabitan  there mostly living upon Fishes And again we ma  nottice as there is not such a plenty of Fishes in  Orkn  as in  Zetland  yet there is a greater of Corn and  in  Zetland  there is more Corn than in  Island  for i  Island  they have little if any Corn as the product of  heir Countrey as some in  Zetland  did inform me who  ave conversed with these that had been there There∣  ore the Commonalty generally make use of dried  ishes beaten small in stead of Bread as  Boeth  hinteth  t  Ʋltra Schethlandicas aliae quaedam Insulae  Boeth Hist  quae pisces  efactos ac sole induratos pistillo contundunt mox admista quâ in pastillos componunt atque ad focum torrent qui illis  nis est  Which sheweth us the great  Wisdom of God  n His Works of Providence who bestoweth not all Blessings upon every Nation but when He denyeth  r giveth less of one Blessing to one Nation or Coun∣  rey He alloweth them more of another which is also often observed with respect to particular Persons This variety likewise sheweth the necessity and advan∣  age of one Nation or Kingdoms Trading with ano∣ther  The FishingTrade is very Lucrative and En∣  iching to these who closely follow it it is commonly  aid that it is the Fishing which first raised the  Ne∣  herlands  to that pitch of Grandure and Wealth which  ow they have arrived at hence some Historians call the Fishery  The GoldMine of Holland  and that by  heir Fishing especially in the  British Seas  And if it were  ot so very Gainful what would make them every Year Equip such a numerous Fleet of several hund∣reds of Bushes under the Guard and Protection of their Convoyes but that they know the  Zetland Seas  makes their Mills to go therefore they do so warmly pursue this Trade and Encourage the U  dertakers thereof And so it is with the  Hamburgers  and other Merchants especially in the  Hans Towns  who Trading here during the Summer Season return home in  Au∣gust  or  September  they not only with Fishes serving their Respective Cities but by sending them also up the Countrey do make a good Market which engageth and Encourageth them to return every Year and follow the same Trade  The Consideration of this great Gain that dot  redound to the Trading Merchants hath of late an  ¦mated some Gentlemen and others in  Zetland  t  enter into a Society or Company for Trading in Fishes that whereas Strangers make such a good hand wit  their Fishes they may as well consult their own Pro¦fite and Gain by Promoting of that Trade whic  tendeth so much to the Enriching of others especiall  seeing they can do it with far less Trouble and Ex¦pence when here at Home where the Fishes are to b  had which when taken and prepared may be s  n  Abroad for Sale to Foreign Markets whereas th  Hamburgers  and others which come here are obliged to tarry from Home through the Summer waiting for their Lading  It hath been thought very strange by many that our own Fishing for which we have so great and so inviting Advantages beyond others should yet b  so much neglected by our selves and left to the Im¦provement of Strangers who reap vast Gain from it▪ And as this deserves the consideration of the Govern¦ment so it might be expected that the late disappoint¦ment in the Holy and Wise Providence of this Na  i¦ons Noble and Generous Attempt to have Settled  Foreign Plantation for raising us from the Dunghil  of Contempt and Poverty and Advancing our Wealth and Trade will excite both these worthy Undertaker  and others to Employ their Stocks and Endeavours i  searching after and digging these Mines of the Ocean nearer Home and Profiting by these Blessings which Providence has brought to our very Doors especially since thereby not only would a number of able Seame  be Yearly Trained for the use and service of the Na¦tion and the Nation thereby put in a better Capacity for Undertaking and Supporting greater Projects o  Trade in the more remote parts of the World bu  likewise many poor People would be Employed wh  are ready to Starve And it is more reasonable w  should Fish in our own Seas than for Strangers so to  And I do greatly question if the  Hollanders  mburgers  or others would so permit us to Fish in  y Seas so nigh to their Land depending on their  veraignty as we do them  And for this end Shiping would be Encouraged  the Government and Trading Merchants as the  llanders  do An Instance whereof we had when in  tland  a  Holland  Ship came into  Brassa Sound  from  sing about the  Fair Isle  waiting for the  East India  et  having in her Wine Brandy Victuals c for  ir use that they might be Refreshed before they  ived at their Port and this the Trading Company  glect not ordinarily to do which sheweth they are  at Encouragers of Trade And for the Encourag∣  of Trade Taxations imposed upon Shiping should  easy especially now when the Trade is so low  t many Merchants and ShipMasters after they  e hazarded their Lives and their All do return  sers Home For if otherwise no wonder that all  ncerned in Trade be Dispirited and Discouraged in  empting any thing that is Noble which might tend  the Nations Publick Good  CHAP X Concerning  Pightland Firth  the several  Tides  which meet there the danger of  Passage c  THE noise that  Pightland Firth  makes among many who only have heard thereof as being noted and  nous for its Danger to Passengers  Concern∣ing  Pight∣land  Firth  and the Causes  ich concur to render it so awakened us more par∣  ularly to enquire concerning it which we had op∣  rtunity to do in our Return from  Zetland  by  Ork∣ney  to  Caithness  And therefore seeing we passed it in Voyage I shall not altogether pass it in this Narrati  but communicate to the Inquisitive what I kn  either from my own or others observation anent i  Why so called  This Firth is commonly called  Pictland Pightland Penthland Firth  doubtless from the  Picts  whose Ki  ¦dom of old  Orkney  was divided by this Firth fr  the Continent of  Scotland Blaw in his Atlas  or  ¦graphy  tells us of a certain Tradition shewing how came first to be so Denominated That the  Picts  o  time being Defeat by the  Scots  who pursued Victory unto  Caithness  and  Dungisby Head  where Vanquished Remnant so hotly Pursued not judg  themselves safe were forced to take Boats and go o  the Firth to  Orkney  but the  Orkney  Men conveen  upon the Alarm of their Landing did so warmly  ¦ceive them with a sharp Conflict that the  Picts  w  obliged to Retire and take themselves to their B  again with which they going off and not acquain  with the running of the Tides they all Perish  upon which sad Catastrophe so Fatal to the  Pictish  ¦tion this Firth ever since was called  Pictland  or  Pi  ¦land Firth Buchanan  calls it  Penthland Firth  as it  commonly pronounced from one  PENTHƲS  who this  Penthus  was our Historian hath not b  pleased to impart unto us  Buch Hist l    Nam Penthlandici montes fretum Penthlandicum a Pentho non a Picto composita vt possunt  Some Historians relate That the  Picts  com  first out of  Germany  into  Orkney  which they Inhabi  for a Season thence they passed over to  Caithness  other parts of the North of  Scotland  so that he  this Firth is called  Pictland Firth  The Firth is commonly said to be Miles bro  and I think they are but short  Its breadth and what Coasts it washeth  but this may be  ¦bundantly compensed by the danger of the passag  it is bounded on the North by the Isles of  Orkney  on the South by  Dungisbyhead  in  Caithness  to West is the  Deucaledonian Ocean  whence the Fl  comes and to the East is the  German Ocean  whence  Ebb runneth The landing places are  Burwick  Southermost point of  SouthR  nal  sha  in  Orkney  d  Dungisbyhead  the northernmost in  Caithness  John Grot  House  called  o John Grotts House  the Northermost House in  tland  the Man who now liveth in it and keepeth  nn there is called  John Grot  who saith this House  h been in the possession of his Predecessours of that  e for some Hundreds of Years which na  e of  is frequent in  Caithness  Upon the Sand by  John  ots House  are found many small pleasant Buckies and  lls beautified with diverse Colours which some  to put upon a string as Beeds and account much for their rarity It is also observed of these shells  Varietates delectat  t not one can be found altogether like another And  on the review of the parcel I had I discerned some  ference among them which variety renders them  more beautiful  In the Firth are the sles of  Swinna Stroma  and  Pightland  rries  The Isles of Swinna Pight∣land Sker∣ries and Stroma in the Firth  From  Burwick  to the WestNorthWest lyes  inna  one of the Isles of  Orkney  a little sle where∣  are some Inhabitants who have a good Fishing a∣  ut the Isle but often with great danger not only cause it is in  PightlandFirth  where many Tides do  ▪ but because of some dangerous Wells or Whirle∣  ols which are nigh unto it From  Burwick  about  Miles to SouthEast lyes  Pightland Skerries  danger∣  to Seamen these  Skerries  being in the mouth of  the Firth to the East upon which both in Ebb and  od there goes a great Sea therein is some good  a∣  re but not Inhabited save sometimes in the Sum∣  er season In the Firth also is the Isle of  Stroma  little pleasant Isle abounding with Corns about a Mile  d an half long and half a Mile broad and tho it be in  Firth yet it is not reckoned as one of the Isles of  Orkney  because of its vicinity to  Caithness  from which is but about Miles dis  ant and this is the only Isle  which belongs unto  Caithness  and is still under  Jurisdiction of the Lords of that Countrey  Besides the Isles some Skerries  Besides the Isles there are also some  Skerries  as  ¦fore  Burwick  not half a Mile from Land there is o  seen at an Ebb upon which about Years ago w  cast away a Ship belonging to  Aberdeen  and all  Men in her as they say were lost  Many Tides go here  Altho the Sea in this Firth floweth and ebbe twice in the Hours as it doth in other places  there is a meeting of many Tides here which runni  contrary one to another cause that great rage and a  were a conflict of Waters which is terrible to beho  and dangerous to engage with What is the numb  of these Tides cannot well be con  escended upo  some say others and others  Blaw in  Geography  hinteth at this and the reason thereof she  ¦ing that the Sea running among the  Orkney  Isles  thereby restrained and made to go through the  as so many Waterspouts which meeting in this Fi  render it so formidable and dangerous But beca  of the pertinency and elegancy of the Historian up  this head  Geogra Elavi de Freto Pent  ∣landiae  I shall give his own Words  Fret  hoc Navigantibus formidabile neque nisi sta  temporibus quanquam positis ventis trajectui o  portunum Causa est cum aestus maris quotidie a se  tentrionibus incitetur in his locis Orchadas circu  fusus iisque imerfusus hic primum objectu terrar  coercetur unde vis illa immensa aquarum multis  nalibus insulas illas permeans dein reliquo mari  hoc Freto effusa luctantibus etiam maris Vergivii  Orientalis undis formidabiles aquarum Vortices cu  summo navium periculo creat  And indeed wh  we see the many impetuous Tides coming out into t  Firth from among the Isles of  Orkney  each beari  that course to which they are determined by the La  and Isles they wash and beat upon we will not judge  strange that there should be such a meeting of Tides  this Firth for as some express it  Every craiglug  makes a new Tide  and many Craigs and Lugs are there here  Hence it is clear that the Tide will run with a great∣er rapidity and force in some places then in others  The Tide stronger in some places then in others  as when we pass that part of the Firth where we meet with the Tide in the Ebb running off the sides of  Pight∣land Skerries  from South East down into the  Swelchie of Stroma  then the men most  ly their Oars and work hard lest they be born down into the  Swelchie  a dan∣gerous place When also we are or Miles from  Cathnes    there is another such rapid current comeing from the South of  Dungisbay  Head out of  Murray Firth  running upon  Stroma  both into the  Swelchie  on the North and into the  Merriemen of Mey  on the South end of the Isle In our passage through this Current for half an hour we made not as we could observe one foot of Way tho there were Men tug∣ging at the Oars and no wind blowing and in all probability we had been carried down upon  Stroma  if an able man a Passenger had not taken ane Oar so that then there were Oars upon our Starboard side Hence in some places there is a swift and in others a soft running Tide which the Boatmen being well ac∣quainted with they will sometimes rest from their hard Labour and refresh themselves a little  In our passage we see the Currents  We see the currents of the Tides  before we en∣gage with them running like the Torrents of some great Rivers and in some places we will see the Wa∣ters smooth and rough round about the Reason where∣of I know not if it be not because of some Tides meeting there and as it were for some time quiescent in their Centre something like unto which I have ob∣served in the meeting of several Rivers in one place  In the Firth are several places remarkable for their danger As the  Wells of Swinna  The  Wells  of  Swinna  dangerous  whereof some are on the Eastside and others on the Westside of the Isle they are like unto WhirlePooles turning about with such a violence that if any Boat come nigh unto them  they will suck or draw it in  The Wells of Swinna are  Trocht adiustar à puero s  age  agitat  Geogra Blaevi  and then turneth it abou  until it be swallowed up but these Wells are onl  dangerous in a Calm and Seamen or Fishers to pr  ¦vent their danger thereby use when they come nea  them to cast in an Oar Barrel or such like thing o  which the Wells closing they safely pass over Th  Minister of the place told me that about years agoe there were two Fisherboats there who coming nig  the Wells the Men in the one Boat seing their dan¦ger one of these men thus afraid took hold of th  other Boat by them and both Boats were swallowed up One of the Ministers of  Zetland  told me ther  were three of these Boats it so falling out that h  passed the Firth the very day after they perished Ye  notwithstanding of these dangers the Fishers will no desist from fishing about these Wells for they observ  the nearer they come to them they have the Fishe  both greater better and more numerous so the Fish¦es draw the Men and the Wells draw both  Near to these Skerries before  Barwick  formerly mentioned are also or Wells called the  Wells o  Tiftala  And of  Tiftala  only dangerous in a Flood as the  Wells of Swin¦na  are in an Ebb these Wells as some do judge ar  caused by an Hiatus or Ga  in the Earth below Further I would offer this consideration that whereas all these Wells are nigh unto ragged Rocks con∣stantly beat upon by the Tides there may be some secre  conveyances of the Water into Cavernes at the bottom of the Rock from which they may pass into some other places where they rise again and that even in the same Firth tho such places be unknown as it is storied of many Rivers  How they come to whirle and be so dan∣gerous  which fall into and run many Miles below the Earth and come out again in other places But that which I judge to be more simple is that several Tides running upon the Rocks and thence returning and meeting with other Tides cause such a Whirle as we see behind Millwheels some of the water coming from and another part as it were appear∣ing  to return upon the Wheel which cause such a Whirle and no more doth the whirles in the Firth re∣  uire a Hiatus in the Earth or a subterraneous passage  h  n the whirles in the Mills water courses As for  heir swallowing up of Boats which are no more seen this doth not prove it for these Boats may be broken beneath the water upon Rocks or the like and the broken timber go to the Sea of which there is enough  ound cast a shoar upon these Isles But many things of  his nature are hidden to us and we can only give our Conjectures anent them  There is also in this Firth the  Swelchie of Stroma  a very dangerous place at the North end of the Isle of  Stroma  Swelchie  of  Sroma  where there is a meeting of several Tides which causeth the Water to rage and make a dreadful noise heard at some distance As likewise the Seabillows are  raised high and appear white and frothy very terrible to behold especially if any storm be lying on falling unto which all Passengers carefully labour to avoid As a Gentleman related to me that once he was in great danger the Seamen giving themselves over for lost tho three Miles from the  Swelchie  and that in a dead calm when within or pair of Butts to  Stroma  and tho so near Land they had been carried down in∣to and perished by this  Swelchie  as they all laid their accounts if the Lord had not speedily caused a Nor∣thern wind to blow whereby they got hold of  Stroma  There is another dangerous place at the South end of this Isle of  Stroma  Merry men of Mey  where also a great conflict of Wa∣ters called the  Merry men of Mey  so called from the house of  Mey  a Gentleman's dwelling in  Caithness  op∣posite to this Isle and called  Merry men  because of the leaping and danceing as it were of the waters there tho Mirth and Danceing be far from the minds of the Sea∣men and Passengers who shall be so unhappy as to fall in among them especially when any Sea is going  Seing from what hath been said this Firth is sovery dangerous to pass no wonder that the Mariners and  others be very careful to lay hold on the fittest occasio  for a safe Passage  Seamen observe the Tide in going over  which they find to be a little befo  the turning of the Tide when it is beginning to E  on the Shoare but the Flood is yet running in the Se  then they use to go off that so when they are or nigh unto the middle of the Firth the Tide ma  be upon the turn which causeth for some time a st  and quiet Sea as to the running of the Tides a  the Seamen are not so put to it in wrestling eith  against Flood or Ebb  Buchanan  speaking of the Seas and the rapid Tides elegantly expresseth him¦self  Duae sunt Tempestates quibus hae angustiae sunt supera  les aut cum aestuum relapsu cessante undarum conflictu ma  tranquillatur aut ub  pleno alveo aequot ad summum incr  ¦menti pervenit languescente utrinque vi illa quae undas co  citabat veluti receptui canente Oceano procellis vo  cesis pelagi commoti molibus se velut in sua Castra recipie  tibus  What wind most avourable  Any Wind they observe will take them over fro  Burwick  to  Caithness  if tided Right and the Win  not in S West or nigh to that point and so fro  Caithness  to  Burwick  if not in N East or nigh to it B  the N West Wind they call the  King of the Firth  n  only I judge because it will both take them from  Caith¦ness  to  Orkney  and from  Orkney  to  Caithness  but all because if it blow any thing it keepeth them up in a Ebb from falling into the  Wells of Swinna  the  Swelchie of Stroma  and the  Merry Men of Mey  By Tidin  right also they can come over by the help of Oars th  there be no Wind And at any time tho they observ  not the Tide they can pass from  Orkney  to

Caith∣ness  I shall therefore study to be the brie  upon  Caithness  as likewise seeing it is supposable th  it may be better known then any of the former being upon the same Continent with us What th  is to be said thereupon I shall dispatch and sum up  this one Chapter  Caithness  is the Northernmost Province or Shire  Scotland  Its Situa∣tion  having  Pightland Firth  whereby it is divid  from  Orkney  on the North the Entry to  Murray Fir  on the East  Sutherland  and  Stranaver  on the South at the  Deucatedonian Ocean  on the West It is from th  high Hill called the  Ord of Caithness  toward the South whereby it is divided from  Sutherland  to  Dungish Head  about Miles long and from  Thurso  on th  West side to  Wick  on the East side of the Countrey  Miles broad  As we were much in the dark about the Etymol  ¦gy of  Orkney  and  Zetland  The rea∣son of the Name  so no less are we here i  that of  Caithness  upon which  Blaw in his Geograph  giveth us this Notandum "That many Names  "places are something strange whose Original seem t  be neither  Scotish Irish Danish  or  Norvegian  But u  "known uncertain and most Ancient Such as  O  bister Loyibster Robaster Trumbuster  and Innumerabl  others  Blavi Ge∣ogra in Caith  Caterum Not Multa locorum Nomina peregrinu  quid sapere quorum origo neque Scoticum Hibernicum Danicum aut Norvegicum quid referant sed ignotae incert  vetustissimae originis videntur Qualia sunt  Orbiste  Lovibster Roboster Trumbuster  innumera ali  And seeing such Examples of Names which are of a  unknown Original as are given by the Historian d  end in  ster  I would add that the most of the Names  places in this Countrey do end in  ster  or  star  and  go  between and in  ster  or  star  and about in  as my Informer who had been for some time in  e Countrey did reckon them Of old  Sutherland  th the same Geographer was called  Cattey  and its  habitants  Catteigh  and so likewise was  Caithness  and  anaver  And in the Irish  Sutherland  to this day is  lled  Catey  and its Inhabitants  Catigh  So that  Cattey∣  ss  is no other then the Promontory or Cape of the  tes  or  Sutherland  which Promontory is stretched  t from the East or rather the North side saith  t Geographer of the Mountain of the  Ord  Blavi Geogra  Adeo ut  teyness nihil aliud sit quam Promontorium Cattae seu  therlandiae quod Promontorium a latere Ortentali montis  di praetenditur  These  Cattaei  are thought to be a Peo∣  e who arrived thither from  Germany  Who would  ve more of this may consult the abovementioned  uthor  Buchanan  will have it to be called  Caithness  ecause of its being Mountainous but I know not if  s Reason will hold for the Countries adjacent of  herland  and  Stranaver  are more Mountainous and  ere are few high Hills or Mountains in it except  t the South end thereof where it borders with  Suther∣  nd  but if it should be so called because it is the Ness  r Promontory of the Mountains the Land by North  ese Mountains falling lower and running out in a  romontory into the Sea I Judge it would hold bet∣  er and be said with greater reason  Boethius  also saith  at this Countrey of old was called  Cornana  but the  eason thereof he giveth not  The Earls of  Caithness  were among the Ancientest  Scotland  The Earl of  Caith∣ness  and in former times have been very potent in  his Corner as appears by the several old Castles and  laces of Strength which then they were in Possession  f but now their Memory is almost extinct The  te Earl  George  dying without Issue the Laird of  Glen∣  chy  now Earl of  BraidAtbin  Married the Dowager  who having Purchast the Earl's Estate the  parent Heir judging himself thereb  injured  gather together some of the Countrey People recover his Right but was Defeat by  G  n  c  From the Feild they went to the Bar and Debated  Matter there whereupon the Lords gave forth t  Sentence that  Glenorchy  should enjoy the Estate  the Heir should have the Honours and an Alim  allowed him by  Glenorchy  during his Life The H  having died about a Year ago the Heiress his Sis  Succeeds to the Honours and is in a very mean Con  ¦tion living in a place where the former Earls used keep their H  ucks So to this Ancient and Hono  ¦able Family of the Earls of  Caithness  there is almo  put in Holy Providence a Period and Close Th  who had four great Houses in this Countrey like P  ¦laces for Pleasure and Convenience and Castles f  Strength now in their Heirs enjoy none of them th  are Ruinous and one is Possessed by a Stranger  likewise there are several other Ruinous Houses to  seen here who have spewed out their Possessours  confirming that common Observation  That s  committed by the Inhabitants is as GunPowder lai  to the Foundations of their Houses which quickl  overturneth them when it pleaseth a Righteous Go  to fire the Train  The late Earls of the Name of  Sinclar  The late Earls of  Caithness  were of the Name o  Sinclar  of which Name also are many Gentlemen o  the Countrey who have bought considerable parts o  the Earl's Estate from the Earl of  BraidAlbin  Be¦fore the  Sinclars  the Earls were of the Name o  Shine  and befor them were the  Haralds  and before the  Haralds  were the  Ola's  as the Tradition goeth  concerning which and the manner of their Successio  and the Interruption made therein the Countrey talk several things which I shall not trouble my Reade  with Only I shall observe what is related by  Camb¦den  a Judicious Antiquary  That of old the Earls of  Caithness  were the same with the Earls of  Orkney  but at length were divided the Eldest Daughter of one  Mulisius  being given in Marriage to  William de  S  Claro vulgo Seincler  the Kings Pautler his Posterity had this Honour conferred on them of being Earls of  Caithness  The Country is pleasant and very Fertile  The Coun¦trey a∣bounds with Grass Corn  at¦tel Fishes so that here the cheapest Market it the World  abound∣ing with Grass and Corn hence Yearly there is a great quantity of Victual Exported as An  there were Bolls Embarked and taken out for which end it is much frequented by Barks from the Firth Clyde and other places for ordinarly when there is no scar∣city or dearth the Meal is sold here at or or at most Merks per Boll The Cattel and Fishes also are to be had very cheap as good Kine often in the Sham∣bles such as the Countrey doth afford for or shal  sterl  and sometimes they say for so that as I have heard some of the more intelligent Inhabitants observe that here is the cheapest Market in the World And the Gentlemen can live better upon Merks  Gentle∣men live well  then they can do in the South upon  per annum  Who may Improve their Stocks to as great if not a greater Advantage than in any other place in  Scotland  for they may save their Rents having within themselves what Provision is necessary for their Table and may sell much Store every Year what to the Inhabitants in the Countrey for their own use or for salting and sending Abroad and what to Drovers who take them South And it is observable that if any Buy a piece of Land only what is Arable is Accounted for as for what serveth for Pasture they use not to take nottice of tho upon that consideration they may value their Acres at a greater Rate In the way between  Thur∣so  and  Dunnot  we saw much low Ground overblown with sand for two Miles back from the Sea which formerly not many Years since was a pleasant Mea∣dow  Ten Pa∣rishes  here  There are Parishes in this Countrey of which can be served with Ministers not having the Irish Lan¦guage few of the People there speaking it but th  other five cannot be supplied otherwise then by Mi¦nisters understanding Irish in some of these Parishe  there being very few who have any knowledge of ou  Language  Many speak  Irish  and some of the Ministers are obliged t  preach both in English and Irish for the Edification of all some of the Parishes are very wide and populous which tends to the Increase of Ignorance among many the Ministers not being able to overtake thei  Work some Churches also are ruinous for when He  ¦ritours are not freinds to the Work of God or cannot agree among themselves as to the concerting of suit¦able Measures for putting or keeping things which concern the Parish in order it useth to go ill with Ministers as to their external Accomodation and with Churches as to their Repair  The prin∣cipal Towns  The two principal Towns in the Countrey are  Wick  and  Thurso Wick  is a Royal Burgh on the Eastside of the Countrey washen by the  German Ocean  at the Mouth of  Murray Firth  by the side of which run∣neth a small River at the mouth of the River there is a Harbour for Boats or Barks to ly in which they come into at full Sea but this Harbour is not so much frequen∣ted as another about a Mile to the NorthEast of  Wick  where they Judge the Boats do ly safer Opposite to  Wick  lyes Thurso at Miles distance on the Westside of the Countrey which tho it enjoy not the privi∣ledge of a Royal Burgh yet it is more populous then  Wick  and hath better buildings in it by the Eastside of the Town runneth a small River called the  Water of Thurso  In the Water of Thurso many good Sal∣mond tak∣en and how  They have the best Church in the Countrey well furnished and kept in good order  In the Water of  Thurso  there is good SalmondFi∣shing which they take two ways one is by Crues or Creels with crossed or barred doors going from the one side of the Water to the other so framed that they  suffer the Fishes to go in but not to go out out of which sometimes they will take several Horses burdens of Fish The other way they take them is by a Net where with they Fish a Pool which lyeth a little be∣low the Crues and is about a pair of buts in length They having spread the net upon the bank which is long enough to reach the breadth of the Water they go in with it and one Man on each side drawing it down the Pool it is followed with or Men going in a breast behind it with long staves or Poles in their hands wherewith they keep the net to the ground and loose it when any way entangled the Pool in some places will rise to the height of the breasts of the wa∣ders but there is no danger So they bring down the Net softly and warily to the mouth of an Enclo∣sure which they call a  Stem  into which the Fishes are driven where the Fishers standing with this larger Net others take a lesser Net and going therewith into the  Stem  catch the Fishes so enclosed that scarce one can escape for up the Water they cannot run because of the larger Net and neither down can they go be∣cause of the Stem or Stones laid together in form of a Wall We saw as we could conjecture at one draught upwards of good Salmonds taken and these who have this Fishing told us that Years ago they took at a draught and going through the Pool at the same time with the Net again they catched other which Salmond for the most part they salt in barrels and sends abroad It is also to be observed that the Salmond keep this Water of  Thurso  all the Year over and in the Winter Season in Frost and Snow if you break the ice they are to be had The Pool is but about half a Mile up the Water from  Thurso  There are several Waters or Rivers in the Coun∣trey as  Thurso Wick Dumbeth Rice Force  Several Waters here  and  Bera∣del  but they are all small and indeed there is no great River all the way from  Caïthness  till we come to  Ness  running by  Inverness  in  Murray  over which is a strong  Bridge lately built consisting of Arches which Rive  is remarkable for this that it never freezeth tho th  frost be most vehement yea if then vow bring a Horse unto the River  The River of Ness  the iceacles will melt at his feet in th  space of time that he is drinking the River cometh from a Loch called  Lochness  which also hath the same property or Miles to the West of  Inverness  Thi  River I make mention of tho not it  Caithness  it being the first considerable one having any thing of a strong and regular Bridge which we passed in our return  Some Trees  There are some Trees here but they are not so big as these which are further South even in  Sutherland▪  particularly upon the Water of  Beradel  there is a plea∣sant strath full of small wood And there is a Garden or Miles to the SouthWest of  Thurso  very plea∣sant and well furnished with fruit Trees much com∣mended by the Inhabitants  Rocks much fre∣quented by Fowls  The Rocks by the Coasts are much frequented by Fowls of various kinds as Eagles Hawks c such as in  Orkney  and  Zetland  of which Rocks there are long tracts for whereas in  Sutherland Ros    and  Murray  the Sea for the most part is bound  d with the sand here it is bounded with the Rocks which it washeth and beat∣eth on and that almost round  Caithness  from the  Ord  to  Dungisbey Head  on the East and so by  Dunnot Head  and  Hoburn Head  to  Stranaver  on the West except a few Creeks or Bays several of which are very conve∣nient for Anchoring especially in  Screbister Bay  a little to the North West of  Thurso  there is good Anchoring ground where Ships may safely ride without the fear of hazard by Wind or Tide the Capes of Land there making a still Sea and defending the Ships which as it were flee into their Arms from raging and angry  Pightland Firth  There are here also some Rocks lying a little off the Land from which they are broken and dis∣joyned which they call  Clets  the same with the  Holms  in  Orkney  and  Zetland  these Clets are almost covered with SeaFowls One way they take these Fowls is  pleasant tho with great danger They take a Line  One way they take the Fowls▪  on the end of which they fasten some FishHooks  ove the hooks there is also a Pock fastened and so from  e top of the Rock they let down the Line thus fur∣  shed with Pock and hooks striking the heads of the  oung Fowls in their Nests with the Pock upon which  e Fowls do all gape and cry as if it were their Dame  oming with meat to them and so lifting the Line they  t the hooks fall into their mouths which taking hold the Fowls they become their prey  There are likewise several Caves going from the  a within the Rocks  Caves  in which the waves make a  eadful noise such Caves we had occasion to take no∣  e of in our discourse upon  Orkney  and  Zetland  Especially there is a kind of Fowls called  Snowflects  which resort to this Countrey in great numbers in  Fe∣  nary  they are about the bigness of a Sparrow  Fowls called Snow∣flects  but ex∣  eding fat and delicious they flee in flocks thousands  them together many of which the Inhabitants do  ll and make use of They use to go away in  April  d are thought to come from the West  Highlands  hey have also a great plenty of Moorfowls Plovers  much if not more then in any place of  Scotland  The industry of the Gentlemen here is to be much  ommended for altho from  Wick  to  Dumbeth  which is  Miles long there be no Harbour or Bay  The Gent∣lement's Industry commen∣dable  but a con∣  nued tract of ragged hard and Ironlike Rocks wash∣  by the Sea yet there are several Harbours forced  here by Art tho denied by Nature and passages in ma∣ny places like steps of stairs made from the top of the  ock to the bottom where their FishBoats do ly and  y these passages do bring their Fishes up to the top of  e Rocks where they salt and dry them in Houses  ade for the purpose whereby great gain doth redound  the Owners some making as much by their Fishes  they do by their LandRent  As in  Orkney  and  Zetland  there were several old  happels which the superstitious Zealots did frequent  Supersti∣tions  so is it likewise in  Caithness  the Ministers told me the is one in  Dunnot Parish  beside which there are abo  Heaps of Stones which the People coming to ta  with them a Stone and throw it into the Heap bo  ¦ing themselves also thereunto Nigh to it likewise there is a Loch called  St John's Loch  concerning which there goes a fabulous Tradition that on  St Stephen Day  there was a pleasant Meadow in that place whe  now the Loch is and on  St John's Day  therafter was turned into this Loch There is also another i  the Parish of  Rhae  to which some do take their Chil¦dren if they be in distress and make Graves at th  side of one another laying the Child between them and so they trie if the Child will recover but the wa  how they know  Tales su∣persti∣tiones lu∣dicras re∣citate est refutare  I forbear to mention But they sa  there is a Chappel in the Parish of  Konnesbie  the Nor¦thermost Parish of all this Countrey opposite to  Ork¦ney  which is yet more frequented then any of the for¦mer which some wildly superstitious frequent on som  Day about Candlemass going about it on their bar  knees and thence going to a Water they cast some  it in handfuls over their heads and from the Water t  an Alehouse where they use to fill themselves drunk▪ And when going to these or at them they can scarce even tho threatened be prevailed with to speak T  which hellish Rites some are so addicted that the Mini¦sters judge it next to impossible to get them weane  and brought there from But the vigilancy and pains o  Ministers especially of late hath through the Blessing o  God not been altogether without success Which ol  Chappels both here and in  Orkney  and  Zetland  I think the Government should cause to be rased which might prove as the taking away of the Nest Egg  The House of  Thurso by East  The  Earls of Caithness  as hinted at before had seve∣ral strong and convenient dwellings One about a short  half Mile from  Thurso  called  Thurso by East  now rui∣nous it hath been built in the form of a Court and the Gates have been decored with cut stone Work and  the Gardens Avenues and office Houses have been  nform to the splendour of the House An honest Countrey Man observing the many great sins that had been committed about that House is said to have pre∣  cted to one of the late Earls its ruine and desolation saying "That the Cup of sin was filling and this House would shortly become a den of Dragons  using the Scripture phrase  and seeing there are no such Crea∣tures among us it shall be of Foxes And according∣  it was observed that a Fox haunted it when ruinous few Years after which stayed there till about or Years ago when a part of the House was repaired This I had from one of the Ministers of the Countrey and another Minister told me that before he bore this character he frequently shot Rabbets there within the Walls of the House  There are also other four Castles upon one Bay  Castle Sin∣clar and Girnego  on  e East side of the Countrey nigh to  Wick  which be∣longed to these Earls The Bay is called  RiceBay  and  or Miles broad the entry whereof is to the East  t dangerous for Ships to come into because of the many blind Rocks that ly therein upon the South side of the Bay next to Wick have been strong Castles  ined to one another by a DrawBridge called  Castle  inclar  and  Girnego  the former hath been the strongest House but the latter they ordinarly had their dwelling in their situation is upon a Rock disjoined from the Land  vironed for the most part with the Sea to which Castles from the Land they passed also by a Bridge which was drawn up every night whence there was no access to them I found the year of God upon the Lintel of a window in  CastleSinclar  to be which hath been  e year wherein this Castle was built or at least re∣paired Some account these two Castles to be but one because of their vicinity They say there was much  committed here as Drunkenness Uncleanness  c  or which a Righteous God hath turned them into a  ainous heap Opposite to  Castle Sinclar  and  Girnego  on the other side of the Bay is  Kice  another Castle  Castles of  Kice Be∣radel and Hakergil  also ruinous On the West side of the Bay is the Ca  of  Hakergil  a strong house at present possessed by Gentleman who hath a great interest in the Counti  but is not descended of the Family of  Caithness  Th  are also the ruines of the old Castle of  Beradel  to be se  situated on a Rock near to the Sea at the Mouth of River of that name to which also they have pass from the Land by a Drawbridge Such naturally stro  ▪ Situations for their Houses they sought out of old t  they might be the more secure and safe from all v  ¦lence Nature as well as Art contributing to their for¦tification  A Bishop Murdered of old  About a short half Mile to the West of  Thuiso  a  the ruines of an old Castle where the Bishop in the times of Popery is said to have had his Residence par¦ticularly there was one  Adam  said to b  the last Bishop who lived in that house who having greatly oppre  ¦ed the People by his rigorous exacting of the Tith  the People complained thereof to the Earl who said in passion to have Answered them  Go and see  him and Sup him too if you please  Whereupon they we  to the Bishops Lodging and apprehended him a  setting his house on Fire they actually boiled hi  and supped off the Broth Which being known  ¦quiry was made for the barbarous Actours of this Tra¦gedy and they being apprehended were put to death so suffering condign punishment for this horrid Villa¦ny And this Earl is not the only great Person who hath given forth an inconsiderate sentence upon which barbarous and inhumane Actions have ensued  Bu¦chanan  writeth this to have been about the year  in the days of  Alexand  d  King of Scots  and saith only  That they having killed the Monk who attended his and his Servant  Buchan Hist in vitam Alex    they wounded himself and draw¦ing him to the Kitchin they set the house on Fire about him  A little to the West of this is the house of  Screbister  the residence of the late Bishops  where I think their Lordships had but a mean acco∣modation The Revenues of the Bishoprick here are among the smallest in  Scotland  The Re∣venues of the Bi∣shoprick small  which they report thus came to pass One of the Bishops at the Refor∣mation sold the Churches Revenues far below their va∣lue some say at  shill Scot  per  Boll to the Earl know∣ing that but for a short time he could enjoy the same  There is a Hill in the Parish of  Wick  called  Stonyhill  the Reason of which denomination is said to be this  Stony Hill  In the days of  William King of Scots  as  Buchan  hath it there was one  Harald Earl of Orkney and Caith∣ness  who being offended at the Bishop as having insi∣nuared something to the King against him apprehen∣ded the Bishop cutting out his Tongue and putting out his Eyes which being represented to the King he sent his Forces into  Caithness  and having defeat the Earl in several Engagements the Earl fleeing was pursued and being apprehended his eyes were first put out and then he was hanged and all his Male Children were emasculated upon this Hill which ever since hath been called  Stonyhill  They told us  Several Stones set set up for Monu∣ments  there are several high great Stones set up through the Countrey and that ordinarily on Hills about which are the Rubbish of other Stones which have served for some end there and probably have been places of Pagan Worship as we observed upon  Orkney  in the Parish of  Bower  as we passed we saw an Artificial Mount ditched about of a small cir∣cumference it is like for the same purpose They have likewise the Tradition of some Picts houses which have been here of old the rubbish wherof is yet to be seen in the Parish of  Latheran  as a Gentle∣man well acquainted with the Countrey did inform me  In the Parish of  Latheran  we saw the Foundation of a House said to be laid by a Bastard Son of the  Earl of Caithness  but never perfected  Founda∣tion of a House laid but not perfected  it is founded upon a rising ground nigh to the Sea where there is a fair prospect of  Murray  where it is reported the Gentle∣man had his Mistress who intended to build it there  that so she might have a view of the house from  Mu  ¦ray  and he at the House might see  Murray  Dunnot Head  Dunnot Head  stretching out into  Pightland Firt  is about a Mile in breadth and Miles in circumf  ¦rence in it are several Lochs and some good pastu  for Cattel but no Inhabitants in it are to be ha  good Millstones and it is thought there is a Lead Mine there In several places in the parish of  Dunn  there will no Ratts live and if Earth be brought ou  thence to other places molested by them they will b  quickly gone  The  Ord  of  Caith∣ness  The  Ord  which divideth  Caithness  from  Sutherland  is a high Mountain as the name  Ord  which in Iris  signifieth an  height  doth imply down which ou  way from  Caithness  to  Sutherland  doth ly the Road i  but narrow and the descent steep and if any stumble thereupon they are in hazard of falling down a preci¦pice into the Sea at the bottom of the Rock which is is very terrible to behold but who pass it for the more security use to lead their Horses to the foot of the Hill which is about a short Mile in length and no other way there is from  Sutherland  to  Caithness  or from  Caith∣ness  to  Sutherland  but this except we go Miles about but it might be made broader and safer with small expence  Signs of Rain and drought  It is observed in  Caithness  as an infallible sign almost when they see a Mist or Cloud lying down upon the foot of the Hills that then a drought will follow but if such a Mist or Cloud be on the top thereof they thence certainly conclude there will be Rain that day  A Loch wherein is a House built by Robbers  In the Parish of  Halkirk  there is a Loch as there are several Lochs in the Countrey within which Loch are the ruines of an old house built they say by Robbers that they might be the more safe and se∣cure from the fears of being apprehended That which is most observable concerning this House is that there is not one foot of more ground then what is within  the circumference of the Foundation and upon which it standeth hence either the Water of the Loch hath washen away the prominent Rock if there hath been any through wasting time or if there was no part of the Rock without the circumference of the Foundation it is wonderful to consider how so nigh to the water the Foundation hath been got laid the Water about the House being of a considerable depth and the Ex∣treme parts of the Rock upon which the Foundation standeth not to give way and fail under the weight of the building which those who have seen this House are surprised at Upon the Loch they have Boats which come closs to the Walls of the House for the taking of Fowls of divers kinds as Maws Herons  c  seve∣ral thousands of which do frequent it having their Nests in the ruinous Walls  APPENDIX  HAving finished and brought to some Issue this Task  Improve∣ment  in Communicating my Remarks upon these remote Northern places I shall now wind up all in some breif Animadversions upon the whole in in order to a practical Improvement  And st We would seriously consider and ponder the wonderful Mercy and Grace of our GOD  Is    in sending the Gospel to the Isles afar off that these Gentiles who have not formerly heard of His Fame nor seen his Glory should have the same declared among them That through the tender Mercy of our God  Luk    the Day 'spring from on high hath visited and given light to us who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death He hath not dealt so with every Nation with every Isle the greatest part of which are immersed and  suffered to ly in the thick darkness of Paganism V  were among the first of the Nations in these North  parts of the World to whom was sent the Word of th  Salvation and according to the Computation o  e  our  King Donald  was the first Crowned Head in t  World that bowed to him who hath on his thigh th  name written  King of Kings and Lord of Lords  O  of Zion hath gone forth the Law and the Word of th  Lord from Jerusalem and hath travelled some thou¦sands of Miles Northward to Britain and the Isle thereto belonging Hence those places of our highly an  early favoured Isle unaccessible to the valour of the Ro¦man Legions  Tertull  became subject to Christ  Britanno¦rum loca Romanis inaccessa  Is    Christo subdita sunt  O what Reason have we then to listen to the Evangelica  Prophets Cali  Sing unto the Lord a new song and hi  Praise from the end of the Earth Ye that go down to the Sea and all that is therein the Isles and the Inha∣bitants thereof Let them give Glory unto the Lord and declare his Praise in the Islands  That which may heighten the sense of this distin∣guishing Mercy and Love is that we enjoy this Gospel in as great if not greater purity then any Nation un∣der Heaven we have it set forth in its native simplicity without the Painting and gaudie dress of humane In∣ventions  Assembly conveened at  Edinb  An  Sess  Calderw Hist  which our King James V  I in his first and better Days was not ashamed to declare in open As∣sembly The Ancient Government of our Church is restored and her Assemblies allowed to sit under the shadow of lawful Authority by one of which we were appointed to visite those Northern Isles and report un∣to them at their next Annual Meeting how matters relating to the Kingdom of Christ do stand in those remote Corners that so proper Methods may be con∣certed and taken by the delegated Representatives of this National Church for promoting the Spiritual and Eternal Welfare of the Inhabitants  Tho we enjoy the clear Light of the glorious Gospel  Christ yet are there many evils from which we are  purged until this Day For beside the abounding  andals breaking out to the Dishonour of God the  eproach of Religion and the Grief of the Godly  ere are many Superstitious Fopperies Charms Heath∣  ish and Popish Rites to which some especially in  ose Isles are so much addicted that it proves a most difficult peice of Work to the most zealous Ministers  get them reformed  As all should have it much upon their hearts that  ere should be any such dreadful evils now remaining  all invested with Authority Civil or Ecclesiastick  t called to employ their utmost endeavours for the  ter ext  rpation of all Idolatrous Monuments and rasing  old Chappels so much abused and that conform to  ct of Assembly The Government commanding the Magistrates of these respective bounds so to do

Malice and  btilty of that early and grand Enemie of Man's Sal∣  tion labouring to keep some footing in these Isles so be his deadly wound might be healed which the  eaching of the Gospel the Rod of Gods Power hath  ven him  That which gives great advantage to Satan is the  ameful Ignorance that abounds in this Day of Gos∣pelLight this is to him an useful Handle whereby  keeps his Subjects under his Empire in his Hellish  amnable Service for while this Vail is on the eye  the Soul poor People are not capable of discerning  hat is right or wrong and so are led hoodwinkt to  ell "Tenebrae sunt Visus impeditivae Gressus pro∣hibitivae Casus inductivae c This black Vail  aweth the Screen round about the Soul    Cor    whence nei∣  er Sin nor Misery are felt or seen They are dead  the Pythagoreans and Platonists used to place a  Coffin in the room of their outcast Scholars And t  Jews used to say  A dead Carcase is better than a Disc  void of Wisdom and Knowledge  And no wonder it be in such dark Corners where there are so few Schools a Seminaries of Learning No wonder the Enemie s  his tares where there is not sown the seed of Kno  ¦ledge And where not a competency of Knowled  there can be no Obedience to nor Love of God or  Ways  Ut Lux est vitae Directrix sic Vehiculum  loris  Blessed are they then who are priviledged with t  Means of Knowledge Schools for the Education their Youth and to whom the doors of the Sanctua  stand open from time to time where God by his M  ¦nisters teacheth Knowledge to those who enquire his Mouth Happy they who know and improve the Mercy the joyful Sound given by the SilverTrumpe  of the Gospel every Lord'sDay who do receive t  Truth in Love And so must we account for our Me  ¦cy if from the heart we have believed and obeyed t  Gospel  Beside the Book of Grace giving light to the Chur  of Christ we have also the large expanded Book  the Creation whose lines are gone out through all t  Earth whence we may spell the Being of a God  Wisdom Goodness and Power The Heavens decla  his Glory and the Firmament sheweth his hand Work the various Tides the Ebbing and the Flowi  Sea bounded by the Sand and Rocks which it da  beateth on the Fowls of the Air and Fishes of the S  each frequenting their proper habitation do all Pr  ¦claim aloud the Glory of him who created them  Almighty Power preserving them in their beautiful a  wonderful order and his Infinite Wisdom governi  and directing them to their several ends to which th  are by him appointed  Tho so many objects do occur to the diligent Obse  ¦ers of the Works of Creation and Providence yet w  an by the short Cordage of their Reason fathom those depths so as to give a satisfying account thereof Still they may rather be the subject of our Admiration notwith∣standing of all the Essays the ingenious and sedulous Enquirers into the Mysteries and Secrets of Nature have either of old or of late obliged and gratified the World with Whereupon the humble Saint is ready to express himself with the Wise Man  I am more bru∣tish then any Man  Prov    and have not the understanding of a Man  and say  Such things are too wonderful for me yea and I know them not  To conclude    Cor    We see now but through a glass dark∣ly we know only in part but when that which is per∣fect is come then that which is in part shall be done away And this also we may apply to the Works of Creation Most happy we if after all our Travels Voyages and Labours of whatever kind we arrive at that place of perfection where the Militant State of the Church shall be changed into that of a Triumphant where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary be at rest When tears shall be wiped from the eyes sorrow and sighing shall flee away When that desirable Day shall break and all shadows be gone When Satan shall be bruised under our feet and Death and all its black Retinue be swallowed up in Life and Victory When no more Darkness in the Understanding Perverse∣ness in the Will Disorder in the Aflections or sense of Guilt in the Conscience When our Duty shall be Praise our Grace a burning Love even to a bodily present Christ and our Work shall be to follow the Lamb whi∣  hersoever he goeth and so be for ever with the Lord  FINIS
