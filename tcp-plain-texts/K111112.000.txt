 AN ELEGY ON A PILE OF RUINS  BY J CUNNINGHAM  ASPICE MURORUM MOLES PRAERUPTAQUE SAXA  LONDON  Printed for H PAYNE and W CROPLEY at Dryden'sHead in PaterNosterRow MDCCLXI  Price Sixpence  AN ELEGY ON A PILE OF RUINS    I  N the full prospect yonder hill commands  O'er forests fields and vernalcoated plains  The vestige of an ancient abbey stands  Close by a ruin'd castle's rude remains  II  Half buried there lie many a broken bust  And obelisk and urn o'erthrown by TIME  And many a cherub here descends in dust  From the rent roof and portico sublime  III  The rivulets oft frighted at the sound  Of fragments tumbling from the tow'rs on high  Plunge to their source in secret caves profound  Leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry  IV  Where rev'rend shrines in Gothic grandeur stood  The nettle or the noxious nightshade spreads  And ashlings wafted from the neighb'ring wood  Through the worn turrets wave their trembling heads  V  There Contemplation to the crowd unknown  Her attitude compos'd and aspect sweet  Sits musing on a monumental stone  And points to the MEMENTO at her feet  VI  Soon as sage ev'ning check'd day's sunny pride  I left the mantling shade in moral mood  And seated by the maid's sequester'd side  Thus sigh'd the mould'ring ruins as I view'd  VII  Inexorably calm with silent pace  Here TIME has pass'dWhat ruin marks his way  This pile now crumbling o'er its hallow'd base  Turn'd not his step nor could his course delay  VIII  Religion rais'd her supplicating eyes  In vain and Melody her song sublime  In vain Philosophy with maxims wise  Would touch the cold unfeeling heart of TIME  IX  Yet the hoar tyrant tho' not mov'd to spare  Relented when he struck its finish'd pride  And partly the rude ravage to repair  The tott'ring tow'rs with twisted Ivy tied  X  How solemn is the cell o'ergrown with moss  That terminates the view yon cloister'd way  In the crush'd wall a timecorroded cross  Religion like stands mould'ring in decay  XI  Where the mild sun through saintencypher'd glass  Illum'd with mellow light that brownbrow'd isle  Many rapt hours might Meditation pass  Slow moving 'twixt the pillars of the pile  XII  And Piety with mysticmeaning beads  Bowing to saints on ev'ry side inurn'd  Trod oft the solitary path that leads  Where now the sacred altar lies o'erturn'd  XIII  Through the grey grove between those with'ring trees  'Mongst a rude group of monuments appears  A marbleimag'd matron on her knees  Half wasted like a Niobe in tears  XIV  Low levell'd in the dust her darling's laid  Death pity'd not the pride of youthful bloom  Nor could maternal piety dissuade  Or soften the fell tyrant of the tomb  XV  The relicks of a mitred saint may rest  Where mould'ring in the niche his statue stands  Now nameless as the crowd that kiss'd his vest  And crav'd the benediction of his hands  XVI  Near the brown arch redoubling yonder gloom  The bones of an illustrious Chieftain lie  As trac'd upon the timeunletter'd tomb  The trophies of a broken fame imply  XVII  Ah what avails that o'er the vassal plain  His rights and rich demesnes extended wide  That honour and her knights compos'd his train  And chivalry stood marshall'd by his side  XVIII  Tho' to the clouds his castle seem'd to climb  And frown'd defiance on the desp'rate foe  Tho' deem'd invincible the conqueror TIME  Levell'd the fabrick as the founder low  XIX  Where the light lyre gave many a soft'ning sound  Ravens and rooks the birds of discord dwell  And where Society sat sweetly crown'd  Eternal Solitude has fix'd her cell  XX  The lizard and the lazy lurking bat  Inhabit now perhaps the painted room  Where the sage matron and her maidens sat  Sweetsinging at the silverworking loom  XXI  The traveller's bewilder'd on a waste  And the rude winds incessant seem to roar  Where in his groves with arching arbours grac'd  Young lovers often sigh'd in days of yore  XXII  His aqueducts that led the limpid tide  To pure canals a chrystal cool supply  In the deep dust their barren beauties hide  TIME'S thirst unquenchable has drain'd them dry  XXIII  Tho' his rich hours in revelry were spent  With Comus and the laughterloving crew  And the sweet brow of Beauty still unbent  Brighten'd his fleecy moments as they flew  XXIV  Fleet are the fleecy moments fly they must  Not to be stay'd by masque or midnight roar  Nor shall a pulse amongst that mould'ring dust  Beat wanton at the smiles of Beauty more  XXV  Can the deep statesman skill'd in great design  Protract but for a day precarious breath  Or the tun'd follower of the sacred Nine  Sooth with his melody insatiate Death  XXVI  NoTho' the palace bar her golden gate  Or monarchs plant ten thousand guards around  Unerring and unseen the shaft of fate  Strikes the devoted victim to the ground  XXVII  What then avails Ambition's wide stretch'd wing  The Schoolman's page or pride of Beauty's bloom  The crapeclad hermit and the richrob'd king  Levell'd lie mix'd promiscuous in the tomb  XXVIII  The Macedonian monarch wise and good  Bade when the morning's rosy reign began  Courtiers should call as round his couch they stood  "PHILIP remember thou'rt no more than man  XXIX  "Tho' glory spread thy name from pole to pole  "Tho' thou art merciful and brave and just  "PHILIP reflect thou'rt posting to the goal  "Where mortals mix in undistinguish'd dust"  XXX  So SALADIN for arts and arms renown'd  Egypt and Syria's wide domains subdu'd  Returning with imperial triumphs crown'd  Sigh'd when the perishable pomp he view'd  XXXI  And as he rode high in his regal car  In all the purple pride of conquest drest  Conspicuous o'er the trophies gain'd in war  Plac'd pendent on a spear his burial vest  XXXII  While thus the herald cry'd"This son of pow'r  "This SALADIN to whom the nations bow'd  "May in the space of one revolving hour  "Boast of no other spoil but yonder shroud"  XXXIII  Search where Ambition rag'd with rigour steel'd  Where Slaughter like the rapid lightning ran  And say while mem'ry weeps the bloodstain'd field  Where lies the chief and where the common man  XXXIV  Vain are the pyramids and motto'd stones  And monumental trophies rais'd on high  For TIME confounds them with the crumbling bones  That mix'd in hasty graves unnotic'd lie  XXXV  Rests not beneath the turf the peasant's head  Soft as the lord's beneath the labour'd tomb  Or sleeps one colder in his close clay bed  Than t'other in the wide vault'sdreary womb  XXXVI  Hither let LUXURY lead her looserob'd train  Here flutter PRIDE on purplepainted wings  And from the moral prospect learnhow vain  The wish that sighs for sublunary things  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for H PAYNE and W CROPLEY at Dryden'sHead in PaternosterRow  I ALMORAN
