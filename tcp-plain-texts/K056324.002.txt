himParliament meetsProceedings of both houses  Observations  WILLIAM had obtained the crown through the folly of his predecessor He was now in danger of losing it by his own negligence Disappointments in their views had estranged from him the minds of the Whigs He disgusted the Tories with the coldness of his manner even when he distinguished them most with his favour The dissolution of the conventionparliament had diminished  the influence of the former to a degree that offended their pride They saw a Prince who had ascended the throne upon their own principles throwing himself into the hands of their political opponents from an avowed affection for those prerogatives which he was called to circumscribe The same conduct which deprived the King of the attachment of his first friends in England destroyed his interest with the party which had accomplished the revolution in Scotland In both kingdoms the seeds of discontent had been sown with a lavish hand and they gradually rose to maturity in the progress of events The people in general inflamed by disappointment misled by designing men or from levity fond of change began to show a manifest dislike to the behaviour of the King and the measures of the crown They became jealous of foreigners They complained of an expensive war where victory itself could produce no advantage to Britain They murmured against a standing army They repined at the little use made of the navy the great and natural bulwark of England  Discontents  Though the enemies of William exaggerated his mismanagements it must be allowed that men who judged of causes by events had just reason to complain The expences of England from the landing of the Prince of Orange on the fith of November to the twentyninth of September had amounted to near eighteen millions  MS Journals passim  Besides great arrears were owing to the army in Ireland the navy was destitute of stores and the ships were out of repair The service done in the intermediate time exclusive of the change made in the person of the Monarch was far from being adequate to that enormous sum The war in Ireland had been at first strangely neglected It was afterwards prosecuted with little judgment and it terminated in no honour The inhabitants of a few parishes in the Highlands of Scotland without any aid from abroad and destitute of the means of war at home remained in arms against the King for more than two years They had once totally defeated his army in the field The checks which  they had received were neither splendid nor decisive and he owed the pacification which ensued to the influence of his rival and his own money  MS  and not to the terror of his power England had been in the mean time wounded in her pride Her fleet had been twice defeated Her enemy rode in triumph in the channel Her coasts were insulted She was left naked of troops and exposed to invasion  Nottingham to William    Secret intrigues  But William ought not in common fairness to be blamed for all these misfortunes He reigned over a divided people His title was disputed by one party He lost the other by not yielding to their claims upon his exclusive favour His rival in the mean time supported by a powerful Monarch either maintained war against him within his kingdoms or hovered over the coast with threatened invasions Deprived by his unhappy manner and avowed attachment to foreigners of the affection of the English he had no friends among his servants His councils were betrayed his orders neglected his person hated his authority despised  Intell from England MS  His only safety lay ultimately in the folly of his enemies and that invincible aversion to the French nation which the people of England had derived from their ancestors James had scarce landed in France when many of those by whose desertion he had lost his throne began secretly to favour his return Men who apparently had the chief hand in the revolution admitted his agents into conferences and encouraged their hopes  Rcresby  The unprepared state of France in the beginning of the year rendering an immediate invasion of England impracticable James contrary to his own opinion  Mem to Lewis MS  was induced to sail to Ireland He knew that it was impossible to hold that exhausted kingdom against the wealth and power of the English nation To render his rival uneasy in the possession of his throne and to furnish France with an opportunity of aiding him with effect in England was all that he expected from his expedition  Ibid    with the Whigs  While James was on the worst terms with his favourite sect the Catholics of Ireland William by the coldness of his manner and his exertion of the prerogative lost his influence with the Whigs in England and Scotland Discontented friends are frequently the most dangerous enemies A plot was formed in Scotland by the Presbyterians in favour of James Many of the Whigs in England were privy to a conspiracy which threatened the subversion of their former principles In both kingdoms those inferior agents of the party who had ruined the late King were now busy in procuring his restoration Sir John Cochran Ferguson Wildman engaged themselves deeply with James  Caermarthen to William June  The leaders of the party though they had not avowedly espoused the cause of that Prince became very indifferent concerning the fate of William The very secrets of the cabinet were said to have been betrayed by the Earl of Monmouth to Wildman and by the latter to the late King  Mary to William  The Duke of Bolton the Marquis of Winchester the Earl of Devonshire the Lord Montague were suspected  Caermarthen to William  The party in general made no secret of their disappointment in the Prince whom they had raised to the throne Those who came over with him from Holland and such as first joined him on his arrival hated his person and his government the most  Dalrymple's Appen Stuartpapers  James gains many friends  The retreat of James from Ireland though unadvised precipitate and weak neither lessened his influence nor increased the interest of William The Tories urged by their principles favoured the former The Whigs swayed by their resentment still contitinued adverse to the latter The agents of James were in the mean time extremely active The Colonels Bulkely and Sackville sounded the Marquis of Halifax and the Lord Godolphin The Earl of Marlborough inflamed by recent injuries from William and perhaps remembering his former obligations to James began as shall hereafter appear to correspond  with the latter Admiral Russel disappointed in his own private views as well as in his public expectations from William entered into the cabals in favour of the late King The Marquis of Caermarthen in all his avowed zeal for the revolution listened in secret to proposals for the restoration of James  Dalrymple's Appen and MS  While the great offered their service to the late King that Prince neglected not to support his interest with conspiracies among the inferior ranks He corresponded with Ferguson He informed him of his intentions He asked his advice  Instructions to G H MS  A party was formed in the city in his favour The Tower was to have been surprized The guards were to be attacked on the first news of his landing The persons of William and Mary were to be seized  Ibid    Their views  The affairs of James wore a like favourable aspect in Scotland toward the end of the preceding year The cessation of arms made by Breadalbin with the Highlanders had been begun and finished by his consent His firm friend the Earl of Arran had promised  "body for body"  to use his own expression for the Earl of Argyle and the Marquis of Athol The Highlanders were again prepared to take the field Ten thousand men under the Duke of Berwick and the Earl of Dumbarton were to have been sent to Scotland The Marquis of Athol the Earls of Argyle and Home were to have received commissions as lieutenantgenerals from James The intrigues of James extended in England to the projected measures of parliament and even to the very appointment of William's servants The delay at first in granting the supply the facility with which it was afterwards obtained proceeded from the secret machinations of the late King's friends Some of them wished to leave the kingdom naked to an invasion by refusing money Others to vote the excise that their old master might enjoy the benefit without the odium of that unpopular tax Under the mask of patriotism they proposed to attack his enemies The Bishops of Salisbury  and St Asaph were to be impeached for persuading the clergy to take the oaths to William as a conqueror The Marquis of Caermarthen though he might not obstruct a restoration was not from his temporizing character to be trusted He was therefore to be terrified from office by an impeachment for declaring that no King could reign in England as long as the act of  habeas corpus  should remain in force The choice of his successor as minister was left to James and the contest for preference lay between the Marquis of Halifax and the Earl of Rochester  Ferguson's Memorial MS Oct  To keep alive the spirit of discontent in the kingdom Ferguson employed for King James that very private press with which he had some years before so much annoyed the Duke of York  Ibid    Correspondence of Marlborough and Russel  Though the Whigs by their leaders and the most of the Tories in their own names had made engagements with the late King he relied chiefly upon Marlborough and Russel Marlborough had asked in the most abject terms and obtained forgiveness for his former conduct from James and his Queen  Jan th  He even became an agent for that Prince He gained the Earl of Shrewsbury He tampered with Caermarthen He promised to bring back the Princess of Denmark to her duty to her father  May th  He undertook in some degree for the army He requested James to invade England with twenty thousand men Though he was not trusted by James he was perhaps sincere in his professions and he effected what he promised The Princess of Denmark gained by his solicitations warmed with a returning affection for her father or urged by resentment for personal injuries received from William and her sister made her peace with the late King She wrote to him a letter full of contrition  Dec th  She asked his forgiveness and promised to join him whenever he should land in England  Dec  Marlborough judging it vain to corrupt the captains of men of war as they durst not communicate the secret to the sailors was the person who advised James to  accept of the services of Russel  Marlborough's Message MS James II  To avoid an action with the French fleet should they fall in his way would have been impossible But it always was in the admiral's power to carry the fleet from the course held by the enemy under the specious pretence of orders The conspiracy was so great and general that William seemed to have no friend to apprize him of his danger Though he dismissed the earl of Marlborough from all his employments in the month of January though he disgraced and deprived of her guards the Princess of Denmark his resentment seems to have rather proceeded from a renewal of private quarrels than from any discovery of their secret negociations with the court of St Germains  Intrigues of James in England  James himself had taken all the precautions which prudence or the advice of his friends could suggest to render his return agreeable to the nation He endeavoured to awaken the feelings of his former subjects with a detail of the injustice of his rival and his own misfortunes He hoped to rouze their resentment by representing in a strong light their grievances He dwelt in his proposed declaration on the tyranny of foreigners He reminded the people of the enormous expences of government the weight of taxes the profusion of William his glaring partiality to his countrymen the Dutch He yielded to all the requisitions of the Whigs in favour of the subject He satisfied the church of England with regard to religion The nonjurors were his determined friends The clergy who had taken the oaths offered to return to their allegiance and they were with chearfulness received To satisfy the world that the Protestant religion was in no danger five hundred clergymen had engaged to join the late King upon his landing and to attend him in his progress to preach to the people The deprived bishops the most of those prelates who had temporized with William by taking the oaths were busy in inculcating upon the inferior clergy the propriety of restoring  James while they at the same time assured that Prince of their zeal and fidelity  Stuart papers    Project of an invasion  Encouraged by favourable accounts from Britain and eager to turn the scale of the war by placing that kingdom in the hands of a friend Lewis the Fourteenth began to think seriously of an invasion James possessed of his native subjects an army almost equal to the purpose of the expedition The transports which had carried to Ireland five thousand French in the year had brought back to France as many Irish The English government had been at the expence of sending fourteen thousand more troops to James after the capitulation of Limeric Lewis promised to transport to Britain ten thousand of this army with a like number of French troops under the convoy of his whole fleet early in the year He began in the month of January to equip squadrons of men of war at Toulon Brest Rochfort and PortLewis An embargo was laid upon all merchantmen All privateers were recalled to man the fleet An army under the Mareschal de Bellefons filed off toward the coast of Normandy Transports were prepared James had concerted his measures with his friends in England He had settled his concessions to the nation To secure the Earl of Marlborough already in disgrace from the further resentment of William he agreed at his own request to except that nobleman from pardon in his projected declaration to his people  Stuart papers Dalrymple's Append    Preparations of William  Though so many persons were privy to the designs of James though every channel of intelligence brought news of the preparations of France William was still a stranger to his own danger He however made all necessary preparations for manning the fleet Presswarrants continued to be executed throughout the month of February All sailors fit for service were forced to enter on board the navy The utmost expedition was used in the docks and yards In the first week of March all the ships of force had come round from Portsmouth Many had fallen down from  Deptford Woolwich and Chatham to the Nore William upon his arrival in Holland hastened the Dutch fleet to sea The Amsterdam the Maese the NorthHolland the Zealand squadrons were ordered to proceed successively to the Downs The combined fleets formed a greater naval force than had ever covered the sea They consisted of ninety ships of the line with many frigates and fireships They carried more than forty thousand men with near six thousand guns Russel in the Britannia a first rate commanded in chief the whole He resolved to adhere to his engagements with James But time and accident broke through all his designs  Stuartpapers    James arrives at La Hogue  The late King had concerted with his friends in England that the French fleet should sail early in the year Had the preparations of Lewis answered his expectations he proposed to put to sea in the middle of March He however left not St Germains until the eleventh of April He had even then sufficient time to carry his army to England before the junction of Russel with the Dutchfleet Besides that officer continued his correspondence and assured him of his firm intention to serve his cause He proposed one of two alternatives That James should suspend his expedition till winter or that he himself should under the pretence of making a descent on the coast of France permit the French fleet to pass He accordingly applied but in vain to the court of England for permission to attack St Maloes He advised James by all means to prevent the meeting of the fleets None of his officers was trusted with the secret and he would therefore find himself under a necessity to fight A contrary wind which blew incessantly for four weeks hindered the French from sailing and prevented James from conveying his instructions to Russel The Toulon squadron was kept by the same adverse wind from passing the Streights Tourville with the Brest squadron was after repeated efforts driven back to his port During this interval the Dutch joined the English in the Downs  May  Russel proceeded immediately to St Helens and ordered  two small squadrons that cruized on the coast of France to join him in that place  Vigorous measures in England  During this time of suspence the government of England were not remiss in their duty Several of the servants of the crown were in correspondence with the late King But they endeavoured by a shew of alacrity against him to prevent every suspicion of infidelity Some imperfect insinuations of a plot had been carried to William in Flanders The Earl of Portland arrived with secret instructions for the Queen The Earls of Huntington and Marlborough were sent to the Tower with others of lesser name A proclamation was issued for apprehending several other persons of rank who had absconded A camp was formed between Petersfield and Portsmouth Six regiments under orders to embark for Flanders were countermanded The lieutenancy were commanded to raise the militia The same precautions were used in Scotland But Ireland was left to its fate Orders were sent to the fleet to sail in quest of the enemy A declaration issued by James before he left St Germains was published and answered by authority Activity and spirit prevailed every where and that terror which commonly precedes danger was lessened by the bustle of preparation  Gazettes    The fleet sails toward La Hogue  The communication between France and England was in the mean time completely interrupted James during all the time he had remained at La Hogue received no intelligence from his friends in London  James II  Captain Lloyd who had been dispatched to him by his adherents with an important message and a letter from the princess of Denmark was detained two months on his way Tourville upon a change of wind sailed at length from Brest with fortyfour ships of the line He directed his course to La Hogue Unfortunately for that admiral the combined fleet of the enemy consisting of many more than double his number of ships arrived at the same instant in the neighbourhood of that place The weather in the mean time was extremely hazy On the nineteenth of May about four of the clock in the morning the sun  having cleared a little the weather admiral Russel descried the enemy holding with a very small gale at west and by south their course southward on the same tack with himself They began on both sides to form the line Tourville who had been irritated by a reflection thrown on his courage by de Seignelay resolved to fight the enemy though he was not ignorant of their force He bore down upon the combined fleets at ten of the clock The Dutch were in the van The French admiral threw out the signal of battle as he advanced on Russel who lay to receive him with his fore topsail to the mast  Russel's Letter to Nottingham June    An engagement  At half an hour after eleven Tourville in the Royal Sun of one hundred and four guns brought to within three quarters of a musket shot of the Britannia of one hundred guns commanded by Russel The rest of the French admiral's division fell in with the English line A smart engagement ensued The two commanders plied their guns very warmly till one of the clock The weather during the engagement fell almost calm Tourville was disabled His rigging sails and yards were shot His fire began to slacken He ordered his boats to tow him to windward Five fresh ships of the squadron with a furious fire covered their admiral's retreat About four of the clock a thick fog fell on the battle and the firing ceased At half after five a small breeze of wind arose at East The weather cleared up a little The French were running on every side Russel gave the signal for the fleet to chase The fog returned and night came on The French stood to the West with all their sails The breeze was so light that little way could be made The fog continued the greatest part of the next day Toward the evening Russel took in the signal for the line of battle and ordered each ship to make the best of her way in pursuit of the enemy The tide of ebb being done both fleets came to an anchor both resolving to take advantage of the next return of the tide  Ibid    Sixteen French ships burnt  In the morning of the twenty first of May all the French ships were far advanced toward the Race of Alderney One and twenty however were driven eastward from the entrance of the Race by the tide of flood toward Cape La Hogue Three of that number endeavoured to tack to the westward against the current But one of them after two or three short boards ran ashore The other two were weathered by the sternmost ships of Russel's squadron Sir Ralph Delaval rear admiral of the red was ordered to destroy the three ships Russel himself stretched after the remaining eighteen who hauled in for La Hogue Five made their escape eastward in the night Thirteen were observed on the twentysecond hauled in close with the shore On the twentythird rearadmiral Rooke was ordered with several men of war the fireships and boats of the fleet to destroy the enemy's ships The men of war could not approach He however burnt six ships in the night The remaining seven were destroyed in the same manner the next day Little resistance was made by the French Their officers had retired and the men fled upon the approach of the English sailors James himself is said to have been a spectator of this last action but Tourville refused to receive his advice The army intended for the invasion were near but they had the mortification to behold a destruction which they could not prevent  Russel's letter to Nottingham June    Observations  The French owed their misfortunes in the battle or rather in the affair of La Hogue as it has been more justly called to their presumption at first and afterwards to their want of spirit and skill Tourville supported with little courage and less conduct the battle into which he had wantonly entered The superior skill of the English in managing light breezes of wind and impetuous tides gave them a great advantage over an enemy who were manifestly conquered in their own minds The French suffered little in the engagement Tourville's ship was the only one in any degree disabled None was taken none sunk few even suffered in their rigging Russel himself  though a man of too much courage not to fight with spirit owed his success more to accident and the folly of his enemies than his own conduct Had the Dutch shewed the same alacrity in fighting which they had exhibited upon a former occasion against Tourville the ruin of the French fleet might have been rendered complete But the haziness of the weather the very fears of the French upon perceiving themselves much outnumbered the consusion and want of plan which prevail in all naval engagements ought to have saved the victors from the censure which some writers have thrown on their conduct The chief loss of the French consisted in that of their ships Sixteen men of war between fiftysix and one hundred and four guns were burnt Twenty transports shared the same fate Few were killed on either side Among the slain on the part of the victors the most regretted were admiral Carter and captain Hastings  Gazette    on the affair of La Hogue  Russel it is certain meant nothing less than to obstruct the service for which the French fleet were to sail His loitering at St Helens for ten days after he had passed through the Downs his applying in concert with the late King to the ministry for leave to attack St Maloes his calling in the squadrons that observed under Carter and Delaval the motions of the enemy seem all to have been calculated to accommodate the intended invasion He knew that the same winds which carried himself out of the river would have favoured Tourville in leaving Brest A few days would have brought the French fleet to La Hogue A few hours would have wafted the invaders to the coast of Sussex When James should land he was determined to throw off the mask and declare for that Prince The prudence or perhaps the terrors of the government defeated his measures They refused to agree to the proposed descent They ordered him to take the advice of a council of war The result was that the fleet stretched over to La Hogue But with a design to return to St Helen's in four days The fate of the British kingdoms depended upon accident  Had Tourville arrived on the coast of Normandy a few days before or had the winds detained him till Russel's proposed return to his old station the crown of England would have been transferred to the late King without contest  Stuart papers    Conduct of James Transactions at sea  James was rather disappointed than rendered desperate by the success of the English fleet He laid the blame upon accident He continued his correspondence with Russel He held his former communication with his friends in England Though the object of his restoration was rendered a little more distant he kept it still in view His agents were busy The discontented caballed in his favour Men in office betrayed to him the secrets of the cabinet and sometimes guided their conduct by his advice  Stuartpapers James II  He retired to St Germans where his queen had borne a daughter in his absence The English fleet remained in a state of inaction during the rest of the summer The ministry proposed to carry into execution a descent on the French coast which had been projected in the preceding winter Russel discontented with government and provoked by some orders sent to him by the queen which he deemed the the effect of ignorance  Burnet vol iii  rendered ineffectual a scheme which promised no great success The French fleet retired to their ports They had lost but a very few men in their late misfortune They filled the whole channel with their privateers The merchants sustained much loss The great expectations which the nation derived from the late victory were damped with its want of beneficial consequences The ministry complained of Russel and Russel of the ministry Clamour disappointment and ill humour prevailed after an event which promised general satisfaction and joy  Ibid    Campaign in Flanders  Though the fate of England seemed to depend on the operations at sea William turned his his principal attention to the war by land He was the chain of union between the heads of the grand confederacy  the life and spirit of their councils and armies The force of the allies had however been in some degree diminished by the intrigues of Lewis the Fourteenth and misunderstandings between themselves Disputes between the Emperor and the Elector of Saxony had induced the latter to recal his troops to his own dominions Sweden and Denmark continued their neutrality The Helvetic body discovered an inclination to favour the cause of France To supply the place of the Saxons the Emperor and King of England gained the younger branch of the house of Lunenburgh to their party The Dukes of Zell and Hanover upon the promise of an electoral cap with a certainty of the investiture before the end of the year undertook to march six thousand troops to join the Imperialists and four thousand to reinforce the army of the allies in Flanders The Spaniards had raised to the government of that country the Elector of Bavaria a Prince whose spirit and abilities promised to support the feebleness of the common cause on that side France was in the mean time active in her preparations and prudent in the disposition of her armies The Mareschal de Lorges commanded on the upper Rhine De Joyeuse occupied the country of Eyefeldt De Boufflers lay between the Sambre and the Meuse Luxembourg in the name of the Dauphin commanded in Flanders  Hist de France Tom iii Hist d'Allemagne Tom vii    Namur taken  Lewis the Fourteenth and William set out on the same day to join their respective armies The first arrived in his camp on the twentieth of May On the twentythird all his troops were in motion He suddenly sat down before Namur The King with fortyfive thousand men prosecuted the siege He was covered by Luxembourg with another army The town was strong The citadel was deemed impregnable The Prince de Barbason commanded in the place with a wellappointed garrison of ten thousand men The famous Coehorn defended in person a new fort called by his own name But de Vauban  directed the attack The eyes of all Europe were turned toward Namur Two great Kings at the head of two powerful armies turned their whole thoughts to this important enterprise A battle which was to decide the fate of the war was daily to be expected The French attacked  June N S  the place with incredible vigour The town in six days was forced to capitulate  July  William in the mean time advanced with an army of one hundred thousand men and sat down within cannon shot of Luxembourg's lines The small river Mehaigne ran between the armies An ineffectual cannonade ensued The French pressed with vigour the siege of the new fort Coehorn made an obstinate defence But being driven from the covered way on the twentysecond of July and forced to retire with great loss into the body of the place he capitulated The fate of the citadel was soon after decided The garrison evacuated the place on the thirtieth of July and Lewis returned in triumph to Versailles  Hist de France tom iii    Battle of Steinkirk  Though William lost reputation by permitting a place of such importance as Namur to be taken in his sight his inactivity may be justified in some degree by the strong position of the enemy The Duke de Luxembourg one of the best generals of the age had posted himself to great advantage on the banks of the Mehaigne The unseasonable rains had unexpectedly swelled the stream and formed into morasses the adjoining fields To make at first an attack was to risque a defeat and the place surrendered before William who was always slow in his councils could determine upon any vigorous measure to raise the siege To retrieve the glory which he had lost before Namur William endeavoured to suprise the French army under the Duke of Luxembourg at Steinkirk The attack was chiefly carried on by the English in columns They ascended with amazing resolution and spirit the rising ground on which a wing of the French army lay encamped They took possession of their  batteries and were for some time masters of their line The whole camp was in confusion But the assailants were not properly supported The second line of the French advanced The rencounter was obstinate and bloody The contest was maintained for four hours The allies were at length repulsed having left many thousands of the enemy as well as of their own number dead on the field Though this bloody battle was attended with no material consequences an undisputed victory remained to the French The king gained no reputation for his conduct But the valour of his troops deserved great applause The generals Mackay Lanier and Douglas the Earl of Angus and several officers of distinction were killed in this unfortunate field The Prince de Turenne and the Mareschal de Bellefons were numbered among the slain on the side of the French  Hist de France tom iii Gazettes passim    A conspiracy against William  The campaign in Flanders languished after the battle of Steinkirk The discovery of a plot against the life of William and the execution of one Grandval the pretended assassin gave occasion to much reflection and noise Lewis the Fourteenth and the late King of England were involved by the discoverers in this conspiracy But as there is no probability that the former would be guilty of such a villainous design so there is now a certainty that the latter rejected always with becoming horror all proposals of the like kind The incident however served at the time the views of party and loaded with a degree of infamy an unhappy Prince already ruined by his folly and misfortunes The hopes of a reward for the discovery gave birth in all appearance to a plot laid chiefly at the door of de Louvois who was lately dead His son de Barbesieux was accused of carrying on what his father had begun But as the odium of the murder itself would do more harm than what could be derived of advantage from the death of William the prudence of the French court may be trusted with regard to their innocence  Campaign in Savoy on the Rhine and in Hungary  The French in exerting their chief force in Flanders left their own country exposed on the side of Dauphiné The army under de Catinat was found too weak to resist the Duke of Savoy That Prince sufficiently revenged himself for the insults which he had received in his own dominions in the two preceding campaigns He entered Dauphiné in the month of July He ravaged the open country He attacked the fortified towns The surrender of Embrun on the seventeenth of August was soon followed by the taking of Gap In the midst of his success the Duke fell ill of the smallpox Dissentions prevailed among the nations which composed his motley army He found himself obliged to retire and to evacuate the places which he had seized On the Rhine the Mareschal de Lorges defeated the Prince of Wertemberg on the seventeenth of September He forced the Prince of Hesse to raise the siege of Ebenbourg The Marquis d' Harcourt obtained some advantages in the county of Chinei and de Boufflers bombarded Charleroy on the nineteenth of October The campaign upon the whole ended with sufficient glory to France Her allies were not equally successful on their side of the war Great Waradin was taken by the Imperialists after a long blockade and those distractions which usually attend the misfortunes of the Ottomans involved the Seraglio in blood  Hist de France tom iii    Young's forgeries  The defeat of the French fleet at La Hogue had removed the fears of the nation from a foreign enemy but the domestic tranquillity was still disturbed by surmizes of plots conspiracies and treasons Men in general believed that some secret machinations existed in favour of the late King No proofs had appeared against the suspected The Earls of Huntington Scarsdale and Marlborough had been sent to the Tower upon the accusation of one Young a criminal actually under the execution of the law in Newgate for forgery This infamous person by the advice of a prisoner for debt in the same gaol and by the aid of one Blackhead framed an association  against the government to which he annexed the names of the Earls of Salisbury and Marlborough the deprived Archbishop of Canterbury the Bishop of Rochester and other persons of rank The Bishop of Rochester being confronted with Blackhead detected the villainy of the accusation to the satisfaction of the council But the court suspecting Marlborough of some secret intrigues with James still encouraged Young His fine was paid and he himself was discharged from prison Marlborough in defiance of the  habeas corpus  act was detained in the Tower by a chichane of law even after the grand jury of Middlesex had found a bill of forgery and subornation of perjury against Young  Case of the Earls of Huntington and Marlborough    Discontents  These legal severities recalled the memory of former times and they seemed more grievous as they were now less expected The passions of men inflamed by faction and party were ready to receive impressions of the worst kind The press groaned with polemical pamphlets The Jacobites attacked the measures of government and accused the King of a breach of faith to the nation The Whigs complained of the management of the war the burden of taxes the imperfect securities of the liberties of the people They affirmed that the aid given for the maintenance of the war at land had been absolutely lost That instead of breaking the power of France the efforts of the allies had covered her arms with renown The grand army under the King in Flanders they said had lost ground to the enemy The Germans had received a check on the Rhine The efforts of the Spaniards in Catalonia had been seeble and ineffectual The retreat of the Duke of Savoy had put an end to the hopes of the allies on that side The navy though successful against the fleet of the enemy had not been able to protect the commerce of the kingdom against their privateers These suggestions were received with avidity by a people accustomed to blame the measures of every government The facts though exaggerated were true in the main  and men found in their own burdens that they had some reason to complain  Publications An    Parliament meets  In the midst of these discontents William returned to England Having arrived from Brussels at the Hague on the eleventh of October he embarked on the fifteenth in the Maese and on the twentieth came to Kensington He met his parliament at Westminster on the fourth of November He expressed to them his joy at having an opportunity of thanking them again for their large supplies He hoped he said for their future advice and assistance against the excessive power of France They had great reason to rejoice he said at the late victory at sea He wished that he could tell them of an equal success by land He informed them that the French were repairing the loss which they had sustained in their fleet That they designed to augment their army against the next campaign He therefore declared that it was absolutely necessary that at least an equal force should be maintained in the ensuing as in the present year and he desired the commons to give a suitable supply He was sensible he said of the heavy charge upon his people He regretted the inconvenience of sending great sums of money out of the kingdom for the payment of troops abroad He promised to attempt a descent on France He took notice of the signal deliverance from the French invasion He entertained no doubt of their support He requested dispatch in their councils He assured them that he had no interest separate from theirs That he had no aim but to render his people happy He concluded with observing that as he never spared his person for the good of his subjects he would continue to encounter dangers for the honour and advantage of England  Journals Nov th    Ill humour in  Though this speech seemed calculated to gain the good opinion of parliament neither of the houses returned their immediate thanks by an address The commons adjourned for a week the lords for three  days The latter when they met instead of paying their compliments to the King began to vindicate their own privileges The lords who had been committed to the Tower represented their grievances They were supported with great warmth by their friends The constable of the Tower was ordered to produce the warrants of commitment The judges of the king's bench were commanded to appear before the house to answer for their refusal to discharge the recognizance into which the imprisoned peers had entered for their appearance Violent debates ensued The opposition in every motion prevailed Resolutions were framed to guide the judges of oyer and terminer in their proceedings on the  habeas corpus  act The lords declared that two witnesses of the delinquency were necessary to justify the remanding any person to prison upon his application to be admitted to bail A motion was made and carried for entering this resolution on the books as a standing rule to all future judges The mode of setting free the accused prisoners became a matter of great debate The King interfered To end the contest he promised to give directions for discharging the bail of the lords in the king's bench But so much inflamed were the majority that they determined to enter upon no business till the King's promise was actually performed  Journals of the Lords    both houses  This concession from the court was not sufficient to allay the heats in parliament The commons on the tenth of November had voted thanks to the King for his speech They ordered an address to the Queen acknowledging her prudent administration in the absence of her husband But they at the same time resolved to present an address desiring that the alliances made with the Sates in the months of April and August and all other alliances with the princes and States of Europe should be laid before the house  Nov  They entered into an examination of the management of the war at sea They voted thanks to Admiral Russel for his victory But they resolved to inquire why that victory had not been pursued  This however was soon after dropt A resolution to offer advice to the King was attended with no better fate A great animosity against the preference given to foreigners exhibited itself in the debates of the house They resolved that one article of the proposed advice should bear that he should fill all vacancies as they should happen among the general officers with the subjects of Great Britain and that the commander in chief of the English troops should be an Englishman This resolution was aimed at the Count de Solmes on whose conduct toward the national troops at the battle of Steinkirk they severely animadverted  Journals passim    A supply granted  Notwithstanding these symptoms of discontent among the commons that assembly seemed more hostile to the ministry than adverse to the King Though James was in correspondence with some leaders in the two houses he had despaired of guiding the conduct of either long before the parliament met  Stuartpapers Sept  The previous motion of advice was introduced and managed by his friends supported by some zealous Whigs But this attempt was defeated by frequent adjournments On the twentysecond of November  Journals Nov  a general supply was voted The commons on the second of December specified the sums granted for each service  Dec  Near four millions were allowed for the land and sea service together with seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds to supply the deficiency in the polltax of the preceding year These great sums were raised by various ways and means A tax of four shillings in the pound was charged upon all lands according to their yearly value with a vote of credit to enable the King to raise money at seven  per cent  upon that fund A fund of credit for one million was also established on the hereditary excise by way of tontine But all these provisions appearing inadequate to the wants of government an additional imposition was laid upon merchandize before the end of the session  Feb    The lords refractory  THE lords were much more refractory than the commons The former seemed offended with the King as well as with his measures The latter shewed only their dislike to the acting minister the Earl of Nottingham The discontented lords availed themselves of the article in the speech where William asked advice of his parliament Under this cover they endeavoured to send a remonstrance to the throne Those who had distinguished themselves most for the revolution were the chief promoters of a measure which distressed and offended the King The Earl of Devonshire though lordsteward of the household preferred his principles to the adherence to the court expected from his office The Earls of Shrewsbury Monmouth Torrington Macclesfield and Warrington and the Lord Mountague who were deemed the most steady Whigs were the most violent against William and his partiality to strangers The Earl of Marlborough yielding to his own resentment and in concert with James  Stuartpapers Nov  appeared a principal in the motions against foreigners The Earl of Bath who had four years before betrayed Plymouth to the Prince of Orange had engaged to execute the same service for the late King  Ibid  To give an earnest of his zeal he joined heartily with Marlborough The Tory lords not in office supported the opposition on popular grounds Though the majority of the bishops favoured James in secret they adhered except one to the court and several peers who were in correspondence with the court of St Germains  Ibid  endeavoured to cover their private engagements by supporting in public the cause of William  They remonstrate against foreigners  The parties were so equally poised that almost the whole winter was spent in the fiercest debates The people themselves were not unconcerned spectators of the contest Their jealousy of foreigners the indignity of trusting to aliens the defence of the kingdom while the native troops were employed abroad the real and supposed insolence of Dutch  favourites and officers combined to inflame the passions of the nation against the crown The opposing lords in some measure at length prevailed A remonstrance was presented  Journals Feb  to the King consisting of five articles The peers desired that the commanding officer of the English next the King himself should be an Englishman That the English officers should have precedency of all officers of the same rank in the confederate armies except those of crowned heads That the twenty thousand men destined for the defence of England should be all native English under the command of an English general That the abuses committed in pressing sailors should be remedied and prevented That no foreigners should be permitted to sit at the board of ordnance William was not of a complexion to grant demands so contrary to his fixed predilections and views He refused the request of the lords by answering that he would consider their address The opposition had carried their point with such difficulty that they dropt the remonstrance without any farther efforts Their ill humour however continued and filled the whole session with ineffectual altercations and debates  Journals    Proceedings of both houses  The opposition in the house of lords to shew their own resentment or to embarrass the government discovered a disposition to stop the progress of the bills of supply The measure was adopted in concert with James  Stuartpapers  who notwithstanding his disappointment at La Hogue still projected an invasion The Marquis of Halifax and the Earl of Mulgrave induced the house by the force of their eloquence to ingraft a clause on the landtax bill that the lords should tax themselves The bill was sent down amended to the commons The lower house flew into the most violent heat They rejected the amendment without one dissenting voice The lords agreed to pass the bill without alteration with a formal protest on their journals that though they yielded to the present urgent state of affairs they had a right to insist upon  taxing themselves In other matters the two houses were more unanimous They ordered by a joint vote that a pamphlet entitled  "King William and Mary conquerors"  should be burnt by the hands of the common hangman They addressed the King to dismiss from his place the licenser of the press under whose sanction it had been printed and published They assumed an appearance of hostility to the high prerogatives of the crown while they strengthened the hands of the King with enormous supplies  Journals passim    A placebill rejected by the lords  Though this facility in giving money has been ascribed to some corrupt practices of the court it may be justified from the urgent state of the times The people were plunged in a war from which they could not immediately extricate themselves by land either with honour or with safety To remit in preparations by sea might have encouraged an invasion The commons in other respects shewed little complaisance for the crown They even appeared to be selfdenied with regard to the private interest of their own members They introduced and passed a bill touching free and impartial proceedings in parliament which excluded from the right of sitting in the house all persons who should accept of any office from the crown The ministry found themselves incapable of opposing in the lower house a measure so popular To facilitate the passing of this important bill it was not to be in force till the King should think fit to call a new parliament It was sent up to the lords early in the session The malcontents in the upper house carried the motion in favour of the bill in the committee But when it came to be reported the court party by the means of proxies rejected it by a majority of two votes The adherents of James were joined with the most violent Whigs upon the present occasion The first wished for confusion the latter by yielding to their resentment adhered to their professed principles  Journals    The opposition in the house of lords were not discouraged with the bad success of the placebill As  Bill for shortening the duration of parliament rejected by the King  they could not exclude the members from office they were resolved to shorten the duration of parliament The present house of commons though refractory on some occasions had rendered their general conduct grateful to the court Their opposition to the high exertions of the prerogative had never been followed with rigour They were generous in their supplies and perhaps rather profuse with regard to the money of the subject A great majority were Tories men in general less attached to the family of a prince than to the power of the crown The Earl of Nottingham and others of their own party had opened a channel of connexion between them and the reigning King Sir John Trevor the speaker was a successful agent in purchasing the votes of the venal with money  Burnet vol iii  Besides in the present divided state of the nation a new election would be at least troublesome if not attended with danger The opposition perceived the views of their enemies and they were resolved to pursue their own The Earl of Shrewsbury moved for a bill providing for triennial parliaments and annual sessions It passed the house of lords The commons passed it by a great majority William resolved to disappoint a bill so adverse to the power of the crown He therefore rejected it when presented for the royal assent  March  This was the second time he made use of a prerogative which neither of his immediate predecessors ever chose to exert  Affairs of Ireland  The affairs of Ireland commanded a considerable degree of the attention of parliament during the present session That kingdom ever since its reduction in had exhibited one continued scene of oppression injustice and public misery The government of James with all its disadvantages his own bigotry the insolence of the papists combined with the fears of the protestants were all more tolerable than the administration of William ever since the surrender of Limerick Coningsby and Porter the lords justices rendered themselves odious by a series of frauds cruelties  and rapacities They sold common justice for money They screened the guilty and oppressed the innocent for gain To render their proceedings summary to clothe their authority with more terror and with most expedition to enrich themselves they chose to exert their power in the military way The corruption at the source extended itself through every channel of government The subordinate magistrates the justices of the peace as if all law were at an end made their own will and pleasure the rule of their conduct Presuming on their power in the country they deprived under the colour of authority many persons of their effects they dispossessed many of their lands  Printed Proclamation  The Roman Catholics as they had less to expect from justice than the Protestants endeavoured to purchase favour They applied to those in power through the channel of venality and thus the party who had been in arms against the Revolution fared better than those who had supported the cause of William with the most zeal courage and industry  Journals passim    The grievances of that kingdom  On the third of March the Lord Viscount Sidney was raised to the government of Ireland But he arrived not in that kingdom till the twentyfifth of the following August Coningsby created a Baron by the same name with his colleague Porter continued in the government in the intermediate time They presided in the court of claims for adjusting the demands of those comprehended in the articles of Limerick and the obvious road to their justice was said to lie through their avarice The arrival of Sidney in his government though it might lessen the fear of future oppressions diminished not the resentment of the people for former injuries His own conduct seemed more calculated to preserve the prerogative of the crown than to redress the grievances of the subject His speech at the opening of the parliament was suited to the times and well received But the memory of the past created an ill humour among the commons Seventy thousand pounds had been demanded as an additional revenue for the annual and  necessary expences of government But the house were either slow in finding the ways and means or ignorant where they could be found Two bills ready drawn the one for an additional excise on malt liquors the other for a tax on land bearing corn were sent down from the Irish privy council The commons were highly offended at the manner of introducing these bills which were in themselves especially the latter highly exceptionable and in some degree partial and unjust They argued that though by Poyning's law no bill was to be passed without the sanction of the English privy council it was never deemed that the Irish commons were precluded from taxing themselves  Journals passion Slone's Narrative    laid before the English parliament  The necessities of government induced the lordlieutenant to hearken to a compromise The commons consented to pass the excise bill with a declaration that the thing should not be drawn into a precedent But they rejected the landbill as laying an unequal tax upon the farmers When Sidney found himself in possession of the additional excise he gave vent to his resentment against the parliament He sent for them on the fourth of November    He reprimanded them severely for invading the prerogatives of the Crown He prorogued them to the sixteenth of April Inflamed with what they deemed a public insult offended at some private expressions of indignation from the lordlieutenant several members of the Irish house of commons came in the name of their country to England to lay their grievances before the parliament On the twentyfourth of February they laid their complaints in writing before the English commons The lords at the same time took cognizance of the affair and examined witnesses Some circumstances appeared upon the inquiry which served to heighten the mismanagements of government as well as the real grievances of Ireland The army in want of pay from the Crown raised money by military distress from the subject to the incredible  amount of two hundred thousand pounds  Slone and Brewster's Narratives  The stores left by James in the kingdom to the value it was said of eighty thousand pounds were embezzled or applied to his own use by Coningsby The lordlieutenant himself and Ginckle who had been created Earl of Athlone were accused of possessing themselves of almost all the forfeitures which ought to have fallen to the public  Ibid passim  But one of the most flagrant inroads upon the constitution was the depriving the citizens of Dublin of their right to chuse their own magistrates  A remonstrance on that subject  The lords presented an address upon the subject of the Irish complaints The commons sent a remonstrance to the throne To the grievances already specified the latter added several others of the same alarming kind They complained of the miseries of free quarters and the licentiousness of the army to which the Protestant subjects had been exposed They represented the danger of recruiting the troops as had been notoriously done with Irish Papists and such persons as had been in open rebellion They averred that the common course of law was stopt by granting protections to Roman Catholics not comprehended within the articles of pacification and that it was from the mercenary views of the servants of the Crown that the impolitic addition was made to the treaty with the Papists at the surrender of Limerick All these grievances they requested the King to redress and he promised to rectify all that had been amiss in Ireland The miseries of that kingdom might perhaps have been exaggerated The expectations of the Protestants were high from the success of their party The claims of the Papists were extensive from the favourable articles by which they had finished the war Recent injuries were added on both sides to ancient prejudices and animosities To satisfy either was certainly a thing difficult for any government But it is equally certain that the servants of the Crown were much less attentive to the happiness of the people  than to the gratification of their own passions and avarice  Parliament prorogued March  William seems either to have repented of his promise to the commons or to have been persuaded from his purpose by those most concerned in the mismanagements in Ireland To prevent the parliament from resuming the affair he prorogued it on the fourteenth of March just four days after receiving the remonstrance He thanked the commons for their large supplies He signified to the two houses his intention of going abroad He promised to continue to expose his person upon all occasions for the good and advantage of his kingdoms and that his hearty and sincere endeavours should never be wanting to make the English a great and flourishing nation  Journals Mar  Notwithstanding this soothing speech the different parties in both houses were highly offended at the sudden prorogation The Whigs resented the measure as an aggravating sequel to the King's refusing his assent to the bill for shortening the duration of parliaments The discontented part of the Tories joined upon other grounds the general cry The Jacobites being the most violent in their principles were least temperate in their language All parties carried their discontents and arguments to the press The Earl of Warrington Hampden and Wildman were supposed to inflame the Whigs with publications The church offended at the coldness of William supported the opinions of the high Tories to the world Ferguson and several other adherents of James openly attacked the Revolution and the personal character and conduct of the King  Publications    A stairs of Scotland  The massacre of Glenco had greatly shaken the interest of William in the minds of his Scottish subjects The hopes of James arose in proportion to the odium which a transaction so barbarous had thrown upon the government of his rival But prior to that event the late King had laid a plan for invading Scotland In the end of the year he solicited Lewis the Fourteenth for a force to sail from Brest Belleisle  or Rochfort and to land between Irving and Air When the King of France had resolved to transport an army into England under the conduct of James before the affair of La Hogue the Scottish expedition was not relinquished Two frigates with officers stores arms and a small sum of money were to sail from Ambleteuse when the main fleet were to put to sea The defeat of Tourville broke this as well as all the other measures of the late King His attention afterwards was chiefly turned to England The Earls of Arran and Breadalbin and Sir James Montgomery were the only persons of rank in Scotland who held any correspondence with the court of St Germains though the greatest part by far of the gentry of the kingdom were in the interest of the late King  Stuartpapers passim    Obsequiousness of its parliament  The unexpected blow sustained by the French at La Hogue and the consequent disappointment of James threw a damp on his adherents throughout the rest of the year The nation in general shewed a manifest impatience under the government of William But those who opposed that Prince the most covered under specious complaints of grievances their attachment to his rival The King by the advice of secretary Johnston managed his affairs with prudence He gained by promoting their leaders the Presbyterians He reconciled the Duke of Hamilton and his party to his government by appointing that nobleman commissioner to the approaching parliament On the eighteenth of April in the present year a parliament met at Edinburgh To flatter the pride of the Scots the King signified in his letter that ever since his coming to the Crown he had been fully resolved to hold a parliament in person in his ancient kingdom He declared that nothing but his necessary presence abroad or the business of his station when in England could have hitherto prevented his purpose The commissioner assured the house that the King was resolved to support the present establishment in civil and ecclesiastical affairs He awaked their fears of present dangers by recounting those he had escaped in the preceding year and he concluded his speech with demanding  a supply to place the kingdom in a posture of defence against its enemies Tweedale the chancellor enforced what the commissioner had proposed He recommended that new laws should be made to strengthen the authority of government and to recover the ruined trade of the nation  ill requi  ted by William  The spirit which had uniformly opposed government since the late revolution if not extinguished was at least suppressed The parliament was all submission Their answer to the King was full of humility acknowledgment and loyalty They voted that four regiments of foot and two of dragoons should be added to the standing forces of the kingdom To defray the charges of this body of men and to aid the other expences of government they granted a supply of one hundred and fourteen thousand pounds sterling They ratified by a solemn act the proceedings of the privy council in impressing seamen They expelled all absentees among the commoners from their house They fined such lords as declined to attend in parliament A committee of secrecy had been appointed to inquire into the designs of the adherents of the late King Upon some allegorical letters that had been intercepted they formed their report They declared that there had been and still was a project subsisting between the Jacobites and France for invading the kingdom with a foreign force Several lords were imprisoned in the castles of Sterling and Edinburgh rather on suspicion than on proof One Payne an Englishman who was actually an agent for James in Scotland was in custody and threatened with a trial But this zeal for his government was not properly returned by the King He declined to levy the new troops But he took care to raise the tax appointed for their subsistence and to apply it to other uses of his own  Burnet vol iii    Intrigues of  In England the intrigues of the late King fomented the discontents of all the parties He continued his correspondence during the winter His secret friends were busy His agents assiduously employed The Earl of Middleton had been sent to England in the  preceding August  Stuartpapers Nov  He carried on successfully his negociations with the discontented till the month of January King James eager to recover his crown offered terms which even the most scrupulous among the discontented approved In a letter in the end of November he explained his views with great moderation and address He lamented that it had been hitherto his misfortune to be mistaken in his applications to his people He however appealed to God for the uniform sincerity of his heart He solemnly assured the nation that according to the most natural signification of the words he was ready to agree to any laws that should be desired for the security of the Protestant religion as established in the church of England He promised to settle with the concurrence of parliament a liberty of conscience He was fully resolved he said to assent to all laws for securing effectually the liberty and property of the subject not only during his own reign but against all the incroachments of his posterity and successors in the throne He affirmed that it was his resolution to meet his people frequently in parliament as the best expedient to render a King truly great and the subject perfectly happy and that it was his determined resolution neither to design nor attempt to introduce any arbitrary power in the crown  Ibid Nov    the late King  He hoped he said that he had expressed himself plainly He declared that he meant honestly He was sensible that the nation besides the violence done to their own principles had not found their account in the injury they had done to his right He was no stranger he said from that circumstance that some who were displeased with the times pursued projects of redress by other means than his restoration But he averred that his return to his native country was the only thing that could either give a better establishment for the future or relieve them from their present distress He requested his friends for the greater security of the nation to send any persons they pleased to discourse with him at large upon the subject  of his letter He doubted not he said to give any commissioned to him for that purpose an entire satisfaction upon every point To create future confidence he desired to forget the past He was resolved for his own part to pardon all the miscarriages of all his subjects without exception He expressed his earnest desire to close in every thing with the united interest of the people He requested that more of them would make him acquainted with their inclinations without the least degree of flattery which had often too fatal an influence upon the councils of Kings  Stuartpapers Nov  and he concluded with declaring that he wished for nothing in the world so earnestly as to see his people establshed upon the true and legal foundation  Ibid    in England  The malcontents in England were so much disgusted with William that they received the assurances of James with ardour The Earl of Middleton in the month of January returned to France with eight proposals from those who wished to restore the late King upon conditions They were accepted without hesitation The high opinion which James always entertained of the importance of the fleet induced him to apply to the principal officers with unremitting diligence Russel had promised in the preceding autumn his best endeavours to serve his cause But William in consequence of Russel's opposition in parliament and his disputes with the Earl of Nottingham had deprived that officer of the chief command Delaval Killegrew and Shovel were appointed in a joint commission to execute the office of admiral The two first had been for some time in the interest of the late King That Prince encouraged by a very great party in England and numbering among his friends some of the first officers of state flattered by the engagements of the fleet and the discontents in the army promised to himself an absolute certainty of being restored with little opposition to the throne The French King kept the crown of England on the head of William He listened to the proposals of  James But he entertained no serious thought of assisting that Prince with effect  Stuartpapers    His declaration  Urged by his own hopes and the zeal of his friends in England the late King prepared a declaration upon the eight articles transmitted to France through the hands of the Earl of Middleton It was dated at St Germains on the seventeenth of April  April N S  He promised an unlimited pardon to all his subjects an absolute oblivion of all the past He declared that he would immediately call a parliament inform himself through them of the inclinations of his people and redress by their concurrence former grievances and give every security for their future happiness He promised to protect the church of England to secure to its members all the churches universities colleges and schools to confirm their immunities rights and privileges He pledged his word to recommend to his parliament an impartial liberty of conscience He declared that he would never violate the test and that he would leave the dispensing power of the crown in other matters to be explained and limited by the representatives of the nation He solemnly promised to give his assent to all such bills as should be found necessary to shorten the duration of parliaments to secure the freedom of elections the fair returns of members and impartial trials  to the people of England  To regain the favour of those who had been most active in the late revolution he engaged himself to ratify and confirm all such laws during the government of William as should be tendered to him by his parliament He declared his willingness to reestablish in the most ample manner the act of settlement of Ireland as passed in his brother's reign to relinquish the chimneymoney or any other part of the revenue as should be deemed burdensome to the people for any other more easy assessment He assured his people that he had formed his declaration upon the advice of a great number of his subjects of all ranks and degrees who had already adjusted the manner of his reascending the throne To remove the apprehensions  of his subjects that great sums might be demanded by France he positively assured them that his most Christian Majesty expected no compensation but the glory of having succoured an injured Prince He added that he was on the eve of coming to vindicate his own right and to establish the liberties of his people and he concluded with solemnly praying that God might so give him success in the prosecution of the one as he was sincere in his intentions to confirm the other  Printed Declaration    Legal severities  A month after this declaration was dated in France it was dispersed privately in England by the adherents of the late King Some persons who had undertaken that dangerous office were secured and upon slender proofs punished severely for a high misdemeanour  May  Several violent libels against the government had raised the resentment and indignation of the courts of justice The legal severities of which the people formerly complained seemed in some cases to be renewed in all their horror One Anderton was seized  May  by the messenger of the press as the printer of two seditious pamphlets and committed for a misdemeanour to Newgate But when he offered sufficient bail he was by a fresh warrant continued in prison for high treason On the trial of this unfortunate person no positive evidence of guilt appeared Though the statute of treason allowed no conjectural presumptions no strained inferences no forced constructions he was at length condemned Treby lordchiefjustice of the common pleas and formerly a vehement patriot presided at his trial and was said to have even surpassed Jefferys himself in violence upon this occasion He browbeat the prisoner He rejected without any answer his defence He reviled and threatened the jury when they seemed to lean to the favourable side The novelty of Anderton's case being the first who had ever suffered death for printing raised the attention of the public The lameness of the proof was generally condemned and to convict upon presumptions in cases of treason was  deemed a dangerous innovation  Anderton's Case  But when a nation is divided into two inveterate parties it is difficult to exclude violence even from the seats of justice  Campaign in Flanders  The King impatient to open the campaign in Flanders left Kensington on the thirtyfirst of March and arrived in the Maese on the second of April The French had disturbed the winter itself with military excursions and attacks They had taken Furnes and Dixmuyde in the end of November with their garrisons consisting chiefly of the English who had reduced those places in the close of the preceding campaign His own preparations the necessity of settling previously the councils of the Allies and the difficulty of assembling the forces detained the King at Loo and the Hague till the middle of May Having joined the troops of the Allies at Deigham he marched from thence to Parks near Louvaine and by that judicious position is said to have broken the designs of France upon Brabant Lewis the Fourteenth with an equipage more suitable to a triumph than a campaign joined his army consisting of one hundred thousand men on the second of June Maestricht Charleroy Huy Brussels and Liege dreaded by turns the fall of the storm But the French King having fallen sick soon after his arrival returned to Versailles and left to the Mareschal de Luxembourg the conduct of military operations in Flanders Luxembourg on the fifteenth of June placed his head quarters at Meldert within half a league of the camp of the Allies The two armies continued in this situation above a month Each endeavoured to find an opportunity of giving battle to advantage while both suffered great hardships from the incessant rains  The French attack  The Mareschal de Luxembourg despairing to force William to fight at a disadvantage left his camp on the eighteenth of July He sat down before Huy which surrendered in two days Having amused the enemy with a feigned design upon Liege he suddenly quitted his post at Hellicheim crossed the Jaar in four columns directed his march toward the Allies  being determined to attack them in their camp or if they retreated to fall upon their rear His van was in sight before they were apprised of his march The King made the necessary preparations for receiving the enemy with vigour He sent away his heavy baggage He ordered his infantry to intrench themselves in the front of his camp The river Geette bounded his right and ran winding along his rear On the left and in the front of the left was the brook of Landen A thick hedge joining with one end the Geete covered part of the front of his right wing The village of Neerwinden with entrenchments before it was situated between the left end of the hedge and the center The village of Romsdorff stood farther advanced opposed to the front of the left wing and the entrenchment before it stretched to the rivulet of Landen A line of entrenchments extended themselves behind the two villages and behind these the army of the Allies was formed Their whole front was covered with one hundred pieces of cannon which by being advantageously placed on an eminence commanded all the approaches to their line  Mem de Feuquieres    and defeat Willam  On the evening  July  of his arrival in sight of the Allies the Mareschal de Luxembourg dislodged a detachment of the enemy posted in the village of Landen which stood advanced before the brook of that name Between this village and that of Romfdorff he placed forty battalions in the night He formed his center of eight lines of horse and foot intermixed His horse on the left wing were ordered to extend themselves to the Geette opposing their line to the thick hedge which covered the front of the enemy's right The French were formed before five in the morning and the cannonading began on both sides Six brigades under the Duke of Berwick and two other lieutenant generals attacked the village of Neerwinden This important post was carried But it was soon recovered by the vigilance of William who had the good fortune at the same instant to see his enemies repulsed on every side The center of the  French army was not properly sustained by either wing But the Mareschal de Luxembourg was not to be intimidated He made a second effort on Neerwinden He succeeded He was again repulsed He resolved to attack some other quarter of the enemy They were inaccessible every where The village of Neerwinden is a third time attacked William with great bravery led twice the English infantry to the entrenchment which the enemy endeavoured to force Nothing however could resist the impetuosity of the French Their center reinforced by their right opened a way for their cavalry into the very lines of the Allies They flanked the English They charged and put to flight the troops of Hanover They overturned and routed the Spaniards  William's account Gazettes    at Landen  William perceiving this disorder advanced suddenly with a part of his left wing But the enemy gave him no time to form They flanked the Dutch horse as they came They broke them in a furious onset before the English could draw into a line The King however was not to be driven from the field He ordered his troops to charge as they found themselves His efforts were attended with some success when he perceived his right wing driven headlong into the Geete Nothing but confusion could now be seen throughout the camp Slaughter and flight prevailed every where on the field The bridge being too much crowded by the runaways many were drowned in the river William retreated in the same order with the remains of the left wing He however left a complete victory to the enemy Sixtysix pieces of cannon eight mortars eighty standards colours and other trophies fell into the hands of the French Twelve thousand of the Allies lay dead in this bloody field Two thousand were made prisoners The Mareschal de Luxembourg gained little but glory from the battle of Landen He lost eight thousand of his best troops in the action and his army was so much weakened  by the number wounded that he could take no advantage of the consternation of the enemy  Hist de France tom iii    Reflections on his conduct  William displayed upon this occasion great courage and presence of mind He exposed his person to danger He issued his orders with coolness He was present every where He has notwithstanding been censured for hazarding in his circumstances a general engagement He had detached a considerable number of his troops under the Duke of Wertemberg He had sent a reinforcement to the garrison of Liege  Mem de Feuquieres  In point of numbers he was much inferior to Luxembourg He had sufficient time to retreat beyond the Geette and cover himself from insult behind that river  Ibid  His post however was so strong that his officers encouraged him to fight and he himself was extremely anxious to recover the laurels which he had lost in the preceding campaign Six weeks of inactivity succeeded the battle Both sides weakened by their losses seemed unwilling to grapple again in the field The Mareschal de Luxembourg being at length reinforced by detachments from the coasts of Picardy and Normandy as well as from the army on the upper Rhine moved toward Charleroy He sat down before that place on the eleventh of September William made no efforts to raise the siege The garrison behaved themselves with such spirit as deserved relief The King quitted the army on the fifth of October and Charleroy surrendered on the eleventh of that month  Hist de France vol iii    Campaign on the Upper Rhine  On the side of Germany the French tarnished their success with acts of barbarity and cruelty The Mareschal de Lorges having passed the Rhine at Philipsburgh without opposition  May  detached de Chamilli with twenty thousand men to invest Heydelberg In the midst of dissentions which prevailed among the garrison that place was stormed The soldiers and burghers were promiscuously put to the sword When slaughter ended rapine began The houses were burnt the churches pillaged the inhabitants  stripped naked the women exposed to violence and lust De Lorges in the mean time was prevented from passing the Necker by the Prince of Baden who commanded the confederate army The King of France having undertaken to the Ottomans to make a powerful diversion on the side of Germany had detached  June  twenty thousand men from the army in Flanders to the Upper Rhine When this reinforcement joined de Lorges the Dauphin assumed the command of the army That Prince having dispersed in vain a manifesto containing humiliating terms of peace advanced to the Necker and crossed that river  July  with twenty thousand men The Germans under the Prince of Baden unable to contend with such superior numbers avoided the risque of a battle in a strong post The Dauphin returned to Versailles The French and Imperialists having remained for some time in the field in a state of inactivity retired at length to their respective winter quarters  In Piedmont  The operations of the armies on the side of Piedmont having languished throughout the summer ended in a decisive action in the beginning of October  October  The duke of Savoy at the head of the confederates sat down before Pignerol The Mareschal de Catinat having been reinforced with ten thousand men from the army on the Upper Rhine descended from the mountains and from his motions seemed to threaten Turin The Duke having bombarded Pignerol raised the siege on the second of October He advanced to the small river Cisola where it passes by Marsaglia He sent away his heavy baggage resolving to engage de Catinat The next day the two armies came in sight and formed themselves in order of battle Neither side shewing any inclination to come to battle the consederates lay all night on the field in their arms When day light appeared the French were already formed The allies were instantly in motion The Imperial and Piedmontese cavalry commanded by the Duke in person covered the right wing The insantry consisting of the infantry  of Savoy and Great Britain were in the center under the famous Prince Eugene The Spaniards led by their native officers formed the left wing The French began the attack in an unusual manner They received the fire of the Spaniards as they advanced and then charged them with bayonets fixed and sword in hand The whole wing was broken in an instant and thrown in their confusion on the center The battle was sustained by the latter with great obstinacy They were however broken at length and forced to fly A complete victory remained to the French The cannon colours standards and light baggage of the allies fell into the hands of the enemy They lost eight thousand men in the field The Duke of Schomberg who commanded the troops in the pay of Great Britain was wounded and taken prisoner He was released on his parole and soon after died at Turin  Mem de Marq Feuquiers Gazettes    In Spain and Hungary  The French were successful on every side during this campaign In Catalonia the Mareschal de Noailles took Roses in the sight of the enemy The Spaniards enfeebled by the despicable councils of Charles the Second were unable to repel the victors The French were too few and ill provided to pursue the advantages which they had obtained Besides the Mareschal de Noailles had embarked six thousand men to reinforce de Catinat's army in Piedmont Both sides remained inactive from May till the end of the year The war in Hungary produced no signal event The Imperialists under the Duke de Croy laid siege to Belgrade in vain After five weeks open trenches they stormed the counterscarp But they were repulsed with great slaughter The grand Vizier advanced in the mean time with an army The Duke de Croy having called a council of war resolved to raise the siege He sent away his heavy baggage He repassed with his army the Saave The defeat of a few Tartars in the neighbourhood of Giulia was magnified by the Imperialists to cover the disgrace of an inactive and inglorious campaign  Hist des Ottomans vol ii    Affairs at sea  The same bad fortune whch pursued the allies by land attended their operations at sea The war in Flanders having ingrossed the whole attention of William the navy was much neglected by his servants Notwithstanding the great supplies that had been granted the fleet was not ready to sail till the middle of May and then it was feebly manned and ill supplied with necessaries and provisions Killegrew Delaval and Shovel who executed the office of admiral having been reinforced by the Dutch arrived at St Helens on the seventh of May The whole fleet was to have consisted of one hundred sail of men of war seventy of which were to have been of the line They however had not all rendezvoused when the admirals arrived These officers destitute of intelligence themselves and receiving no orders from the ministry were uncertain how to proceed The French had made the greatest preparations in all their ports They repaired and refitted all their men of war They bought and armed all the largest merchantmen They manned with activity and success the whole fleet All their ships in the ports of the ocean had assembled at Brest under Tourville The squadron equipped at Toulon and commanded by D'Estrees received orders to advance to the Streights King James continued to solicit the court of France to make another attempt on England and the sanguine adherents of that unfortunate Prince could ascribe such preparations to nothing but a fixed resolution to reestablish their master on his throne  Stuartpapers    The Smyrna fleet  The eyes of Lewis were turned to an object of much less importance than the reduction of a great kingdom The trading part of the English nation had ever since the commencement of the war complained with reason of the little attention paid by government to the protection of commerce Though powerful fleets were sent by the nation to sea individuals had suffered much from the privateers of the enemy The merchants resolved therefore to keep their richest ships in their ports till sufficient convoys could be obtained Some of these had been for  eighteen months ready to sail  Burnet vol iii  Their number every day accumulated They had been promised a strong convoy in the winter They were put off however by delays Four hundred merchantmen consisting of English Dutch and Hamburghers bound for the Streights lay waiting for a convoy in May On the nineteenth of that month orders were sent from the admiralty for the whole fleet to sail as far as might seem requisite with the merchantmen They accordingly sailed on the thirtieth and proceeded fifty leagues beyond Ushant Sir George Rooke with a squadron of twentythree men of war English and Dutch proceeded with the trade toward the Streights The main fleet after having cruized a few days in the mouth of the channel returned for want of provisions to Torbay  Burchel's Naval History    surprised by the French  Though the ministry had received no certain intelligence concerning the motions of the French the fleet commanded by Tourville had sailed from Brest in the middle of May  May  That officer directed his course toward the Streights to join the squadron expected from Toulon under D'Estrees He arrived in the bay of Lagos on the twentyeighth of the same month He lay in that place till the fifteenth of June when Rooke and the fleet under his convoy appeared The English admiral deceived by false intelligence concerning the strength of the enemy prepared to engage Perceiving his mistake he stood away with an easy sail He ordered at the same time the merchantmen nearest to the land to shift for themselves in the ports of Spain The enemy gaining fast upon him he made sail The French came up with the sternmost ships Three Dutch men of war fell into the hands of the enemy Eighty merchantmen were either taken in their flight or destroyed in ports where they had taken shelter The rest owed their escape to the bad conduct of Tourville Had he kept the wind he might have surrounded and taken the whole fleet But when the Dutch ships stood in  to the shore he tacked after them and lost the greatest opportunity of acquiring wealth and glory with ease that ever fortune threw in the way of an officer  French Accounts    Discontents  The French admiral vain of his success insulted without hurting the coast of Spain Rooke losing sight of most of the merchantmen made the best of his way to Madeira He returned from that island to Ireland and soon after rejoined the main fleet The rest of the naval campaign if the expression may be used was ingloriously inactive The admirals having cruized for a few weeks in the mouth of the channel were driven into Torbay by contrary winds They were ordered round to St Helens and the capital ships laid up for the year The victories of the enemy by land the disgrace and loss of the nation at sea the disappointment of individuals and the discontents which ever accompany national misfortunes filled the whole kingdom with complaints murmurs and noise The merchants of London presented a remonstrance rather than an address to the Queen They enumerated the hardships imposed upon trade by the want of convoys They exaggerated past evils they magnified the present they expressed their anxiety for the future This spirit of resentment spread from London to the rest of the nation In the events of the past years of the war some glory had been blended with disappointment But the present year was uniformly covered with misfortune and disgrace Disputes in the cabinet were joined to the disgusts among the people A general clamour prevailed which threatened consequences of the worst kind  Burnet vol iii Stuartpapers    Intrigues of James  In the midst of this ferment William arrived from Holland  Oct  The parliament were to meet on the seventh of November and they were supposed to be infected with those jealousies and discontents which inflamed the people The campaign had produced no event either of advantage or glory to soothe their  resentment or to flatter their pride The King himself was incapable of constraining his temper into a complaisance which with a generous people might supply the want of success  Burnet vol iii  The adherents of the late King and even that Prince himself were in the mean time extremely active in increasing the present clamours against the government He was no stranger to the impatience of the English nation under a disgrace on their own element the sea  James II  He continued his correspondence with the disaffected clergy He appointed the deprived bishop of Norwich his agent to gain his brethren He recommended to the church to obstruct the views of William in parliament He advised the Tory part of the ministry to retain their offices to increase their capacity to forward his service The Marquis of Caermarthen either disgusted with William or in hopes of profiting by the restoration of James had entered into the views of the latter Prince James requested him to betray the councils of the King and to obstruct and defeat his measures in parliament He desired him if he could depend upon his son to induce him to keep his command in the navy He instructed the Earl of Shrewsbury the Earl of Marlborough and the Lord Godolphin to exert themselves secretly against William to hinder or at least to retard the giving of money to prevent the early sailing of the sleet in the following year  Stuartpapers Oct    in England  He desired these lords to send him their advice concerning his own conduct He asked them whether he should write to the parliament Whether the King of France should publish a formal declaration that he entertained no views with regard to England except the reestablishment of her native King He desired them freely to advise him in all matters concerning their interest and his own views He requested Admiral Russel who had continued his communications with the court of St Germains to endeavour to procure the command of the fleet He desired him to suppress  his resentment for his late disgrace He intreated him to command his temper to regulate his conduct with prudence and reserve to raise no enemies that might obstruct his designs  MS Instructions to Russel Oct  The intrigues of James prevailed William fell evidently into the snare The adherents of the late King insinuated that to restore Russel to the command of the fleet was to soothe the nation for the miscarriages at sea He was accordingly replaced in his former office on the sixth of November The anxiety with which James pursued this point is as unaccountable as it is remarkable Deleval and Killegrew two out of the three joint admirals were devoted to his service  Stuartpapers Ibid  But he perhaps perceived that it was impossible for them to retain their offices in opposition to a torrent of popular clamours The first had been raised by the late King and owed every thing to that Prince The latter depended on Caermarthen who had resolved to favour a restoration  Whigs as well as Tories  Though James depended much upon the zeal of Admiral Russel he derived still greater hopes from the Marquis of Caermarthen Though that lord was in part prime minister to William he had entered into the most solemn engagements with the late King He had promised to gain to his interest the county of York of which he was lordlieutenant to surrender to him the citadel of Hull of which he was governor The want of success by land the disgraces at sea the unpopularity and forbidding manner of William his bad state of health which promised no permanency to the fabric which he had reared disappointments in some a return of their former principles in others the discontents and even levity of all had increased to a surprising degree the party of the abdicated King The Whigs were equally forward with the Tories and more dangerous as they were more resolute in their political views In the list of noble correspondents with the court of St Germains the two parties were blended with one  another in the present year James had received the most solemn assurances from four dukes four marquises twenty earls four viscounts eleven barons beside the Roman Catholics in every degree of nobility  most of the clergy many in the army  The whole body of the nonjuring clergy consisting of six bishops and six hundred ministers and four fifths of those who had taken the oaths were ready to join the late King to preach in favour of his authority to convince the people that the Protestant religion was in no danger The cities of Bristol and Exeter in the West and in the North the town of Boston had signified their loyalty to James through their respective leaders The Earl of Yarmouth in the name of seventeen baronets and one hundred and thirty gentlemen promised for the county of Norfolk The gentlemen of Essex assured the late King that they would join him with a body of cavalry at a proper time The Earl of Litchfield promised for the county and city of Oxford The Earl of Lindsey for the county of Lincoln Sir John Friend answered for a regiment of cavalry and two of militia with which he hoped to possess himself of the Tower  Stuart papers Oct Nov Dec  Colonel Selwin promised for Tilbury fort and a regiment of infantry Lieutenantcolonel Row for his own regiment Colonel Greenville for that of his uncle the Earl of Bath Crawford governor of Sheerness undertook to deliver that fort to James The Marquis of Caermathen then president of the council promised for Hull The private soldiers in some regiments had formed associations for the late King One hundred troopers of the royal regiment of cavalry acquainted him that they had sufficient credit with their companions to bring back the whole to their former allegiance They even solemnly undertook to  "cut the throats"  of such of their comrades and officers as should dare to oppose their design In the north of England seven regiments of cavalry and dragoons  were privately listed under officers bearing commissions from the late King  Stuartpapers passim James II    his former greatest enemies and those who  It is remarkable that those who had been the most violent enemies of James when he was on the throne were his most zealous friends in his distress The county of Somerset the seat of Monmouth's rebellion and Jefferys's cruelties was now ready to receive him with open arms The town of Taunton itself that had suffered so much eight years before for opposing James expressed the greatest affection for his person and the warmest zeal for his restoration The legal severities of the year must therefore have been exaggerated or the people acquitted the King of the rigorous conduct of his servants The Lord Powlet and the majority of the gentlemen of the county together with the citizens of Taunton solemnly engaged themselves to James to rise in his cause Even individuals were as unsteady to their former principles as bodies of men The famous Ferguson who had uniformly abetted the opposition to the late King till he lost his throne employed at this time all the vehemence of his active spirit in his cause He requested he even implored him to invade the kingdom To testify his own zeal to encourage James with a certainty of his success he proposed to deliver himself up in France to be punished with death should the enterprise fail Some of the clergy who had most opposed James ran so violently into the other extreme that they were determined to form themselves into a company of volunteers to serve in the regiment commanded by Sir John Friend  Stuartpapers    betrayed him before are in his interest  The zeal of the clergy proceeded from their high principles in favour of monarchy But to what principle can be ascribed the relentings of the Earl of Sunderland That nobleman who had hurried James into his worst measures to accomplish his ruin endeavoured by the like conduct to place him again on the throne William having distinguished Sunderland with his favour for former services furnished that  lord a second time with an opportunity to betray Having with his usual address convinced the adherents of King James of the sincerity of his repentance he wrote a letter full of contrition for his past conduct to that Prince He told him that a descent with a competent force was the only means of finishing the misfortunes of the King and the miseries of the nation He informed him that from the state of the kingdom an invasion could not fail of success He declined to enter into particulars because he was afraid his Majesty did not confide sufficiently in his advice But when he should be assured that the King was satisfied with his fidelity he promised to send the best intelligence and to contribute all in his power to his service The Earl of Arran vouched for the sincerity of Sunderland The Earl of Marlborough pleaded in his favour But James had felt so much from his treachery before that even his pursuing the natural bias of his mind with regard to William could not convince him for some time that Sunderland was sincere  Stuartpapers    Parliament meets  Such was the secret state of affairs before and some time after the two houses met for the dispatch of the public business William opened the session on the seventh of November with a speech from the throne He lamented that his usual joy at meeting his parliament was damped by disadvantages by land and miscarriages at sea He ascribed the former to the number of their enemies He expressed his resentment against the authors of the latter He declared his resolution to punish the offenders He promised to manage better for the future his power at sea He desired them to consider whether the kingdom was not defective in the number of ships and in proper ports to annoy the enemy and to protect themselves He was very sensible he said of the great affection with which they had supported him against his enemies But he was persuaded that the experience of the last summer was sufficient to convince them all that an increase of forces by sea and land was necessary to put a happy period to the war His allies he said  had resolved to add to their troops He formed no doubt on his part but his parliament would enable him with a suitable supply to follow their example He earnestly requested the commons to hasten their grants in order to render them effectual On their expeditious councils would depend he concluded that forwardness in his preparations which seemed necessary to the security and honour of the nation  Journals Nov    Proceedings of the commons  Many in the lower house were attached to the late King But the majority though tories in principle had uniformly supported the cause of William The people discouraged with repeated misfortunes and feeling the weight of the war on every branch of their commerce were loud in demanding peace Some of the Toryleaders in office particularly the Earl of Nottingham joined the voice of the people Others of the same party sacrificed their opinion to their interest and adhered to the court A dispute arose in the house whether the miscarriages of the fleet or the supply should be the first object of their consideration The question was carried for the latter after a series of debates which continued six days On the thirteenth of November the house unanimously resolved to support their Majesties and their government to their utmost power Notwithstanding the vast sums raised in the preceding year they had greatly fallen short of the expences of government Those who served in the army were in the utmost distress for money More than one million of the wages of the seamen without any funds remained unpaid Though the greatest severities were used the sailors in their distress became mutinous for want of pay The first business therefore of the commons was to grant four hundred thousand pounds by way of advance to remove immediately a part of that grievance This sum was to be raised on the general credit of the exchequer upon the promise of the commons to repay it with interest after the rate of seven per cent under a caution that this proceeding should form no precedent  Journals Nov    They grant large supplies  WITH equal alacrity the commons entered upon the great business of supply Upon the general estimates of the navy and army they granted five millions for the service of the following year Forty thousand seamen including two regiments of marines were required by government and voted by the house But to a demand of one hundred thousand men for the landservice they granted only eightythree thousand In this only they seemed uncomplaisant to the court Besides a provision made for paying all wages due to seamen more than four hundred thousand pounds were voted for making up the deficiencies in the grants of the preceding year It was much more easy to grant the supplies in general than to find particular funds upon which they might be laid The commons began with a landtax Four shillings in the pound were carried as soon as proposed  Dec Dec  The deficiencies of the last year were to be defrayed from this ready fund The second money bill was a supplement to the million annuity act of the year Near one hundred and twenty thousand pounds were still deficient though fourteen per cent had been allowed Some appropriations of excise duties were made for this purpose The first lottery and the bank of England were two remarkable moneybills in the present session of parliament One million was raised by means of the first and one million five hundred thousand pounds by the second Still the ways and means fell short of the money wanted New taxes were imposed and appropriated as funds of credit for raising the deficiencies which still subsisted in the necessary supplies  Journals passim    Other proceedings  THE inquiry into the mismanagements at sea produced nothing but altercation and debate A general censure was passed But the censure was attended with no consequences The malcontents in the house of commons being the minority founded their opposition on popular grounds The bill for frequent parliaments was again introduced and a second time rejected The placebill was passed by the commons without  opposition The lords made amendments But they withdrew them and passed also that important bill The facility with which it slipt through both houses proceeded probably from the certainty that it was to be rejected by the King The commons had become unpopular through the vast sums which they had granted for supporting an inglorious war To regain their credit with their constituents they framed the placebill William seldom subject to political terror refused his assent  Jan th  Though the commons in all appearance would have been much disappointed had the placebill passed into a law they remonstrated against the conduct of the King They voted that whoever had advised the refusal of the royal assent to the act touching free and impartial proceedings in parliament was an enemy to their Majesties and the kingdom The King's answer was soothing but nothing to the purpose In return for their liberality he permitted his commons to recover some part of their reputation with the people at his own expence  Stuartpapers    of the two houses  THE affairs of the EastIndia company which had already employed so much of the attention of parliament produced undecisive debates in the present session The train of corruption which soon after broke forth in such disgraceful discoveries had been already laid The complicated nature of the business and the violent opposition of the merchants prevented the friends of the company from making an immediate return for the favours which they had desired to receive A bill for a general naturalization of all foreign Protestants created violent debates in the house of commons Those who opposed it called the prejudices of the populace to the aid of their cause They averred that the design of the act was to place all the power and authority in England in the hands of Aliens The people knew the affection of the King for his countrymen the Dutch They believed that he would sooner trust any foreigners than his own subjects The Jacobite party in particular were vehement in their  opposition Sir John Knight one of the members for the city of Bristol who was at that very time in correspondence with James  Stuartpapers  spoke with uncommon violence against the bill He concluded with a motion that the bill should be kicked out of the house and the foreigners out of the kingdom The people were inflamed to a degree of madness and the courtparty sacrificed the bill to the public rage  of parliament  To pursue the session to its period we must transgress upon the order of time The grievances of Ireland were again revived as they had not been redressed in pursuance of the King's promise The Irish gentlemen who had made their appeal to the English parliament complained afresh of Coningsby and Porter whose injustice and tyranny had exceeded all bounds The Earl of Bellamont impeached them both in the house of commons The articles against Coningsby contained charges of the blackest kind The accusation against Porter was scarce less severe Bellamont supported with vouchers every charge The commons seemed convinced of the guilt But they declined to ground upon them an impeachment The reason which they assigned was plausible if not sufficient They insinuated that in times of domestic commotions and civil war exertions of power might be necessary which should not be punished though they ought not to be approved Though this argument satisfied the commons it was notorious that the crimes charged upon the accused were committed after the establishment of a civil government and the opening of the courts of Justice Bellamont for endeavouring to punish others was actually persecuted himself He was deprived of his place under the government while Coningsby and Porter received a pardon under the great seal  Journals passim  The session ended with a speech from the throne on the sixteenth of April  CHAP II  Secret intriguesOf MarlboroughRusselShrewsburyGodolphinSunderlandWhigs

representations in the preceding year agreed that thirty thousand men would be necessary to ensure a revolution in England When they perceived a coldness in the court of France they lessened their demands In the month of February they assured James that they found his party much stronger than they had ever imagined before They said twenty thousand men would now be sufficient to give him without a battle the throne They affirmed that the nation expected with impatience his arrival They told him that England could not till the month of April send to sea above twentyfive third and fourth rate men of war and these not completely manned That no more than seven thousand five hundred troops were then in the kingdom and that even these would be diminished to four thousand when the regiments destined for Flanders should embark for that country  Ibid Feb  Lewis listened with some attention to the unfortunate King But he meant nothing less than to undertake with any vigour his cause Though victorious in the field he was oppressed with calamities at home Having exerted his whole force in the late campaigns he had already impoverished his subjects with grievous taxes Besides a terrible famine had added in the preceding summer to the miseries which arose from the war  Hist de France tom iii    Intrigues of Marlborough  But James was not discouraged either with the langour of Lewis or the exhausted state of France Though he placed little confidence  Stuartpapers March James II  in the professions of the noble converts to his cause he sent Captain Lloyd in the month of March to England To facilitate  his access to Admiral Russel and to the Earls of Marlborough and Shrewsbury he ordered him to apply to Colonel Sackville their common friend Marlborough was the first of the malcontents who presented himself to Lloyd He informed him that he had been solicited by William to come again into office But that he did not chuse to accept without the consent of his old master Lloyd assured him that James had actually heard of the offer and that he had ordered him to signify his consent "The thing" replied Marlborough  "is now past Should the offer which may well happen again be made I will accept But it is only to serve the King for whose reestablishment I am resolved to risque my life to expiate my crimes  Stuartpapers March James II  "  He had made the same professions to James himself in a letter in the preceding December Admiral Russel received Lloyd with still greater marks of attention and regard He assured him with the strongest asseverations and even with oaths that he would undertake the restoration of the late King He promised to endeavour to gain the officers of the fleet He reiterated his most solemn protestations of fidelity He told him that the Earls of Shrewsbury and Marlborough should be the winesses the judges and sureties of his conduct He however refused to avoid the French fleet "though" said he  "I once determined to execute that business as it depended then on myself alone  Ibid  "  Russel  Lloyd not yet satisfied with the answer of Russel opened various expedients to his view He told him that there certainly was a design in agitation for making a descent on the coast of France He therefore requested Russel to send timely information to James that transports might be prepared where no attack could be feared He proposed that toward the end of autumn when the large ships should be disarmed and convoys sent to America he might retain in the channel such commanders as he should gain in the summer That safe in their fidelity he might himself  transport such troops as might be necessary for accompanying the late King to England He still protested but seemed unwilling to determine on any plan Lloyd gave an account to the Earl of Marlborough and to Sackville of his conference with Russel They observed that he said a great deal could he be trusted But that if he was not sincere all he could say would answer no purpose  Stuartpapers passim    Shrewsbury  The Earl of Shrewsbury had succeeded Nottingham as secretary of state on the fourth of March a few days before Lloyd arrived from France His being in office prevented him from admitting into his presence the avowed agent of the late King He however sent his mother the old Countess of Shrewsbury to Lloyd with assurances of his fidelity He instructed her to inform him that upon being solicited to take the seals he declined that honour under the pretence of want of health That William insinuated he was no stranger to some words which the earl dropt in conversation in favour of the late King That the earl perceived there might be some danger in refusing the offer That he therefore promised to accept But that he requested a few days to settle his affairs in the country That he accordingly retired with some friends well mounted That as reports of an immediate descent were then current he had resolved to join James on his landing That he was disappointed in his hopes to his very great regret That he was obliged to take the seals on his return But that he only held them to serve the late King with more effect  Ibid March    Godolphin  Godolphin was at this juncture first lordcommissioner of the treasury Though he was trusted by William he affected to be in the interest of the late King He explained to Lloyd his sentiments of James in the most affectionate manner in the world He expressed his fears that a peace was likely to be concluded before the end of the next summer He told him that he was sorry to believe from the words of the Prince of Orange for so he called the reigning  King that the terms would be highly prejudicial to the late King He informed him that William would endeavour to oblige the most Christian King to send James out of the dominions of France That he thought it his duty to acquaint his old master of the designs of his enemy and rival He told it as his opinion that King James should forthwith endeavour to transport himself into England with a considerable force That there appeared to him no difficulty in making a descent in this kingdom without either the aid or concurrence of Russel That however he ought still to be treated with attention That he had said all that could be expected from a person in his situation That the Earl of Shrewsbury who was sincerely in the interest of the late King possessed an absolute influence over Russel He assured Lloyd that Russel would infallibly appear before Brest That this circumstance would give a just pretence to Lewis to send an army to the coast He advised therefore that the necessary transports might be prepared in the summer to carry to Britain the invaders in autumn He told him that the large vessels would return to port in the middle of September That the sailors would be dispersed the convoys sent to the different places of commerce the coast left bare of men of war That he believed a revolution might be effected without a blow as nine in ten of the people either heartily detested William or were firmly attached to the late King  Stuartpapers March    Sunderland  Though the Earl of Sunderland possessed no office under William he held for an Englishman a high place in his favour Swayed by the natural levity of his own mind or infected with the changed opinions of others he continued his correspondence with the late King He however was more guarded in his intercourse with that Prince than those great men who trusted their lives and fortunes in the hands of intermediate agents His soninlaw the Earl of Arran who first promoted his intrigues with the court of St Germains was the only person in the secret in  Britain  Stuartpapers March  In France James concealed with great caution his intercourse with a man who had so much injured his cause before Sunderland pressed the late King to an immediate invasion upon various grounds He intreated that Prince to take advantage of the changed opinions of the people their contempt for William their discontent at the late heavy taxes their losses at sea their disappointments in the war by land These circumstances he informed him would ensure a favourable reception to himself in the kingdom while the design of sending the greatest part of the fleet to the Streights and almost the whole of the army to Flanders would render his passage easy and his success certain He advised the late King not to be intimidated with the great supplies granted to the reigning Prince as the money given by the parliament could not be raised in time to place the kingdom in a state of defence  Stuartpapers    Whigs and Tories promiscuously in office  While Sunderland tendered thus his advice to James HE and the Earl of Portland formed the secret cabinet of William  Dutch encroachments p  That Prince felt some part of the misfortunes which he had contributed to throw on his predecessor when he sat on the throne He was worst served by those whom he courted the most Impressed with the opinion that interest forms the principles of men he resolved to bribe into fidelity those whom he could not otherwise trust In the arrangements of the present year he seems however to have regarded most the supposed Whigs The admiralty in particular was placed in the hands of that party Russel was made first commissioner Rook and Houblon supplanted the obnoxious admirals Delaval and Killigrew at the board Though William seems to have entertained some wellgrounded suspicions of Shrewsbury he was accounted a Whig by the nation and though the Marquis of Caermarthen was considered a Tory by principle his known prudence was deemed a security for his faith to the prevailing powers But some other persons of rank who were  known to be adverse to the late revolution were either continued in employment or raised to office Among the latter the Earl of Abingdon then actually in correspondence with James succeeded to a place of profit vacant by the death of the Lord Lovelace  Gazette    Titles conferred  On the twentyfifth of April a few days after he prorogued his parliament William went to Gravesend to embark at that place for Holland The wind proving contrary he returned to Kensington the next day This accident furnished the King with a further opportunity of gratifying some of his principal subjects with dignities and honours But though he had of late shown some attention to the Whigs his first care seems still to have been commanded by the Tories The Marquis of Caermarthen was created on the thirtieth of April Duke of Leeds The title of Duke of Shrewsbury was conferred upon the Earl of the same name The Earl of Clare then deeply engaged with James  Stuartpapers  was raised to the dignity of Duke of Newcastle The Earl of Mulgrave a secret abettor of the designs of the late King  Ibid  was made Marquis of Normanby with an annual pension of three thousand pounds But no titles of honour nor even views of profit could reconcile these men either to the manner or title of the King Shrewsbury and Leeds whose advice Mary was implicitly to follow in her husband's absence were to have embarrassed and betrayed her councils should her father appear with a force in England  Ibid  To stop their clamours rather than to gratify the party who had raised him to the throne the King before his departure for Holland had ordered patents for dukedoms to be prepared for the Earls of Bedford and Devonshire The first derived his title to a name in party from the fate of his unfortunate son Disappointments in his views for the public as well as personal neglect had rendered the latter indifferent concerning the fate of William and the permanency of his authority  Ibid    Preparations at Sea  On the fourth of May the King embarked at Gravesend But the wind being contrary he went by land to Margate and was escorted from that place to Holland by a squadron of Dutch men of war The projected operations of the summer at sea had employed a great part of his attention during the winter His councils however were betrayed The destinations of the different squadrons were generally known  Stuart papers  Nothing but the time of their departure which depended upon accidents remained a secret Sir Francis Wheeler with a strong squadron of English and Dutch men of war had been sent to convoy the trade to the Mediterranean in the end of the preceding year On the seventeenth of February a terrible tempest overtook his fleet in the bay of Gibraltar The admiral himself some ships of war and several merchantmen were lost The rest were disabled Some took shelter in Gibraltar many in the harbour of Cadiz The combined fleets were not assembled on the coast of England till the end of April Russel hoisted his flag at Portsmouth on the twentyseventh of that month and his avowed design was to sail into the Mediterranean to defend the ports of Spain from the French who were resolved to make the principal effort of the campaign on that side  Burnet vol iii    An expedition against Brest  But the chief enterprise of the season was to be directed against Brest The lord Godolphin had furnished the late King in the month of March with this important intelligence  Stuartpapers  But from the uncertainty which attended the sailing of the fleet he could not fix the time General Talmash contrary to the express opinion of Russel promoted first and at length carried this design When the admiral hoisted his flag at St Helens the landforces destined for the expedition were on their march under Talmash to Portsmouth The French had made no secret of their resolution to assist with their whole fleet the designs of the Mareschal de Noailles upon Barcelona The court of Spain had concerted with William to send  the main body of the combined fleet to protect the place Men in general believed that the force under Talmash was destined for the same service The French were either ignorant of the preparations of the English or they knew not where the storm was to fall The alarm concerning Brest which had been raised by the intelligence sent by Godolphin to James had already subsided Besides the danger of France upon that side had been lessened by the actual sailing of her fleet from the port of Brest on the fifteenth of April  April th N S    Betrayed by the Earl of Marlborough May th  The zeal of the Earl of Marlborough for the service of the late King or his aversion to the reigning Prince induced that nobleman to become upon this occasion an informer against his country He transmitted through the hands of colonel Sackville intelligence of the danger to which France was exposed His letter was dated on the fourth of May He informed James that twelve regiments encamped at Portsmouth with two regiments of marines all commanded by Talmash were designed for destroying Brest and the ships of war in that harbour He owned that success in the enterprise would prove of great advantage to England But that no consideration could now hinder or ever should prevent him from informing his Majesty of all that he believed to be for his service He desired the late King to make the best use of the intelligence He told him that he might depend on its being exactly true But he conjured him for his own interest to keep the secret to himself and the Queen He informed him that Russel was to sail the next day with forty ships and that the rest of the fleet with the landforces were to follow the admiral in ten days He had endeavoured he said to learn the whole from Russel But he always denied the fact though he was no stranger to the design for six weeks before "This" continues the Earl  "gives me a bad sign of this man's intentions"  Sackville who transmitted the letter formed for the same reason a like unfavourable opinion of Russel  He mentioned  "that THE MAN had not acted sincerely and that he feared he would never act otherwise  Stuartpapers May James II  "  The enterprise miscarries  The event established the truth of the intelligence transmitted by Marlborough Russel sailed the next day with a part of the combined fleets Shovel remained at St Helens with the rest to take Talmash and his troops on board On the twentythird of May the admiral having discovered that the French squadron had left Brest returned On the twentyninth he again put to sea with the forces and on the fifth of June the division of the fleet destined to attack Brest bore down for Camaret Bay under the command of the Lord Berkley Nine hundred men were landed in a disorderly manner on the eighth of June under the fire of some men of war The bay was lined with entrenchments which were full of the French marines The English having for some time sustained the fire of the enemy suffered much and were forced to fly To add to the misfortune it was now ebbing tide and several boats were left dry on the sand Confusion and slaughter prevailed Six hundred were slain many were drowned Talmash himself received a wound of which he afterwards died at Plymouth The ships which covered the landing were shattered by the batteries which guarded the shore One Dutch frigate was sunk after losing almost her whole crew The French had profited so much by the intelligence of Marlborough that the English chose to return without any further attempt to their own coast  Burnet Marq of Caermarthen's Journal    This disgrace at sea was not repaired by any splendid advantage obtained by land The French standing on the defensive in Flanders amused William with dextrous movements throughout the summer With scarce half the force of the allies the Dauphin assisted by the Mareschal de Luxembourg covered from insult the French lines The King was forced to remain in a state of inactivity with the finest army he  had ever brought into the field The rapid movement of the French from Vignamont was the most signal event of the whole campaign Having marched forty leagues in four days they formed an impenetrable line from the Lys to the ocean and prevented William from attacking by land the maritime places which his fleet had insulted by sea He however found means to besiege and take the town and castle of Huy He ended the campaign with this exploit and left the army on the thirtieth of September To stop the progress of the King on the side of Flanders was deemed equal to a victory by the court of Versailles The confederates had never a nearer prospect of success But their hopes were defeated by the abilities of the Mareschal de Luxembourg  Hist de France vol iii Kennet Ralph    In Spain  While the war languished in Flanders the French pushed their operations with vigour on the side of Spain In Catalonia the Mareschal de Noailles having forced the passage of the river Ter defeated the Spanish army entrenched on the further shore He took Palamos by assault on the seventh of June Gironne and Ostalric fell successively into his hands His designs upon Barcelona were defeated by the arrival of Russel with the combined fleet in the neighbouring seas Tourville with his squadron was blocked up in the port of Toulon The absence of their ships stopt the progress of the French But a panic had seized the King and shaken the councils of Spain The Queenmother a daughter of Austria and devoted to the views of her family prevented Charles the second from soliciting peace on advantageous terms Intrigue jealousy and even murder prevailed at court The Queenmother gained the young Queen by supporting her supposed lover the Baron de Perlis The Duke d'Ossona who alone remained faithful to the interest of his master was poisoned and the public measures were distracted between  the feeble efforts of a weak monarch and a faction devoted to the court of Vienna  Hist d'Espagne tom ii    Other military transactions  In Piedmont the campaign was inactive Nothing of moment happened upon the UpperRhine The Duke of Savoy was employed in secret negociations with France The Emperor made his chief effort on the side of Hungary The war in that country produced no striking event But the Poles in alliance with the Imperialists defeated the Tartars on the Neister in the month of October  Oct  The operations of the combined fleets in the ocean after the fruitless attempt upon Brest were either languid or illdirected The lord Berkley bombarded Diep  Ju+ly  with some effect He was not equally successful at Havre He proceeded from thence to La Hogue and Cherbourg But his progress was more a matter of parade than service William anxious to make an impression on France on the side of Flanders had recommended an attempt upon Dunkirk and Calais in the course of the summer A squadron under the command of Sir Cloudsley Shovel and subject to the directions of one Meesters a Dutchman came before the first of those places on the twelfth of September This man had invented a machine which from the fury of its discharge was called the  Infernal  Two of these machines were sent in against the fort which guarded the Risbank The first blew up without effect the latter spent its effect on itself and was destroyed The attempt on Calais  July  was equally unsuccessful and thus the naval campaign in the ocean especially if the expression may be used produced neither glory nor advantage to the nation  Burchit    King arrives Parliament meete  The King having left the army on the last day of September repaired to his favourite residence at Loo On the twentythird of October he departed from that place Having adjusted at the Hague the state of the war for the ensuing year he set sail from the Maese on the eighth of November and landed at Margate the next day The Queen met him at Rochester  and they arrived at Kensington on the tenth in the evening amidst the acclamations of the populace The parliament after repeated prorogations met on the twelfth at Westminster The King informed them in his speech that he was glad to meet them in such a good posture of the public affairs He told them that the enemy had not been in a condition to meet the fleet in these seas That the great force sent into the Mediterranean had broken all their designs in Spain and that an effectual stop had been put to the progress of the French arms on the side of Flanders He doubted not he said neither their affection for his person nor their zeal for the public service He therefore demanded such supplies as might enable him to prosecute the war with that vigour which was the only means for procuring peace He put them in mind that the act of tonnage and poundage was to expire at Christmas and that the great anticipations had rendered that revenue necessary for the support of the crown  Journals Nov    A supply granted  The commons declining to proceed to business adjourned themselves for seven days The plan of government was either not settled or the heads of the opposing party were to be sounded and gained A bill for frequent parliaments which has since obtained the name of the triennial bill seems to have been the price of the demanded supplies The absolute necessity of a frequency of parliaments had been asserted in the declaration of rights But the demands of the subject on this important point had been expressed in such indefinite terms that they had been hitherto eluded with ease by the crown The measure was prosecuted with such an appearance of firmness that the court party chose to comply The bill was accordingly prepared  Ibid Nov  and it was followed with a vote of supply  Nov  Two millions and near four hundred thousand pounds were granted for the service of the navy  Dec  and the like sum to support the army throughout the ensuing year The house voted that  the subsidies of tonnage and poundage which expired on the twentyfourth of December should begin from the twentysixth and continue for five years The discontinuing of these duties for one day was intended to prevent the pretence of prescription on the side of the crown for revenues which ought to be considered as the free gift of the subject  Triennial bill  The King came to the house of lords on the twentysecond of December and gave the royal assent to the triennial bill Two reasons  Burnet vol iii  seem to have combined to induce William to give his concurrence to an act which he had defeated the preceding year The commons he found were resolved to receive this concession from the crown as the price of a supply for the war Besides the Queen had been taken ill of the smallpox the day before with incurable symptoms of that dangerous disease He was unwilling therefore by an exertion of the prerogative to shake his influence with the nation which would necessarily be weakened by the event of her death His prudence only could in this instance overcome his attachment to what he deemed to be the inherent right of the crown The commons however in asserting the liberties of the subject appeared not to have neglected themselves In the second clause of the bill they implied the continuance of the parliament then subsisting for three years This selfish provision was not passed without censure in the house of peers Some lords at the last reading protested against the bill as tending to the continuance of the present parliament longer than was agreeable to the constitution of England  Journals of the Lorde Dec    Death and character of the Queen  The distemper of the Queen from bad symptoms advanced rapidly to worse till it terminated in her death on the twentyeighth of December Her figure her manner her affability the decency of he  carriage and equality of her temper rendered he  sincerely and generally beloved by a people ever fo  of the virtues of their princes In her person sh  was tall and graceful full proportioned and easy in all her motions Though her complexion was not fair the lineaments of her face were regular and wellcombined A lively and piercing eye threw such a pleasing light on her countenance that she even might be called a woman of beauty The genuine features of her mind are difficult to be traced as her passions were neither uncommon in their kind nor strong in their degree A strict attention to her husband and even an absolute subserviency to his will seem to have been more the rule of her life than those more majestic virtues which alone could thoroughly justify her political conduct When she held the reins of government she displayed more prudence than ability and less of art than solidity of judgment Unambitious in her disposition and subdued in her youth to obedience she was ever uneasy under the weight of power and she always resigned her authority not only with indifference but even with pleasure Her private virtues in short were chiefly conjugal She was not a kind sister None will say that she was an affectionate child Her situation it must be confessed was cruel and difficult It was only through a breach of the ties of nature she could become at all an object of public applause  Grief of William  Though William was neither a fond husband nor subject to feelings of a delicate kind he exhibited every symptom of an unfeigned grief upon the death of the Queen Her amiable manner and an habitual attention to all his commands had it seems made an impression on his mind which he had not cared to own Besides gratitude had perhaps supplied the place of a warm affection in his breast The Queen certainly deserved every return of friendship at HIS hands She had acted in all respects toward him as if virtue consisted solely in the implicit obedience of a wife to her husband Motives of policy might also have joined their force to more tender sentiments in his mind The whole popularity of his measures proceeded from the open and agreeable deportment of Mary Many considered her as having the only natural right to the crown His own manner when at its  best procured more respect than affection and he therefore had sufficient reason to lament the loss of a consort whose influence had so much contributed to reconcile the people to his government But whatever motive weighed most with the mind of William his prudence might have been trusted as to the sincerity of his grief  Conduct of the Princess of Denmark  The city of London the two houses of parliament the nation in general expressed in warm addresses to the throne their sense of the merit of Mary and their own sorrow The Princess of Denmark was induced by the Earl of Sunderland to send a letter of condolence on the death of her sister to the King This Princess even before her disgrace in the year had begun a secret correspondence with her father But having now obtained a nearer prospect of the crown she was easily induced to adopt an appearance of reconciliation with William His prudence dictated that he ought to meet her halfway He was apprehensive that she might carry her resentment for former injuries to a pitch that might prove uneasy to his government if not dangerous to his power She was the next heir by act of parliament She was nearer than William himself by the title of blood He was sensible that many had been restrained by their deference to Mary as the daughter of the late King and he was certain that at least the discontented would pay their court with more diligence to the Princess should he permit her to remain in a state of proscription from his favour He therefore admitted her into his presence presented her with most of her sister's jewels and conferred upon her some other favours more from political views than any affection for her person  Burnet Dutchess of Marlborough    Reflections of James on the death of Mary  Mary was scarcely considered as a partner in the regal authority during her life Her death therefore  produced no material change Some doubts arose  whether the parliament was not dissolved by her de+mise But the question was scarce proposed in th  house of lords when it was dropt as unfit to be de+bated  Burnet vol iii    The late King declined to make any efforts for his restoration upon the present occasion He conceived hopes that a government which he thought depended upon the popularity of his daughter would shake and unhinge itself by her decease He was much affected by the intelligence But his sorrow was more that of an enthusiast than a father He was rather grieved at her manner of dying than at her death  "The King"  said that unfortunate Prince  "received this additional affliction to those which he had already undergone He saw a child whom he tenderly loved persevering to her death in a signal state of disobedience and disloyalty He perceived that she was extolled for a crime as for the highest merit He heard her contradictions called virtues and her breach of duty to a parent a becoming sacrifice to her religion and her country  James H  "  Such were the reflections of James upon the death of a daughter whose behaviour to a parent could scarce be justified by his own conduct  Proceedings of parliament  The death of the Queen though alarming to the nation interrupted not the course of business in parliament A remarkable transaction in the preceding summer and autumn was laid before the commons early in the present session One Lunt a person of a very profligate character who had once been a daylabourer at Highgate gave information on the fifteenth of June concerning a plot for levying war against the government He affirmed that he had delivered commissions from the late King to several gentlemen in Lancashire and Cheshire That at their instance and expence he had bought arms and enlisted men That he had been twice sent to France to receive the commands of James concerning the intended insurrection and that one Wilson who had assisted him in delivering the commissions was privy to the circumstances of the plot The supposed conspirators were seized They were brought to London and then remanded to Manchester to take their trials Lunt and Wilson swore to the truth of the information  But Lunt being ordered in court to point at the several prisoners mistook his men This created a violent suspicion of perjury and at the instant one Taffe who had been acquainted with Lunt declared publickly that the whole plot was nothing but a villanous contrivance fabricated between himself and that profligate witness The King's council stopt all proceedings The prisoners were acquitted and the popular clamour became so loud in favour of the accused that the ministry found it necessary to commit their witnesses to prison and to order them to be prosecuted  Trial Kennet vol iii Ralph vol ii Auct cirat passim    on the Lancashire plot  Though the most of the persons accused were attached to the late King and some of them actually plotting for his service the information of Lunt and his associates seems to have had no foundation in fact The whole appears to have been framed by the intrigues and precipitate zeal of one Johnston a Scotsman brother to the secretary of state of that name This busy and selfinterested man had in the hopes of a gratification from William long acted the part of an informer against the Jacobites in England as well as in Scotland He had employed every mean art to circumvent the unwary and to find evidence against the accused  Johnston's Letters to Carstares  The victory obtained by the gentlemen of Lancashire over the witnesses of government in a court of justice induced them to lay their grievances before the parliament The result of the deliberations of the commons answered not their hopes on the subject They voted that there had been sufficient grounds for the prosecution and trial of the conspirators at Manchester and that a dangerous plot had been carried on against the King and government Notwithstanding these resolutions the witnesses were tried and found guilty of perjury at the Lancaster assizes They were afterwards  Aug  indicted for a conspiracy against the lives and estates of the accused  gentlemen But the prosecution was dropt and Lunt and Wilson were discharged  An inquiry into abuses  The popularity of passing the triennial bill into a law secured not William from an opposition in parliament The commons ordered a state of the loans debts and charges upon the revenue together with an account of the expence of the civil list to be laid before their house  Journals January th  They opened the same day a channel of inquiry into abuses and corruptions which led to important but disgraceful discoveries of the venality of the times Upon a petition of the inhabitants of Royston against the violence and exactions of the soldiery the house came to some spirited votes They resolved that the officers and soldiers demanding and exacting subsistencemoney in their quarters or on a march was arbitrary and illegal and a great violation of the rights of the subjects Some agents who by defrauding the soldiers of their pay had forced them into violences were committed by the command of the house Guy secretary of the treasury the known instrument of the crown in purchasing yotes in parliament was sent to the Tower for taking a bribe for himself  Ibid Feb  They addressed the King against colonel Hastings for his acts of avarice and violence against his regiment and that officer was instantly discharged from his command A bill was ordered in the mean time to oblige the agents of the regiments to account for the disposal of the money which they had received  Ibid    The speaker expelled for corruption  This detection of flagrant abuses established a wellfounded opinion that the court the camp the city and even the parliament were infected with one general contagion of bribery corruption and venality The commons to extricate themselves from their part of the aspersion resolved to proceed in their inquiry The unsuccessful attempts made by the city of London to carry the orphans' bill into a law and the facility with which it had been lately passed created suspicious of corrupt practices upon that head A committee  was appointed to inspect the chamberlain's books They made their report on the seventh of March Several sums of money appeared to have been expended in gaining votes in parliament The line of corruption was traced to the speaker himself The house went immediately into debate on the subject They soon came to the resolution  "That Sir John Trevor speaker of the house by receiving a gratuity of one thousand guineas from the city of London after passing the orphans' bill was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour"  He had the mortification to put this humiliating question to the house He retired under the pretence of a colick He signified his demission to the King and was expelled from his seat in parliament  Journals March    Corrupt practices in India affairs  The commons from this shameful scene of detection turned their inquiries to another quarter The affairs of the EastIndia company had employed a great portion of the attention of parliament from the year till the end of The company had declined to submit to the regulations proposed by the commons They even frustrated all the endeavours of that assembly by procuring a new charter from the King The house suspected corruption upon the present occasion and they ordered the same committee who had examined the books of the chamberlain to inspect those of the EastIndia company The abstracts of the sums paid for special services since the Revolution soon led to the discovery so much required In the reign of James the annual charges scarce exceeded twelve hundred pounds Ever since they had gradually increased In the year they were very considerable But in the year when the charter was obtained they amounted to near ninety thousand pounds which had been lent on the notes of Sir Thomas Cooke the governor of the company Cooke was called before the house He resused to account for the money He was immediately committed to the Tower and a bill ordered to be brought in to oblige him to make a discovery The  bill passed in a few days and was sent up to the lords for their concurrence  Journals March    detected  The Duke of Leeds so often mentioned by the progressive titles of Sir Thomas Osborne the Lord Latimer the Earl of Danby and Marquis of Caermarthen by the vehemence of his zeal for Cooke rendered his own honour suspected The protestations of his innocence with which he blended his speech against the bill were considered as so many acknowledgments of guilt in a man more remarkable for his talents than either for his integrity or disinterestedness The house yielding either to his arguments or influence postponed the business from the sixth to the thirteenth of April a point of consequence as the session was known to draw near to its close Cooke was brought before the lords on the thirteenth He declared himself willing to make a full discovery on condition of being indemnified against all actions and suits except those of the EastIndia company whom he had never injured The peers resolved to drop the bill of pains and penalties sent up from the commons and they ordered a committee to withdraw to form such a bill of indemnification as Cooke required The commons amended the bill with a penal clause The lords agreed to the amendment and Cooke was directed by the act to make a full discovery to a joint committee of peers and commons on or before the twentythird of April  Journals passim    by the commons  Some in both houses were eager in the prosecution of the affair But from the loss of time the majority seemed determined to defeat a measure which common decency forbade them to drop entirely The King himself appeared to be no great friend to a discovery which threatened to involve himself in the same scene of corruption with his servants When he came to the house on the twentysecond of April to pass several bills he recommended dispatch to his parliament as he was determined to put an end to the session in a few days The joint committee of lords and commons met at the exchequer chamber Cooke  appeared before them and delivered a paper containing an unsatisfactory discovery Several persons privy to the transaction were examined Ten thousand pounds were traced to the King five thousand to the Duke of Leeds and other sums to other men in power The scene of corruption appeared to be as extensive as it was shameful and uncommon The matter was reported on the twentyseventh of April to both houses The commons in particular flew into a violent flame The innocent were eager to shew their own regard to honour The consciously criminal erdeavoured to palliate their guilt by an appearance of vehemence against the crime  Journals passim    Dake of Leeds impeached  The commons after some debate came to a resolution that there was sufficient matter to impeach the Duke of Leeds of high crimes and misdemeanours They ordered Mr Comptroller Wharton to impeach him accordingly at the bar of the house of lords in the name of the house and all the commons of England The report was read in the mean time in the house of lords Leeds was speaking to his own defence when he was apprized of the proceedings of the commons He suddenly went down to the house and desired to be heard He was permitted to speak But his speech was not satisfactory He prepared for his defence in a more effectual way One Robart a Swiss by nation and one of his own domestics was the only person who could carry home any certain proof to the Duke Robart was prudently sent back to his native country The lords addressed the King to stop the fugitive by shutting the ports of the kingdom against his flight Neither William nor his servants were likely to gain by the inquiry The proclamation was not issued till nine days after the address of the peers The clamours of Leeds for a trial or an acquittal rose in proportion to Robart's distance from London A prorogation on the third of May at length extinguished the inquiry and the Duke's fears Thus ended a wretched farce in which the feeble efforts for obtaining justice were searce less disgraceful than venality itself to the age  Journals passim    An act with regard to the coin  During these transactions another matter of the utmost importance employed a part of the attention of parliament The bad state of the coin both by diminution and adulteration became too obvious not to alarm the nation The money had actually decreased more than one half in its nominal value The King had been for some time apprized of this growing evil  Burnet vol iii  He intended to issue a proclamation that no money should pass for the future but by weight He was however diverted from this measure by the consideration that the debasement of the coin would facilitate the loans to government The Earl of Rochester laid open in the house of lords the alarming condition of the currency and as early as the eighth of January a committee of the commons were appointed to receive proposals to prevent clipping and the exportation of silver The report of the committee lay for some time neglected on the table The lords however passed a bill to prevent the counterfeiting and clipping the current coin of the kingdom They sent the bill down to the commons for their concurrence on the nineteenth of March  Journals March  The house took the report of their committee into consideration and they made several amendments to which the lords agreed But though the bill contained some good clauses it was manifestly inadequate to the perfect cure of the evil The value of money was sunk in the exchange Guineas which ought to have been equal in value to one and twenty shillings and six pence rose to thirty shillings The credit of government and the public funds sunk to such a degree  "as to bring a discount of forty per cent upon tallies  Burnet vol iii  "  Parliament protogued  The just complaints of the English mariners had induced William to recommend a bill for their encouragement at the opening of this session of parliament The abuses which prevailed by land were great and general But avarice and tyranny arrived only at their height in the navy The agents of the Crown defrauded  the seamen of their wages The captains and commanders of ships joined in the same shameful traffic The provisions were cheap and unwholesome Jobs frauds and injustice prevailed in every line  Petition to the lords  Insults abroad were added to the distresses of the seamen at home The Dutch to man their own fleet exacted under the pretence of the King's permission the tenth man out of every British ship that entered their ports They rose in their demands in the course of the present year They required a man out of every vessel though navigated by ever so few hands The person chosen was either obliged to redeem his freedom with a considerable sum of money or to serve in a foreign bottom  Dutch Encroachments P MS Account in the Bodleian library Oxon  The parliament paid no attention either to the recommendation of the King or the complaints of the seamen On the third of May William came to the house of lords and having thanked the two houses for the supplies put an end to the session  Journals May    Dispositions for opening the campaign  Though the necessity of his immediate departure to the continent was the reason assigned by the King for proroguing the parliament in the midst of the enquiry he remained nine days after the prorogation at Kensington Having declared the regency consisting of the chief officers of state on the third of May he sailed from Gravesend on the twelfth and arrived on the fourteenth at the Hague  Auct citat passim  The allies had made the necessary preparations for acting with vigour France disconcerted by the death of the Mareschal de Luxembourg  Jan N S  and her other misfortunes thought only of a desensive campaign Lewis despairing to find a proper successor to so great a captain was long doubtful where he should fix his choice The Mareschal de Villeroi was at length placed at the head of the principal army in Flanders The second army was submitted to the orders of De Boufflers Namur on the right and Dunkirk on the left comprehended  between them the extent of country to be defended by the French Tournay on the Schelde and Ypres near the Lys formed a part of the line De Boufflers was ordered to assemble his army near Mons to cover Namur Villeroi posted himself between the Schelde and the Lys to protect Tournay Ypres and Dunkirk  Mem du Feuquiere p    Preparations against Namar  William having taken the field on the sixth of June found himself at the head of an army much superior to that of the French To amuse the enemy and to conceal his real design upon Namur he made some movements which rendered Villeroi uncertain where the storm was first to fall The King assembled his army in three divisions The first under the Elector of Bavaria he ordered to advance between the Schelde and the Lys He posted himself with the second at Becelaër on the Heule He detached the Duke of Wirtemberg with the third division to invest the fort of Knoque These feints and refinements in his motions the King durst not have attempted had De Luxembourg still commanded the enemy Any of the three bodies of the allies might have been attacked by the whole force of the French army But either Villeroi discerned not the advantage or he deliberated till the opportunity was lost  Ibid  and William having at length completed his preparations resolved to sit down before Namur He made every necessary disposition for investing the place for covering the siege and for forming an army to observe the motions of the enemy on the maritime side of Flanders  The town invested  The siege of Namur was formed by the Elector of Bavaria with his native troops the forces of several German princes and a body of cavalry William at the head of the main army lay behind the Mehaigne in a condition to pass that river and if necessary to sustain the siege The Prince of Vaudemont with an army of observation lay between the Lys and the Mandel to cover those places in Flanders which were  most exposed  Memoires du Feuquiere  The enemy perceiving at length the designs of William upon Namur the Mareschal de Boufflers with seven regiments of dragoons threw himself into the place to reinforce the garrison Villeroi instead of making any attempt to relieve Namur resolved to fall upon the Prince of Vaudemont who lay with an inferior force within three leagues of his army The prince was disadvantageously encamped His adversary however possessed no abilities to avail himself of what fortune had thrown in his way When he deliberated concerning the manner of attack the opportunity was lost The like advantage presented itself a second time But it was only to throw a second disgrace on the French general The Prince retreated in his presence with consummate skill and sheltered himself with very little loss under the cannon of Ghent  Ibid    Operations  The fine retreat of the Prince of Vaudemont was considered equal to a victory The French however found means to take Dixmuyde and Deynse with little resistance The garrisons were made prisoners of war Both places were dismantled The trenches were in the mean time opened before Namur On the twelfth of July the batteries began to play In a sally on the eighteenth the French were forced to retreat with considerable loss The King on the same day ordered the advanced works and traverses of the enemy to be stormed This service was performed in his presence with the greatest resolution and success The ground taken from the enemy was instantly occupied with batteries On the twentyseventh of July the King carried the first counterscarp and the Elector of Bavaria at the same instant found means to throw a bridge across the Sambre which facilitated the reduction of the place The French behaved themselves with an obstinate bravery But the allies animated by the presence of their leader were irresistible in their various attacks The outworks were at length carried by the besiegers A practicable breach was made in the innermost wall  Preparations for a general assalut being made the town capitulated on the fourth of August The garrison under the command of the Mareschal de Boufflers retired on the sixth to the castle  Journal of the siege    The citadel capitulates  The Mareschal de Villeroi in the mean time having crossed the Lys and Schelde made a feint of marching to raise the siege His real design was directed against Brussels and he appeared on the thirteenth of August before that place Under a pretence of revenging the attacks of the English fleet on the maritime towns of Flanders he bombarded Brussels Fifteen hundred houses and many public buildings were laid in ruins The Prince of Vaudemont was an eyewitness of a destruction which he could neither prevent nor avenge On the fifteenth of August the French general being reinforced with a considerable body of troops directed his march toward Namur When he had advanced to Fleurus he gave a signal of his approach to the besieged by the discharge of ninety pieces of cannon William leaving the charge of the siege to the Elector of Bavaria repaired to his army strongly encamped within five miles of Namur On the twentyninth of August De Villeroi advanced toward the allies But he found them so well posted that he retired in the night without noise The castle was in the mean time pressed by the allies with the utmost vigour In a general assault on the thirtieth of August the besiegers though with great loss made such a lodgement that the French desired to capitulate on the first of September  Journal of the siege    Reflections  The taking of Namur in the presence of a great army of the enemy was the most brilliant of William's military actions Though he had lost that important place in the like circumstances his spirit and conduct throughout this campaign deserved and received applause An act of resentment against the enemy added to the reputation which the King acquired by the taking of Namur The French contrary to an express cartel for a mutual ransom of prisoners  had detained the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse which places had fallen into their hands The Mareschal de Boufflers was arrested as a hostage by the orders of the King He remonstrated in vain He was sent prisoner to Maestricht and detained till assurances were received that the imprisoned garrisons should be released and sent back to the allies The operations of the campaign ended with the surrender of the citadel William quitted the field and retired to Dieren and from thence to Loo The command devolved upon the Elector of Bavaria But the armies separated in the end of September His want of success in the preceding years of the war enhanced to William the fame of taking Namur The capture of a single town could scarce produce a plentiful harvest of laurels to a general accustomed to victory  Campaign in Italy Germany and Spain  The war languished on the side of Italy between France and the Duke of Savoy Casal was defended by the first and taken by the latter in a manner that shewed neither power was sincere in the operations of the campaign To amuse the allies seemed to be the object of both parties The same langour or rather a total inaction prevailed on the UpperRhine Two armies alternately offering and declining battle made a mere pastime and parade of war The Spaniards aided by the maritime powers were more fortunate than they had been in the preceding campaign They obtained some advantage in the field But they besieged Palamos in vain The English fleet which had wintered at Cadiz could render no effectual aid to a nation labouring under feeble councils a want of money and every species of domestic decay Admiral Russel having spent the summer to little purpose on the coasts of Spain and Provence returned to cadiz in the end of September The glory of insulting the French coast and of confining the fleet of the enemy in the harbour of Toulon could scarce balance the extraordinary expence of the maritime powers in their efforts to second the feeble operations in Spain  A peace had been expected on the side of Hungary But the hopes of the allies vanished upon the accession  Jan  of Mustapha the Second to the Ottoman throne This Prince possessed of more vigour than his predecessor Ahmed the Second resolved to command his troops in person He took the field He passed the Danube He stormed Lippa He seized Itul Falling suddenly on a considerable body of troops under General Veterani he killed that officer dispersed his forces and closed with success a campaign which promised nothing but misfortunes The Elector of Saxony who commanded the Imperialists was too late in taking the field His army was ill provided the season was severe the enemy too prudent to hazard that reputation which he had already acquired Poland torn as usual with domestic faction made no figure in the present year France had increased by her intrigues the feuds between the nobles She had gained by her secret influence the King The deliberations of the diet were interrupted by every species of civil discord and the assembly was disolved in confusion  Hist de Pologne tom ii    Transactions and  The operations of the combined squadrons in the ocean were productive of no striking events The lord Berkely commanded in chief the fleet destined to insult the coast of France He bombarded St Maloes with little effect on the fourth of July He came before Dunkirk on the first of August The noted Meesters a Dutch engineer applied again his infernals to the Risbank with the same want of success as in the preceding year Heats and animosities prevailed between the English and Dutch Complaints were made on every side Meesters withdrew from the squadron with his machines in the night The Lord Berkeley retired and proceeded to Calais The enemy were prepared to receive his visit and having in vain discharged six hundred shells into the place he desisted from his attempt  disasters at sea  The naval efforts of the English in the West Indies were attended with no success Wilmot and  Lillingston who commanded on an expedition against the French in Hispaniola agreed to enrich themselves and quarrelled about the spoil The interest of the public was neglected in their animosities But though the nation was disgraced by their gross mismanagements no inquiry was made into their conduct  Journals  The commerce of the kingdom was at the same time illprotected through the negligence of the commanders of the navy Many vessels from Barbadoes were taken by the enemy Five East India ships valued at a million fell into their hands  Burnet vol iii  The misfortunes at sea abated the joy of the people for the success by land Admiral Hopson appointed to scour the channel with a squadron was either inactive or unsuccessful The Marquis of Caermarthen stationed with some ships at Scilly mistook a fleet of merchantmen for the enemy's navy and fled with all his sails from the vessels which he ought to defend  Burchet    Affairs of Scotland  The affairs of Scotland furnished nothing worthy of being recorded after the prorogation of the parliament in the year The same regency and the same measures continued throughout the succeeding year The King eager to derive all the possible aid from that kingdom to maintain the war demanded numerous levies from the heritors or proprietors of lands In the space of three months three thousand men were impressed and delivered to the officers of the government These with five regiments making in all seven thousand soldiers were embarked at Leith  Apr  and transported to Flanders The surrender  Apr  of the Bass which had been hitherto held in the name of James is a matter of greater singularity than importance Two and thirty persons had taken possession of that post and supported themselves by manning their boat and rifling such vessels as passed near their rock In one of their predatory excursions eighteen of their number having boarded a ship from Dunbar were carried to Dundee by the force of a storm They landed and fled by different ways  But three were taken tried and condemned To save their companions those who remained on the Bass desired to capitulate The council agreed to their proposals The condemned were pardoned and the rest were permitted to depart with their baggage and swords  Burnet James II    A session of parliament  The malcontents in Scotland found matter for fomenting a jealousy of government which rendered the meeting of the parliament of that kingdom dangerous to the authority of its regency That assembly therefore was prorogued from time to time till the necessities of the crown overcame the fears of its servants The funds established for the army had expired and they had been diverted to other purposes by a breach of public faith To soften the opposition to the crown a commission was issued under the great seal to examine witnesses upon the massacre of Glenco as the memory of that act of barbarity still inflamed the passions of the whole nation Though this was an artifice to cover that infamous transaction by a private inquiry  Burnet vol iii p  it produced by an appearance of justice a favourable change in the minds of the people But schemes still more effectual had been previously formed to amuse the nation and to gain a majority in parliament On the ninth of May the session was opened by the Marquis of Tweedale as King's commissioner William in his letter to the parliament excused by the continuation of the war his not appearing in person in Scotland He recommended to them moderation and union in matters of the church He desired in the most soothing terms a renewal of the subsidies that had just expired  King's Letter    The members gained  Soothing expressions however were not the only means prepared by the servants of William to gain the Scots One Paterson who had been the chief instrument in establishing the bank of England had framed a mercantile project of an extensive kind for Scotland Such English merchants as had been hitherto disappointed in their schemes of forming a new  East India company gave their countenance to Paterson's plan which from views of their own was adopted with ardour by the Scottish ministry The project was to establish one settlement at Darien on the east side of the isthmus of America and another on the opposite side toward the South Sea This scheme was laid before the King by secretary Johnston Instructions were prepared and signed impowering the commissioner to give his assent to any bill for the encouragement of trade That nobleman accordingly communicated the King's intentions to the parliament The bait was greedily seized The people lost their resentment in a condescension which flattered their hopes of wealth The parliament itself was all submission A vote of condolence for the death of the Queen was instantly passed They gave at once all the necessary supplies The ways and means were a general polltax a sixmonths cess out of the landrents and an additional excise  Proceedings of Scot Parl    Proceedings  But notwithstanding this seeming complaisance to the crown the current of the nation for an inquiry into the massacre of Glenco was too strong to be opposed The artifice of the courtparty could not conceal the shocking circumstances of that barbarous affair They however diverted with some appearance of decency the implication of guilt from the King himself to Dalrymple his acting minister upon that occasion The parliament voted the whole a murder They addressed the King for justice on the offenders But their application was couched in terms which seemed to demand no compliance with their request William accordingly paid no attention to their address He even continued his favour without abatement to the principal actors in the tragedy The bill for establishing a company for trading to Africa and the Indies was the price of the blood shed at Glenco The clamour and misfortunes which this act produced shall be hereafter explained Together with this bill two others of importance received the royal assent An act for raising yearly nine  thousand men to recruit the Scotch regiments in the service abroad and one for erecting a public bank in the city of Edinburgh On the seventeenth of July the commissioner adjourned the parliament to the seventh day of the following November  Proceedings of Scot Parl Burnet vol iii Ralph vol ii    Affairs of Ireland  A kind of tranquillity succeeded in Ireland the ineffectual complaints which the people of that kingdom laid before the parliament of England Sir Henry Capel created a lord with other two lords justices carried on the government with a degree of precision Quarrels sprung among themselves Capel abetted the interests of the English against the old Irish without any strict regard to equity  Burnet vol iii  He courted popularity at the expence of justice and suffered himself to become the property of interested and designing men His brethren in office were more severe and more just They studied to protect the old Irish when oppressed  Ibid  They gained honour But they lost popularity Capel favoured by the English in Ireland raised his views to the government of that kingdom He promised to the King and his ministers to carry every thing in a parliament should he be appointed lorddeputy with powers to displace some men in office His proposal was accepted Several were removed  Ibid  A parliament was called  Aug    A session of parliament  Capel opened the session with a demand of money The commons resolved to grant an immediate supply to the King to discharge the debts of the crown and to maintain the established government They found it less difficult to make the grant than to find the ways and means They agreed at length on a pollbill and some additional customs But as both were deemed inadequate to the sum required they resolved to continue to the end of the year the additional excise which they had voted at the beginning only for a short space of time A quarrel between the lorddeputy and the chancellor filled the rest of  the session with debates and a degree of confusion A motion was made by the party of the former to impeach the latter for forming a new faction in the kingdom But the chancellor was cleared of all imputation by a great majority The session however ended in tranquillity and upon the whole favourable to the lorddeputy He carried the projects of the Crown in parliament and he was recommended as an excellent governor in a special address sent by the commons to the King  Address of the Commons    Inactivity of the late King  Though the death of Mary raised the expectations of the adherents of her father that Prince shewed little inclination to avail himself of that event He either resigned a mind depressed with misfortunes to religious enthusiasm or disgusted with the apparent coldness of the French ministry left his hopes of a restoration to fortune His friends in England ceased not however to urge him to an attempt on that kingdom The Earl of Arran endeavoured to rouze him with letters The Earl of Sunderland now much in the confidence of William betrayed the councils of the latter Prince to his former master  Arran to James March  He informed the late King early in the season that the English fleet were destined to attack Toulon But he at the same time gave it as his opinion that the enterprise would be dropt as impracticable  Sunderland's Correspondence Scot Coll Paris  The langour which had seized the belligerent powers extended itself to the party of James in England and to his councils in France The latter kingdom was too much exhausted by internal calamities either to push the war with vigour on the continent or to avail herself of a descent on the British isles  Zeal of his adherents  The more violent Jacobites in the mean time continued their zealous efforts in favour of their dethroned master Strangers to the situation of the mind of James and ignorant of the disposition of France they endeavoured to rouze the first with every possible argument to make a descent in England The absence of the reigning Prince his unpopularity at home and  the feuds which subsisted between him and some members of the great alliance abroad were placed in the most flattering colours before the eyes of the late King The manifest decline in the health of William his loss of influence by the death of Mary the distress and consequent discontent of the nation their murmurs against the late heavy taxes their fears of future burdens were either magnified or recounted with ardour James was assured by his adherents that in the pretent state of affairs and opinions ten thousand men would be sufficient to establish him again on his throne They affirmed that the whole force in England consisted only of nine thousand men That the nation was divided into three parties That one of these was in the interest of the late King one affected the views and person of the Princess of Denmark and the third but the least considerable adhered to William  Stuartpapers    His party increases in England  Whilst these zealots laid their proposals with so much eagerness before James his minister the Earl of Middleton maintained an intimate intercourse with the principal men in England The Earl of Sunderland continued his secret correspondence Even the Duke of Devonshire and the Earl of Pembroke  Middleton to Mordant June  the latter then lordprivyseal seemed to have listened to the court of St Germains The Dutchess of Devonshire either following or leading her husband became an agent for James  Ibid  The Princess of Denmark and the Earl of Marlborough professed themselves his firm and unshaken friends The assurances made by persons of such weight and consequence kept alive the hopes of his friends while he himself had fallen into a state of indifference concerning his own fate  James II  Middleton however made soon after fruitless applications in the name of his master to the court of France To induce the French ministry to undertake an invasion of England he communicated his intelligence and hopes from that kingdom He represented that the coast was left naked of ships of war That the discontents which prevailed  at present were likely to increase after the intended elections for a new house of commons William he said was to demand eight millions from parliament and to alter the established succession by preferring any children he might hereafter beget to the Princess of Denmark and her son But Middleton built most on the credit of Sunderland "who" he continued  "had been always the first to deceive himself and the foremost to hetray others"  Si  ion of William  But if James had friends in England it is only in that kingdom he seems to have had friends France exhausted by domestic calamities as well as by the waste occasioned by a burdensome war was anxious to obtain peace upon any decent terms The court of Rome itself had forgot the orthodoxy of James in his pusillanimity in quitting his dominions without a blow The success of William in seizing the throne of England his inflexible perseverance in all his plans his courage in the field his apparent prudence in the cabinet his former obstinacy in continuing an unsuccessful war and at length the reputation which he acquired in the present campaign excited that admiration which invariably follows good fortune He was besides seen through a favourable medium by the nations of Europe The haziness which covered him at home obscured not his lustre abroad The astonishing exertions of England in the war were ascribed to his management He was considered as the absolute master of Holland and not only the chain which united the grand confederacy but even the absolute lord of the members of which it was composed  Perth's Correspondence Stuartpapers    compared with James  His rival if in his present distressed condition James deserved that name laboured under every disadvantage in the eyes of the world The enthusiasm which had deprived him of his throne was construed into an incurable folly by the more sensible part of his own persuasion A kind of WICKED policy as the Pope perhaps ludicrously said had superseded every idea of  religion among the Catholic powers who were engaged in the grand alliance Innocent the Twelfth himself though the sat in St Peter's chair was swayed by temporal views from entertaining any favour for a Prince who had sacrificed his crown to a blind attachment to the Romish faith He received the Earl of Perth who had been sent in the character of ambassador by James with manifest coldness or treated him with seeming ridicule The utmost that the most pressing solicitations could obtain from that Pontiff amounted only to a compliment He assured the Earl of Perth that the would never concur in a peace which tended to deprive a Catholic Prince of his just rights But Innocent and all his court were in the interest of the house of Austria and thus James though a very faithful son of the church lost his influence with the holy Father through his dependence on France  Perth's letter Stuartpapers    King's progress  William having spent some time at Loo repaired to the Hague on the seventh day of October Having in an interview with the Elector of Brandenburg and in conferences with the States of Holland settled the operations of the succeeding campaign he returned to England and arrived at Kensington on the twentyfirst day of the month In a council held on the evening of his arrival he resolved to dissolve the parliament and to order another to meet on the twentysecond of November The Earl of Sunderland in concert with the court of St Germains advised this measure  Stuartpapers  The former parliament from their liberal grants to the Crown were become odious to the people and the latter therefore were not likely to chuse again representatives so compliant to the views of the King But William beheld the matter in another light The popularity which he thought he derived from the glory of a successful campaign induced him to hope for a return of members more favourable to his interest than those who had lately  pushed their inquiries so far To improve to his advantage the present good humour of the people the King resolved to make a royal progress But his want of affability his frigid manner and dry address were not calculated either to gain the favour of the populace or to retain it when gained A visit which he paid to the Earl of Sunderland at Althorp was construed by his enemies into gratitude for former favours while his precipitate retreat from Oxford for fear of being poisoned  Publications of the times  at an entertainment prepared by the university was considered as unworthy of his known prudence and usual courage  A new parliament  In the elections for the new house of commons the Jacobites were unsuccessful in proportion to the decline of their cause Few of the known adherents of the late King were returned But the abbetors of the interest of the reigning Prince were not implicitly chosen by the nation Many of the firmest Whigs were elected men who made a greater distinction between the principles of government than between the persons of kings The two houses met on the twentysecond of November Foley who had succeeded Trevor in the office of speaker was again placed by the commons in the chair The King in his speech from the throne demanded the usual supplies to prosecute with vigour the war He complained that the funds which had been formerly given were deficient He represented that the civil list was in a condition which rendered it impossible for him to subsist unless that matter should command their immediate care He recommended the French Protestants to their support He laid before them the bad state of the coin He expressed his wishes for a bill to encourage seamen  He concluded with assuring the commons that he wa  entirely satisfied with the choice which his people had made  Journals Nov    A bill for regulating trials  The commons addressed the King on the twentyninth of November and promised to assist him effec+tually in the prosecution of the war But before any  supply was voted a bill was brought in for regulating trials in cases of treason and misprision of treason A bill to the same effect had been often introduced before and as often disappointed The adherents of the Court opposed it in its progress The popularity of the measure at length prevailed By this salutary law it was provided that no person should be tried for high treason except an attempt to assassinate the King unless the indictment be found within three years after the offence was committed That the prisoner shall have a copy of the indictment but not the names of the witnesses five days at least before his arraignment That he shall have a copy of the panel of jurors two days before his trial and that he shall have the same compulsive process with the Crown to force his witnesses to appear  Statute W  A change of situation too frequently makes an alteration in the principles of men Many who had suffered by the want of such a law in the two former reigns opposed with vehemence the bill They argued that the security of the government was the best provision for the security of the subject and they urged that the act by giving every possible advantage to conspirators exposed the kingdom to revolution and change  A supply voted  On the second of December the commons voted the supply for the war Two millions five hundred thousand pounds were assigned to the navy  Journals Dec  two millions for the support of an army of eightyseven thousand men Though these sums were great they were less than the demands of the Crown There was besides an arrear of deficiency for which no provision was made But before the supply was fixed upon adequate funds a matter of the last importance employed the attention of the commons The act passed in the preceding session of parliament to prevent the clipping and exportation of silver coin had been found inadequate to the purpose The evil had risen to too great a height to be removed by slight remedies The lords went first upon the business  They prepared an address to which they desired the concurrence of the commons to request the King to put a stop by proclamation to the currency of clipped crowns and halfcrowns The commons chose to proceed in their own way They went into a committee of the whole house to deliberate on the state of the nation with respect to the current coin  Journals    Debates  Individuals differed much in their opinions upon a subject in which the interests of all were so deeply concerned It appeared from various experiments that the silver coins on a medium were diminished at least one third In proportion as the intrinsic of silver sunk beneath its nominal value the gold rose Two evils with equal violence pressed the nation on either side A remedy must be instantly applied The first question proposed to the commons was whether it was expedient to recoin the silver money The house was divided upon the subject The opponents of the Court opposed the recoinage with some specious arguments They affirmed that the present conjuncture was by no means fit for a measure whose operations must give so general and so violent a shock to the nation They observed that the people laboured under the calamity and expence of a burdensome and doubtful war That the nation as yet unsettled in their opinions with regard to the present establishment might be provoked by this new grievance to unhinge the government That though things might be managed and accommodated at home it would be difficult if not impossible to maintain either commerce or war abroad That a present recoinage would most certainly suspend all the operations of trade for the want of mutual payments and they concluded with affirming that the people in their despair might be hurried into the most dreadful extremities  on the coinact  The necessity of a speedy remedy was argued by the other side They observed that the bad state of the coin had turned the exchange of all Europe in an alarming degree against the nation That therefore the supplies voted for the support of the army  abroad would never answer their end That guineas by this growing evil were already advanced to thirty shillings and foreign gold in the same extravagant proportion That all Europe sent their gold as the most valuable of all commodities into our market That gold at last would remain the sole currency for trade in the kingdom But that it could not be expected that other nations would receive that commodity at the value which it bore in this kingdom They concluded with affirming that the evil would gather additional strength every day That the contagion had already spread through every vein of commerce and that unless a speedy and powerful remedy should be applied the certain dissolution of the state advanced with hasty strides  A bill passed  The question whether the standard of the several denominations of the new money should continue the same produced many and vehement debates Some affirmed that as the price of silver was raised  To six shillings and threepence  the standard should be proportionably increased They argued that the measure would prevent the exportation of the coin and the melting of it down as had been practised for several years They urged at the same time that people would be induced to bring their plate and bullion to the mint from views of advantage The majority with more reason asserted that it was impossible the price of silver could either rise or fall in respect of itself That the alteration in the price of bullion was merely relative to the diminished money and they affirmed in support of their position that an ounce of bullion could be actually bought at that very time for five shillings and two pence of newmilled money As to the exportation of the coin they justly observed that nothing could effectually prevent that evil but a superiority in trade over other nations The arguments for a new coinage on the old standard at length prevailed The present inconvenience was deemed less dangerous than the future evils which were justly to be apprehended The commons resolved to put a stop to the currency and to proceed to a new coinage with the utmost attention  and dispatch  Dec  A bill was accordingly brought in for that purpose  Dec  and twelve hundred thousand pounds were voted for supplying the dificiency of clipped money This sum was ordered to be raised by a duty for seven years on houses and windowlights  Dec    Address against the Scotish EastIndia company  These measures though spirited appeared from the event to be too precipitate A proclamation for stopping the currency of the gold coin was issued before the mint had provided any quantity of new money for the purposes of trade This evil was in some measure remedied by an act formed upon subsequent resolutions in parliament But the wisdom of that assembly could not prevent a general loss of credit which shook the government while it distressed the nation Another affair of importance employed a part of the attention of both houses during the debates on the coin On the fourteenth of December  Dec  the lords sent down to the commons an address to the King against an act passed in the Scotish parliament for erecting a company trading to Africa and the EastIndies The commons concurred with the peers The two houses attended the King with their address His answer was that he had been illserved in Scotland But that he hoped some remedy might be found to the evil of which they complained This indefinite reply was not sufficient to satisfy the commons    They resolved that the directors of the Scotish company should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors That a council of trade should be established by act of parliament for the preservation of the commerce of England That the commissioners should be nominated by parliament But that none of them should be members of the house  Jan    A bill for a new council of trade  An attempt to establish a new board by act of parliament was considered by the adherents of the court as a high encroachment on the rights of the crown William himself was as fond of the prerogatives as any of his predecessors in the throne He  considered the present measure as a precedent for future invasions on the executive power of the King He ordered his servants to oppose the bill with all the influence of office But the current of public opinion was turned toward new regulations for the protection and encouragement of commerce The waste occasioned by the war the loss by captures at sea and the late disasters on that element had raised general complaints and produced many petitions The enemies of William took advantage of the vehemence of the people Even some of his supposed friends and actual favourites promoted a measure which he avowedly disapproved The Earl of Sunderland with all his adherents declared for the bill The King ascribed the conduct of this nobleman to his fears from the popular party But he was in a secret correspondence with James and he had promised to oppose the measures of William in parliament  Stuartpapers    The commons address against the Earl of Portland  While the commons seemed thus to encroach on the power of the crown they pushed an inquiry which affected the person of the King Bentinck whom William had created Earl of Portland retained in England that ascendency in the favour of his master which he had acquired in Holland He had obtained from the King a grant of the lordships of Denbigh Bromfield and Yale in the county of Denbigh and a part of the ancient demesnes of the Prince of Wales The gentleman of the county had opposed the warrant for the grant in the treasury They followed it with their opposition to the office of the Earl of Pembroke who was then lordprivyseal This nobleman was at the time in correspondence with the late King He heard the petitioners with a seeming candour which bordered on favour The affair was permitted to lie dormant But the warrant was not recalled The gentlemen of Denbigh carried their complaints before parliament Mr Price afterwards a baron of the exchequer introduced the petition with a spirited but vehement and bitter speech The house warmed to a degree of  fury voted unanimously an address against the grant The King promised to recall the warrant But he assured the commons that he would find some other way of shewing his favour to the Earl of Portland  Journals  He performed his promise in the most ample manner in the succeeding May  An incident favourable to William  In the midst of circumstances so mortifying to William a favourable event changed the whole face of his affairs The reputation which he had acquired in Flanders his weight and consequence abroad and his own persevering policy at home were not sufficient to supply the loss of influence which he sustained in the death of Mary The nation distressed by an adulterated and diminished currency offended at the captures made upon their commerce at sea and oppressed with the enormous expence of the war by land placed all their misfortunes to the account of the King's predilection for other interests than those of England His manner was better calculated to inflame than to allay the ferment which prevailed in the minds of his subjects His enemies took every advantage of the state of the public opinion They increased the discontents of the people in general and they found means to improve the same bad humour in the new parliament  Preparations of James for an invasion  The malcontents had foreseen in the preceding summer the height to which the bad humour of the people was likely to rise They urged the late King as has been already related to undertake an invasion They promised insurrections in England whenever he should appear on the coast When the new parliament discovered symptoms of refractoriness to the measures of William the adherents of James redoubled their instances for an invasion early in the spring They assured that Prince that to land in England wa  to regain without contest his crown That cou  he once come to London or even to some considera+ble town without any force the greatest part of th  nation would rise in arms and resore him to th  throne Lewis the Fourteenth flattered with the  accounts agreed to furnish an army and every thi  necessary for a descent He however insisted that the Jacobites should rise in arms before the French troops should embark and the Duke of Berwick was dispatched by his father to England to take the insurgents under his command  James II  The preparations of France were carried forward with expedition and zeal The troops intended for the invasion began to draw near to Calais and Dunkirk Four hundred sail of great and small vessels were assembled from different ports James himself urged by Lewis the Fourteenth took post on the seventeenth of February and he arrived on the twentieth at Calais The Dutch became alarmed for their own country But an unaccountable security prevailed in Britain  Ibid    A conspiracy against the King's life  During these preparations for an invasion from France a conspiracy for assassinating William was framed in England by some zealous adherents of the late King This scheme had been forming long One Crosby had been sent to the court of St Germains to demand a commission from James for perpetrating the crime But that Prince suspected from his earnestness that Crosby was employed by William himself to persuade him to consent to a measure which must for ever put an end to his hopes  Ibid  The zealous conspirators had long endeavoured but in vain to argue James into an express approbation of the attempt upon the person of the King They however obtained at length a commission for a general insurrection  Ibid  against William and all his adherents This commission was placed  Dec  in the hands of Sir George Barclay a native of Scotland a man of courage and an experienced soldier Barclay arrived in London in the month of January He joined himself in that city to one Harrison a priest to Charnock who from being a fellow of Magdalen college at Oxford had become a Roman catholic and a captain to one Captain Porter and to Sir William Perkins  The plot discovered  These inconsiderate and daring men under the pretence of a commission from James gained over some desperate Jacobites to aid them in their projected scheme They first proposed to surprise seize and carry William to France  James II  But this was deemed impracticable should they scruple to take his life  Ibid  They resolved therefore to attack him with an armed party consisting of forty men in the midst of his guards The scene of the intended assault was the lane between Brentford and TurnhamGreen through which William usually passed upon his return from Richmond The fifteenth of February was the day appointed for the execution of their purpose But an unexpected discovery baffled at once their views A Captain Fisher whom the chief conspirators had resolved to employ in the attack communicated the whole to the Earl of Portland on the thirteenth of February The same evening Pendergrass an Irishman and one of the forty confirmed the information of Fisher They were both examined by the King in person He encouraged them to mix again with their friends He kept at home on the fifteenth of February The conspirators fixed upon the twentysecond of the month to execute their scheme The King again remained at home A panic seized the whole party Some fled But others were seized the next night  Feb  in their beds  The King's speech to the parliament  The day after the seizure of some of the conspirators the King informed his parliament of the danger which had threatened his life He acquainted the two houses that preparations were made in France for invading the kingdom He assured himself he said that nothing should be omitted on their part that might be deemed proper for the present safety or the future security of his people He told them that he had not been wanting in giving the necessary orders to the fleet That he had commanded a considerable body of troops to be brought home That some of the conspirators against his person were already seized That care was taken to apprehend the  rest and that upon the whole all such other orders were given as the public safety in the present conjuncture seemed to require The two houses lost at once their bad humour in the danger to which the life of the King had been exposed They sent a joint address to the throne full of expressions of the most unlimited zeal and loyalty They declared to all the world that should his Majesty come to any violent death they would revenge the same on all his enemies and their adherents As an instance of their affection to William they promised to give all possible dispatch to the public business and they made it their desire to the King to seize upon the present occasion all such persons as he should think fit to apprehend  Journals Feb    Zeal of the two houses  The commons followed their warm address with various resolutions of the same kind They ordered in a bill to enable his Majesty to seize all suspected persons They prepared an address for commanding by proclamation all papists to retire from the cities of London and Westminster They drew up the form of an association for the defence of the King's person They acknowledged him the rightful and lawful Sovereign of England They engaged themselves to support and defend the succession of the crown according to the act of settlement passed in the first year of the present reign Four hundred members placed their names to the association in one day Such as withdrew from the house or were absent with leave were ordered to sign that paper or signify their refusal before the sixteenth of March  Ibid  The same warmth of affection and even vehemence of zeal extended themselves to the Lords The peers adopted with little alteration the association signed by the commons The whole nation partook of the flame which the discovery of the plot had kindled in the two houses of parliament Their objections to William were obliterated at once by their abhorrence of the conspiracy against his life and thus the imprudence of his enemies confirmed him in a throne on which he tottered before  Projects of the late King broken  This unsuccessful underplot of a few zealots was sufficient to ruin all the present projects of the late King But the seeds of disappointment were already sown in France itself A Mr Powel had been sent to St Germains from the Jacobites in England to lay before James the state of the designs in his favour in that kingdom Powel spoke with such vehemence confidence and zeal that the late King supposed that his party were resolved to take arms when they should receive certain intelligence of his own preparations for an invasion from France He desired Powel to put the whole in writing But before his commands were executed James happened to meet and converse with the most Christian King He told that Prince that his friends in England were ready upon the first notice to take arms He perceived his mistake when he read Mr Powel's written account But he was afraid of alarming the French ministers who were never his friends by undeceiving the King The preparations for the expedition proceeded upon this mistake The adherents of James had declared it impossible for them to rise till he himself should land Lewis gave positive orders that not a single vessel should sail till certain intelligence of an insurrection should arrive from England The late King was perplexed beyond measure by this insurmountable difficulty He derived his whole hopes from fortune and as usual he was deceived  James H    The invasion laid aside  The discovery of the plot in England broke in an instant the whole scheme The kingdom was in a ferment The French court who had not hitherto been undeceived lost all hopes of an insurrection an  fell into their usual languor A storm which shatter+ed the transports as they came round from Havre an  an uninterrupted course of contrary winds were adde  to the other misfortunes of the late King He however  remained on the coast of France The transports lay i  the port of Calais Eighteen men of war intended fo  their convoy had anchored for their own protectio  against the enemy among the sands of Dunkirk The appearance of the English fleet put an end to a design which seemed to be already broken Admiral Russel upon the first certain intelligence of the invasion was ordered to repair to the Downs Having hoisted his flag on board the Victory and collected with incredible diligence and expedition a powerful fleet he stood over to Graveline and stretched along the coast to Calais Calais was again bombarded with little effect To destroy the French men of war was found impracticable But the enemy instead of preparing for a descent on England became anxious for their own coast James in a disconsolate state of mind returned at length to St Germains He saw his project broken his hopes blasted his friends ruined by their pursuing measures contrary to his judgment and without his consent  James H    Conspirators punished  The courts of justice were in the mean time employed in the trial of such of the conspirators as had fallen into the hands of government Charnock King and Keys were the first tried and upon positive evidence condemned and executed They declared with one consent in papers delivered to the sheriffs that James was not only not privy to the design against the person of William but that he always rejected such proposals when offered Sir John Friend a wealthy citizen and Sir William Perkins were soon after tried and condemned The first for abetting the intended invasion The latter for concurring in the plot against the life of the King Several other persons of less consequence and rank inferior suffered death for the same crimes The evidence against the most of the prisoners was full and decisive The notoriety of the conspiracy proved more fatal to a few than the facts advanced by the witnesses The conspiracy against the King was confounded on the present occasion with the intended invasion from France The whole seemed to have been the exact counterpart of the conspiracy in the year when the people in their horror of the Ryehouseplot transferred  the guilt of assassins to men who meditated only an insurrection The criminals on the present occasion died enthusiasts to their political principles They confirmed their own minds in an opinion which they endeavoured in vain to inculcate on James that any attack on an enemy was a species of war  Stuartpapers    Proceedings of parliament  During these transactions the parliament proceeded in the same strain of complaisance to the crown which the attempt on the life of the King had raised Supplies were granted not only with liberality but even without reserve Clauses of loan were inserted in almost every moneybill An act was passed impowering the King to apprehend and detain such persons as he might suspect of conspiring against his person and government The commons in a body presented the association at the foot of the throne on the third of April The lords soon after followed the example laid by the lower house A bank for the purpose of raising money for the use of the government was established by act of parliament This new institution obtained the name of the national landbank from its security lying on land The measure was unadvised and proved mischievous to public credit Notwithstanding the complaisance of the two houses the King exerted his prerogative in a manner that gave some offerce to the commons He refused his assent to a bill for regulating elections of members to serve in parliament The projectors of the bill made a motion that those who had advised his Majesty to put a negative on the bill were enemies to the King and kingdom But the current of the times ran with violence in favour of government and the motion was rejected by a great majority  Journals  The business of the crown being brought to a conclusion on the twentyseventh of April the King put a happy end to a session which promised at the beginning but little complaisance to his views  CHAP III  Exhausted state of FranceHer intrigues and desire of peaceCampaign of Advances toward a treatyDomestic affairsProceedings of parliamentFenwick's caseAn

in vain for his Dutch guards  Exhausted state of France  THE glory assumed by France for having sustained herself so long against the rest of Europe in confederacy was more than balanced by her domestic distress Her great exertions had impoverished her subjects by enormous taxes and imposts An earnest desire for peace prevailed throughout the kingdom Past disappointments and the fear of future misfortunes had abated the ambition of the King He had lost his best generals in the course of the war and a great part of the reputation of his arms in the preceding campaign A deficiency in resources deprived him of every hope of making any successful efforts in the present year He had even some reason to fear he could not retain what he had already gained and  that instead of pushing the enemy in their territories he would find it difficult to defend his own  Her intrigues  France however endeavoured to supply with address what she wanted in point of power To provide against the misfortunes dreaded from the continuance of a burdensome war Lewis extended with success his intrigues to the different courts of Europe It Turkey he induced Mustapha the second to frustrate all the attempts made by the maritime powers to facilitate a peace He secured his influence in Poland by a pension to the Queen He gained the confidence of the courts of Italy by professing a concern for the repose and prosperity of a country harassed by the exactions of the allied powers He disconcerted the measures of the Germanic body by fomenting the feuds and supporting the pretensions of the various princes He placed spies and established pensioners in Spain He gained the good offices of the King of Sweden by flattering his pride and in Holland he renewed his ancient correspondence with the heads of the Republican party  and desire of peace  In the midst of measures for supporting the war with vigour the French King thought seriously of means to obtain peace He endeavoured in the preceding year through the channel of Denmark and Sweden to negociate a treaty for the reestablishment of the tranquillity of Europe He had in some measure agreed to a preliminary of the Imperial court that the affair of England should be settled to the satisfaction of the Prince of Orange He even ascribed the continuance of the war to William's hopes of regaining in one campaign the laurels which he had lost in the war During the winter the court of France conti+nued to make advances toward a peace To facilitat  a treaty they proposed to the States of Holland that  in case the affair of England was not settled to the sa+tisfaction of the Prince of Orange the whole negoci+ation should be void They agreed to admit the trea+ties of Westphalia and Nimeguen as the basis of th  expected peace But these advances on the side o  France were not answered with equal warmth by th  allied powers In proportion to the eagerness of Lew  for peace they rose in their demands and thus throughout the summer the whole affair remained in suspence  An inactive campaign in Flanders  William having left London on the second of May arrived at the Hague on the seventh of that month But he joined not his troops till the sixth of June The French had taken the field with two armies One under Mareschal de Villeroi was posted between Mechlen and Deynse The Mareschal de Boufflers commanded another between Flerus and Sombref The King opposed in person the enemy at Mariekirke with one army The Elector of Bavaria assembled another in the neighbourhood of Louvain The whole summer either passed in inaction or was wasted in motions which neither promised nor produced any important event Though no congress was opened the expectations of peace suspended the operations of war The allies were in no condition to push with vigour the advantages which they had obtained in the preceding campaign and France in her present condition considered her being able to protect her conquests an advantage equal to the glory of a victory  Operations on the side of Spain  To avail himself of the weakness of Spain the French King bent his principal efforts towards that side A dispute with the Court of Madrid on account of a Jew who had served him in quality of an agent had contributed to induce William to withdraw all the naval force of the English from the Mediterranean But the French having ordered the squadron at Toulon to fail into the ocean were incapable of insulting the coast of Spain though exposed They however pushed with some vigour their operations by land The Duke de Vendôme who commanded in Catalonia was ordered to take the field He passed the Ter on the the thirtieth of May He attacked the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt on the banks of that river and forced him to retire with loss under the cannon of Ostalric An inactive campaign succeeded this undecisive engagement The hopes of an immediate peace and the prospect of future advantages rose to France on the side of Spain The Queenmother  who as a daughter of Austria had carried the ammosities of her family against France into the councils of Charles the second was lately dead Lewis the Fourteenth had his agents at Madrid and he even then entertained hopes of practising to advantage on the weakness of that Prince  Hist d'Espagne    Naval transactions  Nothing of any moment happened on the side of Germany The French and Imperialists alternately passed and repassed to little purpose the Rhine The efforts of the maritime powers at sea were as languid and undecisive as their operations by land Sir George Rooke upon his return from Cadiz where he had wintered with his squadron was appointed commander in chief of the combined fleet Having in vain endeavoured to intercept the French fleet upon its way from Toulon to Brest he returned to Torbay on the twentythird of May and he was recalled by the lords of the regency from his command The lord Berkley who succeeded Rooke performed nothing of any importance The most remarkable transaction of this summer at sea was performed by Du Bart who had sailed with a French squadron from Dunkirk in the end of May He fell in on the eighth of June with a fleet of Dutch merchantmen from the Baltic under the convoy of five men of war The latter he took after an obstinate resistance Thirty of the former fell also into his hands Having performed this important service he escaped the vigilance of an English squadron and returned with his booty to France  Hist de France tom iii    Military affairs Desertion of the Duke of Savoy  On the side of Hungary an undecisive battle between the Ottomans and the Imperialists near Temeswaer comprehended the whole operations of the campaign The Poles were as usual inactive But the death of the King John Sobieski converted their country into a scene of intrigue for the succession to the crown  Hist du Nord tom ii  The Czar of Muscovy by the taking of Asoph on the Tanais rendered himself for the first time an object of attention to the courts of  Europe A peace between the French and the Duke of Savoy changed the whole face of affairs in Italy This pacification which greatly disconcerted the allies had been long negociated by the Count de Tessè as intermediate agent between the Duke and the Mareschal de Catinat who commanded the French troops on the side of Savoy De Catinat made the first offer of peace on the sixth of June The Duke willing to secure the supplies of the year from England and Holland concealed for some time the treaty after it was actually signed  May th  When he professed to avow the conditions they only seemed to comprehend the neutrality of Italy He suppressed the terms which concerned his own interest But to convince the confederates of his determination to adhere to his agreement with France he laid siege on the thirteenth of September to Valentia in conjunction with the Mareschal de Catinat  Hist de France tom iii    Advances toward a peace  The defection of the Duke of Savoy while it much offended all the confederates rendered the maritime powers in particular very desirous of peace William had various reasons to wish for an immediate pacification with France The failure of the landbank on which he had so much credit the consequent difficulty of present remittances the uncertainty of future supplies the example of Savoy for further desertions from the common cause the disposition of the States against the continuance of a burdensome war the clamours of the English under their heavy taxes all combined to make the reestablishment of the tranquility of Europe an object of importance to the King He therefore prosecuted with sincerity every measure to accomplish his views He concurred with the States in appointing Dykveldt to confer with Callieres who had for some time carried on in Holland secret negociations leading to a peace On the twentyfourth of August Dykveldt communicated the whole proceedings to the deputies of the States for foreign affairs The deputies made their report on the third of September to the StatesGeneral who  came to a resolution that the concessions of France to the demands of the Emperor were sufficient grounds for accepting the mediation of Sweden in concluding a general treaty of peace The house of Austria in neither of its branches seemed willing to close with the proposal of the maritime powers The court of Spain was offended with William The Emperor had an interest in continuing the war  De Torcy tom i    English Scotish and Irish affairs  In England nothing of importance happened during the summer The lords of the regency applied their chief attention to the recoinage of the silver money and to the operations of the fleet at sea In Scotland a session of parliament was held on the eighth of September The Lord Murray eldest son of the Marquis of Athol being created Earl of Tullibardin was appointed commissioner The Earl of Arran and other malcontents took the oaths for the first time and their seats in the house A supply was voted for one year's service to maintain the standing forces a measure calculated to induce the government to hold an annual session for its own support An illhumour had crept into parliament The people were distressed with a general scarcity which rendered them clamorous and discontented The commissioner therefore thought proper to put an end to the session on the ninth of October The Lord Capel dying in Ireland the government of that kingdom devolved by the choice of the council on the chancellor Sir Charles Porter in terms of an old act of parliament  Hen VIII  Nothing material happened in a parliament which met by adjournment soon after his elevation to that dignity  June th  In the end of July the Earls of Montrath and Drogheda were associated with Porter in the government of the kingdom  Parliament meets  On the seventh of October the King arrived from Holland at Kensington On the twentieth of the same month the parliament met at Westminster William in his speech from the throne expressed his satisfaction that no disorder had happened at home  and no disadvantage abroad in the course of the present year He ascribed this happiness to the good disposition of his army and the steady affection of his people for his person He recommended unanimity on account of the magnitude and importance of the business which they had to transact the supplying of former deficiencies the providing for the service of the ensuing year He informed them of overtures made for a general peace But that the only means to reestablish the public tranquillity was to show themselves prepared for a vigorous and effectual war He earnestly desired the commons to raise speedily the necessary supplies which ought not to be less than the sum intended for the preceding year He recommended the civil list to their support the French Protestants to their commiseration He desired them to consider whether some inconvenience did not still remain with regard to the coin He requested them to find the best expedient for the reestablishment of credit a circumstance as necessary for trade as for the support of the war  Journals Oct    Diligence of the commons  The commons with perfect unanimity agreed immediately to resolutions which answered the chief demands of the King's speech In a spirited address they promised in the name of the people of England to support his Majesty in obtaining by war a safe and honourable peace  Oct  They pledged the faith of the house that a supply should be granted for carrying on with vigour the war and that the deficiencies of the parliamentary funds should be made good  Oct  They applied themselves with the utmost diligence to this necessary business The sums to be raised were immense The deficiency of former funds amounted to more than six millions Two millions and a half were found necessary for the navy and a still greater sum for the service by land Public credit had in the mean time sunk so low that banknotes were at twenty per cent discount and exchequer tallies at sixty per cent The commons turned their immediate  attention to the silver coin They resolved that the hammered money should be received only by weight That an allowance of four pence an ounce should be made on all loans and plate brought to the mint before the first of January  Nov  To answer the most pressing demands on government they resolved to transfer to the next aids any loans not exceeding six hundred thousand pounds that should be advanced on the credit of the exchequer  Nov    Public credit restored  To restore the credit of the bank which had from various causes fallen so low the commons resolved to extend the time of its continuance and to augment the capital  Feb  The new subscriptions were wisely ordered to be made in the tallies upon parliamentary funds and in banknotes The first in the proportion of fourfifths of the payments The latter as having been subject to the least discount in that of onefifth Men of money for the benefit of acquiring at a low price a capital in the bank purchased with such eagerness the tallies and notes that their price arose The latter soon became equal to money The discounts on the former fell rapidly as a fund for the payment was fixed To supply the scarcity of money was as necessary for the purposes of commerce and government as the recovery of the credit of the bank notes and tallies Bills were ordered to be issued from the exchequer to the amount of two millions bearing interest at more than seven  per cent  These were received in the exchequer with a small discount in the payments made of the revenue This measure raised at length exchequer bills to an equality with money and supplied at present the want of coin Mountague who was then chancellor of the exchequer had the chief merit in measures which for the time relieved the nation from imminent distress  Sir John Fenwick's case  The extraordinary case of Sir John Fenwick interrupted in some degree the deliberations of the commons on the subject of public credit Fenwick had been accused of being concerned in a plot against the  King He was taken at New Romney in the preceding June in endeavouring to make his escape to France He was committed to Newgate and a bill found against him by the grand jury  June  To preserve or at least to prolong his life he fell upon the expedient of obtaining a pardon as a price of discoveries to the King Through the means of the Duke of Devonshire he conveyed a paper to William when he was in Flanders containing an account of correspondences and intrigues carried on with the court of St Germains by the Duke of Shrewsbury the Earls of Bath and Marlborough the Lord Godolphin and Admiral Russel Though this account is known now to be true in every particular it neither gained William's favour nor served the design of Fenwick The persons accused were too powerful to be punished Besides Fenwick had refused to be an evidence and had he done otherwise the proofs which he could produce were not sufficient in law His trial however was delayed by various means till the King's arrival in England His friends in the mean time removed one of the two witnesses on whose oaths the bill had been found and according to the statutes of treason a single witness was not sufficient to condemn  He is attained and executed  William is said to have entertained a personal enmimity  James II  against Fenwick for some expressions reflecting on his conduct when he served in the army in Holland This disposition in the King's mind combined with the resentment of the accused persons contributed to punish in a very irregular manner that unfortunate man Admiral Russel by the express permission of William was the first who laid before the commons the information of Fenwick which reflected on himself and several other persons of high rank The prisoner was brought to the bar of the house and required to confess all he knew  Journals Nov  He declined to obey without assurances of pardon were first given Upon a vote passed on his own paper a  bill of attainder was introduced against Fenwick  Journals Nov  He was heard by his council But the weight o  the crown and the interest of his enemies prevailed  The bill passed the commons after violent debate  Nov agai  and though much opposed in the upperhouse  it received the sanction of the lords  against Feb  and the as+sent of the King On the twentyeighth of January  he was beheaded on Towerhill His behaviour a  his death was more spirited than his conduct in prison  The precedent established in his case was justly deemed dangerous as nothing could be less excused  than the employing of the whole force of the legisla+ture to take away the life of a man whom the law  of treason could not condemn The death of Fen+wick was not of such consequence to the public quie  as to justify this violent exertion of the ultimate pow+er reposed in the state  Ja  II    Obsequiousness of parliament  An uninterrupted complaisance to the crown conti+nued throughout the session The commons provided  with chearfulness for the service of the year The  made good eight hundred and forty thousand pounds  which the funds for the last had fallen short  Feb  Upon a message from the King they granted a suppl  of more than five hundred thousand pounds for th  support of the civil list They as the last gift of th  session made provision for the payment of the deb  for the transports employed in the reduction of Ire+land The liberality of the commons raised in som  degree the resentment of the people They we  openly traduced as corrupt by individuals The  were frequently besieged in their houses by mob  The public business being finished on the sixteen  of April the King put an end to the session with  speech from the throne He thanked the commo  for their large supplies He informed both house  that he found it necessary to go for some time abroa  But that he would take care to leave the administr  +tion  of government in the hands of persons upon whom he could depend  April    Sunderland in office  An event which happened three days after the rising of parliament rendered remarkable the paragraph with which his Majesty closed his speech To the astonishment of the nation he raised the Earl of Sunderland to the office of lordchamberlain in the room of the Earl of Dorset who had suffered himself to be bought out of his place with the public money That this lord uniformly betrayed the late King to the views of the present when Prince of Orange is now known and was even then suspected by the intelligent There seemed therefore to have been a degree of imprudence in the appointment though the place which he held before in William's favour entitled him to a part of the management of public affairs On the twentysecond of April the earl was sworn a privycouncillor and as such took his place at the board He was comprehended in the commission of lordsjustices and though at the time in correspondence with James  Stuartpapers James II  was one of those persons on whom William said to his parliament he could thoroughly depend  Congress at Riswick  On the twentyfourth of April the King left Kensington and arrived on the twentyseventh at the Hague The advances made toward a peace in the end of the preceding summer were improved in the winter William had named in the month of December three plenipotentiaries to negociate a treaty The French King had appointed two persons in the like capacity to be joined to Calliers who had long carried on a negociation at the Hague The Emperor and the court of Spain threw various objections in the way But these being at length overruled by the rest of the allies a congress was agreed to be opened under the mediation of Charles the Eleventh King of Sweden That Prince dying in the mean time the office of mediator was transferred to his son The ambassadors of the belligerent powers met  on the ninth of May at a house belonging to the King of England in the neighbourhood of Riswick a village situated between Delft and the Hague  The peace opposed by the Emperor and Spain  France and the maritime powers seemed to find little difficulty in defining their respective claims England and Holland had scarce any farther concern in the treaty than to settle a barrier in Flanders and to procure an ample acknowledgment of William's right to the throne Calliers then sole plenipotentiary for Lewis the Fourteenth in Holland had consented as early as the tenth of February to preliminaries which declared that Strasbourg should be restored to the Emperor Mons Charleroi Dinant and the whole duchy of Luxembourg together with the conquests in Catalonia to the Spaniards the duchy of Lorrain to its native Prince and that the title of William should be acknowledged without any manner of difficulty restriction condition or reserve But that the claims of other Princes should be left to be settled by the treaty for a general peace to be negociated under the mediation of the King of Sweden The house of Austria however in neither of its branches seemed willing to put an immediate end to the war Though Spain was destitute of troops of ships of money and of councils Though the grandees at variance among themselves possessed  credit at court nor authority among the peopl  Though the monarchy tottered through all its exte  sive dominions the influence of a haughty and imp  +rious woman who hated every body and was herse  detested by all swayed the timid mind of Charles t  Second to listen to the court of Vienna and to co  +tinue a war which he abhorred  The cause of their obstinacy  The cause of this obstinacy on the part of the E  +peror Leopold requires to be explained Charl  the Second the last male of that branch of the ho  of Austria which had sat for near two centuries  the throne of Spain was a prince weak in body  feeble in mind subject to melancholy and a slave  passion  a stranger to business timid by constituti  as well as through ignorance His mother who w  sister to the Emperor had endeavoured to protract  own authority as regent by keeping him longer a child in his understanding than he was in his years Don John of Austria though he stript her of her power followed her system The ministers who succeeded Don John pursued the same principle They kept their sovereign a kind of prisoner in his own palace and governed in his name a kingdom long exhausted by a succession of wretched councils The treaty of Nimeguen having established a good understanding between the courts of Madrid and Versailles the King married MariaLouisa daughter of the Duke of Orleans This princess unambitious of governing a weak husband left him at first in the hands of his ministers and her interference at length in favour of France proved fatal to herself In the beginning of the year England and Holland in alliance with the Emperor resolved to draw Spain into the war against Lewis the Fourteenth The Queen died suddenly Mansfeldt the Imperial ambassador and the Count of Oropeza were at no pains to conceal that they had removed by a wicked piece of policy a person who was likely to obstruct their views  Torcy's Memoirs vol i    Intrigues for the Spanish succession  A daughter of the Duke of Neubourg succeeded the unfortunate Queen in the bed of Charles the Second Being sister to the Empress she was firmly attached to the allies and she governed Spain She entered into the views of Leopold for preserving the succession of the crown in his own family in exclusion of the female line Her object was to induce her husband to send for her nephew the archduke to Madrid to be educated as the sole heir of Spain The King for some time resisted her importunities But in the year he yielded to his own fears Alarmed at the progress of the French in the heart of his kingdom he promised to invite the archduke to Spain upon condition that the Emperor should send twelve thousand of his troops to oppose the enemy in Catalonia The slow councils of the court of Vienna obstructed this design till mutual advances toward a  peace were made by France and the maritime powers The Emperor therefore endeavoured when too late to protract the war as favourable to his own views on the Spanish succession  Torcy's Memoirs vol i  Operations in Flanders and Catalonia  While the Emperor and his influence by means of the Queen over the councils of Spain obstructed the treaty with new demands Lewis the Fourteenth declared his resolution to adhere to the articles of the preliminaries His ministers signified in form that the treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen must be the basis of the future peace That it remained with the allies to agree to terms or to prosecute the war This declaration at the congress was strengthened by operations in the field The Mareschal de Catinat invested and took Aesh William was either indifferent as to the fate of the place or unprepared to raise the siege He joined the army in person on the twentyfourth of May The Mareschals de Villeroi and Boufflers were posted too advantageously to be attacked He however disappointed the designs of the French upon Brussels and the fortress of Trois Trous But the chief efforts of Lewis were made on the side of Spain to extricate by disasters the timid mind of Charles the Second from the intrigues of the Emperor The Duke de Vendôme laid siege to Barcelona by land  The Count d'Estrées blocked up the place by sea  The count de Velasco dividing the force with which he proposed to raise the siege was surprised in both his camps and put to flight The city capitulated on the last day of July and that conquest determined the Emperor and Spain to listen to the proposals of a general peace  Hist de Fran  tom iii Hist d'Espange tom ii    Crown of Poland offered to James  The success of the arms of France was balanced by the defeat of her negociations in Poland The deat  of King John Sobieski on the eighth of June in th  preceding year had opened a scene of intrigue for th  crown of that kingdom The predilection of th  Queen for her younger son Alexander in opposi+tion to James the elder divided the friends of the la  King and ruined the influence of his family Many of the Poles had turned their eyes to another quarter The Abbé de Polignac ambassador of France in Poland wrote to his master that thoughts were entertained of the late King of England in the new election for filling the throne and that he had been already named by some of the diets Lewis was eager to seize an opportunity of ridding himself with honour of a Prince whose pretensions he could no longer support He sent de Pomponne to St Germains The friends of James were sanguine for the project But he rejected it himself He told de Pomponne  "that he would ever retain a grateful remembrance of his friends in Poland That however he would not accept of the crown had it actually been offered much less would he endeavour to obtain by solicitation any throne that was not his due That his acceptance of any other scepter would amount to an abdication indeed of that which he deemed his right That therefore he was resolved to remain in his present forlorn condition possessing less hopes than ever of being restored than to do the least act to prejudice his family  James II  "  Conferred on the Elector of Saxony  The selfdenial of James induced Lewis to turn his eyes to the Prince of Conti as a fit candidate for the Polish throne The character of that Prince and above all the bribes and promises distributed by the Abbé de Polignac seemed to have conciliated the suffrages of the whole nation But in the midst of these flattering hopes a new and powerful candidate appeared The Elector of Saxony supporting himself with an armed force advanced to the frontiers of the kingdom and demanded the crown He had removed all objections to his religion by previously abjuring the Lutheran saith He added the force of bribery to less powerful claims On the night before the election a very large sum was distributed in the camp to fortify his party But the majority still adhered to the French The Prince of Conti was declared duly  lected by the primate On the other hand the  bishop of Cujavia also nominated Frederick Augustus Elector of Saxony King of Poland and Great Duke of Lithuania The result of the whole was that the Elector promoted his own interest to such advantage that the Prince of Conti on his arrival in the road of Dantzic on the fifteenth of September found that he came too late to support his pretensions to the crown  James II    The maritime powers and France resolve on a peace  Though the success of the Elector of Saxony in Poland flattered the pride of the Emperor it contributed little to his designs of obstructing the negociations at Riswick The maritime powers were now absolutely under the direction of the King of England who had all along been the life and soul of the confederacy and he had scarce any thing except her acknowledgement of his own right to the throne to settle with France Lewis the Fourteenth had long determined to prefer the benefits of a necessary peace to his engagements to the late King That unfortunate Prince had laid aside all expectations from the aid of France ever since his disappointment in the projected invasion of the preceding year He flattered himself in his lost condition with other hopes He was assured from England that William was in a declining state of health That he was dropsical in his habit of body and that his dissolution seemed t  advance with hasty strides James had formed a new scheme upon the event of his nephew's death H  resolved to return to England though three men shoul  not follow him and to throw himself on the goo  nature of the English nation  Ibid    "It could not en+ter into his mind"  he said  "that the people of Eng+land would treat him with indignities"  and he knew that the majority were determined to preserve all th  just prerogatives of the crown  Ibid    Secret views of the late King  The hopes derived by James from the death  William were dashed from a quarter where  check to his views was then feared The Princess  Denmark had for six years maintained a fair corre  +pondence with her father full of assurances of du  and expressions of repentance The bad health of the King had awakened her ambition with the prospect of the crown She wrote to her father upon this subject She desired to know his pleasure whether he would permit her to ascend the throne according to the act of settlement should the Prince of Orange so she called King William happen to die She accompanied this request with expressions of duty and a seeming readiness to make restitution when opportunity should serve She insinuated that should he refuse to accede to this expedient considering the present disposition of the kingdom he would remove himself further from the hopes of of recovering his throne The scepter she said would fall into worse hands out of which it would not be so easily recovered The reasoning of the Princess was too refined for the temper of her father He told his friends that though he could suffer injustice he could never be persuaded to give it countenance He knew he said that of all restitutions none is harder to make than that of a crown He however excused himself to his daughter and his declared adherence to the resolution of placing himself in the hands of his former subjects put an end to the proposal  James II    He is alarmed at the congress  The late King was no stranger to the endeavours of France to put an end to the war But he could never believe  Ibid  he said that Lewis would wholly neglect his interest in the terms of the peace In the course of the preceding campaign he was for the first time alarmed He pressed in person the French King on the subject His adherents argued the matter with the ministry in vain  Ibid  In the preceding December he sent an agent to the court of Vienna The Emperor was deaf to his intreaties  Ibid  He disregarded at once his misfortunes and his claims upon himself as a Catholic Prince on the score of religion Notwithstanding this repulse from Leopold he rested some faint hopes on the generosity of Lewis the Fourteenth But when the two French plenipotentiaries  de Harlay and de Creci departed from Paris in March to join Callieres at Delft he gave all his hopes away  James II  The event however may serve to shew that Lewis deserved to be more trusted and that he yielded to necessity only when he seemed to the world to neglect the interest of the abdicated King  William hastens the peace  Though the views of the Emperor were disappointed by the apparent resolution of the maritime powers to restore the public tranquility his ministers at the congress discovered no inclination to bring the conferences to a speedy issue It was reserved for William who had been the soul of the war to conclude with a decisive stroke the peace The two armies after the surrender of Aeth lay opposed to one another in the neighbourhood of Brussels The allies under the King were encamped at Cockleberg The Mareschals de Villeroi de Catinat and de Boufflers commanded the French army at Pepinge The Earl of Portland on the part of the King of England and de Boufflers in the name of Lewis met between the armies and held a conference in the open field on the tenth of July They met again on the fifteenth and twentieth of the same month in the same manner But on the twentysixth of July and the second of August they retired to a house in the suburbs of Hall and reduced to writing the terms to which they had agreed in the field  Depôt des Affaires Etrangeres à Versailles    Agrees that the Prince of Wales should succeed him in the throne  The world have hitherto been no less ignorant of the object of these interviews than Europe was then astonished at such an uncommon mode of negociation As William trusted not his three plenipotentiaries at the Hague with his agreement with France mankind justly concluded that a secret of the last importance had been for some time depending between the two kings Time has at length unraveled the mystery Lewis unwilling to desert James proposed that the Prince of Wales should succeed to the crown  of England after the death of William The King with little hesitation agreed to this request He even solemnly engaged to procure the repeal of the act of settlement and to declare by another the Prince of Wales his successor in the throne  James II  This great preliminary being settled other matters of less importance followed of course The fifty thousand pounds a year settled as a jointure upon King James's Queen was agreed to be paid though the money was afterwards retained upon various pretences On the third of August the King left the army and retired to Dieren He sent from thence the Earl of Portland to acquaint the ministers assembled at the congress that he had settled his own affairs and those of his kingdoms with France and that he earnestly pressed the allies and particularly the Emperor to hasten the conclusion of the great work of peace  Reflections on that transaction  Those who ascribe all the actions of William to public spirit will find some difficulty in reconciling this transaction to their elevated opinion of his character In one concession to France he yielded all his professions to England and by an act of indiscretion or through indifference deserted the principles to which he owed the throne The deliverance of the nation was not however the sole object of this Prince Like other men he was subject to human passions and like them when he could gratify himself he served the world Various motives seem to have concurred to induce him to adopt a measure unaccountable on other grounds The projected peace was to secure the crown in his possession for his life He had no children and but few relations and those he never loved The successors provided by the act of settlement he either despised or abhorred and he seems hitherto not to have extended his views beyond the limits of that act Though James had displeased the nation he had not injured William The son had offended neither He might excite compassion but he could be no object of aversion The supposed spuriousness of his birth had been only held  forth to amuse the vulgar and even these would be convinced by the public acknowledgment intended to be made by the very person whose interest was most concerned in the support of that idle tale  The proposal rejected by James  But the same imprudence which lost to the late King the crown excluded for ever his posterity from the throne He told his most Christian Majesty who had made the first overture to him on this important subject that though he could suffer with patience the usurpation of his nephew upon his right he would never permit his own son to be guilty of the same injustice  James II  He urged that should the son reign in his father's lifetime that circumstance would amount to a formal renunciation That the Prince of Wales by succeeding to the Prince of Orange would yield his sole right which was that of his father and being obliged to the people for his elevation the hands which had raised him might at any time justly pull him down from his throne That should he himself be capable of consenting to such a disgraceful proposal in favour of his son he might be justly reproached with departing from his avowed principles and with ruining monarchy by rendering elective an hereditary crown Besides that though he should consent to sacrifice all that he reckoned dear to a mortal enemy the Prince of Orange could only promise a thing which he was not perhaps able to perform That the same parliament that had conferred the royal authority on himself had settled the reversion of the crown on the Princess of Denmark and that therefore by reversing the act of settlement he disjointed the whole chain which bound the people to his government But that should even the Prince of Orange induce the parliament of England to repeal the act of settlement it would be always upon condition of having the Prince of Wales placed in their hands without their being able to give any security either for his person or his conscience  Memorial to the Pope Memorial to the Elector Palatine MS    France more peremptory in her demands  The last consideration was not perhaps the least motive of this deluded Prince for rejecting the only certain prospect that had ever offered itself for restoring his family to the throne The French King perceiving his obstinacy urged not further a point of which James himself could be the only judge The latter endeavoured in the mean time to stop the progress of a treaty with vain protests and with unavailing memorials and remonstrances to the confederate Princes The demand of France for the eventual succession of the Prince of Wales being removed the reestablishment of peace between Lewis and William became absolutely certain The first therefore became more peremptory in his negociations with the Empire and Spain as the allies were already apparently disunited he ordered his ministers at the congress to deliver in the project of a general peace upon the footing of the preliminaries  July  The project was accompanied with a declaration limiting the time of its being accepted to the last day in August The house of Austria were as dilatory in their motions toward a peace as they had been slow in prosecuting the war They paid no regard to the limitations offered by France though they were in no condition for maintaining themselves singly against her power Spain had added to her misfortunes at home a distaster of an alarming king abroad A French squadron under De Pontis had with the assistance of the buccaniers taken Carthagena in America plundered the place of an immense treasure and having escaped the utmost efforts and vigilance of the English sleet arrived safely at Brest on the nineteenth of August  Treaty signed Sept  This fresh misfortune succeeding the capture of Barcelona hastened greatly the conclusion of the treaty on the part of Spain The Emperor however continued obstinate and he was deserted by the rest of the allies William having settled his own concerns with France had left the army on the third of August and retired to Dieren He dispatched from thence the Earl of Portland to the Hague He ordered  him to acquaint the congress that he had adjusted matters in such a manner with Lewis the Fourteenth that no delay in the general peace should arise from his concerns That therefore he earnestly pressed the allies and particularly the Emperor to contribute all that lay in their power toward concluding so great a work This declaration of the King was regarded as a command The plenipotentiaries of the States signed the treaty on the ninth of September about midnight Their example was taken in an hour after by the ambassador of Spain and he was followed by the plenipotentiaries of England The treaties of Munster and Nimeguen served as a basis for that with Holland The places taken in Catalonia the duchy of Luxembourg the county of Chinei Charleroi Mons Aeth Courtrai and all places united to France by the chambers of Metz and Brisac were restored to Spain The King of England agreed to pay fifty thousand pounds a year by way of jointure to King James's Queen and Lewis the Fourteenth engaged not to disturb William in the possession of his kingdoms  Vid Treaty    Peace between France and the Emperor Oct  Room was left for the Emperor to accede to the treaty and an immediate armistice was procured France having disunited the allies entertained no doubt of forcing the Emperor and Empire into a peace Leopold having complained of being a second time deserted by the Dutch in a pacification with France thought proper at length to comply On the twentieth of October his ambassador signed also the treaty of Riswick The terms were regulated by those of Westphalia and Nimeguen Fribourg Brisga  and Philipsbourg were restored to the Emperor The duchies of Lorrain and Bar were on conditions ren+dered back to his nephew the Duke of Lorrain  Hist d'Allemagne tom vii  and thus a general tranquillity though not destined to last long was reestablished in the North and West o  Europe Objections have been made to the conduc  of the King of England in signing a separate peace  against both the letter and spirit of the grand alliance  But the distresses which would have been brought upon the kingdom through the continuance of a war that ceased with regard to England to have any object and the impotent obstinacy of the Court of Vienna sufficiently justifies William in forcing in a manner the Emperor to the acceptance of reasonable terms  The bloods battle of Zenta  The Emperor had scarce agreed to the treaty of Riswick when he received intelligence of the total defeat of the Turks at Zenta  Sept  a small village on the western bank of Theysse in the kingdom of Hungary The famous Prince Eugene of Savoy had succeeded the Elector of Saxony in the command of the army and to his spirit and conduct was owing the compleat victory which the Imperialists had obtained The slaughter ratehr than the fight lasted from ten in the morning till late at night The two preceding ages though remarkable for battles had not produced so bloody a combat The Ottomans broken by the enemy in front were at the same time attacked in the rear In less than an hour resistance was over on the side of the Turks but the rest of the day was spent in butchery and blood All endeavoured to gain the bridge but it was rendered impassible by the heaps of slain To avoid the fury of the sword thousands threw themselves into the river and were drowned Thirty thousand were said to lie dead on the field before coming of night saved a few fugitives from death The camp of the enemy the magnificent pavillion of the Sultan himself the stores the provisions the ammunition all the cannon and baggage fell into the hands of the Prince Eugene The grand Vizier was killed the seal of the empire taken the Aga of the Janizaries and twentyseven Bashaws were found among the slain Never was victory more complete But the advanced season and the want of resources in the court of Vienna prevented it from having any immediate or striking consequences  Hist d'Allemague    King returns to England Nov  On the thirteenth of November the King embarked for England under the convoy of a fquadron of  men of war and on the fourteenth he arrived at Margate He entered London on the sixteenth amid the acclamations of the populace Intemperance and rio  were mixed with solemn thanksgivings and as every individual had suffered by the waste of the war the whole nation seemed sincerely to rejoice at the return of peace The parliament had been summoned by the lords of the regency to meet on business on the twentythird of November But that assembly wa  further prorogued to the third of December An object of the utmost consequence and in the state o  the times of the greatest difficulty had been communicated by the King to the ministry before his return to England He wished to retain a great part of the standing army in pay after the reestablishment o  peace His servants felt the pulse of the nation by publications on that subject But instead of persuading the people into the views of the Crown they alarmed their fears The resentment of mankind in general was added to their astonishment They saw  with a degree of indignation that those who had mos  violently opposed a standing force in former times wer  the chief supporters of that unpopular measure in th  present reign  A session of Parliament  The session at length was opened on the third o  December with a speech from the throne The Kin  informed his parliament that the war into which h  had entered by the advice of his people was now ter+minated in its object an honourable peace Tha  however he was sorry his subjects could not find a first that relief from the reestablishment of the pub+lic tranquility which either he could have wished  they have expected The funds intended for th  preceding year he told them had failed There wa  a debt on account of the fleet and on the part of th  army The revenues of the crown he said we  anticipated for the public use He himself was who  +ly destitute of means to support the civil list He to  them that he trusted their providing for him durin  his life in a manner suitable to his honour and th  dignity of government He informed them that t  increase of the navy since his accession to the crown had proportionably augmented its charge That the interest and reputation of England rendered necessary a great force at sea The circumstances of affairs abroad he said were such that he assured them England could not be safe without a land force He expressed his hopes that they would not give an opportunity to the enemies of the nation to effect under the notion of a peace what they could not accomplish by a war He therefore desired the commons to consider the matter in such a manner as to provide the necessary supplies  Journals Nov    Views of parties  This speech was construed by the different parties in parliament as they themselves were variously inclined The disaffected deeming it haughty and even insolent in its whole strain Some wished to ease the subject by reducing to a low degree the peaceestablishment Some who loved their country were afraid of a standing army The adherents of James were resolved to distress William on popular grounds The few who harboured in secret republican opinions opposed from principle a measure calculated to place an uncontroulable power in the hands of the King The different views of all the parties centered in one point They were supported by the people in their opposition to the Crown The nation was exhausted with late taxes They were alarmed at the continu  nce of present burdens and terrified at future im  osts The kingdom had derived no advantage from  he peace except the prospect of ease from the dis  ontinuance of the war and the people disappoint  d in their reasonable hopes became discontented  olent and clamorous A more steady but a no  ss determined conduct was observed by the commons  hey addressed the King on his speech in terms full  respect but with great reserve  Nov  They assured  Majesty that as the house had effectually enabled  to cary on the war they were ready to assist and  port him in the time of peace On the seventh of  December the address was read and ordered to be presented by the whole house  Journals Dec    The army ordered to be disbanded  The first resolutions of the commons bore the appearance of moderation though they promised not implicit compliance On a division of the house the friends of the Court carried a vote of supply  Dec  Having inquired into the deficiencies of the aids of the preceding year they resolved that a sum not exceeding six hundred thousand pounds to be raised on the credit of the exchequer should be transferred to the supplies of the next session of parliament On the tenth of December they received the King's answer to their address Though he perceived the design of the commons he receded not from his own purpose He told them as they assisted him beyond expression in the war he had no doubt of an equal zeal in the house to maintain the peace  Dec  This answer signifying plainly the King's wishes to retain a considerable standing force in his pay hastened the discussion of that important point In a committee of the whole house it was resolved without a division the next day  Dec  that all the landforces raised since the twentyninth of September should be paid and disbanded  Arguments for the question  The courtparty urged various arguments for carrying a point in which the King had signified himsel  to be much concerned They urged that as France had not yet disbanded any of her troops it would be dangerous as well as absurd to trust to the faith of a treaty for the safety of the nation They affirmed  that to trust the navy with the protection of the king+dom was to leave the fate of its independence  fortune They averred from the example of th  late revolution that a wind might arise which coul  carry an enemy out of their ports and at the sa  time confine the ships of England to their own ha  +bours They freely owned that some dangers mig  arise to the liberties of the people from a standi  army But they denied it to be true that pub  freedom was always ruined by armies They produced Venice and the States of the United Provinces as examples of this position and they endeavoured to prove that the liberties of France fell through the dark policy of Lewis the Eleventh and not by the means of a military force They attempted to raise the fears of the people by explaining the facility with which the late King might return They represented the disaffection of a part of the nation as too strong to be suppressed without the terrors of a standing army They concluded with observing that as the power of the purse was in the hands of the nation the Crown might without danger be trusted with any degree of the power of the sword  General arguments  On the other side it was urged with vehemence that an island like Britain had little to fear from an enemy whose naval force was inferior to its own They affirmed that the fitting out of a fleet was a work of time That the preparations of the kingdom might in a great measure keep pace with those of the invaders That the confederates would either call the attention of France to another quarter or she might be opposed with effect on the coast of England by troops called from Scotland and Ireland They affirmed that no wind could arise more favourable to the French in quitting their principal ports than to the English in sailing from their own Besides that merely for the bare possibility of such a circumstance no Prince could be supposed to hazard a vast expence upon one improbable contingency That the examples of Venice Holland and France were inapplicable to the present argument That the two republics kept their standing forces only in their conquered countries That though Lewis the Eleventh invaded the liberties of his subjects without public violence a standing army was soon found necessary to support the usurpations of the crown on the natural rights of the people They urged with great force of argument that a militia was the most natural and least dangerous protectors of the kingdom as the gentry freeholders and traders of England were more  concerned in the freedom and safety of their country than soldiers whose only motive to action was pay  Particular reasons against it  They descended from general to particular arguments They averred that the most likely way to restore the late King was to support a standing force to defeat his designs To prove this position they affirmed that the affection of the people was the only rock on which the throne of the Prince could remain firm That when it leans on a standing force it depends on the unsteady humours of the soldiery Revolution and change they shewed from the examples of former ages had proceeded oftener from the caprice of an army than from the violence and inconstancy of the multitude They alleged that the fate of the kingdom would depend on the political principles or the avarice of the chief officers That one might be swayed by an affection for the late King another gained with French money They descended to all the inconveniencies arising from standing armies They mentioned quarrels assassinations robberies the dishonouring of women the insolence to men their injustice to mankind in general the licence derived from the pride of their station their contempt for laws by which they ceased to be confined They however concluded that it was by no means their design to ruin by the peace those who had deserved so well of the nation by their courage fidelity and conduct in the war That their arguments were directed against the thing itself and not against particular men and that therefore the officers ought to receive from the parliament a recompence for the loss of their commissions  Journals    The opposing members prevail  The adherents of the crown propagated rumours of danger without doors to strengthen their arguments within They affirmed that the French ambassador was stopped That the King of Spain was dead That Europe was ready to plunge again into a war They endeavoured to gain the interested with promises to impress the minds of the feeble with fears But these artifices produced no effect on the country party  Some of the latter in the course of their arguments  upbraided the King himself with a breach of faith to the nation They observed that in his declaration when Prince of Orange he promised upon the settlement of the nation to send back all his foreign forces But that instead of adhering to his solemn engagements he still retained a great number of aliens about his person That of his countrymen the Dutch he had a troop of horse of two hundred and twenty men and one regiment of bodyguards of the same nation consisting of four battalions amounting to more than two thousand six hundred soldiers That he had also in the same capacity one regiment of Scots consisting of one thousand six hundred men and that of French refugees who depended on himself alone he had two regiments of dragoons and three of foot falling in all little short of five thousand men The disaffected exaggerated greatly the dangers to be apprehended from these troops They compared them to the pretorian bands who executed the tyrannical decrees of the worst Emperors of Rome and even to the Turkish Janizaries who by being cut off in their infancy from all connexions with the rest of mankind know no umpire but the sword and own no ties but an absolute submission to the will of the reigning Prince  Trenchard's Remarks    The King disgusted  The warmth expressed in these debates excited disgust on both sides The King was highly displeased with the conduct of the commons A majority of the commons were almost dissatisfied with the choice they had made of a King William was at no pains to conceal his sentiments He complained that by reducting his army the commons had rendered him contemptible in the eyes of Europe That he was doubtful whether he could support either his government at home or any of his alliances abroad in his present despicable state That had he foreseen such returns for his services he would never have meddled with English affairs and that he was weary of governing a nation who through their jealousy of the crown exposed their sovereign to contempt and themselves to danger  Burnet vol ii  But when the King vented  his resentment in complaints his chief adviser the Earl of Sunderland yielded to his own fears He had supported with all his eloquence the arguments for a standing army He was deemed the author of the measure He found that the Whigs and the Tories were alike his enemies That the first hated him for his measures in the reign of James That the latter abhorred him for his treachery to that Prince He therefore resolved to prevent the falling of the storm by resigning the office of lordchamberlain  Dec  and retiring into the country The anxiety of William to keep Sunderland near his person  Burnet vol iii  was construed by his enemies into a kind of criminal gratitude for that lord's betraying the councils of his predecessor  The large provision for the civil list  The resolution for reducing the army to seven thousand men being carried the commons brought a bill  Dec  into their house for regulating the militia and for rendering them serviceable to the nation They voted the next day  Dec  that ten thousand men were necessary for a summer and winter guard at sea They resolved that a sum not exceeding seven hundred thousand pounds should be granted to his Majesty for the support of the civil list  Dec  They at the same time passed a bill against corresponding with the late King and his adherents They agreed to an act for continuing the imprisonment of several persons accused of being privy to the late conspiracy against the life of the King They voted three hundred and fifty thousand pounds for maintaining guards and garrisons for the year  Jan  They granted a supply not exceeding two millions seven hundred thousand pounds to answer and cancel all exchequer bills To reconcile the army to the projected reduction they ordered a gratuity to the common soldiers and halfpay to such officers as were naturalborn subjects of England till they should be provided for in some other manner  Jan  They provided for  the deficiencies of former funds  Jan  They resolved to pay the sums due for subsidies to the allies  Feb  They considered the state of the national debts and voted that all arrears should be gradually paid  obtained by an artifice of the King  The King is said to have owed the large sum for the support of the civil list more to his own management than to the generosity of the commons The leading members had designed to give only six hundred thousand pounds for that purpose But William told the adherents of the Princess of Denmark that he intended to form a houshold for her son the Duke of Gloucester and that the establishment would require fifty thousand pounds  Duchess of Marlborough Burnet  He insinuated at the same time to such members as still retained some regard for the late King that he had promised to pay to the exiled Queen her jointure amounting to fifty thousand pounds in consequence of an agreement with France at the treaty of Riswick This precaution facilitated the grant of an addition of one hundred thousand pounds a year to the civil list He however found means to retain in his own hands the money destined for the Queen The Earl of Portland being sent ambassador to Paris in the beginning of the year insisted that in the conferences between himself and the Mareschal de Boufflers the latter had promised secretly that King James should be removed from St Germains He averred that this removal was the condition of the payment of the jointure Boufflers denied the fact But Lewis the Fourteenth was not in a disposition to argue the matter with William  James II  The King observed the same strain of oeconomy with regard to the Duke of Gloucester An establishment for that Prince was not made for some time after the provision for the civil list was granted and when his houshold was at length formed fifteen thousand pounds a year were only given  Duchess of Marlborough    An inquiry into grants and fraudulent indorsements of exchequer bills  An attempt made  Jan  by the opposition in the house of commons to apply a part of the forfeited estates to the use of the public was disappointed by  the art of the court party The latter insisted on beginning with the grants of the two preceding reigns The persons affacted by the amendment opposed the motion They joined their influence with those who had received grants from the reigning Prince Petitions were presented on every side Difficulties were raised and the whole matter was dropt as the interests of all parties were concerned in defeating the measure During this attempt toward a kind of resumption of grants another enquiry of some importance employed a part of the attention of the commons The exchequer bills upon their being first issued bore no interest But on their being paid in upon any of the taxes and issued a second time they were intitled to seven and a half  per cent  interest This circumstance induced some of the King's officers in the exchequer customs and excise to place false endorsements on the bills before they had been circulated at all One Duncomb who was receivergeneral of the excise had amassed a fortune by this fraudulent practice sufficient to protect himself and the partners of his guilt from justice He was expelled the house  Journals  A bill fining him in half his estate valued at the enormous sum of four hundred thousand pounds passed the commons The lords were equally divided But the duke of Leeds being in the chair of the committee rejected the bill by his casting voice The wealth of Duncomb and the character of Leeds gave rise to reflections less improbable than difficult to be ascertained  A new EastIndia company established  Debates on the expediency of enlarging the stoc  of the East India company employed the latter par  of this long session of parliament The company by bribing the King and corrupting his servants had ob+tained in September a new charter exclusiv  of the interlopers on their trade These interlopers  consisting of some capital merchants had been  several sessions supported in their pretensions b  various votes of the commons The old company  by the suggestion of some persons in power offere  seven hundred thousand pounds at four  per cent  the service of government upon condition of having their own exclusive charter confirmed by an act of parliament The other merchants protected by Mountague chancellor of the exchequer proposed to the house of commons to advance two millions at eight  per cent  in consideration of an exclusive trade to be vested in the subscribers A bill was ordered to be brought in upon this offer for settling the commerce to the East Indies The old company petitioned in vain against the bill in the lower house  Journals  They followed it to no purpose to the lords The royal assent was given on the fifth of July and such was the eagerness of the nation to employ their money in the stock of the new company that the subscription of two millions was filled in the space of three days  Parliament dissolved  The two houses having finished the public business were prorogued on the fifth of July Two days after a proclamation was issued for disolving the parliament in terms of the triennial act The King's speech was less suitable to his temper than to sound policy He congratulated his parliament on the association on their remedying the corruption of the coin on their restoring public credit He thanked them for their supplies for the war their provision for maintaining the peace and satisfying with the the least burden possible to his people the debt of the nation He told the commons that he deemed himself personally obliged to their house for their regard to his honour in establishing a permanent revenue for the civil list He assured both houses that he valued nothing so much as the esteem and love of his people and that as for their sake he had avoided no hazard in war he should make it his whole study and care to improve and continue the advantages and blessings of peace  Ibid July    Embassy of Portland to France  Though William pretended to part on the best terms with his parliament the rigid behaviour of the commons with regard to the army made a lasting impression on his mind and even affected his conduct Deeming himself left at the mercy of his enemies  by the reduction of his forces he endeavoured to secure himself against France by gaining her confidence and flattering her favourite views The Earl of Portland who had declined in favour though he still retained the esteem of the King was sent with a splendid equipage in the character of ambassador extraordinary to the court of Versailles He made his public entry into Paris on the twentyseventh of February with a pomp more suitable to the vanity of Lewis than the gravity of his own master The court of France answered the advances made by the King of England with equal ardour from views of their own The pretensions of the house of Bourbon on the succession of the Spanish monarchy had employed the mind of the French King ever since the signing of the treaty of Riswick The distresses brought upon his kingdom by his exertions in the war joined to a decline in his own ambition rendered him extremely anxious for the continuance of the peace and he was willing to relinquish in a great measure the claims of his family to obtain that desirable end  Intrigues for the Spanish succession March  The relapse of Charles the Second into one of those fits of illness which were so common to his feeble constitution gave fresh spirit to the intrigues of the competitors for his crown The only pretenders to the succession prior to the treaty of Riswick were the Emperor and the Elector of Bavaria The first as the male representative of the family of Austria The latter as the husband of an Archduchess the only surviving child of the Emperor by the second daughter of Philip the Fourth of Spain The powers of Europe from a jealousy and fear of the house of Bourbon had contested the right of the Dauphin of France though the son of the eldest daughter Maria Theresa Philip himself to her exclusion had declared the descendants of her younger sister Margaret born of a second bed the heirs of his crown The son of the Elector of Bavaria in default of male issue by Charles the Second would  therefore have possessed the whole succession i  either the testament of Philip the Fourth or the re+nunciation  of his eldest daughter at her marriage with the French King had been deemed valid and decisive  De Torcy vol i    Negociations of France in Spain  The Elector of Bavaria either diffident of his right or of his own power to support his claims had applied for the protection of Lewis the Fourteenth and had desired to know from that Prince what part of the Spanish dominions he would chuse to reserve for himself Lewis returned an evasive answer and in December sent the Marquis d'Harcourt in the character of ambassador to learn the state of parties in Spain to enquire into the views of the court the disposition of the grandees and above all to discover and traverse the secret measures of the Imperial ministers Though he found that the party which favoured the lineal succession in the family of Bourbon were the most numerous they had the least credit The Queen and her creatures favoured the Emperor and held the reins of government When they despaired of the life of the King they injured with their eagerness the cause which they wished to promote The Prince of Hesse Darmstadt who governed in Catalonia supplanted the Spanish officers with Germans and took every measure that seemed calculated to secure that province for the house of Austria while he ultimately disobliged the Spaniards without accomplishing his own views  Ibid    A treaty of partition proposed to William  Such was the situation of affairs soon after the arrival of the Earl of Portland at the court of France Lewis the Fourteenth wishing to preserve the peace was still inclined to a partition of the dominions of Spain Finding it needless to treat with the Emperor he discovered an inclination to enter into treaty with the King of England But the unexpected demands of Portland obstructed for some time the designs of Lewis The Earl plainly told that Prince that he did not expect to find King James at St Germains He complained of that circumstance as a breach of a promise made by the Mareschal de Boufflers in their conserences in Flanders The Mareschal denied the  whole affair Portland continued obstinate But when William disapproved of his conduct he changed his tone He protested that agreeable to the intentions of his master he would be glad to establish a good understanding and even a perfect harmony between that Prince and the French King The latter was encouraged upon these assurances to propose to William a partition of the Spanish monarchy nearly on the same plan as that concluded with the Emperor Leopold about thirty years before  De Torcy vol i  Portland sent a courier to England with the proposals of the court of France William was guarded and undecisive in his answer But his language discovered that he was far from being averse from the measure  Ibid  Negotiations for that purpose in England  Lewis perceiving that Portland was not sufficiently instructed to conclude the treaty on which he had fixed his mind sent the Comte de Tallard with full powers to England That minister arrived in London on the nineteenth of March William disapproved of the mode of partition proposed by France But the defenceless state in which he had been lest by his parliament induced him to listen to any terms calculated to continue the repose of Europe Besides his health was declining and a feeble constitution had subjected him to a premature old age  His Answer to the French Ambassador  He was become inactive in his person and his ambition and love of glory had declined in proportion as his unfitness for the field arose The negotiation begun in France between Lewis and the Earl of Portland was continued in England between William and Tallard Portland in the mean time was recalled and succeeded in his embassy by his brotherinlaw the Earl of Jersey A friendly correspondence subsisted between the two courts during the summer But though the negociation advanced it was not destined to be concluded till William by the dissolution of his parliament found leisure to repair to Holland  De Torcy vol i    Earl of Marlborough restored to office  At the settlement of the revenue for the civil list the King had engaged to the adherents of the Princess of Denmark to form an establishment for her son the Duke of Gloucester who was now arrived at an age to be placed in the hands of men The Earl of Marlborough had retained his influence with the Princess during his disgrace with the King and William who respected his parts though he disliked his principles made use of the present occasion to recall him to his presence The Earl had lessened his professions to the late King in proportion as the views of restoration entertained by that unfortunate Prince declined He therefore was under no difficulty in accepting William's returning favour He was appointed governor of the Duke of Gloucester on the nineteenth of June and on the sixteenth of July he was declared one of the lordsjustices for the administration of government during his Majesty's intended absence abroad  Gazette  The first officers of state were named in the commission But the chief management of affairs rested in the hands of the Lord Somers then chancellor admiral Russel who had been created Earl of Orford and Mountague a man of vivacity and scheming abilities who had for some time served with reputation as chancellor of the exchequer  The King goes abroad  William sailed from Margate on the twentieth of July and on the twentysecond he arrived at the Hague His leaving the kingdom was construed by his enemies into an unjust preference given to Holland over a country which had raised him to a throne The nation was uneasy under an unusual burden of public debt and malcontents and designing men inflamed the passions of the people to forward their own views The press teemed with bold publications Complaints were mixed with the conversations of the idle the discontented and the speculative The tumult and noise of a general election furnished an ample field for declaimers of every kind The corruptions which had crept into parliaments were a great topic of disquisition Complaints were made  that one hundred and sixteen members of the lower house were in office That many more were devoted to the Crown by means of secret pensions or expectations of reward To this circumstance the generality of mankind ascribed their misfortunes and they laid to the charge of the King an evil which sprung from the weight thrown by the increase of the public revenue in the scale of the crown  State Tracts    Proceedings of  On the day of the King's departure from London the parliament of Scotland met at Edinburgh The Earl of Marchmont then lord chancellor of that kingdom was nominated commissioner and the session was opened with reading the King's letter in the usual form His Majesty thanked them for their chearful and in the war He congratulated them upon the blessings to be expected from an honourable peace He laid on the urgency of his present affairs the blame of his not appearing in his kingdom of Scotland in person an excuse uniformly made every session since he came to the throne He informed them that he judged it necessary for their preservation that the forces upon their present establishment should be continued He recommended the raising supplies for making good the deficiencies in former grants for paying the arrears of the army and for repairing the forts He concluded with assuring them of his care to maintain their laws religion and liberties and of his royal favour and firm protection in all their concerns  Letter to the Scot Parl    the parliament of Scotland  Upon the report of the committee for the security of the kingdom the parliament voted that there was a necessity for continuing the present standing force Notwithstanding this complaisance to the views of the King the Scotish nation in general entertained a wellfounded resentment against the Crown Their commercial company was not only discouraged by the ministry but even injuriously treated by William himself He had made his court to the parliament of England by disavowing in some measure the acts of the parliament in Scotland He had even carried  his opposition to the new commercial company established by the Scots beyond the limits of his own dominions In England the two houses of parliament had terrified the merchants from subscribing to the funds formed by the Scotish company The jealousy of the Dutch prevented money from being found in their country The King's resident at Hamburgh terrified with menaces the merchants of that city from performing their contract for furnishing the deputies of the company with at least two hundred thousand pounds sterling Their remonstrances to the King though favourably answered produced no beneficial effect His residents abroad were not hindred from obstructing the subscriptions solicited by the company They even disowned the authority of the acts of parliament and the letters patent upon which the Scotish company was founded  Petition of the gen council to parl    on the affair of Darien  These disappointments arising from acts which were deemed unjust roused the resentment of the nation to an uncommon degree But the majority of their representatives were gained to the interest of the King either by the possession or expectation of the wretched pittance of offices in the gift of the Crown The parliament it is true addressed the King upon the subject but in terms that by softening the complaint seemed little calculated either to command or expect redress The company were also induced by the ministry to transmit a soothing petition of their own to William In opposition to the public memorials presented against their deputies in Hamburgh they requested an intimation to be made to the senate of that city that they might enter into commerce with the Scotish company Instead of demanding that assistance from government which had been solemnly promised by the King they desired only as a mark of the royal favour the use of two of the smallest frigates that lay useless in the harbour of Burntisland These unmanly representations scarce deserved any return and they received none that was favourable  The parliament was in the mean time adjourned  Sept  They seemed only to have raised the present expectations of their constituents to aggravate their future disappointments  Affairs of Ireland  SIR Charles Porter lord chancellor of Ireland dying at Dublin of an apoplexy on the eighth of December left the kingdom in a state of tranquillity under his two colleagues in the government the Earls of Montrath and Drogheda Irish affairs exhibited nothing remarkable in nor in the succeeding year till the parliament met in the end of September The lordsjustices in their speech to that assembly recommended to their care the settlement of the linen manufacture as more advantageous than the woollen the latter being the stapletrade of England They told them that the King since the peace had sent into that kingdom a part of the forces who had served abroad during all the war That he had disbanded the greatest part of the forces who had served in Ireland with a resolution however to continue their subsistence to the officers They concluded with informing them that the King expected to be enabled to support the present establishment and that for that purpose an account of what the revenue produced for one year from Midsummer should be laid before the house of commons  Journals Sept    Proceedings of parliament  Illhumours which seemed to lurk in the lower house were suppressed by a considerable majority in favour of the Crown A supply was granted for the support of the establishment  Oct  An attempt to address the King to disband the five regiments of French Protestants then in Ireland was overruled A tax was voted on old and new drapery that should be exported An impost of thirty thousand pounds was laid upon lands in addition to ninety thousand already imposed Notwithstanding this liberality to the Crown the lordsjustices adjourned the two houses without the usual ceremony of a speech of thanks An act was passed in this session for confirming the estates  and possessions held and enjoyed under the acts of settlement and explanation A bill for the better security of his Majesty's person and government was introduced and after a debate rejected and though the Crown had warmly recommended to the parliament to encourage the linen in preference to the woollen manufacture as interfering with England the commons annexed to their vote of supply a resolution to regulate the woollen trade of Ireland  Oct    William in Holland  During these transactions in Scotland and Ireland the King was employed in Holland in conferences with the Comte de Tallard on the subject of the partition treaty proposed by the French King William having in some measure resolved before his departure from England to accede to the overtures made by France communicated in part his design to the Lord Somers the great seal of England being necessary to render valid the treaty which he proposed to conclude No other person born in England seems to have been trusted with a transaction whose efficacy depended upon its being kept a profound secret On the sixth of August the King arrived at Loo He was followed to that place by Tallard and on the fifteenth of the month the King wrote to the lord chancellor for full powers under the great seal with blanks for names to treat with the French ambassador The desire expressed by the King when he wrote to Somers to receive his advice on the subject of the negociation seems to have been an unmeaning compliment as the treaty itself was concluded  August  four days after the letter was sent from Loo To press the necessity of the treaty and to urge the chancellor to hasten the seal the King assured him that  ccording to all intelligence the King of Spain could  ot outlive the month of October  William to  August    First partition treaty signed  Though the articles were settled on the nineteenth  f August the treaty itself was not concluded in form  the first of October It was signed by the Comte  e Tallard as ambassador of France to the King of  England by De Briord as in the same capacity t  the Republic of Holland and by the ministers o  William and those of the States Upon the eventua  demise of the King of Spain his dominions were to b  partitioned to the competitors for his crown in th  following manner The Dauphin was to possess i  Italy the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily the ports o  the Tuscan shore and the Marquisate of Final o  the side of Spain the province of Guipuscoa or i  more precise terms all the Spanish territories on th  French side of the Pyrenees or the mountains of Na  +varra Alava and Biscay Spain the Indies and th  sovereignty of the Netherlands were allotted for th  electoral Prince of Bavaria and in case of his death  to his father the Elector who had no pretension  whatsoever on the succession of Spain The dukedom of Milan formed the share designed for the ArchDuk  Charles the Emperor's second son  De Torcy vol i p    Its effect on the Spanish court  The contracting powers mutually engaged to keep the treaty a profound secret during the life of th  King of Spain This condition though necessary  was very difficult to be executed The avowed de+sign of the alliance was the preservation of the re+pose of Europe There was therefore a necessit  for the allies to satisfy the Emperor at the same tim  that they limited his views It was impossible to ren+der him well pleased with a treaty which deprive  him of the great object of his ambition It was neces+sary to terrify him into a compliance William from a persuasion of his own influence with Leopold un+dertook to communicate the treaty to that Princ  and to gain by prudential considerations his consen  But when these views were in agitation intelligenc  of the treaty of partition was conveyed by some mea  or other from Holland to Madrid The King  Spain resenting a division made of his dominions  foreigners called a council of his whole ministry Th  result was a will instituting the electoral Prince  Bavaria his universal heir according to the testame  of Philip the Fourth in favour of the descendants  his second daughter in exclusion of the house of Bourbon The King himself unexpectedly recovered in some degree from his illness and the hopes and fears of Europe were suspended for the year  A new parliament  William having remained in Holland till the first of December arrived on the fourth of the month at Kentington The parliament had been frequently prorogued to wait the King's return The people became discontented at his long absence as he had not now the excuse of business and war The new parliament met at Westminster on the sixth of December  Journals Dec  The commons chose Sir Thomas Littleton for their speaker The King approved their choice on the ninth of the month and made a speech from the throne He doubted not he said but they were met with hearts fully disposed to provide for the safety and to preserve the honour and happiness of the kingdom Two things he told them seemed to demand their consideration to acquire that desirable end What strength ought to be maintained at sea What force to be kept up by land He observed that the flourishing of trade the supporting of credit the quieting the minds of the people at home and the weight and influence of England abroad depended upon the opinion the nation and foreigners should form of the security of the kingdom He recommended to the commons to make some farther progress in discharging the debts contracted in a long and expensive war and he concluded with observing that as the things he had mentioned were of common concern he could not but hope for unanimity and dispatch  Dec    Resentment against the King's speech  William however was soon convinced that his hopes of unanimity in favour of his own views were illfounded The bad grace with which he had yielded to the reduction of the army in the preceding year his evasive execution of the act passed for that purpose his long absence from the kingdom without any important reason a jealousy arising to his people from his apparent neglect of sea affairs which he owned he never understood  Burnet  his known predilection  for land forces his fresh demand for an increase in their number in England the care he took to continue the military establishments in his other kingdoms were all calculated to raise the resentment and to awaken the fears of parliament The commons in particular were so much incensed at his speech that contrary to the usual custom of their house they voted no address Even the lords agreed not to their address till the twentysecond of December and when presented  Jan  it was found to be conceived in very general and undecisive terms His own servants seemed to have deserted William upon the present occasion The current of the nation against a standing army ran extremely high The ministry therefore were unwilling to expose themselves to the rage of the people by gratifying the King  The army reduced to seven thousand men  When the affair of the army came under debate in the house of commons the ministry produced no estimates and they made no proposals The whole business devolved on the countryparty They proposed seven thousand men as a sufficient establishment for guards and garrisons and they carried their motion with little difficulty On the seventeenth of December it was resolved that all the land forces in England in English pay and these naturalborn subjects should be forthwith paid and disbanded That all the forces in Ireland excepting twelve thousand men and these also naturalborn subjects maintained by that kingdom should be likewise disbanded A bill was immediately brought in upon this resolution and prosecuted with ardour It was provided by the firs  enacting clause that the army in England and Wale  should be reduced on or before the twentysixth o  March then ensuing except such regiments troops  and companies not exceeding seven thousand men  as before the first day of the same month should b  particularly expressed in a proclamation under th  great seal The lords exhibited the same spirit an  zeal with the commons An opposition to the bi  was made by some of the adherents of the crown B  the attempt was so feeble and illsupported that it threw disgrace on the cause that was meant to be served  Burnet vol ii    William displeased threatens to abandon the kingdom  The opposition made by the friends of William tended only to furnish his enemies with an opportunity of being severe on his character and conduct They insinuated that he neither loved the nation in general not placed any confidence in Englishmen That he left the kingdom in the preceding summer without any apparent excuse for his absence That he was employed neither in the concerns of the people as King nor in the affairs of the States as Stadtholder That he went merely to enjoy a lazy privacy at Loo with a few favourites and creatures in a manner unworthy of his character and unsuitable to his dignity  Burnet vol iii  These open complaints and insinuations of the same kind rendered fretful the mind of William naturally peevish melancholy and severe His deportment when he was humoured the most was stiff ungracious and cold But now his resentment had so far overcome his prudence that he alternately yielded to fits of passion or sunk under a load of despondence He is even said to have formed a resolution of abandoning the kingdom and that he had prepared a speech in which he was to request of the two houses to name such persons as they should think fit to manage a government that he himself was resolved no longer to hold  He yields to the commons  This speech intended to be pronounced on the fourth of January was never publicly made The private insinuations of the King were little regarded as they were not deemed sincere He had twice since his expedition into England derived advantage from the same threat But the expedient was now too seale either to alarm the fears of the people or to gain the favour of parliament Prudence at length overcame some part of the resentment of William He resolved to comply with a measure to which the two houses seemed determined to adhere On the first of February he came to pass the bill for disbanding  the army and made a speech from the throne He informed his parliament that he came to pass the bill as soon as he understood it was ready to receive his assent That though there appeared great hazard in disbanding such a number of troops in the present state of affairs and that though he might think himself unkindly treated in being deprived of those guards who had come along with him from Holland to the aid of England and who had attended him in all the actions in which he had been engaged yet being convinced of the fatal consequences of any jealousies that might arise between himself and his people he was resolved for that reason only to give his concurrence to the bill He however informed them that he thought himself obliged for his own justification and in discharge of the trust reposed in his hands to declare plainly his judgment that the nation was left too much exposed He deemed it therefore incumbent upon them as the representatives of the people to provide such a force as should be necessary for the safety of the kingdom and the preservation of the peace of Europe  Solicits them for his Dutch guards in vain  The commons in some measure complied with William's desire with regard to the security of the nation Though they were inflexibly resolved to reduce the landforces they increased to fifteen thousand men the establishment by sea  Feb  The necessary orders were in the mean time issued for disbanding the army But his predilection for his favourite Dutch guards recurred again to the King's mind On the eighteenth of March he sent a message written in his own hand to the house of commons by the Earl of Ranelagh paymastergeneral of the forces  March  He told them that the necessary preparations were made for transporting the guards who came with him to England That he intended to send them away immediately from the kingdom unless the house out of consideration to him should finds means to continue them longer in his service a measure which his Majesty  Journals Feb  would construe into an act of great kindness This condescending expedient produced no favourable effect on the commons The question that a day should be appointed for considering the message was carried in the negative A committee was appointed to frame an address representing the reasons why the commons could not comply The address was accordingly presented on the twentyfourth of March The answer of William contained a recapitulation of his own services to the nation his confidence in their fidelity to his person and his resolution to preserve entire the constitution which he had restored  March    Parliament prorogued  The provision made by the commons for the effectual reduction of the army was the last business of importance in this refractory session The two houses however continued to sit till the fourth of May Though William yielded to his prudence he could neither conceal his resentment nor suppress his complaints for the unkind treatment which he had received from the commons He furnished an example of both in his speech from the throne when he prorogued the parliament In any light in which the subject is viewed the King had little reason to be pleased But the sallies of passion into which he is said to have fallen require better authorities than those by which they are supported to be implicitly believed His disappointments throughout furnished matter of triumph to his enemies But they dwelt with most malevolence on the supposed meanness of his message to the commons in favour of his Dutch guards The conduct of the commons cannot however be disapproved Though no danger ought perhaps to be apprehended from such an insignificant number of foreigners there was a kind of necessary dignity in committing entirely to the natives the security of a free country  CHAP IV  A general tranquillitySecond partitiontreatyInsolence of the Spanish ambassadorAffairs of the NorthScotish affairsChange in the ministryA session of parliamentIrish

emptiness of his coffers the discontents of his subjects the seditious humour of the Janisaries had involved the latter Prince in unsurmountable difficulties and had rendered him utterly incapable of recovering in the summer of the laurels which he had lost in the preceding campaign  Hist de France tom iii  The eyes of both parties being turned to the same object they contented themselves with covering their respective frontiers with their armies A similar inactivity had subsisted during the summer between the Russians and the Porte on the side of the Lesser Tartary and though the Venetians had obtained some advantages in the Archipelago their operations produced no effect on the cordial desire exhibited by all parties for entering into conferences for restoring peace  Hist Ottomane tom ii    Peace between the Emperor and the Porte  The King of England and the States of the United Provinces had offered by their ambassadors their mediation to the belligerent powers But the intrigues of Lewis the Fourteenth in Constantinople had long disappointed their views On the seventh of November the plenipotentiaries met at Carlowitz De Feriole who had succeeded Châteauneuf in the management of the affairs of France at the Porte made various but vain efforts to persuade the Turks to continue the war  Ibid  The treaty was signed on the twentysixth of January by the plenipotentiaries of Mustapha the Second the Emperor Leopold the King of Poland and the Czar of Moscovy and soon after by those of the republic of Venice All Hungary on this side of the Saave with Transylvania and Sclavonia were ceded to the house of Austria The Czar remained in possession of Azoph Caminiec was restored to the Poles The Venetians were gratified with all the Morea and several places in Dalmatia and thus a temporary tranquillity was restored though the seeds of discord were already sown in all the corners of Europe  Hist du Nord tom ii    The first partition treaty defeated  The treaty of partition which the King of England concluded with France at the peril of the utmost resentment of his subjects was suddenly rendered useless by a coincidence of events The King of Spain contrary to the expectations of all Europe recovered in some degree from his illness and the electoral Prince of Bavaria whom the treaty of partition and the will of Charles the Second had destined for the throne of Spain and the Indies died at Brussels on the eighth of February  N S  The Elector disappointed in the views of his ambition attributed the death of his son to more than his distemper But as he produced no proofs his suspicions were ascribed to grief more than to any just grounds of complaint Though provision had been made by a secret stipulation to substitute the father in the place of the son upon the eventual death of the latter that article of the treaty as it was founded upon no pretensions possessed by the Elector was equally disregarded by both the contracting powers France shewed an inclination to propose a new convention to the King of England on the plan of the former treaty But though William entertained a design of renewing his engagements the moment he heard of the death of the Prince  De Torcy vol i  his embarrassment with regard to the disagreeable proceedings of parliament drove all other thoughts from his mind during the sitting of that assembly  William  ens to another  The leisure necessary for the settlement of foreign affairs was fought after by William in Holland Having made several changes in the ministry and declared a regency to govern the kingdom in his absence he left Kensington on the first of June and in the evening of the third arrived at the Hague On the twenty second of June he left that place and retired to Loo where and at Dieren he spent the most part of the season in his favourite diversion of hunting Tallard who had managed so successfully the treaty of the preceding year was ordered by hi  court to repair to Loo in the beginning of July to  ttle measures as they were called for preserving  the tranquillity of Europe William very early in the year had given orders of the same kind to his ambassador at Paris He approved therefore with little difficulty of the scheme proposed by de Tallard That Spain and the Indies should be left to the Archduke That the duchy of Milan should be added to the portion intended for the Dauphin and that the Netherlands should be settled in such a manner as might entirely prevent any jealousy in England or umbrage in Holland  De Torcy vol i    Intelligence of his views sent to Spain  This negociation though committed only to a few individuals continued not long a secret from the world The Spanish ambassador at the Hague sent intelligence by a courier to Madrid The court was alarmed The King himself in the midst of his weakness was highly offended at a measure which hurt his pride He remonstrated in the strongest terms against the behaviour of William to his ambassador at Madrid He ordered the Marquis de Canailles his own minister at London to represent in England his high displeasure at the indignity offered to himself and his crown The Marquis in his memorial to the lords of the regency followed the dictates of his own malignity more than the interest of his sovereign He told them that his master had been informed that William the Dutch and other powers were actually hatching new treaties for the succession of the crown of Spain and what was equally detestable contriving the division and repartition of the Spanish territories That his Majesty had given orders to represent the injustice of their King to the ministers and lords of England That if such things were allowed no nation no dominion could be safe against the ambition of the strongest and the deceits of the most malicious That should strangers be permitted to put their hands in the lines of succession of Kings no statutes no municipal laws would be observed That no crown could be free from the attempts of aliens and the crown of England less than any crown That were men to lie watching for the  indispositions of sovereigns no health could be constant no life secure  Memorial August    An insolent memorial by the Spanish ambassador  The Marquis descended from general observations to particular facts He informed the lords of the regency that it ought not to have been presumed that the King of Spain had not taken proper measures against all accidents that might disturb the public peace and break the repose of Europe That unless a stop should be put to these sinister proceedings these clandestine machinations these unjust projects an universal war must be the consequence throughout Europe That such a misfortune would be highly prejudicial to the people of England who had lately tried and felt the inconvenience of novelties and the insupportable burden of the consequent war That this latter circumstance was so obvious that the memorialist doubted not but it must be owned by the parliament the nobility and all the English nation That the same nation must consider their own interest their trade and their treaties with Spain the danger arising to these from a division and separation of the Spanish monarchy and that nothing can prevent these misfortunes but their disappointing the project already begun at Loo and their determining not to help forward novelties ever supremely hurtful to all sovereignties and empires He concluded with assuring the regency that the King his master would render manifest to the parliament of England when that assembly should meet the just resentment which he now expressed to their lordships  He is ordered to depart the kingdom  This insolent memorial was transmitted to William before any answer was made by the regency The King was not of a complexion either to admit of appeals from the prerogatives of the Crown to the representatives of the nation or to suffer any reflections against his own right to the throne He ordered Mr secretary Vernon to signify to the Spanish ambassador that he must depart the kingdom precisely in eighteen days That in the mean time he should confine himself to his house and that no writing should be any more  received either from himself or any of his domestics The King at the same time ordered his ambassador at the court of Madrid to complain of the affront offered to his person and the reflections thrown on his government He endeavoured to exempt the King of Spain from having any share in the outrage committed by his ambassador But that Prince made himself a party in the dispute by ordering the English ambassador to depart the kingdom within the same space of time that had been limited by William to the Marquis de Canailles  Affairs of the North  These disputes between William and Spain neither hastened nor retarded the second treaty of partition which that Prince concluded the next year with France His attention was not confined to the subject of the Spanish succession though the declining health of Charles the Second threatened Europe with those miseries which it then feared and soon after experienced from his death The King employed his good offices in suppressing a flame which seemed ready to be kindled in the North Christian the Fifth King of Denmark dying on the fourth of September was succeeded in the throne by his son Frederic the fourth Frederic inheriting the resentment and pursuing the designs of his father against the Duke of HolsteinGottorp began to make great preparations both by sea and land to reduce that Prince to those terms which he pretended to have a right to exact The Duke on the other hand had strengthened his interest by a marriage with the PrincessRoyal of Sweden He himself was commander in chief of the troops of that kingdom and he had obtained a force from his brotherinlaw Charles the Twelfth to defend himself against the designs of Denmark William in his double capacity of King of England and Stadtholder of the United Provinces considered himself as guarantee of the treaty of Altena and to secure the tranquillity of the North he proposed that the Swedish troops should retire from Holstein The King of Sweden and the Duke accepted the proposal of the mediator But the King of Denmark having privately entered into an alliance against Sweden with  the King of Poland and Peter Alexiowitz Czar of Muscowy exacted terms so exorbitant that it was apparent he meant nothing less than to preserve the peace  Hist de Suede tom ii    Affairs of the Scotish company  While William extended his care to the interest of other nations he neglected in a scarce pardonable degree the protection of a part of his own subjects The Scotish company of adventurers though labouring under various difficulties had resolved to send two ships to sea On board of these and a few tenders they embarked some goods for commerce guns and military stores for service some provisions and twelve hundred men A council of seven was appointed to direct the expedition They were bound to the Isthmus of Darien in America to make an establishmen  in a place of which the Spaniards held no part Thi  unadvised plan was conducted with as many errors a  it afterwards incurred of misfortunes One half o  the scanty provisions destined for the voyage wa  consumed before the adventurers weighed anchor  The two ships though miserably provided were al+lowed only one hundred pounds each and each tende  ten pounds to relieve them upon any emergency  They had sailed from the Frith of Edinburgh on th  seventeenth of July and after having encoun+tered many difficulties and suffered much misery ar+rived in America about the middle of October  Defence of  Scots c    The are discouraged by the King  Having treated with the natives for a permission t  settle on the coast of Darien the adventurers lande  on the fourth of November The King either sway+ed by the jealousy of the Dutch or to gratify th  English who had already signified their disapprobat  +on of the company seemed resolved to add to the mi  +fortunes in which the Scots had involved themselve  He sent orders to the governors of the colonies to iss  proclamations forbidding his subjects in America to gi  any assistance to the adventurers upon pain of his d  +pleasure and of suffering the severest punishme  There was a degree of inhumanity and a palpa  injustice in this conduct The King himself had given his assent to an act and signed a royal charter for the establishment of the company The Spaniards had not yet complained of any encroachments on their territories William by evasive answers to the representations of the Scots had in a manner prevented them from providing against a hardship which no subjects acting under the authority of the law had any reason to fear from their sovereign To compleat the misfortune the King listened to the complaints of the Spaniards  May  against an illfated body of adventurers already perishing in their own folly They were now destitute of all things A foreign Prince was preparing to expel them by force and they were deserted by their own  Distress of the adventurers a ferment in the nation  The survivors among the Scotish adventurers being in distress were forced to send a depuration to the English colonies to obtain from the humanity of the inhabitants the supply which the rigid edicts of government had denied They sailed to Jamaica they directed their course from that island to NewYork They found no relief in either place and they prosecuted their voyage to Europe The company and the whole Scotish nation were inflamed at once with resentment and disappointment The first sent an address to the King They followed the address with a petition for a session of parliament Neither of the papers produced the desired effect The King in his answer by his secretary the Earl of Seafield regretted the loss which the kingdom and the company had lately sustained He told them that upon all occasions he would protect and encourage their trade That the subjects of Scotland should always enjoy the same privilege as sormerly to trade with the English plantations But as for the parliament that he had adjourned that assembly to the fifth of March and that they should be assembled when he judged the good of the nation required their meeting This new repulse was const  ed into a fresh injury Despair was  added to rage and resentment and a general ferment seemed to threaten a general revolt  Enquiry into the causes of the miscarriage at Dari    William returns A change in the ministry  The King embarked for England on the thirteenth of October and having landed on the seventeenth at Margate arrived the next day at Kensington The obstructions attending the service of the Crown in the last session of parliament had either prevailed with William to make a change among his servants or induced some of themselves to resign The Earl of Orford retired from the admiralty The Earl of Jersey succeeded the Duke of Shrewsbury a secretary of state The Duke of Leeds was removed from the head of the council and the office of president was conferred on the Earl of Pembroke whose place as lordprivyseal was filled by the Lord Lonsdale A few days  Oct  after the King's return the Duke of Shrewsbury came again into office as lord+chamberlain Montagu the chancellor of the exche+quer foreseeing the difficulty of managing the af+fairs of the Crown in a refractory house of com+mons resigned his place at the board of treasury  These changes in the higher departments neithe  pleased the Whigs nor gratified the Tories A sulle  humour prevailed through the kingdom and thoug  the two parties that divided the nation were implaca+ble with regard to each other they seemed both  agree to oppose jointly the King  Publications of the year    Parliament meets  In this state of things and opinions the parliamen  met on the sixteenth of November The King mad  an elaborate speech to the two houses full of expres+sions of affection for his parliament and care of th  public good  No    He however seemed to hav  still retained a sense of his dissatissaction with the pro+ceedings of the commons in the last session Th  commons on the other hand brought back to the  house the illhumour in which they were prorogue  In the place of an address of compliments and thank  as had been usual on such occasions they presented  the King but after a long interval  Dec  a remonstrance They beseeched William from the necessity of a mutual confidence between himself and his parliament to shew marks of his highest displeasure to such persons as should presume to misrepresent their proceedings They promised in return to discourage all false rumours and reports reflecting on his Majesty's person and government as tending to create misunderstandings between the King and his subjects William chose to soften the rage of his commons rather than to gratify his own resentment He seemed as if he understood not the illhumour of the address and his answer though guarded was full of an appearance of kindness  Dec    Inquiry into Irish for feitures  William however was too late in his scheme of conciliating the affections of the commons with soothing words He was illserved in the house by those members who formed a part of his ministry Montagu was not succeeded in the chancellorship of the exchequer by a man of equal parts Mr secretary Vernon if a member of abilities was not sufficiently trusted by the King to acquire any considerable weight in parliament The illhumour the industry and the eloquence were all on the opposing side All the debates and most of the resolutions of the commons were violent and hostile They had appointed  n the last session of parliament seven commissioners  o inquire into the state and grants of the forfeited  states in Ireland The lower house had repeatedly  assed bills for applying those estates to the public ser  ce But the bills had been defeated in the house of  rds by the influence of the Crown and the interest  such as had obtained grants from the king The  position founded sanguine hopes of distressing the  ourt on a subject so popular They called therefore  a report of the inquiry which was accordingly laid  fore them by Mr Annesley one of the commissi  ers  Journals    Report of the commissioners  In this singular report it appeared that three thou  d nine hundred and twentyone persons had been  outlawed since the thirteenth of February That all the lands belonging to forfeited persons amounted to more than one million and sixty thousand acres That the annual rent of these lands amounted to two hundred and eleven thousand six hundred and twentythree pounds which by computing six years purchase for a life and thirteen for inheritance amounted to the full value of two millions six hundred and eightyfive thousand one hundred and thirty pounds That some of the lands had been restored to the old proprietors by the articles of Limerick and Galloway and others by a corrupt reversal of outlawries and by royal pardons obtained by the favourites of the King That sixtyfive grants and custodiams had passed the great seal of Ireland That the most considerable of these grants were made to persons born in foreign countries to Keppel to Bentinck to Ginckle and to Rouvigny who had been all dignified with peerages in one or other of the two kingdoms That besides a grant had passed the great seal to Elizabeth Villiers now Countess of Orkney a woman peculiarly favoured by William of all the private estates of the late King James containing ninetyfive thousand acres worth twentyfive thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive pounds a year and that upon the whole the value of Irish forfeitures amounted to three millions three hundred and nineteen thousand nine hundred and fortythree pounds  Journals    Violence of the commons  The commons having examined this report resolved unanimously on the fifteenth of December  Dec  that a bill should be brought in to apply all forfei+tures in Ireland from the thirteenth of February  to the use of the public A clause was also ordered  be inserted in the bill fo  erecting a judicature  determining claims touching the said forfeitures But  at the same time the house came to a resolution  to receive petitions from any person whatsoever Th  uncandid mode of proceeding in the majority offen  +ed the dispassionate while it alarmed the court an  digusted the King While yet the bill remained i  committee another incident added uneasiness to resentment in the breast of William On the fifteenth of January Mr Montagu in a fit of indiscreet zeal informed the commons that a member of the house in a letter to the commissioners had directed them to make a separate article of the Countess of Orkney's grant because that circumstance would reflect on a CERTAIN PERSON Montagu explained this certain person into the King The house ordered him to make good his charge He endeavoured in vain to avoid an answer But being threatened with the Tower he named Methuen lordchancellor of Ireland as the informer Methuen denied the charge Montagu became the victim of his own zeal and the commons voted that his report was false and scandalous They resolved at the same time that the four commissioners who had signed the report concerning the Irish forfeitures had acquitted themselves with understanding courage and integrity They at the same time committed Sir Richard Leving to the Tower as a person who had thrown a groundless and scandalous aspersion on the four commissioners  Journals Jan    They tack the bill of resumption to the supply  Though the courtparty were almost in every question the minority they endeavoured to defeat in part the bill of resumption by proposing a clause for reserving a proportion of the forfeitures to the disposal of the King The house not content with putting a negative on this motion resolved that the advising procuring and passing the grants for the forfeited estates and others in Ireland had been the occasion of contracting great debts upon the nation and laying heavy taxes on the people and that the passing of these grants highly reflected on the King's honour  Jan  While the commons exhibited this spirit of refractoriness the affair of the supply for the current service commanded a part of their care The and forces were continued on the same sooting as in the preceding year But the seamen were reduced to seven thousand men The ways and means were chiefly a landtax of two shillings in the pound with  a borrowing clause of near a million with the surplus of the old subsidy ending on the twentyfifth of December together with that of the funds for the civil list which were to terminate at the end of the present year In a narrow inspection of every branch of the revenue a great loss to the public was discovered in the collection of the excise A clause was inserted in the bill of supply to enable his Majesty to farm that branch of the revenue and it was at the same time provided that no excise or customhouse officer should be capable for the future to sit in the house of commons  Journals    Their resolutions hostile  To secure the assent of the King to the resumption of the Irish forfeitures the bill was called a bill of supply and tacked to that for the grants of the year The money to be raised by the sale of the lands was appropriated to the discharge of the transportdebts the arrears of officers the sums due for cloathing the interest upon tallies orders tickets and exchequerbills During the debates on these subjects the commons in a grand committee considered the state of the nation  Feb  In a question which tended to an animadversion upon the King's servants the courtparty prevailed But the house resolved on the fifteenth of February to represent to his Majesty in a  address their resolutions relating to grants of th  forfeited estates in Ireland William's answer expres+sed some part of the resentment which he entertaine  against the harsh proceedings of the commons H  told them that he was not only led by inclination b  even by justice to shew favour to such as had serve  him well That their service in Ireland was wit  peculiar propriety rewarded out of the estates forfei  +ed by the rebellion in that kingdom and that the le  +sening of the national debt by just and effectu  means would in his opinion best contribute to t  honour safety and interest of the kingdom  Feb  T  commons were so much ossended with this reply t  they resolved that whoever had advised the answ  to their address had used his utmost endeavour  create a misunderstanding and jealousy between the King and his people  Feb    and proceedings displeasing to the King  This session of parliament was throughout hostile to the King The grand committee for trade had examined into several piracies comitted in the East Indies by one Captain Kidd and his crew On this examination it appeared that William had inadvertently made himself a kind of party in the affair by signing a warrant for the granting of piratesgoods to the Earl of Bellamount and several others The commons sent an address to the throne that Kidd who was ordered home from America should not be tried discharged or pardoned until the next session of parliament This conduct in the house shewed a distrust of the King which raised his resentment as it hurt his pride An enquiry into the state of the commissions of the peace and lieutenancy produced an address  April  that was not grateful to the King The house represented that to restore gentlemen of quality and estates to these commissions would much conduce to the good of the kingdom and they desired that neither men of small estates nor dissenting from the church of England should either be continued or appointed  Journals  These proceedings were more disgustful to the King in their manner than in themselves repugnant to his authority or hurtful to his character  They carry their point against him  Though a majority of the lords seemed to be in opposition to the measures of William the peers treated him with more complaisance than the commons The complicated bill comprehending the resumption and supply met with great opposition in the upper house Some had been gained by the servants of the crown Many disapproved of the precedent of tacking a foreign clause to a moneybill as reducing the peers to a subserviency to the factions and views of the commons But the force of both parties when joined was not sufficient to reject the bill Amendments were however made with regard to the Irish forfeitures But these amendments were  unanimously disapproved by the lower house Conference succeeded conference The commons were in a ferment They spoke of impeaching the Earls of Portland and Albemarle They shut themselves up after the second conference with the lords till ten at night and seemed determined on the harshest means to force the courtparty into compliance In this important interval the house resolved to address the King that no person not a native of his dominions except Prince George of Denmark should be admitted to his councils either in England or Ireland  April  William was not of a complexion to give a favourable answer nor was he in a condition to refuse the demands of the exasperated commons He sent a private message to his friends among the lords to suspend their opposition The bill was immediately passed without amendments and to prevent the falling of the threatened storm he came suddenly to the house gave his assent to the act of resumption and prorogued the parliament  April  without any speech from the throne  Affairs of the Scotish company  While William was harassed in one of his kingdoms by a violent and successful opposition in parliament he was perlexed in another by vehement instances for redress On the fourth of December the councilgeneral of the Scotish company informed the secretary of their nation in England that they has prevailed upon the Lord Basil Hamilton to make a journey to London to address the King in behalf of more than thirty persons wrongfully detained prisoners at Carthagena by the Spaniards William seldom capable of concealing his resentment exhibited it upon the present occasion in a manner unsuitable to his dignity He ordered the chancellor of Scotland to acquaint the councilgeneral that he had refused acce  to Lord Basil Hamilton as he had not waited upo  him when he was formerly in London and that h  had never since given any public evidence of his loy+alty  Chancello  Letter to the Directors  He however promised to demand in t  terms of treaties the release of the prisoners at Carthagena That it was his firm intention to advance the trade of Scotland and that the subjects of that kingdom should enjoy the same liberty of commerce that others enjoyed in the English plantations The company however were resolved not to relinquish their purpose They wrote to the chancellor They sent a letter to Lord Basil Hamilton They requested the first to use his best endeavours for obtaining admittance for the noble person whom they had employed They approved of the conduct of the latter and ascribed their disappointment to a dislike to their own cause more than to any objection entertained by the King against his person  Letter to the Chancellor    Opposed by the King  Embarrassed with complaints and teazed by entreaties William endeavoured to get rid of the Scots with the sanction of the English parliament The commons being so refractory the first application was made to the lords Neither the influence of the crown nor the prejudices of the house against the new company were capable of carrying the point against the Scots without violent debates and long delays An address was at length sent down to the commons for their concurrence But the commons were not in the humour of being complaisant to the King The enemies of William were pleased to see his affairs embroiled Some apprehended that there was a design to involve the two kingdoms in a quarrel that the King might derive from the necessity of the nation that increase of the land forces which had been so often denied to his earnest solicitations to parliament The leaders of opposition were by no means inclined to remove the general discontent which had soured the temper of the Scots against the King The disaffected members in the mean time propagated a report that the opposition of the King to the Scotish company proceeded neither from a regard to foreign treaties nor domestic advantage but from an affection for the Dutch whose trade along the Spanish main was in danger of being ruined  by the establishment of a new colony at Darien  Burnet vol iii  The commons upon the whole refused their concurrence to the address and soon after they rejected a bill sent down from the lords for appointing commissioners to treat with the Scots concerning an union of the two kingdoms  Journals    A petition in the name of the whole Scotish nation  The ferment continuing to rage in Scotland the Marquis of Tweedale presented a petition to William in the name of the whole nation  Mar    They recounted the hardships of the company both at home and abroad their own feelings upon a subject so melancholy and the promises of the King to favour protect and support the general trade of the kingdom They requested him to order the parliament to sit as nothing could more conduce to the support of the credit and interest of a company in whose misfortunes and prosperity the whole nation were concerned than the meeting of the representatives of the people They reminded him of his promise of permitting that assembly to sit whenever the good of the nation required that measure and they assured him that the good of the nation could at no time require their meeting more than on the present occasion This irregular petition produced nothing but an additional disappointment The King made answer that the parliament should not meet till the fourteenth of May But that then it should meet for the dispatch of business The discontents of the Scots were inflamed into a species of madness upon this fresh instance of the King's disregard to their complaint  A general revolt might have been apprehended ha  the power of the kingdom borne any proportion to th  resentment of the people  The King disgusted  Though the King had extricated himself from pre+sent trouble by the sudden prorogation of the Englis  parliament he was still far from having freed himse  from the storm which had shaken in some degre  his throne His own conduct during the session w  more apt to inflame than to soothe the minds of th  by whom he was most opposed He made no secret of his displeasure at the proceedings of the commons He was at no pains to conceal his resolution to defeat the bill of resumption by refusing his assent should it pass the house of lords He became sullen melancholy and discontented His resentment broke forth frequently in a manner inconsistent with his prudence He either apprehended not the dangers in which the votes of the commons might terminate or he was not much concerned where they might end  Burnet vol iii  He even seemed indifferent about possessing the name of King after the authority which he deemed to be inherent in that capacity had vanished from his hands and had not the safety of those whom he favoured most depended on his compliance he would not probably have suppressed the rage against the commons which his enemies hoped he was to have carried to extremity They perceived that should he quarrel with the commons he would lose what still remained of the affections of his people His going constantly beyond sea after every session of parliament furnished his opponents with an opportunity of impressing the minds of the nation with an opinion that he even hated the company and society of his English subjects  Ibid    A change in the ministry  The recess of parliament as it freed William from daily mortifications encouraged him to endeavour to prevent the return of the disagreeable measures which had so much disturbed his repose He found that in the course of the session the commons had expressed great animosity against his ministers particularly against the lord chancellor Somers who was the most  ble of his servants and considered as the head of the Whigs Somers had gained a considerable degree of  he King's confidence by his ability in business and  he modesty of his manner in tendering his advice William however resolved to dismiss him from his  ervice from the hopes which he had entertained  at a man disliked by the commons would carry in  this retreat all the unpopularity that had of late at  nded the measures of the crown When Somers  who laboured under an illness during the winter had recovered health sufficient to appear at court he was told by the King that it was necessary for the pubblic service he should resign the seals Somers excused himself from making the delivery of the seals his own act as that circumstance might be construed by his enemies into either guilt or fear The Earl of Jersey was sent with a warrant to demand the seals in form and they were accordingly returned to the King  Character of the Lord Sommers  Somers though meanly descended  Swift's MS notes on Macky  rendered himself respectable by talents which he knew well to improve to his own advantage He was a man of abilities in his profession but his parts were more solid than brilliant or even clear He was rather a good chancellor than a great statesman His integrity and diligence in office were with reason commended He was too diffident and too compliant with the King to make any splendid figure beyond his own line of the law His complaisance to the King's humour his flattering him in his very errors his feeble manner of recommending what seemed right to his own judgment bore more the appearance of a convenient than of an able servant Upon the whole he seemed more calculated to smoothe the current of business by amending and softening measures already adopted than to propose and execute those spirited and manly expedients which times of faction seem to demand at the hands of a great minister The difficulty which William encountered in supplying properly the place  May  of Somers argued that his dismission of that lord was a precipitate measure while at the same time he was justly censured for throwing a kind of disgrace on a servant who had served him with fidelity in perilous times But the King had concluded from the late opposition to all his measures that the Tories only were capable of carrying forward with facility the public business  Second treaty  partition  During the violent heats in parliament William turned a part of his attention to the affairs of Europe  The negociations for the second partition of the dominions of Spain proceeded But a desire of persuading the Emperor to enter into the same engagements long prevented the King and the States of Holland from signing the treaty though the articles had been settled In the month of October the Emperor after various evasions formally rejected every treaty of partition whatsoever yet neither the King of England nor the States shewed any eagerness to close with France upon the disposition already agreed with regard to the Spanish succession In the beginning of January in the present year the King of Spain declined so manifestly that his death was daily expected This circumstance hastened the conclusion of the treaty which was signed at London by the Earls of Portland and Jersey and the Comte de Tallard on the twentyfirst of February and at the Hague on the fourteenth of March by Briord the French ambassador and by the plenipotentiaries of the States  De Torcy vol i    concluded between William and France  The second partition of the Spanish dominions differed materially from the disposition made by the former treaty The Archduke Charles was placed in the room of the electoral Prince of Bavaria as heir of the kingdoms of Spain and the Indies Naples Sicily the Marquisate of Final the islands on the Italian shore and the province of Guipuscoa were to fall to the share of the Dauphin together with the Duchies of Lorrain and Bar which their native Prince was appointed to exchange for the dutchy of Milan In this summary disposal of territories and Kingdoms the King of England was not forgetful of his friend the Prince Vaudemont to whom the country of Binche was to remain a sovereignty To present the union of Spain and the Imperial crown in the person of one Prince provision was made that in case of the Archduke's demise the King of the Romans should not succeed to the throne and in like manner it was particularly stipulated that no King of France or Dauphin should ever wear the crown of Spain A secret article provided for the contingency  of the Emperor's refusing to accede to the treaty and against any difficulties which might arise from the duke of Lorrain with regard to the projected exchange of his native territories for the duchy of Milan  De Torcy vol i    Treaty with Sweden  While William seemed to provide for the repose of the south of Europe he extended his care to the tranquillity of the north The young King of Sweden apprehensive of a storm which already began to break on his dominions entered into a new defensive treaty with the maritime powers The contracting parties became reciprocally guarantees of all their dominions Charles the Twelfth engaged to furnish the King of England with ten thousand men to be paid by the latter Prince should he find himself obliged to take arms in support of the treaty of Riswick England and the States as guarantees of the treaty of Altena between the King of Denmark and the Duke of HolsteinGostorp seem to have agreed though not in an express article to aid Charles with a strong squadron of ships of war when attacked by his enemies The treaty was signed on the thirteenth of January and the requisition or rather the application for the ships was made in March  Hist du Nord tom ii  William in a bad humour with his refractory parliament gave orders for preparing a squadron without either communicating to them his intentions or demanding a supply The first would be imprudent in the untoward humour of of the times as England was little concerned in the affairs of the North and the latter would most certainly be refused considering the general resolution formed by the commons for diminishing the expences of the nation  Copenhagen bombarded  But before William took any avowed part in the affairs of the North he went to Holland and his favourite retreat at Loo Having appointed a regency  June  for the administration of government in his absence he left Hamptoncourt on the fourth of July and on the sixth arrived at the Hague The assiance  formed against Sweden began to shew itself in the motions of the confederate powers The Russians Poles and Saxons entered Livonia and Ingria The Danes led by the Duke of Wertemberg invaded Holstein and having seized some inconsiderable forts sat down before Tonningen The strength of the place the conduct of the governor the unskilfulness of the besiegers an unsuccessful assault and the march of the troops of BrunswickLunenburgh who had passed the Elb induced the Danes to relinquish their designs on Tonningen and to retreat towards their own frontiers A combined squadron of English and Dutch men of war with fireships and bombvessels under the admirals Rooke and Allemonde arrived on the twentieth of July at the mouth of the Sound  July  The fleet of Sweden commanded by the king in person having joined the allies the Danish ships retired under the guns of Copenhagen The King of Denmark was himself cooped up in Holstein by some Swedish frigates cruising along the coast while his capital was bombarded though ineffectually by the combined fleets of the allies  July    Denmark forced into a peace  His active spirit suggested to the young King of Sweden the means of putting an end with one decisive stroke to the war He resolved to besiege Copenhagen by land while the fleet blocked up that capital by sea He fixed the place of his descent at Humblebeck opposite to Landscroon He landed in person the first of all the Swedes He drove to flight  he enemy who had attempted to defend the shore A deputation of the clergy and principal inhabitants  y a contribution of four hundred thousand rixdollars  revailed with Charles to spare the city The King  f Denmark was in the mean time reduced to a situ  tion the most critical The troops of the house of BrunswickLunenburgh pressed him on the side of Holstein His fleet was besieged in the harbour of Copenhagen The enemy was in the heart of his do  inions He could derive no hopes but from submissi  n and negociation The Count de Chamilli ambassador  of France offered his own mediation in th  name of his master The powers who had guaran+teed the treaty of Altena joined their good offices t  those of Chamilli for restoring peace and on th  eighteenth of August a treaty was concluded at Tr  +vendal between Denmark Sweden and Holstein t  the exclusion of Russia and Poland The term  were honourable for the Duke of Holstein but h  +miliating to Denmark The first was restablished i  all his claims whilst the latter was forced to pay t  the Duke two hundred and sixty thousand crowns t  indemnisy him for the expence of the war  Hist du Nord tom i    Affairs of Scotland  The sudden restoration of the tranquillity of th  North may be ascribed in a great degree to the de+cisive measures of the King of England But whe  he was securing the peace of foreign nations tumults  discontents and clamours prevailed in a part of h  own dominions On the twentyfirst of May th  parliament of Scotland had met at Edinburgh and th  King's letter containing the usual excuse for no  opening the session in person being read the Duk  of Queensberry as lordhigh commissioner perceiv+ing the bad humour of parliament adjourned th  house for three days When they met on the twen+tyfourth petitions addresses and representations  particular as well as general grievances were pour  in upon them from every side The councilgene  of the Indian and African company as they had s  +fered most were the loudest in their complaints  motion was made that the colony of Caledonia  Darien was a legal and rightful settlement and th  the parliament would maintain and support the sam  The commissioner perceiving that this embarrassi  vote was on the point of being carried suddenly a  +journed the house for three days This circumsta  added fuel to the flame When the house met th  resumed their motion and the commissioner ag  adjourned them for twenty days  May  Parliament address against an adjournment  The conduct of the commissioner was consider  by a great majority as an arbitrary breach upon  freedom of voting in parliament They met that very evening and signed a spirited address to the King They complained of their being interrupted in their debates by an adjournment contrary to an express act of parliament wherein it was provided that nothing should be done or commanded that might either directly or indirectly prevent the liberty of free voting and reasoning of the estates of Parliament They affirmed that the second adjournment was a manifest infringement on the claim of rights which had accompained the very act that had placed the King on the throne They concluded with intreating his Majesty to permit his parliament to meet on the day to which it was then adjourned and to sit as long as might be necessary for redressing the grievances of the nation A deputation was sent with this address to the King He declared  June  that he could give no answer at the time to their petition but that they should know his intentions in Scotland The parliament was in the mean time further adjourned by proclamation  A general ferment  Though the Earl of Seafield and other servants of the Crown had been for a whole year employed in gaining with promises and pensions the members of the Scotish parliament the clamours of the people made more proselytes than the bribes employed by  he King The current ran rapidly in one way whilst the disaffected added their own force to the vio  ence of the stream The general cry was that the  reedom of debate was most effectually ruined the  laim of right invaded and a private power usurped  ver the parliament The King they justly observ  d assumed more than a negative by these unconstitu  onal adjournments A bill is defeated by the first  y the latter the right of giving advice one of the  reat ends of all parliaments is utterly prevented and  verturned In this disposition of the people in gene  l the lower sort became outrageous Upon some  ague intelligence received at Edinburgh of an ad  antage gained by their countrymen at Darien over  e Spaniards the populace committed every species  of excess and insult against the officers of the government The King was not unjustly deemed a party against the African company and his name was treated with indecency and his authority with contempt A national address was in the mean time encouraged on every side and transmitted to every borough and county for signatures and names  Violence of the discontented  To add to the general ferment advices arrived from Spain that several of the adventures in Darien had been sent to that country and condemned as pyrates That the chief proofs brought against them were the proclamations of the governors of the English colonies by the express commands of the King containing a formal disavowal of the legality of the settlement together with words disclaiming the undertaking of the Scots expressed by William himself to the Spanish ambassador and transmitted in writing by that minister to the council of the Indies In the midst of the clamours raised upon this fresh intelligence William endeavoured in vain to soothe the Scots into some temper by a letter to the Duke of Queensberry The national flame continued to increase The discontented members talked of sitting by force and of forming themselves into a convention They even affirmed that the army was ready to join their cause against a government which by denying protection had no right to obedience That they wanted nothing but money to declare the throne vacant to restore the late King or to confer the crown on some other Prince more inclined than the present to support the just claims of the nation  Manchester's Correspondence Cole's coll    Inactivity of the late King  These discontents so favourable to his views were not capable of rouzing the late King from the lethargy into which he had fallen ever since the treaty of Riswick Rendered careless by misfortunes weighed down with years and unmanned by his own religious enthusiasm he had resigned every expectation of regaining his crowns To the resolution of transporting himself into England he seems to have still adhered had William as was generally apprehended yielded  to the disorders that had long threatened his dissolution But though he had resigned all hopes with regard to himself James never doubted but his son would one day recover the crowns which he himself had lost He thought that the objections to himself proceeded either from the views of a few leading men or the terrors of the populace who were animated with an enthusiasm similar to his own He deemed the lineal succession so essential and even necessary to monarchy that things must in course fall back to their old channel when the terrors of his own return and the pressure of William's ambition were both removed from the nation  Contin of

of the crown seemed to favour the expectations of the late King The Duke of Gloucester as he was commonly called though his patent was never made out from a superstitious prejudice against that title had arrived at the eleventh year of his age On his birthday the twentyfourth of July he fell ill of a malignant fever His constitution which was tender and feeble soon sunk under the violence of his disorder and he expired at Windsor on the night of the twentyninth of the month Though as is usual with regard to princes who die in youth much has been said of his parts and acquirements he was little lamented by the nation and less by the King The people were discontented with the government and rendered  areless of its concerns through the different views  f the parties into which they were divided and William who had never any affection for the mo  her was not perhaps much displeased to see her  nfluence weakened by the death of the son A pre  ailing report that the Princess had sent very clan  estinely an express to notify the demise of her son  her father might contribute to lessen the concern  of William for the loss which the kingdom had sustained  Lamberty tom i    Death of the K of Spain  The King having passed three months in Holland  returned on the nineteenth of October to England  Unwilling to meet a parliament that had opposed hi  in all his views he prorogued that assembly to th  twentyfirst of November and after a further pro+rogation dissolved them before the end of the year  The face of affairs in Europe had suffered in th  mean time a very important change Charles th  Second King of Spain having so long struggled wit  distempers yielded at length to their force and died  on the first of November The resentment which h  had conceived against the authors of the second treaty of partition seemed to have hastened the death of tha  feeble Prince while at the same time it produce  the most decisive measure in all his reign Having re+solved to prevent the projected partition of his domi+nions the only difficulty lay in the appointment of a  universal heir His inclination pointed to the famil  of Austria But the Pope whom he consulted by let+ter and afterwards the clergy of Spain at the inst  +gation of the Cardinal Portocarrero induced that s  +perstitious Prince to nominate the Duke of Anjou th  second son of the Dauphin his successor in all his do+minions  De Torcy tom i    His will in favour of the Duke of Anjou  In the will which was dated on the second of Octo+ber the King acknowledged the right of his sister th  Infanta Maria Theresa Queen of France and m  +ther of the Dauphin He also acknowledged th  right of his aunt Anne of Austria the mother of th  French King and consequently the right of the Da  +phin as the only heir by the laws of the kingdom  To prevent an alarm in Europe at the union of su  extensive dominions to France the Dauphin's seco  son was called to the throne of Spain Until t  Prince should arrive at Madrid and even till he  of age a council of regency with th  Queen at the head were nominated for the administration of affa  Upon the demise of Charles the regency wrote to  French King and at the same time ordered the will to be delivered to that Prince by the Spanish ambassador residing at his court Lewis consulted his council in which it was resolved to drop the second partition treaty and to adhere to the testament of the late King of Spain A war it had been always foreseen was the inevitable consequence of the death of that Prince and the court of France wisely concluded that it was much easier to keep possession of the whole kingdom by virtue of the will than to conquer and retain the share allotted to the Dauphin by the treaty concluded with England and the States  De Torcy tom i    Lewis XIV accepts the will  Lewis the Fourteenth joined to these reasons one other of equal weight Should he refuse the bequest made to his grandson of the crown all the dominions of Spain must have fallen into the hands of the Emperor the hereditary rival of the power of his family The very courier that brought the will to France had been ordered in case of the refusal of that court to proceed to Vienna with a tender of the throne to the Archduke This circumstance would have again revived the power possessed by the house of Austria in the days of Charles the Fifth when the united weight of Spain and the empire had almost proved fatal to the French monarchy These reasons coinciding with the ambition of Lewis he flattered himself that the war which must otherwise have been kindled in Europe was least to be dreaded on the grounds which he now had chosen The resolution adopted for accepting the will in France was followed by the precaution of form  ng alliances abroad Lewis entered into a treaty with  e King of Portugal with the Dukes of Savoy and Mantua The latter of these Princes received a  rench garrison into his capital The allies of France  the side of Germany were the Duke of Brunswick Wolfembuttle the Duke of SaxeGotha and the  ishop of Munster The Elector of Bavaria then  vernor of the Netherlands and his brother the  ector of Cologn were uncles to the new King  Spain and resolved to maintain his right to the  own  Ibid    Resentment of the Emperor  The King of England and the States of the United Provinces affected to be highly offended at the breach made by Lewis the Fourteenth on the second treaty of partition But they were in no condition to support at present their resentment with any decisive measure They observed therefore a cautious silence while the Emperor possessed of less power of revenge than either made a great deal of noise  Stanhope to Manchester Dec  Perplexed and rendered undecisive by his disappointments Leopold was for some time uncertain what measures he should adopt to possess himself of an object of which he had been unexpectedly deprived He at length fixed on the Milanese which he claimed as a fief of the empire On the twentysecond of November he issued his mandate to the inhabitants of that duchy which they were to obey on pain of being considered as rebels This resolution was more calculated to raise the ridicule than the terror of the house of Bourbon on that side He was in want of every resource of war Without money at home without alliances abroad and as irresolute in his conduct as he was destitute of power and full of pride  Stan  to Manchester Manchester to Vernon Dec    William disposed to preserve a good understanding with Spain  But though the French King had nothing immedi+ately to fear from the resentment of the Emperor hi  own precautions against a war hastened its approach  During these transactions one Schonenburgh a Fle+mish Jew resided at Madrid in the double capacity of agent for England and the States of Holland Th  chief view of William being to preserve the barrie  in Flanders in the hands of the Dutch and to preve  the Netherlands from being annexed to the crown  France he ordered Schonenburgh to signify to th  regency his earnest desire of living on the footing  their former amity with the court of Spain and  insinuate at the same time his expectations that t  barrier in Flanders should be preserved in its prese  form The regency or as they were called  Junto had abandoned the fate of Spain to the arbit  +tion of France They knew the weakness of the S  +nish  dominions in all quarters and the utter inability of the kingdom to defend itself on any side They therefore requested the French King to accept in a manner of the generalship of their monarchy They commanded the viceroys of the provinces to obey his orders and under the pretence that the States were making preparations for war they impowered the court of France to take possession of the barrier in Flanders with French troops  Jan  Though William might have been jealous of proceedings contrary to the principles which he had long avowed he was induced for various reasons not only to acquiesce at present in the forward measures of France but afterwards even to acknowledge the Duke of Anjou as lawful sovereign of Spain  April    State of affaires at home  The untoward situation of the King's affairs at home had greatly contributed to his present want of decision abroad The refractoriness of the last session of parliament their supposed insults to his person and actual opposition to the crown had convinced William that either he must change his servants or his measures The first suited best his temper He had removed the chancellor before his departure for Holland The death of Lord Lonsdale in the month of July had made a vacancy in the office of privyseal The department in the secretary's office had been long vacant The King took advantage of these circumstances to gratify the Tories who he deemed could serve best the measures of the crown without offending by displacing the Whigs The Earl of Tankerville removed into the office of privyseal gave room at the head at the treasury to the Lord Godolphin  Dec co  Sir Charles Hedges was taken from the board of admirality and  ade secretary of state  Nov  The Earl of Rochester  onsidered as a leader of the Tories and highchurch  rty was nominated in council lordlieutenant of  Ireland Montagu who had suffered a degree of  nominy in the house of commons through his own  indiscretion was removed by the title of Lord Halifax into the house of lords  Dec  The King manifestly trimmed between the two parties He hoped to divide the Whigs by retaining some of them in office He expected to soften the opposition of the Tories by admitting a few of their leaders into the vacant departments of the ministry  The Scotish parliament reconciled  While the King was making preparations for meeting the new representatives of England on good terms his ministers in Scotland were employed in reconciling the parliament of that kingdom to the views of the crown The national address for the meeting of parliament which had been promoted with such eagerness by the discontented was defeated by the King's ordering that assembly to meet before the address was presented On the twentyeighth of October the parliament met accordingly and the King's letter was in every respect well calculated to allay the ferment which had so long prevailed in the nation It was conceived in the most soft and insinuating terms  The King promised his resolution to give his assen  to all acts for the better establishing the governmen  of the church the security of personal liberty an  more especially for repairing the losses and promoti  the interest of the African and Indian companies H  laid the want of protection which they had experi+enced before on the necessity imposed upon himsel  by the state of Europe But as that state was no  changed he was determined to support to the utmos  their rights and their claims Though this conde+scending expedient had at first no visible effect  the indignant humour of the Scots yet by the con+currence of secret practices on the members it con+tributed to sooth at last the parliament into a per  compliance with the views of the crown The  +ger the session continued the more ground was gain  by the ministry till at length in the month of J  +nuary the storm which threatened the repose of B  +tain was entirely laid  A new parliament in England  On the sixth of February the new parliament met at Westminster but under the pretence of giving time to the members to arrive in town they were adjourned to the tenth of the same month The commons having presented Mr Harley whom they had chosen for their speaker the King made a speech to both houses from the throne He told them that the great misfortune of the nation in the death of the Duke of Gloucester had rendered it absolutely necessary to make a further provision for the succession in the Protestant line He earnestly recommended that measure to their earliest care as the happiness of the nation and the security of religion depended on an immediate and proper settlement of the crown The death of the King of Spain he said and the declaration of his successor had made so great an alteration in foreign affairs that he desired the parliament to consider very maturely their present state and that he doubted not but their resolutions would conduce to the interest and safety of England the preservation of the Protestant religion and the peace of all Europe These things he continued were of such weight that he had called a new parliament to obtain the more immediate sense of the kingdom in such an important conjuncture He recommended to the commons to provide for the late deficiencies and the unfunded debts to inspect the state and augment the strength of the navy and to deliberate on the regulation and improvement of trade  Mutual animosities of the Whigs and Tories  The animosities of parties the prospect of advantage which arose to the members of the lower house from the very misfortunes of their constituents and above all the importance which the commons had lately acquired by their successful opposition to the crown had rendered seats in parliament uncommon objects of contest during the late elections Bribery and corruption perhaps never absent entirely from such occasions had arrived at a pitch too indecent to be overlooked had even those who were rivals for the suffrages of the people been less inflamed against one another's conduct The first care of the commons as is usual in new parliaments was turned to undue  elections But the matter of right was decided by favour more than by its merit every dispute becoming rather a trial of the force of parties than the object of impartial decision The Tories having discovered their superiority by the election of a speaker of their own party are said to have used their power in a manner less suitable to justice than to their own prejudices against the Whigs and to have thus weakened still more their opponents by depriving many of them of their seats in the house But the charge of injustice might probably have been transferred to the other side had their power equalled their animosity against their rivals The passions of all being inflamed by these contests the great business recommended by the King was for some days either entirely forgotten or commanded only the secondary care of the commons  Journals    Steps toward a war  Notwithstanding this seeming inattention to the business of the nation the parliament had not yet discovered any part of that animosity which their predecessors had exhibited against the King On the fourteenth of February they resolved to assure his Majesty that they would support his government and take such effectual measures as might best conduce to the interest and safety of England the preservation of the Protestant religion and the peace of Europe Though the King in secret wished and had probably determined when circumstances should arise to quarrel with France for departing from the second treaty of partition he durst not avow his inclinations for a war upon a foundation universally unpopular He  however took advantage of the general assurance  made by the commons and with his answer to thei  address laid before them a memorial which he re+ceived from the envoyextraordinary of the States o  Holland This memorial fabricated perhaps i  conjunction with William himself contained surmise  of the hostile disposition of France by the motions o  her troops on the side of Flanders together with th  eventual requisition of the succours from England sti+pulated by treaty The King demanded the advice o  his commons on the first part of the memorial and as to the latter he desired their assistance  Feb    All parties eager for it  On the fifteenth of February the commons with a view to the treaty of partition had addressed the King to lay before them all the treaties concluded between his Majesty and any other Prince or state since the late war But when they received the answer to their general address they demanded the treaty between England and the States signed on the third of March together with all the renewals of the treaty since that period The King complied and the house addressed him on the twentieth of February  Feb  to enter into such negociations in concert with the States and other potentates as might conduce to the preservation of the peace of Europe They assured him at the same time of their support and assistance for the performance of the treaty concluded in the year between England and the States of the United Provinces William seized with eagerness the general assurances made in this address He thanked the commons in terms expressive of his approbation of their conduct and he seems though his designs were then unknown to have used great address in reconciling the nation by degrees to a war  Melfort's letter before the houses  To secure the assistance of parliament by exciting their fears from France the King had communicated a few days before an intercepted letter from the Earl of Melfort to his brother the Earl of Perth concerning some wild and exploded projects for replacing James again on the throne Melfort having incurred the dislike of the adherents of the late King on account of his violence and absurdity had been dismissed from the service of that Prince James was now directed in his councils by the Earl of Middleton a man of moderate principles in politics a Protestant in his religion and possessing considerable abilities in business The letter alluding chiefly to past transactions contained no material information Though the lords deemed it worthy of an address to the King the commons  with more dignity passed it over with the contempt it deserved They however resolved upon other considerations to place the navy on a respectable footing They voted unanimously  Feb  that such persons as should advance five hundred thousand pounds for the service of the fleet should receive six per cent interest and be repaid the principle out of the first aid to be granted in the present session They also resolved on the twentysixth of February that thirty thousand men should be employed in the service of the year  Feb    Settlement of the crown  Though the settlement of the crown was a matter of the utmost importance to the nation the lower house were neither early in their attention to that business nor expeditious in bringing it to a conclusion On the third of March the commons resolved that to preserve the peace and happiness of the kingdom and to secure the established religion there was an absolute necessity for making a fresh declaration of the limitation of the crown in the Protestant succession  and that provision should be made for the security o  the rights and liberties of the subject  March  The latte  part of the resolution was suggested by the Tories  who had been uniformly accused by their rivals o  high principles of monarchy They affirmed tha  the nation was in so much haste when they settled th  present government that many securities were over+looked which might have prevented much mischie  They therefore moved that the conditions of go+vernment should be settled before the person should b  nominated lest what really was meant for the good o  the subject should be ascribed to any dislike to th  Prince on whom the election should fall This sa  +tary expedient was construed by the Whigs into a d  +sign of defeating the measure by protracting the bus  +ness But the motion was so popular in itself and  consonant to the principles which they themselv  professed that they could not oppose it though  came from their political enemies  Articles for the security of the subject  In a committee of the whole house the commons came to further important resolutions which were reported and with a few amendments approved on the twelfth of March They resolved that all affairs with regard to government cognizable in the privy council should be transacted there and signed by the members That no person whatsoever not a native of England Scotland or Ireland or dominions belonging to these kingdoms or who was not born of English parents beyond seas though such person is naturalized should be capable of receiving any grant from the Crown or office under the King That in the event of the crown's descending or being transferred to a foreigner the English nation should not be obliged without the consent of parliament to enter into any war for the defence of territories not depending on the crown of England That whosoever should come to the possession of the throne should join in communion with the church of England That no pardon should be pleadable to any impeachment in parliament  March    The Princess Sophia placed in the succeson  To these votes they added others which seemed to reflect on the reigning Prince while they provided securities against his successors in the throne They resolved that no person who should hereafter come to the crown should go out of the dominions of England Scotland or Ireland without the consent of parliament That no person who should possess an office under the King or receive a pension from the Crown should be capable of serving in the house of commons That the commissions of the judges should be rendered permanent and their salaries ascertained and established That the Princess Sophia DuchessDowager of Hanover should be declared the next in succession to the crown of England after the reigning King the Princess of Denmark and the heirs of their respective bodies That the further limitation of the crown should be restricted to the Princess Sophia and the heirs of her body being Protestants and that upon these resolutions a bill should be brought in before the house  Ibid  The bill was accordingly  presented by Mr Conyers on the last day of March and though it met with obstruction from various incidents it passed on the fourteenth of April and was sent up to the lords  Journals April    as the Protestant near est to the crown  The Princess Sophia thus eventually elected to succeed to the throne of England was the nearest person of the royal line who was not already under a legal incapacity of possessing the crown An express act of parliament had excluded all Roman Catholics from the succession and all the descendants of Charles the First except William and the Princess of Denmark were of the Popish persuasion The parliament therefore were obliged to return to the posterity of James the First in another line and to Sophia as granddaughter to that Prince by his daughter Elizabeth who had been married to the unfortunate King of Bohemia Though the same power which conferred on the Princess the succession of the Crown might with equal justice have placed any other person on the throne the parliament chose to adhere in some degree to the royal blood as committing the least outrage on monarchy to which a majority of themselves were attached from principle A different conduct might for a time have deprived the elected Sovereign of the reverence which most men born under monarchies pay to the hereditary line But the influence arising from the disposal of an immense revenue had even then placed the power of the Sovereign on a much more solid foundation than the seeble prerogative derived by hereditary princes from the opinion of the people  Reflections  This consideration had certainly its weight with the present parliament in limiting the force of the executive power in the settlement of the succession As the crown which they conferred was a voluntary gift they had a right if they chose to deprive it of its unnecessary ornaments and even of some of its jewels But power had turned it into another channel and the mounds which were reared became in a manner useless as the waters ceased to rise on that side The  Crown was destined from the very exertions made by the people against its exorbitant claims to acquire in influence what it lost in prerogative Authority by these means lost gradually its terrors and its insolence Power had ceased to be splendid but it became permanent and irresistible and mankind may be imperceptibly surrounded with the toils of despotism while they have the vanity to think themselves free  Proceedings of parliament  The parliament having placed the important business of the succession in a way of being secured began to inquire into domestic mismanagements and the conduct of the Crown with regard to foreign powers They had already provided for the credit of the nation They had placed the navy on a formidable footing by granting large supplies It however had been evident that the King wished least for their assistance in the latter line But the majority seemed by no means willing to gratify their Sovereign in the point of an immediate increase of the landforces of the kingdom In their measures consequent upon the resolution of adhering to the treaty with the Dutch in the commons made a shew of aiding the King without offending the nation They resolved that twelve battalions then in Ireland should be made up with new levies to ten thousand men and sent to the aid of the States But they at the same time resolved that no new levies should be made in Ireland or elsewhere to supply the twelve battalions now to be transported beyond seas  Journals of the commons    Lords address against the partition treaties  The present distrust of the King was followed by animadversions on his former conduct The lords having addressed the throne for the late treaties these together with other important papers were laid before them about the middle of March Having in a committee of the whole house examined the treaties of partition they agreed upon an address containing bitter reflections on their tendency They complained that the last treaty with the French King had been huddled up without being laid before parliament though then actually sitting and even  without being considered in council circumstances as unjust in their nature as the measures themselves were fatal in their consequences They insinuated that the treaty had probably been the cause of the will in favour of the Duke of Anjou That the cession of Sicily Naples several ports in the Mediterranean the province of Guipuscoa and the duchy of Lorrain as stipulated in favour of France by the last treaty was contrary to the pretence of the treaty itself the professed object of which was the peace and safety of Europe They requested his Majesty to require and admit for the future in all matters of importance the advice of his natural born subjects and for that purpose to constitute a council to whom all such foreign and domestic affairs as concerned either his Majesty or his dominions might be referred  Journals of the lords  The King's answer was moderate and prudent It contained a brief evasion conceived in handsome terms He owned that the address contained a matter of very great moment and that he would take care that all treaties he might conclude should be for the honour and safety of England  Ibid    The King's prudent management of the commons  The King having perceived at the beginning of the session that the current of parliament was likely to set powerfully against his measures had resolved to fall down with the stream He had filled the vacant offices with some of the highchurch party He was now determined not to exasperate as he could not soothe the commons They had already in various resolutions rendered manifest their disapprobation of the King's late measures and exhibited a distrust of his future conduct William however exhibited publicly no symptom of displeasure at the conduct o  the majority He had now turned his thought  wholly upon war In several messages to the commons he communicated the negociations abroad i  terms which plainly insinuated that they were at onc  ineffectual and near their end He was supported i  his present views by the leaders of the Whigs at home  and through his own management by the Dut  from abroad The first expected to regain the advantages which they had lost in the confusions of war and the latter were either led by the influence of the King in their councils or swayed by views of their own Memorial regularly followed memorial to William and he as regularly with message after message plied the commons  Journals March    Several lords impeached  A majority however being equally averse with their constituents from a renewal of war the commons resolved without one dissenting voice upon a vote of advice to the King Instead of agreeing with his message  March  that all negociations seemed to be at an end they requested the King to carry on the negociations in concert with the States and they at the same time promised to enable effectually his Majesty to support the treaty concluded in the year with the United Provinces Upon a debate on the treaties of partition they expressed their highest disapprobation of both in resolutions as well as in words They addressed his Majesty to remove the Earl of Portland  April  the Lord Somers  April  and the Lord Halifax from his presence and councils for ever having ordered them to be impeached at the bar of the house of lords These violent measures as they were called by the Whigparty produced a counteraddress from the lords a majority of whom had been gained by the joint influence of the Court and the persons accused The King to avoid any contest with the commons passed over the address of the peers in silence The first proceeded on articles to maintain the impeachments in which the piracies of captain Kidd under the sanction of the broad seal and his being manned and furnished by his Majesty's ships was not the least extraordinary  Journals    Proceedings of the commons  While the King chose to make no reply to the lords he prudently returned a soothing answer to the commons But though they presented an address of thanks they were not to be entirely gained To support their own resolutions to enable the King to adhere to the  treaty of they voted three shillings in the pound on land But they applied the savings on the civil list to the current service The fifty thousand pounds allotted as a dower to King James's Queen had been hitherto retained by William in his own hands under various pretences and more than twenty thousand pounds had reverted to the crown by the death of the Duke of Gloucester These sums making in all near one hundred thousand pounds were applied after a violent contest with the adherents of the Court toward the payment of the public debts During transactions so unfavourable to the views of the King men who wished to regain his favour and secure his confidence endeavoured to rouze the nation to a desire for war A difference between the two houses had been somented to favour this design But the people had been hitherto unconcerned spectators of the contests which agitated the parties in parliament  Artifice of the court  In all governments that have any tincture of freedom the voice of the nation is generally the standard to which public measures are formed Juntos in office as well as excluded factions adapt their conduct to this great criterion and when the nation are not rouzed to forward the private views of either by means of favourite prejudices they both endeavour to excite the clamours of the populace or to gain them to their respective parties through the channel of their fears  Though the resolutions of the house of commons wer  hitherto calculated to please the nation the exclude  party together with some of those servants who wer  best acquainted with the King's mind infused gradu+ally into the people a wild suspicion of their represen+tatives That assembly who had evidently secure  the liberties of the subject by the limitations in th  act of settlement were censured as attached to a sy  +tem of arbitrary power Those who called a prote  +tant successor to the crown were accused of favouri  the popish line and men who endeavoured to appe  as good husbands of the treasure of the nation we  stigmatized as enemies to the public Though wi  regard to many individuals those charges might ha  been in some measure founded on fact the means used to impress the nation with a bad opinion of the whole were highly unjustifiable  Kentish petition  The first measure taken for rouzing the nation to an ardour for war exhibited itself in the county of Kent The grandjury and other gentlemen and freeholders had assembled at Maidstone on the twentyninth of April and through the management of the adherents of the King presented to the house of commons what was deemed a libel in the form of a petition  May  The house voted the petition to be scandalous  nsolent and seditious tending to destroy the consti  ution of parliament and to subvert the established  overnment The persons who presented the paper  ere delivered over into the custody of a serjeant at  rms and upon a suspicion of an intended rescue  ommitted to the gatehouse Those who had advised  nd promoted the Kentish petition artfully increased the ferment which this decisive measure of the  ommons had raised A libel subscribed Legion was  ansmitted to the speaker containing many articles of  cusation and charging the house with tyranny to  e subject and undutifulness toward the King  The  mmons addressed the throne against the endeavours  at had been made to raise tumults among the peo  e and they requested him to provide effectually by  e exact execution of the laws for the peace and  urity of the kingdom  Journals May    Difference between the houses  While the party thus armed the prejudices of the  pulace against the commons they found means to  re the majority which they had obtained in the  se of peers The articles against the impeached  s were either considered as frivolous in themselves  they were but languidly maintained The two  ses at length fell into an irreconcileable difference  the mode of proceeding The commons insist  that the lords whom they had impeached should  ain from voting in the upperhouse and that a  mittee from each of the houses should meet to  st the time manner and order in the intended  trials The lords refused the first demand as it seemed to include a condemnation before conviction To the second they replied that as the sole right of judicature was in themselves they had also the sole right to appoint the time manner and order of all trials on impeachments These differences filled the end of the month of May and almost the whole of June with altercation contest and noise The peers had appointed days for the trials The commons refused to appear and the impeached lords were acquitted The King in the mean time observed a prudent silence Though he was not displeased at the current which had turned against the commons he avoided to irritate that assembly and he dismissed them by prorogation on the twentyfourth of June in apparent good humour though he perhaps even then had resolved never to meet the same house again  Reflections on the conduct of the commons  Though no house of commons had ever fallen under the displeasure of party writers in a degree equal to the present they certainly deseved to meet with mo  praise than censure That several members had pri+vate views to promote in their opposition to th  crown cannot well be denied But that the cond  of the whole seemed calculated to discharge the du  of the representative of the people to their count  is equally true Their chief demerit in the eyes  those who favoured the views of the King was t  pursuing every measure calculated to prevent the n  +on from being engaged as a principal in a contin  war and the party who abetted the notions of  court had the address to rouze the resentment of  vulgar in their own cause Some of the proceed  of the lower house it must be acknowledged  tinctured with those partialities which too often  grace popular assemblies Whilst they pointed  utmost vengeance against those leaders of the W  that bore a share in the last treaty of partition  passed over some Tories who were equally de  that unadvised transaction But an undeviating a  +tion to justice can scarce ever be expected from  inflamed with the prejudices of party  and on that of the King  The conduct of William during the session was as suitable to prudence as it was to the designs that without acknowledging them he had adopted The Whigs and Tories were inflamed against each other to such a degree of inveteracy and they were also so equally poised that without declaring for either he had a prospect of commanding both parties Some leaders of each side were still in office But he chose to make no advances to the Whigs nor to gratify the Tories The two factions took different ways to obtain the management of government The first departed from their principles in their endeavours to gain the King The latter seemed rather inclined to owe their influence to their sovereign's fear of their power William all the while observed a profound silence and even after the prorogation of parliament when he resolved to pass over into Holland he left the government in such mixed hands that no judgment could be formed to which party he most inclined  William in Holland  On the thirtieth of June the King left Hamptoncourt and on the third of July he arrived in the Maese The battalions from Ireland the levies from England and the regiments from Scotland were in Holland before the King who had raised the Earl of Marlborough to the command of the whole In some measure prepared for war he applied himself to negociations nominally calculated for preserving peace He had in the preceding April acknowledged the new King of Spain by a letter under his own hand The States after heavy complaints had done the same for the sake of their commerce But it had long been no secret that neither were willing to permit the  ouse of Bourbon to enjoy in tranquillity the vast  cession of power they had received in the crown of  pain A mockshew of a treaty in the mean time  mployed the summer The French court though  hey seriously wished for a continuance of peace be  ved in a manner that seemed to hasten the war  espairing of any happy issue to conferences where  ther side would depart from their claims D'Avaux  e ambassador of France at the Hague was recalled  the eighth of August having left a memorial with  the States more apt to inflame their resentment than to remove their fears  War in Italy French defeated at Carpi  Before William passed into Holland the flames of war had been kindled in Italy between the Emperor and the house of Bourbon The Prince de Vaudemont governor of Milan had obeyed the will of Charles the Second and submitted himself to the new King A body of French troops at the requisition of the Prince had entered the Milanese These were soon after followed by a powerful army and the Duke of Savoy whose daughter was now married to the young King of Spain was declared captaingeneral of the whole On the other hand the Imperialists under Prince Eugene entered Italy in the end of May to the number of thirty thousand men The Mareschal de Catinat as the Duke of Savoy was not yet arrived commanded the French in conjunction with the Prince de Vaudemont They took possession of the Mantuan They posted themselves along the Adige Prince Eugene however under the fein  of a design to cross the Po forced the passage of th  Adige entered the entrenchments of the French a  Carpi and obliged the enemy after having suffere  a considerable loss to cover themselves behind th  Mincio  Memoires de Fouquiere p    and again at Chiari  The retreat of the Mareschal de Catinat left Princ  Eugene master of the whole country lying betwee  the Adige and the Adda The Mareschal posted him+self behind the latter river and the Oglio to prevent  if possible the Imperialists from entering the Mila+nese The French in the mean time were joine  by the Duke of Savoy who left Turin on the twenty+fourth of July to place himself at the head of th  army The continual checks received after the arr  +val of the commander in chief raised in the mind  Catinat a suspicion that the misfortunes of the fie  had not altogether proceeded from the great abilities  Prince Eugene He dispatched to court an account of his uneasiness concerning the fidelity of the Du  of Savoy But Lewis the Fourteenth ascribing  Catinat's own impatience the surmises which he had communicated concerning the Duke sent the Mareschal de Villeroi to supersede him in his command Villeroi willing upon his arrival to signalize himself with some action entered into a concert with the Duke to surprise a small post at Chiara occupied by a corps of infantry at the head of the Imperial camp The project was rash and had it even been attended with success altogether useless The Duke of Savoy acquainted Prince Eugene of the design of de Villeroi and the disposition of the intended attack The French being thus betrayed were repulsed with great loss  Sept  The rest of the campaign produced no action of any importance The confederates quitted first the field and retired into winterquarters between the Oglio and the Adda  Negociations of the Emperor  Though the successes of the campaign were far from being decisive they animated the Emperor and gave weight to his negociations He had secured the Elector of Brandenburgh through the channel of his vanity by dignifying him with the name of King The Princes of Germany who at first affected to consider the war in the light of a familydispute for a crown were induced to depart from their proposed neutrality by the recent victories obtained in Italy over the combined forces of France and Spain The maritime powers whose aid was the most important of all were prepared by motives of their own to come into the views of the court of Vienna The King of England  ighly offended with Lewis the Fourteenth for hav  ng made him in a manner the tool of his ambition  the last treaty of partition had resolved on a war The Dutch swayed by the influence of William jea  us of their own commerce with Spain on account  f the advantages already obtained by France and  rrified at the preparations made by the latter king  om on their frontiers discovered an uncommon ea  erness for taking up arms Denmark gained by the  bsidiary treaty was ready to abet the views of the  aritime powers with a considerable body of men  and if Sweden and Poland had taken no part in the intended confederacy it was because they were engaged in a war at home  Hist d'Allemagne tom vii    Sept Triple alliance  The departure of D'Avaux from the Hague in the beginning of August had put an end to even the shew of treating with France for the preservation of the tranquillity of Europe A fair field was now left for the negociations of the Emperor That Prince in proportion as he perceived the inclination of the maritime powers for war rose in his demands with regard to the terms of the projected alliance He was determined at first to be satisfied with nothing less than the whole Spanish monarchy But the King of England and the States being resolute to undertake for no more than the recovery of Flanders as a barrier for Holland and the duchy of Milan for the security of the Emperor the latter Prince thought it prudent to depart from his vast schemes All difficulties being thus removed the treaty which afterwards obtained the name of the grand alliance was signed on the seventh of September The design avowed in the articles was the procuring satisfaction for the Empero  in the Spanish succession and sufficient security fo  the dominions and commerce of the allies It wa  also stipulated that the King of England and th  States might retain for themselves whatever lands an  cities their arms should conquer in both the In+dies  Vid Tret    Exhausted state of France  Though France had foreseen the storm which wa  now ready to burst upon her in all its rage she ha  been as negligent in her preparations as she was dest  +tute of resources Lewis himself having no inclina+tion to enter into a war gave too much credit to th  pacific disposition of other powers He might hav  perceived and he probably was not ignorant that t  jealousy entertained by the rest of Europe on acco  of the late accession of his family to such vast domi  +ons could scarce permit him to enjoy his good fo  +tune in peace But the truth is he was cured of  former ambition The caution of age had come up  him with its inactivity and weakness His people had scarce time to breathe after immense exertions that had drained their coffers exhausted their strength and depressed their spirit The commerce which had been interrupted by the late war had not yet returned to the old channel His own unadvised policy had also contributed to impoverish his kingdom His raising and lessening the value of money had left his people in such a state of uncertainty with regard to their property that they exported their specie into other countries whilst he himself assisted the general waste by remitting great sums into Flanders and Italy to maintain his armies and into Germany to gain the favour of Princes who soon after deserted his cause  Hist de France De Torcy    and Spain  To render his situation still more critical the dominions of his grandson destitute of the means of defence became a burden instead of an aid to France The Spanish monarchy vulnerable on every side presented to the enemy a weakness proportionable to its own magnitude The finances were at a very low ebb The spirit of the people had declined with the resources of the nation They could protect themselves from none though they were destined to be the prey of all Their state was so wretched that in the present year the court of Madrid were scarce able on the requisition of France to equip two men of war and to send two thousand five hundred men into Andalufia for the security of that province  Schonenburg's correspondence  To alleviate these distresses at home the French King endeavour  d to strengthen himself with alliances abroad He  ad attempted to secure the Duke of Savoy with  erms of great advantage to himself and the marriage of his second daughter to the young King of Spain He had also concluded a treaty with the King of Por  ugal on the eighteenth of June But neither of  hose Princes was sincere in his engagements The  rst betrayed the councils and armies of France in  he very first campaign and the latter deserted her  alliance when her affairs began to assume an unfavourable aspect  Death of King James  The steps taken by William and the States against the house of Bourbon were no secret at the court of France But intelligence of the conclusion of the treaty could not have arrived at Versailles when an incident happened which induced Lewis perhaps too precipitately to declare himself in opposition to England The unfortunate King James having ever since the peace of Riswick lost every hope of being restored to the throne had resigned himself to all the austerities of religious enthusiasm His constitution though vigorous and athletic had for some time begun to yield to the infirmities of age and to that melancholy with which superstition as well as his uncommon misfortunes had impressed his mind In the beginning of September when he was according to his daily custom at public prayers he fell suddenly into a lethargy and though he recovered soon after his senses he languished for some days and expired on the sixth of September The French King with great humanity paid him several visits during his sickness and exhibited every symptom of compassion af+fection and even of respect  MS Account of King James's Death  Lewis XIV promises to own his son  Lewis being under a difficulty how to proceed upon the expected death of James called a council to take their advice whether he should own the Prince o  Wales as King of Great Britain and Ireland Th  King himself had hesitated long on this delicate poin  But the Dauphin the Duke of Burgundy and all th  Princes of the blood declared that it was unbecomin  the dignity of the crown of France not to own th  the titles of the father devolved immediately upon th  son  Continuation of the Life of James II  Lewis approving of a resolution to whic  he had been of himself inclined resolved to inform th  dying King in person of the determination of th  council When he arrived at St Germains he a  +quainted first the Queen and then her son of his d  +sign He then approached the bed in which Jam  lay almost insensible with his disorder When James rouzing himself began to thank his most Christian Majesty for all his favours the latter interrupted him and said  "Sir what I have done is but a small matter But what I have to say is of the utmost importance"  The people present began to retire  "Let no person withdraw"  he said  "I come to acquaint you Sir that when God shall please to call your Majesty from this world I shall take your family into my protection and acknowledge your son as then he will certainly be King of Great Britain and Ireland  Continuation of the Life of James II  "  who is declared King of Great Britain and Ireland  The voice of a divinity could not have made a greater impression on the unfortunate servants of James who were all present than this unexpected declaration from the French King They burst at once into a murmur of applause which seemed to be tinctured with a mixture of grief and joy Some threw themselves in silence at his feet Others wept aloud All seemed to be so much affected that Lewis himself was melted into tears James in a kind of extacy halfraised himself on the bed and endeavoured to speak But the confused noise was so great and he so weak that his voice could not be heard The King himself as if unable longer to bear this melancholy scene retired But as he passed through the court of the palace he called the officer of the guard and ordered him to treat the young Prince as King whenever his father should expire  Ibid  Though James survived this declaration but one day he sent the Earl of Middleton to Marli to thank his most Christian Majesty for his kindness to himself and his promised protection to his family Upon his death his son was acknowledged by the court and the nation Lewis himself visited him in form and treated him with the name of Majesty But the adherents of the nominal King chose not to proclaim him with the usual solemnity not knowing how the title of France  would be taken by that Prince who was the only support of his cause  Manchester to Blathwayte    Preparations for war  Though the Marquis de Torcy in the name of Lewis endeavoured to convince the English ambassador the Earl of Manchester that this transaction was no infringement on the treaty of Riswick the insult to William was too flagrant to be borne with patience He accordingly recalled his ambassador from the court of France and sent directions to the lords justices to order Poussin the French envoy to quit England Preparations for war were in the mean time made on every side The King of Denmark ordered the troops stipulated by the treaty of subsidy to march through Holstein and Hanover toward Flanders The Dutch entered Juliers with a considerable force The French possessed themselves of the towns on the Rhine as auxiliaries to the circle of Burgundy Nothing but the more form of a declaration was now wanting to constitute a war The King of England having determined to take the field early in the spring settled with the United Provinces in the capacity of Stadtholder the state of the war for the following year He was pressed in the mean time by the Emperor to break immediately with France But he had lately suffered so much from the refractoriness of the English commons that he prudently declined to enter upon hostilities without their approbation and aid  King declines in his health and returns  But the feeble constitution of William was now become unequal to the great exertions of his mind  Worn out with vexation as well as with the vigilanc  necessary for the management of the affairs of a na+tion who amidst all their professions of regard were  in a great measure averse from his manner of govern+ing his health never settled and vigorous had lo  begun apparently to decline The weak state t  which he was now reduced had rendered him almo  invisible at Loo while he was in fact the center rou  which the affairs of Europe turned But now t  alliance into which he had entered and the measure  in consequence he was forced to adopt rendered his presence necessary in England Having brought to great forwardness a perpetual alliance between the English and the Dutch for the recovery and preservation of Flanders he embarked on the fourteenth of November and landed the next day at Margate In England during the King's absence nothing remarkable happened except the ferment which the transactions of the preceding session had raised between the parties Having carried their contests into the press the people as is usual when their passions are inflamed were vehemently agitated between the arguments and declamations of the two great parties the Whigs and the Tories  Publications of the times    Contests between parties  The Whigs however more active or more determined than their opponents had the address to turn the opinions of the people to forward their own designs The declaration of the French King for the title of the Prince of Wales was an incident too favourable to their views to be dropt without being used The vulgar were easily persuaded that those who opposed the measures of the Crown in parliament were enemies to the King and they were loud in their complaints against the proceedings and conduct of the house of commons The severity of that assembly to the Kentish petitioners their contests with the lords their animadversions on the foreign transactions of government were magnified and introduced as proofs of their attachment to the exiled family The late settlement of the crown in the Protestant line the limitations highly favourable to the liberties of the people imposed upon the eventual succession of a foreign family were either entirely forgot or totally misrepresented Addresses to William upon the insult offered by France were transmitted to him in Holland Flattery absurdity and folly as is usual abounded in these unmeaning productions But they served the purpose of the King who had resolved to meet no more a parliament that had already shewn so  much aversion to the war in which he was now irrecoverably engaged  Affairs of the North  On the thirteenth of November the parliament was dissolved by proclamation and writs were issued for another to meet at Westminster on the thirtieth of December The contests usual in all elections were carried to a height proportionable to the violence and animosity of parties acting on the prejudices of the vulgar Noise and tumult filled every corner of England while every State in the North and West of Europe were indefatigably preparing to take arms The kingdoms of the East were still engaged in the war which Charles the Twelfth of Sweden had kindled in the preceding year to frustrate the unjust combination of his neighbours against his kingdom The defeat of the Russians in the battle of Narva had rendered that active and gallant Prince a conqueror the more formidable that he seemed eager with new exploits to eclipse the glory of the old His victories in Poland were as rapid as the march of his troops The Russians were every where routed as soon as seen and the King himself having passed the Duna in the sight of the enemy and totally defeated the Saxons formed at Birzen the resolution of depriving King Augustus of the throne of Poland  Hist du Nord tom ii    A new parliament  The new parliament met on the thirtieth of December and the commons from their first measure seemed to have brought into their house all the animosities which had inflamed their constituents during the election But though every art had been used by the Whigs and several Tories had in consequence  been deprived of their former seats the latter seeme  still to form a majority The first trial of the force o  the parties was made in the choice of a speaker Si  Thomas Littleton nominated by the Whigs was re+jected on a division and Harley abetted by the To+ries was placed in the chair  against  The King wh  favoured Littleton was deserted in the vote by suc  Tories as were in his service They preferred the in+fluence of their party to the countenance of a Princ  whose reign was apparently drawing to its end Their conduct however had already been so much resented by the King that he resolved to place his whole confidence in the Whigs He dismissed Sir Charles Hedges from the office of secretary of state in which the Earl of Manchester lately returned from his embassy in France was placed The Earl of Carlisle supplanted the Lord Godolphin at the head of the treasury The Earl of Pembroke supposed to be a Whig though he had actually corresponded with King James  Stuartpapers  was soon after made lord highadmiral of England and the Duke of Somerset not much more averse to the old cause succeeded Pembroke as president of the council  King's speech  The commons having presented their speaker the King made a speech to both houses from the throne He promised himself he said that they were met together full of a just sense of the danger of Europe and a high resentment of the late proceeding of the French King He expatiated upon the indignity offered to himself and the nation in owning and setting up the pretended Prince of Wales as King of England and he recommended to them to consider what further effectual means might be used to secure the succession of the crown in the Protestant line He complained that the French King by placing his grandson on the throne of Spain had furnished himself with the means of oppressing Europe and that he had surrounded his neighbours in such a manner that though the name of peace had still continued other States were put to all the inconvenience and expence of war He enlarged on what England had to fear from the power of the house of Bourbon and he informed the houses that  o obviate the general calamity which threatened Christendom he had concluded several alliances ac  ording to the encouragement given him by both houses  f parliament He told them that the eyes of Europe were turned toward their deliberations and that every  hing abroad was at a stand till their resolutions should  e known Having flattered them with their impor  nce he demanded supplies from the commons for a  great strength at sea and such a strength by land as were expected from the late alliance by the allies He concluded his speech with various arguments for their unanimity and he hoped as he himself was desirous of being the common father of all his people they would on their side lay aside parties divisions and animosities  Journals Dec    Proceedings of parliament  Though the two houses were as much as ever divided into parties such was the management of the King and the disposition of the times that they vied with one another to forward the ends proposed in his Majesty's speech The lords addressed the King in the warmest and most affectionate terms The commons without one dissenting voice voted the supply Instead of being offended at the treaty which was to engage the nation in an immediate war they addressed the throne that no peace should be made with France till reparation should be made to the King and the nation for her owning and declaring the pretended Prince of Wales King of England  Journals Jan  On the second of January they brought in a bill for the attainder of of that Prince They introduced another bill on the ninth for the further security of his Majesty's person and the succession of the crown in the Protestant line  Jan  The next day they resolved that the proportion of landforces to act in conjunction with the allies should in terms of the treaty be forty thousand men They voted forty thousand seamen for the service of the year But when the common thus gratified the King they were not negligent in their duty to their constituents They regulated the number of soldiers to be employed in every regiment of foot and troop of horse They examined with great exactness the state and condition of the navy The animosity of parties seemed to be lost in an attention to business and when disputes and contest were most to be feared all were unanimous and seem+ingly composed  The King falls from his horse  During proceedings so friendly to the designs of the Crown the King himself became sensible that he was not destined in person to carry into execution the great schemes which he had formed He however endeavoured to conceal the declining state of his health to accomplish with more facility his favourite views A fortunate coincidence of circumstances had thrown the opinions of the people into the same channel with his own The parties in parliament were so well poised that in a mutual fear of each other they both courted the King The animosities which had always embroiled and embarrassed his measures were suspended and he had the satisfaction to have one glimpse of serenity in the evening of a tempestuous reign To continue a calm so favourable to his scheme of embarking England in the war he spread reports of his recovery But an accident accelerated that dissolution which was apparently advancing though by slow degrees On the twentyfirst of February willing still to continue his usual diversion of hunting he mounted his horse though in a languishing state of health and riding out from Kensington towards Hamptoncourt the horse fell and in his fall his Majesty broke his right collarbone He was carried to Hamptoncourt and the bone was set but contrary to advice he returned the same evening in his coach to Kensington  His death  This accident though it might have hastened the death of William bore for some time no appearance of proving fatal On the twentyeighth of February the Gazette declared in express terms that the King was perfectly recovered and on the same day he sent a message to both houses concerning an union between the kingdoms of England and Scotland On the first of March the bill for attainting the pretended Prince of Wales received the royal assent by commission On the second day of that month such symptoms appeared that all hopes of the King's recovery were lost A defluxion fell upon his knee The asthma to which he had been always subject increased He breathed short and he was restless and feverish The two houses in the mean time  continued to sit The council was assembled to receive the reports of the physicians But even in that extremity it was maliciously remarked that no Englishman of quality had any access to the King's chamber About five in the morning of Sunday the eighth of March his Majesty received the sacrament from the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury and at eight he expired in the arms of one of his pages Some papers which might throw considerable light on the history of this Prince were with his last breath consigned to the hands of the Earl of Albemarle and they were probably destroyed by that lord Albemarle whose original office was that of a transcriber of letters had been employed in the preceding month on a service of the same kind He had returned on the seventeenth of February from Holland with all the secret correspondences which had passed between the King and the Pensionary under the supposition that the latter was also dying  Reflections  Though the character given of the Prince of Orange  Vol i p  in an early period of his life ran through the whole conduct of King William when he sat on the throne of England some new and striking features were called forth by the extraordinary events which filled his reign His political conduct and the disposition of his mind have been variously and oppositely represented a thing not surprising in a country where writers have not been able to divest themselves of the prejudices and partialities incident to party In such a jarring state of opinions this Prince must have been too much praised by the one side and by the other as extravagantly condemned The nearest path to truth must certainly lie between these two extremes But that path though obvious has not hitherto been trod by historians who have uniformly yielded to the prejudices of others or have been swayed by their own Their proximity to the period concerning which they wrote may form for many a compleat excuse The passions of party came glowing down on the current of the times Authors caught the heat of those with whom they themselves were most connected in  life and became inadvertently and sometimes designedly partial through a weakness which they unjustly dignified with the name of principle  His person  William the Third King of Great Britain and Ireland was in his person of a middle size illshaped in his limbs somewhat round in the shoulders lightbrown in the colour of his hair and in his complexion The lines of his face were hard and his nose aquiline But a good and penetrating eye threw a kind of light on his countenance which tempered its severity and rendered his harsh features in some measure agreeable Though his constitution was weak delicate and infirm he loved the manly exercises of the field and often indulged himself in the pleasures and even sometimes in the excesses of the table In his private character he was frequently harsh passionate and severe with regard to trifles But when the subject rose equal to his mind and in the tumult of battle he was dignified cool and serene Though he was apt to form bad impressions which were not easily removed he was neither vindictive in his disposition nor obstinate in his resentment Neglected in his education and perhaps destitute by nature of an elegance of mind he had no taste for literature none for the sciences none for the beautiful arts He paid no attention to music he understood no poetry He  isregarded learning He encouraged no men of let  ers no painters no artists of any kind In fortifica  on and in the mathematics he had a considerable  egree of knowledge Though unsuccessful in the  eld he understood military operations by land But  e neither possessed nor pretended any skill in mari  me affairs  and private character  In the distribution of favours he was cold and in  dicious In the punishment of crimes often too  sy and sometimes too severe He was parsimonious  here he should be liberal where he ought to be  ring frequently profuse In his temper he was  ent and reserved in his address ungraceful and  ough not destitute of dissimulation and qualified  intrigue less apt to conceal his passions than his  signs These defects rather than vices of the mind  combining with an indifference about humouring mankind through their ruling passions rendered him extremely unfit for gaining the affections of the English nation His reign therefore was crowded with mortifications of various kinds The discontented parties among his subjects found no difficulty in estranging the minds of the people from a Prince possessed of few talents to make him popular He was trusted perhaps less than he deserved by the most obsequious of his parliaments but it seems upon the whole apparent that the nation adhered to his government more from a fear of the return of his predecessor than from any attachment to his own person or respect for his right to the throne  His public conduct  These harsh features of the mind of King William presented themselves only to those who took a near and critical view of his conduct To men who observed him at a distance and as a principal object in the great scale of Europe he appeared a respectable a prudent and even a great Prince During the last twenty years of his life his abilities by a dextrous management of the events of the times raised him to an influence in Christendom scarce ever before carried by a Prince beyond the limits of his own dominions Peculiarly fortunate in the success of his political measures he obtained his authority through channels the most flattering because the most uncom+mon He was placed at the head of his native coun+try as the last hopes of her safety from conquest an  a foreign yoke He was raised to the throne of Grea  Britain under the name of her deliverer from civ  tyranny and religious persecution He was considere  in the same important light by the rest of Europ  The Empire Spain and Italy looked up to his coun+cils as their only resource against the exorbita  ambition and power of Lewis the Fourteenth a  France herself when she affected to despise his pow+er the most owned his importance by an illiber  joy upon a false report of his death      Reflections on both  But if the private character of William has be  too critically examined here the praise bestowed  his public conduct ought to terminate Though he was brave in action and loved war as an amusement he possessed not the talents of a great general and he was too prodigal of the lives of men Though he obtained the name of a deliverer in England and though in fact he might be considered in that light with regard to Europe more is owing to his own ambition than to a general love of mankind In Holland where he obtained the chief authority in a time of public distress he frequently exercised his power in a manner inconsistent with the rights of a free state  D'Avaux  In England he scarce adhered in any thing to the moderate declaration which paved his way to the throne Though he obtained the crown by election he shewed no disposition to relinquish any of its hereditary ornaments and though he affected to despise royalty no Prince was ever more fond of the distinction paid to a King His intrigues to expel his uncle from a throne which he himself intended to mount were by no means suitable with any strict adherence to virtue  James II D'Avaux MSS Dalrymple's Append  To gain to his interest the servants of King James may not have been inconsistent with those allowances generally made for ambitious views But there was a considerable degree of immorality in his being accessary to the suggesting of those unpopular measures which he turned afterwards with so much success against that unfortunate as well as imprudent Monarch  D'Avaux MSS  Upon the whole if we must allow that King William with all his faults was a great Prince it ought also to be admitted that virtue was never an unsurmountable obstacle to his ambition and views on power  QUEEN ANNE  CHAP V  Accession of AnneState of partiesHer first speech to parliamentShe

FraserHis crimesHis plot discoveredDispute between the housesParliament prorogued  Accession of Anne  ANNE Princess of Denmark eldest surviving daughter of James the Second mounted the throne of England upon the death of King William in consequence of the act passed in the year for the settlement of the crown The two houses of parliament  as soon as the death of the late King was made known assembled and unanimously congratulated the Queen upon her accession To the privy council who met at the same time she made the customary declaration and ordered all the Lords and others who had served the late King in council to take the oaths to herself in the same capacity  March  She was proclaimed in the afternoon of the eighth of March with the usual solemnity amidst the applause of the populace The two succeeding days were employed in receiving the addresses of the two houses of parliament the felicitations of the church and the congratulations of the city of London The late king unpopular while he lived was almost forgot as soon as dead and the people with their usual eagerness for novelty turned all their thoughts toward the first measures of the new reign  State of parties  Though the late King had no reason to be pleased with either of the two parties who had divided between them the nation he had some months before his death thrown himself and his affairs into the hands of the Whigs The hopes derived by the Tories from the declining state of his health had prevented that violence which they might have otherwise exhibited in parliament on account of their being excluded from power The unanimity in the two houses with regard to foreign affairs proceeded probably from the same cause The Whigs could deny nothing to the Crown as their leaders were in office and the Tories were not averse to a war which they themselves were sure to manage after the expected demise of the King The two parties had pledged themselves too far to retreat from their engagements and therefore though a change of ministry was naturally to be expected from the accession of a Princess whom the coldness of her predecessor and the disrespectful conduct of the party now in power had evidently thrown into the arms of the Tories there was no reason to apprehend any change in the great line of the measures of government  Anne's first speech March  The Queen in her first speech to parliament furnished a proof that she was led by councils very different  from those of her predecessor in the throne Though she paid a compliment to his memory in the beginning she concluded with a kind of censure upon his conduct She assured the two houses that as her own heart was entirely English she would agree to every thing that they could either expect or desire for the happiness and prosperity of England The expression manifestly regarded the too great attachment to his own countrymen for which King William had been blamed But to this allusion to the predilection of the late King for foreigners she added words that seemed highly to reflect on his moral conduct In confirmation of her promise to both houses she assured them that they would always find HER a strict and religious observer of her word The first part of the Queen's speech contained the usual assurances of a new reign She agreed she said in sentiments with with the concurrent addresses of the two houses that too much could not be done for the allies to reduce the exorbitant power of France She recommended an union with Scotland as necessary for the peace and security of both kingdoms and she desired that the revenue for the support of the civil government should be renewed in a manner suitable to her own honour and the dignity of the Crown  Journals March    Proceedings of the commons  Though the Queen was at no pains to conceal her attachment to one party the other could not oppose her measures in parliament without deserting their own The eagerness which she discovered to adhere to the measures of King William with regard to foreign affairs would render an opposition to the necessary sup+plies too inconsistent with the late conduct of the Whigs They made a merit therefore of comply+ing with what they could not prevent The com+mons pursued with a shew of unanimity and zeal th  affairs recommended from the throne They settle  upon her Majesty  March  during life the revenue possess+ed by the late King for the support of the civil go+vernment They ordered a bill to impower th  crown to appoint commissioners to treat for an unio  between England and Scotland Provision had been already made for the eventual expence of a war during the succeeding summer and the Queen instead of demanding supplies from the nation found an opportunity of alleviating a part of their burden When she came to the house of lords on the thirtieth of March to give the royal assent to the bill for the establishment of her own revenue she made a speech from the throne calculated to gain popularity She told the two houses that though the funds for the civil list might greatly fall short of what they formerly produced she would give directions that one hundred thousand pounds of her own revenue should be applied to the public service of the year  Journals March    The Queen engages to support the allies  While Anne was rendering herself popular at home she gained the esteem of her allies abroad by shewing a warm zeal for their cause Two days after the death of William she condoled with the States of the Uuited Provinces upon that event in a letter She assured them that as she had succeeded the late King in his throne she would also succeed him in the same inclination to a constant union and amity with their republic as well as adherence to the late alliances That she would concur with the allies in general in measures necessary for the preservation of the common liberty of Europe in reducing the power of France within proper bounds That she should always look upon the interest of England and those of the States as inseparable and united with such ties as could not be broken without the greatest prejudice to the two nations The Earl of Marlborough was probably the adviser of measures which he afterwards executed with ability The attachment which this nobleman had uniformly shewn to the Queen when she was little respected by the nation and persecuted by the court had either excited sentiments of gratitude or created principles of obedience to his inclinations in her mind The first honours and even the first considerable office conferred in the present reign were bestowed on the Earl  March  On the thirteenth of March he received  the garter The next day he was appointed captaingeneral of all the forces to be employed by the Queen in conjunction with the troops of the allies and the week thereafter he was dispatched to Holland in the character of ambassador extraordinary to the States  Life of Marlborough vol i    A ferment without doors  The victory obtained by the Tories over the Whigs by the succession of a sovereign of their own principles to the throne produced a ferment without doors though all things bore a face of harmony and unanimity within Violent men of both parties carried their own prejudices with indecent freedom to the press and disgraced their conversation with mutual reflections of the worst and most dangerous kind The Whigs were openly accused of aiming at the establishment of a commonwealth by endeavouring to deprive the reigning Queen of the succession to the throne The memory of the late King was attacked with open assertions of the same kind though it is highly probable that Prince was very indifferent about what person should mount after him the throne An en+quiry by the lords into this idle tale produced only a negative proof of its not being founded in fact They voted upon an examination of King William's pa+pers by a committee that nothing appeared that tend+ed to the prejudice of her Majesty or her succession to the crown The Lords followed this unmeaning vote with animadversions upon injurious reflection  printed against the Whigs  May  The Tories in th  mean time failed not to annoy their opponents in th  same way They procured a vote that a book reflect+ing on King Charles the First was a scandalous an  villainous libel that tended to the subversion of mo+narchy and as such they ordered the book to b  burnt by the hands of the common hangman  May    A new ministry  On the twelsth of April the late King was private+ly interred and on the twentythird of the sam  month the Queen was crowned with the usual so+lemnity at Westminster The Tory party who a  ready governed her councils in private were now admitted without reserve into the public departments of the state The offices of the household were filled with men of high principles for monarchy The Lords Somers and Halifax together with other leaders of the Whigs were excluded from the new privycouncil  April  and their places supplied with eminent Tories The Marquis of Normanby remarkable for his attachment to her family was raised to the office of lord privyseal by the Queen But the most important promotion of all was that of the Lord Godolphin to the staff of lord hightreasurer of England Though Godolphin was well qualified for this important station he owed his office more to the influence of the Earl of Marlborough than to his own merit The connection which had long subsisted in political views between these two noble persons had been lately more closely cemented by the marriage of the son of the former with the eldest daughter of the latter Their private interests being thus united they carried forward with harmony as well as abilities the business of the public  Marlborough and Godolphin in correspondence with St Germains  The accession of Anne to the crown had removed to a distance the hopes of the court of St Germains But they were not entirely quashed till the appointment of her servants Though Marlborough had been raised by King William in the preceding year to the command of the British troops in Flanders he listened after the death of James the Second to the solicitations made in favour of the son of that unfortunate Prince  Stuartpapers  A kind of principle in favour of the family of Stuart had been mixed with this nobleman's aversion to William and there is scarce any doubt that had their restoration to the throne suited equally with his own private interest but he would have preferred them to any other race of sovereigns Godolphin had been long attached to the same cause Though he had promoted the views of the Prince of Orange he soon changed his opinion with regard to King William He had listened with attention ever since  the expulsion of James to all overtures made by th  adherents of that Prince and upon his death he ex+pressed the same attachment and regard to his so  The natural timidity of his disposition prevented hi  formerly from making any vigorous exertions in favor  of the excluded family and after the demise of Wil+liam the thing itself became more difficult and besides his own zeal was rendered more cool by th  prospect of advantage which he derived from the ne  reign  State of opinions with regard to the Queen's accession  The state of opinions had actually changed in Eng+land with the state of its affairs The crown by th  death of William had fallen almost into the old chan+nel Instead of a foreigner and only a relation a Princess a native of the kingdom the only daughte  of a King whose title as far as it was hereditary  was undoubted and at the same time a protestant  and much attached to the church had now possessio  of the throne The greatest part of the highflyin  Tories and even some vehement and determined Ja+cobites were satisfied on account of its convenience  with small deviation from the line of successio  Though they were both especially the latter invar  +ably attached to the hereditary descent of the crow  they were willing to leave to events that might ari  in the progress of time what could not be done  present either with certainty or without dang  Though they had a recent example before them t  the quiet enjoyment of the crown depended by  means upon any hereditary right they hoped  the influence of the reigning sovereign would ena  her to bequeath the throne to her own family Si  +lar sentiments had been adopted by the few pers  who still formed at St Germains the idle shew  a court They knew the professions which the Qu  had made to her father during the most part of  predecessor's reign and they endeavoured to flat  themselves with hopes that she only took possession  the government to restore and confirm the crown  +pecially at her death to her excluded brother  Stuartpapers    War declared  These reasons united the Tories and the Jacobites in an unanimous support of the government of the new Queen The Whigs either yielded to the current of the people always violent for monarchy in every new reign or they were ashamed of opposing measures which sprung first from themselves On the second of May the business of the intended war against France and Spain was debated in the privycouncil The Earl of Rochester maternal uncle to the Queen is said to have proposed that the English nation should only engage in the measures of the allies as auxiliaries and that the chief weight of the war ought to rest on those who had most to fear from the power of France The Earl of Marlborough who had returned from Holland after settling the projected operations with the States declared himself vehement for an immediate declaration of war to be issued by England as a principal The measures taken by himself during an embassy of a few days in Holland rendered in some degree necessary the measure which he supported The States upon the assurances made by the Queen had agreed to all the proposals of her reputed favourite They had raised him to the chief command of their troops the allies had furnished with alacrity their several quotas and every thing was actually prepared for a vigorous and active campaign A majority of the council yielded either to the influence or reasons of the Earl of Marlborough Their resolutions were communicated the same day to the commons and war was declared in form on the fourth of May  Parliament prorogued  The commons had agreed to all that the court desired with regard to war before the death of the King They had therefore no opportunity of shewing their  iberality in that respect to the Queen The pub  ic business being brought to a conclusion the parlia  ent was prorogued on the twentyfifth of May  eparations for prosecuting the war with vigour by  a as well as by land had been made in the principal  rts of the kingdom The Earl of Pembroke who  ad been raised by the late King to the office of lord  dmiral of England was succeeded in that important  epartment by the Prince of Denmark The complaisance  of the different parties to the new Queen induced them to overlook an informality in the commission conferred on her consort He was permitted to chuse a council for his information and assistance in the execution of his office This circumstance was considered as the creation of a new board a thing not allowable according to the opinion of many but by act of parliament But the respect of the nation for the Queen and the peculiar situation of the Prince himself prevented all enquiry upon this subject  Affairs of Scotland  While the business of the public was carried on with such unanimity in England the affairs of Scotland became embroiled intricate and perplexed  Burnet vol iii  Though the late King had found means to allay the ferment concerning the business of Darien the animosities and heats against government were rather suspended that extinguished The discontents of the Scotish nation had uniformly subsisted during the whole of King William's reign and that Prince with more polic  than justice had continued for the thirteen years h  had sat on the throne the same conventionparliamen  which had placed the crown of Scotland on his hea  The unabating disgust among the people rendered th  King unwilling to remand them to a choice of a ne  representative Though the old parliament had fre+quently proved refractory he knew that they had  +ther yielded to the current of the times than to eith  their regard to the interests of their constituents  their dislike to his own government Besides his se  +vants had through a long habit and experience d  +covered the secret channel to the vote of every mem+ber They made such good use of this knowledg  that the serment concerning Darien had unaccoun  +ably subsided at once in the January of and  kind of surly tranquillity prevailed among the peop  during that whole year  Mem of Scotland    A great serment  The conduct of Anne upon her accession to t  throne of Scotland was by no means calculated to  +tinguish the discontents which lay lurking in ev  corner of that kingdom Unwilling to offend  Whigs whom her ministers considered as the most powerful party they continued all the servants of her predecessor in the higher departments of the state The joy therefore which her elevation had raised among the discontented soon declined They applied through their leaders for the dissolution of the conventionparliament But they were opposed by the ministers who were afraid to venture upon the new choice of a people already inflamed The Queen suffered herself to be persuaded by the arguments of the latter or to be swayed by her own fears She continued the old parliament which was appointed to meet on the ninth of June To add to the discontents of those who called themselves the country party the Duke of Queensberry highly obnoxious to the people in general was appointed commissioner Prior to the meeting of parliament the Queen endeavoured to allay the bad humour of the malecontents and to sooth the people into an acquiescence with regard to her own measures She wrote a letter as early as the twentyfirst of April to the parliament full of assurances of her protection to the rights of the people and the interest and independence of the kingdom She expressed her regret at the disappointments of the African company She promised her concurrence in every  ing for the encouragement of the commerce of the  ation in general and for repairing the losses of the  dventurers in particular She recommended at the  ame time the union between the kingdoms and that  e should think the bringing to perfection a measure  salutary the greatest happiness of her reign  Letter April    A secession of eighty members  Fair words were by no means sufficient either to  ratify the populace or to gain their leaders When  e parliament on the ninth of June met at Edin  urgh the Duke of Hamilton before her Majesty's  ommission was read rose in his place and protested  gainst their sitting He offered his reasons in a short  eech to the house and communicated a paper to  e same purpose containing his own protest and that  such members as should adhere to his opinion He  immediately went out of the house Eighty members following his example seceded at the same time and were received in the streets with the loudest acclamations of the populace who had assembled on this extraordinary occasion The members who remained in the house notwithstanding this great secession considered themselves a legal parliament After the commission and the Queen's letter were read they adjourned for two days and when they met again on the eleventh of June they appointed the usual committees and proceeded to business Overtures were received immediately for various acts of importance One of these declaring the present meeting a legal parliament and discharging all persons from disowning its authority under the penalty of hightreason was unanimously passed and touched with the sceptre the next day  June    An act for settling the crown rejected  The dissenting members endeavoured in vain to justify their own conduct to the Queen Though she admitted their messenger the Lord Blantyre into her presence she absolutely refused to receive their address She signified at the same time to the sitting members that she was resolved to maintain against al  opposers their dignity and authority as a legal parliament The session accordingly proceeded with a  appearance of vigour amidst all the clamours of th  people They granted an immediate supply to th  Queen They reprimanded the faculty of advocates  for declaring that the protest and conduct of the se  +ceded members was founded on the laws of the king+dom They passed an act for enabling the Queen  appoint commissioners for an union between the tw  kingdoms  June  But notwithstanding their unan  +mity upon these points an overture made by th  chancellor the Earl of Marchmont for the settleme  of the crown in the protestant line and for abjuri  the pretended Prince of Wales was rejected T  commissioner having received no instructions upo  that head from England laid his commands upo  Marchmont not to proceed But the vehemence  the latter overcame his respect for the authority of the former  Causes of that circumstance  The Queen herself and her English ministers were at the time extremely averse from this measure They had various reasons for wishing to keep the succession open in Scotland They wished to retain a check upon the Whigs and to awe the family of Hannover who from a near prospect of the crown might extend their intrigues to the affairs of the kingdom They favoured at the same time the excluded Prince Besides the regard which Anne may be naturally supposed to have entertained for a brother she had given a thousand assurances to her father to do every thing in her power to restore the succession to the ancient channel even before the death of her own son the Duke of Gloucester The demise of that Prince her own despair of progeny her respect for the memory of a father and some affection for her own family had probably rendered her inclined to transfer the crown at her death to the pretended Prince of Wales Her chief minister Godolphin and her greatest favourite the Earl of Marlborough had added the most solemn oaths to their promises to support the interest of King James and his son They had renewed these promises even since the accession of the reigning Queen had thrown the whole power of the kingdom into their hands  Stuartpapers  though they never meant to deprive her during her life of the crown should she continue to hold it under their direction and ministry  Parliament prorogued  During the heats raised by the illtimed overture made by Marchmont the members who opposed it  scovered an inclination for admitting the dissenting  embers into the house Queensberry afraid of the  nsequences adjourned the parliament from the  rtieth of June to the eighteenth of August A  nd of unsettled tranquillity succeeded the combustion  sed by the Scotish malecontents But though com  ssioners were appointed for an union between the  o kingdoms both parties shewed so little inclination  to finish that important treaty that the whole fell for the time to the ground The majority of the Scots had in their disgust at the conduct of the late King with regard to their commerce forgot those terrors for their religion which had induced them to place the crown on his head The Highlanders especially who were never enthusiasts had always suffered their high notions of hereditary right to overcome their attachment to Presbytery The accession of Anne by bringing the throne nearer to the old stock had established in their minds a kind of certainty that things were to return to their former channel The assurances given by them of supporting upon a proper occasion the efforts of the malecontents  Stuartpapers MSS  encouraged greatly the secession of the dissenting members who certainly covered their affection for the excluded family under the specious pretext of adhering to the laws of their country  Campaign in Flanders  Though the war was kindled on all sides between the allies and the house of Bourbon the campaign produced no decisive event The feeble state of the latter was balanced by the unprepared condition of the former who except England and Holland were not furnished with the means of acting with any vigour The military operations of the season began on the part of the allies with the siege of Keyserswaert which the Elector of Cologn had placed in the hands of the French  April  The Prince of Baden assembled in the mean time an army on the UpperRhine to cut off the communication between the country of Alsace and Landau which he resolved to besiege The French found themselves unable to relieve either of those important places Keyser+swaert surrendered to the allies after a siege of fifty+nine days  July  and Landau having been gallantly defended for three months fell into the hands of th  King of the Romans on the tenth of Septembe  The Duke of Burgundy having under him th  Mareschal de Boufflers made an attempt in vai  upon Nimeguen  June  and the Earl of Marlborough having taken the command of the allied army in Flanders on the second of July was disappointed in all his endeavours to bring the enemy to battle He however reduced Venlo  Sept  Ruremonde  Oct  and the citadel of Liege  Oct  and having thus opened the navigation of the Maese and the communication with the town of Mastricht put an end with reputation to the campaign on the side of Flanders  in Italy and on the Rhine  The principal effort of the Emperor was made in Italy where Prince Eugene who commanded his forces was opposed by the combined armies of France and Spain Eugene as early as the first of February had surprised Cremona But he was instantly expelled from the place chiefly by the valour of the Irish troops in the French service The Mareschal de Villeroi was however taken by the Germans and the command devolved on the Duke de Vendôme The young King of Spain took the field in person Having left the government in the hands of the Queen assisted by a council he had passed into Naples and took the nominal command of the army which was actually led by Vendôme A body of five thousand under the general Viscomti were defeated at Santa Vittoria on the twentysixth of July Prince Eugene was forced on the first of August to raise the blockcade of Mantua and he was in soem degree worsted on the fifteenth of the same month at Luzara This advantage obtained by the French in Italy was fol  owed by a victory on the Upper Rhine The Mar  uis de Villars having been detached from the army  ommanded by the Mareschal de Catinat defeated  he Imperialists under the Prince of Baden though  ushed with the conquest of Landau To sum the whole of this campaign the French lost the greatest  umber of towns and gained most advantages in the  eld  Operation at sea  The operations at sea were less favourable to France  nd Spain than the campaign by land The confederate  fleet consisting of fisty ships of the line thirty English and twenty Dutch commanded in chief by Sir George Rook sailed on the first of July from St Helens They carried twelve thousand troops on board nine thousand English and three Dutch under the command of the Duke of Ormond Detained by calms and contrary winds they arrived not in the neighbourhood of Cadiz which place they intended to attack till the twelfth of August Having landed the troops the Duke of Ormond took Fort St Catharine and Port St mary which last place was plundered by the licentious soldiery contrary to the intentions and commands of their general After a vain attempt on Fort Matagorda the troops were reimbarked in the middle of September The confederates steered then their course to Vigo where the Spanish galleons under the convoy of thirty French ships of war commanded by ChateauRenaud were just arrived and having expectedly and almost unperceived come to anchor before the place they resolved to attack it with the utmost vigour  Success before Vigo  The French and Spaniards had carried up their vesels beyond a streight defended on the one side by a castle on the other by platforms mounted with cannon together with a strong boom formed of masts cables and chains thrown across the entrance  The Duke of Ormond having landed some troops took the castle  Oct  Viceadmiral Hopson in the Torbay broke through the boom He was followed by the Dutch squadron under Vandergoes The French admiral perceiving the boom broken the castle and platforms taken the enemy in the same ba+son with his own squadron ordered his ship to be se  on fire His example was followed by all the res  But when the enemy were thus employed in destroy+ing their own fleet the English and Dutch endeavoure  to extinguish the flames Six men of war were take  seven sunk and nine burnt Of thirteen galleon  nine sell into the hands of the confederates and fo  were destroyed Though the greatest part of t  treasure on board the galleons had been removed  the enemy the English and Dutch made an immense booty and the Spanish marine was annihilated from that moment The Duke of Ormond having thus amply recovered at Vigo the laurels he had lost before Cadiz returned to England and was received at London with great marks of favour by the Queen and with the loud acclamations of the populace  War in Poland  In Poland the war was carried on with vigour between Charles the Twelfth of Sweden and King Augustus The first advancing to Warsaw with rapid march put a sudden end to the Polish diet assembled at that place Augustus fled precipitately to Cracow whither he was pursued by the Swedes The King of Poland in the mean time having posted himself advantageously at Clissow with thirty thousand men chiefly Saxons Charles marched toward him and without permitting his troops to rest a moment though much inferior in number attacked routed and put to flight the enemy Four thousand Saxons lay dead on the field A great number of the Poles were also slain Two thousand with all the artillery and baggage of King Augustus fell into the hands of the Swedes Cracow though provided with the means of defence surrendered without resistance But an  ccident which befel the conqueror stopt his own  rogress and encouraged his enemies to renew their  fforts Having fallen from his horse in marching  ut of Cracow he was confined for six weeks to his  ed while Augustus assembled at Sandomir his own  artizans under the name of a diet Another diet  on after met at Warsaw They sent a deputation  the King of Sweden but that Prince refused to  mit their deputies into his presence under the pre  nce that the Republic had made themselves parties  the war by having fought against him in the battle  Clissow  Hist du Nord tom ii    A new parliament  During these transactions abroad the Queen made  progress through part of the kingdom She visited  xford She spent some time at Bath She accepted  an invitation to Bristol She was received every  where with the marks of public joy indiscriminately bestowed by the populace on all princes But it appeared in the new elections for she had dissolved the parliament on the second of July that from her avowed principles in favour of the highchurch she was extremely popular The Toryparty when the votes depended on the free suffrages of the vulgar prevailed The new parliament after two prorogations met at Westminster on the twentieth of October and the commons having unanimously chosen Mr Robert Harley for their speaker the Queen as usual made a speech to both houses from the throne Having expressed her satisfaction at meeting a new parliament she demanded such supplies as might enable her to comply with engagements already made and such others as might be deemed necessary for the encouragement and support of the allies To induce her subjects to bear with chearfulness the necessary taxes she desired her parliament to inspect all the accounts of receipts and payments and to punish abuses She observed she said with a degree of concern that the funds for the year had in some measure failed and that though she had paid and applied the hundred thousand pounds which she had promised to the last parliament yet that sum had not supplied the deficiency  Oct    Proceedings of the commons  The lords congratulated her Majesty in general terms upon the success of her arms under the Earl of Marlborough  Oct  But the commons shewed the principles that prevailed in their house by comparing with advantage the present reign with the last The Queen had mentioned in her speech her great concern at the disappointment before Cadiz and th  commons in their address made light of that mis+fortune when compared with the wonderful progress of her arms in Flanders under the Earl of Marlbo+rough who had signally RETRIEVED the ancient ho+nour and glory of the English nation This reflecti  on the memory of the late King was opposed by th  Whigs in a manner which shewed only the gre  superiority of the Tories when the house was divided upon the question  Oct  The same day a supply was unanimously voted for the war The commons resolved on the thirtieth of October that forty thousand seamen should be employed for the service of the next year They voted on the sixth of November  Nov  that the English proportion of land forces to act in conjunction with the allies should be forty thousand men They granted a supply of eight hundred thousand pounds  Nov  for maintaining these forces three hundred and fifty thousand for the guards and garrisons including five thousand men to be employed by sea and fifty thousand pounds for subsidies to her Majesty's allies  A dispute between the houses  In the midst of this good humour in parliament intelligence of the success before Vigo arrived at London The Queen acquainted the two houses that she had appointed the twelfth of November as a day of thanksgiving for the signal successes of her arms She accordingly went in person to St Paul's on that day  Nov  attended by the peers and commons A slight dispute between the two houses interrupted for a moment the general harmony and unanimity which seemed to prevail On a complaint made to the commons by Sir John Packington  Nov  against the Bishop of Worcester for an undue interference in the late elections they addressed her Majesty to remove that prelate from the office of lord almoner The lords offended at the proceedings of the commons against a member of their body presented a counter address to the Queen She however chose to comply with the request of the commons whom she knew to be devoted to her service She had told the lords with a degree of spirit that though she had not yet received by proof of the complaints against the Bishop of Worcester she considered it as her undoubted right  continue or displace any of her servants at pleasure  hat prelate was accordingly dismissed immediately  om the office of almoner  Nov  His disgrace proceeded  more from the resentment of the highchurch party for his having adhered to their opponents than from any undue influence used in the election for Worcester  An eventual pension settled on the Prince of Denmark  The readiness shewn by the Queen to gratify the commons produced a return of complaisance on the part of that assembly In consequence of a message carried to the house by Secretary Hedges they resolved that the yearly sum of one hundred thousand pounds should be settled on the Prince of Denmark should he happen to survive her Majesty  Nov  But to an application made by the Queen in favour of the Earl of Marlborough they paid not the like regard That nobleman having finished with great reputation the campaign in Flanders had in the beginning of November quitted the army and resolved to return to the Hague Having embarked on the Maese at Mastricht he was taken prisoner by a part of the garrison of Guelders the only place now remaining to the French in Spanish Guelderland The good fortune which had attended the Earl in the field did not desert him on the present occasion Producing a fictitious pass to the enemy he was dismissed in a few hours without being known and having settled measures with the States he arrived in England in the end of November  Nov    One refused to Marlborough  Two days  Nov  after his arrival a committee of the house of commons presented the Earl with the thank  of that assembly for his great and signal services On the second of December her Majesty informed the coun+cil that she intended to raise him to the rank of  duke and on the tenth of the same month she sen  a message to the commons to request them to settle upon him and his heirs for ever five thousand poun  a year which she had granted him out of the pos  office during her own life  Dec  The private chara  +ter of Marlborough notwithstanding the brilliancy  his public transactions was not calculated to ga  friends An inordinate love of money had induced hi  frequently to stoop to acts of meanness that were  inconsistent with the conduct of a gentleman as they were unworthy of his great talents His political delinquency was at the same time brought to his account by the two great parties which divided the nation The Tories had not yet forgot his desertion of his benefactor King James the Second and those who favoured the revolution remembered to his disadvantage his conduct toward the late King The Queen's message was received at first with astonishment and silence A violent debate at length arose Much was said of the merit of Marlborough But the house informed the Queen that they could not comply with a precedent to alienate the revenue of the crown  Dec    His intrigues with St Germains  The Duke foreseeing from the complexion of the debates that their result would be unfavourable prayed the Queen to withdraw her message This circumstance however hindered not the commons from presenting their address The Tories who now formed a great majority contrived to convey a reflection on the late King in their refusal of a settlement on Marlborough They complained that the revenue of the crown had been already too much reduced by the exorbitant grants of the last reign to bear any further alienation The adherents of the excluded branch of the family of Stuart seemed to be most inclined to involve Marlborough in the censure passed upon King William Though he was known to have uniformly opposed the power of that Prince he was not deemed sincere in his professions and promises to his rival His zeal it is certain had greatly abated since the accession of Anne to the throne He however kept upon fair terms with the court of St Germains He endeavoured to ascribe to the multiplicity of his affairs that want of attention which actually proceeded from a change of his own views He had throughout the preceding summer expressed frequently a warm attachment to the cause of the pretended Prince of Wales and as a proof of his zeal he granted passes to the agents of that Prince when they wished to transport themselves into France to inform their master  of the state of his affairs in England  Stuartpapers  But though he exposed himself to the laws of his country by this conduct he had not the good fortune to satisfy those whom he affected to serve  A motion for resuming King William's grants  Should a judgment be formed of the principles of the present house of commons from their disposition to animadvert upon the conduct of the late King they might be concluded to have been extremely averse from the change which that Prince had made in the succession to the crown The commissioners for public accounts made strict enquiries into the application of the public money in the last reign  Journals Dec  Sir Edward Seymour who had distinguished himself in the debate against Marlborough moved for leave to bring in a bill for resuming all grants made in King William's reign and for applying them to the use of the public  Dec  This motion was carried by a very great majority  against  But another made by Mr Walpole that all grants made in the reign of King James should be resumed passed in the negative The prevailing party consisting chiefly of the landed interest followed their victory with another important motion They procured an order for bringing in a bill to prevent all persons to be members of the house of commons except such as should be found possessed of real estates These motions however seemed rather intended to shew the power of the party than meant seriously to be carried into laws The bill of resumption in particular was deemed so severe that it was actually dropt afterwards by those who had carried the moti+on for its being introduced with so high a hand  Journals  the lords  and the bill for members to possess real estates wa  thrown out by the lords  Feb    A bill to prevent occasional conformity  While the Tories carried every thing in the hous  of commons their violence was considerably checked  by the predominancy of the opposite party in the hous  of peers The act passed in the first year of Willia  and Mary in favour of protestant dissenters had bee  always disliked by the highchurch party The influence of the court joined to the zeal of the Whigs had prevented any attempt to repeal this act as long as William sat upon the throne But the party who favoured the church finding themselves so powerful in the house of commons under a Queen who adhered to their principles passed an order on the fourth of November for bringing in a bill to prevent occasinal conformity The bill was accordingly prepared and introduced by Mr Bromley and Mr St John the latter afterwards well known under the title of Bolingbroke On the ninth of December the bill was a third time read passed and sent to the lords Though the latter rejected not the bill they made several amendments to which the commons would not yield A conference between the two houses upon the subject produced nothing but a more firm adherence on both sides to their respective opinions The commons ordered at length  Feb  their proceedings upon this whole affair to be printed Their example was followed by the lords and the bill was dropt  A division between the houses  The bill to prevent occasional conformity furnished not the only cause of dispute between the two houses The commissioners appointed for the inspection of public accounts proceeding with their enquiries the commons resolved that the Lord Halifax auditor of the exchequer had been guilty of a breach of trust and great mismanagements in his office The lords having called for the accounts came to a resolution diametrically opposite to that of the commons They voted that the Lord Halifax had performed the duty of his office as auditor of the exchequer in transmitting the imprest rolls to the Queen's remembrancer The commons in a conference denied the right of the lords to examine any accounts as they could  either supply deficiencies nor apply any surplusage  he grant of all aids being inherently vested in the commons That even in their judicial capacity the lords  ould only proceed against mismanagements upon the  complaint of the commons and that no informatio  collected from the accounts themselves could entitl  the lords either to acquit or condemn The lords  provoked at the representations of the lower house  resolved that the peers had an undoubted right t  take cognizance of the public accounts That thei  proceedings with regard to the Lord Halifax wer  regular and that the commons in their conference  had thrown unbecoming reflections on the lords an  had used unparliamentary arguments  Feb    Parliament Prorogued  The commons equally irritated reduced the argu+ments advanced by their committee into votes of thei  house A second conference rather increased than di+minished the heats on both sides But a sudden proro+gation put an end to the dispute and the session Th  Queen came to the house of lords on the twenty+seventh of February and made a speech from th  throne She thanked the two houses for the dispatc  they had given to the public business She thanke  the commons in particular for their great supplies  and for their readiness in making a provision for th  Prince of Denmark To gratify the Tories and i  adherence to her own principles she declared herse  strongly in favour of the established church Sh  hoped she said that such of her subjects as had th  misfortune to dissent from the church of Englan  should rest secure and satisfied in the act of tolerati  which she was firmly resolved to maintain Th  those who had the advantage and happiness to be  the church should consider that she had been ed  +cated in its principles That she had run great h  +zards for its preservation That she would take pa  +ticular care to maintain and encourage all its privileg  and rights and to transmit them securely to posteri  Having expressed her opinion that further laws we  necessary for restiaining the scandalous licentio  +ness of the press the lord keeper by her comma  prorogued the parliament to the twentysecond  April  Feb    Conduct of the Whigs  The Queen and those who led her councils had some reason to wish for new restrictions on the licence assumed by the writers of pamphlets and periodical papers Though the Whigs on the accession of Anne turned their thoughts more to their own danger from their opponents than the possession of power their hopes of regaining the influence which they had lost gradually arose In the house of commons their opposition had been hitherto languid and feeble The prejudices of those without were therefore to be raised to second efforts that might prove successful within The press was employed with great assiduity by the adherents of the party and a people naturally jealous of their rulers began already to catch the flame The new reign however was still too popular to be shaken by aggravated complaints The terrors of the nation for popery had altogether subsided in their knowledge of the Queen's firm adherence to the protestant religion The war had been carried on with a vigour and a success unknown in the preceding reign and the spirits of mankind being raised by the flourishing aspect of affairs public credit that had languished long was in a great measure restored  Queen favours the Tories  The lowchurch party it ought to be confessed had some reason to wish for a change in the measures of the court with regard to themselves Their conduct towards the Princess of Denmark was neither forgot nor forgiven by Queen Anne and her resentment had joined with her principles in throwing her completely into the hands of the highchurch party The Whigs were in a manner proscribed and debar  ed from office and the power which they still retain  d in the house of lords seemed to demand their being  xcluded from honours On the ninth of March they  ere furnished with a proof that the current of royal  vour was set another way To secure a majority in  e upper house for the party whose interests were  etted by the Queen four of the most vehement Tories were raised to the peerage Finch Gower Granville and Seymour were the persons dignified  pon this occasion with honours Others of the party  already in the house of lords were gratified with higher titles The Marquis of Normanby in parti+cular was created duke of the same name But the title of Duke of Buckinghamshire being afterwards added he is better known by the latter name  March    Secret views  The conduct of the court and the views of the prevailing party in the house of commons was considered by their opponents as proceeding from a design of defeating ultimately the succession of the crown in the family of BrunswickLunenburgh A coincidence of circumstances it is certain had thrown the churchparty in some degree into the scale of the excluded branch of the house of Stuart They concluded that the more violent Whigs were from principle attached to a republican system of government They apprehended that those whom their own ambitious views had joined to that party would either from interest or revenge abet the religious opinions and civil prejudices of the dissenting protestants upon the event of the accession of a foreign Prince to the throne  Besides the attachment to the hereditary descent o  the crown when ingrafted on the first principles o  the church of England had weighed much with thos  who were most zealous for her doctrines The dan+gers and the apprehensions arising from poperty ha  vanished The terrors which had seized the nation  on that head at the revolution were ascribed to th  arts and machinations of the republican party i  which all dissenters were erroneously comprehended  to furnish themselves with an opportunity of rearin  their own favourite fabric of government on the rui  of a disputed throne  Stuartpapers    of the high church party  Men swayed by these opinions were easily induce  to listen to the declared Jacobites and to follow th  instructions of the court of St Germains The la  +ter deemed the church of England thoroughly in the  interest The bill to prevent occasional conformity  and that to grant a year longer to such as had neglec  +ed to take the oath of abjuration were suggested a  abetted by the determined adherents of the pretende  Prince of Wales The first of those bills had failed through the prevalence of the Whigparty in the house of lords and the latter through an amendment of the peers became a further security for the succession which it was intended to defeat Two clauses were added with such art to the bill that the highchurch party durst not oppose them without endangering their influence with the nation and declaring themselves too precipitately for a measure which time only could gradually accomplish To endeavour either directly or indirectly to defeat the succession as now limited by law was declared hightreason and the oath of abjuration a circumstance neglected in the first bill was imposed on the whole Irish nation  Journals of the lords    Applications of the court of St Germains  The court of St Germains derived great hopes from the friendly disposition of the English house of commons But they turned their eyes with most attention to the Duke of Marlborough and the Lord Godolphin The first by possessing the command of the army might have effectually served their cause had his professions been sincere The latter though timid in his councils was a man of abilities and uniformly attached to the excluded branch of the royal family Marlborough whose great influence in the measures of the court was known had made himself a party against the Whigs  Hannoverpapers  by extending in his own department his animadversions to those members of the house of peers who had distinguished themselves in opposing what was deemed detrimental to the eventual succession of the family of Hannover  The E of Rivers to Bulau April  He was therefore pressed by the pretended Prince of Wales through his emissaries to enter into an immediate treaty the terms of which were to leave Queen Anne in possession of the crown during her own life provided she would secure the succession  her brother at her death  Stuartpapers  To effectuate this  ecurity the act of occasionalconformity was not  hought sufficient though the church of England  seemed to conclude that her own safety was involved in the restoration of the hereditary descent of the crown into its former channel  Stuart papers  He therefore proposed that the act of settlement itself should be repealed a thing he thought not impracticable in the present disposition of the parliament  so Marlborough  The servants of the pretended Prince at the same time endeavoured through Marlborough to reconcile the Queen herself to their views by applying to her feelings and proposing various expedients They insinuated that considering the justice and piety of Anne it was not to be supposed that she would obstruct the eventual succession of her brother a measure which they said she owed to her own glory the memory of her father and her solemn engagements to that Prince They affirmed that it was not to be thought she would contribute to exclude her own family in favour of a stranger the most distant relation she had in the world  Ibid  To facilitate therefore the execution of the scheme which they earnestly wished her to adopt they insinuated that the putting her brother in an immediate possession of the crown of Scotland would be the most effectual means for securing to him the eventual succession of the crown of England and that this decisive measure would be attended with little difficulty considering that the majority of parliament in the two kingdoms were apparently well affected to the hereditary succession of the throne  Ibid    A marriage poposed with his daughter  To this extraordinary and perhaps impracticable project destined to be laid before the Queen the agents of the court of St Germains shewed an inclination to confirm Marlborough in the cause of their master by engaging his own ambition His only son the Marquis of Blansord having died at Cambridge on the twentieth of February the Duke had no prospect of transmitting his name to posterity through the male line Of four daughters two were already married the eldest to the son of the Lord Godolphin and the second to the earl of Sunderland Colone  Sackville who had during the late reign carried on the correspondence between Marlborough and the court of St Germains and who had always free access to the Duke proposed a marriage between his third daughter and the pretended Prince of Wales How Marlborough received the proposal is uncertain But the negociation seems not to have ended with the present year The adherents of the family of Hannover either apprised of this projected connexion or willing to gain to their own party the great influence and weight of Marlborough formed a scheme on their side to marry this daughter to the electoral Prince  George II  The highflying Tories and especially the Jacobite part of the ministry were so much alarmed at this circumstance that they even intended to solicit the Queen herself to propose the match between her brother and the Duke's daughter  Stuartpapers  These facts are more decisive with regard to the great power of the Duke himself than proofs of the prudenee of those by whom the proposals were made  Affairs of Scotland  During these secret transactions in England projects for restoring the succession in the hereditary line were carried forward with more openness in Scotland The prejudices of the people in general against the old parliament were inflamed by the Jacobites and the abettors of prelacy who hoped upon a new election to return a majority of their own party into the house It was asserted and even publicly argued that the parliament then in being had never been a regular assembly That it had been called by the Prince of Orange before he was invested with the regal title and that having continued fourteen years  circumstance utterly inconsistent with the constitu  on of Scotland its authority was usurped and all its  eliberations illegal These reasons being propagated  d accommodated to the unsettled humour which pre  iled in the kingdom rendered the people in gene  al loud in their demands for a new parliament The  position of the Court seemed to suit itself to the  esent prejudices of the nation The old ministry  who had been considered in the light of Whigs wer  removed from the active departments of the state Th  Earls of Melvil Marchmont Selkirk Leven an  Hyndford were laid aside The Earl of Seafield  yielding to the temper of the times was made presi+dent of the council The Duke of Queensberry an  the Viscount Tarbat men equally pliant in the dispo+sition of their minds received the seals as secretarie  of state and the Earl of Tullibardin who from favouring the Revolution had become through disgust  a Jacobite was raised to the office of lordprivyseal  Lockhart's Memoirs    A complaisance to the humour of the times and as they supposed to the disposition of the Court rendered the new ministry suspected of an attachment to th  exiled family The Viscount Tarbat in particular who had been all things to all governments ever sinc  the death of Charles the First endeavoured to gai  the affections of the Jacobites by procuring from th  Queen a proclamation of indemnity  March  Before th  members of the new administration were appointed  the old parliament was dissolved and another summon+ed to meet at Edinburgh on the sixth of May Th  vehemence of the people the influence and the weigh  of government the activity of the leaders of the coun+try party and the zeal of the Jacobites procured a return of more members swayed by high principle  for monarchy than had been known in any parliamen  since the Restoration of Charles the second Bu  though the majority were enemies to the late Revolu+tion these came under two denominations to the house  The open and avowed Jacobites were the least dan+gerous as they made no secret of their real design  But the country party as they affected to call them+selves consisting of men of more prudence and mor  spirit covered their designs in favour of the exile  family with the specious pretence of insisting upon th  redress of the grievances under which the nation ha  laboured in the preceding reign  Loc  +hart's Memoirs  The first wer  led by the Earl of Home who had rendered himself beloved by his party from their opinion of his integrity and his uniform attachment to the interest of the excluded family  Character of the Duke of Hamilton  The Duke of Hamilton the acknowledged head of the countryparty was a nobleman of solid as well as popular talents unshaken in his personal courage hitherto steady in his political conduct clear in conception judicious and full of address Though not possessed of a flowing eloquence of language when he spoke in public his expressions were manly and his manner so graceful that his words came with an irresistible force upon his audience He was qualified by nature to gain mankind and to combine together their various passions and views and thus united to turn their whole force at once to one point Attached to his party from principle he adhered to their very prejudices with a firmness that gained their affections and secured their unlimited confidence In forming his projects he was cautious to a degree of irresolution But when he once adopted any scheme he was not to be swayed from his purpose by obstructions nor intimidated by dangers Having served King Charles and King James in various capacities he retained his affection for their family after the misfortunes of the latter and making no secret of his principles de  ined to accept any office from King William and  en for many years to acknowledge his authority When the resentment of the Scots had ascended to a  egree of frenzy against the Crown in the year  accepted upon the resignation of his mother of  title of Duke of Hamilton and having placed  mself at the head of the opposition directed with  at dexterity their whole fury against the King  His instructions from St Germains  The correspondence between the late King James  d the Duke of Hamilton had languished ever since  treaty of Riswick had put an end to all the hopes  hat unfortunate Prince The adherents of his son  wever renewed their intrigues in Scotland as well  in England and being no strangers to Hamilton's  chment to their cause sent him secret instructions  ch he followed implicitly in his public conduct  His secession with eighty members in the preceding year had deprived the parliament of the opinions o  the people and had been the great cause of the disso+lution which soon after followed This circumstanc  had rendered still more important a nobleman whos  weight in his country had been great before Th  pretended Prince of Wales neglected not therefore to point out to the Duke in the month of January the line which he wished to be pursued in the new parliament The principle articles required of Hamilton were to oppose with all the force of his influence abilities and address the bill of abjuration  the succession of the family of Hannover and the union of the two kingdoms  Stuart papers    A new parliament  The Duke in obedience to his instructions and pursuing the bent of his own mind had concerted with his party measures favourable to the excluded family When the parliament met on the sixth of May he presented to the house the draught of a bill for recognizing and asserting the authority of her Majesty and her undoubted right and title to the crown of Scotland The inclination of the English ministry and even the distant views of the Queen herself in favour of her brother were no secret to the Duke who had been for more than ten years privy to their intrigue  and correspondence with the court of St Germain  Without departing therefore from his purpose  proposed this overture which seemed levelled again  his own principles with regard to the hereditary de+scent of the crown The act could not be oppose  with any decency But the old ministry to scree  themselves from the future animadversions of parlia+ment endeavoured to insert a clause that it should  hightreason to impugn or quarrel either the Queen  right to the crown or her exercise of the regal funct  +on since she ascended the throne Though Hamilt  and his party perceived the drift of this amendmen  yet to prevent the appearance of any obstruction  this complimentary act they consented under an e  +press declaration that the clause should not extend  justify the transactions in the late parliament should they be questioned hereafter  Mem of Scotland    Proceedings  The avowed friends of the excluded family shewed the same inclination with those who called themselves the countryparty to please the Queen and to gratify the demands of the Crown The Earl of Home who was known to lead the Jacobites presented the draught of an act on the nineteenth of May for granting a supply Those who affected to adhere to the principles of the late Revolution were unwilling that this compliment to government should come from the opposite side The Duke of Argyle and the Earl of Marchmont professed themselves and were allowed by the world to be the leaders of that party The Duke though a man of abilities and agreeable in his manners was profligate in his private life and regarded chiefly his own interest in his public conduct Though he came over with the Prince of Orange at the Revolution and affected to be a mortal enemy to the family of Stuart he had listened to the proposals of King James through the Earl of Arran in the year when that Prince had a near prospect of being restored to his throne Argyle had been together with the Earl of Home with whom he was connected by marriage agreed to accept of a commission as lieutenantgeneral from the exiled King  Stuartpapers  But the hopes of James being blasted by  he defeat of the French fleet at La Hogue Argyle  ell again into the measures of William obtained from  hat Prince several sums of money and in the year the title of a Duke for his services in a refracto  session of parliament  Burnet vol iii Lockhart's Memoirs    The commissioner deserts the countryparty  Argyle apprized of the Earl of Home's intention  move for a supply had the address not only to  strate the overture but even to detach the com  sioner the Duke of Queensbury from the coun  party in whose views he had actually embarked  came to that nobleman and informed him that he  mself and his party had resolved to move for an act  to ratify the late Revolution and to confirm the presbyterian system of churchgovernment This measure was so contrary to the principles of those who had proposed to grant an immediate supply that the commissioner requested the Duke to forbear The latter refused to comply and dexterously insinuated into the mind of Queensbury such a jealousy of the growing weight of the Duke of Hamilton that he deserted at once his own professions and the interests of the countryparty The Marquis of Tweedale in the mean time made an overture in the house that prior to all other business the parliament should proceed to form conditions of government and regulations in the constitution of the kingdom to take place after the demise of her Majesty  Act of security  The party who endeavoured to defeat the supply opposed it with this overture which was likely to command the whole attention of the house On a debate touching the competition between Tweedale's motion and the consideration of the supply the party who supported the first prevailed The Marquis of Athol in consequence of the overture offered an act for the security of the kingdom in case of her Majesty's decease  May  This important business filled the greatest part of the session with violent debates It was stipulated by the act that on the twentieth day after the Queen's decease the estates of parliament should meet and that in the intermediate time the executive government should devolve on such members of the house as should happen to come to Edinburgh It was provided that no papists should b  members That no Englishman or foreigner enjoy+ing a title in Scotland and not possessed of one thou+sand pounds sterling of yearly rent in that kingdom  should be capable of either sitting or voting in the par+liament to be convened in terms of the act  Its conditions  When the house proceeded to the limitations to b  laid on the successor of the Queen in the throne  violent debate arose A member urging that h  Majesty's letter to the parliament encouraged the  to expect her concurrence in any thing calculated to secure public freedom was answered with a censure by the commissioner The member replied with great asperity and concluded with affirming that nothing could save Scotland from slavery but withdrawing herself after the decease of the Queen from the dominion of an English Prince In an additional clause to the act it was provided that the nomination of a successor was left by the act to the estates of parliament who should assemble after the Queen's death But it was enacted that the successor to be named should not be the successor to the crown of England unless such conditions of government should be settled in this session of parliament as should secure the honour of the kingdom the independence of the crown the freedom frequency and power of parliaments and the religion liberty and trade of the Scotish nation from English or foreign influence  Printed act    Act for the house of Hannover fiercely rejected  While the house were employed in the act of security several laws of considerable importance were passed with less difficulty On the seventh of June the house proceeded to the consideration of an act offered by the Duke of Argyle ratifying the parliament which had continued to sit during the whole of the preceding reign Several laws with regard to commerce were passed and one to encourage the African and India company Toward the end of the session the Earl of Marchmont presented an act to the house for settling the succession on the family of Hannover which was ordered to be read When the clerk came to the paragraph where the Princess Sophia was men  oned by name the house flew at once into a flame  ome moved that the overture should be publicly  urnt Others were for calling Marchmont to the  r Many proposed to send that lord prisoner to the  stle of Edinburgh The chancellor having procured  ence the clerk proceeded But such a fierce oppo  on arose that the overture was rejected without a  te In defeating the motion the house departed  edly from their own rules To place a mark of  indignation as they expressed themselves on the a  it was carried by a majority of fiftyseven voice  that the very memory of it should be expunged from the minutes of parliament  Sept    Royal assent refused to the act of security  The commissioner shewing no inclination to touc  the act of security with the scepter a motion wa  made that the house should address the Queen t  give the royal assent But this intention was over+ruled by a suggestion that the commissioner himsel  should be first questioned whether he had been in+structed to pass the act His Grace observing an ob+stinate silence the house flew into a new flame Se+veral members proposed new bills of limitations Bu  the most insisted that the old act should be carried in+to a law The next day however the commissione  told the house that he had received her Majesty'  pleasure and was now fully impowered to give th  royal assent to every act excepting only to that  called an act for the security of the kingdom H  scarce had ended his speech when many member  arose and in succession inveighed in the bitteres  terms against the servants of the crown who wer  called perhaps with justice the slaves of the Englis  ministry and calumniators of the Scotish parliament  Some denied that the right of a negative was inhe+rent in the crown They affirmed that the third ac  of the first parliament of Charles the Second the on+ly act upon which the negative was founded declared  indeed that the royal assent was necessary to give th  force of a law to a vote of the house But that fro  thence it could not be inferred that the assent coul  be refused to an act passed and solemnly offered by par+liament  Mem of Scotland    Violent heats  During these uncommon heats no supply for th  support of either the civil or military establishmen  had been granted to the crown When the lordtrea+surer represented to the house the defenceless state  the kingdom they reminded him of the security de+nied to the nation by the refusal of the royal assent  an act calculated for that important and necessary pur+pose  No session of parliament ever met in Scotland in which more abilities more eloquence and perhaps more violence and animosity were displayed than in the present The whole nation were interested spectators of a contest which they were taught to believe was to determine their independence as a free people or to subject them for ever to those foreign councils to which they had with some reason ascribed the late misfortunes of the kingdom The eagerness of the populace was transfused into parliament When the commissioner proposed that the supply should take place of all other business the opposition stated the vote  "overture for subsidy or overtures for liberty"  The commissioner still insisting on his point the Earl of Roxburgh arose and said that if there was no other way of supporting the natural and undeniable privilege of parliament the friends of their country were resolved to demand justice with swords in their hands A general rage transported the house into a degree of fury The commissioner became apprehensive of the safety of his own person Having promised that the overtures for liberty should be the first business of the next session and having touched the bills that were ready with the sceptre he suddenly prorogued this refractory parliament  Sept    Observations on the state  Though the zeal of the Jacobite members contributed to increase the flame in the house many not confined to such narrow principles were great promoters of this vehement opposition in parliament They were no strangers to the abject dependence into which their country had fallen ever since their native  vereigns had added the weight of the crown of Eng  nd to their prerogative in Scotland They perceiv  d that the distance of the Prince himself from a  overnment carried on in his name subjected his  uncils to the imposition of the ignorant or the art  d malice of the designing They saw that the ser  nts of the crown by resorting to London were  her gained by the English ministry to forward  eir own views or awed by their influence into a  subserviency which when it degraded themselves disgraced and even ruined their country The sovereig  himself was even likely upon all occasions to prefer the interests of his more powerful kingdom to the prosperity of a country which from the nature of its soil and climate as well as from the peculiar circumstances of its government had hitherto contributed little either to support his grandeur or to increase his power  of Scotland with regard to England  The situation of affairs in England had accidentally furnished Scotland with the only opportunity the latter ever possessed of emancipating herself from the influence and oppression of the former or of being received into an union of government upon equal and even advantageous terms The English legislature had settled the succession of the crown on the house of Hannover King William either careless of the interests of that family or what is more probable indifferent concerning the fate of the crown after his own death had neglected to recommend to a parliament whom a long habit had rendered subservient to his views the settlement of the crown of Scotland in the protestant line This circumstance actually left the fate of England in the disposal of the Scotish nation Should the latter declare for the eventual succession of the Prince of Wales a title then not illegal in Scotland there can scarce any doubt be formed but considering the party which still adhered to the exiled family in England he would have with great facility recovered the crown of that kingdom Some men of abilities in the Scotish parliament who were by no means attached to the hereditary line perceived this advantage and they seized it with an eagerness proportionable to their zeal for their country  Character of  The most distinguished among these lovers of their country was Andrew Fletcher of Salton whose warm but manly genius had been improved by an extensive knowledge of books and of men Possessed of a mind too daring and independent to bear or even to permit the haughtiness of superiors he uniformly wished for that equality among mankind which speculative patriots hope to find in a republican government To  that dignified disposition of soul which abhors whatever is mean he joined a steadiness of mind that no advantage could sway no solicitations move no dangers shake A strict observer of his word devoted to the most rigid laws of honour cautious of giving offence to others as he was resolved to resent even the appearance of insult to himself resolute to a degree of enthusiasm in a manner fiercely brave In his public conduct he was the avowed enemy of all despotism Vehement in his love for his country determined to support her independence as necessary to his own dignity In his private life he avoided vice on account of its meanness He adhered without deviation to virtue as essential to his own pride  Fletcher of Salton  His peculiar opinions on the subject of government suiting ill with the despotic maxims adopted in Scotland during the reign of Charles the Second he opposed the ministry and was persecuted in return To avoid the malice of his enemies he forsook his country But being summoned in his absence before the privycouncil he was so much enraged at the injustice of those in power that he embarked in the cause of the Duke of Monmouth and accompanied that unfortunate nobleman when he invaded England Having been outlawed upon this occasion he retired to Holland and came over with the Prince of Orange whose declarations were favourable to those political principles to which he had invariably adhered He soon perceived what he might have foreseen that the possession of the crown of England was the chief object of the expedition Fletcher therefore left King William when that Prince seemed to desert the principles upon which he came and he afterwards opposed him with  vehemence suitable to that disappointment Having  een chosen a member of the new parliament which  et in the May of the present year he found an op  ortunity for exerting his talents and for exhibiting his  rinciples Though an enemy to monarchy he en  ertained such an aversion to English influence and an  nion that he adhered to the country party and would  ven have supported the succession of the exiled family  rather than yield to measures which he deemed destructive to the honour and independence of his country  Lockhart's Mem    Affairs of Ireland  The affairs of Ireland had for several years remained in that state of tranquillity and want of importance which attends dependent governments when carried forward with any degree of attention and precision The Earl of Rochester whom King William had placed in the office of lordlieutenant resigned his commistion through some disgust soon after the accession of his niece to the throne of England He was succeeded in the government by the Duke of Ormond a name popular in Ireland on account of his family In a parliament which met in the autumn of the present year a great unanimity appeared in favour of the measures of the Queen They granted a supply to her Majesty to make up the deficiency of the revenue and to support the necessary branches of the establishment for two years ending at Michaelmas In examining the public accounts the commons found that more than one hundred thousand pounds had by misrepresentation beer charged unjustly as a debt on the nation and they ordered a committee to examine into the cause of this intended fraud on the public  Proceedings of parliament  In a representation to the lord lieutenant the commons complained with reason of the proceedings o  the trustees appointed by the parliament of England  for managing and selling the forfeited estates in Ireland  that had been resumed for the use of the public  They averred that the charges incurred by the subjects of that kingdom in defending such just right  and titles as had been allowed by the trustees ha  exceeded in value the current cash of Ireland They complained that the state of trade at home was s  low that many protestant families had been constrain+ed to remove to other kingdoms especially to Scot+land while foreign commerce and its returns were under such restrictions as rendered them altogethe  unprofitable They affirmed that many civil officer  were arrived at such a pitch of corruption throug  the hopes of impunity that vast estates were acquired by them in a short time in a poor country That others neglecting their personal attendance in the country made sinecures of their employments and drained the kingdom of its money which they spent in other lands Having insinuated that nothing but frequent parliaments could either prevent or reform those evils they concluded with the warmest and most affectionate wishes for the happiness of her Majesty and the long continuance of her reign over Ireland The lordlieutenant having promised to transmit to England the representation of the commons they voted an ample supply and the parliament was adjourned to the eleventh of January in the succeeding year  Campaign of  During these transactions in Scotland and Ireland the war was carried on with unabating vigour between the allies and the house of Bourbon The former had  ound means to detach from the alliance of the lat  er two Princes of considerable name and power The Duke of Savoy deserting the interests of France  nd Spain had concluded a treaty with the Emperor  n the fifth of January and on the sixteenth of Mlay Peter the Second King of Portugal joined  imself to the grand alliance To the defection of  ose two Princes the French ascribed their subse  ent misfortunes in the war They however made  eat preparations for opening with spirit the cam  aign on all sides Winter itself had scarce suspended  stilities between the contending powers Rhinberg  as taken on the ninth of February by the allies  he siege of Traerbach was raised on the twenty  th by the Mareschal de Tallard The French  der Villars seized the towns of Offenbourg and  stadt without resistance That commander forced  redoubts upon the Quinche and took the fort of  ll on the ninth of March The Elector of Ba  a the firm ally of France carried on the war  vigour in the heart of Germany He took  bourg on the Danube on the third of February  defeated the enemy at Passaw on the eleventh of  March and having taken Burglenfield  March  and Ra+tisbon  April  was joined on the twelfth of April a  Dutlingen by the Mareschal de Villars  Progress of the Elector of Bavaria  The French and Bavarians owed their success o  the side of Germany more to the inactivity of th  empire than either to their own force or thei  conduct The instances of England and the State  were lost on that unwieldy body Each Prince deemed himself but little concerned in what was the cause of all The Elector of Bavaria taking advantage of their supineness resolved to enter Tyrol at once to open the communication with the French army in Italy and to stop the common passage of the Imperial reinforcements to their troops in that country The Duke de Vendôme who commanded the French forces in Italy endeavoured on his side to enter Tyrol to join the Elector Had this project succeeded it might have ruined the Emperor's affairs But the valour of the peasants of Tyrol the conduct of some Imperial detachments placed in that country and the want of concert between the French and Bavarians defeated the only measure which seemed calculated to support the affairs of the house of Bourbon on that side  Operations in Swabia and Italy  The Duke de Vendôme having despaired of joining the Bavarians and being recalled to Italy by the open defection of the Duke of Savoy with unbridled fury laid waste the country in his retreat The Elector on the other hand found himself obliged to abardon Inspruck and to retire to Swabia to rejoin the Mareschal de Villars Disappointed in their views on Ausbourg they crossed the Danube at Donawaen and totally defeated at Hochstet Count Styrum  Sept N S  who commanded a considerable army of the allies In Italy the Imperial troops were commanded by Staremberg Prince Eugene having not been employed for the present year This general had contributed to prevent the junction of Vendôme and the Elector of Bavaria but he performed no other service of importance during the campaign Vendôme disarmed  part of the troops of the Duke of Savoy on the twentyninth of September He defeated the General Visconti on the twentysixth of October Nothing decisive however happened on the side of Italy though the house of Bourbon might consider their disappointment in the intended junction of their armies in Tyrol in the light of a partial defeat  On the Rhine  The Duke of Burgundy having under him the Mareschals de Tallard and de Vauban commanded the French army on the side of Alsace A campaign which during the greatest part remained unimportant ended in an action of some consequence and renown The Mareschal de Tallard having formed the siege of Landau that place began to be pressed when an army of the allies passed the Rhine at Spire for its relief Tallard leaving a flight guard in the trenches marched with the rest of the army to attack the enemy The allies consisting of English Dutch and Germans were commanded by the Prince of Hesse the same who mounted afterwards the throne of Sweden The French general who from the badness of his sight was obliged to depend upon the eyes of others committed a mistake which by a singular piece of good fortune gained the battle Construing a motion made by the enemy for an attack to be a preparation for flight he fell upon them unexpectedly and obtained the victory The Count de Frize who had defended Landau with vigour and good conduct despairing of any further relief surren  ered that important fortress the day after this un  ortunate battle was lost by the allies  Nov    Campaign in Flanders  In the Netherlands the Duke of Marlborough  ing concerted measures with the States of the  nited Provinces was enabled to appear early in the  eld He opened the campaign with the siege of  onn a strong city in the circle of the LowerRhine  d the usual residence of the Elector of Cologn  hat Prince had placed Bonn with the rest of his  ominions in the hands of France in the beginning  the war The city was invested on the twenty  rth of April The trenches were opened on the  third of May and the Marquis d'Alegre after  gallant resistance was forced to surrender the place  after a siege of twelve days The French army un+der the Mareschals de Villerol and de Boufflers hav+ing in the mean time advanced toward Maestre  and taken Tongeren the Duke of Marlborough re+joined the consederate army in Flanders and advance  against the enemy The French declining battle retired within their lines which the Duke resolves to force The Baron de Sparr performed this service with spirit and success But the Baron Opdam wh  attempted to penetrate the lines at Antwerp wa  driven from the field with great loss and forced  retreat to Lillo with an inconsiderable party of the army under his command The General Schlangenburg retrieved in some measure the laurels which Opdam had lost  June  Both the French and the allies claimed the advantage in an attack productive of  consequences The French seem to have had the  title to the honour of victors having kept possessio  of the field  Several places taken by the allies  The French unwilling to hazard the event of a general battle with the allies who were superior in conduct as well as in force the Duke of Marlborough sat down with little interruption before some place  of considerable strength and by their conque  closed with reputation the campaign Huy on the Maese fell into his hands on the twentysixth of Ju  He took Limbourg in September In December the city of Gueldres after a bombardment and blockade of near fourteen months surrendered to the allies  Dec  The number of fortified places whi  the possession of Spanish Flanders had given to  French had proved a considerable disadvantage  their assairs The garrisons in so many towns ha  weakened their armies in the field Besides  places themselves were ill provided with the means  defence Having most of them fallen in the la  wars into the hands of the French they had be  returned in a kind of dismantled state to the Spani+ards whose poverty as well as negligence prevente  them from being ever thoroughly restored to their former strength They furnished therefore the allies with a succession of triumphs and by buoying up their minds with an appearance of success encouraged them to continue the war with vigour  Campaign in general favourable for France  The campaign of the year was upon the whole favourable to the house of Bourbon The progress of the Elector of Bavaria in the heart of Germany had reduced the family of Austria into great straits while at the same time an insurrection in Hungary distracted their councils and spread devastation to the gates of Vienna In Italy the defection of the Duke of Savoy had not hitherto produced any fortunate change for the Emperor and on the Upper Rhine the arms of that Prince were attended with a degree of misfortune Though the French had lost some towns in Flanders the progress made by the allies was inconsiderable They failed in their attempts on the strong lines formed by the enemy for the protection of Flanders and in the only action of consequence which happened on that side they had lost some trophies as well as the field Though the bigotry of Lewis the Fourteenth had kndled the flames of war in the heart of his own dominions by forcing by severities the Protestants in the Cevennes into an insurrection no effectual advantage was taken of a circumstance which the allies might have greatly improved in their own favour  Affairs at sea  Nothing memorable happened at sea during the  ummer of the present year The combined fleet of  ngland and Holland under Sir Cloudsley Shovel  ed  July  into the Mediterranean and returned with  t meeting an enemy to their own ports  Oct  In  me actions of little consequence and less name the  rench seem to have had the advantage The Eng  sh were repulsed at Guadaloupe in May  May    ooke endeavoured in vain to make a descent on  elleIsle on the sixth of June  June  A Dutch convoy was attacked by the French to the north of Scotland  on the tenth of August  Aug N S  The ships of war esco  +ing the fleet were beaten and some of the vesse  themselves taken An unaccountable langour see  to have prevailed in all the operations of the maritim  powers They formed no expedition to annoy th  enemy on the coast of Spain though naked and de+fenceless and in neglecting to intercept the treasur  brought by a French squadron from the Havan  they furnished the enemy with additional resources fo  continuing with vigour the war  Sept Arch Duke declared King of Spain  The partial and inconsiderable advantages obtaine  by France at sea and the success of her arms in con+junction with the Bavarians in the heart of Germany  neither raised her own hopes nor depressed her ene+mies The defection of the Duke of Savoy and  above all the desertion of the King of Portugal who could open through his country a passage into Spain filled the house of Bourbon with great and wellgrounded apprehensions The gaining from the enemy such powerful allies induced the Emperor to avow to the world his design to recover to his family the possession of the crown of Spain Having therefore together with his eldest son the King of the Romans renounced every personal title to the Catholic throne his second son the ArchDuke Charles was crowned at Vienna the beginning of September A few days  Sept  after this ceremony was performed the ArchDuke now called Charles the Third King of Spain left Vienna and directing his journey through Holland arrived at the Hague on the third of November Having been acknowledged in his new capacity by all the allies he was received every where with marks of the highest respect and honour The desig  of this Prince was to pass to Portugal with a considera+ble force escorted by the combined fleets of the ma+ritime powers and in conjunction with his new ally  Peter the Second to invade the kingdom of Spain  Disgrace in the West Indies  The operations of the English fleet in the We  Indies were attended neither with glory nor wi  success Admiral Bembow who commanded t  ships stationed at Jamaica and in the neighbouri  seas fell in with a French squadron near Carthagena on the nineteenth of August In a running battle which was renewed at intervals for several days the admiral was repeatedly deserted by his captains his ship disabled and his own leg shot away The enemy though much inferior in number and strength made by these means a safe retreat Bembow after this disgraceful as well as unfortunate action returned to Jamaica On the sixth of October he issued a commission for the trial of captain Kirby and captain Wade They were found guilty of cowardice breach of orders and neglect of duty and being sent to England under their sentence they suffered death at Plymouth on the fourteenth of April The admiral himself having languished for some time under the wound received in the engagement died at Jamaica and the regret which he expressed in his last moments for the treachery of the condemned captains seemed to have ensured their unhappy fate  War in Poland  During these transactions between the confederates and the house of Bourbon the war in Poland was carried on with redoubled ardour The King of Sweden having quitted the neighbourhood of Cracow descended with his army along the course of the Vistula King Augustus employed himself in calling together fruitless diets  n an assembly of his adherents at Thorn it was resolved  o acquaint the King of Sweden that Poland had ac  epted the mediation of the Emperor and that should Charles still persist in refusing to enter into a negociation  he Republic should declare war against Sweden But  hat one pretended diet established was overturned by  other and Charles seemed to have more adherents in  land than Augustus himself The first of these  nces preferred action to negociation Having suddenly  rched out of his camp he surprised the Saxons at  tausck and took their general with his own hand  laid siege to Thorn and forced that city notwith  nding its numerous garrison to surrender at discretion  g Augustus was obliged to find in strangers the re  ces which his own kingdom denied He applied for  to the Czar who listened the more readily to the  citations of Augustus that he hoped to fix the seat of  the war in Poland and to profit by the absence of Charles by aggrandizing himself in Livonia  Hist du Nord tom ii    Parliament meets Nov  While the new King of Spain remained at the Hague concerting his future measures with the States the parliament of England after various prorogations met at Westminster  Nov  The Queen in her speech communicated to the two houses her new treaties with Portugal and the Duke of Savoy and she desired supplies to answer the demands of her present as well as former engagements in the war She informed her parliament that though no particular provision had been made for the charge either of the expedition intended for Portugal or the augmentation of the troops desired by the States the funds granted had answered so well and the produce of the prizes had proved so considerable that no new debt had been incurred on these accounts by the nation She recommended dispatch in their deliberations as necessary for the success of the projected enterprizes of the war She expressed her most earnest desire of seeing all her subjects in perfect peace and union among themselves and she therefore intreated them all to avoid any heats and divisions that might disappoint her of the satisfaction she had promised herself from their unanimity and give encouragement to the common enemies of the church and state  J  +nals Nov    The commons grant  A kind of hereditary animosity against the French together with an opinion imbibed by the people that th  house of Bourbon aimed at the empire of all Europ  had rendered the present war extremely popular in Eng+land Though the last campaign in Flanders had p  +duced no striking event the advantages obtained by th  allies were with some reason ascribed to the valour  the English troops and especially to the skill and cond  of their leader In such a situation of affairs the qua  +rels between parties were forced to give way to the c  +rent of the populace and however willing those exclu  +ed from office might have been to obstruct the measu  of government they prudently avoided opposition on  subject of the supply Having unanimously addre  her Majesty upon her speech the commons proceeded  make the necessary provision for the service of the succeeding year The treaties concluded since the recess of parliament and the estimates of the army and navy being laid before them they voted that forty thousand men including five thousand marines should be employed for the sea service of  Journals Nov  and that four pounds a man each month allowing thirteen for the year should be granted for the support of that force  Nov    unanimously ample supplies  To prosecute the war with vigour by land the house resolved that eight hundred and eightyfour thousand pounds should be granted to her Majesty for maintaining forty thousand men to act on the continent in conjunction with the allies They at the same time provided for the Queen's proportion  l  of the subsidies for part of that force  Nov  and gave her a further supply  l  for maintaining the additional ten thousand men which her Majesty had raised at the requisition of the States  Nov  They provided  l  also for eight thousand men to act in conjunction with the forces of the crown of Portugal and they resolved that a sum not exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand pounds should be granted for defraying her Majesty's proportion of thirteen thousand men to be maintained by the court of Lisbon Three hundred and fiftyseven thousand pounds were granted for guards garrisons and invalids near one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for the landservice to be performed by the office of ordnance  Nov  The house presented and address to the Queen assuring her Majesty that they would make good all her engagements with the Duke of Savoy  A dreadful tempest  During these transactions in parliament an uncommon calamity fell upon the kingdom In the night of the twentysixth of November the most violent tempest ever known in England suddenly arose The wind blowing from the SouthWest with incredible force and noise was accompanied with flashes of lightning and de  ges of rain Every thing seemed to be levelled before  he storm Chimneys roofs of houses even buildings  nd spires were blown down in the city of London In  the country whole forests were torn up by the roots But the tempest fell with most fury and did the most harm at sea  Besides the loss sustained by private persons sixteen ships of the royal navy were cast away The damage done in London and Westminster alone was estimated at a million sterling But as the calamity was not universal the country suffered not in the same proportion The commons addressed her Majesty upon the occasion They told her that they could not see a diminution of her navy without making provision for repairing the same They therefore desired the Queen to build such capital ships as she should think fit and they promised at their next meeting to make good the expence  New King of Spain in England  The storm which had done such damage in England  was felt with the same severity in Holland The dykes having been broken down in Friezeland by the violence of the waves one fourth part of that province was laid under water A squadron of men of war under Admiral Calemberg destined for the expedition with the new King of Spain to Portugal was driven from the mouth of the Texel to the coast of Norway Of the English ships intended for that service and lying in the Maese some were stranded and others lost The damage however was in some measure repaired in the space o  three weeks and on the twentythird of December Charles the Third embarked for England escorted by the English and Dutch squadrons That Prince arriving at Spithead on the twentysixth of December was conducted by the Duke of Somerset to Windsor where h  Majesty received him with great magnificence Having remained at that place two days he repaired again t  Portsmouth and sailed from Spithead on the fifth of Ja+nuary with a favourable wind But a storm arising i  the Bay of Biscay the fleet was dispersed and drive  back to the channel Sir George Rooke the admiral o  board of whose ship was the King of Spain returned  St Helen's on the twentieth of January Great dil  +gence and activity were used in refitting the ships B  it was the twelfth of February before a favourable win  enabled the fleet to make the best of its way to Portuga  Bill against occasional conformity  The unanimity in parliament with regard to supp  for prosecuting the war was disturbed by the renewal  a former quarrel between the Whigs and the Torie  The latter favouring the church introduced again into the house of commons the bill against occasional conformity which had been lost in the preceding session This measure had been neither unforeseen nor unexpected by their opponents and it threw the house into violent debates The highchurch party however prevailed The bill soon passed the commons and was sent to the lords The Whigs still maintained in the upperhouse a majority They were at least more powerful there through their superior activity and zeal The Queen herself notwithstanding her predilection for the church of England was cold with regard to a bill that seemed so highly favourable to the established religion She had been terrified with reports that the Jacobites connected their views in favour of her brother with the success of this bill and there certainly existed some reason for this apprehension The ministry during the dependence of the bill were left to their own opinions Marlborough and Godolphin who were too prudent not to appear attached to the protestant succession voted for the bill Other lords in office gave their suffrages on the other side The bishops themselves were almost equally divided upon the votes and the bill was at length rejected by a majority of thirteen voices  Journals of the lords    A Scotisl plot  The bill against occasional conformity was not the only topic upon which the Whigs endeavoured in this session to depress the Tories During the warm debates on that subject a circumstance arose that greatly contributed to the victory which the former party obtained The Queen acquainted the two houses on the seventeenth of December    that she had received unquestionable informations of designs carried on against her government in Scotland by the agents and emissaries of France The two houses received differently this intelligence The lords led by some Whigs of ability and eagerness grasped at every thing calculated to raise the jealousy of the nation against the Tories The majority of the commons being composed of the latter party considered the whole as the stale contrivance of a shamplot an expedient they affirmed often used with success by  their political antagonists Writers infected with the partialities of the two parties have given various and opposite accounts of an affair too frivolous to command the attention of the public had not the minds of mankind been previously inslamed by the animosities subsisting between two powerful factions  Character of Simon Fraser  The principal actor in this political piece and perhaps its author was Captain Simon Fraser afterwards well known to the world by the title of Lord Lovat Born with insinuating talents but rather forward than agreeable in his address he exerted his whole force upon mankind through the channel of their vanity His flattery though too obvious to escape even the observation of the weak was too strong to be resisted entirely by men of sense He seemed so eager in bestowing praise that those who approved the least of his manner ascribed his adulation to his want of judgment with regard to others more than to his own designs Destitute of principle and despising veracity as useless he accommodated all his actions to his immediate interest and all his words to the purpose of deceiving the credulous into his views Habituated through time to this abandoned conduct he became in a manner incapable of deviating from it and thus his profligacy by being generally known carried its own antidote in itself In the execution of his own projects though generally formed with little judgment he was bold and fearless He neither understood those laid by others nor pursued then  either with spirit or with attention Though unsteady in his disposition and hourly varying his schemes he never swerved from the great line of selfinterest and thus notwithstanding his natural levity and inconstancy  he succeeded by perseverance  His crimes  Some actions that brought upon Fraser the highest ani+madversion of the laws in Scotland had made him famou  in that kingdom before his intrigues attracted the notice  the parliament of England Being descended though a  some distance from the family of the Lord Lovat chi  of the clan of Frasers in the county of Inverness he ha  received in the year the commission of a lieutena  in the Earl of Tullibardin's regiment by the recomme  +dation of his relation who was married to the sister  that nobleman He however soon lost the preferme  which he had obtained through some seditious letters which he wrote and had fallen into the hands of the earl Retiring to the Highlands he lived for some time with his father at Beaufort a farm which they had obtained for a subsistence from the Lord Lovat That nobleman dying in the year left four daughters Thomas Fraser of Beaufort and his son Simon collecting some disorderly persons attempted to seize the estate as nearest male heirs Terrified however by a prosecution at law they formally renounced their claims But in the month of September Simon Fraser entered with an armed force the house of the widow of the Lord Lovat seized her person ordered the marriage ceremony to be pronounced in the midst of the sound of a bagpipe with which he endeavoured to drown the lady's cries and having stript her naked by cutting off her stays with his dagger forced her to bed and consummated the pretended marriage amidst the noise and riot of his desperate attendants  Trial of Fraser Account of Scotch plot Lockhart's Mem    He is pardoned by King William  Pursued with some troops by the lady's father the Marquis of Athol Fraser was forced to abandon the kingdom The council of Scotland and the court of justiciary before whom he was prosecuted declared him a rebel fugitive and outlaw offering a reward to any that should seize his person He fled to France and applied to the court of St Germains for subsistence But the late King James offended at his profligacy and having heard of his crimes would neither receive his advances nor admit him into his presence  Lockhart's Mem Stuartpapers  Despairing of success with the abdicated family he resolved to assume the merit of betraying their councils to the reigning Prince In consideration of present or promised services he obtained through the means of the noted Carstares one of King William's chaplains and a kind of favourite a pardon of his rebellion and other public crimes The rape upon the widow of the Lord Lovat not being mentioned in the pardon Fraser was prosecuted for that crime by the lady and her friends He was forced again to retire to France in the year but not perhaps without instructions for his conduct in that kingdom from Mr  Carstares and men of great rank of the same party The Duke of Argyle in particular was his patron and friend from an hereditary feud between his family and that of Athol which last on account of the rape were the enemies of Fraser  Flies again to France  The Earl of Middleton who then possessed the most credit at St Germains had adopted the bad opinion entertained by the late King James of the character of Fraser The latter therefore applied to Queen Mary through Sir John Maclean and as that unfortunate Princess grasped at every vain hope held forth to her son she treated Fraser with kindness and recommended him to the Pope's nuncio  Stuartpapers  Having gained the confidence of that prelate by reconciling himself to the church of Rome he was introduced by him to the Marquis de Torcy as a person that promised to be serviceable to the views of the court of France Lewis the Fourteenth himself is said to have had an interview with Fraser But either distrusting his incredible promises with regard to an insurrection in Scotland or unwilling to hazard either his men or money without further security he made him a present of five hundred Louis d'Ors and desired him to return to his own country to bring credentials from those persons over whom he pretended to have so much power But as the King could not altogether rely upon the credentials procured by such an unknown adventurer he first resolved to send along with him a Frenchman The sending of a Frenchman to Scotland lying under insuperable objections Lewis found himself obliged to apply to the court of St Germains for a suitable person a native of that kingdom  Returns and is made use of by Queensberry  The request of the French King were commands to the Earl of Middleton He received Fraser with a degree of confidence and gave him as a credential to the friends of the exiled family a commission as colonel from his young master  Ibid  The indemnity granted in Scotland by Queen Anne in the March of rendered it safe for any of the adherents of the court of St Germains to return to that kingdom An officer of the name of Murray under the protection of the indemnity was sent as a check upon Fraser and to bring back intelligence  of the state of opinions and disposition of parties in Scotland Fraser attended by this gentleman arrived in London He directed his course to Scotland and was met on the borders of that kingdom by the Duke of Argyle He was from thence conducted by that nobleman to the Duke of Queensberry who held as commissioner a parliament at Edinburgh The commissioner having deserted the Jacobite faction in the house to whom he had vowed fidelity perceived that by their joining with the country party they possessed the power as well as the inclination of being revenged He therefore grasped with eagerness at the informations which Fraser either from vanity or malice gave against his enemies He knew that even to fix a suspicion of a correspondence with France upon the leaders of opposition would not only ruin their credit with government but destroy their influence with the nation To enable Fraser to execute his instructions with facility and freedom he granted him a pass to secure him from being seized in obedience to the letters of fire and sword which had been issued against him on account of the rape  Lockhart's Mem    Goes over to France to procure proofe  Fraser finding such a powerful support in Queensberry resolved in serving his patron to gratify his own revenge Having received from the exiled Queen a letter without an address for the Duke of Gordon he transmitted a copy of it to that nobleman and retained the original in his own possession as intended for his great enemy the Duke of Athol  Stuartpapers  The commissioner having conceived an aversion to the Lord Tarbat lately created Earl of Cromarty Fraser dexterously contrived to ascribe the declaration of indemnity obtained in the preceding year from Queen Anne to his lordship's correspondence with the court of St Germains The Duke of Hamilton's principles were already known But no accusation of consequence could be carried home to him on the present occasion Fraser in the mean time was permitted  roam through the Highlands to endeavour to extort  omises from the chiefs to rise in arms for the pretended Prince of Wales His success was not equal either to his  romises or the expectations of his patron When the  parliament of Scotland was adjourned on the sixteenth of September he repaired to London and his allegations not amounting to a sufficient proof he was provided with money and a pass under a borrowed name by the Duke of Queensberry who applied for that purpose to the Earl of Nottingham secretary of state With the pass he transported himself safely to Holland and from thence found means to convey himself again to Paris His design was to procure such letters to Queensberry's enemies and his own as might hurt their reputation with the world if not destroy their persons and ruin their fortunes  Lockhart's Mem Journals of the lords Stuartpa+pers    and is thrown into the Bastille  Having arrived at Paris in the beginning of January he presented a memorial to the exiled Queen containing a long account of his own proceedings in Britain in favour of the pretensions of her son  Stuartpapers  Though he connected his detail with those persons of rank of the opposite party with whom he had conversed it bore fiction so apparently on its face that Middleton who always doubted the honesty of Fraser was convinced of the imposture He amused him however with cold but polite letters while at the same time he wrote to the Marquis de Torcy expressing his doubts concerning his fidelity and signifying his wishes that he might be secured Captain James Murray who had been sent to Scotland to discover the truth of Fraser's interest and connections in that kingdom returned in the mean time to St Germains The accounts which he gave of the state of the country and operations of Fraser were so diametrically opposite to that presented by the latter to the exiled Queen that no doubts remained of his treachery Repeated intelligence from England of the discoveries made by the parliament and privy council strengthened the proof to such a degree that Fraser after having amused Middleton with a series of letters concerning his own importance his influence in Scotland and his loyalty to the excluded family was thrown at length into the Bastille  Ibid    by Fergu  on  The vanity of Fraser his incontinence of language  and a desire of raising his own consequence with his no+ble employer the Duke of Queensberry by spreadin  far and wide the bottom of his plot had betrayed him into mistakes which prevented the execution of his designs Having when he returned to London opened his projects in favour of the pretended Prince of Wales to the famous Ferguson a more experienced plotter the latter perceiving his character suspected his integrity Understanding at the same time from Fraser himself that he was often in conference with the ministry of Scotland and having seen the pass which he had obtained from the Earl of Nottingham through the influence of the Duke of Queensberry he wrote his suspicions to the Duke of Athol one of the noblemen accused The Duke conscious that he had never corresponded nor received either message or letter from the court of St Germains  Stuartpapers  complained openly to the Queen of the conduct of Queensberry and his partizans in protecting an outlaw who was hatching the most pernicious designs Queensberry to vindicate himself declared that he had protected Fraser in Scotland upon his promising to make great discoveries and that he had procured for him a pass for transporting himself to procure solid proofs of his own vague assertions He insinuated at the same time that had not the matter come so soon to light he doubted not but he should meet with success and to strengthen his opinion he delivered to Queen Anne as for the Duke of Athol the letter intended by the exiled Queen for the Duke of Gordon  Proceedings upon it in parliament  The Scotch plot had arrived at this state when it fell under the cognizance of the house of lords A committee was immediately appointed by ballot for the examination of papers and witnesses and the choice fell on the leaders of the Whigparty The house of commons  omposed chiefly of Tories found an opportunity of op  osing their weight against the proceedings of the peers  ome suspected persons and among others Sir John Maclean having being seized upon their arrival from France on the coast of England the lords by their  wn authority ordered them to be brought before them  be examined The commons addressed the Queen in  vour of the prerogative of the Crown and complained  at the lords in violation of the known laws of the land  had wrested the prisoners out of her Majesty's hands and in a most extraordinary manner taken the examination which belonged to the Queen and council solely to themselves The plot from this moment became obviously a topic of animosity and dispute between the Whigs and Tories But the heats between the parties were not sufficient to keep long depending this matter especially on an evidence which could carry home no wellgrounded charge of treason to any particular person The curiosity and fears of the nation were soon dissipated and the whole affair sunk into the oblivion which it deserved  Journals of both houses    Disputes between the houses occasion a prorogation  The difference between the houses concerning the examination of the plot was heightened by a dispute of another kind One Ashby had commenced an action against White mayor of Ailesbury for refusing to admit his vote in the election of members to serve for that borough in parliament The cause was carried by appeal before the house of peers where judgment was given in favour of Ashby The interference of the lords in matters of election threw the commons already offended into a violent flame They asserted their exclusive right to the sole cognizance of all matters concerning elections and their votes were answered by counter resolutions of the lords To put an end to disputes which seemed daily to increase through the inveterate animosity between the parties the Queen closed the session on the third of April with a speech from the throne Having thanked the commons for their large supplies she recommended that unanimity between the house which had been lost in their disputes as nothing could so much contribute to the success of the nation abroad and their safety and happiness at home  Journals April    CHAP VI  State of partiesTories dismissedCampaign of Attack at DonawertBattle of BlenheimIts great consequencesCampaign in Flanders and

houses of parliament being considered as a quarrel of partie  had raised a ferment among their adherents throughout the kingdom The Whigs having prevailed in the house of lords had carried the highest praises of that assembly to the press mixed with the grossest invectives on the commons who favoured the  principles of their political opponents The contest for the possession of power which had ever been the principle motive for the violences on both sides was managed as usual upon topics calculated to engage the minds of the people The Whigs averred that religion was in danger from a fixed design of the Tories to defeat the protestant succession The Tories on their part affirmed that the Whigs extended their views to the subversion of monarchy itself and the ruin of the church of England A credulous multitude were thus tossed between the vicissitudes of hopes and fears in proportion as either party found means to accommodate their own allegations to the principles or prejudices of the vulgar  The Earl of Nottingham  Some changes made in the ministry after the prorogation of parliament rendered the highchurch party dissatisfied without gaining the confidence of the Whigs The Earl of Nottingham a man of vehement principles with regard to the high prerogatives of the crown and an implicit faith in the church was removed from the office of secretary of state

either in church or state  Macky's character  His attachment to the church had rendered him averse to the measures of King James while that Prince sat on the throne But his zeal for the indefeasible rights of monarchy induced him afterwards to favour the views of his family He opposed the abjuration of the Prince of Wales with such vehemence that he is said to have shed tears when the bill passed But he was too prudent of perhaps too timid to risque like many others possessed of the same principles any direct correspondence with the excluded family  Stuartpapers    and several Tories dismisted  The resignation of Nottingham was attended by the removal of other adherents of the highchurch from some departments of importance The Earl of Jersey a man  who with a very ordinary understanding had passed through several of the greatest offices in the kingdom was deprived of the staff of lord chamberlain which the Earl of Kent was said to have purchased with money from the influence of the Duchess of Marlborough with the Queen  Publications of the times  Sir Edward Seymour who through the course of a long life had in a manner avowed his attachment to the excluded family but had complied with the times was dismissed from the office of comptroller of the Queen's household Blaithwaite who had enjoyed for many years the place of secretary at war was removed more perhaps from the conveniency of having his office to bestow upon another than for any exceptions against either his own principles or conduct Men who judged superficially of things looked upon these changes as the consequences of an alteration of system in the cabinet and ascribed to their own mistaken opinion concerning the principles of the lordtreasurer what had actually proceeded from his prudence  Harley and others advanced  Notwithstanding the chearfulness with which the commons granted the supplies for the war and their firm adherence to Tory principles the lordtreasurer and the Duke of Marlborough perceived from the complexion of the house of lords in the last session of parliament that a powerful opposition to government was to be apprehended from the Whigs They persuaded therefore the Queen that it was necessary either to sway or break the party by bringing into office some of its reputed members  Hannoverpapers  Harley then speaker of the house of commons though he had uniformly opposed the measures of King William was deemed in principles a Whig from his being bred a dissenter He however was supposed too prudent to sacrifice his own interest to the views of party and as his talents for managing business in the house of commons were known and acknowledged he became a great object of acquisition to the Lord Godolphin Harley therefore was first sworn in at the councilboard and soon after appointed secretary of state in the room of the Earl of Nottingham The office of comptrollergeneral was bestowed on Mr Mansel his friend  and his recommendation placed  Hannoverpapers  at the same time Mr St John afterwards Lord Viscount Bolingbroke in the place of secretary at war vacant by the removal of Mr Blaithwaite  Campaign of  This expedient however would have been found insufficient against the intended opposition of the Whigs  Ibid  had not the singular success of the campaign imposed silence upon those who had prepared themselves for blaming the treasurer and for accusing the Duke of Marlborough The latter having in the beginning of the year visited Holland and concerted the operations of the campaign with the States had returned to England before the prorogation of parliament To carry into execution the plan which he had formed and weighed he embarked at Harwich on the nineteenth of April The success of the two last campaigns having rendered the allies masters of the Maese and Spanish Guelderland such a strong barrier had been formed on the side of Flanders that a small number of forces were deemed sufficient to protect the frontiers of the States against the efforts of the enemy Marlborough having found means to convince the Dutch of their security in that quarter proposed to march into the heart of Germany to protect the Emperor now almost threatened with the siege of his capital by the joint force of the French and Bavarians  Marlborough marches  The threatened march of the Elector at the head of the combined army into the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria was not however the only thing that alarmed the Emperor and continued his fears The insurgents in Hungary encouraged by France had possessed themselves of several important places and offered their aid to the enemy Leopold unable to repress their insolence was forced to shut his eyes on their rebellion  Hist de l'Empire d'Allemagne tom vii  He applied as his last resort to the Queen of England through Count Wratislaw his envoyextraordinary at the court of London This minister presented on the second of April a memorial to Queen Anne containing an affecting state of the distressed condition of his master's affairs The resolution for relieving  the Emperor by carrying the war into Bavaria which had been previously taken was hastened by this requisition The Duke of Marlborough having settled affairs with the States left the Hague on the fifth of May under the pretence of a design to carry the war to the banks of the Moselle and by that river to penetrate into France while every thing had been prepared for the real expedition to Bavaria and the Danube  into Germany  Having passed through Utrecht to Ruremond and from the latter place to Maestricht Marlborough as he advanced ordered the British and other troops to join and march towards Coblentz at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle D'Auverquerque destined to command the army left for the defence of the Dutch frontiers met the Duke at Maestricht and his Grace advancing through Juliers arrived in the camp near Coblentz on the twentyfifth of May C  ossing the Rhine at that place and successively the Maine and the Neckar he was met at Mondelsheim by Prince Eugene of Savoy To join the army under the duke to the Imperial troops led by the Prince of Baden was the result of a consultation between these distinguished commanders Prince Eugene having hastened to Philipsburg to take upon himself the command of the army on the UpperRhine the duke advanced toward the Danube and joined the Imperialists at Westerstetten and having arrived on the river Brentz on the twentyeighth of June he placed his camp within two leagues of the Elector of Bavaria's army The troops of the allies consisted of ninetysix battalions of foot and two hundred and two squadrons of horse and dragoons provided with fortyfour pieces of field cannon four howitzers and twentyfour pontons The force of the enemy was inferior in point of numbers consisting only of eightyeight battalions of foot and one hundred and sixty squadrons of horse But they had ninety pieces of cannon forty mortars and howitzers and thirty pontons  Returns of the armies    Attack at Donawert  The generals of the allies having in a council of war resolved to attack Donawert on the Danube forced the enemies intrenchments before the place with the loss  of five thousand men on each side This action happened on the second of July and the next day Donawert was deserted by the Bavarians and thus the allies obtained by their victory a bridge over the river while they separated from one another the troops of the enemy stationed on the Upper and Lower Danube The position gained by the allies was not however sufficient to enable them to penetrate into Bavaria  Hist de France tom iii  without removing themselves too far from Nuremberg and Nortlingen from whence they drew their supplies To avoid a battle with regard to the Elector of Bavaria and the French was ultimately to force the allies to retire back to the Maine But the Elector having been reinforced with a fresh army under the command of the Mareschal de Tallard resolved after a short negociation into which he had entered to amuse the allies to abandon his own fate and that of his country to the event of a battle The opposing armies after the junction of Tallard with the Bavarians were equal in number consisting each of eighty thousand combatants  Mem du Marq Feuquiere p    Situation of the armies  Though the allies had passed without resistance the Danube they were incapable for want of magazines either to continue long on the banks of that river or to penetrate into Bavaria They wished therefore with the utmost eagerness to give battle and they watched for that purpose every motion of the enemy that might furnish them with the advantage which they so much desired The evil destiny of France the ignorance and haughtiness of her generals the Mareschals Tallard and Marsin together with the vehemence of the Elector himself offered at length the opportunity which the enemy sought after in vain Prince Eugene having marched with twenty thousand men from the Rhine to observe Tallard on his march through the Black forest had now joined the Duke of Marlborough Having pre+vailed with the Prince of Baden to besiege Ingoldstad  they rid themselves of the councils of that general an  resolved to give immediate battle to the enemy whic  the latter relying upon the strength of their positio  shewed no inclination to decline  Battle of Blenheim August  The French and Bavarians lay encamped with the Danube on their right The village of Blenheim on the bank of that river stood a little advanced in the front of the right wing of their line Their left was covered with an extensive thick wood from which ran a rivulet along their front into the Danube This rivulet as it passed through the plain formed an almost continued morass which would have been very difficult to pass had not the French and Bavarians by a negligence fatal to themselves formed their line at a considerable distance behind When the Elector and the mareschals perceived that the enemy who were encamped with their left to the Danube and their right extending to the wood were resolved to give them battle they threw twentyeight battalions and eight squadrons of dragoons into the village of Blenheim Eight battalions were at the same time placed in another village toward the center with a design in conjunction with those at Blenheim to fall upon the rear of the enemy when they should pass the brook and so place them between two fires Such was the situation of the French on the morning of the thirteenth of August Their wretched disposition insured the loss of the battle Their line consisting chiefly of cavalry formed at the head of their camp was weakened by these large detachments whilst the enemy were permitted to pass the morass formed by the rivulet without any resistance  Mem du Marq de Feuquiere Kane's campaigns    The French and Bavarians routed  The Duke of Marlborough who commanded the left of the allies having formed his line after passing the brook ordered the two villages to be attacked by the infantry while he himself led his cavalry against those of Tallard After several charges with various success the courage of the French horse began at length to abate They retired behind the fire of ten bartalions that had advanced while the cavalry were engaged These sustained the charge for a considerable time against the English foot But the duke in the mean time having charged home with his horse the French cavalry already wavering drove them in their flight into the Danube and most of those who had escaped the sword were drowned in that river The ten battalions  of the enemy's foot were at the same time charged on all sides and cut to pieces Prince Eugene who commanded on the right had attacked the Elector of Bavaria and the Mareschal de Marsin The Prince however could make no impression on their line But when they perceived that Tallard was defeated they threw themselves into three columns and quitted the field with great dexterity and expedition Had they now fallen on the flank of Marlborough whose troops were employed in pillaging the camp of Tallard the victory might have been recovered or at least the troops stationed in the two villages might have been saved Those at Aberclaw found means to escape in the confusion But the twentyeight battalions of foot and twelve squadrons of horse in Bleinheim surrendered at discretion to the allies  Consequences of the battle  The battle of Blenheim which seemed to decide the fate of Germany turned the whole scale of the war against the house of Bourbon The loss of the French and Bavarians in killed drowned wounded deserters and prisoners amounted to near one half of their army The Mareschal de Tallard himself was among the prisoners The camp equipage baggage and artillery of the enemy fell into the hands of the conquerors together with every other trophy attending on a complete victory The battle however was not unbloody on the side of the allies Fourteen thousand men were either killed or wounded and among the slain several officers of high merit and rank The troops under Prince Eugene meeting with the greatest resistance suffered the most The Elector and the Mareschal de Marsin though they scarce could be said to have been routed retired with every mark of a defeat under the cover of night to Ulm They remained in that cite only one day and having directed their rout through the Black forest joined the Mareschal de Villeroi on the Rhine  of Bleinheim  No modern victory was ever more complete than tha  obtained by the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim an  none could have more sudden or more important conse+quences The conquests and dominions of the Electo  of Bavaria fell at once into the hands of the Empero  who revenged severely upon that Prince's subjects th  excesses which had been committed by the enemy on his own An extent of seventy leagues of country which had fallen into the hands of the victors felt all the miseries and ravages attending upon conquest The French ruined broken and dispersed left a free and uninterrupted march to the confederates from the Danube to the Rhine The remains of an army that at the beginning of the year extended terror to the gates of Vienna were now forced to take shelter within the limits of France The victors crossed the Rhine They entered Alsace and the important fortresses of Landau and Trearbach fell into their hands before the end of the campaign  Hist de France tom iii Siecle de Louis xiv    Campaign in Flanders and Portugal  The campaign in Flanders being merely defensive on both sides produced no event either brilliant or important Auverquerque who commanded the allies on the frontiers of the States bombarded Namur without effect in the month of July The same good fortune which had attended the arms of the confederates on the Danube was not general on every side of the war The Archduke Charles who had taken the title of King of Spain had landed at Lisbon on the ninth of March with eight thousand English and Dutch forces Philip the Fifth strengthened with an army of twenty thousand French carried the war into Portugal early in the spring Several places and particularly Portalegre fell into his hands and in various slight rencounters in the field he defeated the Portugueze Disputes between the King of Portugal and the Duke of Schomberg who commanded the English and Dutch auxiliaries forced the Queen to recall that nobleman who was succeeded by the Earl of Galloway through the intrigues of Mr Methuen the English ambassador at the court of Lisbon The King of Portugal and the Archduke having in vain attempted to cross the river Angueda and invade Castille were forced to retreat from the presence of the Duke of Berwick into the heart of Portugal where they distributed their troops in winter quarters  Hist de Portugal tom ii    Campaign in Italy  On the side of Italy the Duke of Modena having espoused the cause of the Emperor was deprived of his  whole dominions by the French under the command of Vendôme The Duke of Mirandola who joined himself to the interests of France experienced the like misfortune from the arms of the Imperialists The Duke of Mantua perceiving that his dominions were become the theatre of war endeavoured by marriage to gain the favour of France The campaign in Italy proved upon the whole favourable for the house of Bourbon The castle of  June  Suza and the city of Pignerol were taken in June Vercelli surrendered in July  July  The city the citadel and the castle of Yvrea fell into the hands of Vendôme in the month of September No action of any note happened in the field The Emperor having employed his chief force in the defence of his hereditary dominions in Germany found himself in no capacity to reinforce his troops in the duchy of Mantua The French therefore took place after place with little resistance and closed the campaign by the taking of Sensano on the twentyfifth of November  braltar taken  The taking of Gibraltar by the English and an undecisive battle between the French and the confederates near Malaga rendered distinguished the naval operations of the present year The combined fleet that had carried the Archduke to Lisbon having quitted that port presented themselves before Barcelona where a party had entered into a secret agreement with the allies to place that city in their hands The plot was discovered and disappointed by the viceroy of the province but he durst neither seize nor punish the conspirators The fleet quitting the coast of Catalonia appeared before Cadiz which city had been placed in a posture of defence by the vigilance of the governor Fortune conducted the allies thence to Gibraltar which was illprovided and feebly desended The inhabitants terrified at the vivacity and courage of the English sailors surrendered the place on the first attack and Sir George Rooke who commanded in the expedition fortified Gibraltar in the name and under the dominion of the Queen of England  Naval Hist His  d'Espagne    Undecisive fight off Malaga  The taking of this important fortress had at once an effect on the war in Spain and introduced another important event Part of the army employed in Portugal being withdrawn from that kingdom for the purpose of retaking Gibraltar stopt the progress of Philip the Fifth The French fleet to the number of fiftytwo ships coming to the aid of the besiegers under the conduct of the Comte de Toulouse was met on the twentyfourth of August about twelve leagues from Malaga by Sir George Rooke and the Dutch admiral Calemberg with an equal force An obstinate battle ensued to which the night put at length an end Both sides claimed the victory and both deserved it had success depended on valour Though no ships were sunk or lost the fleets were so much disabled that neither shewed any inclination to renew the fight the succeeding day Willing to get clear of each other they gradually made their retreat The French unable to give aid to the Spaniards before Gibraltar made the most use of the wind to carry them to their ports while the fleet of the allies having left a squadron on the coast of Spain directed their course to England  Naval Hist    Affairs in the Cevennes and Hungary  The want of success on the side of Savoy prevented the allies from sending as they intended succours to the insurgents in the Cevennes The court of France sensible of the disadvantage of domestic disturbances while they were pressed by a powerful and victorious enemy on their frontiers resolved with lenity to overcome men whose obstinacy had hitherto defeated all the efforts of their arms The Mareschal de Villars was accordingly sent to treat with the leaders of the insurgents He agreed in the name of the King to grant them the free liberty of their own worship  Hist de France tom iii  But the fire was rather covered than extinguished  Burnet vol iv  The impolitic conduct of the court of Vienna still continued the troubles in Hungary The expulsion of the Elector of Bavaria and the reduction of his dominions had so much depressed the malecontents that they were ready to submit upon any reasonable terms But the fierce and severe policy of the house of Austria rejected all accommodation  except a total submission with men whom they accounted the worst of rebels The insurgents collecting spirit from despair and privately encouraged by France spread their ravages far and wide and though they were defeated in various skirmishes Hungary was likely to continue for some time a scene of misfortunes and blood  Hist d Allemagne tom vii    and in Poland  This year remarkable for great events produced a Revolution in Poland The cardinalprimate long in the interest of the King of Sweden assembled a diet at Warsaw and the throne was declared vacant on the fourteenth of February King Augustus having issued manifestos in vain resolved to support himself with the sword He assembled his adherents in Poland He called his allies the Russians to his aid The King of Sweden in the mean time pressed the Poles to elect a new Sovereign Stanislaus Leczinski Palatine of Posnania was accordingly raised to the throne on the twelfth of July The war was continued with vigour The Saxons were defeated on the sixth of August They were again routed on the nineteenth But notwithstanding these misfortunes King Augustus found means to surprise Warsaw on the fifth of September and either to disperse or seize the adherents of his rival He however was driven again from that capital in the end of October and forced to take refuge in his hereditary dominions which he almost ruined by immense preparations for renewing with vigour the war for the recovery of the kingdom he had lost  Hist de Pologne tm ii    A  eneral joy  The great victory obtained by the allies at Blenheim being chiefly and very justly ascribed to the valour of the British troops and the conduct and address of their leader the Duke of Marlborough a general joy was diffused over the nation on account of that splendid event The Queen appointed a day of thanksgiving for this signal advantage and with a pomp not unsuitable to the pardonable vanity of her sex went in procession to St Paul's  Sept  The Duke himself besides the great reputation which he had obtained abroad from his success derived from it a solid advantage at home On the success  of his expedition his political importance was known to depend The party excluded from office had in a manner openly declared that they would attack him in parliament and it must be confessed that notwithstanding his great actions he was not free from faults which his enemies might have seized with advantage The torrent of his glory however came with such rapidity and strength on their designs that they were levelled and in a moment ruined While foreign princes vied with one another to honour him abroad he became at home the darling of a people fond of military fame  Secret intrigues of Marlborough  The Whigs despairing of any success from an opposition to Marlborough seem at this time to have formed designs of inducing him to embark in their own cause They had long observed that neither the Duke nor the lordtreasurer had ever yet even in appearance renounced the pretensions of the Prince of Wales Their object therefore was to gain the Duke to the Protestant succession by a marriage between his daughter and the electoral Prince But this with other schemes of the like kind were dropt as difficult and uncertain  Sir Rowland Gwynne's letters  The truth is that though Marlborough and Godolphin had not lately appeared warm in the cause of the excluded family they still maintained a secret connection and encouraged private interviews with the agents of the court of St Germains  Stuartpapers  The Duke though perhaps not so sincere in his professions as the treasurer was less guarded in his conduct In the month of April when he was preparing to break the power of the French in Germany he regretted the absence of his nephew the Duke of Berwick in Portugal as he ought to be nearer Britain to take advantage of such events as might arise in favour of the exiled Prince He gave at the same time the most solemn assurances of his unalterable fidelity and attachment to the excluded family and directed their agents to apply to the Lord Godolphin upon any emergency that might arise during his own absence in the campaign  Stuartpapers April    Affairs of Scotland  During the important operations of the campaign abroad some transactions in Scotland engaged a part of  the attention of the nation at home The countryparty inflamed at what they deemed an indignity the interference of the English house of lords with a plot supposed to have existed in Scotland joined themselves more closely with that party whose almost avowed intentions were to serve the interests of the excluded family The Queen in compliance with her promise to the house of peers made no secret of her design to propose to the parliament of Scotland the settlement of the crown of that kingdom on the house of Hannover To pave the way for this important business some changes were made in the administration The Duke of Queensberry who had rendered himself obnoxious by his patronage of Frarer and the plot was dismissed to soften the popular party from his place of secretary of state and the Marqurs of Tweedale a man of more honesty than abilities succeeded him in the office of lordhighcommissioner to the parliament  Intrigues of parties  Prior to the meeting of that assembly the different factions used every art to strengthen themselves by gaining their opponents The Duke of Hamilton considered as the head of the Jacobites associated himself with the countryparty and sent a deputation of their number to London to oppose the designs and influence of his mortal enemy the Duke of Queensberry The persons chosen for this kind of embassy were the Earls of Rothes and Roxburgh together with Baillie of Jerviswood men less attached to the principles of their party than to their own private interest Having arrived at London and joined their efforts with the Duke of Athol the accomplished the dismission of Queensberry But contrary to the intention of their confederates the Jacobites they promised in return to the English ministry to support in parliament the succession of the house of Hannover The Duke of Hamilton and his party though not ignorant of the designs of their agents resolved to pursue with undeviating perseverance their own They affected to appear ignorant of the agreement made between the members of the deputation and the court of England while at the same time they gained the adherents o  the Duke of Queensberry to a resolution of opposing th  succession by agreeing that no examination of the plot should be made in parliament  Lockhart's Memoirs    Proceedings of Parliament  In this state of affairs the parliament met at Edinburgh on the sixth of July The Queen recommended in her letter unanimity of councils and the settlement of the succession in the Protestant line and demanded an immediate supply for maintaining the civil and military establishments of the kingdom The commissioner the chancellor and the Earl of Cromarty now sole secretary of state supported as usual the demands of the Queen in a succession of formal speeches Their eloquence produced so little effect on the house that they scarce had finished when a motion was made  "That the house without naming a successor should stand by and defend her Majesty's person and government But that the house should agree on such conditions and limitations to take effect after the Queen's death as should effectually defend Scotland against all English influence"  The house adjourning without debate on the motion the Duke of Hamilton made an overture on the thirteenth of July that the parliament should not proceed to name a successor to the crown until the Scots should conclude a treaty with England in relation to commerce and other important concerns When a motion was made for resuming the consideration of the overture  July  Mr Fletcher of Salton laid in a pathetic manner before the house the miseries and hardships which the Scots had suffered since the union of the two crowns and the impossibility of mending their condition without preventing the continuance of the same  Menoirs of Scotland    Act of security receives the royal assent  The eagerness with which these motions were received convinced the courtparty that the project for settling the succession was ill timed To allay the ferment which had prevailed in the nation ever since the Queen refused her assent to the act of security her English ministers had advised her to gratify the Scots upon that subject Besides the opposition had resolved that till the act of security should receive the royal assent no supply should be granted An act in substance the same with that which had passed the house the preceding year was read  for the first time on the twentyfifth of July and on the fifth of August it was touched with the scepter Though the Duke of Hamilton was in close correspondence with the court of St Germains some of the adherents of the excluded family had formed a suspicion of his having views of his own on the crown The act of security they said chiefly carried by his zeal and industry contained a clause which pointed out the Duke himself for the throne of Scotland A provision was made that the successor should be a Protestant and of the royal line of Scotland but that the person appointed should not be at the same time successor to the crown of England Next the family of Hannover who were in a manner excluded by the clause the Duke of Hamilton himself was the nearest Protestant of the royal line being lineally descended by a daughter from the first branch of the house of Stuart who reigned in Scotland  Parliament prorogued  Though the adherents of the excluded family had gained to their own cause the votes of the adherents of the Duke of Queensberry with a promise that the plot which had made so much noise in England in the preceding year should not be discussed in parliament it was brought into debate by the Lord Belhaven  August  In a digression from the subject of his speech his Lordship gave a full account of the proceedings in the English house of peers concerning that supposed conspiracy This circumstance induced Mr Fletcher of Salton to present a resolve to the house which he desired might be read and voted The purport of this overture was that the English house of lords by their examination of the plot and by addressing the Queen in relation to a successor to the crown of Scotland had unduely interfered with the concerns of Scotlmen and had encroached upon the honour sovereignty and independency of the nation This motion was opposed with great warmth by the court party and even by many who had hitherto been considered as members of the country party The thing itself was however too popular not to pass The carrying of this resolution and another for addressing the Queen for laying before the house the evidence and papers relating to  the plot finished the business of the session which was closed by a prorogation on the twentyseventh of August  Proceedings of the Scot parl    Reflections  The refractory disposition of the parliament of Scotland alarmed the favourers of the protestant succession in England Though the minister the Lord Godolphin was by no means of that number the natural timidity of his disposition rendered him in some measure averse from a conduct which he secretly approved He perceived that things could not long remain in their present unsettled condition and to prevent a crisis of affairs which he had not courage to encounter he deserted his principles There is no reason to believe that he privately encouraged the malecontents in Scotland to reject the proposal for settling the crown in the house of Hannover But he had not yet opened that scene of corruption which afterwards quieted the turbulence of the Scots and which was perhaps necessary for the peace and safety of the two kingdoms The Duke of Hamilton who knew the principles of Godolphin expressed his own fears of his want of courage  Stuartpapers  He supposed before the parliament of Scotland met that many of the members were to be gained with money by the lordtreasurer of England and to meet him in the line of corruption he demanded a large sum  l  from France for the purpose of purchasing votes  Stuartpapers    Secret negociations and  Though the Duke of Hamilton was unjustly accused in Fraser's plot as being privy to a descent from France in the preceding summer he had in the present year seriously advised that measure should matters come to a rupture between the parliament of Scotland and the English ministry He sent a message to the court of St Germains recommending that a force should be held ready on the coast for an emergency He assured the exiled family that their party in Scotland in conjunction with those who adhered to the independence of their country were resolved rather than submit to the succession of the house of Hannover to throw every thing into confusion and leave the decision of the contest to the sword He gave it as his opinion that five thousand men would be  sufficient to reestablish the excluded line on the throne of Scotland and eventually to raise them to the sovereignty of England But before any descent should be attempted he desired to be informed concerning the views and promises of the adherents of the excluded Prince in the latter kingdom as the force necessary for a successful invasion ought to be greater or smaller in proportion to the quality and number of his English friends The Marquis of Montrose the Earls of Errol Marshal Breadalbin and Panmure the Viscount Stormont the Lord Balmarino the deprived bishops and many of the chiefs of the highland clans expressed the same inclinations and adhered to the same sentiments with the Duke of Hamilton  Stuart papers    intrigues of the exiled family  The victory obtained in parliament over the proposals of the English ministry and the condescension of the Queen in giving the royal assent to the act of security prevented that rupture for which Hamilton signified his inclination to be prepared The ministers of the excluded Prince were however either incapable or unwilling to obtain from the court of France an armament for the invasion of Scotland and they made therefore their application for a descent in England On the twentysecond of June a memorial for that purpose was presented to the Marquisses de Torcy and de Chamillart They signified to those ministers that an attempt on England would be less impracticable and more decisive than to carry the war into Scotland though the majority in that kingdom were in the interest of the exiled family They averred with reason that the possession of England would insure the submission of Ireland and Scotland and that the former was now destitute of troops or only left under the protection of a few guards and some new levies dispersed over the face of the country They re+presented that the month of March was the most pro+per time for a descent before the supplies were levied o  the fleet armed They concluded with affirming tha  nothing then should remain to oppose their master but  weak Princess a timid minister and a mercenary gene+ral who would make a merit of fulfilling their forme  promises to ensure their own interest and safety  Ibid    Parliament of England meets  During the ideal projects formed between the court of St Germains and their adherents in Scotland the parliament of England met at Westminster on the twentyfourth of October The Queen having expatiated on the great and remarkable success of the campaign informed her parliament that she assured herself they were all disposed to provide for every thing necessary to prosecute with vigour and effect the war She insinuated that nothing was more obvious than that a timely improvement of the present advantages would enable them to procure a lasting foundation of security for England and a firm support for the liberty of Europe To accomplish these desireable ends she demanded a supply from the commons She told them that she believed they would find some charges necessary in the succeeding year which were not mentioned in the last and that some extraordinary expences had been incurred for which no provision had been made Having assured the two houses of her confidence in their affection and her own unalterable love for her people she earnestly recommended such unanimity temper and prudence in their proceedings as might contribute to render her kingdom flourishing and herself happy  Journals Oct    They grant liberal supplies  The commons as far as the Queen and the public service were concerned were sufficiently unanimous expeditious and zealous The demanded supplies were granted without hesitation  Nov  They provided amply for the sea  Nov  and land services  Nov  They supplied former deficiencies  Nov  They guarded against them for the future They granted to her Majesty beside forty thousand pounds as a subsidy to the Duke of Savoy  Nov  three hundred and seventy thousand pounds as her proportion of the subsidies payable to her other allies for the year  Ibid  They were as expeditious in finding the ways and means as they were liberal in furnishing the supplies The whole business was carried forward with such harmony cheerfulness and facility that on the ninth of December all the moneybills received the royal assent The general joy which had diffused itself through their constituents seemed to have communicated  itself to the commons But the spirit of dissension was rather suspended than extinguished  State of parties  The lordtreasurerer though a Tory himself and even a Jacobite had permitted a caution which his enemies called timidity to supersede his principles in the arrangement made in the departments of government at the close of the last session of parliament To trim between the two great parties who divided between them the nation he had placed moderate Whigs in places possessed by violent Tories He had the misfortune to lose the latter and not to gain the former The possession of power under the specious name of a difference in opinion had long been the motive of contest between these factions and their mutual animosities had ascended to a height that disdained a divided authority in the kingdom The trimming Whigs admitted by Godolphin into office had promised to manage both parties by playing their prejudices against one another This conduct to make it succeed required the utmost dexterity and address Though the parties were so poized that the weight of government could give to either side at pleasure the victory their contests especially in their present inflamed state were certain of embarrassing if not capable of entirely obstructing the public business  Bill against occasional conformity  Deserted friends became frequently through pride the fiercest enemies The Tories though as much offended with Marlborough as with Godolphin resolved to attack only the latter as the high reputation obtained by the former had rendered him an object too great to be assailed The bill against occasional conformity which had been twice lost before in the house of lords was again introduced by the church party into the house of commons  Nov  To embarrass the ministry and to distress the Whigs who abetted the dissenters a motion was made for tacking the bill to the landtax bill The house of lords having no power to alter any moneybill but either to pass it entire or reject the whole that assembly would either have been obliged to agree to the bill or to put an end to the war which depended on the supplies The ministry especially secretary Harley himself a dissenter procured by his own address and the weight of government a majority in the lower house  against the motion  Nov  The bill however was passed by the commons without being tacked But again it was thrown out by the lords This new disappointment increased the animosity of the Tories against the Lord Godolphin as they ascribed their defeat in a favourite project to the weight which he had thrown into the hands of the opposite party  Conduct of parties  The two parties during the remainder of this session of parliament seemed to have made an exchange of principles could a judgment of their private views be formed from their public conduct When the act of security which had been passed in Scotland in the preceding summer came to be debated in the parliament of England the Whigs and Tories complained against it with equal warmth The first endeavoured to derive advantage from a circumstance so favourable to their avowed principles The latter pretended from the like motives to guard against its consequences The Tories in their arguments in the house of commons urged that the passing the act of security tended to defeat the succession in the house of Hannover But when this proposition was reduced into a motion it was rejected by the Whigs though they had professed themselves the only friends of the descent of the crown in the protestant line The two parties however agreed that some vigorous efforts must be taken in England to obviate the dangers arising from the proceedings in Scotland The violent on both sides were however wellpleased at bottom with measures which seemed equally calculated to promote their respective views The republican part of the Whigs looked upon the act of security as highly favourable to their own principles and the warm Jacobites among the Tories considered the exclusion of the house of Hannover as a great step towards the restoration of the excluded branch of the family of Stuart  Proceedings of parliament  The house of lords were the first who entered into  ebate on the means of obviating the inconveniences  hich were likely to arise from the acts passed in the  receding summer in Scotland They resolved on the  venth of December that no Scotsmen not residing in  ngland and Ireland should enjoy the privileges of Englishmen  until an union should be made or the succession settled as in England That the bringing in of cattle from Scotland should be prevented That her Majesty's ships should be ordered to seize such Scotish ships as they should find trading with France and that the exportation of English wool into Scotland should be carefully hindered  Journals of the lords  The house having approved of these resolutions ordered the judges to reduce them into bills An act for appointing commissioners for treating with the Scots concerning an entire union was read a third time on the twentieth of December and sent down to the commons for their concurrence The lords a few days before had addressed her Majesty to put the town of Newcastle in a state of defence to secure the port of Tinmouth and to repair Carlisle and Hull They also requested the Queen to order the militia of the four northern counties to be disciplined and armed and that a competent number of regular troops should be stationed on the borders towards Scotland and in the northern parts of Ireland  Ibid Dec    concerning the Scotish act of security  The bill formed by the lords upon their own resolutions was rejected by the commons under the pretence of its being a moneybill on account of the fines appointed to be levied on offenders They however framed a bill to the same purpose and having passed it on the third of February sent it to the lords who returned it four days after without any amendment Though the commons found themselves under a kind of necessity to pass a bill expressive of their jealousy of the Scotish act of security they proceeded with manifes  coldness in the whole business  Be net vol iv  The more violen  Whigs and the most zealous Tories joined as has bee  already observed in opinion that the unsettled state o  the succession in Scotland might favour their respectiv  views in England Upon this footing the bill sent dow  from the lords was rejected in hopes of provoking th  upperhouse into a resentment which might defeat th  whole affair The lords aware of the design of th  commons disappointed them by passing the bill withou  amendments and even almost without debate  Arrival of the Duke of Marlborough  The unanimity between the two houses which was apparently forced on the subject of the Scotish act of security assumed an appearance of being sincere in their acknowledgment of the important services of the Duke of Marlborough That general having in the beginning of November ordered the English troops to embark on the Rhine for Holland directed his own course to Berlin the residence of the King of Prussia Having in the space of four days concluded a treaty with that Prince by which he engaged to send eight thousand men to the aid of the Duke of Savoy the Duke quitted Berlin and arrived at the court of Hannover on the twentieth of November On the second of December he arrived at the Hague Having concerte  the operations of the next campaign with the States he embarked in the Maese and accompanied by the Mareschal de Tallard and twentysix other prisoners of note arrived in the Thames on the fourteenth of December He was the same day received at St James's by the Queen with every mark of favour cordiality and respect  Life of Marlborough    He is thanked and rewarded  The duke having next day come to the house of peers was congratulated upon his great services in the name of the lords by the lordkeeper Sir Nathan Wright The commons at the same time ordered a committee of their body to wait upon him with their thanks for the success of his late negociations in the cabinet as well as for his victories in the field  Dec  They followed these expressions of respect with more solid marks of their favour    Having appointed a day for considering the services of the Duke of Marlborough they addressed her Majesty to find means to perpesuate their memory  Jan    The Queen accordingly acquainted the commons by a message that she intended to grant to the duke and his heirs the interest of the crown in the honour and manor of Woodstock and hundred of Wooton and she desired the assistance of the house in clearing  om incumberance the lieutenancy and rangership of the  arks with the rents and profits of the manor and hun  eds which had been already given away for two lives A bill was immediately brought in in consequence of her  Majesty's message and notwithstanding the number of the duke's enemies in both houses it passed into a law without opposition  His intrigues with the court of St Germains  While the Duke of Marlborough was thus publicly gratified by the two parties and favoured by the Whigs he continued to make secret professions and protestations of zeal for the interests of the excluded family A few days after his arrival from Holland he invited himself to supper with the Duchess of Tyrconnel who happened to be then in London Her attachment to the court of St Germains and her knowledge of the duke's connexions with the servants of the Prince of Wales encouraged her to remind him of his former promises and to suggest her expectations from his future services He answered her in general terms But when she urged him to agree on particulars he solemnly assured her that without descending to circumstances or fixing the time he would do every thing which honour and justice demanded at his hands  Stuartpapers Jan  The Lord Godolphin himself though proscribed by the Tories as affecting the principles and views of the Whigs notwithstanding his natural caution had it seems at the same time given a proof of the continuance of his zeal for the excluded family by insinuating to their agents that he would search for an opportunity to pay a part at least of the arrears of the jointure due to the exiled Queen  Ibid    Yet favours the Whīgs  Notwithstanding this appearance of their favouring secretly the views of the excluded family Marlborough and Godolphin in their public conduct seemed willing to break with the Tories who were deemed the enemies of the succession in the protestant line Though Sir George Rooke had acquired so much reputation by the taking of Gibraltar and in the battle near Malaga he was dismissed from the command of the fleet in the beginning of this year  Jan  on account of his own high church principles and the support which his party gav  to his actions in opposition to those of the Duke o  Marlborough in the preceding campaign Sir Cloudsle  Shovel a man of mean birth but a good seamen a  attached to the Whigs was raised into the place vaca  by the dismission of Rooke This circumstance tog  +ther  with other mortifications arising from the obvious partiality shewn by the minister to the Whigs raised the resentment of the Tories who formed a majority of the commons and contributed to a renewal of the former differences which subsisted between the two houses of parliament  Case of the men of Aylesbury  An object of division presented itself to the commons in a matter in which their own privileges as they maintained were very essentially concerned Five inhabitants of the borough of Aylesbury brought their actions against William White the mayor of that corporation for having refused to receive their votes in the election of members to serve in parliament The commons ordered these men to be committed to Newgate for a breach of privilege But the prisoners brought their  habeas corpus  into the court of Queen's Bench and provided themselves with council who pleaded upon various grounds that they ought to be discharged The lord chiefjustice Holt who presided on the bench was of the same opinion declaring that neither house of parliament nor both jointly without the concurrence of the sovereign have any power or right to dispose of the liberty or the property of the subject He affirmed admitting that the commons possessed a right of punishing persons with imprisonment for a breach of privilege that commencing of a suit was no breach of that kind that a just cause of action grounded on the common law could not be construed into a contempt without subjecting the rights of the  eople and the common course of justice between man  nd man to the caprice of a body who might chuse to  ubstitute the resolutions of one branch of the legislature  the place of regulations formed by the united consent of  he whole  Resolutions of the lords  The three other judges on the bench differing from the  hiefjustice in opinion the prisoners were remanded to  ewgate Two of these however refusing to acquiesce  the judgment petitioned for a writ of error to bring  e matter before the lords The commons having ad  essed the Queen not to grant the writ voted that all  ose that were either concerned in managing the writs of  beas corpus  or in procuring the writ of error were dis  rbers of the public peace and enemies of the privileges  the commons of England They ordered the four  counsellors who had pleaded for the men of Aylesbury at the bar of the Queen's bench to be taken into custody They sent their serjeant at arms at midnight with every circumstance of severity and terror to remove the prisoners from Newgate The house of lords proceeding in the mean time on the petition for the writs of error came to several important resolutions They voted that neither house of parliament had any power to create new privileges inconsistent with the known laws and customs of parliament That every subject of England who thinks himself injured has a right to seek redress by an action at law and that the house of commons in committing the men of Aylesbury had entrenched on the constitution of the kingdom by pretending to give to their own declaration the force of an established law  Printed Case    March Counterresolutions of the commons  To these resolutions against the commons the lords added others declaratory of the general rights of the people They resolved that every Englishman who is imprisoned by any authority whatsoever has a right to apply for and obtain his  habeas corpus  and that the commons in encroaching by their ammadversions on that undoubted right had made a breach on the statutes provided for the liberty of the subject The lords followed these resolutions with two writs of  habeas corpus  returnable before the lordkeeper in behalf of the two council for the men of Aylesbury who had been taken into custody by the serjeant at arms by express orders from the common  The lower house having voted counterresolutions agains  those of the peers commanded the serjeant at arms un+der a promise of being supported and protected to mak  no return nor yield any obedience to the writs and they  at the same time acquainted the lordkeeper that the wri  themselves should be superseded as contrary to law an  the privilege of the commons of England  Journals March  Th  flame increasing on both sides with great fury the Quee  was advised to put an end to a session that promised n  +thing but turbulence altercation and noise She accord+ingly came to the house of lords on the fourteenth  March and by an immediate prorogation put an effec+tual end to the dispute  A session of parliament in Ireland  During these contests in England the parliament of Ireland met at Dublin  Feb  The affairs of that kingdom having suffered no material change since the preceding year the session furnished no transaction of great importance On the fifth of March the commons in a committee of the whole house voted a supply of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds to her Majesty for the support of the establishment for two years commencing at Michaelmas and ending at the same term in the year A bill introduced for the improvement of the hempen and flaxen manufactures of the kingdom raised a flame which a prorogation only could extinguish A clause in the bill having ascertained the tithes of flax and hemp the lower house of convocation of the clergy of Ireland presented a memorial signed by the prolocutor requesting the commons that a clause so detrimental to their interest should not pass till their reasons against it should be heard The commons ordered the person who brought the memorial to be committed for a breach of privilege They voted that the convocation by pretending to have any care of the civil rights of the clergy were guilty of a contempt of the house They at the same time signified their expectation that the convocation should make submission and acknowledge their error That assembly adhering to their memorial the commons ordered that all matters concerning it should be erazed from the journals and books of the convocation upon which the lordlieutenant to put an end to the dispute sent a message to both houses commanding them to adjourn  March  to the first of May  The treasurer intimidated  The parliament of England was scarce prorogued when a material change happened in the higher departments of the state The natural timidity of the Lord Godolphin at perpetual variance with his inclinations in favour of the excluded branch of the royal family produced contradictions and inconsistencies in his conduct that were unaccountable at the time as his motives were unknown The Duke of Marlborough in his conferences with the agents of the court of St Germains had insinuated  in the name of the treasurer as well as in his own that effectual measures should be taken in the preceding summer to prevent the settlement of the crown upon the house of Hannover from passing into a law in Scotland  Stuartpapers April  When therefore the Queen recommended to the Scotish parliament to settle the succession in the Protestant line it was suspected with reason that her REVEALED WILL as the Earl of Cromarty expressed himself in his speech in the house was very different from the SECRET INCLINATIONS of her English minister This circumstance induced many who were in the service of the Crown to join the countryparty in the vote which rejected the proposal of settling the succession on the family of Hannover  Proceedings of parl    Joins the Whigs  The active leaders of the Whigparty in England having turned their whole attention towards the means of possessing themselves of power kept a watchful eye on Godolphin They were no strangers to his character and they were resolved to work upon his fears The Lord Wharton in particular knowing that nothing calculated to intimidate would be lost on Godolphin said upon passing the act of security in Scotland that he  "had now the treasurer's head in a bag"  The expression was coarse but it had all its weight with the minister The Lord Haversham represented to him his danger in a set speech in the house of lords To save himself from their resentment he made great advances to the party during the session and when it was closed in the middle of March he performed his engagements by admitting some into office and opening to others a prospect of preferment The Duke of Newcastle though during the late reign secretly in the interest of the excluded family and in correspondence with the court of St Germains  Stuartpapers  was considered by the nation as one of the principal leaders of the Whigs and as such he was raised  March  to the office of lordprivyseal vacant by the dismission of the Duke of Buckingham who was known to adhere to the principles of the Tories Some other changes of less importance convinced the latter that the current of preferment ran in a channel very different from their own  Parliament dissolved  The Whigs now favoured by the Court were soon after furnished with an opportunity of securing to themselves effectually the advantage which they had extorted from Godolphin's fears The present parliament in consequence of the triennial act being near expiring the Queen to preserve the ancient prerogatives of the Crown chose to dissolve it by proclamation on the fifth of April The Tumult clamour and confusion that commonly attend general elections were now raised to an unusual height by the contests and animosities between the parties The Whigs more active than their antagonists applied themselves to the prejudices of the vulgar They had the art to render the Tories odious where the returns depended on the humours of the populace and having the countenance of Government together with the moneyed interest on their side they were enabled to awe the timid and to gain the venal Besides the principles which they held forth to the public were better qualified than those of their opponents to gain the independent part of mankind as they flattered their pride The result of the whole was that the elections in general went in favour of the Whigs especially in boroughs and thus the Tories found themselves at once divested of a power which they had neither the courage to exert with spirit  Burnet vol iv  nor the prudence to use with moderation  Campaign of  During these domestic transactions the war was carried on abroad with a degree of ardour The Duke of Marlborough arrived in Holland in the beginning of April and having concerted the operations of the campaign with the States took the field in the first week in May His great object was to improve the victories of the preceding campaign by carrying the war by the Moselle into the heart of France With the same number of troops as in the last year he marched through the country of Limbourg and being joined near Treves by the Prince of Hesse he crossed the Moselle and the Saar marched to the defile of Taveren and advanced to Elst The French apprized of the designs of Marlborough had assembled an army of seventy thousand men on that side under the command of the Mareschal de Villars who occupying a strong camp at Sirk resolved to remain on the defensive  The prince of Baden who commanded the Imperialists either from a personal dislike to Marlborough or unprovided with the means of taking the field disappointed him in his promise of joining the allies with the German troops and thus the Duke remained inactive in his camp for the space of a month in daily hopes of a reinforcement that never arrived  Hist d'Allemagne tom vii    Death of the Empeor  The death of the Emperor Leopold which happened on the sixth of May changed in nothing the face of affairs That Prince born with a degree of virtue was destitute of talents The apparent line of ambition which passed through his whole conduct was rather the disposition of his court than any passion of his own His son who had been several years before created King of the Romans succeeded him in the Imperial dignity That Prince inherited his father's ministers as well as his dominions and the same counsels continued to act under the name of Joseph that had uniformly prevailed in the reign of Leopold The succession to the Spanish throne the increase of the Imperial power on the ruins of the authority of the German princes and the reduction of the insurgents in Hungary were the principal objects of the present as well as of the late Emperor But Joseph was better calculated than his father to succeed in these views His mind was active and full of fire his disposition vehement his character enterprising and to an industry which ran violently from one scheme to another he added a firmness of soul that disdained to yield either to accident or misfortune  Slow meafares of the German  The new Emperor however was incapable of infusing his own fire into the sluggish Germanic body already languishing for repose Destitute of resources at home he could not even animate into action his hereditary troops or furnish his part of the strength employed by the allies against the common enemy This inability in the court of Vienna combining with the envious and obstinate disposition of the Prince of Baden forced Marlborough to abanden his designs of carrying the war into France by the course of the Moselle During the time that general remained at Dellt the French under the Elector of Bavaria and the Mareschal de Villeroi had taken Hui  June    and were on their march to Liege The States alarmed at the progress of the enemy requested the duke to quit the Moselle and to hasten back to their aid on the side of Flanders Having decamped in the night he repassed the dangerous defile of Taveren without being molested and directing his march toward Liege joined the Dutch under Auverquerque which induced the enemy to retire beyond their lines Hui was retaken on the twelfth of July and the duke resolved to retrieve with some enterprise of consequence the glory lost by the prior inactivity of the campaign  of Marlborough    Marlborough forces the French lines  To accomplish his purpose he formed a scheme of forcing the French lines and encamped within a league of the enemy The Elector and the Mareschal de Villeroi perceiving the design of the allies drew their armies together leaving only small detachments to dsend the lines on either side The Mehaigne ran about half a league on the right on the left they had two barriers for the convenience of the people of the country at the distance of three leagues On the seventeenth of July  N S  the duke commanded the Dutch to march toward the Mehaigne by way of a feint while at the same time he ordered ten thousand men to form on his right and to lie down there on their arms When it grew dark this body marched toward the barriers They were aollowed close by the army under Marlborough and the Dutch facing about hastened the same way The Elector of Bavaria at length apprized of the Duke's design ordered the left wing of his cavalry to march to prevent the allies from passing the barriers He himself followed with the infantry But the enemy had already formed within the lines After a fierce shock between the Duke and the Bavarian infantry the latter were obliged to give way But ten battalions throwing themselves into a hollow square marched off in spite of the cavalry of the allies and protected as they retreated their flying friends  Hist de France Kane's Mem  The French and Bavarians having after the action retired behind the Dyle the rest of the campaign produced neither movement nor action of imp  ance  Operations on the side of Germany and in Italy  Though the Mareschal de Villars had detached a great portion of his army to Alsace and Flanders  Hist de France tom iii  he found himself superior to the allies when the Duke of Marlborough retired from the Moselle toward Flanders The French forced the lines of Wisseimbourg on the third of July Hombourg surrendered on the twentysixth of the same month to the Marquis de Conflans But the Mareschal enfeebled by detachments was however unable to defend the lines of Haguenau against the Prince of Baden who though he could not on account of the advanced season recover Hombourg found means to extend his quarters into the enemy's country On the side of Germany the campaign could not be said to have been unfavourable for France In Italy their arms were in general attended with success VillaFranca fell into their hands in March  March  The town and port of Nice was taken on the ninth of April The conquest of this place became important as it cut off from the Duke of Savoy every prospect of relief by sea The Duke de Vedome after an obstinate siege of six months became master of Verue  April  He had the good fortune to repulse in an obstinate action the allies under Prince Eugene who attempted to force the passage of the Adda at the bridge of Cassano  Aug  The Duke of Savoy found himself obliged to shut himself up in Turin without any prospect of relief  Hist d'Espagne tom ii    Assairs of Portugal  In Spain the Mareschal de Tesse was forced to raise the siege of Gibraltar on the twentythird of April He had the mortification a few days before to be an eyewitness of the defeat of de Pontis whose ships consisting of five men of war were surprized in the bay and all taken or destroyed by an English squadron under Sir John Leake The campaign on the confines of Spain and Portugal opened favourably for the archduke and the allies The siege of Gibraltar having forced the French and Spaniards to draw the best part of their forces to that side the confederates were encouraged to enter the enemy's country on the frontiers of Beira and Alantejo The Portugueze reduced the principal places in the province  of Estramadura Salvatierra Valencia d'Alcantra  May  and Albuquerque  May  fell into their hands The progress of the spring campaign was however stopt by a body of French and Spaniards who forced the Marquis das Minas who commanded the Portugueze to retire within the limits of his own country In the end of autumn the Portugueze and the other allies who had quarrelled about the projected operations opened at length the campaign with the siege of Badajox But the Mareschal de Tesse having thrown a reinforcement of a thousand men into the place the enemy were forced to relinquish their enterprise and to retire again into Portugal  Hist d'Espagne tom li    Success of the Allies in Spain  During these operations in Portugal affairs of much greater consequence happened in Spain Five thousand troops under the joint command of the Earl of Peterborrow and Sir Cloudsley Shovel having under the escort of a squadron of men of war sailed from St Helen's in the end of May arrived in the port of Lisbon about the middle of June Being joined in that place by a squadron of Dutch under Admiral Allemonde and reinforced with some horse from the Earl of Galway's army in Portugal they took the Archkduke Charles on board sailed to Gibraltar and directed from thence their course to the coast of Catalonia The arrival of of such a great force spread terror and confusion through all Spain The fortresses os Lerida and Tortosa were delivered into the hands of the Archduke without a blow Barcelona was forced to capitulate and almost the whole kingdom of Valencia as well as the province of Catalonia submitted themselves to the new King The fleet of the confederates having retired from the coast of Spain upon the approach of winter the land forces of the allies look up their quarters in the heart of the kingdom  Earl of Peterborrow's conduct  Though this campaign upon the whole was much less unsavourable than the preceding to the house of Bourbon it is apparent that they owed more to the langour of some of their enemies than either to their own force or their conduct  Affairs of Poland  The war in Poland produced some events of importance during the present campaign The good fortune which had hitherto attended his enterprises ceased not to favour the active spirit of the King of Sweden But neither the success of his arms nor his own abilities and perseverance were capable of restoring to peace and order that distracted kingdom The cardinal primate having issued the universalia a diet was held in the month of July at Warsaw under the protection of a body of Swedes The Saxons in endeavouring to disturb the deliberations of that assembly were defeated by the enemy and forced to retire with considerable loss while in the same month the Russians were routed by the Swedes in Courland with the loss of six thousand slain But notwithstanding these advantages the King of Sweden found it impossible to decide the fate of the war The Czar after the defeat of one army poured a still greater force into Courland and reduced the victorious Swedes to the necessity of retiring under the cannon of Riga Mittau itself fell into his hands The Czar besieged Riga But despairing to take the place directed his march towards Warsaw Augustus was in the mean time a kind of fugitive in his own dominions while Stanislaus exercised some feeble acts of royalty under the protection of his maker the King of Sweden  Hist du Nord    Affairs of Scotland  During these transactions abroad the parliament of Scotland met at Edinburgh  June  The late obstinate and determined conduct of that assembly had involved the English minister in difficulties from which he could only extricate himself by gaining through motives of advantage to themselves the most active and vindictive of his political enemies To prevent the return of dangers which he had just escaped he resolved to use all the power and influence that his office had placed in his hands to promote the protestant succession and the union of the kingdoms measures which both he himself and the Duke of Marlborough had secretly opposed  Stuartpapers  in the preceding year To effectuate his purpose the Lord Godolphin through the dictates of his own caution  and the advice of his friends came to a resolution of placing the management of the affairs of Scotland in other hands The Duke of Queensberry raised to the place of lord privyseal was considered as the acting minister and the Duke of Argyle an active forward and spirited young man succeeded the Marquis of Tweedale as commissioner to the parliament A general change in the inferior departments was made and all the privycounsellors laid aside by the preceding ministry were restored except Lockhart of Carnwath and Sir James Foulis of Collington  Mem of Scotl    A session of parliament  The removal of the late ministry formed a new party in parliament which from throwing its weight alternately in the scale of the Jacobites and in that of the favourers of the Revolution acquired the cant name of the flying squadron These without any fixed principle on either side endeavoured by balancing the two other parties to seize again the reins which had been struck from their hands The views of each being fixed on their respective objects the public business was opened with reading the Queen's letter to the house She recommended with great earnestness the settling the succession in the protestant line and an union between the two kingdoms To induce them to apply heartily to the first she promised to give her assent to such provision and restrictions as should appear necessary in such a case and she signified her desire that the means of promoting the latter might be followed through the same line with that marked by the parliament in England  Queen's letters  The lord commissioner and the Earl of Seafield who had been appointed chancellor enforced in their speeches to the house the important matters recommended in the letter from the Queen  Proceedings  The first motion made in parliament  July  proposed that prior to all other business the house should proceed to the consideration of such limitations and conditions of government as should be deemed necessary to circumscribe the royal authority under the next successor in the protestant line This overture however was superseded by a motion for entering prior to any other matter upon the trade of the nation To supply the kingdom with  money two proposals for establishing paper currency were laid before the house These were upon a debate rejected But some other overtures regarding commerce were passed into a law A council of trade was at the same time appointed to put the laws of commerce in execution and to bring the exports and imports of the nation into a balance to be laid before the next session of parliament During the dependence of this bill the Duke of Hamilton presented  July  a resolve that the nomination of a successor should be postponed till a treaty with England could be obtained with regard to the commerce and other concerns of the Scotish nation Though the flying squadron if a cant name may be used joined their votes to those of the adherents of the court this motion was carried by a great majority  Intrigues of the Jacobites act of limitation  Though the cavaliers in conjunction with the country party were successful in this important question the first had formed no great hopes of succeeding to their wishes in parliament They had some time before the meeting of that assembly solicited the court of St Germains  Stuartpapers  for twelve thousand French as a more powerful argument in favour of their cause than idle resolutions which they knew were destined to be defeated by the great weight which the ministry of England had thrown into the opposite scale The pressure of the allies on every side of the dominions of the house of Bourbon had rendered such an expedition impossible in the eyes of the court of Versailles and therefore the Jacobites were left to their own address and influence in the Scotish parliament Encouraged by the success of his last overture the Duke of Hamilton moved on the thirtyfirst of July that in preference to an act for treating with England the house should proceed to the consideration of limitations with regard to the successor to the crown Overtures for various acts to that purpose were accordingly introduced and several were passed that in a manner annnihilated the power of the sovereign Among other securities provided for the subject an act for trinnial parliaments was agreed to by the house But notwithstanding the solemn promises of the ministry that it should be touched with the sceptre when they  obtained the act for a treaty with England the royal assent was refused to the triennial bill  Act for treating with England passed  There is however reason to believe that the ministry through the aid of their friends in England were now enabled to convince the parliament with arguments more solid than vague promises of procuring the royal assent to the triennial bill The temper of the house suffered suddenly such a manifest change that the secret distribution of English money was much suspected by those persons who remained firm to their former views The Jacobites and country party perceiving an alteration in the sentiments of many members when the bill for treating concerning an union with England was brought under debate endeavoured to defeat by conditional clauses a measure which it was now vain to oppose The Duke of Hamilton moved a clause importing that the proposed union  "should no ways derogate from any fundamental laws ancient privileges offices rights liberties and dignities of the Scotish nation"  This overture was so popular that but for the negligence of the duke's own party seven or eight of whom happened to be absent it must have certainly been carried and when it even came to the vote it was lost only by two voices The other attempts made by the cavaliers to clog the act were impotent and illsupported The act for treating with England was passed without any considerable amendments and the parliament having finished this important business and granted the demanded supplies were adjourned on the twentyfirst of September  October New parliament of England meets  On the twentyfifth of October the new parliament of England after various prorogations met at Westminster The great success of the Whigs in the late elections appeared in the choice of a speaker for the house of commons The highchurch party having proposed Mr Bromley who had distinguished himself in the debates on the bill against occasional conformity as a zealous adherent of Toryism the Whigs opposed him with the nomination of Mr Smith Upon a division Smith carried the office of speaker by a great majority  against  and on the twentyseventh of October he was approved by her Majesty according to the usual form The  Queen addressed to the two houses a speech penned by Cowper the new lordkeeper which though suitable to the times shewed that the measures of the court were no longer guided by Tory principles She urged with earnestness the necessity of prosecuting the war to restore the balance of power which she said the possession of Spain by the house of Bourbon had destroyed She demanded the necessary supplies for supporting the operations of the allies as well as for exerting the force of her own kingdoms She informed them of the act passed in Scotland for treating concerning an union and she concluded with taking an obvious part with the Whigs by declaring that the church was in no danger a circumstance urged with vehemence by the Tories to arm the prejudices of the populace to favour their own designs  November A supply Pretences of parties  This speech was so suitable to the sentiments of the prevailing party and the subject in general so popular that an address of thanks was voted by the commons without either debate or one dissenting voice  Nov  The supplies for the next year amounting besides the ordinary revenue appropriated to the civil list and the payment of interest for debts to more than five millions were voted with the same unanimity and seeming zeal  Nov  The war was not the topic upon which the contending parties resolved to try their force Public pretences were invariably used throughout this reign by the leaders of the two parties to cover their own private designs upon office and the possession of power The leaders of the Tories on the one hand expressed the utmost solicitude for the church of England Those of the Whigs discovered a wonderful zeal for the succession of the Crown in the protestant line They both assailed the weakness of their less intelligent followers through these channels and arming themselves with the prejudices of the populace endeavoured alternately to take the cabinet by storm The Tories having been deserted by the ministry applied themselves to the people Papers publications and pamphlets were written with zeal and propagated with ardour and the nation were perpetually alarmed with insinuations of secret conspiracies  and open attacks made by the ministry and Whigs upon the doctrines and even against the very being of the church of England  Inconsistency of the Tories  Though the Whigs yielded not to the Tories in bespeaking the favour of the populace against their opponents the latter were guilty of inconsistencies which threw discredit on their party To harass their sovereign to embarrass their political enemies perhaps to gain some popularity for themselves and above all to vent their resentment against the minister they had long before the meeting of parliament  Stuartpapers  resolved to propose either by bill or address to demand from the Queen that the Princess Sophia should be invited into the kingdom as the next heir of the crown A proposal of the same kind when urged by the Whigs had been rejected by the Tories themselves when possessed of power But neither the inconsistency of the measure nor its contrariety to their own private opinions could prevail with them to forego a motion from which they hoped to derive less advantage to their own views than a kind of malignant pleasure in disconcerting their enemies On the fifteenth of November the Lord Haversham chosen upon the occasion to be the mouth of the party after having in a set speech inveighed against the conduct of the allies in the last campaign and by implication blamed the Duke of Marlborough concluded with a motion that her Majesty should be addressed to invite the presumptive heir according to the act of settlement into England  Haversham's speech Nov      Their motion for inviting the protestant heir rejected  Haversham was supported in his motion with great warmth by the Duke of Buckingham and the Earls of Nottingham and Rochester The resentment of these  oblemen against the government and the party now in  ower induced them to contradict not only their own se  et principles  Stuartpapers paslim  but even those which they had uni  rmly avowed to the world They urged that as they  ad sworn to maintain the protestant succession they  ere obliged to adhere to the motion as the best means  ensure the possession of the crown to the heir establish  by law They affirmed that it appeared throughout  the annals of former times that the Prince who f  came to England had always carried the crown of th  kingdom They insinuated that the pretending s  cessor might be in London in three days while three weeks would at least be necessary for bringing the declared successor to that city To these arguments they added others of little weight as they themselves were deemed insincere The Whigs by a strange reverse were forced to oppose the motion to preserve their own influence with the Queen They alleged that it was neither safe for the crown nor secure for the nation that the presumptive heir should not be in an entire dependence on the reigning sovereign and they urged with propriety that the rivalship between the two courts would inevitably involve the kingdom in all the distractions incident to the animosities of counteracting parties and interests  Burnet vol iv    Bill of regency  The weight of the party in power contributed however more to the rejecting of the motion than the force of argument But if the Tories were not sincere in their professions in favour of the house of Hannover they were at least the means of strengthening the security of the succession of the crown in that family The Lord Wharton having with a happy irony con+gratulated the house on the manifest miracle that ha  so suddenly changed the principles of the Tories an  +der was made that the judges should prepare and presen  to the lords a bill for the further security of the pro+testant succession This bill by forming an eventual re+gency of the first officers of state upon the death  the Queen effectually secured the kingdom by p  +viding a continuation of legal government till the s  +cessor should arrive and assert his own authority B  those who seemed most to urge the invitation to the pr  +sumptive heir were least inclined to the bill of regenc  The Tories opposed it in every clause and proposed  +ditions apparently more designed to gain the populac  than either necessary or even useful in themselves O  of their amendments was manifestly calculated to def  the intention of the bill by rendering it ridiculous  was offered as a limitation on the regency that th  should possess no power of repealing the very act of settlement  Burnet vol iv  for the security of which they themselves were to be invested with that authority  A vote that the church is not in danger  The vehement and inconsiderate measures into which their own resentment had betrayed the Tories furnished their opponents with another opportunity of mortifying their pride A cry that the church was in danger had been propagated with such industry without doors that the Whigs resolved to check the panic which had spread among the people by a declaratory vote in parliament The Lord Halifax having moved for a day to examine into the pretended danger of the church a debate ensued more expressive of the violence of the parties than suitable to the subject The act of security in Scotland the loss of the bill of occasional conformity in England the absence of the next successor to the crown beyond seas the increase of presbyterian academies and the licentiousness of the press were produced by the Tories as proofs of the danger of the church The Whigs argued on the other side that the Scotish act of security regarded only temporal concerns That the absence of the successor was supplied by the act of regency That the bill of occasional conformity having been considered and rejected by the house the question was now determined and that the Presbyterian academies were scarce more numerous than those taught by Nonjurors They agreed with the Tories that the licentiousness of the press had been carried to extremities but by none further than by the pretended friends of the church of England A vote was passed with which the commons concurred that the church was in a safe and flourishing condition and that whoever should suggest that the established religion was in danger was an enemy to the Queen the church and the kingdom  Dec    Progress towards an union  During these disputes between the parties with regard  the internal affairs of England the two houses pro  eeded almost without debate in the business of the  nion with Scotland The parliament of the latter king  om had addressed the Queen against any progress in  hat important treaty till the English act which conditionally  declared the Scots aliens should be repealed  Journals Nov  The Whigs having first moved for that compulsatory law the Tories imagined that they would still adhere to their own work They resolved therefore to press them on that ground by promoting an immediate repeal  Burnet vol iv  But their opponents yielding prudently the point without opposition they were disappointed in their views The act declaring the Scots aliens by a certain day was not only reversed the Whigs went still further and moved that the act relating to the manufacture and trade of Scotland should be also repealed These measures by opening a way for an immediate treaty were as popular as they were necessary Though a majority of the parliament of Scotland were already gained by private means the body of the people were still inflamed to a degree of fury with regard to their independence as a nation Any backwardness in the parliament of England on the subject of the compulsatory laws would have brought matters to extremities and considering the party in favour of the lineal succession among the English a war could scarce terminate in any event short of a subversion of the settlement of the crown in the Protestant line  Unanimity with regard to the war  The same unanimity which was observed with regard to Scotland was pursued without deviation in whatever concerned the effectual prosecution of the war Though the campaign in Flanders was neither splendid nor followed with striking consequences the reduction of a considerable portion of Spain through the sole efforts of the English nation had raised among the people an eagerness for continuing hostilities which imparted itself to their representatives in parliament The Duke of Marlborough having visited Vienna where he was raised to the dignity of Prince of Mindelheim by the Emperor arrived in London on the thirtieth of December  January  Though he received the thanks of the house of commons  January  for his services in the last campaign some attacks but indirectly were made in the house os lords on his con+duct by the excluded party The disappointments o  the Moselle were by an implication laid to his charge  and though the blame of the inactive campaign in Brabant was placed to the account of the Dutch it was apparent that the Tories had circumstances become more favourable intended to pass a censure on the Duke of Marlborough  March Proceedings of the two houses  Though the remaining part of the session was distinguished with no business of importance the animosities between the two parties filled every debate with altercation and noise The people without doors were not disinterested spectators of the transactions within They were roused with libels and pamphlets which zealots on both sides poured daily from the press and they suffered themselves as usual to be deceived by the designing or inflamed by the violent and weak Among the publications concerning the proposed invitation of the presumptive heir of the crown to England one commanded the attention and incurred the censure of parliament Sir Rowland Gwyne a busy selfish forward and intriguing man violent in his principles suspicious through weakness deceiving others and perhaps deceived himself by seeing objects through the muddy medium of a clouded understanding had repaired to the court of Hannover to gain the favour of the electoral family by alarming their fears concerning the succession of the British crowns Upon the subject of the invitation to the Princess Sophia Gwyne wrote a letter to the Earl of Stamford which found its way to the press This illworded unmeaning and confused performance though it seemed to approve of the principles of the Whigs severely censured that party for refusing their consent to the proposed invitation of the Princess Sophia into England The commons on the eighth of March voted Gwyne's letter a scandalous false and malicious libel The lords concurred with them in an address upon this occasion to the Queen who replied that being fully sensible of the pernicious tendency of the paper which they had censured she would comply with their request and give orders to prosecute the printer and author  March    Parliament prorogued  The great business of the nation being finished the parliament was prorogued on the nineteenth of March  The contest between parties contrary to former experience had been productive in this session of measures considered highly favourable to the prosperity and repose of the kingdom The Tories in endeavouring to take the ground of the Whigs and to appropriate to themselves their popularity produced the act of regency which gave the first great security to the descent of the crown in the Protestant line Though the laws had fixed the succession on the house of Hannover five years before the supposed attachment of the Queen to her own family the numerous party known to be wellaffected to the pretended Prince of Wales the prejudices of the people against foreigners and the memory of the inconvenience of connexions abroad in the last reign had rendered the success of the act of settlement extremely doubtful During this state of uncertainty little court was paid by the subjects of England to the electoral family Few visited the court of Hannover and those who made their appearance there either through zeal or weakness like Gwyne hurt the cause which they meant to serve  Hannoverpapers    Act of regency c sent to Hannover  The Princess Sophia herself either suspecting the sincerity of Queen Anne and her ministers or misled by the representations of the new English who resorted to the court of Hannover entertained little hopes that her family should ever mount the throne She even seems to have placed no value on the acts of regency and naturalization which passed in the present session  Ibid  She probably soon after changed her sentiments On the fourth of April her grandson the electoral prince was made a knightcompanion of the garter The Lord Halifax accompanied by Clarencieux king at arms was sent to Hannover to carry the ensigns of the order to the prince and to present the act of naturalization to his family The current began to run with vehemence in that channel The lords who could claim any merit in promoting the acts in savour of the house of Hannover made their court with letters full of expressions of attachment and zeal The Whigs adopted chiefly this mode of removing the unfavourable impressions made on the minds of the electoral family by the inconsiderate  insinuations of Sir Rowland Gwyne and other zealots of the same kind  Hannoverpapers    Observations  The strife between the Whigs and Tories in shewing an appearance of zeal for the family of Hannover proceeded more from the selfish views of their respective leaders than from motives of public good To secure the good opinion of the people in countries possessed of liberty is the shortest way of gaining and the surest means of retaining power In the political farces too frequently exhibited by parties the populace are the spectators and those who suit their antick gestures best to their prejudices carry the most applause Two principles had long been predominant in the minds of the English nation a fixed aversion to France and a zeal which bordered on enthusiasm for the protestant religion The manly spirit which undeviatingly looks forward to public freedom independent of common prejudices fell only to the share of a few The pretence to that spirit though a stale imposture seldom failed to impose on the world The Whigs when they affected to give the great security to the Protestant succession paid their court to the populace in a manner inconsistent with the avowed principles of their party They repealed in the bill of regency the limitations which the Tories had imposed on the successor in the act of settlement and with a frankness scarce consistent with common prudence boasted openly that they restored to the crown all its former prerogatives The spirit of party however had been carried to such a pitch that every measure calculated to annoy their adversaries was deemed not only justifiable but even laudable by both sides  Secret conduct of Godolphin  Though the happy timidity of the Lord Godolphin had much contributed to give the great security to the Protestant succession he was too much attached to the excluded family to take any merit to himself with their rivals His actions were even at variance with his principles in his public conduct In his private capacity with an odd inconsistent species of sincerity he avoided to make professions where he wished not to be of service When he promoted in the face of the world the succession of the house of Hannover he continued his intercourse  with the family of Stuart through their agents  Stuartpapers  His fears of impeachment however prevailed over his affection for the excluded race Though the Duke of Marlborough had promised  Ibid  in his name to the agents of the court of St Germains that no money should be given to gain votes for the union in the parliament of Scotland the terrors of Godolphin returned and he opened the treasury to the avarice of the venal and the necessities of the needy The secret spring which moved the great measures of his administration lay in a defect of his mind and by a singular piece of good fortune to his character his country ascribed to his distinguished parts a line of conduct which sprung from his political cowardice  Campaign of  During these important transactions at home preparations were made abroad for opening with vigour the campaign on every side The Duke of Marlborough having left the Hague on the ninth of May joined on the twentieth of the month the united armies of England and the States between Borchloen and Groszwaren France in an evil hour for herself had resolved to act offensively in Flanders The Mareschal de Villeroi issuing from the lines which he had formed behind the Deule advanced to Tirlemont and without waiting for the arrival of the Elector of Bavaria with whom he was joined in the command pushed forward precipitately to Ramillies When his front had advanced to the heights where rises the little Geette he perceived the allies on full march appearing in sight He immediately formed his army in order of battle The Geette and an impassable morass running along its banks covered his left wing and prevented it alike from being attacked itself and from charging the enemy The village of Ramillies situated in a plain near the source of the Geette was advanced before his centre which consisted entirely of infantry The village of Tavieres on the banks of the Mehaigne covered his right wing and an open and level space between Tavieres and Ramillies about a mile and a half in length was filled with one hundred squadrons of horse In this narrow aperture the  battle of Ramillies was fought on the twentythird of May  N S Mem du Marq de Feuquiere    Battle of  On a rising ground opposed to the left of the enemy along the swampy side of the Geette the Duke of Marlborough formed his right His line extended through the plain to the left which was covered by the river Mehaigne Having by a feigned attack on the right of the French which was in fact impracticable deceived the Mareschal de Villeroi he obtained his purpose of obliging the enemy to thin their left which introduced a confusion while it weakened their line in the only place where they could be attempted with advantage The Duke in the mean time ordered Auverquerque with the Dutch infantry to begin the battle on the left while he himself covering his motions with the rising ground fell at once on the centre of the enemy with all the foot that formed his own The French making a gallant resistance Marlborough ordered all his cavalry to make a home charge But in the hurry he himself being a bad horseman falling to the ground was in danger of being trampled to death by his own squadrons Being remounted he pursued his plan of attack while at the same time the Danish horse under the Duke of Wirtemberg fell on their flank and completing the disorder which Marlborough had begun the whole centre of the enemy on which the stress of the battle lay were routed and put to flight  Mem de Fequiere  The horse having abandoned the foot with which they were interlined the latter were cut to pieces  Ramillies  The Elector of Bavaria and the Mareschal de Villeroi shewed more courage in endeavouring to retrieve the battle than they shewed of conduct in forming their line They made repeated but vain efforts to bring back the cavalry to the charge The household troops rallied renewed the battle and were again sorced to fly To complete the misfortunes of the French the remarkable circumstance which happened at the village of Blenheim two years before was a second time exhibited at that of Ramillies Eight battalions which De Villeroi had placed in that village in his front maintained their post  till they perceived their main body driven from the field In endeavouring to retreat toward their left which had not been at all engaged they were attacked by the cavalry of the allies before they could form themselves in the field Confusion slaughter and flight prevailed Many were cut to pieces the rest were dispersed The right wing in the mean time gave way before the Dutch and directed their flight toward Charleroy A complete victory remained to the allies The remains of the enemy having attempted in vain to stand behind the Deule were forced to retreat from thence and to take shelter under the cannon of Lisle  Mem de Feuquiere Kane's Mem    Consequences of that important action  Though no victory could be more complete than that obtained at Ramillies the action may rather be called a rout than a battle The allies through the wretched disposition of Villeroi beat in less than a quarter of an hour an army of eighty thousand men who left no more than three thousand dead in the field  Mem de Marq de Feuquiere  took one hundred pieces of cannon and a great quantity of baggage together with all the various trophies of war  Hist de France tom iii  The consequences of this rout were as important in themselves as they were striking and extraordinary The fugitives were not to be rallied till they had carried themselves not only beyond the pursuit but even the very report of the enemy Their first stand was made about eighty miles from the field of battle Nor durst they even remain at Courtray where first they formed the appearance of an army Some were placed in the frontier garrisons of France The boldest formed themed themselves into two inconsiderable flying armies more calculated to amuse than to oppose a victorious enemy The total conquest of Brabant and almost all Spanish Flanders was the immediate consequence of the victory Louvain Brussels Answerp Mechlin Alost Ghent and Oudenarde surrendered without firing a gun and the first stop was put to the progress of the allies by Dendermonde and Ostende The latter however was forced to capitulate after the trenches were open eight days Menin surrendered after an obstinate resistance  and the sieges of Dendermonde and Aith which were taken successively concluded in Flanders the operations of this important campaign  Campaign in Italy  The Mareschal de Villeroi being recalled he was succeeded in his command by the Duke de Vendôme The removal of the last from Italy contributed to fresh misfortunes which lost to the house of Bourbon Savoy Piedmont and the whole Milanese The beginning of the campaign in Italy was favourable for France and Spain The Duke of Berwick took the castle of Nice on the fourth of January Vendôme having defeated the Germans at Calcinato on the nineteenth of April ordered Turin itself to be invested on the third of May The trenches were opened by the French on the night of the second of June and the fate of the war in Italy seemed to depend on the taking of that important place The Duke of Savoy avoiding to shut himself up in his capital and having sent his family to Genoa retired with a few troops to the vallies of Lucerne among his protestant subjects the Vaudois The strength of the town the bravery of the garrison together with the languor and even unskilfulness of the enemy who were nominally under the command of the Duke of Orleans protracted the siege to the beginning of September when a great event put an end in Italy to all the hopes and efforts of the house of Bourbon  Battle of Turin  Prince Eugene who commanded the German army on the frontiers of the dominions of Venice after a long and painful march and having passed several rivers and many defiles without being opposed arrived in the neighbourhood of Turin in the first week of September joined the Duke Savoy and resolved to attack the enemy The Duke of Orleans and the Mareschal de Marsin who commanded the French army and strongly fortified themselves with entrenchments which extended all the way between the Doria and Stura at the junction of which is situated the city of Turin Though the enemy had made little impression on the works the garcrison began to be in great danger through the want of ammunition No time was therefore to be lost The Prince having made his dispositions for the attack fell suddenly on the entrenchments of the enemy and after  an obstinate contest for two hours entered their camp drove them from the field took all their cannon mortars heavy baggage ammunition and implements employed in the siege The Duke of Orleans himself was wounded The Mareschal de Marsin was killed The fugitives instead of retiring to Casal which would have maintained the Milanese directed their retreat to Pignerol In the space of four hours the Modenese the Mantuan the Milanese Piedmont and ultimately the kingdom of Naples were lost to the house of Bourbon A complete victory obtained by the Count de Medavi over a small army of Imperialists under the command of the Prince of Hesse two days after the battle before Turin served only to aggravate the misfortunes of that action  German accounts Hist de France Mem du Marq de Fenquiere    Progress of the war  The house of Bourbon were persecuted in Spain with misfortunes similar to those which they suffered in Flanders and in Italy Except the taking of Villareal which was forced on the eighth of January by the Conde de LasTorres the whole of the campaign formed one continued train of disgraces and losses The Archduke Charles having by the aid of the English established himself in the winter in Spain Philip the Fifth and the Mareschal de Tesse advanced with twenty thousand men and shut him up at Barcelona while the Comte de Toulouse blocked up the place by sea with a French fleet When a practicable breach was made a fortunate accident preserved the place and with it the footing which the allies had established in Spain A superior fleet appearing under Sir John Leake on the coast the Comte de Toulouse precipitately retired in the night A reinforcement of troops was thrown into Barcelona Philip and the Mareschal de Tessé raised the siege in the utmost confusion An almost total eclipse of the sun which happened on the twelfth of May and covered the country with a sudden darkness compleated the consternation of the superstitions Spaniards They abandoned their camp their provisions their cannon their implements of war and were pursued with slaughter by the enemy through the uncommon darkness which had excited so much their fear Philip having taken a circuit  with his broken and ruined army through a part of the dominions of France returned in disgrace to Madrid  Hist d'Espagne tom ii    and success of the allies in Spain  On the side of Portugal the English and Portugueze took the field with forty thousand men under the command of the Earl of Galway and the Marquis de LasMinas They entered Estramadura they took Alcantara they forced CividadRodrigo Salamanca and the post of Espinar They directed their march and penetrated without resistance to Madrid Philip the Fifth having abandoned his capital removed the Queen and the court to Burgos The English and the Portugueze entered the city in triumph and to complete the misfortunes of the King of Spain he received intelligence that the count de SanctaCruz had delivered Carthagena and the gallies to the enemy The unaccountable errors of the English and Portugueze prevented the Spanish crown from being for ever transferred from the house of Bourbon They loitered in the midst of disease debauchery and sloth at Madrid till they were roused by the approach of Philip with a superior force Galway and LasMinas were forced to retire from Madrid Having joined the Archduke they passed into the kingdom of Valencia and disposed their quarters in such a manner as to cover the kingdoms of Arragon and Catalonia and maintain a free entrance into Castile The Duke of Berwick hung close on their retreat and before the end of the campaign retook Carthagena But that loss was balanced by the reduction of the islands of Majorca and Ivica which the English fleet under Sir John Leake subjected to the dominion of the Archduke  Ibid Naval Hist sic    Operations on the side of Germany  On the side of Germany the French enjoyed a gleam of that good sortune which had formerly attended their arms The Mareschal de Villars with a wellappointed army was opposed to the Prince of Baden who was himself in a declining state of health while at the same time he was illsupported by the court of Vienna The French sorced the Imperialists to raise the blockade of sort Louis They seized the retrenchments of Drusenheim  May  which the Prince of Baden had abandoned They recovered all they had lost in the preceding campaign  and such was their superiority and the langour of the Germans that had not the misfortunes in Flanders and Italy disconcerted the court of Versailles and weakened by the necessary detachments the army of the Mareschal de Villars that commander might have penetrated with success into the heart of Germany But oppressed with the misfortunes which attended the arms of France in every other quarter Villars discovered a kind of melancholy consolation in having found himself capable of avoiding disasters without endeavouring to retrieve in Germany the laurels which his country had lost on every other side  Naval transactions  The operations of the fleet in the Mediterranean contributed much to the success of the allies on the side of Spain But no naval transaction of any importance happened in the ocean A Frenchman who assumed the title and character of the Marquis de Guiscard had with a kind of vivacity which passed upon the world for parts insinuated himself into the favour and confidence of the English ministry and formed the plan of an expedition to the coast of France In compliance with the intelligence communicated by this adventurer land forces to the number of ten thousand men were sent on board of transports under the protection of the confederate fleets commanded in chief by Sir Cloudsley Shovel The Earl of Rivers a man of a profligate character  Swist's Notes of Macky MS  and venal principles but personally brave was placed at the head of the forces destined for the expedition But the plan was so indefinite and illprojected that a contrary wind which drove back the fleet and confined the ships of war and transports to the channel till the season for action was past might be considered as a singular interposition of good fortune The avowed scheme of the Marquis de Guiscard was to restore liberty to France but he behaved himself with such tyranny and folly in a command in which he had been placed by the indulgence of the English government that he was recalled from the fleet at the special request of the admiral  Affairs of the North  During these important transactions in the south and west of Europe the affairs of the north and east suffered  Hist d'Allemagne tom vii  a material change The death of Augustus Frederic Bishop of Lubec had threatened in the end of the preceding year to involve the north in new troubles Prince Charles of Denmark and the Duke Administrator of HolsteinGottorp had their respective pretensions on the vacant bishopric The latter took possession in virtue of an election made of himself in the quality of coadjutor Prince Charles supported by his brother the King of Denmark made himself master by force of the castle of Eutin while the King of Sweden and the Elector of Hannover declared themselves on the other side While the forces of the two last Princes were ready to march against the Danes the Queen of England and the States of the United Provinces interposed their good offices in quenching the flame which was ready to involve the whole north in a fresh war The troops of Denmark retired from the castle of Eutin and the place was delivered in sequestration to the residents of England and Holland The residents however restored the possession of Eutin and its dependencies to the Prince Administrator of HolsteinGottorp without prejudice to the rights of Prince Charles of Denmark  Hist du Nerd tom i    Affairs of Poland  In Poland the invincible courage of the King of Sweden triumphed over all the schemes of his active and obstinate enemies the Russians and the Saxons That indefatigable Prince profited by the winter and flew to fresh victories along the ice with which the rigour of the season had covered the rivers and marshes Renschild his general having by a feint inveigled the enemy from their strong posts in the woods defeated the combined armies with great slaughter on the thirteenth of February In this decisive battle

powerful and victorious enemy in the heart of his country had no resource but in a treaty of peace which he could only obtain on the most humiliating terms He was forced to renounce all pretensions to the crown of Poland and to acknowledge Stanislaus as lawful sovereign of that kingdom  Hist du Nord tom ii    King of Sweden feared and courted by all  His march into the heart of Germany his victories in the course of the war the humiliating terms of peace to which he had reduced King Augustus the state of the contending powers in general and the kind of balance which was still preserved notwithstanding the victories of the allies over the armies of the house of Bourbon had raised the King of Sweden into the eminent situation of being the umpire of the fate of Europe Mankind turned their attention to that monarch in a degree equal to their hopes from his spirit or their fears from his power France courted his friendship with a vehemence proportionable to the distressed condition of her affairs The emperor dreaded that the presence of Charles in Germany might kindle disturbances which by employing the force of the empire at home might disappoint the views of his own family on the Spanish throne The diet of Ratisbon shewed a disposition of declaring the King of Sweden an enemy so the empire But the Emperor himself found means to soften any resentment that might arise in the breast of that enterprising Prince by flattering his pride Besides the mind of Charles was too much engaged with the design of reducing the Czar of Muscovy into the same abject condition with the Elector of Saxony to permit him to entertain thoughts of any other kind He therefore listened without being moved to the instances of France and yielded to the desire of the Emperor without any attachment to his cause  Historia Polona p    Articles of Union settled  While the present year was rendered remarkable abroad with military transactions of great importance and renown it was distinguished at home by an event equally memorable in the civil line The Queen in consequence of powers vested in her person by the parliaments of England and Scotland had appointed commissioners  of both nations to meet and treat concerning an Union of the two kingdoms They met accordingly for the first time at the Cockpit on the sixteenth of April and having continued their sittings at intervals to the twentythird of July they presented the articles upon which they had agreed to her Majesty The most material of these were the following That the two kingdoms should be united into one by the name of Great Britain That the succession of the united kingdom should remain to the Princess Sophia and the heirs of her body being protestants That the whole people of Britain should be represented by one parliament in which sixteen peers and fortyfive commoners chosen for Scotland should sit and vote That the subjects of the united kingdom should enjoy a full freedom and intercourse of trade and navagation and a reciprocal communication of all other rights privileges and advantages belonging to the subjects of either kingdom  Views and  But though the commissioners had settled without much difficulty the articles of union there was reason to apprehend that the treaty would meet with great opposition in the parliament of Scotland The body of the people either swayed by the adherents of the excluded family or yielding to the dictates of their pride were utterly averse to a measure which annihilated them in a manner as a nation The hopes of the court of St Germains rose in proportion to the violence which prevailed among the Scots Relying in some degree on the promises of the Duke of Marlborough  Stuartpapers  that no money should be sent from the treasury of England to gain votes in Scotland they hoped that the treaty would he rejected by a majority in parliament and they extended their views to an immediate advantage to their own cause from a certainty of the disturbances that were to ensue Their party in Scotland endeavoured in the the mean time to be provided against the worst events Conscious of the venality of many of their own number they could not trust the fate of the measure to their avowed principles They therefore demanded succours  om France and resolved to appeal from parliament to  e decision of the sword Having long foreseen what  afterwards happened they had opened a communication with Lewis the Fourteenth whose interest they knew especially in the untoward state of his affairs was intimately connected with their cause  secret intrigues  The eagerness with which the Whigs in England pressed the ministry of that kingdom to accomplish an union with Scotland had greatly increased the number of the friends of the excluded family In the two preceding years the Jacobites had made frequent proposals to the French King to which he paid little attention as long as the misfortunes of the war had left him the power of giving effectual aid To satisfy himself however concerning the solidity of the assurances transmitted repeatedly from Scotland he sent one Hooke an English Catholic and a colonel in his service with letters from himself and the pretended Prince of Wales to the leaders of the malecontents in that kingdom Hooke arriving in the month of August executed his commission in a manner calculated to defeat his own views Attaching himself to a particular set of the cavaliers he offended the rest while his extreme vanity and arrogance disgusted some and rendered all unwilling to trust themselves in his hands They however made general assurances of their fidelity and promised their utmost exertions in favour of the excluded family should the French King land the Pretender in Scotland with a force sufficient to protect his person till his friends should assemble in arms  Stuartpapers Lockhart's Memoirs    of the Jacobites  Hooke having received these general assurances returned to France and the Jacobites unanimously made choice of one Captain Stratton as their agent to inquire into the real disposition of the court of Versailles They had previously sounded the Tories in England particularly the Duke of Leeds and the Lord Granville But they found them more cautious than themselves and unwilling to agree to any attempt in favour of the pretended Prince of Wales during the life and reign of his sister Queen Anne The Scots however were not discouraged Urged by their violent principles and beyond measure averse to the union they resolved to hazard every thing to accomplish their views Stratton was well  received by the court of Versailles But the battles of Ramillies and Turin had disconcerted all their measures Lewis declared that he could spare neither men nor money in the present untoward state of his affairs That however he would search for a more favourable conjuncture and effectually support the cause of the excluded family With these assurances and with letters from the Pretender to the leaders of his party Stratton returned and the Jacobites found themselves obliged to abandon the fate of the union to their efforts in conjunction with the countryparty in the approaching session of parliament  Oct Parliament meets  They however entertained no hopes of success nor had they reason to expect it in a legal way They were strangers neither to the venality of the members nor to the effectual measures taken by the court of England to gain a majority through the channels of ambition and avarice The repeated promises of the Duke of Marlborough  Stuartpapers  to the court of St Germains that no money should be sent to Scotland were little regarded by Godolphin His fears for himself had overcome his attachment to the excluded family and though he seemed from the wretched pittance he bestowed in some measure unwilling to ensure success no sum was too little for purchasing the votes of the Scotish members A great majority being thus procured the parliament to which Queensberry was appointed commissioner was suffered to meet on the third of October The treaty of Union being read was ordered to be printed and the house adjourned for seven days The people who had been hitherto soothed with favourable reports of the articles became outrageous finding themselves as they thought deceived The interval of the adjournment was filled with tumults clamour and confusion without doors But within a determined resolution was formed to adhere to the articles of the treaty  Lockhart's Memoirs    A great majority fo  the Union  The members in opposition endeavouring to protract measures which they could not prevent moved for a day of fasting and prayer to procure the direction of the Almighty in the important affair of the Union The motion  being overruled together with another for a delay of eight days the house proceeded to the consideration of the treaty article by article On every vote a majority of more than two to one appeared for the Union The peers who gained the least by the treaty were the most eager for its being approved Many of that order in particular the Earl of Roxburgh sacrificed their former zeal against an union to promises of being advanced to higher honours Others yielded to their necessities or listened to their avarice Some who perceived the violence of the Jacobites abetted through principle a treaty which was likely to put an end to the romantic schemes of that restless party A few tired of the unmeaning factions which had so long distracted the kingdom favoured the Union from a view of repose All seemed to be flattered with the hopes of extending in time over Great Britain those privileges and honours which were now confined to a narrow corner of the island These motives combining with that subserviency to the views of the reigning prince which peers derive from the crown with their patents threw the weight of the nobility of Scotland on the side of a treaty that seemed calculated to render their order insignificant if not contemptible  Tumults in Scotland  The whole month of October  Proceedings of Scot parl  was spent in reading and debating article by article the treaty of Union Though no decisive vote was yet proposed the people perceived from the complexion of the house that the whole would be approved by the parliament During the debates the mob rose at Edinburgh and committed every species of outrage and extravagance The members who favoured the Union the servants of government and the commissioner himself were menaced and insulted Those who opposed the treaty were received with the acclamations of the populace every where and denominated the friends patrons and even saviours of their native land But when in the beginning of November the parliament proceeded to approve of the articles addresses against the Union were poured in from every side The populace roused to a degree of fury throughout the  kingdom threatened to come in a body to Edinburgh to dissolve a parliament which they said was ready to betray their country In Glasgow in particular the inhabitants took arms drove their magistrates out of the city insulted such as favoured the Union and hung in effigy the commissioners who had agreed to that treaty The uncommon rigour of the season could only save the parliament from the vengeance of the people who had they not been prevented by the inclemency of the weather were determined to pour from every quarter to Edinburgh to tear to pieces the obnoxious part of their representatives  Mem of Scotland    Debates in the house  While the populace exhibited such symptoms of sury without doors the countryparty endeavoured to rouse the spirit of the members within Mr Fletcher of Salton the Lord Belhaven and particularly the Duke of Hamilton used upon the occasion all the force of their pathetic eloquence On the subject of the unequal representation of Scotland the latter expressed himself in terms full of animation and force  "Shall we then in an hour"  he said  "yield with a vote what our fathers maintained for so many ages with the sword Am I now heard by none of the descendants of those illustrious patriots who aided Bruce to restore the constitution to revenge the treachery of England to overturn the mean usurpation of Baliol Where are the Douglasses Where the Campbels Where are the peers and where the barons once the bulwark of our nation Have they left no posterity either to improve on their glory or to defend the rights which they have transmitted from ancient times The children of those who aided them in the pursuit of honour are more faithful to the reputation of their ancestors The people have neither forgot nor contemned the freedom which their fathers preserved with their blood But the nobles a degenerate race are ready to stain the honours though they bear the titles of their ancestors Shall we then tamely give up the independence and sovereignty of our country when we are entreated and even commanded to preserve them by those whom we represent Shall we yield to our fears or if possible to meaner motives when we are assured  of the support of a whole nation roused to rage by indignity and shame"  Arguments  To these declamatory apostrophes the Duke and other members added arguments of a more solid kind  Mem of Scotland  They averred that all the advantages from a participation of government with England and the repose that might be expected from an union with a powerful kingdom were but mean considerations for the spirit which the people must lose with their independence as a nation They argued that though individuals might profit by the change the country in general must suffer decay from the removal of the seat of government which like the heart in the human frame threw life and vigour from the center to the extremities of the kingdom They affirmed that instead of bringing a part of the commerce of England into Scotland the Union would ruin that of the latter kingdom by carrying away from their native country to which they would probably never return the most enterprising and the most industrious of its inhabitants They said that imposts already laid on the trade of England would more than counterbalance the present disadvantages of that of the Scots whose imports and exports were less burdened and they affirmed that though some change for the better might happen with regard to commerce in some particular places that circumstance ought rather to be ascribed to an increase of industry in a few individuals than to the general prosperity of the country  against the Union  They descended from these more obvious arguments to speculative observations They affirmed that Scotland as an independent kingdom ought to have met England on equal ground They said that an Union which deprived any subject of the rights which he already possessed looked more like terms obtained from the indulgence of conquerors than a treaty voluntarily concluded between free nations for mutual advantage They averred that the Scottish peers by relinquishing the right of their order to sit and vote in parliament had betrayed the honour of their country and actually altered its constitution and that the small number of the representatives of the people had effectually thrown the  nation under the dominion of strangers while it deprived many individuals of the honour and advantage of having a share in framing laws by which they were to be governed They derived an argument against the Union from the dangers in which it might involve even the freedom of England and consequently that of Scotland as united with that kingdom in its misfortunes rather than in its advantages The representatives of the Scots they said would inevitably become a poor and despicable race depending on the purse and consequently on the will of the Crown and having shewn so little concern for the support of their own constitution it was not to be expected they would pay any regard to that of another nation  The articles approved  On the other side it was urged with vehemence that the Union in the present state of affairs was necessary and that no better terms could be obtained from the English nation To this the Duke of Hamilton fiercely replied that  "he thought the Scots being on the same continent with the English might furnish their own commissioners with a very decisive argument on that subject"  A profound silence followed these words  Oct  None offered to make any reply to an observation which was in fact unanswerable Though Scotland had been long torn to pieces with violent factions and obstinate parties the Union had become much more necessary for England than for that kingdom Had therefore the parliament of Scotland regarded their own future interest more than a trival advantage at present there is scarce any doubt but they could have commanded terms more consonant to the independence which they claimed in the name of their country But though the Jacobites ascribed the passing of the act of Union to the venality of the members they might with equal justice accuse their own want of spirit and folly The Duke of Hamilton himself who shewed so much vehemence in speaking yielded when matters demanded action to a happy timidity more decisive with regard to the Union than all the purchased votes of his opponents  Mem of Scot Annals of Q Anne  Having settled with all those who opposed the treaty to quit under a protest the house in a body he shrunk unexpectedly from his own  scheme The countryparty and most of the Jacobites in disgust or despair left the town in the beginning of January and such articles as had not been hitherto approved were carried with little opposition  Mem of Scot    The Presbyterians resolve to disperse the parliament  The prudence timidity or according to the Jacobites the treachery and private views of the Duke of Hamilton by disconcerting the opposition were the chief springs on which the success of the Union turned  Hooke's Negociations  The lower sort of people throughout the kingdom were inflamed to a degree of madness at the thoughts of being subjected as they construed the consequences of the Union to the government and tyranny of the English nation The act of security by placing arms in their hands two years before had rendered them fit for war The nobility and chiefs of clans under the sanction of law had for two successive summers called their vassals to the field formed encampments and established a degree of discipline The Presbyterians of the West who had suffered much under the government of the house of Stuart were now the most violent to forward their cause by defeating the Union and consequently the succession in the family of Hannover They sent to inform the Duke of Hamilton that they were preparing to march to Edinburgh to disperse to use their own expressions a wretched parliament who by suffering themselves to be purchased to the betraying of the honour prosperity and independence of their country had forfeited their right to determine for their constituents and had become an assembly of lawless and abandoned robbers  Letter of the Laird of Kersland MS  The Duke of Hamilton opposed neither the justness of their opinions nor the propriety of their designs But he prevented the execution of the latter by shewing them that it was not yet the proper time The Earl of Strathmore and the Viscount Stormont made the same violent offers for the counties of Perth and Angus but they were also disappointed by the Duke of Hamilton  They are prevented by the Duke of Hamilton  This mysterious conduct of Hamilton requires to be explained He was in his principles a violent Jacobite from the Revolution to the end of the second year of  Queen Anne His undeviating adherence to the interest of James the Second his industry and negociations in that Prince's favour in England till the affair of Darien had rendered Scotland a more promising field for intrigue had gained to the Duke an unbounded confidence from the court of St Germains He conducted himself according to their instructions and THEY paid the utmost deference to his advice When the countryparty in conjunction with the Jacobites had carried repeated resolutions in parliament that the successor to the crown of England should NOT mount the throne of Scotland a gleam of royalty seems to have opened on the Duke of Hamilton's mind This cooled his zeal for the family of Stuart and disconcerted his own measures by being an object too great and too difficult for his limited capacity Though after the posterity of James the First of England the Duke was the next Protestant heir to the crown of Scotland he was by no means qualified to gratify his ambition His estate was not great and he was overwhelmed with debt He had few vassals and scarce any followers except such as looked up to him as the head placed over them by the court of St Germains When he hesitated to join in their violent schemes against the Union he lost their confidence His most intimate friends deserted a man who was believed to have betrayed his party He was openly accused of treachery and venality and the reflections of others combining perhaps with his own regret for having abandoned what fortune had placed in his hands threw him into a violent illness which threatened his dissolution  Lockhart's Mem Hooke's Negociations Stuartpapers    Reflections  Though the terms of the Union were by no means calculated to flatter the pride of the Scots as an independent people no expedient could be deemed unfortunate that put an end to their own government as it then stood There were radical defects in the constitution of the kingdom which in the best times and in the ablest hands could not fail to be productive of perpetual evils to the nation The estates of parliament by meeting in one house and voting promiscuously in all debates created a confusion and promoted a jarring of interests  more likely to embarrass than to transact the business of the public with regularity and precision The number of the peers the poverty of that order and their consequent dependence on the crown by carrying every vote in parliament left the body of the people in a manner without a representative The weight which the possession of England threw into the scale of the sovereign had improved his authority before the Revolution into an almost uncontroulable tyranny The crown was absolute though government was permitted to retain its ancient form The blow which the royal prerogative received in Scotland in the memorable year established licentiousness rather than freedom in that kingdom The parliament were placed in a situation to make the most for themselves at the hands of the King while the people felt nothing from the alteration in government but a change of tyrants  on the union  Notwithstanding this untoward picture of the affairs of Scotland the period of time between the Revolution and the passing of the act of union produced men of eminent talents in that kingdom The freedom of debate which was introduced by the Revolution into parliament furnished many with the means of discovering their own parts and animated them with an eagerness which mankind mistook for public spirit In an evil hour for the nation they were divided into many and irreconcilable factions a circumstance hurtful in any country but particularly ruinous where the field of contest is too small While they watched the motions of one another the golden opportunity of mending their own constitution at home or of incorporating themselves upon honourable and advantageous terms with England was for ever lost The peculiar situation of the latter kingdom had placed the fate of her monarchy in some measure in the hands of the Scots and the latter could scarce be called unreasonable should they insist upon meeting their more powerful neighbours upon a footing of greater equality But in the animosity of parties all regard for the public was lost and a kind of mean selfishness which scarce deserved to be dignified with the name of avarice took possession of every breast and marked the age with indelible infamy  Peace offered by France  While the great event of the union between the British kingdoms was ready to secure the tranquillity of England at home she preposterously rejected proposals for restoring upon the most honourable terms for herself the general peace of Europe The French King broken with the misfortunes of the campaign on every side began seriously to think of putting an end to a war which had already fallen so heavy on his subjects and even threatened the monarchy of France with danger if not with dissolution Having privately made some ineffectual applications of this kind to the States of the United Provinces he resolved publickly to signify his earnest desire of peace and he for that purpose ordered the Elector of Bavaria to write letters to the Duke of Marlborough and the fielddeputies of the States to propose the opening of a general congress  Oct  As a proof of his sincerity he mentioned at once the terms He offered the dominions of Spain in Italy to the Archduke Charles a barrier in the Netherlands to the States and a compensation to the Duke of Savoy for the waste made by the war in his territories In return he expected that the territories of Bavaria should be restored to their native Prince and that his grandson Philip the Fifth should sit on the throne of Spain and the Indies  Burnet vol iv Life of Marlborough    Wantonly rejected by the allies  Though these terms were better than those afterwards obtained considering the expence of treasure and blood they were not likely to prove agreeable to those who led the counsels of the allies The Duke of Marlborough was fond of the emoluments as well as of the glory of war Prince Eugene besides being actuated by similar motives carried an irreconcilable aversion to France into all his views and the pensionary Heinsius who had the address to lead the counsels of the States in acting in subserviency to the two generals yielded to his own interest These three distinguished persons were the great springs that now moved the grand alliance Besides the people of England animated with the success of the war were unwilling to put an end by a peace to the amusement arising from further victories The Emperor having the good fortune to have HIS war supported  by the benevolence and generosity of strangers had relaxed his exertions to a degree that suited his convenience and he was indifferent how long a contest in which he might gain much and could lose nothing might continue The King of Portugal and the Duke of Savoy were so little considered that they were not consulted and from all these various causes Europe was destined to remain for several years more a scene of carnage distress and confusion The Whigs who were now possessed of the whole power of government in England insulted common sense in the reason which they gave for rejecting the proposed peace They said the terms offered by France were too good to be the foundation of a lasting tranquillity  Hannoverpapers  and therefore that they ought not to be admitted  Dec Parliament meets  In the attention paid by the people and ministry to affairs beyond the limits of the kingdom nothing memorable could have happened at home The parliament having met at Westminster on the third of December the commons proceeded with such unanimity to grant the supplies that an ample provision was made in the space of eighteen days for the service of the succeeding year Though the excluded party had neither forgotten their own misfortunes nor forgiven those in office the splendour of victories abroad and the reputation of their measures at home had placed the ministry beyond the power of any successful attack The churchparty therefore prudently fell down with a stream which they could no longer oppose The two houses in congratulating the Queen on the successes of the war neglected not the Duke of Marlborough They thanked him for his important services As a more solid and to the Duke a no less grateful mark of their esteem they passed a bill to perpetuate his titles to his posterity in the female as well as in the male line and they continued to his family for ever the five thousand pounds a year which the Queen had granted during her own life  Journals of both houses    Union approved by both houses  With the same unanimity and zeal the commons made provision for an extraordinary debt to the amount of eight hundred thousand pounds contracted by the  ministry in fitting out an expedition which having failed as to the design on the coast of France was directed afterwards to Portugal They provided with the same alacrity for the sum of three hundred and ninetyeight thousand pounds as an equivalent to Scotland for paying henceforth the customs and excises in the same proportion with England  March  This sum though perhaps ill applied was intended for the recoinage of the money of Scotland to discharge the public debt and to repay to the African company all their losses with interest As the misfortunes of that wretched body of adventurers were the source of the disturbances which subsisted among the Scots for the last ten years so the prospect of repayment was a great inducement to their reconcilement to the measure which annihilated their government When the act of the Scotish parliament confirming the treaty of union was laid before the English commons they passed it without opposition In the house of lords it furnished a subject for debate But the minority was so insignificant that the arguments against the treaty deserve not to be recorded  Journals passim    Parliament prorogued  The parliament having finished with great temper the important business of the session were prorogued on the twentyfourth of April and five days after the Queen signified by proclamation that the first parliament of Great Britain should meet on the twentythird of the next October The union of the kingdoms being to commence on the first of May that day was appointed for a public thanksgiving and the Queen went in state to St Paul's a ceremony of which to judge by its frequency she seemed to be extremely fond But though the union of the kingdoms had now commenced in the eye of the law it could scarce be considered as an entire and incorporating union The privycouncil of the kingdom the officers of state and the whole ministry were still maintained in Scotland The servants of the crown to retain their own authority as well as to preserve their emoluments persuaded the Queen that there was a necessity to preserve a shew of greatness and a form of government at Edinburgh to gratify the vanity of the vulgar  and to awe the Jacobites  Burnet vol iv  This doctrine continued to be inculcated on the government of England and the Scots instead of enjoying the benefit of a general government continued under the tyranny of a faction of their own countrymen  Distress of France  The proposals of peace offered by France having been rejected with marks of disdain by the allies Lewis the Fourteenth found himself obliged to make all possible preparations for continuing with some vigour the war The uncommon misfortunes of the last campaign had embarrassed his counsels and thrown his kingdom into the utmost distress and consternation The only circumstance in which he could not blame his fortune was that a very favourable season had provided his people with plenty of grain  Political annals  But he was in great want of money to pay his troops as well as to provide his armies with those implements of war which he had lost on every side to the enemy in the preceding summer To obtain a kind of remedy to this evil he fell upon an expedient which distressed the nation while it ruined the credit of government In imitation of the exchequerbills circulated by the government of England he issued bills upon the mint to the amount of seventy millions of livres  Ibid  But in refusing to take these bills in payment of the revenue he threw them into such discredit that after all expedients to raise their value had been tried they remained at the discount of near sixty per cent  Her preparations  Notwithstanding this domestic distress Lewis contrived to make considerable preparations against the efforts of the enemy He extended a line of militia along the coast of the ocean and the shore of the Mediterranean He formed an army in Flanders under the Duke de Vendôme Another was assembled by the Mareschal de Villars in the neighbourhood of Strasbourg A body of men was ordered to rendezvous in Navarre another in Roussillon and reinforcements were sent to the army commanded by the Duke of Berwick in Spain The year began with one instance of success on the part of France Majorca was retaken by the Count de Villars on the fifth of January But this transitory gleam of  good fortune was soon obscured by fresh disasters in Italy The French and Spanish troops were forced to evacuate Lombardy by a capitulation signed on the thirteenth of March Modena  Feb  and Milan surrendered themselves successively to the allies The whole kingdom of Naples was reduced either by the treachery of the inhabitants or the force of the enemy and the few places in the dominions of Savoy and in the Milanese that were still held by garrisons of French or Spaniards fell one by one before the end of the campaign  Hist de France tom iii    Battle of Almanza  The victory obtained at Almanza by the Duke of Berwick on the twentyfifth of April changed the whole face of affairs in Spain The English and Portugueze being possessed in the name of Charles the Third of the kingdoms of Catalonia Arragon and Valencia resolved under their generals the Earl of Galway and the Marquis LasMinas to penetrate into NewCastile Having for that purpose passed the river Xucar they advanced to Almanza The Duke of Berwick who had just arrived at the place hesitated not a moment to give them battle The action extended from wing to wing The English infantry penetrated the center of the enemy But the Portugueze foot giving way and Berwick's cavalry having at the same time thrown the horse of the allies in disorder the battle was soon decided in favour of the French Never victory was more complete Six thousand of the allies either lay dead on the field of battle or were slain in the pursuit Five general officers seven brigadiers twentyfive colonels above eight hundred other officers and nine thousand soldiers were either taken prisoners or being surrounded in the mountains were forced to surrender All the cannon standards colours equipage and baggage of the vanquished fell into the hands of the enemy LasMinas made his escape with some cavalry to Xativa The Earl of Galway with a party of horse taking the rout towards Catalonia stopt not his flight till he arrived at Tortosa near the mouth of the Ebro The Duke of Orleans taking the command of the French army the day after the battle pursued the victory with great vigour He took the city of Valencia on the eighth of May and the whole kingdom  followed the fate of the capital The victors directed their march to Arragon Sarragossa  May  and in general all Arragon were again reduced under the dominion of Philip the Fifth while his rival either loitered in Catalonia or made an ineffectual progress towards the frontiers of Roussillon  Hist d'Espagne    Campaign in Germany  On the side of Germany the affairs of the confederates wore the same gloomy aspect The usual sluggishness and backwardness of the Princes almost subjected the empire to the same misfortunes from which it had been relieved by the battle of Blenheim The continuance of the rebellion in Hungary combined with the habitual inactivity of the court of Vienna had rendered the efforts of the house of Austria extremely languid on the Upper Rhine The Margrave of Bareith who succeeded to the command of the Imperialists upon the death of the Prince of Baden led an army inconsiderable in point of numbers and illprovided with necessaries for the field The French army under the Mareschal de Villars having passed the Rhine at Strasbourg forced the lines at Stolhoffen laid the duchy of Wirtimberg under contribution entered Swabia and penetrated to the Danube But when Villars was meditating measures which might change the whole face of the war he was forced to weaken his army by great detachments into France itself which was now attacked within its limits by the allies Towards the end of the campaign the Elector of Hannover took the command of the army of the empire and Count Mercy having surprised the Marquis de Vivant at Offembourg the Mareschal de Villars was forced to abandon all his schemes and to repass the Rhine  Hist d'Allemagne tom vii Hist de France tom iii    Dictatorial behaviour of the King of Sweden  The invasion of the French was not the only evil which the Emperor and empire had now to fear The King of Sweden having remained during the winter in Saxony found very plausible pretences for a quarrel with the court of Vienna He complained of an insult committed by Count Zobor chamberlain to his Imperial Majesty on the Baron Stralenheim the Swedish envoy Though all reasonable satisfaction was given by the Emperor  the King of Sweden with an obstinacy suitable to his character increased his complaints and multiplied his demands He peremptorily reuired that five hundred Russians to whom the court of Vienna had given refuge in the Austrian dominions should be delivered into his hands He insisted that the Emperor should immediately decide the affair of the election of Lubec in favour of the administrator of Holstein That the Protestants of Silesia should be indulged with the free exercise of their religion according to the treaty of Westphalia That his Imperial Majesty should relinquish all pretensions to the quota which the King of Sweden had neglected to furnish according to the tenure by which he held his dominions in Germany and that the whole Swedish army in their return through Silesia and Poland should be maintained at the charge of the court of Vienna  Hist de Suede    He thrown wantonly the balance of Europe from his hands  The court of Vienna was by no means in a condition to refuse these dictatorial terms But the Queen of England and the States were alarmed lest the pride of the Emperor Joseph should overcome his attention to the interest of the allies Queen Anne therefore had determined early in the season to order the Duke of Marlborough to repair to Saxony to sooth the King of Sweden and to gain the ministers of that Prince The Duke no stranger himself to the power of money over mankind consulted the Elector of Hannover  Hannoverpapers  about the sums to be given as annual pensions to the Counts Piper and Hermelin who conducted the counsels of Charles the Twelfth The Elector advised that two thousand pounds sterling should be secured for the first and one thousand for the latter and that one year's pension should be paid in advance  Ibid  The Duke arriving at AltRanstadt where the King of Sweden held his head quarters was received with a degree of politeness considering the harsh and uncomplying character of that Prince Whether Marlborough gained Piper and Hermelin through the channel of their venality is uncertain as well as unimportant His negociations by the event seem to have been crowned with the desired effect though it is more likely that the King of Sweden yielded more to his own  resentment against the Czar than to the influence of corrupted ministers England and Holland having guaranteed the promises of the Emperor to the demands of Charles that Prince after having for more than a year kept the allies in suspence and actually held the balance of Europe threw the whole at once from his hands and repassing the Oder entered Poland in pursuit of fruitless victories  Hist de Nord tom ii    Siege of Toulon  The most memorable event of the year was the siege of Toulon and the miscarriage of the allies before that important place The reduction of the Spanish dominions in Italy and the capitulation signed at Milan in March by which the French army abandoned that country left the Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene at freedom to carry the war into the enemy's country In concert with England and Holland a project was formed either to destroy or take Toulon and Marseilles an enterprise if crowned with success which could not fail to be highly beneficial to the maritime powers as well as of great importance to the confederates in general The Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene having for some time amused the French with marches and countermarches turned suddenly toward the shore of the Mediterranean forced the passage of the river Var advanced along the coast of Provence and after a long march through a hot rugged and inhospitable country arrived before Toulon on the twentysixth of July Sir Cloudsley Shovel with a strong squadron of men of war attended the motions of the allies supplied the army with necessaries and blocked up the town by sea  Naval Hist M  Anecdotes    Deserted by the allies  Their want of intelligence and the necessary delays in their march disappointed the views of the allies upon the town Two hours before Prince Eugene arrived with the van the French found means to throw eight thousand men into the place The fortifications were repaired with incredible expedition Troops were advantageously posted on the hills adjacent to the walls The allies having taken the heights of St Catherine were driven from thence on the fourteenth of August with great slaughter The number of troops in Toulon and in  neighbourhood the bad condition of the confederate army and the intelligence received of the motions of the French on every side induced the generals to desist from their attempt The Duke of Burgundy with a considerable force was on his march to cut off their retreat from Nice Of twelve thousand horse scarce four thousand were fit for service in that rocky country the iron for shoes expected from Genoa having been detained by contrary winds Had the confederates therefore remained ten days longer before Toulon they would in all likelihood have been obliged to surrender prisoners of war such was their own weak condition and the activity used by the French to disappoint the design  MS Anecdo tes  Having bombarded the place the fleet and army retired in the night between the twentyfirst and the twentysecond of August  Inactive campaign in Flanders Losses at sea  In Flanders nothing of importance happened during the campaign The French under the Duke de Vendôme prudently avoided an action and they managed their motions so well that they furnished the enemy no opportunity of attacking them with advantage The principal operations at sea were confined to the fruitless siege of Toulon The Chevalier de Forbin had the good fortune of taking two English men of war with twenty merchantmen and what was still more fortunate for himself to make his escape after an engagement with a superior squadron Some advantages were obtained by the English on the coast of NorthAmerica But they sustained a very great loss in the shipwreck of Sir Cloudsley Shovel That admiral on the twentyninth of September sailed from Gibraltar with a fleet of fifteen ships of the line and some frigates Having arrived in the mouth of the channel on the night of the twentysecond of October by a mistake in his course he steered directly on some dangerous rocks to the westward of the islands of Scilly The Association the ship in which the admiral sailed struck and foundered at once not one of the crew being saved The same melancholy fate attended the Eagle and Romney and of the sailors on board the Firebrand another ship driven on the rocks only twentyfour and the captain were saved  Naval Hist  The fate of Shovel  was lamented by all He had raised himself by his industry and merit from a common sailor to the head of the fleet In his public conduct he was deemed brave vigilant and circumspect and in his private capacity he preserved the character of a modest and honest man  Reflections on the campaign  The campaign of the year though in some degree favourable to the house of Bourbon scarce suspended their misfortunes The conquest of Naples balanced the benefits derived from the victory obtained at Almanza and the siege of Toulon though unsuccessful on the part of the allies was extremely detrimental to France The enemy in their march and retreat through Provence ruined a great extent of country The attempt defeated the projects of France on the side of Germany by dividing her forces Villars having penetrated to the Danube was forced to repass the Rhine and to relinquish to an enemy who could not meet him before in the field all the advantages of a campaign that seemed to threaten to change the whole face of affairs A degree of mortification was added to the misfortunes of the court of Versailles The Duke of Savoy whose capital was besieged by a French army in the preceding campaign was at the head of a powerful invasion in the dominions of France in the present year But the conduct of the court of France was now as feeble as her misfortunes were numerous The Salique law seemed to have been made in vain in a country destined to be governed and ruined by women Madame de Maintenon though advanced in years maintained her influence over the superannuated mind of the King Flattery to an aged mistress became a better title than merit to the command of armies and thus the folly of his own councils became as fatal to Lewis as the arms of the confederates  CHAP VII  Discontents in ScotlandIntrigues of FranceHooke's negociationsSecret

respective parliaments by a great majority that measure was far from receiving the general sanction of the people Men who were apt to urge speculative arguments against expediency affirmed with a degree of justice that no representative of a nation had a right to dissolve the constitution from which  they derived their own political existence The generality of the Scotish nation either swayed by their pride or yielding to their prejudices were loud in their complaints and wanted nothing but leaders to appeal from their parliament to the decision of the sword The populace in particular were so eager to take up arms that the nobility and chiefs were forced to avoid mixing with their vassals for fear of being insulted for not leading them directly to the field  Hooke's Negociations  The minister of England in the mean time either from negligence or design  Stuartpapers  had made no preparations against the sudden incursion of a people whom he knew to be inflamed to a degree of madness  Intrigues of France  Happily for England and perhaps ultimately for the Scots themselves the court of France was still more destitute of counsels than of power Instead of listening to the earnest solicitations of the malecontents in sending the Pretender with a force sufficient to protect his person to Scotland they dispatched colonel Hooke into that kingdom with instructions more calculated to depress the spirits of the Jacobites than to rouse them to arms Hooke arriving soon after the recess of parliament made a secret progress through the northern counties and presented to the leaders of the Jacobites letters from the King of France as well as from the Pretender The Dukes of Gordon and Athol the Earls of Errol Marishal Panmure and Strathmore the Viscount Stormont and in general all the nobility and gentry to the North of the Forth and many whose estates lay to the South of that river received him with gladness and expressed their readiness to take up arms for the exiled family Their enthusiasm in favour of the Pretender and aversion to the Union were so great that though it was apparent Hooke's object was to engage them in every thing and the French King in nothing they signed a general memorial referring implicitly the expected aid from France to the generosity of Lewis the Fourteenth  Hooke's negociations  In this memorial after a complimentary preamble to the French King they signified their earnest desire that the Pretender should be immediately sent to Scotland They affirmed that upon his arrival he should be received  without opposition as king and that the established government would instantly vanish without making the least effort for its own support Out of the great number of men that were to be led by his adherents to his standard they proposed to select twentyfive thousand foot and five thousand horse These they promised to clothe to arm and to provide with provisions till they should march into England But upon that event they insinuated that a monthly subsidy ought to be paid by France should the war be prolonged for any time by the resistance of the English nation to the person whom the memorialists called their lawful King They solemnly assured the most Christian King that the whole kingdom from an aversion to the Union were unanimous in their wishes for the restoration of the exiled family and that as they threw themselves under his Majesty's protection they were confident he would effectually support their cause They however left the time the manner and the strength to be sent entirely to himself The whole strain of the memorial was spiritless though vehement It expressed an enthusiasm for an immediate insurrection which Lewis had he been more attentive to his own interest might have greatly improved to his advantage  Hooke's Negociations    Conduct of the court of St Germains  Together with this memorial Hooke was charged with letters from the leaders of the malecontents to the Pretender and the French ministry Having arrived in France in the month of July he laid the substance of his negociations before the court of Versailles The Earl of Middleton who managed the affairs of the Pretender attempted to add the weight of argument to the offers and solicitations of the Scots He endeavoured to establish the probability of the success of an insurrection in Scotland by the recent and stillexisting resistance of the Hungarians against the forces and efforts of the court of Vienna He mentioned as an example of the same kind the insurrection in the Cevennes where a few peasants without any succours from abroad maintained themselves so long against regular troops commanded by Mareschals of France He averred that nothing was so well calculated to terminate a war as to carry it into the enemy's country The King of Sweden he said after  a series of victories for five years in Poland found new enemies rising as it were from the blood of the slain till by making a sudden irruption into Saxony he put at once an end to the war and the reign of King Augustus He affirmed that the enemies of France were convinced of the justness of these maxims as appeared from their efforts in Spain their attempts upon the Moselle their project of a descent on the coast of the ocean and the present invasion of the Duke of Savoy along the shore of the Mediterranean  Middleton to M de Chamillart MS    Secret views of the Earl of Godolphin  The representations of Hooke the arguments of Middleton and the repeated and vehement solicitations of the Scots themselves were lost on the court of Versailles Happily for Great Britain the measures of the French ministry were too much disconcerted with an invasion of their own country to think of carrying the war into that of the enemy The sullen silence which arose in Scotland from the anxious expectations of the discontented was in the mean time mistaken by the superficial for an acquiescence in the Union between the kingdoms The affairs of England in like manner wore the face of tranquillity The attention of the people being turned to the operations of the war the bickerings between parties were either forgot or neglected But to those who from judicious observations on the past could penetrate into the future a storm seemed to be gathering behind the transient sunshine which to use a metaphor enlightened at present the kingdom The lordtreasurer thinking perhaps that he had gone too far in opposition to his principles in accomplishing the Union seemed from his conduct little anxious about its continuance Every measure calculated to exasperate the Scots against that treaty was adopted Though the revenue of Scotland had fallen under the management of the treasury in England on the first of May no care had been taken to issue commissions for new officers  Suspected of a design to break the Union  The whole trade of the kingdom was suspended for two months through this negligence while in consequence of an act lately passed seizures were made o  foreign goods imported from Scotland under a pretenc  that they had been sent to that country to avoid the pay+ment  of duties from which all imports from thence had been exempted by the treaty of Union  Burnet vol iv  These measures calculated to irritate the Scotish nation against the English were accompanied with an internal relaxation of government which raised a suspicion that the minister if not the Court was in the interest of the exiled family The correspondence maintained between France and Scotland was no secret But it passed without animadversion and no notice was taken of public rejoicings celebrated at Edinburgh and other parts of Scotland on the birthday of the Pretender The Scots considering all government in a manner dissolved by what they called the illegality of the Union were at no pains to conceal their sentiments yet such was the supineness of the minister that he seemed to court an insurrection and even an invasion  Stuartpapers    Marlborough's secret intrigues  During this suspicious conduct of Godolphin he and the Duke of Marlborough continued to make their usual assurances of fidelity and attachment to the court of St Germains  Stuartpapers  The Duke in particular seemed to insinuate to their agents that one cause of rejecting the proposals of peace offered by France was their not comprehending any stipulations in favour of the exiled family  Stuartpapers April  The conduct of Marlborough with regard to that unfortunate race is unaccountable except on the footing of principle Neglected by the French and without resources themselves they were scarce worthy of being deceived should they even have the weakness to place any confidence in promises so often and so ineffectually made Had their conviction of Marlborough's sincerity been equal to the opinion which the world had formed of his power they might at least suppose that their own misfortunes were drawing to an end The Queen was in the possession of his Dutchess The affairs of the nation were either in the hands of his friends or in his own The lordtreasurer who guided the whole line of internal business was inseperably connected with the fortune of his family The Earl of Sunderland his soninlaw as secretary of state was possessed of the secrets of the kingdom and either the splendour of his  own actions or the art of his conduct had rendered parliament in a manner subservient to his views  Intrigues in the cabinet  Notwithstanding this appearance of firmness in the fabric reared by Marlborough it was secretly undermined in a manner that threatened its fall The Whigs either suspecting the principles of Godolphin or what is more probable from views upon his office and influence were preparing to attack his measures in parliament  Duke of Hamilton to the Pretender May  They were no strangers to his political cowardice and they were determined to derive some advantage to themselves from his weakness But when preparations were making against him without he was privately attacked within the cabinet A new female favourite had in a great measure supplanted the Duchess of Marlborough in the affections of the Queen or rather in the dominion which she had established over the mind of that timid and easy princess Mr Harley who had been secretary of state for some years had gained a considerable degree of credit with the Queen To strengthen his own interest he secured the confidence and assistance of the new favourite The great weight and the almost irresistible power which Marlborough and the connexions of his family had established could not have failed to raise in some degree the jealousy of the Queen who was actually a mere cypher in their hands She therefore listened to the suggestions of Harley who presuming on the manifest change in the mind of the sovereign began to act no longer in dependence on the minister  Burnet vol iv    Opposition formed  While Harley employed his intrigues in the closet against Marlborough and Godolphin a formidable opposition to their measures was preparing against the meeting of parliament As long as the people were amused with splendid victories abroad they complained not of the burden of the war at home But when the progress of conquest was stopt by the misfortune at Almanza and the raising of the siege of Toulon a general inclination for peace appeared in the nation The Whigs offended in the person of one of their leaders encouraged this pacific disposition among the people The Lord Wharton  forgetting the animosity between the Whigs and the Tories in his own resentment against the ministry had paid a visit to the Earl of Nottingham with propositions to join the highchurch party to humble Marlborough and Godolphin The latter noblemen from views of their own were highly averse to pacific measures But the current ran violently against the war till Marlborough returned to the kingdom The chief reason opposed by the Duke to a peace was that France presuming on her success at Almanza had receded from the terms which she had offered the preceding year He pretended that Lewis the Fourteenth had then promised to restore Spain and the Indies The recovery of the whole Spanish monarchy out of the hands of the house of Bourbon he knew had been the chief object of the English nation in their warm prosecution of the war from the hopes that they had conceived of the great mercantile advantages resulting from a treaty already concluded with the house of Austria The Duke insinuated that to obtain that great object there was a necessity for continuing the war and this argument though founded on a misrepresentation of the fact had great weight with the trading part of the nation  Stuartpapers Hook's Negociations    First parliament of GreatBritain  During these intrigues on both sides the first parliament of Great Britain met at Westminster The Queen coming to the house of peers on the twentythird of October directed the commons to chuse a Speaker Many considered this ceremony unnecessary as the parliament had not been dissolved but dropt and afterwards renewed by proclamation in terms of an act for that purpose All disputes concerning the legality of the election of a speaker were prevented by Smith's being again placed in the chair On the sixth of November the Queen as usual made a speech from the throne To a brief detail of the state of affairs abroad she annexed the customary demand of supplies and concluded with exhortations to affection toward her own person and government and unanimity among themselves The commons having approved of the Queen's speech voted an address of thanks on the tenth of November The house of peers however  were not equally complaisant The discontents of some disappointed lords joined several votes to the standing party against Marlborough and Godolphin When an address to the throne was moved a motion for considering first the state of the nation was carried A zeal for the redress of public evils arose in proportion to the height of private resentment Whigs and Tories were promiscuously in opposition The leaders of the first had been too much neglected in the distribution of places The latter had neither forgot nor forgiven the means that had been used to deprive them of power  MS of the Times  Great opposition in the house of lords  Though many followed the bent of their own passions in the opposition with which the session was opened in the house of lords it must be confessed that there was matter of just complaint The Duke of Marlborough with all his abilities and success in the field suffered acts of meanness selfishness and avarice to stain the fame which he had acquired in the world The Earl of Godolphin though a man of abilities carried the indolence illtemper and peevishness of his private character into his public conduct The reputation which both had acquired with a degree of justice in their respective departments had a visible effect on their own minds The selfsufficiency which is seldom separated from success had rendered them negligent of men who possessed abilities to support their measures in parliament Instead of permitting the places and emoluments of government to run in the channel of parliamentary interest they gratified their own friends and dependents and thus by excluding the ambitious from office they furnished them with leisure as well as with resentment to oppose their own measures  Inquiry into mismanagements in the admiralty  The lords resolving themselves into a committee of their whole house to consider of the state of the nation a petition was presented in the name of more than two hundred merchants of London complaining of great losses at sea for want of cruizers and convoys In the prosecution of the inquiry great abuses were discovered in the department of the admiralty which was managed by a council in the name of the Prince of Denmark who bore the name but not the power of lord admiral The committee having made a very unfavourable report  to the house it was transmitted to the Prince of Denmark An answer was returned in his name which attempted to justify the several charges contained in the report But the most remarkable part of the paper was its conclusion which contained very severe strictures on the management of sea affairs in the late reign In the war carried on by King William it appeared that four thousand merchantmen had been taken by the enemy which at a medium fell little short of five hundred ships every year The truth is that during the two reigns which immediately succeeded the Revolution naval affairs were much neglected Great fleets were equipped to second the operations by land while the trade of the nation was left a prey to flying squadrons and privateers  Journals of the lords    Affairs in Spain examined  Though the Prince of Denmark was neither blamed in the debates nor mentioned in the report of the committee the Queen was highly offended She however made a general answer to the address of the lords and promised to protect the trade of her subjects The inquiry into the state of naval affairs was succeeded by an examination into the military operations in Spain where the first success of the English nation had terminated in loss and disgrace The Earl of Peterborough who had performed signal services in that kingdom had been recalled in the preceding August The Tories in opposition to the Earl of Galway magnified the merit of Peterborough while the Whigs made severe remarks on his conduct A written complaint against Peterborough had been transmitted by King Charles to England The paper was laid before the two houses But Peterborough in his own justification produced such a number of witnesses and papers that the parliament aster spending two weeks on the subject were so much tired of Spanish affairs and the Earl that they dropt both without any animadversion  Ibid    Proceedings on Scotish affairs  The commons less censorious and refractory than the lords granted without hesitation the demanded supplies    They turned at the same time their attention to matters of more importance than inquiries which were scarce intended even by those who promoted them to procure redress To abate the resentment of the Scots  against the Union they addressed the Queen  Journals of the commons Nov  to issue a  noli prosequi  to discharge the several informations with regard to goods imported customfree into Scotland before the first of May They however introduced a bill for repealing the famous act of security with had so much inflamed the Scots and alarmed the English nation In considering that part of her Majesty's speech which required the parliament to make the Union more complete they came to several important resolves They voted that there should be but one privy council in Great Britain That the militia of Scotland should be placed on the same footing with that of England That the powers of justices of the peace should be the same throughout the united kingdom That for the better and more expeditious administration of justice the lords of justiciary should go circuits twice a year and that the writs for electing members to serve in parliament for Scotland should be returned in the same manner as in England  Dec  A bill brought in upon these resolutions passed with little difficulty the two houses  An universal zeal for continuing the war  During these proceedings the warmest and most universal zeal for carrying on the war with the utmost vigour was exhibited by the two houses The lords resolved that no peace could be safe or honourable for her Majesty or for the allies should Spain and the West Indies remain in the power of the house of Bourbon The commons having concurred with the lords in an address containing this resolution the two houses presented the same in a body on the twentythird of December  Dec  The Queen in her answer assured her parliament that she was fully of opinion that no peace could either be sase or honourable till the entire monarchy of Spain should be restored to the house of Austria She at the same time promised in compliance with the other articles of their address to continue her most pressing instances to the Emperor to hasten further succours for Spain under the command of the Prince of Savoy The court of Vienna however were not equally sanguine with their very generous allies in their own cause The in+stances  if made were ineffectual The languor and undecisive measures of Germany continued England with the true spirit of knighterrantry squandered her blood and exhausted her treasures in prosecuting a war from which it was not even pretended she was to derive either territory or power  Intrigues of Harley  Though this vehemence for continuing the war with such vigour was highly suitable to the inclinations of the Duke of Marlborough and consequently to those of the Earl of Godolphin they still found themselves uneasy in their departments The intrigues of Harley in conjunction with Mrs Masham the new favourite had already disturbed their counsels in the cabinet The effects of this secret influence had even extended themselves to the two houses of parliament  Burnet vol iv Dutchess of Marlborough's con    Harley who perhaps was not entirely ignorant of the attachment of Marlborough and Godolphin to the exiled family found means to raise the jealousy of the Whigs while at the same time he was said to have contrived to foment the bad humour of the Tories against the management of public affairs An accident however furnished the enemies of Harley with an opportunity of revenge The Mareschal de Tallard still a prisoner in England wrote frequently to Chamillart one of the ministers of Lewis the Fourteenth But he sent his letters to the secretary's office where they were perused and sealed Harley ignorant himself of the French language  Stuartpapers Hannoverpapers MSS passim  was obliged to trust the perusal of Tallard's letters to one Greg a clerk in his office Greg being an abandoned and profligate fellow hoped to derive advantage from this circumstance He inclosed in a letter from the Mareschal one from himself offering his own services He promised for a valuable consideration to betray his country to the court of France and as a specimen of his abilities to discharge his engagements wrote an account of some important transactions This letter was intercepted in Flanders and sent back to London Greg was seized  ied and condemned    Though Harley could not possibly be supposed to know any thing of the matter his reputation through the art of his opponents suffered considerably  with the more credulous and suspicious part of mankind  Publications of the times    He is dismissed from office  This circumstance might have shaken the credit of Harley with the nation He still retained his influence with the Queen The principles avowed publickly by the Tories being most agreeable to all sovereigns Anne seems to have entertained an affection for that party when even she excluded them from office Marlborough and Godolphin as far as they were swayed by principle were in the interest of the excluded family But they had employed the Whigs as more active and better acquantined with business  MS anecdote  than the Tories They had always found the latter as unsteady in their conduct as they were violent in their schemes Harley though bred a dissenter and having all along avowed whiggish principles sacrificed his opinions to his love of power and by flattering the prejudices of the Queen in favour of the excluded party hoped to govern the nation through their support and assistance But though he was possessed of courage to undertake the administration of affairs on these terms the times were not yet ripe for so precipitate a change The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Godolphin complained of Harley's intrigues to the Queen But that Princess heard them without being moved They resolved therefore to extort from her fears what they could not derive from her prudence They threatened both to resign their places and the dismission of Harley from the office of secretary of state  Feb  was preferred by the Queen as the least evil Sir Simon Harcourt the attorneygeneral Henry St John secretary at war and Mansel comptroller of the household chose to follow Harley's fortune and resigned at the same time their places  Feb    Opposition in parliament  Neither Harley nor the associates of his fortune were likely to sit down quietly in their present state of disgrace They had been from the beginning of the session at the bottom of the inquiries made in both houses into the conduct of the war and now they had added resentment to what formerly was only ambition On the third of February the commons had addressed the Queen demanding  to be informed why a greater number of English forces had not been in Spain and Portugal at the time of the battle of Almanza The answer of the Queen was delayed to the eighteenth and when it was received it was deemed unsatisfactory The lords continuing their inquiries into the state of naval affairs presented a long address against the mismanagements in that department Upon the whole the complexion of both houses seemed greatly altered with regard to the ministry The weight of government had secured hitherto a majority upon the most trying questions in the house of commons But the Tories in conjunction with the disappointed part of the Whigs contrived to carry motions in the house of lords highly disagreeable to those who had the chief management of public affairs  Journals    An invasion threatened from France  A sudden alarm from abroad by terrifying at once the sovereign and the people strengthened the hands of the ministry and disappointed the views of the discontented The court of France had almost always been averse to an invasion of Great Britain and particularly in the preceding summer They however suffered themselves in appearance to be reconciled in the winter to that measure through the vehement solicitations of the Scots and the pressing instances of the excluded family A squadron of small men of war consisting of five ships equipped for action and two fitted for transports together with twentyone frigates were prepared at Dunkirk while several battalions were ordered to march to that place from the garrisons of Calais St Omers Bergues Aire and Lisle  Hooke's negociations  The preparations were carried on with expedition and secresy and when they came first to be known it was uncertain where the storm was to fall Men could scarce believe that an invasion of Great Britain was seriously meant by the enemy without a fleet of capital ships and therefore the States of the United Provinces began to be extremely apprehensive of a descent on the coast of Zealand  Public intelligence    Preparations in Great Britain  General Cadogan who resided at the Hague in qua  ty of ambassador from the court of Great Britain obtained the first intelligence of the real destination of the  armament preparing at Dunkirk The information given by Cadogan to the ministry was confirmed by the news of the arrival of the pretended Prince of Wales at Dunkirk in the end of the month of February Boyle who had succeeded Harley as secretary of state communicated his intelligence by the command of the Queen to the house of commons on the fourth of March  Journals March  The two houses as upon all occasions of danger joined in the usual address of lives and fortunes and the commons to strengthen the hands of government introduced a bill for suspending the act of  habeas corpus  The preparations of the ministry kept pace with the zeal of parliament Sir George Byng with a squadron of twentythree ships of war had already stretched over to Dunkirk Ten battalions of English troops were ordered from Flanders The forces in England were every where in motion and the regiments quartered in the south of Ireland were ordered to march towards the north for the convenience of a short passage to Scotland where the French had formed a design to land  Hist of Europe    French sail from Dunkirk  The fleet under Byng having been driven back by strong winds to the Downs the French squadron sailed from Dunkirk on the sixth of March To deceive the British admiral should he return to his station they had placed an equal number of vessels in the road The squadron was commanded by M de Fourbin The Pretender under the name of Chevalier de St George was on board with five thousand one hundred soldiers with ten thousand muskets one thousand pistols and as many carabines The weather becoming calm the squadron was forced to come to an anchor before Newport During two days of bad weather which detained them in that place three frigates having made signals of distress bore away for Dunkirk having eight hundred land forces on board Weakened by this desertion the admiral called a council of war to consider whether they should continue their voyage to Scotland The Chevalier himself decided in the affirmative They accordingly sailed in the night of the eighth of March with a brisk and favourable gale On the twelfth they discovered the coas  of Scotland But either through the ignorance of thei  pilots or the design of M de Fourbin who is said to have had positive orders neither to land the troops nor to hazard the loss of the squadron  Lockhart's Mem  they found themselves to the north of the firth of Edinburgh where they had proposed to land  They return  On the same day that the French fleet sailed from Dunkirk Sir George Byng whose squadron by the incredible diligence of the admiralty had been now augmented to forty capital ships besides frigates weighed anchor in the Downs and stretched over towards Dunkirk Being informed of the sailing of the enemy by a boat from Ostend he crowded after them with all his sails and came in sight of the French with his van on the morning of the thirteenth of March M de Fourbin took advantage of the wind and put to sea In the afternoon of the same day some of the enemy's ships came up with the Auguste a French man of war and a kind of running fight began The Chevalier de St George during this action entreated Fourbin with the utmost earnestness to put him on shore being resolved he said to remain in Scotland should none follow him but his own domestics  M d'Andrezel's account to the French ministry April N S  Fourbin having long argued in vain against the propriety of that measure positively refused at last to agree to his request The French in the mean time were dispersed in their confused flight The Salisbury a vessel some time before taken from the English was the only ship that fell into the hands of Byng The rest having suffered much hardship at sea and lost many of their men by sickness returned ship by ship to Dunkirk  Hooke's negociations    Observations  Though the armament for the invasion of Scotland seems rather to have been extorted from Lewis the Fourteenth by the solicitations of the malecontents than intended for a serious diversion to the British arms there is reason to believe that the failure of the scheme before any landing was made proved of the utmost importance to the safety of government as it then stood The state of Scotland was in every respect favourable to at least the temporary success of the design The  most of the nobles fourfifths of the gentry and perhaps a greater proportion of the common people were inflamed into a degree of despair at what they deemed the indignity of the terms of Union between the two kingdoms The injudicious violence with which the new laws for collecting the revenue were introduced into Scotland bore the appearance of a design in the minister to rouse the inhabitants to some desperate attempt to break a treaty which he himself had accomplished with such appearance of zeal Swarms of surveyors collectors and other officers were sent from England These executed the new regulations with a rigour more suitable to the indignities that accompany conquest than to the rights of a free people The friends of the excluded family fomented with success the public resentment against the English government Many formerly averse to the restoration of the Stuarts now desired it with the utmost vehemence as the only means to avoid a yoke which they deemed the more grievous and insupportable that it was unexpected and new  State of Scotland MS    on the projected invasion  The English minister with unpardonable negligence or perhaps with design  Burnet vol iv Stuartpapers  had at the same time left the kingdom in a defenceless condition The castles and forts were in a ruinous situation and destitute of military stores There were only two thousand five hundred regular troops in Scotland and these were known to be disaffected The money for the equivalent was at the same time in the castle of Edinburgh That fortress was not in a state to defeat the slightest effort of an enemy  Hooke's Negociations  A Dutch fleet had just run aground on the coast of the county of Angus with ammunition cannon muskets and money The act of security had placed arms in the hands of the lower sort of people of which they had not yet been deprived by the repeal of that law The Highlanders though from the situation of their country and the state of society established among the clans they felt not the supposed grievances of the Union were from a national pride attached to a race of Princes whom they deemed their countrymen The officers of government in Scotland were so sensible of the untenable condition  of that country that they had already made preparations for taking refuge in the town of Berwick The immediate submission of the whole kingdom and a general acknowledgment of his authority would therefore have been the infallible consequence of the Pretender's landing with the appearance of a regular force  Hooke's Negociations    Views of the Scotish Jacobites  The discontented Scots had formed a resolution of invading England as soon as their own country should submit itself to the authority of the person whom they called their lawful King They proposed with seventeen thousand foot and three thousand horse of their own nation in conjunction with their French auxiliaries to distress London by the immediate seizure of Newcastle and by stopping the coaltrade The regular force to the south of the Tweed was incapable of meeting the Scots in the field In Flanders there were only eighteen British regiments and one third of these were their countrymen The latter instead of opposing their projects would they hoped join and forward their views They knew that without the consent of parliament the Queen could not call  Ibid Stuart papers passim  any foreign troops to her aid Besides they derived expectations from negociation as well as from force The dissolution of the Union the repeal of the act of settlement the present possession of Scotland the eventual succession of England to her brother they hoped to derive all from the fears and perhaps from the affection of the Queen Should matters come to extremity they knew that Marlborough would in all likelihood have the chief command They hoped that such a favourable opportunity would induce that nobleman to perform his promises and oaths to the excluded family  Stuart papers passim  They built much on the attachment of the Tories the confusion of the Whigs the total breach in public credit the terrors of the affluent the expectations of the needy and the love of novelty in all  Observations  Wild as these expectations of the Scotish Jacobites may now appear they were deemed by no means extravagant in the eyes of men acquainted with the state of the kingdom and the disposition of the times The project seemed so practicable to the Duke of Marlborough  that he chided the court of St Germains for not having previously informed him of their design  Stuartpapers May  The Queen and her minister the Earl of Godolphin were guided by passions that favoured the most sanguine hopes of the adherents of the excluded line They were both subject to political terror both attached to the eventual succession of the Pretender and there is scarce any reason to doubt but they would both agree with great readiness to any proposals to secure the reversion of the crown of England to the ancient line  Reflections Stuartpapers MS  Happily for the kingdom the retreat of the French put an end to the fears of the people and prevented perhaps the horrors of a civil war Some mischief however was effected in Britain by this impotent attempt on the part of France A violent run upon the bank threatened the ruin of public credit and though the treasury and some nobleman of wealth tendered their assistance the evil only ceased with the terrors of the nation  Parliament dissolved  The two houses continued sitting during the alarm of the invasion But nothing important was transacted after the moneybills had passed for the service of the approaching campaign On the thirteenth of April the parliament was prorogued and two days after dissolved by proclamation The messengers of government were in the mean time employed in taking into custody the lords and gentlemen in Scotland who were most suspected of having invited the French to invade the kingdom Though all who were seized were deeply concerned in the conspiracy against government proofs could be carried home to none The most of the prisoners were therefore dismissed upon bail A prudent lenity was even observed toward persons already legally convicted of treason In the Salisbury the only ship which had fallen into the hands of the British fleet the Lord Griffin who had followed the late King James to France was taken and received sentence of death on a former outlawry His great age induced the Queen to reprieve him from time to time till a natural death by preventing the hand of public justice put an end to his misfortunes and his fears  Campaign in Flanders  During these transactions in England preparations were made abroad for opening with vigour the campaign The Duke of Marlborough having left London on the twentyninth of March arrived the next evening at the Hague where he was met by Prince Eugene of Savoy These two generals having settled with the States the operations of the summer repaired by different roads to Hannover to reconcile the Elector to the regulations which they had settled without his communication with regard to the army which his Highness commanded in the close of the preceding year on the UpperRhine The Duke of Marlborough having placed himself at the head of the confederates in the neighbourhood of Ghent in the end of May the French took the field on that side with an army superior to the allies in point of number They were commanded in the name of the Duke of Burgundy by the Duke de Vendôme Though they were possessed of strength sufficient to cope with the enemy in the field they chose rather to rely on stratagem and surprise than on the more uncertain success of open force The Elector of Bavaria during his long government in Flanders had gained an influence among the Flemings which he retained after the greatest part of the country had been lost to the allies in the fatal battle of Ramillies He either obtained by his intrigues or purchased with the money of France an absolute promise from the magistrates of the cities of Ghent Antwerp and Bruges to open their gates to the troops of the house of Bourbon The extortions of the allies of which neither Marlborough nor his friend Cadogan had been unconcerned spectators  Mem of the Generality of Ghent MS  contributed to this projected revolt as much as the intrigues of the Elector of Bavaria  Battle of Oudenarde  The two armies having remained in their respective camps the whole month of June a body of French troops were received into the city of Ghent under the appearance of a surprise on the fifth of July Bruges surrendered itself the next day in like manner to another detachment of the same army The Duke of Marlborough accused perhaps very unjustly of being privy to the treachery from interested views was incapable of preventing its effects Though much inferior in force to  the enemy he offered them battle which they avoided by passing the Dender in the night  July  The opportunity which the French generals now denied to the enemy was soon offered by their own disputes Returning from the Dender they directed their march to the Scheld But the Duke of Marlborough who had been joined by Prince Eugene had already passed that river and lay between the French and their lines The enemy could no longer decline battle The Scheld with several inclosures covered their left A morass ran along their front and on a rising ground on their right they placed their cavalry interlined with bodies of foot  Mem du Marq de Feuquiere    French partially defeated  The infantry of the allies advancing across the morass were received with great resolution and spirit by the enemy But the British cavalry broke those of the French at the first shock while the foot intermixed with the squadrons were cut to pieces on the plain The infantry behind the morass stood their ground for some time against all the efforts of the allies To avoid however being flanked by the British horse who were now victorious they sheltered themselves in the inclosures on the banks of the Scheld The battle however was by no means decisive But the fears and bad conduct of the French yielded to the allies all the consequences of a compleat victory No baggage no cannon were lost It was the repulse of a party rather than a general rout The allies expected nothing but the renewal of battle upon better terms the next morning But the French retreated through five different routes in the night The general confusion and panic which prevailed in this disgraceful and disorderly retreat by breaking the spirits of the soldiers disconcerted all the measures of the French generals for the rest of the campaign  French Writers passim    Their retreat and the siege of Lisle  Discomfited in their own minds the French instead of retrieving the honour which they had lost plunged themselves deeper in disgrace and misfortune They retired from Ghent under Tournay and under Ypres They permitted Prince Eugene whose reinforcement of Germans from the Moselle was now arrived to form the siege of Lisle That city fortified with all the art of  Vauban was considered as the key to France itself on that side The Mareschal de Boufflers defended in persons with a numerous garrison the capital of his own government The particulars of sieges are not interesting at any considerable distance of time The Duke of Vendôme attempted in vain to relieve the place by endeavouring to cut off the convoys of the enemy from beyond the Scheld and from Ostend In attacking a party of English at Winnendal a French detachment was defeated with the loss of their cannon and all their implements of war In attempting to attack the enemy before Lisle though joined by the Duke of Berwick with a great reinforcement Vendôme was twice disappointed after a fruitless cannonade The city in the mean time was gallantly defended by the Mareschal de Boufflers After a siege of three months it was however forced to surrender  Oct  Boufflers retired with the remains of the garrison into the citadel which he held till the eighth of December  Observations  No fortified place was ever more vigorously attacked none more gallantly defended than the important town of Lisle The besiegers carried no part of the works without a regular and obstinate battle and they were scarce masters of one place when they were driven from another and put in danger of being forced to yield the advantages which they had gained with so much valour and blood But the difficulties of the allies were not ended with the conquest of Lisle They had lost between eighteen and twenty thousand men before the place which had rendered their army much inferior to the French They were at the same time under the necessity of repassing the Scheld or to distribute the troops in winterquarters in the small space of country comprehended between Lisle Menin and Courtray To pass a river whose banks were occupied by an enemy superior in number was dangerous as well as difficult To remain in the neighbourhood of Lisle for the winter would have been to abandon the rest of Flanders the province of Brabant Guelderland and a part of the territories of the States to the mercy of the French The Duke of Marlborough who always treated fortune as if she had made an agreement to favour all his designs  attempted at once the passage of the Scheld and he succeeded without drawing a sword  Nov    Siege of Brussels raised Ghent and Bruges recovered  The raising of the siege of Brussels was the first consequence of Marlborough's passing the Scheld The Elector of Bavaria had sat down before that place the day before the allies had crossed the river Had his Highness invested Brussels when the enemy were fully employed at Lisle the city must have fallen into his hands But upon the approach of the allies he decamped with the utmost precipitation leaving behind him all his cannon ammunition and wounded The cities which the French had recovered through the treachery of the magistrates were again lost to the enemy The retaking of Bruges and Plassendal followed immediately the passage of the Scheld Ghent surrendered after a feeble resistance about the middle of December At the close of a campaign where every motion of the French was marked with some loss or some error the Duke of Vendôme went to Versailles He durst not pass through Paris dreading the consequences of the public hatred which his conduct had raised Irritated by his cold reception at court he retired to one of his estates being the fifth Mareschal of France whom Marlborough's success had driven from the service  Corrupt practices of Marlborough  The glory acquired by the Duke of Marlborough in recovering the towns which their respective magistrates had betrayed to France was much tarnished by his own avarice a vice to which of all others he was most subject When in consequence of the battle of Ramillies the greatest part of Flanders was reduced by the allies the chief management of the conquered country fell into the hands of general Cadogan who succeeded Mr Stepney as ambassador from England to the States of Holland  MS Memorial to Queen Anne Original papers  Cadogan a man of a profligate and avaricious character had recommended himself to the protection and friendship of the Duke of Marlborough by giving him the largest proportion of the contributions which he had privately raised from the magistrates of Ghent under the promise of his own and the Duke's protection Marlborough who had received at that period six  thousand pistoles in specie was so well pleased with the magistracy that at their request he reversed by his own authority the regulation for the government which had been signed by himself and the deputies of the States of Holland on the sixth of October These regulations it seems interfered with the perquisites of those who had been so liberal to himself Their gratitude and his protection continued The magistrates pillaged the people and the Duke and Cadogan received their proportion of the spoil  MS Memorial to Queen Anne Original papers    and General Cadogan  The people thus oppressed by their magistrates formed the worst opinion of the patrons of persons so unjust and profligate They believed though probably without foundation that Marlborough and Cadogan were privy to the measure of betraying Ghent and Bruges to the French from interested views of their own  Ibid  The conduct of these generals after retaking the two cities was calculated to justify suspicions of the worst kind Though they knew perfectly the treason and were fully informed concerning the traitors they not only procured for them a general pardon but continued them notwithstanding the murmurs of an oppressed people in their former offices and authority  Ibid  A favour so great was not without an immediate and suitable reward Two hundred thousand guelders are said to have fallen to the share of Marlborough  Ibid  Cadogan the intermediate agent in this lucrative transaction received ten thousand pistoles A magistracy so generous deserved to be supported They were therefore permitted to remain in their departments during the war though they were known to be in correspondence as well as friendship with France and though according to the customs and privileges of the country they ought to have been changed every year  Ibid    Campaign on the UpperRhine and in Savoy  In Germany nothing of importance happened during the campaign The Electors of Bavaria and Hannover who were opposed to one another on the UpperRhine were rendered incapable of performing any thing either worthy of themselves or of consequence to their respective allies The campaign was spent in fortifying their  lines as neither was in any condition to act with effect in the field The French army was weakened by detachments sent to Flanders The troops of the empire were destitute of every thing necessary for war  Hannoverpapers  On the side of Italy where much was expected nothing decisive was performed The Duke of Savoy had made great preparations in the winter but it was late in the summer before he took the field Besides his native troops he had twentytwo thousand men in his army in the pay of Great Britain and the States That Prince had formed great and extensive projects He designed to pass through the territories of the Swiss to join the troops of the empire in Alsace and to penetrate into France on that side He was opposed by the Mareschal de Villars But notwithstanding the vigilance of that officer the Duke found means by making himself master of Exilles La Perouse and Fenestrelles to open a passage into France while he secured his own dominions against future invasions from that kingdom  Hist d'Angleterre tom ii    Affairs of Spain  In Spain which had been the principal object of the war the allies were least successful The house of Bourbon had three armies in the field two on the side of Catalonia under the Duke of Orleans and the Duke de Noailles and the third in Estramadura commanded by the Marquis de Bay Though Charles the Third had not a force sufficient to face the Duke of Orleans in the field the latter was prevented from making any decisive progress by the unprovided condition of his army He however took Tortosa on the eleventh of July Denia and Alicant in the kingdom of Valencia fell into the hands of the French before the end of the campaign The Duke de Noailles opposed by the Prince of Darmstads performed nothing of importance except providing his troops with provisions during the campaign at the expence of the Catalonians The summer passed in a state of absolute inactivity on the side of Portugal The French though superior in numbers attempted nothing But though the generals on neither side gained any credit by their conduct in the field they deserved praise for their wisdom and humanity In imitation of the ancient Romans  they entered into a convention that the labourers on their respective frontiers should not be disturbed by either side in cultivating the soil  Hist de Portugal  or in feeding their cattle and that the war for the future should be considered as subsisting only between regular armies and not between the peasantry of the two kingdoms  Hist d'Espagne tom    Sardinia and Minorca reduced  The operations of the fleet were attended with considerable success in the present year Admiral Leake having carried to Barcelona the Princess of Wolfembuttle whom Charles the Third had espoused directed his course from thence to Cagliari the capital of Sardinia The whole island fell into his hands without drawing a sword When the English fleet appeared the monks gained by the cardinal Grimani ran in bodies to the streets and public places holding the crucifix in their hands They assured the inhabitants who flocked around them that God had made use of Heretics to give them a better master They made such an impression on the populace that the Viceroy the Marquis of Jamaica was forced to accept such terms as Leake condescended to grant The fleet commanded by the same admiral added to this important conquest the reduction of Minorca The island itself was less considerable in itself than Sardinia but more valuable to the British nation on account of the excellent harbour of PortMahon The French and Spaniards lost their courage with their good fortune The forts which defended PortMahon though provided with every necessary for sustaining a siege made scarce any shew of defence After an irregular siege of a few days some British soldiers without any orders marched into their lines The enemy struck with consternation at their sudden approach surrendered the place upon terms  Hist of Europe    Affairs of Italy  While the maritime powers were employed in the reduction of the Italian islands under the government of the house of Austria the Emperor alarmed the princes and republics of Italy by the renewal of antiquated claims on their dominions He published a manifesto wherein he declared that he was resolved to pursue the rights of the Imperial crown against such States as could not exhibit  authentic proofs that their titles to their territories were derived from the unanimous consent of the empire In consequence of his declaration he ordered the Duke of Parma to pay homage for his dominions within fifteen days under the pain of confiscation These obsolete and prescribed claims spread a general consternation The Republics of Venice and Genoa the Dukes of Modena Savoy and Tuscany were all interested in the Emperor's demands The house of Bourbon entertained hopes of forming a confederacy in Italy against a prince so unjust and unreasonable But their expectations were quashed by the reduction of the islands in the Mediterranean a circumstance that enabled the maritime powers to awe the Italian States with their fleets But the animadversion with which Joseph threatened other powers he actually put in execution against the Pope That Pontiff who had hitherto adhered to the interests of Philip the Fifth was forced to promise to acknowledge Charles the Third as lawful King of Spain to prevent Rome itself from being a second time sacked by the Imperialists  Hist of Europe Hist d'Angleterre tom ii Burnet vol iv    Death of the Prince of Denmark  During these transactions abroad the nation in their attention to the events of war seemed to lose their former animosities and fears A general tranquillity prevailed except where it was disturbed by contested elections for the new parliament But the joy which the Queen derived from the great succes of her arms was damped by the death of her husband the Prince of Denmark Having languished for some months he expired on the twentyeighth of October The very defects of his character had recommended this Prince to the affection of the people He had scarce any talent for business and he was destitute of ambition Having no passion for influence or power he never entered into the intrigues of parties The Whigs respected him as he never interfered with their own views He loved the Tories as they had been the chief instruments in procuring for him an eventual pension in case he had survived the Queen Mild and humane in his disposition he possessed the most of those virtues which are as common as they are agreeable  in private life But he was so unfit for a public station that his elevation proved to him a misfortune as it exposed his weakness to the world He was upon the whole what the husband of a Queen of England ought to have been a man of two feeble parts to be troublesome and too indolent to interfere in measures which he could not guide The Queen who had exhibited every mark of conjugal affection during his illness seemed inconsolable at his death She removed immediately from Kensington where he expired to the palace of St James's and shut herself up for several months with all the symptoms of an unfeigned grief  Hist d'Angleterre tom ii Hist of Europe Burnet vol iv    New parliament  The great success of the campaign confirmed the influence which Marlborough and Godolphin had acquired by the expulsion of Harley from the cabinet They found means at the same time to reconcile the Whigs to their measures by dividing with their leaders the power and emoluments of government The weight of the crown being thrown into the scale of that party they carried most of the contested elections against the Tories This secured a majority not to be controuled in the house of commons The new parliament having met on the sixteenth of November the session was opened by commission The superiority which the court now consisting entirely of Whigs had acquired precluded opposition as it could not be attended with any success Sir Richard Onslow recommended by the adherents of the crown was unanimously chosen speaker As the prevailing party were bent on continuing the war supplies were granted not only with liberality but even without reserve Seven millions were voted for the service of the campaign In concert with the States who had agreed to an augmentation of their own troops ten thousand men were added to the establishment of the preceding year  Journals passim  All was harmony in the house of commons if the sullen silence which frequently proceeds  om political despair can be construed into unanimity  Whigs promoted  One cause of the adherence of the Whigs to the mea  ures of government in every question became apparent  oon after the meeting of parliament The Earl of Pembroke  who had sufficiently concealed his attachment to the late King James  Stuartpapers passim  to be deemed a firm friend to the Revolution was raised to the office of lordadmiral now vacant by the Death of the Prince of Denmark Though his lordship had executed the duties of that station with considerable applause in the end of the last reign he owed his elevation at present more to the places which he had to resign than to his own merit Being at once lordpresident of the council and lordlieutenant of Ireland his resignation furnished the minister with two places of importance to secure the Whigs by gratifying their leaders The Lord Somers who had been out of employment ever since he had been deprived of the greatseal by King William was raised to the head of the council The Earl of Wharton a man of profligate abilities a Whig from faction more than from any principle was declared in council lordlieutenant of Ireland and an addition was made to the lift of privy counsellors to gratify others of the same party  Gazettes Nov  Dec    Debates on Scotish elections  These judicious promotions contributed to continue that unanimity in parliament which rendered the transactions of the session in a great measure unimportant Some debates concerning Scotish elections for both houses raised the attention of many from the stillness which prevailed in public affairs Two sons of peers the Lord Haddo and the Lord Johnston having been returned to serve for two counties in Scotland a petition against their right of being elected was presented to the house of commons Proofs were produced that the eldest sons of the nobility had been uniformly rejected by the Scotish parliament and a vote was passed for vacating the seat  of the two lords  Dec  Great debates arose in the hous  of peers upon a petition against an undue return of th  representative of the Scotish peerage in the British parliament The Duke of Queensberry who for his services in accomplishing the Union had been created  peer of Great Britain under the title of Duke of Dove  having voted in the election of Scotish peers was accuse  of having assumed the right of two votes in his own pe  +son  a circumstance inconsistent with the privilege of peers who are all deemed equals Upon a division of the house the matter was determined against the Duke of Queensberry though he was supported by the whole weight of government  Burnet vol iv    Laws of treason extended to Scotland  Another matter of importance with regard to Scotland raised the attention and employed the debates of the two houses of parliament Upon the attempt of an invasion from France in the preceding year several peers and gentlemen of rank were seized by the procurement of the Scotish lords in the ministry and were brought prisoners to London Though all were suspected of maintaining a correspondence with the invaders and many were actually guilty proof could be carried home to none They were therefore dismissed But the disgrace and expence which they incurred upon bare presumptions had induced mankind in general to conclude that they had been treated with unjust severity This circumstance together with a dispute between the court of justiciary and the Queen's advocate in Scotland concerning the trial of some Jacobites in that kingdom induced the lords to introduce a bill for extending the laws of treason already established in England to the whole kingdom of Great Britain The trials in matters of treason being less severe in Scotland than in England the whole representative of the former opposed the bill in both houses It was however passed into a law The commons to gratify the Scots in some degree made an amendment which directed that all persons indicted for high treason or misprision of treason should have not only a copy of their indictment but a list of all the witnesses to be produced and of the jurors immpanelled with their professions and places of abode delivered to them ten days before the trial and in the presence of two witnesses This salutary clause was defeated for the time by a proviso of the lords that it should not take place till the death of the Pretender  Stat Ann c    An act of grace  The debates concerning the laws of treason contributed to convince the Earl of Godolphin of the convenience of an ample act of grace He knew that he himself from his correspondence with the court of St Germains  was obnoxious upon a discovery to the law He was not ignorant that he had many enemies who suspected him of treasonable practices and some who were actually possessed of proofs sufficient to ruin his reputation if not to endanger his head The Marquis of Annandale it is said either by accident or art had possessed himself of an original letter of the lordtreasurer to the court of St Germains In the beginning of the present session the Marquis had petitioned against the undue election of one of the peers for Scotland and by insinuating that he was privy to Godolphin's secret attachment to the excluded family he obtained the weight of government and gained a seat in the house of peers The Earl of Wharton perceiving the unexpected success of Annandale treated with that nobleman for the use of his valuable manuscript He obtained the letter and was instantly declared lordlieutenant of Ireland The mischievous Wharton was at no pains to keep the secret The whole junto derived benefit from the discovery Pembroke Somers Dorset and their retainers demanded offices and were gratified But still Godolphin was in danger till the act of grace passed in the beginning of the present year The bill seemed calculated chiefly for the lordtreasurer himself Few things were pardoned except all correspondence with the court of St Germains Wharton who hoped to derive still greater advantages from the letter which he is said to have either purchased or obtained from the Marquis of Annandale was completely outwitted by the Earl of Godolphin The latter by assuring him that the material business of the session was over had induced his lordship to repair to his government of Ireland But the first intelligence he received at Dublin was that the minister had escaped from his hands under the sanction of an act of grace  Proceedings of Parliament  The Duke of Marlborough to whom the act of grace was as convenient as to the Earl of Godolphin had arrived in London in the end of February  Feb O S  That nobleman notwithstanding the addition made to his reputation by a very successful campaign had many enemies in parliament who were ready to seize any opportunity either presented by fortune or offered by his own conduct to  attack his character and to ruin his power The Tories in particular had joined a personal quarrel against Marlborough to the usual violence of men excluded from the possession of influence and office They were furnished by the Duke himself with a circumstance suitable to their desires Cardonnel Marlborough's secretary in writing to the Queen a detail of the battle of Winnendal attributed the whole honour of the affair to General Cadogan the favourite of his master who had not the least share in the action General Webb to whose activity and courage the victory was principally ascribed was not even named in the letter Cardonnel's account was made public Webb was enraged He quitted the army and returned to London His own account of the action was printed The Tories abbetted him in the house of commons and a vote of thanks was passed not without many severe and personal reflections on Marlborough who was accused of making use of unjustifiable means to depreciate the merit of a deserving officer Webb himself it must be confessed was a great enemy to his own reputation by appearing too sensible of the importance of the service  Kane's Memoirs    The two houses urge the Queen to a second marriage  Though the contest between parties ascended not to any degree of violence in the present session the flame of discord which soon after arose to an extraordinary height began already to appear in the debates of both the houses In one singular address to the throne an unusual unanimity appeared The Queen as head of the church had ordered on the thirteenth of January that the form of prayer for issue of her body to succeed her in the throne should be discontinued after the eighth of the next March the anniversary of her accession to the crown Mr Watson son to the Lord Rockingham moved in the house of commons on the twentyfifth of January that an address should be presented to her Majesty to moderate her grief and to entertain thoughts of a second marriage Though the motion seemed to convey a degree of ridicule it passed the commons without opposition and received the concurrence of the lords The Queen herself considering her constitution and even her years could scarce look upon the address in any serious  light Her answer however was full of propriety She said that the provision which she had made for the Protestant succession would always be a proof of her wishes for the happiness of the kingdom But that the subject of their address was of such a nature that she was persuaded they did not expect a particular answer  Journals    Capital of the bank doubled  The commons had with great alacrity and unanimity voted the supplies But the funds upon which they could be charged were not so easily found The ministry at length fell upon an expedient which answered their necessities They proposed to double the capital of the bank and to prolong to one and twenty years its time which was otherwise to have expired on the first of August The terms obtained by government for these advantages were four hundred thousand pounds at six per cent and the circulation of two millions four hundred thousand pounds in exchequerbills Books were accordingly opened for subscriptions So eager were the people for employing their money on such advantageous terms that in less than four hours the whole sum was subscribed Though the rapidity with which the subscription was filled was rather a proof of the necessities of government than of the wealth of the people the facility with which such a great sum was raised was calculated to give a high opinion of the flourishing state of the kingdom to foreigners They perceived with a degree of astonishment that after such great exertions in a war of many years the nation seemed to be so far from being exhausted that more than the whole annual revenue of states deemed powerful on the continent was raised in a few hours in this island  Hist of Europe Burnet vol iv  These were the most material transactions of this session of parliament which was terminated by a prorogation on the twentyfirst of April  Journals    Proposals of peace made by France  During measures calculated for the vigorous prosecution of the war serious proposals for reestablishing the public tranquillity were made by the French King The rout at Oudenard the taking of Lisle a famine in his kingdom the consequent deficiency in the revenue the general discontents of the people and the contests between  his servants forced Lewis the Fourteenth to offer terms of peace at once suitable to the melancholy situation of his own affairs and proportionable to the success of the allies The envoy of Holstein Gottorp first sounded the Statesgeneral on the subject The president Rouillé was sent in the beginning of the year to Antwerp where he had several conferences with the deputies Buys and Vander Dussen He proceeded soon after to the Hague The States cautious of making any advances in an affair of such importance without the participation of the allies sent expresses to the courts of Vienna and Great Britain The Prince of Savoy and the Duke of Marlborough who had managed with such astonishing success the war were fully empowered by their respective sovereigns to treat with the minister of France and to settle the terms of peace They arrived for that purpose at the Hague in the beginning of the month of April  M de Torcy tom i    Marlborough Heinsius and Eugene the arbiters of Europe  The Duke of Marlborough and Heinsius the pensionary of Holland in the strictest intimacy with Prince Eugene formed a kind of triumvirate on whom the grand confederacy and consequently the fate of Europe depended The two generals having gained so many battles and succeeded in all their arduous and important undertakings had acquired as much influence with the allies as they had excited of terror among their enemies Heinsius had been the depositary of the secrets of King William He had been raised by that Prince to the place of first minister and had the good fortune to preserve the authority which he had received by being the chain which united the States with the grand confederacy formed by his late patron against the house of Bourbon All the three seemed to have a personal interest in opposing the peace The Duke of Marlborough besides the thrist of glory which was probably common to him with other men had an opportunity by a continuance of the war to gratify a passion still more predominant in his mind the love of money Prince Eugene being a soldier of fortune had no business with tranquillity in which generals are commonly laid aside to rust with their swords Heinsius besides the dread of losing his importance at home  by breaking the line which connected him with foreign powers was absolutely under the dominion of Marlborough whose address in the cabinet was still more irresistible than his conduct in the field  The French form hopes on the characters of Marlborough and Heinsius  The court of France with their usual refinement hoped to derive advantage towards the necessary peace from those very passions and reasons which seemed to render Marlborough and Heinsius invariably attached to war They were no strangers to the true state of the first They built much upon the prudence of the latter and the character of patriotism which he had already acquired They knew that Marlborough while he possessed such credit and authority abroad was secretly undermined by his enemies at home They were told that a great part of the British nation were offended at seeing the power influence and emoluments of government so long divided between the Duke the Earl of Godolphin and their friends That the mind of the Queen by the secret artifices of a latent faction was greatly alienated from the interest of her general and uneasy at the uncontrouled power of her treasurer They were assured that the influence of the first was already in a tottering condition They supposed that his prudence would suggest to him to provide for the worst and therefore they derived hopes from his known love of money that he would be glad to receive a reward from France in proportion to his merit in delivering her from the calamities of a war which threatened her with apparent ruin The authority of Heinsius was by no means on the same precarious footing with that of Marlborough But the French supposed that directing chiefly his attention to the interest of his country he would seize with ardour the very advantageous conditions which were to be offered by Lewis the Fourteenth for extinguishing a war the burden of which lay so heavy on the republic  M de Torcy tom i    But they are deceived  The French however found themselves deceived in the hopes which they had formed upon the condition of Marlborough and the character of Heinsius Though neither of these two great men durst avowedly shew their want of inclination for peace they were provided with expedients by breaking off the conferences to continue the war The whole business had been hitherto transacted  between Buys and Vander Dussen the deputies of the States on the part of the allies and the president Rouillé in the name of the French King The terms offered by France were to the last degree humiliating to that monarch But in proportion as the French minister augmented his concessions these haughty republicans rose in their demands in the name of their allies While affairs were in this unpromising condition the Duke of Marlborough whose opinion of his own situation at home agreed not perhaps with the hopes the French had formed on that subject put at once a stop to the conferences He informed the States that he had orders to prevent all further advances towards a treaty should France refuse to extend her offers in favour of the Emperor and Great Britain  M de Torcy tom i  Prince Eugene insisted that the entire cession of the Spanish monarchy together with the reestablishment of the treaty of Munster should be an indispensable preliminary to the projected treaty  Ibid  Marlborough at the same time had the address to render the sincerity of France suspected by encouraging a belief that the sole business of Rouillé in Holland was to amuse and deceive the allies  Ibid    Distress of France  The state of France and the consequent behaviour of her sovereign form together irresistible proofs that the continuation of hostilities proceeded more from the views of Marlborough than from the insincerity of Lewis the Fourteenth The dominions of France were afflicted with various and dreadful calamities A desperate famine threatened to extend the waste already made among the inhabitants by the sword An excessive hard frost that had been severely felt throughout Europe was succeeded in France by a sudden thaw that destroyed all the grain The spring came on but the weather continued severe Not the least promise of maturity was made by the fruits of the earth Nothing was seen within but misery desolation and distress A powerful enemy hovered on the frontiers with victorious armies The complaints of the nation were equal to their misfortunes Intelligence of the wretched state of the French was carried to the allies and the report augmented their confidence The ways and means for raising new funds for prosecuting a disastrous  war had not only declined but were almost vanished The repeated misfortunes in preceding campaigns suggested nothing but despair concerning the future Every quarter of Europe was filled with the disgraces and misfortunes of France The confederates by making themselves masters of Lisle threatened to penetrate into the heart of the French dominions A Prince who had carried his arms a few years before to the banks of the Danube the Tagus and the Po was now forced to examine whether he could remain in safety at Versailles His people heard already in their imaginations the victors thundering at the gates of Paris The troops without pay without clothes without provisions led by generals who had lost all authority by repeated errors and consequent misfortunes and an enemy elated by conquest first prescribing terms and then rejecting them when adopted by the vanquished  Melancholy situation of the French court  Neither Lewis nor his servants were possessed of those daring abilities which supply the absence of force with an indignant pride When the relation of the last conference between Rouillé and the deputies of the States was read in council at Versailles the French ministry resigned themselves to pusillanimity and fear Instead of assuming courage from despair they yielded to all the melancholy reflections which misfortunes suggest to the timid and weak The campaign was upon the point of being opened on the side of Flanders A dispirited army scarce provided with the necessaries of war only lay between a powerful and wellconducted enemy and the capital They broke up without coming to any resolution  M de Torcy tom i  The Marquis de Torcy secretary for foreign affairs offered to the King his services as the last resort Lewis with an enthusiasm suitable to despair accepted his offer He sent him to Holland with powers to put an end upon the most humiliating terms to a war that even threatened the destruction of the French monarchy That minister arriving at the Hague on the sixth of May  N S  entered into various conferences with the pensionary and the deputies of the States  Extraordinary terms  Nothing however could be determined till the arrival of the Duke of Marlborough That general had sailed to England to frustrate some secret attacks made by his  enemies against his power  M de Torcy tom i  He returned to the Hague on the seventh of May accompanied by the Viscount Townshend as ambassador extraordinary to the States and jointplenipotentiary from Great Britain for treating concerning the terms of peace After many fruitless conferences it appeared that the allies were not sincere in their avowed declarations of wishing to put an end to the war France agreed to yield the whole Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria without any equivalent To cede her conquests on the empire upon the Upper Rhine To give Furnes Ypres Menin Tournay Lisle Condé and Mabeuge for a barrier to Holland To acknowledge the Elector of Brandenburgh as King of Prussia the Duke of Hannover as ninth elector of the empire To own the title of Queen Anne to the British throne To remove the Pretender from the dominions of France To recognise the succession of the throne of Great Britain in the Protestant line To restore every thing to the Duke of Savoy and to agree to the cessions made to the King of Portugal by his treaty with the allies  Printed preliminaries    rejected by the allies  The obstinacy of the two generals and the haughtiness of the Dutch who were elevated beyond measure at having the management of a treaty which reduced the French nation so low prevented the conclusion of a peace as honourable to the allies as it was humiliating to the house of Bourbon Though the entire cession of the Spanish monarchy or what was virtually the same the withdrawing all the aid of France from Philip the Fifth was the whole object of the war they broke off the conferences by demanding terms nugatory in themselves as they could not be executed by the French King The utmost that he could promise was to leave the King of Spain to the protection of such as should adhere to that prince of his own subjects But he was not permitted to sorm the most distant hopes of peace without surrendering the strongest towns in his dominions as pledges for the entire evacuation of the Spanish dominions by his grandson The Marquis de Torcy who knew the deplorable state of France went beyond his  powers in hopes of procuring peace  M de Torcy tom i  In proportion to his concessions the confederates rose in their demands  Preliminaries of the allies rejected by France  Conference followed conference in vain The pensionary Heinsius framed at length forty preliminary articles as the ultimatum of the allies Though every one of these articles contained the dictatorial language used by conquerors to the vanquished the plenipotentiaries of France yielded to thirtyfive The other five were referred to the decision of Lewis the Fourteenth The Marquis de Torcy repaired for that purpose to Paris But not withstanding the consternation of the French King and his council they had the spirit to reject terms of peace scarce less ruinous and disgraceful than the evils apprehended from a continuance of hostilities  Ibid  The court of France however derived some advantage from the conferences at the Hague They found means to remove the despair of the people by raising their indignation They made public the whole negociation They explained their own enormous concessions and the haughty terms prescribed rather than proposed by the allies The King himself wrote to all the governors of the provinces a moving relation of the transactions The pride of the French being roused by what they deemed an affront they prepared themselves for new efforts in the war  Hist d  France tom iii    Marlborough savours the Pretender  In the course of the negociations at the Hague the Marquis de Torcy instructed by the court of St Germains mentioned the concerns of the Pretender to the Duke of Marlborough The Duke with a want of caution inconsistent with his usual prudence expressed a strong desire of serving effectually  "the son of a King for whom"  he said  "he would have spilt the last drop of his blood"  He told M de Torcy at the same time that he believed it was the interest of the Prince of Wales for so he called the Pretender to remove entirely from France That he ought to fix his residence where he pleased enjoy perfect security and to be the master of his own motions and journies to whatever country he pleased The article of subsistence was a matter of  greater difficulty The payment of her dowry to his mother was proposed by the Marquis de Torcy as the best expedient Marlborough desired him to insist strenuously on that article to the Viscount Townshend  "That lord"  said Marlborough  "is a kind of inspector over my conduct He is an honest man but of the whigparty I must speak like an obstinate Englishman in his presence I wish however I could be of service to the Prince of Wales I hope your solicitations will furnish me with the opportunity which I so much desire  Hist de France tom iii  "  The result of the whole was that Marlborough and Townshend insinuated that if the British parliament and the nation should insist upon the removal of the Pretender from France they ought to be at the expence of supporting him with a degree of dignity and affluence  M de Torcy Stuartpapers    Secret intrigues of Marlborough and Godolphin  The intercourse between Marlborough and Godolphin and the court of St Germains continued in some degree to be carried on by the agents of the latter in England The more important part of the correspondence however lay between the Duke of Marlborough and the Duke of Berwick  M de Torcy  He made no secret to his nephew of his absolute and fixed resolution of restoring the excluded family to the British throne His own victories having rendered France incapable even had she been willing to aid the cause of the Pretender he had long signified his desire that that unfortunate Prince should remove from the French dominions The Duke himself and the Earl of Godolphin who was still more sincere in his attachment to the exiled branch of the Stuarts perceived that the greatest obstacle to the accomplishment of their views proceeded from the unsurmountable aversion the people entertained against the having a King imposed upon them by France The lordtreasurer in particular affirmed that his own inexplicable conduct in turning the Tories out of office was to facilitate the assuring the succession to the Pretender whom he dignified with the name of King He knew the Tories he said to be passionate unsteady and unfit for business He therefore resolved to bend gradually the Whigs  to his purpose men who regarded less the person of the successor than the certainty of possessing in his name the power of the crown He hoped he said by management to extricate the Pretender from the hands of France and by gradually reconciling the people to his character and person to ensure his succession to his sister's throne  Stuartpapers    Views of  The Pretender himself seemed to have been fensible that his remaining in France was by no means favourable to his expectations and designs When he returned from his expedition to the coast of Scotland he attended the Duke of Burgundy in Flanders and served under that Prince in the preceding campaign During that period he sent repeatedly to Scotland to announce his fixed resolution of passing in a hired vessel into that kingdom and to place himself in the hands of his friends If he could not establish himself in the south he intended to retire to the fastnessess and inaccessible vallies of the Highlands under the protection of the clans The nobility in Scotland who were in his interest discouraged a project which they deemed would inevitably throw himself into the hands of his enemies and totally ruin his friends Besides though France was in no condition to support his pretensions she would not probably dismiss his person Should he retire clandestinely from that kingdom Lewis the Fourteenth would most certainly stop the payment of the pittance which was the sole support of his mother and himself Though his enemies derived most advantage from the counsels of France he was impressed with a deep sense of gratitude for the protection given to his family  Pretender's original letters MS  He would not therefore enter into any project without the consent of that kingdom Those who promised to serve him in Britain could not they affirmed effectually espouse his interest while he remained in the power of a court abhorred by that nation over whom he wished to reign  Stuartpapers passim    the Pretender  Having during the winter pressed the French King to undertake a second expedition to Scotland he received in the month of March of the present year an explicit and probably a sincere answer from that Princ  Lewis told him that though he had all the inclination in the world to serve his family and ultimately himself by forming a diversion for the arms of the most powerful of his enemies the thing was absolutely impracticable in the present distressed condition of his affairs The pretended Prince laid aside for the time all hopes of transporting himself into Britain He acquainted his adherents in Scotland that they had nothing to hope from the court of Versailles His servants in the mean time endeavoured to comprehend some part of their own interest in the negociations then carried on at the Hague They proposed that the Pretender as a mark of his gratitude to the French King should retire to any country the allies might choose except the Pope's dominions or the Swiss cantons They earnestly insisted upon a general indemnity to the adherents of the excluded family They mentioned on various foundations the dowry still owing to Queen Mary d'Estè the Pretender's mother To all these demands they received favourable answers could the polite carriage and promises of Marlborough be deemed sincere But though Marlborough seems to have advised the removal of the Pretender from the dominions of France as necessary to the success of his hopes of the British throne that Prince disliked his proposal that Great Britain should in such a case charge herself with his maintainance He deemed it to use the words of his minister the Earl of Middleton a design to make the world believe that he renounced his pretensions for a pension  Stuart papers    Campaign of  The breaking up of the conferences for the reestablishment of peace was immediately followed by vigorous preparations for carrying on the war The Duke of Marlborough left the Hague on the ninth of June to place himself at the head of the consederate army in Flanders The Prince of Savoy had absolutely refused to go to Spain Nothing to be done in Italy seemed worthy of his presence The army on the Rhine had been formed with difficulty and its motions were slow He therefore resolved to remain in Flanders and to second the Duke of Marlborough in those great designs which had probably frustrated the conclusion of an honourable and highly advantageous peace The army was in  a condition suitable to the magnitude of the concerted enterprises The troops that had gained so much glory and suffered so great losses in the preceding campaign had been early recruited The fresh reinforcements consisting of some British regiments and eight thousand Saxons which the Duke of Marlborough had negociated with King Augustus had augmented the army of the allies in Flanders to one hundred and ten thousand combatants  Life of Marlborough vol ii Hist de'Angleterre tom iii  The wretched state into which a severe winter had reduced France had facilitated the recruiting of her forces Those who could procure no bread at home were forced for mere sustenance to inlist themselves as soldiers The army opposed to the allies in Flanders was commanded by the Mareschal de Villars Though inferior in number to the enemy the troops derived a kind of spirit from their very despair  Hist de France tom iii    The allies unable to force the enemy to a battle  In the end of June Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough formed their army on the plains of Lisle The number of their troops their confidence in their own conduct the consternation of the French and their promises to the allies to disperse the army of the enemy and to penetrate into the heart of France rendered those able generals extremely anxious to bring matters by a battle to a decision The Mareschal de Villars had occupied a strong post between Couriere and the town of Bethune which covered both his wings He was defended in front by the villages of la Bassée and PontAvendin He covered by this position of his army the cities of Doway and Arras the taking of which would have opened a wide passage to the allies in the heart of France The generals of the confederates having advanced within two leagues of the enemy rode out on the twentyfourth of June to view their situation Finding it too strong to venture a battle they decamped in the night and sat suddenly down before Tournay  Kane's Memoirs Life of Marlborough  Villars afraid of being attacked in his camp had injudiciously weakened the garrison of Tournay to five thousand men and it was the intelligence received by the allies concerning this  circumstance that induced their generals to form the siege of that important place  Kane's Memoirs Life of Marlborough    take the town and citadel of Tournay  Tournay was one of the strongest and most ancient cities of Flanders It had been from time immemorial subject to France till it fell into the hands of Henry the Eighth King of England in the year It was however soon after restored through the intrigues and influence of Cardinal Wolsey The Spaniards took Tournay in the year But having been retaken by Lewis the Fourteenth in the year it was rendered by new fortifications one of the strongest places in the Netherlands The situation of the town is extremely advantageous for defence No commanding heights are near and it is so well covered on every side that an enemy must be in possession of the covered way to batter in breach The Scheld which divides the town must naturally divide the enemy a circumstance often inconvenient and always dangerous The citadel fortified with all the skill of Vauban was still more strong than the town The place however was so well attacked or so ill defended that it fell into the hands of the allies after one and twenty days open trenches The governor entered the citadel with the remains of his garrison on the thirtieth of July But at the end of a month he also surrendered that place  Hist d'Angleterre tom ii    Mons besieged  The important city of Tournay being taken the allies formed the design of besiging Mons The Prince of Hesse having being ordered with a strong detachment to dislodge a party of the enemy posted in the neighbourhood of that city was soon after followed by the whole army Villars having formed the resolution of preserving or relieving the place passed the Scarpe and encamped between that river and the Scheld Finding himself disappointed in his hopes of arriving before the main army of the allies at Mons he stopt short at Malplaquet a village scarce a league distant from that city He entrenched himself in that strong situation and prepared to give all the disturbance possible to the besiegers His right extended to the village of Malplaquet which lay behind the extensive and impenetrable wood of Sart His  left was covered with another deep wood Along a very narrow plain opposed to his centre he drew trenches behind trenches and covered the whole with a row of trees with all their branches which he had cut down and carried from the neighbouring woods The generals of the confederates resolving to dislodge the French from their strong post viewed their situation on the tenth of September and fixed upon the next day for the execution of their plan  Mem de Fenquiere Kane's Memoirs    Battle of Malplaquet  Scarce had daylight appeared when the two armies having prepared themselves in the night for action were seen ranged in complete order of battle The allies had resolved to attack at once the whole line of the enemy The British troops were opposed to the left the Dutch to the right and the Germans to the center of the French The Mareschal de Villars placed himself at the head of his left wing He committed the charge of the right to the Mareschal de Boufflers who though his senior consented to act a second part After an awful suspence and silence for near two hours the battle began at eight of the clock In a moment the firing extended from wing to wing Few ages ever produced so long so obstinate so bloody a battle The allies were roused by their former victories The French were become in a manner furious through despair The Duke of Argyle with the left of the British troops passing through a morass deemed impracticable charged with fury the enemy stationed in the wood in his front and drove them into the plain behind where they instantly formed This circumstance contributed greatly to the success of the allies Villars as had been foreseen weakened his center to support his left wing against the fierce assault of the British infantry The French sustained with uncommon firmness all the efforts of their enemies in the plain They even drove them back into the wood from which they themselves had been driven The carnage was immense But neither side shewed any inclination to put an end to slaughter by flight  Hist d'Angleterre tom ii Kane's Memoirs    long obstinate and bloody  The Dutch under Count Tilly were in the mean time engaged with the right of the French Advancing  in three lines to the entrenchments they made and sustained a terrible fire for the space of an hour Some battalions giving way before them were brought back and confirmed in their station by the vigilance courage and activity of the Mareschal de Boufflers The Dutch in their turn gave ground a little way Some French battalions emboldened by their own resistance rushed from their entrenchments pushed the enemy from one of their batteries seized their colours and regaining their post sustained a second charge The unexpected obstinacy of the French in both wings induced the generals of the confederates to entertain thoughts of desisting from the attack General Cadogan in that instant perceived the void left in the centre of the enemy by the troops called by Villars to support his left Prince Eugene resolved to attack in person the intrenchments in that place He led some fresh battalions to the charge He entered the line of the enemy He flanked a regiment of French guards and forced them to fly Villars hastening to support his centre was wounded and carried from the field The Mareschal de Boufflers notwithstanding sustained the fight with obstinacy The cavalry of the allies had already entered his lines He ordered the Chevalier de St George who served in this campaign to advance at the head of twelve hundred of the horseguards In one desperate shock the German horse were broken and dissipated But the two generals of the allies who on that occasion joined the valour of soldiers to the conduct of great captains rallied their cavalry forced the enemy back on their lines and advancing slowly but firmly under the fire of thirty pieces of cannon showed by their steady motions that they were resolved to gain the field  M de Feuquiere Hist d'Angleterre tom ii    The French retreat Mons taken  Boufflers perceiving the firm countenance with which the enemy advanced resolved to prevent worse consequences by withdrawing his army from the field He carried off all his cannon except fourteen pieces dismounted in the action His retreat partook in nothing of slight It was neither confused nor precipitate The enemy were in no condition to press upon his rear They comented themselves with the field of battle now covered  with near forty thousand men comprehending the wounded and the slain This battle was one of the most bloody and perhaps the most singular that had been fought for several ages The trophies were few in number and they were reciprocal The generals and officers on both sides acted their respective parts with distinguished conduct and all their efforts were supported by the troops with consummate courage Though the field of battle remained in the possession of the allies the French obtained an honour almost equal to that of victory by a steady regular judicious and safe retreat The loss of the confederates in this bloody action amounted to twenty thousand men The French left more than eight thousand dead on the field Though the abilities of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough extricated themselves with honour from this hazardous attack men could scarce forgive their rashness in throwing away the lives of thousands without any necessity Mons might have been taken without a battle The confederates at least might have had the choice of their own ground  Kane's Memoirs M de Feuquiere  Mons was invested on the twentyfifth of September The surrender of that place on the twentieth of October put an end to the campaign on the side of Flanders  Operations on the UpperRhine  The unprovided state of the Imperialists scarce maintained the shew of war on the UpperRhine The Elector of Brunswick who commanded the army of the Empire formed some important schemes But he found the troops in no condition to second his designs He proposed to pass the Rhine and to penetrate into the Upper Alsace while the Duke of Savoy should cross the Rhone and enter Franchecomté where the two armies were to join The Elector executed his part of the plan as far as he was permitted by the wretched state of the forces under his command The Duke of Savoy displeased with the Emperor became careless concerning the fate of the war The Elector in prosecution of his part of the scheme detached Count Merci with a strong body of troops into the Upper Alsace But on the twentysixth of August that general was totally defeated by the Count de Bourg and forced with the shattered remains of his forces to repass the Rhine The defeat of Merci  ended all military operations on that side The Elector during the remaining part of the campaign kept himself within his lines while the French under the Mareschal d'Harcourt raised heavy contributions in the neighbourhood of Landau and in the Marquisate of Baden  Hist d'Angleterre tom ii Hist d'Allemagne tom vii    Campaign in Dauphine and Spain  The disputes between the Emperor and the Duke of Savoy concerning some territories in the duchy of Milan rendered the campaign inactive on the side of Dauphiné The Duke refused to take the field in person His troops remained upon the defensive and the French were too feeble to make any attack of importance In Spain the principal and first object of contest the war as usual was neglected by the confederates The French King either with a view to peace or on account of the exhausted state of his own kingdom had withdrawn his troops from Spain and devolved on his grandson the defence of his own dominions That Prince thus left to his own resources obtained considerable advantages over Charles the Third and the Portugueze The Chevalier d'Alsfeldt took the castle of Alicant on the seventeenth of April The Earl of Galway was totally defeated by the Marquis de Bay on the seventh of May in the province of Estramadura The Duke de Noailles who commanded in Catalonia obtained some advantages over the allies But the Count Staremberg who led the forces of Charles the Third in that kingdom having endeavoured in vain to force the Mareschal de Bezons to a battle took Balaguier in his presence and with that success put an end to the campaign  Publications of the Times    Naval affairs  Nothing remarkable happened at sea in the course of the present year The French scarce able to support their armies by land were utterly incapable of fitting out any fleet Britain was for some time amused with great preparations made in her ports But the armament which was destined it was said for the coast of France produced nothing but motions among the militia of that kingdom But though the ships of the French King remained useless in his harbours his subjects notwithstanding their distress at home continued with their usual activity their depredations at sea Their privateers insested  the channel and greatly interrupted the trade of the kingdom Forming themselves into small squadrons they carried their ravages and insults into America They took the island of St Thomas from the Portugueze They made themselves masters of Fort St John on the east coast of Newfoundland These disadvantages though trivial in themselves raised some murmurs among the people They complained with reason that while a numerous fleet supported at a vast expence lay useless in their ports at home or were employed with an idle parade in carrying ineffectual succours to Spain the trade of the kingdom was left to the mercy of a contemptible enemy  Naval History    The battle of Pultowa  During these transactions in the west of Europe a signal event in the east contributed to render memorable the present year The astonishing good fortune which had so long attended the King of Sweden began to desert his arms in the end of the preceding campaign But his affairs were not completely ruined till the fatal battle of Pultowa which was fought on the eleventh of July Having resolved to carry the war against the Czar into the heart of Russia and encouraged by the defection of the Cossacks he precipitately entered the Ukrain His communication with Poland being cut off he was reduced to the greatest distress for want of military stores and provisions To supply himself at the expence of his enemies he sat down before Pultowa which was full of magazines of every kind The Czar marched to relieve the place The King of Sweden abandoned at once his own fate to the decision of a battle He himself had taught the Russians to conquer His whole army was either destroyed in the action or forced soon after to surrender at discretion He crossed the Boristhenes with three hundred of his guards He gained Oczakow He retired to Bender His whole party fell with his change of fortune King Augustus reentered Poland He was followed by the Czar The Swedes retired to their own country and King Stanislaus deserting a throne which he could no longer hold joined his unfortunate patron at Bender  Hist du Nord tom ii    France makes overtures of peace  Though the King of Sweden during his prosperity shewed no inclination to interfere in the war between the house of Bourbon and the confederates the latter were relieved from a considerable degree of anxiety by the total ruin of that Prince's affairs The French though their intrigues had not hitherto prevailed upon Charles to espouse their cause derived some faint hopes from his indignation against the Emperor's open breach of the treaty of AltRanstadt which the former had in a manner extorted from the court of Vienna by the terror of his arms They found that their safety depended wholly on themselves and though the campaign had not proved so fatal to their affairs as they had reason to apprehend their wretched state could promise nothing from a continuance of the war but a series of misfortunes The court of Versailles resolved therefore to renew their applications for a negociation of peace This however could not be effected either suddenly or with ease Though the success of the allies had not answered their own expectations the same difficulties which had frustrated the design of the former conferences continued The very preliminary articles which France had rejected before the opening of the campaign had become a new bond of union between the confederates and in some measure a new law from which they could not recede When therefore Lewis the Fourteenth demanded passes for his commissioners to go to the Hague they were refused by the StatesGeneral But they permitted Pettekum the envoy of Holstein to make a journey to Paris to know what further offers the court of France were ready to make to the confederates  M de Torcy tom ii    Secret intrigues  But before any progress was made in the overtures offered by France events happened in Britain which proved ultimately favourable to the reestablishment of the public tranquillity The attempts of Harley in the cabinet against the power of Marlborough and Godolphin were rather suspended than defeated by his removal from office The violence of the Duchess of Marlborough who seemed inclined to retrieve by force the power she had lost with the Queen contributed to confirm the influence of her rival with that Princess  Harley through the means of the favourite had frequent access to the closet  Duchess of Marlborough  He owed no favour to the ministry and he is said to have embarrassed their measures But had they retained the confidence of the people they might have been in some degree independent of the changed affections of the sovereign The nation felt the grievous burden of the war and they began to wish ardently for peace The terms proposed to the French King or rather imposed upon that Prince in the conferences of the preceding May though humiliating to France contained no satisfaction no concession of territory to Britain The power that had most contributed with troops with valour and with treasure to subdue the enemy was admitted to no share in his spoils Cities provinces and monarchies were transferred to the rest of the confederates Britain was forced to rest satisfied with the glory of giving kingdoms away  Publications of  times    and open complaints  These general observations made by the people were inflamed into complaints by men who had an interest in opposing the ministry The Tories who had been long borne down by the splendid measures of Marlborough and Godolphin began again to rear their heads and to rail at their conduct Their retainers carried to the pulpit and press such accusations of their opponents as suited their own views Though many circumstances were exaggerated there was certainly much ground for complaint A want of attention to the interests of the nation in defeating its hopes of peace upon terms honourable to Britain and profitable to the rest of the allies a neglect of the war in Spain an exclusive attention to that in Flanders the inactivity of the fleet the decay of trade for want of protection from the private armed vessels of the enemy were all brought to the great account with which the ministry were charged with some colour of justice To these accusations they added others more to alarm the prejudices of the weak than convince the sensible part of the nation The cry that the church was in danger was renewed in all its force and this circumstance  was advanced with a confidence that induced many to believe the intelligence true  Publications of the times Burnet vol iv    Parliament meets Nov  But though the current began to turn its progress was hitherto slow The success of the campaign in Flanders had flattered the people into a kind of forgetfulness of their own complaints They were again reconciled to a war from which the kingdom derived so much renown On the fifteenth of November the parliament met at Westminster The Queen who on account of the death of her husband had not made her appearance in the preceding season opened the present session in person The speeches of Princes are the echoes of the voice of their principal servants The Queen expressed the usual sentiments concerning the war and demanded the usual supplies She complained that France had made use of all her artifices to amuse the allies with false appearances and deceitful insinuations of her desire of peace  Journals Nov  Though the contrary was certainly the fact the assertion was necessary to justify the continuance of the war The commons with great unanimity and zeal proceeded on the supplies More than six millions were demanded and granted The whole was placed on good and sufficient funds  Journals passim    Doctor Sacheverell  The unanimity of the commons was suddenly destroyed by an affair trivial in itself but important in its consequences A brief detail of facts will throw sufficient light on a subject rendered tedious and perplexed by the zeal of contending parties Henry Sacheverell who kindled this new flame between the Whigs and Tories was a clergyman neither eminent in his character nor obscure in his profession vehement by nature a warm zealot from principle attached to the most extravagant doctrines of the highchurch a determined enemy to dissenters to occasional conformists and their abettors the whole party of the Whigs Having distinguished himself in the country by his zeal and even by his violence he was called by a popular election to a church in Southwark Having a more extensive field for propagating his doctrines he became soon to be generally known and followed by those who favoured most the  principles of the highchurch On the fifth of November of the present year the anniversary of the gunpowderplot having obtained the pulpit at St Paul's he delivered a sermon before the lord mayor and the court of aldermen full of those expressions of complaint and jealousy which were common to him with his whole party In this discourse he inveighed with passion if not with indecency against the dissenters and the moderate part of the church of England and at the same time conveyed severe strictures upon those in power He inculcated also in strong and vehement terms the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance which in its greatest latitude was inconsistent with the late revolution  Journals Dec    his extraordinary sermon  The majority of the court of aldermen being attached to the principles of the lowchurch refused to thank Sacheverell or to desire him to print his sermon a compliment usually paid to those who preach before them on solemn days The lord mayor was of the opposite party He encouraged the Doctor not only to publish the discourse but to present it to him in a dedication conceived in the same vehement strain with the sermon The nation was composed of such combustible materials that the least spark was sufficient to kindle the whole into a flame The contests between leaders for places of trust profit and power had been improved into a settled principle among their respective adherents The two parties beyond the hope of conviction had been long persuaded that their antagonists were determined to run into the most dreadful extremities and to ruin the nation The Tories believed that the Whigs intended to establish a republican system of civil government and to destroy the church The Whigs were convinced that the Tories were resolved to persecute the dissenters and to place the Pretender on the throne The reception given to the sermon and to the opinions formed of the Doctor were suitable to the extravagant passions of the two parties The Tories extolled him as a person who stood alone unsubdued in desence of the church now on the brink of ruin The Whigs gave him the name of a popish persecutor an enemy to the revolution a devoted friend to the Pretender The vehemence of both excited to such a pitch the curiosity of the whole people that forty thou+sand  copies of the sermon were circulated in the space of a few weeks  Publications of the times    He is impeached  The ministry in an evil hour for their own power suffered their passions on this occasion to overcome their prudence The Earl of Godolphin in particular who was personally attacked in the sermon was extremely irritated against the preacher The leaders of the Whigs in general shewed great eagerness to punish severely the man who attacked with such boldness those principles which they had held forth so long to the world The crown lawyers were consulted They declared that the offence was not punishable by common law The more moderate part of the ministry proposed that the sermon should be only burned by the order of both houses and the author confined during the session The most violent declared that a more solemn punishment was necessary to stigmatise a crime of such dangerous tendency They proposed therefore an impeachment as the most dignified mode of proceeding against a man in whose person they resolved to punish his whole party Complaint of the sermon was accordingly made in the house of commons  Dec  Sacheverell was ordered to attend on the fourteenth of December He was taken into custody and instantly impeached The highchurch party flew into the most violent resentment The whole people were roused to attention Many were alarmed The emissaries of the two parties spread the flame with successful zeal They neglected their private concerns The business of the public was neglected All looked forward with eagerness to this one point as if the fate of the nation depended on the issue of Sacheverell's impeachment  Articles against him A general fermet  The year ended in the midst of the serment raised by this extraordinary affair On the ninth of January the commons exhibited the articles being four in number against Dr Sacheverell They affirmed that the Doctor suggested and maintained that the necessary means for effectuating the late Revolution were odious and unjustifiable That the toleration to dissenters was both unreasonable and unwarrantable That the church of England was in danger under the Queen's administration  That there were persons in office that endeavoured to overturn the constitution and that through the whole management of affairs there was a general maladministration and corruption Sacheverell's answer was artful and judicious He denied the charge in general but evaded the particulars The replication of the commons employed some time The whole course of the proceedings was slow and the highchurch party were thus furnished with time to gain the people to their side The clergy in general espoused the cause of Sacheverell The pulpits resounded every where with his praise He was called the champion of the established religion the only person who stood in the breach against the designs formed by the Whigs against the very being of the church The populace were inflamed into a degree of madness against the whole party and the enthusiasm which they had frequently converted to forward their own views was now turned with redoubled fury on themselves  Publications of the Times    Feb His trial  To give the more solemnity to a matter on which according to the opinions of a majority of the people the fate of religion depended the commons resolved to assist in a grand committee at the trial To accommodate this numerous body Westminsterhall was prepared at a great expence of money and time At length on the twentyseventh of February the trial began During three weeks the time it continued London was a scene of riot anarchy and confusion The populace daily attended Sacheverell from his lodgings in the Temple to Westminsterhall and rent the air with acclamations of applause They were even animated to such a pitch of fury that they pulled down several dissenting meetinghouses threatened several peers of the opposite party with violence and insulted such members of the house of commons as were most eager against their favourite  The tiral in the mean time proceeded As the Docto  had acknowledged himself the author of the sermon  witnesses were produced and the whole time was spe  in altercation and argument The managers appoint  by the commons consisted chiefly of men in office Th  distinguished themselves by desending the late revolu  +on with obvious and at any other time popular  +guments  Sacheverell was principally defended by his council by shewing that his expressions without being wrested from their true meaning could not be applied to the crimes of which he was accused When the counsel had ended the defence Sacheverell himself concluded with reading a speech in which he justified his doctrines with some energy and a great deal of heat expressing his approbation of the revolution and his respect for the reigning Queen and her government  Printed speech    Debates of the lords  When the accusation and defence were ended the lords entered into warm debates The arguments on both sides partook more of the nice distinctions of the schools than of that manly and decisive reasoning more to be wished for than expected among great bodies of men None defended absolutely the doctrine of nonresistance But several though they avowed their concern in the late Revolution affirmed that those who examined it least were its best friends A bishop said that a veil ought to be thrown over that transaction That men should rather call it a vacancy and an abdication than receive its benefits as the consequence of resistance The Duke of Leeds improved on these puerile refinements in a very long and laboured speech He owned that he had a great share in the Revolution but he never thought he said that things would have been driven so far as to settle the crown on the Prince of Orange He affirmed that the Prince had often told him that he himself had no such thoughts That a distinction ought to be made between resistance and revolution That vacancy or abdication was the subject of the debates of the convention and that resistance a word both dangerous and odious ought for ever to be forgot He observed with peculiar sagacity that had not the attempt succeeded it would have certainly been rebellion and that for his part he knew no other but hereditary right  Parl debates Publications of the Times    Sacheverell found guilty  Though the arguments on the other side were neither new nor perhaps conclusive they were more intelligible and manly The lords as the result of the debate declared that the articles exhibited by the commons were proved But they found it difficult to determine what  censure should be passed on Sacheverell Those who argued most against his doctrines seemed least inclined to be severe The populace were already inflamed to a degree of fury Many dreaded personal insults Some were afraid of commotions which the enemies of the kingdom might improve to their own advantage A few who thought they had gone too far from a prudent regard to their own interest began dexterously to fall down with the tide The sentence therefore which was passed if not unequal to the guilt of Sacheverell was certainly unsuitable to the dignity of his accusers and the solemnity of his trial He was suspended for three years from preaching and his sermon was ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman The famous decree of the university of Oxford passed upon occasion of the Ryehouse plot in the year was also burned by a vote of the lords This decree in an uncommon strain of servility recognized the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance in the most unlimited sense of the words owned the absolute and indefeasible rights of Kings and the unalterableness of the hereditary succession to the crown  Printed Decree    Preliminaries of peace offered by France  While the whole attention of the British nation was engaged by the prosecution of Dr Sacheverell the French continued to make earnest solicitations to the allies for the restoration of the public tranquillity The opening made by Pettekum the envoy of Holstein in the end of the year induced the court of Versailles to offer the sending plenipotentiaries to any part in Holland or Flanders the States General should appoint to enter into immediate negociations of peace They proposed instead of the preliminaries signed by the allies in the preceding year to reduce their own concessions into a more comprehensive but an equally ample form The French King engaged himself to acknowledge Charles the Third as King of Spain to withdraw all succours from his grandson to forbear sending him any future assistance to forbid his subjects to inlist in his service to consent that no part of the Spanish monarchy should ever be united with France To the Emperor and empire he promised to restore the city of Strasbourg the town of Brisac to content himself with Alsace in the literal sense of the  treaty of Munster to cede the town of Landau to rase all his fortifications on the Rhine from Basil to Philipsburgh to acknowledge the King of Prussia and the Elector of Hannover With regard to Great Britain he engaged himself to acknowledge Queen Anne and the protestant succession to restore Newfoundland and to demolish the fortifications and ruin the harbour of Dunkirk to consent that the Pretender should leave the dominions of France To the States he promised to yield the barrier specified in their own preliminaries to confirm his former offers with regard to their trade To the Duke of Savoy he granted all the demands of the allies But in return he expected that the Electors of Bavaria and Cologn should be restored to their territories and dignities  De Torcy tom ii    Conferences at Gertruydenberg  These proposals being rejected by the allies France made additions to her concessions Having obtained passes from the States the court of Versailles dispatched the Mareschal d'Huxelles and the Abbé de Polignac as her plenipotentiaries to conclude a peace These ministers arrived at Moerdyke on the ninth of March After various conferences with Buys and Vander Dussen the deputies of the States they opened on the twentieth of the month a serious negociation of peace at Gertruydenberg During repeated conferences with the intervention of several expresses sent by the plenipotentiaries to Versailles for further powers the French departed from almost all the reservation they had made in the preliminaries sent in the beginning of the year to Holland They agreed to relinquish every demand of an equivalent for the cession of the Spanish monarchy They offered even a subsidy of a million of livres a month to the allies till King Philip should be driven from Spain They relinquished even Alsace to the Emperor and as a security for the performance of the articles of the treaty engaged to deliver the fortified towns of French Flanders into the hands of the allies The haughtiness of the States who had the management of the negociation induced their de  ties to rise in their demands in proportion as France  creased her concessions They insisted that Lewis the Fourteenth instead of paying a subsidy towards the war  against his grandson should assist the allies with all his forces to expel him from the throne  De Torcy tom ii    are fruitless  In this untoward state of the negociation the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene at the request of the Dutch came to give their advice concerning the object of the congress Men who profited fo much by the war were not likely to facilitate the conclusion of peace Their influence with Heinsius who had established a kind of unlimited power over the councils of the States facilitated the completion of their views Safe in a person in whom they had reason to place an unbounded confidence they contrived to induce the Emperor and the Queen of Great Britain to throw the whole negociation into the hands of the republic The characters of the Dutch deputies who managed the conferences at Gertruydenberg were more calculated to embarrass any negociation than to bring it to a happy conclusion Buys was a vain confident and tedious man He mistook his own loquacity for eloquence and being passionately fond of displaying this talent involved his subject in figures and unmeaning declamation Vander Dussen was worse than a mere cypher in this conference as his silence by being taken for assent confirmed his colleague in his impertinences  Ibid tom i  In the hands of such men it was not likely that any negociation however favourable the terms might have been to the allies could be be brought to any degree of forwardness before the season proper for commencing the operations of the campaign  Campaign  Flanders  While ineffectual conferences for restoring peace continued at Gertruydenberg the allies carried on the war in Flanders with an appearance of vigour The Duke of Marlborough and the Prince of Savoy having assembled the army near Tournay in the middle of April entered the French lines without resistance and sat down before Douay in the beginning of May Arras would hav  been the shortest way to the heart of France there bein  no place of strength between that city and Amiens th  capital of Picardy But the generals of the confederat  determined on the siege of Douay as that place cover  Lisle and the rest of their conquests in Flanders T  city strong in its situation but ill fortified was garriso  +ed with eight thousand men The trenches were ope  in the first week in May and the siege was not ended till the twentyninth of June The enemy having assembled near Péronne advanced toward Cambray with a force sufficient to relieve Douay But the defeat of one army might endanger the fall of the state and therefore the Mareschal de Villars who commanded the French after having advanced within cannon shot of the allies thought proper to retire leaving Douay to its fate  Several places taken by the allies  He observed the same line of prudence throughout the whole of the present campaign The confederates took successively Bethune  August  St Venant  Sept  and Aire  Nov  The long resistance made by those towns comprehended the whole operations of the war on the side of Flanders The allies gained three places of importance and conquered twelve leagues of a fine country But they lost twentysix thousand men by the sword Half their infantry was ruined by wounds diseases and fatigue  Hist  'Angleterre  The French experienced but one instance of good fortune in the present summer The garrison of Ypres cut off a convoy with military stores carried in boats along the Lys under the command of the Earl of Athlone Having gallantly defended himself for some time his whole insantry consisting of more than one thousand men were either slain or taken The cavalry were broken and dispersed The boats and stores were taken The victors having carried away whatever was portable set fire to the magazine of powder The explosion was so violent that some neighbouring villages were overturned The earth trembled all the way to Valenciennes and even to St Quintin and the Lys was separated into two channels by the opening of the ground and its navigation interrupted  Affairs of Germany and Savoy  The same inactivity which disgraced former campaigns continued throughout the summer on the banks of the Rhine The French were weakened by detachments to their army in Flanders The army of the empire slow as usual in its motions and unprovided with the means of war were either incapable or unwilling to convert to their own advantage the opportunity offered by the feebleness of the enemy The Elector of Hannover justly judging of the unprepared state of the Imperialists  by their unpardonable negligence in former campaigns declined a command in which nothing could be expected but disgrace The war on the side of Savoy produced no action of any importance The disagreement between the Emperor and the Duke still continuing the latter refused to take the field in person Count Thaun commanded the army He was opposed on the side of France by the Duke of Berwick The vigilance activity and conduct of the Duke disappointed all the advantages which the allies might have reasonably expected from their superior force But the discontents of the Duke of Savoy seemed to have extended themselves to his army They were cold and languid in all their motions and hovered throughout the summer on the frontiers of Dauphiné without making any effort that deserved to be named  Operations in Spain battle of Almenara  The campaign in Spain was rendered memorable by the alternate defeats of the two pretenders to the throne of that kingdom Philip the Fifth with an army consisting entirely of Spaniards took the field in the beginning of May Having passed the Segra he sat down on the fifteenth of the month before Balaguer and raised batteries against the place But upon the approach of Count Staremberg he repassed the river and retired to Lerida where he waited for a reinforcement of troops from every side King Charles having in the mean time resolved to meet his rival in the field joined the army near Balaguer in the beginning of June Philip willing to bring the contest to a decision passed a second time the Segra The two armies directing their route to Almenara came to a battle in the neighbourhood of that place  July  The charge was furious on both sides but the victory was soon decided The cavalry of Philip were dispersed in the first shock His infantry were driven from the field He retired with his broken army leaving his artillery and greatest part of his baggage to the enemy His loss in men was inconsiderable and he found means to collect seventeen thousand of the fugitives under the cannon of Lerida  Hist d'Angleterre tom iii Hi  d'Espagne tom ii    Battle of Sarragossa  The rout at Almenara was but a prelude to a greater misfortune which soon after fell on the arms of Philip the fifth That Prince to cut off the communication between the enemy and Castile passed the Cinca and marched toward Sarragossa On the eighteenth of August he fixed his camp within a league of that city The count de Staremberg one of the most able generals of the age commanded the allies The Marquis de Bay being recalled by Philip from the province of Estramadura was placed at the head of the Spaniards The first sought earnestly after an opportunity of giving battle The latter avoided it in vain The Spaniards were again routed with the loss of three thousand men They however found means to save their artillery and baggage though they retired in great disorder to Tudela The British troops under general Stanhope bore the chief share in a victory which threatened to decide the fate of Spain The victors marched streight to Madrid Philip quitted a second time the capital to his rival and retired to Valladolid The religious enthusiasm of the Spaniards together with a rooted aversion to the house of Austria under whose feeble tyranny they had languished for near two centuries was of greater benefit to Philip than their arms They considered Charles the Third as a King imposed upon them by Heretics and their attachment to his rival rose in proportion to his misfortunes  Hist d'Espagne tom ii c  General Stanhope who had possessed himself of Madrid was better calculated to defeat an enemy than to gain the affections of the vanquished The army lived at large upon the people without order without moderation and without discipline They raised contributions on private persons They pillaged the churches and sold publickly the utensils of the altar The ravages of the allies combining with the obstinacy of the Spaniards created such a dearth of provisions in Castille that seventeen thousand men the number of which the victors consisted found themselves incapable of subsisting in the kingdom  Hist d'Angleterre    Gen Stanhope taken prisoner with British troops  The inconsiderate severity of the allies contributed to increase greatly the affections of the Castilians for the  house of Bourbon On the other hand the Duke de Vendome whom the caprice of the Duke of Burgundy had rendered useless to France assumed at the request of Philip the chief command in Spain The nobility crowded from every side with their followers round the standard of a general in whose conduct they could confide To these were joined thirtyfive battalions of French foot with twentyeight squadrons of horse detached from Dauphiné by the Duke of Berwick The army under Vendôme before the end of October amounted to thirty thousand men Another army of French under the Duke de Noailles assembled in Roussillon were preparing to enter Catalonia These efforts on the side of Philip were seconded by dissentions among the allies The latter retreated in a kind of confusion toward Catalonia whither Charles had already retired They divided themselves for the benefit of subsistence into two bodies Staremberg commanded the most numerous and marched in front Stanhope with five thousand British troops brought up the rear The latter stopt on the eighth of December at a small unfortified town called Briheuga He was ignorant that hope gives wings to soldiers as well as fear The Duke de Vendôme had swam across the Tagus with all his cavalry He was just at the heels of Stanhope when that general had the imprudence to shut himself up in full security in the village of Briheuga He was invested without hopes of escape before he perceived his danger He defended himself with great spirit But he was at length forced to surrender at discretion  Printed accounts    Battle of VillaViciosa  The Count de Staremberg apprised of the danger of general Stanhope returned to his relief with his whole army But this circumstance instead of serving the cause of the allies was productive of fresh misfortunes He came too late to disengage his friends He had advanced too far to retreat with safety from his enemies The Duke de Vendôme met the allies at VillaViciosa about two leagues from the place of Stanhope's misfortune He searched for an opportunity of engaging the enemy Staremberg could not avoid an action Th  battle was fierce bloody and obstinate The gener  of the confederates displayed all the courage of the so  +dier  with the talents of a consummate commander After his lest was broken and routed he maintained the fight with a single battalion in the midst of which he had placed himself Night at length more than the efforts of the enemy forced him to make his retreat The field of battle with twenty pieces of cannon two mortars and some waggons of provisions and ammunition remained to Vendôme Three thousand of the allies were slain in the action and as many were taken in and near the field But it was rather a retreat than a flight Staremberg had his trophies as well as Vendôme The honours of victory were even disputed by the former But the progress of the Spaniards after the action ascertained that their claims were better sounded The Duke de Noailles made a considerable progress in Catalonia The efforts of the Marquis de Bay were attended with some success in Estramadura He prevented the junction of the Portugueze with the Count de Staremberg and extended his ravages and contributions into the very heart of the kingdom of Portugal  Hist de Portugal d'Angleterre et d'Espagne    Naval affairs  The fleets of the maritime powers according to custom in the present war cost a great deal and did little service Their chief employment during the summer was the transporting of feeble succours to Catalonia and Portugal To weaken by making a diversion on the coast of France the reinforcements destined to march from that kingdom to Spain a descent was made upon the coast of Languedoc On the twentieth of July the confederate fleet under Sir John Norris and the Dutch admiral Somelsdyke sailed from Barcelona They arrived on the twentyfourth before the town of Cette which fell into their hands the next day The Duke de Noailles having upon the alarm of the descent marched hastily from Roussillon with two thousand dragoons having each a footsoldier behind the enemy thought proper to quit their conquests and to reimbark their troops The French court in the mean time incapable of fitting out a fleet permitted almost all their great ships to lie idle under the protection of the forts which desended their harbours The armed vessels of their subjects and a few squadrons of royal frigates interrupted  the commerce of the maritime powers in a greater degree than in the preceding year The merchants carried their complaints to the board of admiralty But they excused themselves by alleging that the whole navy was employed in carrying succours to Spain and in keeping open an uninterrupted communication with the army in Flanders  Affairs of the North  The affairs of the North which suffered so great a change by the defeat of the King of Sweden at the battle of Pultowa in the preceding year continued to wear a face of importance The Swedes deserted by their King were surrounded with foes on every side The Czar made an alarming progress in Livonia He took Webourg in Finland on the twentyfifth of June Riga surrendered on the eleventh of July the fort of Dunemonde on the twelfth of August and Revel on the first of November The King of Denmark profiting by the misfortunes of Sweden had invaded that kingdom and the calamity of a destructive pestilence was added to the ravages of war The Swedes assuming courage from despair opposed the Danes with a body of militia their regular troops being employed against the Czar The general Steenbock commanded the new levies of the Swedes on the side of Denmark He had the confidence to come to battle with the enemy  March  The Danes were totally routed They lost eight thousand men besides wounded on the field of battle Their baggage theirtents their artillery passed into the hands of the victors and thus Sweden rendered herself again formidable to her enemies after a long and unfortunate war which had deprived her of her sovereign Charles the Twelfth continued in the mean time at Bender making fruitless

MarlboroughCause of that measureObservations on his character and conductReflections  State of domestic affairs  DURING the undecisive operations of the campaign abroad the state of affairs at home suffered a very important change The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Godolphin having defeated some years before the intrigues of Harley in the cabinet had resolved to hold by the means of party the power which they despaired to possess by the inclination of the sovereign As long as they retained the affections of the Queen the confidence which their splendid measures had acquired from the people were sufficient to support them against the irregular attacks of the two irreconcileable parties that had harrassed the nation for such a number of years with their contests and their noise But when the violence of the Dutchess of Marlborough had destroyed that influence which she had extended into a kind of tyranny over the timid mind of her mistress they found it necessary to strengthen themselves by forming a connexion with the Whigs They gained therefore the leaders of that party by admitting them into places of trust and profit and fortified by this political alliance they held their sovereign in chains The Queen unable to extricate herself from this species of captivity affected to adopt measures which she was not permitted to guide  Steps toward a change in the ministry  Though Harley and the followers of his fortune were no strangers to the state of the Queen's mind they could form no reasonable expectations on any exertion of that Princess for the recovery of her authority They perceived that a change in the sentiments of the people was necessary to render effectual the efforts of the sovereign The populace for many years had been uniformly gained to the views of party by the constant alarms given from time to time to their zeal for the protestant religion The Whigs by harping judiciously on this string had frequently taken the cabinet by storm They had often triumphed over their political opponents by the means of popular clamour even when that party had formed a great majority in the houses of parliament  The Tories made repeated efforts to take possession of a  engine that had so much annoyed themselves Th  opinion that the church of England was in danger fro  the Dissenters and men of levelling principles had bee  propagated with great zeal ever since the beginning of the present reign The eloquence of the pulpit had been joined to the polemical arguments issued from the press The established clergy themselves began through use to believe the doctrine which had been first propagated for the purposes of party The vulgar gradually gave credit to what they heard so often and so vehemently urged The Queen herself with a credulity not unsuitable to her sex was alarmed at a tale which she thought was too often repeated not to have some foundation in fact  The imprudence of Godolphin  The imprudence of the Earl of Godolphin was the means of setting fire to a train that had been laid for several years Persecution is always more successful than persuasion in confirming speculative tenets in weak minds The attack upon Dr Sacheverell the solemnity and length of his trial the vast inequality between the accusers and the accused the vehemence of the Whigs in throwing the whole weight of government in the scale against a private person raised the pity of the people and that passion was improved into acts of violence by the art perseverance and clamours of zealots of the highchurch party The current which had been long changing ran down with a force that levelled every thing in its course Harley and his followers added their own weight to its violence The Queen herself encouraged by the noise of the populace fell gradually down with the stream She had been long disgusted with the behaviour of Marlborough She hated the tyranny and feared the violence of his wife She considered herself  s a kind of prisoner in the hands of a family who had  n a manner cloathed themselves with the whole authority  f the crown and struck the sceptre from her hands With a passion natural to all princes she was averse  o the levelling principles held forth by the Whigs  nd for the same reason she abetted those of the Tories  and obstinacy of Marlborough  Though the nation was not inflamed against the Whigs  a degree sufficient to deprive them of power till the  lemn trial of Sacheverell the Queen assumed some  urage from the colour of the times in the begin  ng of the present year Mrs Masham the new savou  te hid a brother Colonel Hill who had distinguished  himself in the battle of Almanza The influence of his sister more perhaps than his merit had recommended Hill to the attention of the Queen and she shewed an inclination to raise him to the command of a regiment of dragoons vacant by the death of the Earl of Essex The Duke of Marlborough who had uninterruptedly possessed the disposal of all military promotions opposed with obstinacy the advancement of Hill as the brother of a woman who had rendered herself odious to himself and his family He retired to the country He threatened to resign the command of the army He employed his friends to terrify the Queen and her favourite with addresses from the parliament The Earl of Sunderland the Duke's soninlaw then secretary of state had formed a design to procure a vote of the commons to remove Mrs Masham from the Queen's presence and service  Jan  Apprized of this intended violence Hill entreated the Queen to desist from her purpose in his favour She complied with his request for the time But it became evident that she was resolved to seize the first favourable opportunity of ridding herself of servants whom she now considered as tyrants  Hist d'Angleterre MS    hasten the fall of the party  The flame which had seized the nation upon the trail of Sacheverell soon furnished the enemies of the family of Marlborough with the means of divesting them of their power Harley and his associates having free access to the Queen through her favourite turned events as they gradually rose to their own advantage The changes  which soon after became general were begun in the middle of April The Duke of Shrewsbury who had distinguished himself in the debates concerning Sacheverell  against the ministry was made chamberlain  April  in th  room of the Earl of Kent who had resigned that offic  upon his being raised to the dignity of a Duke The pro+motion of Shrewsbury was considered as a prelude to th  fall of the ministry The people were industriously pr  +pared for an important change The principles of th  Whigs were every where represented as dangerous  monarchy and destructive to the Church The Tori  by possessing by far the greatest portion of the lands of t  kingdom were said to possess the best title to power Those who formed the monied interest were called new men that owed their very existence to the misfortunes of the state They descended from general observations on parties to accusations of particular persons They affirmed that the ministry consisting chiefly of one family had excluded all others from every influence and power in the state while they held the Sovereign herself in the most abject slavery They shewed that naval affairs were absolutely neglected That the war in Spain was sacrificed to the glory of the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders That the conquests of that general produced no advantage to the nation That his power was formidable his wealth immense his connexions extensive and that his excessive attachment to the interests of the States of the United Provinces founded perhaps on those selfish passions to which he was subject was sufficient to render him suspected of being capable of the worst designs  Publications of the Times    Sunderland dismissed  Though neither the Duke of Marlborough nor the  arl of Godolphin were any longer strangers to the bad  ms on which they stood with the Queen they derived  me hopes of the continuance of their power from her  rs But when on the fourteenth of June the seals  re taken from the Earl of Sunderland neither they nor  nation could entertain any doubt that a total change  s near The removal of the Earl from his office ele  ed his enemies as much as it depressed his friends  he Tories crowded the presence of the Queen with ad  sses and congratulations on her conduct They extoll  her Majesty for asserting her just prerogative They  iced they said at her having emancipated herself  m the caprice and tyranny of an insolent junto who  d kept her in dependence and chains The Whigs  the other side though at first they yielded to their  air endeavoured to support themselves with the peo  in opposition to the Queen They suggested and  pagated a notion that the credit of the nation wholly  ended on the lordtreasurer They affirmed that  success of the war had proceeded from the abilities  the astonishing good fortune of the Duke of Marlbo  gh To support the first of those maxims they con  ed to sink the price of the national stocks by withdrawing  their own money from the funds with every symptom of consternation and panic The directors of the bank of England were at the same time induced by the party to represent to the Queen the danger likely to attend the changing of her principal servants  Foreign powers interpose for the ministry  While the Whigs involved the monied interest at home in their own cause the Duke of Marlborough endeavoured to support the tottering authority of the party by the interposition of foreign powers The Emperor and the States attentive of themselves to the domestic affairs  Great Britain listened readily to the suggestions of the Duke and employed their good offices with the Queen  The Count de Gallas the Imperial minister and V  +bergen the Dutch envoy represented to her Majesty th  bad consequences which might result to the affairs of th  grand alliance from a change in her servants They af+firmed that even rumours spread of her intentions  placing the management of her affairs in other hands  already filled the confederates with jealousies and suspici+ons and raised the confidence and expectations of th  enemies Though the Queen ascribed these unusual in+terpositions of other States more to the arts of the D  of Marlborough than to their zeal for the common cau  she dissembled her resentment She made answer to t  Count de Gallas that whatevever change she might m  at home the Duke of Marlborough should

success by their political e  +mies Severe reslections were made upon the Empe  and the Dutch for presuming to interfere in the in  +nal affairs of a great and independent kingdom The T  +ries inveighed with vehemence against Marlboroug  as the source from whom this fresh affront to the Que  had sprung The Duke on his part was equally e  +ed His passion overcame that coolness of behaviour a  deliberate address which supplied in his character  absence of great parts He seemed resolved by a sud  and great effort to triumph over his enemies and to  +venge himself upon the Queen When he received  +lligence of the intended disgrace of Sunderland  wrote instantly to the Duke of Berwick  June  and offered his services to the court of St Germains Though he had often disappointed before the hopes of the excluded family they resolved to treat him with attention and an appearance of confidence They thought they could trust his present professions as he was obliged to form new engagements for his own safety Besides they were afraid that should they slight his advances he would attach himself to the house of Hannover The Pretender himself was at the time serving the campaign in Flanders under the Mareschal de Villars The exiled Queen wrote therefore an answer to Marlborough and Villars transmitted it to his adversary by a trumpet  Stuartpapers    Letter to him from the exiled Queen  In this letter which was written with a degree of judgment and spirit she expressed her joy that Marlborough continued firm to the promises which he had so often made to her husband and her son She was however surprised to find that he entertained thoughts of quitting his high command  "Your retreat"  she said  "will render you useless to your friends and an easy prey to your enemies You are to large a mark to be missed by the shafts of malice The safety of your opponents consists in your ruin They will reduce the arny where you have such great influence They will fill all the branches of the revenue with their creatures The credit of the new officers the influence of their preachers the weight of the treasury will not fail to return a new parliament very different from the

decisive effect on Marlborough he continued to hold a friendly communication with the Pretender He wrote repeatedly concerning him to Villars  Ibid  He expressed on many occasions an anxious concern for his health and the prosperity of his affairs His own situation became every day more critical and perplexed Anne supported by the vehemence of the Tories and the counsels of Harley no longer disguised her design of ridding herself of the Whigs On the eighth of August the Earl of Godolphin received a message from the Queen to break his staff as lordtreasurer of Great Britain The treasury was immediately put in commission The Earl Powlet was constituted the chief at the board but the secret of affairs was known to lie in the hands of Robert Harley made chancellor of the Exchequer This change in the treasury was the forerunner of alterations in the other departments of the state The Lord Somers the president of the council being dismissed was succeeded on the twentyfirst o

Europe    Character of the Earl of Wharton  The removal of the Earl of Wharton from the g  +vernment of Ireland was a salutary piece of justice  that kingdom This nobleman though possessing disti  +guished talents had been uniformly obnoxious to t  virtuous of both parties on account of an abandoned pr  +fligacy of principle which he was at no pains to conce  from the world In a contempt of all religion he ma  an idle parade of infidelity Impatient of restralnts of any kind he avowed himself the enemy of all government To be connected with a party was necessary in a country where preferment was gained like victories by the force of numbers He adhered therefore to the Whigs as a line more suitable for the exertion of his talents In the management of mobs in the tumults of elections in reconciling the inconsiderate and sanguine to his views by baits of profligate pleasures the Earl of Wharton had no equal In his exhibitions in the house of lords he possessed a ready rather than solid eloquence His imagination was quick his satire poignant his wit fertile but coarse He often spoke what are familiarly called GOOD THINGS as he was afraid of saying nothing that was bad Having acquired the reputation of  Wit he endeavoured to support it on every occasion and with an incontinence suitable to those who grasp at fame in that way frequently sacrificed his best friends to a joke He was however so useful to his party that he was encouraged even by the graver heads of the Whigs and thus with talents which could scarce gain  im bread in any other line he became considerable in  olitics To repair his fortune which he had squandered he alleged in the service of the party he was sent  Ireland and if his purpose was not answered it was  ther for want of time than assiduity  Marlborough accuses Harley of Jacobitism  The Duke of Marlborough of his whole party re  ained alone in office But notwithstanding this com  aisance toward the person of Marlborough he was not  pable of suppressing his resentment against Harley his  ortal enemy Though he himself was in the most in  ate correspondence with the court of St Germains  accused the new ministry to the Elector of Hannover  fully determined to restore the Pretender In a letter  his Electoral Highness on the thirteenth of August  professes his attachment to his family "with which"  said  "I consider those of my country and of all  rope inseparably connected I hope the English nati  will not permit themselves to be imposed upon by the  ifices of Harley and his associates Their conduct  ves no room to doubt of their design of placing the  tended Prince of Wales on the throne We feel too  ch already their bad intentions and pernicious designs  But I hope to be able to employ all my attention all my credit and all my friends to advance the interest of the Electoral family to prevent the destructive councils of a race of men who establish principles and form cabals which will infallibly overturn the Protestant succession and with it the liberty of their country and the safety of Europe  Original letter Hannoverpapers  "  These assurances derive their importance from the present circumstances of the person by whom they were made When Marlborough accused Harley of Jacobitism to the Elector he himself was busy in making professions of attachment through the Mareschal de Villars to that very pretended Prince whose succession to the throne was to have enslaved Britain and ruined Europe  S  +artpapers    Uneasiness of the allies and hopes of the French  The total change of the British ministry alarmed the allies and encouraged the house of Bourbon The States in particular entertained no doubt but that the Queen in changing her councils would change also her measures Her ambassador the Viscount Townshend assured them in vain that his mistress reposed the same confidence in the Duke of Marlborough and continued the same firmness with regard to the common cause The jealousy and apprehensions of the confederates were too strong to be removed by assurances The Dutch regretted sincerely the opportunities they had lost by which they might have obtained great advantages to themselves and have the honour of restoring peace to Europe Th  French were as little able to conceal their gladness  the allies were to disguise their uneasiness They flat+tered themselves with the prospect of an immediat  peace as the Tories who now ruled every thing ha  long declared themselves averse from an unprofitable wa  The court of St Germains and particularly the Earl o  Middleton represented to Lewis the Fourteenth that h  was mistaken in his expectations from the Tories H  told him that it was a matter of indifference to Lewi  whether highchurch or lowchurch prevailed Bo  he said were equally the enemies of France and  even affirmed that the Jacobites themselves were high  averse from the interests of a court who made no effe  in favour of the person whom they deemed their lawful sovereign  Stuartpapers    Views and secret proposals  These discouraging insinuations of the court of St Germains though just proceeded from the sanguine hopes which they themselves had formed on the state of opinions in Great Britain They affirmed in their memorials that the two parties concurred in principles suitable to the restoration of the excluded family The church held forth avowedly that the crown was unalienable and hereditary The Presbyterians followed they said the arguments of their opponents with a plain inference that the Revolution itself was a rebellion The two parties they affirmed seemed to agree that the Princess Anne for so they called the Queen of Great Britain had no title to the throne They urged therefore that this was the proper time for the King for such was the high title they bestowed on the Chevalier de St George to make his appearance in Britain  Stuartpapers Aug    The Duke of Marlborough advised them in vain against any hostile attempt on Great Britain a measure he affirmed which could not fail to unite the parties  Ibid  He averred that the inveteracy exhibited by every parliament and the union which appeared among the people upon the intelligence of any invasion proceeded from a  oted aversion to France more than from want of affection to the excluded family He considered the removal of the Chevalier de St George from France as  great step toward his restoration and that circumstance  said was one of the advantages which the pretended  ince would derive from a peace  Stuartpapers De Torcy    of the court of St Germains  The Chevalier himself coincided in opinion with Marl  orough He perceived that France had scarce ever  y serious intention to restore his family He knew  at at present she was incapable of serving him to ef  ct had she even been willing He therefore ear  stly wished for peace and no article he said could  ease him more than the requisition of Great Britain  remove him from the dominions of France  Chev de St George to Middleton July  His  minister the Earl of Middleton was of a different opinion He endeavoured to argue the court of Versailles to undertake another attempt upon Scotland  "The Scots"  he said  "in general favoured the hereditary line None had deserted the party after the bad success of the last enterprize No secret had been ever better kept No accusers appeared no witnesses could be found to condemn"  He observed  "that in England two parties were animated to an extreme against each other That the highchurch maintained nonresistance as a tenet of religion and that the hereditary descent of the crown is a law so fundamental that it cannot be changed by act of parliament That the lowchurch instead of arguing against these principles affirmed that the consequence of the first is that the government ever since the Revolution was an usurpation and that the Pretender must be acknowledged lawful King is the inference to be drawn from the second The people"  he continues  "are mere spectators of this polemical contest They conclude that both are in the right and that the Queen herself by favouring the highchurch party is manifestly in the interest of her brother"  Project of an invasion  All the friends of the excluded family as well as the Duke of Marlborough assured the court of St Germains that patience only was necessary to reestablish them on the British throne They wished them to detach themselves from France as the only means to reconcile thoroughly the nation to their claims Middleton notwithstanding solicited a second invasion of Scotland He demanded only three thousand men from the court of Versailles and that consisting entirely of the Irish in the French service They were the best calculated for the enterprise he said as they spoke the language of the Highlanders and were accustomed to the hardy manne  of living peculiar to the inhabitants of mountainou  countries The number of troops demanded could h  continued create no jealousy They were only suffic  +ent to protect the person of the Pretender till a trea  for his eventual succession to the throne after the dea  of s his sister should be established with the British cou  The court of France either incapable of sparing a  force or unwilling to risk their troops and their ships  an enterprise which appeared uncertain in its consequenc  paid little attention to these suggestions Middleton was suffered to amuse himself in secret with the visions of future advantage to his master which he formed on the speculative arguments of the contending parties in Britain  Stuartpapers Aug    Attachment of Godolphin to the Stuarts  Though the court of St Germains placed little faith in the professions of the Earl of Godolphin they lost the chief support of their cause when that minister was forced to retire His attachment to the family of Stuart though cautiously and successfully concealed from the world was certainly next to his inherent timidity the ruling passion of his mind He is said to have only regretted his disgrace as it deprived him of the power of serving effectually the excluded line He declared to his intimate friends that he had been always in unhappy circumstances That being first distressed by the Tories he was forced to throw himself into the hands of the Whigs That his whole ministry had been spent in a struggle with the latter party and when he saw himself entirely master of his measures he was turned out of his office by an event as trivial as it was unexpected He hoped however he said that Harley would restore the King for so he called the Pretender  "But HE will make France necessary to that measure I designed to have done the business alone and to shew the French how poorly they had treated that unfortunate Prince and how little they deserved at his hands  Ibid  "  His supposed project in favour of the Pretender  Concerning Godolphin's project for the restoration of  he Stuarts some judgment may be formed from the  apers and proposals of that family The Duke of Marl  orough had signified to the Marquis de Torcy in the  egociations for peace in the year that it was for  he interest of the Pretender to remove from France  e proposed at the same time to procure for him from  he British nation a sum equal to that which he received  or his support from the court of Versailles and to  ake stipulation with the allies for his secure retreat  ther in Holland or Flanders Provided with a kind of  venue separated from the influence of a nation whom  e subjects of his ancestors abhorred and divided on  by a narrow channel from Britain the Pretender  would have found little difficulty in transporting himself into Scotland and in appearing in that country at the head of a numerous body of his adherents The reduction of the army to a small number upon the restablishment of peace would have left the kingdom in a state sufficiently defenceless to justify the minister in entering into a treaty with a person whose claims were favoured by a very great party in the nation The natural moderation of his own character his want of ambition his prior engagements with Marlborough and Godolphin  Stuartpapers  and even the improbability of his prevailing by force alone would have induced the pretended Prince to accept such terms as the Queen and the nation might choose to impose He was by no means so jealous as his father with regard to the hereditary descent and indefeasible rights of the crown He would have been well pleased to have received it as the gift of the people He would have been contented to accept of the throne of Scotland or to have his name joined with that of Anne in the royal title of Great Britain  Ibid  while the whose authority should remain during life in her hands He would perhaps have rested satisfied with an acknowledgment of his title as Prince of Wales and the eventual succession of the crown upon his sister's death  MSS    His character  Had his secret designs and intrigues remained unknown to the world the Earl of Godolphin might have been transmitted to posterity with an unblemished character He was born with extensive talents A long experience had in a particular manner qualified him for the great line of business He understood the interests of the kingdom the genius of the people the secret views of particular men as well as the disposition of parties In his public capacity he was stugal of the money of the nation without cramping its exertions with penury An oeconomist of his private sortune without the least tineture of avarice Though forbidding in his address through the stern gravity of an habitual silence and an ungraceful manner he gained mankind by the apparent sincerity of his character He never kept suitors in an unprofitable suspence He promised nothing that he was not resolved to perform He considered dissimulation as an unmanly  breach on veracity He refused with frankness where he could not serve with generosity In the common line of business he shewed such an undeviating attention to justice that those who were disappointed by his decisions could not withhold their esteem from his impartial conduct Though he found it necessary to disguise his own principles he never affected to possess those of others to gain either their support or their favour Political timidity was the greatest defect of his mind That passion overcame frequently in his public transactions that sincerity which he uniformly observed in his private conduct The weakness which induced him to adhere in his opinions to the excluded branch of the house of Stuart was a kind of virtue He was first placed in the line of fortune and ambition by that family and their confidence in his fidelity and attachment contributed to continue that gratitude which he owed for their many and great favours  Observations  Though the timidity of Godolphin was highly unfavourable to the family of Stuart it was also productive of bad consequences to his country That weakness being generally known to the leaders of the two parties their clamour and presumption rose in proportion to their hopes from the minister's fears The views of the Whigs and Tories being the same though their professions to the world were different they had both recourse to the same  s to possess themselves of emolument and power The  rejudices of the vulgar that ready and obvious engine  r the hands of designing men were turned with pecu  ar success against a minister destitute of courage Though  vernment had acquired from the very misfortunes of  e people the means of quieting their turbulence with  e few men in office knew their own strength in a de  ee sufficient to remain steady and unmoved amidst the  se of an offended populace Godolphin yielding to  fears neglected to procure an honourable and advan  eous peace for his country already staggering under  very weight of her victories He knew that a  asure so important would furnish the discontented with  means of inflaming the nation and this together  th his subserviency to the views of the Duke of Marl  rough induced him to neglect an opportunity of closing  th splendor a successful war  A total change  The disgrace of the Earl of Godolphin was considered by his party as the certain prelude of their own total fall Their spirit seemed to have vanished with their good fortune Few had the courage to continue in office Fewer still had the boldness to retire with dignity They quitted one by one their places without any concert of opposition or even design of revenge They carried their resignations further than their enemies either expected or wished The Queen signified her inclination that the Lord Cowper should continue chancellor He derived perhaps this favour from his insignificance But he also retired  Sept  The Tories pursued their victory through every branch and department of government All the relations creatures and dependents of the former ministry were dismissed every where The Revolution itself it was with justice observed had no  made such a total change among the servants of th  crown The Duke of Marlborough remained alone o  his whole party But he owed this mark of distinctio  to his own high reputation more than to any forbearanc  of his enemies They had already determined on h  fall Time was only wanting to reconcile the people  the dismission of so great a commander  Publications of the Times    Intrigues of St John and Harcourt  The total change in the servants of the crown oug  not however to be altogether ascribed to Harley  maxim of government was evidently to trim between t  parties to gain the Tories but not to lose entirely t  Whigs But such was the inveteracy which a long series  animosities had created on both sides that neither wo  be content with any thing less than the whole power  influence of the state His own friends were upon  present occasion likely to become Harley's greatest e  +mies He had resolved to place St John and Harco  in the offices they had formerly lost to make the  secretary at war and the last attorneygeneral But  John insisted upon being made secretary of state  Harcourt would be content with nothing less than  great seal Harley willing to retain the Whigs in t  offices refused to comply They threatened to reti  the country and to leave him to the mercy of his ene  Some leaders of the Tories interfered They represented to him that his trimming conduct would deprive him of his best friends He yielded at length to their desire But he was so much offended especially with Harcourt that though he raised him to the place of chancellor he never admitted him into the secret of affairs  Stuartpapers  He would probably have done the same by St John But the latter understood the French language and was necessary in the expected negociations of peace  A general ferment  But the people now were entirely on the other side The flame which Sacheverell's trial had raised was kept up with great address The clergy considering his cause their own made the pulpits resound with his praise while they thundered vengeance against his enemies In a progress which he made to Wales perhaps with a design of continuing the ferment against the Whigs he was followed every where by the whole country on horseback Mayors magistrates whole corporations attended him in their robes and formalities in the towns through which he passed The populace met him on every road with white knots in their hats with sprigs of laurel gilt with gold while the hedges on either side were dressed with flowers Though no design of calling a new parliament was as yet made public the reception given to Sacheverell was considered as a kind of preparation for that event The people being at length prepared for the measure the parliament was dissolved on the twentyfirst of September The elections were car  ied on every where with unusual violence and noise The mob encouraged by the new ministry and the To  ies became outrageous in the cities and boroughs The  eneral cry was raised so effectually against the Whigs that  hey were excluded wherever the votes depended either  the inclinations or caprice of the populace  Assurances of the new ministry  Though the new ministry derived their success in a great  easure from the principles of the highchurch party in fa  our of the hereditary descent of the crown they resolved  o reconcile the house of Hannover to their own elevation The letters of their leaders to the electoral family form  curious instance of the insincerity of the professions of  partymen The Earl of Rochester whose principles in favour of the Stuarts were known avowed with vehemence an inviolable attachment to the parliamentary settlement of the crown The Duke of Buckingham who held an uninterrupted communication and correspondence with the court of St Germains and their agents affirmed with peculiar modesty to the Elector that he had been persecuted by the Whigs for his attachment to the protestant succession  Buckingham to the Elector Sept Hannoverpapers  The Duke of Leeds who in the debates concerning Sacheverell had almost in express terms called the Revolution a rebellion and declared that he knew no right but an hereditary right made the warmest professions of regard to the interests of the family of Brunswick  Leeds to the Elector Nov  Harley himself considered as the head of the new ministry in adhering to the principles of presbytery in which he was bred was perhaps more sincere though not less servile in the advances which he made to the presumptive heir of the crown St John in a convenient absence of attachment to both sides followed to avoid singularity the example of his associates in office  to the house of Hannover  The Duke of Shrewsberry naturally timid and provident of the future wrote  Hannoverpapers  to the Elector with warm professions of zeal and attachment He was at the time through the means of his wife in actual correspondence with the court of St Germains and from principle a friend to the family of Stuart  Stuartpapers passim  All assured his Electoral Highness that the new ministry were zealous for supporting the grand alliance to its utmost extent to prosecute the war to obtain an honourable peace and to secure effectually the succession in the house of Hannover  Hannoverpapers  They employed their creatures to confirm to the Princess Sophia the assurances which they made to her son A Doctor Hutton contained their arguments in a series of tedious letters of his own  Ibid  The Queen herself though her attachment to her brother was then suspected and now is known joined her servants in as+surances of zeal for the protestant succession To pre+vent  every inquietude in the electoral family she appointed the Earl of Rivers her ambassador to the court of Hannover to assure them that the changes which she had made would prejudice in nothing the acts passed for securing the succession in the protestant line  Hannoverpapers    The Whigs apply to that family  The agents of the new ministry had the address to render their predecessors suspected by the electoral family The free principles of government which they had advanced in the debates concerning Sacheverell had been industriously represented to the court of Hannover as irrefragible proofs of their aversion to monarchy The Whigs were alarmed at the credit given to their adversaries in a matter which must hurt their own influence with a family that was one day destined to wear the crown The Earl of Sunderland and the Lord Halifax were employed by the party to undeceive the Elector of Hannover The avenues to the court of that Prince were so beset with the emissaries of the Tories that the two lords were obliged to write their thoughts in cypher They endeavoured to explain that they had been always for a parliamentary right to the crown They disclaimed with a degree of scorn all republican or antimonarchical principles They affirmed that the high maxims of the Tories prepared the way for the Prince of Wales to mount the throne That the Whigs opposed these maxims with arguments suitable to republicanism merely to serve the family of Hannover whose rights could not be so well maintained on any other ground  Ibid Nov    Nov New parliament  During these secret intrigues of the two parties the new parliament assembled at Westminster The Queen coming to the house of peers on the twentyfifth of November Sir Simon Harcourt now lordkeeper of the great seal signified to the commons her Majesty's pleasure that they should choose a speaker Their choice is was expected from their principles fell on William Bromley a person remarkably attached to the highchurch party The Queen having signified in her speech the resolution she had taken of prosecuting the war with the utmost vigour especially in Spain demanded suitable supplies To remove every jealousy that might arise in the nation she resolved she said to set  forth plainly her intentions She was determined she assured her parliament to support and encourage the church of England to preserve the constitution according to the Union to maintain the indulgence allowed by law to scrupulous consciences and that to transmit effectually these benefits to posterity she was resolved to employ none but such as were heartily for the protestant succession in the house of Hannover  Journals Nov  This popular speech was echoed back as usual in the addresses of the two houses of parliament Men who formed their opinions upon such fallacious grounds thought they perceived a degree of coldness in the address of the lords But that of the commons was warm vehement and suitable to their principles in favour of monarchy  Proceedings Great supplies  Not withstanding the species of madness that had seized the nation and the utmost efforts made by the new ministry in favour of the Tories more than one hundred reputed Whigs were returned to the house of commons Few of these were permitted to take their seats in tranquillity Petitions were offered against the most of those who were supposed to favour the old ministry and they complained that their principles were more an object of examination than the justice of their cause In such a state of parties in the house the deliberations of that assembly must have assumed the appearance of great unanimity The Tories had so effectually taken the ground of the Whigs in their public professions that the latter had they even been more numerous could not with any decent consistency oppose the measures of the ministry Though the Queen in her speech had insinuated that she was desirous of peace her servants shewed every attention to the vigorous prosecution of the war  The commons voted without hesitation the supplies  The debts provided for and the sums raised in the cours  of this session amounted to more than fourteen million  l    d  But the navy and other offices had been left b  the former ministry under a burden of debts whic  greatly obstructed the service  Inquiry into the management of the war in Spain  The new ministry shewed an inclination to censu  their predecessors in office They were soon furnish  with an opportunity of pursuing their design by receiving intelligence of the disasters with which the campaign closed in Spain The war on the side of that kingdom though the first object of contest had been strangely neglected The conduct of the allies when most successful contributed to ruin the cause which they endeavoured to support with their arms Licentiousness and a want of regular discipline never perhaps properly observed in the hurry of hostilities had been carried by the confederates to a degree calculated to ruin the interest of the house of Austria in the hearts of those whom they wished to reconcile to their government The Earl of Galway habituated to rapine in the Irish war was at no pains to check the natural inclination of all soldiers for plunder General Stanhope himself mixing a commendable aversion to popery with a decent affection for bullion had permitted his troops to pillage the altars of their sacred utensils in the city of Madrid and its neighbourhood The part of the army which was in the pay of the Dutch republic shewed in the same manner their zeal for protestantism  Hist d'Anglettere    Peterborough applauded and Galway censurred  The Spaniards bigotted to enthusiasm in their own system of faith had some reason to abhor such ravenous heretics The unfortunate Charles the Third was loaded with all the sins of his army The whole affection of the people was thrown into the scale of his rival and that Prince found himself after a war of nine years capable to defend his crown against the united efforts of the allies The victory at Sarragossa being illpursued opened a way for the defeat and great loss at Briheuga The Queen laid the disasterous intelligence which she had received before the two houses who promised to support her with all their power to retrieve the fortune of the Spanish war They at the same time entered upon an inquiry into the conduct of the late ministry and those employed by them in Spain in the command of the troops in that kingdom In their approbation as well as in their censures on the subject the parliament appear to have yielded in some degree to the spirit of party They applauded in a high strain the Earl of Peterborough But on the faults and errors of the Earl of Galway they were perhaps too severe The lords carried their animadversions  from the general to the conduct of those by whom he was employed They addressed the Queen to free the cabinetcouncil from their oath of secrecy that a full account of their consultations might be laid before the house The result of the whole might have been easily foreseen A vote passed that the former ministry were highly to be blamed in their neglecting the Spanish war That by their advising an offensive war in the year they had been the cause of the loss of the battle of Almanza and in consequence of the miscarriage before Toulon  Journals of the lord vol ii    Coldness toward the Duke of Marlborough  During the course of debates which seemed to reflect on the measures of his party the Duke of Marlborough distinguished himself in favour of the Earl of Galway Though he himself had been well received by the Queen upon his arrival from Holland in the end of December he found that his power had totally vanished He had assisted at a committee of the council But this was a matter of mere form He was no favourite with the new ministry He had no longer the command of the parliament A motion of thanks having been made by his friends in the house of lords it was opposed with such vehemence by the Duke of Argyle that a censure was more likely to pass than a vote of approbation Notwithstanding these mortifications he resolved to retain his command In this he yielded to the request of the allies or perhaps to his love of money Finding however that the aversion of the Queen to his Dutchess was not to be overcome he carried a surrender of all her places to the foot of the throne On the the anniversary of the birth of the Queen he did not as usual appear at court He had retired to the country and on the eighteenth of February he embarked for Holland to concert with the States the operations of a very early campaign  Life of Marlborough    Immense supplies  Though the inquiry of the ministry into the conduct of their predecessors was attended with no dangerous consequences to the latter some facts were brought to light that argued an extreme negligence in the Earl of Godolphin Upon an examination of the public accounts  and the state of the public debts it appeared that vast sums remained unprovided for in the different departments of the war The most innocent motive to which the conduct of the late minister can be ascribed on this head is that he wished to conceal from the nation the insufficiency of the immense supplies that had been granted to prevent a relaxation in the public ardour for the continuance of a war which it was the chief object of the party to prolong The enemies of the late treasurer affirmed that it was to prevent an inquiry in parliament he had encouraged the solemn prosecution of Sacheverell as the certain means of diverting the attention of the two houses from his own conduct The debts of the navy alone amounted to more than five millions and near the sum of one million five hundred thousand pounds was found necessary to discharge the incumbrances of the ordnance and army  Journals of the Commons March  Over and above these prodigious sums the commons granted to the Queen an extraordinary supply of five hundred thousand pounds for reestablishing the affairs of Spain and Portugal four hundred and fifty thousand for giving currency to exchequerbills near three hundred thousand pounds for the extraordinary contingencies of the war one hundred thousand for indemnifying the inhabitants of Nevis and St Christophers for the damage done by a French invasion of those islands three hundred and fifty thousand pounds for building new churches and nine thousand three hundred and seventyfive pounds being a subsidy due by the late King William to the Elector of Hannover  Journals passim Hannoverpapers    Rise of the South Sea company  The Whigs had endeavoured to raise an opinion among the people that the credit of the nation was ruined by the removal of the Earl of Godolphin from the treasury The new chancellor of the exchequer soon convinced them that these surmises were illfounded He provided for the debts left on the different departments by his predecessor by funds settled on very judicious imposts On the second of May he proposed a grand project to the commons for satisfying all the public debts and for making good all desiciencies of supplies The whole debt  provided for was thrown into one stock To pay an  interest of six per cent funds were established which however were not to commence till the end of five years The funds being so distant the parliament engaged themselves to make an annual provision for the interest in the intermediate time Together with this interest the monopoly of a supposed trade to the SouthSea or coast of Peru in America was granted to the proprietors The possessors of the navybills and other public securities were incorporated for this purpose This scheme which was received with eagerness by the commons flattered extremely the vanity of Harley himself In his attention for the house of Hannover he advised the Elector to take stock for the nine thousand pounds due to his family of King William's subsidy His Electoral Highness excused himself from being concerned in a mercantile company as inconsistent with his dignity He at the same time insinuated to Harley that ready money would suit better with the state of his affairs than any concern in public stocks and commerce subjects which he neither studied nor understood  Hannoverpapers  The proposal seems to have raised some doubts in the mind of his Highness whether Harley intended ever to pay the money He therefore sent particular instructions to Kreyenberg his resident at London how to proceed with the chancellor of the exchequer in that affair  Elector to Kreye  +berg Hannoverpapers    Affair of the Abbé de la Bourlie  Though Harley had rendered himself in some degree popular by his conduct in the treasury his seeming backwardness in turning all the Whigs out of office had disobliged the highflying part of the Tories A kind of opposition was ready to be formed against his measures when an accident which threatened to be fatal raised him beyond the reach of the enemies of his power The Abbé de la Bourlie a Frenchman who had assumed the title of Marquis de Guiscard had made his escape from his own country for some crime which merited the ultimate animadversion of the law Having passed some years before into Britain he had the address to persuade the servants of the Crown that he could form an insurrection in France that might greatly favour the operations of the confederates against that kingdom Thi  profligate fellow pretending a zeal for public freedom was encouraged either through the vanity or credulity of the Whigministry and gratified with a regiment which served in Spain The professed design of this needy adventurer was to restore his country to her ancient liberty To contribute to the execution of his purpose he was placed on board the Euglish fleet in the year when a descent under the Earl of Rivers was intended to be made on the coast of France This assertor of the cause of freedom was however found to be such a tyrant in command that Sir Cloudesly Shovel thought it necessary to set him on shore before the expedition was laid aside  Publications of the Times    or Marquis de Guiscard  The regiment assigned to the pretended Marquis having been cut off in the battle of Almanza his pay as colonel soon after ceased He long solicited a settled pension in vain His profligacy having recommended him to Mr Henry St John they lived together for some time in mutual confidence and a community of pleasures A dispute about a mistress or rather concerning a child which neither chose to own had interrupted their intimacy before St John had been advanced through the fall of the Whigministry to the office of secretary of state The latter therefore was hardly prevailed upon by his French friend to recommend him as an object worthy of the generosity of the crown He however mentioned the case of Guiscard and five hundred pounds a year was ordered for him by the Queen Harley not only reduced the pension to four hundred pounds but even declined to place it on any fixed establishment The pretended Marquis endeavoured to obtain redress from the Queen But all access to her person was denied Reduced to distress by his profligacy and offended at men who had been once his friends he endeavoured to reconcile himself to his own country by betraying to the court of France the counsels of the British ministry He entered into correspondence with one Morreau a banker at Paris To cover his design he sent his letters to Portugal inclosed to the Earl of Portmore who commanded the British troops in that kingdom The Earl suspecting some treachery opened  the packet and finding that it contained some dangerous intelligence sent it through the hands of his lady to Mr Harley  Publications of the Times    He stabs Harley  The Marquis was apprehended in St James's park on the eighth of March by virtue of a warrant from St John as secretary of state Ignorant of the laws of the country and conscious of his own crime he thought he could not escape a death of ignominy He fell into a fit of despair In the midst of his disorder he was carried to the cockpit before a committee of the council Having possessed himself unobserved of a penknife he resolved to be revenged on those whom he deemed accessary to his ruin When he sound himself completely discovered by his own letters he requested to speak aside to St John But the secretary suspecting his design from the violence of his aspect refused to comply The Marquis approaching furiously towards the table stabbed Harley right in the breast with the penknife The point meeting by accident the bone the blade broke short near the handle Guiscatd insensible of this circumstance redoubled his blows St John starting in the mean time from his chair drew his sword and wounded him in several places The messengers rushing in at the noise threw the assassin on the ground and having bound him carried him to Newgate where he soon after died of his wounds  Hist d'Angleter      Harley made Earl of Oxford and lord treasurer  Though Harley's wound was but slight the very attempt on his life raised a kind of pity that disarmed his enemies The commons addressed the Queen upon the occasion in terms highly flattering to the minister When after his recovery he came first to the house he was congratulated at their desire by the speaker in a speech expressive of their high sense of his power if not of his merit To these testimonies of affection from the commons the Queen added favours of a more substantial kind She raised Harley to the double title of Earl of Oxford and Mortimer on the twentyfourth of May and on the twentyninth of the same month he received the white staff as lordhightreasurer of Grea  Britain Though his lordship was considered in the dou+ble  capacity of favourite and minister before this period these new honours and promotions rendered him still more an object of the public attention The adulation of men in office kept pace with his good fortune When he took the oaths in the court of chancery on the first of June Sir Simon Harcourt the lordkeeper addressed him in a set speech paying him great compliments on the antiquity of his family his love and encouragement of letters his great abilities in managing the finances of the kingdom and in restoring and preserving public credit  Printed speech    Parallel between him and the Earl of Rochester  The death of Lawrence Hyde Earl of Rochester which happened on the second of May was said to have facilitated the sudden rise of Harley to the rank of a peer and the office of lord treasurer Though Rochester on account of his high principles in church and state was by no means agreeable to Harley the latter found it necessary to fortify himself against the Whigs with his lordship's abilities and influence Their characters however were so dissimilar that those who knew best the secrets of the cabinet thought they already perceived a mutual coldness Rochester was an avowed enemy to all dissimulation Harley threw a veil of secrecy importance and reserve even upon trifles The first avowed his attachment to the Tory principles The latter suppressed his zeal for Whigism as it might defeat his ambitious views Rochester loved monarchy and the government of the few over the many and avowed it to the world Harley had a bias toward republicanism but carefully concealed it even from his friends The one was haughty and overbearing though a man of sense experience and abilities The other was sensible of his own talents but he was rather conceited than proud though the first complied with the government ever  ce the Revolution he openly called that event  ch a breach upon the constitution as would justify for  er alterations of every kind Though the last opposed  ing William throughout his reign he approved in  ret of the means which placed that Prince upon the  one Both were vain of their knowledge in finance  th jealous of their favour with the Queen No permanent  cordiality was likely to subsist between such men and had not death interfered their contests would probably have given an advantage to their common enemies which might prove fatal to their power  Menager's Negociations passim    Coldness between Harley and St John  But though the death of the Earl of Rochester delivered Harley from one dangerous friend he was still connected with another who endeavoured to supplant him in his influence and power This was Mr Henry St John then secretary of state St John was hated by Mrs Masham and detested by the Queen for the profligacy of his life But he found means to render Harley uneasy even in the height and plenitude of his credit and power The slenderness of the tenure upon which he held his office had hurt his pride The minister having resolved upon the scheme of a peace St John became necessary to the accomplishment of his views He was the only person about the court that could speak the French language  Stuartpap    There was therefore a necessity for retaining him in office to serve in the capacity of interpreter This slight advantage had created in hi  mind a contempt of Harley suitable to his own vanit  and pride An incident had happened in the month o  April which placed St John in a kind of independenc  on the minister An expedition being planned in th  cabinet for the conquest of Quebec and the reductio  of Canada Harley refused to gratify Mrs Masham i  some affair relating to the expedition which she mean  to turn to her own advantage She resented Harley's re+fusal St John dextrously improved the moment H  gratified her in her views without either the commu  +cation or assistance of the minister Her objection to S  John's character was obliterated by his politeness a  she ever after supported his ambition  MS Anecdotes    ews  While Harley was rising rapidly in influence and  +dit in Great Britain the court of St Germains gra  +ing as usual at

servants of the Pretender that they ought to expect more from the temper of the times than the disposition of the minister They recommended a second attempt on Scotland They said that the inclinations of the Scots for the excluded family was apparent from their sending to parliament those very persons who had been carried prisoners to London on account of the invasion threatened two years before They affirmed that the kingdom was left naked of troops That upon the first news of an invasion the bank would stop and the funds fail That no tax could be raised no money obtained on the securities established by parliament That should the Pretender land with any considerable force the want of resources in government and the opinion of a great part of the nation in favour of his right to the throne would crown his attempt with success without drawing a sword  Stuartpapers April  They hoped that the Queen and ministry would by these means be induced to enter into a treaty which might end

place her confidence The Duke of Leeds undertook to sound her upon the subject  Ibid  Though she knew his principles she was afraid of explaining herself upon a point so delicate The more violent

professions of zeal for the protestant succession But the servile slattery of their letters contributed to render their sincerity suspected St John assured the Elector that in a life sufficiently agitated he had been uniformly devoted to his service That as he gloried in these sentiments he took every opportunity of discovering them to the world That should he be capable of changing his

During these secret transactions in Britain the face of public affairs in Europe suffered a very important change The Emperor Joseph died at Vienna of the smallpox on the sixth of April in the thirtythird year of his age  Hist d'Allemagne  om vii  Without regarding his two daughters he left his brother Charles King of Spain his universal heir in all the dominions of the house of Austria Joseph possessed more activity and fire than the most of the Princes of his family But that temper of mind subjected his counsels to all the inconveniencies resulting from precipitation and violence An obstinacy that bore the appearance of firmness ran through his whole conduct He was however a Prince possessed of virtue and his reign was one continued series of success and good fortune He saw all Lombardy conquered by his arms Piedmont delivered Hungary pacified Naples and a great part of the Netherlands reduced to obedience His death suddenly changed the whole state of affairs The war undertaken by the grand alliance for preserving the balance of Europe was now likely to destroy it for ever and men who judged of the future by the past began to dread the revival of the irresistable power of the Emperor Charles the Fifth in the person of a Prince of his family  Hist d'Angleterre tom iii    creates a desire of peace  Though the new ministry of Great Britain had hitherto carefully concealed their sentiments the restoration of the public tranquillity had been the principal object of their counsels ever since they possessed themselves of  ower The nation ceasing to be amused with unpro  table victories began to feel the weight of the war The public debt had grown to a magnitude that terrified  peculative men with the approach of public ruin The  ppropriation of the produce of severe imposts had de  rived the people of every prospect of relief from their  resent burdens To prevent the increase of these bur  ens was all that could now be expected Men there  ore in general began to wish sincerely that an honour  ble end might be put to the war But though the mi  istry were sufficiently apprized of this disposition in the  nation they were afraid of the violence of their political opponents They knew that France encouraged by the death of the Emperor would recede from the terms offered to their predecessors and they were no strangers to the advantage which their enemies would derive from such a circumstance They began therefore to feel the ground as they went with great caution and address The Queen in an extraordinary message informed her parliament of the death of the Emperor and of her own resolution to make the election fall upon his brother the King of Spain She told at the same time to the two houses that she hoped to be soon in a condition to put a happy end to the war by a lasting and honourable peace  Journals April    The allies bent on war  The intentions of the Queen were well understood by her parliament They promised therefore to support her in all her measures for the restoration of the public tranquillity The news of the Emperor's death had not raised the same pacific disposition in Holland A resolution was formed on the contrary to prosecute the war with still greater vigour The minister of the late Emperor those of Savoy Portugal and the German Princes were all eager for a continuance of hostilities The emoluments derived from the war were greater than their expectations from peace The generals and those who furnished the troops were equally interested upon this subject The first were swayed by glory and perhaps the less dignified motive of advantage The latter yielded to profit alone The interest of both was another name for the common cause This was the great chain which kept together the confederacy and not the preservation of the balance or the liberties of Europe The money of the maritime powers and chiefly of England more than the territories of the house of Bourbon was the grand object of those petty tyrants who fed on the blood of subjects whom they let out for slaughter  Campaign of Flanders  But though Great Britain had discovered an inclination towards a peace the war was carried on with a degree of vigour on every side The Duke of Marlborough  having left the Hague in the end of April assembled hi  army near Douay in the beginning of May The pro+ject  of the allies on the side of Flanders was to open the campaign with the siege of Arras and of Cambray The taking of those two important places would have laid open Picardy to the banks of the Somme The army destined at first for the service might have been sufficient to accomplish that great design But the death of the Emperor while it hastened the approach of peace obstructed the operations of war A wellgrounded fear that the French and the partisans of the Electors of Bavaria and Cologn might endeavour to disturb the election of a new Emperor obliged the Prince of Savoy to march with the greatest part of the German troops to the banks of the Rhine The Mareschal de Villars strongly posted behind his lines at Arleux disappointed all the efforts of Marlborough for bringing things to the decision of a battle The Duke on bad terms with the ministry foresaw his own disgrace was near He therefore wished earnestly either to overwhelm his political enemies with the splendour of a great victory or at least to retire under the shelter of an action of renown The strong position of the French the resolution of their general not to abandon the fate of the kingdom to the event of a battle deprived the Duke of the opportunity which he so much desired Having possessed himself of Arleux a place considerable only from its commanding the Scarpe he was driven from thence by the enemy But he sat down before Bouchain in sight of the enemy and took that important place on the thirteenth of September The armies remained in the field till the month of October when the Duke closed at once his own military exploits and the campaign  In Germany Savoy and Spain  Nothing important happened on the side of Germany  Hist d'Alemagne tom vii  The Duke of Berwick without any effort of consequence defended Dauphiné and Provence against the allies commanded by General Thaun  Hist de France  om iii  In Spain the taking of Gironne by the Duke de Noailles formed almost the whole operations of the present campaign The Spaniards and Portuguese hovered throughout the summer and autumn without any action on the frontiers of Estramadura  Hist de Portugal tom ii  A general languor prevailed  on every side of the war Both parties fatigued with fruitless hostilities seemed willing to transfer their contests from the field to the cabinet As the death of one Prince of the house of Austria had roused all Europe to arms so the demise of another was destined to restore it to peace On the first of October Charles the Third King of Spain was chosen Emperor by the unanimous consent of all the electors The wretched situation of France prevented her from making the least effort against the elevationof her greatest enemy But had she even had the power she ought not to have the inclination to frustrate the election The Imperial crown seemed actually to exclude the new Emperor from that of Spain The great motive of the war was removed from all the confederates It was not the interest of the German Princes to place in the hands of their master the power of oppressing themselves It was not to be supposed that either Britain or the States after having expended their blood and treasure in breaking the power of one family would raise that of another on its ruins  Naval affairs  The operations by sea were less important if possible than those by land  Naval History  The combined fleet of the maritime powers was as usual numerous inactive and expensive The extraordinary charge of the navy of Grea  Britain during the war had amounted to twenty milli+ons sterling Little advantage was derived from this ex+pence except the reputation of commanding the seas  But the glory of a nation it must be confessed can neve  be purchased at too high a price An expedition in+tended against Quebec and Canada failed because th  navigation of the river St Lawrence was then unknow  The squadron employed in that service was persecute  throughout by misfortunes They lost ten transports  the coast of

house of Bourbon  The langour with which the war was carried on by the confederates seemed to indicate a disposition towards peace No open advances were however made by either side to establish conferences to restore the public tranquillity France had derived nothing but an increase of demands from all the proposals she had hitherto laid before the allies The death of the Emperor Joseph an event of the utmost importance to the house of Bourbon had induced the court of Versailles to remain on the defensive during the campaign and to trust their fate to the favourable circumstances which might arise in the course of time Though the barrier had been broken in a great measure in Flanders they found that the progress of the enemy could be still checked by a judicious position of their army behind their lines In Spain the aversion of the people to the house of Austria and their consequent affection for Philip the Fifth had raised a domestic force sufficient to check if not to disappoint all the efforts of the allies The nation in an uninterrupted series of hostilities for ten years had caught a martial fire from their very misfortunes The very poverty to which they had been reduced by their own exertions and the depredations of the enemy had rendered them more indifferent about the terms of peace as they had nothing to lose by the war  and of the British ministry  Though the ministry of Great Britain had provided  mple supplies for continuing at present the war they  ecame anxious concerning the future means of restoring  eace The Earl of Oxford in his late exertion in pro  iding funds for the debt of the nation had by appro  riating so much of the revenue deprived himself of re  urces There was a necessity therefore to fall back  ith loss of reputation into the state in which he had  und the nation or to extricate himself and the kingdom  om the war by an immediate peace A secret jea  usy of the power of the Duke of Marlborough perhaps  ntributed more than the state of public affairs to for  ard the pacific measures of the Earl of Oxford Though  e ministy had determined to abridge a part of the Duke's  wer as he was provoked beyond measure he was an  ject of terror To conclude a peace was the only  eans to reduce to the rank of a private subject a person  ho had gained such credit in the course of the war He  was himself no stranger to the delicate situation in which he stood He knew that his whole consequence to himself and his party would instantly vanish when he ceased to command the army and he resolved to disregard mortifications and to retain in his hands the only means that could render him formidable to his opponents  Advances made by them  The British ministy had very early become so eager for peace that scare any obstacle remained to obstruct their views but a safe secret and sufficient way to communicate their sentiments to the French King During the embassy of the Mareschal de Tallard to King William one Gaultier a priest attended him to England and read mass in the ambassador's chapel at London This man having insinuated himself into the family of the Earl of Jersey whose lady was a Romancatholic remained in Britain after the departure of Tallard with a professed intention of becoming an useful spy for France during the war which was then apprehended on account of the Spanish succession Gaultier regarding his own safety more than the interest of his country gave no intelligence of consequence He continued therefore without being suspected in London and divided his time between the duties of his function in the Imperial ambassador's chapel and his attention to the family of the Earl of Jersey That nobleman being connected with the new ministry recommended Gaultier as a man whose discretion they could trust and whose obscurity was sufficient to prevent all suspicion of their design  M de Torcy tom ii    towards a peace  The ministry having agreed to the proposal of Jersey employed the Earl to give verbal instructions to Gaultier and to send him immediately to France They signified their own inclinations towards a peace They affirmed that they thought the restoration of the public tranquillity highly necessary to the welfare of Grea  Britain They at the same time explained the impos+sibility of their entering into private and separate negoci+ations with France But they promised that should pro+posals be made by the French King for renewing th  conferences with the Statesgeneral the British ambassa+dors should receive such orders as should deprive th  Dutch of the power of hindering the conclusion of a g  +neral  peace The Abbé Gaultier having left London in the first week in January arrived in a few days at Versailles His proposals were received with an eagerness suitable to the distresses of France But the servants of Lewis the Fourteenth justly judging that they had more to hope from the facility of the British ministry than from the haughty obstinacy of the States returned a prudent answer They charged the Abbé Gaultier to inform the Earl of Jersey that the King would hear no more of peace by the way of Holland But that he should be extremely glad to put an end to the war by the interposition of Great Britain  M de Torcy tom ii    A memorial from France  The Abbé having brought back to London this answer the ministry agreed to grant the request of the court of France They however signified their hopes that Lewis the Fourteenth would not offer conditions to Great Britain less advantageous than those he had proposed to the States General at the late conferences of Gertrudenberg A memorial was accordingly drawn up in form by the court of Versailles The British ministry received it in the end of April and transmitted it to the States as a foundation for a general peace The cession of Spain to the house of Austria was neither promised by France nor insisted on by Great Britain The death of the Emperor had given a new turn to the opinions of the speculative with regard to the balance of power Besides the Spaniards found themselves capable to defend themselves against the efforts of the allies after the advantage at Baheuga and the battle of VillaViciosa The terms offered by Philip the Fifth were equally advantageous to Britain with those promised by Charles the third and the nation was in no condition to continue wantonly a war that ceased to have an important ob  ct  State of the Times MS    Preliminary demands  Though the British minister was eager for peace the  egociations were in some measure suspended by the  emands of his own ambition When he obtained the  tle of Earl of Oxsord and the staff of lordtreasurer his  w dignities while they added weight to his measures  ecame motives for his acclerating the restoration of the  ublic tranquillity The States having complained that  the memorial of the court of France was too general to be admitted as a proper foundation for the renewal of the conferences Mr Prior was sent in company with the Abbé Gaultier to the court of Versailles He was directed only to communicate the demands of Great Britain which pursuant to the new method lately introduced by the allies were called preliminary articles The memorial which he presented contained the pretensions of the confederates in general and the advantages expected in particular by the British nation Sufficient barriers were demanded for the Empire and the States on the side of the Rhine and in Flanders The Dutch were to receive security for their commerce The strong places taken from the Duke of Savoy were to be restored and that Prince was to be permitted to possess himself of such towns and districts in Italy as were particularly mentioned in the treaties between him and the allies  M de Torcy tom ii Hist of Europe Publication MSS passim    of Great Britain  The particular demands of Great Britain consisted in the acknowledgment of the title of Queen Anne and the succession of the crown in the Protestant line the demolition of Dunkirk a new treaty of commerce the cession of Gibraltar and Portmahon the Negrotrade in America some towns as refreshing places for the ships employed in the transportation of slaves to that part of the world The British ministry also demanded that the advantages in commerce already granted or hereafter to be allowed by Spain to the most favoured nation should be extended to the subjects of Great Britain That France should either restore or cede the island of New foundland and Hudson's Bay and Streights These articles were by particular desire to remain a profound secret not to be revealed but by the mutual consent of the contracting parties Three other conditions of a more general nature were prefixed as absolutely essential to the conclusion of peace A security that the crowns of France and Spain should never be united on the same head That satisfaction should be given to all the allies in their just demands That commerce should be thoroughly reestablished and permanently maintained  Report of the secret committee    Menager sent privately to London  The powers granted to Prior were extremely confined He was only to communicate these preliminary demands to the French ministry and to bring back their answer He insisted therefore on a positive answer in writing containing an absolute consent or a downright refusal To grant either was deemed equally dangerous by France A consent would ruin the trade of that kingdom A refusal might break off the negociation and involve the house of Bourbon in all the miseries of a war which had already been unfortunate beyond the example of former times To avoid those inconveniences the French King proposed to transfer the negociations to London He informed Prior that since he was not sufficiently authorized to treat in France he intended on his own part to send a person thoroughly instructed to Great Britain to treat directly with the ministry under the immediate inspection of the Sovereign Menager deputy from the city of Rouen was the person to whose prudence and knowledge the court of France resolved to trust this important business The terms which Menager was instructed to grant were to be confined with regard to the Empire to a bare renewal of the treaty of Riswick But the French King demanded as an essential condition the restoration of the Electors of Cologn and Bavaria to their dominions honours and dignities He pretended for himself to the restitution of Lisle Tournay Aire Bethune and Douay  De Torcy tom ii    The negociation becomes public  The journey of Prior as well as its object remained a secret from the public till he returned to England accmpanied by Menager in the first week of August Having landed from a small vessel at Deal he was detained by the customhouse officers till he was released by orders from London One Mackay was the person whose intemperate vigilance made this unseasonable discovery This busy man having imposed himself upon King William as a spy upon the court of St Germains had been gratified with a commission to direct the packet  oats at Dover In gratitude for what he had received  nd perhaps in expectation of more he held a constant  orrespondence with the secretary of state's office mix  ng a great deal of conjecture with a small portion of intelligence  When Prior passed clandestinely from Dover to Calais Mackay wrote to Mr Secretary St John that an English gentleman had taken his passage to France St John to conceal the affair from the public desired Mackay to keep the thing a secret and to watch the man's return  by accident  These instructions were better followed by Mackay than St John intended That officious servant employed all his people between the Forelands to watch the return of Prior He at length had advice that a vessel had landed at Deal three persons with Secretary St John's pass He made haste to Canterbury and met there his old acquaintance Matthew Prior under a feigned name Mackay dispatched immediately an express to the Duke of Marlborough then besieging Bouchain with this important intelligence He informed also the Earl of Sunderland of what he had heard and seen and that nobleman communicated to the Imperial and Dutch ambassadors his fixed opinion that negociations of peace were begun Marlborough sent a copy of Mackay's letter to Secretary St John The informer was dismissed from office But the mischief was already done The Imperial minister expostulated with the ministry concerning the secret negociations which were suspected to subsist between Great Britain and France He was told by way of answer that he had no reason to be alarmed That the Queen was resolved never to hearken to any terms of peace that might derogate from her engagements with her allies The intercourse between the two court being no longer a secret the substance of the projected treaty of peace was carried to the press by the opposing party and eagerly defended by the friends of the ministry  The famous Dr Jonathan Swift employed his abilitie  in favour of the measures of the crown Prior was no  an indifferent spectator of a contest in which he himsel  was personally concerned  Publications of the Times    It is defended by the ministry  Obvious arguments were introduced with a vehe+mence and rhetoric that made a great impression on th  minds of a people already labouring under the heavy bur+dens of an unprofitable war They affirmed that th  death of the Emperor had changed the whole face of a  +fairs That the dangers which the war was intended  prevent were now likely to arise from its success That a Prince of the house of Austria succeeding to the Empire and the hereditary dominions of his family and possessing already the Spanish territories in Italy would be a more formidable King of Spain than any Prince of the house of Bourbon when excluded from the succession of France That the balance of power in Europe would be effectually destroyed by such a measure That the only thing to be expected from a peace that should place Charles the Third on the Spanish throne would be a renewal of hoftilities That to restore the balance which such a measure must inevitably destroy the whole fabric built at the expence of so much treasure and blood must be destroyed by the same hands by which it was raised To reconcile the nation to the cession of Spain to the house of Bourbon they affirmed that the dependence of Philip the Fifth on French councils would certainly cease at the death of his grandfather an event not far distant considering the great age of that Prince and they closed their arguments with observing that the total cession of the Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria was now a thing impracticable as that monarchy was actually dismembered by the cessions made to the Duke Savoy and the conquests of the British and Dutch nations  Political Pamphlets    Their caution  Though political timidity formed none of the faults of  e Earl of Oxford he observed a degree of caution in  eating with Menager He entered with great free  m and an apparent zeal into conferences with the  rench minister But he as well as other plenipotenti  es named by the Queen declined to become an ostensi  party in the treaty The special preliminaries in sub  ance the same that had been offered through Mr Prior  the court of Great Britain were signed by Menager  the twentyseventh of September They were how  er accepted and signed only by the Earl of Darmouth  Mr St John by virtue of a warrant granted for that  pose by the Queen It was also observable that nei  r the warrant nor any one paper in the whole trans  ion was countersigned by any of the Queen's servants  e ministry knew that they were watched by their enemies  on an occasion so critical and they resolved to prevent the very fear of danger should the negociation prove abortive and they themselves lose their power But though the servants of the crown observed such caution in the negociation they seemed determined to support the preliminary articles On the ninth of October a copy was delivered to the Imperial ambassador Count Galas That minister with a precipitation more suitable to his zeal for his master than to common prudence published the articles in a newspaper with a view of appealing from the government to the people  Publications of the Times passim Burnet vol    They resolve to proceed  The publication of the preliminary articles changed in some measure the current of public opinion which had hitherto run favourably for the minister Though the people in general wished for peace they expected very splendid conditions after such uncommon successes in the war The usual jealousy of the populace was inflamed by the arts of the excluded party The preliminaries were called captious infidious and insufficient the peace to be expected from them unsafe and dishonourable But neither Oxford nor his associates were now to be intimidated from the prosecution of their pacific designs To testify at once to the world their resolution to adhere to the preliminaries offered by France they ordered the Imperial minister to come no more to court and to make preparations for quitting the kingdom The precipitate vehemence of that minister rendered in some measure necessary a proceeding which was as unusual as it was severe He spoke in open and high terms again  the measures of the ministry He held clandestine and nightly meetings with their political enemies and  by joining intrigues to insolence rendered himself extremely obnoxious to the Queen as well as to her servants  Ibid Hist d'Angleterre    The Ea  l of Strafford sent to the Hague  The preparations which the ministry had made to extricate themselves from the war upon any decent terms were neither lately begun nor pursued without prudence  They had sent the Abbé Gaultier to France in the beginning of the year they removed the Viscou  Townshend on whose attachment to themselves  could not much depend from the office of ambassador to the Statesgeneral The Lord Raby who had for several years served in the like capacity at the court of Prussia succeeded Townshend in the month of March This nobleman's chief recommendation to such a distinguished office was his high Tory principles and his known aversion to the interests of the Duke of Marlborough His parts were feeble and uncomprehensive No knowledge of Books no just observations on mankind enlightened a mind which nature had left confused and obscure  Hannoverpapers Swift's Notes on Mackay MS  His most splendid virtue was personal courage which he displayed upon various occasions before he quitted the field for the business of the cabinet But his attachment to his party was more to be considered than his abilities in discharging the duties of the office to which he was raised Having been created Earl of Strafford in the beginning of September he was ordered by the Queen to repair to Holland to lay before the States the preliminaries which she had accepted from the court of France Strafford having arrived at the Hague communicated to the pensionary Heinsius the preliminary articles settled between Great Britain and France The States having had several secret conferences declared to the British ambassador that they found the articles so general and obscure that they were afraid they were illcalculated for serving as a foundation to a formal treaty That for this reason their High Mightinesses had appointed M Buys their envoy extraordinary to explain to the Queen of Great Britain their sentiments and their fears upon that subject Buys accordingly arrived in London on the eighteenth of October But neither the representation of the States nor the vehemence and intrigues of their envoy were capable to change or even to shake the resolution formed by the Queen She ordered her ambassador to press the States to determine on a proper place for holding the congress She required at the same time that passports should be sent immediately to the plenipotentiaries of France and she referred Buys upon the whole to the orders already transmitted to the Earl of Strassord at the Hague  Hist d'Angleterre M de Torcy tom ii    Intrigues of Buys the Dutch envoy  This firmness of the Queen and her servants may in some measure be ascribed to the insolence and imprudence of the Dutch minister himself He hoped to kindle such a flame against the pacific intentions of the court as might terrify them into a continuance of the war He scarce observed common decency in his declamations against the Queen and her ministers He represented them as traitors to their country as enemies to the confederates and pensioners of France He invited all malecontents whether British or foreigners to his table He used all the means which either passion or malevolence could suggest to ruin the servants of the crown in the opinions of the nation His chief and most intimate connexion was with the Baron de Bothmar the envoy of the Elector of Hannover That minister having passed from Holland to London in company with the Duke of Marlborough entered into all the schemes of Buys To increase the rising clamour of the people he presented a strong memorial against the preliminaries in the name of his master  Printed Memorial  This paper probably penned or at least suggested by the Whigs themselves gave great satisfaction to that party But it was extremely impolitic as it might conbute to throw the ministry in the scale of the Pretender  The Elector of Hannover opposes the peace  The Elector himself in a letter to the Earl of Oxford expressedd his highest disapprobation of the projected peace He affirmed that the fruits of a glorious war would be lost should Spain and the Indies be abandoned to the Duke of Anjou That France would soon give laws to Europe and frustrate all the wise measures taken by the Queen to secure a permanent and solid prosperity for her people  Elector to Oxford Nov Hannover papers  He therefore conjured his lordship to use all his credit to prevent such a misfortune The Emperor who hoped to gain most by the war shewed the greatest vehemence against the peace He sent letters to all the circles of Germany requesting and requiring all the Princes to adhere to his cause He wrote in strong terms to Queen Anne herself The solicitatio  of foreign powers were aided with all their address by the Whigs at home In imitation of the famous Earl  Shaftesbury they prepared to inflame the people with an expensive popeburning on the seventeenth of November But the ministry were neither to be intimidated nor swayed from their purpose The States perceiving their obstinacy yielded to a current which they could no longer oppose Buys produced at length passports in their name to the plenipotentiaries of France Utrecht was appointed for holding the congress which was to be opened on the twelfth of January  Publications of the Times    Secret and dangerous designs  But though the States in their public conduct affected to yield to the inclinations of the British court they were forming secret measures that seemed to threaten a second revolution in the goverment of the kingdom Under the supposition that the Queen was resolved not to furnish her usual proportion of the force employed in Flanders the Dutch in concert with the Emperor intended to seize the British troops in the Netherlands France informed of this design communicated the intelligence to Queen Anne But her servants were already apprized of all the clandestine machinations of their enemies They knew that the whole behaviour of the Count de Galas and his stay in Britain after he had been excluded from the privilege of appearing at court were founded on a conspiracy formed at London The real motive of his delay was to see the result of the mobish procession for burning the Pope the Devil and the Pretender which the Whigs intended to render subservient to the exciting an insurrection The success of the project being uncertain Galas by the advice of the Earl of Sunderland wrote for Prince Eugene as the last resort Under pretence of paying their respects to that distinguished general the party were to conduct him to London with two thousand horse His public entry was to have been on the day of the burning of the Pope and his associates It was from their being apprized of this circumstance that the ministry seized the figures destined to be carried by the populace in the intended procession  M de Torcy tom ii Stuartpapers    of the Whigs and the confederates  During those secret machinations the Earl of Sunderland and the lord Halifax the most active of the leaders of the malecontents endeavoured to engage the people  in their own cause They boldly affirmed that the chief view of the present administration was to restore the Pretender The Queen they said was already betrayed The nation were ready to be also deceived There was a necessity they averred for sending for the Elector or his son otherwise the protestant succession they said was in imminent danger The Queen was in a declining state of health She was kept alive they affirmed by art by cordials and strong medicines prescribed by her physicians Anne herself was no stranger to these conspiracies formed by her subjects She knew the countenance given by the allies to the designs of the malecontents in her kingdom Her eagerness for peace increased in proportion to her fears The French king was not insensible of the difficulty of her situation But as the reestablishment of peace had long employed all his wishes and thoughts he complied with all her demands Her servants were equally eager with herself for the immediate restoration of the public tranquillity A time of suspense was to them a period of danger Their domestic enemies were on the watch for their errors and the confederates were prepared to support the Whigs with vigour  De Torcy tom ii Stuartpapers Nov    Marlborough communicates  When his party were forming schemes to support his power the Duke of Marlborough yielded to that political despondence to which he was frequently subject Disappointed in his views at home he began according to custom to turn his eyes toward the court of St Germains He admitted their agents to his privacy and conversation He signified his unalterable attachment to the Pretender and his zeal to obtain her dowry for the exiled Queen He regretted that he was not likely to be employed in concluding the peace as he might have done in that case essential service to the OLD cause He assured them that he considered the payment of the dowry as a great point toward the reestablishment of the excluded line  "The eyes of the people"  he said  "will be gradually opened They will see their intere  in restoring their King"  for so he called the pretende  Prince of Wales His cause he affirmed had gained  much ground of late years that he solemnly swore it could not but come to a happy issue Both sides he averred would find themselves obliged to have recourse to the excluded Prince for solid peace and internal happiness  "Not from any true principles of conscience or honesty"  the Duke was pleased to say  "for I do not believe that either party is swayed by any of these  Stuartpapers Nov  "  his vehement zeal and offers  The Duke descended from these observations to articles of information and advice  "The French King and his ministers"  he said  "will sacrifice every thing to their own views of peace The Earl of Oxford and his associates in office to take as usual the ground of their adversaries will probably insist upon THE KING's retiring to Italy But he must never consent He must yield neither to the French King nor to the fallacious insinuations of the British ministry in a point which must inevitably ruin his cause To retire to Italy"  the Duke swore  "by the living God is the same thing as to stab him to the heart Let him take refuge in Germany in some country on this side of the Alps He wants no security for his person None will touch a hair of his head I perceive such a change in his favour that I think it impossible but he must succeed But when he shall succeed let there be no retrospect toward the past All that has been done since the Revolution must be confirmed His business is to gain all by offending none As for myself I take God to witness that what I have done for many years was neither from spleen to the ROYAL FAMILY nor illwill to their cause but to humble the power of France a service as useful to the KING as it is beneficial to his kingdom"  his advice to the Pretender  "Peace"  he said  "must certainly happen The people stand in need of tranquillity on both sides The current of the nation now seconds the views of the minister But peace and all that has been done favours the cause of THE KING God who rules above seems visibly to dispose all for the best But neither Whigs nor Tories can ever be depended upon as parties Their professions are always different Their views precisely the same They both grasp at the possession of power The Prince who gives them the most is their greatest favourite  As for me I have been treated unworthily but God has blessed me with a great deal of temper and forbearance of mind I have taken my resolution to be quiet I have determined to wait my time But if Harley will push me further he shall know of what metal I am made As for the King's affairs occasion is only wanting to my zeal God Almighty has placed matters in such a train that he must at any rate succeed I know perfectly his sister's disposition of mind She is a very HONEST PERSON easily won and without difficulty swayed She is extremely cautious as she is to the last degree subject to fear At bottom she has no aversion to her brother's interest But she is one that must not be frightened An external force would terrify her and alienate the minds of the nation Leave us therefore to ourselves and all your hopes will be crowned with success  Stuartpapers  "  He arrives in England Affair of the Scotish medal  A few days after the Duke of Marlborough had made these vehement assurances to the Pretender he embarked for England accompanied by the Baron de Bothmar the minister of the Elector of Hannover He had undertaken in the same warm manner to support the interest of his Highness and scarce any doubt can be formed of his being instrumental in persuading Bothmar to present the memorial which made so much noise in the kingdom The insinuations of the Whigs had made an impression on the minds of the electoral family which all the asseverations and servile professions of the Tories were not capable to remove  Hannoverpapers  The compliments of the Earl of Oxford and his associates were lost on a court who formed their opinions of the principles of the servants of the crown upon those of the party to whose influence they owed their power  An incident which happened in the course of the summer in Scotland contributed to increase the jealousy o  the presumptive heirs of the crown The majority o  the Scots being persuaded that the union of the kingdoms had been accomplished by bribery and corruption  had retained their aversion to that treaty in all its origina  force The change of the ministry the admission of se+veral  known Jacobites into office and into both houses of parliament had added the hopes of more important alterations to the ill humours of the discontented The adherents of the excluded family fondly imagined that the time was now arrived for avowing their own principles and for sounding the inclinations of government with regard to their cause  Seditious conduct of the advocates  In this disposition of the minds of the Jacobites even a trivial incident was likely to be seized with eagerness The Duchess of Gordon a Romancatholic sent a medal to Mr Robert Bennet dean of the faculty of advocates in Edinburgh This piece of silver which had been distributed in Flanders in the preceding year among the officers of the British army by one Booth a page of the Pretender had on one side the profile of a head crowned with laurel and on the reverse a kind of map of the British isles A legend surrounded the whole insinuating that the kingdom should be restored to the owner The Dean having presented the medal at a meeting of the members on the thirtieth of June they voted sixtythree against twelve that their hearty thanks should be returned to the Duchess for her very valuable present Dundas of Arniston who had distinguished himself in the debate upon that subject was appointed together with Horn of Westhall to present the thanks of the faculty The words used by Dundas upon the occasion were to the last degree seditious and bold  "We thank your Grace"  he said  "for a medal of our sovereign lord the King We flatter ourselves that your Grace will soon have an opportunity of presenting to the faculty of advocates a second medal struck upon the restoration of our lawful King and the royal family and for the finishing of rebellion the usurpation of the  own and the tyranny of whiggery  Publications of the Times  "  Suspicious lenity of government  Dundas whose principles of Jacobitism overcame his  udence carried to the press a vindication of himself  ore violent and seditious if possible than the expres  ons used in the speech which he made to the Duchess  Gordon The copy however having been carried  the provost of Edinburgh was suppressed before it  as printed The faculty of advocates perceiving that  zeal had carried them too far made a public recantation  of the error as they called it committed by some of their members The affair of the medal however made a great noise The Whigs complained vehemently of the Tories The alarm spread to the court of Hannover The Baron de Kreyenberg the Elector's resident in London laid by the express orders of his master a memorial before the Queen containing pressing instances for the prosecution of the offenders The ministry granted his request in a manner that rendered them more suspected They removed from the office of Queen's advocate Sir David Dalrymple whose principles when they opposed not his own interest were inclined to the Protestant succession under a pretence of his being remiss in the prosecution of the medalists But notwithstanding this appearance of severity against the negligence of Dalrymple his successor in office was scarce less remiss The whole affair was gradually dropt by the government of Britain But the jealousy of the court of Hannover continued  Publications of the Times passim Hannover pape    Parliament meets  The parliament which had been from time to time prorogued was suffered by the Queen to meet on the seventh of December The ministry having resolved to carry their great object the peace were willing to hav  some account of the progress of that important measure  to lay before the two houses when they should first as+semble The speech with which the Queen opened th  session was more suitable to the known design of he  servants than in itself sincere She told her parliament  that notwithstanding the arts of those that delight in wa  both place and time were appointed for opening the treat  of a general peace That her allies especially the State  had expressed their intire confidence in her conduc  That her own chief concern was to perpetuate the Pro+testant religion and the laws and liberties of the natio  by securing the succession of the crown in the house  Hannover That she was resolved to improve and en+large their interest in trade and commerce by the ad+vantages to be obtained by the peace That she wou  not only endeavour to procure all reasonable satisfactio  to her allies but unite them in the strictest engagemen  to render permanent the public tranquillity That th  best way to treat with effect about a peace was to make an early provision for carrying on the war She therefore demanded the usual supplies and concluded with earnestly recommending that unanimity which was necessary to the discussion of a business of the last importance to all Europe as well as to themselves  Journals Dec    Intrigues of the allies and Whigs  The foreign and domestic enemies of the ministry despairing to gain a majority of the commons had applied themselves to the lords Buys the Dutch ambassador had extended his intrigues with success to several members  M de Torcy tom ii  The Duke of Marlborough suffered his love of money to yield to his hatred to Oxford and his apprehensions from his measures He was said to have bribed eight of the Queen's servants in the upper house  Ibid  The ministry were no strangers to these secret intrigues and their threats increased in proportion to their anxiety and fear They talked of nothing but the beheading of the corruptor should the corruption itself be sufficiently proved France became afraid of the eagerness of the court of Great Britain left her own hopes of peace should be baffled in the concussion of the two parties The court of Versailles were at the same time no strangers to the secret views of the allies with regard to the measures of the British ministry They knew that the States notwithstanding their late acquiescence in the proposal of appointing a time and place for a congress for a treaty of peace were willing to come to extremities with a view to continue the war They were ready to use more effectual means than representations with the Queen of Great Britain They were at no pains to conceal that they intended to fit out a fleet to assist the Elector of Hannover to strike the sceptre from her hand The common conversation in Holland turned upon the design of the States to treat Queen Anne as they had treated her father and to exhibit such another scene as that in the year but probably more bloody and perhaps more decisive  Ibid Stuartpapers    The lords against the peace  The disposition of a majority of the peers was well known before the session was opened The Queen either to awe or to gain some members of the opposition  with her presence disrobing herself in an adjacent room returned to hear the debates in the house of lords The Whigs had used every measure that prudence could suggest to strengthen themselves by weakening their enemies They had the address to gain the Earl of Nottingham and some other lords equally attached to the principles of the highchurch to aid their party in opposing the projected peace When a motion was made and seconded for an address of thanks to the Queen Nottingham endeavoured in a long and laboured speech to shew the insufficiency of the terms of the late preliminaries He concluded with offering a clause to be inserted in the address that no peace could be safe or honourable should Spain and the Indies be continued to any branch of the house of Bourbon The ministry opposed with the whole weight of government a motion calculated to break all their measures But neither their arguments nor their influence could prevail Several lords in office as had been apprehended joined the opposing party The previous question on Nottingham's clause was carried by his own casting vote The adherents of the Earl of Oxford opposed the main question with still worse success The address with the addition was carried by a majority of six voices  against  and on the eleventh of December it was presented to the Queen Her answer was ambiguous and more suitable to the character of the minister than to her own She should be sorry she said that any one could suspect that she would not do her utmost to recover Spain and the Indies from the house of Bourbon  Journals of the lords    Bill of occasional conformity passed  To obtain this victory over the ministry the Whigs sacrificed in one instance their own principles The disgust of Nottingham for not having been comprehended in the changes made in the preceding year together with a late disappointment in his views on the privyseal had thrown him into opposition against the court He  however made his terms with the Whigs before he consented to espouse their cause The bill of occasiona  conformity had been always the darling object of thi  Earl Having thrice miscarried it had lain dormant  seven years The leaders of the Whigparty had agree  to concur with Nottingham in his favourite bill should it be brought in by another title to save appearances with the world The bill was accordingly passed without difficulty by the lords The known principles of the commons prevented all opposition in the lower house to a law so favourable to the church The Dissenters throughout the kingdom were alarmed They applied in vain to parliament They presented a petition to no purpose to the Earl of Oxford Though his lordship and his family had joined almost uniformly in communion with the Presbyterians he sacrificed upon the present occasion his religious professions to his political views The inconsistency of the Whigs was highly blamed by the most sincere of their own party They affirmed that to serve their own views upon power they made no scruple of deserting their principles To recommend themselves to the presumptive heirs of the crown they had repealed all the limitations laid upon the royal prerogative by the act of settlement To carry a question in the house of lords they made a sacrifice of the Dissenters whose religious and political opinions had been their own chief support with the nation  Publications of the times    The Duke of Hamilton's patent  While the Whigs departed from their principles to render themselves more capable of harrassing the ministry they found a fresh opportunity of triumphing over the courtparty The Duke of Hamilton one of the sixteen peers for Scotland having been created a Peer of Great Britain by the title of Duke of Brandon claimed his place in that quality in the house of lords His former attachment to the excluded family had rendered Hamilton obnoxious to the Whigs His desertion of the Jacobites at the Union of the two kingdoms was not calculated to recommend him to the Tories The court however were obliged to support a question which seemed to strike at the prerogative of the crown Lawyers were heard upon the patent  Journals of the lords Dec  The right of the Queen to grant honours was admitted by all None doubted that all the subjects of the united kingdoms were capable of being created peers It seemed therefore extremely hard that the nobility of Scotland should be  debarred from a privilege to which the rest of the natives of that part of the kingdom had an undoubted title But it was urged on the other side that the prerogative of the Crown could not operate against an act of parliament That the treaty of Union had made all the peers of Scotland peers of Great Britain in every respect except in voting in the house of lords or sitting in judgment on a peer That having transferred their right of voting to sixteen of their own number they had all the portion of the legislature they had a right to possess and that their being received into the house in any other way than by election was to give them the double privilege of being present at once in their own persons and in those of their representatives  Burnet vol iv    rejected by the lords  The Scotish peers had surrendered their own privileges in a manner that seemed to entitle them to no indulgence But these conclusions were neither convincing nor decisive The apprehensions expressed by some lords in the course of the debate were better founded than their arguments They said that considering the dignity and antiquity of the peers of Scotland together with the known poverty of many of that order the minister would have no difficulty of securing a majority in the house of lords by calling them to that assembly by the means of new patents Anne herself was present at a debate which seemed to abridge her prerogative Though the whole influence of the court was exerted when the matter came to a final vote the opposition carried the question  against  The Queen and the ministry were much disappointed The Scotish peers were enraged They met together and framed an address to the throne They complained of a breach of the Union and of the mark o  disgrace put upon their whole order They promised t  support the prerogative of the crown whether they shoul  continue united to England or revert to their origin  state The Queen answered them in a strain that shew+ed her displeasure at the decision of the lords She se  a message to the house complaining of the distinctio  made with regard to the peers of Scotland She demand+ed their advice in vain concerning an affair which  once touched the prerogative of the crown and the privilege of a part of her subjects  Journals    Proceedings of the commons  During these refractory proceedings of the lords the commons supported with great unanimity the measures of the crown They echoed back the Queen's speech with a very favourable address They granted without either difficulty or reserve the demanded supplies To support the ministry they extended their animadversions to their enemies Having ordered the commissioners for the public accounts to lay before them their proceedings their report was made on the twentyfirst of December  Ibid Dec  In this report was contained the deposition of Sir Solomon Medina charging the Duke of Marlborough and one Cardonnel his secretary of various peculations with regard to the contracts for bread and breadwaggons for the army in Flanders Marlborough endeavoured to defend himself in vain His passion for money was known and his pretensions to disinterestedness produced no effect on the minds of the commons The report of the commissioners was published It was followed by accusations of various kinds The press  eemed with publications and pamphlets as the Duke's  riends as well as his enemies made their appeal to the  orld The cause of the latter prevailed On the  hirtieth of December the Queen declared in council  er resolution to dismiss Marlborough from all his em  oyments An information she said having been laid  efore the commons against the Duke she thought fit to  smiss him from her service that the charge might be  ore impartially examined  Minutes of  Dec    Disgrace of the Duke of Marlborough  Notwithstanding this ostensible pretence the Duke  ed his disgrace to a more secret cause His own con  ct since his arrival from Holland was full of offence  d liable to suspicion Though extremely subject like  s friend Godolphin to political timidity he had lately  andoned his usual caution His party having calcu  ed their numbers in the house of lords had filled him  th a confidence of success before the parliament met  e address of the peers against the peace increased his  rage and inflamed his hopes He thought he acted  with security to himself as well as with advantage to his party He threw his whole weight into the scale against the ministry He caballed with Buys He courted Bothmar He herded with the discontented of all nations Neglecting that government of his passions for which he had been admired by the world he fell into all the impotencies of rage and resentment upon every partydebate  Swift's sour last years  He left to the Queen her choice of two alternatives To stop the progress of the peace to dismiss the ministry and to dissolve the parliament or to rid herself of a person who from a servant was likely to become a tyrant She determined to adopt the latter measure and she wrote to the Duke that she had no farther occasion for his service  Cause of that measure  The fears of the ministry or the designs of the Duke of Marlborough justified the dismission of the latter in other grounds The Earl of Oxford perceiving the refractory spirit of the house of lords framed suddenly an expedient for gaining a majority in that assembly On the last day of December twelve gentlemen devoted to the court were created peers The leaders of the Whigs finding that the treasurer was resolved to carry hi  measures in parliament are said to have resolved to ap+peal to the sword The Duke of Marlborough havin  his commission under the great seal the order of th  Queen was not sufficient to dissolve his power Hi  friends advised him to assemble by his authority as ge+neral all the troops in London in the different square  and to take possession of St James's and the person  the Queen Oxford apprized of this design sudden  called together the cabinetcouncil Though he prob  +bly concealed his intelligence to prevent their fears  told them of the necessity of superseding Marlboroug  under the great seal This business was soon dispatche His dismission in form was sent to the Duke T  Earl of Oxford no stranger to the character of Ma  +borough knew that he would not act against law  assembling the troops  MS Anecdote  The natural diffidence of  disposition had made him unfit for enterprises of dang  in a degree that furnished his enemies with insinuations against his personal courage  Swift's four last years p  Observations  Thus fell the Duke of Marlborough a man as singular in the disposition of his mind as he was in the extraordinary fortune of his life The high sphere in which he moved rendering him the object of envy as well as of applause he has been censured with virulence by some writers and by others extravagantly praised The secret intrigues and the history of his public transactions have furnished both sides with an ample field for declamation and there is even a peculiarity in his character that scarce admits of that happy medium which  ies between the opposite limits of detraction and admiration Though he was born with very considerable talents he was far from possessing those extensive abilities which are deemed perhaps very erroneously essential to men who acquire the first fame in war Neglected in his education when young his mind was not imbued with the least tincture of letters He could not even  ell his native language  His original let  Stuart and Hannoverpapers passim  He neither spoke with  se nor attempted at all to write in any foreign  ngue  Original  ers to Robethon Hannover papers  This unhappy defect may in a certain de  ee form an excuse for some parts of his conduct  hich might otherwise appear profligate Excluded from  ery knowledge of the virtues of former times he fell  with the vices of his own He judged perhaps of  man nature from the unprincipled manners of the  urt in which he was bred and the selfishness that has  ntributed to stain his name found an excuse in the  ofligacy of other men  on the character  There is however great reason to believe that Marl  rough improved considerably on the vicious example  several of his cotemporaries His defection from King  mes might in some measure be excused by its utility  t his design of placing that unfortunate Prince a cap  e in the hands of his rival is utterly incosistent with  common feelings of mankind  Original pa  s  With regard to  he was a benefactor a friend and even a father  He raised HIM from obscurity to independence to fortune and to honour He placed HIM in that only state that could render his desertion destructive to his own affairs If his misconduct had rendered James unworthy of the returns of gratitude due to other men why was King William also deceived  Stuartpapers passim  If no measures were to be kept with either of those Monarchs why was England betrayed to her mortal enemy  Ibid  Though these questions can scarce be answered to satisfaction they admit of alleviation In the characters of mankind some allowances must be made for their passions and frailties The attention to interest which passed through the whole conduct of Marlborough might suggest to his prudence to quit the fortunes of a man apparently destined for ruin His spirit might induce him to oppose King William as the cold reserve neglect and aversion of that Prince might offend his pride In this state of mind his Lordship could hardly separate the interest of the kingdom from that of the King and he informed the French court of the expedition against Brest more with a design of being revenged on William than with a view to serve France at the expence of England  and conduct  But if the virtues of the Duke of Marlborough were neither many nor striking he supplied the defects of his mind with the decency of his outward carriage and the dexterity of his conduct He possessed a solid understanding a degree of natural elocution an irresistible manner an address which rendered mankind pleased with themselves If not modest by nature he assumed its appearance with ease and dignity He reconciled mankind to his fame by affecting to be indifferent abou  applause and by coming upon men in general throug  their vanity they were willing to give back the prais  which he so liberally bestowed Though he was per+fectly master of his temper and able to govern or ef+fectually to disguise his passions he threw a kind o  pleasing vehemence into his conversation that gave it t  appearance of sincerity The great vice of his min  and perhaps the root of all the manifest defects of h  character was an ungovernable love of wealth T  passion deemed inconsistent with any greatness of sou  betrayed him into meannesses that raised a contempt which could scarcely be obliterated from the minds of men by the uncommon splendour of his actions in the field Though perhaps never man was more hated he owed more to favouritism than to fortune The affection of King James had first made him an object of attention to his country The supposed attachment of Queen Anne to himself and his family procured for him that influence in Europe which was the great foundation of his success  MSS passim    of the Duke of Marlborough  The malevolence that persecuted Marlborough through his actions in civil life pursued the most splendid of his operations in the field No modern general obtained greater victories yet his conduct has been much less praised than his good fortune Some affirmed that he was not fond of exposing his own person in action  Swift's four years  Others said that his apparent perturbation of spirits in the hour of battle was as little consistent with his usual carriage as it was with true courage But neither of these charges seem to be well founded An uninterrupted chain of success through a course of many years cannot justly be ascribed to chance alone and personal courage can never be denied with justice to a man who has been accused by his enemies to have delighted in war  Publication of the Times Queen's speech Dec  In his political capacity the Duke was certainly timid His misfortunes proceeded from that very defect of his character In his principles for notwithstanding what his enemies affirm he had some he was certainly a high Tory He possessed a subserviency of manner a habit inseparable from men bred in courts that suited the most extravagant pretensions of royalty To this circumstance more perhaps than to gratitude ought to be ascribed his manifest attachment to the excluded branch of the family of Stuart To a sincerity in this respect was owing in fact his continual professions to the court of St Germains They were in themselves neither an object of hope nor of fear and therefore they were little calculated to gratify either ambition or avarice He was distrusted by them perhaps more than he deserved Had he been possessed of a daring  boldness suitable to his great influence fame and power he might probably have placed the Pretender on the throne All his passions at length were either subdued or extinguished by the love of money and to that unhappy circumstance must be ascribed the ruin of his reputation Upon the whole if Marlborough is less to be admired than some other distinguished statesmen and generals it is perhaps because his secret intrigues and actions are better known  Reflections  The fate of his reputation after his fall may be considered as a kind of proof that too much was known even THEN of his private conduct The news of his dismission was received like a common occurrence No tumults no clamours excepting the complaints of the writers of some pamphlets succeeded that event The greatest subject in Europe sunk into a private station without the sound of his fall being heard His consequence with his own party vanished with his commission His own usual good temper forsook him with his good fortune He became querulous wrathful violent revengeful From directing the affairs of Europe he sunk into an inferior tool of a faction The preeminence which he possessed when in office ceased when he became a private man His wealth his former reputation his splended actions only contributed by thei  contrast to render his present condition more abject  The vulgar tho' sometimes more generous than thei  superiors instead of applauding his conduct persecute  him with insults  Stuartpapers  and he had the mortification to se  the Prince of Savoy the only rival of his military fame  received with the loudest acclamations of joy It mu  however be confessed that the arts of his enemies fo  +mented the prejudices of the vulgar The best write  had been gained to the side of the ministry Pamphl  followed pamphlet and essay was succeeded by essay  When the shafts of poignant satire fly without intermi  +sion even the most invulnerable fame must give way  Besides the Duke himself was conquered in his ow  mind Instead of that dignified coolness that was deem+ed a part of his character he was found unable to bear  reverse of fortune He discovered upon every occasio  an impatience and a resentment more apt to amuse than to terrify his political enemies  Swist's four years p Stuartpapers Hannoverpapers    He is unjustly censured for prosecuting  Though Marlborough shewed less apathy than was expected from his former character his enemies furnished him with sufficient reasons for his resentment The accusation which chiefly ruined his credit with the nation now appears to have been malicious and unjust He was said to have sacrificed the war in Spain to his own operations in Flanders to gratify his ambition and to glut his inordinate avarice His enemies in parliament alluding to the strength of the French barrier made use of a vulgar phrase which made a great impression on a people who were heartily tired of the war They said that to endeavour to subdue France by attacking her strong towns on the side of Flanders was taking the bull by the horns That instead of expelling Philip the Fifth from Spain the troops and treasure of the confederates were thrown away on unimportant sieges and attacks upon almost impregnable lines That the Prince of Savoy himself as he profited like Marlborough by hostilities in Flanders had contrived to unite with him in influencing through the pensionary Heinsius the councils of the States and that all the three meant nothing by the undecisive campaigns in Flanders but to protract their own power which was likely to terminate with the war  the war in Flanders  There is nothing however more certain than that to push France on the side of Flanders was the infallible way of depriving the house of Bourbon of the crown of Spain The war in the latter kingdom had been carried on always with a degree of spirit and often with great success But at the end of ten years Philip the Fifth was more firmly established on the throne than at the beginning of the contest The distance of the consederates from the place of action the necessity of conveying every thing by sea the sterility of the country itself the indolence of the inhabitants which deprived their enemies as well as themselves of the necessaries of war the religious prejudices of the native Spaniards against a Prince supported by troops whom they called Heretics had all combined to confirm the  knowing and judicious in the opinion that Spain was no  to be conquered within its own limits On the othe  hand though the strong barrier of France in Flanders must necessarily have cost to the confederates muc  time a great deal of treasure and a multitude of lives  the work was at length almost finished Another cam+paign would probably have enabled the allies had they continued united to penetrate into France and even t  advance to Paris The fate of the French monarch  itself must have depended perhaps on the issue of a sin+gle battle Lewis the Fourteenth to save his crown  would have been obliged to pull his grandson in a man+ner with his own hands from the throne of Spain Th  French King was no stranger to this circumstance n  more than the Duke of Marlborough  M de Torcy tom ii  If ther  +fore the object of the

Utrecht  Aukward situation and views of the Earl of Oxford  THOUGH the Earl of Oxford acquired the reputation of spirit from the dismission of the Duke of Marlborough that measure ought rather to be ascribed to his fears He was in the same awkward predicament  with his predecessor in office Both were forced to adopt a line of conduct diametrically opposite to their principles and views The Earl of Godolphin though a Tory and Jacobite was obliged from the circumstances of the times to place himself at the head of the Whigs The present treasurer though a Presbyterian and attached to the house of Hannover was considered as the leader of the Tories and a favourer of the claims of the Pretender The bulk of mankind ever deceived by outward shew judged of the two ministers by their own passions and prejudices Godolphin when in correspondence with the court of St Germains was violently praised by many and as extravagantly condemned by others for his attachment to the Protestant succession Oxford was still more unfortunate than his rival He was supposed by the court of Hannover itself as well as by the people a determined friend to the excluded family even when he used all his efforts against their eventual restoration and laid himself in the dust at the feet of the parliamentary heirs of the crown his professions were considered as so many baits to deceive But in a happy enthusiasm for his own religious opinions or perhaps ultimately to gain the favour of that family most likely to succeed he seemed determined to exclude all resentment and to shew that he was a much more sincere friend than his adversaries to the succession of the Electoral family  He discovers by an accident  In this disposition of mind the Earl of Oxford was as much afraid of the Tories as he was of the principal Whigs His great desire when he assumed the administration of affairs was to retain the most moderate of the lowchurch party in office The violence of his friends as well as the rage of his enemies put an end for a time to this trimming scheme To balance in some degree the vehemence of the highchurch party he wished to keep Marlborough at the head of the army  Stuartpapers Feb  An incident however defeated all his present schemes while it proved fortunate for his future conduct Though he had entered with such an appearance of firmness and zeal into the scheme of making peace with France his courage failed him when the Whigs began their clamours against the preliminaries He therefore endeavoured by  large promises to gain the Emperor to his measures through his ambassador at London That minister however construing Oxford's advances to his inability of supporting himself advised his master to reject his proposals and to adhere to the Whigs He affirmed that there was no reason to apprehend the Tories durst conclude a separate peace with France or offend the populace by giving jealousy to the confederates He proposed at the same time that to amuse the people of Great Britain large promises should be made by the Emperor for continuing with redoubled vigour the war This measure he said would either persuade or terrify the British ministry to put an end to the negotiations of peace assuring his master that ways and means could be afterwards found for evading his engagements with credit  Stuartpapers Roger's dream M de Torcy tom ii    the designs of the confederates  One Plunket an Irish Jesuit bred at Vienna refided then at London This person was on a footing of the greatest intimacy with the secretary of the Imperial ambassador He had the address to procure from his friend copies of most of the ambassador's dispatches to the Statesgeneral and the court of Vienna Being known to one Netterville and to Pen the noted Quaker he informed the Earl of Oxford by their means of the discoveries he had made He placed the papers to the number of twentyfour in his hands Among other matters of importance they contained the resolution of the Duke of Savoy to adhere to the pacific measures of Queen Anne together with a letter from the King of Portugal to the Emperor importing that he was resolved to put an end on his part to the war They contained also a scheme for dethroning the Queen and another in case that should sail for continuing the war for two years These papers being laid by the treasurer before her Majesty made such an impression that she instantly resolved to conclude a separate peace with France  Ibid    and Whigs  The Earl of Oxford apprized opportunely of these intrigues paid no attention to the complaints and representations of the Count de Galas Plunket finding that minister dejected on account of his being slighted by the  Queen's ministers endeavoured to gain him over to the interests of the Pretender But the Whigs having formed many visionary projects for disappointing the peace the Count resolved to adhere to their party Plunket having failed in gaining his favour resolved to alarm his fears He told him that a design was on foot for marrying the Pretender's sister to Charles the Twelfth of Sweden That Charles from a prospect of the succession to the British crown in the right of his intended spouse would assist the Pretender with a Protestant army That there would be no difficulty in transporting troops from Sweden to Scotland and that a Prince of Charles's high military reputation and genius would find little difficulty in establishing his brotherinlaw in a kingdom where he had so many and so zealous friends The ambassador carried this intelligence to the Whigs They were alarmed beyond measure They sent to the court of Hannover for an agent capable of supporting in concern with themselves the interests of the Electoral family The Baron de Bothmar arrived accordingly in London in the month of November in company with the Duke of Marlborough and the memorial presented in the name of the Elector against the peace was the result of conferences between the ministers of that Prince and the leaders of the Whigparty  Stuartpapers MSS passim  penes    Oxford's prudence  Had not the attachment of the Earl of Oxford to the Electoral family interfered this measure might have proved fatal to the succession according to the act of settlement The whole body of the Tories the house of commons and above all the Queen herself were to the last degree offended The Dukes of Buckingham and Shrewsbury together with the majority of the cabinetcouncil proposed to send Bothmar in the custody o  a messenger out of the kingdom  Stuartpapers  The Earl of Oxford perceiving the danger of this resolution opposed i  with address and effect He represented that the peac  was not sufficiently advanced to trust the terms to th  court of France That the mob alarmed by their ha+bitual fears of popery would become clamorous and joi  the Whigs That the Jacobites would turn insolent and that in short the whole kingdom would become a scene of anarchy and confusion The Whigs perceiving that Bothmar's memorial produced no effect flew with the usual vehemence of party into another scheme They sent to the Prince of Savoy to come immediately to London The object of his journey was to lay before the Queen and the parliament the necessity of continuing the war He was also to provide himself with proofs that France had bought peace from the British court for money Upon this accusation the Whigs having a majority in the house of lords were to send two or three of the cabinetcouncil to the Tower Plunket having received intelligence of these schemes from his friend the Emperor's agent then at the Hague conveyed the whole to the Earl of Oxford  Stuartpapers    Whigs send for Prince Eugene His character  Though the intelligence furnished by Plunket was the principal reason for the resolute measures of the Earl of Oxford he owed the preservation of his power and perhaps ultimately his life to the happy but unaccountable delay of Prince Eugene Though a caution which his enemies called political timidity might present the Duke of Marlborough from adopting violent measures there was no security against the schemes of the Prince A man of great abilities unconfined by principle sanguine in his views as determined in the execution of his designs as he was bold in undertaking the most desperate measures He kept one great object his own ambition perpetually in view He pushed forward in one direct line to that distinguished point He regarded obstacles only as to their difficulty of being removed He valued little the means he used as he was taught by his pride that every thing calculated to extend his own greatness was allowable if not just In this disposition of Eugene's mind the only safety of the ministry consisted in his absence from London But the slow counsels of the house of Austria proved according to custom highly favourable to their enemies The Prince was detained at the Hague till the season of his being useful in London was past The Earl of Oxford apprized of the designs of his enemy had time to fortify  himself against his attacks and thus by the incontinence of a secretary and the address of an obscure Jesuit much mischief was prevented and Europe ultimately restored to tranquillity  A majority made in the house of lords  The Earl of Oxford long perplexed with difficulties became at length resolute through his very fears He dismissed the Duke of Marlborough from all his employments But this measure was not sufficient to secure him against the designs of the Whigs Though the house of commons were subservient to his wishes there was also a necessity of gaining a majority to the measures of the court in the house of lords The excluded party had acquired courage as well as reputation under the approbation of one branch of the legislature To deprive them of that advantage was to pursue with effect the victory already gained by the ministry by the removal of the Duke A sudden resolution was taken to command the deliberations of the house of lords by the creation of twelve new peers The measure was deemed arbitrary and dangerous but it could not be called illegal It served only to shew the party that an opposition is formed in vain against the crown in an assembly whose number of members depends on the will of the Prince The lords having met on the second of January the new peers were introduced They had scarce taken their seats when they were called upon service A motion was made to adjourn the house to the fourteenth of the month the day to which the commons had adjourned Upon a division the majority for the court appeared to be thirteen  against  The violence of the party increased with this reverse of fortune Though the means used to defeat their efforts in the house of lords were obvious and might have been foreseen they had derived hopes that the pre+rogative could not be exerted from the timid characte  of the Queen  Stuartpapers    Prince Eugene in London  Three days after the untoward discovery made by  Whigs of their own weakness the Prince of Savoy s  long and so eagerly expected by the party arrived i  London The ministry knowing his designs resolve  to watch his motions The Earl of Oxford sent o  Drummond a dependant of his own to meet him in th  river St John dispatched upon the same service a Mr Brinsden an oculist an agent in whom he could confide The Prince obtained an audience of the Queen but he was coldly though politely received She referred him for business to Oxford and St John the only persons present at their interview The Whigs were much elevated at the arrival of his Highness in a conjuncture so critical to their affairs Even such Tories as carried their principles to the height of Jacobitism were not displeased They were no strangers to the principles or rather the views of the Earl of Oxford in favour of the family of Hannover They knew that to defeat the peace was to ruin the minister Nothing but the fear of falling into the hands of the Whigs had induced them to support the court Had the leaders of the latter party followed a more moderate line of conduct the Earl of Oxford must have fallen by the hands of his supposed friends In the preceding autumn the adherents of the excluded family had discovered that they could form no hopes to their cause on the favour of the lordtreasurer Neither the Queen nor her favourite now Lady Masham were ignorant of this circumstance but both dreaded what they called the tyranny of the Whigs should the lordtreasurer by the desertion of the Tories be forced to resign  His projects  The Prince of Savoy had formed no doubt of being able to defeat the treaty of peace by embarrassing the British ministry with splendid offers of advantage for continuing the war He had resolved to propose in the name of the Emperor to leave Great Britain in absolute possession of the commerce of Spain and America to induce the King of Denmark and the Czar of Muscovy to join in the grand confederacy to make up the Imperial forces in Spain to thirty thousand men to pay one million of crowns out of four to be expended in the military operations on that side Should either house of parliament accept these terms in opposition to the ministry the Elector of Hannover was to have passed into Great Britain with an army  De Torcy tom ii Stuartpapers MSS  penes me  A revolution to be made in  favour of that Prince would enable him to carry on the war to the last extremity against the house of Bourbon But when Prince Eugene perceived that the commons were firm in their support of the ministry that a majority had been secured in the house of lords that the Duke of Marlborough was disgraced and rendered incapable to second his views that the Whigs though obstinate in their opposition were divided in their councils that men of influence and property were inclined to a peace that the mob of London were only clamorous for war he resolved to spare no sort of violence to accomplish his views  Schemes of Marlborough  In forming his measures the Prince of Savoy resolved to consult chiefly the Duke of Marlborough and the Baron de Bothmar the Hannoverian envoy extraordinary at the court of London The Duke at their first interview chided the Prince for the unfortunate delay in his journey His arrival he said might have been of great advantage to the party about a month before He ascribed his dilatoriness to that Austrian gravity which had been often fatal to the affairs of the Imperial family He told him that at the opening of the session their friends had a majority in the house of lords That they could have sent two or three of the opposite party to the Tower without any difficulty That their vacant places might be supplied with men willing to continue the war That now the whole state of affairs was changed that twelve new peers had been created that the Scotish peers were arrived that they must have recourse to violence or drop altogether their design that three or four persons together with the lordtreasurer who possessed the confidence of a silly woman  Hannoverpapers  and governed her at pleasure must be removed That the Prince must in the mean time behave himself with great moderation and discretion That he should endeavour to gain the good opinion of the minister and induce the commons to grant ample supplies and that the whole party should watch such accidents as might arise in the progress of time  M de Torcy tom ii Stuartpapers    and of the Baron de Bothmar  The Duke descended from these particular facts to reflections more general He affirmed that the state of the kingdom at present resembled its situation at the late Revolution that the disorders were similar and demanded the same remedies that should a Prince of the Electoral family appear in Great Britain under the cover of a manifesto setting forth that the Pretender was coming with a Popish army the mob might be deceived and Queen Anne like her father would steal away to France That then the crown might be settled by the Whigs and the war be carried on with redoubled vigour These observations devolved the discourse on the Baron de Bothmar He averred that though the disorders might be the same the same remedies were impracticable that the nation was not sufficiently prepared for a revolution that the prejudices of the vulgar the great engine in such daring enterprises were still upon the side of the enemy that though the Queen was suspected of favouring a Popish successor she herself was a strict Protestant that the jealousy concerning religion was too feeble on account of the distance of the danger that though circumstances had even been more favourable the experiment would be extremely dangerous that a miscarriage would inevitably ruin the undertaking load the family of Hannover with the public hatred and exclude them from the succession to the crown The Duke of Marlborough suffered himself to be argued out of his observations by the eloquence of the Baron de Bothmar But he is said to have proposed another project more safe and equally effectual He suggested that bands of ruffians should be sent through the streets by night to insult the inhabitants to raise disturbances and to excite mobs That should people become accustomed to these nocturnal alarms there would be no difficulty in assassinating such persons as the party might wish to remove and to throw the whole blame on a licentious band  Mem de Torcy tom ii Stuartpapers    Prince Eugene's violent proposal  Though Prince Eugene rejected this project his own was not distinguished with more humanity He proposed to set fire to London in different places in the night particularly to the palace of St James's where the Queen resided He shewed that the proper time for  the execution of this design was when the guards on duty were commanded by an officer whom the party could trust That in the midst of the confusion the Duke of Marlborough should appear at the head of a party in arms That he should first possess himself of the Tower the Bank the Exchequer That then he should seize the person of the Queen force her to dissolve the parliament to call a new representative to make a free inquiry into the clandestine correspondence with France to punish the guilty with death  Mem de Torcy tom ii MSS passim  The Lords Somers Cowper and Halifax were consulted upon this scheme They refused at first to declare their own opinion but they at last absolutely rejected the violent proposal of the Prince They signified their inclination to proceed in the legal and ordinary way They advised Bothmar to present a second memorial in the name of his master more clear more positive and more comprehensive than the former But though Bothmar agreed to all the schemes in which the Whigs were only concerned he shrunk back when it became his own part to act He told them that by presenting such a memorial without the express orders of the Elector he should risk his head That therefore he was resolved to extend his aid no farther than to compose a writing containing the strongest expressions against the peace and that this anonymous paper should be printed in Holland and published and dispersed in London  Ibi    His further schemes disappointed  Disappointed in his views by the caution of the Whigs and the timidity of Bothmar the Prince of Savoy laid before his party another plan He proposed that the Elector of Hannover should be appointed commander in chief of the troops in Flanders and governorgeneral in the Netherlands that to strengthen the Whigs the Electoral Prince should pass into England to awe the ministry by appearing at the head of their enemies Marlborough and Godolphin opposed this measure wit  great vehemence They affirmed that the Tories t  a man were enemies to the Electoral family tha  should the Prince of Hannover come over whilst they ar  in possession of the government the abrogation of the act of settlement would be the necessary consequence an  that a civil war might arise perhaps as fatal to the nation as that between the houses of York and Lancaster But the Duke of Marlborough was urged by stronger motives than the miseries to be entailed on his country The credit of his enemies daily increased His own declined He had already felt a change of fortune He was afraid of further vicissitudes The Emperor had provided him with an estate in Germany out of the spoils of the Elector of Bavaria He had dignified him with the title of Prince But though this settlement had secured a quiet retreat it' was not sufficient to satisfy his ambition He had turned his eyes to the command of the Imperial troops in Flanders with the title of VicarGeneral of that country He therefore could not approve of a project that placed the Elector in a station which he wished to obtain for himself  Mem de Torcy tom ii MSS passim    Disgusted with the conduct of the Whigs  The Prince enraged at the difficulties raised against all his projects declared that he perceived the Whigs were no more friends to the house of Hannover than the Tories That they were enemies to all regal government and biassed in favour of a republic  Ibid  papers  but that if he judged aright they were as unfit for establishing that form of government as they were incapable of supporting it with patriotism and unanimity That their proposal to enable the Emperor to carry on the war by a loan on the revenue of his hereditary dominions was either captious or visionary That their schemes throughout were either speculative or impracticable that the ideal fabric raised by one was sure of being overturned by the objections of another that they seemed to him like those vain men who were reported of old to employ themselves in building the tower of Babel That there were not three among them that agreed either in sentiment or in  nguage that sometimes they would have the Prince of Hannover that at other times they were averse from  sovereigns whether by succession or election to the  hrone That he perceived the greatest number longed  ore for power and emolument than for any change of  easures That without any attachment either to the  milies of princes or forms of government they wished  to manage the nation by a factious aristocracy That for his own part he was only vexed that they obliged the Emperor to make demands from which he should be forced to desist  Letter from Prince Eugene Feb Stuartpapers    Consternation of the Queen and ministry  The ministry were minutely informed concerning the particulars discussed in these consults  Stuartpapers MSS M de Torcy tom ii  They were sufficiently acquainted with their dangerous tendency On the anniversary of the Queen's birth  Feb  they took every precaution for the security of her person The guards were doubled The gates of St James's were shut Several parties of horse were stationed in the neighbourhood Some troops were appointed to attend Prince Eugene under a shew of defending him against the pressure of the mob but in reality to watch his motions They were informed that under the pretence of a tumult among the populace some persons employed by the Prince and his party were to force their way to the Earl of Oxford and to assassinate him together with Mr St John and the lordkeeper Sir Simon Harcourt The Queen was terrified beyond measure Oxford to protect himself and to encourage his mistress occupied apartments in the palace The lordkeeper and the secretary took care not to venture abroad after it was dark But amidst this alarm the minister and his threatened associates conducted themselves with commendable prudence in concealing their apprehensions of danger Had they carried the intelligence they had received to the council at large or above all had it been laid before the parliament the nation might have been kindled into a degree of frenzy against the projectors of such dangerous schemes The imprudence of the Baron de Bothmar in being privy to these consults might have even endangered the succession in the Protestant line Men would scarce take time to distinguish the assiduous folly of the servant from a settled design in the master to obtain the throne by unjustifiable means  The Jacobites wish to lay the whole before parliament  The Dukes of Buckingham and Shrewsberry in their attachment to the excluded branch of the Stuarts were very unwilling to suffer a discovery so favourable to their  principles to pass without being laid before the parliament Though the proofs furnished by Plunket and others were sufficient to convince mankind of the reality of a conspiracy they were not deemed complete in the eye of the law Oxford endeavoured to conceal even from the cabinetcouncil the informations he had received against the Prince of Savoy He subjected them however to the inspection of the Queen Plunket thinking that Eugene should be committed to prison had sent a detail of the whole by the hands of the Earl of Yarmouth to the Duke of Buckingham and to Harcourt the lordkeeper They laid it instantly before the rest of the cabinet The Earl of Oxford was alarmed He knew their principles and he was afraid of their violence He entreated them to make no motion in the business They affirmed that the thing concerned them too nearly to be dropt without examination They ordered Plunket to appear but Oxford carried him first to Queen Anne The Duke of Buckingham brought him before the cabinet He was examined with strictness They promised to provide for him during life for his services They ordered him to repair to Holland to induce by promises the friend from whom he had received the Prince of Savoy's papers to come to London to lay the whole proceedings of the confederates and Whigs before the parliament and the nation  Stuartpapers MS passim    They are prevented by Oxford  The Earl of Oxford opposed this measure with various arguments He said that to employ a Roman Catholic upon that service would furnish the Whigs with a popular ground for clamour That the scrutiny into their conduct would offend the Allies in a degree that might prove extremely dangerous That a court that would expose such secrets to parliament could never afterwards be trusted That the differences which must ensue between the confederates and the court of London would enable France to prescribe her own terms and that Great Britain from being the umpire of the affairs of Europe would sink into contempt These solid reasons were however rejected The principles of Buckingham overcame the art of Oxford Plunket was sent to Holland He prevailed with his friend to consent to come to England upon  the promise of a provision for life but he insisted to have that promise under the hand of the secretary of state Though the affair belonged properly to the secretary's office the Earl of Oxford took the whole into his own department Plunket informed him of the German agent's demands but he kept the letter from the inspection of the cabinetcouncil He in the mean time amused Plunket and contrived to employ him in Holland as the only means to prevent the cabinetcouncil from making public this disagreeable and dangerous affair  Stuartpapers MS passim    His artful and cautious conduct  The Earl of Oxford through the whole of this trying scene behaved like a man whose passions lay subdued by his principles Though he was no stranger to the designs of his enemies against his mistress though he was informed of their schemes against his own person though those who supported his measures upbraided him for his conduct he proceeded considering his situation with great moderation and circumspection The violence of the Whigs more than the vehemence of the Tories had forced him into the measures of which the first of those parties so much complained He was unwilling to disgrace Marlborough He was equally averse from persecuting that nobleman in parliament When the commons swayed by Toryprinciples animadverted upon the Duke and his adherents the Earl of Oxford had proofs in hands against them that would infallibly ruin their reputation with the people and might even endanger their lives Though insulted stigmatized and persecuted by the Baron de Bothmar though liable to the violence of that imprudent resident and subject to his secret and dangerous conspiracies though distrusted by the Princess Sophia suspected by the Elector and hated by the whole Electoral family he seemed to place himself above resentment and to encourage hopes that his conduct woul  ultimately contradict the misrepresentations of his enemie  and gain the confidence and even the gratitude of the pre+sumptive heirs of the crown To accomplish a purpo  laudable in itself he made afterwards use of a deceptio  less consistent with honour than with true or perhaps ne+cessary policy  MSS passim Stuartpapers Hannoverpapers    Proceedings of the commons  During these secret intrigues dangerous conspiracies and clandestine designs the parliament proceeded along the obvious line of public business The two houses having met on the fourteenth of January were required by a message from the Queen to adjourn themselves further to the seventeenth of the month Her Majesty ordered the secretary of state to acquaint the commons that her plenipotentiaries had arrived at Utrecht and had already opened the conferences for the speedy reestablishment of the public tranquillity That to secure the conclusion of peace by appearing provided for war all preparations were made for opening an early campaign She therefore requested the house to give the necessary dispatch to the supplies She concluded with complaining of the licentiousness of the press which was become too great to be restrained by the laws in force and she recommended to the house to find a remedy equal to the mischief The answer of the commons was suitable to their principles and their usual obsequiousness to the views of the Queen They thanked her for her promise to communieate to them the terms of the peace They reflected on such persons as had spread groundless and malicious reports against her councils They promised dispatch in the supplies They assured her that they would take the most effectual course to stop the licentiousness of false and scandalous libels  Journals Jan    Animadversions on the Whigs Walpole expelled  To these assurances to the Queen the commons added animadversions on those who opposed the measures of the crown Having taken under consideration the report of the commissioners of public accounts they found that Mr Robert Walpole had been guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption Upon the oath of one of his agents it appeared that Walpole had received five hundred guineas and a note for five hundred more for two contracts made by him when secretary at war for supplying the troops in North Britain with forage Though the shameful venality of this man deserved punishment his connexion with the former ministry was more the object of resentment than his offence He was expelled from his seat in the house and committed to the Tower  Ibid  The commons passed from the affair of  Robert Walpole to a censure on the Duke of Marlborough Upon examining the charge against that nobleman for having taken money of the contractors for bread and breadwaggons and for deducting for his own use two and one half per cent from the pay of the foreign troops in Flanders in the pay of Great Britain they came to a resolution that the Duke in receiving those sums had been guilty of unwarrantable and illegal practices Their vote was laid by the whole house before her Majesty The attorneygeneral was directed to prosecute the duke But either no prosecution was ever commenced or it was carried on with a languor that defeated its design To throw disgrace on Marlborough was more the object of the minister than the refunding of the public money To accomplish the first the commons extended their animadversions to his family and servants Adam Cardonnel his secretary was soon after expelled the house for practices similar to those of his lord  Feb    The barrier treaty examined  During these animadversions on the former ministry the conduct of the commons was calculated to facilitate the present measures of the crown  Jan  The Viscount Townshend whom Marlborough had associated with himself in the negociations for peace in had concluded a treaty with the States of the United Provinces with regard to a barrier in Flanders for the Dutch at the end of the war In concluding this treaty Townshend in a compliance with the views of his party had exceeded his instructions Lisle Tournay Menin Douay and several places on the Lys and the Scheld were guaranteed to the States The most of those cities were in themselves an essential barrier to France It could not therefore be supposed that she would yield for the portion of her enemies what was necessary for her own security An obstruction to the peace which might ultimately defeat the design of the congress threatened to rise from this circumstance Besides the engagement of the States in return for the barrier were now deeme  inconsistent with the safety of the Queen of Great Britai  and her friends  M de Torcy tom  They undertook to guarantee th  the Protestant succession to aid with their ships and ar+mies the presumptive heirs of the crown whenever th  succession should appear to be in danger The ministry were not ignorant that the Whigs and perhaps the States themselves pretended that this perilous period was already arrived  Stuartpapers Debates in parliament    and its authors censured  The barrier treaty and the instructions upon which it had been concluded by Townshend with all the letters that had passed upon the subject were successively laid before the commons The Baron de Bothmar with his usual imprudence made his master a party in favour of the treaty He wrote in vehement terms to Mr Secretary St John  Printed    He threatened several members of the lower house with the resentment and vengeance of the Elector should they proceed to censure the persons concerned Though this conduct could scarce be supposed to proceed from instructions from Hannover the enemies of that court improved the circumstance to favour their own views The more credulous part of the commons were induced to believe the suggestions of an intended invasion and the reports of a designed revolution The most spirited were offended at this unseasonable interference with the resolutions of a body who had a right to be independent of every external power When therefore the affair of the barrier came to the vote the commons resolved that several articles of the treaty were destructive to the trade and interest of Great Britain That the Lord Townshend had neither orders nor authority to conclude these pernicious articles That therefore he who negociated and signed the treaty was an enemy to the Queen and kingdom The States interfered in vain in a letter to the Queen herself  Ibid  The ministry having resolved on a peace were determined to remove every obstacle that stood in the way  Inquiry into the conduct of the allies  In prosecution of this design the commons were encouraged to examine the conduct of the allies with regard to their furnishing their respective quotas for the war This inquiry opened a scene which contributed to increase the great desire of the people for peace It appeared that not one of the confederates except Great Britain had fulfilled any one of their engagements That  the Emperor in particular who had most to gain by the was contributed the least towards its expence That the States of the United Provinces had not come up in any article to the terms of their treaties That the King of Portugal and the Duke of Savoy made a lucrative trade of the war by extracting from their friends the advantages which they ought to conquer from their enemies The Commons came to various resolutions on this important subject The Princes and States who composed the confederacy were treated with great freedom in the debates The complaints of their respective ministers were joined by the clamours of the excluded party They affirmed that the Emperor who was the acknowledged head of the alliance was attacked with unbecoming disrespect That the Duke of Savoy to whose spirit and activity the allies owed the conquest of Italy was unworthily treated That the States the faithful allies and even the benefactors of the British nation were insulted and all this to facilitate a dishonourable treaty to please a faithless enemy who presumed to dictate the terms of peace after having been almost totally subdued in the war  H  st d'Angleterre Hist of Europe Debate    The Whigs carry an address in the house of lords  While the ministry carried forward with safety their measures under the protection of the commons an unexpected incident gave to their enemies a transitory superiority in the house of lords The Queen in a message of the seventeenth of January had recommended the reconsideration of the Duke of Hamilton's patent The peers having adjourned the business from day to day seemed at length by dropping their debates without coming to a decision to adhere to their former resolution The lords who represented the peerage of Scotland resolved to sit no more in an assembly that refused to acknowledge what they deemed their undoubted right The Whigs improved this secession to their own advantage The specific offers received at Utrecht by the plenipotentiaries of France on the first of February having found thei  way into the Dutch newspapers were laid before th  peers by the lord Halifax on the fifteenth of that month  He moved that an address should be presented to th  Queen signifying the indignation of the house against the terms offered by the French King and promising to stand by and assist her Majesty with their lives and fortunes in prosecuting the war with the utmost vigour The motion was carried by a considerable majority But this good fortune of the Whigs was not destined to last long The Scotish peers were induced to resume their seats and their weight turned again the balance in favour of the ministry  Publications Annals of Queen Anne    Prince Eugene disappointed departs  The address of the lords obtained surreptitiously by the Whigs was the last parliamentary effort of the party against the conclusion of the peace The Prince of Savoy whose negociations with the ministry had languished into formal memorials and official answers relinquished all hopes of the object of his voyage to London To preserve appearances Mr Secretary St John was commanded to lay before the house of commons a proposition made by the Prince in the name of his Imperial Majesty for the support of the war in Spain The message represented that the Emperor judged forty thousand men would be sufficient for that service That his Imperial Majesty offered to make up his troops in that kingdom to thirty thousand men and to take upon himself one fourth part of the expences of the Spanish war  Journals Feb  To the great mortification of the Prince not the least notice was taken by the house of his proposal The message lay disregarded on the table He himself made preparations for returning to the Continent But he remained some weeks after this event in London The Queen informed of his secret intrigues with the Whigs gave way to all the terrors incident to her sex She Considered herself in the utmost danger as long as the Prince remained in England Repeated messages were sent that the yacht ordered to transport him to Holland was ready to sail She at length became so uneasy that she is said to have resolved to send away by force a person so dangerous to her repose  Stuartpapers  But the Prince prevented this disgrace by embarking at Greenwich on the seventeenth of March  Public melligence    Congress opened at Utrecht  During these transactions in the British parliament the conferences for restoring peace to Europe were opened at Utrecht The plenipotentiaries of Great Britain and France together with those of the States met in form for the first time on the eighteenth of January Though the Earl of Strafford and the Bishop of Bristol had received orders to hasten the great work of peace they were not sufficiently instructed with regard to the article of Spain which must necessarily form the foundation of the treaty This secret was reserved by the ministry for Mr Prior who was expected in quality of third plenipotentiary from Great Britain The British plenipotentiaries confined in their powers conversed still with those of France in the stile of enemies They declared that the articles signed by Menager ought rather to be considered as propositions than preliminaries That they were neither binding on the Queen nor considered in the least as binding on the allies This declaration composed in some degree the spirits of the confederates The Emperor himself consented to send plenipotentiaries to Utrecht The peace depended not on that Prince though the war had been undertaken in his cause The confederates as well as the French perceived that the fate of the treaty was involved in the resolutions of the Queen of Great Britain But an unexpected incident threw to an uncertain distance the tranquillity that was suddenly expected by all the belligerent powers  Death of the Princes of France  In the month of April of the preceding year the Dauphin of France the only son of Lewis the Fourteenth died at the age of fifty He was a Prince of a limited capacity fond of tranquillity and averse from business as he was unequal to its toils He was succeeded in the title of heir of France by his son the Duke o  Burgundy a man of more fire greater vivacity an  better abilities than his father But he also died on th  eighteenth of February having survived only six day  his wife the Dauphiness Mary Adilaide of Savoy Thes  events so satal to the royal family of France were fol+lowed in a few days more by the death of the Duke o  Britany the last Dauphin's eldest son They were a  buried together in the same grave This uncommon mor+tality was ascribed by the vulgar to the ambition and in+trigues of the Duke of Orleans This perhaps was b  an idle report But the profligate pleasures of that Prince had induced mankind to form the worst opinion of his morals Out of three sons born to the Duke of Burgundy the Duke of Anjou a sickly infant only remained The misfortunes of France raised the courage of such of the confederates as were eager for continuing the war The Emperor rose in his hopes and increased his demands The States grew more obdurate The British ambassadors became more cool in their zeal The ministry either did not chuse or durst not send Prior as third plenipotentiary to Utrecht They concurred with the rest of the confederates in demanding new precautions for the stability of the peace and for preventing the crowns of France and Spain from being joined on the head of the same Prince  Mem de Torcy tom ii Swift's four years    Alternatives offered by Great Britain  Notwithstanding these demands on the part of Great Britain the ministry made no secret of their resolution to conclude a peace The lordtreasurer dispatched a Mr Harley a relation of his own to Utrecht He directed the Abbé Gaultier who still resided in London to propose different alternatives out of which the French King might form a proposal that ought to satisfy the allies of Great Britain Harley was charged with the like commission The plenipotentiaries stopt the progress of the conferences They said that he had brought such orders as would break off all negociation unless the court of France should agree to one of the alternatives offered by the Abbé Gaultier in the name of the Queen of Great Britain The memorial of Gaultier represented the just alarm of Europe should the person who was actually King of Spain ever ascend to the throne of France He shewed that this danger was far from being chimerical as this Prince was so near the succession of the latter kingdom That the only way to prevent the danger apprehended by the confederates was for Philip the Fifth to transfer his right to the Duke of Berry That without this expedient neither the British nation nor their allies would ever consent to a peace which would be in that case not only unsafe but impracticable  Ibid    Arguments of the French King May  The French King was embarrassed by an incident which he had actually foreseen He endeavoured to elude the demands of the court of Great Britain To accomplish his purpose he advanced all the trite arguments used by casuists in defence of the hereditary descent of the crown In a letter to the British ministry he affirmed that the King though supreme lord of his dominions has not the power of altering their fundamental laws That the prince next to the crown was the necessary heir That his right is an inheritance which he receives neither from his predecessors nor the people but from the law That when one King dies another succeeds without asking the approbation or requiring the consent of any person That he succeeds not as heir but as master of the kingdom the sovereignty of which belongs to him not by choice but by birthright That he is obliged for his crown to no will of a prior king to no edict to no liberality in another person but to the law That this law is esteemed the work of HIM who establishes monarchies That God alone can break this first link in the chain which binds together the community That this law can neither be invalidated by agreement nor rendered void by renunciation That should the King of Spain renounce his right for the sake of peace that act would only deceive himself and disappoint the allies  De Torcy tom ii    Concerning hereditary right  Mr Secretary St John corresponded with the court of Versailles upon this subject He returned an answer less complicated and more decisive He admitted that the French nation might hold that God alone can abolish the law of succession But that in Britain most men were of another mind That the most scrupulous on this delicate subject believed that a prince might forego his right by a voluntary resignation That the person in whose favour the renunciation was made might be justly supported by the princes who should happen to be guarantees of the treaty That in short the Queen of Great Britain would put an end to all negotiation unless the French should accept of the expedient proposed That it was neither her design nor inclination to deprive Philip either of the title or power of King That she  wished upon his resignation of the crown of Spain to preserve his right to that of France and to place him on another throne That Naples the territories of Savoy the duchies of Montferrat and Mantua should be erected for him into a kingdom That Spain and the Indies should be conferred on the Duke of Savoy in place of his own dominions and that upon the event of Philip's accession to the throne of France the island of Sicily should be given to the house of Austria  De Torcy tom ii    June King of Spain renounces his title to the French crown  Though the French King amused St John with arguments in favour of hereditary right he wrote to his grandson to desire him to accede to the proposals of Great Britain That Prince after a delay suitable to the gravity of Spanish councils resolved to renounce his precarious prospect of the crown of France for the certain possession of the throne of Spain The Queen of Great Britain impatient for various reasons for peace ordered the Earl of Strafford to return to London The avowed object of his journey was to receive his ultimate instructions to conclude the treaty as soon as the King of Spain's answer should be received When his answer was accordingly received in the beginning of June the Queen agreed to a suspension of arms The conditions of this indulgence to France was the immediate delivery of Dunkirk to the British troops and the punctual execution of the article concerning the union of France and Spain She proposed at the same time that a Dutch garrison should be introduced into Cambray The French King deriving spirit from her eagerness rejected this demand with a degree of disdain He declared that he would rather refuse the cessation of hostilities and put an end to all negociation than admit a clause so contrary to his own honour and the interest of his kingdom The Queen anxious for peace receded from her demand St John wrote to the Marquis de Torcy that to accomplish the cessation of arms he had only to transmit the act of renunciation to the Duke of Ormond who had succeeded Marlborough in the command of the army in Flanders  Ibid  That the Earl of Strafford had just set out for Utrecht That all restraint with regard to the confederates should be laid aside and that the  British plenipotentiaries should act in concert with those of France in prescribing laws to such as should refuse to submit to just and reasonable conditions of peace  Cause of the anxiety of Anne for a peace  France owed a change so great and so unexpected to favourable accidents more than to her own policy and intrigues Though the British ministry had long perceived that they must either relinquish their power or conclude a peace their late vehemence in carrying on the negociations proceeded from their fears rather than from ambition The Queen herself frightened at the real or supposed conspiracies of the Whigs was anxious to end the war The support given by the confederates to a party whom she dreaded threw her inclinations in the scale of France and she seemed even willing to derive protection from a prince whose power had been so lately broken by her arms The same attention to her own safety raised her resentment against the presumptive heirs of the crown She was no stranger to the dangerous intrigues of the Baron de Bothmar She knew that she had been long distrusted by the family of Hannover The apprehensions incident to her sex had taken intire possession of her mind Though she probably entertained little affection for a brother whom she had never seen though with a zeal suitable to her family she was utterly averse from his system of religious faith and wedded to her own though she was as much afraid of his presence in Britain as she was terrified at the coming of a prince of the electoral family she seems to have entered with a degree of warmth into his cause  Stuartpapers Hannoverpapers    Her attachment to the eventual succession  The violence of the Whigs and the imprudence of the Baron de Bothmar might have precipitated the measures of Anne in concluding the peace but there is reason to believe that her schemes in favour of the Pretender were prior to her late fears from the House of Hannover When Mr Menager in the preceding September had finished the business of his master he is said to have endeavoured to serve the views of the court of St Germains He first opened himself to Mr Secretary St John He was introduced by his means to Mrs Masham the Queen's favourite Two articles of importance were settled in this conference The Queen  desired to be permitted to disown her brother to satisfy the confederates But she agreed that the treaty should not be understood to preclude France from aiding the Pretender in case of her own decease Mrs Masham is said to have declared with freedom the secret sentiments of her mistress She told Menager that the Queen reckoned it an unhappiness to possess the throne of her brother That she had a secret uneasiness on that head That this was not all her misfortune That she was obliged against her disposition and principles to promote measures calculated to exclude her own family for ever from the throne and that she would be inexpressibly happy to be delivered from the necessity of doing so much wrong  Stuartpapers    of the Pretender to the throne  Mrs Masham at the same time declared that though the Queen wished to promote her brother's interest she could fix upon no measure of serving effectually his cause That though a majority of the better sort were attached to the hereditary descent of the crown the common people entertained a mortal aversion to a Popish successor That it was utterly impossible to enter into any treaty without confirming the settlement of the crown in the Protestant line That she had no hopes but such as arose from the most Christian King That she wished to relieve that Prince from every obligation of not assisting her brother in case of her own demise That she could not trust her plenipotentiaries "But sure" said she  "some reserves may be made for the time to come  Ibid  "  Sentiments expressed with so little reserve to a foreigner could not have remained a secret to the Queen's servants Such of these as had principles of the same kind were impressed with fears like her own An intelligence so favourable to their views was soon conveyed to St Germains The Pretender instructed his adherents in both houses of parliament to forward the measures of the crown He was no stranger to the principles of the Earl of Oxford But he hoped that the bad treatment he daily received from the agents of the court of Hannover would at length induce him to oppose their views or at least soften the opposition of that minister to his interest  Ibid    His party assist the ministry  The Queen was extremely sensible of the service rendered to her measures by the Pretender's adherents  Stuartpapers  Though she had created twelve new peers the majority for government in the house of lords was so slender that every vote was liable to accidents When upon rejecting the Duke of Hamilton's patent the peers of Scotland absented themselves the Whigs carried a disagreeable address from the upperhouse to the throne The efforts of the treasurer though he was supposed to have offered weighty arguments upon the subject was not sufficient to recall the refractory Scots to their duty in parliament Many of them were from principle attached to the Pretender Resentment had roused others to a determined resolution of opposing all the measures of the Whigs A kind of rescript from the court of St Germains sent them back to the house of lords  Ibid  and the opposing party lost all the benefit which they hoped to derive from their shortlived victory The same influence was extended to the house of commons where it was less necessary  Ibid  The Earl of Oxford was no stranger to the support he received from the Jacobites He resolved therefore to encourage outwardly their views He admitted the agents of the court of St Germains into his conversation and intimacy His mysterious character gave an air of importance to his very nods and insinuations He could therefore deceive a race of men blinded by an enthusiastic zeal for their own cause The Lady Masham adopting the inclinations of her mistress was much in the interest of the Pretender Her friendship for Oxford had long since declined She wrote to M Menager on the second of March that the affairs of the court of St Germains had fallen into the hands of the treasurer and that he would value himself upon deceiving their hopes and disappointing all their views  MSS passim    He writes to the Queen  The Pretender himself it must be confessed never believed that the Earl of Oxford was sincere But he knew that to oppose that minister was to throw the whole into the hands of the Whigs The lordtreasurer stood on a dangerous precipice He was detested by both sides The Whigs talked of assassination and death The  Tories threatened to deliver him over to the rage of his political enemies In the midst of this secret ferment the Chevalier de St George wrote to the Queen He told her that in the present situation it was impossible for him to remain longer silent He put her in mind of the honour and preservation of her own family He assured her of his eternal gratitude should she use any efficacious measures toward his eventual succession to the throne He promised he said the best to himself from her goodnature and humanity He was ready to agree to whatever she might chuse to propose for her own interest which he reckoned inseparable from his own The Queen was too prudent or perhaps too timid to make any answer to this letter But her inclinations were sufficiently known She even expressed her terror that France would not let him escape from her hands The example of M Fourbin who refused to land him in Scotland in the year was produced as a presumption that the French King was resolved never to part with a person who might hereafter favour his own designs  Stuartpapers    Artifice of the Earl of Oxford  Notwithstanding this anxiety in the Queen her fears from the court of Hannover seem to have weighed more with her mind than her affection for her brother The intelligence which had been industriously conveyed to her ears concerning domestic conspiracies and foreign invasions had even removed for a time her objections to the Popery of the Pretender Urged by the Jacobites and the most violent of the highchurch party she is said to have to resolved to lay before the parliament the secret practices of Prince Eugene and the dangerous schemes of the Baron de Bothmar The principles of the Earl of Oxford had been highly serviceable to the interests of the Electoral family Though the idle project of an invasion proceeded from the indiscreet zeal of his minister the Elector himself had avowed openly his disapprobation of the conduct of the British court The designs of the Whigs if these could be proved might by implication be carried home to his Highness by his enemies Whatever the event of the inquiry might have been the discussion of a matter so delicate would prove  extremely disagreeable to the Electoral family A nation ever subject to extraordinary panics from plots and conspiracies might be roused to a dangerous resentment upon very weak grounds The Earl of Oxford foresaw these difficulties and he dexterously prevented the scheme proposed for laying an account of his discoveries before the parliament To soothe the violence of the Pretender's adherents he made a shew of entering with some zeal into his cause and by insinuating that his succession to the throne could not be prevented contrived to serve effectually the interests of the house of Hannover  Stuartpapers April    He deceives the Jacobites  The Earl of Oxford not content with having judiciously prevented an inquiry in parliament concerning the intrigues of the confederates and Whigs had made every use of his discoveries to hasten the great work of peace Though he disappointed Plunket in not encouraging his intrigues in Holland he had the address to render that Jesuit subservient to his views He was no stranger to the circumstance that Plunket's vigilance in detecting the schemes of his enemies proceeded from views of serving the cause of the Pretender He therefore employed him in communicating to the court of France the discoveries which had been made and the consequent resolution of Queen Anne to conclude a separate peace To please the Jacobites he held forth a specious tale to that impatient and credulous race of men He insinuated that the Pretender could not be immediately served on account of the watchfulness of the Whigs and the unsurmountable prejudices of the vulgar against his family and especially his religion but that there was a fixed resolution formed of keeping a good correspondence with France to enable that kingdom to favour his pretensions to the British throne That it was now in the power of the French King by closing with the wishes and demands of the Queen of Great Britain to impose what terms he pleased upon the confederates of whose ingratitude and conduct she had just grounds to complain  Stuartpapers May    The Queen eager for peace  During these secret transactions in Britain the daughter born to James the Second in his exile died of the  smallpox at St Germains The Pretender himself had fallen ill with such dangerous symptoms of the same disorder as deprived his friends of every hope of his life The fears of Queen Anne for her own person and authority increased in proportion to his danger The proofs which she had received of the designs of the Whigs and confederates had made a deep impression on her mind  Stuartpapers passim  She thought herself defenceless and alone should the check of a pretender to the crown be removed from the supposed views of the family of Hannover whom she was taught to regard in the light of enemies and rivals But though these were her inclinations the same happy timidity which gave rise to her anxiety prevented her from entering with effectual eagerness into her brother's cause She rested all her hopes upon the court of France She hoped from the gratitude of Lewis the Fourteenth for the repose which she alone could bestow a support against the schemes of the confederates and Whigs Urged by these and similiar motives she could no longer hide her anxiety for peace In the moment that fortune by the demise of the Dauphin and his son threatened to throw back the house of Bourbon into all the perils of a disastrous war they were suddenly relieved by the timidity of the Queen of Great Britain The ministry roused by terrors for themselves were equally eager for breaking by a separate peace the power of the confederates Thus every thing conspired to extricate France with advantage and a degree of reputation out of a war that once threatened the dissolution of her monarchy  She lays the treaty  On the sixth of June the Queen came to the house of lords and made a speech from the throne She observed that though the making of peace and war was the undoubted prerogative of the crown she was resolved in consequence of her promise to communicate to her parliament the terms of the treaty before the  me should be concluded That with regard to the concerns of Great Britain the French King had agreed to acknowledge her title and the eventual succession of the  amily of Hannover to the throne That the works and  bour of Dunkirk should be demolished Gibraltar and  Portmahon remain in the possession of Great Britain that the island of St Christophers should be ceded the Streights and Bay of Hudson restored the island of Newfoundland with Placentia delivered up and all Acadia or NovaScotia yielded for ever to the British nation That the trade and commerce of Great Britain should be settled in the best and most permanent manner and that the assiento or contract for furnishing the Spanish WestIndies with negroes should be granted to the subjects of Great Britain for the term of thirty years  before her parliament  With regard to the StatesGeneral she told them that France had agreed to almost the same barrier that had been offered in the negociations of the year That the Spanish Low Countries were to be secured to the Emperor That the Rhine should be the barrier of the Empire that Brisac and the fortresses of Khel and Landau should be ceded that the Protestant interest in Germany should be settled on the plan of the treaty of Westphalia That on the side of Italy the kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia the duchy of Milan the Spanish territories on the Tuscan shore should be yielded to the house of Austria that the fate of Sicily remained still undecided but that all disputes were for ever removed with regard to the cession of that island by the Duke of Anjou That the difference between the barrier demanded by the Duke of Savoy in the year and that offered at present by France was very inconsiderable besides that she herself was endeavouring to procure for his Royal Highness still greater advantages That in return for all Spain and the WestIndies were to remain to King Philip but that to prevent the union of the crowns of France and Spain upon one head that Prince was to renounce for ever in the most solemn manner all pretensions to the French monarchy  Journals June    Arguments against  This speech was received by the nation as individual  were attached to one or other of the parties that strov  for the management of public affairs The adherents o  the Whigs affirmed that should these conditions o  peace be accepted they could not perceive why th  war was at all begun That the grand confederacy wa  intended to depress the exorbitant power of France b  the accession of a Prince of the house of Bourbon to th  throne of Spain but that by the present treaty that power was left in the same state as when hostilities commenced That the renunciation of Philip offered as a security was rather a matter of ridicule than any serious proposal That the promises and oaths of Princes were but weak obstacles in the way of their ambition That France herself had been so just as to own that any agreement of a Prince to break the succession of a crown was nugatory as being contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom That should King Philip think himself bound by his own renunciation neither his posterity nor the French themselves would allow that he had a power to extend the obligation beyond his own life That however insignificant the rights of monarchy might appear to the people of Great Britain who had broken the line of succession in their own country the thing was regarded with another eye in France where the descent of the crown was deemed the first link of that great chain which kept together the vast body of the monarchy  and for the peace  On the other side it was affirmed that since the commencement of the war the face of things was totally changed that France broken by a series of uncommon misfortunes had ceased to be dangerous that as the state of affairs now stood fresh expedients and measures were not only proper but even necessary That when the war began King Charles the Third was only a titular monarch without a revenue without power and without importance That the case was now much altered as that Prince had obtained the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria together with the imperial crown That it would be the height of folly to revive in the person of the present Emperor the power which endangered Europe in the days of Charles the Fifth That should the confederates resolve at any rate to place the crown of Spain on the head of the Emperor the success would at best be doubtful That it would be extremely idle and highly impolitic to throw away blood and treasure on an undertaking which by being accomplished would destroy that very balance for which the maritime powers had so long contended with the house of Bourbon That as to Philip's renunciation though a slender thing in itself it derived great force from the efforts  of those who were to enjoy its benefits that as matters were situated the best means had been used for answering the end for which the war began that there was at present but a bare possibility that the succession of France should fall to the share of the King of Spain but that there was a certainty of present danger from the union of the Spanish monarchy to the power of the house of Austria strengthened by the influence derived by that family from an uninterrupted possession of the Imperial crown  The commons vote an address of thanks  In the house of commons an address of thanks was voted without one dissenting voice  Journals June  But the lords adjourned the business to the next day and when they met fell into warm debates Though the Whigs affected to despise the articles of the proposed peace these were well received by the body of a nation already groaning under the burden of an unprofitable war The terms were deemed by the dispassionate favourable to the kingdom In the treaty of the year upon which the excluded party highly valued themselves no specific advantages to Great Britain were proposed In the present she had not only obtained a security to her commerce but even an accession of territory The truth is that the whole was very inadequate to the expence of the war and unsuitable to its uncommon success No doubt can now be entertained that had the confederates continued to press France on the side of Flanders but the crown of Spain must have been relinquished by the house of Bourbon But it is extremely doubtful whether the British ministry were acquainted with a circumstance which the French only owned when the season for redressing the evil was past The opposition in the house of lords despairing to prevent the address endeavoured to clog it with an amendment They proposed an addition to the motion for obtaining the guarantee of the allies to the treaty but upon a division it was rejected by a great majority  June  A protest entered by several lords upon this question was after a warm debate expunged out of the books of the house  June    Other transactions  Their approbation of the articles of peace was the last business of importance transacted in this session of parliament Besides the great business of the treaty and the consequent contests of parties on that subject some other affairs that deserve to be mentioned fell under discussion in the two houses The act for a general naturalization of all foreign Protestants was repealed  Feb  This law which had been passed by the Whigs when in power had been always odious to the highchurch party They said that as most Protestants abroad differed from the churchgovernment established in England so the naturalizing bill was calculated to increase the number of Dissenters in the kingdom But after the surmises of a projected invasion were carried to the ministry one other essential reason was added to the former for repealing the act The party affirmed that when that law subsisted no importation of foreign Protestants could be deemed illegal that a foreign Prince might become when he pleased master of the kingdom by sending judiciously his subjects before him into a country where they became denizens at the expence of a shilling a head the common price of an oath to the government That should such a Prince which was likely to be soon the case ascend the throne of Great Britain he might without any breach on the laws of the kingdom enslave the nation with an army of his native subjects  of parliament  The repealing of the act of naturalization was considered by the Dissenters in the light of an attack upon themselves But this was not the only invasion on their established opinions of which they chose to complain The commons in their attachment to the church of England extended their protection to the episcopal clergy in Scotland A bill was introduced for granting a toleration to all such as should use the liturgy of the church in that part of the kingdom The thing seemed so reasonable that no opposition was made But a clause in the bill required the civil magistrates to execute none of the sentences of the judicatory of the church of Scotland The Presbyterians were alarmed at a circumstance that annihilated their ecclesiastical authority The bill however passed with little opposition in either house It was  followed by another which was contrary to the Presbyterian principles The courts of judicature in Scotland were commanded by an act to discontinue their sittings during some days at Christmas though the observing of holidays is contrary to the tenets of Presbytery But the most mortifying act of all was that for restoring patronages which had been abolished in King William's reign In vain was it urged that such an invasion on the church of Scotland was a breach upon the union of the two kingdoms by which the rights of Presbytery were unalterably secured The bill passed with little opposition notwithstanding the complaints and petitions of several of the Scotish clergy  Burnet vol iv    Campaign of Inactivity of Ormond  While the nation were in a state of suspence with regard to the negociations carried on between Great Britain and France the confederates took the field in Flanders The Prince of Savoy had received a reinforcement of Germans that increased the army to the number of one hundred and twentytwo thousand men The Duke of Ormond who had succeeded Marlborough in the command of the British forces and such troops as were in British pay arrived in the camp near Douay in the end of April That nobleman found himself extremely uneasy in the high station in which he was placed He had carried orders from the Queen to hazard by no means a battle unless he perceived an apparent and great advantage He was sensible of the extreme difficulty of executing such undecisive orders and at the same time of concealing the real motive of his conduct from the penetrating eye of the Prince of Savoy He however resolved to obey her Majesty's commands and to prevent as much as possible the cause of his conduct from being even suspected  M de Torey tom ii  The strong situation of the French army under the Mareschal de Villars who had posted himself behind the Scheld had induced the Duke to hope that no action could happen The Prince of Savoy however finding that the enemy had not occupied with entrenchments the small space between the source of the Somme and that of the Scheld made dispositions for attacking Villars His design was to decide the fate of the war by a battle or to force the French to retire and to  leave Cambray exposed to a siege He communicated his intentions to the Duke of Ormond on the twentyeighth of May His Grace declining to give an immediate answer confirmed the Prince in the suspicions which he had for some time entertained The deputies of the States sent an immediate account of Ormond's inactivity to the Hague The States sent an express to the court of Great Britain The Whigs brought the affair into the house of lords But the ministry were neither moved with the representations of the Dutch nor the majority of the peers persuaded by the clamours of the excluded party  Journals Publication of the Times    Consternation of the confederates  During this state of altercation and suspence the Prince of Savoy resolved to sit down before Quesnoy This siege was but of short continuance The town surrendered after a weak defence and the garrison were made prisoners of war The spirits of the confederates depressed by the inactivity of Ormond were greatly exalted by this success But as the proposed cessation of arms between Great Britain and France was no longer a matter of mere suspicion the former dejection of the allies returned They pretended to make no doubt but that all the troops in British pay would follow the British forces They dreaded that the Mareschal de Villars would take advantage of the separation and attack the Prince of Savoy The States in particular were afraid of a terrible reverse of fortune at the end of a prosperous war Their plenipotentiaries at Utrecht reproached the Bishop of Bristol with the odious conduct of his court They perceived themselves exposed in a desenceless state to the vengeance of an enemy whom they had treated with haughtiness and contempt They exaggerated the perils of their condition They even mixed threats with expressions of despair But their former courage returned then they understood that the foreign troops in the pay of Great Britain refused to follow the Duke of Ormond  Intrigues of Marlborough with the Dutch  This measure so distressful to the British ministry  ceeded from the assiduity of the Duke of Marlborough That nobleman wrote to the Pensionary Heinsius and  Prince of Savoy to hinder the foreign troops from  beying the Duke of Ormond He hoped to prevent by  this contrivance the French King from delivering up Dunkirk to the British forces That circumstance which was likely to happen would infallibly raise the clamours of the populace against the ministry terrify the Tories in parliament and give a plausible pretext to the Whigs to send the authors of the ineffectual peace to the Tower The Duke in conjunction with the Lords Halifax and Somers proposed another scheme more decisive in its consequences but less easy to be accomplished They advised the States to assist the Elector of Hannover to pass with a force into Great Britain Their project was to spread a report that the Pretender at the instigation of the ministry was preparing to invade the kingdom with a French army and at the same time to declare in a manifesto that his Electoral Highness was arrived to secure the succession of the crown in the Protestant line  Stuartpapers  They affirmed that the people alarmed for their religion and liberty would flock round his standard and that the Queen like her father would make her escape to France This plausible project is said to have been transmitted to the Princess Sophia But the less violent Whigs are reported to have advised her clandestinely to refuse her consent as that measure might furnish the Tories already averse from the interests of her family with a pretence for altering the succession  Ibid    The auxiliaries refuse to obey the Duke of Ormond  The refusal of the foreign troops to obey the Duke of Ormond transferred the perplexity of the other confederates to the British court They had agreed with the French that the Queen's troops consisting of twentyfive battalions and ninetyfour squadrons should separate themselves from the army under the Prince of Savoy But when Ormond communicated his orders for that purpose to the generals of the auxiliaries they refused to obey One battalion and four squadrons of the Duke of Holstein and two squadrons of Walef's regiment of dragoons of the country of Liege were the only foreigner that seemed ready to follow the British general  Mem de Torcy tom ii  The intelligence was received in London by different persons as they were variously inclined to the contending parties  The joy expressed by the Whigs was unbounded The  indignation of the Tories was equally excessive Reports were spread that a design was formed by the Prince of Savoy to disarm the British forces and to confine the Duke of Ormond This question had certainly been agitated at the consults of the malecontents with Prince Eugene in the month of February  Stuartpapers De Torcy Swift's four Years  But whether it was ever intended to be put in execution is rather to be suspected than proved  The French refuse to deliver up Dunkirk  The refusal of the auxiliaries to obey his orders reduced the Duke of Ormond to a state of the utmost perplexity and uneasiness He delayed his march till he should receive positive commands from his court The ministry were thrown into a degree of consternation by fresh complaints on the subject from the French King They had lost the confidence of the allies They had fallen under the distrust of the court of Versailles The principal terms of the stipulated cessation was the delivery of Dunkirk and the immediate confirmation of the renunciation made by King Philip of his eventual succession to the crown of France Lewis the Fourteenth informed the Queen of Great Britain that he understood the proposed cessation to be general between the two armies That should he even satisfy himself with a particular cessation he wished to be understood that all the troops in British pay should quit the rest of the confederates That till this condition should be fulfilled he thought proper to suspend his orders for admitting the British troops into Dunkirk Mr Secretary St John soon removed this difficulty by the express orders of his mistress He wrote to the Marquis de Torcy that the Queen was resolved to unite herself effectually with France to defeat this last effort of men who to satisfy their private resentment wished to protract the calamities of war That to shew the firmness of her mind and sincerity of her intentions she had commanded him to signify to the ministers from those Princes whose troops were in the British pay that should they persist to separate themselves from her native troops they should expect no more of her money  M de Torcy tom ii  That positive orders were in the mean time sent to the Duke of Ormond  to separate the British forces from allies that neither deserved nor should receive her support  They however yield and a suspension of arms is declared  The court of France were too eager for a tranquillity that was so necessary to their affairs not to suffer themselves to be convinced by St John's letter They foresaw that the confederates upon being deserted by Great Britain would either seriously think of peace or become subject to a sudden reverse in war Orders were immediately dispatched for delivering Dunkirk to the British troops The obstructions experienced already by the Duke of Ormond induced the ministry to place the fate of the peace in a kind of independence upon accident They sent Sir John Leake to take the command of the fleet in the Downs They ordered him to provide transports for carrying troops to occupy Dunkirk from Great Britain On the eighth of July Brigadier Hill took possession of the place Two days before this event the Prince of Savoy separated himself from the British troops and sat down before Landrecy The Duke of Ormond directing his route to Avesne le Seiq declared at that place a suspension of arms In his march toward Ghent which city together with Bruges he intended to occupy he was refused by the confederates a passage through Bouchain He was treated with the same disrespect and distrust by the garrisons of Douay Tournay Oudenarde and Lisle On the twelfth of July the Duke took possession of Ghent and soon after of Bruges and thus by commanding the navigation of the Lys and Scheld became the umpire of the operations between the contending armies  Publications of the Times    The allies defeated at Denain  The goodfortune of the confederates ceased at the separation of the British forces from their army in Flanders The happy rashness of the Duke of Marlborough in the preceding campaign had rendered the Prince of Savoy the only rival of his glory more enterprising Having opened the trenches before Landrecy he placed a body of his troops at Denain to favour the passage of his convoys from Marchiennes  Hist d'Angleterre  His own camp was fortified and independent of insult But the Mareschal de Villars however had the address to render the Prince  afraid of being attacked which induced him to weaken the body of troops commanded by the Earl of Albemarle at Denain That lord's force at last consisted of fourteen thousand men Villars having made a feint of advancing towards his right on the side of Landrecy turned suddenly to the left and arriving at Neuville in the morning of the twentyfourth threw at once three bridges across the Scarpe The Prince of Savoy apprized of the unexpected march of the enemy hastened to the lines between Denain and Neuville He reinforced the Earl of Albemarle with six battalions He went in person to hasten the march of his right wing He had scarce quitted the lines when they were entered almost without resistance by the Count de Broglio Four battalions of Palatines and other German auxiliaries threw down their arms and fled The whole French line having passed the Scheld were led by Villars against the camp of the Earl of Albemarle He marched up to the enemy without firing a single shot He entered the intrenchments cut those who resisted to pieces and forced the survivors to fly But their retreat was cut off by the precaution of the French general who had occupied a bridge which they had built behind on the Scheld  Rapid progress of France  The loss of the confederates was considerable in an action which decided the fate of the war One thousand were slain in the engagement and flight Fifteen hundred were drowned Two thousand five hundred fell into the hands of the victors Many officers of great distinction were taken killed or lost in the Scheld The Prince of Savoy had the mortification to arrive when his friends were incapable of receiving relief He attempted in vain to force the bridge occupied by the French This however was only the beginning of a long chain of misfortunes Marchiennes where all the magazines of the confederates were deposited was taken in three days Prince Eugene instead of annoying the enemy was not  ble to defend himself He raised the siege of Landrecy Douay  August  Quesnoy  Sept  and Bouchain  Oct  were suc  essively taken in his sight The taking of Marchiennes  depriving the Prince of the means of war enabled the  nemy to prosecute their operations with vigour A success  so uncommon and so unexpected elevated the French beyond measure The joy of the British ministry was equal but less obvious than that of the court of Versailles They were glad to see the haughtiness of the Whigs humbled their hopes disappointed their opposition to the peace as it were punished in a signal manner their affected contempt of their own nation since they ceased to be commanded by a general of their party all revenged by a defeat which could not fail to be followed by consequences fatal to their views  Hist d'Angleterre Hist de France Kane's Mem    Campaign in Spain Italy Dauphiné and on the Rhine  The signal events of this campaign were confined to Flanders No enterprise of consequence was undertaken no action of renown happened on any other side of the war In Italy the Imperialists besieged and took Porto Hercole In Spain the Count de Staremberg though delivered from a formidable enemy by the death of Vendôme attempted nothing important King Philip having a near prospect of peace permitted the war to languish on his side In Dauphiné and Savoy the summer was spent by the contending armies in observing each other's motions An inactivity prevailed on the frontiers of Portugal The Duke of Wirtemberg who commanded the army of the Empire on the Rhine formed a project toward the end of the campaign to force the lines of Weissembourg and to penetrate into Alsace Having detached two bodies of his troops by two different roads they were deceived by their guides and meeting in the night charged one another as enemies and returned in the utmost confusion to their own camp Thus ended in misfortune and disgrace the operations of a war which had covered the arms of the confederates with so much renown  Hist of Europe Hist de France tom iii    Tendency toward a peace  The disappointments on the part of the allies diminished their hopes But the time for putting an end to the war was not yet arrived The Queen of Great Britain herself though she appeared anxious for peace endangered the success of that measure by peremptorily insisting upon the cession of the kingdom of Sicily in favour of the Duke of Savoy  M de Torcy tom ii  Mr Secretary St John  who had been raised to the peerage on the seventh of July by the title of Viscount Bolingbroke had demanded that article in terms more likely to create a quarrel than to facilitate the conclusion of the negociation But when the court of France was embarrassed about the answer most proper to be made to his Lordship he informed them by letter that he was commanded by the Queen to go in person to France He accordingly arrived at Paris in the end of the month of August His instructions furnished his Lordship with full powers to bring the negociation to a speedy conclusion But this power was annexed to the indispensable condition of obtaining Sicily for the Duke of Savoy The Queen of Great Britain expressed a particular attention to that Prince which might be considered unaccountable upon any other grounds than her deeming his family after herself and the Pretender the next in blood to the succession of the crown upon the ancient form But though she insisted upon obtaining an immediate kingdom for the Duke her principal object in his favour was the eventual succession of the house of Savoy to the throne of Spain after the failure of King Philip and his posterity  Bolingbroke sent to France  This sudden resolution of sending Bolingbroke to France proceeded from the earnestness for peace expressed upon every occasion by that lord He had advised the Queen to prefer a suspension of hostilities as the most certain means of obviating the difficulties which the enemies of peace opposed to a simple cessation of arms The example of Great Britain he affirmed would be soon followed by the confederates The Kings of Portugal and Prussia he said as well as the Duke of Savoy and the Dutch were too prudent to continue the war after the separation of such a powerful ally as Great Britain and should the Emperor and empire sacrifice their convenience and interest to their resentment he assured her that they would soon drop a contest which they could not maintain with any effect The Earl of Oxford opposed the advice of Bolingbroke to avoid giving offence to the Elector of Hannover Though he was attached from principle to that Prince he was apprehensive of being called to an account whenever he should ascend the  British throne This event seemed to be at no great distance as the Queen daily declined in her health This was the cause of all those delays and uneasinesses which might have been prevented by a definitive treaty between Great Britain and France This conduct was extremely impolitic in the minister as it gave an appearance of timidity to his measures a circumstance which exposed him to all the machinations and intrigues of his own enemies and those of the peace  M de Torcy tom ii Stuartpapers    Terms settled between him and de Torcy  When Bolingbroke arrived at Paris he entered into conferences with the Marquis de Torcy on the object of his embassy The two ministers possessed of unlimited powers from their respective courts soon agreed That the Duke of Savoy and his descendants should be called to the throne of Spain in default of King Philip and his male posterity That this substitution should be inserted in all the public acts with regard to the renunciation of Philip's right to the crown of France That the renunciation itself should be registered in the books of the parliament of Paris and admitted solemnly by the cortes or states of Castile and Arragon That the cession of Sicily to the Duke of Savoy should for the present remain a secret for various reasons But that he should never be suffered to alienate that island for any other territory The article of the barrier to this favoured Prince was not so easily settled The French minister refused to grant more for that purpose than Exilles Fenestrelles and the valley of Pragelas This whole affair was therefore referred to the general congress at Utrecht The two secretaries of Great Britain and France having settled these terms the Viscount Bolingbroke had an audience of the French King He was received with the utmost politeness by that Prince and was treated by the whole court with a respect suitable to the earnest desire of the kingdom for peace The cessation of arms was prolonged for four months and Bolingbroke having left Prior to manage the affairs of his nation in France returned to London highly satisfied with the success of his embassy  M  de Torcy tom ii    States eager for peace  The change of affairs in Flanders had rendered the confederates sensible that they were incapable to maintain the war should Great Britain desert the grand alliance The Dutch who had most to lose by a continuation of hostilities were the first who seriously thought of peace The defeat at Denain the subsequent misfortunes the disappointment of the projects of the Prince of Savoy had blasted their hopes and humbled their pride Their eyes were opened to the true state of their affairs They descended at once from that haughtiness with which they had been inspired by the success of the war Instead of prescribing terms to the house of Bourbon they solicited the good offices of Great Britain for renewing the conferences which had been long interrupted by their own obstinacy They dropt their pretensions of receiving all the answers of the French plenipotentiaries in writing The latter therefore agreed to renew the conferences upon condition that the Queen of Great Britain's speech to her parliament should be admitted as the plan of the treaty The ministers of the other allies were alarmed at the pusillanimity of the Dutch Count Zinzendorff the Imperial minister repeated his exhortations and promises He assured them that the Prince of Savoy was on his march to fight Villars That he was sure of victory That as there was no risk in suspending the conferences the States ought to temporize by waiting for the result of events  Swift's Four Years De Torcy tom ii    An incident interrupts the conferences  Zinzendorff prevailed The conferences under various pretences were delayed But when time brought no favourable change the Dutch fell into their former fears They redoubled their solicitations for the renewal of the conferences of Utrecht A silly quarrel between the servants of M Menager one of the French plenipotentiaries and those of the Count de Rechteren deputy of the province of Overyssel interrupted again the great work of peace The French King took advantage of the folly of Rechteren as it was not his interest to conset with the allies till he had settled his measures with the Viscount Bolingbroke The pretence itself was plausible He insisted that the States should declare whether Rechteren followed their orders in his insolent conduct  or whether he had pursued the dictates of a passionate mind inflamed by the arts of the house of Austria If he acted in obedience to his masters there was no safety he said for his ministers at Utrecht If he had no guide but his own passion the States were called upon to disavow the conduct of a servant who had abused their confidence The French King therefore told them that Rechteren should be recalled by his constituents and another deputy be appointed in his place This dictatorial conduct so contrary to the abject behaviour of the court of France in the year was not capable to raise the indignation of the States The haughtiness which assumed the name of spirit at that period had vanished with their good fortune and they suffered an enemy whom they despised to retort upon them their own wanton insolence with impunity  The Queen interferes for the Dutch  The abject behaviour of the States was at present of some advantage to their affairs Their submission to the French reconciled the court of Great Britain to their interest The resentment of the British nation ceased with the obstinacy of the Dutch The ministry resolved to interfere in their cause They pressed therefore the court of France to a separate peace They desired them to register immediately the renunciations as on them the peace of Europe depended That upon the fulfilling of this essential article the Queen of Great Britain should declare that she could obtain no other plan but that offered by France That it was the business of the confederates to determine upon this head That they should have three months to consider but that the French King should be no longer obliged to grant even these terms after the expiration of the time The Queen insisted in return with the court of Versailles to depart from their claims on the restitution of Tournay  M de Torcy tom ii  That town she said as it was the great object of the States was also necessary to their barrier Though Lewis had resolved to retain Tournay he yielded prudently to her request He sound that by the bad state of the Queen's health there was reason to fear she might die in the midst of an unfinished war He knew that the ministry must fall with her life That their enemies and his own would again possess themselves of the whole power of the  kingdom That a Prince who had declared himself averse from peace was to mount the throne and was likely to renew or rather to continue the war  M de Torcy tom ii    Secret views of the Queen  This prudential concession of Lewis the Fourteenth smoothed the way for a treaty which was not destined to be soon concluded But though the clandestine measures for restoring peace employed much of the time of Queen Anne a part of her attention was turned to views that were still more secret Those who were most about her person perceiving her inclinations urged her perpetually with regard to the interest of the Pretender She seemed willing to favour his views But she perceived obstacles in his way which he himself had not the strength of mind to remove In her own attachment to the church of England she signified her inclinations that the Pretender should relinquish Popery and place himself in a capacity of being served When she was urged by the Duke of Buckingham to endeavour to break the succession in the Protestant line her answer though it conveyed a regard for her brother was suitable to good sense and prudence  "How can I serve him"  she said  "my Lord He makes not the least step to oblige me in what I most desire You know a Papist cannot enjoy this crown in peace But the example of the father has no weight with the son He prefers his religious errors to the throne of a great kingdom How therefore can I undo what I have already done He may thank himself for his exclusion He knows that I love my own family better than that of any other All would be easy should he enter the pale of the church of England Advise him to change his religion as that only can change the opinions of mankind in his favour  Stuartpapers July  "  with regard to the Pretender  Though Buckingham had assured the family of Hannover that he had been persecuted by the Whigs for this attachment to the Protestant succession  Hannoverpapers passim  he conveyed this intelligence to the court of St Germains He at the same time seconded the request of the Queen But his arguments were lost on the Pretender and his servants Though that unfortunate Prince was in no danger of becoming an apostle like his father he was perhaps  equally attached to the Romish faith Under a pretence that his conversion would be deemed insincere he evaded the request of his friends He affirmed he had so little prejudice against the religion of his country that he intended to carry along with him to the place of his exile a Protestant clergyman to officiate to his Protestant servants That when he should be permitted to return to Great Britain he would be ready to hear such arguments as might induce him to change his present faith That it was even the interest of England to have a Prince on the throne whose religion would lessen the power which the constitution had placed in his hands That as he was ready to relinquish during his own time the prerogative of nominating Bishops and of appointing clergymen to livings no danger could be apprehended by the established church That he was willing the present tests so far as they regarded Popery should continue and as he entertained no prejudice against the doctrines of the church of England he was ready to have no servants but such as were of the Protestant persuasion  Stuartpapers    Reflections  These professions might be honest but they were an irrefragable proof of weakness A man who relinquished his hopes of a great kingdom for a speculative tenet of faith discovered a degree of enthusiasm that ought never to be trusted Insincerity itself is less a crime in a prince than folly He who wishes to govern nations must rule them through their principles otherwise his government becomes a tyranny and only lasts as long as it is not opposed Among a people accustomed to monarchy the Sovereign only is capable of shaking his own throne To differ from his subjects in their religious opinions is almost the only prerogative which he may not without danger employ Of all mankind HE has the least right to be singular in his faith If he is not willing to go to heaven in the same way with his people they will scaree acknowledge the legality of his authority on earth That public affection which is the chief support of his throne must be changed for suspicion and jealousy A mutual distrust prevails which will soon degenerate into that unforgiving aversion that invariably follows a difference of faith in feeble minds When society is even mellowed down into an indifference which borders on infidelity  the worst consequences are to be expected and feared Indignation against the weakness of a bigot will even then supply the place of religious zeal and violence itself becomes just in a certain degree when it is opposed to folly  The Tories urge the Pretender  The generality of the Tories in their vehement zeal for the hereditary descent of the crown overlooked the attachment of the Pretender to the Popish faith Afraid only of the violence of the common people they recommended to him to make a show of changing his religion They assured him that should he declare himself a member of the church of England without the formality of a public conversion they would endeavour to obtain the repeal of the act of settlement in the present parliament That however the Pretender could not be mentioned in the new law That the disposal of the crown according to the precedents of former times should be vested in the reigning Queen That however she must be restricted to leave her throne to a Protestant That as her affection for her brother was not be suspected they had no apprehensions of her not making a will in his favour That in the mean time to obviate every danger of disappointment he should be permitted to live in Scotland That they expected from his own prudence a moderate comportment during his sister's life That considering the bad state of her health the possession of the crown could be no distant object and that an outward compliance with the forms of worship established by law in Great Britain was only wanting to the completion of the whole design  Stuartpapers    to change his religion  Though the hopes of the Tories were too sanguine to be so very easily accomplished there was a degree of good fortune in the religious obstinacy of the Pretender Had he been less prejudiced or perhaps more dishonest he might at this period break or at least greatly endanger the succession of the family of Hannover to the crown Though men of distinction and eminence have ascribed the success of the Revolution and Protestant succession to their own abilities and patriotism the benefits of both were derived from the happy zeal of the common people for the established religion Though the excluded  family  ere guilty of many follies they were only odious on  of their Popery A popular cry against their bigotry which was far from being illfounded was more fatal to  than the act of settlement The most zealous of their abettors were unable to stop this torrent When they planned their measures in secret for the restoration of their favourite line of Kings they were terrified from all their schemes by the clamours of the populace Those therefore who wished at this period that the Pretender should change his religion were his best friends Without reconciling the lower sort in some degree to his person by his adopting their saith it is extremely doubtful whether the abrogation of the act of settlement the zeal of his sister or the efforts of all his friends could render him secure upon the throne  Stuartpapers    Designs of the Whigs  But though the Whigs suspected these secret intrigues and conveyed insinuations concerning them to the public with many aggravating circumstances they were not able to gain the people to their views They affirmed that by a secret article of the separate peace between Great Britain and France Scotland was to be immediately ceded to the Pretender  Ibid July  They carried their surmizes with unabated diligence to the press But there they met the enemy upon disadvantageous ground The Earl of Oxford had the good fortune to be supported before the public by able and persevering writers He owed this circumstance like his power to the state of the times and neither to his own liberality nor conduct The dangers of domestic compiracies from the Whigs and even of an invasion from abroad by the confederates were inculcated with vivacity and force Though no effectual measures for carrying into execution either of these designs had been taken by the discontented they failed more from the want of opportunity than inclination The excluded party and especially the Duke of Marlborough who still preserved an influence with the Dutcl continued to urge the confederates to continue the war  They were even said to have eagerly suggested an attempt similar to that which had proved so successful at the late Revolution They affirmed that the fleet and army were both averse from the Queen's  measures and that a change in the throne and consequently an alteration of measures might be accomplished without drawing the sword  Stuartpapers July    Oxford pays court in vain to the house of Hannover  During schemes formed by the two parties the Earl of Oxford pursued a secret line of his own Perceiving the declining health of the Queen he was anxious to stretch beyond her life the term of his power or at least to insure his safety To this point was directed all his care and attention in times sufficiently agitated with more important concerns To accomplish his purpose he endeavoured by deceiving the court of St Germains with his mysterious conduct to gain the favour of the house of Hannover  Ibid  In both he was equally unsuccessful The Jacobites formed some hopes on the necessity of his situation but none upon his attachment to their cause The Electoral family swayed by the misrepresentations of the Whigs became insensible to all his submissions and earnest professions  Hannoverpapers  To solicit their good opinion he had ordered Mr Thomas Harley from Utrecht to the court of Hannover To bespeak a favourable reception Harley carried to the Princess Sophia the act passed in the last session of parliament for settling the precedence of her family as the next heirs of the crown of Great Britain Harley who from the station of an assistant to the secretary of the treasury was thus raised to the character of ambassador extraordinary arrived at Hannover in the month of July If he was charged with any thing but professions of attachment from the minister he had not the good fortune to succeed The Elector continued with all his influence to oppose the peace and made at the same time no secret of his distrust of the Queen and her principal servants  Duke of Hamilton appointed ambassador to France  With regard to the latter the Elector was certainly deceived But a doubt can scarce be formed that Anne herself was extremely averse from the succession of his Highness to the throne She was no stranger to the attachment of the lordtreasurer to the house of Hannover She knew that Bolingbroke had never brought any principle in competition with his own interest She was resolved to trust neither in an affair which seems to have  engaged the greatest part of her thoughts With a natural jealousy of her own authority she declined to gratify the Jacobites by calling her brother into the kingdom But she was extremely anxious to settle with France some plan to secure his eventual succession after her own death To accomplish her purpose she had very early in the present year fixed her eyes on the Duke of Hamilton as a proper person to be sent ambassador to the court of Versailles Bolingbroke who managed the treaty hitherto frustrated this design by taking that province to himself in the preceding summer But soon after the return of that nobleman from Paris she appointed the Duke her ambassadorextraordinary to the French King  He is unfairly killed in a duel  An accident fatal to the Duke of Hamilton disappointed at once the designs of the Queen and the hopes of the Jacobites from his embassy The Duke and the Lord Mohun a man of an infamous character  Swift's four last years  who had been twice tried for murder had been engaged in a tedious lawsuit for many years the circumstances of which had kindled between them the most bitter animosity and enmity Being both present at the examination of witnesses at the chambers of a master in chancery Hamilton threw a kind of reflection on one of the persons examined which seemed to glance at the Lord Mohun His Lordship urged by one General Macartney a person attached to the Whigs and especially to the Duke of Marlborough sent a challenge to the Duke and they met in Hydepark in the morning of the fifteenth of November Hamilton killed his adversary on the spot though he himself was wounded When faint with the loss of blood he was leaning in the arms of his second he is said to have been barbarously stabbed in the breast by Macartney  Ibid Examination be+fore the council  He died in a few minutes in the field Macartney made his escape A proclamation was issued against him by the privycouncil The Tories ascribed the Duke's death to the malice of the Whigs The Queen was terrified The populace were variously affected and the writers of government accused in open terms their political enemies of murder  Publications of the Times    Duke of Marlborough quits the kingdom  The current running violently against the Whigs upon this occasion the Duke of Marlborough who was perhaps unjustly accused of being privy to the challenge thought proper to retire from the kingdom The Earl of Oxford is said to have embraced this favourable opportunity for ridding himself of an enemy whom he had reason to fear He informed his Grace that he was well acquainted with his correspondence abroad and his intrigues at home That he knew of his secret applications to the States his clandestine measures to induce the troops to desert the Duke of Ormond his secret designs against the government his dangerous consults with the Prince of Savoy That he had long been no stranger to his correspondence with the court of St Germains That he had been apprized of his negociations for selling a peace to France on a former occasion and his present project for invading the kingdom with a foreign sorce That notwithstanding the proofs in his hands he meant nothing less than to seek his life or to ruin his fortune That however for his own security he must request his Grace to quit the kingdom as the only means to put an end to his own suspicions and the fears of the Queen  Stuartpapers  They had a meeting on this subject at the house of Mr Thomas Harley and Marlborough left London on the twentyfourth of November Having passed from Dover to Ostend he was received with distinguished honours by all the Dutch garrisons in his way to Antwerp where he fixed his residence  Duke of Shrewsberry sent to France  The death of the Duke of Hamilton made way for the Duke of Shrewsberry as ambassador to the court of Versailles The jealousy of the lordtreasurer is said to have raised his Grace to that dignity Both Shrewsberry and Buckingham were much attached to the cause of the Pretender They had great influence with the Queen and they led the cabinetcouncil To remove them from office was beyond the lordtreasurer's power Yet they were great checks upon the execution of his own designs He apprehended from Shrewsberry though a Jacobite no danger in France as the timidity of his character was a sufficient security against his principles Though the  peace with the house of Bourbon was not formally concluded acts of confidence and friendship had passed for some months before between them and the court of London The Lord Lexington having been appointed ambassadorextraordinary to Philip the Fifth had arrived at Madrid in the middle of October The professed business of Lexington was to be present at the King of Spain's solemn renunciation of the crown of France for himself and his posterity which ceremony was performed in the presence of the council of Castile and Arragon Philip in return to the embassy of Great Britain ordered the Marquis de Monteleone to repair to London in a public capacity No Prince could owe more to another than the King of Spain to Queen Anne and therefore the politeness of the ambassador was expressive of his master's gratitude  Publications of the Times    Affairs  Whilst the war in the West of Europe was hastening to a period that in the North and East was carried on with various turns of fortune The obstinacy of the King of Sweden detained him still at Bender His kingdom was pressed on every side by powerful enemies His intrigues at Constantinople effectuated various changes in the Ottoman ministry In the year the Turks by his influence declared war against the Russians An army of one hundred and fifty thousand men passed in seven columns the Danube They advanced to the southern bank of the Pruth eleven leagues from the mouth of that river The Russians led by Czeremetoff under whom the Czar served in person in quality of lieutenantgeneral had the imprudence to suffer themselves to be surrounded in a narrow pass formed by the Pruth Peter was now in the same desperate condition with Charles himself at Pultowa But though he was equally unfortunate he was more prudent He desired to capitulate He strengthened his request with large presents to the Vizier He obtained advantageous terms when he had nothing to expect but misfortune Charles who had declined to attend an army which he was not suffered to command hearing of the situation of the Russians hastened to the Ottoman camp He arrived just in time to see his mortal enemy relieved from his distress He reproached the Vizier He demanded a detachment  for pursuing the Czar He could obtain nothing He returned in a furious manner to Bender  Hist du Nord tom ii    of the North  The Czar unexpectedly relieved from his misfortunes on the side of Turkey resolved to turn his whole force against the kingdom of Sweden The Kings of Denmark and Poland entered Pomerania with their united forces But their success was not answerable either to the fears of the Swedes or their own expectations Having sat down before Stralsund they could make no impression on the place They attacked Wismer with no success They retreated to their respective dominions and closed the campaign of with disgrace In the summer of the present year the King of Denmark turned his arms against the duchy of Bremen He crossed the Elbe with a numerous army He sat down before Stade His troops in the mean time held Wismer in blockade The Swedish general Steinbock assembied his army fortified Stralsund and came to battle with the enemy Though the Danes had all the advantage of superior numbers and of the weather and ground they were totally routed and put to flight The unfortunate King Stanislaus had the satisfaction to be present in an action where his allies acquired so much renown  Hist du Nord Dec    Progress toward a general peace  The affairs of Great Britain consisted more of the secret intrigues of parties than of transactions that commanded the attention of the Public The hopes of the adherents of the Pretender and the jealousies of the friends of the house of Hannover were encouraged and fomented with great industry by the violent leaders of both sides The year closed with the arrival of the Duke d'Aumont as ambassador from the court of Versailles to that of London Though the defection of Great Britain from the grand alliance promised a certain end to the war the progress toward peace was made but by very slow degrees The resolute conduct of the British ministry gradually overcame the delays of the allies The Earl of Strafford repairing to the Hague with orders from the Queen to settle a new barrier treaty with the States induced the Republic to accede to the plan of sacification settled between Great Britain and France  Their example was successively followed by the Duke of Savoy and the King of Portugal The first owed too much to the Queen to oppose longer her pacific measures The latter already tired of the war was forced suddenly to patch up a peace by a Spanish invasion of his kingdom The Emperor though determined to continue hostilities found himself incapable of supporting any military operations in Spain He therefore agreed to the evacuation of Barcelona and thus though indirectly seemed to own the title of Philip the Fifth  Hist of Europe Hist d'Angleterre Report of the secret committee c    Secret designs of the Whigs  During these advances towards a peace the parliament was prorogued from day to day The Queen daily expecting the conclusion of the treaty was willing to prevent all further animadversion on its progress from the opposing party In this state of suspence a kind of unsettled tranquillity prevailed The Whigs made in secret every preparation for opening with effect the operations of the political campaign Disappointed in their violent measures they resolved to pursue the line of opposition in a less dangerous and more legal way The jealousy which they had raised in the court of Hannover continued to distract the councils of the Electoral family Ignorant of the bigotry of the Pretender they were beyond measure alarmed at the report of his intentions to change his religion They were no strangers to the solicitations of the Tories to induce him to place himself in a way of being served in parliament Should even the report of his conversion prevail they were persuaded that a bill to repeal the act of settlement was likely to be proposed They were informed from Paris that the pretended Prince by dismissing his Popish servants was preparing for an alteration in religion They determined therefore to use every measure that prudence could suggest to defeat his designs on the British throne  Hannoverpapers    Projects of  The Baron de Grote his Electoral Highness's resident at London was directed how to proceed in this delicate affair He was desired to consult the leaders of the Whigs particularly the Lord Halifax upon the subject of proposing a bill for excluding the Pretender from the throne and his posterity even though he should become  a Protestant The house of Hannover hoped to derive a double advantage from this unnecessary project Should the act pass a material point would be gained Should the bill be opposed by the ministry that conduct would unmask them to the nation They observed as a great defect in the act of settlement that no clause was inserted for excluding the Pretender should he relinquish the Romish faith They averred that upon the slightest appearance of a feigned conversion the whole fabric which the Whigs pretended to have reared for the Princess Sophia would fall at once to the ground These fears had made so much impression that they were willing to be reconciled to the Earl of Oxford though they distrusted his principles and views The Lord Halifax who was in some degree in his confidence was requested to sound the treasurer on a point which was deemed important to the highest degree  Hannoverpapers Jan    the house of Hannover  The new act for the security of the succession was not the only subject that was to employ the embassy of Halifax to the Earl of Oxford He was desired to discover his sentiments on the subject of a pension to the Princess Sophia A provision and even a houshold to the next heir of the crown was thought neither an extravagant nor unreasonable demand In the present situation of the Elector's affairs a fresh supply of revenue was much wanted His agents every where complained of their too scanty allowance The Whigs with all their patriotism were soliciting for pensions  Ibid    Some lords who were zealous for the Protestant succession were it seems too poor to follow their consciences They had sold their votes to the ministry But they would take smaller sums from his Electoral Highness The Earl of Sunderland in his attachment to the family of Brunswick had advanced three hundred pounds to one of these poor conscientious lords  Ibid  The Earl wished to see this sum repaid Though the Elector might be willing to gratify such faithful friends he had reason to expect that they would help to serve themselves They were therefore desired to promote with all their influence the pension demanded for the Princess His Highness  was no stranger upon the present occasion either to the abilities or poverty of the Duke of Argyle The whole world knew his love of money He desired that nobleman and his brother the Earl of Ilay to promote the allowance to the Electress as they might expect good pensions to themselves from that fund  Honnoverpapers Jan    Their jealousy of the Queen and ministry  The bill for establishing the pension for the Princess Sophia was to furnish another trial of the intentions of the lordtreasurer but in the opinion of the Elector's servants no further trial was necessary They were already convinced of that minister's attachment to the Pretender Had his professions in favour of the succession been even sincere the court of Hannover concluded that he was too far engaged with France and the Queen to retreat They supposed that his prudence and even his safety dictated a firm adherence to the cause of the pretended Prince of Wales The Queen they said was too much attached to her brother to be ever brought back to proper measures  "Should Oxford attempt to change her views he must fall like Godolphin and Marlborough"  He had too much regard they thought for his own interest not to profit by the misfortunes of his predecessors He must not they thought be trusted They affirmed therefore that the friends of the succession ought to ruin his power by exposing his conduct to the nation That no measure was better calculated for this purpose than the new bill of exclusion and the pension  "But what need have we of further proofs"  they said  "We have long known that Oxford is irrecoverably devoted to the Pretender His cousin endeavoured to impose on the Electress and the Electoral Prince with empty professions of zeal But though he might deceive them his treachery could not escape the penetrating eyes of the Elector"  "Both Oxford and Bolingbroke"  says Robethon to Grote  "are inviolably attached to the Prince of Wales But the sentiments of these two JACOBITE lords ought not to be attributed to the memorial of the Baron de Bothmar  Ibid Feb  "  Elector indifferent about the succession  While his servants entertained such suspicions of the British ministry the Elector himself seems to have become  indifferent concerning the succession of his family to the throne Teazed by the unmeaning professions of the Tories and harassed by the demands of the Whigs he dropt all personal correspondence with both parties He suffered his servants to continue their intrigues in London He listened to their intelligence But to the requisitions of his Whiggish friends for money he turned a deaf ear He was however persuaded at length to order six hundred pounds to the Lord Fizwalter to enable that needy peer to repay a debt of three hundred pounds to Sunderland  Hannoverpapers Feb  He allowed forty pounds to the author of a newspaper for conveying to the public paragraphs favourable to the Protestant succession  Ibid Feb    He added ten pounds to that sum after various representations from his council and servants The difficulty with which he was brought to grant such trifles furnishes a strong proof that his Highness was either disgusted with such pitiful demands or very indifferent with regard to the throne  Marlborough a spy on the Pretender  Whilst the Elector was harassed with demands of money from London the Duke of Marlborough suggested another article of expence from his retreat at Antwerp He informed his Highness of the necessity of having a spy in the Pretender's court to observe the motions of that Prince He offered for fifty louisd'ors a month to find a proper person to execute that important service He took in the mean time a part of this necessary function upon himself  Ibid Feb  He conveyed some intelligence to the court of Hannover But his want of information seems to prove that his Grace was no longer trusted with the secrets of the excluded family The servants and the friends of the Elector were ill informed concerning the Pretender They were persuaded that he was resolved to enter into the communion of the church of England They heard that he had left all his Roman Catholic servants at St Germains when he retired to Chalons sur Marne That none but Protestants were in his train but the Earl of Middleton who had yielded to convenience more than to conviction in his conversion to the Romish faith Their sears increased in proportion to their ignorance  of the Pretender's bigotry They could not for a moment suppose that he would sacrifice his prospect of the British throne to a speculative tenet of religion  Hannoverpapers March  The excluded party in Great Britain harassed at the same time the Elector with proposals of his invading the kingdom with a body of troops They suggested that should the Dutch refuse a squadron of men of war some ships of force might be obtained from Denmark But the Elector rejected the scheme as utterly improper as well as impracticable  Ibid March    Secret views of the Pretender and of the treasurer  During these intrigues on the part of the court of Hannover the agents of the Pretender were equally busy and still more anxious in their negociations and intrigues He himself had retired from St Germains in the preceding summer Having obtained a safeconduct from the Emperor and the Duke of Lorrain he now resided at Bar Though he entertained suspicions of the Earl of Oxford upon much better grounds than the house of Hannover he built much on the affections of the Queen and the zeal of the Tories The lordtreasurer however broke artfully the designs of the first He frustrated the schemes of the latter by dividing their councils While the Dukes of Shrewsberry and Buckingham remained in the cabinetcouncil he deemed justly that the Protestant succession was in danger But he had removed the first by appointing him ambassador to France The second was broken with infirmities and weighed down with years Oxford endeavoured in the mean time to gain the most moderate Whigs He laid schemes for obtaining a moderate parliament The sheriffs pricked for the counties were of the lowchurch party He endeavoured to impress the electors with the necessity of chusing such representatives as should favour the succession in the Protestant line Though he was on the point of losing the Tories by this conduct he was so unfortunate as not to gain the Whigs While he made the most vehement professions to the Electoral family they were firmly persuaded that he was an obstinate and determined Jacobite Though he was courted by the Pretender that Prince knew him to be an inflexible Whig  Peace of Utrecht  These secret intrigues on both sides fill a period remarkable for no public transaction The parliament continued to be prorogued as the tedious negociations at Utrecht had not yet been brought to a close Great Britain who first began the negociation was destined to conclude the treaty The Duke of Shrewsberry and the Marquis de Torcy settled the plan of a general peace at Paris which a courier carried to Utrecht in the middle of March The Portuguese and Dutch had already agreed to put an end to their part of the war Others prepared to follow their example On the twentyseventh of March the lord privyseal and the Earl of Stafford acquainted the ministers of the allies that they had appointed the thirtyfirst for signing a treaty of peace and one of commerce between the Queen of Great Britain and France They requested therefore the plenipotentiaries of the confederates to be prepared at the same time to sign their respective treaties The conditions of peace to be allowed to the Emperor and the Empire had been settled by the Queen of Great Britain and the French King These were delivered in form to the Count Zinzendorff his Imperial Majesty's minister But the Emperor yielding to his resentment resolved to continue the war The British and French plenipotentiaries were the first who signed for their respective sovereigns Their example was followed in the space of a few hours by the minister of the Duke of Savoy and by those of Portugal and Prussia The States were the last who signed the treaty the French plenipotentiaries having insisted that the ministers of such Princes as their master had acknowledged as Kings should take place of

March has been stigmatized as disgrace  by the most of those writers who have recorded the eve  of the times The great success and enormous expen  of the war could suggest no demands that were not likely to be granted by an enemy reduced to the last extremity The French nation unsuccessful in all their efforts were broken by disasters Their sovereign destitute of resources for action became timid and undecisive in his counsels He had implored the pity of the confederates in a manner that by exposing his own weakness contributed to augment their demands Instead of deriving spirit from indignation and despair the court of Versailles yielded to those unmanly complaints that deprive even misfortune itself of regret In this untoward state of their affairs the fate of the house of Bourbon depended upon the Queen of Great Britain and as the humanity which ought ever to be extended to private distress is frequently sacrificed to utility in public transactions she could scarce be blamed for making a more rigorous use of the advantages which fortune had placed in her hands  and reflections  But though more splendid conditions might certainly have been obtained the peace of Utrecht was neither dishonourable nor disadvantageous Great Britain it is true bore the greatest part of the weight of the war But she was manifestly the sole arbitress of peace She imposed terms on the victors as well as on the vanquished Without gratifying the pride of France she checked the insolence of the confederates She favoured those the most who first acquiesced in the plan she proposed She treated with neglect or punished with disappointment such as were either obstinate or slow The advantages which she obtained for herself though neither adequate to her victories nor her expence were solid and even splendid She secured the dominion of the Mediterranean by obtaining Gibraltar and Minorca She strengthened her limits and extended her dominions  America She forced France to relinquish all preten  ons to New soundland to cede Hudson's Bay and to  eld St Christopher's She obliged the French King  acknowledge the Protestant succession and to cease  protect and even to abandon the Pretender She re  ed him to the humiliating necessity of destroying  unkirk whose very ruins were to remain as a mo  ment of his disgrace As the last triumph over  pride she terrified him into the greatest concessions  to the Duke of Savoy whom of all the allies he hated the most  on the peace of Utrecht  With regard to the confederates the most of them were highly satisfied and none had any great reason to complain The King of Prussia obtained all his demands The Duke of Savoy was recompensed beyond his most sanguine hopes He had obtained the cession of Savoy the district of Nice with all that he had received in Italy from the Emperor Leopold He was raised to the regal title and to the throne of Sicily and he was eventually to succeed to the crown of Spain in default of Philip the Fifth and his issuemale The King of Portugal had contributed little to the carrying on of the war and his demands from the peace were few and without hesitation granted Luxembourg Namur Charleroi together with the other cities already in their possession were given as a barrier to the States Their commerce with France was placed on the foundation established by the tariff of With regard to the Empire the Rhine was to form its limits on the side of France All fortifications either possessed or raised by the French beyond that river were to be restored to the Emperor or destroyed The kingdom of Naples and the dutchy of Milan were ceded for ever to his Imperial Majesty and the rest of the dominions of Italy that had changed masters in the course of the war were to return to their former sovereigns There was a considerable difference it must be confessed between these terms and those offered by France in the year But a change of circumstances may justify an alteration of sentiments Without abandoning the project of reducing the too great power of the house of Bourbon the British ministry might allege that there was an equal necessity for prescribing limits to the vast claims of the family of Austria  Perilous situation of the Earl of Oxford  The lordtreasurer obtained a triumph over his enemies by concluding the treaty of Utrecht But he still stood upon very dangerous ground Distrusted equally by both sides he was destitute of friends and his whole security rested in the implacable jealousy of the two parties who were alike his enemies In this tottering situation he endeavoured to support himself by flattering the Tories in private and by taking publickly the ground of the Whigs In the political farce he was in some  measure the sole actor and the populace were the spectators who were to decide his merit and even his fate To the common people the appeal of the rivals for power had been made for many years The terrors of the vulgar for Popery and their principles in favour of the Protestant religion had been the great support of the established form of government The bulk of the nation were hitherto favourable to the ministry To retain their confidence was a matter of the last importance to the Earl of Oxford as by the triennial act the present parliament was near its end The Whigs to influence the approaching elections had propagated with more assiduity than success an opinion that the Queen and her servants were irrecoverably in the interest of the Pretender To prevent the bad consequences of this dangerous impression was a measure of necessity and it employed the whole attention of the leaders of the Tories  He is hated by both parties  The boldest and the least politic proposed the passing of a septennial bill as the best and most decisive means of securing the continuance of their own power  Stuartpapers  The lordtreasurer was too timid or perhaps too prudent to follow their advice He perceived that a measure so unpopular would deprive him of the support of the vulgar and place an uncontrolable power in the hands of the highflying Tories The cabinetcouncil were his enemies He knew that the most vehement of those who supported his measures in the two houses wished only for the continuance of their present influence in parliament That should they attain their purpose they would be willing to join with his avowed enemies the Whigs and to send him to the Tower  Ibid Feb  To amuse the Jacobites he admitted the agents of the Pretender into his conversation and privacy  Ibid Feb  He endeavoured to persuade them that all his measures tended to the accomplishment of their wishes and views But he had the misfortune to be as little believed by the excluded family as he was by the legal heirs of the crown His caution his slow measures his mysterious character were by no means calculated to create in others any confidence in his conduct His only hold of his power was  the ascendant which he obtained over the Queen By terrifying that timid Princess with reports of danger and by insinuating artfully that she could be safe only in his own hands he reduced her into a state of dependence on himself and generally subservient to all his designs  MSS passim    His secret views and intrigues  In one important instance her habitual obedience to the minister is said to have yielded to her prejudices To secure himself with the populace the lordtreasurer resolved to take the ground of the Whigs The danger of the Protestant succession from the Queen and her servants had been long a favourite topic with that party They were at great pains to inform the public that the courts of London and Hannover were upon the very worst terms Though this was a notorious fact they had hitherto found it difficult to persuade the populace on that head To remove every impression of this kind the minister formed a design of inducing the Queen to assure her parliament in her speech from the throne that the utmost harmony subsisted between her and the presumptive heirs of her crown He even attempted to reconcile the Jacobites to the propriety of this measure He told them that should the house of Hannover upon these assurances desert the Whigs that party who were ready to sacrifice their professed principles to their passions would declare for the Pretender That this circumstance would ruin their importance with the populace and enable the real friends of the excluded Prince to secure for him the succession  Stuartpapers March    The Queen averse from the house of Hannover  Though the adherents of the Pretender were too zealous and sanguine to be incredulous they gave little faith to the assurances of the Earl of Oxford  Ibid  But though they relied in nothing upon his attachment to their cause they affected to place the utmost confidence in his measures The Queen however was not so easily won to his project of assuring the nation of her zeal for the Protestant succession Either from a returning affection for her own family or rendered averse from the interests o  the presumptive heirs of the crown by the intrigues o  their agents in London she for some time refused to  make any mention at all of the house of Hannover in her speech  Hannoverpapers May  The lordtreasurer made the strongest representations against this unexpected resolution He applied to her prudence He alarmed her fears He told her that the safety of her government and perhaps of her person depended upon her quieting the minds of people with regard to the Protestant succession That her silence upon the present occasion would confirm the reports industriously spread by the Whigs That by expressing zeal for the family of Hannover she would defeat the designs of their adherents and that by taking the only ground upon which the Whigs fortified themselves against her authority she would reap all the benefit of their situation and ensure to her servants every advantage in the approaching elections  Ibid    April th Her speech to her parliament  Swayed by these arguments or yielding to her own fears the Queen at length consented She opened the session of parliament on the ninth of April with a speech from the throne She informed the two houses that the negociations of peace were brought to a happy conclusion She mentioned what she had done for the security of the Protestant succession She expressed her hopes that the perfect friendship which subsisted between her and the house of Hannover would effectually disappoint such persons as made a merit of separating their interests She demanded of the commons the necessary supplies She earnestly recommended the cultivating of the arts of peace as the best means for repairing the losses sustained by the enormous expence of the war She complained of the licence of the press and the dangerous growth of the impious practice of duelling She mentioned the necessity of restraining both these evils with new laws as the old were inadequate to that salutary purpose She left she said the force necessary for the protection of the nation to the wisdom of her parliament As for herself she wanted no protection but the loyalty of her people no guarantee but the interest she had in their hearts Having recommended unanimity in their councils and requested them to use their endeavours to calm the minds of her people she concluded with a reflection on the  partyrage which had so long disturbed the repose of her kingdom  Journals April th    The Whigs disconcerted  This judicious speech disconcerted the Whigs in all their projects In the house of commons an address of thanks was voted with but one dissenting voice  Stuartpapers  It was carried with a great majority in the house of lords  against  Disappointed in their public exhibitions the party had recourse to their secret intrigues Sunderland Orford Townshend Halifax Somers Cowper and the LordChiefJustice Parker consulted together for two days  Hannoverpapers  But they could contrive no probable means for preventing the Lordtreasurer's designs The Lords Townshend and Halisax went twice in the name of the rest to Kreyenberg the Hannoverian resident They affirmed that the Queen's speech had given a fatal blow to the influence of the Whigs and the Protestant succession That the authority of the Sovereign had overturned all the designs of their party That the nation gave implicit credit to the Queen and construed into partyrage all insinuations against the existence of a perfect friendship between her and the court of Hannover That the Elector only could undeceive the people That therefore a decisive step was necessary otherwise the interests of his family and the hopes of his friends would be for ever lost  Ibid April    Their intrigues with the Hannoverian resident  In this distressful situation they implored Kreyenberg to lay their humble solicitations at the feet of the Elector They entreated his Highness for the sake of God  Hannoverpapers  to send over the Electoral Prince Without the presence of one of the family they solemnly averred that the succession must inevitably be defeated This request they had frequently made to no purpose before the meeting of parliament They now renewed their entreaties with more confidence as their own condition was more helpless and the juncture itself more favourable They desired the Prince to take advantage of the Queen's declaration To feign to believe her sincere and to come under pretence of returning thanks in person They said that without his presence they could move nothing  effectually in parliament That they could not even mention the pension expected for the Princess Sophia That the only question of party they could propose was the removal of the Pretender from Lorrain "But" say they  "if the Electoral family shall not interfere decisively the Earl of Oxford will save us the trouble of that motion He has gained the people by the artifice of the Queen's speech He will also succeed in the approaching elections and establish the Pretender in the kingdom as the eventual successor to the throne  Hannoverpapers    Proceedings of the commons  While the Whigs were thus disconcerted the ministry carried all their measures with little opposition in parliament Though no communication of the treaty had been made to the two houses they had returned general thanks for the peace The commons granted the demanded supplies  Journals April  They reduced the troops and navy according to the directions of the court They gained the army by allowing halfpay to the officers They secured their influence with their constituents by reducing the landtax to two shillings in the pound In the midst of this attention to the nation they shewed their attachment to the ministry The commissioners for examining the accounts of the army made a report that bore hard on former mismanagements Some instances of corruption and embezzlement of public money were detected But it soon appeared that the house was more eager to expose the enemies of the prevailing party than to punish the guilty One William Churchill a member was slightly censured A vote was passed against the Earl of Wharton for having sold an office for a thousand pounds But as this instance of corruption happened before the act of general pardon the house took advantage of that circumstance and resolved to proceed no farther in the matter  May    Treaty of commerce before the house  This appearance of unanimity in the house of commons was soon interrupted by an important debate Though the terms of the treaty had not hitherto been communicated to parliament the proclamation of the peace on the fifth of May had been attended with the loudest acclamations of the populace The nation in general  were highly pleased that a period was put to a war whose excessive weight had rendered them insensible to its renown The treaty which settled the cession of territories between her Britannic Majesty and the French King was accompanied by a treaty of commerce between Great Britain and France The ratifications of the two treaties had been exchanged at Utrecht on the twentyeighth of April On the ninth of May Mr Benson chancellor of the exchequer delivered to the commons a message from the Queen She informed the house that though it was the undoubted prerogative of the crown to make peace and war she had resolved from the beginning to communicate to her parliament the treaties she had now concluded  Journals May th  The house appointed the fourteenth of May for resolving themselves into a grand committee to consider the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of navagation and commerce A conversation rather than a debate passed between the parties on the treaty of peace The Whigs found in the treaty of commerce the best ground for opposing the court with any prospect of success  Arguments for and against it  When the house met on the fourteenth of May a motion was made to bring in a bill to make good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of commerce A violent debate arose between the friends of the minister and the leaders of the Whigs The first endeavoured to prove that a great advantage would result to the nation from a free commerce with France The latter affirmed that a trade with that kingdom would prove extremely prejudicial to the woollen silk and paper manufactories and above all to the commerce with Portugal which brought annually so much bullion into the kingdom The friends of the ministry deduced their arguments from an enumeration of the vast quantities of British commodities exported to France before the two last wars The Whigs averred that since the Revolution the state of commerce was entirely changed That France had set up and encouraged woollen manufactures of her own That Britain had learned in the course of so many years to accommodate herself without the product of France  That the French having the work performed for les  money could sell their goods at a cheaper rate That  should Britain even be capable of balancing her own trade with France she could not prevent the latter kingdom from engrossing the commerce of other countries That the increase of the trade to Portugal the most valuable branch of British commerce was owing to the high duties which amounted to a kind of prohibition of French wines That should the duties on these wines be reduced to an equality with those on the wines of Portugal the trade with that kingdom would be lost as men in general would prefer the wines of France when they could be purchased at the same rate  Debates printed    Bill concerning it rejected  The adherents of the ministry advanced arguments equally solid and conclusive But when parties are inflamed against each other passion decides in the place of reason Upon a division of the house the bill was ordered to be introduced by a great majority  against  The Whigs adhering to their purpose of distressing the minister called the prejudices of the nation to their aid They carried their arguments to the press The lordtreasurer opposed them on the same ground But the fate of the bill was not ultimately determined by this public contest Many of the Tories to the last degree offended at the trimming conduct of the Earl of Oxford had resolved to join the Whigs on the present occasion to accomplish his ruin Sir Thomas Hanmer though he had been instrumental in concluding the treaty of commerce opposed it with vehemence as the best ground for affronting the lordtreasurer He was at the head of a society of forty members of the house of commons who called themselves the Octoberclub This junto resolved to throw their whole weight in the scale of the opposing party and to terrify the Earl of Oxford into decisive measures for the Pretender They had frequently requested him in vain to remove the Whigs from the lieutenancy of the counties the commissions of the peace and the offices of the revenue He had repeatedly made the most solemn promises upon this subject But though the dissolution of parliament was approaching he had hitherto done nothing in an affair upon which the success of the Tories at the new elections so much depended  Stuartpapers June  When therefore the bill was brought to a debate the most violent of  the Tories led by Hanmer opposed its being engrossed and upon a division of the house carried their point by a majority of nine votes  against    Discontents of the Scots  During the dependence of this bill another matter of still greater importance employed the attention of parliament The house of commons in renewing the duty on malt for another year extended that tax to Scotland The members for that part of the kingdom unanimously opposed the measure They complained that the duty in itself too great a burden for their country was contrary to an express article of the Union between the kingdoms That it had been stipulated by that treaty that no duty should be laid on malt in NorthBritain during the continuance of the war That though hostilities had ceased no formal peace was yet concluded with Spain That though a pacification between the two crowns was no longer a matter of uncertainty yet it was a maxim in law that odious things were to be literally understood but that matters of favour were to be interpreted with more liberality That as the tax itself was by the express words of the bill to be applied to deficiencies in the war this act laid an impost on the Scots from which they were evidently exempted by the treaty of Union  Burnet vol iv  These arguments made a great impression on the house but on a division a majority appeared on the side of the bill The Scotish members in both houses of parliament were so much offended that they met at a tavern and having appointed two lords and two commoners to wait in their name upon the Queen they requested her permission for bringing in a bill for the dissolution of the Union  MSS passim    Character of the Duke of Argyle  Though the Queen expressed the greatest uneasiness at the address of the Scots they resolved to proceed in their intended motion Several of the Jacobite part of the Tories entered with eagerness into a measure which was well calculated to distress the Earl of Oxford The Whigs for the like reason were ready to throw their weight into the same scale But the person who animated the whole opposition on this subject was the Duke of Argyle This nobleman espousing the principles  or passions of his family had uniformly professed his attachment to the Protestant succession and his consequent aversion to a minister who was deemed to favour the Pretender Careless and eager in his disposition he neither concealed his resentment nor disguised his designs With a commanding manner which stamped his very forwardness with an appearance of authority he was feared by many but beloved by none Brave in his person but not remarkable for his conduct he might be considered in his military capacity as a bold partizan rather than a judicious commander In his civil character his fire degenerated into a violence that often defeated his views In his public exhibitions in parliament he was rather spirited than eloquent better calculated to terrify his enemies than to support his friends His great defect was a love of money and emolument which he could not effectually conceal with all the efforts of his pride  Hannover and Stuartpapers  His chief talent was an address in managing the prejudices of the vulgar He marked their opinions as they changed and fell dextrously down with the tide  Motion for dissolving the Union  The Earl of Oxford no stranger to the importance of the Duke of Argyle had resolved to gain him by promises of advantage His object was to place him as a kind of spy upon the Whigs and to terrify upon occasion that party by his means  Stuartpapers  But the Duke declined to enter into the views of the minister till he should obtain the office of mastergeneral of the ordnance vacant by the death of the Duke of Hamilton The lordtreasurer was unwilling to trust a place of such importance in the hands of a man whom interest only could gain to his side Disappointment heightened the Duke's resentment He resolved to gain by force what he could not obtain by favour He opposed the court with vehemence He treated the minister with insult He therefore entered with great zeal into the counsels of his countrymen for the dissolution of the union between the two kingdoms To carry a point of such great importance was likely to introduce a confusion into the measures of government that would prove fatal to the power of the Earl of Oxford  The resentment of the most violent Jacobites kept pace with the warmth and vehemence of the Whigs Both resolved to ruin the lordtreasurer as each looked upon him in the light of an enemy They flattered therefore the prejudices and fomented the resentment of the Scotish members  MSS    rejected by a small majority  On the first of June the Earl of Finlater having recounted in the house of lords the various grievances resulting to the Scotish nation from the Union concluded with a motion for dissolving that treaty Finlater was seconded by the Earl of Mar The debate became general on this important subject But the force of argument was less apparent on both sides than the irreconcilable spirit of the two parties The violence of Argyle against the Earl of Oxford was ultimately serviceable to that minister at the same time that it contributed to defeat his own designs The Duke having in the course of the debate mentioned with the utmost contempt the Pretender offended some lords who secretly favoured his cause Though they were willing to humble the Earl of Oxford they were averse from the principles of his more open enemies Two bishops in particular who possessed between them three proxies by quitting the house  MSS passim  carried five votes from the Scots and Whigs When the question for bringing in the bill was put it was carried in the negative by a majority of four voices A circumstance which preserved the kingdom from confusion was highly favourable to the Earl of Oxford Had the motion been carried in the affirmative it was to have been followed by another for sending the treasurer to the Tower  Ibid Hannover and Stuartpapers  The Scots disappointed by their want of success and incensed by the speech of Argyle fell again into the views of the court Thus the precipitate zeal of one of their own number prevented the Whigs from regaining the power that had been so long the sole object of their intrigues and desire  Lord treasurer terrified  The desertion of his friends upon the treaty of commerce and the motion for dissolving the Union threw the Earl of Oxford into a kind of political despair He saw that he was hated by the Tories at the same time that  he was proscribed by the Whigs The irreconcilable animosity of the two parties had been hitherto the only support of his power The predominancy of either was to him alike destructive His prudence was now in arms against his principles The most direct way to preserve his authority was to gratify the more violent Tories by abetting the views of the Pretender But even that obvious path was beset with difficulties and dangers Should his measures assume the appearance of Jacobitism the jealousy of the people against Popery might throw them into the scale of the Whigs To retain the favour of the populace was now as necessary as to regain the support of the Tories He had therefore recourse to the old expedient of giving private assurances to the Jacobites while he marked his public conduct with a zeal for the house of Hannover Though this artifice was too stale to deceive the Tories the Whigs shewed such an intemperate joy for their success in the affair of the treaty of commerce that the former resolved to support a minister they hated to exclude a party whom they had great reason to fear  MSS passim    Proceedings of parliament  Impressed with this opinion such Tories as had opposed the treaty of commerce endeavoured to give a proof of their resolution to change their conduct Sir Thomas Hanmer by whose influence the bill was rejected moved for a palliative address to the Queen approving of the treaties of peace and commerce His motion was carried by a great majority  against  The Queen's answer was full of art and address She thanked the commons for their approbation of the treaty of commerce She stated its advantages and the great difficulties with which it had been obtained The treasurer by this victory over his enemies became more important in the eyes of his party and supposed friends He resolved to profit by their zeal On the twentyfifth of June a message from the Queen was presented to the commons by the chancellor of the Exchequer This message imported that the civil list prior to the year when the late changes in the ministry happened had run greatly in arrear That her Majesty therefore requested the house to enable her to raise a sum sufficient to pay her debts upon the funds of the civil list As the message contained a kind of reflection  upon the former ministry the consequent motion was opposed with great vehemence by the Whigs But they found upon this occasion that their late triumphs were not owing to themselves A bill empowering the Queen to raise five hundred and ten thousand pounds for the payment of the debts of the civil list passed the house by a great majority The Whigs complained that advantage had been taken of the absence of many of their party who had retired into the country when the business of the treaty of commerce was finished  Journals Burnet vol iv    Address for removing the Pretender  The Whigs sensible of their own inferiority had hitherto declined to make any of the motions in parliament that had been recommended to their party by the court of Hannover  Hannoverpapers  The bill for excluding the Pretender should he turn Protestant was neglected as either useless or dangerous The pension to the Princess Sophia was not proposed though the success of that measure might have furnished the Elector with an opportunity of enabling some NEEDY LORDS  Hannoverpapers  to follow their conscience To shew their attachment to the Protestant succession or more probably to harass the Queen and her ministry who were considered as averse from the house of Hannover the Whigs resolved to move for an address that the most pressing instances should be used with the Duke of Lorrain to remove from his dominions the Pretender to the crown of Great Britain This motion was opposed in the house of lords by none but the Lord North The commons voted the address without one dissenting voice This spirit of compliance defeated the views of the Whigs They hoped that their political enemies would have the imprudence to outvote them in their motion That this circumstance would to use their own expression  Ibid  open the eyes of the nation That the mob who had hitherto supported their antagonists would change sides or at least entertain such jealousies of the Tories as might be hurtful to that party in the approaching elections for a new parliament  Ibid    Parliament prorogued  The address for the removal of the Pretender concluded all business of importance in the present session On the sixteenth of July the Queen prorogued the parliament  with a speech from the throne She thanked in a particular manner the commons for the supplies by which they had amply provided for the public service She hoped at the next meeting the affair of commerce would be so well understood that the advantageous conditions obtained from France might be rendered effectual to her people by law She expressed how sensible she was of the affection zeal and duty of the commons She recounted their former services She enlarged upon their late favours She acknowledged her gratitude for their having furnished her with supplies for continuing the war and for strengthening her hands in obtaining peace She said that at her coming to the crown she found a war prepared to her hands That God had blessed her arms with many victories in that war which she had improved by procuring an advantageous and honourable peace She requested her parliament to make the people sensible of what they had gained by the late treaties She entreated them to remove the groundless jealousies which had been so industriously raised to prevent all unhappy divisions that might not only weaken but even endanger the advantages which she had obtained for her kingdoms  "There are some very few I hope"  she said  "who will never be satisfied with any government Shew therefore your love for your country by obviating the malice of the illminded and by undeceiving the deluded Nothing can establish peace at home nothing recover the disorders that happened during the war but a steady adherence to the constitution in church and state None but such as are true to these principles can be trusted They have the best title to my favour as I have neither interest nor aim but to secure the religion of my country and the liberty of my people  Journals July  "  Whigs displeased at the Queen's speech  The Queen pronounced this speech with a kind of energy and vehemence that sufficiently shewed the sentiments were her own  Publications of the Times Burnet vol iv  The enemies of the ministry were loud in their complaints against the reflections thrown from such a height on themselves It was strange they said that the Queen who confessedly knew nothing of trade  Ibid  should pass a censure on her  parliament for rejecting the treaty of commerce They made exceptions against the expression that she found a war prepared to her hands as an insult upon the memory of the late King They observed that in the whole speech no mention was made of the Pretender none of the Protestant succession But they were most offended at the contempt with with which she treated the opposing party and the impression which she gave to the nation of their conduct and views The adherents of the Whigs carried their arguments and complaints to the press The Tories and the ministry descended to meet their adversaries in the same field The nation was overwhelmed with essays papers and pamphlets Assertions without proof were on both sides improved into facts and a suspicious people were rendered unhappy by the artifice and clamour of contending knaves The object of the two parties was the sameThe parliament was dissolved and each endeavoured to serve themselves with the people in the approaching elections  Intrigues and dissensions in the cabinet  The speech that gave so much offence to the Whigs seems to have been fabricated without the advice of the Earl of Oxford Though he was the ostensible minister he guided no longer the cabinet When he was in a manner proscribed by the two contending parties in parliament he was violently attacked in the closet The Viscount Bolingbroke who had from the beginning traversed his measures had long fixed his eyes upon his power Having gained the Lady Masham by gratifying her passion for the public money he insinuated himself into the favour of the Queen by entering without hesitation into all her prejudices The lordtreasurer was equally hated by both the great parties The Whigs pretended that he did too much the violent Tories found that he had done nothing for the Pretender His manner and his opinions were alike disgustful to both sides  With a shew of application to business he never brough  affairs to a period He heard representations with an ap+pearance of attention but his answers were slight un+decisive and vague The Viscount Bolingbroke yield+ing to his own intemperate ambition or the natural vio+lence of his character despised Oxford and thwarte  his designs When a division happened among the To+ries before the beginning of the last session he endea+voured  to place himself at the head of an independent party  Oxford to Queen Anne June  The mortifications which the treasurer experienced proceeded from the machinations of his rival more than from the inveteracy of his enemies The treaty of commerce must be reprobated as it was THEN supported by the Earl of Oxford and a breach upon the union of the two kingdoms was encouraged as it was likely to prove fatal to his power  MSS passim    Secret cabals and  During these intrigues in the cabinet the Whigs continued their own secret cabals In their eagerness for power they persuaded themselves that the Protestant succession was in danger They continued their solicitations to the Elector of Brunswick to send to Great Britain the Electoral Prince They had represented in the strongest and most decisive terms that the Queen and her servants were irrecoverably attached to the Pretender They threw his Highness in the affair of the Succession into a despondence that degenerated into a kind of despair He became careless and indifferent about a throne which was represented so difficult to ascend To humour however those who called themselves his friends he agreed at length to send his brother Duke Ernest to Great Britain The Whigs disappointed by this proposal formed an opinion that his Highness was jealous of the influence which might be acquired by his son in Great Britain They requested him therefore to come in person But he absolutely refused to comply with a demand that seemed at once impracticable in itself and inconsistent with his own dignity  Hannoverpapers    intrigues of the Whigs  Though the backwardness of the Elector threw a damp on his party his servants continued with a degree of eagerness a correspondence with the Whigs His Highness having positively declared that he would not risk an expedition into Britain in a hostile manner prior to the Queen's death his ministers had begun to take precautions in expectation of that event They had sent early in the year several queries to the leaders of the Whigs The answers which were to form the line of their conduct were given by the lords Somers Cowper and Halifax They declared that no commission  granted either by the Princess Sophia or the Elector could be valid should these be signed and executed during the Queen's life They declined for themselves to act upon authorities neither established by precedents nor appointed by law The Duke of Marlborough and General Cadogan who signified their inclination to have the eventual command of the troops were not so scrupulous They declared that a writing in French without any adherence to forms would be sufficient That the authority of the Duke of Marlborough was so great among the soldiers that any piece of parchment was enough to ensure their obedience to his command As for Cadogan he wished only for a show of authority to take possession of the Tower or to place himself in conjunction with the Electoral Prince at the head of the British troops that still lay in garrison in some cities in Flanders  Hannover papers passim    They demand money in vain from the Elector  The Whigs had in the beginning of the year harassed the Elector with demands of pensions for poor lords They had perpetually teazed his Highness for money to political writers and for spies planted round the Pretender Though their solicitations on these subjects had been attended with little success they continued to make applications of the same disagreeable kind When the session was drawing to a conclusion and a dissolution was foreseen they demanded one hundred thousand pounds from the Elector to corrupt boroughs to influence the elections and to return men of constitutional and Whiggish principles to the ensuing parliament  Ibid  The magnitude of the sum left no room for hesitation in rejecting their request One repulse however was not sufficient either to intimidate or discourage a party so eager in the pursuit of their designs They diminished their demand to fifty thousand pounds The Elector plainly told them that he could not spare the money That he had done the greatest service consistent with his own particular situation and the state of Europe in general to the well affected in Great Britain That he had engaged the Emperor and Empire to continue the war against France That he employed seventeen thousand of his troops against that kingdom That this circumstance had deprived the French King of the power of sending an army into Great  Britain with the Pretender That could he even advance the money which was far from being the case the secret could never be kept and that a discovery might be dangerous from the offence that the measure was likely to give to the British nations  Hannoverpapers July    Situation and views of the Pretender  During these intrigues for the Protestant succession the Pretender lived in great security at Barleduc under the protection of the Duke of Lorrain Though he had declined to change his religion at the solicitation of his adherents his servants were almost all of the Protestant persuasion The Earl of Middleton who had yielded to policy more than conviction his former system of faith was the only Roman Catholic of any consequence in his train  Ibid  A clergyman of the church of England had come from Britain at his desire to exercise the functions of his order in his family  Stuartpapers  In daily expectation of a change in his favour he declined all correspondence except such as solely conveyed intelligence of the state of opinions and the secret intrigues in government The same distrust of the lord treasurer that prevailed at Hannover was entertained with much more reason at Barleduc But both agreed in the opinion that his own safety would at length induce the Earl of Oxford to throw himself in the scale of the Pretender The adherents of that Prince placed however their greatest hopes in the inclinations of Queen Anne They knew that an interior cabinet was formed in opposition to the trimming conduct of the lord treasurer That Bolingbroke who had long hated that nobleman had flattered the prejudices of the Queen and her favourite to ruin the minister That the latter had applied to the principal Whigs for protection against his colleagues in office  Ibid  That the Whigs had rejected his supplications and that he was thrown into political despair The Jacobites therefore hoped to derive from his situation an aid which they could not expect from his principles  Ibid    Whigs encourage the Emperor to continue the war  The Whigs in their eagerness for power and office had extended their intrigues to the councils of foreign powers Their expectations and their fears for themselves had induced them to flatter the Emperor and Empire  to the continuance of an unequal war They insinuated through the court of Hannover that one of two events very likely soon to arise would turn the balance against the house of Bourbon That should the Queen already manifestly near her end happen to die the war would be instantly renewed by Great Britain under the Electoral family That in case of the demise of Lewis the Fourteenth who was now broken with infirmities and age France by falling under the dominion of a minor would be rendered incapable to defend herself and much less would she be able to keep Philip the Fifth on the throne of Spain That the house of Austria might recover a crown of which they had been unjustly deprived by the timidity and sinister designs of the British ministry whose power was to expire with the life of the Queen That to accomplish this great design nothing was necessary but to remain on the defensive on the Rhine That to make conquests was of much less importance than to maintain the show of war and that even slight disasters might be of service as they would contribute to alarm the British nation by the progress made by the arms of France  Stuart and Hannoverpapers passim    Campaign of  The ambition of Charles the Sixth coinciding with the representation of the Whigs and the court of Hannover he resolved to prosecute the war Foreseeing the event that deprived him of the aid of his allies he had accommodated the differences which had long subsisted between his family and the malecontents in Hungary Preliminary articles containing a general amnesty on both sides had been followed by a formal treaty The famous Ragotski disappointed in his views had fled to Poland and twentytwo regiments of Hungarians taking the oaths to the Emperor passed into his army The Prince of Savoy commanded the Imperialists When he was making preparations for passing with great caution the Rhine he was suddenly stopt by the approach of a superior force under the Mareschal de Villars The French had acquired their usual confidence by the desertion of the maritime powers from the grand confederacy They took Worms Spire Keiserlauter and other places with little resistance They invested and  took the important fortress of Landau Villars having formed greater designs forced the passage of the Rhine attacked and defeated the General Vaubonne in his intrenchments and took Fribourg before the end of the campaign The Emperor unwilling to continue a disastrous war began seriously to wish for peace Conferences that afterwards terminated in a treaty were accordingly opened at Rastadt betwen the Prince of Savoy and the Mareschal de Villars  Hist d'Allemagne tom vii    A ferment in England  During these transactions abroad riot clamour and confusion prevailed at home The Queen having dissolved the parliament  Annals of Queen Anne MSS passim  in terms of the triennial act the two parties took the field To influence the elections they had long carried their disputes to the press Each endeavoured by their writers to impose upon a credulous multitude Positive assertions were advanced according to custom as facts and declamation was substituted in the place of argument The Whigs disappointed in their expectations of money from Hannover had endeavoured to gain the mob of London through their habitual prejudices against the French The terrors from the Pretender were inculcated in vain against the positive assurances of the Queen in favour of the Protestant succession The imprudence and inattention of the Duke d'Aumont the French ambassador had furnished the discontented with an opportunity of inflaming the populace against his nation and consequently against the ministry To gain popularity that minister had upon his entrance into London strewed whole handfuls of silver coin among the rabble Their acclamations ended with his generosity The crowds whom their avarice had assembled before his house disappointed in their expectations gave free vent to their aversion to France and Popery They were easily induced to connect the interests of the Pretender with the objects of d'Aumont's embassy and thus the Whigs contrived to instill a jealousy into the populace to favour their own interests in the general elections  Riotous behaviour of the Scots  The ferment raised in England by the general elections extended itself to Scotland with equal violence The  Whigs as well as the Tories in that part of the kingdom were averse from the minister The first were offended at his opposing with such success the breaking of the union The latter could not forgive his slow councils in favour of the Pretender The Scotish Jacobites with their usual vehemence carried their zeal into folly and imprudence Some boroughs were induced by their suggestions to address the Queen upon the hereditary descent of the crown Whole societies as well as individuals celebrated the birthday of the Chevalier de St George and drank his health at their entertainments and carousals Lockhart of Carnwath an avowed Jacobite was unanimously chosen member for Edinburgh A great number of the inhabitants upon this occasion signed a petition to be presented to the house of commons for the bringing in a bill to dissolve the Union The populace having assembled round the statue of Charles the Second in the parliamentclose drank attended with the loudest shouts of joy health to the Queen the dissolution of the Union and the hereditary descent of the crown They adjourned in the same riotous mood to the marketcross and filled the whole city with treasonable acclamations and noise  Publications of the Times    Affairs of Ireland  Ireland could not be supposed to remain free from the confusion which prevailed in every corner of Great Britain The Duke of Shrewsberry was appointed lordlieutenant and he arrived at Dublin in the month of October  Oct  Though his Grace had uniformly passed for a staunch friend to the Revolution  Hi  +tories and publications of the Times  he owed his present preferment to the minister's certain knowledge of his Jacobitism  Stuartpapers  The Earl of Oxford thwarted in the cabinet by Shrewsberry's zeal for the Pretender had wished for his removal from the kingdom He had sent him with this design ambassador to France from which kingdom his Grace had returned in the month of August The lordtreasurer found more difficulty in per+suading Shrewsberry to accept of the government o  Ireland The former however was assisted in his schem  by his rival the Viscount Bolingbroke That Lord  having long formed the design of placing himself in conjunction with the lordchancellor at the head of the highchurch party became as jealous of Shrewsberry as of Oxford  MSS passim  He therefore found means through the Lady Masham to prevail with the Duke to accept of a government more honourable in itself than important in the great line of public affairs  Duke of Shrewsberry lord lieutonant  The Duke of Shrewsberry upon his arrival at Dublin found the city in a ferment concerning the election of a lord mayor The Whigs and Jacobites carried their contest on this subject to a degree of violence little short of frenzy The latter were supported with great zeal and address by Sir Constantine Phipps lordchancellor of the kingdom who was at no pains to conceal his attachment to the Pretender and his cause The Duke of Shrewsberry profited by the violence of Phipps He concealed with success his own principles in favour of the hereditary descent of the crown He averred in public that he was still the same he was in the year He drank with an appearance of zeal to the pious memory of King William though it is well known he deserted the cause of that Prince when alive On the anniversary of King William's birthday his Duchess then in correspondence with the excluded family gave a magnificent ball and flattered the principles of the Whigs upon the occasion The elections for members of a new parliament were in the mean time carried on with industry contention and animosity The two parties of Whigs and Tories as in Great Britain opposed each other with violence and even bloodshed The troops were obliged to interfere in the elections for the city of Dublin where force only could suppress the ungovernable fury of the voters on both sides  Publications of the Times    Proceedings of the Irish parliament  Though the advantage was visible on the side of the Whigs in the Irish elections the Tories formed a numerous party in the house of commons Upon a division on the choice of a speaker the former were found to posses only a majority of four votes In the house of lords the interest of the latter seemed to prevail The violence that had subsisted without doors was carried into the debates and resolutions of the lower house They  inquired into the late riots in Dublin They examined into the prosecutions in the court of Queen's Bench against the authors and printers of some treasonable publications The object of the Whigs was to attack the Lord Chancellor Phipps who being at the head of the law was averse from exerting its rigour against writers who favoured his own principles The commons resolved that a book intitled "Memoirs of the Chevalier de St George" was a scandalous and seditious libel That the design of that libel was to impeach her Majesty's title to the crown and the succession of the house of Hannover That Sir Constantine Phipps lordchancellor of Ireland had acted contrary to his duty and the Protestant interest by representing the author as an object of the Queen's mercy That the lordchancellor had in a speech to the lord mayor and aldermen of Dublin  Jan  by declaring his opinion prejudiced a cause depending in a court of law That therefore an address should be presented to her Majesty to remove Sir Constantine Phipps from his place of lordhigh chancellor for the peace and safety of her Protestant subjects in Ireland  Journals Dec    They animadvert on the lordchancellor  In the house of lords principles similar to those of the chancellor combining with the weight of government obtained votes of an opposite kind They resolved that Sir Constantine Phipps had in the several stations wherein he had served her Majesty acquitted himself with honour and integrity That a committee should immediately withdraw and prepare an address to her Majesty on the subject of these votes The commons offended at the resolutions of the lords extended further censures to the conduct of Phipps They accused him openly of abetting the views of the Jacobites from his refusing his approbation as chancellor of a person elected lord mayor of Dublin merely because that person was attached to the principles of the late Revolution The flame could be only extinguished by a prorogation The Duke of Shrewsberry apprized of the declining health of the Queen was willing of himself to put a period to the contests in Ireland and to return to London Though the indiscreet Jacobitism of the lord chancellor  merited censure the conduct of the Irish commons was much blamed by the British Tories The figure which Phipps had made at the trial of Doctor Sacheverell had gained the affection of the churchparty The Whigs were loud on the other side of the question and the truth is that the chancellor had been in some measure the cause of unhappy distinctions between the Protestants of Ireland  Domestic affairs  During these transactions in Ireland the ferment raised in Britain by the arts of the two parties continued Though the Tories were in general the most successful more Whigs found their way into the house of commons in the present than in the preceding elections The new parliament which was to have met on the twelfth of November was further prorogued to the tenth of December This measure was at the time ascribed to the manifest decline of the Queen's health and the squabbles among her servants The Earl of Oxford having received a repulse from the Whigs in the month of August  Hannoverpapers  had endeavoured to regain the confidence of the Tories To gratify their prejudices some changes were made in the principal departments of the state To influence the elections in their favour some alterations were made in the inferior offices of the revenue With regard to the first men remarkable for the Tory principle were placed in eminent stations which had been rendered vacant by deaths dismissions or removals The Earl of Mar then actually in correspondence with the Pretender was made third secretary of state The Earl of Dartmouth having received the privy seal made a vacancy for Mr William Bromley as one of her Majesty's principal secretaries Sir William Wyndham became chancellor of the exchequer in the room of Robert Benson raised to the peerage by the title of Lord Bingley The Lord Lansdowne in his principles a Jacobite had received the place of treasurer of the household which had been for some time vacant by the removal of the Earl of Cholmondeley the last Whig of any importance that remained in office  Gazettes August and Sept    Dissensions between the Queen's servants  Whilst the lordtreasurer endeavoured to gain the Tories by these changes he only strengthened the hands of his enemies against himself Bolingbroke encouraged by the accession of Secretary Bromley and Sir William Wyndham continued his intrigues in the cabinet The animosities between the members of administration were no longer unknown to the public The writers employed by government were busy in preparing the nation for an approaching change  Nov  The Earl of Oxford himself though fond of the distinction paid to his high station was displeased at being deprived of its power He thought seriously of retiring from business But there was now no safety in retreating He had too much offended the Whigs to be either forgot or forgiven by that party The Tories should he join with their political enemies would seek an opportunity and they actually possessed the means of revenge In this state of affairs he sacrificed his pride to necessity He resolved to bear with mortifications rather than resign his office His indignation against his rival might contribute to his present firmness He saw that the very person who had already ruined his interest with the Queen wished to deprive him of the influence with the nation which he still derived from his office  MSS passim Publications of  Times    Secret intrigues of

remarkable for friendly attachments seemed to have departed from the usual indifference of his character with regard to the Viscount Bolingbroke He is said to have declared upon the death of the Marquis of Blandford that he had now no comfort left in the world except in Henry St John whom he regarded and loved as his own son  MSS passim  During his campaigns abroad he held an intercourse by letters with St John even when that gentleman was closely connected with Harley his mortal enemy When Harley through the intrigues of Mrs Masham and the changed opinions of the nation brought about a change in the ministry in St John without breaking with  Marlborough gratified his own ambition by accepting the office of secretary of state When therefore the Duke was on the worst terms with the court he had a friend in the cabinet who supported his interest when the current was not too strong to be stemmed When the dangerous intrigues of Marlborough in the end of furnished the lordtreasurer with an opportunity of removing him from all his employments St John yielded to the times and approved of a measure which he could not oppose  Original Papers passim    He takes advantage of the Queen's state of mind  The difficult situation of the Earl of Oxford the perpetual contest between his interest and principles his aukward manner and a conduct throughout undecisive soon rendered him obnoxious to the Tories and hated by the Whigs He however retained throughout the year his influence with his sovereign by finding means to persuade that timid Princess that he himself was necessary to her safety against the dangerous designs of the Whigs When time had expunged from her memory a part of her fears she began to listen to the insinuations of Bolingbroke against the treasurer Subject to frequent illnesses and sensible of the decay of her own constitution she became apprehensive that she was fast approaching to her end An enthusiast like the most of her family she became anxious for the eventual succession of her brother to the throne from motives of religion Her solemn promises to her father a letter written to her by that Prince in his last illness  Hannoverpapers  her having been by her desertion the obvious cause of his ruin  Her letter to her father Dec  were always present to a mind enfeebled by sickness as well as superstition She deemed the death of her children a signal punishment inflicted by Providence for her own injustice to a parent as she was pleased to construe her conduct  Hannoverpapers  Having left her father in his extremity with a view of securing his throne to her own posterity she weakly thought that Heaven had interfered to disappoint her designs  Ibid    with regard to the Pretender  Bolingbroke had long watched the emotions of her mind and he endeavoured to turn them to his advantage  Having flattered her prejudices by pretending to enter into her views he gradually supplanted the influence of the lordtreasurer He represented the languor of his measures He gave insinuations concerning his secret intrigues with the Whigs The artifice which he used with the Queen he employed with equal success on the more violent Tories In the beginning of the present year he formed a serious design of placing himself at the head of a party independent of the Earl of Oxford But a wellgrounded fear of the Whigs induced him afterwards to adhere to the lordtreasurer He was however at the bottom of all the mortifications which that minister suffered by the desertion of some of the highchurch party in the last session of parliament To humble his rival was suitable to his violent passions To ruin him entirely considering the times and his own precarious situation was inconsistent with common prudence His object was to strengthen himself with the return of the Duke of Marlborough That nobleman would have no objection to join with any party who should contribute to the fall of his enemy the Earl of Oxford  MSS passim  To feel the pulse of the Tories and to sound the inclinations of the Queen reports were industriously spread in the summer that the Duke was to return to Britain at the express desire of the ministry  Stuartpapers    His intrigues in favour of Marlborough  These insinuations produced not the expected effect The Queen was averse from the measure The Tories expressed no desire for the Duke's return His Grace having spent the summer in making vain solicitations to the house of Hannover for sending the Electoral Prince to Britain seemed to be suddenly seized with an impatience not unnatural to his disposition however much it was concealed He represented to the Elector that being now in the sixtysixth year of his age he wished to pass the rest of his life in quietness in his native country That as his Highness seemed so indifferent above the succession it was time for his friends to take care of themselves That by coinciding with the views of the ministry whose almost avowed intentions were to restore the Pretender the friends of the house of Hannove  might perhaps obtain security from a Prince whose favour they could not in reason expect These chidings bearing the appearance of zeal were neither regarded nor feared In the mean time Bolingbroke proceeded in his intrigues He daily gained the ground which the unhappy manner of the treasurer was destined to lose He had often complained to the Queen of his principles He now loudly accused him of dilatoriness and indolence He affirmed that by neglecting the power which the influence of government had placed in his hands he had permitted a greater number of Whigs than was consistent with the safety of government to obtain seats in the house of commons  Stuartpapers    who corresponds with the Pretender  Expecting much from the intrigues of Bolingbroke and tired of his own situation the Duke of Marlborough again formed hopes of his speedy return To regain his former power he seemed inclined to desert his present friends He was willing to govern Anne by yielding to her prejudices Under a certainty that she was attached to her brother's interest he endeavoured secretly to gain the confidence of the Pretender's adherents abroad He wrote to the Duchess of Berwick He even sent a letter to the late King James's Queen He dispatched one of his retainers to France He empowered him to convey the most solemn protestations of his attachment to the Chevalier de St George He assured him with an oath that he would rather cut off his own righthand than oppose his views on the throne That provided he himself might be rendered secure he would not hesitate a moment to use all his credit both privately and publickly for his service He instructed the Duke of Berwick he said more largely on the subject and he had reason to hope an answer suitable to his sincerity and zeal  Ibid Oct  These relentings of Marlborough if they were at all sincere were prevented from having any effect by the fears of the Queen The dangerous intrigues of the Duke in the preceding year had made such a deep impression on her mind that she was even terrified at the very mention of his name and though she could not legally continue  his exile she resolved never to give her consent to his return  Stuartpapers    Misrepresentations of the Whigs  The terrors of the Queen for Marlborough proved a fatal blow to her own views To ruin the treasurer by supporting himself with the prejudices of the sovereign the Duke might have probably deserted the principles of the Whigs which like many of the party he had only adopted to favour his own designs But when he found that the Queen was obdurate and that the Pretender himself treated his proposals with caution and even distrust he fell back with vehemence into his former professions to the house of Hannover He corresponded with that family Without either ceremony or distinction he accused the ministry of incurable Jacobitism and in the general accusation even involved his friend Bolingbroke He was joined in these assurances by most of the leaders of the Whigparty The Duke of Argyle yielding to personal resentment affirmed to the envoy of Hannover that he knew from his own experience the lordtreasurer was a false and deceitful man That he exerted himself with all his might against the Protestant succession That he was reforming the army to facilitate the restoration of the Pretender and that even his friends acknowledged he was too far engaged to retreat The Earl of Ilay extended his accusations much further than his brother the Duke of Argyle He assured the Hannoverian resident that the Presbyterians were the only friends of the succession of the Electoral family and that all the members of the church of England especially in Scotland were Jacobites without exception  Hannoverpapers Dec    They demand money for poor lords c  The Whigs in general were impressed with uncommon fears They again urged the Elector to invade the kingdom They promised to furnish him with sums upon his credit to save their country and to execute his own designs but with an inconsistence repugnant to these large promises they reverted to their former demands of money from his Highness They asked pensions for poor conscientious lords who were in want of subsistence They demanded with the most vehement entreaties two thousand pounds to carry the elections for the commoncouncil  of London They represented that with that sum they could chuse their own creatures and terrify the Queen and parliament with remonstrances and addresses throughout the winter  "Should we fail to engage"  they said  "the Elector to agree to any of our proposals we must in prudence provide for ourselves and yield to the times  Hannoverpapers Dec  "  Despondence of the Elector's servants  These representations though not sufficient to prevail with the Elector to make remittances threw his servants into a kind of political despair  "If we shall do nothing ourselves"  they said  "for the succession we cannot expect to succeed without a miracle But our disappointment of a crown is the least evil we have to fear Our troubles will only begin when our hopes shall come to an end Having raised so many enemies by our prospect of the British throne we can enjoy neither peace nor safety in the Electorate Those who either feared or envied our elevation will never be satisfied till we are so low that they may be assured they have nothing further to apprehend  Hannoverpapers  "  During the terrors of the Whigs and the despondence of the Elector's servants they fell upon an expedient that seemed for the time to alleviate a part of their fears A proposal made by the Baron de Bernstorff president of the Elector's council was received by Marlborough and Cadogan with eagerness and joy He insinuated that his Electoral Highness might be induced to borrow to the extent of twenty thousand pounds from his friends in Britain This sum was to be laid out on the poor lords and the commoncouncil of London during the three years the parliament was to sit The first would be thus enabled to vote according to their principles the latter might ply the government and harass the Queen and her ministers with remonstrances in favour of civil liberty and the Protestant succession Marlborough and Cadogan undertook to furnish the money on the obligation of his Electoral Highness provided the interest of five  per cent  should be regularly paid  Ibid Dec  But his Highness would give no obligation either for the principal or interest He however signified to his agents that his friends should advance the money as  they might be certain of being reimbursed as soon as his Highness or the Electress his mother should come to the throne  Hannoverpapers March    A general uneasiness and panic  During these secret intrigues of party the nation was harassed with vague rumours and idle reports The Queen whose health had long declined fell into a dangerous illness in the end of December The minds of the two parties became strangely agitated by various expectations or fears The adherents of the Pretender fondly imagined that the period of his restoration was near The Whigs foreseeing their danger lamented the fate of the kingdom in their own The malicious and interested on both sides were busy in this state of public suspicion and suspense A report was industriously spread that a squadron of fourteen men of war were fitting out in the ports of France  Jan    and that these ships were to take on board fourteen thousand troops The public funds sell gradually in their price On the twentyninth of January a sudden panic seized the minds of monied men There was a great run on the Bank The directors in the utmost terror applied to the lordtreasurer for his assistance and advice He endeavoured in vain to dispel their groundless fears Nothing could remove their apprehensions till the Queen herself wrote a letter on the first of February to the lordmayor announcing her recovery The public melancholy and panic were changed at once into festivity and joy The armies reported to be assembled in the Bolognese and the squadrons said to be preparing in the ports of France disappeared like an idle dream and the Pretender whom fame had placed at the head of a powerful invasion was found to have remained in his obscure retreat in Lorrain  Publications of the Times    Mr Harley sent to Hannover  The dangerous state of the Queen's health induced the Earl of Oxford to endeavour to provide against the event of her demise His own unhappy manner and the arts of his enemies had deprived of credit all his prosessions i  the minds of the Hannoverian agents in London H  resolved therefore to send again his relation Thoma  Harley  Hannove  papers Jan  to the court of Hannover He was as un+fortunate  in the choice of his messenger as he was in the assurances which he intended to make to the Electoral family Harley had rendered himself suspected of Jacobitism by his never writing to the Princess Sophia after his former embassy  Hannoverpapers Jan  notwithstanding his warm professions of attachment to the Protestant succession The Whigs and the Hannoverian agents put the worst construction on the advances made by the lordtreasurer They were ignorant of his having lost a great part of his influence in the cabinet They affected to consider his protestations of zeal as so many baits to deceive They wrote to Hannover that the object of Harley's commission was twofold That either the Queen appeared to the lordtreasurer to be in such a bad state of health as to render it prudent to pay court to her legal successor or that his own measures were not yet come to maturity in favour of the Pretender  Ibid Jan    Parliament meets  Though the Queen had in some measure recovered from her late indisposition she was not capable to open in person the session of parliament That assembly having met on the fifteenth of February Sir Thomas Hanmer was chosen speaker by the commons without any opposition Hanmer who abetted in public the principles of the Tories had privately made his peace with the Whigs Under a promise from the Hannoverian agents of titles and preferments when his Electoral Highness should mount the British throne he had become suddenly a friend to the Protestant line  Hannoverpapers  The speaker was not the only Tory who closed in secret with the Whigs The Earl of Nottingham disappointed a second time in his views on the privyseal  Stuart and Hannoverpapers  laid it down for a maxim that the lordtreasurer was averse from the Protestant succession and a friend to the Chevalier de St George  Hannoverpapers Feb    He waited upon the resident of the house of Hannover He endeavoured to prove by various arguments that the ministry were resolved to place the Pretender on the throne during the Queen's life  "But though you are so negligent yourselves"  said Nottingham  "your friends  shall not fall without employing their efforts to secure for you the crown But as they see that all their representations are in vain that you do not design to believe their professions that you even ascribe perhaps their conduct to their passions and regard to interest they are determined to demand a writ for the Electoral Prince to take his seat in the house of peers This measure will unmask your enemies and discover to your friends what they are to expect from yourselves  Hannoverpapers Feb  "  Some Tories join the Whigs  The Earl of Anglesea whose principles when not opposed to his interest were inclined to Jacobitism suffered himself to be guided by motives similar to those of the Earl of Nottingham He met in private the leaders of the Whigs He held conferences with the Hannoverian resident He promoted with vehemence the measure of demanding the writ for the Electoral Prince The whole party rested their hopes on this one article They formed no other plan of opposition They had nothing further to propose in parliament  Ibid March  But notwithstanding the accession of so many Tories to the cause of the house of Hannover their agents were extremely diffident of the succession They informed their court that out of ten who were for the Electoral family nine would accommodate themselves to the times That whatever their principles might have been in speculation they would hazard nothing in practice That in the affair of the succession they would embrace the cause of the first of the rivals for the throne that should arrive in the kingdom That those who expressed the greatest zeal for the Protestant line flattered themselves that the government of the Pretender whom they looked upon as a weak Prince would not be so great an evil as a perpetual civil war  Ibid    Sentiments of both with regard to the succession  These were certainly the sentiments of the greatest number of the Tories and perhaps those of all the moderate Whigs The Lord Guildford who openly avowed the Tory principle and was privately much attached to the pretended Prince of Wales made no secret of the opinions of his own party He told the Lord Cowper that those Tories who were most attached to the house  of Hannover would hazard no part of their fortune against the Pretender That though they might allow their religion and liberty would be more safe by adhering to the present establishment they flattered themselves that by good laws both the one and the other might be very well secured That for his own part he could solemnly swear that he neither knew nor believed there existed any serious scheme in favour of the Pretender  "But I frankly acknowledge"  he continued  "that should ever matters be pushed to any length on that side the greatest part of us Tories will submit while some of you Whigs will perhaps be fools enough to expose the kingdom to a civil war and suffer your country to be laid waste on the one hand by the French and on the other by the Germans"  Affairs of Europe Peace of Rastadt  While the two parties in Britain were harassing themselves with idle hopes and vain fears about the succession a peace was concluded at Rastadt between the Emperor and the French King  March  The conditions of the treaty were little changed by the operations of the preceding campaign Things were left on the confines of France and Germany on the plan delineated by the peace of Riswick With regard to the Netherlands the two powers agreed to the terms settled at Utrecht The Emperor consented to restore their territories to the Princes of Italy whom he had stript of their dominions He engaged to continue the neutrality and not to disturb the repose of that country The Electors of Bavaria and Cologn were reestablished in their dominions and dignities The title of the Elector of Hannover was recognised in form by the French King The Emperor moved by his resentment for having been as he thought deserted had resolved to conclude the treaty without either the participation or intervention of the maritime powers To mortify the court of Great Britain he set on foot a new treaty with the StatesGeneral for a barrier in the Netherlands and having brought to some maturity the business at the Hague removed the negociation soon after to Vienna  Annals of Queen Anne    Peace with Spain  The King of Spain might have concluded a peace with all the confederates except the Emperor and Empire at  Utrecht But he suffered that important work to be suspended till the present year by the ambition of a foolish woman The Princess Orsini having obtained an ascendant over his counsels employed her credit to make herself a sovereign She wanted that a principality should be erected for her in the Netherlands The court of Great Britain and the StatesGeneral had agreed to this preposterous proposal The Spanish plenipotentiaries insisted strenuously with the rest of the confederates to consent to a condition deemed essential by their master They were however forced at length to abandon their demand The Emperor would never consent to the dismemberment of any part of the Netherlands The French King interfered with his grandson He persuaded that Prince to pay more regard to the repose of his people than to the caprice of a woman But notwithstanding his remonstrances the peace itself was not signed at Utrecht till the present year The Princess Orsini who had so long obstructed the great work of peace fell soon after into a disgrace suitable to the magnitude of her own ambition and solly  M de Torcy tom ii    Queen opens the session of parliament  On the twentyseventh of February a messenger arrived from Holland with the ratifications exchanged of the treaty of commerce between Great Britain and Spain The peace between the two kingdoms was formally proclaimed on the first of March The Queen had returned to London in the middle of February amidst the acclamations of the populace who were overjoyed at the prospect of her recovery from her late dangerous illness But as her health was not sufficiently restored to open with the usual ceremony of a speech the business of parliament the two houses had adjourned to the second of March The Queen having gone to the house of lords on that day addressed her parliament in terms suitable to the state of the times Having animadverted severely on those who insinuated that the succession in the house of Hannover was in danger she assured the two houses that to weaken her authority and render her uneasy in the possession of the crown could never be proper means to support the Protestant succession She had done and should continue she said to do her best for  the good of her subjects She recommended to her parliament to follow her example by uniting the differences of parties and by improving jointly the benefits obtained by the treaty of peace  Journals March    They censure political writers  The Whigs having confined by concert  Hannoverpapers Feb  their operations to the projected demand of a writ for the Electoral Prince no opposition was made in either house to warm addresses to the throne The commons followed their address with a vote of supply In considering an article of the Queen's speech with regard to libels the two parties flew into their usual flame A motion was made in the house of commons against a pamphlet written with great acrimony and boldness charging the servants of the Queen with maladministration and asserting in express terms that the Protestant succession was in danger through their machinations This performance though the work of a Mr Moore  MSS passim  was ascribed to Mr Richard Steele a name well known in the republic of letters Steele who had obtained a seat in the house of commons acknowledged himself the author of this obnoxious publication After various and long debates he was upon a division expelled the house  March  In the house of lords the Whigs foreseeing the severity against Steele extended their animadversions to a publication written in opposition to his pamphlet This answer which reflected severely on the Scotish nation had been ascribed by public report to the famous Dr Swift It was chiefly levelled against the Duke of Argyle who was hated by the Doctor's patron the Earl of Oxford But though the violence of the Whigs yielded not to that of the Tories they were not equal to them in point of numbers when the matter came to a vote The ministry however chose to remove the whole affair from before the lords into a court of common law  The ministry dismiss several officers  During the contest between the parties in parliament secret animosities subsisted in the cabinet The two rivals for the Queen's favour were however united in their public measures against the Whigs on account of their common fears The ministry were no strangers to the designs of that party They knew that the Elector had  been long solicited to undertake an invasion They resolved therefore to be prepared against an event that threatened their own power as well as the Queen's authority It was upon this account and not in favour of the Pretender that they fell upon the suspicious measure of new modelling the army In the middle of March the Duke of Argyle the Earl of Stair and other officers of rank whom the ministry suspected were removed from all their military employments The Queen however paid an equivalent in money to the dismissed officers The measure furnished the artful with an object of clamour and terrified the credulous and timid The Viscount Bolingbroke who was known to have obtained the ascendant over the lordtreasurer was accused of being the author of these dangerous counsels His enemies affirmed that despairing of the Queen's life and excluded from every hope of the favour of the house of Hannover he precipitated every thing to pave the way for the restoration of the Pretender  Publications of the Times    The Elector refuses to gratify the Whigs  The leaders of the Whigs terrified by this appearance of decision in the ministry fell into their usual despondence They declared their opinion that no hope remained but in the death of the Queen or in that of the Pretender They blamed the court of Hannover for having sacrificed their friends as well as their own hopes of the throne The Elector argued in vain against the propriety of yielding to their desperate requests He knew he said that the Queen was averse from seeing any of his family in her dominions That not withstanding her prejudices he would have sent the Electoral Prince to London had he not been persuaded that the measure would bring matters to an open rupture That as it was impracticable to bring the lawful successor into the kingdom they ought to secure the succession by removing his competitor That he had already made repeated instances to the Queen on that subject That he was resolved to renew his remonstrances That as to their unceasing demands of money for poor lords commoncouncils bribery of members and private pensions he would hear no more of that affair That from the narrowness of his own income he could not enter upon these heads into any competition with his antagonist  the lordtreasurer But that except in the article of expences he was willing to support to the utmost their party  Hannoverpapers March N S    Unmanly fears of that party  These assurances on the part of the Elector neither answered the hopes nor removed the fears of the Whigs Though such Tories as were in the interest of the house of Hannover though the lordtreasurer himself though the concurring voice of the whole ministry declared that the Protestant succession was in no danger the leaders of the party gave way to their own unmanly terrors They drew inferences from uncertain facts They improved into strong realities idle rumours They even believed that preparations were already made for sending several of their leaders to the Tower In this state of doubt and uneasiness they resolved to make one other effort to gain the people by awaking their fears The lords having taken the state of the nation into consideration the Earls of Wharton Nottingham and Sunderland with other peers of the same party represented in the strongest terms the danger that threatened the Protestant succession They moved that an address should be presented to her Majesty on the subject of the removal of the Pretender from Lorrain and on other points calculated to raise the resentment of the populace against the ministry On this occasion the Earl of Oxford made a motion which seemed preposterous as the motive was then unknown He moved for leave to bring in a bill for the further security of the Protestant succession by making it hightreason to bring any foreign troops into the kingdom  Hannoverpapers passim    Their conspiracy to seize the Tower c  Men who ascribe to policy every measure of a minister will find it difficult to account for the motion made by the lordtreasurer If as he averred in the house he only meant to preclude the adherents of the Pretender from invading the kingdom his expedient was altogether nugatory and unnecessary Such troops as should attend that Prince would have been open enemies if foreigners and rebels if natives The treasurer seems to have reasons for his present conduct which he did not chuse to reveal The StatesGeneral alarmed by the terrors  of the Whigs and the zealous representations of the agents of Hannover began to make preparations for aiding effectually the Elector in his views on the British throne Some ships of war were made ready for sea in their ports Some troops especially the Scots in the service had received orders to march toward the coast The Whigs at home were ready to second the projected invasion from abroad A set of inferior conspirators were prepared to support with action the deliberations of their leaders Measures were concerted by a society called the kitcat club to seize the Tower to declare for the family of Hannover to secure the persons of such as were suspected of favouring the Pretender In this number the lordtreasurer himself had the misfortune of being comprehended by his enemies and he awkwardly chose this preposterous motion as a kind of proof of his being no stranger to the designs of the Whigs  Hannoverpapers passim Publications of the Times MSS passim    Reflections  In all states that possess any portion of public freedom the appeal of parties is always made to the people Though the body of the nation enjoy but a very small share of any government they make up with their weight and numbers what they want in authority as individuals The candidates for office endeavour to gain their favour by applying to their principles but oftner to their prejudices and those succeed the best who impose with the most address and dexterity upon their credulity and fears The good opinion of a people is therefore the citadel if the expression may be used to which factions direct all their irregular attacks and when a party happens to possess themselves of that strong hold they over a we their antagonists and govern at discretion the noisy populace by whose suffrages they have ascended to power The domestic history of the present reign contains little more than a continued series of such political hostilities In this clamorous contest as well as in real war the combatants acquire an experience from length of time that frequently suspends the fate of the conflict when a decision is most to be apprehended  Protestant succession voted out of danger  The Whigs with a perseverance worthy of a better cause than any design on power and office had long continued  their attacks on the Tories The weight of government the efforts of the church and the great popularity of the Queen herself had hitherto frustrated all their efforts Disappointed in their public conduct they had lately recourse to private measures and succeeded in gaining over such Tories as were discontented with the ministry The agents of the house of Hannover at the suggestion of the leading Whigs had prevailed with the Earl of Anglesea and his followers in the house of lords to desert the Tories upon promises of future advantage  Hannoverpapers  Sir William Dawes though spontaneously raised by the Queen to the see of York promised upon the like assurances to desert the measures of the court and to carry over to the Whigs a majority of the bench of bishops  Ibid  Encouraged by this unexpected defection the party introduced a warm debate in the house of lords on the fifth of April After various speeches the question was proposed whether the Protestant succession was in danger On a division the courtparty prevailed by twelve votes  against  The Earls of Abingdon and Jersey the Lords Ashburnham Herbert and Carteret who had uniformly supported the ministry joined the Whigs on the present occasion The same question being agitated before the commons was carried by a greater majority for the adherents of the court  against    Cause of the desertion of some Tories  Though the desertion of so many Tories from the ministry may be ascribed in some degree to the promises of the Hannoverian agents they had motives of another kind The most of those who joined the Whigs had been highly irrigated against the Earl of Oxford They knew that a party had long been forming against him in the cabinet and that a defeat in parliament was only wanting to the completion of his ruin He was abandoned by his brethren in office He was no longer supported by the Queen herself The scanty majority in a question on which his power depended was equal to a partial defeat Every body expected to see him next day without his staff as treasurer He himself offered to resign  Hannoverpapers April  But he contrived to insinuate to the Queen by one of  his friends that her ruin would succeed his fall Struck with this application her usual fears began to return Though at the solicitation of the Lady Masham she had consented to dismiss the treasurer she became again reconciled to that minister upon certain conditions  Hannoverpapers April  The Earl of Nottingham who hoped to succeed Oxford in the treasury was again disappointed  Ibid  and thus was forced by his resentment to abet a party of whose principles he secretly disapproved  Motions of the Whigs against the Pretender  The Whigs encouraged by the late accession to their party carried farther their opposition against the crown On the subject of the Chevalier de St George only they could raise the fears of the people They moved therefore for an address to her Majesty for renewing her instances with the Duke of Lorrain to expel the Pretender from his dominions An addition made to their motion seemed levelled against the suspected feelings of the Queen's mind It was proposed to request her Majesty to issue a proclamation setting a price on her brother's head The Lord North and Grey seconded by the Lord Trevor opposed with vehemence this latter measure  April  They represented that the motion was as inconsistent with common humanity as it was repugnant to the Christian religion That to set a price on any man's head was to encourage assassination by public authority That for their own parts should ever the case come before them as peers and judges they would think themselves bound in justice honour and conscience to condemn such an action as murder The Whigs argued upon the ground of expediency But the Tory lords who had joined them some days before deserted them on this occasion The bishops either from principle or decency were averse from this sanguinary measure and upon a division the addition to the first motion was rejected  Journals April    Their fears superfluous and vain  The address to the Queen was presented only by a few Whig lords Could a judgment be formed of the state of things from the conduct of parliament one might suppose that the nation was then in imminent danger That the Pretender was ready to make a descent upon Britain with a powerful army or that he was invited  by a formidable party at home That his friends only waited for his arrival to dethrone the Queen and utterly extirpate all the Whigs in the kingdom The contrary of all this was the truth The French who could only support the Pretender were unwilling to plunge into those disasters from which they had been lately extricated by a species of miracle Lewis the Fourteenth never hearty in the cause of the excluded Stuarts was now more averse than ever from giving them any effectual support His ambition and his love of glory had vanished with his power He felt the decline of years Though still eager to live he foresaw his own approaching death The prospect of French affairs was gloomy beyond that period He was to leave the scepter in the hands of a sickly infant under the tuition of an unprincipled relation who from the very misfortunes of the late war had perhaps extended his views to the crown In this melancholy state at home Lewis thought of nothing less than to kindle a war abroad by assisting the Pretender  Observations on their conduct  Were then the fears of the Whigs an idle dream Or aimed they only at the persecution of an unfortunate woman already driven to the verge of the grave by solicitude as well as disease To save the honour of that party the answer to these questions must be made at the expence of their understanding Having first endeavoured to alarm the populace with the fears of Popery and the Pretender they began at length to be the dupes of their own arts and to believe seriously what they had so often averred Their precipitate schemes had created the only dangers that now threatened the object of the act of settlement Had the Queen been less timid or the minister more violent or even more regardless of his original principles the first to preserve her authority and the latter to secure his power and perhaps ultimately his life might have entered into measures that would have proved fatal to the succession in the house of Hannover The conduct of the Whigs was throughout more calculated to irritate than to intimidate had the ministry carried into their councils that contradictory boldness and obstinacy which bad treatment invariably raises in the minds of the spirited and proud  Their scheme to embarrass the Queen  Though the Whigs in a fit of despondence had threatened to the court of Hannover to abandon their principles and to shift for themselves their success in the late questions had animated them to further attempts against the Queen and her servants They had proposed to the Hannoverian resident in the beginning of the session to demand a writ for the Electoral Prince to sit in the house of peers as Duke of Cambridge The resident without any direct orders from his court communicated his design to the lordtreasurer who had uniformly made the most violent yet the least effectual professions of his zeal for the Protestant line That minister plainly told him that to bring over any of the family of Lunenburgh would be to place her coffin before her Majesty's eyes and that those who had any respect for her friendship or hopes from her favour should never propose a thing so utterly disagreeable to her mind  HannoverPapers Feb March  The Elector himself was as much averse from the measure as the Queen He had uniformly refused his consent to the sending over the Electoral Prince in the preceding year and his refusal was so peremptory that the Whigs and even his servants made no scruple of ascribing his conduct to a jealousy of his own son  Ibid passim    A writ demanded for the Electoral Prince  Though the Elector had not probably changed his sentiments he yielded in part to the earnest instances of the Whigs He permitted Schutz his envoy at London to demand in the name of the Electress a writ for the Electoral Prince as Duke of Cambridge Schutz whose eagerness had frequently extended his measures beyond the limits of his instructions took the first opportunity for executing his commission On the twelfth of April he waited upon the LordChancellor Harcourt and demanded the writ in form Startled at this unexpected request the chancellor declined to give any answer till he should consult the Queen He hastened to the palace A cabinetcouncil was immediately called The Queen exhibited upon the occasion every symptom of violence and passion She commanded the chancellor to write instantly to Schutz She ordered him to signify that as  she had heard nothing of the matter from the court of Hannover she could not persuade herself that their minister acted in the present case by their instructions  Hannoverpapers April N S  This was the only answer the resident could obtain to his demand The exultations of the Whigs increased the resentment of the Queen She declared in the most peremptory manner that she would rather suffer the last extremities than permit any Prince of the Electoral family to come to Britain to reside during her life That she considered the conduct of the resident in the light of a personal affront As a mark of her ultimate displeasure she sent the master of the ceremonies to forbid Schutz to appear any more at her court She ordered that officer to declare at the same time to the envoy that she intended to solicit the Elector and Electress for his instant recall  Ibid May    The lordtreasurer's professions  The lordtreasurer terrified at an incident that was likely to create an open rupture between the Queen and the presumptive heirs of the crown began to make fresh professions of zeal to the latter He assured them that he was entirely and unalterably devoted to the interest of the house of Hannover That this proceeded not only from the conscience of his oaths but out of a profound respect for their many virtues That he might without vanity say he had the chief hand in settling their succession to the crown That the Lady Masham was for the Protestant line That he was sure the Queen was inclined to the same side That nothing therefore could endanger the succession but the sending over any of the Electoral family without her Majesty's consent  Ibid April  He however altered his language in a few days He declared that he never thought matters would have been pushed so far That he was apprehensive of his own speedy disgrace That he was desired to enter into the views of the Pretender and that the Queen was more determined than ever to strengthen the interest of her brother and to secure for him the throne  Ibid May    If Anne was before attached to the eventual succession of the Pretender the present incident was calculated to hasten her designs She was alarmed on the subject of  the writ to a degree that gave an unusual animation and even vehemence to her conduct She wrote to the Princess Sophia She sent letters to the Elector and the Electoral Prince She expressed to each her surprise at the design of sending the Prince to England She almost openly threatened that his coming to Britain might endanger if not prevent the succession of his family to the throne In this determined conduct that timid Princess seems to have been chiefly supported by her own fears She found that the attachment of her subjects to her person declined with the state of her health That though she had many servants she was totally destitute of friends That those whom she trusted the most were the least likely to adhere to her cause That a minister who derived his claim to her favour from his pretending to support her measures was making terms for himself with her political enemies That her authority and even her very title as sovereign would depend upon the moderation of her successor and that she would be either forced to resign her crown or to exert its prerogatives in subserviency to a party whom she both hated and feared  MSS passim    The Elector's demands  During the convulsions in Britain the lordtreasurer's cousin arrived at the court of Hannover The Whigs and especially the Duke of Marlborough had by letters raised prejudices in the mind of the Elector with regard to the real object of Harley's embassy His Highness received him with manifest coldness He paid little attention to his prosessions He however ordered a memorial to be given to Harley couched in the most decent terms He informed the Queen that he was sensible of her former favours but that something still remained to be done He represented to her Majesty that it was necessary to oblige the Pretender to retire to Italy That his remaining in Lorrain was dangerous as his Highness was well assured that he meditated a descent in NorthBritain That for the security of her royal person her kingdoms and the Protestant religion it seemed necessary to settle in Britain some Prince of the Electoral family who might be attentive to such important concerns That he took the liberty to renew his instances for a pension and establishment for the Electress as the nearest heir  to the crown and that he hoped her Majesty would grant the titles belonging to the Princes of the blood to such sons of the house of Hannover as were not already raised to dignities  Hannoverpapers May    Intrigues of Oxford  Though the lordtreasurer had the misfortune to procure no credit to his professions he continued to make advances to the court of Hannover To retain the confidence of the Queen he was forced to declare publickly against the coming of the Electoral Prince But he at the same time insinuated to the Hannoverian agents that he would not be sorry to see the Prince arrived in Britain He took however advantage of the present terrors of the Queen to recover the influence he had lost He assured her that it was the violence of Bolingbroke that induced the Elector to demand the writ  Ibid May  He pretended to have gained with promises of advantage the Lady Masham His emissaries privately accused Bolingbroke and Harcourt of a fixed design for establishing the Pretender on the thron  Ibid May  He even boasted to his friends that he would soon compel both his antagonists to resign But notwithstanding these pretences he found that his credit with the Queen was greatly upon the decline He therefore entered into secret negociations with the Whigs He expressed his fears for the succession He represented their own apparent danger They accepted his offers promised to forget the past and to maintain for the future his authority  Ibid May    Affairs in parliament  During this suspicious rather than busy session of parliament the two houses passed two bills of considerable importance  Journals  The first limited to a certain number the officers civil and military that should be capable of becoming members of the house of commons The second was calculated to prevent the growth of schism in a manner deemed extremely severe by the Dissenters This last bill furnished an ample field of contest for the two contending factions It was said to have been introduced by Bolingbroke to harass Oxford who favoured the Dissenters and to gain to himself the support and affection of the highchurch party In matters of religion men are frequently as inconsistent with themselves  as in politics The leaders of the ministry who supported the bill with all their own eloquence as well as with the weight of government were themselves bred Dissenters The Earl of Nottingham deemed inviolably attached to the church of England forgot his religious principles in his political resentment Though he had made the bill against occasional conformity the price of his joining the Whigs he opposed with vehemence the present bill  Publications of the Times  The lordtreasurer himself retired without voting upon the question This conduct was at the time ascribed to his religious principles But it is now known that it proceeded from his secret coalition with the Whigs  Hannoverpapers May    Situation and views of the Pretender  While the courts of Great Britain and Hannover the two houses of parliament and the whole British nation were distracted with hopes and fears about the succession the Pretender lived in a state of anxious obscurity in Lorrain Foreigners judging from the fears of the friends of the house of Hannover formed no doubt of his speedy restoration to the throne They concluded that his sister was heartily in his interest That her servants were forming effectual schemes for securing his succession to the crown The Duke of Lorrain gained by the softness of his manners touched with his misfortunes or forming hopes upon his future prospects entered heartily into his cause Perceiving the indifference of France he endeavoured to gain the Imperial court to the interest of his guest He even directed his envoy at the court of Vienna to ask for him in marriage one of the daughters of the Emperor Joseph Charles the Sixth was so little offended at this request that the only objection he made was the disparity in their age The archdutchess was but twelve years old but the Pretender was in his six and twentieth year The Emperor recommended his own sister as a more suitable match He however prudently observed that the times were too critical to come to a determination on this head But that when an occasion should offer he was much disposed to give to the Chevalier de St George solid marks of his esteem and regard  Stuartpapers Feb    A proclamation against him offering a reward  Many zealots in Britain maintained in the mean time a correspondence with the Pretender and his servants The ministry continued to admit his agents into their conversation to serve or ruin his cause as might best suit with their own interest But amidst insinuations of attachment and perhaps professions of zeal they were betrayed into a measure which might convince him that his hopes from their favour were ill founded An information having been obtained by the vigilance of the Earl of Wharton against some Irish officers who inlisted men for the Pretender they were seized by a warrant from the Queen's Bench The people were alarmed The Whigs added artfully to their fears The adherents of the ministry were terrified The lordtreasurer now in concert with the Whigs had wrought so much upon the natural timidity of the Duke of Shrewsbury that he joined him in an important measure upon the present occasion  MSS  The discovery made by Wharton having fallen under the deliberation of the cabinetcouncil it was carried by a majority of votes that a proclamation should be issued against the Pretender Shrewsberry deserted his principles of Jacobitism and his political friend Bolingbroke upon this point  Hannoverpapers th June th July  A proclamation was accordingly issued on the twentythird of June promising a reward of five thousand pounds for apprehending the Pretender whenever he should land or attempt to land in Great Britain The two houses voted an address of thanks to the Queen and the commons in their zeal for the Protestant succession extended the reward to one hundred thousand pounds  Journals June    The Queen endeavours to soothe the Elector  The conduct of the Queen upon the present occasion seemed inconsistent with her suspected attachment to the interest of the Pretender But her fears from the family of Lunenburgh had suspended her affection for her own Her object was to soothe the Elector to agree to her request of keeping the Prince at home She had taken early precautions for this purpose Soon after the writ was demanded she appointed Lord Paget her ambassador to the court of Hannover But his Lordship having declined  that service she conferred that character on her own cousin the Earl of Clarendon The Elector on his part ordered the Baron de Bothmar to repair to London to supply the place of Schutz who upon being forbid the court had left the kingdom Bothmar endeavoured to defeat the object of Clarendon's embassy by raising prejudices against that nobleman in the mind of the Elector He informed his court that Clarendon was a selfish and presumptuous fool  Hannoverpapers June  That when he was governor of an American province he dressed himself as a woman the better to represent the Queen's person That this foel to use Bothmar's words was appointed without the treasurer's knowledge That Bolingbroke had acquired the superiority and that Oxford had made through Kreyenberg the resident the most servile advances to Bothmar himself  "A sure sign"  says he  "of his approaching fall  Ib  "  Death of the Princess Sophia  During these transactions the Electress Sophia died suddenly at Hannover in the eightyfourth year of her age  May O S  She retained her faculties to the last But there is reason to believe that had she even survived Queen Anne she would not mount the throne She was a Princess possessed of great prudence good sense lively parts and a considerable degree of knowledge with an affability of disposition that rendered her much beloved Though she was the only person mentioned by name in the act of settlement her great age had prevented her from being the principal object of attention The Elector without consulting her seems to have instructed his envoys in her name and the parties in Britain who strove to pay their court to the family of Lu  enburgh had for several years much neglected the Princess Her demise as it was not unexpected was regarded as a common occurrence Scarce any mention is made of that event in the papers of the Hannoveriat agents in Britain except where it is announced in form to the Queen Her death therefore could produce no change on the present state of affairs  State of the ministry  But though the Elector was now one step nearer the throne his efforts to secure the succession were far from  keeping pace with the sanguine hopes of his friends He made no preparations for sending the Electoral Prince to Britain To gratify the Whigs to put an end to the teasing entreaties of his servants and perhaps even to terrify Queen Anne he had given permission for demanding the writ But there is no reason to believe that he altered his first sentiments on that subject or that he ever seriously designed to permit his son to depart from his dominions This conduct would have thrown back the Whigs into their former despondence had not their hopes of power been from time to time revived by the dissensions in the cabinet The common safety of the two candidates for the Queen's favour had hitherto preserved a kind of union in their public counsels The measures of the crown though languidly supported were carried forward with a degree of unanimity The jealousy of the Tories except in a few questions on which some of their leaders joined the Whigs from motives of private interest or resentment had cemented them together in a manner not to be disjoined by the squabbles between Oxford and Bolingbroke But as the quarrels of these men were likely soon to accomplish the fall of the one or the other the Whigs looked forward to the confusion expected from that event They watched with eagerness the cabals of the two rivals and hoped through the dissensions of their political enemies to resume the reigns that had been struck from their own hands  Parliament prorogued  The supplies being granted and the public business in some measure finished the Queen came in person to the house of lords on the ninth of July In her speech from the throne she made no mention either of the house of Hannover or of the Protestant succession Her fears from the coming of the Electoral Prince were dissipated But her resentment was not yet abated She told the two houses that her chief concern was to preserve the liberty and the religion of her subjects and to secure the present and future tranquillity of the kingdom That to attain these desirable ends her parliament ought to shew the same regard for the just prerogatives of the crown and for the honour of government as she had always expressed for the rights of her people  Journals July  Having finished this speech she ordered the chancellor to  prorogue the parliament to the tenth of August Men who ascribed to some design all the measures of Anne put various constructions on a prorogation which was not so suddenly expected Those who argued with most decisiveness on this subject attributed the measure to the manifest decline in the health of the Queen They affirmed that a dropsy under which she laboured increased from day to day That the ministry had their reasons for wishing that parliament might not be sitting at her death Besides that their projected schemes now demanded all their time and their care  Hannover papers July    Open rupture among the ministry  In reasoning in this manner mankind must have supposed that the ministry were united by the same principles and the same views Nothing however could be more contrary to truth than this supposition The chief servants of the crown were divided between two irreconcilable rivals men obstinately resolved on each other's destruction During the sitting of parliament the animosities between Oxford and Bolingbroke were in some degree restrained by their common fears Their mutual friends established from time to time a temporary reconciliation between those rivals for power But when the parliament was prorogued they observed neither moderation nor common decency in their contests The first could bear no equal in the Queen's favour The latter was resolved to yield no longer to a superior They descended into altercation personal reflection and mutual accusation The lordtreasurer made no scruple to declare that he could produce evidence that Bolingbroke was a determined Jacobite Bolingbroke on his part openly affirmed he had proofs in his hands that Oxford was in the interest of the Pretender Though the allegations of neither seem to have been well founded they had both the misfortune to be believed  Ibid    Immediate cause of their quarrel  Though the difference in their characters and a perpetual struggle for power had rendered the treasurer and secretary irreconcilable enemies a late incident in parliament was the obvious cause of their present fury A few days  July  before the prorogation the lords took under consideration  the trade to Spain and the WestIndies as lately settled by the treaty concluded at Madrid This examination was suggested by the lordtreasurer now secretly in the interest of the Whigs to procure the fall of Bolingbroke The Queen had reserved for herself the fourth part of the assiento or contract for negroes This share was privately divided into sixteen parts Five were designed for the lordtreasurer five for Bolingbroke four for Lady Masham and two for one Arthur Moore the agent of the junto in this affair  Hannoverpapers July  The Earl of Oxford perceiving the dangerous state of the Queen's health sacrificed an uncertain interest for certain revenge In the course of the examination he made himself a party against his associates in spoil He joined those lords who insisted to hear the Spanish merchants against the treaty  Ibid  He encouraged an address to the Queen requesting her Majesty to apply to the use of the public her part of the profits of the assiento contract Bolingbroke dictated an answer that gave great offence to the lords Neither he nor the Lady Masham could forgive the treasurer for a measure which in hurting their interest had deeply wounded their pride  Concert between  This incident hastened the fall of the treasurer But it was far from being the sole cause of his disgrace Though Bolingbroke had failed in his project of bringing Marlborough into office in the preceding winter he never lost sight of that object During the whole session he is said to have held a correspondence with the Duke whose only objection to the present men and measures was an irreconcilable aversion to the Earl of Oxford That minister by his suggesting no difficulties in any measure was a servant calculated to please a weak sovereign that was always haunted by political fears He had therefore obtained a dominion over the Queen which neither the arts of Bolingbroke nor the influence of Lady Masham could remove The demand of the writ made by the envoy of the house of Hannover was one of these few incidents that had raised any appearance of spirit in the mind of Anne Bolingbroke had the address to persuade her that this measure was privately promoted by the Earl of Oxford His cabals with the Whigs his vehement  professions to the Electoral family his mysterious conduct which she had now for the first time remarked confirmed the insinuations of Bolingbroke She therefore resolved to dismiss a servant whom she could no longer consider in the light of a friend  MSS passim    Bolingbroke and Marlborough  Bolingbroke on the other hand humoured the Queen in all her prejudices He suggested to her that to pay any attention for the future to the house of Hannover was incompatible with her service  Hannoverpapers July  Her resentment had placed her in the scale of the Pretender as far as she was permitted by her own timidity and jealousy The principal object of Bolingbroke was to perpetuate his influence that of Marlborough to regain his former power The first knew that he could not support himself alone after the removal of the lordtreasurer The latter had no objection to his entering into any measures should that minister be removed from the cabinet The views of both were turned to their own interest Should the Queen live and continue her favour for the Pretender they would probably have paved his way to the throne Should she happen to die before matters were ripe the Duke had established an interest with the family of Hannover that might preserve his friend Though no decisive proofs of their intrigues can be NOW produced a probable conjecture may be made They designed perhaps to serve the Pretender by the means of Sweden The ambassador of that kingdom made no secret of his expecting REAL assistance through the means of Bolingbroke from the British court and he openly expressed his wishes that the Pretender were already arrived  Ibid July    Their views  THE Duke of Marlborough assured of the projected disgrace of Oxford hastened to Ostend to embark But he was detained there for a fortnight by contrary winds In this interval of suspence the difficulty which Bolingbroke found in forming the shew of a ministry was the cause of the delay in the treasurer's fall His own object was to continue secretary of state to command all the foreign correspondence He was however to dismiss Bromley his colleague in office and to place the seals in the hands of Sir William Wyndham The treasury  was to have been put into commission The Earl of Anglesea was to have been at the head of the board  Hannover papers July  But either some of these men declined the offices allotted for them by Bolingbroke or he himself became undecisive through the weight of his own power He however resolved to remove the Earl of Oxford and to trust the rest to fortune On the twentyseventh of July when the treasurer came to court he was deprived of his staff He was however permitted to fall gently from his high station being suffered to retain all his other offices  Ibid    Dismission and character  The character of the Earl of Oxford has been described in all its singularities as the incidents arose But the throwing into one view its most striking features may give a more complete portrait of the man The talents bestowed upon him by nature were neither extensive nor obvious and these seem to have been little improved by education though he has been called a patron of learning and of learned men His whole progress in literature was confined to that slight knowledge of the dead languages which men intended for public life generally bring from school He neither understood foreign languages nor wrote with any degree of elegance his native tongue In the disposition of his mind he was reserved distrustful and cold A lover of secrecy to such a degree that he assumed its appearance in mere trifles fond of importance without any dignity of manner so full of professions that he was always deemed insincere In his public measures he was rather tenacious of his purpose than either firm or resolute in his conduct yet much more decisive in the means of annoying his enemies than in those calculated to gratify his friends With a facility of temper that could deny no request but with a defect of mind that could bestow nothing with grace he offended the disappointed and even lost those whom he served The disposal of offices which gives influence to other ministers was a real misfortune to the Earl of Oxford He often promised the same place to five persons at once and created sour enemies without making the fifth his friend  of the Earl of Oxford  But if the Earl of Oxford was not remarkable for striking virtues he had the good fortune to be free from glaring vices Though undecisive in the great line of  business he was not subject to personal fear Though thoroughly ambitious he was a stranger to haughtiness and pride Though persevering in his opposition to his enemies he was not in his temper revengeful and though he made no scruple to tempt the honesty of others with money he himself cannot be accused with justice of the least tincture of avarice In his public measures he can never deserve the character of a great minister There was a narrowness of sentiment a vulgarity of policy and even a meanness in his conduct that frequently excited the contempt of his best friends In his private intrigues for power in his dextrous management of two parties by whom he was equally hated in his tempering the fury of the Jacobites in his amusing the vehemence of the Whigs in his advancing the interests of the house of Hannover when most distrusted by themselves and their adherents he shewed a considerable degree of address and political knowledge The nation owed to a defect in Oxford's mind a greater benefit than they could have derived from a minister of more splendid talents Had he been possessed of the pride inseparable from great parts his resentment for the ill usage which he experienced from the Whigs and the agents of the house of Hannover might have induced him to defeat the Protestant succession and bring about those very evils of which he was unjustly accused  Observations  In a country where freedom prevails extensive talents are far from being the nearest path to the possession of power Their prior condition must place mankind in the line of preterment otherwise their abilities instead of being employed by the state become through want of use a burden to themselves The most intelligent sovereign at the head of a popular government is extremely circumscribed in the choice of his servants He must rule his people through the medium of persons whom some accident independent of themselves have fixed in a certain rank in the community But as the advantages which savour ambition are enemies to the toil necessary for improving and enlarging the mind men frequently come to the management of the concerns of a great kingdom with abilities scarce sufficient to regulate the affairs of a private family Hence and not from a dearth of talents proceed the confined systems the vulgar policy  the uniform undecisiveness of public councils A minister instead of moving the whole machine of government suffers himself to be carried forward by its inherent motion and should no accidents happen the praise must be given to fortune These observations may be applied with a degree of justice to the Earl of Oxford who carried into his public conduct all the narrowness of his private character  Consusion in the cabinet  Though the Viscount Bolingbroke had the address to remove the lordtreasurer he was not able to seize the reins which he had struck from his hands Wild visionary and vehement in all his projects he had not foreseen difficulties or he was found incapable to surmount them when they came During three days of anarchy and confusion in the cabinet the minds of men were agitated with the vicissitudes of hopes and fear The Queen herself in a dangerous state of health before had increased the violence of her distemper by the agitation of her spirits Having assisted at a council of her principal servants in the night of the twentyninth of July she became perplexed beyond measure at their differences in opinion and want of decision The usual discharge from an imposthumation in her leg was stopped  Aug Death of the Queen  The gouty matter translating itself to the brain threw her into a dozing insensibility in which she expired at Kensington on Sunday the first of August about seven of the clock in the morning In a transient interval of her lethargy she delivered the treasurer's staff to the Duke of Shrewsbury who had been recommended to that high office by such of the privy council as were assembled upon the occasion at Kensington  Her person and character  Thus died Anne Stuart Queen of Great Britain and Ireland in the fiftieth year of her age and thirteenth of her reign In the person she was of a middle stature and before she bore children wellmade Her hair was dark her complexion sanguine her features strong but not irregular her whole countenance more dignified than agreeable In the accomplishments of the mind as a woman she was not deficient She understood music She loved painting She had even some tasse for works of genius She was always generous sometimes liberal but never profuse Like the rest of her family she was goodnatured  to a degree of weakness Indolent in her disposition timid by nature devoted to the company of her favourites easily led She possessed all the virtues of her father except political courage She was subject to all his weaknesses except enthusiasm in religion She was jealous of her authority and sullenly irreconcilable toward those who treated either herself or her prerogative with disrespect But like him also she was much better qualified to discharge the duties of a private life than to act the part of a sovereign As a friend a mother a wife she deserved every praise Her conduct as a daughter could scarcely be excused by a virtue much superior to all these Upon the whole though her reign was crowded with great events she cannot with any justice be called a great Princess Subject to terror beyond the constitutional timidity of her sex she was altogether incapable of decisive councils and nothing but her irresistible popularity could have supported her authority amidst the ferment of those distracted times  INDEX  A  ABHORRERS  and petitioners two political parties when and how they commenced i The former persecuted by
