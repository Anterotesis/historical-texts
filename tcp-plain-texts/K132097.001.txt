 APPEARANCE IS AGAINST THEM IN A SERIES OF LETTERS IN THREE VOLUMES BY THE AUTHOR OF EMILY HERBERT OR PERFIDY PUNISHED  VOL I  LONDON  Printed for THOMAS JONES at his Circulating Library  BridgeStreet Westminster  M DCC LXXXVI  Just Published  EMILY HERBERT OR PERFIDY PUNISHED  THREE VOLS PRICE  s d  APPEARANCE IS AGAINST THEM  LETTER the First  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  Warwick  WHY all this distress my kind Harriot why so much anxiety on your Isabella's account I hoped my last would have convinced  you I am by no means so unhappy as your fears would persuade you no doubt we have suffered  severely suffered  the unexpected change in our situation is certainly a very mortifying circumstance but remember my dear we are not the first would to heaven we might be the last who have been ruined by that destructive vice 'twas my poor father's only foible do not then let us be too severe on his memory nor are we Harriot left quite destitute as you suppose far from it my Orlando's commission is alone sufficient to maintain him as a gentleman had he no more but  he has moreafter paying all my father's debts and sorry  sorry  am I to say they were mostly what is falsely called debts of honor we find a reversion of near two thousand pounds What is this you will perhaps ask when compared to the noble estate he has lost at the gaming tablenothingyet Harriot how many no less worthy than ourselves are there at this moment who would look upon even our present situation as enviable 'tis by reflections of this nature I endeavour to reconcile myself to my fate and thank heaven  I am  reconciled to itO spare then my dear Harriot  yours  on the memory of my unfortunate father I know they are the effects of your tender affection to me but they hurt my feelings I can pity I can lament his situation this I can allow  you  to do but indeed you must spare your censures on a conduct which though faulty a daughter ought not to condemn alas he suffered most severelyhis agonyhis remorse in his last moments would have pierced the most flinty heartOrlando's behaviourbut no words can do it justice'twas great'twas noblenot a murmurnot even a sigh escaped him for his  own  fate all his feelings  were for the sufferings of a father whose failings he pitied and wished to forget  he  Harriot has indeed a degree of manly fortitude to which your poor Isabella has no pretensions my resignation proceeds rather from an indifference for the superfluities of life from a happy flow of spirits which has ever led me to look on the bright side of the picture and let me add which should indeed have been first mentioned a firm persuasion that the Almighty never wholly forsakes the virtuous nor lays heavier burdens on any of his creatures than they are able to bear What  have I then to fearpovertybe it so far be it from me to believe all who are destitute of riches are miserablenor can I be deemed absolutely poor having such a brother as my Orlandohe maynay he  must  rise in his profession if merit can entitle him to it and though that does not always follow yet a very superior degree of it is seldom wholly overlooked and such is hishave I not a kind affectionate friend too in my Harriot who I am positively certain will love me more truly now if possible than in my days of prosperityadversity is justly said to be the test of friendship I am under no apprehensions for the loss  of yoursthose who may now look cool upon me I have pride enough to despise and thus we are quitsit will shew me their real value and that let me tell you is gaining no inconsiderable knowledgeAre you convinced my dear Harriot that I am not so much to be pitied as you have hitherto kindly feared believe me happiness is an imaginary blessing at least 'tis in the mind we must seek for it not in those outward trappings which wealth bestows and can  only  bestow I am very much persuaded I shall find myself as thoroughly satisfied and content nay as vain of my  charms too in a neat linen or muslin gown as ever I was when adorned with more costly attire indeed I have somewhere read that beauty when unadorned is adorned the most'tis a doctrine I am now determined to adopt and who knows what may yet happen if that maxim may be depended on my days of conquest are yet to begin that is to say I am to be more capable of it than everI feared you see you should fancy I had lived to nearly my nineteenth year without having done any execution and humbled as I am felt my pride alarmed at such an ideathank heaven  however I am setting out in my new plan of life with my heart perfectly at easeno small consolation that let me tell younot so my darling Orlando and that pains it indeed more than any other wound it could have receivedhe has  now  I fear a hopeless passion to struggle with beside all his other misfortunesyou are no stranger to his atachment to the lovely Caroline nor her wretch of a brother's rooted aversion to minean aversion founded on his superiority they were fellow collegianshe there conceived that envy for his superior talents and the universal  esteem he met with from every creature himself excepted and by some other trifling circumstances which has since occurred of which you have seen many proofs it has from that period been his constant endeavour to do him every injury in his power though till now he has met with few or no opportunitiesand there is nothing more certain I firmly believe than that  Forgiveness to the injured does belong  They never pardon who have done the wrong  Now  I say he has it amply in his power to mortify the amiable  object of his aversion since Caroline is till of age wholly in his power then indeed she may chuse for herself and I have every reason to believe her choice is already made but till then she cannot marry without the wretch's consent this however is not the worst time would of course remove this obstacle but the scene is changedmy Orlando's sentiments are of a nature so delicate that I am fully persuaded he will or rather has from the moment he knew he had no longer a fortune to offer worthy her accceptance given up every hope of possessing the mistress of his tenderest  affections Sir John will therefore be again disappointed in his hopes of mortifying him for never will he put it in any woman's power to suspect interest could have any influence over him The lovely Caroline I well know would rejoice in thus having it in her power to restore the man of her heart to that affluence from which he has so unhappily fallen indeed I can hardly form an idea of a greater gratification than that must be to a noble mind except being able like Orlando thus to sacrifice all his prospects of felicity to his ideas of honor'tis the pangs which I am sensible at this  moment wrings his generous heart that pains mine most in this our fallen stateall other ills I can look forward to with tolerable fortitude but where my brother's peace of mind is concerned I feel most severely 'tis only while reflections on this subject occur that my heroism forsakes me 'tis then I mourn our loss and the little probability there is of his ever being so happy as he justly deserves to be or as my affectionate heart could wishfor alas we may truly be stiled orphans Since I know not one relation we have in the world on whom we have any possible claim my poor father  had no brothersmy amiable and ever to be lamented mother had but one and he died when Orlando and I were infants at least we have every reason to believe so as we have never heard of him sinceOn Providence Harriot we must place our trustbut had we hundreds of relations are there any on whom we could or ought with so much confidence to rely surely there are not for they though possessed of millions might behold our wants with an eye of indifference all our hopes of sharing their wealth might possibly be disappointed for 'tis not those who possess most who are always readiest  to bestowbut in putting our trust in Providence we not only do our duty but cannot fail in being rewarded either in this world or a betteryet alas my dear Harriot this I fear is in general a last resourcecertain it is your poor Isabella has no other I fear if I had you might not have found me capable of making so many pious reflectionsI dare not too minutely enter into the scrutiny conscious that 'tis much easier to preach than practiceof this however I am absolutely certain that the sentiments I have expressed are such as I ought most firmly to believe and though my  faith may be weak I trust it will never wholly faildo not be shocked my dear Harriot when I inform you where to address your next letter forget as I endeavour to do the elegant mansion in which I formerly enjoyed the pleasure of your correspondence reflect only that your pleasing epistles will now be doubly dear to me robbed as I am of so many other sources of satisfactiondo not suffer a tear to drop on it in remembrance of the past 'tis fruitless a thousand things may yet happen to cheer my present prospects I do not despair and why my good girl should you  Let me find in your next your usual vivacity  that  will help to restore mine indeed for my Orlando's sake I will do my utmost not only to  appear  but really to  be  chearful not for worlds would I give him one moments uneasiness nay in this and only this case would I deceive him and if possible persuade him I am more resigned than 'tis in nature to beyou have not I am sure forgot our worthy teacher at Mrs Mason's she was ever extremely partial both to you and your Isabella our governess was of a more haughty more forbidding cast of course Mrs Bellmour  was our favoriteto what can all this possibly tend cries my Harriot what has Mrs Bellmour to do with the address you was talking ofa great deal my dearshe has lately left our school and has now a house in London where she has half a dozen young women constantly employed in embroidery and other elegant works she has a very numerous acquaintance amongst people of fashion and I hear has great business in that line her house is an excecding good one in an airy situationno shoppray let that console youwith her I have determined to reside for a time  my pride forbad my continuing in the country I dreaded the pity of my former acquaintance and trust I shall never require it as it is one of the least pleasing of all consolations and for that reason I fear given so freelyIn town I can live as retired as I please and what is still better enjoy my Orlando's society dailyhe is now my only protector could I then do better than take up my residence near himMrs Belmour is a woman of family of a fine understanding well bred and accomplished our situations are in some degree similartrue there is this difference she though as  I said of a good family never had hopes of a fortune Her father was a younger brothermarried against the consent of his friends was never pardoned and died when she was an infant she was of course brought up without higher views than she has attained to perhaps her father's misfortunes might deter her from entering into the state of matrimony be that as it will she never did though she has certainly been a fine woman in her daywith her I doubt not I shall find myself very commodiously situated my faithful Fanny begged to continue with me indeed I had no thoughts of  parting from her but when she saw all the other servants dismissed she feared it was to be her fate also she is a good creature and I believe sincerely attached to me indeed having lived in our family from a girl I can hardly doubt itnor is this desire a small proof of itMy dear Orlando wished me much also to retain my own manbut this I at once declared I would not consent tocould I possibly think of putting him to an expence for a gratification I could so easily dispence withno Harriotfar far rather would  I  make shift with the bare necessaries of life than encroach on his  generosity'tis for his dear sake too I chuse to live retired in London I am an absolute stranger I mean to continue soReading music drawing and needle work with sometimes his loved company will abundantly amuse me thank heaven my mind is not such a blank as that I should like too many others of my sex be compelled to  kill  time instead of using it to rational purposes Lord help those insignificant souls who find every moment of it heavy when not engaged in dissipationmuch indeed are they to be pitied and many  many  such there are in  this small town'tis now I think full time to bid you adieu when I am settled in my new habitation you shall hear from me againin the mean time be under no apprehensions for me I have made up my mind All will do mighty well Continue to love me and believe me  Ever your affectionate ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Second  Same to the Same  London  HERE I am my dearest Harriot and I assure you very comfortably settledcomfortably you cry shocked at the homely phrasebut why shockedyou have been so long accustomed to think of your Isabella as enjoying every elegance every luxury of life that the idea of being reduced  to the mere comfortable it appears I suppose a mighty  uncomfortable  expressionnow I on the contrary by casting my eyes around me and viewing the thousands who every moment pass my windows visibly destitute of  even that  blessing think 'tis no small mercy considering that another unlucky cast of the dice might have put me on a level with the most wretched'tis by reflecting in this manner my dear Harriot one finds consolation in fact I have lost nothing essentially necessary to happiness were it not a truth how very  very  few in this world have any pretensions to  itfew I mean in comparison of those who are even in a far worse situation than I am at this moment have I not a kind affectionate brother a friend no less tenderly attached to mein short I am determined to bid defiance to adversity I will bear it not only with resignation but if possible cheerfully which I am positively certain will strip it of half its horrors no more condolence then no more fruitless repining let us remember this misfortune was brought upon us by a  father  a kind an indulgent though an imprudent one be his faults and failings forgot and may I ever reflect with gratitude  on the thousand benefits we have received from hima good education well informed understanding sentiments we need not blush to acknowledge these Harriot we owe to his paternal care but for those instructions I might not have been able as thank Heaven I now can to look back without a sigh to those ample possessions once oursnow in the possession of others perhaps less deservingwhy wonder at the fall of a private family'tis a fate from which even the greatest empires are not exemptbut let me farther convince my kind Harriot I am not an object of pity by giving  her a more minute account of my situation I found Mrs Bellmour's house infinitely more  elegant  yes  elegant  than I had any idea of I have three apartments which we will call my drawing room dressing room and bed chamber more than that number I did not aspire to in my father's house 'tis true my second is not quite so spacious as my former one there but for that very reason is now preferable as it is more suitable to my circumstancesthe furniture is all chintzmy dear Orlando has supplied me with a few well chosen books I have my harpsichord my materials for  drawing and as for all sorts of elegant works have only to step down to Mrs Bellmour and there I may at all times see and copy the greatest varietyshe is delighted with the honor I have done her in making choice of her house and pays me as much respect as if she were a stranger to my misfortunes she has no other lodgers though she has another set of apartments as good as mine which she can spare but has made a point of taking no person who is not particulaly recommended nor is she very anxious about it as she is in a fair way to make a fortune in a few years by her business  now tell me honestly have I not great reason to bless Heaven that I still enjoy so many comfortssurely I haveyou'll perhaps tell me I am excluded from all society or at least from such as I have hitherto been accustomed to'tis very true and society is undoubtedly the first satisfaction in lifebut though I had a numerous acquaintance it by no means follows that in their company I found what  I call  society'tis in my opinion a thing no longer understood 'tis still like friendship much talked of but where do we find itnot at public places not at card parties  society according to my ideas consists in rational conversation with sensible well informed peoplewhere are they to be met with that there are many such I make no doubt but what avails ita man or woman of superior understanding makes no better figurenay I am apt to think a worse figure at a public place or card assembly than one who can only talk of the weatherthe fashions the opera or the last new playand where does one meet any soul but at places of this nature not in London so my loss you see is not great in that articledo you Harriot in  your conscience think they understand the matter much better in the countryI do notduring the few months people of fashion spend there do they not to the utmost of their power live exactly as they do in townwhere then is society to be foundI say 'tis wholly abolished and in its stead we have only an eternal round of insipid dissipation in which as I said above the fool makes just as good a figure as the man of senseI never passed a winter in town except oneand upon my honor I never was so tired of any six months since I was born yet I was then in the first company  nay admired too as a beauty that circumstance one would think might have kept one awake but I declare to you I have found on many occasions more use for my fan to conceal a yawn than for any other purpose how often have I been one of a large circle of belles and beaux for hours together without hearing a single sentence uttered worth attending to yet all affect amazing vivacity and a laugh is frequently heard when not a soul amongst them if asked what gave rise to it could possibly tell'tis as somebody very justly observed when talking on this very subject  all laugh and no joke  this is societyand this I am likely to be debarred of if I have not it in my power to mix as formerly with the beau mondeam I to be pitiednot one bitbesides my new situation has the charm of novelty to reccommend it and that let me tell you is no small matterdid ever mortal you cry hear any one so eloquent in praise of adversityperhaps notbut 'tis my way Harriot to make the best I can of a bad bargainand after all should I be one jot the happier had I given myself up a prey to despairhad I instead of thus endeavouring  to forget the past tormented both you and myself with unavailing lamentationI doubt the fact my dearmy Orlando too who makes it my study to keep up my spiritsshall I not do all in my power to assist him in his kind purpose I should little merit his affectionate attention if I did nothere comes the dear creature I hear his voice belowfarewelllet me hear from you soon and believe me  Ever your ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Third  Same to the Same  London  WHAT an angel is Caroline my dear HarriotOh she has proved herself the most generous the most exalted of womenyou may remember that I broke off abruptly hearing my Orlando's voice enquiring for meread that my Isabella cried  he giving me a letter and confess that the charming Caroline is as I ever believed her a noble minded creatureI have his permission to send you the following copy of it that you may yourself judge whether she does not justly merit the encomiums I have given her  To COLONEL ROCHLEY  WERE I not thoroughly acquainted with the sentiments of the amiable Colonel Rochley I might perhaps have scrupled to give him this proof of my partiality nor am I ignorant  that there are many of my own sex and perhaps of yours who would condemn me for it but I have examined my heart it acquits me and I am in this instance determined to rest satisfied with its decisionto the change in your situation I give not a thought on my own account yourself not your fortune was ever the object of my attachmentI know your worth and I think Orlando I know also that you have a tolerable opinion of mine but I also know the delicacy of your sentimentsthese if I do not mistake your character will lead you to fancy  it incumbnet on you to give up all thoughts of the poor Caroline because truly 'tis no longer in your power to produce a rent roll equal to hersthis may for ought I know be deemed mighty noble mighty generous and all thatbut it does not my good friend accord with my ideas nor do I mean to let you so easily off you haveat least you told me so a thousand timesI say you have freely and voluntarily given me your heart I have long looked upon it as my propertywith your heart I made not a doubt that I should in due time be able  to prevail on you to give me also your hand nay so certain was I of it that I had privately made a vow never to bestow mine on any other of your sex a pretty scrape then I am likely to be brought into should you make a point of playing the hero and for the before mentioned ridiculous reasons give me upI know my very  amiable  and  affectionate  wretch of a brother would see us both perish rather than consent to our unionbut if you will condescend to waitlet me see how longO just four months and three weeks I shall then be my own mistress  and as I am very unwilling to break my vow and still  more unwilling  to seek out for a new lover I am when that happy period arrives determined to sue you for damages should you presume to break yoursand I promise you I shall claim a pretty considerable sum nor will it I think be denied me the loss of my heart let me tell you is no jokeI accuse you of the theft deny it if you canprepare then either your defenceor what will give me infinitely more satisfaction agree to compromise the affair by keeping it and permitting me to  retain yours in return on this condition I here make a second vow that on the day I shall become of age I will offer you my lilly hand in holy matrimony think of what has been said and don't play the simpletonyou must have a very short memory if it is necessary for me to inform you that  I am Most truly and affectionately your CAROLINE WESTBURY▪  P S  Do not fancy I have formed the above resolution without mature reflectionnoI am  too wise too prudent for that believe meI have weighed the matter as thusin one scale I put myself▪ and my twenty thousand poundsin the other your worship your colonel's commission with all your accomplishments of mind and personwhen behold my Ladyship's scale instantly kicked the beam nay so very unequal were they that I am positively certain could I have thrown fifty thousand more into it there it would have stuckthe duce is in it then if I shall not have the best bargainadieu  You have now I presume read the delightful girls letterwhat do you think of her my dear Harriotis she not a spirited charming creaturethere are those she says who might possibly condemn heryou I trust are not of the stupid number for my part I adore her for her ingenuous candourshe knows Orlando's whole happiness centers in hershe knows his worthwho then but the most ridiculously prudish shall presume to say she has not acted like an  angel  yes an angel I repeat for alas I fear 'tis not like the generality of our sexwell my dear Orlando  cryed I when I had read her epistlewhat says your heart to this proof of your Caroline's  folly  folly Isabellacertainly replied Imust she not be a very weak creature thus to persist in loving you merely for those good qualities which no reverse of fortune can rob you ofwhat are those compared to an estate of two thousand a yearnothing indeed I believe said he in the estimation of too many of your sex Isabella but my engaging Caroline has a mindto play the fool cryed I interrupting him thats allbut seriously continued I do not now my dear  brother carry your sentiments of honor or generosity too farthere are obstacles enough to your felicity already let it be your business to remove not by a false delicacy to add to them remember the lively affectionate Carolines happiness is at stake as well as yourshas she not freely confessed itshe has cryed he in raptures and I am the happiest of mortals yes Isabella I will look forward with hopehope replied I nay with certaintyonly beware of that wretch her brother I know no villainy of which he is not capable suffer him to believe you have  now  given up all thoughts of his sister be cautious how you conduct yourself beware that none of your letters fall into his hands I have no fears on your account my dear Orlando 'tis for your Carolines safety I tremble wholly in his power as she is at present who can say what his hatred to to you and his sordid avarice may prompt him togo my beloved brother go and answer the charming girl's letter as it deserves but as I said before take care that 'tis safely conveyed to herhe left me the happiest of beingsyet a thousand delicate scruples damped his joy but I  think conscious as he is that her felicity as I told him depends upon him he will conquer themthus my dear friend all my sorrows are at an endmy Orlando will yet be happycan I then fail to be compleatly soimpossibleno more repining no more reflections then on the past who can say what a day can bring forth this has been a happy one to morrow may be no less so  I trust it will And am ever your's ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Fourth  Miss LENOX TO Miss ROCHLEY  Northampton  YOU are persuaded you say in one of your letters I shall love you with more sincerity now in your adversity than ever I did in your days of prosperitywhy really my dear Isabella the thing  is mighty easily accounted for though 'tis not exactly according to the modern ideas of friendship have I not by this change in your situation had an opportunity to discover a thousand good qualities in you which but for  that  neither you nor I might ever have suspected you possessedhow could it ever have entered my head that Isabella Rochly born and bred in affluence accustomed from her infancy to all the luxuries all the gratifications wealth could bestow should when unexpectedly robbed of them all continue the same lively chearful creature she ever waswho I say▪  could have believed itwell may you say you bid defiance to povertywith a mind as yours evidently is formed what as you say have you to fearall this is greatis noble my dear Isabella yet though convinced your sentiments are right  rational  and all thatI cannot help feelingaye and fearing toobut you will tell me I am a Job's comforter'tis very truethe fact is had you as every other mortal in your case would have done filled your letters with sighs and tears with ahsand ohs as long as my armI should have taken  he other side of the question and  have endeavoured to console you by every means in my powerbut your astonishing resignationyour truly  christian  philosophy leaves me nothing to sayI can only wonder and admireand love you most affectionately  Having therefore nothing more to do let us chat as usual  on a late event merely a  on an unpleasant dreamand first for the charming Carolineno no believe me I am not one of the stupid number who condemn her if any such there be which I very much doubtat least if they are acquainted with Orlando Rochley I pronounce the thing  impossibleone there ishim I had forgot but he is a wretch not worth naming her brother I meanbut though not worth naminghe is an object to be feareddo you know Isabella I am assured he is at this moment in treaty with one of his gambling companions who has taken it into his head to fancy himself capable of being desperately in love  th the dear girl Sir John has lost a very considerable sum of money to himI believe at the last Newmarket races this sum he has promised to give up on condition he receives the h  nd of Caroline in its stead  and also to accept fifteen thousand instead of the twenty to which she is entitled on the day she is of agethis I am informed and from pretty good authority is the bargain these two worthy Baronets have struck judge you whether they will leave any stone unturned to accomplish their vile plot Sir John 'tis well known is over head and ears in debtSir James Henderson rich as a jew and though incapable of a real attachment spares no expence to gratify his passionsor the whim of the momentI tell you this my dear Isabella not that I have any apprehensions  farther than the trouble they may occasionthank heaven we live in a land of liberty a woman cannot be forced into matrimony against her willand of all women Caroline Westbury is least likely she has more sense more spirit than half the fellows in England consequently they will make but a bungling hand of the business but as I said above they may torment and give her a great deal of troubleyou may do as you please in regard to informing your dear brother of what I now tell you I think it may not be amiss knowing ones enemies one may the better guard  against their machinations indeed being master of her generous heart I think he has nothing to fear he has only to have patience and as you say all will do  mighty well  but why my dear Isabella this very retired plan of yoursI see no reason for it why not enjoy a little  society  I was going to sayforgetting you had proved to me 'tis a thing no longer existingperhaps not according to your antiquated notions but you in your turn forget that all one has to do in this world of ours is to take things as we find them while thus indulging your  simple  plan the only simple one by the  way you ever formedthe world will take it for granted you are weeping and wailing your misfortunes unable to bear this reverse with proper resignation take my word for it they will never be kind enough to impute your conduct to the real motive they will be glad to find a defect in a character hitherto deemed perfect disappoint them my dear Isabella convince them your happiness depended not on so fickle a being as  Madam Fortune  nor could her ill favoured daughter  Miss  rob you of your felicitygive them not such a triumph my dear girl but let them see  you are still the lively chearful companion you ever were I know you have but few acquaintance in town but if amongst those there are any whose company can afford you an hours amusement why not enjoy itI am not without hopes of spending a few months in London this winter if I do emerge you must for that I shall spoil your philosophical plan is most certain so you may as well drop it at once my love to Orlandolet me hear from you soon and tell me whether you have obeyed my commands remember me also to our old friend  Mrs Bellmour and doubt not the affection of your unalterable  HARRIOT LENOX  LETTER the Fifth  Same to the Same  Northampton  I WRITE this in haste be not too much alarmed my dear IsabellaI wish I could spare you the anxiety these lines I well know must occasion but I cannot answer it to my heart were I to conceal what so nearly concerns your peaceSir John I am informed  by one who is acquainted with all his motions has by some base means or other seen your brothers letter to Miss Westbury I suspect he also knew of hers to himbe that as it will he is outrageous and swears he will shoot the colonel through the head rather than she shall give herself and fortune to a  beggar  that was his elegant phrasebut above all to the man he detests'tis said but this I cannot affirm he set off for London yesterdayaccompanyed by that wretch Hendersondid they possess one spark of honor between them I should be less apprehensive but  they do notthey dare notI am certainthey have not sufficient spirit to demand satisfaction as  it is called  like gentlementhey are too conscious of his superiority openly to avow their designs his courage is too well known for thatthey are mere bulliesand cowards of courseall I mean by telling you this is that you may caution your brothercharge him to be on his guardI really hardly know what it is I fearbut such is my affection for you both that even the shadow of danger makes me tremble should Sir John really be gone to town they may chance to meet and  who can say what may be the consequencewarn Orlando then to avoid himI have time for no more lest my well meant intelligence should come too lateheaven bless you both prays your affectionate  HARRIOT LENOX  LETTER the Sixth  Miss WESTBURY TO Lady BELL SYDNEY  WestburyHall  YOUR ladyship is impatient you say to hear how I have settled matters with my gallant colonelwhy my dear Lady Bell had the affair been left to my management it would have been  happily settled long ago for I think I could in spite of his heroics have prevailed on the dear creature to have taken me for better for worseyet such are his obsolete notions of honorgenerosity and other  equally absurd  ideas that I should I believe in my conscience have had enough to dobut I told you nay I sent you a copy of the epistle I wrote him on hearing the situation his imprudent father left him inthe loss of  his  fortune never gave me one hours concern on  my own account  persuaded  mine  is abundantly sufficient to satisfy any two reasonable people  and reasonable I have ever found him except in this instancehere truly his pride steps in can he think of giving a beggar to the woman he adoresthat is the burden of his melancholy songhowever as I was saying I believe my eloquence might have prevailed had I been at liberty to argue the case with him as I wished but behold my good for nothing brother has found means to stop all farther proceedings at presentand by such means as none but a being like himself actuated by the basest of all motives could have stooped toohe naturally suspected the change  in Colonel Rochley's situation could make none in my sentiments my attachment he knew was built on a more permanent foundationhe therefore made several attemps to discover my thoughts on the subject but to no purpose well did I know  his  and therefore chose to disappoint himhowever he was too artful for mehe bribed my maidshe knew I had received a letter from him though I never make people in that line my confidents as too many  Misses  dobut having a better opinion of her than I find she deserved made no secret of itshe knew our attachment  she knew his hand writingand in short when questioned on the subject at the same time eyeing a purse of goldshe answered as he wished and promised I presume to get him a sight of the letterhow she contrived this I know not unless by a false key to my cabinet as I think I could not be so careless as to leave it openbe that as it willa few days ago while at breakfast with my  Tyrant  he with rage malice and a thousand other  amiable  passions strongly depicted on his expressive countenance produced the said epistle at the same time abusing us both  in a language which wou'd have done credit to an inhabitant of BillingsgateI bore the storm with most provoking philosophic calmnessthis he poor soul  could not bear  we females my dear Lady Bell have a thousand times more command of our tempers than these lords of the creation as they style themselvesso you have really been mean spirited enough cried he half choaked with passion to offer yourself to this felloweven so replied I and pray brother what can you possibly have to say to itit cannot surely interfere with your happiness you  fond  as you ever  were of me cannot marry me yourself what in the name of common sense then is it to you who does provided he is a gentleman a man of worth of characterhe is neither cried he he is a dndstop my good friend said I interrupting himno naughty words I beseech youyou knowyes well do you know Colonel Rochley is all I have described but I also know not only that you have long entertained sentiments for him which do no great credit to your understanding but I know also the causehis evident  superiority not  his inferiority Sir John is  the crime you cannot pardon he has made you look rather simple on more occasions than one 'tis no secret my good brother you know it is notI might not now or ever have reproached you with it had you not thus compelled me to it in order to justify my partiality by proving to you he has no other fault  even in your eyes  surely he is not answerable for the misconduct of his father more than I am for that of my brother his familyhisdnhis family cryed hewell if you insist upon it replied I with a  provoking smile  I fear I can't help it but pray  spare the colonelmy dear Lady Bell I actually thought he would have beat meand perhaps I did deserve a box on the earto cut this matter short continued I and to save all farther altercation on the subject I now declare to you freely and candidly I am fully determined to give my hand to this beggar the very day I can also present him with it my fortunetill then I have no such intention nor shall you then be such a cursed fool cried he if I can help it and I think I shall find ways for thatso saying away he bouncedI soon followed in order to lecture my abigail  fully persuaded she had betrayed me if I may call it so though as I never trusted her I believe 'tis not exactly the caseon questioning her she denied the whole but in such a manner that I was fully convinced in her guilt and accordingly dismissed her without farther ceremonythus have I given those particulars you wish to be acquainted with my present situation is none of the pleasantest but thank heaven I am not very apt to give way to despair the time is at no great distance when I shall be at full liberty to act as I think proper teazed in the mean time I expect  to be but have made up my mind to bear it I might no doubt quit our family mansion and take up my residence with some of my friends but it would answer no good purpose for the fact is they one and all pronounce me  imprudent  at least thus to throw myself and fortune away as they call it on a man who cannot  now  make such settlements as I am intitled toI on the contrary tell them he has made all I ever had an ambition forhe has settled his heart upon meI hear his charming sister chose to live in London rather than continue in the country where the misfortunes  of her family will of course be a subject of conversation for agesI think she judged perfectly rightthere too she is more immediately under the protection of her generous noble minded brother Oh how much contrast to mine I am told she resembles him both in mind and personhappy my dear Lady Bell should I have been had it been in my power to offer the lovely girl an asylum with mesuch a companion would have been the most desirable thing in life but my brother's rooted aversion to her whole family puts that out of the question at presentwhen the  happy day arrives that he is no longer my  master  I shall make it my first request to my dear Rochleytill then Imust deny myself that pleasurein spite of the pretty trick that has been played me I shall contrive some means to continue a correspondence with him but there is no hurry we know each others sentiments that is the most material pointand so the matter rests adieu my dearest friendyou see I am in a fair way to be one of the poor persecuted damselsthis comes of  falling  in lovetake care how you my dear get into this unfortunate  scrapeand believe me most truly  Your affectionate CAROLINE WESTBURY  LETTER the Seventh  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  London  A Thousand thanks my dearest Harriot for your friendly intelligence I instantly made my brother acquainted with it who had the  civility  to laugh at our  feminine  apprehensionshow can you my dear Orlando said I make a joke of what to us appears a very serious cause of alarm why my sweet Isabella replied he because fighting is my profession would you then have me like you tremble at the thoughts of a sword or pistolno certainly cried I Heaven forbid had you a man of honor to deal with but who can say what a wretch like Sir John may be capable ofI vow I should not wonder if he had you assassinatedno no Isabella when you form plans of that nature you must lay the scene in Spain or Portugal there  we hear of adventures of that nature though I'll be sworn where one story of the kind is true fifty are false depend upon it you have nothing of that kind to apprehendcertain it is I should be sorry on my Carolines account to have a fracas with him nay for her sake and for yours too my dear Isabella I will not seek an occasion of meeting him as far as I can with honor I will even avoid itbut if by chance we do meetand he should presume to insult me by look or word why my dear I shall endeavour to teach him better mannersbut take my word for it  he has too much regard for his person to put it needlessly in dangerI know him of oldhe has adopted Hudibras's maxim  Great are the perils that inviron  The man who meddles with cold iron  but should it come to that be assured he will be wise enough to consider that  He who fights and runs away  May live to fight another day  But he who is in battle slain  Will never rise to fight again  was it possible Harriot to forbear laughing in spite of my fears at the idea this gave me of his antagonist  I confess his agreeable vivacity put them almost to flight I begin to think the creature will not have courage to face him for according to Shakespeare "conscience makes cowards of us all" and I am sure his must accuse him of envy malice and a thousand other diabolical passionsI again begged my brother for my sake to be on his guard he smiled saying he was on the point of obeying me as he was just going to be on guard at the Toweryou chuse to be witty my dear Orlando said I but though this duty will prevent me seeing you for some time I rejoice  to hear you  are obliged to be there  as I think the wretch will not have courage to follow you to a place so capable of making a vigorous defencehe now kindly kissed my cheek bid me fear nothing be chearful amuse myself the best way I could till he saw me again and left me much more at ease than when he entered certain of his Carolines attachment master of her invaluable heart he is as happy as this world can make him  You do not my dear Harriot altogether approve my retired plan of lifeI have made no vows  to seclude myself from the world should I ever meet with a temptation to enter into its amusementsfar from it I am of too sociable a disposition for that but I think decency propriety not to mention my own feelings forbid it at presentyou forget Harriot 'tis not many months since my dear father's death and however we may have suffered by his imprudent conductI lament it most unfeignedlyanother reason I have too which you have also forgotshall Ican I do you think take advantage of my Orlando's generosity and run into any unnecessary  expences forbit it heavenno no HarriotI will content myself for a while with such amusements as I can enjoy without robbing him of the little he is now master ofa time may come when he can better spare it and I am not so old as to fear a decay in my charms before I have an opportunity to display them to the worldin the mean time assure yourself I am not merely  comfortable  but as happy as a queenI am upon my honor and as a proof of it I am just going to sing and play Seaton Cliffa new song my Orlando  brought me this morning he tells me I shall like itadieu  Ever yours ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Eighth  Miss WESTBURY TO Lady▪ BELL SIDNEY  WestburyHall  I HAVE since you last heard from me my dear Lady Bell met with a trifle which gave and very foolishly half an hour's uneasinessnot more for a moment's cool reflection convinced  me 'twas an artifice of my brothers and his friend Sir James Hendersonbut take the particulars  A few days ago we had dined  tete a tete  he was in better temper than usual not a word of the colonel was said'tis a subject  I  never start though of all others the most pleasing to me he chose to be very eloquent in praise of Sir James was  astonished  I did not see him in the same favourable light so fine a fortunesuch great connections c and then so distractedly in love with me so constant in spite of the cold  reception his addresses met withI owned it was very astonishing as I was reckoned a girl of taste but there was no help for it some people were blind to their own interest and I supposed I was one of the unlucky numberhe did not I believe greatly relish my manner of expressing myself but said no more  On his quitting the room I observed a letter lying by the chair he had sat onit was openI cannot say I felt any sort of curiosity to view the contents nor should I had I not by mere chance seen the name of Rochley  I am now persuaded he had dropped it in that open manner that I might see it sensible nothing less would tempt me to peruse it and in this instance he really did discover some share of sagacity  Here follows a copy of the delectable scrawl I own as I said before I was weak enough to be fluttered for about half an hour  Dear Jack  You may make yourself perfectly easy would I could hope the news  I now send you were likely to make me sowho knows but it may your charming sister may possibly when convinced as she soon will be that her favoured colonel is unworthy the honor she does him treat me with less severityhe is at this very time paying his addresses to a merchant's daughter in the city she has fifty thousand pounds in her own power and they say her heart fell a sacrifice to his red coat and cockade some time ago at Almack'sshe freely told him soand made him an offer of that convenient sum on condition he wou'd take her into the bargain  to this he very wisely agreed and they are to be married without farther ceremony next weekWhat I tell you you may depend upon as a fact for I had it from the girls brother father she has none and he curses her for a foolso you may make yourself easy no fear of his being grafted into your family  now  One thing I make a point of not a word of this to your sister I wish not to be the first who shall inform her of it she may perhaps fancy I am mean enough to triumph on the occasionI do notI own I cannot help being  highly pleased because I flatter myself were he once fairly out of her reach she may chance to cast a favourable eye upon your humble servantOne thing is certain if she does notcurse me if I care a straw if all the rest of her sex were blindOnce more mind what I sayno tatlingI know you will be bursting to tell herbut if you door at least if you give me as the author of the intelligence I'll blow your brains out the next time we meet my officiousness as she will call it can only give her a worse impression of me than  she has already and that is needlessso be dumb I charge you she will hear it soon enough from others  Yours JAMES HENDERSON  How do you like it Lady Bellartful and really better manufactered than I believed either of them capable ofI hope you will own it was enough to stagger one at the first readingI confess it did mefor after all men are but men  However I am fully determined not to believe one word of the matterand as I love to do things openly and honestly I have treated my colonel with a copy of it inclosed in a few lines from myself civilly desiring he will himself tell me whether there is any truth in it as I would sooner take his word than that of any other personat the same time adding my opinion which as I have already told you is that 'tis an abominable falsehoodI did not think it quite convenient to tell  him  who was the eloquent author of this epistle  that  might  have led to disagreeable consequencesbut what you will grant is still a better joke I have taken no notice of having found it though that it was dropped on purpose for me to pick up is as clear as noon dayI could expire with laughing at the thoughts of my having thus disappointed the dear creatures by pretending to know nothing of the matter  When we met at teaI found my brother was brimfull of expectationI affected to be more gay more lively than usualyet took care not to over act my part I  was humming a favourite air when he came in and continued it he was visibly in the fidgetstried first one chair then anotherbut all in vainI made the tea with all imaginable composureand at last finding I would not break the ice and of course fearing the matter would come to an untimely end if he did not lend a helping hand to restore it  Caroline said he looking very like a fool pray did you find a letter I have dropped one some where and cannot for my soul find it  You see my dear Lady Bell I had nothing for it but to tell an absolute  lye  mincing the matter would have spoiled the jokeno replied I I really saw noneno cried he shocked to death at the very idea that his plot should have miscarriedsurely you must for I am pretty certain I had it in my pocket at dinnerare you equally certain said I you have not lost it out of doors O quite so replied he it must have fallen in the dining room while taking out my handkerchief 'tis very likely said I I will ring and order a servant to look for it it may be there still  perhaps or some of them may have picked it upI hope it is of no great importance in case it is not to be soundthis was an aukward sort of a question was it not my dear Lady Bell he felt it to be so and looked more foolish if possible than before and waved giving an answerI rung the bellJohn step into the dining room and see if you can find a letter there your master has dropped one and fancies it was in that roomaway went John  I need hardly tell you the poor epistle was not to be foundmake  farther enquiries said I amongst the servants some of them may have got itlost it cannot be  in the  house and unless there were bank bills in it I can hardly suppose any of them can have motives for not restoring itI hope it contained none brother  Such was the command I had of my countenance my dear friend that I saw plainly I had fairly taken him inno you never saw mortal in so ridiculous a situation'tis impossible to conceive itwhat was now to be done here was a fine well concerted plot blown to air he had sense  enough to see that telling me the contents would never do'twas too lateI should immediately suspect he had dropped it on purpose or why not have told me the mighty news at  dinner  if he could do it nowthis argument might have no weight had the business been of an honest nature▪ I am sensiblebut here the case was different he  felt  I should not believe one word of the story if told simply without all the coroberating circumstances contained in the unfortunate epistleit was to do it justice wrote most plausiblySir James begging  he would not  inform me of it for instance  how  now  tell it without disobeying that injunction and of course robbing his poor friend of the merit he hoped to acquire by that very  injunction  This was a dilema not to be got over  What then could the silly soul do better than let the matter drop and this he very prudently didwhether this disaster will cure them of ploting heaven only knowsyou see not a doubt remains with me that it was a plotthough I have not yet had it cleared up by my dear Rochley  This I hope to have in a few days as I have taken effectual care neither  my  letter nor  his  answer shall again fall into my brothers handsand he I fancy fearing his answer to his confederate might by some unlucky chance fall into mine has thought proper to set off full speed for London to tell the story in person  I would give something to hear their dialogue on the subject poor Sir John can make but a very so so figure on the occasion his friend will set him down as a mere marplot though I think I have  the best title to that appellationfor 'twas certainly I that marr'd it  I flatter myself the story will divert your ladyship and so I leave you that you may laugh without interruption  Yours ever CAROLINE WESTBURY  LETTER the Ninth  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  London  ALAS my dear Harriot your fears your kind apprehensions were but too well foundedI may now say I am as wretched a being as ever existedcompleatly wretched'tis possible the dreadful  news may e'er this have reached you but the particulars cannot and well I know the melancholy story will be told by my loved brothers enemies with every possible aggravation for 'tis known only to themthe particulars I mean alas the event can be no secretI am almost blind with weeping and can scarce see what I write yet what other consolation is now left melittle did your poor Isabella think when she last wrote to you in such good spirits that she was in a few days to be reduced to such deplorable distress you have seen me bear the loss of fortune without  a sigh still blessed with the tender affection of a beloved brother I found nothing wanting to my happinesshe was all the world to mebut I have perhaps seen him for the last timeOh my Harriot do I live to write it I cannot proceedmy heart is torn with anguish it bleeds for the misfortunes of my amiable Orlandoyes my dear Harriot 'tis still for him I mournall his prospects of felicity are now for ever blastedfate has done its worst he has mortally wounded the brother of his Carolinejudge then the condition I am in at this distracting moment  Sitting some days ago at my harpsichord in order to practise another new song the dear creature had sent me that I might sing it to him when next he calledthe following letter was brought me  It pains me more than I can express to give my tender my affectionate Isabella one moments uneasinessthink then my beloved sister what I now suffer while thus obliged to tell her I fear it may be long e'er I see her againOh that I could find words to soften the sad story for gladly would  I at the instant I am under the cruel necessity of wounding your feeling heart also pour into it the balm of consolation but my wishes are vainknow then my Isabella your brother has woundedand alas 'tis seared mortallythe brother of the woman he adoresneed I add more to convince you I am wretchedbefore you receive this I shall be on my way to the continent I fly my beloved Isabella more for your dear sake than my ownthe idea of leaving you friendless I could not stand I fly in order to preserve a life which for your sake and for yours only I think  worth my care had there been any witness to the transaction on whose honor I could have depended I should have had little or nothing to apprehend but there unfortunately was notSir John and his friend Henderson were alone privy to ita few persons however gathered round us when the deed  was done  and the former then in dying accents had the baseness to declare to them I was the aggressor and his murdererthis horrid this false accusation Sir James endeavoured to confirmwhat then had I to hope they might have considered that as there  were two to one the story appeared improbable but in the confusion a scene of this nature naturally occasions this reflection did not occur or father was not attended to for I offered it in my justificationhappily for me the night was exceedingly dark and while they were employed in conveying him to the nearest surgeon I made my escape and instantly getting into the first carriage I met with drove home put up a few things and accompanied by my faithful Frederick jumped into a post  chaise and set off for Dover this I write at the first stage my beloved Isabellayou shall hear from me again when safely landed on the other side of the waterkeep up your spirits my dear sister exert that fortitude you have on a former melancholy crisis given such evident proofs you are possessed ofremember it will be the greatest consolation I can now enjoy to hear you do not sink under this afflictionGod bless and preserve you my Isabella and grant we may yet meet again in happier days prays your  ever tenderly attached and truly  Affectionate Brother ORLANDO ROCHLEY  Happily for me the worthy Mrs Bellmour came with it herselfI had no sooner cast my eyes over the distracting contents then I fell lifeless on the sopha where I satbut my grief you will naturally conceive so need not attempt to describe what I felt at that terrible moment or what I still feelI am unable to  write any more at presentalas why should I what can I say that will not distress  you  as well as myselfI am dying with impatience to hear again from my poor OrlandoMrs Bellmour informs me this moment the vile Sir John is still alive though there are no hopes of his recoverywretched as he has made me I yet for my beloved brothers sake earnestly pray that he may survive it Oh Harriot▪ pity me and join your prayers to those of your  Ever affectionate but truly unhappy▪ ISABELLA ROCHLEY▪  LETTER the Tenth  Miss WESTBURY TO Lady BELL SIDNEY  LONDON  I Would sooner have acknowledged the favor of your kind your affectionate letter my dear Lady Bell had it been in my powerbut what with the dreadful shock I have met with and  the hurry of my journey it was impossibleI know you will forgive the seeming want of attention at a time like thisI arrived in town sooner by some hours than I believed it could have been done indeed I never quitted the carriage but drove night and day such was my impatience to see my poor brother Alas I no longer remember his unkindness his present situation alone engrosses all my carehe still lives my dear friend and the surgeons tell me he may linger for some time but they give me no farther hopeshe appeared sensible of my attention in  thus hurrying to town but shocked me beyond expression by the ungenerous manner in which he mentioned Colonel Rochleyungenerous I must call it since no power on earth will ever be able to persuade me he could act in a dishonorable mannerthis my dear Lady Bell is a point from which I never will recede in whatever light the rest of the world may look upon the unfortunate affair  He is my brother 'tis truebut this circumstance alone shall not tempt me to do injustice to the  most amiable the most worthy of men though alas that man can now be nothing to me my hopes of happiness are for ever destroyed whether he is innocent or guilty but still I will be justOh noit was not in his nature to take undue advantage of even his greatest enemy  never  shall they persuade me of itwho but the prejudiced can give credit to so cruel an aspersion nay were not appearances strongly against must I say my unfortunate brother surely they werehe was accompanied by his friendColonel Rochley was alone when they metthis even they  themselves cannot denybut they add he was the agressor he sought the quarrel by first insulting Sir Johnnever will I believe itno his regard for me I am well assured would have prevented that I know it perfectly nay I am no less certain he would on my account have put up with more from him than from any man breathing I know it wellgreat must have been the provocation that could tempt him to an action which he could not but be sensible must put an end to all his hopes of obtaining the hand of your Carolineso that whatever happenswhether my  brother lives or dies he is as far as the nature of the shocking case will admit justified in my opinionOh how my heart bleeds for his amiable sister my dear Lady Bell what must her distress be at this cruel moment did I but know where to find her I would fly to offer every consolation in my powerindeed I would let the illjudging world say what they pleased my own feelings would acquit me my heart tells me it would be an act of humanity and I would trust to its dictatesbut I have not the smallest clue to guide me to the lovely mourner She may by this  time possibly have left Londonmy brother asks for me I hear I must bid your Lordship adieu  Ever yours CAROLINE WESTBURY  LETTER the Eleventh  Colonel ROCHLEY TO ISABELLA  CALAIS  DURST I but flatter mysel this would find my dearest sister tolerably recovered from the shock I am but too sensible my last letter would give her half my  distress would be at an endafter a few hours sailing I arrived safely here and safely I may remain here till my unfortunate affair can be happily adjusted let this console you my beloved Isabella during my absence long it will not be I hope happen what will I have friends and powerful ones too who will do all they possibly can to serve me I am therefore under no apprehensions for the consequences your Orlando's honor has never yet thank Heaven been called in question nor will it now  I have sent over the  real state  of the case to my worthy General I  have received many proofs of his friendship and regard and am certain he will not now withdraw themthe ungenerous account Sir John wished to propagate be assured my Isabella will not gain credit my character is too well known so is hisI say not this by way of reflection on him I scorn the thoughtI mention it merely as a matter from which you my sister may draw some consolationhe still lives I find by a letter I received yesterday from a friendwho can say but he may yet recoverindependent of my own safety it would give me unspeakable  satisfactionbelieve me I am not one of those who can however honorably be the death of a fellow creature without remorse I my dear Isablla though conscious the fatal deed was done in  selfdefence  feel it a very serious matter and trust  that  circumstance will acquit me in the sight of Heaven in the opinion of the world I cannot doubt but it willlet me hear from you immediately I will give you my address before I seal my letter let me have the happiness of hearing you have exerted yourself on this occasion that you bear the trial as becomes  one of your excellent understanding tell me also whether Mrs Bellmour is as attentive as anxious to render your situation agreeable and convenient as she was when I left youand tell me trulyI will not knowingly suffer my Isabella to be treated with disrespect▪I think she is incapable of itI have been thinking I know not how justly that it might perhaps save you some trouble were you to change your name till my return what I mean is the friends of Sir John may possibly be indelicate enough should they by chance find out your place of residence to  make some impertinent inquiries about methis may notindeed 'tis not very probable it should happen but I would to the utmost of my power guard my beloved sister from even the shadow of an insult and I should look upon any enquiry they might think proper to trouble you with in regard to the affair in that light at any rate it can have no bad effects the idea occured to me I therefore mention it though I believe on reflection 'tis quite unnecessary so do as you please my dear  You may possibly wonder how I have been able to write so long  a letter without once naming  Miss Westbury  no longer you see dare I indulge myself in calling her my Carolinethat is a felicity I must now resignyet she is dear infinitely dear to me and must ever be so while I have lifebut though all my fond my flattering hopes are thus cruelly blasted I would not willingly forfeit her esteem I have therefore presumed unhappily circumstanced as I am to write to her that I might as far as is consistent with truth and honor justify myself I have the vanity to believe  she  will not readily give credit to any  report she may hear if any such there are that will throw a stain on my character I think she will do me more justiceeven the word of a dying brother should he dare to persist in his first ungenerous ungentleman like assertion will not I am confident induce  her  to believe I could act dishonourably  I have frequently regretted my dear Isabella that with minds so congenial as yours and my beloved Caroline's you should be strangers to each otheryet alas what would it now have availedyou  would only have been more sensible of her worth and of course have felt your Orlandos disappointment the more severelyadieu my sister my  friend  let me soon receive such a letter from you as you think will give pleasure to the heart of your tenderly attached  And affectionate Brother ORLANDO ROCHLEY  LETTER the Twelfth  ISABELLA TO Colonel ROCHLEY  London  YESI will endeavour to write such a letter as I think will give pleasure to the heart of the most amiable of brothers is there any effort in my power I would not exert to the utmost for this dear  purpose oh noI have recovered the sad shock your former letter gave me indeed I haveI am quite well againeven you my Orlando who give me credit for so large a share of fortitude would be amazed to see how well I bear itare you not pleased with your poor Isabella for this but I am sure you arethrough Mrs Bellmours means I hear daily of Sir John and have at length the inexpressible happiness of informing you he is not only still alive but the doctors begin to have hopesfaint hopes they are I believe but this is something I shall with  the probability of that wished event his recovery I mean be able to bear your absence without repiningfor not for worlds would I have you return till you can do it with perfect safety and this cannot be till he is pronounced out of danger which is yet very far from being the caseat present he has not only his wounds to contend with but a violent fever  occasioned by them they say  alas what will they not say to aggravate the melancholy event indeed Mrs Bellmour tells me should he thus linger for a twelvemonth and dye at the end of it the surgeons may  pronounce them the cause of his deathis this possibleyet it may to be sure bring on a bad state of health which maybut let me not think of itI will believe better things  I rejoice to hear you have wrote to Miss Westburyor shall I say your Caroline yes I will indulge the dear hope that she may yet be yoursshould her brother live who can prevent itand is there not now a  probability  what would I not have given for this a few days agoI mistake the charming girls character exceedingly my dear Orlando if she can so far mistake  yours  as to harbour a thought injurious to your honorshe knows you too welland I must say she knows her brother too well also to take his word foran impossibility  And now let me do justice to my good friend Mrs Bellmour by answering your sweetly kind enquiriesbelieve me she is more attentive more obliging if possible every day I really can never be sufficiently grateful for her tender care of me when I first heard of the sad affair which has robbed me of your dear societyI will now I have pretty well got over the shock confess I thought  it would have killed me so did my truly kind friend I believe and but for such a friend I cannot say what might happenedbut I am now as I before assured you quite well and you see in better spirits than my Orlando expected  apropos  I had almost forgot to answer one part of your dear letter I mean in regard to changing my name for a whileI cannot see any necessity for it that is certainyet two circumstances have determined me to do itthe first because the idea took its rise from my ever kind and considerate brothers care of his grateful Isabella  none but a mind delicate and anxious as yours could have formed one of that naturehad I no other motive that alone would have induced me to adopt the plan the second is as follows  The day before yesterday a person quite a stranger to Mrs Bellmour stopped her as she was going out at the door and she says in an aukward kind of a manner asked the young lady's name who lodged with herpray let me first ask you replied she what is your reason for desiring to knowthe man not being prepared  sor this very prudent question I presume hesitated and was at a loss how to answer itbut again begged she would tell himyou must excuse me Sir said she I do not think myself authorized to do it without her permissionyou are a stranger to me and of course to the lady since you do not even know her nameI have several young people in my house and consequently cannot be certain which of them you mean if your business is of a nature necessary for any one of them to be acquainted with you must contrive to inform  her of it in a proper mannerbut I am persuaded you are mistakenindeed I am not replied heshe left him but instead of going out as she intended very prudently returned into the house in order to warn her family to be on their guard in case he should make any farther enquiries or knock at the doorshe came up to me to tell me thinking it might afford me a moments amusementnow though I have very little reason to fancy he really did mean meyet 'tis possible he might these are my two reasonswhich tho' both trifling when taken seperately  yet when joined they amount to something and so my dearest brother address your letters for the future totoany Miss you pleasenot so neither'tis necessary to fix on  one  though no matter whatMiss Beverly then let it be  I shall tell Mrs Bellmour and give the latter circumstance only as my reason for the changeshe I well know will approve whatever has prudence for its motive and as I am situated one cannot be too cautious a stranger as I am and  now  deprived of my dear  protectoradieu my beloved brother may Heaven preserve and soon restore you to your  Ever affectionate Friend and Sister ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Thirteenth  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  London  REjoice with me my dear Harriot I have had a second letter from my Orlando he is well is safe and writes in as good spirits as a feeling mind in his unfortunate situation can be supposed to dowhat a brother am I blessed  with how kind how affectionately attentive to every thing that concerns his poor Isabella I might name ten thousand instances but one shall suffice at present nor need I indeed have mentioned this since you my Harriot know him wellbut it is in some degree necessary to clear up what is to follow or what in fact may as well go before  Know then that for a while th at is to say till his anxiously wished return you are to address your letters to me by the name of BeverlyYou are I presume amazed but I am going to explain  the matter he tells me that while reflecting on my present unprotected state it occured to him that it was possible Sir John's family should they discover where I was to be found might be indelicate enough to trouble me with enquiries about him and as he kindly wishes to guard me against every possibility of being insulted he proposed my taking another name during his absenceNow though I think there is no probability of this happening yet as it was an idea that occured to my Orlando whose sentiments are more delicate more refined in  regard to what concerns our sex than any mortal I knowI could not refuse to gratify him not that he makes a point of itby no means on the contrary he afterwards says he is persuaded it is unnecessary adding do as you pleaseI will certainly do it as it can have no disagreeable consequences and may save me the trouble he so kindly apprehendsMiss Beverly then my dear Harriot must for some time be your friend and correspondent  I have the satisfaction to tell you I hear Sir John it is thought may  yet get over itbut he is still exceedingly ill if he does recover it must be a work of time he had lived a very irregular life his constitution by no means a good one and rendered still worse by every kind of intemperance yet should he unfortunately die within the twelve month I am told it may be imputed to that miserable  ren contre  how dreadful is this my dear Harriothow very hard upon my darling brotherbut as I perpetually say let us hope the best  And now for want of a more important subject to fill the rest  of my paper let me tell you I have lately had a peep at some of the  beau monde  whose society you so much wish me to enjoya peep I say for it was no moreMrs Bellmour is busily employed at present in embroidering a trimming for the birthdayit is for a Lady Beningfield a young and handsome widowI never beheld any thing more truly elegant I often sit by her while she is at work at it by way of spending an hour agreeably when tired of my book or musicA day or two ago I was thus engaged when the fair widow's carriage drove to  the doorI would have retired but unluckily they were in the passage before I could reach it the street door being open a servant having that instant came in of course I must have met them thereI returned to my seat very easy about the matterin she swam most affectedlyfollowed by another Lady and a Beaua Belle without a Beau you know my Harriot would be as aukward asasI leave you my dear to find a similethe beautyelegance and expressive countenance of her fair friend struck me exceedingly never did I behold so much sweetness  yet a great deal of vivacity in any mortal before no affectation no airsthe other made up of both to her very  finger ends  now for the Beau cries my Harriotwhy I must do him the justice to say he appears if I may judge from so slight a knowledge of him as if he deserved a more manly appelationexcept my dear Orlando I never beheld so fine a figure nor a man so perfectly gracefulmighty fine cries Harriot upon my word Isabella you have a pretty knack at description  Must I add Harriot your poor friend seemed to attract some degree  of their notice in spite of the  enchanting  the  divine  trimming as her ladyship every moment called it The young lady gazed upon me in so particular a manner yet with so much respect and sweetness in her manner that I really fancied she was endeavouring to recollect me believing she had seen me beforehow true this is I know not but in that light her glances struck meas for his lordshipfor he was a lord I soon foundhe of course could not overlook a female who has been reckoned something more than tolerable I caught him peepingso alas did Lady Beningfield and many a  gentle tap on the shoulder she gave him for not paying quite enough attention to the dear trimming twenty times did she call him an insensible wretch and other such phrases peculiar to the  bon ton  she too once or twice deigned to cast an eye upon me but soon changed them to a more pleasing object by turning to a large mirror which was placed most commodiously before herall matters settleda thousand orders given they at length took their leave her ladyship crying  come creature why don't you lead me to my carriage  for the Beau was unfortunately  stretching his neck over Mrs Bellmour's shoulder to get a last look at your Isabellano small share of vanity you'll cryI only relate facts my dear and as I am not overwhelmed with the variety of my amusements chose to make the most of this subject and so farewell  I am going to write to my beloved Orlando and must now bid you adieu not however till I have told you I am ever most truly yours  ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Fourteenth  Miss WESTBURY TO Lady BELL SIDNEY  LONDON  THANK heaven my dear Lady Bell my brother is rather better the fever is abated but he is still in a miserable way the doctors however say he may possibly live I am willing to believe  the best though alas I fear this is not their real sentimentsI must tell your Ladyship an incident which happened a few days ago'tis ridiculous I grant but has nevertheless made such an impression on me that I am tempted to doubt my sensesLady Beningfield called on me the other morning and insisted on my going with her to an embroiderers to see a trimming she has ordered for the birthday She is no favourite of mine you know however as I had been so long confined to a sick room I thought a drive for an hour might raise my spiritsLord Templeton as usual was with her and  is absolutely if possible more irresistable than everyou see I can be just though I have given  my heart  to another perhaps had her Ladyship not known of my attachment she might not have asked my company since she fears every woman who presumes to cast an eye upon him has a design upon his heart which she is determined to conquer or die in the attempt  entre nous  I am fully convinced he does not care three straws sor her but let her Ladyship make this flattering discovery 'tis no affair of mine  All this is nothing to my story however and my story is a very  absurd one when you get at itto the embroiderers we went my dear Lady Belland there had my Rochley's name been Beverly I should not hesitate to swear I saw his beautiful sister the resemblance struck me so forcibly I could not keep my eyes off the elegant creature in my life I never beheld two beings so strikingly alikethe same expressive dark eyes the same lovely mouth the very dimples that so enchantingly play about it the teethin short I am very ridiculousher name as I said above I found on somebody speaking to her is Beverly and so ends  my  story  not so hers or I am much deceived for be she who or what she will I will lay my life his Lordship is fairly caught'tis no wonder that's certainhe had no sooner cast his eyes upon her than farewell common sense not a rational answer could either her Ladyship or I get from him though many an  inrational  question did she torment him withhe looked and sighed and sighed and looked againso did her Ladyship I believe but with very different sensationsshe smiled she ogled she chid but could make nothing of him he was indeed as she perpetually  calls him a stupid wretch which being  interpreted  means neither more nor less in the mouth of a  very  fine lady thanyou are a divine fellow  On this unfortunate occasion however I fear she meant it literally and to mend the matter we were no sooner seated in the carriage than he cried what a lovely creature was that we have just seenWhere for heavens sake asked Lady B affecting to look out of the window by way of making us believe she fancied he spoke of somebody in the streetWhere answered his lordshiphow my  dear Lady Beningfield can you ask that question Surely you must have observed her at Mrs Bellmoursnot I truly returned she I observed nothing lovely there I give you my word except my trimming that is a fib thought I and so thought somebody else I'll be sworn Did you too overlook the charming girl Miss Westbury said he turning to me Surely you could not as you had no trimming to engage your attention Indeed I did not my lord nor can I believe her ladyship could do it either replied I she is joking depend upon it not I truly cried she  brideling I see no joke in it except that some people are very apt to discover beauties where others can find nonethe truth is I suppose you are both joking for I can hardly imagine such a prodigy as you describe could be there and I not see her There was now I recollect it a tall starched looking thing stuck up there who gave herself all the airs of a beautyaye and all the graces too Lady Beningfield cried his lordshipAt this instant the wheel of the carriage by some unluckyindeed I should rather say  lucky  means or other got entangled in that of a  coach passing by us She took this favourable opportunity to be amazingly alarmed screamed flung herself into his lordship's arms and there fainted  as it were  he could do no less you know my dear Lady Bell than be alarmed also the matters were soon adjusted between the honest folks without but not so within in vain I held my  eau de luce  to her nose in vain my lord said and did all that lord could doI cannot say I was under any violent apprehensions nor he neither I believe however as one must get the better of a fright sooner or later she at length thought  proper to open her languid eyes faintly exclaiming "Where am I"  I had very near replied as Scrub does in the Beaux Stratagem to the same question on a similar occasionHere my lady since this was certainly the stratagem of a Bellemy lord in pity to her  weakness  forbear to renew the subject we were on before conscious I believe  that  had more to answer for than the poor wheelThey soon after sat me down and what then passed between them I know not but I fear his lordship's  thoughts would be too much engrossed by the charming Miss Beverley to permit him to play the lover with a good graceindeed I never believed he wished to be looked upon in that light by Lady B yet the world says it is to be a matchthat she wishes it is abundantly clear but I cannot bring myself to fancy he has any such intention The lady is handsome no doubt and rich tooso is hefortune can be no object to himbut these widows my dear Lady Bell are a dangerous set of beingsthere is nothing impossible she may draw him in perhaps'tis  certain there has long been a violent flirtation between them she is artful and doats upon him to distractionhow it will end heaven knows if Miss Beverly has as I verily think she  has  made a serious impression on him he cannot do a wiser thing than to make the most of the  fracas  above mentioned 'tis a fine foundation for a quarrel he has only to persist in doing justice to that lovely girl and the business is done  I would give the world to know who she is and how she came there for she appeared to be at home  yet 'tis utterly impossible she can belong to Mrs Bellmourimpossibleher air her manner in short her whole appearance forbids an idea of that natureAdieu 'tis ridiculous to think any more about it  Yours ever C WESTBURY  LETTER the Fifteenth  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  London  WOULD you believe it Harriotyet after all why not Did I not formerly tell you my days of conquest were yet to comeLord Templeton has actually been to call upon Mrs  Bellmour by way of ordering a waistcoat c cbut in fact as she tells the story to make a thousand enquiries about your friend Isabellaand pray said I a good deal startled you may well believe fearing he had looked upon me in a light it hurts my pridemy delicacy to think ofwhat answer did you my dear Mrs Bellmour make to his impertinent questionsHad his lordship replied she made any that merited that term be assured my dear Miss Rochley you should never have been shocked by the knowledge of them from meI beg your pardon my good  friend said I I ought indeed to have done you more justice than to believe you would have mentioned a subject you thought could give me offence but those sort of gay men are but too apt to take liberties with our sex especially if friendless and unprotected as I am 'tis too true replied she but his lordship I believe though young and a man of fashion as 'tis called has fewer of the fashionable vices than most of his sexI know his character well 'tis a most amiable one I never indeed saw him till the morning he first came here with Lady Beningfield but much  I have heard in his praise I do assure you  I own I was a good deal surprized at the manner in which he spoke of you as I have heard he is paying his addresses to Lady B this circumstance made me more reserved in my answers than perhaps I should otherwise have been▪Ah you could not be too much so my dear Madam cried I piqued at what she mentionedfor however polite however specious his behaviour all the enquiries he could make  that  being the case must be looked upon as  very impertinentI am hurtexceeedingly  hurt  by them I confess and must intreat you to answer no more of themhear me patiently said my worthy friend pray do not condemn either his lordship or me till you have heard all that passedagain I begged her pardon and promised to be attentivehe spoke in raptures continued she yet with the highest respect begged I would tell him who you were of what family and a thousand things of that natureto this I replied your name was Beverlythat you was a young lady of fashion and  familyparticular business had brought you to town and as I had had the charge of your education you had done me the honor to prefer my house to any other being a stranger in London  And now my lord continued I permit me in my turn to ask your reasons for wishing to know those circumstances Miss Beverly is at present under my care she is extremely dear to me and I am of course deeply interested in all that concerns herI honor you for it replied he you have certainly a right to question me in your turn  I can only say my motives are such as even the charming Miss Beverly could not justly condemn I was struck with the uncommon elegance of her person her graceful mannerI will be very candid my lord said I finding he now made a pausein talking of my accomplished friend your lordship uses the language of a loverpardon me if I take the liberty of observing this is a  language  I do not think you can use with propriety on this occasionI am not to learn my lord that the world talks loudly that you are paying your addresses toLady Beningfieldno man so circumstanced  shouldI will be candid also cried he interrupting methe world is very much deceived if that is its opinion be assured had that been the case I would have spared you the trouble I have now given youof this I give you my honorso saying my dear Miss Rochley he took his leaveand I hope you will now acquit me of having been guilty of any impropriety  Indeed I do replied I I ought to have known you were incapable of it my dear Mrs Bellmour yet you cannot I think wonder  that a circumstance of this kind should surprise me nor after all can I conceive what his lordship means I wish it may not be something relating to my dearest brotherbut that is absurdI forget he believes my name Beverlyshe smiled at my speech saying  indeed Miss Rochley were you not more void of vanity than thousands are who have smaller pretensions to it you could not I think be at a loss to guess  he was as he says and I will take upon me to affirm he says truth struck with your beautynothing could be more naturalhe has not  the character of a libertinehe has a very large fortuneis his own masterthe enquiries he has made are a convincing proof to me that the wound you have made in his heart is not a slight onewhether it will heal without his applying to you for a cure I cannot say though I rather doubt itO no fear of its proving mortal replied I men are not so vulnerable in these days as they were formerly the arrow must be tipped with gold that now hopes to killCould you my good friend have added with truth when kindly  giving him the catalogue of my virtues that I was also possessed of considerable fortune I have the vanity to think he might have been seriously wounded but as it is be under no apprehensions depend upon it his lordship will recoverbesides what's to be done with his present flame Lady Beningfieldnay cried she he gave me his honor the world was wholly mistaken in regard to that matterthat she is violently in love with him I know from pretty good authority indeed 'tis one of those secrets known by the whole town but I firmly believe he has  no more thoughts of marrying her Ladyship than he has of doing me that honorwell said I be that as it will I am no less certain he will not marry me and so let the matter restall I intreat is my dear Mrs Bellmour in case he should take it in his head to mention me again that you will be cautious you know I am particularly circumstanced at present I wish to avoid making any new acquaintance till my brother's returnand especially under a feigned name  Thus Harriot have I laid this important business fully before you  happy was it I gave you my opinion of him in my last letterwere it still to do you might fancy the picture a little flattered in return for the portion he has bestowed upon meadieu my dear let me hear from you soon do not give me cause to think you more negligent than formerly  Your's ever ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Sixteenth  Miss LENOX TO Miss ROCHLEY  Northampton  WOULD you believe it cries my dear Isabella this lord has actually been making a thousand  impertinent  enquiries about meno to be surewho could  be simple enough to credit so great an improbabilitythe story wont go down with me child  Isabella I am more than half out of my wits with joymy father knows your adorer  well  I will not tell you what he says of him lest you should be out of your wits too  in case he makes no more inquiries  why my dear creature he is of all men upon the face of the earth the very being formed to make a woman  too happy in al  conscience  I die to hear more of him from you I meanI can  neither eat drink nor sleep since I heard of his  impertinence  Mrs Bellmour behaved like an angel in the affairdon't be silly Isabelladon't play the foolthere's a medium in all things one may be  over prudish  be assured his lordship is a man of real honor were I not certain of it I would blot out the last sentenceLady Beningfield will poison you beyond a doubt but that's a trifleshe is the greatest flirt breathingand has made herself tolerably ridiculous about him already but take my word for it he  will never make himself so by marrying herI could treat you with a bit of scandal my dear concerning her ladyship but it would be thrown away upon you as I know you have no taste for it  Pray how is that miserable wretch Sir John is he determined to make a die of it out of mere spite to your brother I believe in my conscience he will at least make the utmost of the disaster though he may perhaps hesitate a little about carrying the joke  quite  so far as deathdo let me hear how  things go on but above all tell me if my lord has had the temmerity to be again  impertinent  adieuI am going a journey of five miles for a dinner don't you think I shall have a good appetite that is one of the many delights of a country lifethe carriage is at the door so fare ye well my Isabella  Yours HARRIOT LENOX  LETTER the Seventeenth  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  London  IS it possibleand does your worthy father really know Lord Templeton and is he indeed such a prodigyI will not be  over prudish  Harriot and say  what is all that to meno I will not for the truth is I am exceedingly glad to hear it in  case of accidents  but before I bestow another line upon him let me tell you I have heard from my dear Orlando twice since I wrote last to youdo not my dear Harriot now look stately and say  I might have heard ten times instead of twice  forgive my too long silenceI own my fault and promise amendmenthe is thank Heaven in perfect health and good spirits his friend the General has promised to represent the affair in its true colours and  is of opinion he has nothing to apprehend should the worst happen yet advises him to stay abroad a while as the safest plan  I am sorry to tell you Sir John has had a return of his fever and is again thought in dangerhe was so well a few days ago that I hear they talked of getting him conveyed by easy journies to the country but all thoughts of that sort are over for the presentHeaven forbid he should make a  die  of it as you call itmost unfeignedly would his death be lamented my dear Harriotnot  altogether on his own account indeed but the consequences would be fatal to my dear brothers hopeshowever I would gladly flatter myself as he has lived so long after the unfortunate  rencontre  he may still get over it  And now for another line or two about this same lord my dearwhat he means Heaven only knows but certain it is he has repeatedly called on Mrs Bellmour imploring her to contrive some way or other for him to see me againthis she said was a favour she could on no account  'twas a liberty she had no right to take with Miss Beverley she was intitled to more respectwould she then indulge him so sar as acquaint him candidly with every particular of the charming girl's situationno certainlywas again her answer she had no authority to do it though of this be assured added the worthy woman the more your lordship knows of Miss Beverly's character the more reason you will have to esteem her since I can from a thorough knowledge of her with truth declare that beauty which seems to have made so deep an  impression on your lordship is her least perfection I have known her from a child my lordI had the charge of her education as I believe I had the honor of telling you beforeshe is descended from one of the most respectable families in the kingdomat least few can boast of a betterbut will you my dear Mrs Bellmour said he only inform me why the lovely creature lives thus retired I can meet with no mortal who is acquainted with her though I have made every possible enquiry for that purpose in hopes I might by that means procure the honor  of being properly introduced to her but all in vainthis astonishes meI will freely own to you Mrs Bellmour she has made a very serious impression on me my heart subscribes to all you have said in her praise I have not a doubt of her worthare you not cruel then my dear Madam thus to deny me an opportunity to be still farther convinced you do her no more than justiceindeed my lord could I gratify your wishes with propriety I wouldI have too good an opinion of you to believe your intentions are dishonourable I will not shock my own  feelings so much as to suppose you would take this liberty with me if they wereI can only add your lordship must have patience I trust the time is not far distant when Miss Beverly will have a lation with her to whom your lordship may without impropriety apply for an introductiontill then I am persuaded she will on no account see any strangera relationyes my lord a near oneand one justly dear to her should he have no objections to your lordship's being introduced to Miss Beverly I think I may venture to sayshe will have none  as he is well worthy that deference she ever pays to his judgment  You alarm me Mrs Bellmouris this so highly favoured relation a young man perhapsshe smiling replied  he is a young man my lord but you need not be so much alarmed as your expressive  perhaps  implies you are  he now begged she would tell him his name where he waswhy absentwhen I expected his returnand in short a thousand silly questions of that nature but to no purpose  I had charged her to be cautious you know and she was most prudently soprovokingly so  he  seemed to thinkand now my dear Harriot let me know your thoughts on the matter alsoas for mine I have not yet been able to bring them into any sort of order certain it is I find his lordship has some times a share in them but in so confused a manner that I can give no account of it'tis possible I may be able to arrange them more methodically by and byone sight of him is not quite sufficient for that purposewere it consistent with propriety  I should have no violent objections to take a second view particularly after reading the character you give of him but it certainly is not so I must as Mrs Bellmour very wisely advised his lordship to do wait till my Orlando's return they may then adjust all the necessary preleminaries in case the wonderful impression my charms have made upon him should not before that time be worn out to make room for some otherLady Beningfield you say will undoubtedly treat me with a cup of poison should I rob her of his heartI vow I never  saw a woman who appears more capable of it but that's a trifle as you sayand so my dear Harriot adieu  Believe me Ever yours ISABELLA ROCHLEY  LETTER the Eighteenth  Miss WESTBURY TO Lady BELL SYDNEY  I Hoped to have left town before now my brother was so much better that the doctors thought he might be removed without danger and wished it as change  of air would have been of service to himbut his fever is returned with violenceHeaven knows what may be the consequence of this relapse  What a miserable time have I had of it my dear Lady Belland what but a continuation of misery have I to expect should he not recoveralas 'tis not the loss of him alone I shall have to deploremy amiable Rochley  oo must be the object of my sorrow for in that wretched case he never can be minebut let me drop the melancholy subject it sinks my spiritswhy should I also sink yours  You may possibly recollect my telling you how violently Lord Templeton was struck with the charms of the elegant creature we saw some time ago at Mrs BellmoursI was convinced her charms had made a very deep impressionI however thought no more of it till calling one day last week to enquire for my brother I saw himand by way of a little chat asked if he had been so fortunate as to get another sight of the lovely Miss BeverleyI have not yet I confess to you Miss Westbury but I would give half my estate could I obtain that happinessare you  serious my lord cried I quite astonished to find him so  very far  goneupon my honor I am replied he with fervorI never beheld a creature so formed to captivate she has absolutely robbed me of my peaceof your heart that is to say I presume my lordwhy in fact I believe the terms on this occasion are synonimousyet 'tis not according to my ideas of loveI never till now could persuade myself that passion could be excited by beauty alone and except that she is beautiful as an angel I ▪know little more of herbut how comes that my lord surely  you might before now have contrived to learn whether her mind is as lovely as her person for my own part I confess I have not a doubt of it for never did I see a countenance so expressive of every thing that is amiable  You are mistaken my dear Miss Westburyit has been my principal employment from that time to this but without successthe only intelligence I can gather concerning the charming girl is from the person of the house where she residesshe indeed talks of her in terms of the highest respect says she had the  charge of her education has known her from a child that she is of a good familybut I am as great a stranger to  her  as to her lovely friend all this may be truenay▪ my heart assures me of ityet still there is something misteriouswhy this retired life in so young a person it is wonderful and creates a doubt which I would give world's to have explained and to be introduced to herthis Mrs Bellmour could certainly do my lord  Oh no this I asked but was refused'twas a liberty she could not presume to take Miss Beverly made a point of seeing no strangers  It is very odd said I yet certainly all this my lord is greatly in the the charming girl's favourno doubt of it she has it seems a relation who is at present absent and till his return has reasons for this reservea relation my lordis it a father uncle brother good Heavensyet it cannot beher name is Beverlywho is this relation where is henone of these particulars could I learn answered his lordship except that he is a young man and this information I got by mere chancebut why▪ my dear Miss Westbury that exclamation what if her name was  not BeverlyO my lord were it not I could lay my life she is sister to my friend Colonel Rochleynever did I in any two creatures behold so striking a resemblanceI could not refrain from scrutinizing her any more than your lordship added I smiling though not merely on account of her uncommon beauty but the astonishing likeness I found between themAh would to Heaven replied he your conjecture was true all my anxiety about what now appears so perplexing would instantly vanish my only business then would be to endeavour to  gain her affections could I but do that I should think myself the happiest of menfortune is no object to me to raise an amiable a deserving woman to that rank she is so formed by nature to adorn would be the sublimest of all gratificationsbut it cannot bemy cruel my lovely enslavers name is Beverlyand I am really my dear Miss Westbury at this moment in a most painful suspence  But pray my lord said I give me leave to ask what lady Beningfield says to this new passionshe at least would persuade the world she is sole mistress of your heart  upon my honor replied he if she is 'tis more than I know for I can with strict truth declare I never had an idea of putting it into her ladyship's possession nay I am no less certain it was in my own till I beheld the lovely Miss Beverly from that hour I confess 'tis rather a doubt with me whether 'tis still in mine or notif your lordship was to ask my opinion of the matter I should pronounce all doubt out of the questionI believe you are right madam yet I own I am unwilling to believe my case quite so desperate till better acquainted with the object of its attachment and how to  manage that I cannot for my soul contriveI am sorry for it I do assure you my lord for both your sakes As I own myself so exceedingly prejudiced in her favour that I think she must be worthy  even  of your lordship's esteem and that is saying a great dealhe gracefully bowed in return for my compliment and bid me good morningand now my dear lady Bell I must wish you  good  night I have sat scribling here till my fingers are cramped  Adieu yours CAROLINE WESTBURY  LETTER the Nineteenth  Miss ROCHLEY TO Miss LENOX  London  MRS Bellmour came up to me this morning my dear Harriot to ask me a question which she was polite enough to say I should absolutely decide as I thought proper  it seems a person to whom she is under some obligations had just sent to her knowing her house was spacious and genteel to ask whether she could conveniently accommodate a gentleman with an apartment in it for a month or six weeks perhaps it might not be lo long as he was only come to town on business which might possibly be settled in a shorter time he wished to be near this family who live it seems in the next street is a man of fortune and not young  How could I you know my dear Harriot make any objections supposing it had really been disagreeable  to me particularly as she was so good as to put it upon that footingnone in the world said I my dear Mrs Bellmour I  can  have none had it been a gay young man indeedbut in that case I well know that you yourself would have been the first to objectmost certainly replied she independently my dear Madam of your being in my houseand pray when is he to comethis very evening he only waits for my answer which I could not think of sending till I had mentioned it first to youBe assured replied I I am exceedingly sensible of your very polite attention  to me on this as well as every other occasionon this she left me in order to send an immediate affirmative to her friend so much for that business  Now Harriot you must know as Lord Templeton and I are not likely to be farther acquainted though to say truth he has done his utmost endeavours towards it I have some thoughts of setting my cap at this old neighbour of mine that is to be he is it seems a man of fortune and should▪ I find it equal to my ambition I will give him credit for all other perfections Are you  not surprised my dear to find me in so flippant a humour I have good reasonthe  vile  Sir John is once more pronounced out of dangerI may now you know venture to abuse him a little though while I believed the  wretch  dying I hope you observed I spared those  flattering  epithets he is going to Bristol by the advice of his physiciansmost heartily do I wish him a speedy recovery but speedy or not my beloved Orlando may now return when he chuses  I have just dispatched this important intelligence to the dear  creature and trust it will not now be long e'er I shall have the supreme happiness to tell you that he is safely landed in Englandyou no longer wonder at my spirits I presumeI am half nay more than half out of my wits with joy and am determined he shall find me married to this rich old soul on his arrival it will be such an agreeable surprise you know Harriotto be sure we shall rather be hurried in the article of courtship but as my▪ consent is ready 'tis the less matter we may make love after we are fettered since we have not time for it before that will be  something new quite out of the common stilePoor Lord Templeton 'tis really a pity but there's no help for it by the by he does not seem to have given up all hopesperhaps indeed he has contracted a habit of calling here in his round of visits for scarce a day passes without his asking Mrs Bellmour how she does and she says how I do alsoThe truth is he made her very considerable offers on condition she would contrive to let him meet me in her companybnt she is not the kind of woman for that purpose unless convinced beyond a doubt his designs were honourable  She has no idea of my submitting to be looked at with a view to see whether he may happen to approve of methis however was my way of expressing the mattermarriage and another pleasant circumstance they say Harriot goes by destinyso if it is to be decreed we are to be united in the holy band of matrimony the thing will of course come to pass without our troubling our heads about it would his Lordship but adopt this doctrine it would save his horses a considerable deal of labour Lady Beningfield also calls here frequently though her  divine  trimming  has been finished some time but she is an excellent customer to Mrs Bellmour yet the latter suspects jealousy brings her ladyship as often as business for she perpetually asks a thousand ridicuculous questions about me evidently wishing to find out whether his lordship has ever seen me again To this you know Mrs B has it in her power to give a satisfactory answer in the negative which of course she doeshappily she does not enquire whether he has made any attempts of that nature taking it for granted I suppose if he had I should have been too much flattered  by so great a distinction to have let him sigh in vain for an interviewSilly creature she knows but little of your friend if this is her opinionAdieu my dear Harriot let me have your congratulations on the good news I send you and believe me as usual most affectionately  Yours ISABELLA ROCHLEY  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
