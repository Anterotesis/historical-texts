 THE WEST INDIAN A COMEDY As it is Performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE BY THE AUTHOR OF THE BROTHERS  Quis novus hic Hospes  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN at GARRICK's HEAD in CATHARINESTREET STRAND MDCCLXXI  PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY MR REDDISH  CRITICS hark forward noble game and new  A fine West Indian started full in view  Hot as the soil the clime which gave him birth  You'll run him on a burning scent to earth  Yet don't devour him in his hiding place  Bag him he'll serve you for another chace  For sure that country has no feeble claim  Which swells your commerce and supports your fame  And in this humble sketch we hope you'll find  Some emanations of a noble mind  Some little touches which tho' void of art  May find perhaps their way into the heart  Another hero your excuse implores  Sent by your sister kingdom to your shores  Doom'd by Religion's too severe command  To fight for bread against his native land  A brave unthinking animated rogue  With here and there a touch upon the brogue  Laugh but despise him not for on his lip  His errors lie his heart can never trip  Others there arebut may we not prevail  To let the gentry tell their own plain tale  Shall they come in They'll please you if they can  If not condemn the bardbut spare the  Man  For speak think act or write in angry times  A wish to please is made the worst of crimes  Dire slander now with black envenom'd dart  Stands ever arm'd to stab you to the heart  Rouse Britons rouse for honour of your isle  Your old good humour and be seen to smile  You say we write not like our fatherstrue  Nor were our fathers half so strict as you  Damn'd not each error of the poets pen  But judging man remember'd they were men  Aw'd into silence by the times abuse  Sleeps many a wise and many a witty muse  We that for mere experiment come out  Are but the light arm'd rangers on the scout  High on Parnassus' lofty summit stands  The immortal camp there lie the chosen bands  But give fair quarter to us puny elves  The giants then will sally forth themselves  With wit's sharp weapons vindicate the age  And drive ev'n  Arthur's  magic from the  Stage  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Stockwell  Mr Aickin

clerks employed at their desks A writing table in the front room  STOCKWELL  is discovered reading a letter  STUKELY  comes gently out of the back room and observes him some time before he speaks  STUKELY  HE seems disordered some thing in that letter and I'm afraid of an unpleasant sort He has many ventures of great account at sea a ship richly freighted for Barcelona another for Lisbon and others expected from Cadiz of still greater value Besides these I know he has many deep concerns in foreign bottoms and underwritings to a vast amount I'll accost him Sir Mr Stockwell  STOCKWELL  StukelyWell have you ship'd the cloths  STUKELY  I have Sir here's the bill of lading and copy of the invoice the assortments are all compared Mr Traffick will give you the policy upon Change  STOCKWELL  'Tis very well lay these papers by and no more of business for a while Shut the door Stukely I have had long proof of your friendship and fidelity to me a  matter of most intimate concern lies on my mind and 'twill be a sensible relief to unbosom myself to you I have just now been informed of the arrival of the young West Indian I have so long been expecting you know who I mean  STUKELY  Yes Sir Mr Belcour the young gentleman who inherited old Belcour's great estates in Jamaica  STOCKWELL  Hush not so loud come a little nearer this way This Belcour is now in London part of his baggage is already arrived and I expect him every minute Is it to be wonder'd at if his coming throws me into some agitation when I tell you Stukely he is my son  STUKELY  Your son  STOCKWELL  Yes Sir my only son early in life I accompanied his grandfather to Jamaica as his clerk he had an only daughter somewhat older than myself the mother of this gentleman it was my chance call it good or ill to engage her affections and as the inferiority of my condition made it hopeless to expect her father's consent her fondness provided an expedient and we were privately married the issue of that concealed engagement is as I have told you this Belcour  STUKELY  That event surely discovered your connexion  STOCKWELL  You shall hear Not many days after our marriage old Belcour set out for England and during his abode here my wife was with great secresy delivered of this son Fruitful in expedients to disguise her situation without parting from her infant she contrived to have it laid and received at her door as a foundling After some time her father returned having left me here in one of those favourable moments that decide the fortunes of prosperous men this child was introduced from that instant he treated him as his own gave him his name and brought him up in his family  STUKELY  And did you never reveal this secret either to old Belcour or your son  STOCKWELL  Never  STUCKELY  Therein you surprise me a merchant of your eminence and a member of the British parliament might surely aspire without offence to the daughter of a planter In this case too natural affection would prompt to a discovery  STOCKWELL  Your remark is obvious nor could I have persisted in this painful silence but in obedience to the dying injunctions of a beloved wife The letter you found me reading conveyed those injunctions to me it was dictated in her last illness and almost in the article of death you'll spare me the recital of it she there conjures me in terms as solemn as they are affecting never to reveal the secret of our marriage or withdraw my son while her father surviv'd  STUKELY  But on what motives did your unhappy lady found these injunctions  STOCKWELL  Principally I believe from apprehension on my account lest old Belcour on whom at her decease I wholly depended should withdraw his protection in part from consideration of his repose as well knowing the discovery would deeply affect his spirit which was haughty vehement and unforgiving and lastly in regard to the interest of her infant whom he had warmly adopted and for whom in case of a discovery every thing was to be dreaded from his resentment And indeed though the alteration in my condition might have justified me in discovering myself yet I always thought my son safer in trusting to the caprice than to the justice of his grandfather My judgment has not suffered by the event old Belcour is dead and has bequeathed his whole estate to him we are speaking of  STUCKELY  Now then you are no longer bound to secrecy  STOCKWELL  True but before I publickly reveal myself I could wish to make some experiment of my son's disposition this can be only done by letting his spirit take its course without restraint by these means I think I shall discover much more of his real character under the title of his merchant than I should under that of his father  SCENE II  A Sailor enters ushering in several black servants carrying portmanteaus trunks  c  SAILOR  Save your honour is your name Stockwell pray  STOCKWELL  It is  SAILOR  Part of my master Belcour's baggage an't please you there's another cargo not far a stern of us and the cockswain has got charge of the dumb creatures  STOCKWELL  Pr'ythee friend what dumb creatures do you speak of has Mr Belcour brought over a collection of wild beasts  SAILOR  No Lord love him no not he let me see there's two green monkies a pair of grey parrots a Jamaica sow and pigs and a Mangrove dog that's all  STOCKWELL  Is that all  SAILOR  Yes your honour yes that's all bless his heart a'might have brought over the whole island if he would a didn't leave a dry eye in it  STOCKWELL  Indeed Stukely shew 'em where to bestow their baggage Follow that gentleman  SAILOR  Come bear a hand my lads bear a hand  Exit with  Stukely  and Servants  STOCKWELL  If the principal tallies with his purveyors he must be a singular spectacle in this place he has a friend however in this seafaring fellow 'tis no bad prognostic of a man's heart when his shipmates give him a good word  Exit  SCENE III  Scene changes to a drawing room a servant discovered setting the chairs by  c  a woman servant enters to him  HOUSEKEEPER  Why what a fuss does our good master put himself in about this West Indian see what a bill of fare I've been forced to draw out seven and nine I'll assure you and only a family dinner as he calls it why if my Lord Mayor was expected there couldn't be a greater todo about him  SERVANT  I wish to my heart you had but seen the loads of trunks boxes and portmanteaus he has sent hither An ambassador's baggage with all the smuggled goods of his family does not exceed it  HOUSEKEEPER  A fine pickle he'll put the house into had he been master's own son and a Christian Englishman there cou'd not be more rout than there is about this Creolian as they call 'em  SERVANT  No matter for that he's very rich and that's sufficient They say he has rum and sugar enough belonging to him to make all the water in the Thames into punch But I see my master coming  Exeunt  SCENE IV  STOCKWELL  enters followed by a Servant  STOCKWELL  Where is Mr Belcour Who brought this note from him  SERVANT  A waiter from the London Tavern Sir he says the young gentleman is just drest and will be with you directly  STOCKWELL  Shew him in when he arrives  SERVANT  I shall Sir I'll have a peep at him first however I've a great mind to see this outlandish spark The sailor fellow says he'll make rare doings amongst us  aside  STOCKWELL  You need not wait leave me  Exit Servant  Let me see  reads  Sir  I write to you under the hands of the hairdresser as soon as I have made myself decent and slipped on some fresh cloaths I will have the honour of paying you my devoirs  Yours BELCOUR  He writes at his ease for he's unconscious to whom his letter is addressed but what a palpitation does it throw my heart into a father's heart 'Tis an affecting interview when my eyes meet a son whom yet they never saw where shall I find constancy to support it Should he resemble his mother I am overthrown All the letters I have had from him for I industriously drew him into a correspondence with me bespeak him of quick and ready understanding All the reports I ever recieved give me favourable impressions of his character wild perhaps as the manner of his country is but I trust not frantic or unprincipled  SCENE V  SERVANT  enters  SERVANT  Sir the foreign gentleman is come  Another  SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr Belcour  BELCOUR  enters  STOCKWELL  Mr Belcour I'm rejoiced to see you you're welcome to England  BELCOUR  I thank you heartily good Mr Stockwell you and I have long conversed at a distance now we are met and the pleasure this meeting gives me amply compensates for the perils I have run through in accomplishing it  STOCKWELL  What perils Mr Belcour I could not have thought you would have met a bad passage at this time o'year  BELCOUR  Nor did we courier like we came posting to your shores upon the pinions of the swiftest gales that ever blew 'tis upon English ground all my difficulties have arisen 'tis the passage from the riverside I complain of  STOCKWELL  Ay indeed What obstructions can you have met between this and the riverside  BELCOUR  Innumerable Your town's as full of defiles as the Island of Corsica and I believe they are as obstinately defended so much hurry bustle and confusion on your quays so many sugarcasks porterbutts and common councilmen in your streets that unless a man marched with artillery in his front 'tis more than the labout of a Hercules can effect to make any tolerable way through your town  STOCKWELL  I am sorry you have been so incommoded  BELCOUR  Why faith 'twas all my own fault accustomed to a land of slaves and out of patience with the whole tribe of customhouse extortioners boatmen tidewaiters and waterbailiffs that beset me on all sides worse than a  swarm of musquetoes I proceeded a little too roughly to brush them away with my rattan the sturdy rogues took this in dudgeon and beginning to rebel the mob chose different sides and a furious scuffle ensued in the course of which my person and apparel suffered so much that I was obliged to step into the first tavern to refit before I could make my approaches in any decent trim  STOCKWELL  All without is as I wish dear Nature add the rest and I am happy  aside  Well Mr Belcour 'tis a rough sample you have had of my countrymen's spirit but I trust you'll not think the worse of them for it  BELCOUR  Not at all not at all I like 'em the better was I only a visitor I might perhaps wish them a little more tractable but as a fellow subject and a sharer in their freedom I applaud their spirit though I feel the effects of it in every bone in my skin  STOCKWELL  That's well I like that well How gladly I could fall upon his neck and own myself his father  aside  BELCOUR  Well Mr Stockwell for the first time in my life here am I in England at the fountain head of pleasure in the land of beauty of arts and elegancies My happy stars have given me a good estate and the conspiring winds have blown me hither to spend it  STOCKWELL  To use it not to waste it I should hope to treat it Mr Belcour not as a vassal over whom you have a wanton and despotic power but as a subject which you are bound to govern with a temperate and restrained authority  BELCOUR  True Sir most truly said mine's a commission not a right I am the offspring of distress and every child of sorrow is my brother while I have hands to hold therefore I will hold them open to mankind but Sir my passions are my masters they take me where they will and oftentimes they leave to reason and to virtue nothing but my wishes and my sighs  STOCKWELL  Come come the man who can accuse corrects himself  BELCOUR  Ah that's an office I am weary of I wish a friend would take it up I would to Heaven you had leisure for the employ but did you drive a trade to the four corners of the world you would not find the talk so toilsome as to keep me free from faults  STOCKWELL  Well I am not discouraged this candour tells me I should not have the fault of selfconceit to combat that at least is not amongst the number  BELCOUR  No if I knew that man on earth who thought more humbly of me than I do of myself I would take up his opinion and forego my own  STOCKWELL  And was I to chuse a pupil it should be one of your complexion so if you'll come along with me we'll agree upon your admission and enter on a course of lectures directly  BELCOUR  With all my heart  Exeunt  SCENE VI  Scene changes to a Room in  LADY RUSPORT  's House  LADY RUSPORT  and  CHARLOTTE  LADY RUSPORT  Miss Rusport I desire to hear no more of Captain Dudley and his destitute family not a shilling of mine shall ever cross the hands of any of them because my sister chose to marry a beggar am I bound to support him and his posterity  CHARLOTTE  I think you are  LADY RUSPORT  You think I am and pray where do you find the law that tells you so  CHARLOTTE  I am not proficient enough to quote chapter and verse but I take charity to be a main clause in the great statute of christianity  LADY RUSPORT  I say charity indeed And pray Miss are you sure that it is charity pure charity which moves you to plead for Captain Dudley Amongst all your pity do you find no spice of a certain antispiritual passion called love Don't mistake yourself you are no saint child believe me and I am apt to think the distresses of old Dudley and of his daughter into the bargain would never break your heart if there was not a certain young fellow of two and twenty in the case who by the happy recommendation of a good person and the brilliant appointments of an ensigncy will if I am not mistaken cozen you out of a fortune of twice twenty thousand pounds as soon as ever you are of age to bestow it upon him  CHARLOTTE  A nephew of your ladyship's can never want any other recommendation with me and if my partiality for Charles Dudley is acquitted by the rest of the world I hope Lady Rusport will not condemn me for it  LADY RUSPORT  I condemn you I thank Heaven Miss Rusport I am no ways responsible for your conduct nor is it any concern of mine how you dispose of yourself you are not my daughter and when I married your father poor Sir Stephen Rusport I found you a forward spoiled Miss of fourteen far above being instructed by me  CHARLOTTE  Perhaps your ladyship calls this instruction  LADY RUSPORT  You're strangely pert but 'tis no wonder your mother I'm told was a fine lady and according to the modern stile of education you was brought up It was not so in my young days there was then some decorum in the world some subordination as the great Locke expresses it Oh 'twas an edifying sight to see the regular deportment observed in our family no gigling no gossiping was going on there my good father Sir Oliver Roundhead never was seen to laugh himself nor ever allowed it in his children  CHARLOTTE  Ay those were happy times indeed  LADY RUSPORT  But in this forward age we have coquets in the eggshell and philosophers in the cradle girls of fifteen that lead the fashion in new caps and new opinions that have their sentiments and their sensations and the idle fops encourage 'em in it O' my conscience I wonder what it is the men can see in such babies  CHARLOTTE  True Madam but all men do not overlook the maturer beauties of your ladyship's age witness your admirer Major Dennis O'Flaherty there's an example of some discernment I declare to you when your ladyship is by the Major takes no more notice of me than if I was part of the furniture of your chamber  LADY RUSPORT  The major child has travelled through various kingdoms and climates and has more enlarged notions of female merit than falls to the lot of an English homebred lover in most other countries no woman on your side forty would ever be named in a polite circle  CHARLOTTE  Right Madam I've been told that in Vienna they have coquets upon crutches and Venuses in their grand climateric a lover there celebrates the wrinkles not the dimples in his mistress's face The Major I think has served in the imperial army  LADY RUSPORT  Are you piqu'd my young Madam Had my sister Louisa now yielded to the addresses of one of Major O'Flaherty's person and appearance she would have had some excuse but to run away as she did at the age of sixteen too with a man of old Dudley's sort  CHARLOTTE  Was in my opinion the most venial trespass that ever girl of sixteen committed of a noble family an engaging person strict honour and sound understanding what accomplishment was there wanting in Captain Dudley but that which the prodigality of his ancestors had deprived him of  LADY RUSPORT  They left him as much as he deserves hasn't the old man captain's halfpay And is not the son an ensign  CHARLOTTE  An ensign Alas p  or Charles Would to Heaven he knew what my heart feels and suffers for his sake  SERVANT  enters  SERVANT  Ensign Dudley to wait upon your ladyship  LADY RUSPORT  Who Dudley What can have brought him to town  CHARLOTTE  Dear Madam 'tis Charles Dudley 'tis your nephew  LADY RUSPORT  Nephew I renounce him as my nephew Sir Oliver renounced him as his grandson wasn't he son of the eldest daughter and only male descendant of Sir Oliver and didn't he cut him off with a shilling Didn't the poor dear good man leave his whole f  rtune to me except a small annuity to my maiden sister who spoiled her constitution with nursing him And depend upon it not a penny of that fortune shall ever be disposed of otherwise than according to the will of the donor  CHARLES DUDLEY  enters  So young man whence come you What brings you to town  CHARLES  If there is any offence in my coming to town your ladyship is in some degree responsible for it for part of my errand was to pay my duty here  LADY RUSPORT  I hope you have some better excuse than all this  CHARLES  'Tis true madam I have other motives but if I consider my trouble repaid by the pleasure I now enjoy I should hope my aunt would not think my company the less welcome for the value I set upon her's  LADY RUSPORT  Coxcomb And where is your father child and your sister Are they in town too  CHARLES  They are  LADY RUSPORT  Ridiculous I don't know what people do in London who have no money to spend in it  CHARLOTTE  Dear Madam speak more kindly to your nephew how can you oppress a youth of his sensibility  LADY RUSPORT  Miss Rusport I insist upon your retiring to your apartment when I want your advice I'll send to you  Exit  CHARLOTTE  So you have put on a red coat too as well as your father 'tis plain what value you set upon the good advice Sir Oliver used to give you how often has he caution'd you against the army  CHARLES  Had it pleased my grandfather to enable me to have obeyed his caution I would have done it but you well know how destitute I am and 'tis not to be wonder'd at if I prefer the service of my king to that of any other master  LADY RUSPORT  Well well take your own course 'tis no concern of mine you never consulted me  CHARLES  I frequently wrote to your ladyship but could obtain no answer and since my grandfather's death this is the first opportunity I have had of waiting upon you  LADY RUSPORT  I must desire you not to mention the death of that dear good man in my hearing my spirits cannot support it  CHARLES  I shall obey you permit me to say that as that event has richly supplied you with the materials of bounty the distresses of my family can furnish you with objects of it  LADY RUSPORT  The distresses of your family child are quite out of the question at present had Sir Oliver been pleased to consider them I should have been well content  but he has absolutely taken no notice of you in his will and that to me must and shall be a law Tell your father and your sister I totally disapprove of their coming up to town  CHARLES  Must I tell my father that before your ladyship knows the motive that brought him hither Allur'd by the offer of exchanging for a commission on full pay the veteran after thirty years service prepares to encounter the fatal heats of Senegambia but wants a small supply to equip him for the expedition  SERVANT  enters  SERVANT  Major O'Flaherty to wait upon your ladyship  MAJOR  enters  MAJOR  Spare your speeches young man don't you think her ladyship can take my word for that I hope madam 'tis evidence enough of my being present when I've the honour of telling you so myself  LADY RUSPORT  Major O'Flaherty I am rejoiced to see you Nephew Dudley you perceive I'm engaged  CHARLES  I shall not intrude upon your ladyship's more agreeable engagements I presume I have my answer  LADY RUSPORT  Your answer child what answer can you possibly expect or how can your romantic father suppose that I am to abet him in all his idle and extravagant undertakings Come Major let me shew you the way into my dressingroom and let us leave this young adventurer to his meditations  Exit  O'FLAHERTY  I follow you my lady Young gentleman your obedient Upon my conscience as fine a young fellow as I wou'd wish to clap my eyes on he might have answered my salute howeverwell let it pass Fortune perhaps frowns upon the poor lad she's a damn'd slippery  lady and very apt to jilt us poor fellows that wear cockades in our hats Faretheewell honey whoever thou art  Exit  CHARLES  So much for the virtues of a Puritan out upon it her heart is flint yet that woman that aunt of mine without one worthy particle in her composition wou'd I dare be sworn as soon set her foot in a pesthouse as in a playhouse  going  MISS RUSPORT  enters to him  CHARLOTTE  Stop stay a little Charles whither are you going in such haste  CHARLES  Madam Miss Rusport what are your commands  CHARLOTTE  Why so reserved We had used to answer to no other names than those of Charles and Charlotte  CHARLES  What ails you you've been weeping  CHARLOTTE  No no or if I haveyour eyes are full too but I have a thousand things to say to you before you go tell me I conjure you where you are to be found here give me your direction write it upon the back of this visiting ticketHave you a pencil  CHARLES  I have but why shou'd you desire to find us out 'tis a pool little inconvenient place my sister has no apartment fit to receive you in  Servant enters  SERVANT  Madam my lady desires your company directly  CHARLOTTE  I am comingwell have you wrote it give it me O Charles either you do not or you will not understand me  Exeunt severally  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A room in  FULMER's  House  FULMER  and  Mrs FULMER  MRS FULMER  Why how you sit musing and mopeing sighing and desponding I'm ashamed of you Mr Fulmer is this the country you described to me a second Eldorado rivers of gold and rocks of diamonds You found me in a pretty snug retir'd way of life at Bologne out of the noise and bustle of the world and wholly at my ease you indeed was upon the wing with a fiery persecution at your back but like a true son of  Loyola  you had then a thousand ingenious devices to repair your fortune and this your native country was to be the scene of your performances fool that I was to be inveigled into it by you but thank Heaven our partnership is revocable I am not your wedded wife praised be my stars for what have we got whom have we gull'd but ourselves which of all your trains has taken fire even this poor expedient of your bookseller's shop seems abandoned for if a chance customer drops in who is there pray to help him to what he wants  FULMER  Patty you know it is not upon slight grounds that I despair there had us'd to be a livelihood to be pickt up in this country both for the honest and dishonest I have tried each walk and am likely to starve at last there is not a point to which the wit and faculty of man can turn that I have not set mine to but in vain I am beat through every quarter of the compass  MRS FULMER  Ah common efforts all strike me a master stroke Mr Fulmer if you wish to make any figure in this country  FULMER  But where how and what I have blustered for prerogative I have bellowed for freedom I have offered to serve my country I have engaged to betray it  a masterstroke truly why I have talk'd treason writ treason and if a man can't live by that he can live by nothing Here I set up as a bookseller why men left off reading and if I was to turn butcher I believe o' my conscience they'd leave off eating  CAPT DUDLEY  crosses the stage  MRS FULMER  Why there now's your lodger old Captain Dudley as he calls himself there's no flint without fire something might be struck out of him if you'd the wit to find the way  FULMER  Hang him an old dry skin'd curmudgeon you may as well think to get truth out of a courtier or candour out of a critic I can make nothing of him besides he's poor and therefore not for our purpose  MRS FULMER  The more fool he Wou'd any man be poor that had such a prodigy in his possession  FULMER  His daughter you mean she is indeed uncommonly beautiful  MRS FULMER  Beautiful Why she need only be seen to have the first men in the kingdom at her feet Egad I wish I had the leasing of her beauty what wou'd some of our young Nabobs give  FULMER  Hush here comes the captain good girl leave us to ourselves and let me try what I can make of him  MRS FULMER  Captain truely i'faith I'd have a regiment had I such a daughter before I was three months older  Exit  SCENE II  CAPT DUDLEY  enters to him  FULMER  Captain Dudley good morning to you  DUDLEY  Mr Fulmer I have borrow'd a book from your shop 'tis the sixth volume of my deceased friend Tristram he  is a flattering writer to us poor soldiers and the divine story of Le Fevre which makes part of this book in my opinion of it does honour not to its author only but to human nature  FULMER  He is an author I keep in the way of trade but one I never relish'd he is much too loose and profligate for my taste  DUDLEY  That's being too severe I hold him to be a moralist in the noblest sense he plays indeed with the fancy and sometimes perhaps too wantonly but while he thus designedly masks his main attack he comes at once upon the heart refines amends it softens it beats down each selfish barrier from about it and opens every sluice of pity and benevolence  FULMER  We of the catholic persuasion are not much bound to himWell Sir I shall not oppose your opinion a fevourite author is like a favourite mistress and there you know Captain no man likes to have his taste arraigned  DUDLEY  Upon my word Sir I don't know what a man likes in that case 'tis an experiment I never made  FULMER  SirAre you serious  DUDLEY  'Tis of little consequence whether you think so  FULMER  What a formal old prig it is  aside  I apprehend you Sir you speak with caution you are married  DUDLEY  I have been  FULMER  And this young lady which accompanies you  DUDLEY  Passes for my daughter  FULMER  Passes for his daughter humph  aside  She is exceedingly beautiful finely accomplish'd of a most enchanting shape and air  DUDLEY  You are much too partial she has the greatest defect a woman can have  FULMER  How so pray  DUDLEY  She has no fortune  FULMER  Rather say that you have none and that's a sore defect in one of your years Captain Dudley you've serv'd no doubt  DUDLEY  Familiar coxcomb But I'll humour him  aside  FULMER  A close old fox But I'll unkennel him  aside  DUDLEY  Above thirty years I've been in the service Mr Fulmer  FULMER  I guess'd as much I laid it at no less why 'tis a wearisome time 'tis an apprenticeship to a profession fit only for a patriarch But preferment must be closely follow'd you never could have been so far behindhand in the chace unless you had palpably mistaken your way You'll pardon me but I begin to perceive you have lived in the world not with it  DUDLEY  It may be so and you perhaps can give me better council I'm now soliciting a favour an exchange to a company on full pay nothing more and yet I meet a thousand bars to that tho' without boasting I should think the certificate of services which I sent in might have purchased that indulgence to me  FULMER  Who thinks or cares about 'em Certificate of services indeed Send in a certificate of your fair daughter carry her in your hand with you  DUDLEY  What Who My daughter Carry my daughter well and what then  FULMER  Why then your fortune's made that's all  DUDLEY  I understand you and this you call knowledge of the world Despicable knowledge but sirrah I will have you know  threatening him  FULMER  Help Who's within Wou'd you strike me Sir wou'd you lift up your hand against a man in his own house  DUDLEY  In a church if he dare insult the poverty of a man of honour  FULMER  Have a care what you do remember there is such a thing in law as an assault and battery ay and such trifling forms as warrants and indictments  DUDLEY  Go Sir you are too mean for my resentment 'tis that and not the law protects you Hence  FULMER  An old absurd incorrigible blockhead I'll be reveng'd of him  aside    Exit  SCENE III  YOUNG DUDLEY  enters to him  CHARLES  What is the matter Sir Sure I heard an outcry as I enter'd the house  DUDLEY  Not unlikely our landlord and his wife are for ever wranglingDid you find your aunt Dudley at home  CHARLES  I did  DUDLEY  And what was your reception  CHARLES  Cold as our poverty and her pride could make it  DUDLEY  You told her the pressing occasion I had for a small supply to equip me for this exchange has she granted me the relief I ask'd  CHARLES  Alas Sir she has peremptorily refused it  DUDLEY  That's hard that's hard indeed My petition was for a small sum she has refused it you say well be it so I must not complain Did you see the broker about the insurance on my life  CHARLES  There again I am the messenger of ill news I can raise no money so fatal is the climate alas that ever my father shou'd be sent to perish in such a place  SCENE IV  MISS DUDLEY  enters hastily  DUDLEY  Louisa what's the matter you seem frighted  LOUISA  I am indeed coming from Miss Rusport's I met a young gentleman in the streets who has beset me in the strangest manner  CHARLES  Insufferable Was he rude to you  LOUISA  I cannot say he was absolutely rude to me but he was very importunate to speak to me and once or twice attempted to lift up my hat he follow'd me to the corner of the street and there I gave him the slip  DUDLEY  You must walk no more in the streets child without me or your brother  LOUISA  O Charles Miss Rusport desires to see you directly Lady Rusport is gone out and she has something particular to say to you  CHARLES  Have you any commands for me Sir  DUDLEY  None my dear by all means wait upon Miss Rusport Come Louisa I shall desire you to go up to your chamber and compose yourself  Exeunt  SCENE V  BELCOUR  enters after peeping in at the Door  BELCOUR  Not a soul as I'm alive Why what an odd sort of a house this is Confound the little jilt she has fairly given the slip A p  ague upon this London I shall have no luck in it such a crowd and such a hurry and such a number of shops and one so like the other that whether the wench turn'd into this house or the next or whether she went up stairs or down stairs for there's a world above and a world below it seems I declare I know no more than if I was in the blue mountains In the name of all the devils at once why did she run away If every handsome girl I meet in this town is to lead me such a wild goose chace I had better have staid in the torrid zone I shall be wasted to the size of a sugar cane what shall I do Give the chace up hang it that's cowardly shall I a trueborn son of Phoebus suffer this little nimblefooted Daphne to escape me"Forbid it honour and forbid it love" Hush hush here she comes Oh the devil What tawdry thing have we got here  MRS FULMER  enters to him  MRS FULMER  Your humble servant Sir  BELCOUR  Your humble servant Madam  MRS FULMER  A fine summer's day Sir  BELCOUR  Yes ma'am and so cool that if the calendar didn't call it July I should swear it was January  MRS FULMER  Sir  BELCOUR  Madam  MRS FULMER  Do you wish to speak to Mr Fulmer Sir  BELCOUR  Mr Fulmer Madam I havn't the honour of knowing such a person  MRS FULMER  No I'll be sworn have you not thou art much too pretty a fellow and too much of a gentleman to be an author thyself or to have any thing to say to those that are so 'Tis the captain I suppose you are waiting for  BELCOUR  I rather suspect it is the Captain's wife  MRS FULMER  The Captain has no wife Sir  BELCOUR  No wife I'm heartily sorry for it for then she's his mistress and that I take to be the more desperate case of the two pray Madam wasn't there a lady just now turn'd into your house 'Twas with her I wish'd to speak  MRS FULMER  What sort of a lady pray  BELCOUR  One of the loveliest sort my eyes ever beheld young tall fresh fair in short a goddess  MRS FULMER  Nay but dear dear Sir now I'm sure you flatter for 'twas me you followed into the shop door this minute  BELCOUR  You No no take my word for it it was not you Madam  MRS FULMER  But what is it you laugh at  BELCOUR  Upon my soul I ask your pardon but it was not you believe me be assured it wasn't  MRS FULMER  Well Sir I shall not contend for the honour of being noticed by you I hope you think you woudn't have been the first man that noticed me in the streets however this I'm positive of that no living woman but myself has entered these doors this morning  BELCOUR  Wy then I'm mistaken in the house that's all for 'tis not humanly possible I can be so far out in the lady  going  MRS FULMER  Coxcomb But holda thought occurs as sure as can be he has seen Miss Dudley A word with you young gentleman come back  BELCOUR  Well what's your pleasure  MRS FULMER  You seem greatly captivated with this young lady are you apt to fall in love thus at first sight  BELCOUR  Oh yes 'tis the only way I ever can fall in love any man may tumble into a pit by surprize none but a fool would walk into one by choice  MRS FULMER  You are a hasty lover it seems have you spirit to be a generous one They that will please the eye mustn't spate the purse  BELCOUR  Try me put me to the proof bring me to an interview with the dear girl that has thus captivated me and see whether I have spirit to be grateful  MRS FULMER  But how pray am I to know the girl you have set your heart on  BELCOUR  By an undescribable grace that accompanies every look and action that falls from her there can be but one such woman in the world and nobody can mistake that one  MRS FULMER  Well if I should stumble upon this angel in my walks where am I to find you What's your name  BELCOUR  Upon my soul I can't tell you my name  MRS FULMER  Not tell me Why so  BELCOUR  Because I don't know what it is myself as yet I have no name  MRS FULMER  No name  BELCOUR  None a friend indeed lent me his but he forbad me to use it on any unworthy occasion  MRS FULMER  But where is your place of abode  BELCOUR  I have none I never slept a night in England in my life  MRS FULMER  Heydey  SCENE VI  FULMER  enters  FULMER  A fine case truly in a free country a pretty pass things are come to if a man is to be assaulted in his own house  MRS FULMER  Who has assaulted you my dear  FULMER  Who why this Captain Drawcansir this old Dudley my lodger but I'll unlodge him I'll unharbour him I warrant  MRS FULMER  Hush Hush Hold your tongue man pocket the affront and be quiet I've a scheme on foot will pay you for a hundred beatings Why you surprize me Mr Fulmer Captain Dudley assault you Impossible  FULMER  Nay I can't call it an absolute assault but he threatened me  MRS FULMER  Oh was that all I thought how it would turn outa likely thing truly for a person of his obliging compassionate turn no no poor Captain Dudley he has sorrows and distresses enough of his own to employ his spirits without setting them against other people Make it up as fast as you can watch this gentleman out follow him wherever he goes and bring me word who and what he  is be sure you don't lose sight of him I've other business in hand  Exit  BELCOUR  Pray Sir what sorrows and distresses have befallen this old gentleman you speak of  FULMER  Poverty disappointment and all the distresses attendant thereupon sorrow enough of all conscience I soon found how it was with him by his way of living low enough of all reason but what I overheard this morning put it out of all doubt  BELCOUR  What did you overhear this morning  FULMER  Why it seems he wants to join his regiment and has been beating the town over to raise a little money for that purpose upon his pay but the climate I find where he is going is so unhealthy that nobody can be found to lend him any  BELCOUR  Why then your town is a damn'd goodfornothing town and I wish I had never come into it  FULMER  That's what I say Sir the hardheartedness of some folks is unaccountable There's an old Lady Rusport a near relation of this gentleman's she lives hard by here opposite to Stockwell's the great merchant he sent to her a begging but to no purpose though she is as rich as a Jew she would not furnish him with a farthing  BELCOUR  Is the Captain at home  FULMER  He is up stairs Sir  BELCOUR  Will you take the trouble to desire him to step hither I want to speak to him  FULMER  I'll send him to you directly I don't know what to make of this young man but if I live I will find him out or know the reason why  Exit  BELCOUR  I've lost the girl it seems that's clear she was the first object of my pursuit but the case of this poor officer touches me and after all there may be as much true delight in rescuing a fellow creature from distress as there would be in plunging one into itBut let me see its a point that must be managed with some delicacyApropos there's pen and inkI've struck upon a method that will do  writes  Ay ay this is the very thing 'twas devilish lucky I happen'd to have these bills about me There there fare you well I'm glad to be rid of you you stood a chance of being worse applied I can tell you  encloses and seals the paper  SCENE VII  FULMER  brings in  DUDLEY  FULMER  That's the gentleman Sir I shall make bold however to lend an ear  DUDLEY  Have you any commands for me Sir  BELCOUR  Your name is Dudley Sir  DUDLEY  It is  BELCOUR  You command a company I think Captain Dudley  DUDLEY  I did I am now upon halfpay  BELCOUR  You've served some time  DUDLEY  A pretty many years long enough to see some people of more merit and better interest than myself made general officers  BELCOUR  Their merit I may have some doubt of their interest I can readily give credit to there is little promotion to be look'd for in your profession I believe without friends Captain  DUDLEY  I believe so too have you any other business with me may I ask  BELCOUR  Your patience for a moment I was informed you was about to join your regiment in distant quarters abroad  DUDLEY  I have been soliciting an exchange to a company on fullpay quarter'd at James'sFort in Senegambia but I'm afraid I must drop the undertaking  BELCOUR  Why so pray  DUDLEY  Why so Sir 'Tis a home question for a perfect stranger to put there is something very particular in all this  BELCOUR  If it is not impertinent Sir allow me to ask you what reason you have for despairing of success  DUDLEY  Why really Sir mine is an obvious reason for a soldier to haveWant of money simply that  BELCOUR  May I beg to know the sum you have occasion for  DUDLEY  Truly Sir I cannot exactly tell you on a sudden nor is it I suppose of any great consequence to you to be informed but I should guess in the gross that two hundred pounds would serve  BELCOUR  And do you find a difficulty in raising that sum upon your pay 'Tis done every day  DUDLEY  The nature of the climate makes it difficult I can get no one to insure my life  BELCOUR  Oh that's a circumstance may make for you as well as against in short Captain Dudley it so happens that I can command the sum of two hundred pounds seek no farther I'll accomodate you with it upon easy terms  DUDLEY  Sir do I understand you rightlyI beg your pardon but am I to believe that you are in earnest  BELCOUR  What is your surprize Is it an uncommon thing for a gentleman to speak truth or is it incredible that one fellow creature should assist another  DUDLEY  I ask your pardonMay I beg to know to whom Do you propose this in the way of business  BELCOUR  Entirely I have no other business on earth  DUDLEY  Indeed you are not a broker I'm persuaded  BELCOUR  I am not  DUDLEY  Nor an army agent I think  BELCOUR  I hope you will not think the worse of me for being neither in short Sir if you will peruse this paper it will explain to you who I am and upon what terms I act while you read it I will step home and fetch the money and we will conclude the bargain without loss of time In the mean while good day to you  Exit hastily  DUDLEY  Humph there's something very odd in all thislet me see what we've got hereThis paper is to tell me who he is and what are his terms in the name of wonder why has he sealed it Heydey what's here Two bank notes of a hundred each I can't comprehend what this means Hold here's a writing perhaps that will show me "Accept this trifle pursue your fortune and prosper"Am I in a dream Is this a reality  SCENE VIII  Enter  MAJOR O'FLAHERTY  MAJOR  Save you my dear Is it you now that are Captain Dudley I would askWhuh What's the hurry the  man's in If 'tis the lad that run out of the shop you wou'd overtake you might as well stay where you are by my soul he's as nimble as a Croat you are a full hour's march in his rearAy faith you may as well turn back and give over the pursuit well Captain Dudley if that's your name there's a letter for you Read man read it and I'll have a word with you after you've done  DUDLEY  More miracles on foot so so from Lady Rusport  O'FLAHERTY  You're right it is from her ladyship  DUDLEY  Well Sir I have cast my eye over it 'tis short and peremptory are you acquainted with the contents  O'FLAHERTY  Not at all my dear not at all  DUDLEY  Have you any message from lady Rusport  O'FLAHERTY  Not a syllable honey only when you've digested the letter I've a little bit of a message to deliver you from myself  DUDLEY  And may I beg to know who yourself is  O'FLAHERTY  Dennis O'Flaherty at your service a poor major of grenadiers nothing better  DUDLEY  So much for your name and title Sir now be so good to favour me with your message  O'FLAHERTY  Why then Captain I must tell you I have promised Lady Rusport you shall do whatever it is she bids you to do in that letter there  DUDLEY  Ay indeed have you undertaken so much Major without knowing either what she commands or what I can perform  O'FLAHERTY  That's your concern my dear not mine I must keep my word you know  DUDLEY  Or else I suppose you and I must measure swords  O'FLAHERTY  Upon my soul you've hit it  DUDLEY  That wou'd hardly answer to either of us you and I have probably had enough of fighting in our time before now  O'FLAHERTY  Faith and troth Master Dudley you may say that 'tis thirty years come the time that I have followed the trade and in a pretty many countriesLet me seeIn the war before last I serv'd in the Irish Brigade d'ye see there after bringing off the French monarch I left his service with a British bullet in my body and this ribband in my buttonhole Last war I followed the fortunes of the German eagle in the corps of grenadiers there I had my bellyfull of fighting and a plentiful scarcity of every thing else After six and twenty engagements great and small I went off with this gash on my scull and a kiss of the empress queen's sweet hand Heaven bless it for my pains since the peace my dear I took a little turn with the Confederates there in Polandbut such another set of madcapsby the Lord Harry I never knew what it was they were scuffling about  DUDLEY  Well Major I won't add another action to the list you shall keep your promise with Lady Rusport she requires me to leave London I shall go in a few days and you may take what credit you please from my compliance  O'FLAHERTY  Give me your hand my dear boy this will make her my own when that's the case we shall be brothers you know and we'll share her fortune between us  DUDLEY  Not so Major the man who marries Lady Rusport will have a fair title to her whole fortune without division  But I hope your expectations of prevailing are founded upon good reasons  O'FLAHERTY  Upon the best grounds in the world first I think she will comply because she is a woman secondly I am persuaded she won't hold out long because she's a widow and thirdly I make sure of her because I've married five wives and never failed yet and for what I know they're all alive and merry at this very hour  DUDLEY  Well Sir go on and prosper if you can inspire Lady Rusport with half your charity I shall think you deserve all her fortune at present I must beg your excuse good morning to you  O'FLAHERTY  A good sensible man and very much of a soldier I did not care if I was better acquainted with him but 'tis an awkward kind of a country for that the English I observe are close friends but distant acquaintance I suspect the old lady has not been over generous to poor Dudley I shall give her a little touch about that upon my soul I know but one excuse a person can have for giving nothing and that is like myself having nothing to give  Exit  SCENE IX  Scene changes to  LADY RUSPORT's  House  A dressingroom  MISS RUSPORT  and  LUCY  CHARLOTTE  Well Lucy you've dislodged the old lady at last but me thought you was a tedious time about it  LUCY  A tedious time indeed I think they who have least to spare contrive to throw the most away I thought I shou'd never have got her out of the house  CHARLOTTE  Why she's as deliberate in canvassing every article of her dress as an ambassador wou'd be in settling the preliminaries of a treaty  LUCY  There was a new hood and handkerchief that had come express from HolbornHill on the occasion that took as much time in adjusting  CHARLOTTE  As they did in making and she was as vain of them as an old maid of a young lover  LUCY  Or a young lover of himself Then madam this being a visit of great ceremony to a person of distinction at the West end of the town the old state chariot was drag'd forth on the occasion with strict charges to dress out the box with the Leopard skin hammercloth  CHARLOTTE  Yes and to hang the false tails on the miserable stumps of the old crawling cattle Well well pray Heaven the crazy affair don't break down again with her at least till she gets to her journey's endbut where's Charles Dudley Run down dear girl and be ready to let him in I think he's as long in coming as she was in going  LUCY  Why indeed madam you seem the more alert of the two I must say  Exit  CHARLOTTE  Now the deuce take the girl for putting that notion into my head I'm sadly afraid Dudley does hot like me so much encouragement as I have given him to declare himself I never cou'd get a word from him on the subject this may be very honourable but upon▪ my life it's very provoking by the way I wonder how I look today Oh shockingly hideously pale like a witch This is the old lady's glass and she has left some of her wrinkles on it How frightfully have I put on my cap all awry and my hair drest so unbecomingly altogether I'm a most compleat fright  SCENE X  CHARLES DUDLEY  comes in unobserved  CHARLES  That I deny  CHARLOTTE  Ah  CHARLES  Quarrelling with your glass cousin Make it up make it up and be friends it cannot compliment you more than by reflecting you as you are  CHARLOTTE  Well I vow my dear Charles that is delightfully said and deserves my very best curtesy your flattery like a rich jewel has a value not only from its superior lustre but from its extraordinary scarceness I verily think this is the only civil speech you ever directed to my person in your life  CHARLES  And I ought to ask pardon of your good sense for having done it now  CHARLOTTE  Nay now you relapse again don't you know if you keep well with a woman on the great score of beaury she'll never quarrel with you on the trifling article of good sense But any thing serves to fill up a dull yawning hour with an insipid cousin you have brighter moments and warmer spirits for the dear girl of your heart  CHARLES  Oh sie upon you sie upon you  CHARLOTTE  You blush and the reason is apparent you are a novice at hypocrisy but no practice can make a visit of ceremony pass for a visit of choice love is ever before its time friendship is apt to lag a little after it pray Charles did you make any extraordinary haste hither  CHARLES  By your question I see you acquit me of the impertinence of being in love  CHARLOTTE  But why impertinence why the impertinence of being in love you have one language for me Charles and another for the woman of your affection  CHARLES  You are mistaken the woman of my affection shall never hear any other language from me than what I use to you  CHARLOTTE  I am afraid then you'll never make yourself understood by her  CHARLES  It is not fit I shou'd there is no need of love to make me miserable 'tis wretchedness enough to be a beggar  CHARLOTTE  A beggar do you call yourself O Charles Charles rich in every merit and accomplishment whom may you not aspire to and why think you so unworthily of our sex as to conclude there is not one to be found with sense to discern your virtue and generosity to reward it  CHARLES  You distress me I must beg to hear no more  CHARLOTTE  Well I can be silentThus does he always serve me whenever I am about to disclose myself to him  CHARLES  Why do you not banish me and my misfortunes for ever from your thoughts  CHARLOTTE  Ay wherefore do I not since you never allowed me a place in yours but go Sir I have no right to stay you go where your heart directs you go to the happy the distinguished fair one  CHARLES  Now by all that's good you do me wrong there is no such fair one for me to go to nor have I an acquaintance amongst the sex yourself excepted which answers to that description  CHARLOTTE  Indeed  CHARLES  In very truth there then let us drop the subject May you be happy though I never can  CHARLOTTE  O Charles give me your hand if I have offended you I ask you pardon you have been long acquainted with my temper and know how to bear with its infirmities  CHARLES  Thus my dear Charlotte let us seal our reconciliation  kissing her hand  Bear with thy infirmities By Heaven I know not any one failing in thy whole composition except that of too great a partiality for an undeserving man  CHARLOTTE  And you are now taking the very course to augment that failing A thought strikes me I have a commission that you must absolutely execute for me I have immediate occasion for the sum of two hundred pounds you know my fortune is shut up till I am of age take this paltry box it contains my earrings and some other bawbles I have no use for carry it to our opposite neighbour Mr Stockwell I don't know where else to apply leave it as a deposit in his hands and beg him to accomodate me with the sum  CHARLES  Dear Charlotte what are you about to do How can you possibly want two hundred pounds  CHARLOTTE  How can I possibly do without it you mean Doesn't every lady want two hundred pounds Perhaps I have lost it at play perhaps I mean to win as much to it perhaps I want it for two hundred different uses  CHARLES  Pooh pooh all this is nothing don't I know you never play  CHARLOTTE  You mistake I have a spirit to set not only this trifle but my whole fortune upon a stake therefore make no wry faces but do as I bid you you will find Mr Stockwell a very honourable gentleman  LUCY  enters in haste  LUCY  Dear Madam as I live here comes the old lady in a hackneycoach  CHARLOTTE  The old chariot has given her a second tumble▪ away with you you know your way out without meeting her take the box and do as I desire you  CHARLES  I must not dispute your orders Farewell  Exeunt  CHARLES  and  CHARLOTTE  SCENE XI  LADY RUSPORT  enters leaning on  MAJOR O'FLAHERTY  's arm  O'FLAHERTY  Rest yourself upon my arm never spare it 'tis strong enough it has stood harder service than you can put it to  LUCY  Mercy upon me what is the matter I am frighten'd out of my wits has your ladyship had an accident  LADY RUSPORT  O Lucy the most untoward one in nature I know not how I shall repair it  O'FLAHERTY  Never go about to repair it my lady ev'n build a new one 'twas but a crazy piece of business at best  LUCY  Bless me is the old chariot broke down with you again  LADY RUSPORT  Broke child I don't know what might have been broke if by great good fortune this obliging gentleman had not been at hand to assist me  LUCY  Dear Madam let me run and fetch you a cup of the cordial drops  LADY RUSPORT  Do Lucy Alas Sir ever since I lost my husband my poor nerves have been shook to pieces there hangs his beloved picture that precious relick and a p  entiful jointure is all that remains to console me for the best of men  O'FLAHERTY  Let me see i'faith a comely personage by his fur cloak I suppose he was in the Russian service and by the gold chain round his neck I should guess he had been honoured with the order of St Catharine  LADY RUSPORT  No no he meddled with no St Catharines that's the habit he wore in his mayoralty Sir Stephen was Lord Mayor of London but he is gone and has left me a poor weak solitary widow behind him  O'FLAHERTY  By all means then take a strong able hearty man to repair his loss if such a plain fellow as one Dennis O'Flaherty can please you I think I may venture to say without any disparagement to the gentleman in the furgown there  LADY RUSPORT  What are you going to say Don't shock my ears with any comparisons I desire  O'FLAHERTY  Not I by my soul I don't believe there's any comparison in the case  LADY RUSPORT  Oh are you come Give me the drops I'm all in a flutter  O'FLAHERTY  Hark'e sweetheart what are those same drops Have you any more left in the bottle I didn't care if I took a little sip of them myself  LUCY  Oh Sir they are call'd the cordial restorative elixir or the nervous golden drops they are only for ladies' cases  O'FLAHERTY  Yes yes my dear there are gentlemen as well as ladies that stand in need of those same golden drops they'd suit my case to a tittle  LADY RUSPORT  Well Major did you give o  d D  l  y my letter and will the silly man do as I bid him and be gone  O'FLAHERTY  You are obey'd he's on his march  LADY RUSPORT  That's well you have manag'd this matter to perfection I didn't think he wou'd have been so easily prevail'd upon  O'FLAHERTY  At the first word no difficulty in life 'twas the very thing he was determin'd to do before I came I never met a more obliging gentleman  LADY RUSPORT  Well 'tis no matter so I am but rid of him and his distresses wou'd you believe it Major O'Flaherty it was but this morning he sent a begging to me for money to fit him out upon some wildgoose expedition to the coast of Africa I know not where  O'FLAHERTY  Well you sent him what he wanted  LADY RUSPORT  I sent him what he deserved a flat refusal  O'FLAHERTY  You refused him  LADY RUSPORT  Most undoubtedly  O'FLAHERTY  You sent him nothing  LADY RUSPORT  Not a shilling  O'FLAHERTY  Good morning to youYour servant  going  LADY RUSPORT  Heyday What ails the man Where are you going  O'FLAHERTY  Out of your house before the roof falls on my head to poor Dudley to share the little modicum that thirty years hard service has left me I wish it was more for his sake  LADY RUSPORT  Very well Sir take your course I shan't attempt to stop you I shall survive it it will not break my heart if I never see you more  O'FLAHERTY  Break your heart No o' my conscience will it not You preach and you pray and you turn up your eyes and all the while you're as hardhearted as a hyena A hyena truly By my soul there isn't in the whole creation so savage an animal as a human creature without pity  Exit  LADY RUSPORT  A hyena truly Where did the fellow blunder upon that word Now the deuce take him for using it and the Macaronies for inventing it  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A room in  STOCKWELL's  house  STOCKWELL  and  BELCOUR  STOCKWELL  Gratify me so far however Mr Belcour as to see Miss Rusport carry her the sum she wants and return the poor girl her box of diamonds which Dudley lost in my hands you know what to say on the occasion better than  do that part of your commission I leave to your own discretion and you may season it with what galantry you think fit  BELCOUR  You cou'd not have pitch'd upon a greater bungler at galantry than myself if you had rummag'd every company in the city and the whole court of aldermen into the bargain p  rt o  your errand however I will do but whether it shall be with an ill grace or a go  d one depends upon the capture of a m  ment the  the l  dy the mode of our m  ting and a thousa  sirable small circumstances that nevertheless determine us upon all the great occasions of life  STOCKWELL  I persuade myself you will find Miss Rusport an ingenuous worthy animated girl  BELCOUR  Why I like her the better as a woman but name her not to me as a wife No if ever I marry it must be a staid sober considerate damsel with blood in her vein as cold as a turtle's quick of s  nt  a  when danger's in the wind wary and sharpsighted  when treachery is on foot with such a compan  n at my elbow for ever whispering in my earhave a ca  e of this man he's a cheat don't go n  r that woman she's  over head there  s a scaffold under  Oh Sir such a woman might lead me up and down in  great city without difficulty or danger  with a  Miss Rusport's complection  shou'd be dup'd undone  STOCKWELL  Ha ha ha Why you are become wondrous circumspect of a sudden pupil and if you can find such a prudent damsel as you describe you have my consent only beware how you chuse discretion is not the reigning quality amongst the fine ladies of the present time and I think in Miss Rusport's particular I have given you no bad counsel  BELCOUR  Well well if you'll fetch me the jewels I believe I can undertake to carry them to her but as for the money I'll have nothing to do with that Dudley would be your fittest ambassador on that occasion and if I mistake not the most agreeable to the lady  STOCKWELL  Why indeed from what I know of the matter it may not improbably be destined to find its way into his pockets  Exit  BELCOUR  Then depend upon it these are not the only trinkets she means to dedicate to Captain Dudley As for me Stockwell indeed wants me to marry but till I can get this bewitching girl this incognita out of my head I can never think of any other woman  SERVANT  enters and delivers a letter  Heyday Where can I have pick'd up a correspondent already 'Tis a most execrable manuscriptLet me see Martha FulmerWho is Martha Fulmer Pshaw I won't be at the trouble of decyphering her damn'd pothooks Hold hold hold What have we got here  DEAR SIR  "I've discover'd the lady you was so much smitten with and can procure you an interview with her if you can be as generous to a pretty girl as you was to a paltry old captain" How did she find that out "you need not despair come to me immediately the lady is now in my house and expects you  Yours MARTHA FULMER  O thou dear lovely and enchanting paper which I was about to tear into a thousand scraps devoutly I entreat thy pardon I have slighted thy contents which are delicious slander'd thy characters which are divine and all the atonement I can make is implicitly to obey thy mandates  STOCKWELL  returns  STOCKWELL  Mr Belcour here are the jewels this letter encloses bills for the money and if you will deliver it to Miss Rusport you'll have no farther trouble on that score  BELCOUR  Ah Sir the letter which I've been reading disqualifies me for delivering the letter which you have been writing I have other game on foot the loveliest girl my eyes ever feasted upon is started in view and the world cannot now divert me from pursuing her  STOCKWELL  Heydey What has turned you thus on a sudden  BELCOUR  A woman one that can turn and overturn me and my tottering resolutions every way she will Oh Sir if this is folly in me you must rail at Nature you must chide the sun that was vertical at my birth and would not wink upon my nakedness but swaddled me in the broadest hottest glare of his meridian beams  STOCKWELL  Mere rhapsody mere childish rhapsody the libertine's familiar pleaNature made us 'tis true but we are the responsible creators of our own faults and follies  BELCOUR  Sir  STOCKWELL  Slave of every face you meet some hussey has inveigled you some handsome profligate the town is full of them and when once fairly bankrupt in constitution as well as fortune nature no longer serves as your excuse for being vicious necessity perhaps will stand your friend and you'll reform  BELCOUR  You are severe  STOCKWELL  It fi  s me to be soit well becomes a fatherI would say a friendHow strangely I forget myselfHow difficult it is to counterfeit indifference and put a mask upon the heartI've struck him hard he reddens  BELCOUR  How could you tempt me so Had you not inadvertently dropped the name of father I fear our friendship short as it has been would scarce have held meBut even your mistake I reverenceGive me your hand'tis over  STOCKWELL  Generous young manlet me embrace youHow shall I hide my tears I have been to blame because I bore you the affection of a father I rashly took up the authority of one I ask your pardonpursue your course I have no right to stop itWhat would you have me do with these things  BELCOUR  This if I might advise carry the money to Miss Rusport immediately never let generosity wait for it's materials that part of the business presses Give me the jewels I'll find an opportunity of delivering them into her hands and your visit may pave the way for my reception  Exit  STOCKWELL  Be it so good morning to you Farewel advice Away goes he upon the wing for pleasure What various passions he awakens in me He pains yet pleases me affrights offend yet grows upon my heart His very failings set him offfor ever trespassing for ever atoning I almost think he would not be so perfect were he free from fault I must dissemble longer and yet how painful the experimentEven now he's gone upon some wild adventure and who can tell what mischief may befal him O Nature what it is to be a father Just such a thoughtless headlong thing was I when I beguiled his mother into love  Exit  SCENE II  Scene changes to  FULMER's  House  FULMER  and his  WIFE  FULMER  I tell you Patty you are a fool to think of bringing him and Miss Dudley together 'twill ruin every thing and blow your whole scheme up to the moon at once  MRS FULMER  Why sure Mr Fulmer I may be allowed to rear a chicken of my own hatching as they say Who first sprung the thought but I pray Who contrived the plot Who proposed the letter but I I  FULMER  And who dogg'd the gentleman home Who found out his name fortune connection that he was a WestIndian fresh landed and full of cash a gull to our heart's content a hotbrain'd headlong spark that would run into our trap like a wheatear under a turf  MRS FULMER  Hark he's come disappear march and leave the field open to my machinations  Exit  FULMER  SCENE III  BELCOUR  enters to her  BELCOUR  O thou dear minister to my happiness let me embrace thee Why thou art my polar star my propitious constellation by which I navigate my impatient bark into the port of pleasure and delight  MRS FULMER  Oh you men are sly creatures Do you remember now you cruel what you said to me this morning  BELCOUR  All a jest a frolick never think on't bury it for ever in oblivion thou why thou art all over nectar and ambrosia powder of pearl and odour of roles thou hast the  youth of Hebe the beauty of Venus and the pen of Sappho but in the name of all that's lovely where's the lady I expected to find her with you  MRS FULMER  No doubt you did and these raptures were designed for her but where have you loitered the lady's gone you are too late girls of her sort are not to be kept waiting like negro slaves in your sugar plantations  BELCOUR  Gone whither is she gone tell me that I may follow her  MRS FULMER  Hold hold not so fast young gentleman this is a case of some delicacy shou'd Captain Dudley know that I introduced you to his daughter he is a man of such scrupulous honour  BELCOUR  What do you tell me is she daughter to the old gentleman I met here this morning  MRS FULMER  The same him you was so generous to  BELCOUR  There's an end of the matter then at once it shall never be said of me that I took advantage of the father's necessities to trepan the daughter  going  MRS FULMER  So so I've made a wrong cast he's one of your conscientious sinners I find but I won't lose him thus Ha ha ha  BELCOUR  What is it you laugh at  MRS FULMER  Your absolute inexperience have you lived so very little time in this country as not to know that between young people of equal ages the term of sister often is a cover for that of mistress This young lady is in that sense of the word sister to young Dudley and consequently daughter to my old lodger  BELCOUR  Indeed are you serious  MRS FULMER  Can you doubt it I must have been pretty well assur'd of that before I invited you hither  BELCOUR  That's true she cannot be a woman of honour and Dudley is an unconscionable young rogue to think of keeping one fine girl in pay by raising contributions on another he shall therefore give her up she is a dear bewitching mischievous little devil and he shall positively give her up  MRS FULMER  Ay now the freak has taken you again I say give her up there's one way indeed and certain of success  BELCOUR  What's that  MRS FULMER  Outbid him never dream of outblustring him buy out his lease of possession and leave her to manage his ejectment  BELCOUR  Is she so venal Never fear me then when beauty is the purchase I shan't think much of the price  MRS FULMER  All things then will be made easy enough let me see some little genteel present to begin with what have you got about you Ay search I can bestow it to advantage there's no time to be lost  BELCOUR  Hang it confound it a plague upon't say I I hav'n't a guinea left in my pocket I parted from my whole stock here this morning and have forgot to supply myself since  MRS FULMER  Mighty well let it pass then there's an end think no more of the lady that's all  BELCOUR  Distraction think no more of her let me only step home and provide myself I'll be back with you in an instant  MRS FULMER  Pooh pooh that's a wretched shift have you nothing of value about you money's a coarse slovenly vehicle fit only to bribe electors in a borough there are more graceful ways of purchasing a lady's favours rings trinkets jewels  BELCOUR  Jewels Gadso I protest I had forgot I have a case of jewels but they won't do I must not part from them no no they are appropriated they are none of my own  MRS FULMER  Let me see let me see Ay now this were somethinglike pretty creatures how they sparkle these wou'd ensure success  BELCOUR  Indeed  MRS FULMER  These wou'd make her your own for ever  BELCOUR  Then the deuce take 'em for belonging to another person I cou'd find in my heart to give 'em the girl and swear I've lost them  MRS FULMER  Ay do say they were stolen out of your pocket  BELCOUR  No hang it that's dishonourable here give me the paltry things I'll write you an order on my merchant for double their value  MRS FULMER  An order No order for me no orders upon merchants with their value received and three day▪ grace their noting protesting and endorsing and all their countinghouse formalities I'll have nothing to do with them leave your diamonds with me and give your order for the value of them to the owner the money would be as good as the trinkets I warrant you  BELCOUR  Hey how I never thought of that but a breach of trust 'tis impossible I never can consent therefore give me the jewels back again  MRS FULMER  Take 'em I am now to tell you the lady is in this house  BELCOUR  In this house  MRS FULMER  Yes Sir in this very house but what of that you have got what you like better your toys your trinkets go go Oh you're a man of a notable spirit are you not  BELCOUR  Provoking creature Bring me to the sight of the dear girl and dispose of me as you think fit  MRS FULMER  And of the diamonds too  BELCOUR  Damn 'em I wou'd there was not such a bauble in nature But come come dispatch if I had the throne of Dehli I should give it to her  MRS FULMER  Swear to me then that you will keep within bounds remember she passes for the sister of young Dudley Oh if you come to your flights and your rhapsodies she'll be off in an instant  BELCOUR  Never fear me  MRS FULMER  You must expect to hear her talk of her father as she calls him and her brother and your bounty to her family  BELCOUR  Ay ay never mind what she talks of only bring her  MRS FULMER  You'll be prepar'd upon that head  BELCOUR  I shall be prepar'd never fear away with you  MRS FULMER  But hold I had forgot not a word of the diamonds leave that matter to my management  BELCOUR  Hell and vexation Get out of the room or I shall run distracted  Exit  Mrs Fulmer  Of a certain Belcour thou art born to be the fool of woman sure no man sins with so much repentance or repents with so little amendment as I do I cannot give away another person's property honour forbids me and I positively cannot give up the girl love passion constitution every thing protests against that How shall I decide I cannot bring myself to break a trust and I am not at present in the humour to baulk my inclinations Is there no middle way Let me considerThere is there is my good genius has presented me with one apt obvious honourable the girl shall not go without her baubles I'll not go without the girl Miss Rusport shan't lose her diamonds I'll save Dudley from destruction and every party shall be a gainer by the project  SCENE IV  MRS FULMER  introducing  MISS DUDLEY  MRS FULMER  Miss Dudley this is the worthy gentleman you wish to see this is Mr Belcour  LOUISA  As I live the very man that beset me in the streets  aside  BELCOUR  An angel by this light Oh I am gone past all retrieving  aside  LOUISA  Mrs Fulmer Sir informs me you are the gentleman from whom my father has received such civilities  BELCOUR  Oh never name 'em  LOUISA  Pardon me Mr Belcour they must be both named and remember'd and if my father was here  BELCOUR  I am much better pleased with his representative  LOUISA  That title is my brother's Sir I have no claim to it  BELCOUR  I believe it  LOUISA  But as neither he nor my father were fortunate enough to be at home I cou'd not resist the opportunity  BELCOUR  Nor I neither by my soul Madam let us improve it therefore I am in love with you to distraction I was charmed at the first glance I attempted to accost you you fled I follow'd but was defeated of an interview at length I have obtain'd one and seize the opportunity of casting my person and my fortune at your feet  LOUISA  You astonish me Are you in your senses or do you make a jest of my misfortunes Do you ground pretences on your generosity or do you make a practice of this folly with every woman you meet  BELCOUR  Upon my life no As you are the handsomest woman I ever met so you are the first to whom I ever made the like professions as for my generosity Madam I must refer you on that score to this good lady who I believe has something to offer in my behalf  LOUISA  Don't build upon that Sir I must have better proofs of your generosity than the mere divestment of a little superfluous dross before I can credit the sincerity of professions so abruptly deliver'd  Exit hastily  BELCOUR  Oh ye Gods and Goddesses how her anger animates her beauty  Going out  MRS FULMER  Stay Sir if you stir a step after her I renounce your interest for ever why you'll ruin every thing  BELCOUR  Well I must have her cost what it will I see she understands her own value tho' a little superfluous dross truly She must have better proofs of my generosity  MRS FULMER  'Tis exactly as I told you your money she calls dross she's too proud to stain her fingers with your coin bait your  ok well with jewels try that experiment and she's your own  BELCOUR  Take 'em let 'em go lay 'em at her feet I must get out of the scrape as I can my propensity is irresistible there you have 'em they are yours they are her's but remember they are a trust I commit them to her keeping till I can buy 'em off with something she shall think more valuable now tell me when shall I meet her  MRS FULMER  How can I tell that Don't you see what an alarm you have put her into Oh you are a rare one But go your ways for this while leave her to my management and come to me at seven this evening but remember not to bring empty pockets with youHa ha ha  Exeunt severally  SCENE V  LADY RUSPORT's  House  MISS RUSPORT  enters followed by a servant  CHARLOTTE  Desire Mr Stockwell to walk in  Exit Servant  STOCKWELL  enters  STOCWELL  Madam your most obedient servant I am honoured with your commands by Captain Dudley and have brought the money with me as you directed I understand the sum you have occasion for is two hundred pounds  CHARLOTTE  It is Sir I am quite confounded at your taking this trouble upon yourself Mr Stockwell  STOCKWELL  There is a Banknote Madam to the amount your jewels are in safe hands and will be delivered to you directly  If I had been happy in being better known to you I should have hoped you would not have thought it necessary to place a deposit in my hands for so trifling a sum as you have now required me to supply you with  CHARLOTTE  The bawbles I sent you may very well be spared and as they are the only security in my present situation I can give you I could wish you would retain them in your hands when I am of age which if I live a few months I shall be I will replace your favour with thanks  STOCKWELL  It is obvious Miss Rusport that your charms will suffer no impeachment by the absence of these superficial ornaments but they should be seen in the suite of a woman of fashion not as creditors to whom you are indebted for your appearance but as subservient attendants which help to make up your equipage  CHARLOTTE  Mr Stockwell is determined not to wrong the confidence I reposed in his politeness  STOCKWELL  I have only to request Madam that you will allow Mr Belcour a young gentleman in whose happiness I particularly interest myself to have the honour of delivering you the box of jewels  CHARLOTTE  Most gladly any friend of yours cannot fail of being welcome here  STOCKWELL  I flatter myself you will not find him totally undeserving your good opinion an education not of the strictest kind and strong animal spirits are apt sometimes to betray him into youthful irregularities but an high principle of honour and an uncommon benevolence in the eye of candor will I hope atone for any faults by which these good qualities are not impaired  CHARLOTTE  I dare say Mr Belcour's behaviour wants no apology we've no right to be over strict in canvassing the morals of a common acquaintance  STOCKWELL  I wish it may be my happiness to see Mr Belcour in the  list not of your common but particular acquaintance of your friends Miss RusportI dare not be more explicit  CHARLOTTE  Nor need you Mr Stockwell I shall be studious to deserve his friendship and though I have long since unalterably placed my affections on another I trust I have not left myself insensible to the merits of Mr Belcour and hope that neither you nor he will for that reason think me less worthy your good opinion and regards  STOCKWELL  Miss Rusport I sincerely wish you happy I have no doubt you have placed your affection on a deserving man and I have no right to combat your choice  Exit  CHARLOTTE  How honourable is that behaviour Now if Charles was here I should be happy The old lady is so fond of her new Irish acquaintance that I have the whole house at my disposal  Exit  CHARLOTTE  SCENE VI  BELCOUR  enters preceded by a Servant  SERVANT  I  your honour's pardon I thought my young lady was  ere who shall I inform her wou'd speak to her  BELCOUR  Belcour is my name Sir and pray beg your lady to put herself in  hurry on my account for I'd sooner see the devil than see her face  Exit Servant  In the name of all that's mischievous why did Stockwell drive me hither in soon haste A pretty figure truly I shall make an ambassador without credentials Blockhead that I was to charge myself with her diamonds officious meddling puppy Now they are irretrievably gone that suspicious jade Fulmer woudn't part even with a fight of them tho' I would have ransom'd 'em at twice their value Now must I trust to my poor wits to bring me off a lamentable dependance Fortune be my helper Here comes the girl If she is noble minded as she is said to be she will forgive me if not 'tis a lost cause for I have not thought of one word in my excuse  SCENE VII  CHARLOTTE  enters  CHARLOTTE  Mr Belcour I'm proud to see you your friend Mr Stockwell prepared me to expect this honour and I am happy in the opportunity of being known to you  BELCOUR  A fine girl by my soul Now what a cursed hangdog do I look like  aside  CHARLOTTE  You are newly arrived in this country Sir  BELCOUR  Just landed Madam just set ashore with a large cargo of Muscovado sugars rumpuncheons mahoganyslabs wet sweetmeats and green paroquets  CHARLOTTE  May I ask you how you like London Sir  BELCOUR  To admiration I think the town and the town'sfolk are exactly suited 'tis a great rich overgrown noisy tumultuous place the whole morning is a bustle to get money and the whole afternoon is a hurry to spend it  CHARLOTTE  Are these all the observations you have made  BELCOUR  No Madam I have observed the women are very captivating and the men very soon caught  CHARLOTTE  Ay indeed Whence do you draw that conclusion  BELCOUR  From infallible guides the first remark I collect from what I now see the second from what I now feel  CHARLOTTE  Oh the deuce take you but to wave this subject I believe Sir this was a visit of business not compliment was it not  BELCOUR  Ay now comes on my execution  CHARLOTTE  You have some foolish trinkets of mine Mr Belcour havn't you  BELCOUR  No in truth they are gone in search of a trinket still more foolish than themselves  aside  CHARLOTTE  Some diamonds I mean Sir Mr Stockwell inform'd me you was charged with 'em  BELCOUR  Oh yes Madam but I have the most treacherous memory in lifeHere they are Pray put them up they're all right you need not examine 'em  gives a box  CHARLOTTE  Heydey right Sir Why these are not my diamonds these are quite different and as it should seem of much greater value  BELCOUR  Upon my life I'm glad on't for then I hope you value 'em more than your own  CHARLOTTE  As a purchaser I should but not as an owner you mistake these belong to somebody else  BELCOUR  'Tis yours I'm afraid that belong to somebody else  CHARLOTTE  What is it yon mean I must insist upon your taking 'em back again  BELCOUR  Pray madam don't do that I shall infallibly lose them I have the worst luck with diamonds of any man living  CHARLOTTE  That you might well say was you to give me these in the place of mine but pray Sir what is the reason of all this Why have you changed the jewels and where have you disposed of mine  BELCOUR  Miss Rusport I cannot invent a lie for my life and if it was to save it I coudn't tell one I am an idle dissipated unthinking fellow not worth your notice in short I am a WestIndian and you must try me according  to the charter of my colony not by a jury of English spinsters truth is I've given away your jewels caught with a pair of sparkling eyes whose lustre blinded their's I served your property as I shou'd my own and lavish'd it away let me not totally despair of your forgiveness I frequently do wrong but never with impunity if your displeasure is added to my own my punishment will be too severe When I parted from the jewels I had not the honour of knowing their owner  CHARLOTTE  Mr Belcour your sincerity charms me I enter at once into your character and I make all the allowances for it you can desire I take your jewels for the present because I know there is no other way of reconciling you to yourself but If I give way to your spirit in one point you must yield to mine in another remember I will not keep more than the value of my own jewels there is no need to be pillaged by more than one woman at a time Sir  BELCOUR  Now may every blessing that can crown your virtues and reward your beauty be shower'd upon you may you meet admiration without envy love without jealousy and old age without malady may the man of your heart be ever constant and you never meet a less penitent or less grateful offender than myself  Servant enters and delivers a letter  CHARLOTTE  Does your letter require such haste  SERVANT  I was bade to give it into your own hands madam  CHARLOTTE  From Charles Dudley I seehave I your permission Good Heaven what do I read Mr Belcour you are concern'd in this  Dear Charlotte  in the midst of our distress Providence has cast a benefactor in our way after the most unexpected manner a young West Indian rich and with a warmth of heart peculiar to his climate has rescued my father from his troubles satisfied his wants and enabled him to accomplish his exchange when I relate to you the manner in which  this was done you will be charm'd I can only now add that it was by chance we found out that his name is Belcour and that he is a friend of Mr Stockwell's I lose not a moment's time in making you acquainted with this fortunate event for reasons which delicacy obliges me to suppress but perhaps if you have not received the money on your jewels you will not think it necessary now to do it I have the honour to be  Dear Madam  most faithfully yours CHARLES DUDLEY  Is this your doing Sir Never was generosity so worthily exerted  BELCOUR  Or so greatly overpaid  CHARLOTTE  After what you have now done for this noble but indigent family let me not scruple to unfold the whole situation of my heart to you Know then Sir and don't think the worse of me for the frankness of my declaration that such is my attachment to the son of that worthy officer whom you relieved that the moment I am of age and in possession of my fortune I shou'd hold myself the happiest of women to share it with young Dudley  BELCOUR  Say you so madam then let me perish if I don't love and reverence you above all woman kind and if such is your generous resolution never wait till you're of age life is too short pleasure too fugitive the soul grows narrower every hour I'll equip you for your escape I'll convoy you to the man of your heart and away with you then to the first hospitable parson that will take you in  CHARLOTTE  O blessed be the torrid zone for ever whose rapid vegetation quickens nature into such benignity These latitudes are made for politics and philosophy friendship has no root in this soil But had I spirit to accept your offer which is not improbable wou'dn't it be a mortifying thing for a fond girl to find herself mistaken and sent back to her home like a vagrant and such for what I know might be my case  BELCOUR  Then he ought to be proscribed the society of mankind for everAy ay 'tis the sham sister makes him thus indifferent 'twill be a meritorious office to take that girl out of the way  Servant enters  SCENE VIII  SERVANT  Miss Dudley to wait on you madam  BELCOUR  Who  SERVANT  Miss Dudley  CHARLOTTE  What's the matter Mr Belcour are you frighted at the name of a pretty girl 'tis the sister of him we were speaking ofpray admit her  BELCOUR  The sister So so he has imposed upon her too this is an extraordinary visit truly Upon my soul the assurance of some folks is not to be accounted for  CHARLOTTE  I insist upon your not running away you'll be charm'd with Louisa Dudley  BELCOUR  Oh yes I am charm'd with her  CHARLOTTE  You've seen her then have you  BELCOUR  Yes yes I've seen her  CHARLOTTE  Well isn't she a delightful girl  BELCOUR  Very delightful  CHARLOTTE  Why you answer as if you was in a court of justice O'my conscience I believe you are caught I've a notion she has trick'd you out of your heart  BELCOUR  I believe she has and you out of your jewels for to tell you the truth she's the very person I gave 'em to  CHARLOTTE  You gave her my jewels Louisa Dudley my jewels admirable inimitable oh the fly little jade but hush here she comes I don't know how I shall keep my countenance  LOUISA  enters  My dear I'm rejoiced to see you how d'ye do I beg leave to introduce Mr Belcour a very worthy friend of mine I believe Louisa you have seen him before  LOUISA  I have met the gentleman  CHARLOTTE  You have met the gentleman well Sir and you have met the lady in short you have met each other why then don't you speak to each other How you both stand tonguetied and fix'd as statuesHa ha ha Why you'll fall asleep byandby  LOUISA  Fye upon you fye upon you is this fair  BELCOUR  Upon my soul I never look'd so like a fool in my life the assurance of that girl puts me quite down  aside    CHARLOTTE  SirMr BelcourWas it your pleasure to advance any thing Not a syllable Come Louisa womens wit they say is never at a lossNor you neither Speechless bothWhy you was merry enough before this lady came in  LOUISA  I am sorry I have been any interruption to your happiness Sir  BELCOUR  Madam  CHARLOTTE  Madam Is that all you can say but come my dear girl I won't teaze you apropos I must shew you what a fine present this dumb gentleman has made me are not  ese handsome diamonds  LOUISA  Yes indeed they seem very fine but I am no judge of these things  CHARLOTTE  Oh you wicked little hypocrite you are no judge of these things Louisa you have no diamonds not you  LOUISA  You know I havn't Miss Rusport you know those things are infinitely above my reach  CHARLOTTE  Ha ha ha  BELCOUR  She does tell a lie with an admirable countenance that's true enough  LOUISA  What ails you Charlotte What impertinence have I been guilty of that you should find it necessary to humble me at such a rate if you are happy long may you be so but surely it can be no addition to it to make me miserable  CHARLOTTE  So serious there must be some mystery in thisMr Belcour will you leave us together You see I treat you with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance already  BELCOUR  Oh by all means pray command me Miss Rusport I'm your most obedient By your condescension in accepting those poor trifles I am under eternal obligations to youTo you Miss Dudley I shall not offer a word on that subject you despise finery you have a soul above it I adore your spirit I was rather unprepared for meeting you here but I shall hope for an opportunity of making myself better known to you  Exit  SCENE IX  CHARLOTTE  and  LOUISA  CHARLOTTE  Louisa Dudley you surprize me I never saw you act thus before can't you bear a little innocent raillery before the man of your heart  LOUISA  The man of my heart Madam Be assured I never was so visionary to aspire to any man whom Miss Rusport honours with her choice  CHARLOTTE  My choice my dear Why we are playing at cross purposes how enter'd it into your head that Mr Belcour was the man of my choice  LOUISA  Why didn't he present you with those diamonds  CHARLOTTE  Well perhaps he didand pray Louisa have you no diamonds  LOUISA  I diamonds truly Who should give me diamonds  CHARLOTTE  Who but this very gentleman Apropos here comes your brother  SCENE X  CHARLES  enters  I insist upon referring our dispute to him your sister and I Charles have a quarrel Belcour the hero of your letter has just left ussome how or other Louisa's bright eyes have caught him and the poor fellow's fallen desperately in love with herdon't interrupt me hussey Well that's excusable enough you'll say but the jet of the story is that this hairbrain'd spark who does nothing like other people has given her the very identical jewels which you pledged for me to Mr Stockwell and will you believe that this little demure slut made up a face and squeezed out three or four hypocritical tears because I rallied her about it  CHARLES  I'm all astonishment Louisa tell me without reserve has Mr Belcour given you any diamonds  LOUISA  None upon my honour  CHARLES  Has he made any professions to you  LOUISA  He has but altogether in a stile so whimsical and capricious that the best which can be said of them is to tell you that they seem'd more the result of good spirits than good manners  CHARLOTTE  Ay ay now the murder's out he's in love with her and she has no very great dislike to him trust to my observation Charles for that as to the diamonds there's some mistake about them and you must clear it up three minutes conversation with him will put every thing in a right train go go Charles 'tis a brother's business about it instantly ten to one you'll find him over the way at Mr Stockwell's  CHARLES  I confess I'm impatient to have the case clear'd up I'll take your advice and find him out good bye to you  CHARLOTTE  Your servant my life upon it you'll find Belcour a man of honour Come Louisa let us adjourn to my dressingroom I've a little private business to transact with you before the old lady comes up to tea and interrupts us  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  FULMER  's house  FULMER  and  MRS FULMER  FULMER  Patty wasn't Mr Belcour with you  MRS FULMER  He was and is now shut up in my chamber in high expectation of an interview with Miss Dudley she's at present with her brother and 'twas with some difficulty I persuaded my hotheaded spark to wait 'till he has left her  FULMER  Well child and what then  MRS FULMER  Why then Mr Fulmer I think it will be time for you and me to steal a march and be gone  FULMER  So this is all the fruit of your ingenious project a shameful overthrow or a sudden flight  MRS FULMER  Why my project was a mere impromptu and can at worst but quicken our departure a few days you know we had fairly outliv'd our credit here and a trip to Boulogne is no ways unseasonable Nay never droop manHark hark here's enough to bear charges  shewing a purse  FULMER  Let me see let me see this weighs well this is of the right sort why your WestIndian bled freely  MRS FULMER  But that's not all look here Here are the sparklers  shewing the jewels  Now what d'ye think of my performances Heh a foolish scheme isn't it a silly woman  FULMER  Thou art a Judith a Joan of Arc and I'll march under thy banners girl to the world's end Come let's begone I've little to regret my creditors may share the old books amongst them they'll have occasion for philosophy to support their loss they'll find enough upon my shelves The world is my library I read mankindNow Patty lead the way  MRS FULMER  Adieu Belcour  Exeunt  SCENE II  CHARLES DUDLEY  and  LOUISA  CHARLES  Well Louisa I confess the force of what you say I accept Miss Rusport's bounty and when you see my generous Charlotte tell herbut have a care there is a selfishness even in gratitude when it is too profuse to be over thankful for any one favour is in effect to lay out for another the best return I cou'd make my benefactress wou'd be never to see her more  LOUISA  I understand you  CHARLES  We that are poor Louisa shou'd be cautious for this reason I wou'd guard you against Belcour at least till I can unravel the mystery of Miss Rusport's diamonds I was disappointed of finding him at Mr Stockwell's and am now going in search of him again he may intend honourably but I confess to you I am stagger'd think no more of him therefore for the present of this be sure while I have life and you have honour I will protect you or perish in your defence  Exit  LOUISA  Think of him no more Well I'll obey but if a wand'ring uninvited thought should creep by chance into my bosom must I not give the harmless wretch a shelter Oh yes the great artificer of the human heart knows every thread he wove into its fabric nor puts his work to harder uses than it was made to bear my wishes then  my guiltless ones I mean are free How fast they spring within me at that sentence Down down ye busy creatures Whither wou'd you carry me Ah there is one amongst you a forward new intruder that in the likeness of an offending generous man grows into favour with my heart Fye fye upon it Belcour pursues insults me yet such is the fatality of my condition that what shou'd rouse resentment only calls up love  SCENE III  BELCOUR  enters to her  BELCOUR  Alone by all that's happy  LOUISA  Ah  BELCOUR  Oh shriek not start not stir not loveliest creature but let me kneel and gaze upon your beauties  LOUISA  Sir Mr Belcour rise What is it you do  BELCOUR  See I obey you mould me as you will behold your ready servant New to your country ignorant of your manners habits and desires I put myself into your hands for instruction make me only such as you can like yourself and I shall be happy  LOUISA  I must not hear this Mr Belcour go should he that parted from me but this minute now return I tremble for the consequence  BELCOUR  Fear nothing let him come I love you Madam he'll find it hard to make me unsay that  LOUISA  You terrify me your impetuous temper frightens me you know my situation it is not generous to pursue me thus  BELCOUR  True I do know your situation your real one Miss Dudley and am resolv'd to snatch you from it 'twill be a meritorious act the old Captain shall rejoice Miss Rusport shall be made happy and even he even your beloved brother with whose resentment you threaten me shall in the end applaud and thank me Come thou'rt a dear enchanting girl and I'm determin'd not to live a minute longer without thee  LOUISA  Hold are you mad I see you are a bold assuming man and know not where to stop  BELCOUR  Who that beholds such beauty can By Heaven you put my blood into a flame Provoking girl is it within the stretch of my fortune to content you What is it you can further ask that I am not ready to grant  LOUISA  Yes with the same facility that you bestow'd upon me Miss Rusport's diamonds For shame for shame was that a manly story  BELCOUR  So so these devilish diamonds meet me every where Let me perish if I meant you any harm Oh I cou'd tear my tongue out for saying a word about the matter  LOUISA  Go to her then and contradict it till that is done my reputation is at stake  BELCOUR  Her reputation Now she has got upon that she'll go on for everWhat is there I will not do for your sake I will go to Miss Rusport  LOUISA  Do so restore her own jewels to her which I suppose you kept back for the purpose of presenting others to her of a greater value but for the future Mr Belcour when you wou'd do a galant action to that lady don't let it be at my expence  BELCOUR  I see where she points she is willing enough to give up Miss Rusport's diamonds now she finds she shall be a gainer by the exchange Be it so 'tis what I wish'd Well Madam I will return Miss Rusport her own jewels and you shall have others of tenfold their value  LOUISA  No Sir you err most widely it is my good opinion not my vanity which you must bribe  BELCOUR  Why what the devil wou'd she have nowMiss Dudley it is my wish to obey and please you but I have some apprehension that we mistake each other  LOUISA  I think we do tell me then in few words what it is you aim at  BELCOUR  In few words then and in plain honesty I must tell you so entirely am I captivated with you that had you but been such as it wou'd have become me to have call'd my wife I had been happy in knowing you by that name as it is you are welcome to partake my fortune give me in return your person give me pleasure give me love free disencumber'd antimatrimonial love  LOUISA  Stand off and let me never see you more  BELCOUR  Hold hold thou dear tormenting tantalizing girl Upon my knees I swear you shall not stir till you've consented to my bliss  LOUISA  Unhand me Sir O Charles protect me rescue me redress me  Exit  SCENE IV  CHARLES DUDLEY  enters  CHARLES  How's this Rise villain and defend yourself  BELCOUR  Villain  CHARLES  The man who wrongs that lady is a villainDraw  BELCOUR  Never fear me young gentleman brand me for a coward if I baulk you  CHARLES  Yet hold Let me not be too hasty your name I think is Belcour  BELCOUR  Well Sir  CHARLES  How is it Mr Belcour you have done this mean unmanly wrong beneath the mask of gener  ity to g  ve this fatal stab to our domestic peace Your might have had my thanks my blessing take my defiance  Dudley speaks to you the brother the pr  tect  of that i  jur'd lady  BELCOUR  The brother Give yourself a  title  CHARLES  What is't you mean  BELCOUR  Come come I know both her and you I found you Sir but how or why I know not in the good graces of Miss Rusportyes colour at the named I gave you no disturbance there never broke  upon you  n that  ch and plenteous quarter but when I cou'd have blasted all your projects with a word spar'd you in foolish pity spar'd you nor rouz'd her from the fond credulity in which your artifice had lull'd her  CHARLES  No Sir nor boasted to her of the splendid present you had made my poor Louisa the  Mr Bel  our How was that What can you plead to that arraignment  BELCOUR  You question me too late  villain never met before▪ had you  quir  d  you utter'd that rash word you  ght have  or me a mortal error now Sir I neither give nor take an explanation so come on  They    SCENE V  LOUISA  and afterwards  O'FLAHERTY  LOUISA  Hold hold for Heaven's fake hold Charles Mr Belcour Help Sir Sir make haste they'll murder one another  O'FLAHERTY  Hell and confusion

cat up to the picket  CHARLOTTE  Hush hush not so loud  CHARLES  'Tis the office of a centinel Major you have undertaken rather than that of a fieldofficer  O'FLAHERTY  'Tis the office of a friend my dear boy and therefore no disgrace to a general  Exit  SCENE VIII  CHARLES  and  CHARLOTTE  CHARLOTTE  Well Charles will you commit yourself to me for a few minutes  CHARLES  Most readily and let me before one goes by tender you the only payment I can ever make for your abundant generosity  CHARLOTTE  Hold hold so vile a thing as money must not come between us What shall I say O Charles O Dudley What difficulties have you thrown upon me Familiarly as we have lived I shrink at what I'm doing and anxiously as I have sought this opportunity my fears almost persuade me to abandon it  CHARLES  You alarm me  CHARLOTTE  Your looks and actions have been so distant and at this moment are so deterring that was it not for the hope that delicacy and not disgust inspires this conduct in you I should sink with shame and apprehension but time presses and I must speak and plainly tooWas you now in possession  of your grandfather's estate as justly you ought to be and was you inclined to seek a companion for life should you or should you not in that case honour at your unworthy Charlotte with your choice  CHARLES  My unworthy Charl  tte So  me Heaven there is not a circumstance on  disgrace

wonders he feels like a coward There's a damn'd deal of mischief brewing between this hyena and her lawyer egad I'll step behind this screen and listen▪ a good soldier must sometimes fight in ambush as well as open field  retires  SCENE IX  LADY RUSPORT  and  VARLAND  LADY RUSPORT  Sure I heard somebody Hark No only the servants going down the back stairs Well Mr Varland I think then we are agreed you'll take my money and your conscience no longer stands in your way  VARLAND  Your father was my benefactor his will ought to be sacred but if I commit it to the flames how will he be the wiser Dudley 'tis true has done me no harm but five thousand pounds will do me much good so in short Madam I take your offer I will confer with my clerk who witnessed the will and tomorrow morning put it into your hands upon condition you put five thousand good pounds into mine  LADY RUSPORT  'Tis a bargain I'll be ready for you farewell  Exit  VARLAND  Let me considerFive thousand pounds prompt payment for destroying this scrap of paper not worth five farthings 'tis a fortune easily earn'd yes and 'tis another man's fortune easily thrown away 'tis a good round sum  to be paid down at once for a bribe but 'tis a damn'd rogue's trick in me to take it  O'FLAHERTY  aside  So so this fellow speaks truth to himself tho' he lies to other peoplebut hush  VARLAND  'Tis breaking the trust of my benefactor that's a foul crime but he's dead and can never reproach me with it and 'tis robbing young Dudley of his lawful patrimony that's a hard case but he's alive and knows nothing of the matter  O'FLAHERTY  aside  These lawyers are so used to bring off the rogueries of others that they are never without an excuse for their own  VARLAND  Were I assured now that Dudley would give me half the money for producing this will that Lady Rusport does for concealing it I wou'd deal with him and be an honest man at half price I wish every gentleman of my profession cou'd lay his hand on his heart and say the same thing  O'FLAHERTY  A bargain old gentleman Nay never start nor stare you wasn't afraid of your own conscience never be afraid of me  VARLAND  Of you Sir who are you pray  O'FLAHERTY  I'll tell you who I am you seem to wish to be honest but want the heart to set about it now I am the very man in the world to make you so for if you do not give me up that paper this very instant by the soul of me fellow I will not leave one whole bone in your skin that shan't be broken  VARLAND  What right have you pray to take this paper from me  O'FLAHERTY  What right have you pray to keep it from young Dudley I don't know what it contains but I am apt to think it will be safer in my hands than in your's therefore give it me without more words and save yourself a beating do now you had best  VARLAND  Well Sir I may as well make a grace of necessity There I have acquitted my conscience at the expence of five thousand pounds  O'FLAHERTY  Five thousand pounds Mercy upon me When there are such temptations in the law can we wonder if some of the corps are a disgrace to it  VARLAND  Well you have got the paper if you are an honest man give it to Charles Dudley  O'FLAHERTY  An honest man look at me friend I am a soldier this is not the livery of a knave I am an Irishman honey mine is not the country of dishonor Now Sirrah be gone if you enter these doors or give Lady Rusport the least item of what has passed I will cut off both your ears and rob the pillory of its due  VARLAND  I wish I was once fairly out of his sight  Exeunt  SCENE X  A Room in  STOCKWELL's  House  STOCKWELL  I must disclose myself to Belcour this noble instance of his generosity which old Dudley has been relating allies me to him at once concealment becomes too painful I shall be proud to own him for my sonBut see he's here  BELCOUR  enters and throws himself on a sopha  BELCOUR  O my curst tropical constitution wou'd to Heaven I had been dropt upon the snows of Lapland and never felt the blessed influence of the Sun so I had never burnt with these inflammatory passions  STOCKWELL  So so you seem disorder'd Mr Belcour  BELCOUR  Disorder'd Sir why did I ever quit the soil in which I grew what evil planet drew me from that warm sunny region where naked nature walks without disguise into this cold contriving artificial country  STOCKWELL  Come Sir you've met a rascal what o'that general conclusions are illiberal  BELCOUR  No Sir I've met reflection by the way I've come from folly noise and fury and met a silent monitorWell well a villian 'twas not to be pardon'dpray never mind me Sir  STOCKWELL  Alas my heart bleeds for him  BELCOUR  And yet I might have heard him now plague upon that blundering Irishman for coming in as he did the hurry of the deed might paliate the event deliberate execution has less to pleadMr Stockwell I am bad company to you  STOCKWELL  Oh Sir make no excuse I think you have not found me forward to pry into the secrets of your pleasures and pursuits 'tis not my disposition but there are times when want of curiosity wou'd be want of friendship  BELCOUR  Ah Sir mine is a case wherein you and I shall never think alike the punctilious rules by which I am bound are not to be found in your ledgers nor will pass current in the comptinghouse of a trader  STOCKWELL  'Tis very well Sir if you think I can render you any service it may be worth your trial to confide in me if not your secret is safer in your own bosom  BELCOUR  That sentiment demands my confidence pray sit down by me You must know I have an affair of honour on my hands with young Dudley and tho' I put up with no man's insult yet I wish to take away no man's life  STOCKWELL  I know the young man and am appris'd of your generosity to his father what can have bred a quarrel between you  BELCOUR  A foolish passion on my side and a haughty provocation on his There is a girl Mr Stockwell whom I have unfortunately seen of most uncommon beauty she has withal an air of so much natural modesty that had I not had good assurance of her being an attainable wanton I declare I shou'd as soon have thought of attempting the chastity of Diana  SERVANT  enters  STOCKWELL  Heyday do you interrupt us  SERVANT  Sir there's an Irish gentleman will take no denial he says he must see Mr Belcour directly upon business of the last consequence  BELCOUR  Admit him 'tis the Irish officer that parted us and brings me young Dudley's challenge I should have made a long story of it and he'll tell it you in three words  O'FLAHERTY  enters  O'FLAHERTY  Save you my dear and you Sir I have a little bit of a word in private for you  BELCOUR  Pray deliver your commands this gentleman is my intimate friend  O'FLAHERTY  Why then Ensign Dudley will be glad to measure swords with you yonder at the London Tavern in BishopsgateStreet at nine o'clockyou know the place  BELCOUR  I do and shall observe the appointment  O'FLAHERTY  Will you be of the party Sir We shall want a fourth hand  STOCKWELL  Savage as the customed I close with that proposal and tho' I am not  quarrel I shall  justice of it and  ence  O'FLAHERTY  Sir you're a gentleman of honour and I shall be glad of being better known  ha  'e  Belcour I had like to he  part of my  there is the  it over faith 'tis  the  can p  t you to death with a safe conscience and when he has done that job for you let it be a warning how you attempt the sister of    BELCOUR  The sister  O'FLAHERTY  Ay the sister  English  all one you  ley that  by St Patrick  b  +cour to  from her when there are so many to be met in this town who have dispos'd of th  ir'  to you hand    STOCKWELL  Why I am thunderstruck what is it you have done and what is the shocking business in which I have engaged If I understood him  young Dudley you've been attempting▪ y  u  to me of a profest wanton the girl he speaks of has beauty enough indeed to inflame your desires but she has honour innocence and simplicity to awe the most licentious passion if you have  that Mr Belcour I renounce you I abandon you I forswear all fellowship or friendship with you for ever  BELCOUR  Have patience for a moment we do indeed speak of the same person but she is not innocent she is not young Dudley's sister  STOCKWELL  Astonishing who told you this  BELCOUR  The woman where she lodges the person who put me on the pursuit and contriv'd our meetings  STOCKWELL  What woman What person  BELCOUR  Fulmer her name is I warrant you I did not proceed without good grounds  STOCKWELL  Fulmer Fulmer Who waits  a Servant enters  send Mr Stukely hither directly I begin to see my way into this dark transaction Mr Belcour Mr Belcour your are no match for the cunning and contrivances of this intriguing town  Stukely  enters  prythee Stukely what is the name of the woman and her husband who were stopt upon suspicion of selling stolen diamonds at our nextdoor neighbour's the jeweller  STUKELY  Fulmer  STOCKWELL  So  BELCOUR  Can you procure me a sight of those diamonds  STUKELY  They are now in my hand I was desir'd to show them to Mr Stockwell  STOCKWELL  Give 'em to me what do I see As I live the very diamonds Miss Rusport sent hither and which I intrusted to you to return  BELCOUR  Yes but I betray'd that trust and gave 'em Mrs Fulmer to present to Miss Dudley  STOCKWELL  With a view no doubt to bribe her to compliance  BELCOUR  I own it  STOCKWELL  For shame for shame and 'twas this woman's intelligence you relied upon for Miss Dudley's character  BELCOUR  I thought she knew her by Heaven I wou'd have died sooner than have insulted a woman of virtue or a man of honour  STOCKWELL  I think you wou'd but mark the danger of licentious courses you are betray'd robb'd abus'd and but for this providential discovery in a fair way of being sent out of the world with all your follies on your head Dear Stukely go to my neighbour tell him I have an owner for the jewels and beg him to carry the people under custody to the London Tavern and wait for me there  Exit  Stukely  I fear the law does not provide a punishment to reach the villiany of these people but how in the name of wonder cou'd you take any thing on the word of such an informer  BELCOUR  Because I had not liv'd long enough in your country to know how few informers words are to be taken perswaded however as I was of Miss Dudley's guilt I must own to you I was stagger'd with the appearance of such innocence especially when I saw her admitted into Miss Rusport's company  STOCKWELL  Good Heaven did you meet her at Miss Rusport's and cou'd you doubt her being a woman of reputation  BELCOUR  By you perhaps such a mistake cou'd not have been made but in a perfect stranger I hope it is venial I did not know what artifices young Dudley might have us'd to conceal her character I did not know what disgrace attended the detection of it  STOCKWELL  I see it was a trap laid for you which you have narrowly escap'd you address'd a woman of honour with all the loose incense of a profane admirer and you have drawn upon you the resentment of a man of honour who thinks himself bound to protect her Well Sir you must atone for this mistake  BELCOUR  To the lady the most penitent submission I can make is justly due but in the execution of an act of justice it never shall be said my soul was swayed by the least particle of fear I have received a challenge from her brother now tho' I wou'd give my fortune almost my life itself to purchase her happiness yet I cannot abate her one scruple of my honour I have been branded with the name of villain  STOCKWELL  Ay Sir you mistook her character and he mistook yours error begets error  BELCOUR  Villain Mr Stockwell is a harsh word  STOCKWELL  It is a harsh word and should be unsaid  BELCOUR  Come come it shall be unsaid  STOCKWELL  Or else what follows why the sword is drawn and to heal the wrongs you have done to the reputation of the sister you make an honourable amends by murdering the brother  BELCOUR  Murdering  STOCKWELL  'Tis thus religion writes and speaks the word in the vocabulary of modern honour there is no such termBut come I don't despair of satisfying the one without alarming the other that done I have a discovery to unfold that you will then I hope be fitted to receive  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  The London Tavern  O'FLAHERTY STOCKWELL CHARLES  and  BELCOUR  O'FLAHERTY  GEntlemen well met you understand each other's minds and as I see you have brought nothing but your swords you may set to without any further ceremony  STOCKWELL  You will not find us backward in any worthy cause but before we proceed any further I would ask this young gentleman whether he has any explanation to require of Mr Belcour  CHARLES  Of Mr Belcour none his actions speak for themselves but to you sir I would fain propose one question  STOCKWELL  Name it  CHARLES  How is it Mr Stockwell that I meet a man of your character on this ground  STOCKWELL  I will answer you directly and my answer shall not displease you I come hither in defence of the reputation of Miss Dudley to redress the injuries of an innocent young lady  O'FLAHERTY  By my soul the man knows he's to fight only he mistakes which side he's to be of  STOCKWELL  You are about to draw your sword to refute a charge against your sister's honour you would do well if there were no better means within reach but the proofs of her innocence are lodg'd in our bosoms and  if we fall you destroy the evidence that most effectually can clear her fame  CHARLES  How's that Sir  STOCKWELL  This gentleman could best explain it to you but you have given him an undeserv'd name that seals his lips against you I am not under the same inhibition and if your anger can keep cool for a few minutes I desire I may call in two witnesses who will solve all difficulties at once Here waiter bring those people in that are without  O'FLAHERTY  Out upon it what need is there for so much talking about the matter can't you settle your differences first and dispute about 'em afterwards  FULMER  and Mrs  FULMER  brought in  CHARLES  Fulmer and his wife in custody  STOCKWELL  Yes Sir these are your honest landlord and landlady now in custody for defrauding this gentleman of certain diamonds intended to have been presented to your sister Be so good Mrs Fulmer to inform the company why you so grossly scandalized the reputation of an innocent lady by persuading Mr Belcour that Miss Dudley was not the sister but the mistress of this gentleman  Mrs FULMER  Sir I don't know what right you have to question me and I shall not answer till I see occasion  STOCKWELL  Had you been as silent heretofore Madam it would have saved you some trouble but we don't want your confession This letter which you wrote to Mr Belcour will explain your design and these diamonds which of right belong to Miss Rusport will confirm your guilt the law Mrs Fulmer will make you speak tho' I can't Constable take charge of your prisoners  FULMER  Hold a moment Mr Stockwell you are a gentleman that knows the world and a member of parliament we shall not attempt to impose upon you we know we are open to the law and we know the utmost it can do against us Mr Belcour has been ill used to be sure and so has Miss Dudley and for my own part I always condemn'd the plot as a very foolish plot but it was a child of Mrs Fulmer's brain and she would not be put out of conceit with it  Mrs FULMER  You are a very foolish man Mr Fulmer so prythee hold your tongue  FULMER  Therefore as I was saying if you send her to Bridewell it won't be amiss and if you give her a little wholesome discipline she may be the better for that too but for me Mr Stockwell who am a man of letters I must beseech you Sir not to bring any disgrace upon my profession  STOCKWELL  'Tis you Mr Fulmer not I that disgrace your profession therefore begone nor expect that I will betray the interests of mankind so far as to shew favour to such incendiaries Take 'em away I blush to think such wretches should have the power to set two honest men at variance  Exeunt  Fulmer  c  CHARLES  Mr Belcour we have mistaken each other let us exchange forgiveness I am convinced you intended no affront to my sister and I ask your pardon for the expression I was betrayed into  BELCOUR  'Tis enough Sir the error began on my side and was Miss Dudley here I would be the first to atone  STOCKWELL  Let us all adjourn to my house and conclude the evening like friends you will find a little entertainment ready for you and if I am not mistaken Miss  Dudley and her father will make part of our company Come Major do you consent  O'FLAHERTY  Most readily Mr Stockwell a quarrel well made up is better than a victory hardly earned Give me your hand Belcour o' my conscience you are too honest for the country you live in And now my dear lad since peace is concluded on all sides I have a discovery to make to you which you must find out for yourself for deuce take me if I rightly comprehend it only that your aunt Rusport is in a conspiracy against you and a vile rogue of a lawyer whose name I forget at the bottom of it  CHARLES  What conspiracy Dear Major recollect yourself  O'FLAHERTY  By my soul I've no faculty at recollecting myself but I've a paper somewhere about me that will tell you more of the matter than I can When I get to the merchant's I will endeavour to find it  CHARLES  Well it must be in your own way but I confess you hare thoroughly rous'd my curiosity  Exeunt  SCENE II  STOCKWELL's  House  Capt DUDLEY LOUISA  and  STUKELY  DUDLEY  And are those wretches Fulmer and his wife in safe custody  STUKELY  They are in good hands I accompanied them to the Tavern where your son was to be and then went in search of you You may be sure Mr Stockwell will enforce the law against them as far as it will go  DUDLEY  What mischief might their cursed machinations have produced but for this timely discovery  LOUISA  Still I am terrified I tremble with apprehension lest Mr Belcour's impetuosity and Charles's spirit shou'd not wait for an explanation but drive them both to extremes before the mistake can be unravell'd  STUKELY  Mr Stockwell is with them Madam and you have nothing to fear you cannot suppose he wou'd ask you hither for any other purpose but to celebrate their reconciliation and to receive Mr Belcour's attonement  DUDLEY  No no Louisa Mr Stockwell's honour and discretion guard us against all danger or offence he well knows we will endure no imputation on the honour of our family and he certainly has invited us to receive satisfaction on that score in an amicable way  LOUISA  Wou'd to Heaven they were return'd  STUKELY  You may expect them every minute and see Madam agreeable to your wish they are here  Exit  SCENE III  CHARLES  enters and afterwards  STOCKWELL  and  O'FLAHERTY  LOUISA  O Charles O brother how cou'd you serve me so how cou'd you tell me you was going to Lady Rusport's and then set out with a design of fighting Mr Belcour But where is he where is your antagonist  STOCKWELL  Captain I am proud to see you an you Miss Dudley do me particular honour We have been adjusting Sir a very extraordinary and dangerous mistake which I take for granted my friend Stukely has explain'd to you  DUDLEY  He has I have too good an opinion of Mr Belcour to believe he cou'd be guilty of a design'd affront to an innocent girl and I am much too well acquainted with your character to suppose you cou'd abet him in such design I have no doubt therefore all things will be set to rights in very few words when we have the pleasure of seeing Mr Belcour  STOCKWELL  He has only stept into the comptinghouse and will wait upon you directly You will not be over strict Madam in weighing Mr Belcour's conduct to the minutest scruple his manners passions and opinions are not as yet affimilated to this climate he comes amongst you a new character an inhabitant of a new world and both hospitality as well as pity recommend him to our indulgence  SCENE IV  BELCOUR  enters bows to  Miss DUDLEY  BELCOUR  I am happy and asham'd to see you no man in his senses wou'd offend you I forfeited mine and err'd against the light of the sun when I overlook'd your virtues but your beauty was predominant and hid them from my sight I now perceive I was the dupe of a most improbable report and humbly entreat your pardon  LOUISA  Think no more of it 'twas a mistake  BELCOUR  My life has been compos'd of little else 'twas founded in mystery and has continued in error I was once given to hope Mr Stockwell that you was to have deliver'd me from these difficulties but either I do not deserve your confidence or I was deceiv'd in my expectations  STOCKWELL  When this lady has confirm'd your pardon I shall hold you deserving of my confidence  LOUISA  That was granted the moment it was ask'd  BELCOUR  To prove my title to his confidence honour me so far with your's as to allow me a few minutes conversation in private with you  She turns to her father  DUDLEY  By all means Louisa come Mr Stockwell let us go into another room  CHARLES  And now major O'Flaherty I claim your promise of a sight of the paper that is to unravel this conspiracy of my aunt Rusport's I think I have waited with great patience  O'FLAHERTY  I have been endeavouring to call to mind what it was I overheard I've got the paper and will give you the best account I can of the whole transaction  Exeunt  SCENE V  BELCOUR  and  LOUISA  BELCOUR  Miss Dudley I have solicited this audience to repeat to you my penitence and confusion How shall I atone What reparation can I make to you and virtue  LOUISA  To me there's nothing due nor any thing demanded of you but your more favourable opinion for the future if you should chance to think of me Upon the part of virtue I'm not empower'd to speak but if hereafter as you range thro' life you shou'd surprize her in the person of some wretched female poor as myself and not so well protected enforce not your advantage compleat not your licentious triumph but raise her rescue her from shame and sorrow and reconcile her to herself again  BELCOUR  I will I will by bearing your idea ever present in my thoughts virtue shall keep an advocate within me but tell me loveliest when you pardon the offence can you all pe  fect as you are approve of the offender As I now cease to view you in that false light I lately did can you and in the fulness of your bounty will you cease also to reflect upon the libertine addresses I have paid you and look upon me as your reform'd your rational admirer  LOUISA  Are sudden reformations apt to last and how can I be sure the first fair face you meet will not ensnare affections so unsteady and that I shall not lose you lightly as I gain'd you  BELCOUR  Because tho' you conquer'd me by surprize I have no inclination to rebel because since the first moment that I saw you every instant has improv'd you in my eyes because by principle as well as passion I am unalterably yours in short there are ten thousand causes for my love to you would to Heaven I could plant one in your soft bosom that might move you to return it  LOUISA  Nay Mr Belcour  BELCOUR  I know I am not worthy your regard I know I'm tainted with a thousand faults sick of a thousand follies but there's a healing virtue in your eyes that makes recovery certain I cannot be a villain in your arms  LOUISA  That you can never be whomever you shall honour with your choice my life upon't that woman will be happy it is not from suspicion that I hesitate it is from honour tis the severity of my condition it is the world that never will interpret fairly in our case  BELCOUR  Oh what am I and who in this wide would concerns himself for such a nameless such a friendless th  ▪ as I am I set Miss Dudley  not yet  your pardon  LOUISA  Nay that you are in full possession of  BELCOUR  Oh seal it with your hand then loveliest of women confirm it with your heart make me honourably happy and crown your penitent not with your pardon only but your love  LOUISA  My love  BELCOUR  By Heav'n my soul is conquer'd with your virtues more than my eyes are ravish'd with your beauty Oh may this fo  this sensit  ve alarm be happy be a  cious Doubt not deliberate not delay  If happiness be the end of life why do we sup  a moment▪  SCENE VI  O'FLAHERTY  enters and afterwards  DUDLEY  and  CHARLES  with  STOCKWELL  O'FLAHERTY  Joy joy joy sing dance leap laugh for joy Ha' done making love and fall down on your knees to every saint in the  for they're all on your side and honest St Patrick at the head of them  CHARLES  O Louisa such an event by the  chan  e in life we have discover'd a will of  grandfa  er's made in his last illness by which he out of my Aunt Rusport with a small annuity and leaves me heir to his whole estate with a fortune of fifteen thousand pounds to yourself  LOUISA  What is it you tell me O Sir instruct me to support this unexpected turn of fortune  To her f  ther  DUDLEY  Name not fortune 'tis he work of providence 'tis the justice of Heaven that wou'd not suffer innocence to be oppress'd nor your base aunt to prosper in her cruelty and cunning  A servant whispers Belcour and he goes out  O'FLAHERTY  You shall pardon me Capt Dudley but you must not overlook St Patrick neither for by my soul if he had not put it into my head to slip behind the screen when your righteous aunt and the lawyer were plotting together I don't see how you wou'd ever have come at the paper there that Master Stockwell is reading  DUDLEY  True my good friend you are the father of this discovery but how did you contrive to get this will from the lawyer  O'FLAHERTY  By force my dear the only way of getting any thing from a lawyer's clutches  STOCKWELL  Well Major when he brings his action of assault and battery against you the least Dudley can do is to defend you with the weapons you have put into his hands  CHARLES  That I am bound to do and after the happiness I shall have in sheltering a father's age from the vicissitudes of life my next delight will be in offering you an asylum in the bosom of your country  O'FLAHERTY  And upon my soul my dear 'tis high time I was there for 'tis now thirty long years since I sat foot in my native country and by the power of St Patrick I swear I think it's worth all the rest of the world put together  DUDLEY  Ay Major much about that time have I been heating the round of service and 'twere well for us both to  give over we have stood many a tough gale and abundance of hard blows but Charles shall lay us up in a little private but safe harbour where we'll rest from our labours and peacefully wind up the remainder of our days  O'FLAHERTY  Agreed and you may take it as a proof of my esteem young man that Major O'Flaherty accepts a favour at your Bands for by Heaven I'd sooner starve than say I thank you to the man I despise But I believe you are an honest lad and I'm glad you've trounc'd the old cat for on my conscience I believe I must otherwise have married her myself to have let you in for a share of her fortune  STOCKWELL  Hey day what's become of Belcour  LOUISA  One of your servants call'd him out just now and seemingly on some earnest occasion  STOCKWELL  I hope Miss Dudley he has aton'd to you as a gentleman ought  LOUISA  Mr Belcour Sir will always do what a gentleman ought and in my case I fear only you will think he has done too much  STOCKWELL  What has he done and what can be too much Pray Heaven it may be as I wish  aside  DUDLEY  Let us hear it child  LOUISA  With confusion for my own unworthiness I confess to you he has offer'd me  STOCKWELL  Himself  LOUISA  'Tis true  STOCKWELL  Then I am happy all my doubts my cares are over and I may own him for my sonWhy these are joyful tidings come my good friend assist me in disposing your lovely daughter to accept this returning prodigal he is no unprincipled no harden'd libertine his love for you and virtue is the same  DUDLEY  'Twere vile ingratitude in me to doubt his merit What says my child  O'FLAHERTY  Begging your pardon now 'tis a frivolous sort of a question that of yours for you may see plainly enough by the young lady's looks that she says a great deal though she speaks never a word  CHARLES  Well sister I believe the Major has fairly interpreted the state of your heart  LOUISA  I own it and what must that heart be which love honour and beneficence like Mr Belcour's can make no impression on  STOCKWELL  I thank you What happiness has this hour brought to pass  O'FLAHERTY  Why don't we all sit down to supper then and make a night on't  STOCKWELL  Hold here comes Belcour  SCENE VII  BELCOUR  introducing  Miss RUSPORT  BELCOUR  Mr Dudley here is a fair refugee who properly comes under your protection she is equipt for Scotland  but your good fortune which I have related to her seems inclin'd to save you both the journey Nay Madam never go back you are amongst friends  CHARLES  Charlotte  CHARLOTTE  The same that fond officious girl that haunts you every where that persecuting spirit  CHARLES  Say rather that protecting angel such you have been to me  CHARLOTTE  O Charles you have an honest but proud heart  CHARLES  Nay chide me not dear Charlotte  BELCOUR  Seal up her lips then she is an adorable girl her arms are open to you and love and happiness are ready to receive you  CHARLES  Thus then I claim my dear my destin'd wife  embracing her  SCENE VIII  Lady RUSPORT  enters  Lady RUSPORT  Heyday mighty fine wife truly mighty well kissing embracingdid ever any thing equal this Why you shameless husseyBut I won't condescend to waste a word upon youYou Sir you Mr Stockwell you fine sanctified fairdealing man of conscience is this the principle you trade upon Is this your neighbourly system to keep a house of reception for runaway daughters and young beggarly fortunehunters  O'FLAHERTY  Be advis'd now and don't put yourself in such a passion we were all very happy till you came  Lady RUSPORT  Stand away Sir hav'nt I a reason to be in a passion  O'FLAHERTY  Indeed honey and you have if you knew all  Lady RUSPORT  Come Madam I have found out your haunts dispose yourself to return home with me young man let me never see you within my doors again Mr Stockwell I shall report your behaviour depend on it  STOCKWELL  Hold Madam I cannot consent to lose Miss Rusport's company this evening and I am persuaded you won't insist upon it 'tis an unmotherly action to interrupt your daughter's happiness in this manner believe me it is  Lady RUSPORT  Her happiness truly upon my word and I suppose it's an unmotherly action to interrupt her ruin for what but ruin must it be to marry a beggar I think my sister had a proof of that Sir when she made choice of you  To Captain  Dudley  DUDLEY  Don't be too lavish of your spirits Lady Rusport  O'FLAHERTY  By my soul you'll have occasion for a sip of the cordial Elixir by and bye  STOCKWELL  It don't appear to me Madam that Mr Dudley can be call'd a beggar  Lady RUSPORT  But it appears to me Mr Stockwell I am apt to think a pair of colours cannot furnish settlement quite sufficient for the heiress of Sir Stephen Rusport  CHARLOTTE  But a good estate in aid of a commission may do something  Lady RUSPORT  A good estate truly where shou'd he get a good estate pray  STOCKWELL  Why suppose now a worthy old gentleman on his deathbed should have taken it in mind to leave him one  Lady RUSPORT  Hah what's that you say  O'FLAHERTY  O ho you begin to smell a plot do you  STOCKWELL  Suppose there should be a paper in the world that runs thus  "I do hereby give and bequeath all my estates real and personal to Charles Dudley son of my late daughter Louisa c c c"  Lady RUSPORT  Why I am thunderstruck by what contrivance what villany did you get possession of that paper  STOCKWELL  There was no villany Madam in getting possession of it the crime was in concealing it none in bringing it to light  Lady RUSPORT  Oh that cursed lawyer Varland  O'FLAHERTY  You may say that faith he is a cursed lawyer and a cursed piece of work I had to get the paper from him your ladyship now was to have paid him five thousand pounds for it I forc'd him to give it me of his own accord for nothing at all at all  Lady RUSPORT  Is it you that have done this Am I foil'd by your blundering contrivances after all  O'FLAHERTY  'Twas a blunder faith but as natural a one as if I'd made it o' purpose  CHARLES  Come let us not oppress the fallen do right even now and you shall have no cause to complain  Lady RUSPORT  Am I become an object of your pity then Insufferable confusion light amongst you marry and be wretched let me never see you more  Exit  CHARLOTTE  She is outrageous I suffer for her and blush to see her thus exposed  CHARLES  Come Charlotte don't let this angry woman disturb our happiness we will save her in spite of herself your father's memory shall not be stained by the discredit of his second choice  CHARLOTTE  I trust implicitly to your discretion and am in all things yours  BELCOUR  Now lovely but obdurate does not this example soften  LOUISA  What can you ask for more Accept my hand accept my willing heart  BELCOUR  O bliss inutterable brother father friend and you the author of this general joy  O'FLAHERTY  Blessing of St Patrick upon us all 'tis a night of wonderful and surprizing ups and downs I wish we were all fairly set down to supper and there was an end on't  STOCKWELL  Hold for a moment I have yet one word to interposeIntitled by my friendship to a voice in your disposal I have approv'd your match there yet remains a father's consent to be obtain'd  BELCOOUR  Have I a father  STOCKWELL  You have a father did not I tell you I had a discovery to make Compose yourself you have a father who observes who knows who loves you  BELCOUR  Keep me no longer in suspence my heart is soften'd for the affecting discovery and nature fits me to receive his blessing  STOCKWELL  I am your father  BELCOUR  My father Do I live  STOCKWELL  I am your father  BELCOUR  It is too much my happiness o'erpowers me to gain a friend and find a father is too much I blush to think how little I deserve you  They embrace  DUDLEY  See children how many new relations spring from this night's unforeseen events to endear us to each other  O'FLAHERTY  O my conscience I think we shall be all related by and bye  STOCKWELL  How happily has this evening concluded and yet how threatning was its approach let us repair to the supper room where I will unfold to you every circumstance of my mysterious story Yes Belcour I have  watch'd you with a patient but enquiring eye and I have discover'd thro' the veil of some irregularities a heart beaming with benevolence an animated nature fallible indeed but not incorrigible and your election of this excellent young lady makes me glory in acknowledging you to be my son  BELCOUR  I thank you and in my turn glory in the father I have gained sensibly imprest with gratitude for such extraordinary dispensations I beseech you amiable Louisa for the time to come whenever you perceive me deviating into error or offence bring only to my mind the Providence of this night and I will turn to reason and obey  EPILOGUE Written by D G ESQ SPOKEN BY Mrs ABINGTON  N B  The

beings seldom seen  They rose betimes and breakfasted as soon  On beef and beer then studied Greek till noon  Unpainted cheeks with bl  sh of health did glow  Beruff'd and fardingal'd from top to toe  Nor necks nor ancles would they ever shew  Learnt Greek  laughs  Our outside head takes half a day  Have we much time to dress the  inside  pray  No heads dress'd  à la Greque  the ancients quote
