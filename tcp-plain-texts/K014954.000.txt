 CASE MR MACKLIN LATE OF COVENTGARDEN THEATRE AGAINST  Mess Clarke Aldys Lee James and Miles  EDINBURGH PRINTED FOR AND SOLD BY JOHN AND JAMES AINSLIES Booksellers N  o  St Andrew's Street New Town  PRICE THREEPENCE  CASE  Nov  MR MACKLIN who had attempted the character of Macbeth at the Theatre in Covent Garden having given offence to the Town by some hasty accusations without sufficient proof against two or three brother players for interrupting him in his performance was discharged from that Theatre by order of a numerous Audience assembled as it should seem for that purpose On the curtain being drawn up the cry was  No Macklin  and it increased so much that to prevent the house from being pulled to  pieces the Managers complied with their desires and publicly discharged him after which there being no play ready the money was returned and the people dispersed  Feb  MR MACKLIN moved the Court of King's Bench against several persons for hissing and otherwise insulting him the last night he appeared in Covent Garden Theatre to perform the part of Shylock for preventing his going through the character and likewise for the loss of his bread The motion was rejected it being observed that as the Theatres were open for the reception and entertainment of that part of the Public who paid for their admission the Audience had a right to applaud condemn nay reject what Performers they thought proper but if any unjust combination was formed previous to the opening of  the house an action at Common Law might be grounded But in the instance then before the Court there did not appear any room for such plea and therefore he was advised to make his peace with the Town as speedily as possible Mr Macklin had retained the Attorney and SolicitorGeneral besides Mess Dunning Wallace cIt is said Mr Macklin had affidavits ready to produce  May  THE Court of King's Bench was moved by Mr Dunning on behalf of Mr Macklin for a Rule on six Gentlemen to shew cause why an information should not be filed against them for a riotous conspiracy to deprive Mr Macklin of his livelihood by forcing the Managers of Covent Garden Theatre to discharge Mr Macklin therefrom on the th November last which Rule the Court was pleased to grant accordingly  June  CAME on before the Court of King's Bench at Westminster the Complaint of Mr Macklin against six persons for a riotous conspiracy founded on private premeditated malice to deprive the said Mr Macklin of his bread by causing him to be expelled the Theatre last Winter The Court was pleased to grant an information against all but Mr Sparks The Bench recommended it to the Gentlemen to make restitution to Mr Macklin and to compromise the matter without bringing the cause to trial  Feb  CAUSE of Macklin against Clarke Aldys Lee James and Miles came on to be tried by way of indictment in the Court of King's Bench before Mr Justice Aston and a special Jury The indictment consisted of two counts the first specifying That on the th November the defendants had  been guilty of a riotthe other that they had been guilty of a conspiracy both in order to cause Mr Macklin to be dismissed from their Stage by the Patentees of Covent Garden Theatre The Judge after hearing the evidence and summing it up with accuracy and impartiality desired the Jury to exercise their judgement And if they thought the defendants guilty of both counts they were to find a verdict generally if only of one count they should find accordingly The Jury then withdrew and in about twenty minutes brought Clarke in guilty of the riot and the others of the conspiracy But judgement was deferred till next term  May  MR JUSTICE ASTON reported to the Court of King's Bench his minutes of the evidence on the trial of Messrs Leigh Miles James Adys and Clarke  on the th February last the four first of whom were convicted of a conspiracy and riot and the latter of a riot only in Covent Garden Theatre on the th November with intent to drive Mr Macklin from the StageLord Mansfield observed on the nature of the offence called it a national disgrace and in very severe terms reprobated the conduct of the parties concerned in it He said In the first stage of the business he had urgently advised the defendants to make Mr Macklin an adequate compensation for the great damage he had sustained that he then particularly pointed out as an adviseable measure the saving of the costs by putting an end to the matter at oncethat the lawexpences were now swelled to an enormous sum which sum the defendants themselves had given rise to by their obstinacy and want of prudenceSome time  was spent in the Courts endeavouring to make an amicable adjustment of the matter and a final conclusion of it Mr Colman was proposed as arbitergeneral which the defendants unanimously agreed to but Mr Colman declined the officeAt length Mr Macklin after recapitulating his grievances informed the Court that to shew he was no way revengeful with which he had been charged he would be satisfied with the defendants paying his lawexpences taking one hundred pounds worth of tickets on the night of his daughter's benefit a second hundred pounds worth on the night of his own benefit and a third on one of the managers nights when he should play This plan he observed was not formed on mercenary views Its basis was to give the defendants popularity and restore mutual amityLord Mansfield paid Mr Macklin very high  compliments on the honourable complexion and singular moderation of this proposal His Lordship declared it did him the highest creditthat generosity was universally admired in this country and there was no manner of doubt but the Public at large would honour and applaud him for his lenity His Lordship added further that notwithstanding his acknowledged abilities as an Actor he never acted better in his life than he had that day The proposal was accepted by the parties and the matter was thus endedDuring the course of the business Lord Mansfield took occasion to observe that the right of hissing and applauding in a Theatre was an unalterable right but that there was a wide distinction between expressing the natural sensations of the mind as they arose on what was seen and heard and executing a preconcerted design not only to hiss an  Actor when he was playing a part in which he was universally allowed to be excellent but also to drive him from the Theatre and promote his utter ruin  SOON after the above decision the Managers of Covent Garden Theatre met and generously agreed to give up their claim to the hundred pounds worth of tickets  FINIS
