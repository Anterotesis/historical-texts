 THE FATE OF SPARTA OR THE RIVAL KINGS A TRAGEDY AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE BY MRS COWLEY  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLXXXVIII Price One Shilling and Sixpence  TO JOHN COWLEY ESQ  WHEN letters were in their insancy and when knowledge and the arts were groping their way through seemingly impervious mists some splendid name was necessary to give an author celebrityhence the custom of DEDICATIONS hence those f  oods of adulation which poured from the press and outraged the feelings of the addresser and the addressed  But now when poets and writers of every denomination accept patronage only from the public and when fame is to be obtained only by deserving it the custom of dedicating can be continued only as a medium through which to convey personal respect It is  delightful  to make an offering to those we love when that offering has had a value stampt on it by the voice of the world Thus THE FATE OF SPARTA wreathed with laurel  seeks you in the recesses of a countinghouse and whilst you are engaged in supporting our  tional manufactures and invoking commerce from her di  ant abodes solicits your attention to the MUSES  When I hinted an intention to address this Tragedy to you you shrunk from the idea and desired me to choose a worthier name My dearest Brother where shall I  turn to find it THIS shall  not  be an address of adulation therefore I shall only observe that those to whom you are known will acknowledge that I am justified in the choice I have made of a patron and those who know you not will do my pride the credit to believe I should not have selected for that patron a man whose name and whose situation did not reflect honour on me  There is yet another motive for using my  poetic wand  to call your shade before posterity As your regard has been one of the chief blessings of my life I wish those who succeed us to know how much I hold myself indebted to it I wish my own children and yours to feel the sweet inf  uence of our mutual friendship and as they will carry in their veins the same blood to cherish in their hearts the same attachment DEAR Children who will wander again and again over this page after the hand which traces it moves no more after the heart to which it is addressed hath ceased to beat  I was going to conclude with this pensive idea but I recollect that I have not yet mentioned in  d  dicatory form  the work dedicated The following Tragedy then Sir is in its fable and events all inventionexcept in the conduct of Chelonice and the scene in the Templeand with the circumstance on which  that  is founded I have taken some liberties Other deviations from history will strike you but if I have altered circumstances I have  by CHARACTER Leonidas at DruryLane as in Sparta is artful tyrannic  and doats on his  aughter The impetuous and crafty Amphares who  had destroyed Agis continues his system Cleombrotus ambitious and tolerably obstinate is yet sensible to the merits of his wife He though my hero is not "a faultless monster"if the lady should be  too perfect  I appeal to the grave authority of Plutarch who I believe is not suspected of writing fictions to compliment women  Struck with admiration at the slight yet powerful touches with which that biographist had sketched the character of CHELONIS  In his Life of Agis  I wondered such a character had never been brought on the Stage to do honour to her sexyet I had joy in reflecting that this was precisely the age in which it ought to be done for this age boasted a Mrs SIDDONS  How much the FATE OF SPARTA has been indebted to that lady and to some of the other performers the public prints bear testimonyand I gratefully record it because it is a circumstance highly flattering to myself and because I wish the present I thus offer you to be surrounded with every appendage that can make you feel it inestimable  With the best wishes and affection I have the honour to be Your devoted humble servant H COWLEY  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY  MRS COWLEY  SPOKEN BY  MR WROUGHTON  TO ask your favour we're by custom bound  Thus Prologue bows before you to the ground  But interchange of favours we are told  Is a choice method to make friendship hold  My  gift is thisthose chilly wintry nights  Whilst the frost glitters and the north wind bites  I'll waft you to the gentlest summer skies  Where rosebuds swell and the soft zephyr flies  Where the bright sun with scarce diminish'd ray  November's month bids charm like florid May  Where beneath myrtle shades the lover dies  Whilst gales with fragrance fraught perfume his sighs  To GREECE I welcome ye from Drurylane  Where taste and arts first rear'd th' immortal fane  You've heard of Spartan boys who let young foxes  Feed on their blood placid as beaus in boxes  Sans  shriek or groan You've heard of sable broth  More priz'd than rich ieed creams and luscious froth  With many other monstiousnoble things  At which more  naughty  times have had their  ings  But long posterior to that virtuous day  Th' events were born on which we found our play  Sparta conceiv'd a whim to be polite  Black broth and  bosom  'd foxes took their flight  Then luxury her floodgates open'd wide  And fashion onward roll'd its heady tide  Plain dress and frugal meals soon dropt their yokes  And GODLIKE SPARTANSliv'd like other folks  Turn'd fidlers brokers merchants gamed and betted  This boasting what he  won  this what he  netted  Ladies their Op'raBoxers had their stage  And  Spartan Humphries'  soon became the rage  Their placemen sinecures could ne'er refuse  And zealinfected Lords at times turn'd Jews  Their Doctors sage then hit upon a plan  To mend the weak degen'rate creature Man  They bad two monarchs wear the splendid crown  Castor and Pollux likethis upthat down In another voice  Oh no they both at once must mount the throne  And subject slaves in double slav'ry groan  'Twas wise no doubtyet this too pass'd away  But first burst forth the deeds which fill our play  The groundwork truea little fancy grant  Where FACT had in its bounties been but scant  Poets will fib all nations have allow'd it  And ours with blushing terror has avow'd it  Oh pardon where you can and if YOU please  This anxious hour precedes a night of ease  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Leonidas  King of Sparta  Mr BENSLEY  Cleombrotus  the deposed

OR THE RIVAL KINGS A TRAGEDY  ACT I SCENE I  A Forest  In the back ground a Camp before the Walls of Sparta Enter  MEZENTIUS  and  COREX  COREX  THE conflict of the elements is past  The tempest which so lately seem'd to shake  The chrystal walls of heaven is appeas'd  And agitated nature sinks to rest  MEZENTIUS  Rather she bids the elements be still  That other conflicts may unfold their rage  Her  war is pastand now the war of men  The rush of armies and the shouts of death  Will shake this azure vault where rolling thunders  Hurrying but now the crooked lightnings on  Hail'd with grand horrors the devoted night  COREX  No wonder that Olympus should take part  When EMPIRES vibrate in the scales of fate  Not more illustrious was the hour in which  Enthroned Gods hung o'er the fate of Troy  And granted to celestial Juno's hate  A people's ruin  MEZENTIUS  The avengeful Gods  Look  so  on Sparta and its hoary tyrant  But where's Cleombrotus The trumpets sound  Yet sound to arms in vain Is  this  the leader  Who from the fields of Thrace and proud Iberia  Brought us to reap the richer spoils of Sparta  Where  is the courage which should lead us on  And rouse the tardy valour of his soldiers  COREX  Suspect his courage Oh his daring mind  Spurns at all dangers and his wellearn'd fame  Repels each hov'ring doubtPierce thou the wood  Where yonder cypress hides the dazzling moon  I'll this way bend my steps to seek the prince  For 'tis within these glades he shuns the camp  And to reflection gives his hours of glory  going  Trumpets sound  He hears Bellona's voice its powerful charm  Will break the spells of gloomy solitude  And give us back the warrior and the hero  Exeunt opposite sides  Enter  CLEOMBROTUS  CLEOMBROTUS  Resistless sounds ye chace my lethargy  And rouse the soldier in my languid heart  I'll yieldI'll yield it to the glorious impulse  O moon whose silver beams shed their pale splendor  On those proud spires adorning them for sacrifice  Shine on Ride cloudless thro' th' etherial plains  That when gigantic war strides o'er yon battlements  And prints in ev'ry street its sanguine steps  Guided by thee his iron arm may spare  All who invoke its mercy Thy chaste light  Shall lead the matron and the trembling maid  Inviolate to safetyMe it guides  To Chelonice the fell tyrant's daughter  Yet my lov'd wife  Dian  avert from her  And from my beauteous boy each hov'ring ill  That to this melting heart I yet may press them  And charm their terrors with the voice of love  Enter  MEZENTIUS  MEZENTIUS  At length then prince I've traced thy wand'ring steps  Th' impatient soldiers seek thee thro' the camp  E'en the hired mercenaries now boast ardors  And thou whose  all  depends on this grand moment  Retir'st to shades wrapt cooly in reflection  CLEOMBROTUS  Not cool Mezentius tho' alone and thoughtful  For oh my throbbing breast is  torn  with feeling  The mercenary's heart expands with joy  For the rude hour of plunder mine my soldier  Contracts with fear lest that wish'd hour should grasp  In undistinguish'd ruin her I love  With him who though her father I must hate  MEZENTIUS  These are a lover's fears  Contemptuously  CLEOMBROTUS  They are a husband's  When I considerin the rage of battle  What various ruins stalk beneath its banners  Not to be agoniz'd is not to feel  The engines which must level yonder towers  May as they play form Chelonice's grave  MEZENTIUS  She hath forsaken theeThis wife so lov'd  Hath left thy bosom for a tyrant father's  Who seeks thy life and robs thee of thy crown  And if I woman know  CLEOMBROTUS  Thou know'st not her  Her's is no common heartMelting with love  Alive to nature's softest impulses  Tend'rest of all the tender faithful sex  Yet where her duty bids she has a mind  Firm and unbending as the laws of truth  MEZENTIUS  Erring report hath spoke of her with honour  CLEOMBROTUS  With  highest  honour it shall speak yet err not  When th' Ephori bestowed on me the crown  Making me colleague with her faithless sire  Thou'st heard how soon his lust of power impell'd him  To seek my ruin and to reign alone  MEZENTIUS  His faction sunk and you became triumphant  CLEOMBROTUS  'Twas then Leonidas wrapt in despair  Fled to Minerva's altarChelonice  Followed him there leaving a splendid throne  And all the joys that wait on royalty  To weep and watch upon the dewy pavement  Where stretch'd she found an abdicated father  MEZENTIUS  Let Sparta's daughters then be nam'd with rev'rence  And proudly boast amongst the Grecian maids  They  breathe the air which nourish'd Chelonice  Have you not since oft woo'd her to your arms  CLEOMBROTUS  Oh yes and there to fold her would be transport  But in her heart the filial principle  So strongly burns that easier 'twere to woo  The murm'ring ringdove from her unfledg'd brood  Than her from him who gave the charmer life  She thinks his safety too hangs on her presence  Oh can I blame the cruel lovely duty  Which thus unwilling holds her from my arms  MEZENTIUS  Fortune benignant look upon this night  And a few hours shall see thee king and husband  CLEOMBROTUS  Dear glorious titles how my soul will grasp ye  MEZENTIUS  The soldiers all in arms await the signal  CLEOMBROTUS  First let the altar's blaze propitiate heaven  Mars and Bellona guide me in the battle  Precede my chariot nerve afresh my arm  And give me ardors to  command  my fate  The gen'rous transport labours in my breast  And conquest beams already on my helmet  SeeVict'ry bends from yonder starry seat  And waves her flag triumphant to the town  Goddess I come  Exit drawing his sword  Scene changes to the Palace of Leonidas  Enter  AMPHARES  and  NICRATES  meeting  NICRATES  Oh my Amphares what an hour for Sparta  AMPHARES  The hour indeed is busy and important  See how the streets are throng'd Each house pours forth  Its fearful inmates whilst the eager hum  Of the enquiring multitude that breaks  Like distant surges on the invaded ear  Tears the repose of balmy night's still sabbath  NICRATES  How wide th' event from the unblest design  When Agis the first colleague of our prince  Lost by ambitious arts his crown and life  The Ephori adjudg'd his vacant throne  To Chelonice's Lorduniting thus  The father and the son they hop'd to bind  The fate of Sparta in the wreathes of peace  AMPHARES  Weak shortliv'd hope for mutual jealousies  Soon sprung in either breast which nurs'd by faction  Grew strong and shook th' unwieldy fabric down  Whence are the king and princess  NICRATES  From the temple  Where vows and tears and immolated victims  Yet strive to smooth the sullen brow of fate  AMPHARES  Stern Fate demands far other immolations  Cleombrotus leads armies flesh'd and keen  As morning hounds when thro' the dew they course  The lightning footed stag who can preserve ye  NICRATES  The king himself let him invest Cleombrotus  With the disputed sceptre with the crown  Sparta adjudg'd him and his fathers wore  Surely your eye Amphares speaks a language  Too gayly placed for so sad a moment  AMPHARES  Brother my spirit was not made for peace  The burnish'd raven loves not more the tempest  In which he sails upborne by warring winds  Than I the tempest of contending states  'Tis in such storms superior natures rise  And find a station niggard Fate denied them  NICRATES  Kindred yet uncongenial are our souls  Hadst thou possess'd a mind less turbulent  Cleombrotus upon a steady throne  Had now been fix'd and Lacedemon's hopes  Nourish'd and blooming in the lap of peace  AMPHARES  Never for spite of old Lycurgus' law  Which doom'd us to be rul'd by double tyranny  A  biarchy  beyond each mode of slav'ry  Mad power e'er fram'd to gall a nation's neck  Is that which least admits of peace or rule  'Twas  therefore  I dethron'd Cleombrotus  But with such secret and coercive skill  That he believes me yet his friend  NICRATES  Leonidas  And he  together  reign'd  together  sway'd  The Spartan sceptre nor did hellborn discord  Disturb thro' six autumnal suns their peace  Ten months Leonidas hath reign'd  alone  And all is anarchy distress and war  AMPHARES  And all shall so remain 'till I have work'd  Thro' all these tempests for myself a day  Glowing with brightness and unceasing lustre  I would unfold my heart yet more but see  The king and beauteous Chelonice come  Enter  LEONIDAS  and  CHELONICE  with Guards and Attendants  LEONIDAS  Let all the troops be gather'd on the ramparts  The troops  Let ev'ry man whose arm can wield a sabre  Let beardless boys and indolent old age  Rouse at the callThose leave their darling sports  And these forget their acheslet all unite  To crush the hopes and arms of proud Cleombrotus  CHELONICE  Oh  LEONIDAS  Why sigh'st thou Chelonice  Can  thy heart  Say  dares  it feel one evanescent pang  That a rebellious foe shall be opposed  And perish  CHELONICE  That foe is Chelonice's husband  LEONIDAS  Grant that he is is not  his  foe thy father  Oh speak would'st have me be his slave or conqueror  pausing  Unduteous silence which too strongly speaks  Thou would'st behold me dragg'd beneath this dome  My aged limbs embrac'd by iron shackles  My timeblanch'd head dash'd on the marble floor  Because  the perpetrator of those ills  Is the lov'd husband of my only child  sneeringly  CHELONICE  That he's the husband of thy only child  Heaven and thyself doth knowBut when that child  Forgets amidst her griefs that thou'rt her father  When she forsakes thee in the hour of sorrow  Or owns a duty to thy conqueror  Then may the Gods be deaf to all her pray'rs  And shame and infamy weigh down her name  LEONIDAS  Then daughter banish from your brow these clouds  Which boldly censure whom thy speech yet spares  Enter  ATTALUS  Hasty thy stepsthy news  ATTALUS  One from the camp  Seiz'd and impell'd by tortures hath confest  Cleombrotus this night triumphant means  To fix his standards on thy palace gates  His mercenary army mad for plunder  And all the various rapines claim'd by victors  Urge on our fateThe miners now beneath us  Form for the quick a wide capacious grave  The batt'ring rams already rear their heads  Threat'ning our walls with sudden dissolution  LEONIDAS  Why then let ruin come'tis my election  Near twenty years I've borne the Spartan sceptre  And shall I at his bidding fling it from me  Like a light toy of which possession cloys me  No I'll reign stilland still  alone  will reign  Or give up life and sovereignty together  ATTALUS  Unhappy Sparta then thy fate is fix'd  T' oppose is vain let's stand aloof and watch  The gath'ring cloud which bursting will destroy us  LEONIDAS  How slave what murmur at my will Dispute  His word whose breath annihilates thy race  What are ye all but creatures of my breath  I doom ye liferejoice I bid ye die  Sink silent to your graves  Now Chelonice  Prepare thy mind for this night's great event  For ere its circling minutes have been number'd  Thou'lt in thy father's blood walk to his throne  Or see thy husband welt'ring at my feet  Thy heart  must  make a choiceFor one of us  Thy prayers must mount to heavenTell me not which  Lest this old heart's last pangs be render'd stronger  Lest thy fierce husband's sword within my breast  Should bite more keenknowing that there 'twas sped  By a lov'd daughter's wishes  Exit followed by all but Nicrates  NICRATES  observing Chelonice  Fix'd and mute  She gives to grief a force beyond the storm  Of common female woesPardon me Princess  Oh break a silence which too strongly  speaks  Flow precious tears and give her sorrows vent  CHELONICE  Tears Nicrates dost think such woes as mine  Can melt in tearsBid  lighter  sorrows weep  Mine shall be cloister'd in my sick'ning heart  NICRATES  Alljudging Heaven What then are power and beauty  What all the virtues which adorn the mind  Since all united can't ensure repose  CHELONICE  My soul hath fortitude but oh its griefs are keen  How shall I shape its wishes how my heart  Compel to prayer when ev'ry hope it scrms  Such is my horrid fate must be a crime  Either against my father or my lord  NICRATES  Oh that I'd words  CHELONICE  This is a night of deeds  Such deedsAnd cannot Ioh cannot I  Whom most those deeds concern by one bold act  Turn from my fated race the ills which threaten  Hear me OlympusRegal Juno hear  Inspire your suppliantsend a ray of light  To guide me in the darkness which surrounds me  NICRATES  The last sad ray thy father hath extinguish'd  Since  you  can't move his purpose all is lost  E'en whilst we speak destruction hastens on  This very hour your husband leaves the camp  CHELONICE  eagerly  Enough thou'st said itHeaven speaks through thee  My husband and the campyes to the camp  I'll bend my lonely and advent'rous steps  There to his heart I'll plead my father's cause  Wrest from his strong resentments all I ask  And bring back strength to Sparta's tott'ring walls  NICRATES  Oh Princess 'tis the sudden thought of frenzy  The campthink on the dangers  CHELONICE  Oh what are dangers when such  duties  call  The spirit of my ancestors is on me  A sacred fervor seizes on my soul  A fire unknown glows in my trembling veins  And chases from my heart each female weakness  NICRATES  Heroism  How false to say thou'rt only made for man  CHELONICE  My  father  and my  country  Oh for these  Fearless I'd lead an army to a breach  Scale hostile walls and leap like him of Macedon  Amidst the foe and whilst the whizzing deaths  Sigh'd round my head  Scorn their mock terrors and their painless wounds  NICRATES  Prudence avauntStrong ardors in a cause  Righteous as this seem the still voice of fate  That thus in secret whispers urges on  To perfect its decrees  CHELONICE  Yet I'll not slight  The sage precautions prudence would suggest  These royal weeds ill suit a wanderer's speed  The habit of a priestess thall conceal me  Hallowed  beneath that sacred robe I pass  Nor friend nor foe presume to know my errand  That errand sanctify all ye who rule  The actions of mankind Howe'er design'd  Howe'er begun our deeds yours is the end  We mark the goal and blind begin our race  In paths diverging from the happy place  'Tis ye who guide us in the way unknown  The motive ours th' events are all your own  END OF THE FIRST ACT

Thracians at the eastern gate  I will myself lead on my loyal Spartans  Then if I fall I fall 'midst those whose rights  I should too cheaply purchase with my life  If I am conqueror with  them  to conquer  Will add to victory a sweeter sense  And make my laurels dearer than my crown  COREX  Live princelive ever on the throne of Sparta  CLEOMBROTUS  He only lives a  prince  who lives a  patriot  And he who loves not those he's rais'd to govern  Is not their monarch but their scourge  MEZENTIUS  The night wears on and thy devoted army  Demand to place thee ere its noon be past  Upon that seat thou know'st so well to fill  CLEOMBROTUS  Instant I'll join and lead them to the battle  Their force superior and their honest cause  Must doubly act upon our fearstruck foes  And bid them spare the horrors of a carnage  Enter Officer  Thy face hath tidings  Officer  From the town a priestess  With hasty steps and accents that breathe music  Sweet and resistless as the golden lyre  Of beamyhair'd Apollo seeks thy tent  Royal Cleombrotus  CLEOMBROTUS  A priestess say'st thou  Surely of magnitude must be the errand  Which asks a messenger so pure and holy  Retire my friends 'tis due to rank like her's  In a few moments he who bids you go  Shall bid ye  follow  Nor will he stop 'till his glad voice shall hail you  Victors in Sparta  they go  Now attend the virgin  The officer goes out and reenters with  CHELONICE  Thus holy maid lowly and wondering  I greet your presenceOh what great behest  Can have impell'd thee from thy hallow'd couch  To seek amidst the hurry of a camp  A careworn soldier  CHELONICE  Couch Cleombrotus  Dost thou then think within the mournful walls  These feet have left that one unfeeling wretch  Can seek a couch or meditate repose  Thou  hast our sleepOur balmly rest lies tenter'd  On the sharp points thou'st levell'd at our hearts  Restore  our rest bid the soft God of sleep  Again revisit our long watchful lids  It is for this I seek thee in thy camp  For this that humbly in the dust I bend  Asking thy pity for our wretched Sparta  CLEOMBROTUS  But that I dare not touch thy sacred form  Thou  should'st  not humbly bendOh Priestess rise  She rises  If this thy errand to our martial plain  'T were well the fire that burns within your temple  Yet felt your feeding handYour altars virgin  They are the places for your prayers to rise from  There mix'd with incense they might reach Olympus  But here alas they fall on sterile earth  Or must return unanswer'd to your bosom  CHELONICE  Oh is it possible Canst thou who own'st  A soldier's gen'rous feelings think a moment  On the dread horrors of this waning night  And yet resolve to pull those horrors on us  CLEOMBROTUS  Bid your own sov'reign save ye Oh Leonidas  How wretched is this art Yield me my crown  And not descend to seek the aid of women  To deprecate the vengeance thou provok'st  CHELONICE  Oh by the flame that burns to chaste Minerva  Leonidas  stoops  not to supplicate  Knows not the step that I unprompted take  Well dost thou know his haughty princely soul  That lighter holds the heavy ills thou'rt charg'd with  Than to submit and invocate thy pity  CLEOMBROTUS  'Tis well his firmness shall be firmly met  Return then priestess let your king prepare  His roughest welcome for unbidden guests  His roughest welcome we have sworn to merit  And not a heart within this banner'd field  But will sustain the arm his oath hath bound  CHELONICE  Oh for a voice to  perjure  them  'Twere a celestial crime Cleombrotus  Is there not one voiceStubborn ask thy heart  Is there not one could move thee Chelonice  CLEOMBROTUS  Oh name her not her image ruins me  Her form her supplicating lookresist her  Oh she could drag me from the arms of glory  And bid me stop with vict'ry

impatient soldiery Lead on  I'll follow with an arrow's swiftnessSpare  Spare me one momentMars 'tis thus thou hang'st  clasping her  Upon the breath of Venus thus anticipat'st  The dear reward of Victory then dart'st  Amidst thy foes and by her touch inspir'd  Hurl'st thy bright vengeance o'er th' insanguin'd field  CHELONICE  Dost thou deceive me  this  the power of Chelonice  Goes to the wing  Stay your rash speed your prince commands yeStop  Stir not 'till he shall  lead  ye to your spoil  Yes lead them to their spoil thou mighty General  Guide your keen hunters where the tim'rous deer  In their inclosures herded wait their fate  The conquest will be worthy them and thee  CLEOMBROTUS  Oh my beloved be worthy of thyself  And of the fate with which the moment teems  I wrest this night my crown from usurpation  To place it on thy brow  CHELONICE  To decorate my bier  Ne'er shall the crown torn from Leonidas  Circle his childBut go lead on your army  Here will I patient wait your cries of victory  The signal of my death  CLEOMBROTUS  as to himself  Oh woman  CHELONICE  'Tis not a woman's but a SPARTAN's threat  The hour in which thou vanquishest Leonidas  Prepare the pile to flame around his daughter  CLEOMBROTUS  Princess thou dost mistake thy dutySpartan  And daughter of Leonidas are titles  Dearest to thee  CHELONICE  Mistake my duty said'st thou  When at a husband's feet I ask a father's life  Do I  mistake  my dutyIf I do  I'll ever so mistake and boast my error  Yes 'till Leonidas sits thron'd in safety  His daughter shall forget she is a wife  Tear from her heart each trace of long past fondness  And own no ties but those first awful ones  Stampt there by nature  CLEOMBROTUS  Wife of Cleombrotus  Thy honour and thy fame's deriv'd from him  Thy happiness from the same source should flow  How dear those hoursfor sure such hours have been  When thou disclaim'st all joys but in my love  CHELONICE  Hadst thou found bliss in love  CLEOMBROTUS  smiling  I'd not sought bliss on thrones  Thus as a lady would you chide and this  Let all the  subject  world receive as law  Let them be taught that in the humble shade  Far from the reach of proud ambition's eye  Felicity has rais'd her grassy seat  And wantons there with love  But madam I was born to reign  And he  so  born feels fires that vulgar souls  Could not endureFelicity to us  Is not a nymph in humble russet clad  Sipping the dewdrops from the silver thorn  Or weaving flow'rs upon a streamlet's brink  Oh no she's SCEPTER'D and her gifts are CROWNS  CHELONICE  I have a soul to taste her gifts like thine  I have a mind that grasps sublimer cares  Than cottage nymphs can know I would be great  And bear the cares of thousandsBut ambition  And ev'ry lofty sentiment it gives  Sinks to the earth when weigh'd against  his  life  From whom I drew my own  CLEOMBROTUS  Were I dispos'd  To grant thee  all  and sink again to nothing  Yet am I  bound  to lead my forces on  It is not glory nor the hope of same  The mercenary feelshis God is plunder  Should I protract their promis'd hour of harvest  Disgust and mutiny would fill their ranks  I cannot dare not yield to thee  CHELONICE  Farewell  I'll be the herald of thy near approach  The child shall bid the father bare his bosom  To her lord's swordshall bid the citizens  Throw wide their portals to admit the conqueror  Then whilst my Spartans bow their necks beneath thee  And from a  parricide  receive their chains  Then shall the last sad sighs of Chelonice  Mix'd with the shouts of victory proclaim  Her murd'rous husband Lacedemon's king  going  CLEOMBROTUS  The last sad sighs of CheloniceOh  following and leading her back  Sweet cruel tyrant who is victor now  Nature in mockery thou stil'st us LORDS  And bidst us govern in this turbid world  Th' historic page recording all the acts  That stand the loftiest in an empire's annals  Reports but WOMAN's will  CHELONICE  Then thou dost yield  How my soul thanks thee peaceful hours shall tell  Now on joy's swiftest pinions let me bear  The grateful tidings to the gates of Sparta  Oh filial duties be ye ever crown'd  With joy as pure as blesseth Chelonice  Exit led by Cleombrotus  Enter  MEZENTIUS  and  COREX  MEZENTIUS  The conf'rence thou hast heardWhere now the hopes  The high rais'd hopes we brought with us from Thrace  COREX  They must exist no moreShe who could win him  To spare her Lacedemon but an hour  Now when th' impatient soldiery pant for conquest  And ev'ry breast glows with portentous ardor  Next may like Omphale transform her Hercules  To story in the loom his  bloodless  siege  MEZENTIUS  But Thrace boasts warriors of more stubborn nerves  They neither know to yield to woman's threats  Or man's defiance The laconic prince  Entic'd us from our native fields to curb  Those rebel citizens who yet disown  His rights in Lacedemon our reward  Their herds their jewels and their treasur'd wealth  Must we forego the riches he affianc'd  Because his Chelonice begs forbearance  COREX  No  The wages of our labour are at hand  Our troops obedient why then not assault  The city we came hither to reduce  And gather for ourselves the promis'd blessings  MEZENTIUS  Our country's genius Corex speaks in thee  Astrea throw thy useless balance by  Thy  sword  is all we askhe who bears that  Can right himself and punish his deceivers  COREX  Let caution guard her sword Cleombrotus  Supported by th' Iberians may prevent  The glorious perfidy we meditate  Revolt seems ripeSee how resentment burns  Looking thro' the wing  Amongst the troops whilst he unfolds his will  To spare Leonidas for this one night  The pain to be unking'd  Contemptuously  MEZENTIUS  Let us assist  Fanning with secret breath the struggling flame  And then this  woman  's soldier shall be taught  Those grand events which mark the fate of empires  And stand protruded to instruct the world  Are not the coin of female artifice  But struck by genius from a  bolder  dye  Exeunt  Scene changes to the Palace  Enter  LEONIDAS  and  AMPHARES  LEONIDAS  Forsaken by my child It should be so  This is an hour of congregated woes  And the barb'd point of that should not be wanting  Doth the enemy advanceLeft by my daughter  Left for a rebel husbandThey are too tardy  Destruction slow of foot to those who'd meet thee  Quicken thy pace  AMPHARES  Destruction hastens on  The princess fled and longing for thy crown  Urges her husband to th' unnatural conquest  LEONIDAS  I do not cursemark me I do not curse them  Leonidas and cruelty are sounds  That in the mind of Greece combine and live  Like pestilence and its funereal urns  Am I  now  cruel Those late turbid veins  In which such raging fires have cours'd each other  Have now no pulse for cruelty Yet should I  Oh the thought rouses all my latent fury  Should  I amidst the battle meet those pelicans  Gods grant me such a moment that my life  In that last closing act may end more blest  Than crowns and vengeance ever made its progress  NICRATES  without  Where is the king  enters  LEONIDAS  Here's he who in an hour  Shall be the king no more  NICRATES  Not so Leonidas  The enemy whose late deserted camp  Pour'd all its eager troops upon the plain  Are hous'd again beneath their tented roofs  Their banners clos'd their spears' bright gleams extinguish'd  LEONIDAS  How is this known  NICRATES  Cloudless the full orb'd car  Of the nocturnal goddess glides along  Giving each object perfect and distinct  The crouded ramparts bless'd the fav'ring light  Which shew'd their foes retiring and unarm'd  AMPHARES  This is some subterfuge The subtle princess  And her ambitious lord have fram'd the artifice  To lull thee valiant prince in false security  LEONIDAS  Well hast thou spoken what thy  King  conceiv'd  But who shall speak the  father's  mad despair  Oh Isis when thou threw'st th' unfeeling flints  And bade them rise to animated  man  They disobey'd thee  woman's  was the form  In which they sprung to life in which they yet  Cumber the earthour cherish'd bosom'd plagues  NICRATES  Oh sir forbear the virtues of the princess  LEONIDAS  Mention her not henceforth to name the rebel  But with the curse of parricide is fatal  To him who speaksFly to your several stations  The cred'lous citizens have lost their fears  But I'll restore and fix them in their hearts  To live a sov'reign but one added day  Is worth the labour of an untir'd Hercules  Exit  NICRATES  Stay my prompt brother you may snatch a moment  From duty  so  impos'dYour's is the storm  Which rages in his heart against his daughter  AMPHARES  I know I rais'd the storm and there will feed it  NICRATES  Hah to what endwhat purpose  AMPHARES  I'll reveal it  Not to that air of menace which I scorn  But to thy love fraternal which insures me  Ready attention and if needful help  NICRATES  One bosom fed us with it's lucid stream  One father gave to us a dear existence  And in my  heart  I prize each sacred bond  Yet not those bonds the father whom we lov'd  Not the chaste mother at whose breast we clung  Shall bribe me to forget superior duties  Or aid thee in a cause disclaim'd by virtue  AMPHARES  sneeringly  Warm from the schools and prompt in declamation  NICRATES  Not so  The plain simplicity of Spartan schools  Disclaims and abrogates misleading eloquence  You bred in Athenswhere the polish'd virtues  Luxuriantly repose giving their documents  In marble palaces and robes imbued  With ev'ry gaudy stain that paints their fields  'Tis you who boast th' unthrifty charms of rhetoric  Which makes a shadow seem substantial good  And cloaths with glowing periods crippled morals  Yet let me know  why  thou inflam'st the king  Against the paragon of female excellence  AMPHARES  A Paragon I thought her and her birth  Which call'd her dower a kingdom fixed me her's  Our line a scion from that root whence sprung  Leonidaswhich justified my hopes  In Athens 'twas I learn'd Cleombrotus  Was made her husband and coequal king  Had I been here the Hymen of that day  Had dipp'd his saffron robe in sanguine dies  NICRATES  But now  AMPHARES  But  now  my hatred is in youthful vigour  And I have sworn their ruin  NICRATES  Sworn their ruin  AMPHARES  Interrogative brother yestheir  deaths  Were they no more then Lacedemon's free  And who could stand 'twixt me and royalty  But a weak boy whose tender bud of life  Fatality or accident may nip  What dost thou mutter spells with eyes thus fix'd  NICRATES  steadily  Nor spells nor pray'rs for surely they were lost  Nor shall I  reason  on thy wicked hopes  Nor bid thee dread the vengeance of the Gods  For to a mind that such designs can cherish  Reason religion urge their truths in vain  Then fear not these but fear my vigilance  Go on spread all thy toils prepare thy snares  And I will watch observe and  counteract  thee  Exit  AMPHARES  Oh insolent and vain oppose me not  Counteract him who struggles for a crown  Him who dares raise his hopes to Sparta's princess  Thy gentle breath might hope as well good brother  To puff a mountain from its solid base  As to move  me  from purposes so grand  Thou talk'st of virtueI behold a THRONE  Thou bidst me fearI think on CHELONICE  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III SCENE I  The Tribunal  Enter  LEONIDAS AMPHARES SARPEDON ATTALUS  and others  LEONIDAS  YES the bright sun beholds me yet a king  Cleombrotus is yet  without  our walls  For this let ev'ry altar blaze with sacrifice  And hallow'd victims pour the sanguine stream  AMPHARES  In vain shall hallow'd victims pour their life  And blood of hecatombs bedew our altars  Whilst treason deep veil'd spreads out her silent snares  LEONIDAS  Her veil shall be remov'd her snares develop'd  Here in this awful seat where great Lycurgus  Woo'd justice from her high  Olympian  court  And bade her rule  unsway'd  by human ties  Here shall Leonidas his glory emulate  And rise above the pleaded bonds of nature  Say didst thou find the princess bath'd in sorrows  SARPEDON  Not lost in tears but in more stately griefs  Her virgins tell she pass'd the sleepless night  Denied to vindicate her secret visit  AMPHARES  Whether in tears or sorrows more reserv'd  Women express their passions or their will  They're each resistless arms whose edge is bluntless  But sir you're guarded  LEONIDAS  To a test I'll bring  Her vaunted duty if it shrinks from that  Hence tears and feign'd submission Not a child  But a false traitor will she stand before me  And lose a sire in the offended prince  He seats himself  AMPHARES  See she advances with her wonted grandeur  Yet so compos'd and calm as if prepar'd  Not to  receive  but  grant  a gracious pardon  Enter the Princess attended by Nicrates guards c  LEONIDAS  Ill daughter suits it with such acts as yours  To come with looks thus unimpress'd before us  Repentant tears and cheeks ting'd deep with shame  Would best become your guilty disobedience  CHELONICE  Oh may my cheeks indeed be ting'd with shame  And tears repentant yet unheeded flow  When guilt or disobedience mark the life  Of wretched CheloniceOh my father  Whence are those charges  LEONIDAS  From the mouth of Sparta  Who stiles those traitors that support her foes  Princess of Sparta know this charge is thine  CHELONICE  If I've incurr'd it may the death she dooms  To traitors fall on meNot  daughter  now  But subject and arraign'd I bend before thee  Not to a father pleading but a  judge  LEONIDAS  'Tis Lacedemon calls thee to the trial  CHELONICE  Nay but all Greece will turn their eyes towards thee  And as thou act'st at this important hour  Will load thy name with honour or dispraise  Beware of weakness thenwith rigour try me  And if the crime imputed should be mine  Then Agamemnon like devote thy child  A sacrifice to your immortal fame  The world demands such lessonsOh suppose not  I should disgrace the glorious part assign'd me  The daughter of Leonidas can't fear to die  LEONIDAS  Such firmness should by innocence be sanction'd  Last night disguis'd you pass'd our centinels  Bending your steps where your rebellious husband  Plots Lacedemon's ruin'Tis your  motive  To this mysterious visit we demand  CHELONICE  Behold it in your undemolish'd walls  Behold it Sparta in thy lofty spires  Which yet triumphant catch the sailing clouds  See it ye mothers in the tender babes  Reposing safely on your matron bosoms  And you ye husbands in whose shelt'ring arms  Your wives yet live inviolate and pure  Those were the motives of my secret visit  LEONIDAS  Do Sparta's welfare and her matrons' honour  Hang on a thread so slender Do her battlements  Her long enduring walls and brazen gates  Resist destruction at a woman's bidding  CHELONICE  Forgive the seeming boast Yet had not Chelonice  Last night stole secret to her husband's camp  And there with every art  love  makes resistless  Won him to change the purpose of the hour  This roof beneath whose dome she stands accus'd  Had now resounded with the shrieks of death  Whilst thro' our gates Thrace and Iberia pour'd  With mercenary hand their slaught'ring troops  LEONIDAS  If  such  thy purpose and if  such  th' event  Then daughter Lacedemon owes to thee  That she enjoys one added day in safety  Short respite from impending woes  Were 't in thy power to  prolong  her safety  And banish from her skies those hov'ring locusts  Oh could'st thou for an end so sanctified  Boldly resolve to be a  Spartan daughter  And tear unworthy weakness from thy heart  CHELONICE  My heart itself What  is  there can exist  That I'd  not  sacrifice to save my country  And bid my father live  LEONIDAS  rising  Glorious the moment 'twould be fame immortal  The name of Chelonice shall be heard  Wherever female acts of worth and daring  Rescue the sex and make them shine o'er man  Thy worthless husband  ceas'd  he to exist  Thrace and Iberia would withdraw their troops  And Sparta rest from curs'd intestine wars  Invite him from his camppropose this night  To meet him in the grovehe shall be met  By arms less tender than my Chelonice's  CHELONICE  Horror  LEONIDAS  Dost shrinkare those thy boasted fervors  CHELONICE  It was my father 'twas my father spoke it  I have no answer  LEONIDAS  Rebel thy answer's made  For now I know 'twas but a false pretence  With which thou'st gloss'd thy visit to the traitor  Traitor thyself and leagued with Sparta's foes  CHELONICE  O filial goddess teach me to submit  LEONIDAS  Submission now is all the duty left thee  And thou shalt learn to practise it in chains  Bear her to prison as a rebel guard her  And let her son be captive with his mother  CHELONICE  That's mercy yet amidst the judge's firmness  The parent's love steps in to chase despair  Bring here my chains  They bring and put them on  AMPHARES  to Leonidas  Th' opposing principles  Of filial duty and connubial love  Summon their forces in her heart and one must yield  Forgive if in the conflict filial duty fails  And gives the dearbought triumph to a husband  CHELONICE  Who told thee that those principles oppose  Or that one yields Has nature then improvident  So narrow form'd the heart that only  one  Of all the various duties she commands  Can live there Know misjudging reasoner  The duties of the wife and child may each  Without opposing warm the heartIn mine  They both existboth flaming  Spartan  Spare the princess  Second Spartan  Leonidas oh hear us  Third Spartan  Spare thy child  NICRATES  O spare the princess see th' astonish'd citizens  With supplicating looks bending before thee  Shall they implore in vain They ask a sire  To breathe forth mercy on a sorrowing child  O hear their prayers  Mine  is the voice of Sparta  CHELONICE  Plead for a rebel Pity how misplaced  addressing the citizens  Should  I  be spared the door for treason's open'd  Nor could your prince dare punish in another  The crime his child unforfeited commits  He wisely acts and thus I clasp my chains  Calling the gods to witness they are  dear  to me  For they're a father's giftperhaps his last  Lead to my prison murmur not be proud  That in your sov'reign you have found a  hero  Who'll punish those most precious to his heart  When crimes against  your  rights call down his vengeance  Lead on  Exit with guards c  AMPHARES  See selfarraign'd the princess goes  Acknowledging the justice which condemns her  To the citizens  LEONIDAS  She may be innocent yet to refuse  A sacrifice which patriotic love  And filial duty equally demand  Is in itself a crime to merit chains  Amphares speak is there no way Cleombrotus  Would come as  Gen'ral  with a train too costly  For the charge of SpartaIs there no way  To gain a private solitary visit  By Heaven the man who should perform such service  I'd rank for ever next my crown and life  AMPHARES  Swift execution ever should attend  The will of princes when that will's reveal'd  Methinks there might be found a man in Sparta  Who brided thus highly would despise the danger  And call it glory so to save his country  LEONIDAS  If such a man there bethou know'st the rest  Time presses hard my friend and fate allows  But a few hours for acts whose fame shall live  Through ages yet unbornI'll leave thee now  Genius of Sparta aid th' unripe design  Exit  AMPHARES  contemptuously  "Genius of Sparta" Dost think  me  to cozen  With patriotic flames or that I see not  'Tis thy ambition which assumes its port  No matter know they're  my  designs thou nourishest  And whilst I seem but to obey I rule  Exit  Scene changes to the Tent of Cleombrotus  Enter  CLEOMBROTUS  followed by  MEZENTIUS  CLEOMBROTUS  By Heaven the man who stirs towards the town  With hostile views shall find his death not there  But from my arm Nor will I bear these murmurs  Lead back your madd'ning Thracians who appear  Like midnight wolves snuffing the air for prey  Rather than soldiers bravely met to right  An injured king  MEZENTIUS  So think them Midnight wolves  Will not retire  without  their scented prey  Resolve then to dismiss or lead them on  CLEOMBROTUS  I can do neither I am bound by oath  An oath revered by him who shakes Olympus  Not to begin the attack 'till this day's sun  Resigns the race to him who gilds tomorrow  MEZENTIUS  What  forc'd  thee to the binding oath  CLEOMBROTUS  To tell thee  Obdurate Thracian were to give thee words  Whose foreign sounds would vibrate on thy ear  But could not raise ideas in thy mind  What dost  thou  know of all the sacred charms  Which hang on love connubial Why tell  thee  Of the sweet philtres on the rosy lips  Of chaste yet tender beauty Ears like thine  Would find no music in the tale nor own  'Twas a sweet madness so to be undone  MEZENTIUS  Undone indeed  CLEOMBROTUS  Yet not undoneMy promise  Binds me but a few hoursEre the blue heavens  Shall in its present station see again  You radiant orbby arms or peaceful terms  I shall be king in Sparta  MEZENTIUS  Hopes of coward peace  Were not the prospects thou held'st forth to draw us  From our dear homes  CLEOMBROTUS  True war and victory  Seem'd then the road to lead me to my throne  But should Leonidas propose those terms  On which I  must  consent to raise the siege  Then rich rewards shall gratify your troops  Without the crimson labour which they pant for  Going to one of the upper wings  MEZENTIUS  Our troops will not accept a largess prince  Where they can claim a right and on thyself  Rest all the mischief of thy broken faith  CLEOMBROTUS  Behold the messenger of peace approaches  What humbler cause could make  Amphares  messenger  His rank exalted and his skill in arms  Render him precious to the town besieged  MEZENTIUS  You wish the conference privateMay th' event  Be happier prince than that of yester even  When a false priestess could entice a vict'ry  From youOh shame whilst grasping at its laurels  Exit  CLEOMBROTUS  Unfurl your banners why breathe not the trumpets  Receive that Spartan Lord with the salute  You give your generals and conduct him hither  Enter Amphares  When last we met 'twas not a camp Amphares  That witness'd our embrace  AMPHARES  Oh no Cleombrotus  We met thou know'st beneath a festive dome  Whose echoes fed on music's sweetest sounds  Whilst sparkling beauty lent its powerful spells  To gild the hour and make its joys sublime  CLEOMBROTUS  Such hours yet wait us in the lap of peace  Leonidas I trust hath now resolv'd  To spare the bosom of his native city  Nor drain her veins to justify his crimes  AMPHARES  Secret his counsels prince nor do I know  Whether the gloomy tyrant waits your sword  Or means to yield your crown without compulsion  CLEOMBROTUS  Art thou not come th' ambassador of peace  AMPHARES  Oh no  CLEOMBROTUS  Ill founded hope  with anger  AMPHARES  Hadst  thou such hopes  CLEOMBROTUS  Or know this hour Amphares were not  his  To waste in insolent deliberation  But if not peace what cause  AMPHARES  I know thy question  Tho' on no  public  errand I approach you  Yet will you think the cause not less important  Than if an empire's fate hung on my breath  An empire did I say What then are empires  What all the mighty nothings which embroil  From age to age the sons of mad ambition  Compar'd to those soft int'rests of the heart  Which tho' in name less splendid have a power  That all the grander impulses must stoop to  CLEOMBROTUS  Then thou'rt ambassador from Chelonice  What says my most belov'd What fragrant message  Breath'd her sweet lips to him whose fate she rules  AMPHARES  No message bear I prince for unsolicited  Amphares comes and perhaps returns  unthank'd  CLEOMBROTUS  Forbid it courtesy what urged this visit  AMPHARES  Say rather what urg'd  thee  to sleep last night  Within thy camp whilst ev'ry Spartan citizen  Kept wakeful to salute thee once more king  CLEOMBROTUS  What but the powerful influence thou hast nam'd  My Chelonice  AMPHARES  Hah was she the destiny  Who snatch'd thy sceptre from thee  CLEOMBROTUS  Why  Amphares  This sudden flashing of thy eye this scorn  Her filial heart was agoniz'd it ask'd  Could I refuse She kneeling ask'd one day  For Sparta and her sire  AMPHARES  with contempt  For Sparta and  But I'll not add the name your eyes shall witness  For  whom  she knelt and ask'd you to withhold  Th' impending sword  CLEOMBROTUS  For whom for whom say'st  thou  AMPHARES  Why shou'd I speak Such tales are met ungraciously  Hard to excite belief of what to yield to  Is to embrace the keenest agonies  Fate hath prepar'd for man  CLEOMBROTUS  Heed me Amphares  The charge thou'dst lead to cannot be mistaken  I see thou'rt come to raise suspicion  here  Where yet suspicion never knew to live  But least to live when pointed at my wife  AMPHARES  Thus should it beThis is the magic philtre  Bestow'd by Hymen in the brieal cup  Which when once swallow'd makes a mana husband  sneeringly  CLEOMBROTUS  What is a husband  angrily  AMPHARES  What his wise shall please  Credulous doating disbelieving blind  CLEOMBROTUS  Were I of that quick temperament which flames  And blazes at a touch thou'st said enough  To raise a fire unquenchable in which  Thou its first victim should'st be sacrificed  Yet tho' my passions do but slowly mount  They're overbearing as the selfwill'd ocean  Which in its anger dashes at the sky  Beware  AMPHARES  I'm caution'dfrom regard not fear  CLEOMBROTUS  I know thou fear'st not nor can I suspect  Six yearly suns have belted round the world  Since Chelonice at the altar vow'd  The duties of connubial love to me  Her heart I've studied watch'd each turn of temper  Nor ever saw caprice inhabit there  Her virtues tho' chastis'd by female softness  Are of the grand and stubborn sort  Which selfcollected smile upon temptation  O shall the rooted confidence of ages  Break from its stem and be the sport of whispers  No Amphares the husband of Chelonice  Can have no fears but for his own demerits  AMPHARES  All then is well  CLEOMBROTUS  Not so for tho' no doubts  Can reach my heart that would dishonour her  To justify her fame I must know all  That malice dares suggest  AMPHARES  If to the grove  Which bounds the palace gardens and extends  Its loveinviting shades towards your camp  You'll bend your evening steps you'll there behold  Whom I forbear to nameThese ears imbib'd  The whisper'd assignation as unseen  I loiter'd nearThe impulse of the moment  Bade me convey to thee th' ingrateful secret  If I did wrong forgive me for the motive  CLEOMBROTUS  eagerly  AmpharesI'll be calmYet I'm not touch'd  Who is the villain tell me thatHis name  impetuously  AMPHARES  You'll know  CLEOMBROTUS  Trifle not By heaven it were more safe to tread  Upon the burnish'd adder than to halt  An instant on my rous'd suspicionTell me  AMPHARES  Thou know'st Cephisus on whose downy cheek  The halfblown blossom spreads its doubtful red  His tuneful voice seems the first notes of love  And his light form bespeaks a Sylvan god  Him wilt thou find  CLEOMBROTUS  Enough adieu Amphares  Think not I harbour doubts but I will prove  For Chelonice's sake I'll prove this night  Farewel escort this stranger to the walls  AMPHARES  Evening's first shades is the appointed period  This and the watch word Ceres let's you pass  giving a jewel  CLEOMBROTUS  I will be there  before  it's shades  AMPHARES  Farewel  Exit  CLEOMBROTUS  The air's too closeNow I can breathe again  His presence seem'd to oppress me and prevent  The act of respirationYet I'm not well  Can this be jealousysuspicion What  Of Chelonice Oh my beloved sooner  Could I suspect thatbut he heard the whisper  Whisper  who  whisper'd not my Chelonice  No ear but mine ere drank the 'witching murmurs  Of her chaste lips or if there hasOh Gods  The tortures of whole ages are comprised  In that one thought  If  there has  My brain seems splittingOh thou sooty night  Hasten thy ebon shades enwrap the world  In tenfold darkness not a glimm'ring star  Suffer to throw it's beams from thy thick mantle  That quick on my dishonour my revenge  May dart with light'ning's certainty and blast them  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV SCENE I  The Palace  Enter  Amphares  hastily followed by  Nicrates  AMPHARES  Suspicious brother  petulantly  NICRATES  True I  am  suspicious  Your hasty visit to Cleombrotus  Whom you  profess  to envy and to hate  Th' impatient steps with which you seek the king  That fiery thoughtfulness within your eye  Which ever indicates some foster'd evil  Give my suspicions lifeThus your eye roll'd  Whilst planning death for the immortal Agis  And such the brow you wore this early day  When by your arts possess'd the wretched king  Instead of blessings gave his daughter chains  AMPHARES  If thou believ'st that I have power and will  To crush to earth the beings who offend me  Why so licentious in reproof If Agis  Thron'd as he was within his people's hearts  Was from their bosoms dragg'd if Chelonice  Belov'd to dotage by her tyrant father  Seeks at my bidding patience in a prison  What fate waits thee Why urge the venom'd sting  Fatal to Agis and to Chelonice  NICRATES  Thy threat appals me not thy venom'd sting  May reach my heart but shall not shake my virtue  I've not been taught to fear to give reproof  For evil deeds though acted by a brother  And should'st thou dare to skreen thy guilty brows  Within the awful circle of a crown  Then  my reproofs shall glow with new found bitterness  And what the brother scorns shall pierce the  king  AMPHARES  Accept my caution and beware Thou speak'st  In words good brother Monarchs speak in  deeds  Leonidas approaches  He enters  LEONIDAS  Oh Amphares  Thy rapid steps were wing'd by my desires  So short the time they've ask'd Leave us Nicrates  Secrets of state demand this hour in privacy  Exit Nicrates  When expectation pants the form of  questions  Appears too cold to suit its ardors Speak  Amphares speak to my impatient thoughts  AMPHARES  Should all your hopes be met with the success  Which crown'd my embassy 'twould rank Leonidas  Most fortunate of kings  LEONIDAS  Is the wolf snared  AMPHARES  Not snared but rushing eager to the toils  LEONIDAS  Come to my heart Shall he escape the toils  AMPHARES  Yes as the dove escapes the eagle's pounce  When borne aloft she trembles in the clouds  LEONIDAS  What can reward thee But explain Amphares  Unfold the arts which triumph'd o'er his caution  AMPHARES  'Tis known Cleombrotus tho' bold as soldier  Bears all the lover's weakness in his heart  Doating t' excess on charming Chelonice  Excess of lovehow easy to make jealous  I talk'd of rivals nam'd the fated grove  As the dear spot where lawless cupids reign  And sing their wanton paeans to dishonour  LEONIDAS  eagerly  He will be there  AMPHARES  Yes with night's earliest shades  LEONIDAS  And thou wilt meet him there  AMPHARES  Is't your command  LEONIDAS  It is my earnest wish my ardent hope  Are these not srong enough to urge thy arm  Then think of thy reward'tis Chelonice  Her widow'd bed shall know no lord but thee  Son of my choice and partner of my throne  AMPHARES  Hear Jupiter bear witness to the vow  And now by Sparta's guardian god I swear  Not to behold thee 'till this loyal arm  Hath rooted from the earth the thorn which wounds thee  LEONIDAS  Oh time compress each intermediate hour  Into a point that I may leap at once  O'er the wide chasm of anxious expectation  Into the hour of triumph or despair  AMPHARES  Not hours but minutes form the dreaded chasm  The sun already hath his axle quench'd  Beneath the turb'lent flood and when he next  Shall spread his gorgeous mantle o'er the skies  Thy foes Leonidas he shall behold  Melt like the silver drops his ardent beam  Draws from the earth then dissipates in air  LEONIDAS  I rest me there farewell remember Chelonice  Exeunt  Scene changes to the Prison  CHELONICE  enters from the Flat The child asleep on a Pallet She goes to him  CHELONICE  Still press thy poppies on his humid brow  Sweet sleep Blest in thy arms nor prison walls  Nor chains nor parent's cruelty have power  To give one pang 'Tis to reflective minds  To sense  awaken'd  in the madd'ning soul  That misery appears in all its fulness  Celestial powers Ye know why we were call'd  From senseless nothing into conscious life  Ye know why ye bestow'd the nerve to agonize  The heart to rend and those contending passions  Which restlessly oppose and vex each other  What are those chains that bind my passive arms  Compared to those which hold my  mind  enslav'd  They say the mind is freemistaking casuists  Must it not mourn rejoice regret despair  E'en as our PASSIONS please those lordly passions  Who spite of vaunted reason hold the sceptre  And keep the obedient soul in close subjection  My sweet one wakes How now my lovely boy  Art thou refresh'd thy slumber has been long  CHILD  Would it were longer for I've had such dreams  Such pretty dreams that I am griev'd to wake  I thought dear mother that this gloomy place  Became a palace and those wicked chains  That make me cry to look at them dropt off  Oh let me tear them offWere I a man  I should be strong enough but now they mock me  CHELONICE  Regard them not my loveThe chains of gold  Upon the neck of power or those of steel  Upon the captive's arm are yet but chains  And neither mark the happiness within  NICRATES  without  Oppose me not admittance I must have  I'll answer't to the king  CHELONICE  Who then is this  That spite of opposition makes his visits  To the sad inmates of a dreary dungeon  NICRATES  entering  Oh Princess  CHELONICE  'Tis Nicrates generous youth  Why will you risk offence to speak your pity  Where pity's tend'rest drops must fall in vain  NICRATES  Alas 'tis not to  pity  that I come  Though thus to see you royal virtuous lady  Would force a sigh from bosoms  strange  to pity  I come to ask your counsel to inform you  Of things so dreadful that they will demand  All the tried firmness of your noble mind  To bear with calmness  CHELONICE  Hold forbear a moment  What may this evil bebreathe not a sound  Yetyes now I am firmSpeak then my friend  Whilst I lift up my heart to heaven for fortitude  NICRATES  Oh that in gentle terms and soft gradations  I might unfold the torturing tale But time  Too closely presses for this very hour  Unless the guardian genius of thy husband  Should grant to thee some sudden inspiration  By which to save himOh look not thus wildly  Your apprehensive mind perceives the ill  Command me how to act  CHELONICE  Where is my husband  Breathless  NICRATES  Advancing to the snare my brother's hand  Hath spread to catch himDeceiv'd into belief  That thou'rt unchaste and that the grove  CHELONICE  shrieks  The grove  I see it alloh murd'rous perseverance  These chainsI'll instant flytear off those chains  Have Ioh

cannot dare not  NICRATES  The attempt is fruitless  Their lives must answer should they let you pass  Judge then if this heartpiercing agony  Or all the eloquence inspired by grief  Can tempt their disobedience to the king  CHELONICE  Insensate stones burst from your cement ribs  Ye bars ye flints have ye no ears for grief  Oh for one little breach thro' which to force  This wretched

mind hath bow'd to  Remember this nor let my husband's heart  Too deeply feel the errors of my father  Oh come my son within our dismal cell  Prone on the earth we'll supplicate the Gods  The sacrifice must be heartrending groans  And for libationssurely from our eyes  Such sorrowing streams will flow that tho'  unhallow'd  The pitying heavens shall accept the waste  And scant our measure of encreasing woes  Exeunt  Scene changes to the Grove  Enter  CLEOMBROTUS  CLEOMBROTUS  Oh ye mild Zephyrs why so sweetly breathe  Why gently undulates the scented air  To such a tortured wretch ye should be hurricanes  These glades with agonizing fear I tread  Pursue their mazes with such pow'rful horror  As the mad priestess feels when to her soul  The Demon whispers forth unknown events  The day yet lingers but within these woods  Where eager night imprints her earliest steps  Adult'rous love should fearless seek it's mate  It may be slanderOh to be assured  The gewgaw crown of Sparta the dominion  Of the wide Universewhat sound is that  Again be faithful then my ear and guide me  Exit  Enter  AMPHARES  AMPHARES  These gloomy shades forestall the night and jealousy  E'er this hath

conscious day had kept ye trembling  CLEOMBROTUS  Well dost thou chide were thy dear chiding just  By Heaven the wretch who hath infring'd the oaths  Which bound the promise thou extorted'st from me  Shall by my sword be taught how I detest  So black a perfidyIt had ne'er been  Had not Amphares' arts seduced me hither  This moment in my camp I had impatient  Waited those terms of peace thou bid'st

rival here  The only rival thou canst ever dread  'Tis HONOUR and what she suggests my soul  Hath never dared debate on Her behests  Are not confined to rulesthey're sacred  impulses  The spirit of morality sublimed  Which if we stay to analize is lost  Exit  CHELONICE  Go then obey her impulse and chastise  My father here  Enter Leonidas speaking  LEONIDAS  Fly then and bid Demophilus  Lead his battalion quickly to the breach  I'll follow with my ownWho was it daughter  Abruptly parted hence as I appear'd  CHELONICE  My father  LEONIDAS  Nay why dost thou hesitate  Why not confess it was my mortal foe  'Twas he whose troops e'en at this living instant  Beset thy aged father'twas Cleombrotus  He whose keen sword is levell'd at  my  bosom  This instant left  my daughter's  CHELONICE  Harsh reproach  He knew not of th' attack his troops have made  And left me but to punish their rash leader  LEONIDAS  Dost thou believe him Oh thou easy one  His troops beset our walls without command  contemptuously  CHELONICE  So he in truth hath sworn  LEONIDAS  And what men swear  The fate of women binds them to believe  What wilt believe when thou shalt see him here  Staining those pillars with my blood  CHELONICE  Oh Heaven  LEONIDAS  How wilt thou greet my murd'rer  CHELONICE  As my foe  As him I'm bound to curse and then I'll join thee  Bleeding and breathless on thy funeral pile  LEONIDAS  Oh my dear child come once more to my arms  And hear me whilst I swear in this sad moment  Perhaps the last we e'er shall taste together  That the vast ruin which this hour marks out  The loss of empire liberty and life  Do not afflict my soul with half the anguish  Thy disobedience would bestow Thy love  Thy filial tenderness is the sole cordial  Of my declining days Cruel I've seem'd  Yet oh parental love hath ne'er one instant  Lost its sweet influence in this beating heart  CHELONICE  Oh how do I survive this moment  Is this our parting moment If it be  Bear witness to my oft repeated vow  Thy conqueror shall never be my husband  This bosom never shelter him whose sword  Shall pierce my father's Bless me nowoh bless me  A power unknown seems to bear down my mind  Heaven grant it be not madness  LEONIDAS  I do bless thee  My soul  my child doth bless theeNow retire  She goes he gazes after her  I'd fain indulge my eyes a little longer  Lest they should shortly shut her out for ever  What can this be which cruel thus unnerves me  Why loiter here all energies are lost  Where are the feelings of the king and soldier  A violent crashing and noise  That noise which speaks our wall's demolishing  And Sparta's ruin cannot rouse my blood  Oh age thou curse of nature in ill hour  Thou dost evince thy power  Enter  SARPEDON  and Citizens  SARPEDON  Joy great Leonidas

leader prone they fled  LEONIDAS  They  fled Oh had Cleombrotus but staid  The fortune of the hour had been complete  SARPEDON  Still are thy wishes prosperous Cleombrotus  Beheld Amphares and strait rush'd towards him  But instant was closed inwhen like the fork  The lightning darts which cleaves the stubborn rock  And nought resists so pierc'd his way Cleombrotus  And fled for shelter to Minerva's temple  LEONIDAS  Gods ye are just Astrea hath not fled  Back to her native heaven Mark'st thou Sarpedon  Scarcely ten fullorb'd moons have o'er our fields  Thrown their nocturnal brightness since myself  Driven by his faction fled for sanctuary  To that same temple which now shelters him  SARPEDON  I do remember't well  LEONIDAS  It makes my blood  Flow warm again within my veinsI thought  A moment since the curse of age  chill cowardice  Had seized upon my heart but now I find  It was despair pouring her torpid urn  Thro' every pulseBright hope hath chas'd her hence  I feel

Priest and others  HIGH PRIEST  Who knocks so loud claiming the sanctuary  Of our bright goddess  A PRIEST  entering  'Tis Cleombrotus  He who was late our prince now seeks a refuge  Beneath this

slaves I govern'd  And seeking refuge in your temple  HIGH PRIEST  Son  'Tis not to vulgar minds the gods decree  Such strong reversesWhen they form a soul  To taste and bear th' extremes of human fortune  'Tis form'd of fortitude of wisdom virtue  Adore those then who thus have form'd  thy  soul  Nor grudge tne  tasteless ease  bestow'd on men  Of lower faculties and meaner virtues  CLEOMBROTUS  Father I'm taught  ATTALUS  without  Make wayway for the king  CLEOMBROTUS  Hah my foe  HIGH PRIEST  Prince beneath this sacred roof  Foes lose their stings and enmity its scourge  Even

death  CHELONICE  His death my father Oh remember now  If I'd e'er power within thy soul remember  How on this sacred spot where now we stand  Successive days and nights beneath thy feet  I wept and watch'd and pour'd my soul in prayer  When hither thou wert driven by th' Ephori  Who made my husband kingI left his throne  I scorn'd his splendid diadem and here  For ever I had staid had not thy Fate  Again restor'd thee to thy royal feat  LEONIDAS  Oh my Chelonice know I not thy worth  Thy piety thy unexampled love  CHELONICE  If they are dear to thee grant this one boon  Spare me my husband's life  LEONIDAS  Impossible  CHELONICE  Receive me Goddess at thy shrine  For here forever I'll remain nor quit  So bless me Pallas as  Goes towards the altar  LEONIDAS  Cease thy rash vow  Without thee what is royalty thus then  I will reward thy longtried filial goodness  Accept thy husband's life but be he banish'd  Banish'd to th' utmost island in our realm  There guarded and immured

Banish'd from SpartaOff thou vile toy  throwing away the crown  My homeless friendless banish'd love I'm thine  I'll follow thee to desert lands or sundried meads  My arm shall pillow thee my bosom

the child and holding by her husband  CLEOMBROTUS  Thou matchless woman  LEONIDAS  Most ungrateful daughter  Wilt leave me then to solitary age  Abandon him who liv'd to cherish thee  CHELONICE  Not for whole worlds wert thou not king again  But how could I give joy to thee myself  A wretch My heart would still be cold and joyless  A wanderer within my father's palace  This is my homemy resting place and here  Will I forever dwell  Leaning on her husband's bosom  LEONIDAS  Go then thou ingrate  And with thee take thy father's curseMay he  For whom thou sacrific'st so much reward thee  With scorn neglect and hatred may he wring  Thy heart and thus revenge my bitter pangs  On thee who giv'st them  Exit  CHELONICE  Oh Cleombrotus  Canst thou be this Oh no I read thy soul  Through the soft dazzlingcircle of thy eye  It speaks immortal love  CLEOMBROTUS  Well hast thou read  And in that volume thou shalt read forever  Thy sparkling virtuesyes  they  will illume  These fading orbs though time should dim their beams  Or quench the brighter flames that live in thine  And when in some ambitious hour my soul  Sickens for sceptres and revolves on crowns  Th' alluring phantoms I will bid avaunt  And seek the dearer empire of thy heart  There I will reign in arbitrary pomp  And rule with all the tender tyranny of love  CHELONICE  Oh father hearest thou what a blest banishment  Thou hast decreed us Instant we'll begin  To taste those joys the marble colonades  Of regal domes were never known to house  Come my sweet boy thou wilt not learn in exile  The graceful arts of courts but thou shalt learn  The highest artthe art to emulate  The deeds of dignity the art to scorn  A vulgar act though cloath'd in ermin'd robes  Or sweeping the proud train of distant state  CHELONICE

CHELONICE  supports her father  CLEOMBROTUS  snatches the sword and meets  AMPHARES  CLEOMBROTUS  Stay behold a bosom  More meet than his t' arrest thy murd'rous sword  An arm more fit to give due chastisement  To vices black as thine  AMPHARES  Within  his  bosom  My sword already hath engrav'd revenge  And when from thine its quivering point hath drawn  The ruddy stream the crown of Lacedemon  Will glitter on the brow of scorn'd Amphares  They fight  AMPHARES  falls  CLEOMBROTUS  Thy brow must find its diadem in dust  Leonidas's sword urg'd by my arm  Hath work'd a double vengeanceThis alone  Could expiate thy crimes against the princess  The blood now rushing from thy heart  Obliterates the stains thy tongue imbued  AMPHARES  Oh had my erring swordbut 'tis too late  Thy fortune

rich rewardsoh may ye  Dies  CHELONICE  Th' unfinish'd blessing sinks upon his lips  But wafts his soul to heavenO awful hour  I have no more a father  Groans  Continues knceling behind the body and bending over it  CLEOMBROTUS  Cherish thy tears and be thy sorrows sacred  The voice of consolation now were gross  But SPARTANS bear ye witness to my life  Your glory and my Chelonice's bliss  Are the sole objects which shall hence engross it  Bear ye the bleeding body to the palace  And screen it from the insults of the croud  Who now will triumph with indecent joy  O'er him whose nod a moment since they worshipp'd  Ere I depart I'll sacrifice to heaven  And prostrate will adore th' invelop'd will  Which thus thro' darkness works our brightest days  And darts his glory o'er our thorny ways
