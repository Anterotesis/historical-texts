DAVIES in RusselStreet CoventGarden MDCCLXVI  Advertisement  HOGARTH's MARRIAGEALAMODE has before furnished Materials to the Author of a Novel published some Years ago under the Title of  The MarriageAct  But as that Writer persued a very different Story and as his Work was chiefly designed for a Political Satire very little Use could be made of it for the Service of this Comedy  In Justice to the Person who has been considered as the sole Author the Party who has hitherto lain concealed thinks it incumbent on him to declare that the Disclosure of his Name was by his own Desire reserved till the Publication of the Piece  Both the Authors however who have before been separately honoured with the indulgence of the Publick now beg Leave to make their joint Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception of the CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE  PROLOGUE  Written by Mr GARRICK  Spoken by Mr HOLLAND  POETS and Painters who from Nature draw  Their best and richest Stores have made this Law  That each should neighbourly assist his Brother  And steal with Decency from one another  Tonight your matchless Hogarth gives the Thought  Which from his Canvas to the Stage is brought  And who so fit to warm the Poet's Mind  As he who pictur'd Morals and Mankind  But not the same their Characters and Scenes  Both labour for one End by different Means  Each as it suits him takes a separate Road  Their one great Object MARRIAGEALAMODE  Where Titles deign with Cits to have and hold  And change rich Blood for more substantial Gold  And honour'd Trade from Interest turns aside  To hazard Happiness for titled Pride  The Painter dead yet still he charms the Eye  While England lives his Fame can never die  But he who  struts his Hour upon the Stage    Can scarce extend his Fame for Half an Age  Nor Pen nor Pencil can the Actor save  The Art and Artist share one common Grave  O let me drop one tributary Tear  On poor  Jack Falstaff  's Grave and  Juliet  's Bier  You to their Worth must Testimony give  'Tis in your Hearts alone their Fame can live  Still as the Scenes of Life will shift away  The strong Impressions of their Art decay  Your Children cannot feel what you have known  They'll boast of QUINS and CIBBERS of their own  The greatest Glory of our happy few  Is to be felt and be approv'd by YOU  Dramatis Personae  Lord  Ogleby  Mr KING  Sir  John Melvil  Mr

Betty  running in  MA'am Miss Fanny Ma'am  Fanny  What's the matter Betty  Betty  Oh la Ma'am as sure as I'm alive here is your husband  Fanny  Hush my dear Betty if any body in the house should hear you I am ruined  Betty  Mercy on me it has frighted me to such a degree that my heart is come up to my mouthBut as I was a saying Ma'am here's that dear sweet  Fanny  Have a care Betty  Betty  Lord I'm bewitched I thinkBut as I was a saying Ma'am here's Mr Lovewell just come from London  Fanny  Indeed  Betty  Yes indeed and indeed Ma'am he is I saw him crossing the courtyard in his boots  Fanny  I am glad to hear itBut pray now my dear Betty be cautious Don't mention that word  again on any account You know we have agreed never to drop any expressions of that sort for fear of an accident  Betty  Dear Ma'am you may depend upon me There is not a more trustier creature on the face of the earth than I am Though I say it I am as secret as the graveand if it's never told till I tell it it may remain untold till doom'sday for Betty  Fanny  I know you are faithfulbut in our circumstances we cannot be too careful  Betty  Very true Ma'amand yet I vow and protest there's more plague than pleasure with a secret especially if a body mayn't mention it to four or five of one's particular acquaintance  Fanny  Do but keep this secret a little while longer and then I hope you may mention it to any bodyMr Lovewell will acquaint the family with the nature of our situation as soon as possible  Betty  The sooner the better I believe for if he does not tell it there's a little telltale I know of will come and tell it for him  Fanny  Fie Betty  blushing  Betty  Ah you may well blushBut you're not so sick and so pale and so wan and so many qualms  Fanny  Have done I shall be quite angry with you  Betty  AngryBless the dear puppet I am sure I shall love it as much as if it was my ownI meant no harm heaven knows  Fanny  Wellsay no more of thisIt makes me uneasyAll I have to ask of you is to be faithful and secret and not to reveal this matter till we disclose it to the family ourselves  Betty  Me reveal itif I say a word I wish I may be burned I wou'd not do you any harm for the worldAnd as for Mr Lovewell I am sure I have loved the dear gentleman ever since he got a tidewaiter's place for my brotherBut let me tell you both you must leave off your soft looks to each  other and your whispers and your glances and your always sitting next to one another at dinner and your long walks together in the eveningFor my part if I had not been in the secret I shou'd have known you were a pair of loviers at least if not man and wife as  Fanny  See there now again Pray be careful  Betty  Wellwellnobody hears meMan and wifeI'll say so no morewhat I tell you is very true for all that  Lovewell  calling within  William  Betty  Hark I hear your husband  Fanny  What  Betty  I say here comes Mr LovewellMind the caution I give youI'll be whipped now if you are not the first person he sees or speaks to in the familyHowever if you chuse it it's nothing at all to meas you sow you must reapas you brew so you must bakeI'll e'en slip down the backstairs and leave you together  Exit  Fanny  alone  I see I see I shall never have a moment's ease till our marriage is made publick New distresses croud in upon me every day The sollicitude of my mind sinks my spirits preys upon my health and destroys every comfort of my life It shall be revealed let what will be the consequence  Enter  Lovewell  Lovew  My loveHow's thisIn tearsIndeed this is too much You promised me to support your spirits and to wait the determination of our fortune with patienceFor my sake for your own be comforted Why will you study to add to our uneasiness and perplexity  Fanny  Oh Mr Lovewell the indelicacy of a secret marriage grows every day more and more shocking to me I walk about the house like a guilty wretch I imagine myself the object of the suspicion  of the whole family and am under the perpetual terrors of a shameful detection  Lovew  Indeed indeed you are to blame The amiable delicacy of your temper and your quick sensibility only serve to make you unhappyTo clear up this affair properly to Mr Sterling is the continual employment of my thoughts Every thing now is in a fair train It begins to grow ripe for a discovery and I have no doubt of its concluding to the satisfaction of ourselves of your father and the whole family  Fanny  End how it will I am resolved it shall end soonvery soonI wou'd not live another week in this agony of mind to be mistress of the universe  Lovew  Do not be too violent neither Do not let us disturb the joy of your sister's marriage with the tumult this matter may occasionI have brought letters from Lord Ogleby and Sir John Melvil to Mr SterlingThey will be here this eveningand I dare say within this hour  Fanny  I am sorry for it  Lovew  Why so  Fanny  No matterOnly let us disclose our marriage immediately  Lovew  As soon as possible  Fanny  But directly  Lovew  In a few days you may depend on it  Fanny  Tonightor tomorrow morning  Lovew  That I fear will be impracticable  Fanny  Nay but you must  Lovew  Must why  Fanny  Indeed you mustI have the most alarming reasons for it  Lovew  Alarming indeed for they alarm me even before I am acquainted with themWhat are they  Fanny  I cannot tell you  Lovew  Not tell me  Fanny  Not at present When all is settled you shall be acquainted with every thing  Lovew  Sorry they are comingMust be discoveredWhat can this meanIs it possible you can have any reasons that need be concealed from me  Fanny  Do not disturb yourself with conjecturesbut rest assured that though you are unable to divine the cause the consequence of a discovery be it what it will cannot be attended with half the miseries of the present interval  Lovew  You put me upon the rackI wou'd do any thing to make you easyBut you know your father's temperMoney you will excuse my frankness is the spring of all his actions which nothing but the idea of acquiring nobility or magnificence can ever make him foregoand these he thinks his money will purchaseYou know too your aunt's Mrs Heidelberg's notions of the splendor of high life her contempt for every thing that does not relish of what she calls Quality and that from the vast fortune in her hands by her late husband she absolutely governs Mr Sterling and the whole family now if they should come to the knowledge of this affair too abruptly they might perhaps be incensed beyond all hopes of reconciliation  Fanny  But if they are made acquainted with it otherwise than by ourselves it will be ten times worse and a discovery grows every day more probable The whole family have long suspected our affection We are also in the power of a foolish maidservant and if we may even depend on her fidelity we cannot answer for her discretionDiscover it therefore immediately lest some accident should bring it to light and involve us in additional disgrace  Lovew  WellwellI meant to discover it soon but would not do it too precipitatelyI have more than once sounded Mr Sterling about it and will attempt him more seriously the next opportunity But my principal hopes are theseMy relationship  to Lord Ogleby and his having placed me with your father have been you know the first links in the chain of this connection between the two families in consequence of which I am at present in high favour with all parties while they all remain thus wellaffected to me I propose to lay our case before the old Lord and if I can prevail on him to mediate in this affair I make no doubt but he will be able to appease your father and being a lord and a man of quality I am sure he may bring Mrs Heidelberg into goodhumour at any timeLet me beg you therefore to have but a little patience as you see we are upon the very eve of a discovery that must probably be to our advantage  Fanny  Manage it your own way I am persuaded  Lovew  But in the mean time make yourself easy  Fanny  As easy as I can I willWe had better not remain together any longer at presentThink of this business and let me know how you proceed  Lovew  Depend on my care But pray be chearful  Fanny  I will  As she is going out Enter  Sterling  Sterl  Heyday who have we got here  Fanny  confused  Mr Lovewell Sir  Sterl  And where are you going hussey  Fanny  To my sister's chamber Sir  Exit  Sterl  Ah Lovewell What always getting my foolish girl yonder into a cornerWellwelllet us but once see her elder sister fastmarried to Sir John Melvil we'll soon provide a good husband for Fanny I warrant you  Lovew  Wou'd to heaven Sir you would provide her one of my recommendation  Sterl  Yourself eh Lovewell  Lovew  With your pleasure Sir  Sterl  Mighty well  Lovew  And I flatter myself that such a proposal would not be very disagreeable to Miss Fanny  Sterl  Better and better  Lovew  And if I could but obtain your consent Sir  Sterl  What you marry Fannynonothat will never do LovewellYou're a good boy to be sureI have a great value for youbut can't think of you for a soninlawThere's no  Stuff  in the case no money Lovewell  Lovew  My pretensions to fortune indeed are but moderate but though not equal to splendor sufficient to keep us above distressAdd to which that I hope by diligence to increase itand have love honour  Sterl  But not the  Stuff  LovewellAdd one little round o to the sum total of your fortune and that will be the finest thing you can say to meYou know I've a regard for youwould do any thing to serve youany thing on the footing of friendshipbut  Lovew  If you think me worthy of your friendship Sir be assured that there is no instance in which I should rate your friendship so highly  Sterl  Psha psha that's another thing you knowWhere money or interest is concerned friendship is quite out of the question  Lovew  But where the happiness of a daughter is at stake you wou'd not scruple sure to sacrifice a little to her inclinations  Sterl  Inclinations why you wou'd not persuade me that the girl is in love with youeh Lovewell  Lovew  I cannot absolutely answer for Miss Fanny Sir but am sure that the chief happiness or misery of my life depends entirely upon her  Sterl  Why indeed now if your kinsman Lord Ogleby would come down handsomely for youbut that's impossibleNo no'twill never doI  must hear no more of thisCome Lovewell promise me that I shall hear no more of this  Lovew  hesitating  I am afraid Sir I shou'd not be able to keep my word with you if I did promise you  Sterl  Why you wou'd not offer to marry her without my consent wou'd you Lovewell  Lovew  Marry her Sir  confused  Sterl  Ay marry her SirI know very well that a warm speech or two from such a dangerous young spark as you are will go much farther towards persuading a silly girl to do what she has more than a month's mind to do than twenty grave lectures from fathers or mothers or uncles or aunts to prevent herBut you wou'd not sure be such a base fellow such a treacherous young rogue as to seduce my daughter's affections and destroy the peace of my family in that mannerI must insist on it that you give me your word not to marry her without my consent  Lovew  SirIIas to thatIII beg SirPray Sir excuse me on this subject at present  Sterl  Promise then that you will carry this matter no further without my approbation  Lovew  You may depend on it Sir that it shall go no further  Sterl  Wellwellthat's enoughI'll take care of the rest I warrant youCome come let's have done with this nonsenseWhat's doing in townAny news upon 'Change  Lovew  Nothing material  Sterl  Have you seen the currants the soap and Madeira safe in the warehouses Have you compared the goods with the invoice and bills of lading and are they

John Melvil When are we to expect them  Lovew  Very soon Sir I came on purpose to bring you their commands Here are letters from both of them  Sterl  Let me seelet me see'Slife how his Lordship's letter is perfumedIt takes my breath away  opening it  And French paper too with a fine border of flowers and flourishesand a slippery gloss on it that dazzles one's eyes  My dear Mr Sterling

that's the stuff that makes the great man in this country  Lovew  Very true Sir  Sterl  True SirWhy then have done with your nonsense of love and matrimony You're not rich enough to think of a wife

respectable character in the universe 'Slife man a rich English merchant may make himself a  match for the daughter of a NabobWhere are all my rascals Here William  Exit calling  Lovewell  alone  SoAs I suspectedQuite averse to the match and likely to receive the news of it with great displeasureWhat's best to be doneLet me seeSuppose I get Sir John Melvil to interest himself in this affair He may mention it to Lord Ogleby with a better grace than I can and more probably prevail on him to interfere in it I can open my mind also more freely to Sir John He told me when I left him in town that he had something of consequence to communicate and that I could be of use to him I am glad of it for the confidence he reposes in me and the service I may do him will ensure me his good officesPoor Fanny It hurts me to see her so uneasy and her making a mystery of the cause adds to my anxietySomething must be done upon her account for at all events her sollicitude shall be removed  Exit  Scene changes

 Miss Sterl  Oh it gives me no manner of uneasiness But indeed Ma'am I cannot be persuaded but that Sir John is an extremely cold lover Such distant civility grave looks and lukewarm professions of esteem for me and the whole family I have heard of flames and darts but Sir John's is a passion of mere ice and snow  Mrs Heidel  Oh fie my dear I am perfectly ashamed of you That's so like the notions of your poor sister What you complain of as coldness and indiffarence is nothing but the extreme gentilaty of his address an exact pictur of the manners of qualaty  Miss Sterl  Oh he is the very mirror of complaisance full of formal bows and set speechesI declare if there was any violent passion on my side I should be quite jealous of him  Mrs Heidel  I say jealus indeedJealus of who pray  Miss Sterl  My sister Fanny She seems a much greater favourite than I am and he pays her infinitely more attention I assure you  Mrs Heidel  Lord d'ye think a man of fashion as he is can't distinguish between the genteel and the wulgar part of the famalyBetween you and your sister for instanceor me and my brotherBe advised by me child It is all politeness and goodbreedingNobody knows the qualaty better than I do  Miss Sterl  In my mind the old lord his uncle has ten times more gallantry about him than Sir John He is full of attentions to the ladies and  smiles and grins and leers and ogles and fills every wrinkle in his old wizen face with comical expressions of tenderness I think he wou'd make an admirable sweetheart  Enter  Sterling  Sterl  at entring  No fishWhy the pond was dragged but yesterday morningThere's carp and tench in the boatPox on't if that dog Lovewell had any thought he wou'd have brought down a turbot or some of the landcarriage mackarel  Mrs Heidel

smart lively girl full of mirth and sprightliness  Sir John  All mischief and malice I doubt  Lovew  How  Sir John  But her personwhat d'ye think of that  Lovew  Pretty and agreeable  Sir John  A little grisette thing  Lovew  What is the meaning of all this  Sir John  I'll tell you You must know Lovewell that notwithstanding all appearances  seeing Lord  Ogleby  c  We are interruptedWhen they

flying Mercury and the basin with Neptune in the middle are all in the very extreme of fine taste You have as many rich figures as the man at HydePark Corner  Sterl  The chief pleasure of a country house is to make improvements you know my Lord I spare no expence not IThis is quite anotherguess sort of a place than it was when I first took it my Lord We were surrounded with trees I cut down above fifty to make the lawn before the house and let in the wind and the sunsmacksmoothas you seeThen I made a greenhouse out of the old laundry  and turned the brew house into a pineryThe high octagon summerhouse you see yonder is raised on the mast of a ship given me by an EastIndia captain who has turned many a thousand of my money It commands the whole road All the coaches and chariots and chaises pass and repass under your eye I'll mount you up there in the afternoon my Lord 'Tis the pleasantest place in the world to take a pipe and a bottleand so you shall say my Lord  Lord Ogle  Ayor a bowl of punch or a can of flip Mr Sterling for it looks like a cabin in the airIf flying chairs were in use the captain might make a voyage to the Indies in it still if he had but a fair wind  Canton  Ha ha ha ha  Mrs Heidel  My brother's a little comacal in his ideas my LordBut you'll excuse himI have a little gothick dairy fitted up entirely in my own tasteIn the evening I shall hope for the honour of your Lordship's company to take a dish of tea there or a sullabub warm from the cow  Lord Ogle  I have every moment a fresh opportunity of admiring the elegance of Mrs Heidelbergthe very flower of delicacy and cream of politeness  Mrs Heidel  O my Lord  leering at each other  Lord Ogle  O Madam  Sterl  How d'ye like these close walks my Lord  Lord Ogle  A most excellent serpentine It

worm my Lord  Lord Ogle  Admirably laid out indeed Mr Stering one can hardly see an inch beyond one's nose any where in these walksYou are a most excellent oeconomist of your land and make a little go a great wayIt lies together in as small parcels as if it was  placed in pots out at your window in GracechurchStreet  Canton  Ha ha ha ha  Lord Ogle  What d'ye laugh at Canton  Canton  Ah que cette similitude est drole So clever what you say mi Lor  Lord Ogle  to Fanny  You seem mightily engaged Madam What are those pretty hands so busily employed about  Fanny  Only making up a nosegay my LordWill your Lordship do me the honour of accepting it  presenting it  Lord Ogle  I'll wear it next my heart MadamI see the young creature doats on me  apart  Miss Sterl  Lord sister you've loaded

sweetbriar  Lord Ogle  The truest emblems of yourself Madam all sweetness and poignancyA little jealous poor soul  apart  Sterl  Now my Lord if you please I'll carry you to see my Ruins  Mrs Heidel  You'll absolutely fatigue his Lordship with overwalking brother  Lord Ogle  Not at all Madam We're in the garden of Eden you know in the region of perpetual spring youth and beauty  leering at the women  Mrs Heidel  Quite the man of qualaty I pertest  apart  Canton  Take a my arm mi Lor  Lord  Ogleby  leans on him  Sterl  I'll only shew his Lordship my ruins and the cascade and the Chinese bridge and then we'll go in to breakfast  Lord Ogle  Ruins did you say Mr Sterling  Sterl  Ay ruins my Lord and they are reckoned very fine ones too You would think them ready to  tumble on your head It has just cost me a hundred and fifty pounds to put my ruins in thorough repairThis way if your Lordship pleases  Lord Ogle  going stops  What steeple's that we see yonder the parishchurch I suppose  Sterl  Ha ha ha that's admirable It is no church at all my Lord it is a spire that I have built against a tree a field or two off to terminate the prospect One must always have a church or an obelisk or a something to terminate the prospect you know That's a rule in taste my Lord  Lord Ogle  Very ingenious indeed For my part I desire no finer prospect than this I see before me  leering at the women  Simple yet varied bounded yet extensiveGet away Canton  pushing away  Canton    I want no assistanceI'll walk with the ladies  Sterl  This way my Lord  Lord Ogle  Lead on SirWe young folks here will follow youMadamMiss SterlingMiss Fanny I attend you  Exit after  Sterling  gallanting the ladies  Canton  following  He is cock o'de game ma foy  Exit  Manet Sir  John Melvil  and  Lovewell  Sir John  At length thank heaven I have an opportunity to unbosomI know you are faithful Lovewell and flatter myself you would rejoice to serve me  Lovew  Be assured you may depend on me  Sir John  You must know then notwithstanding all appearances that this treaty of marriage between Miss Sterling and me will come to nothing  Lovew  How  Sir John  It will be no match Lovewell  Lovew  No match  Sir John  No  Lovew  You amaze me What should prevent it  Sir John  I  Lovew  You wherefore  Sir John  I don't like her  Lovew  Very plain indeed I never supposed that you was extremely devoted to her from inclination but thought you always considered it as a matter of convenience rather than affection  Sir John  Very true I came into the family without any impressions on my mindwith an unimpassioned indifference ready to receive one woman as soon as another I looked upon love serious sober love as a chimaera and marriage as a thing of course as you know most people do But I who was lately so great an infidel in love am now one of its sincerest votariesIn short my defection from Miss Sterling proceeds from the violence of my attachment to another  Lovew  Another So so here will be fine work And pray who is she  Sir John  Who is she who can she be but Fanny the tender amiable engaging Fanny  Lovew  Fanny What Fanny  Sir John  Fanny Sterling Her sisterIs not she an angel Lovewell  Lovew  Her sister ConfusionYou must not think of it Sir John  Sir John  Not think of it I can think of nothing else Nay tell me Lovewell was it possible for me to be indulged in a perpetual intercourse with two such objects as Fanny and her sister and not find my heart led by insensible attraction towards HerYou seem confoundedWhy don't you answer me  Lovew  Indeed Sir John this event gives me infinite concern  Sir John  Why soIs not she an angel Lovewell  Lovew  I foresee that it must produce the worst consequences Consider the confusion it must unavoidably create Let me persuade you to drop these thoughts in time  Sir John  Nevernever Lovewell  Lovew  You have gone too far to recede A negotiation so nearly concluded cannot be broken off with any grace The lawyers you know are hourly expected the preliminaries almost finally settled between Lord Ogleby and Mr Sterling and Miss Sterling herself ready to receive you as a husband  Sir John  Why the banns have been published and nobody has forbidden them 'tis true But you know either of the parties may change their minds even after they enter the church  Lovew  You think too lightly of this matter To carry your addresses so farand then to desert herand for her sister tooIt will be such an affront to the family that they can never put up with it  Sir John  I don't think so for as to my transferring my passion from her to her sister so much the better‚ñ™for then you know I don't carry my affections out of the family  Lovew  Nay but prithee be serious and think better of it  Sir John  I have thought better of it already you see Tell me honestly Lovewell Can you blame me Is there any comparison between them  Lovew  As to that nowwhy thatthat is justjust as it may strike different people There are many admirers of Miss Sterling's vivacity  Sir John  Vivacity a medley of Cheapside pertness and Whitechapel prideNonoif I do go so far into the city for a weddingdinner it shall be upon turtle at least  Lovew  But I see no probability of success for granting that Mr Sterling wou'd have consented to it at first he cannot listen to it now Why did not you break this affair to the family before  Sir John  Under such embarrassed circumstances as I have been can you wonder at my irresolution or perplexity Nothing but despair the fear of losing my dear Fanny cou'd bring me to a declaration  even now and yet I think I know Mr Sterling so well that strange as my proposal may appear if I can make it advantageous to him as a moneytransaction as I am sure I can he will certainly come into it  Lovew  But even suppose he should which I very much doubt I don't think Fanny herself wou'd listen to your addresses  Sir John  You are deceived a little in that particular  Lovew  You'll find I am in the right  Sir John  I have some little reason to think otherwise  Lovew  You have not declared your passion to her already  Sir John  Yes I have  Lovew  IndeedAndandand how did she receive it  Sir John  I think it is not very easy for me to make my addresses to any woman without receiving some little encouragement  Lovew  Encouragement did she give you any encouragement  Sir John  I don't know what you call encouragementbut she blushedand criedand desired me not to think of it any moreupon which I prest her handkissed itswore she was an angeland I cou'd see it tickled her to the soul  Lovew  And did she express no surprise at your declaration  Sir John  Why faith to say the truth she was a little surprisedand she got away from me too before I cou'd thoroughly explain myself If I should not meet with an opportunity of speaking to her I must get you to deliver a letter from me  Lovew  Ia letterI had rather have nothing  Sir John  Nay you promised me your assistanceand I am sure you cannot scruple to make yourself useful on such an occasionYou may without suspicion  acquaint her verbally of my determined affection for her and that I am resolved to ask her father's consent  Lovew  As to that Iyour commands you knowthat is if sheIndeed Sir John I think you are in the wrong  Sir John  Wellwellthat's my concernHa there she goes by heaven along that walk yonder d'ye see I'll go to her immediately  Lovew  You are too precipitate Consider what you are doing  Sir John  I wou'd not lose this opportunity for the universe  Lovew  Nay pray don't go Your violence and eagerness may overcome her spiritsThe shock will be too much for her  detaining him  Sir John  Nothing shall prevent meHa now she turns into another walkLet me go  breaks from him  I shall lose her  going turns back  Be sure now to keep out of the way If you interrupt us I shall never forgive you  Exit hastily  Lovewell  alone  'Sdeath I can't bear this In love with my wife acquaint me with his passion for her make his addresses before my faceI shall break out before my timeThis was the meaning of Fanny's uneasiness She could not encourage himI am sure she could notHa they are turning into the walk and coming this way Shall I leave the placeLeave him to sollicit my wife I can't submit to itThey come nearer and nearerIf I stay it will look suspiciousIt may betray us and incense himThey are hereI must goI am the most unfortunate fellow in the world  Exit  Enter  Fanny  and Sir  John  Fanny  Leave me Sir John I beseech you leave menay why will you persist to follow me with  idle sollicitations which are an affront to my character and an injury to your own honour  Sir John  I know your delicacy and tremble to offend it but let the urgency of the occasion be my excuse Consider Madam that the future happiness of my life depends on my present application to you consider that this day must determine my fate and these are perhaps the only moments left me to incline you to warrant my passion and to intreat you not to oppose the proposals I mean to open to your father  Fanny  For shame for shame Sir John Think of your previous engagements Think of your own situation and think of mineWhat have you discovered in my conduct that might encourage you to so bold a declaration I am shocked that you should venture to say so much and blush that I should even dare to give it a hearingLet me be gone  Sir John  Nay stay Madam but one momentYour sensibility is too greatEngagements what engagements have even been pretended on either side than those of familyconvenience I went on in the trammels of matrimonial negotiation with a blind submission to your father and Lord Ogleby but my heart soon claimed a right to be consulted It has devoted itself to you and obliges me to plead earnestly for the same tender interest in your's  Fanny  Have a care Sir John do not mistake a depraved will for a virtuous inclination By these common pretences of the heart half of our sex are made fools and a greater part of yours despise them for it  Sir John  Affection you will allow is involuntary We cannot always direct it to the object on which it should fixBut when it is once inviolably attached inviolably as mine is to you it often creates reciprocal affectionWhen I last urged you on this subject you heard me with more temper and I hoped with some compassion  Fanny  You deceived yourself If I forbore to exert a proper spirit nay if I did not even express the quickest resentment of your behaviour it was only in consideration of that respect I wish to pay you in honour to my sister and be assured Sir woman as I am that my vanity could reap no pleasure from a triumph that must result from the blackest treachery to her  going  Sir John  One word and I have done  stopping her  Your impatience and anxiety and the urgency of the occasion oblige me to be brief and explicit with youI appeal therefore from your delicacy to your justiceYour sister I verily believe neither entertains any real affection for me or tenderness for youYour father I am inclined to think is not much concerned by means of which of his daughters the families are unitedNow as they cannot shall not be connected otherwise than by my union with you why will you from a false delicacy oppose a measure so conducive to my happiness and I hope your ownI love you most passionately and sincerely love youand hope to propose terms agreeable to Mr SterlingIf then you don't absolutely loath abhor and scorn meif there is no other happier man  Fanny  Hear me Sir hear my final determinationWere my father and sister as insensible as you are pleased to represent themwere my heart for ever to remain disengaged to any otherI could not listen to your proposalsWhat You on the very eve of a marriage with my sister I living under the same roof with her bound not only by the laws of friendship and hospitality but even the ties of blood to contribute to her happinessand not to conspire against her peacethe peace of a whole familyand that my own tooAway away Sir JohnAt such a time and in such circumstances your addresses only inspire me with horrorNay you must detain me no longerI will go  Sir John  Do not leave me in absolute despairGive me a glimpse of hope  falling on his knees  Fanny  I cannot Pray Sir John  struggling to go  Sir John  Shall this hand be given to another  kissing her hand  NoI cannot endure itMy whole soul is yours and the whole happiness of my life is in your power  Enter Miss  Sterling  Fanny  Ha my sister is here Rise for shame Sir John  Sir John  Miss Sterling  rising  Miss Sterl  I beg pardon SirYou'll excuse me MadamI have broke in upon you a little unopportunely I believeBut I did not mean to interrupt youI only came Sir to let you know that breakfast waits if you have finished your morning's devotions  Sir John  I am very sensible Miss Sterling that this may appear particular but  Miss Sterl  Oh dear Sir John don't put yourself to the trouble of an apology The thing explains itself  Sir John  It will soon MadamIn the mean time I can only assure you of my profound respect and esteem for you and make no doubt of convincing Mr Sterling of the honour and integrity of my intentions Andandyour humble servant Madam  Exit in confusion  Manent  Fanny  and Miss  Sterling  Miss Sterl  RespectInsolenceEsteemVery fine trulyAnd you Madam my sweet delicate innocent sentimental sister will you convince my papa too of the integrity of your intentions  Fanny  Do not upbraid me my dear sister Indeed I don't deserve it Believe me you can't be more offended at his behaviour than I am and I am sure it cannot make you half so miserable  Miss Sterl  Make me miserable You are mightily deceived Madam It gives me no sort of uneasiness I assure youA base fellowAs for you Miss the pretended softness of your disposition your artful goodnature never imposed upon me I always knew you to be fly and envious and deceitful  Fanny  Indeed you wrong me  Miss Sterl  Oh you are all goodness to be sureDid not I find him on his knees before you Did not I see him kiss your sweet hand Did not I hear his protestations Was not I witness of your dissembled modestyNono my dear don't imagine that you can make a fool of your elder sister so easily  Fanny  Sir John I own is to blame but I am above the thoughts of doing you the least injury  Miss Sterl  We shall try that MadamI hope Miss you'll be able to give a better account to my papa and my auntfor they shall both know of this matter I promise you  Exit  Fanny  alone  How unhappy I am my distresses multiply upon meMr Lovewell must now become acquainted with Sir John's behaviour to meand in a manner that may add to his uneasinessMy father instead of being disposed by fortunate circumstances to forgive any transgression will be previously incensed against meMy sister and my aunt will become irreconcilably my enemies and rejoice in my disgraceYet at all events I am determined on a discovery I

cleared off immediately on the payment of the first part of Miss Sterling's portionYou agree on your part to come down with l  Sterl  Down on the nailAy ay my money is ready tomorrow if he pleaseshe

of us substantial fellowseh Mr Serjeant  Flower  Sir John having last term according to agreement levied a fine and suffered a recovery has thereby cut off the entail of the Ogleby estate for the better effecting the purposes of the present intended marriage on which abovementioned Ogleby estate a jointure of l per ann is secured to your eldest daughter now Elizabeth Sterling spinster and the whole estate after the death of the aforesaid Earl descends to the heirs male of Sir John Melvil on the body of the aforesaid Elizabeth Sterling lawfully to be begotten  Traverse  Very trueand Sir John is to be put in immediate possession of as much of his Lordship's Somersetshire estate as lies in the manors of Hogmore and Cranford amounting to between two and three thousands per ann and at the death of Mr Sterling a further sum of seventy thousand  Enter Sir  John Melvil  Sterl  Ah Sir John Here we arehard at itpaving the road to matrimonyFirst the lawyers then comes the doctorLet us but dispatch the longrobe we shall soon set Puddingsleeves to work I warrant you  Sir John  I am sorry to interrupt you Sirbut I hope that both you and these gentlemen will excuse mehaving something very particular for your private ear I took the liberty of following you and  beg you will oblige me with an audience immediately  Sterl  Ay with all my heartGentlemen Mr Serjeant you'll excuse itBusiness must be done you knowThe writings will keep cold till tomorrow morning  Flower  I must be at Warwick Mr Sterling the day after  Sterl  Nay nay I shan't part with you tonight gentlemen I promise youMy house is very full but I have beds for you all beds for your servants and stabling for all your horsesWill you take a turn in the garden and view some of my improvements before dinner Or will you amuse yourselves on the green with a game of bowls and a cool tankardMy servants shall attend youDo you chuse any other refreshmentCall for what you pleasedo as you pleasemake yourselves quite at home I beg of youHereThomas Harry William wait on these Gentlemen  follows the lawyers out bawling and talking and then returns to Sir John  And now Sir I am entirely at your serviceWhat are your commands with me Sir John  Sir John  After having carried the negotiation between our families to so great a length after having assented so readily to all your proposals as well as received so many instances of your chearful compliance with the demands made on our part I am extremely concerned Mr Sterling to be the involuntary cause of any uneasiness  Sterl  Uneasiness what uneasinessWhere business is transacted as it ought to be and the parties understand one another there can be no uneasiness You agree on such and such conditions to receive my daughter for a wife on the same conditions I agree to receive you as a soninlaw and as to all the rest it follows of course you know as regularly as the payment of a bill after acceptance  Sir John  Pardon me Sir more uneasiness has arisen than you are aware of I am myself at this instant in a state of inexpressible embarrassment Miss Sterling I know is extremely disconcerted too and unless you will oblige me with the assistance of your friendship I foresee the speedy progress of discontent and animosity through the whole family  Sterl  What the deuce is all this I don't understand a single syllable  Sir John  In one word thenit will be absolutely impossible for me to fulfill my engagements in regard to Miss Sterling  Sterl  How Sir John Do you mean to put an affront upon my family What refuse to  Sir John  Be assured Sir that I neither mean to affront nor forsake your familyMy only fear is that you should desert me for the whole happiness of my life depends on my being connected with your family by the nearest and tenderest ties in the world  Sterl  Why did not you tell me but a moment ago that it was absolutely impossible for you to marry my daughter  Sir John  TrueBut you have another daughter Sir  Sterl  Well  Sir John  Who has obtained the most absolute dominion over my heart I have already declared my passion to her nay Miss Sterling herself is also apprized of it and if you will but give a sanction to my present addresses the uncommon merit of Miss Sterling will no doubt recommend her to a person of equal if not superior rank to myself and our families may still be allied by my union with Miss Fanny  Sterl  Mighty fine truly Why what the plague do you make of us Sir John Do you come to market for my daughters like servants at a statutefair Do you think that I will suffer you or any man in the world to come into my house like the  Grand Signior and throw the handkerchief first to one and then to t'other just as he pleases Do you think I drive a kind of African slavetrade with them and  Sir John  A moment's patience Sir Nothing but the excess of my passion for Miss Fanny shou'd have induced me to take any step that had the least appearance of disrespect to any part of your family and even now I am desirous to atone for my transgression by making the most adequate compensation that lies in my power  Sterl  Compensation what compensation can you possibly make in such a case as this Sir John  Sir John  Come come Mr Sterling I know you to be a man of sense a man of business a man of the world I'll deal frankly with you and you shall see that I do not desire a change of measures for my own gratification without endeavouring to make it advantageous to you  Sterl  What advantage can your inconstancy be to me Sir John  Sir John  I'll tell you SirYou know that by the articles at present subsisting between us on the day of my marriage with Miss Sterling you agree to pay down the gross sum of eighty thousand pounds  Sterl  Well  Sir John  Now if you will but consent to my waving that marriage  Sterl  I agree to your waving that marriage Impossible Sir John  Sir John  I hope not Sir as on my part I will agree to wave my right to thirty thousand pounds of the fortune I was to receive with her  Sterl  Thirty thousand d'ye say  Sir John  Yes Sir and accept of Miss Fanny with fifty thousand instead of fourscore  Sterl  Fifty thousand  pausing  Sir John  Instead of fourscore  Sterl  Whywhythere may be something in thatLet me see Fanny with fifty thousand instead of Betsey with fourscoreBut how can this be Sir JohnFor you know I am to pay this money into the hands of my Lord Ogleby who I believebetween you and me Sir Johnis not overstocked with ready money at present and threescore thousand of it you know is to go to pay off the present incumbrances on the estate Sir John  Sir John  That objection is easily obviatedTen of the twenty thousand which would remain as a surplus of the fourscore after paying off the mortgage was intended by his Lordship for my use that we might set off with some little  eclat  on our marriage and the other ten for his ownTen thousand pounds therefore I shall be able to pay you immediately and for the remaining twenty thousand you shall have a mortgage on that part of the estate which is to be made over to me with whatever security you shall require for the regular payment of the interest 'till the principal is duly discharged  Sterl  Whyto do you justice Sir John there is something fair and open in your proposal and since I find you do not mean to put an affront upon the family  Sir John  Nothing was ever farther from my thoughts Mr SterlingAnd after all the whole affair is nothing extraordinarysuch things happen every dayand as the world has only heard generally of a treaty between the families when this marriage takes place nobody will be the wiser if we have but discretion enough to keep our own counsel  Sterl  True true and since you only transfer from one girl to the other it is no more than transferring so much stock you know  Sir John  The very thing  Sterl  Odso I had quite forgot We are reckoning without our host here There is another difficulty  Sir John  You alarm me What can that be  Sterl  I can't stir a step in this business without consulting my sister HeidelbergThe family has very great expectations from her and we must not give her any offence  Sir John  But if you come into this measure surely she will be so kind as to consent  Sterl  I don't know thatBetsey is her darling and I can't tell how far she may resent any slight that seems to be offered to her favourite nieceHowever I'll do the best I can for youYou shall go and break the matter to her first and by that time that I may suppose that your rhetorick has prevailed on her to listen to reason I will step in to reinforce your arguments  Sir John  I'll fly to her immediately you promise me your assistance  Sterl  I do  Sir John  Ten thousand thanks for it and now success attend me  going  Sterl  Harkee Sir John  Sir  John  returns  Sterl  Not a word of the thirty thousand to my sister Sir John  Sir John  Oh I am dumb I am dumb Sir  going  Sterl  You remember it is thirty thousand  Sir John  To be sure I do  Sterl  But Sir Johnone thing more  Sir  John  returns  My Lord must know nothing of this stroke of friendship between us  Sir John  Not for the worldLet me alone let me alone  offering to go  Sterl  holding him  And when every thing is agreed we must give each other a bond to be held fast to the bargain  Sir John  To be sure A bond by all means a bond or whatever you please  Exit hastily  Sterling  alone  I should have thought of more conditionshe's in a humour to give me every thingWhy what mere children are your fellows of quality that cry for a plaything one minute and throw it by the next as changeable as the weather and as uncertain as the stocksSpecial fellows to drive a bargain and yet they are to take care of the interest of the nation trulyHere does this whirligig man of fashion offer to give up thirty thousand pounds in hard money with as much indifference as if it was a china orangeBy this mortgage I shall have a hold on his  Terrafirma  and if he wants more money as he certainly willlet him have children by my daughter or no I shall have his whole estate in a net for the benefit of my familyWell thus it is that the children of citizens who have acquired fortunes prove persons of fashion and thus it is that persons of fashion who have ruined their fortunes reduce the next generation to cits  Exit  SCENE changes to another apartment  Enter Mrs  Heidelberg  and Miss  Sterling  Miss Sterl  This is your gentlelooking softspeaking sweetsmiling affable Miss Fanny for you  Mrs Heidel  My Miss Fanny I disclaim her With all her arts she never could insinuat herself into my good gracesand yet she has a way with her that deceives man woman and child except you and me niece  Miss Sterl  O ay she wants nothing but a crook in her hand and a lamb under her arm to be a perfect picture of innocence and simplicity  Mrs Heidel  Just as I was drawn at Amsterdam when I went over to visit my husband's relations  Miss Sterl  And then she's so mighty good to servants  pray John do thispray Tom do thatthank  you Jenny  and then so humble to her relationsto  be sure Papaas my Aunt pleasesmy Sister knows best  But with all her demureness and humility she has no objection to be Lady Melvil it seems nor to any wickedness that can make her so  Mrs Heidel  She Lady Melville Compose yourself Niece I'll ladyship her indeeda little creepin cantinShe shan't be the better for a farden of my money But tell me child how does this intriguing with Sir John correspond with her partiality to Lovewell I don't see a concatunation here  Miss Sterl  There I was deceived Madam I took all their whisperings and stealing into corners to be the mere attraction of vulgar minds but behold their private meetings were not to contrive their own insipid happiness but to conspire against mineBut I know whence proceeds Mr Lovewell's resentment to me I could not stoop to be familiar with my father's clerk and so I have lost his interest  Mrs Heidel  My spurrit to a TMy dear child  kissing her  Mr Heidelberg lost his election for member of parliament because I would not demean myself to be slobbered about by drunken shoemakers beastly cheesemongers and greasy butchers and tallowchandlers However Niece I can't help diffuring a little in opinion from you in this matter My experunce and sagucity makes me still suspect that there is something more between her and that Lovewell notwithstanding this affair of Sir JohnI had my eye upon them the whole time of breakfastSir John I observed looked a little confounded indeed though I knew nothing of what had passed in the garden You seemed to sit upon thorns too but Fanny and Mr Lovewell made quite anotherguess sort of a figur and were as perfet a pictur of two distrest lovers as if it had been drawn by Raphael AngeloAs to Sir John and Fanny I want a matter of fact  Miss Sterl  Matter of fact Madam Did not I come unexpectedly upon them Was not Sir John kneeling at her feet and kissing her hand Did not he look all love and she all confusion Is not that matter of fact And did not Sir John the moment that Papa was called out of the room to the lawyermen get up from breakfast and follow him imme+diately And I warrant you that by this time he has made proposals to him to marry my sisterOh that some other person an earl or a duke would make his addresses to me that I might be revenged on this monster  Mrs Heidel  Be cool child you  shall  be Lady Melvil in spite of all their caballins if it costs me ten thousand pounds to turn the scale Sir John may apply to my brother indeed but I'll make them all know who governs in this fammaly  Miss Sterl  As I live Madam yonder comes Sir John A base man I can't endure the sight of him I'll leave the room this instant  disordered  Mrs Heidel  Poor thing Well retire to your own chamber child I'll give it him I warrant you and by and by I'll come and let you know all that has past between us  Miss Sterl  Pray do Madam  looking back  A vile wretch  Exit in a rage  Enter Sir  John Melvil  Sir John  Your most obedient humble servant Madam  bowing very respectfully  Mrs Heidel  Your servant Sir John  dropping a halfcurtsy and pouting  Sir John  Miss Sterling's manner of quitting the room on my approach and the visible coolness of your behaviour to me Madam convince me that she has acquainted you with what past this morning  Mrs Heidel  I am very sorry Sir John to be made acquainted with any thing that should induce me to change the opinon which I could always wish to entertain of a person of quallaty  pouting  Sir John  It has always been my ambition to merit the best opinion from Mrs Heidelberg and when she comes to weigh all circumstances I flatter myself  Mrs Heidel  You  do  flatter yourself if you imagine that I can approve of your behaviour to my niece Sir JohnAnd give me leave to tell you Sir John that you have been drawn into an action much beneath you Sir John and that I look upon every injury offered to Miss Betty Sterling as an affront to myself Sir John  warmly  Sir John  I would not offend you for the world Madam but when I am influenced by a partiality for another however illfounded I hope your discernment and good sense will think it rather a point of honour to renounce engagements which I could not fulfil so strictly as I ought and that you will excuse the change in my inclinations since the new object as well as the first has the honour of being your niece Madam  Mrs Heidel  I disclaim her as a niece Sir John Miss Sterling disclaims her as a sister and the whole fammaly must disclaim her for her monstrus baseness and treachery  Sir John  Indeed she has been guilty of none Madam Her hand and heart are I am sure entirely at the disposal of yourself and Mr Sterling  Enter  Sterling  behind  And if you should not oppose my inclinations I am sure of Mr Sterling's consent Madam  Mrs Heidel  Indeed  Sir John  Quite certain Madam  Sterl  behind  So they seem to be coming to terms already I may venture to make my appearance  Mrs Heidel  To marry Fanny    Sterling  advances by degrees  Sir John  Yes Madam  Mrs Heidel  My brother has given his consent you say  Sir John  In the most ample manner with no other restriction than the failure of your concurrence Madam  sees  Sterling    Oh here's Mr Sterling who will confirm what I have told you  Mrs Heidel  What have you consented to give up your own daughter in this manner brother  Sterl  Give her up no not give her up sister only in case that youZounds I am afraid you have said too much Sir John  apart to Sir  John  Mrs Heidel  Yes yes I see now that it is true enough what my niece told me You are all plottin and caballin against herPray does Lord Ogleby know of this affair  Sir John  I have not yet made him acquainted with it Madam  Mrs Heidel  No I warrant you I thought soAnd so his Lordship and myself truly are not to be consulted 'till the last  Sterl  What did not you consult my Lord Oh fie for shame Sir John  Sir John  Nay but Mr Sterling  Mrs Heidel  We who are the persons of most consequence and experunce in the two fammalies are to know nothing of the matter 'till the whole is as good as concluded upon But his Lordship I am sure will have more generosaty than to countenance such a perceedingAnd I could not have expected such behavour from a person of your quallaty Sir JohnAnd as for you brother  Sterl  Nay nay but hear me sister  Mrs Heidel  I am perfetly ashamed of youHave you no spurrit no more concern for the honour of our fammaly than to consent  Sterl  ConsentI consentAs I hope for mercy I never gave my consent Did I consent Sir John  Sir John  Not absolutely without Mrs Heidelberg's concurrence But in case of her approbation  Sterl  Ay I grant you if my sister approvedBut that's quite another thing you know  to Mrs  Heidelberg  Mrs Heidel  Your sister approve indeedI thought you know her better brother SterlingWhat approve of having your eldest daughter returned upon your hands and exchanged for the youngerI am surprized how you could listen to such a scandalus proposal  Sterl  I tell you I never did listen to itDid not I say that I would be governed entirely by my sister Sir JohnAnd unless she agreed to your marrying Fanny  Mrs Heidel  I agree to his marrying Fanny abominable The man is absolutely out of his sensesCan't that wise head of yours foresee the consequence of all this brother Sterling Will Sir John take Fanny without a fortune NoAfter you have settled the largest part of your property on your youngest daughter can there be an equal portion left for the eldest NoDoes not this overturn the whole systum of the fammaly Yes yes yes You know I was always for my niece Betsey's marrying a person of the very first quallaty That was my maxum And therefore much the largest settlement was of course to be made upon herAs for Fanny if she could with a fortune of twenty or thirty thousand pounds get a knight or a member of parliament or a rich commoncouncilman for a husband I thought it might do very well  Sir John  But if a better match should offer itself why should not it be accepted Madam  Mrs Heidel  What at the expence of her elder sister Oh fie Sir JohnHow could you bear to hear of such an indignaty brother Sterling  Sterl  I nay I shan't hear of it I promise youI can't hear of it indeed Sir John  Mrs Heidel  But you  have  heard of it brother Sterling You know you have and sent Sir John  to propose it to me But if you can give up your daughter I shan't forsake my niece I assure you Ah if my poor dear Mr Heidelberg and our sweet babes had been alive he would not have behaved so  Sterl  Did I Sir John nay speakBring me off or we are ruined  apart to Sir  John  Sir John  Why to be sure to speak the truth  Mrs Heidel  To speak the truth I'm ashamed of you both But have a care what you are about brother have a care I say The lawyers are in the house I hear and if every thing is not settled to my liking I'll have nothing more to say to you if I live these hundred yearsI'll go over to Holland and settle with Mr Vanderspracken my poor husband's first cousin and my own fammaly shall never be the better for a farden of my money I promise you  Exit  Manent Sir  John  and  Sterling  Sterl  I thought so I knew she never would agree to it  Sir John  'Sdeath how unfortunate What can we do Mr Sterling  Sterl  Nothing  Sir John  What must our agreement break off the moment it is made then  Sterl  It can't be helped Sir John The family as I told you before have great expectations from my sister and if this matter proceeds you hear yourself that she threatens to leave usMy brother Heidelberg was a warm man a very warm man and died worth a Plumb at least a Plumb ay I warrant you he died worth a Plumb and a half  Sir John  Well but if I  Sterl  And then my sister has three or four very good mortgages a deal of money in the three per+cents and old SouthSea annuities besides large concerns in the Dutch and French fundsThe  greatest part of all this she means to leave to our family  Sir John  I can only say Sir  Sterl  Why your offer of the difference of thirty thousand was very fair and handsome to be sure Sir John  Sir John  Nay but I am even willing to  Sterl  Ay but if I was to accept it against her will I might lose above a hundred thousand so you see the ballance is against you Sir John  Sir John  But is there no way do you think of prevailing on Mrs Heidelberg to grant her consent  Sterl  I am afraid notHowever when her passion is a little abatedfor she's very passionateyou may try what can be done but you must not use my name any more Sir John  Sir John  Suppose I was to prevail on Lord Ogleby to apply to her do you think that would have any influence over her  Sterl  I think he would be more likely to persuade her to it than any other person in the family She has a great respect for Lord Ogleby She loves a lord  Sir John  I'll apply to him this very dayAnd if he should prevail on Mrs Heidelberg I may depend on your friendship Mr Sterling  Sterl  Ay ay I shall be glad to oblige you when it is in my power but as the account stands now you see it is not upon the figures And so your servant Sir John  Exit  Sir  John Melvil  alone  What a situation am I inBreaking off with her whom I was bound by treaty to marry rejected by the object of my affections and embroiled with this turbulent woman who governs the whole familyAnd yet opposition instead of smothering increases my inclination I must have her I'll apply immediately to Lord Ogleby and if he can but bring  over the aunt to our party her influence will overcome the scruples and delicacy of my dear Fanny and I shall be the happiest of mankind  Exit  ACT IV  SCENE I  A room  Enter  Sterling  Mrs  Heidelberg  and Miss  Sterling  Sterl  WHAT will you send Fanny to town sister  Mrs Heidel  Tomorrow morning I've given orders about it already  Sterl  Indeed  Mrs Heidel  Positively  Sterl  But consider sister at such a time as this what an odd appearance it will have  Mrs Heidel  Not half so odd as her behaviour brotherThis time was intended for happiness and I'll keep no incendaries here to destroy it I insist on her going off tomorrow morning  Sterl  I'm afraid this is all your doing Betsey  Miss Sterl  No indeed Papa My aunt knows that it is notFor all Fanny's baseness to me I am sure I would not do or say any thing to hurt her with you or my aunt for the world  Mrs Heidel  Hold your tongue BetseyI will have my wayWhen she is packed off every thing will go on as it should doSince they are at their intrigues I'll let them see that we can act with vigur on our part and the sending her out of the way shall be the purlimunary step to all the rest of my perceedings  Sterl  Well but sister  Mrs Heidel  It does not signify talking brother Sterling for I'm resolved to be rid of her and I will  Come along child  to Miss  Sterling    The postshay shall be at the door by six o'clock in the morning and if Miss Fanny does not get into it why  I  will and so there's an end of the matter  bounces out with Miss  Sterling  Mrs  Heidelberg  returns  Mrs Heidel  One word more brother SterlingI expect that you will take your eldest daughter in your hand and make a formal complaint to Lord Ogleby of Sir John Melvil's behaviourDo this brother shew a proper regard for the honour of your fammaly yourself and I shall throw in my mite to the raising of it If notbut now you know my mind So act as you please and take the consequences  Exit  Sterling  alone  The devil's in the woman for tyrannymothers wives mistresses or sisters they always will govern usAs to my sister Heidelberg she knows the strength of her purse and domineers upon the credit of it"I will do this"and "you shall do that"and "you must do t'other or else the fammaly shan't have a farden of"  mimicking  So absolute with her moneybut to say the truth nothing but money  can  make us absolute and so we must e'en make the best of her  SCENE changes to the garden  Enter Lord  Ogleby  and  Canton  Lord Ogle  What Mademoiselle Fanny to be sent awayWhyWhereforeWhat's the meaning of all this  Cant  Je ne

Serjeant Flower  Well but Mr Sterling no danger I hopeHave they made a burglarious entryAre you prepar'd to repulse themI am very much alarm'd about thieves at circuittimeThey would be particularly severe with us gentlemen of the bar  Traverse  No danger Mr SterlingNo trespass I hope  Sterl  None gentlemen but of those ladies making  Mrs Heidel  You'll be asham'd to know gentlemen that all your labours and studies about this  young lady are thrown awaySir John Melvil is at this moment lock'd up with this lady's younger sister  Serjeant Flower  The thing is a little extraordinary to be surebut why were we to be frighten'd out of our beds for this Could not we have try'd this cause tomorrow morning  Miss Sterl  But Sir by tomorrow morning perhaps even your assistance would not have been of any servicethe birds now in that cage would have flown away  Enter Lord  Ogleby  in his robe de chambre night cap cleaning on  Canton    Lord Ogle  I had rather lose a limb than my night's restwhat's the matter with you all  Sterl  Ay ay 'tis all overHere's my Lord too  Lord Ogle  What is all this shrieking and screamingWhere's my angelick Fanny She's safe I hope  Mrs Heidel  Your angelick Fanny my Lord is lock'd up with your angelick nephew in that chamber  Lord Ogle  My nephew then will I be excommunicated  Mrs Heidel  Your nephew my Lord has been plotting to run away with the younger sister and the younger sister has been plotting to run away with your nephew and if we had not watch'd them and call'd up the fammaly they had been upon the scamper to Scotland by this time  Lord Ogle  Look'ee ladiesI know that Sir John has conceiv'd a violent passion for Miss Fanny and I know too that Miss Fanny has conceiv'd a violent passion for another person and I am so well convinc'd of the rectitude of her affections that I will support them with my fortune my honour and my lifeEh shant I Mr Sterling  smiling  what say you  Sterl  sulkily  To be sure my LordThese bawling women have been the ruin of every thing  aside  Lord Ogle  But come I'll end this business in a triceif you ladies will compose yourselves and Mr Sterling will insure Miss Fanny from violence I will engage to draw her from her pillow with a whisper thro' the keyhole  Mrs Heidel  The horrid creaturesI say my Lord break the door open  Lord Ogle  Let me beg of your delicacy not to be too precipitateNow to our experiment  advancing towards the door  Miss Sterl  Now what will they domy heart will beat thro' my bosom  Enter  Betty  with the key  Betty  There's no occasion for breaking open doors my Lord we have done nothing that we ought to be asham'd of and my mistress shall face her enemies  going to unlock the door  Mrs Heidel  There's impudence  Lord Ogle  The mystery thickens Lady of the bedchamber  to Betty  open the door and intreat Sir John Melvil for these ladies will have it that he is there to appear and answer to high crimes and misdemeanorsCall Sir John Melvil into the court  Enter Sir  John Melvil  on the other side  Sir John  I am here my Lord  Mrs Heidel  Heyday  Miss Sterl  Astonishment  Sir John  What is all this alarm and confusion there is nothing but hurry in the house what is the reason of it  Lord Ogle  Because you have been in that chamber  have  been nay you  are  there at this moment as these ladies have protested so don't deny it  Traverse  This is the clearest  Alibi  I ever knew Mr Serjeant  Flower  Luce clarius  Lord Ogle  Upon my word ladies if you have often these frolicks it would be really entertaining to pass a whole summer with you But come  to Betty  open the door and intreat your amiable mistress to come forth and dispel all our doubts with her smiles  Betty  opening the door  Madam you are wanted in this room  pertly  Enter  Fanny  in great confusion  Miss Sterl  You see she's ready dress'dand what confusion she's in  Mrs Heidel  Ready to pack off bag and baggageher guilt confounds her  Flowers  Silence in the court ladies  Fanny  I  am  confounded indeed Madam  Lord Ogle  Don't droop my beauteous lilly but with your own peculiar modesty declare your state of mindPour conviction into their ears and raptures into mine  smiling  Fanny  I am at this moment the most unhappymost distrestthe tumult is too much for my heartand I want the power to reveal a secret which to conceal has been the misfortune and misery of mymy  faints away  speaking all at once  Lord Ogle  She faints help help for the fairest and best of women  Betty  running to her  O my dear mistresshelp help there  Sir John  Ha let me fly to her assistance  Lovewell  rushes out from the chamber  Lovew  My Fanny in danger I can contain no longerPrudence were now a crime all other cares are lost in thisspeak speak to me my dearest Fannylet me but hear thy voice open your eyes and bless me with the smallest sign of life  during this speech they are all in amazement  Miss Sterl  LovewellI am easy  Mrs Heidel  I am thunderstuck  Lord Ogle  I am petrify'd  Sir John  And I undone  Fanny  recovering  O Lovewelleven supported by thee I dare not look my father nor his Lordship in the face  Sterl  What now did not I send you to London Sir  Lord Ogle  EhWhatHow's thisby what right and title have you been half the night in that lady's bedchamber  Lovew  By that right that makes me the happiest of men and by a title which I would not forego for any the best of kings could give me  Betty  I could cry my eyes out to hear his magnimity  Lord Ogle  I am annihilated  Sterl  I have been choaked with rage and wonder but now I can speakZounds what have you to say to meLovewell you are a villainYou have broke your word with me  Fanny  Indeed Sir he has notYou forbad him to think of me when it was out of his power to obey you we have been married these four months  Sterl  And he shan't stay in my house four hours What baseness and treachery As for you you shall repent this step as long as you live Madam  Fanny  Indeed Sir it is impossible to conceive the tortures I have already endured in consequence of my disobedience My heart has continually upbraided me for it and though I was too weak to struggle with affection I feel that I must be miserable for ever without your forgiveness  Sterl  Lovewell you shall leave my house directlyand you shall follow him Madam  to Fanny  Lord Ogle  And if they do I will receive them into mine Look ye Mr Sterling there have been some  mistakes which we had all better forget for our own sakes and the best way to forget them is to forgive the cause of them which I do from my soulPoor girl I swore to support her affection with my life and fortune'tis a debt of honour and must be paidyou swore as much too Mr Sterling but your laws in the city will excuse  you  I suppose for you never strike a ballance without errors excepted  Sterl  I am a father my Lord but for the sake of all other fathers I think I ought not to forgive her for fear of encouraging other silly girls like herself to throw themselves away without the consent of their parents  Lovew  I hope there will be no danger of that Sir Young ladies with minds like my Fanny's would startle at the very shadow of vice and when they know to what uneasiness only an indiscretion has exposed her her example instead of encouraging will rather serve to deter them  Mrs Heidel  Indiscretion quoth a a mighty pretty delicat word to express disobedience  Lord Ogle  For my part I indulge my own passions too much to tyrannize over those of other people Poor souls I pity them And you must forgive them too Come come melt a little of your flint Mr Sterling  Sterl  Why whyas to that my Lordto be sure he is a relation of yours my Lordwhat say  you  sister Heidelberg  Mrs Heidel  The girl's ruined and I forgive her  Sterl  Wellso do I thenNay no thanks  to Lovewell and Fanny who seem preparing to speak  there's an end of the matter  Lord Ogle  But Lovewell what makes you dumb all this while  Lovew  Your kindness my LordI can scarce believe my own sensesthey are all in a tumult of fear joy love expectation and gratitude I ever was and am now more bound in duty to your Lordship  for you Mr Sterling if every moment of my life spent gratefully in your service will in some measure compensate the want of fortune you perhaps will not repent your goodness to me And you ladies I flatter myself will not for the future suspect me of artifice and intrigueI shall be happy to oblige and serve youAs for you Sir John  Sir John  No apologies to me Lovewell I do not deserve any All I have to offer in excuse for what has happened is my total ignorance of your situation Had you dealt a little more openly with me you would have saved me and yourself and that lady who I hope will pardon my behaviour a great deal of uneasiness Give me leave however to assure you that light and capricious as I may have appeared now my infatuation is over I have sensibility enough to be ashamed of the part I have acted and honour enough to rejoice at your happiness  Lovew  And now my dearest Fanny though we are seemingly the happiest of beings yet all our joys will be dampt if his Lordship's generosity and Mr Sterling's forgiveness should not be succeeded by the indulgence approbation and consent of these our best benefactors  To the audience  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Written by Mr GARRICK  CHARACTERS of the EPILOGUE  Lord
