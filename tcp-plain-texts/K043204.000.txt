 LOVE'S FRAILTIES A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENTGARDEN  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  LONDON PRINTED FOR SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORD STREET    ADVERTISEMENT  THOSE passages that are printed in  Italics  not including the French were omitted on the first representation one excepted page of which the words that then gave offence are distinguished by capitals They are thus pointed out that the reader who in the heat of political zeal has not quite lost his understanding may examine what there is in them injurious to truth or the good of mankind and find it if he can In different times and under different feelings it will appear astonishing that any one of these passages were suppressed from any apprehension of political resentment but such was the fact That the one unwarily retained should excite the anger which was testified is still more astonishing A sentence so true as to have been repeated in a thousand different modes for all strong moral truths are subject to such repetition A sentence that under a variety of forms and phraseology is proverbial in all nations It ought however to be remembered that the persons offended though violent were few Their intention doubtless was good the same cannot be affirmed of their intellect  Those who are acquainted with German literature and who have read the drama entitled  Der Deutsche Hausvater  by the Baron von Gemmingen will immediately perceive that the author has availed himself of various incidents and thoughts in that piece though his fable characters and denouement are exceedingly different Others who wish to satisfy their curiosity but who cannot read German may find a French translation of that piece in volume VI of a work entitled  Nouveau Theatre Allemand  by M M Friedel and de Bonneville  NewmanStreet  February  THE reasons which have occasioned the alteration of price in the present comedy ought to be stated to the public The previous knowledge of men and manners and the extraordinary efforts of study time and talents which are necessary to produce a play that has but a chance of being sanctioned by the town are sufficiently obvious The labourer is worthy of his hire In the beginning of the present century the price of an octavo play was eighteen pence Since that period the price of paper has been doubled the expence of printing is advanced in nearly the same ratio and advertising which now amounts to a considerable sum was then a burthen unknown It has long been the complaint of the trade that the purchase of the copyright added to the above costs occasioned plays to be a dangerous speculation The new tax on paper in addition to all these has made it impossible at the former price to reward authors and afford the bookseller a reasonable hope of profit These considerations have induced an advance of price at which it is presumed no just reasoner will take offence  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr BERNARD  "PROLOGUES have long been plac'd like little  a  "Before that great noun substantive a play"  Not form'd of winged words but wanting wings  "Of common gender halfnomeaning things  "Like ragfair robes made up with little skill  "To suit farce tragedy or what you will  "Mere tasteless breadcrumbs only fit for stuffing"  A cringing crew and vilely prone to puffing  Beggars well satisfied at any rate  To feed on offals at the public gate  "Or running footmen" sent with whoop and hollo  Types of the vapid things that are to follow  Grace before meat which while the dinner cools  Is twang'd by knaves and listen'd to by fools  But let us take nor waste our little wit  A single theme that may our purpose fit  "Prologues are scouts that skulk from post to post  "And scour the field to watch the adverse host  "Heroes invincible Left Right Front Rear  "Embattl'd ranks ye thrill the soul with fear"  Wadded with critic spleen  Pit  and prim'd with ire  Charg'd to the muzzle ready to give fire  To slaughter some inclin'd and some to sleep  "Lo ruthless veterans rang'd intrench'd chin deep  "Flanking this fearful centre in a ring  Boxes  "Gay knights and Amazons form either wing  "Corps of reserve  Gallery  drawn up in dread array  "On yonder heights await the coming fray"  But as you're strong be just in this fierce battle  Ye godlike men of might and maids of mettle  Here let us pause for ah 'tis but too true  Cassandra like in black prophetic view  I see the massacres that may ensue  Wit humour character are put to rout  The prompter breathless and the actors out  Quibbles and claptraps in confusion run  Slain is a sentiment Down drops a pun  Nay plot himself that leader far renown'd  Oh shame dare scarcely stand another round  "How shall our general dare such danger meet  "Were it not better think you sirs to treat  "War honours grant then as he files away  "So may he live and fight another day"  For the subject of this Prologue and the lines marked with inverted commas the author is indebted to a literary friend  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs ESTEN  AS some poor wand'rer who with eager flight  Is homeward hurried by the approach of night  Comes to the deep abyss o'er which is thrown  Trunk of old oak or wedge of unhewn stone  Tremendous bridge which he must venture o'er  Braving the horrid gulph and cataract roar  Slippery abrupt no hold no stay no trust  The first false step is death Yet cross he must  Safely on t'other side looks shivering back  And palpitating views the dreadful track  So stands the happy bard from danger free  And trembles at his own temerity  Bold is the man or little prone to fear  Who hopes to write what's fit for you to hear  Conscious what splendid feasts regale this stage  Prepar'd by other bards born of another age  Oh Congreve Otway Shakespear mighty shades  Whose genius every realm of thought pervades  Gifts such as yours alas where shall we find  Words that with living pictures fill the mind  Extatic imagery thoughts divine  And volumes utter'd in a single line  But ah of them and of their heav'nly lays  Fools to remind you by presumptuous praise  Dropt be the sacred veil we've rashly dar'd to raise  What can be done Were will like wishing free  Various and rich should each fresh banquet be  Emralds and pearls dissolv'd in liquid gold  Had we the alchymy were yours tenfold  Like those poor Arabs who in deserts live  The little that we have we freely give  Finding what may but chance to please your taste  We serve the morsel up with eager haste  Happy in this you know our good intent  And take in honest part what honestly is meant  DRAMATIS

Seym  I WILL not hear you Louisa In love yourself with a man destitute of rank and fortune ought you to school me  Lady L  A man of family brother though not of rank  Seym  Pennyless a lieutenant in a marching regiment  Lady L  But possessed of honour worth and virtue  Seym  And who has more honour worth and virtue than my Paulina  Lady L  A painter's daughter Charles  Seym  A divinity Her beauty angelic her mind godlike  Lady L  Thus we lovers rave The world contains but one  Seym  Where is there another Paulina Encumbered by the absurdities of folly disguised by the  ridiculous trappings of fashion where shall the sincere the simple the affectionate heart be found I enter the tumultuous assemblies of the idle and all is vanity all affectation all incoherency This hubbub of incongruous and despicable passions but maddens my mind and by the contrast irradiates the abode of peace and Paulina  Lady L  Ah Charles you forget our dependent situation our family  Seym  Our fools and tyrants An elder brother whose rank wealth and power instead of affording us protection have been made the passports of folly and vice and an uncle whose benevolence is self love who has given us shelter only to make us slaves at once a cynic and a sensualist severe to others indulgent to himself arbitrary in principle libidinous in practice  Lady L  Alas too true Sir Gregory pardons nobody's faults but his own  Seym  Did he not suffer his sister to languish and die in penury in a foreign land And what was her crime Marriage with a man of a noble mind but who had the misfortune to be poor and unprotected  Lady L  'Tis that makes me shudder  The very same fate is impending over our heads  Seym  Let it fall at least on me Injustice to myself shall not make me unjust to others  Lady L  Ay but there's the question Your poor painter's daughter may considering the indigence in which she has been bred be the phoenix you think her but can you Charles honestly aver she is the equal of Lady Fancourt  Seym  Her superiour  Lady L  Not to dwell on rank fortune  fame and power which she so eminently possesses and which surely are something  Seym  Bawbles The gewgaws of fools  Lady L  Is the mind of Paulina equally cultivated equally penetrating strong and towering  Seym  More More  Lady L  Ah Charles  Seym  By heavens more  Lady L  Lady Fancourt is a woman of ten thousand  Seym  I grant it  Lady L  She has conceived a partiality for you Sir Gregory has discovered it and is determined on the match  Seym  And I am determined it shall never take place  Lady L  For my sake think again  Seym  At your request I have already been torturing Paulina and myself I have not seen her for a week an excruciating eternal week  But I will be guilty of this cruel injustice no longer  Lady L  Remember your own principles Charles remember truth We must not with the avarice of egotism live for self but for society You have duties to mankind for the fulfilling of which you ought not to be disabled by the indulgence of passion  Seym  I own it and the doubts of what these duties are haunt and perturb my mind incessantly render me undecided cause me every hour to form a thousand contradictory plans and instead of making me active and firm murder resolution and torment me into restless suspence  Lady L  Opinion is the slave of error the  world is the slave of opinion and we are the slaves of the world  Seym  'Tis your situation Louisa that rivets my shackles which else I would break and brave the world's injustice and an uncle's tyranny But I know your affection for Mr Compton I am sensible of his worth and I cannot dare not abandon you to the wretchedness I foresee should I disobey Sir Gregory  Lady L  In tears  CharlesYour kindness is killing I can endure any thing but that  Seym  And why  Lady L  I do not deserve it  Seym  What do you mean  Lady L  I have deceived you  Seym  Which way  Lady L  For this fortnight my heart has been bursting with a secret which my tongue has not dared to utter  Seym  HeavensI guessI forebodeYou are married  Lady L  I am  Seym  Why then 'tis pastYou have got the start of meI have hesitated you have resolved and Paulina the affectionate pure hearted noble minded Paulina must be sacrificed or poverty persecution contempt and misery must be the fate of all  Lady L  I am a selfish wretch and deserve the worst that can befall me  Seym  No noWhere is your husband  Lady L  Looking round  For heaven's sake beware  Seym  Well well where is Mr Compton  Lady L  On duty with his regiment in Yorkshire to which he was suddenly ordered and as I suspect by the management of Sir Gregory  Seym  Who not only threatens but acts  Lady L  He has written to me concerning Mr Compton and with such severity He has quite killed the little hope I had  Seym  I expect his arrival from the country every minute Disperse your gloom be chearful  Lady L  A smiling face with an aching heart is a painful task  Seym  But now more than ever necessary His preaching and his practice are so opposite that he dreads detection and hates ridicule You have the art to keep him in some awe  Lady L  I had but want the courage now to practice it  Seym  Nay nay but you mustOh Paulina  Sir Greg  Without  Why William James  Lady L  Here he comes  Sir Greg  Where are you all  SCENE II  Enter Sir  GREGORY OLDWORT  Lady L  Assuming chearfulness  You are welcome home Sir Gregory  Sir Greg  So you say  Seym  I hope you have had a pleasant journey▪ sir  Sir Greg  To a footman  Take this coat Dust enough The roads are as crowded as the streets and have no less hurry noise and insolence  Lady L  A mob is always unmannerly  Sir Greg  And the whole world is become a mob Ah what different beings were our brave ancestors the bold barons  Lady L  Ay uncle How delightful it is to contemplate their venerable figures in old Gothic cathedrals  Sir Greg  Kneeling in marble with their huge helmets long swords alabaster ruffs grim beards and gruff faces that seem to bid you keep your distance or damme they will rise and knock you down as soon as they have done praying  Lady L  And yet somehow a little modish politeness and delicacy  Sir Greg  I hate the words They are outlandish contraband and were imported in some damned cargo of fans muffs fringed nightcaps and chicken gloves  Lady L  I own it would be diverting to see a modern  petitmaitre  in a coat of mail  Sir Greg  Zounds He would melt under it like a man of snow before the sun A coat of mail A coat of pink tiffany A degenerateAhI have not patience A robust hearty fellow that speaks what he thinks eats when he is hungry and fights when he is angry is called barbarian horrid brute And the sight of such a phenomenon would infallibly throw a whole assembly men women and fiddlers into hysterics  Lady L  Aside to Charles observing him in a reverie  CharlesWhere are your thoughts  Seym  Where they ought never to be yet there they always are  Sir Greg  No no the disease has attacked the vitals The blood of our nobles is contaminated All rank all order all distinction is lost Dukes and jockeys earls and hopdealers peers and pickpockets all mingle indiscriminately and hold their nightly orgies at a hazard table  Lady L  Calculation uncle is the wisdom of the age  Sir Greg  Yes he is most learned who best knows the odds and he most renowned who  fleeces his fellows with the greatest adroitnessHave you seen Lady Fancourt today  To Charles  Seym  'Tis too early sir  Sir Greg  Yesterday  Seym  No sir  Sir Greg  No sir Had not you my commands sir  Seym  I had  Sir Greg  And how came they to be disobeyed  Seym  Because commanding is less difficult than obedience  Sir Greg  With severity  Sir if ever you expect any favour or countenance from me go this very day and tomorrow and every day and assiduously pay your court to that lady I'll hear no answer  Exit Seymour  SCENE III  Sir  GREGORY  Lady  LOUISA  Lady L  I declare uncle you are so severe you frighten one  Sir Greg  Sternly  Have you received my letter  Lady L  Ay that too was severe enough  Sir Greg  Madam  Lady L  Mr Compton is a gentleman  Sir Greg  Without rank connexions or estate  Lady L  His heart and understanding  Sir Greg  With great determination and severity  If I hear another word concerning him you shall quit this house and my protection for ever  Lady L  After a struggle resuming her temper  Well we all have our failings  Sir Greg  I would have you both beware  Lady L  My brother and I are young we have some excuse  Sir Greg  Because being young and foolish you neglect the advice and disobey the commands of the experienced and wise  Lady L  Why if the experienced and wise are as  Sir Greg  As whatWhat do you mean  Lady L  Nay don't be alarmed uncle  Sir Greg  IAlarmed  Lady L  I have heard  Sir Greg  What have you heard  SCENE IV  Enter Footman and Mr  MUSCADEL  Foot  Mr Muscadel  Exit  Lady L  That the experienced and the wise have their frolicks  Sir Greg  Aside

whimsical stories  Sir Greg  I insist Such calumny sir  Musc  That you steal out by twilight and if you see a cap and apron in the square you hobble after with aHem Hist Pretty maid Where are you going Where do you live Don't be in such a hurry  Sir Greg  I I  Musc  That you buy silk purses by the dozen and put five new half guineas into each and that for want of better conversation you ask every girl you can come up with if she is a good sempstress for you have always plenty of needlework  Sir Greg  I I needlework  Musc  You  Sir Greg  I talk to young girls  Musc  Nay that you have been seen to attempt to kiss them under your own lamps  Sir Greg  Was ever such malignity I  Musc  And that you press them by the hand pat their cheeks tweak their chins and fondle them as Lady Mary Muzzy does her fat lapdog  Sir Greg  Mercy on me  Musc  That you carry silk handkerchiefs too and ribbands and oranges  Sir Greg  With great anxiety and half whispering  Here's somebody coming  SCENE V  Reenter  SEYMOUR  Seym  I forgot to ask have you any further commands for me sir  Sir Greg  No sir Begone  Musc  No no stay CharlesAnd that you  Sir Greg  Begone sir  Musc  That you  Sir Greg  Begone

fire though rather rusticated but my instructions and a little polite varnish will soon display  those bold tints and original touches which a bad light and a college education have obscured  Sir Greg  He has already profited by your lessons sir  Musc  Yes Lady Fancourt herself made the same remark but yesterday  Lady L  Charles is become a favourite with her ladyship  Musc  Is he  Lady L  Nay don't be jealous  Musc  Jealous Ha ha ha That is excellent I jealous Am I not an adept in all the delightful follies of fashion Do I not lead the mode and make those dear whims which are ridiculous in

Sitting or standing riding or walking I do every thing with a grace See me take out my handkerchief put on my gloves pick up a fan present a bouquet dangle in my chair loll in my chariot the most trifling actions are made interesting by my manner Nay I even sleep like a gentleman  Sir Greg  I think Mr Muscadel it is now six years since you came to your estate  Musc  You are right It was a great epocha My father died in the morning I was in full possession before noon in the evening I had an assignation with a beautiful woman was caught by the husband in her bedchamber appointed to

for Dover and enjoyed a hearty supper my bottle of Burgundy a French  chanson d'amour  and a sound sleep the next night at Calais  Sir Greg  While your father and the man you had wronged lay stretched on their bier  Musc  UmNo as it happened the gentleman mended in spite of me and the doctors the news was sent me we became the best of friends and in six weeks I had the pleasure to wish him joy of his recovery  Sir Greg  After seducing his wife and  Musc  Was it my fault that she was handsome and I irresistible  Sir Greg  Ha You may well be a favourite with the ladies  Musc  Oh yes I can't help

Aside  Baboon  Musc  You are an old bachelor too and have been all your life preaching continence and practicing  Sir Greg  Suddenly  Sir I must beg you will not any more make free with my moral character  Lady L  Fie Mr Muscadel There is nothing of which Sir Gregory is so chary as his moral character  Sir Greg  Niece  Musc  Egad it is very true a fair character like a fair skin if closely inspected has a thousand irregularities  Lady L  Significantly  Ay like the purple bloom on a fresh gathered plum it must be admired not touched if you handle it you destroy its beautyDon't you uncle  Musc  Your character and mine baronet are certainly very opposite  Sir Greg  Or I would hang myself You pretend to wit but like booksellers you deal in what you don't understand  Musc  Ha ha ha You are an eight day clock wound up once a week a fixed star that every fool knows where to find an evergreen always of  one colour a parish clerk whose whole vocabulary begins and ends in amen I am a camelion an English Aprilday a comet that always appears in a blaze is the talk of the town the terror of married men and the admiration of the whole world While everybody is enquiring whence it comes how long it stays where it goes and when it returns  Lady L  You affect singularity Mr Muscadel  Musc  No it is natural to me We men of fashion are always leading the canaille into absurdities purposely to laugh at them We are a kind of Will with a wisp we glitter and entice the gazer into a bog and there leave him  Lady L  Come come I must begone to dress  Sir Greg  Ah you are rare animals  Musc  Meteors Sir Gregory which you terrestrials may gaze at but cannot reach a kind of rainbow the splendor of which everybody admires but nobody can equal  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II

like truth is the most splendid when least encumbered  Musc  Tolerably well that but a little too sentimental  Lady F  Aside  Will he not go  Musc  You do well Seymour to come here for lessons See with what fashionable originality Lady Fancourt and I express I mean conceal our mutual affection  Lady F  Sir  Musc  'Tis true I have sacrificed as I ought fifty of the finest women in England to her

will find him very entertaining Lady Fancourt  Lady F  The entertainment sir which consists in gratifying spleen at the expence of feeling is not very enviable  Musc  Spleen Oh no you mistake Ha ha ha I never knew what spleen envy or jealousy  were in my life NeverBut I am sorry to punish you both by leaving you together You will soon miss me Charles don't begin to yawn too soon And let me tell you a secret before I go Woman you know is a riddle the solution to which is you must either use her very ill or be treated worse by her than a straggling hound by a whipperin La la la la Goodmorrow to

Lady F  Do you think so I have sometimes been of that opinion sometimes not  Seym  As a proof he has a real respect and admiration for your ladyship  Lady F  For me or for my rank wealth and powerful connexions  Seym  If I can judge his passion is sincere and ardent  Lady F  I am sorry for itThe caprices of love Mr Seymour are often cruel  Seym  And often fatal Yet I begin to suspect they are the mere creatures of our own disordered imaginations  Lady F  Aside  There is hope in that thoughtWhy true How then can we answer it to our relations or the world if seduced by some fancied beauties of person perhaps by the mere accident of complexion which a frosty air gives and a gloomy day destroys looking no deeper we turn from prosperity and wilfully embrace ruin in which we not only involve ourselves but all who are nearest and dearest to the heart  Seym  Disturbed  'Tis cowardice Guilt  Lady F  Preceded by perturbation followed by remorse beginning in folly ending in despair  Seym  In a deep reverie  The picture is false Not thy complexion Paulina No 'tis thy emanating divine mind  Lady F  Mr Seymour  Seym  MadamI have a weaknessIt hourly hurries me into absurdity  Lady F  Aside  And what have I  Seym  I am unfit company  Lady F  Nay one momentYour uncle has told me you have thoughts of marriage 'Tis a serious act What is its end Your birth is noble your talents are great your expectations cannot be too high The happiness of your family is at stake the eye of the world is fixed upon you Love you own is but the creature of fancyYou would not marrya painter's daughter  Seym  Madam  Lady F  Look forward to the honours that are possible  Seym  I despise them  Lady F  Well then to the good you may effect the happiness you may diffuse  Seym  Ay that is a weighty thought  Lady F  A claim which mankind has upon you Disgrace your family destroy your peace and desert your duty It must not be  Seym  The motives indeed are powerful  Lady F  Think me interested and perhaps  am I scorn hypocrisy but if I speak truth consider and resolve  Exit  Seym  Why soThe warfare thickens and the battle ragesShe has a noble mindHer arguments are potentYet she knows not all Oh Paulina Must a sister or must thou be sacrificed Something must be done Yet every hour increases  stupefaction My mind confused my powers confounded I despise my own imbecility yet cannot shake it off Like

voice below now  Lady F  Aside  Why am I here Rivaled by an obscure unprotected indigent creature I Flattered and pursued as I have been for my beauty rank and riches and rivaled Thus rivaled too Dreading envying nay half hating a low born girl whom I have never seen Is it real Can I thus stoop and forget my better reason and my proud fortunes What miracle is she and what poor pitiable thing

been walking  Craig  Business Following my trade Doing as I was bid and signing a receipt in full with a bow a cringe and a humbly thank you sir I hope for your future custom No shopkeeper in England will serve you betterI have learned the whole trick of it  Seym  If you think labour an indignity you are wrong  Craig  What so much per dayWellNo matter But how has it happened that you the friend of my art have absented yourself for a whole week  Seym  Embarrassed  The expectationMy uncle was out of town  Craig  Is he returned  Seym  Yes  Craig  Well sir I applaud your dutiful attentionYour marriage then will soon take place  Paulina extremely alarmed  Seym  Confused  What marriage Who tells you  Craig  Oh The woman below a thousand idle gossips busy themselves in spreading reports that relate to persons of high life  Paulina's agitation increases  The union is spoken of with applause  Seym  Watching Paulina in the back ground  What union sir  Craig  With Lady Fancourt  Seym  But sirI assure youIt is notThat is I have never proposed such a marriage to her ladyship  Paulina relieved  Craig  Nay if you could not be happy far be it from me to wish for such an event  Seym  Then happy I nevér could be  Joy of PaulinaPause  But what subjects are you employed on at present  Craig  Various I have a picture I wish to shew you It still wants a few touches I have left it in the parlour Will you have the goodness to wait a moment  Exit  SCENE VII  PAULINA  runs to  SEYMOUR  Pau  My Seymour  Looking stedfastly for a moment then affectionately snatching his hand  My Seymour  Seym  My precious Paulina  Pau  How dost thou  Seym  Ill very ill  Pau  Alarmed  Ill  Seym  Wretched  Pau  What dost thou mean Seymour  PAUSE  Why dost thou look thus despondingly on meWhat is there in thy thoughtsSome dreadful secret sureSpeak Thy silence distracts me  Seym  Man is born for misery guilt perjury  Pau  With horror  Seymour  Seym  I have a sister young affectionate and noble minded as thyself  Pau  Well  Seym  But desolate ruined devoted to wretchedness unless  Pau  How can  Seym  Lady Fancourt  Pau  With a sudden cry of anguish  StopForbear  Falling on her knees and again seizing his hand  Thou art mine  With wild agony  Thou art mineCast thy eyes up to heaven remember what thou hast sworn remember who hath heard thee  With frantic fervour  By that divine that just that avenging essence whose immaculate name thou hast made thy pledge I will not survive thy falshood  Again with agony  Thou art mine Thou art mine  Rising  Why talk of surviving The maddening brain is murdered by the bare suspicion  SCENE VIII  Reenter  CRAIG  with the picture whose mind is so occupied through the scene by his picture that he does not attend to the agitation of Paulina and Seymour  Craig  Works addressed to the imagination are unworthy of praise unless they have some moral purpose The subject I have chosen will meet applause from you sir and all whose hearts and principles are equally generous and nobleIt is the progress of seduction beginning in perjury ending in suicide  Seym  Sir  Craig  Pleased  I knew it must incite terrorThis is but one of a series of picturesHere I have imagined  Seym  Perjury Here is a portrait of Paulina  Craig  YesPerhaps the partiality of a father led me to suppose the form and countenance of my Paulina miraculously adapted to my subjectBut observeThe scene is a cave  Pointing  an overhanging rock a gloomy forest in the back ground some broken lights and distances on the left and a deep gulph in front the heroine here here the confidante and here the only guardian they dared to trust a faithful mastiff Observe these traits Behold her with all her native candor and confidence  waiting for her expected lover and imagining all his superior qualities of soul while the godlike picture her fancy forms of him and his high deserts beams in her eyes and illuminates her countenanceHow shall I pourtray the agony of a heart so pure and unsuspecting when the fearful moment comes Is it not an interesting subject  Seym  A subject of terror Horror Madness  Craig  Quitting the picture  Yes madness is one of its principal featuresAfter depicting the dreadful conflict when she hears the perjured seducer is on the eve of marriage with another after shewing her in all the agonies of despair imploring at his feetperhaps at the feet of his mistress  Paulina appears to be suddenly struck at this moment with her father's thought which she must express in action and run precipitately out of the chamberdoor that leads to the street That this may be perceptible an interruption must be put to the Painter's description by the embarrassment of Seymour who after his exclamation turns away unable to sustain the anguish of mind he feels Craig wholly absorbed by his subject  Seym  Oh Insupportable  Craig  AyInsupportable indeed to a mind like yours even though but in imaginationWhat then will you feel when you shall behold a form so lovely so angelic and innocence so unsuspecting deprived of reason confined in a madhouse surrounded by miserable objects straw bread water and merciless keepers who vainly attempt with chains and scourges to expel frenzy  Seym  Peace  Craig  Mr Seymour  Seym  Silence I sayProceed no farther if you would not have me act the scenes you mean to paint  Craig  Alarmed  I meant  Seym  Forbear  Exit distractedly  Craig  It is strangeIs it imagination or  A knocking heard  Come in  SCENE IX  Enter Lady  LOUISA COMPTON  Lady L  Is your name Craig sir  Craig  It is madam  Lady L  Is your

beginMy business here sir excuse my frankness is if possible to gain the friendship of you and your daughter  Craig  Pausing  Your appearance speaks rank and the haughtiest of the hackneyed answers of politeness would be "Madam you do us honour" But II once wasNo matter I  am  a painter a worker in oilsbut no fawner Misfortune I  fear has made me a little peevish perhaps a little proud andFriendsI doubt we are not fitted to be friends  Lady L  Why notMr Seymour is my brother  Craig  IndeedThen you are a happy sister  Lady L  AhWe all have our sorrows I have mine You are above ceremonyI have a carriage waiting and a commission from Lady Fancourt an invitation to dine with us  Craig  MePardon me I must not be exhibited I know my distance and I will keep it No footman shall sneer over my

intruder Love  Craig  Disturbs the peace of most fathers but not mine Were the daughter of CamWere my daughter in love I should be her first confidant  Lady L  And are you then so little read in the human heart and its terrors especially the female heart  Craig  Alarmed  Do these questions point at me  Lady L  Be calm Tell me how would you act should a young man of rank demand your daughter's hand  Craig  Refuse him Not but Paulina might unblushingly have placed her stool beside the canopies of princes had not I her father been unjustly forced to handle brushes  Lady L  And is that a stain  Craig  Indelible So 'tis thought  Lady L  By prejudice and folly  Craig  Your brother is a youth of ten thousand I respect and love his virtues yet were even he to ask my Paulina he would meet a denial  Lady L  Sir  Craig  Shall I stand at humble distance in the presence of him by whom I ought to be treated with paternal respect and crouch and bend when it might become me to exert the influence of reason that I might prevent or redress error and thus meanly desert both duty and selfesteemThere are nobility of birth and nobility of heart the former but few enjoy the latter many a poor and many a neglected man in common with myself possess  Lady L  Well sir possessing that nobility the other is a trifling want  Craig  'Tis a want unknown to me I am  Lady L  Sir  Aside  One

dread Mr Campbell The prospect before us is terrific but we must onBe it as it will you shall share my fortunes  Lady L  Generous Charles  Exeunt  SCENE II  The Paintingroom  Sir  GREGORY  sitting to  CRAIG  for his portrait  Sir Greg  Then you think the men of former ages were guilty of as great vices as those of the present  Craig  Keep your mouth▪ shutGreater but they did not make a system of vice they were hurried into it by their passions Theirs were the crimes of men There is a disgraceful a contemptible meanness in the vices as well as the persons of  the present puny race and neither their passions nor their bodies have sufficient prowess to make them commit acts that can entitle them to respect  Sir Greg  Rises with animation  If they fight a duel it is not in the heat of anger and desire of revenge but it is done with as much ceremony and civility as if they were going to walk a minuet or sip a dish of tea ay and as little danger too for as they manage the matter there is ten times more terror in a crabtree cudgel than in lead and steel  Craig  Why as to the merit or virtue of fighting duels either in the old mode or the new I believe we had better not talk of that  Sir Greg  The vestiges of ancient independence are wearing away It makes my very heart ache to see the poor remains of towers that once defied the fury of tyrants and the war of elements lye mouldering in ruins  Craig  If we erect a building now it is in such a light frippery unsubstantial style that a pistol bullet would demolish it A castle of cobwebs spun in July and brushed away in November  Sir Greg  Sir you are a man of sense  Craig  And as to our commerce we have poisoned the people with our teas spices and spirits We send to China for pipkins to Hudson's Bay for cat's skins to Venice for window alias vice blinds and to Leghorn for toothpicks and fiddlestrings and that the lower part of the community may not have the power to reproach and despise their leaders vice disease and destruction are imported in ship loads and parceled out in pennyworths  Sir Greg  Sir your conversation pleases me Hem When will your daughter be within  Craig  Presently presently  Sir Greg  I should be glad to see if she be as handsome as you have painted her  Craig  Painted Where are the colours that can equal Paulina  Sir Greg  Hay Is her name Paulina  Craig  Certainly Why not

whimsical old fellow  Sir Greg  Listening and suspecting  HayNoNothingIf ever you should meet me in the street take no notice of me  Craig  Notice you Sir I notice no man who is unwilling to notice me  A loud rapping at the street door  Sir Greg  Oh the devilWho's thereQuick Quick My hat and cloak  Craig  Does he think I am his footman  Sir Greg  I would not be seen for a thousand pounds Can't you
