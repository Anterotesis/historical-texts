Fifth Edition Corrected  LONDON  Printed for  James Knapton  at the  Crown  in St  Paul  's Churchyard  To the Right Honourable  Charles Mountague  Esq  President of the Royal Society One of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury  c  SIR  MAY it please you to pardon the Boldness of a Stranger to your Person if upon the encouragement of Common Fame he presumes so much upon your Can∣dor as to lay before you this Account of his Travels As the Scene of them is not only Remote but for the most part little fre∣quented also so there may be some things in them new even to you and some possibly not altogether unuseful to the Publick And that just Veneration which the World pays as to your General Worth so especially to that Zeal for the advancement of Knowledge and the Interest of your Country which you express upon all occasions gives you a particular Right to whatever may any way tend to the promoting these Interests as an Offering due to your Merit I have not so much of the vanity of a Traveller as to be fond of telling Stories especially of this  kind nor can I think this plain piece of mine deserves a place among your more Curious Collections much less have I the Arrogance to use your Name by way of Pa∣tronage for the too obvious faults both of the Author and the Work Yet dare I avow according to my narrow sphere and poor abilities a hearty Zeal for the promoting of useful knowledge and of any thing that may never so remotely tend to my Countries advantage And I must own that Ambition of transmitting to the publick through your hands these Essays I have made toward those great ends of which you are so de∣servedly esteemed the Patron This hath been my design in this publication being desirous to bring in my Gleaning here and there in Remote Regions to that general Magazine of the knowledge of Foreign Parts which the  Royal Society  thought you most worthy the Custody of when they chose you for their  President  and if in perusing these Papers your Goodness shall so far di∣stinguish the Experience of the Author from his Faults as to judge him capable of serving his Country either immediately or by serv∣ing you he will endeavour by some real proofs to shew himself  SIR  Your Most Faithful Devoted Humble Servant  W Dampier  THE PREFACE  BEfore the Reader proceed any further in the perusal of this Work I must bespeak a little of his Patience here to take along with him this short ac∣count of it It is composed of a mixt relation of Places and Actions In the same order of time in which they occurred for which end I kept a Journal of every days Observation  In the description of Places their Product  c  I have endeavoured to give what satisfaction I could to my Countrymen tho possibly with the describing se∣veral things that may have been much better account∣ed for by others Choosing to be more particular than might be needful with respect to the intelligent Reader rather than to omit what I thought might tend to the information of persons no less sensible and inquisitive tho not so Learned or Experienced For which reason my chief care hath been to be as particular as war consistent with my intended brevity insetting down such Observables as I met with Nor have I given my self any great trouble since my return to compare my discoveries with those of others The rather because should it so happen that I have described some places or things which others have done before me yet i  different accounts even of the same things it canhardly be but there will be some new light afforded by each of  But after all considering that the main of this Voyage hath its Scene laid in long Tracts of the Re¦moter parts hath of the  East  and  West Indies  some  of which very seldom visited by  English  men and o∣thers as rarely by any  Europeans  I may without vani∣ty encourage the Reader to expect many things wholly new to him and many others more fully describ'd than be may have seen elsewhere for which not only this Voyage tho it self of many years continuance but also several former long and distant ones have qualified me  As for the Actions of the Company among whom I made the greatest part of this Voyage a Thread of which I have carried on thro it 'tis not to divert the Reader with them that I mention them much less that I take any pleasure in relating them but for methods sake and for the Readers satisfaction who could not so well acquiesce in my description of Places  c  without knowing the particular Traverses I made among them nor in these without an account of the Concomitant Circumstances Besides that I would not prejudice the truth and sincerity of my Relation tho by omissions only And as for the Traverses themselves they make for the Readers advantage how little so∣ever sor mine since thereby I have been the better enabled to gratify his Curiosity as one who rambles about a Country can give usually a better account of it than a Carrier who jogs on to his Inn without ever going out of his Road  As to my Stile it cannot be expected that a Seaman should affect Politeness for were I able to do it yet I think I should be little sollicitous about it in a work of this Nature I have frequently indeed divested my self of Sea Phrases to gratify the Land Reader for which the Seamen will hardly forgive me And yet pos∣sibly I shall not seem Complaisant enough to the other because I still retain the use of so many Sea terms I consess I have not been at all scrupulous in this mat∣ter either as to the one or the other of these for I am perswaded that if what I say be intellig  matters not greatly in what words it is express'd  For the same reason I have not been curious art  the spelling of the Names of Places Plants Fruits Animals  c  which in many of the remoter parts are given at the pleasure of Travellers and vary ac∣cording to their different Humours Neither have I confined my self to such Names as are given by Learned Authors or so much as enquired after many of them I write for my Countrymen and have there∣fore for the most part used such Names as are fami¦liar to our  English  Seamen and those of our Colonies abroad yet without neglecting others that occurr'd As it may suffice me to have given such Names and De∣scriptions as I could I shall leave to those of more leisure and opportunity the trouble of comparing them with those which other Authors have assigned  The Reader will find as he goes along some Re∣ferences to an Appendix which I once designed to this Book as to a Chapter about the Winds in di  ∣ferent parts of the World to a description of the Bay of  Campeachy  in the  West Indies  where I lived long in a former Voyage and to a particular Chorogra∣phical description of all the  South Sea  Coast of  America  partly from a  Spanish MSS  and partly from my own and other Travellers Observations beside those con∣tained in this Book But such an Appendix would have swelled it too unreasonably and therefore I chose rather to publish it hereafter by its self as op∣portunity shall serve And the same must be said a  so to a particular Voyage from  Achin  in the Isle of  Sumatra  to  Tonquin Malacca  c which should have been inserted as part of this General one but it would have been too long and therefore omitting it for the present I have carried on this next way from  Sumatra  to  England  and so made the  Tour  of the  World  correspondent to the  Title  For the better apprehending the Course of the Voyage and the Situation of the Places mentioned in it I have caused several Maps to be engraven  and some particular Draughts of my own Composure A∣mong them there is in the Map of the  American Isth∣mus  a new Scheme of the adjoining Bay of  Panama  and its Islands which to some may seem superfluous after that which Mr  Ringrose  hath published in the History of the  Buccaneers  and which he offers as a very exact Draught I must needs disagree with him in that and doubt not but this which I here publish will be found more agreeable to that Bay by any who shall have opportunity to examine it for it is a contraction of a larger Map which I took from several Stations in the Bay it self The Reader may judge how well I was able to do it by my several Traverses a∣bout it mentioned in this Book those particularly which are described in the th Chapter which I have caused to be marked out with a pricked Line as the Course of my Voyage is generally in all the Maps for the Readers more easy tracing it  I have nothing more to add but that there are here and there some mistakes made as to expression and the like which will need a favourable Correction as they occur up∣on reading For instance the Log of Wood lying out at some distance from the sides of the Boats described at  Guam  and parallel to their Keel which for distinctions sake I have called the little Boat  might more clearly and properly have been called the side Log or by some such name for though f  ned at the bottom and ends Boat∣wise yet is not hollow at top but solid throughout In other places also I may not have ex  ress'd my self so fully as I ought but any considerable Omissi  n that I shall recollect or be informed of I shall endeavour to make it up in those Accounts I have yet to publish and for any faults I leave the Reader to the j  int use of his Judgment and Candour  THE

America  in∣to the  South Seas  His coasting along  Peru  and  Chili  and back again to his parting with Captain  Sharp  near the Isle of  Plata  in order to return over Land  I First set out of  England  on this Voyage at the beginning of the year  in the  Loyal Mer∣chant of  for  Jamaica  Captain  Knap∣man  Commander I went a Passenger designing when I came thither to go from thence to the Bay of  Campeachy  in the Gulph of  Mexico  to cut Logwood where in a former Voyage I had spent about three years in that employ and so was well accquainted with the place and the work  We sailed with a prosperous gale without any impediment or remarkable passage in our Voyage unless that when we came in sight of the Island  Hispaniola  and were coasting along on the South side of it by the little Isles of  Vacca  or  Ash  I observed Captain  Knapman  was more vigilant than ordinary keeping at a good distance off shoar for fear of coming too near those small low slands as he did once in a Voyage from  England  about the year losing his Ship there by the care∣lessness of his Mates But we succeeded better and arrived safe at  Port Royol  in  Jamaica  some time in  April  and went immediately ashoar  I had brought some goods with me from  England  which I intended to sell here and stock my self with Rum and Sugar Saws Axes Hats Stock∣ings Shoes and such other Commodities as I knew would sell among the  Campeachy  Logwood∣cutters Accordingly I sold my  English  Cargo at  Port Royal  but upon some maturer considerations of my intended Voyage to  Campeachy  I changed my thoughts of that design and continued at  Ja∣maica  all that year in expectation of some other business  I shall not trouble the Reader with my Obser∣vations at that Isle so well known to  English  men nor with the particulars of my own Affairs during my stay there But in short having there made a purchase of a small Estate in  Dorsetshire  near my Native Country of  Somerset  of one whose Title of  it I was well assured of I was just embarking my self for  England  about  Christmas  when one Mr  Hobby  invited me to go first a short Trading Voyage to the Country of the  Moskito's  of whom I shall speak in my first Chapter I was willing to get up some Money before my return having laid out what I had at  Jamaica  so I sent the VVriting of my new Purchase along with the same Friends whom I should have accompanied to  England  and went on board Mr  Hobby  Soon after our setting out we came to an anchor again in  Negril  Bay at the West end of  Jamaica  but finding there Captain  Soxon Sawkings Sharp  and other Privateers Mr  Hobby  's men all left him to go with them upon an expedition they had contrived leaving not one with him beside my self and being thus left alone after or days stay with Mr  Hobby  I was the more easily perswaded to go with them too  It was shortly after  Christmas  when we set out The first expedition was to  Portobel  which being accomplished it was resolved to march by Land over the Isthmus of  Darien  upon some new Adventures in the  South Seas  Accordingly on the th of  April  we went ashoar on the Isthumus near  Golden Island  one of the  Sambaloes  to the number of between and men carrying with us such Provisions as were necessary and Toys wherewith to gratify the  Wild Indians  through whose Country we were to pass In about nine days march we arrived at  Santa Maria  and took it and after a stay there of about three days we went on to the  South Sea  Coast and there embarked our selves in such Canoas and Periago's as our  Indian  friends furnished us withal We were in sight of  Panama  by the d of  April  and having in vain attempted  Puebla Nova  before which  Sawkings  then Commander in chief and others were killed we made some stay at the Neighbouring Isles of  Quibo  Here we resolved to change our course and stand away to the Southward of the Coast of  Peru  Accordingly we left the Keys or Isles of  Quibo  the th of  June  and spent the rest of the year in that Southern course for touching at the Isles of  Gorgonia  and  Plata  we came to  Ylo  a small Town on the Coast of  Peru  and took it This was in  October  and in  November  we went thence to  Coquimbo  on the same Coast and about  Christ∣mas  were got as far as the Isle of  John Fernando  which was the farthest of our Course to the South∣ward  After  Christmas  we went back again to the Northward having a design upon  Arica  a strong Town advantageously situated in the hollow of the Elbow or bending of the  Peruviam  Coast But being there repulsed with great loss we con∣tinued our course Northward till by the middle of  April  we were come in sight of the Isle of  Plata  a little Southward to the Equinoxial Line  I have related this part of my Voyage thus sum∣marily and concisely as well because the World hath accounts of it already in the relations that Mr  Ringrose  and others have given of Capt  Sharp  's Expedition who was made chief Commander upon  Sawking  's being killed as also because in the prosecution of this Voyage I shall come to speak of these parts again upon occasion of my going the second time into the  South Seas  and shall there describe at large the places both of the  North  and  South America  as they occurred to me And for this reason that I might  ¦void needless Repetitions and hasten to such particulars as the Publick hath hitherto had no account of I have chosen to comprize the  Relation of my Voyage hitherto in this short compass and place it as an Introduction before the rest that the Reader may the better per∣ceive where I mean to begin to be particular for there I have placed the Title of my first Chap∣ter  All therefore that I have to add to the Intro∣duction is this That while we lay at the Isle of  John Fernando  Captain  Sharp  was by general consent displaced from being Commander the Company being not satisfied either with his Cou∣rage or Behaviour In his stead Captain  Watling  was advanced but he being killed shortly after before  Arica  we were without a Commander du∣ring all the rest of our return towards  Plata  Now  Watling  being killed a great number of the mean∣er sort began to be as earnest for choosing Captain  Sharp  again into the vacancy as before they had been as forward as any to turn him out And on the other side the abler and more expe∣rienced men being altogether dissatisfied with  Sharp  's former Conduct would by no means con∣sent to have him chosen In short by that time we were come in sight of the Island  Plata  the difference between the contending Parties was grown so high that they resolved to part Compa∣nies having first made an Agreement that which Party soever should upon Polling appear to have the majority they should keep the Ship And the other should content themselves with the Launch or Longboat and Canoas and return back over the Isthmus or go to seek their fortune other ways as they would  Accordingly we put it to the Vote and upon dividing Captain  Sharp  's party carried it I who had never been pleased with his management tho I had hitherto kept my mind to my self now de∣clared my self on the side of those that were Out∣voted and according to our agreement we took our shares of such Necessaries as were fit to carry over Land with us for that was our Resolution and so prepared for our Departure  map of the

I  An Account of the Authors Return out of the  South Sea  to his Landing near  Cape St Lawrence  in the Isthmus of  Darien  With an Occasional Descrip∣tion of the  Moskito Indians  APril  the th about Ten a Clock in the morning being Leagues N W from the Island  Plata  we left Captain  Sharp  and those who were willing to go with him in the Ship and embarked into our Lanch and Ca∣noas designing for the River of  Santa Maria  in the Gulph of  St Michael  which is about leagues from the Isle of  Plata  We were in number white Men who bore Arms a  Spanish Indian  who bore Arms also and two  Moskito Indians  who al∣ways  bear Arms amongst the Privateers and are much valued by them for striking Fish and Turtle or Tortoise and Manatee or Sea Cow and five Slaves taken in the South Sas who fell to our share  The Craft which carried us was a Lanch or Long Boat one Canoa and another Canoa which had been sawn asunder in the middle in order to have made Bumkins or Vessels for carrying water if we had not separated from our Ship This we joyn'd to∣gether again and made it tight providing Sails to help us along And for days before we parted we sifted so much Flower as we could well carry and rubb'd up or pound of Chocolate with Sugar to sweeten it these things and a Kettle the Slaves carried also on their backs after we landed And because there were some who designed to go with us that we knew were not well able to march we gave out that if any man faultred in the Journey over Land he must expect to be shot to death for we knew that the  Spaniards  would soon b  after us and one man falling into their hands might be the ruin of us all by giving an account of our strength and condition yet this would not de'er 'em from going with us We had but little Wind when we parted from the Ship but before a clock the Seabreeze came in strong which was like to founder us before we got in with the shore for our security therefore we cut up an old dry Hide that we brought with us and barricadoed the Lanch all round with it to keep the water out About a clock at night we got in about leagues to wind∣ward of Cape  Passao  under the  Line  and then it proved calm and we lay and drove all night be∣ing fatigued the preceeding day The th day we had little wind till the afternoon and then we made sail standing along the shore to the Northward having the wind at S S W and fair wea∣ther  At a clock we came abrest of Cape  Passao  and found a small Bark at an Anchor in a small Bay to Leeward of the Cape which we took our own Boats being too small to transport us We took her just under the Equinoctial Line she was not only a help to us but in taking her we were safe from being described we did not design to have meddled with any when we parted with our consorts nor to have seen any if we could have helped it The Bark came from  Gallio  laden with Timber and was bound for  Guiaquil  The th day in the morning we came to an an∣chor about leagues to the Southward of Cape  St Francisco  to put our new Bark into a better trim In or hours time we finished our business and came to sail again and steered along the Coast with the Wind at S S W intending to touch at  Gorgonia  Being to the Northward of Cape  St Francisco  we met with very wet weather but the Wind conti∣nuing we arrived at  Gorgonia  the th day in the morning before it was light we were afraid to approach it in the day time for fear the  Spaniards  should lie there for us it being the place where we careened lately and where they might expect us  When we came ashore we found the  Spaniards  had been there to seek after us by a House they had built which would entertain Men and by a great Cross before the Doors This was token e∣nough that the  Spaniards  did expect us this day a∣gain therefore we examined our Prisoners if they knew any thing of it who confessed they had heard of a Pereago or a large Canoa that row'd with Oars which was kept on the River on the Main and once in or days came over to  Gor∣gonia  purposely to see for us and that having dis∣covered us she was to make all speed to  Panama  with the News where they had Ships ready to send after us  We lay here all the day and scrubb'd our new Bark that if ever we should be chased we might the better escape we filled our Water and in the evening went from thence having the Wind at S W a brisk gale  The th day we had much Wind and Rain and we lost the Canoa that had been cut and was join∣ed together we would have kept all our Canoas to carry us up the River the Bark not being so convenient  The th day we went from thence with a mo∣derate gale of Wind at S W In the afternoon we had excessive showers of Rain  The th day was very wet all the morning be∣twixt or it cleared up and we saw two great Ships about a league and half to the West∣ward of us we being then two leagues from the shore and about leagues to the Southward of point  Garrachina  These Ships had been cruising between  Gorgonia  and the Gulf months but whe∣ther our Prisoners did know it I cannot tell  We presently furled our Sails and rowed in close under the shore knowing that they were Cruisers for if they had been bound to  Panama  this Wind would have carried them thither and no Ships bound from  Panama  come on this side the Bay but keep the North side of the Bay till as far as the Keys of  Quibo  to the Westward and then if they are bound to the Southward they stand over and  ay setch  Gallco  or betwixt it and Cape  St Francisco  The Glare did not continue long before it rained again and kept us from the sight of each other but if they had seen and chaced us we were resol∣ved to run our Bark and Canoas ashore and take our selves to the Mountains and travel over Land for we knew that the  Indians  which lived in these parts never had any Commerce with the  Spaniards  so we might have had a chance for our Lives  The th day at a clock in the morning we came to an Anchor at Point  Garrachina  about leagues from the Gulph of  St Michael  which was the place were we first come into the South Seas and the way by which we designed to return  Here we lay all the day and went ashore and dried our Cloaths clean'd our Guns dried our Am∣munition and fixt our selves against our Enemies if we should be attack'd for we did expect to find some opposition at Landing we likewise kept a good Lookout all the day for fear of those two Ships they saw the day before  The th day in the morning at a Clock we came into the Gulf of  St Michael  's mouth for we put from Point  Garrachina  in the Evening design∣ing to have reach'd the Islands in the Gulf before day that we might the better work our escape from our Enemies if we should find any of them waiting to stop our passage  About a clock we came to an Anchor a mile without a large Island which lies miles from the mouth of the River we had other small Islands without us and might have gone up into the Ri∣ver having a strong tyde of flood but would not adventure farther till we had lookt well about us  We immediately sent a Canoa ashoar on the Island where we saw what we always feared a Ship at the mouth of the River lying close by the shore and a large Tent by it by which we found it would be a hard task for us to escape them  When the Canoa came aboard with this news some of our men were a little disheartned but it was no more than I ever expected  Our care was now to get safe over land seeing we could not land here according to our desire Therefore before the Tyde of flood was spent we manned our Canoa and rowed again to the Island to see if the Enemy was yet in motion When we  came ashoar we dispersed our selves all over th  Island to prevent our Enemies from coming any way to view us and presently after highwater we saw a small Canoa coming over from the Ship to the Island that we were on which made us all get into our Canoa and wait their coming and we lay close till they came within Pistolshot of us and then being ready we started out and took them there were in her one white man and two  Indians  who being examined told us that the Ship which we saw at the Rivers mouth had lain there six months guarding the River waiting for our coming that she had Guns and Seamen and Souldiers that the Seamen all lay aboard but the Souldiers lay ashore in their Tents that there were men in the Mines who had all small Arms and would be abroad in two Tydes time they likewise told us that there were two Ships cruising in the Bay between this place and  Gorgonia  the biggest had Guns and Men the other Guns and Men Besides all this they told us that the  Indians  on this side the Coun∣try were our Enemies which was the worst news of all However we presently brought these Pri∣soners aboard and got under sail turning out with the Tyde of Ebb for it was not convenient to stay longer there  We did not long consider what to do but in∣tended to land that night or the next day betimes for we did not question but we should either get a good commerce with the  Indians  by such toys as we had purposely brought with us or else force our way through their Country in spight of all their opposition and we did not fear what these  Spaniards  could do against us in case they should land and come after us We had a strong Souther∣ly Wind which blew right in and the Tyde of Ebb being far spent we could not turn out  I perswaded them to run into the River of  Congo  which is a large River about three leagues from the Islands where we lay which with a Southerly Wind we could have done and when we were got so high as the Tide flows then we might have landed But all the arguments I could use were not of force sufficient to convince them that there was a large River so near us but they would land somewhere they neither did know how where nor when  When we had rowed and towed against the wind all night we just got about Cape  St Lorenzo  in the morning and sailed about miles farther to the Westward and run into a small Creek with∣in two Keys or little Islands and rowed up to the head of the Creek being about a mile up and there we landed  May    We got out all our Provision and Cloaths and then sunk our Vessel  While we were landing and fixing our Snap∣sacks to march our  Moskito Indians  struck a plen∣tiful dish of Fish which we immediately drest and therewith satisfied our hunger  Having made mention of the  Moskito Indians  it may not be amiss to conclude this Chapter with a short account of them They are tall well made raw boned lusty strong and nimble of foot long visaged lank black hair look stern hard fa∣voured and of a dark Coppercolour Complexion They are but a small Nation or Family and not men of them in number inhabiting on the Main on the North side near Cape  Gratia Dios  between Cape  Honduras  and  Nicaragua  They are very ingenious at throwing the Lance Fisgig Har∣poon or any manner of Dart being bred to it from their Infancy for the Children imitating their Pa∣rents never go abroad without a Lance in their hands which they throw at any object till use hath  made them masters of the Art Then they learn to put by a Lance Arrow or Dart the manner is thus Two Boys stand at a small distance and Dart a blunt stick at one another each of them holding a small stick in his right hand with which he strikes away that which was darted at him As they grow in years they become more dexterous and courageous and then they will stand a fair mark to any one that will shoot Arrows at them which they will put by with a very small stick no bigger than the rod of a Fowlingpiece and when they are grown to be men they will guard them∣selves from Arrows tho they come very thick at them provided two do not happen to come at once They have extraordinary good Eyes and will discry a Sail at Sea farther and see any thing better than we Their chiefest Employment in their own Country is to strike Fish Turtle or Manatee the manner of which I describe else∣where Chap For this they are esteemed and co∣veted by all Privateers for one or two of them in a Ship will maintain men So that when we careen our Ships we choose commonly such places where there is plenty of Turtle or Manatee for these  Mos∣kito  men to strike and it is very rare to find Pri∣vateers destitute of one or more of them when the Commander or most os the men are  English  but they do not love the  French  and the  Spaniards  they hate mortally When they come among Pri∣vateers they get the use of Guns and prove very good Marksmen They behave themselvis very bold in fight and never seem to flinch nor hang back for they think that the white men with whom they are know better than they do when it is best to fight and let the disadvantage of their party be never so great they will never yield not give back while any of their party stand I could never perceive any Religion nor any Ceremonies  or superstitious Observations among them being ready to imitate us in whatsoever they saw us do at any time Only they seem to fear the Devil whom they call  Wallesaw  and they say he often appears to some among them whom our men commonly call their Priests when they desire to speak with him on urgent business but the rest know not any thing of him nor how he appears otherwise than as these Priests tell them Yet they all say they must not anger him for then he will beat them and that sometimes he carries away these their Priests Thus much I have heard from some of them who speak good  English  They marry but one Wife with whom they live till death seperates them At their first coming to∣gether the man makes a very small Plantation for there is Land enough and they may choose what spot they please They delight to settle near the Sea or by some River for the sake of striking Fish their beloved Employment  Far within Land there are other  Indians  with whom they are always at War After the man hath cleared a spot of Land and hath planted it he seldom minds it afterward but leaves the ma∣naging of it to his Wife and he goes out a striking Sometimes he seeks only for Fish at other times for Turtle or Manatee and whatever he gets he brings home to his Wife and never stirs out to seek for more till it is all eaten When hunger begins to bite he either takes his Canoa and s  s for more game at Sea or walks out into the Woods and hunts about for Peccary Warree each a sort of wild Hogs or Dear and seldom returns empty handed nor seeks for any more so long as any of it lasts Their Plantations are so small that they cannot subsist with what they produce for their largest Plantations have not above or Plan∣tainTrees a bed of Yams and Potatoes a bush  of  Indian  Pepper and a small spot of Pineapples which last fruit is a main thing they delight in for with these they make a sort of drink which our men call Pinedrink much esteemed by these  Mos∣kito  's and to which they invite each other to be merry providing Fish and Flesh also Whoever of them makes of this Liquor treats his Neighbours making a little Canoa full at a time and so enough to make them all drunk and it is seldom that such Feasts are made but the party that makes them hath some design either to be revenged for some injury done him or to debate of such differences as have happened between him and his Neighbours and to examin into the truth of such Matters Yet before they are warmed with drink they never speak one word of their grievances and the Wo∣men who commonly know their Husbands designs prevent them from doing any injury to each other by hiding their Lances Harpoons Bows and Ar∣rows or any other weapon that they have  These  Moskito  's are in general very civil and kind to the  English  of whom they receive a great deal os respect both when they are aboard their Ships and also ashore either in  Jamaica  or else∣where whither they often come with the Seamen We always humour them letting them go any where as they will and return to their Country in any Vessel bound that way if they please They will have the management of themselves in their striking and will go in their own little Canoa which our men could not go in without danger of eversetting nor will they then let any white man come into their Canoa but will go a striking in it just as they please All which they allow them For should we cross them tho they should see Shoals of Fish or Turtle or the like they will purposely stride their Harpoons and Turtle irons aside or so glance them as to kill nothing They have no form  of Government among them but acknowledge the King of  England  for their Soveraign They learn our Language and take the Governour of  Ja∣maica  to be one of the greatest Princes in the World  While they are among the  English  they wear good Cloaths and take delight to go neat and tight but when they return again to their own Country they put by all their Cloaths and go after their own Country fashion wearing only a small piece of Linnen tyed about their wastes hanging down to their knees  CHAP II  The Author's  Land Journey  from the  South  to the  North Sea  over the  Terra Firma  or Isthmus of  Darien  BEing landed  May  the st we began our march about a Clock in the afternoon directing our course by our Pocket Compasses N E and having gone about miles we came to the foot of a Hill where we built small Huts and lay all night having excessive Rains till a Clock  The d day in the morning having sair weather we ascended the Hill and found a small  Indian  path which we followed till we found it ran too much Easterly and then doubting it would carry us out of our way we climb'd some of the highest Trees on the Hill which was not meanly furnished with as large tall Trees as ever I saw At length we discovered some Houses in a Valley on the North side of the Hill but it being steep could  not descend on that side but followed the small path which led us down the Hill on the East side where we presently found several other  Indian  Houses The first that we came to at the foot of the Hill had none but women at home who could not speak  Spanish  but gave each of us a good Cala∣bash or Shell full of Corndrink The other Houses had some men at home but none that spoke  Spa∣nish  yet we made shift to buy such food as their Houses or Plantations afforded which we drest and eat altogether having all sorts of our Provi∣sion in common because none should live better than others or pay dearer for any thing than it was worth This day we had marched mile  In the evening the Husbands of those women came home and told us in broken  Spanish  that they had been on board of the Guard Ship which we fled from two days before that we were now not above mile from the mouth of the River  Congo  and that they could go from thence aboard the Guard Ship in half a Tydes time  This evening we supped plentifully on Fowls and Pecary a sort of wild Hogs which we bought of the  Indins  Yams Potatoes and Plantains served us for Bread whereof we had enough After Sup∣per we agreed with one of these  Indians  to guide us a days march into the Country towards the North side he was to have for his pains a Hatchet and his bargain was to bring us to a certain  Indians  ha∣bitation who could speak  Spanish  from whom we were in hopes to be better satisfied of our Journey  The d day having fair weather we began to stir betimes and set out batween nd a clock marching through several old ruined Plantations This morning one of our men being tired gave us the slip By a Clock we had gone mile and arrived at the  Indians  house who lived on the bank of the River  Congo  and spoke very good  Spanish  to  hom we declared the reason of this visit  At first he seemed to be very dubious of enter∣  ining any discourse with us and gave very im∣  ertinent answers to the questions that we demand∣  d of him he told us he knew no way to the North side of the Country he could carry us to  Cheapo  or  Santa Maria  which we knew to be  Spa∣nish  Garrisons the one lying to the Eastward of us the other to the Westward either of them at least miles out of our way We could get no o∣ther answer from him and all his discourse was in such an angry tone as plainly declared he was not our friend However we were forced to make a virtue of necessity and humour him for it was neither time nor place to be angry with the  Indians  all our lives lying in their hands  We were now at a great loss not knowing what course to take for we tempted him with Beads Money Hatchets Macheats or long Knives but nothing would work on him till one of our men took a Skycoloured Petticoat out of his bag and put it on his Wife who was so much pleased with the Present that she immediately began to chatter at her Husband and soon brought him into a better humour He could then tells us he knew the way to the North side and would have gone with us but that he cut his foot days before which made him uncapable of serving us himself But he would take care that we should not want a guide and therefore he hired the same  Indian  who brought us hither to conduct us days march further for another Hatchet The old man would have stayed us here all the day because it rained very hard but our business required more haste our Enemies lying so near us for he told us that he could go from his house aboard the GuardShip in a Tydes time and this was the th day since they saw us so we marched mile farther  and then built Hutts where we stayed all night it rained all the afternoon and greatest part of the night  The th day we began our march betimes for the forenoons were commonly fair but much rain afternoon tho whether it rained or shined it was much at one with us for I verily believe we crost the Rivers times this day the  Indians  having no paths to travel from one part of the Country to another and therefore guided themselves by the Rivers We marched this day miles and then built our Hutts and lay down to sleep but we al∣ways kept two men on the watch otherwise our own Slaves might have knockt us on the head while we slept It rained violently all the afternoon and most part of the night We had much ado to kindle a fire this evening our Hutts were but very mean and ordinary and our fire small so that we could not dry our Cloaths scarce warm our selves and no sort of food for the Belly all which made it very hard with us I confess these hardships quite expell'd the thoughts of an Enemy for now having been days in the Country we began to have but few other cares than how to get Guides and Food the  Spaniards  were seldom in our thoughts  The th day we set out in the morning betimes and having travell'd miles in those wild pathless Woods by a clock in the morning we arrived at a young  Spanish Indian  's House who had former∣ly lived with the Bishop of  Panama  The young  Indian  was very brisk spoke very good  Spanish  and received us very kindly This Plantation afforded us store of Provision Yams and Potaroes but no∣thing of any flesh beside fat Monkeys we shot part whereof we distributed to some of our Com∣pany who were weak and sickly for others we got Eggs and such refreshments as the  Indians  had for we still provided for the sick and weak We  had a  Spanish Indian  in our company who first took up Arms with Captain  Sawkins  and had been with us ever since his death He was perswaded to live here by the master of the house who promised him his Sister in marriage and to be assistant to him in clearing a Plantation but we would not consent to part ftom him here for fear of some treachery but promised to release him in two or three days when we were certainly out of danger of our Enemies We stayed here all the Afternoon and dryed our Cloaths and Ammunition cleared our Guns and provided ourselves for a march the next morning  Our Chyrurgeon Mr  Waser  came to a sad dis∣aster here being drying his Powder a careless fel∣low passed by with his Pipe lighted and set fire to his Powder which blew up and scorch'd his Knee and reduced him to that condition that he was not able to march wherefore we allowed him a Slave to carry his things being all of us the more concern'd at the accident because lyable our selves every moment to misfortune and none to look after us but him This  Indian  Plantation was seated on the bank of the River  Congo  in a very fat Soyl and thus far we might have come in our Canoa if I could have perswaded them to it  The th day we set out again having hired ano∣ther guide Here we first crost the River  Congo  in a Canoa having been from our first Landing on the West side of the River and being over we march∣ed to the Eastward mile and came to another River which we forded several times though it was very deep Two of our men were not able to keep company with us but came after us as they were able The last time we forded the River it was so deep that our tallest men stood in the deep∣est place and handed the sick weak and short men by which means we all got over safe ex∣cept  those two who were behind Foreseeing a necessity of wading through Rivers frequently in our Landmarch I took care before I left the Ship to provide my self a large Joint of Bambo which I stopt at both ends closing it with Wax so as to keep out any Water In this I preserved my Jour∣nal and other Writings from being wet tho I was often forced to swim When we were over this River we sat down to wait the coming of our Consorts who were left behind and in half an hour they came But the River by that time was so high that they could not get over it neither could we help them over but bid them be of good comfort and stay till the River did fall But we marched mile farther by the side of the River and there built our Hutts having gone this day miles We had scarce finished our Hutts before the River rose much higher and overflowing the Banks obliged us to remove into higher ground But the next night came on before we could build more Hutts so we lay straggling in the Woods some under one Tree some under another as we could find conveniency which might have been in∣different comfortable if the weather had been fair but the greatest part of the night we had extraor∣dinary hard Rain with much Lightening and terri∣ble claps of Thunder These hardships and incon∣veniencies made us all careless and there was no Watch kept tho I believe no body did sleep So our Slaves taking opportunity went away in the night all but one who was hid in some hole and knew nothing of their design or else fell asleep Those that went away carried with them our Chy∣rurgeons Gun and all his Money  The next morning being the th day we went to the Rivers side and found it much fallen and here our Guide would have us ford it again which being deep and the current running swift we could  not Then we contrived to swim over those that could not swim we were resolved to help over as well as we could But this was not feizable for we should not be able to get all our things over At length we concluded to send one man over with a Line who should hale over all our things first and then get the men over This be∣ing agreed on one  George Gayny  took the end of a Line and made it fast about his neck and left the other end ashore and one man stood by the Line to clear it away to him But when  Gayny  was in the midst of the water the Line in drawing after him chanc'd to kink or grow entangled and he that stood by to clear it away stopt the Line which turned  Gayny  on his back and he that had the Line in his hand threw it all into the River after him thinking he might recover himself but the stream running very swift and the man having three hundred Dollars at his back was carried down and never seen more by us Those two men whom we left behind the day before told us afterwards that they found him lying dead in a Creek where the Eddy had driven him ashore and the Money on his back but they meddled not with any of it being only in care how to work their way thro a wild unknown Country This put a period to that contrivance This was the fourth man that we lost in this Land Journey for those two men that we left the day before did not come to us till we were in the  North Seas  so we yielded them also for lost Being frustrated of getting over the River this way we lookt about for a Tree to fell across the River At length we found one which we cut down and it reached clear over on this we passed to the other side where we found a small Planta inwalk which we soon ransackt  While we were busy getting Plantains our Guide was gone but in less than two hours came to us  again and brought with him an old  Indian  to whom he delivered up his charge and we gave him a Hatchet and dismist him and entred our selves under the conduct of our new Guide who imme∣diately led us away and crost another River and enter'd into a large Valley of the fattest Land I did ever take notice of the Trees were not very thick but the largest that I saw in my Travels we saw great tracks which were made by the Pecaries but saw none of'em We marched in this pleasantCoun∣try till a Clock in the afternoon in all about Miles and then arrived at the old man's Countryhouse which was only a Habitation for Hunting there was a small Plantain walk some Yams and Potatoes Here we took up our quarters for this day and refreshed our selves with such food as the place afforded and dryed our Cloaths and Ammu∣nition At this place our  Indian  provided to leave us for now we thought our selves past danger This was he that was perswaded to stay at the last House we came from to marry the young man's Sister and we dismiss'd him according to our pro∣mise  The th day the old man conducted us towards his own habitation We marched about miles in this Valley and then ascended a Hill and travel led about miles farther over two or three small Hills before we came to any settlement Half a mile before we came to the Plantations we light of a path which carried us to the  Indians  habitation We saw many wooden Crosses erected in the way which created some jealousy in us that here were some  Spaniards  Therefore we new primed all our Guns and provided our selves for an Enemy but coming into the Town found none but  Indians  who were all got together in a large house to receive us for the old man had a little boy with him that he sent before  They made us welcome to such as they had which was very mean for these were new Planta∣tions the Corn being not eared Potatoes Yams and Plantains they had none but what they brought from their old Plantations There was none of them spoke good  Spanish  Two young men could speak a little it caused us to take more notice of them To these we made a present and desired them to get us a Guide to conduct us to the North side or part of the way which they promised to do themselves if we would reward them for it but told us we must lye still the next day But we thought our selves nearer the North Sea than we were and proposed to go without a Guide rather than stay here a whole day However some of our men who were tired resolved to stay behind and Mr  Wafer  our Chyrurgeon who marched in great pain ever since his Knee was burned with powder was resolved to stay with them  The tenth day we got up betimes resolving to march but the  Indians  opposed it as much as they could but seeing they could not perswade us to stay they came with us and having taken leave of our friends we set out  Here therefore we left the Chyrurgeon and two more as we said and marched away to the East∣ward following our Guides But we often look'd on our Pocket Compasses and shewed them to the Guides pointing at the way that we would go which made them shake their heads and say they were pretty things but not convenient for us Af∣ter we had descended the Hills on which the Town stood we come down into a Valley and guided our selves by a River which we crossed times and having marched miles we built Hutts and lay there all night This evening I killed a Quaum a large Bird as big as a Turkey wherewith we treated our Guides for we brought no Provision  with us This night our Slave run away  The eleventh day we marched miles farther and built Hutts at night but went supperless to bed  The twelfth in the morning we crossed a deep River passing over it on a Tree and marched mile in a low swampy ground and came to the side of a great deep River but could not get over We built Hutts upon its Banks and lay there all night upon our Barbecu's or frames of Sticks raised a∣bout foot from the ground  The thirteenth day when we turned out the River had overflow'd its Banks and was foot deep in our Hutts and our Guides went from us not tel∣ling us their intent which made us think they were returned home again Now we began to repent our haste in coming from the last settlements for we had no food since we came from thence Indeed we got Macawberries in this place wherewith we satisfied our selves this day though coursly  The fourteenth day in the morning betimes our Guides came to us again and the Waters being fallen within their bounds they carried us to a Tree that stood on the Bank of the River and told us if we could fell that Tree cross it we might pass if not we could pass no further Therefore we set two of the best Ax men that we had who fell'd it exactly cross the River and the boughs just reached over on this we passed very safe We afterwards crossed another River three times with much difficulty and at a clock in the afternoon we came to an  Indian  settlement where we met a drove of Monkeys and kill'd of them and stay∣ed here all night having marched this day miles Here we got Plantains enough and a kind recepti∣on of the  Indian  that lived here all alone except one Boy to wait on him  The fifteeenth day when we set out the kind  Indian  and his Boy went with us in a Canoa and set us over such places as we could not ford and being past those great Rivers he returned back a∣gain having helped us at least mile We marched afterwards mile and came to large Plantain walks where we took up our quarters that night we there fed plentifully on Plantains both ripe and green and had fair weather all the day and night I think these were the largest Plantain walks and the biggest Plantains that ever I saw but no house near them We gathered what we pleased by our Guides orders  The sixteenth day we marched mile and came to a large settlement where we abode all day Not a man of us but wisht the Journey at an end our Feet being blistered and our Thighs stript with wading through so many Rivers the way being al∣most continually through Rivers or pathless Woods In the afternoon five of us went to seek for game and kill'd Monkeys which we drest for Supper Here we first began to have fair weather which continued with us till we came to the North Seas  The eighteenth day we set out at a Clock and the  Indians  with Canoas carried us a league up a River and when we landed the kind  Indians  went with us and carried our burthens We march∣ed mile farther and then built our Hutts having travelled from the last settlements miles  The nineteenth day our Guides lost their way and we did not march above miles  The twentieth day by a Clock we came to  Cheapo  River The Rivers we crost hitherto run all into the South Seas and this of  Cheapo  was the last we met with that run that way Here an old man who came from the last settlements destribu  ed his burthen of Plantains amongst us and taking his leave returned home Afterwards we forded the River  and marched to the foot of a very high Mountain where we lay all night This day we marched a∣bout miles  The st day some of the  Indians  returned back and we marched up a very high mountain being on the top we went some miles on a ridge and steep on both sides then descended a little and came to a fine Spring where we lay all night having gone this day about miles the weather still very fair and clear  The d day we marched over another very high Mountain keeping on the ridge miles When we came to the North end we to our great comfort saw the Sea then we descended and parted our selves into  Companies and lay by the side of a River which was the first we met that runs into the North Sea  The d day we came through several large Plan∣tain walks and at a clock came to an  Indians  habitation not far from the  North Sea  Here we got Canoas to carry us down the River  Conception  to the Sea side having gone this day miles We found a great many  Indians  at the mouth of this River They had settled themselves here for the be∣nefit of Trade with the Privateers and their Com∣modities were Yams Potatoes Plantains Sugar C  es Fowls and Eggs  These  Indians  told us that there had been a great many  English  and  French  Ships here which were all gone but one  Barcolongo  a  French  Privateer that lay at  La Sounds  Key or Island This Island is about leagues from the mouth of the River  Conception  and is one of the  Samballoes  a range of Islands reaching for about  leagues from point  Samballas  to  G  ¦den Island  Eastward These Islands or Keys as we call them were first made the Rendezvous of Pri∣  eers in the year being very convenient  ca  ing and had names given to some of  them by the Captains of the Privateers as this  La Sounds  Key particularly  Thus we finished our Journey from the  South Sea  to the  North  in days in which by my ac∣count we travelled miles crossing some very high Mountains but our common march was in the Valleys among deep and dangerous Rivers At our first landing in this Country we were told that the  Indians  were our Enemies we knew the Rivers to be deep the wet season to be coming in yet excepting those we left behind we lost but one man who was drowned as I said Our first land∣ing place on the South Coast was very disadvanta∣geous for we travell'd at least fifty miles more than we need to have done could we have gone up  Cheapo  River or  Santa Maria  River for at either of these places a man may pass from Sea to Sea in days time with ease The  Indians  can do it in a day and a half by which you may see how easy it is for a party of men to travel over I must confess the  Indians  did assist us very much and I question whether ever we had got over without their assist∣ance because they brought us from time to time to their Plantations where we always got Provisi∣on which else we should have wanted But if a party of or men or more were minded to travel from the North to the South Seas they may do it without asking leave of the  Indians  tho it be much better to be friends with them  On the th of  May  having lain one night at the Rivers mouth we all went on board the Privateer who lay at  La Sounds  Key It was a  French  Vessel Captain  Tristian  Commander The first thing we did was to get such things as we could to gratifie our  Indian  Guides for we were resolved to reward them to their hearts content This we did by gi∣ving them Beads Knives Scissars and Lookingglasses which we bought of the Privateers Crew  and a half Dollar a man from each of us which we would have bestowed in goods also but could not get any the Privateer having no more toys They were so well satisfied with these that they return'd with joy to their friends and were very kind to our Consorts whom we left behind as Mr  Wafer  our Chyrurgeon and the rest of them told us when they came to us some months afterwards as shall be said hereafter  I might have given a further account of several things relating to this Country the  Inland  parts of which are so little known to the  Europeans  But I shall leave this province to Mr  Wafer  who made a longer abode in it than I and is better able to do it that

board which we went being now clean'd and our  Indian  Guides thus satis∣fy'd and set ashore we set sail in two days for  Springer  's Key another of the  Samballoes  Isles and about or leagues from  La Sound  's Key Here lay sail of Privateers more  viz  Capt  Coxon  Guns Men  Capt  Payne  Guns Men  Capt  Wright  a Barcolongo Guns Men  Capt  Williams  a small Barcolongo  English  Comman¦ders and  English  men  Capt  Yanks  a Barcolongo Guns about Men  English Dutch  and  French  himself a  Dutchman  Capt  Achemboe  Guns Men  Capt  Tucker  Guns Men  Capt  Rose  a Barcolongo  French  Com∣manders and Men  An hour before we came to the Fleet Captai  Wright  who had been sent to  Chagra  River arrive  at  Springer  's Key with a large Conoa or Pereag  laden with Flower which he took there Some o  the Prisoners belonging to the Pereago came fro  Panama  not above days before he took her an  told the news of our coming over land and like¦wise related the condition and strength of  Panama  which was the main thing they enquired after fo  Captain  Wright  was sent thither purposely to get  Prisoner that was able to inform them of th  strength of that City because the Privateers de¦signed to joyn all their force and by the assistanc  of the  Indians  who had promised to be their Guides to march over land to  Panama  and there is no other way of getting Prisoners for that purpose but by absconding between  Chagra  and  Portabell  because there are much Goods brought that way for  Pana∣ma  especially when the Armado lyeth at  Portabell  All the Commanders were aboard of Captain  Wright  when we came into the Fleet and were mighty inquisitive of the Prisoners to know the truth of what they related concerning us But as soon as they knew we were come they immediately came aboard of Captain  Tristian  heing all overjoy'd to see us for Captain  Coxon  and many others had left us in the South Seas about months since and had never heard what became of us since that time They enquired of us what we did there how we lived how far we had been and what discoveries we made in those Seas After we had answered these general questions they began to be more par∣ticular in examining us concerning our passage thro the Country from the South Seas We rela∣ted the whole matter giving them an account of the fatigues of our march and the inconveniencies we suffered by the rains and disheartned them quite from that design  Then they proposed several other places where such a party of men as were now got together might make a Voyage but the objections of some or other still hinder'd any proceeding for the Privateers have an account of most Towns within leagues of the Sea on all the Coast from  Trinidado  down to  La Vera Cruz  and are able to give a near guess of the strength and riches of them For they make it their business to examin all Prisoners that fall into their hands concerning the Country Town or City that they belong to whether born there or how long they have known it how ma∣ny families whether most  Spaniards  or whether  the major part are not Coppercolour'd as  Mulattoe  Mustesoes  or  Indians  whether rich and what the  riches do consist in and what their chiefest man  ¦factures If fortified how many great Guns a  what number of small Arms Whether it is possib  to come undescried on them How many Lookou  or Centinels for such the  Spaniards  always keep  and how the Lookouts are placed Whether possib  to avoid the Lookouts or take them If any Riv  or Creek comes near it or where the best Landing  with innumerable other such questions which the  curiosities lead them to demand And if they ha  had any former discourse of such places from oth  Prisoners they compare one with the other the  examin again and enquire if he or any of the  are capable to be Guides to conduct a party of me  thither if not where and how any Prisoner ma  be taken that may do it and from thence they a  ¦terwards lay their Schemes to prosecute whateve  design they take in hand  It was or days after before any resolution wa  taken yet consultations were held every day Th  French  seemed very forward to go to any Town tha  the  English  could or would propose because the Go¦vernour of  Petit Guavos  from whom the Privateer  take Commissions had recommended a Gentlema  lately come from  France  to be General of the Ex¦pedition and fent word by Captain  Tucker  wit  whom this Gentleman came that they should i  possible make an attempt on some Town befor  he returned again The  English  when they wer  in company with the  French  seemed to approve o  what the  French  said but never looked on that Ge¦neral to be fit for the service in hand  At length it was concluded to go to a Town  the name of which I have forgot it lies a great wa  in the Country but not such a tedious march as i  would be from hence to  Panama  Our way to i  lay up  Carpenters  River which is about leagues to the Westward of  Portabell  Our greatest obstructi∣on in this design was our want of Boats therefore it was concluded to go with all our Fleet to St  An∣dreas  a small uninhabited Island lying near the Isle of  Providence  to the Westward of it in deg m North Lat and from  Portabell  N N W about leagues where we should be but a little way from  Carpenter  's River And besides at this Island we might build Canoas it being plentifully stored with large Cedars for such a purpose and for this reason the  Jamaicamen  come hither frequently to build Sloops Cedar being very fit for building and it being to be had here at free cost beside other Wood  Jamaica  is well stored with Cedars of its own chiefly among the Rocky Mountains these also of St  Andreas  grow in stony ground and are the largest that ever I knew or heard of the Bo∣dies alone being ordinarily or foot long ma∣ny or and upwards and of a proportionable bigness The  Bermudas  Isles are well stor'd with them so is  Virginia  which is generally a sandy soil I saw none in the  East Indies  nor in the South Sea Coast except on the Isthmus as I came over it We reckon the Pereagos and Canoas that are made of Cedar to be the best of any they are nothing but the Tree it self made hollow Boatwise with a flat bottom and the Canoa generally sharp at both ends the Pereago at one only with the other end flat But what is commonly said of Cedar that the Worm will not touch it is a mistake for I have seen of it very mucb worm eaten  All things being thus concluded on we sailed from hence directing our course toward St  Andreas  We kept company the first day but at night it blew a hard gale at N E and some of our Ships bore away the next day others were forced to leave us and the second night we lost all our company I  was now belonging to Captain  Archembo  for al  the rest of the Fleet were overmann'd Captain  Ar¦chembo  wanting men we that came out of the South Seas must either sail with him or remain among the  Indians  Indeed we found no cause to dislike the Captain but his  French  Seamen were the sad¦dest creatures that ever I was among for tho w  had bad weather that required many hands aloft ye  the biggest part of them never stirr'd out of thei  Hammocks but to eat and ease themselves W  made a shift to find the Island the fourth day wher  we met Captain  Wright  who came thither the da  before and had taken a  Spanish  Tartan wherei  were men all well arm'd She had Pater  ¦roes and some long Guns plac'd in a Swivel on th  Gunnel They fought an hour before they yielde  The news they related was that they came fro  Cartagena  in company of Armadilloes which a  small Vessels of War to seek for the Fleet of Priv  ¦teers lying in the  Samballoes  that they parted fro  the Armadilloes days before that they were o  ¦der'd to search the  Sambaloes  for us and if they di  not find us then they were ordered to go to  Port  ¦bel  and lye there till they had farther intelligen  of us and he supposed those Armadilloes to be n  there  We that came over Land out of the  South Seas  be¦ing weary of living among the  French  desired Cap¦tain  Wright  to fit up his Prize the Tartan and mak  a Man of War of her for us which he at first seem'  to decline because he was settled among the  Fren  in  Hispaniola  and was very well beloved both b  the Governor of  PetitGuavos  and all the Gentry  and they would resent it ill that Captain  Wrigh  who had no occasion of Men should be so unkin  to Captain  Archembo  as to seduce his Men fro  him he being so meanly mann'd that he coul  hardly sail his Ship with his  Frenchmen  We tol  im we would no longer remain with Captain  Ar∣  hembo  but would go ashore there and build Ca∣  oas to transport our selves down to the  Moskitoes  f he would not entertain us for Privateers are not  bliged to any Ship but free to go ashore where  hey please or to go into any other Ship that will  ntertain them only paying for their Provision  When Captain  Wright  saw our resolutions he  greed with us on condition we should be under his  ommand as one Ships company to which we  nanimously consented  We staid here about days to see if any more of our Fleet would come to us but there came no more of us to the Island but three  viz  Captain  Wright  Captain  Archembo  and Captain  Tucker  Therefore we concluded the rest were bore away either for  Boccatoro  or  Bluefields  River on the Main and we designed to seek them We had fine wea∣  her while we lay here only some Tornadoes or Thundershowers But in this Isle of  St Andreas  there being neither Fish Fowl nor Deer and it being therefore but an ordinary place for us who had but little Provision we sailed from hence again  n quest of our scattered Fleet directing our course for some Islands lying near the Main called by the Privateers the  CornIslands  being in hopes to get Corn there These Islands I take to be the same which are generally called in the Maps the  Pearl Islands  lying about the Lat of D M North Here we arrived the next day and went ashore on one of them but found none of the Inhabitants for here are but a few poor naked  Indians  that live  ere who have been so often plundered by the Privateers that they have but little Provision and when they see a Sail they hide themselves other∣wise Ships that come here would take them and make Slaves of them and I have seen some of them that have been Slaves They are people of a  mean stature yet strong Limbs they are of a dar  copper colour black Hair full round Faces smal  black Eyes their Eyebrows hanging over their Eye  low Foreheads short thick Noses not high bu  flattish full Lips and short Chins They have a fashion to cut holes in the Lips o  the Boys when they are young  close to their Chin which the  keep open with little Pegs till the  are or years old then the  wear Beards in them made of Tu  ¦tle or Tortoiseshell in the for  you see in the Margin  The littl  notch at the upper end they put i  through the Lip where it remain  between the Teeth and the Lip  the under part hangs down over their Chin Thi  they commonly wear all day and when they slee  they take it out They have likewise holes bore  in their Ears both Men and Women when young  and by continual stretching them with great Pegs  they grow to be as big as a mill'd five shillingpiec  Herein they wear pieces of Wood cut very roun  and smooth so that their Ear seems to be all Wood  with a little skin about it Another Ornament th  Women use is about their Legs which they a  very curious in for from the infancy of the Girl  their Mothers make fast a piece of Cotten Cloat  about the small of their Leg from the Ankle to th  Calf very hard which makes them have a ver  full Calf this the Women wear to their dying day  Both Men and Women go naked only a Clout a¦bout their Wastes yet they have but little Fee  though they go barefoot Finding no Provisio  here we sailed toward  Bluefield  River where w  careened our Tartane and there Captain  Archemb  and Captain  Tucker  left us and went towards  Boc¦cotoro  This  Blewfields  River comes out between the Ri∣vers of  Nicuragua  and  Veragua  At its mouth is a fine sandy Bay where Barks may clean It is deep at its mouth but a shoal within so that Ships may not enter yet Barks of or Tuns may It had this name from Captain  Blewfield  a famous Priva∣teer living on  Providence  Island long before  Jamaica  was taken Which Island of  Providence  was settled by the  English  and belonged to the Earls of  Warwick  In this River we found a Canoa coming down the stream and tho we went with our Canoas to seek for Inhabitants yet we found none but saw in or places signs that  Indians  had made on that side the River The Canoa which we found was but meanly made for want of Tools therefore we concluded these  Indians  have no commerce with the  Spaniards  nor with other  Indians  that have  While we lay here our  Moskito  men went in their Canoa and struck us some Manatee or Seacow Besides this  Blewfields  River I have seen of the Manatee in the Bay of  Campechy  on the Coasts of  Bocca del Drago  and  Bocca del Toro  in the River of  Darien  and among the South Keys or little Islands of  Cuba  I haveheard of there being found on the North of  Jamaica  a few and in the Rivers of  Surinam  in great multitudes which is a very low Land I have seen of them also at  Mindanao  one of the  Philippine  Islands and on the Coast of  NewHolland  This Creature is about the bigness of a Horse and or foot long The mouth of it is much like the mouth of a Cow having great thick lips The Eyes are no bigger than a small Pea the Ears are only small holes on each side of the head The Neck is short and thick bigger than the Head The biggest part of this Creature is at the Shoul∣ders where it hath large Fins one on each side of its Belly Under each of these Fins the Female hath a small Dug to suckle her young From the  Shoulders towards the Tayl it retains its bigness for about a foot then it groweth smaIler and smaller to the very Tayl which is flat and about inches broad and inches long and in the middle or inches thick but about the edges of it not above inches thick From the Head to the Tayl it is round and smooth without any Fin but those two before mentioned I have heard that some have weighed above  l  but I never saw any so large The Manatee delights to live in a brackish Water and they are commonly in Creeks or Rivers near the Sea 'Tis for this reason possibly they are not seen in the South Seas that ever I could observe where the Coast is generally a bold Shoar that is high Land and deep Water close home by it with a high Sea or great Surges except in the Bay of  Pa∣nama  yet even there is no Manatee Whereas the  West Indies  being as it were one great Bay compo∣sed of many smaller are mostly low Land and shoal Water and afford proper pasture as I may say for the Manatee Sometimes we find them in Salt Wa∣ter sometimes in fresh but never far at Sea And those that live in the Sea at such places where there is no River nor Creek fit for them to enter yet do commonly come once or twice in hours to the mouth of any fresh water River that is near their place of abode They live on Grass or inches long and of a narrow blade which grows in the Sea in many places especially among Islands near the Main This Grass groweth likewise in Creeks or in great Rivers near the sides of them in such places where there is but little tyde or current They never come ashoar nor into shallower water than where they can swim Their flesh is white both the fat and the lean and extraordinary sweet wholesome meat The tayl of a young Cow is most esteem'd but if old both head and tayl are very tough A Calf that sucks is the most delicate meat  Privateers commonly roast them as they do also great pieces cut out of the Bellies of the old ones  The Skin of the Manatee is of great use to Priva∣teers for they cut them into straps which they make fast on the side of their Canoas thro' which they put their Oars in rowing instead of tholes or pegs The Skin of the Bull or of the Back of the Cow is too thick for this use but of it they make Horsewhips cutting them or foot long at the handle they leave the full substance of the Skin and from thence cut it away tapering but very even and square all the four sides While the Thongs are green they twist them and hang them to dry which in a weeks time become as hard as Wood The  Moskitomen  have always a small Canoa for their use to strike Fish Tortoises or Manatee which they keep usually to themselves and very neat and clean They use no Oars but Paddles the broad part of which doth not go tapering towards the staff pole or shandle of it as in the Oar nor do they use it in the same manner by laying it on the side of the Vessel but hold it perpendicularly griping the staff hard with both hands and put∣ting back the water by main strength and very quick stroaks One of the  Moskitoes  for there go but in a Canoa sits in the stern the other kneels down in the head and both paddle till they come to the place where they expect their game Then they lye still or paddle very softly looking well about them and he that is in the head of the Canoa lays down his paddle and stands up with his striking staff in his hand This staff is about foot long almost as big as a man's Arm at the great end in which there is hole to place his Harpoon in At the other end of his staff there is a piece of light wood called Bobwood with a hole in it through which the small end of the staff comes and on this piece of Bobwood there is a line of or fa∣thom  wound neatly about and the end of the line made fast to it The other end of the line is made fast to the Harpoon which is at the great end of the staff and the  Moskito  man keeps about a fathom of it loose in his hand When he strikes the Har∣poon presently comes out of the staff and as the Ma∣natee swims away the line runs off from the bob and altho at first both staff and bob may be carried under water yet as the line runs off it will rise a∣gain Then the  Moskito  men paddle with all their might to get hold of the bob again and spend usu∣ally a quarter of an hour before they get it When the Manatee begins to be tired it lieth still and then the  Moskito  men paddle to the bob and take it up and begin to hale in the line When the Manatee feels them he swims away again with the Canoa after him then he that steers must be nim∣ble to turn the head of the Canoa that way that his consort points who being in the head of the Canoa and holding the line both sees and feels which way the Manatee is swimming Thus the Ca∣noa is towed with a violent motion till the Ma∣natee's strength decays Then they gather in the line which they are often forced to let all go to the very end At length when the Creatures strength is spent they hale it up to the Canoas side and knock it on the head and tow it to the nearest shore where they make it fast and seek for another which having taken they go ashore with it to put it into their Canoa For it is so heavy that they cannot lift it in but they hale it up in shoal water as near the shore as they can and then overset the Canoa laying one side close to the Manatee Then they roll it in which brings the Canoa upright a∣gain and when they have heav'd out the water they fasten a line to the other Manatee that lieth a∣flout and tow it after them I have known two  Moskito  men for a week every day bring aboard two  Manatee in this manner the least of which hath not weighed less than pound and that in a very small Canoa that  English  men would scarce ad∣venture to go in When they strike a Cow that hath a young one they seldom miss the Calf for she commonly takes her young one under one of her Fins But if the Calf is so big that she cannot carry it or she so frighted that she only minds to save her own life yet the young never leaves her till the  Moskito  men have an opportunity to strike her  The manner of striking Manatee and Tortoise is much the same only when they seek for Manatee they paddle so gently that they make no noise and never touch the side of the Canoa with their paddle because it is a creature that hears very well But they are not so nice when they seek for Tortoise whose Eyes are better than his Ears They strike the Tortoise with a square sharp Iron peg the other with a Harpoon The  Moskito  men make their own striking Instruments as Harpoons Fish∣hooks and a TortoiseIron or Pegs These Pegs or TortoiseIrons are made square sharp at one end and not much above an inch in length of such a figure as you see in the Margin  The small spike at the broad end hath the line fasten'd to it and goes also into a hole at the end of the striking staff which when the Tortoise is struck flies off the Iron and end of the line fastened to it going quite within the Shells where it's so buried that the Tortoise cannot possibly escape  They make their lines both for Fishing and Stri∣king with the bark of  Maho  which is a sort of Tree or Shrub that grows plentifully all over the  WestIndies  and whose Bark is made up of strings or threads very strong You may draw it off either in flakes or small threads as you have occasion 'Tis fit for any manner of Cordage and Privateers often make  their Rigging of it So much by way of digression  When we had cleaned our Tartane we sail'd from hence bound for  Boccatoro  which is an opening between Islands about Deg Min North Lat between the Rivers of  Veragne  and  Chagre  Here we met with Captain  Yanky  who told us that there had been a Fleet of  Spanish  Armadilloes to seek us that Captain  Tristian  having fallen Leeward was coming to  Boccatoro  and fell in amongst them supposing them to be our Fleet that they fired and chased him but he rowed and towed and they sup∣posed he got away that Capt  Pain  was likewise chaced by them and Capt  Williams  and that they had not seen them since they lay within the Islands that the  Spaniards  never came in to him and that Captain  Coxon  was in at the careening place  This  Boccatoro  is a place that the Privateers use to resort to as much as any place on all the Coast be∣cause here is plenty of green Tortoise and a good careening place The  Indians  here have no com∣merce with the  Spaniards  but are very barbarous and will not be dealt with They have destroyed many Privateers as they did not long after this some of Captain  Pain  's men who having built a Tent ashore to put his goods in while he careened his Ship and some men lying there with their Arms in the night the  Indians  crept softly into the Tent and cut off the heads of or men and made their escape nor was this the first time they had served the Privateers so There grow on this Coast  Vinelloes  in great quantity with which Chocolate is perfumed These I shall describe elsewhere  Our Fleet being thus scattered there was now no hopes of getting together again therefore every one did what they thought most conducing to ob∣tain their ends Capt  Wright  with whom I now was was resolved to cruise on the Coast of  Carta∣gene  and it being now almost the Westerly wind  season we sailed from hence and Captain  Yanky  with us and we consorted because Captain  Yanky  had no Commission and was afraid the  French  would take away his Bark We past by  Scuda  a small Island where tis said Sir  Francis Drake  's bowels were bury'd and came to a small River to the Westward of  Chagre  where we took two new Canoas and car∣ry'd them with us into the  Sambaloes  We had the Wind at West with much rain which brought us to  Point Samballas  Here Captain  Wright  and Cap∣tain  Yanky  left us in the Tartane to fix the Conoas while they went on the Coast of  Cartagene  to seek for provision We cruised in among the Islands and kept our  Moskitomen  or strikers out who brought aboard some halfgrown Tortoise and some of us went ashoar every day to hunt for what we could find in the Woods Sometimes we got  Pecary Warree  or Deer at other times we light on a drove of large fat Monkeys or  Quames Corrosoes  each a large sort of Fowl Pidgeons Parrots or Tuttle∣doves We liv'd very well on what we got not staying long in one place but sometimes we would go on the Islands where there grow great Groves of  Sapadillies  which is a sort of Fruit much like a Pear but more juicy and under those Trees we found plenty of Soldiers that live in Shells a little kind of Animals and have two great Claws like a Crab and are good food One time our men sound a great many large ones and being sharp set had them drest but most of them were very sick afterwards being poysoned by them For on this Island were many  Manchaneel  Trees whose Fruit is like a small Crab and smells very well but they are not wholesome and we commonly take care of meddling with any Animals that eat them And this we take for a general rule when we find any Fruits that we have not seen before if we see them peck'd by Birds we may freely eat but if we see  no such sign we let them alone for of this Fruit no Birds will taste Many of these Islands have of these  ManchaneelTrees  growing on them  Thus cruising in among these Islands at length we came again to  La Sound  's  Key  and the day be∣fore having met with a  Jamaica  Sloop that was come over on the Coast to trade she went with us It was in the evening when we came to an Anchor and the next morning we fir'd Guns for the  Indi∣ans  that lived on the Main for to come aboard for by this time we concluded we should hear from our men that we left in the heart of the Country a∣mong the  Indians  this being about the latter end of  August  and it was in the beginning of  May  when we parted from them According to our expectati∣on the  Indians  came aboard and brought our friends with them Mr  Wafer  wore a Clout about him and was painted like an  Indian  and he was some time aboard before I knew him One of them named  Riehard Cobson  dyed within or days af∣ter and was buried on  La Sound  's  Key  After this we went to other Keys to the East∣ward of these to meet Captain  Wright  and Captain  Yanky  who met with a Fleet of Pereagos laden with  Indian  Corn Hog and Fowls going to  Carta∣gene  being conveyed with a small Armadilly of Guns and Patereroes Her they ch  sed ashoar and most of the Pereagoes but they got of them off and brought them away  Here Captain  Wright  's and Captain  Yanky  's Barks were clean'd and we stock'd our selves with Corn and then went towards the Coast of  Cartagene  In our way thither we passed by the River of  Darien  which is very broad at the mouth but not above foot water on a Spring tyde for the Tyde riseth but little here Captain  Coxen  about months be∣fore we came out of the  South Sea  went up this Ri∣ver with a party of men Every man carry'd a small  strong Bag to put his Gold in expecting great Riches there tho they got little or none They rowed up about leagues before they came to any settle∣ment and then found some  Spaniards  who lived there  o truck with the  Indians  for Gold there being Gold Scales in every house The  Spaniards  admire how they came so far from the mouth of the River be∣cause there are a sort of  Indians  living between that place and the Sea who are very dreadful to the  Spa∣niards  and will not have any commerce with them nor with any white people They use Trunks about  foot long out of which they blow poysoned Darts and are so silent in their attacks on their Enemies and retreat so nimbly again that the  Spa∣niards  can never find them Their Darts are made of Macawwood being about the bigness and length of a Knittingneedle one end is wound about with Cotton the other end is extraordinary sharp and small and is jagged with notches like a Harpoon so that whatever it strikes into it immediately  reaks off by the weight of the biggest end which  t is not of strength to bear it being made so slen∣  er for that purpose and it is very difficult to be got  ut again by reason of those notches These  Indi∣  ns  have always War with our  Darien  friendly  Indi∣  ns  and lived on both sides this great River or  egues from the Sea but not near the mouth of  he River There are abundance of  Manatee  in this  iver and some Creeks belonging to it This re∣  tion I had from several men who accompany'd Captain  Coxon  in that discovery and from Mr  Cook  particular who was with them and is a very  ntelligent person He is now chief Mate of a Ship  ound to  Guinea  To return therefore to the prose∣  ution of our Voyage meeting with nothing of  ote we passed by  Cartagene  which is a City so  ell known that I shall say nothing of it We  iled by in sight of it for it lies open to the Sea  and had a fair view of  Madre de Popa  or  Nuestra a Sen∣nora de Popa  a Monastery of the Virgin  Mary  's standing on the top of a very steep hill just behind  Cartagene  It is a place of incredible wealth by reason of the offerings made here continually and for this reason often in danger of being visited by the Privateers did not the neighbourhood of  Cartagene  keep them in awe 'Tis in short the very  Loretto  of the  West Indies  it hath innumerable Miracles re∣lated of it Any misfortune that befals the Priva∣teers is attributed to this Lady's doing and the  Spaniards  report that she was abroad that night the  Oxford  Man of War was blown up at the Isle of  Vacca  near  Hispaniola  and that she came home all wet as belike she often returns with her Cloaths dirty and torn with passing thro the Woods and bad ways when she has been out upon any expedition deserving doubtless a new suit for such eminent pieces of service  From hence we passed on to the  Rio Grande  where we took up fresh Water at Sea a league off the mouth of that River From thence we sailed East∣ward passing by  St Martha  a large Town and good Harbour belonging to the  Spaniards  yet hath it within these few years been twice taken by the Privateers It stands close upon the Sea and the Hill within Land is a very large one towering up a great heighth from a vast body of Land I am of opinion that it is higher than the Pike of  Tenariff  others also that have seen both think the same tho its bigness makes its heighth less sensible I have seen it in passing by leagues off at Sea others as they told me above and several have told me that they have seen at once  Jamaica Hispaniola  and the high Land of  Santa Martha  and yet the nearest of these two places is distant from it leagues and  Jamaica  which is farthest off is accounted near leagues and I question whether any Land or either of those Islands may be seen leagues  ts head is generally hid in the Clouds but in clear weather when the top appears it looks white supposed to be covered with Snow  St Martha  ieth in the Lat of Deg North  Being advanced or leagues to the Eastward of  Santa Martha  we left our Ships at Anchor and re∣  urn'd back in our Canoa's to the River  Grande  en∣  ring it by a mouth of it that disembogues it self near  Santa Martha  purposing to attempt some Towns that lye a pretty way up that River But this design meeting with discouragements we re∣  urned to our Ships and set sail to  Rio la Hacha  This hath been a strong  Spanish  Town and is well built but being often taken by the Privateers the  Spaniards  deserted it some time before our arrival It lieth to the Westward of a River and right a∣gainst the Town is a good Road for Ships the bot∣tom clean and sandy The  Jamaica  Sloops used of∣ten to come over to trade here and I am informed that the  Spaniards  have again settled themselves in it and made it very strong We entered the Fort and brought small Guns aboard From thence we went to the  Rancheries  one or small  Indian  Villages where the  Spaniards  kept Barks to fish for Pearl The Pearlbanks lye about or leagues off from the shoar as I have been told thither the Fishing Barks go and Anchor then the Divers go down to the bottom and fill a Basket which is let down before with Oysters and when they come up others go down at a time this they do till the Bark is full and then go ashoar where the Old men Women and Children of the  Indians  open the Oysters there being a  Spanish  Over∣seer to look after the Pearl Yet these  Indians  do very often secure the best Pearl for themselves as many  Ja∣maica  men can testifie who daily trade with them The meat they string up and hang it a drying At this place we went ashoar where we found one of the  Barks and saw great heaps of Oystershells but the people all fled Yet in another place between this and  Rio la Hacha  we took some of the  Indians  who seem to be a stubborn sort of people They are longvisaged black hair their noses somewhat ri∣sing in the middle and of a stern look The  Spani∣ards  report them to be a very numerous Nation and that they will not subject themselves to their yoak Yet they have  Spanish  Priests among them and by trading have brought them to be somewhat sociable but cannot keep a severe hand over them The Land is but barren it being of a light sand near the Sea and most  Savanah  or Champion and the grass but thin and course yet they feed plenty of Cattel Every man knoweth his own and looketh after them but the Land is in common except only their Houses or small Plantations where they live which every man maintains with some fence about it They may remove from one place to another as they please no man having right to any Land but what he possesseth This part of the Country is not so subject to Rain as to the West∣ward of  Santa Martha  yet here are Tornadoes or Thundershowers but neither so violent as on the Coast of  Portabell  nor so frequent The Westerly Winds in the Westerly Wind season blow here tho not so strong nor lasting as on the Coasts of  Carta∣gene  and  Portabell  When we had spent some time here we return'd again towards the Coast of  Cartagene  and being be∣tween  Rio Grande  and that place we met with Westerly Winds which kept us still to the Eastward of  Cartagene  or days and then in the morning we descryed a Sail off at Sea and we chaced her at noon Captain  Wright  who sail'd best came up with her and engaged her and in half an hour after Captain  Yankey  who sailed better than the Tartan the Vessel that I was in came up with he  likewise and laid her aboard then Captain  Wright  also and they took her before we came up They lost or men and had or wounded The Prize was a Ship of Guns and men who had all good small Arms She was laden with Sugar and Tobacco and had or Tuns of Marmalet on board She came from  Saint Jago  on  Cuba  and was bound to  Cartagene  We went back with her to  Rio Grande  to fix our Rigging which was shattered in the Fight and to consider what to do with her for these were com∣modities of little use to us and not worth going into a Port with At the  Rio Grande  Capt  Wright  demanded the Prize as his due by vertue of his Com∣mission Captain  Yanky  said it was his due by the Law of Privateers Indeed Captain  Wright  had the most right to her having by his Commission pro∣tected Captain  Yanky  from the  French  who would have turned him out because he had no Commissi∣on and he likewise began to engage her first But the company were all affraid that Captain  Wright  would presently carry her into a Port therefore most of Captain  Wright  's men stuck to Captain  Yanky  nd Captain  Wright  losing his Prize burned his own  ark and had Captain  Yanky  's it being bigger than  is own the Tartan was sold to a  Jamaica  Trader  nd Captain  Yanky  commanded the Prize Ship We  ent again from hence to  Rio la Hach  and set the  risoners ashoar and it being now the beginning of  ov  we concluded to go to  Querisao  to sell  our  ugar if favoured by westerly winds which were  ow come in We sailed from thence having fair  eather and winds to our mind which brought us  Querisao  a  Dutch  Island Captain  Wright  went a∣  ar to the Governor and offered him the Sale of  e Sugar but the Governor told him he had a  eat Trade with the  Spaniards  therefore he could  t admit us in there but if we would go to  St Tho∣mas  which is an Island and Free Port belonging to the  Danes  and a Sanctuary for Privateers he would send a Sloop with such Goods as we wanted and Money to buy the Sugar which he would take at a certain rate but it was not agreed to  Querisao  is the only Island of importance that the  Dutch  have in the  West Indies  It is about leagues in length and may be or in circumference the Northermost point is laid down in North lat d m and it is about or leagues from the Main near Cape  Roman  On the South side of the East end is a good Harbour called  Santa Barbara  but the chiefest harbour is about leagues from the S E end on the South side of it where the  Dutch  have a very good Town and a very strong Fort Ships bound in thither must be sure to keep close to the Harbours mouth and have a Hasar or Rope ready to send one end ashoar to the Fort for there is no Anchoring at the entrance of the Harbour and the Current always sets to the Westward But being got in it is a very secure Port for Ships either to Careen or lye safe At the East end are two hills one of them is much higher than the other and steepest toward the North side The rest of the Island is indifferent level where of late some rich Men have made Sugar Works which formerly was all pa∣sture for Cattel there are also some small Planta∣tions of Potatoes and Yames and they have still a great many Cattel on the Island but it is not so much esteemed for its produce as for its situation for the Trade with the  Spaniard  Formerly the Har∣bour was never without Ships from  Cart  egne  and  Portobell  that did use to buy of the  Dutch  here or Negroes at once besides great quantities of  European  Commodities but of late that Trade is fallen into the hands of the  English  at  Jamaica  yet still the  Dutch  have a vast Trade over all the  West Indies  sending from  Holland  Ships of good force laden  with  European  goods whereby they make very pro∣fitable returns The  Dutch  have other Islands here but of little moment in comparison of  Queri∣sao  the one lieth or leagues to the Westward of  Querisao  called  Aruba  the other or leagues to the Eastward of it called  Bon Airy  From these Islands the  Dutch  fetch in Sloops Provision for  Queri∣sao  to maintain their Garrison and Negroes I was never at  Aruba  therefore cannot say any thing of it as to my own knowledge but by report it is much like  Bon Airy  which I shall describe only not so big Between  Querisao  and  Bon Airy  is a small Island called  Little Querisao  it is not above a league from  Great Querisao  The King of  France  has long had an eye on  Querisao  and made some attempts to take it but never yet succeeded I have heard that about or years since the Governor had sold it to the  French  but dyed a small time before the Fleet came to demand it and by his death that design failed Afterwards in the year the Count  D' Estree  who a year before had taken the Isle of  Tobago  from the  Dutch  was sent thither also with a Squadron of stout Ships very well mann'd and fitted with Bombs and Carcasses intending to take it by storm This Fleet came first to  Martinico  where while they stay'd orders were sent to  Petit Guavers  for all Pri∣vateers to repair thither and assist the Count in his design There were but Privateers Ships that went thither with him which were mann'd partly with  French  partly with  English  men These set  ut with the Count but in their way to  Querisao  he whole Fleet was lost on a Riff or Ridge of  ocks that runs off from the Isle of  Aves  not a∣  ove Ships escaping of which was of the Pri∣  teers and so that design perished  Wherefore not driving a Bargain for our Sugar  ith the Governor of  Querisao  we went from thence  Bon Airy  another  Dutch  Island where we met a  Dutch  Sloop come from  Europe  laden with  Irish  B  which we bought in exchange for some of our S    Bon  is the Eastermost of the  Dutch  Islands and is the largest of the tho not the most confi∣derable The middle of the Island is laid down in Lat d m It is about leagues from the Main and or from  Querisao  and is accounted or leagues round The Road is on the S W side near the middle of the Island where there is a pretty deep Bay runs in Ships that come from the Eastward luff up close to the Eastern shoar and let go their Anchor in fathom water within half a Cables length of the shoar But at the same time they must be ready with a Boat to carry a Hasar or Rope and make it fast ashoar otherwise when the Landwind comes in the night the Ship would drive off to Sea again for the ground is so steep that no Anchor can hold if once it starts About half a mile to the Westward of this Anchoring place there is a small low land and a Channel between it and the main Island  The Houses are about half a mile within Land right against the Road there is a Governor lives here a Deputy to the Governor of  Querisao  and or Soldiers with or Families of  Indians  There is no Fort and the Soldiers in peaceable times have little to do but to eat and sleep for they never watch but in time of War The  Indians  are Hus∣bandmen and plant Maiz and  Guinea  Corn and some Yams and Potatoes But their chiefest busi∣ness is about Cattel for this Island is plentifully stocked with Goats and they send great quantities every year in Salt to  Querisao  There are some Horses and Bulls and Cows but I never saw any Sheep tho I have been all over the Island The South side is plain low Land and there are several sorts of Trees but none very large There is a small  Spring of Water by the Houses which serves the Inhabitants tho it is blackish At the West end of the Island there is a good Spring of fresh Water and and  Indian  Families live there but no Water nor Houses at any other place On the South side near the East end is a good Saltpond where  Dutch  Sloops come for Salt  From  BonAiry  we went to the Isle of  Aves  or Birds so called from its great plenty of Birds as  MenofWar  and  Boobies  but especially  Boobies  The  Booby  is a Waterfowl somewhat less than a Hen of a light greyish colour I observed the  Boobies  of this Island to be whiter than others This Bird hath a strong Bill longer and bigger than a Crows and broader at the end her Feet are flat like a Ducks feet It is a very simple Creature and will hardly go out of a Man's way In other places they build their Nests on the Ground but here they build on Trees which I never saw any where else tho' I have seen of them in a great many places Their Flesh is black and eats Fishy but are often eaten by the Privateers Their numbers have been much les∣sened by the  French  Fleet which was lost here as I shall give an account  The  ManofWar  as it is called by the  English  is about the bigness of a Kite and in shape like it but black and the Neck is red It lives on Fish yet never lights on the Water but soars alost like a Kite and when it sees its prey it flys down head fore∣most to the Waters edge very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill and immediately mounts again as swiftly and never touching the Water with his Bill His Wings are very long his Feet are like other Landfowl and he builds on Trees where he finds any but where they are want∣ing on the Ground  This Island  Aves  lies about or leagues to the Eastward of the Island  BonAiry  about or leagues  from the Main and about the lat of d m North It is but small not above mile in length and towards the East end not half a mile broad On the North side it is low Land commonly overflown with the Tide but one the South side there is a great Rocky Bank of Coral thrown up by the Sea The West end is for near a mile space plain even Savan∣nah Land without any Trees There are or Wells dug by Privateers who often frequent this Island because there is a good Harbour about the middle of it on the North side where they may conveniently careen The Riff or Bank of Rocks on which the  French  Fleet was lost as I mentioned above runs along from the East end to the Northward about mile then trends away to the Westward making as it were a HalfMoon This Riff breaks off all the Sea and there is good Riding in even sandy ground to the Westward of it There are or small low sandyKeys or Island within this Riff about miles from the Main Island The Count  d'Estree  lost his Fleet here in this manner Coming from the Eastward he fell in on the back of the Riff and fired Guns to give warning to the rest of his Fleet But they supposing their Admiral was engaged with Enemies hoisted up their Topsails and croud∣ed all the Sail they could make and ran full sail ashoar after him all within half a mile of each other For his Light being in the MainTop was an unhappy Beacon for them to follow and there escaped but one KingsShip and one Privateer The Ships continued whole all day and the Men had time enough most of them to get ashoar yet ma∣ny perished in the Wreck and many of those that got safe on the Isl  nd for want of being accustomed to such hardships died like rotten Sheep But the Privateers who had been used to such accidents liv'd merrily from whom I had this relation and they told me that if they had gone to  Jamaica  with  cl  a Man in their Pockets they could not have en∣joyed themselves more For they kept in a Gang by themselves and watched when the Ships broke to get the Goods that come from them and though much was staved against the Rocks yet abundance of Wine and Brandy floated over the Riff where these Privateers waited to take it up They lived here about weeks waiting an opportunity to tran∣sport themselves back again into  Hispaniola  in all which time they were never without or Hogs∣heads of Wine and Brandy in their Tents and Bar∣rels of Beef and Pork which they could live on without Bread well enough tho the newcomers out of  France  could not There were about forty  Frenchmen  on board in one of the Ships where there was good store of Liquor till the after part of her broke away and floated over the Riff and was carry'd away to Sea with all the Men drinking and singing who being in drink did not mind the danger but were never heard of afterwards  In a short time after this great Shipwrack Cap∣tain  Pain  Commander of a Privateer of Guns had a pleasant accident befel him at this Island He came hither to careen intending to fit himself very well for here lay driven on the Island Mast Yards Timbers and many things that he wanted therefore he haled into the Harbour close to the Island and unrigg'd his Ship Before he had done a Dutch Ship of Guns was sent from  Querisao  to take up the Guns that were lost on the Riff But seeing a Ship in the Harbour and knowing her to be a French Privateer they thought to take her first and came within a mile of her and began to fire at her intending to warp in the next day for it is very narrow goingin Capt  Pain  got ashoar some of his Guns and did what he could to resist them tho' he did in a manner conclude he must be taken But while his Men were thus busied he spy'd a  Dutch  Sloop turning to get into the Road and saw her at the evening Anchor at the West end of the Island This gave him some hope of making his escape which he did by sending two Canoas in the night aboard the Sloop who took her and got confiderable purchase in her and he went away in her making a good Reprizal and leaving his own empty Ship to the  Dutch  Man of War  There is another Island to the Eastward of the Isle of  Aves  about leagues called by Privateers the little Isle of  Aves  which is overgrown with Mangrove Trees I have seen it but was never on it There are no Inhabitants that I could learn on either of these Islands but  Boobies  and a few other Birds  While we were at the Isle of  Aves  we careen'd Capt  Wright  's Bark and scrubb'd the Sugarprize and got Guns out of the Wrecks continuing here till the beginning of  Feb    We went from hence to the Isles  Roca  's to careen the Sugarprize which the Isle of  Aves  was not a place so convenient for Accordingly we haled close to one of the small Islands and got our Guns ashoar the first thing we did and built a Breastwork on the Point and planted all our Guns there to hin∣der an Enemy from coming to us while we lay on the Careen Then we made a House and cover'd ir with our Sails to put our Goods and Provisions in While we lay here a  French  Man of War of Guns came thro' the Keys or little Islands to whom we sold about Tun of Sugar I was a∣board twice or thrice and very kindly welcomed both by the Capt and his Lieutenant who was a Cavalier of  Malta  and they both offered me great Encouragement in  France  if I would go with them but I ever designed to continue with those of my own Nation  The Islands  Roca  's are a parcel of small uninhabit∣ed Islands lying about the lat of deg min  about or leagues from the Main and about leagues N W by W from  Tortuga  and or leagues to the Westward of  Orchilla  another Island lying about the same distance from the Main which Island I have seen but was never at it  Roca  's stretch themselves East and West about leagues and their breadth about leagues The Norther∣most of these Islands is the most remarkable by rea∣son of a high white rocky Hill at the west end of it which may be seen a great way and on it there are abundance of Tropick Birds MenofWar Boo∣by and Noddys which breed there The Booby and ManofWar I have described already The Noddy is a small black Bird about the bigness of the En∣glish Blackbird and indifferent good Meat They build in Rocks We never find them far off from shoar I have seen of them in other places but never saw any of their Nests but in this Island where there is great plenty of them The Tropick Bird is as big as a Pidgeon but round and plump like a Partridge They are all white except two or three Feathers in each Wing of a light grey Their Bills are of a yellowish colour thick and short They have one long Feather or rather a Quill about inches long grows at the Rump which is all the Tail they have They are never seen far without either Tro∣pick for which reason they are called Tropick Birds They are very good food and we meet with them a great way at Sea and I never saw of them any where but at Sea and in this Island where they build and are found in great plenty  By the Sea on the South side of that high Hill there's fresh Water comes out of the Rocks but so slowly that it yields not above Gallons in hours and it tastes so copperish or aluminous ra∣ther and rough in the Mouth that it seems very unpleasant at first drinking But after or days any Water will seem to have no taste  The middle of this Island low plain Land over grown with long Grass where there are multitudes of small grey Fowls no bigger than a Black Bird yet lay Eggs bigger than a Magpy's and they are therefore by Privateers called Egg Birds The East end of the Island is overgrown with black Mangrove Trees  There are sorts of Mangrove Trees black red and white The black Mangrove is the largest Tree the body about as big as an Oak and about foot high It is very hard and serviceable Timber but extraordinary heavy therefore not much made use of for Building The red Mangrove groweth commonly by the Sea side or by Rivers or Creeks The Body is not so big as that of the black Man∣grove but always grows out of many Roots about the bigness of a Mans Leg some bigger some less which is about or foot above the Ground joyn into one trunk or body that seems to be sup∣ported by so many Artificial Stakes Where this sort of Tree grows it is impossible to march by reason of these Stakes which grow so mixt one amongst another that I have when forced to go thro' them gone half a mile and never set my foot on the Ground stepping from Root to Root The Timber is hard and good for many uses The inside of the Bark is red and it is used for tanning of Lea∣ther very much all over the  West Indies  The white Mangrove never groweth so big as the other two sorts neither is it of any great use Of the young Trees Privateers use to make Loom or Handles for their Oars for it is commonly straight but not very strong which is the fault of them Neither the black nor white Mangrove grow towering up from stilts or rising root as the red doth but the Body immediately out of the Ground like other Trees  The Land of this East end is light sand which is sometimes overflown with the Sea at Springtides The Road for Ships is on the South side against the middle of the Island The rest of the Islands of  Roca  's are low The next to this on the South side is but small flat and even without Trees bearing only Grass On the South side of it is a Pond of brackish water which sometimes Privateers use in∣stead of better there is likewise good Riding by it About a league from this are two other Islands not yards distant from each other yet a deep Channel for Ships to pass through They are both overgrown with red Mangrove Trees which Trees above any of the Mangroves do flourish best in wet drowned Land such as these two Islands are only the East point of the Westermost Island is dry sand without Tree or Bush On thispoint we careened lying on the South side of it  The other Islands are low and have red Man∣groves and other Trees on them Here also Ships may ride but no such place for careening as where we lay because at that place Ships may hale close to the shoar and if they had but four Guns on the point may secure the Channel and hinder any Enemy from coming near them I observe that within a∣mong the Islands was good riding in many places but not without the Islands except to the West∣ward or South West of them For on the East or N E of these Islands the common Trade Wind blows and makes a great Sea and to the South∣ward of them there is no ground under or fathom close by the Land  After we had filled what water we could from hence we set out again in  April  and came to  SaltTortuga  so called to distinguish it from the shoals of  Dry Tortugas  near Capt  Florida  and from the Isle of  Tortugas  by  Hispamola  which was called formerly  French Tortugas  though not having heard  any mention of that name a great while I am apt to think it is swallowed up in that of  PetitGuavres  the chief Garrison the French have in those parts This Island we arrived at is pretty large uninhabit∣ed and abounds with Salt It is in lat d North and lyeth West and a little Northerly from  Marga∣rita  an Island inhabited by the  Spaniards  strong and wealthy it is distant from it about leagues and or from Cape  Blanco  on the Main A Ship being within these Islands a little to the South ward may see at once the Main  Margarita  and  Tortuga  when it is clear weather The East end of  Tortuga  is full of rugged bare broken Rocks which stretch themselves a little way out to Sea At the S E part is of an indifferent good Road for Ships much frequented in peaceable times by Merchant∣ships that come thither to lade Salt in the months of  May June July  and  August  For at the East end is a large Saltpond within paces of the Sea The Salt begins to kern or grain in  April  except it is a dry season for it is observed that Rain makes the Salt kern I have seen above Sail at a time in this Road come to lade Salt and these Ships coming from some of the  Caribbe Islands  are always well stored with Rum Sugar and Limejuice to make Punch to hearten their Men when they are at work getting and bringing aboard the Salt and they commonly provide the more in hopes to meet with Privateers who resort hither in the afore∣said Months purposely to keep a  Christmas  as they call it being sure to meet with Liquor enough to be merry with and are very Liberal to those that treat them Near the West end of the Island on the South side there is a small Harbour and some fresh Water That end of the Island is full of shrub∣by Trees but the East end is rocky and barren as to Trees producing only course Grass There are  me Goats on it but not many and Turtle or  Tortoise come upon the sandy Bays to lay their Eggs and from them the Island hath its name There is no riding any where but in the Roads where the Saltponds are or in the Harbour  At this Isle we thought to have sold our Sugar a∣mong the  English  Ships that come hither for Salt but failing there we design'd for  Trinidada  an Island near the main inhabited by the  Spaniards  tolerably strong and wealthy but the Current and Easterly winds hindring us we passed through between  Margarita  and the main and went to  Blanco  a pret∣ty large Island almost North of  Margarita  about leagues from the main and in d m North Lat It is a flat even low uninhabited Island dry and healthy most Savannah of long Grass and hath some Trees of  Lignum Vitae  growing in Spots with shrubby bushes of other Wood about them It is plentifully stored with  Guano's  which are an Animal like a Lizard but much bigger The body is as big as the small of a mans Leg and from the hind quarter the Tail grows tapering to the end which is very small If a man takes hold of the Tail except very near the hind quarter it will part and break off in one of the joints and the  Guano  will get away They lay Eggs as most of those amphi∣bious creatures do and are very good to eat Their flesh is much esteem'd by Privateers who commonly dress them for their sick men for they make very good Broath They are of divers colours as almost black dark brown light brown dark green light green yellow and speckled They all live as well in the Water as on Land and some of them are constantly in the Water and among Rocks These are commonly black Others that live in swampy wet ground are commonly on Bushes and Trees these are green But such as live in dry ground as here at  Blanco  are commonly yellow yet these al∣so will live in the Water and are sometimes on  Trees The Road is on the N W end against a small Cove or little sandy Bay There is no ri∣ding any where else for it is deep water and steep close to the Land There is one small Spring on the West side and there are sandy Bays round the Island where Turtle or Tortoise come up in great abundance going ashoar in the night These that frequent this Island are called green Turtle and they are the best of that sort both for largness and sweetness of any in all the  West Indies  I would here give a particular description of these and other sorts of Turtle in these Seas but because I shall have occasion to mention some other sort of Turtle when I come again into the South Seas that are very different from all these I shall there give a general account of all these several sorts at once that the difference between them may be the better discern∣ed Some of our modern Descriptions speak of Goats on this Island I know not what there may have been formerly but there are none now to my certain knowledge for my self and many more of our Crew have been all over it Indeed these parts have undergone great changes in this last Age as well in places themselves as in their Owners and Commodities of them particularly  Nombre deDios  a City once famous and which still retains a consi∣derable name in some late accounts is now nothing but a Name For I have lain ashoar in the place where that City stood but it is all overgrown with Wood so as to leave no sign that any Town hath been there  We staid at the Isle of  Blanco  not above ten days and then went back to  SaltTortuga  again where Captain  Yanky  parted with us And from thence after about days all which time our men were drunk and quarrelling we in Capt  Wright  's Ship went to the Coast of  Caraccos  on the Main Land This Coast is upon several accounts very remarka∣ble  'Tis a continued tract of high Ridges of Hills and small Valleys intermixt for about leagues stretching East and West but in such manner that the Ridges of Hills and the Valleys alternately run pointing upon the shore from South to North The Valleys some of them about or others not above one or two furlongs wide and in length from the Sea scarce any of them above or mile at most there being a long ridge of Mountains at that di∣stance from the Seacoast and in a manner parallel to it that joyns those shorter Ridges and closeth up the South end of the Valleys which at the North ends of them lye open to the Sea and make so many little sandy Bays that are the only landing places on the Coast Both the main Ridge and these shorter Ribs are very high Land so that or leagues off at Sea the Valleys scarce appear to the Eye but all looks like one great Mountain From the Isles of  Roca  's about and from the Isle of  Aves  about leagues off we see this Coast very plain from on board our Ships yet when at Anchor on this Coast we cannot see those Isles tho again from the tops of these Hills they appear as if at no great distance like so many Hillocks in a Pond These Hills are barren except the lower sides of them that are covered with some of the same rich black Mould that fiills the Valleys and is as good as I have seen In some of the Valleys there's a strong red Clay but in the general they are extreamly fertile well water'd and inhabited by  Spaniards  and their Negroes They have Maiz and Plantains for their support with  Indian  Fowls and some Hogs But the main product of these Valleys and indeed the only Commodity it vends are the Cacao Nuts of which the Chocolate is made The CacaoTree grows no where in the North Seas but in the Bay of  Campeachy  on  Costa Rica  between  Portabel  and  Nica∣ragua  chiefly up  Carpenters  River and on this Coast  as high as the Isle of  Trinidada  In the South Seas it grows in the River of  Guiaquil  a little to the Southward of the Line and in the Valley of  Collima  on the South side of the Continent of  Mexico  both which places I shall hereafter describe Besides these I am confident there's no place in the World where the Cacao grows except those in  Jamaica  of which there are now but few remaining of many and large Walks or Plantations of them found there by the  English  at their first arrival and since planted by them and even these tho there is a great deal of pains and care bestowed on them yet seldom come to any thing being generally blighted The Nuts of this Coast of  Caraccos  tho less than those of  Costa Rica  which are large flat Nuts yet are bet∣ter and fatter in my opinion being so very oily that we are forced to use Water in rubbing them up and the  Spaniards  that live here instead of parching them to get off the Shell before they pound or rub them to make Chocalate do in a manner burn 'em to dry up the Oil for else they say it would fill them too full of blood drinking Chocolate as they do five or six times a day My worthy Con∣sort Mr  Ringrose  commends most the  Guiaquil  Nut I presume because he had little knowledge of the rest for being intimately acquainted with him I know the course of his Travels and Experience But I am perswaded had he known the rest so well as I pretend to have done who have at several times been long used to and in a manner lived upon all the several sorts of 'em abovementioned he would prefer the  Caraccos  Nuts before any other yet pos∣sibly the drying up of these Nuts so much by the  Spa∣niards  here as I said may lessen their esteem with those  Europeans  that use their Chocolate ready rubb'd up So that we always chose to make it up our selves  The Cacao Tree hath a Body about a foot and an half thick the largest sort and or foot high to the Branches which are large and spreading like an Oak with a pretty thick smooth darkgreen leaf shaped like that of a PlumbTree but larger The Nuts are inclosed in Cods as big as both a Man's Fists put together At the broad end of which there is a small tough limber stalk by which they hang pendulous from the Body of the Tree in all parts of it from top to bottom scattered at irregular distances and from the greater branches a little way up especially at the joints of them or partings where they hang thickest but never on the smaller boughs there may be ordinarily about or of these Cods upon a well bearing Tree and they have Crops of them in a year one in  December  but the best in  June  The Cod it self or Shell is almost half an Inch thick neither spongy nor woody but of a substance between both brittle yet harder than the Rind of a Lemmon like which its surface is grained or knobb'd but more course and unequal the Cods at first are of a darkgreen but the side of them next the Sun of a muddy red As they grow ripe the green turns to a fine bright yellow and the muddy to a more lively beautiful red very pleasant to the Eye They neither ripen nor are gathered at once but for three weeks or a month when the Season is the Overseers of the Plantations go every day about to see which are turned yellow cutting at once it may be not a∣bove one from a Tree The Cods thus gathered they lay in several heaps to sweat and then bursting the Shell with their hands they pull out the Nuts which are the only substance they contain having no stalk or pith among them and excepting that these Nuts lye in regular rows are placed like the grains of Maiz but sticking together and so close∣ly stowed that after they have been once separated  it would be hard to place them again in so narrow a compass There are generally near Nuts in a Cod in proportion to the greatness of which for it varies the Nuts are bigger or less When taken out they dry them in the Sun upon Mats spread of the Ground after which they need no more care having a thin hard skin of their own and much Oil which preserves them Salt water will not hurt them for we had our Baggs rotten lying in the bottom of our Ship and yet the Nuts never the worse They raise the young Trees of Nuts set with the great end downward in fine black Mould and in the same places where they are to bear which they do in or years time without the trouble of transplanting There are ordinarily of these Trees from to and upward in a Plantation or Cacao walk as they call them and they shelter the young Trees from the Weather with Plantains set about them for or years de∣stroying all the Pantains by such time the CacaoTrees are of a pretty good Body and able to endure the heat which I take to be the most pernicious to them of any thing for tho these Valleys lye open to the North Winds unless a little sheltered here and there by some Groves of Plantain Trees which are purposely set near the Shores of the several Bays yet by all that I could either observe or learn the Cacaos in this Country are never blighted as I have often known them to be in other places Ca∣cao Nuts are used as Money in the Bay of  Cam∣peachy  The chief Town of this Country is called  Carac∣cos  a good way within Land 'tis a large we we  y place where live most of the Owners of  se Cacaowalks that are in the Valleys by th  the Plantations being managed by Overseers  nd Negroes It is in a large Savannah Country  abounds with Cattle and a  Spaniard  of my acqu  ∣tance  a very sencible Man who hath been there tells me that 'tis very populous and he judges it to be times as big as  Corunna  an  Gallicia  The way to it is very steep and craggy over that ridge of Hills which I say closes up the Valleys and parti∣tion Hills of the Cacao Coast In this Coast it self the chief place is  la Guiare  a good Town close by the Sea and though it had but a bad Harbour yet it is much frequented by the  Spanish  Shipping for the  Dutch  and  English  Anchor in the sandy Bays that lie here and there in the mouths of seve∣ral Vallies and where there is a good riding The Town is open but hath a strong Fort yet both were taken some years since by Captain  Wright  and his Privateers 'Tis seated about or leagues to the Westward of Cape  Blanco  which Cape is the Eastermost boundary of this Coast of  Caraccos  Further Eastward about leagues is a great Lake or Branch of the Sea called  Laguna de Venezaela  about which are many rich Towns but the mouth of the Lake is so shallow that no Ship can enter Near this mouth is a place called  Comana  where the Privateers were once repulsed without daring to attempt it any more being the only place in the North Seas they attempted in vain for many years and the  Spaniards  since throw it in their teeth fre∣quently as a word of reproach or defiance to them Not far from that place is  Verina  a small Village and  Spanish  Plantation famous for its Tobacco reputed the best in the World  But to return to  Caraccos  all this Coast is subject to dry Winds generally North East which caus'd us to have scabby Lips and we always sound it thus and that in different Seasons of the year for I have been on this Coast several times In other respects it is very healthy and a sweet clear Air The  Spa∣niards  have Lookouts or Scouts on the Hills and Breastworks in the Valleys and most of  their Negroes are furnished with Arms also for de∣fence of the Bays The Dutch have a very profita∣ble Trade here almost to themselves I have known three or four great Ships at a time on the Coast each it may be of or Guns They carry hi∣ther all sorts of  European  Commodities especially Linnen making vast returns chiefly in Silver and Cacao And I have often wondred and regretted it that none of my own Countrymen find the way thither directly from  England  for our  Jamaicamen  trade thither indeed and find the sweet of it tho they carry  English  Commodities at second or third hand  While we lay on this Coast we went ashore in some of the Bays and took or Tun of Cacao and after that Barks one laden with Hides the second with  European  Commodities the third with Earthen ware and Brandy With these Barks we went again to the Island  Roca  's where we shared our Commodities and separated having Vessels enough to transport us all whither we thought most convenient Twenty of us for we were about took one of the Vessels and our share of the Goods and went directly for  Virginia  In our way thither we took several of the Sucking fishes for when we see them about the Ship we cast out a Line and Hook and they will take it with any manner of Bait whether Fish or Flesh the Suck¦ing fish is about the bigness of a large Whiting and much of the some shape toward the Tayl but the Head is flatter From the head to the middle of it  back there groweth a sort of flesh of a hard gristl  substance like that of the  Limpit  a Shellfish  tapering up piramidically which sticks to th  Rocks or like the head or mouth of a Shell Snai  but harder This Exerescence is of a flat oval for  about or inches long and or broad and r  ¦sing about half an inch high It is full of sma  ridges with which it will fasten it self to any thing that it meets with in the Sea just as a Snail doth to a Wall When any of them happen to come about a Ship they seldom leave her for they will feed on such filth as is daily thrown overboard or on meer Excrements When it is fair weather and but little wind they will play about the Ship but in blust∣ering weather or when the Ship sails quick they commonly fasten themselves to the Ships bottom from whence neither the Ships motion tho ne∣ver so swift nor the most tempestuous Sea can re∣move them They will likewise fasten themselves to any other bigger Fish for they never swim fast themselves if they meet with any thing to carry them I have found them sticking to a Shark after it was hal'd i  on the Deck though a Shark is so strong and boisterous a Fish and throws about him so vehemently for half an hour together it may be when caught that did not the Suckingfish stick at no ordinary rate it must needs be cast off by so much violence It is usual also to see them sticking to Tur∣tle to any old Trees Planks or the like that lie driving at Sea Any knobs or inequalities at a Ships bottom are a great hindrance to the swiftness of its sailing and or of these sticking to it must needs retard it as much in a manner as if its bottom were foul So that I am inclined to think that this Fish is the  Remora  of which the Ancients tell such stories if it be not I know no other that is and I leave the Reader to judge I have seen of these Suck∣ing fishes in great plenty in the Bay of  Campeachy  and in all the Sea between that and the Coast of  C  ces  as about those Islands particularly I have lately describ'd  Rocas Blanco Tortugas  c they have no scales and are very good meat  We met nothing else worth remark in our Voy∣age to  Virginia  where we arrived in  July  That Country is so well known to our Nation that  I shall say nothing of it nor shall I detain the Reader with the story of my own Affairs and the troubles that befel me during about months of my stay there but in the next Chapter enter im∣mediately upon my second Voyage into the  South Seas  and round

return to  England  by the way of the  Cape of good hope  I shall give my Reader this short Account of my first entrance upon it Among those who  accompanied Captain  Sharp  into the South Seas in our former Expedition and leaving him there re∣turned over Land as is said in the Introduction and in the st and d Chapters there was one Mr  Cook  an  English  Native of St  Christophers  a  Cirole  as we call all born of  European  Parents in the  WestIndies  He was a sensible man and had been some years a Privateer At our joining our selves with those Privateers we met at our coming again to the North Seas his lot was to be with Captain  Yanky  who kept company for some considerable time with Capt  Wright  in whose Ship I was and part∣ed with us at our d Anchoring at the Isle of  Tor∣tugas  as I have said in the last Chapter After our parting this Mr  Cook  being Quartermaster un∣der Captain  Yanky  the second place in the Ship according to the Law of Privateers laid claim to a Ship they took from the  Spaniards  and such of Captain  Yanky  's men as were so disposed particu∣larly all those who came with us over Land went aboard this Prize Ship under the new Capt  Cook  This destribution was made at the Isle of  Vacca  or the Isle of  Ash  as we call it and here they parted also such Goods as they had taken But Capt  Cook  having no Commission as Captain  Yanky  Captain  Tristian  and some other  French  Commanders had who lay then at that Island and they grutching the  English  such a Vessel they all joined together plun∣dered the  English  of their Ship Goods and Arms and turned them ashore Yet Capt  Tristian  took in about or of these  English  and carried them with him to  Petit Guavers  of which number Cap∣tain  Cook  was one and Capt  Davis  another who with the rest found means to seize the Ship as she lay at anchor in the Road Capt  Tristian  and many of his men being then ashore and the  English  sending ashore such  French  men as remained in the Ship and were mastered by them tho' superior in number  stood away with her immediately for the Isle of  Vac∣ca  before any notice of this surprize could reach the  French  Governor of that Isle so deceiving him also by a Stratagem they got on board the rest of their Countrymen wha had been left on that Island and going thence they took a Ship newly come from  France  laden with Wines They also took a Ship of good force in which they resolved to em∣bark themselves and make a new Expedition into the South Seas to cruise on the Coast of  Chili  and  Peru  But first they went for  Virginia  with their Prizes where they arrived the  April  after my co∣ming thither The best of the Prizes carried Guns this they fitted up there with Sails and eve∣ry thing necessary for so long a Voyage selling the Wines they had taken for such Provisions as they wanted My self and those of our Fellowtravellers over the Isthmus of  America  who came with me to  Virginia  the year before this most of which had since made a short Voyage to  Carolina  and again returned to  Virginia  resolved to joyn our selves to these new Adventurers and as many more engaged tn the same design as made our whole Crew consist of men So having furnished our selves with necessary Materials and agreed upon some particular Rules especially of Temperance and So∣briety by reason of the length of our intended Voy∣age we all went on board our Ship  August  We sailed from  Achamack  to  Virginia  under the command of Capt  Cook  bound for the South Seas I shall not trouble the Reader with an account of every days run but hasten to the less known parts of the World to give a de∣scription of 'em only relating such memorable Accidents as happened to us and such places as we touched at by the way  We met nothing worth observation till we came to the Islands of  Cape Verd  except a terrible Storm  which could not escape it This happen'd in a few days after we left  Virginia  with a S S E wind just in our Teeth The storm lasted above a week it drencht us all like so many drowned Rats and was one of the worst storms I ever was in One I met with in the  East Indies  was more violent for the time but of not above hours continuance Af∣ter that storm we had favourable winds and good weather and in short time we arrived at the Island  Sall  which is one of the Eastermost of the  Cape Verd  Islands Of these there are ten in number so con∣siderable as to bear distinct names and they lie se∣veral degrees off from  Cape Verd  in  Africk  whence they receive that Appellation taking up about deg of Longitude in breadth and about as many of Latitude in their length  viz  from near to North They are most inhabited by  Portuguese  Banditti This of  Sall  is an Island lying in the Lat of in Long deg m West from the  Lizard  in  England  stretching from North to South about or leagues and not above a league and an half or leagues wide It hath its name from the abun∣dance of Salt that is naturally congealed there the whole Island being full of large Saltponds The Land is very barren producing no Tree that I could see but some small shrubby Bushes by the Sea side Neither could I discern any Grass yet there are some poor Goats on it  I know not whether there are any other Beasts on the Island There are some wild Fowl but I judge not many I saw a few Flamingos which is a sort of large Fowl much like a Heron in shape but bigger and of a reddish colour They delight to keep together in great companies and feed in Mud or Ponds or in such places where there is not much Water They are very shy therefore it is hard to shoot them Yet I have lain obscured in the evening near a place where they resort and  with two more in my company have killed of them at once the first shot being made while they were standing on the ground the other two as they rose They build their Nests in shallow Ponds where there is much Mud which they scrape toge∣ther making little Hillocks like small Islands ap∣pearing out of the Water a foot and half high from the bottom They make the foundation of these Hillocks broad bringing them up tapering to the top where they leave a small hollow pit to lay their Eggs in and when they either lay their Eggs or hatch them they stand all the while not on the Hillock but close by it with their Legs on the ground and in the water resting themselves against the Hillock and covering the hollow Nest upon it with their Rumps For their Legs are very long and building thus as they do upon the ground they could neither draw their Legs conveniently in∣to their Nests nor sit down upon them otherwise than by resting their whole bodies there to the pre∣judice of their Eggs or their young were it not for this admirable contrivance which they have by na∣tural instinct They never lay more than two Eggs and seldom fewer They young ones cannot fly till they are almost full grown but will run prodigi∣ously fast yet we have taken many of them The Flesh of both young and old is lean and black yet very good meat tasting neither fishy nor any way unsavory Their Tongues are large having a large knob of fat at the root which is an excellent bit a Dish of  Flamingo  's Tongues being fit for a Princes Table  When many of them are standing together by a Ponds side being half a mile distant from a Man they appear to him like a Brick Wall their Feathers being of the colour of new red Brick and they commonly stand upright and single one by one exactly in a row except when feeding and close  by each other The young ones at first are of a light grey and as their Wingfeathers spring out they grow darker and never come to their right colour or any beautiful shape under or months old I have seen  Flamingos  at  Rio la Hacha  and at an Island lying near the Main of  America  right against  Querisao  called by Privateers  Flamingo  Key from the multitude of these Fowls that breed there and I never saw of their Nests and young but here  There are not above or Men on this Island of  Sall  and a poor Governor as they called him who came on board in our Boat and brought or poor lean Goats for a Present to our Captain tel∣ling him they were the best that the Island did afford The Captain minding more the poverty of the Giver than the value of the Present gave him in requital a Coat to cloath him for he had no∣thing but a few Rags on his back and an old Hat not worth farthings which yet I believe he wore but seldom for fear he should want before he might get another for he told us there had not been a Ship in years before We bought of him about bushels of Salt for a few old Cloaths and he begg'd a little Powder and Shot We stay'd here days in which time one of these  Partuguese  offered to some of our Men a lump of Ambergriese in ex∣change for some Cloaths desiring them to keep it secret for he said if the Governor should know it he should be hang'd At length one Mr  Coppinger  bought it for a small matter yet I believe he gave more than it was worth We had not a Man in the Ship that knew Ambergriese but I have since seen it in other places and therefore am certain it was not right It was of a dark colour like Sheeps Dung and very soft but of no smell and possibly 'twas some of their Goats Dung I afterwards saw some sold at the  Nequebars  in the  East Indies  which was of  a light colour but very hard neither had it any smell and this also I suppose was a cheat Yet it is certain that in both these places there is Am∣bergriese found  I was told by one  John Read  a  Bristol  Man that he was Prentice to a Master who traded to these Islands of  Cape Verd  and once as he was riding at an Anchor at  Fogo  another of these Islands there was a lump of it swam by the Ship and the Boat being ashoar he mist it but knew it to be Amber∣griese having taken up a lump swimming in the like manner the Voyage before and his Master ha∣ving at several times bought pieces of it of the Na∣tives of the Isle of  Fogo  so as to enrich himself thereby And so at the  Necquebars English  men have bought as I have been credibly informed great quantities of very good Ambergriese Yet the Inha∣bitants are so subtil that they will counterfeit it both there and here and I have heard that in the Gulph of  Florida  whence much of it comes the Native  Indians  there use the same Fraud  Upon this occasion I cannot omit to tell my Reader what I learnt from Mr  Hill  a Chyrurgeon upon his shewing me once a piece of Ambergriese which was thus One Mr  Benjamin Berker  a Man that I have been long well acquainted with and know him to be a very diligent and observing Per∣son and likewise very sober and credible told this Mr  Hill  that being in the Bay of  Honduras  to pro∣cure Logwood which grows there in great abun∣dance and passing in a Canoa over to one of the Islands in that Bay he found upon the shoar on a sandy Bay there a lump of Ambergriese so large that when carried to  Jamaica  he found it to weigh one hundred pound and upwards When he first found it it lay dry above the mark which the Sea then came to at highwater and he observed in it a great multitude of Beetles It was of a dusky co∣lour  towards black and about the hardness of mel∣low Cheese and of a very fragrant smell This that Mr  Hill  shewed me being some of it which Mr  Barker  gave him Besides those already mention'd all the places where I have heard that Ambergriese hath been found at  Bermudas  and the  Bahama  Islands in the  West Indies  and that part of the Coast of  Africk  with its adjacent Islands which reaches from  Mozambique  to the  Red Sea  We went from this Island of  Sall  to St  Nicholas  another of the  Cape Verd  Islands lying West South West from  Sall  about leagues We arrived there the next day after we left the other and An∣chored on the S E side of the Island This is a pretty large Island it is one of the biggest of all the  Cape Verd  and lieth in a triangular form The largest side which lieth to the East is about leagues long and the other two above leagues each It is a mountainous barren Island and rocky all round towards the Sea yet in the heart of it there are Valleys where the  Portuguese  which inha∣bit here have Vineyards and Plantations and Wood for fewed Here are many Goats which are but poor in comparison with those in other places yet much better than those at  Sall  There are likewise many Asses The Governor of this Island came aboard us with or Gentlemen more in his com∣pany who were all indifferently well cloathed and accoutred with Swords and Pistols but the rest that accompanied him to the Seaside which were about or Men more were but in a ragged garb The Governor brought aboard some Wine made in the Island which tasted much like  Madera  Wine It was of a pale colour and lookt thick He told us the chief Town was in a Valley mile from the Bay where we rode that he had there under him above one hundred Families besides other Inhabitants that lived scattering in Valleys more re∣more  They were all very swarthy the Gover∣nor was the clearest of them yet of a dark tawny complexion  At this Island we scrubb'd the bottom of our Ship and here also we dug Wells ashoar on the Bay and fill'd all our Water and after or days stay we went from hence to  Mayo  another of the  Cape Verd  Islands lying about mile East and by South from the other arriving there the next day and anchoring on the N W side of the Island We sent our Boat on shoar intending to have purchased some Provision as Beef or Goats with which this Island is better stock'd than the rest of the Islands But the Inhabitants would not suffer our Men to land for about a week before our arrival there came an  English  Ship the Men of which came ashoar pre∣tending friendship and seized on the Governour with some others and carrying them aboard made them send ashoar for Cattle to ransom their Liber∣ties and yet after this set sail and carried them away and they had not heard of them since The  English  Man that did this as I was afterwards in∣formed was one Capt  Bond  of  Bristol  VVhether ever he brought back those Men again I know not He himself and most of his Men have since gone over to the  Spaniards  and 'twas he who had like to have burnt our Ship after this in the Bay of  Pa∣nama  as I shall have occasion to relate  This Isle of  Mayo  is but small and invironed with sholes yet a place much frequented by shipping for its great plenty of Salt and though there is but bad landing yet many Ships lade here every year Here are plenty of Bulls Cows and Goats and at a certain season in the year  May June July  and  August  a sort of small Sea Tortoise come hither to lay their Eggs but these Turtle are not so sweet as those in the  West Indies  The inhabitants plant Corn Yams Potatoes and some Plantains and breed  a few Fowls living very poor yet much better than the Inhabitants of any other of these Islands  St Jago  excepted which lieth or leagues to the Westward of  Mayo  and is the chief the most fruit∣ful and best inhabited of all the Islands of  Cape Verd  yet mountainous and much barren Land in it  On the Eastside of the Isle  St Jago  is a good Port which in peaceable times especially is seldom without Ships for this hath long been a place which Ships have been wont to touch at for Water and Refreshments as those outwardbound to the  East Indies English French  and  Dutch  many of the Ships bound to the Coast of  Guinea  the  Dutch  to  Surinam  and their own  Portuguese  Fleet going for  Braziel  which is generally about the latter end of  Septemb  but few Ships call in here in their return for  Europe  When any Ships are here the Country People bring down their Commodities to sell to the Seamen and Passengers  viz  Bullocks Hogs Goats Fowls Eggs Plantains and Coco Nuts which they will give in exchange for Shirts Drawers Handker∣chiefs Hats Wastecoasts Britches or in a man∣ner for any sort of Cloath especially Linnen for Woollen is not much esteemed there They care not willingly to part with their Cattel of any sort but in exchange for Money or Linnen or some other valuable Commodity Travellers must have a care of these People for they are very thievish and if they see an opportunity will snatch any thing from you and run away with it We did not touch at this Island in this Voyage but I was there before this in the year when I saw a Fort here lying on the top of an Hill and com∣manding the Harbour  The Governor of this Island is chief over all the rest of the Islands I have been told that there are two large Towns on this Island some small Villages  and a great many Inhabitants and that they make a great deal of Wine such as is that of  St Nicholas  I have not been on any other of the  Cape Verd  Islands nor near them but have seen most of them at a distance They seem to be mountainous and batren some of these beforementioned being the most fruitful and most frequented by Strangers especilly  St Jago  and  Mayo  As to the rest of them  Fogo  and  Brava  are two small Islands lying to the Westward of  St Jago  but of little note only  Fogo  is remarkable for its being a  Vulcano  It is all of it one large Mountain of a good heighth out of the top whereof issue Flames of Fire yet only discerned in the night and then it may be seen a great way at Sea Yet this Island is not without inhabitants who live at the foot of the Mountain near the Sea Their substance is much the same as in the other Islands they have some Goats Fowls Plantains CocoNuts  c  as I am informed Of the Plan∣tains and CocoNuts I shall have occasion to speak when I come into the  East Indies  and shall defer the giving an account of them till then  The remainder of these Islands of  Cape Verd  are  St Anthonia St Lucia St Vincente  and  BonaVista  of which I know nothing considerable  Our entrance among these Islands was from the North East for in our passage from  Virginia  we ran pretty far toward the Coast of  Gualata  in  Africk  to preserve the Tradewind lest we should be born off too much to the Westward and so lose the Islands We anchored at the South of  Sall  and passing by the South of  St Nicholas  anchored again at  Mayo  as hath been said where we made the shorter stay because we could get no Flesh among the Inhabitants by reason of the regret they had at their Governor and his Mens being carried away by Captain  Bond  So leaving the Isles of  Cape Verd  we stood away to the Southward with the Wind at E N E intending to  have touched no more till we came to the Streights of  Magellan  But when we came into the lat of deg North we met the Wind at S by W and S S W therefore we altered our Resolutions and steered away for the Coast of  Guinea  and in few days came to the Mouth of the River of  Sherbor    which is an  English  Factory lying South of  Sierra Liona  We had one of our Men who was well ac∣quainted there and by his direction we went in among the shoals and came to an Anchor  Sherboro  was a good way from us so I can give no account of the place or our Factory there save that I have been informed that there is a considerable Trade driven there for a sort of red Wood for dying which grows in that Country very plentifully  called by our people  Camwood  A little within the shoar where we anchored was a Town of Negroes Natives of this Coast It was skreen'd from our sight by a large Grove of Trees that grew between them and the shoar but we went thither to them several times during the or days of our stay here to refresh our selves and they as often came aboard us bringing with them Plantains SugarCanes Palmwines Rice Fowls and Honey which they sold us They were no way shy of us being well ac∣quainted with the  English  by reason of our  Guinea  Factories and Trade This Town seem'd pretty large the Houses but low and ordinary but one great House in the midst of it where their chief Men meet and receive Strangers and here they treated us with Palmwine As to their Persons  they are like other Negroes While we lay he  we scrubb'd the bottom of our Ship and then fill  all our Water casks and buying up two Puncheo  of Rice for our Voyage we departed from hen  about the m  le of  November  prosecuti  our inten  towards the  Streights  of  Mage¦lan  We had but little wind after we got out and very hot weather with some fierce Tornadoes commonly rising out of the N E which brought Thunder Lightening and Rain These did not last long sometimes not a quarter of an hour and then the Wind would shuffle about to the Southward again and fall flat calm for these Tornadoes commonly come against the Wind that is then blowing as our Thunderclouds are often observed to do in  Eng∣land  but the Tornadoes I shall describe more large∣ly in my Chapter of Winds in the Appendix to this Book At this time many of our Men were taken with Fevers yet we lost but one While we lay in the calms we caught several great Sharks some∣times or in a day and eat them all boyling and squeezing them dry and then stewing them with Vinegar Pepper  c  for we had but little Flesh a∣board We took the benefit of every Tornado which came sometimes or in a day and carried what sail we could to get to the Southward for we had but little Wind when they were over and those  all Winds between the Tornadoes were much a∣  inst us at S by E and S S E till we past the  uinorial Line which we crost about a degree to  e Eastward of the Meridian of the Isle of  St Jago  e of the  Cape Verd  Islands  At first we could scarce lie S W but being got a degree to the Southward of the Line the Wind  r'd most Easterly and then we stemm'd S W  y S and as we got farther to the Southward so  e Wind came about to the Eastward and freshened  us In the Lat of S we had the Wind at  in the Lat of we had it at E S E where  stood a considerable time and blew a fresh Top∣  nt gale We then made the best use of it steer∣  g on briskly with all the sail we could make  this wind by the th of  Jan  carried us into the  of  South In all this time we met with  nothing worthy remark not so much as a Fish ex∣cept Flying Fish which have been so often descri∣bed that I think it needless for me to do it  Here we found the Sea much changed from its natural greenness to a white or palish colour which caused us to sound supposing we might strike ground for whenever we find the colour of the Sea to change we know we are not far from Land or shoals which stretch out into the Sea running from some Land But here we found no ground with one hundred fathom Line I was this day at noon by reckoning d m West from the  Lizard  the variation by our morning amplitude d m East the variation encreasing The th day one of our Chyrurgeons died much lament∣ed because we had but one more for such a dange∣rous Voyage  January  We made the  Sibbel de Wards  which are Islands lying in the lat of d m South and longitude West from the  Lizard  in  England  by my account d m the variation here we found to be d m I had for a month before we came hither endeavoured to perswade Captain  Cook  and his Company to anchor at these Islands  where I told them we might probably get water a  I then thought and in case we should miss of i  here yet by being good Husbands of what we had  we might reach  John Fernando  's in the  South Seas  before our water was spent This I urged to hinde  their designs of going through the Streights of  Ma¦gellan  which I knew would prove very dangerou  to us the rather because our men being Privateers and so more wilful and less under command woul  not be so ready to give a watchful attendance in  passage so little known For altho these men we  more under command than I had ever seen an  Privateers yet I could not expect to find them a  a minutes call in coming to an Anchor or weigh+  ing Anchor Beside if ever we should have occa∣sion to moor or cast out two Anchors we had not a Boat to carry out or weigh an Anchor These Islands of  Sibbel de Wards  were so named by the Dutch They are all three rocky barren Islands with∣out any Tree only some Dildobushes growing on them And I do believe there is no Water on any one of them for there was no appearance of any Water The two Northernmost we could not come near but the Southermost we came close by but could not strike ground till within Cables length of the shore and there found it to be foul rocky Ground  From the time that we were in deg South till we came to these Islands we had the Wind be∣tween E N E and the N N E fair weather and a brisk gale The day that we made these Islands we saw great sholes of small Lobsters which co∣loured the Sea red in spots for a mile in compass and we drew some of them out of the Sea in our Waterbuckets They were no bigger than the top of a Man's little Finger yet all their Claws both great and small like a Lobster I never saw any of this sort of Fish naturally red but here for ours on the  English  Coast which are black naturally are not red till they are boiled Neither did I ever any where else meet with any Fish of the Lobstershape so small as these unless it may be Shrimps or Prawns Capt  Swan  and Capt  Eaton  met also with sholes of this Fish in much the same Latitude and Longitude  Leaving therefore the  Sibbel de Wards  Islands as having neither good Anchorage nor Water we sailed on directing our Course for the Streights of  Magellan  But the Winds hanging in the Wester  board and blowing hard oft put us by our Topsails so that we could not fetch it The th day of  Fe∣bruary  we fell in with the Streights  Le Mair  which  is very high Land on both sides and the Streights very narrow We had the Wind at N N W a fresh gale and seeing the Opening of the Streights we ran in with it till within four Mile of the Mouth and then it fell calm and we found a strong Tide setting out of the Streights to the Northward and like to founder our Ship but whether flood or ebb I know not only it made such a short cockling Sea as if it had been in a Race or place where two Tides meet for it ran every way sometimes break∣ing in over our waste sometimes over our Poop sometimes over our Bow and the Ship tossed like an Eggshell so that I never felt such uncertain Jerks in a Ship At a clock in the Evening we had a small Breeze at W N W and steered away to the Eastward intending to go round the  States Island  the East end of which we reached the next day by Noon having a fresh Breeze all Night  The th day at Noon being off the East end of  States Island  I had a good observation of the Sun and found my self in lat d m South  At the East end of  States Island  are three small Islands or rather Rocks pretty high and white with the Dung of Fowls Wherefore having ob∣served the Sun we haled up South designing to pass round to the Southward of Cape  Horne  which is the Southermost Land of  Terra del Fuego  The Winds hung in the Western quarter betwixt the N W and the West so that we could not get much to the Westward and we never saw  Terra del Fuego  after that Evening that we made the Streight  Le Mair  I have heard that there have been Smokes and Fires on  Terra del Fuego  not on the tops of Hills but in Plains and Valleys seen by those who have sailed thro' the Streights of  Magellan  supposed to be made by the Natives  We did not see the Sun at rising or setting in or∣der to take an amplitude after we left the  Sibbel de  Wards  till we got into the South Sea Therefore I know not whether the variation increased any more or no Indeed I had an observation of the Sun at Noon in lat d m and we were then standing to the Southward with the Wind at W by N and that Night the Wind came about more to the Southward of the West and we tackt I was then in lat by reckoning which was the farthest South lat that ever I was in  The th day of  Feb  being in lat and to the West of Cape  Horne  we had a violent Storm which held us till the d day of  March  blowing com∣monly S W and S W by W and W S W thick Weather all the time with small drizling Rain but not hard We made a shift however to save Bar∣rels of Rainwater besides what we drest our Victuals withal  March  the d the Wind shifted at once and came about at South blowing a fierce gale of Wind soon after it came about to the Eastward and we stood into the South Seas  The th day having an observation of the Sun not having seen it of late we found our selves in lat d m and the variation to be but d m East  The Wind stood at S E we had fair Weather and a moderate Gale and the th day we were in lat by Observation and then found the variation to be but d East  The th day when we looked out in the Morn∣ing we saw a Ship to the Southward of us coming with all the Sail she could make after us We lay  uzled to let her come up with us for we supposed her to be a  Spanish  Ship come from  Baldivia  bound to  Lima  we being now to the Northward of  Baldivia  and this being the time of the year when Ships that Trade thence to  Baldivia  return Home They had the same opinion of us and therefore made sure to  take us but coming nearer we both found ourmistakes This proved to be one Capt  Eaton  in a Ship sent purposely from  London  for the  South Seas  We haled each other and the Capt came on Board and told us of his Actions on the Coast of  Brazil  and in the Ri∣ver of  Plate  He met Captain  Swan  one that came from  Eng∣land  to Trade here at the East Entrance into the Streights of  Magellan  and they accompanied each other thro' the Streights and were separated after they were thro' by the Sto rm beforementioned Both we and Capt  Eaton  being bound for  John Fernando  's Isle we kept Company and we spared him Bread and Beef and he spared us Water which he took in as he passed thro' the  Streights  March  the d we came in sight of the Island and the next day got in and anchored in a Bay at the South end of the Island in fathom Water not two Cables lengths from the shore We presently got out our Canoa and went ashore to see for a  Moskito Indian  whom we left here when we were chased hence by  Spanish  Ships in the year a little before we went to  Arica  Capt  Watlin  being then our Commander after Capt  Sharp  was turn'd out  This  Indian  lived here alone above years and altho' he was several time sought after by the  Spa∣niards  who knew he was left on the Island yet they could never find him He was in the Woods hunting for Goats when Capt  Watlin  drew off his Men and the Ship was under sail before he came back to shore He had with him his Gun and a Knife with a small Horn of Powder and a few Shot which being spent he contrived a way by notching his Knife to saw the Barrel of his Gun into small Pieces wherewith he made Harpoons Lances Hooks and a long Knife heating the pieces first in the fire which he struck with his Gun∣flint  and a piece of the Barrel of his Gun which he hardned having learnt to do that among the  English  The hot pieces of Iron he would hammer out and bend as he pleased with Stones and saw them with his jagged Knife or grind them to an Edge by long labour and harden them to a good temper as there was occasion All this may seem strange to those that are not acquainted with the sagacity of the  In∣dians  but it is no more than these  Moskito  Men are accustomed to in their own Country where they make their own Fishing and striking Instruments without either Forge or Anvil tho' they spend a great deal of time about them  Other wild  Indians  who have not the use of Iron which the  Moskito  Men have from the  English  make Hatchets of a very hard Stone with which they will cut down Trees the CottonTree especially which is a soft tender Wood to build their Houses or make Canoas and tho' in working their Canoas hollow they cannot dig them so neat and thin yet they will make them fit for their Service This their Digging or Hatchetwork they help out by Fire whether for the felling of the Trees or for the making the inside of their Canoa hollow These Contrivances are used particularly by the Savage  In∣dians  of  Blewfield  's River described in the d Chap∣ter whose Canoas and StoneHatchets I have seen These StoneHatchets are about Inches long bread and Inches thick in the middle They are grownd away flat and sharp at both ends Right in the midst and clear round it they make a notch so wide and deep that a Man might place his Fin∣ger along it and taking a stick or withe about foot long they bind it round the Hatchethead in that notch and so twisting it hard use it as an handle or helve the head being held by it very fast Nor are other wild  Indians  less ingenious Those of  Patagonia  particularly head their Arrows  with Flint cut or ground which I have seen and admired But to return to our  Moskito  Man on the Isle of  J Fernando  With such Instruments as he made in that manner he got such Provision as the Island afforded either Goats or Fish He told us that at first he was forced to eat Seal which is very ordinary Meat before he had made hooks but afterwards he never killed any Seals but to make Lines cutting their Skins into Thongs He had a little House or Hut half a mile from the Sea which was lined with Goats Skin his Couch or Barbecu of Sticks lying along about foot distant from the Ground was spread with the same and was all his Bedding He had no Cloaths left having worn out those he brought from  Waltin  's Ship but only a Skin about his Waste He saw our Ship the day before we came to an Anchor and did believe we were  English  and therefore kill'd Goats in the Morning before we came to an Anchor and drest them with Cabbage to treat us when we came a∣shore He came then to the Sea side to cogratulate our safe arrival And when we landed a  Moskito Indian  named  Robin  first leap'd ashore and running to his Brother  Moskito  Man threw himself flat on his face at his feet who helping him up and em∣bracing him fell flat with his face on the Ground at  Robin  's feet and was by him taken up also We stood with pleasure to behold the suprize and ten∣derness and solemnity of this interview which was exceedingly affectionate on both sides and when their Ceremonies of Civility were over we also that stood gazing at them drew near each of us embracing him we had found here who was over∣joyed to see so many of his old Friends come hither as he thought purposely to fetch him He was named  Will  as the other was  Robin  These were names given them by the  English  for they have no Names among themselves and they take it as a great favour to be  named by any of us and will complain for want of it if we do not appoint them some name when they are with us saying of themselves they are poor Men and have no Name  This Island is in lat d m and about leagues from the Main It is about leagues round full of high Hills and small pleasant Valleys which if manured would probably produce any thing proper for the Climate The sides of the Moun∣tains are part Savannahs part Woodland Savannahs are clear pieces of Land without Woods not be∣cause more barren than the Woodland for they are frequently spots of as good Land as any and often are intermixt with Woodland In the Bay of  Campeachy  are very large Savannahs which I have seen full of Cattle But about the River of  Plate  are the largest that every I heard of or Miles in length and  Jamaica Cuba  and  Hispaniola  have many Savannahs intermixt with Woods Places cleared of Wood by Art and Labour do not go by this Name but those only which are found so in the uninhabited parts of  America  such as this Isle of  John Fernando's  or which were originally clear in other parts  The Grass in these Savannahs at  John Fernando  's is not a long flaggy Grass such as is usually in the Sa∣vannahs in the  WestIndies  but a sort of kindly Grass both thick and flourishing the biggest part of the year The Woods afford divers sorts of Trees some large and good Timber for Building but none fit for Masts The Cabbage Trees of this Isle are but small and low yet afford a good head and the Cabbage very sweet This Tree I shall describe in the Appendix in the Bay of  Campeachy  The Savannahs are stocked with Goats in great Herds but those that live on the East end of the Island are not so fat as those on the West end for though there is much more Grass and plenty of  Water in every Valley nevertheless they thrive not so well here as on the Westend where there is less Food and yet there are found greater Flocks and those too fatter and sweeter  That West end of the Island is all high Champi∣on Ground without any Valley and but one place to land there is neither Wood nor any fresh Water and the Grass short and dry  Goats were first put on the Island by  John Fer∣nando  who first discovered it in his Voyage from  Lima  to  Baldivia  and discovered also another Island about the same bigness leagues to the Westward of this From those Goats these were propagated and the Island hath taken its Name from this its first Discoverer who when he returned to  Lima  de∣sired a Patent for it designing to settle here and it was in his second Voyage hither that he set ashore or Goats which have since by their increase so well stock'd the whole Island But he could never get a Patent for it therefore it lies still destitute of Inhabitants tho' doubtless capable of maintaining or Families by what may be produced off the Land only I speak much within compass for the Savannahs would at present feed Head of Cattle  Goats and the Land being cultivated would probably bear Corn or Wheat and good Pease Yams or Potatoes for the Land in their Valleys and sides of the Mountains is of a good black fruitful Mould The Sea about it is likewise very productive of its Inhabitants  Seals  swarmas thick about this Island as if they had no other place in the World to live in for there is not a Bay nor Rock that one can get ashoar on but is full of them  Sea Lyons  are here in great Companies and Fish par∣ticularly Snappers and Rockfish are so plentiful that two Men in an hours time will take with Hook and Line as many as will serve Men  The  Seals  are a sort of Creatures pretty well known yet it may not be amiss to describe them They are as big as Calves the Head of them like a Dog therefore called by the  Dutch  the  Seahounds  Under each Shoulder grows a long thick Fin These serve them to swim with when in the Sea and are instead of Legs to them when on the Land for raising their Bodies up on end by the help of these Fins or Stumps and so having their Tailparts drawn close under them they rebound as it were and throw their Bodies forward drawing their hinder parts after them and then again rising up and springing forward with their foreparts alternately they lie tumbling thus up and down all the while they are moving on Land From their Shoulders to their Tails they grow tapering like Fish and have two small Fins on each side the Rump which is commonly covered with their Fins These Fins serve instead of a Tail in the Sea and on Land they sit on them when they give suck to their young Their Hair is of divers Colours as black grey dun spotted looking very sleek and pleasant when they come first out of the Sea For these at  John Fernan∣do  's have fine thick short Furr the like I have not taken notice of any where but in these Seas Here are always thousands I might say possibly millions of them either sitting on the Bays or going and coming in the Sea round the Island which is co∣vered with them as they lie at the top of the Wa∣ter playing and sunning themselves for a mile or two from the shore When they come out of the Sea they bleat like Sheep for their young and though they pass through hundreds of others young ones before they come to their own yet they will not suffer any of them to suck The young ones are like Puppies and lie much ashore but when beaten by any of us they as well as the old ones will make towards the Sea and swim very swift  and nimble tho' on shore they lie very sluggishly and will not go out of our ways unless we beat them but snap at us A blow on the Nose soon kills them Large Ships might here load themselves with Seals Skins and Traneoyl for thy are extra∣ordinary fat Seals are found as well in cold as hot Climates and in the cold places they love to get on Lumps of Ice where they will lie and sun them∣selves as here on the Land They are frequent in the Northern parts of  Europe  and  America  and in the Southern parts of  Africa  as about the  Cape of Good Hope  and at the  Streights of Magellan  And tho' I never saw any in the  WestIndies  but in the Bay of  Campeachy  at certain Islands called the  Alceranes  and at others called the  Desarts  yet they are over all the  American  Coast of the  SouthSeas  from  Terra del Fuego  up to the Equinoctial Line but to the North of the Equinox again in these Seas I never saw any till as far as North lat Nor did I ever see any in the  EastIndies  In general they seem to re∣sort where there is plenty of Fish for that is their Food and Fish such as they feed on as Cods Groopers  c  are most plentiful on rocky Coasts and such is mostly this Western Coast of the South  America  as I shall further relate  The  SeaLion  is a large Creature about or foot long The biggest part of his Body is as big as a Bull It is shaped like a  Seal  but times as big The Head is like a Lion's Head it hath a broad Face with many long Hairs growing about its Lips like a Cat It has a great goggle Eye the Teeth Inches long about the bigness of a Man's Thumb In Capt  Sharp  's time some of our Men made Dice with them They have no Hair on their Bodies like the  Seal  they are of a dun colour and are all extraor∣dinary fat one of them being cut up and boiled will yield a Hogshead of Oil which is very sweet and wholsome to fry Meat withal The lean Flesh  is black and of a course Grain yet indifferent good Food They will lie a week at a time ashore if not disturbed Where or or more of them come a∣shore together they huddle one on another like Swine and grunt like them making a hideous noise They eat Fish which I believe is their com∣mon Food  The  Snapper  is a Fish much like a  Roach  but a great deal bigger It hath a large Head and Mouth and great Gills The Back is of a bright red the Belly of a Silver Colour The Scales are as broad as a Shilling The  Snapper  is excellent Meat They are in many places in the  WestIndies  and the  SouthSeas  I have not seen them any where beside  The  Rockfish  is called by Seamen a  Grooper  the  Spaniards  call it a  Baccalao  which is the name for Cod because it is much like it It is rounder than the  Snapper  of a dark brown colour and hath small Scales no bigger than a Silverpenny This Fish is good sweet Meat and is found in great plenty on all the Coast of  Peru  and  Chili  There are only two Bays in the whole Island where Ships may anchor these are both at the Eastend and in both of them is a Rivolet of good fresh Water Either of these Bays may be fortified with little charge to that degree that Men in each may be able to keep off and there is no com∣ing into these Bays from the Westend but with great difficulty over the Mountains where if Men are placed they may keep down as many as come a∣gainst them on any side This was partly experien∣ced by  Englishmen  that Capt  Davis  left here who defended themselves against a great Body of  Spani∣ards  who landed in the Bays and came here to de∣stroy them and tho' the second time one of their Consorts deserted and fled to the  Spaniards  yet the other kept their Ground and were afterward ta∣ken in from hence by Capt  Strong  of  London  We remained at  John Fernando  's days our sick Men were ashore all the time and one of Captain  Eaton  's Doctors for he had four in his Ship tending and feeding them with Goat and several Herbs whereof here is plenty growing in the Brooks and their Diseases were chiefly Scor∣butick  CHAP V  The Author

of which he died a while after and Captain  Eaton  's Our passage lay now along the  Pacifick Sea  properly so called For tho' it be usual with our Mapmakers to give that Name to this whole O∣cean calling it  Mare Australe Mal del Zur  or  Mare Pacificum  yet in my opinion the Name of the  Pacifick Sea  ought not to be extended from South to North farther than from to about deg South Latitude and from the  American  shore Westward indefinitely with respect to my observation who have been in these parts Leagues or more from Land and still had the Sea very quiet from Winds For in all this Tract of Water of which I have spoken there are no dark rainy Clouds tho' often a thick Horizon so as to hinder an Observation of the Sun with the Quadrant and in the Morning hazy weather frequently and thick Mists but scarce able to wet one Nor are there in this Sea any Winds but the Tradewind no Tempest no Tornadoes or Hurricanes tho' North of the Equator they are met with as well in this Ocean as in the Atlantick yet the Sea it self at the new and full of the Moon runs with high large long Surges but such as never break out at Sea and so are safe enough unless that where they fell in and break upon the Shore they make it bad landing  In this Sea we made the best of our way toward the Line till in the lat of S where we fell in with the main Land of the  South America  All this course of the Land both of  Chili  and  Pern  is vastly high therefore we kept or leagues off from shore being unwilling to be seen by the  Spaniards  dwelling there The Land especially beyond this from deg S Lat and from to is of a most prodigious heighth It lies generally in Ridges parallel to the shore and or Ridges one with another each surpassing other in heighth  and those that are farthest within Land are much higher than others They always appear blue when seen at Sea sometimes they are obscur'd with Clouds but not so often as the high Lands in other parts of the World for here are seldom or never any Rains on these Hills any more than in the Sea near it neither are they subject to Fogs These are the high∣est Mountains that ever I saw far surpassing the  Pike  of  Tenariffe  or  Santa Martha  and I believe any Mountains in the World  I have seen very high Land in the Lat of South but not so high as in the Latitudes before described In Sir  John Narborough  's Voyage also to  Baldivia  a City on this Coast mention is made of very high Land seen near  Baldivia  and the  Spa∣niards  with whom I have discoursed have told me that there is a very high Land all the way between  Coquimbo  which lies in about d South lat and  Baldivia  which is in South so that by all likeli∣hood these Ridges of Mountains do run in a conti∣nued Chain from one end of  Peru  and  Chili  to the other all along this SouthSea Coast called usually the  Andes  or  Sierra Nuevada des Andes  The excessive heighth of these Mountains may possibly be the reason that there are no Rivers of note that fall in∣to these Seas Some small Rivers indeed there are but very few of them for in some places there is not one that comes out into the Sea in or Leagues and where they are thickest they are or Leagues asunder and too little and shallow to be Navigable Besides some of these do not con∣stantly run but are dry at certain Seasons of the Year as the River of  Ylo  runs flush with a quick Current at the latter end of  January  and so con∣tinues till  June  and then it decreaseth by degrees growing less and running slow till the latter end of  September  when it fails wholly and runs no more till  January  again This I have seen at both Sea∣sons  in former Voyages I made hither and have been informed by the  Spaniards  that other Rivers on this Coast are of the like Nature being rather Torrents or Landfloods caused by their Rains at cer∣tain Seasons far within Land than perennial streams  We kept still along in sight of this Coast but at a good distance from it encountring with nothing of note till in the lat of deg min South on the d of  May  we descried a Sail to the Northward of us She was plying to Windward we chased her and Capt  Eaton  being a head soon took her She came from  Guiaquil  about a Month before laden with Timber and was bound to  Lima  Three days before we took her she came from  Santa  whither she had gone for Water and where they had news of our being in these Seas by an express from  Baldi∣via  for as we afterwards heard Capt  Swan  had been at  Baldivia  to seek a Trade there and he having met Capt  Eaton  in the Streights of  Magellan  the  Spaniards  of  Baldivia  were doubtless informed of us by him suspecting him also to be one of us tho' he was not Upon this News the Viceroy of  Lima  sent Expresses to all the Sea Ports that they might pro∣vide themselves against our Assaults  We immediately steered away for the Island  Lobos  which lieth in lat d m South lat I took the Elevation of it ashore with an Astrolabe and it is leagues from the Main It is called  Lobos de la Mar  to distinguish it from another that is not far from it and extreamly like it called  Lobos de la Terra  for it lies nearer the Main  Lobos  or  Lovos  is the  Spanish  Name for a Seal of which there are great plenty about these and several other Islands in these Seas that go by this Name  The th of  May  we arrived at this Isle of  Lobos de la Mar  and came to an anchor with our Prize This  Lobos  consists indeed of two little Islands each a∣bout a Mile round of an indifferent heighth a  small Channel between fit for Boats only and se∣veral Rocks lying on the North side of the Islands a little way from shoar There is a small Cove or SandyBay sheltred from the Winds at the West end of the Eastermost Island where Ships may Carreen The rest of the shoar as well round the two Islands as between them is a Rocky Coast consisting of small Cliffs Within Land they are both of them partly Rocky and partly Sandy Barren without any fresh Water Tree Shrub Grass or Herbs or any Land Animals for the Seals and SeaLions come ashoar here but Fowls Of which there are great multitudes as  Boobies  but mostly  Penguins  which I have seen plentifully all over the  South Seas  on the Coast of  Newfoundland  and of the  Cape of Good Hope  They are a SeaFowl about as big as a Duck and such Feet but a sharp Bill feeding on Fish They do not fly but flutter having rather stumps like a young Goslin's than Wings And these are instead of Fins to them in the Water Their Feathers are Downy Their flesh is but ordi∣nary Food but their Eggs are good Meat There is another sort of small black Fowl that make holes in the Sand for their Night Habitations whose flesh is good sweet meat I never saw any of them but here and at  John Fernando  's  There is good Riding between the Eastermost Island and the Rocks in ten twelve or fourteen Fathom for the Wind is commonly at S or S S E and the Eastermost Island lying East and West shel∣ters that Road  Here we scrubb'd our Ships and being in a readi∣ness to sail the Prisoners were examined to know if any of them could conduct us to some Town where we might make some attempt for they had before informed us that we were descried by the  Spaniards  and by that we knew that they would send no Riches by Sea so long as we were here Many  Towns were considered on as  Guiaquil Zana Trux∣illo  and others At last  Truxillo  was pitched on as the most important therefore the likeliest to make us a Voyage if we could conquer it which we did not much question though we knew it to be a very populous City But the greatest difficulty was in landing for  Guanchaquo  which is the near∣est Seaport to it but miles off is an ill place to Land since sometimes the very Fishermen that live there are not able to go in or days How∣ever the th of  May  in the Afternoon our Men were mustered of both Ships Companies and their Arms proved We were in all Men fit for ser∣vice besides the sick and the next day we intend∣ed to sail and take the  Wood  Prize with us But the next day one of our Men being ashoar betimes on the Island descried three Sail bound to the North∣ward two of them without the Island to the West∣ward the other between it and the Continent  We soon got our Anchors up and chased and Captain  Eaton  who drew the least draught of Wa∣ter put through between the WestermostIsland and the Rocks and went after those two that were with∣out the Islands We in Captain  Cook's  Ship went after the other which stood in for the MainLand but we soon fetched her up and having taken her stood in again with her to the Island for we saw that Captain  Eaton  wanted no help having taken both those that he went after He came in with one of his Prizes but the other was so far to Leeward and so deep that he could not then get her in but he hoped to get her in the next day but being deep laden as designed to go down before the wind to  Panama  she would not bear sail  The th day she turned all day but got nothing nearer the Island Our  Moskitostrikers  according to their custom went and struck six Turtles for here are indifferent plenty of them These Ships  that we took the day before we came from  Guancha∣quo  all three laden with Flower bound for  Pana∣ma  Two of them were laden as deep as they could swim the other was not above half laden but was ordered by the ViceRoy of  Lima  to sail with the other two or else she should not sail till we were gone out of the Seas for he hoped they might escape us by setting out early In the biggest Ship was a Letter to the President of  Panama  from the ViceRoy of  Lima  assuring him that there were Enemies come into that Sea for which reason he had dispatched these three Ships with Flower that they might not want for  Panama  is supplied from  Peru  and desired him to be frugal of it for he knew not when he should send more In this Ship were likewise or Tuns of Marmalade of Quinces and a stately Mule sent to the President and a very large Image of the Virgin  Mary  in Wood carved and painted to adorn a new Church at  Panama  and sent from  Lima  by the ViceRoy for this great Ship came from thence not long before She brought also from  Lima  Pieces of Eight to carry withher to  Panama  but while she lay at  Guanchaco  taking in her lading of Flower the Merchants hearing of Capt  Swan  's being at  Baldivia  order'd the Money ashoar a∣gain These Prisoners likewise informed us that the Gentlemen Inhabitants of  Truxillo  were building a Fort at  Guanchaquo  which is the SeaPort for  Truxil∣lo  close by the Sea purposely to hinder the designs of any that should attempt to land there Upon this news we altered our former resolutions and resol∣ved to go with our three Prizes to the  Gallapagos  which are a great many large Islands lying some under the Equator others on each side of it I shall here omit the description of  Truxillo  because in my Appendix at the latter end of the Book I intend to give a general Relation of most of the Towns of note on this Coast from  Baldivia  to  Panama  and from thence towards  California  The th day in the evening we sailed from the Island  Lobos  with Captain  Eaton  in our Company We carried the three Flower Prizes with us but our first Prize Laden with Timber we left here at an Anchor the Wind was at S by E which is the common TradeWind here and we steered away N W by N intending to run into the latitude of the Isles  Gallapagos  and steer off West because we did not know the certain distance and therefore could not shape a direct Course to them When we came within minutes of the Equator we steer'd West having the Wind at South a very moderate gentle Gale It was the st day of  May  when we first had sight of the Islands  Gallapagos  Some of them appeared on our Weatherbow some on our Leebow others right a head We at first sight trimm'd our Sails and steered as nigh the Wind as we could striving to get to the Southermost of them but our Prizes being deep laden their Sails but small and thin and a very small Gale they could not keep up with us therefore we likewise edged away again a point from the Wind to keep near them and in the evening the Ship that I was in and Captain  Eaton  Anchored on the Eastside of one of the Eastermost Islands a Mile from the shoar in sixteen fathom Water clean white hard Sand  The  Gallapagos  Islands are a great Number of un∣inhabited Islands lying under and on both sides of the Equator The Fastermost of them are about Leagues from the Main They are laid down in the Longitude of reaching to the Westward as far as therefore their Longitude from  England  Westward is about degrees But I believe our Hy∣drographers do not place them far enough to the Westward The  Spaniards  who first discovered them and in whose draughts alone they are laid down re∣port them to be a great number stretching NorthWest  from the Line as far as degrees N but we saw not above or They are some of them or leagues long and or broad They are of a good heighth most of them flat and even on the top or of the Eastermost are rocky barren and hilly producing neither Tree Herb nor Grass but a few Dildotrees except by the Sea side The Dildotree is a green prickly Shrub that grows a∣bout or foot high without either Leaf or Fruit It is as big as a Man's Leg from the root to the top and it is full of sharp prickles growing in thick rows from top to bottom this shrub is fit for no use not so much as to burn Close by the Sea there grows in some places bushes of Burton Wood which is very good firing This sort of Wood grows in many places in the  WestIndies  especially in the Bay of  Campeachy  and in the  Sambaloes  I did never see any in these Seas but here There is Water on these barren Islands in Ponds and Holes among the Rocks Some other of these Islands are mostly plain and low and the Land more fertile producing Trees of divers sorts unknown to us Some of the Westermost of these Islands are nine or ten leagues long and six or seven broad the Mould deep and black These produce Trees of great and tall bo∣dies especially Mammeetrees which grow here in great Groves In these large Islands there are some pretty big Rivers and on many of the other lesser Islands there are Brooks of good Water The  Spa∣niards  when they first discovered these Islands found multitudes of Guanoes and Landturtle or Tortoise and named them the  Gallapago's  Islands I do be∣lieve there is no place in the World that is so plen∣tifully stored with these Animals The Guanoes here are as fat and large as any that ever I saw they are so tame that a Man may knock down twenty in an hours time with a Club The Land∣turtle are here so numerous that or men might  subsist on them alone for several months without any other sort of Provision They are extraordinary large and fat and so sweet that no Pullet eats more pleasantly One of the largest of these Creatures will weigh or weight and some of them are foot or foot Inches over the Challapee or Belly I did never see any but at this place that will weigh above Pound weight I have heard that at the Isle of St  Lawrence  or  Madagascar  and at the  English  Forest an Island near it called also  Do  Mascarin  and now possessed by the  French  there are very large ones but whether so big fat and sweet as these I know not There are or sorts of these Creatures in the  WestIndies  One is called by the  Spaniards Hecatee  these live most in fresh Water∣ponds and seldom come on Land They weigh about or pound they have small Legs and flat Feet and small long Necks Another sort is called  Tenapen  these are a great deal less than the  Hecatee  the Shell on their Backs is all carved natu∣rally finely wrought and well clouded the Backs of these are rounder than those beforementioned they are otherwise much of the same form these delight to live in wet swampy places or on the Land near such places Both these sorts are very good Meat They are in great plenty on the Isle of  Pines  near  Cuba  there the  Spanish  Hunters when they meet them in the Woods bring them home to their Huts and mark them by notching their Shells then let them go this they do to have them at hand for they never ramble far from thence When these Hunters return to  Cubo  after about a Month or six Weeks stay they carry with them or or more of these Creatures to sell for they are very good Meat and every Man knows his own by their Marks These Tortoise in the  Gallapago's  are more like the  Hecatee  except that as I said before they are much bigger and they have very long small  necks and little heads There are some green Snakes on these Islands but no other LandAnimal that I did ever see There are great plenty of TurtleDoves so tame that a Man may kill or dozen in a forenoon with a stick They are somewhat less than a Pigeon and are very good meat and commonly fat  There are good wide Channels between these Islands fit for Ships to pass and in some places shole water where there grows plenty of Turtlegrass therefore these Islands are plentifully stored with SeaTurtle of that sort which is called the green Turtle I have hitherto deferred the description of these Creatures therefore I shall give it here There are sorts of SeaTurtle  viz  the Trunkturtle the Log∣gerhead the Hawksbill and the GreenTurtle The Trunkturtle is commonly bigger than the other their backs are higher and rounder and their flesh rank and not wholsome The Loggerhead is so call'd because it hath a great head much bigger than the other sorts their flesh is likewise very rank and sel∣dom eaten but in case of necessity they feed on Moss that grows about Rocks The Hawksbill Tur∣tle is the leaft kind they are so call'd because their mouths are long and small somewhat resembling the Bill of a Hawk On the backs of these Hawksbill Turtle grows that shell which is so much esteem'd for making Cabinets Combs and other things The largest of them may have three pound and an half of shell I have taken some that have had pound Ounces but they commonly have a pound and half or two Pound some not so much These are but ordinary food but generally sweeter than the Loggerhead yet these Hawksbills in some places are unwholsome causing them that eat them to purge and vomit excessively especially those be∣tween the  Sambaloes  and  Portobel  We meet with other Fish in the  WestIndies  of the same malignant nature but I shall describe them in the Appendix These Hawksbill Turtles are better or worse accor∣ding  to their feeding In some places they feed on Grass as the Green Tortoise also doth in other places they keep among Rocks and feed on Moss or SeaWeeds but these are not so sweet as those that eat Grass neither is their Shell so clear for they are commonly overgrown with Barnacles which spoils the shell and their Flesh is commonly yellow especially the fat  Hawksbill Turtle are in many places of the  WestIndies  They have Islands and places peculiar to themselves where they lay their Eggs and seldom come among any other Turtle These and all other Turtle lay Eggs in the Sand their time of laying is in  May June July  Some begin sooner some later They lay three times in a Season and at each time or Eggs Their Eggs are as big as a Hens Egg and very round covered only with a white tough skin There are some Bays on the Northside of  Jamaica  where these Hawksbills re∣sort to lay In the Bay of  Honduras  are Islands which they likewise make their breeding places and many places along all the Coast on the Main of the  WestIndies  from  Trinidado  to  La Vera Cruz  in the Bay of  Nova Hispania  When a Seaturtle turns out of the Sea to lay she is at least an hour before she returns again for she is to go above high watermark and if it be lowwater when she comes a shore she must rest once or twice being heavy before she comes to the place where she lays When she hath found a place for her purpose she makes a great hole with her Fins in the Sand wherein she lays her Eggs then covers them two foot deep with the same Sand which she threw out of the hole and so re∣turns Sometimes they come up the night before they intend to lay and take a view of the place and so having made a Tour or Semicircular March they return to the Sea again and they never fail to come ashoar the next night to lay near that place  All sorts of Turtle use the same methods in laying I knew a Man in  Jamaica  that made pound Ster∣ling of the shell of these Hawksbill Turtle which he got in one Season and in one small Bay not half a mile long The manner of taking them is to watch the Bay by walking from one part to the other all night making no noise nor keeping any sort of light When the Turtle come ashoar the Man that watches for them turns them on their Backs then hales them above highwater mark and leave them till the Morning A large green Turtle with her weight and struggling will puzzle two Men to turn her The Hawksbill Turtle are not only found in the  WestIndies  but on the Coast of  Guinea  and in the  EastIndies  I never saw any in the  SouthSeas  The Green Turtle are so called because their Shell is greener than any other It is very thin and clear and better clouded than the Hawksbill but 'tis used only for inlays being extraordinary thin These Turtles are generally larger than the Hawksbill one will weigh or hundred pound Their Backs are flatter than the Hawksbill their Heads round and small Green Turtle are the sweetest of all the kinds But there are degrees of them both in re∣spect to their Flesh and their bigness I have ob∣served that at  Blanco  in the  WestIndies  the Green Turtle which is the only kind there are larger than any other in the NorthSeas There they commonly will weigh or pound Their Fat is yellow and the Lean white and their Flesh extraordinary sweet At  Boca Toro  West of  Portobel  they are not so large their Flesh not so white nor the Fat so yellow Those in the Bays of  Honduras  and  Campeachy  are somewhat smaller still their Fat is green and the Lean of a darker colour than those at  BocaToro  I heard of a monstrous green Turtle once taken at  PortRoyal  in the Bay of  Campeachy  that was four foot deep from the Back to the Belly  and the belly foot broad Captain  Roch  's Son of about or years of age went in it as in a Boat on board his Father's Ship about a quarter of a mile from the shore The Leaves of Fat afforded Gal∣lons of Oil The Turtle that live among the Keys or small Islands on the Southside of  Cuba  are a mix'd sort some bigger some less and so their Flesh is of a mix'd colour some green some dark some yellowish With these  PortRoyal  in  Jamaica  is constantly supplied by Sloops that come hither with Nets to take them They carry them alive to  Jamaica  where the Turtles have Wires made with Stakes in the Sea to preserve them alive and the Market is every day plentifully stored with Turtle it being the common food there chiefly for the or∣dinary sort of People  Green Turtle live on Grass which grows in the Sea in or fathom Water at most of the places beforementioned This Grass is different from Manateegrass for that is a small Blade but this a quarter of an inch broad and six inches long The Turtle of these Islands  Gallapagos  are a sort of a bastard green Turtle for their Shell is thicker than other green Turtle in the  West  or  EastIndies  and their Flesh is not so sweet They are larger than any other green Turtle for it is common for these to be two or three foot deep and their Callapees or Bellies foot wide but there are other green Tur∣tle in the  SouthSeas  that are not so big as the smal∣lest Hawksbill These are seen at the Island  Plata  and other places thereabouts They feed on Moss and are very rank but fat  Both these sorts are different from any others for both He's and She's come ashoar in the day time and lie in the Sun but in other places none but the She's go ashoar and that in the night only to lay their Eggs The best feeding for Turtle in the South Seas is among these  Gallapago  Islands for here is plenty of Grass  There is another sort of green Turtle in the  South Seas  which are but small yet pretty sweet These lie Westward on the Coast of  Mexico  One thing is very strange and remarkable in these Crea∣tures that at the breeding time they leave for or Months their common Haunts where they feed most of the Year and resort to other places only to lay their Eggs and 'tis not thought that they eat any thing during this Season So that both He's and She's grow very lean but the He's to that de∣gree that none will eat them The most remarka∣ble places that I did ever hear of for their breeding is at an Island in the  WestIndies  called  Caimanes  and the Isle  Ascention  in the  Western Ocean  and when the breeding time is past there are none remaining Doubtless they swim some hundreds of Leagues to come to those two places For it hath been often observed that at  Caimanes  at the breeding time there are found all those sorts of Turtle before de∣scribed The  South Keys  of  Cuba  are above leagues from thence which is the nearest place that these Creatures can come from and it is most certain that there could not live so many there as come here in one Season  Those that go to lay at  Ascention  must needs tra∣vel much farther for there is no Land nearer it than Leagues And it is certain that these Crea∣tures live always near the Shoar In the  South Sea  likewise the  Gallapagos  is the place where they live the biggest part of the year yet they go from thence at their Season over to the Main to lay their Eggs which is Leagues the nearest place Altho' multitudes of these Turtle go from their common places of feeding and abode to those laying places yet they do not all go And at the time when the Turtle resort to these places to lay their Eggs they are accompanied with abundance of Fish especially Sharks the places which the Turtle then leave be∣ing  at that time destitute of Fish which follow the Turtle  When the She's go thus to their places to lay the Male accompany them and never leave them till their return both Male and Female are fat the be∣ginning of the Season but before they return the Male as I said are so lean that they are not fit to eat but the Female are good to the very last yet not so fat as at the beginning of the Season It is reported of these Creatures that they are nine days engendring and in the Water the Male on the Females Back It is observable that the Male while engendring do not easily forsake their Fe∣male for I have gone and taken hold of the Male when engendring and a very bad Striker may strike them then for the Male is not shy at all but the Female seeing a Boat when they rise to blow would make her escape but that the Male grasps her with his two fore Fins and holds her fast When they are thus coupled it is best to strike the Female first then you are sure of the Male also These Creatures are thought to live to a great Age and it is observed by the  Jamaica  Turtlers that they are many years before they come to their full growth  The Air of these Islands is temperate enough con∣sidering the Clime Here is constantly a fresh Sea∣breeze all day and cooling refreshing Winds in the night Therefore the heat is not so violent here as in most places near the Equator The time of the year for the Rains is in  November December  and  January  Then there is oftentimes excessive dark tempestuous Weather mixt with much Thunder and Lightning Sometimes before and after these Months there are moderate refreshing Showers but in  May June July  and  August  the Weather is al∣ways very fair  We staid at one of these Islands which lies under the Equator but one Night because our Prizes  could not get in to an Anchor We refresh'd our selves very well both with Land and SeaTurtles and the next day we sailed from thence The next Island of the  Gallapagos  that we came to is but two Leagues from this 'tis rocky and barren like this it is about five or six Leagues long and four broad We anchored in the Afternoon at the Northside of the Island a quarter of a Mile from the Shore in fathom Water It is steep all round this Island and no Anchoring only at this place Here it is but ordinary riding for the Ground is so steep that if an Anchor starts it never holds again and the Wind is commonly off from the Land except in the Night when the Landwind comes more from the West for there it blows right along the Shore though but faintly Here is no Water but in Ponds and Holes of the Rocks That which we first an∣chored at hath Water on the Northend falling down in a stream from high steep Rocks upon the Sandy Bay where it may be taken up As soon as we came to an Anchor we made a Tent ashoar for Capt  Cook  who was sick Here we found the SeaTurtle lying ashoar on the Sand this is not custo∣mary in the  WestIndies  We turned them on their Backs that they might not get away The next day more came up when we found it to be their custom to lie in the Sun so we never took care to turn them afterwards but sent ashoar the Cook every Morning who killed as many as served for the day This custom we observed all the time we lay here feeding sometimes on LandTurtle sometimes on SeaTurtle there being plenty of either sort Cap∣tain  Davis  came hither again a second time and then he went to other Islands on the Westside of these There he found such plenty of LandTurtle that he and his Men eat nothing else for Months that he staid there They were so fat that he saved sixty Jars of Oyl out of those that he spent This  Oil served instead of Butter to eat with Dough∣boys or Dumplins in his return out of these Seas He found very convenient places to Careen and good Channels between the Islands and very good Anchoring in many places There he found also plenty of Brooks of good fresh Water and Fire∣wood enough there being plenty of Trees fit for many uses Capt  Harris  one that we shall speak of hereafter came hither likewise and found some Islands that had plenty of  MammeeTrees  and pretty large Rivers The Sea about these Islands is plenti∣fully stored with Fish such as are at  John Fernando  's They are both large and fat and as plentiful here as at  John Fernando  's Here are particularly abun∣dance of Sharks The Northpart of this second Isle we anchored at lies minutes North of the  Equa∣tor  I took the heighth of the Sun with an  Astrolabe  These Isles of the  Gallapago's  have plenty of Salt We stay'd here but days in which time we put ashoar packs of Flower for a reserve if we should have occasion of any before we left these Seas Here one of our  Indian  Prisoners informed us that he was born at  Ria Lexa  and that he would en∣gage to carry us thither He being examin'd of the Strength and Riches of it satisfy'd the Company so well that they were resolved to go thither  Having thus concluded the th of  June  we sailed from hence designing to touch at the Island  Cocos  as well to put ashoar some Flower there as to see the Island because it was in our way to  Ria Lexa  We steer'd North till in Lat d min intend∣ing then to steer W by N for we expected to have had the Wind at S by E or S S E as we had on the Southside of the Equator Thus I had for∣merly found the Winds near the Shore in these Lati∣tudes but when we first parted from the  Gallapago's  we had the Wind at S and as we sailed farther North we had the Winds at S by W then at  S S W Winds which we did not expect We thought at first that the Wind would come about again to the South but when we came to sail off West to the Island  Cocos  we had the Wind at S W by S and could lie but W by N Yet we stood that Course till we were in the lat d m N and then despairing as the Winds were to find the Island  Cocos  we steer'd over to the Main for had we seen the Island then we could not have fetcht it being so far to the North of it  The Island  Cocos  is so named by the  Spaniards  be∣cause there are abundance of Coconut Trees grow∣ing on it They are not only in one or two places but grow in great Groves all round the Island by the Sea This is an uninhabited Island it is or leagues round and pretty high in the middle where it is destitute of Trees but looks very green and pleasant with an Herb called by the  Spaniards Gra∣madael  It is low Land by the Seaside  This Island is in d m North of the Equator it is invironed with Rocks which makes it almost inaccessible only at the N E end there is a small Harbor where Ships may safely enter and ride secure In this Harbor there is a fine Brook of fresh Water running into the Sea This is the account that the  Spaniards  give of it and I had the same also from Captain  Eaton  who was there afterward  Any who like us had not experienced the nature of the Winds in these parts might reasonably expect that we could have sailed with a flown Sheet to  Ria Lexa  but we found our selves mistaken for as we came nearer the shore we found the Winds right in our Teeth But I shall refer my Reader to the Chap∣ter of Winds in the Appendix for a further account of this  We had very fair weather and small winds in this Voyage from the  Gallapagos  and at the beginning of  July  we fell in with Cape  Blanco  on the Main of  Mexico  This is so called from two white Rocks ly∣ing off it When weare off at Sea right against the Cape they appear as part of the Cape but being near the shoar either to the Eastward or Westward of the Cape they appear like two Ships under sail at first view but coming nearer they are like two high Towers they being small high and steep on all sides and they are about half a mile from the Cape This Cape is in lat d m It is about the heighth of  Beachyhead  in  England  on the Coast of  Sussex  It is a full Point with steep Rocks to the Sea The top of it is flat and even for about a mile then it gradually falls away on each side with a gentle descent It appears very pleasant being co∣vered with great lofty Trees From the Cape on the N W side the Land runs in N E for about leagues making a small Bay called by the  Spaniards Caldera  A league within Cape  Blanco  on the N W side of it and at the entrance of this Bay there is a small Brook of very good water running into the Sea Here the Land is low making a saddling between small Hills It is very rich Land producing large tall Trees of many sorts the Mould is black and deep which I have always taken notice of to be a fat Soil About a mile from this Brook towards the N E the Woodland terminates Here the Savan∣nah Land begins and runs some Leagues into the Country making many small Hills and Dales These Savannahs are not altogether clear of Trees but are here and there sprinkled with small Groves which render them very delightful The Grass which grows here is very kindly thick and long I have seen none better in the  WestIndies  Toward the bottom of the Bay the Land by the Sea is low and full of Mangroves but farther in the Country the Land is high and mountainous The Mountains are part Woodland part Savannah The Trees in those Woods are but small and short and the  Mountain Savannahs are cloathed but with indiffe∣rent Grass From the bottom of this Bay it is but or leagues to the Lake of  Nicaragua  on the NorthSea Coast the way between is somewhat Mountainous but most Savannah  Capt  Cook  who was taken sick at  John Fernan∣doe  's continued so till we came within or leagues of Cape  Blanco  and then died of a sudden tho' he seemed that morning to be as likely to live as he had been some weeks before but it is usual with sick Men coming from the Sea where they have nothing but the SeaAir to die off as soon as ever they come within the view of the Land About hours after we all came to an Anchor namely the Ship that I was in Captain  Eaton  and the great Meal Prize a league within the Cape right a∣gainst the Brook of Freshwater in fathom clean hard Sand Presently after we came to an Anchor Capt  Cook  was carried ashoar to be buried Men carried there Arms to Guard those that were ordered to dig the Grave for although we saw no appearance of Inhabitants yet we did not know but the Country might be thick inhabited And before Capt  Cook  was interr'd  Spanish Indians  came to the place where our Men were digging the Grave and demanded what they were and from whence they came to whom our Men an∣swered They came from  Lima  and were bound to  Ria Lexa  but that the Capt of one of the Ships dying at Sea oblig'd them to come into this place to give him Christian burial The  Spanish Indians  who were very shy at first began to be more bold and drawing nearer asked many silly Questions and our Men did not stick to sooth them up with as many Falshoods purposely to draw them into their clutches Our Men often laught at their temerity and asked them if they never saw any  Spaniards  be∣fore They told them that they themselves were  Spaniards  and that they lived among  Spaniards  and that altho' they were born there yet they had never seen Ships there before Our Men told them that neither now might they have seen so many if it had not been on an urgent occasion At length they drill'd them by discourse so near that our Men lay'd hold on all three at once but before Captain  Cook  was buried one of them made his escape the other two were brought off aboard our Ship Cap∣tain  Eaton  immediately came aboard and examined them they confessed that they came purposely to view our Ship and if possible to inform themselves what we were for the President of  Panama  not long before sent a Letter of advice to  Nicoya  in∣forming the Magistrates thereof that some Enemies were come into these Seas and that therefore it behoved them to be careful of themselves  Nicoya  is a small Mulatto Town about or leagues East from hence standing on the Banks of a River of that name It is a place very fit for building Ships therefore most of the Inhabitants are Carpenters who are commonly imployed in building new or repairing old Ships It was here that Capt  Sharp  just after I left him in the Year got Car∣penters to six his Ship before he returned for  Eng∣land  and for that reason it behoved the  Spaniards  to be careful according to the Governor of  Panama  's advice lest any Men at other times wanting such necessaries as that place afforded might again be supplied there These  Spanish Indians  told us likewise that they were sent to the place where they were taken in order to view our Ships as fearing these were those mentioned by the President of  Panama  It being demanded of them to give an account of the Estate and Riches of the Country they said that the Inhabitants were most Husbandmen who were imployed either in Planting and Manuring of Corn or chiefly about Cattle they having large Savan∣nahs  which were well stored with Bulls Cows and Horses that by the Seaside in some places there grew some Redwood useful in Dying of this they said there was little profit made because they were forc'd to send it to the Lake of  Nicaragua  which runs into the North Seas That they sent thither also great quantities of Bull and Cow Hides and brought from thence in Exchange  Europe  Com∣modities as Hats Linnen and Wollen where∣with they cloathed themselves that the Flesh of the Cattle turned to no other profit than Sustenance for their Families As for Butter and Cheese they make but little in those parts After they had gi∣ven this Relation they told us that if we wanted Provision there was a BeefEstantion or Farm of Bulls or Cows about mile off where we might kill what we pleased This was welcome News for we had no sort of Flesh since we left the  Gallapagos  therefore of us immediately entered into two Boats taking one of these  Spanish Indians  with us for a Pilot and went ashore about a league from the Ship There we haled up our Boats dry and marched all away following our Guide who soon brought us to some Houses and a large Penn for Cattle This Penn stood in a large Savannah about two Mile from our Boats There were a great many fat Bulls and Cows feeding in the Savannahs some of us would have kill'd or to carry on board but others opposed it and said It was better to stay all Night and in the Morning drive the Cattle into the Penn and then kill or or as many as we pleased I was minded to return aboard and endeavoured to perswade them all to go with me but some would not therefore I returned with which was half and left the other behind At this place I saw or Tun of the Redwood which I take to be that sort of Wood call'd in  Ja∣maica  Bloodwood or  Nicaraguawood  We who  returned abroad met no one to oppose us and the next day we expected our Consorts that we left a∣shore but none came therefore at a Clock in the Afternoon Men went in our Canoa to see what was become of them When they came to the Bay where we landed to go to the Estantion they found our Men all on a small Rock half a mile from the shore standing in the Water up to their Wastes These Men had slept ashore in the House and turned out betimes in the Morning to pen the Cattle or went one way and as many another way to get the Cattle to the Pen and others stood at the Pen to drive them in When they were thus scatter'd about or armed  Spaniards  came in among them Our Men immediately called to each other and drew together in a Body before the  Spa∣niards  could attack them and marched to their Boat which was hal'd up dry on the Sand But when they came to the sandy Bay they found their Boat all in Flames This was a very unpleasing sight for they knew not how to get Aboard unless they marched by Land to the place where Capt  Cook  was buried which was near a league The greatest part of the way was thick Woods where the  Spa∣niards  might easily lay an Ambush for them at which they are very expert On the other side the  Spani∣ards  now thought them secure and therefore came to them and asked them if they would be pleased to walk to their Plantations with many other such flouts but our Men answered never a word It was about half ebb when one of our Men took no∣tice of a Rock a good distance from the shore just appearing above Water he shewed it to his Con∣sorts and told them it would be a good Castle for them if they could get thither They all wisht themselves there for the  Spaniards  who lay as yet at a good distance from them behind the Bushes as secure of their Prey began to whistle now and then  a shot among them Having therefore well consi∣dered the place together with the danger they were in they proposed to send one of the tallest Men to try if the Sea between them and the Rock were fordable This Counsel they presently put in execu∣tion and found it according to their desire So they all marched over to the Rock where they remained till the Canoa came to them which was about Hours It was the latter part of the Ebb when they first went over and then the Rock was dry but when the Tide of Flood returned again the Rock was covered and the Water still flowing so that if our Canoa had stayed but one hour longer they might have been in as great danger of their lives from the Sea as before from the  Spaniards  for the Tide riseth here about foot The  Spaniards  remained on the shore expecting to see them de∣stroyed but never came from behind the Bushes where they first planted themselves they having not above or Handguns the rest of them being armed with Lances The  Spaniards  in these parts are very expert in heaving or darting the Lance with which upon occasion they will do great Feats especially in Ambuscades And by their good Will they care not for fighting otherwise but content themselves with standing a loof threatning and cal∣ling Names at which they are as expert as the other so that if their Tongues be quiet we always take it for granted they have said some Ambush Before night our Canoa came Aboard and brought our Men all safe The next day two Canoas were sent to the bottom of the Bay to seek sor a large Canoa which we were informed was there The  Spaniards  have neither Ships nor Barks here and but a few Canoas which they seldom use Neither are there any Fishermen here as I judge because Fish is very scarce for I never saw any here neither could any of our Men ever take any and yet whereever  we come to an Anchor we always send out our Strikers and put our Hooks and Lines over∣board to try for Fish The next day our Men re∣turned out of the Bay and brought the Canoa with them which they were sent for and or days afterwards the Canoas were sent out again for ano∣ther which they likewise brought aboard These Canoas were fitted with Thoats or Benhces Straps and Oars fit for service and one of these Capt  Eaton  had for his share and we the other which we sixt for landing Men when occasion required While we lay here we filled our Water and cut a great many Looms or Handles or Staves for Oars for here is plenty of Lancewood which is most proper for that use I never saw any in the  South Seas  but in this place There is plenty of it in  Jamaica  espe∣cially at a place called  Blewfields  not  Blewfields  Ri∣ver which is on the Main near the Westend of that Island The Lancewood grows strait like our young Ashes it is very hard tough and heavy therefore Privateers esteem it very much not only to make Looms for Oars but ScouringRods for their Guns for they have seldom less than or spare Rods for fear one should break and they are much better than Rods made of Ash  The Day before we went from hence Mr  Edward Davis  the Company's QuarterMaster was made Captain by consent of all the Company for it was his place by Succession The th day of  July  we sailed from this Bay of  Caldera  with Capt  Eaton  and our Prize which we brought from  Gallapagos  in Company directing our Course for  Ria Lexa  The Wind was at North which altho' but an ordinary Wind yet carried us in three days abrest of our in∣tended Port  Ria Lexa  is the most remarkable Land on all this Coast for there is a high pecked burning Moun∣tain called by the Spaniards  VolcanVejo  or the  Old  Volcan  This must be brought to bear N E then steer in directly with the Mountain and that course will bring you to the Harbour The Sea winds are here at S S W therefore Ships that come hither must take the Seawinds for there is no going in with the Landwind The  Volcan  may be easily known because there is not any other so high a Mountain near it neither is there any that appears in the like form all along the Coast besides it smoaks all the day and in the night it sometimes sends forth flames of Fire This Mountain may be seen leagues being within leagues of the Harbor the entrance into it may be seen there is a small flat low Island which makes the Harbor it is about a mile long and a quarter of a mile broad and is from the Main about a mile and a half There is a Channel at each end of the Island the west Channel is the widest and safest yet at the N W point of the Island there is a shole which Ships must take heed of going in Being past that shole you must keep close to the Island for there is a whole sandy point strikes over from the Main almost half way The East Channel is not so wide besides there runs a stronger Tide therefore Ships seldom or never go in that way This Harbor is capable of recei∣ving Sail of Ships the best riding is near the Main where there is or fathom water clean hard Sand  Ria Lexa  Town is leagues from hence and there are Creeks that run towards it the Wester∣most comes near the backside of the Town the o∣ther runs up to the Town but neither Ships nor Barks can go so far These Creeks are very narrow and the Land on each side drowned and full of red Mangrovetrees About a mile and half below the Town on the banks of the East Creek the  Spani∣ards  had cast up a strong Breastwork it was like∣wise reported they had another on the West Creek  both so advantageously placed that Men might with ease keep Men from landing I shall give a description of the Town in my return hither and therefore forbear to do it here Wherefore to resume the thread of our course we were now in sight of the  Volcan  being by estimation or leagues from the shoar and the Mountain bearing N E we took in our Topsails and hal'd up our Courses intending to go with our Canoas into the Harbor in the night In the Evening we had a very hard Tornado out of the N E with much Thunder Lightning and Rain The violence of the Wind did not last long yet it was a a clock at night before we got out our Canoas and then it was quite calm We rowed in directly for the shoar and thought to have reach'd it before day but it was a Clock in the Morning before we got into the Harbor When we came with∣in a league of the Island of  Ria Lexa  that makes the Harbor we saw a House on it and coming nearer we saw or Men who stood and looked on us till we came within half a mile of the Island then they went into their Canoa which lay on the in∣side of the Island and rowed towards the Main but we overtook them before they got over and brought them back again to the Island There was a Horseman right against us on the Main when we took the Canoa who immediately rode away towards the Town as fast as he could The rest of our Canoas rowed heavily and did not come to the Island till a clock therefore we were forced to stay for them Before they came we examined the Prisoners who told us that they were set there to watch for the Governor of  Ria Lexa  received a Letter about a month before wherein he was advised of some Enemies come into the Sea and therefore admo∣nished to be careful that immediately there∣upon the Governor had caused a House to be built on this Island and ordered Men to be continually  there to watch Night and Day and if they saw any Ship coming thither they were to give notice of it They said they did not expect to see Boats or Ca∣noas but lookt out for a Ship At first they took us in our advanced Canoa to be some Men that had been cast away and lost our Ship till seeing or Canoas more they began to suspect what we were They told us likewise that the Horseman which we saw did come to them every Morning and that in less than an Hours time he could be at the Town When Captain  Eaton  and his Canoas came ashoar we told them what had hapned It was now three Hours since the Horseman rode away and we could not expect to get to the Town in less than two Hours in which time the Governour having notice of our coming might be provided to receive us at his BreastWorks therefore we thought it best to defer this Design till another time  There is a fine Spring of fresh Water on the Island there are some Trees also but the biggest part is Savannah whereon is good Grass though there is no sort of Beast to eat it This Island is in lat d m North Here we stayed till a clock in the After∣noon then our Ships being come within a League of the shoar we all went on board and steered for the Gulf of  Amapalla  intending there to careen our Ships  The th of  July  Captain  Eaton  came aboard our Ship to consult with Captain  Davis  how to get some  Indians  to assist us in careening It was con∣cluded that when we came near the Gulf Captain  Davis  should take two Canoas well mann'd and go before and Captain  Eaton  should stay aboard According to this Agreement Captain  Davis  went away for the Gulf the next day  The Gulf of  Amapalla  is a great Arm of the Sea running or Leagues into the Country It is bounded on the Southside of its Entrance with  Point  Casivina  and on the N W side with St  Mi∣chael  's Mount Both these place are very remarka∣ble Point  Casivina  is in lat d m North it is a high round Point which at Sea appears like an Island because the Land within it is very low St  Michael  's Mount is a very high peeked Hill not very steep the Land at the foot of it on the S E side is low and even for at least a mile From this low Land the Gulf of  Amapalla  enters on that side Between this low Land and Point  Casivina  there are two considerable high Islands the South∣ermost is called  Mangera  the other is called  Ama∣palla  and they are two miles asunder  Mangera  is a high round Island about leagues in compass appearing like a tall Grove It is in∣vironed with Rocks all round only a small Cove or sandy Bay on the N E side The Mold and Soil of this Island is black but not deep it is mixt with Stones yet very productive of large tall Tim∣ber Trees In the middle of the Island there is an  Indian  Town and a fair  Spanish  Church The  In∣dians  have Plantations of Maiz round the Town and some Plantains They have a few Cocks and Hens but no other sort of tame Fowl neithe  have they any sort of Beast but Cats and Dogs  There is a path from the Town to the sandy Bay  but the way is steep and rocky At this sandy Bay  there are always or Canoas lie haled up dry  except when they are in use  Amapalla  is a larger Island than  Mangera  th  Soil much the same There are two Towns on i  about two Miles asunder one on the Northsid  the other on the Eastside That on the Eastsid  is not above a mile from the Sea it stands on  Plain on the top of a Hill the Path to it so stee  and rocky that a few Men might keep down  great number only with Stones There is a ve  fair Church standing in the midst of the Tow  The other Town is not so big yet it has a good handsom Church One thing I have observed in all the  Indians  Towns under the  Spanish  Government as well in these parts as in the Bay of  Campeachy  and elsewhere that the Images of the Virgin  Mary  and other Saints with which all their Churches were filled are still painted in an  Indian  Complexion and partly in that Dress but in those Towns which are inhabited chiefly by  Spaniards  the Saints also con∣form themselves to the  Spanish  Garb and Complexion The Houses here are but mean the  Indians  of both Plains have good Field Maiz remote from the Town they have but few Plantains but they have abundance of large HogPlumbtrees growing about their Houses The Tree that bears this Fruit is as big as our largest Plumbtree The Leaf is of a dark green colour and as broad as the Leaf of a Plumbtree but they are shaped like the Hawthorn Leaf The Trees are very brittle Wood The Fruit is oval and as big as a small Horse Plumb It is at first very green but when it is ripe one side is yellow the other red It hath a great stone and but little substance about it The Fruit is pleasant enough but I do not remember that ever I saw one through∣ly ripe that had not a Maggot or two in it I do not remember that I did ever see any of this Fruit in the  South Seas  but at this place In the Bay of  Campeachy  they are very plentiful and in  Jamaica  they plant them to fence their Ground These  Indians  have also some Fowls as those at  Mangera  No  Spaniards  dwell among them but only one  Padre  or Priest who serves for all three Town these two at  Amapalla  and that at  Mangera  They are under the Governour of the Town of St  Mi∣chael  's at the foot of St  Michael  s Mount to whom they pay their Tribute in Maiz being extreamly poor yet very contented They have nothing to make Money of but their Plantations of Maiz and  their Fowls the  Padre  or Fryer hath his Tenths of it and knows to a Peck how much every Man hath and how many Fowls of which they dare not kill one tho' they are sick without leave from him There was as I said never another white Man on these Islands but the Fryer He could speak the  Indian  Language as all Fryers must that live among them In this vast Country of  America  there are di∣vers Nations of  Indians  different in their Language therefore those Fryers that are minded to live among any Nations of  Indians  must learn the Language of those People they propose to teach Although these here are but poor yet the  Indians  in many other places have great Riches which the  Spaniards  draw from them for Trifles In such places the Fry∣ers get plentiful Incoms as particularly in the Bay of  Campeachy  where the  Indians  have large Cacao∣walks or in other Places where they plant Cocho∣neel Trees or SilvesterTrees or where they gather Vinelloes and in such places where they gather Gold In such places as these the Fryers do get a great deal of Wealth There was but one of all the  Indians  on both these Islands that could speak  Spa∣nish  he could write  Spanish  also being bred up pur∣posely to keep their Registers and Books of Account He was Secretary to both Islands They had a  Cosica  too a small sort of Magistrate the  Indians  have a∣mongst themselves but he could neither write nor speak  Spanish  There are a great many more Islands in this Bay but none inhabited as these There is one pretty large Island belonging to a Nunnery as the  Indians  told us this was stocked with Bulls and Cows there were or  Indians  lived there to look after the Cattle for the sake of which we often fre∣quented this Island while we lay in the Bay they are all low Islands except  Amapalla  and  Mangera  There are two Channels to come into this Gulph  one between Point  Casivina  and  Mangera  the other between  Mangera  and  Amapalla  The latter is the best The Riding place is on the Eastside of  Ama∣palla  right against a spot of low Ground for all the Island except this one place is high Land Run∣ning in farther Ships may anchor near the Main on the N E side of the Island  Amapalla  This is the place most frequented by  Spaniards  It is called the Port of  Martin Lopez  This Gulph or Lake runs in some Leagues beyond all the Islands but it is shole Water and not capable of Ships  It was into this Gulph that Capt  Davis  was gone with the two Canoas to endeavour for a Prisoner to gain intelligence if possible before our Ships came in He came the first Night to  Mangera  but for want of a Pilot did not know where to look for the Town In the Morning he found a great many Canoas haled up on the Bay and from that Bay found a Path which led him and his Company to the Town The  Indians  saw our Ships in the Evening coming towards the Island and being before inform∣ed of Enemies in the Sea they kept Scouts out all Night for fear who seeing Captain  Davis  coming run into the Town and alarmed all the People When Captain  Davis  came thither they all run in∣to the Woods The Fryer happened to be there at this time who being unable to ramble into the Woods fell into Capt  Davis  's Hands There were two  Indian  Boys with him who were likewise ta∣ken Captain  Davis  went only to get a Prisoner therefore was well satisfied with the Fryer and im∣mediately came down to the Seaside He went from thence to the Island  Amapalla  carrying the Fryer and the two  Indian  Boys with him These were his Pilots to conduct him to the Landing place where they arrived about Noon They made no stay here but left or Men to look after the Canoas and Captain  Davis  with the rest marched to  the Town taking the Fryer with them The Town as is before noted is about a Mile from the Land∣ingplace standing in a Plain on the top of a Hill having a very steep ascent to go to it All the  Indians  stood on the top of the Hill waiting Capt  Davis  's coming  The Secretary mention'd before had no great kindness for the  Spaniards  It was he that perswaded the  Indians  to wait Captain  Davis  his coming for they were all running into the Woods but he told them that if any of the  Spaniards  Enemies came thither it was not to hurt them but the  Spaniards  whose Slaves they were and that their Poverty would protect them This Man with the  Casica  stood more forward than the rest at the Bank of the Hill when Captain  Davis  with his Company appeared beneath They called out therefore in  Spanish  de∣manding of our Men What they were and from whence they came To whom Capt  Davis  and his Men replied They were  Biscayers  and that they were sent thither by the King of  Spain  to clear those Seas from Enemies that their Ships were com∣ing into the Gulf to careen and that they came thi∣ther before the Ships to seek a convenient place fo  it as also to desire the  Indians  Assistance The Se¦cretary who as I said before was the only Ma  that could speak  Spanish  told them that they we  welcome for he had a great respect for any O  Spain  Men especially for the  Biscayers  of whom  had heard a very honourable Report therefore  desired them to come up to their Town Captai  Davis  and his Men immediately ascended the Hil  the Fryer going before and they were receiv  with a great deal of Affection by the  Indians  T  Casica  and Secretary embraced Captain  Davis  a  the other  Indians  received his Men with the  Ceremony These Salutations being ended they  marched towards the Church for that is the place  all publick Meetings and all Plays and Pastimes are acted there also therefore in the Churches belong∣ing to  Indian  Towns they have all sorts of Vizards and strange antick Dresses both for Men and Wo∣men and abundance of Musical Hautboys and Strumstrums The Strumstrum is made somewhat like a Cittern most of those that the  Indians  use are made of a large Goad cut in the midst and a thin Board laid over the hollow and which is fastned to the Sides this serves for the Belly over which the Strings are placed The Nights before any Holidays or the Nights ensuing are the times when they all meet to make merry Their Mirth consists in sing∣ing dancing and sporting in those antick Habits and using as many antick Gestures If the Moon shine they use but few Torches if not the Church is full of Light They meet at these times all sorts of both Sexes All the  Indians  that I have been acquainted with who are under the  Spaniards  seem to be more me∣lancholy than other  Indians  that are free and at these publick Meetings when they are in the greatest of their Jollity their Mirth seems to be rather forced than real Their Songs are very melancholy and doleful so is their Muck but whether it be natu∣ral to the  Indians  to be thus melancholy or the ef∣fect of their Slavery I am not certain But I have always been prone to believe that they are then only condoling their Misfortunes the loss of their Country and Liberties which altho' these that are now living do not know nor remember what it was to be free yet there seems to be a deep Impression in their thoughts of the Slavery which the  Spaniards  have brought them under increas'd probably by some Traditions of their ancient Freedom  Capt  Davis  intended when they were all in the Church to shut the Doors and then make a bargain with them letting them know what he was and so draw them afterwards by fair means to our assistance  the Fryer being with him who had also promis'd to engage them to it but before they were all in the Church one of Capt  Davis  his Men pusht one of the  Indians  to hasten him into the Church The  Indian  immediately ran away and all the rest taking the alarm sprang out of the Church like Deer it was hard to say which was first and Captain  Da∣vis  who knew nothing of what hapned was left in the Church only with the Fryer When they were all fled Captain  Davis  his Men fir'd and kill'd the Secretary and thus our Hopes perished by the Indiscretion of one foolish Fellow  In the Afternoon the Ships came into the Gulf between Point  Casivina  and  Mangera  and anchored near the Island  Amapalla  on the Eastside in ten Fa∣thom Water clean hard Sand In the Evening Cap∣tain  Davis  and his Company came aboard and brought the Fryer with them who told Captain  Davis  that if the Secretary had not been kill'd he could have sent him a Letter by one of the  Indians  that was taken at  Mangera  and perswaded him to come to us but now the only way was to send one of those  Indians  to seek the  Casica  and that himself would instruct him what to say and did not que∣stion but the  Casica  would come in on his word The next Day we sent ashoar one of the  Indians  who before Night returned with the  Casica  and other  Indians  who remained with us all the time that we staid here These  Indians  did us good service espe∣cially in piloting us to an Island where we kill'd Beef whenever we wanted and for this their Ser∣vice we satisfied them to their Hearts content It was at this Island  Amapalla  that a party of  English  men and  French  men came afterwards and stay'd a great while and at last landed on the Main and marched over Land to the  Cape River  which disembogues in∣to the North Seas near Cape  Gratia Dios  and is therefore called the  Cape River  Near the Head of  this River they made Barklogs which I shall de∣scribe in the next Chapter and so went into the North Seas This was the way that Captain  Sharp  had proposed to go if he had been put to it for this way was partly known to Privateers by the dis∣covery that was made into the Country about Years since by a Party of  English  Men that went up that River in Canoas about as far as the place where these  French  Men made their Barklogs there they landed and marched to a Town called  Segovia  in the Country They were near a Month getting up the River for there were many Cataracts where they were often forced to leave the River and hale their Canoas a shoar over the Land till they were past the Cataracts and then launched their Canoas again into the River I have discoursed several Men that were in that Expedition and if I mistake not Captain  Sharp  was one of them But to return to our Voyage in hand when both our Ships were clean and our Water filled Captain  Davis  and Captain  Eaton  broke off Consortships Captain  Ea∣ton  took aboard of his Ships Packs of Flower and sailed out of the Gulf the second day of  Sep∣tember  CHAP VI

Plata  THE third day of  September  we sent the Frier ashoar and left the  Indians  in possession of the Prize which we brought in hither though she was still half laden with Flower and we sailed out with the Land Wind passing between  Amapalla  and  Mangera  When we were a league out we saw a Canoa coming with Sail and Oars after us there∣fore we shortned Sail and staid for her She was a Canoa sent by the Governor of St  Michael  's Town to our Captain desiring him not to carry away the Frier The Messenger being told that the Frier was set ashoar again at  Amapalla  he returned with joy and we made Sail again having the Wind at W N W We steered towards the Coast of  Peru  we had  Tornadoes  every day till we made Cape St  Francisco  which from  June  to  November  are very common on these Coasts and we had with the  Tornadoes  wery much Thunder Lightning and Rain When the  Tornadoes  were over the Winds which while they lasted was most from the South East came about again to the West and never failed us till we were in sight of Cape St  Francisco  where we found the Wind at South with fair Weather This Cape is in lat d North it is a high Bluff or full point of Land cloathed with tall great Trees Passing by this Point coming from the North you will see a small low point which you might suppose to be the Cape but you are then past it and presently afterwards it appears with three points The Land in the Country within this Cape is very high and the Mountains commonly appear very black When we came in with this Cape we overtook Captain  Ea∣ton  plying under the shoar he in his passage from  Amapalla  while he was on that Coast met with such terrible  Tornadoes  of Thunder and Lightning that as he and all his Men related they had never met with the like in any place They were very much af∣frightned by them the Air smelling very much of Sulphur and they apprehending themselves in great danger of being burnt by the Lightning He touch'd at the Island  Cocos  and put ashoar Packs of Flower there and loaded his Boat with CocoNuts and took in fresh Water In the evening we sepa∣rated  again from Captain  Eaton  for he stood off to Sea and we plied up under the shoar making our best advantage both of Sea and Land Winds The Sea Winds are here at South the Land Winds at S S E but some times when we came abrest of a River we should have the Wind at S E  The th day of  September  we came to the Island  Plata  and anchored in fathom We had very good weather from the time that we fell in with Cape  St Francisco  and were now fallen in again with the same places from whence I begin the ac∣count of this Voyage in the first Capter having now compass'd in the whole Continent of the South  America  The Island  Plata  as some report was so named by the  Spaniards  after Sir  Francis Drake  took the  Cacafoga  a Ship chiefly laden with Plate which they say he brought hither and divided it here with his Men It is about mile long and a mile and half broad and of a good heighth It is bounded with high steep Cliffs clear round only at one place on the Eastside The top of it is flat and even the Soil sandy and dry The Trees it produceth are but small bodied low and grow thin and there are only or sorts of Trees all unknown to us I observed they were much overgrown with long Moss There is good Grass especially in the be∣ginning of the Year There is no Water on this Island but at one place on the Eastside close by the Sea there it drills slowly down from the Rocks where it may be received into Vessels There was plenty of Goats but they are now all destroyed There is no other sort of Land Animal that I did ever see here are plenty of  Boobies  and  Men of War  Birds The anch  ing place is on the East side near the middle of the Island close by the shoar within two Cables lengths of the sandy Bay there is about or fathom good fast oazy ground and smooth water  for the S E point of the Island shelters from the South Winds which constantly blow here From the S E point there strikes out a small shole a quar∣ter of a Mile into the Sea where there is commonly a great riplin or working of short Waves during all the Flood The Tide runs pretty strong the Flood to the South and the Ebb to the North There is good landing on the Sandy Bay against the An∣choring place from whence you may go up into the Island and at no place besides There are or high steep small Rocks at the S E point not a Cables length from the Island and another much bigger at the N E end it is deep water all round but at the anchoring place and at the shole at the S E point This Island lieth in lat d m South It is distant from Cape  St Lorenzo  or leagues bearing from it W S W and half a point westerly At this Island are plenty of those small  Sea Turtle  spoken of in my last Chapter  The st day Captain  Eaton  came to an Anchor by us he was very willing to have consorted with us again but Captain  Davis  's Men were so unrea∣sonable that they wou'd not allow Captain  Eaton  's Men an equal share with them in what they got therefore Captain  Eaton  staid here but one night and the next day sailed from hence steering away to the Southward We staid no longer then the day ensuing and then we sailed toward Point  St Hellena  intending there to land some Men purposely to get Prisoners for Intelligence  Point  Santa Hellena  bears South from the Island  Plata  It lies in lat d m South The Point is pretty high flat and even at top overgrown with many great Thistles but no sort of Tree at a distance it appears like an Island because the Land within it is very low  This Point strikes out West into the Sea making a pretty large Bay on the North side A mile within the  Point on the Sandy Bay close by the Sea there is a poor small  Indian  Village called  Sancta Hellena  the Land about it is low sandy and barren there are no Trees nor Grass growing near it neither do the  Indians  produce any Fruit Grain or Plant but WaterMelons only which are large and very sweet There is no fresh Water at this place nor near it therefore the Inhabitants are obliged to fetch all their Water from the River  Colanche  which is in the bottom of the Bay about leagues from it Not far from this Town on the Bay close by the Sea about paces from highwater mark there is a sort of  bitumenous  matter boils out of a little hole in the Earth it is like thin  Tar  The  Spaniards  call it  Al∣gatrane  By much boiling it becomes hard like Pitch It is frequently used by the  Spaniards  instead of Pitch and the  Indians  that inhabit here save it in Jars It boils up most at high Water and then the  Indians  are ready to receive it These  Indians  are Fishermen and go out to Sea on Barklogs Their chief subsistence is Maiz most of which they get from Ships that come hither from  Algatrane  There is good Anchoring to leeward of the Point right a gainst the Village but on the West side of the Point it is deep Water and no anchoring The  Spaniards  do report that there was once a very rich Ship dri∣ven ashoar here in calm for want of Wind to work her As soon as ever she struck she heel'd of to Sea or fathom Water where she lies to this day none having attempted to fish for her because she lies deep and there falls in here a great high Sea When we were abrest of this Point we sent away our Canoas in the night to take the  Indian  Village They landed in the Morning betimes close by the Town and took some Prisoners They took likewise a small Bark which the  Indians  had set on fire but our Men quenched it and took the  Indian  that did it  who being asked wherefore he set the Bark on fire said that there was an Order from the ViceRoy lately set out commanding all Seamen to burn their Vessels if atttack'd by us and betake them∣selves to their Boats There was another Bark in a small Cove a Mile from the Village thither our Men went thinking to take her but the Seamen that were aboard set her in Flames and fled In the Evening our Men came aboard and brought the small Bark with them the fire of which they had quenched and then we returned again towards  Plata  where we arrived the th day of  Septem∣ber  In the Evening we sent out some Men in our Bark lately taken and Canoas to an  Indian  Village called  Manta  or leagues to the Westward of Cape St  Lorenzo  hoping there to get other Priso∣ners for we could not learn from those we took at Point St  Hellena  the reason why the ViceRoy should give such Orders to burn the Ships They had a fresh Seabreez till a Clock at Night and then it proved calm wherefore they rowed away with their Canoas as near to the Town as they thought convenient and lay still till day  Manta  is a small  Indian  Village on the Main di∣stant from the Island  Plata  or leagues It stands so advantageously to be seen being built on a small Ascent that it makes a very fair Prospect to the Sea yet but a few poor scattering  Indian  Houses There is a very fine Church adorned with a great deal of carved Work It was formerly a Habitation of  Spa∣niards  but they are all removed from hence now The Land about it is dry and sandy bearing only a few shrubby Trees These  Indians  plant no man∣ner of Grain or Root but are supplied from other places and commonly keep a stock of Provision to relieve Ships that want for this is the first Settle∣ment that Ships can touch at which come from  Pa∣nama  bound to  Lima  or any other Port in  Pern  The Land being dry and sandy is not fit to produce Crops of Maiz which is the reason they plant none There is a Spring of good Water between the Village and the Seas  On the back of the Town a pretty way up in the Country there is a very high Mountain towr∣ing up like a SugarLoaf called  MonteChristo  It is a very good Seamark for there is none like it on all the Coast The Body of this Mountain bears due South from  Manta  About a mile and half from the shore right against the Village there is a Rock which is very dangerous because it never appears above Water neither doth the Sea break on it be∣cause here is seldom any great Sea yet it is now so well known that all Ships bound to this place do easily avoid it A mile within this Rock there is good anchoring in or fathom Water good hard Sand and clear Ground And a Mile from the Road on the Westside there is a shoal running out a Mile into the Sea From  Manta  to Cape  St Lorenzo  the Land is plain and even of an indifferent heighth See a further Account of these Coasts in the Ap∣pendix  As soon as ever the day appear'd our Men landed and marched towards the Village which was about a Mile and a half from their Land place Some of the  Indians  who were stirring saw them coming and alarmed their Neighbours so that all that were able got away They took only two old Women who both said that it was reported that a great many Enemies were come over Land thro' the Country of  Darien  into the  South Seas  and that they were at present in Canoas and Periagoes and that the ViceRoy upon this News had set out the foremen∣tioned order for burning their own Ships Our Men found no sort of Provision here the ViceRoy having likewise sent orders to all Seaports to  keep no Provision but just to supply themselves These Women also said that the  Manta Indians  were sent over to the Island  Plata  to destroy all the Goats there which they performed about a Month agone With this News our Men returned again and arriv'd at  Plata  the next day  We lay still at the Island  Plata  being not resolved what to do till the d day of  Octob  and then Capt  Swan  in the  Cygnet of London  arriv'd there He was fitted out by very Eminent Merchants of that City on a design only to Trade with the  Spaniards  or  In∣dians  having a very considerable Cargo well sorted for these parts of the World but meeting with di∣vers Disappointments and being out of hopes to ob∣tain a Trade in these Seas his Men forced him to en∣tertain a Company of Privateers which he met with near  Nicoya  a Town whither he was going to seek a Trade and these Privateers were bound thither in Boats to get a Ship These were the Men that we had heard of at  Manta  they came over Land under the command of Capt  Peter Harris  Nephew to that Capt  Harris  who was killed before  Panama  Capt  Swan  was still commander of his own Ship and Capt  Harris  commanded a small Bark under Capt  Swan  There was much Joy on all sides when they arriv'd and immediately hereupon Capt  Davis  and Capt  Swan  consorted wishing for Capt  Eaton  again Our little Bark which was taken at  Santa Hellena  was immediately sent out to cruize while the Ships were fitting for Capt  Swan's  Ship being full of Goods was not fit to entertain his new Guest till the Goods were disposed of therefore he by the consent of the Supercargo's got up all his Goods on Deck and sold to any one that would buy upon Trust  the rest was thrown over board into the Sea except fine Goods as Silks Muslins Stockins  c  and  the Iron whereof he had a good Quantity  wrought and in Bars This was saved for Ballast  The third day after our Bark was sent to cruize she brought in a Prize of Tuns laden with Timber They took her in the Bay of  Guiaquil  she came from a Town of that Name and was bound to  Lima  The Commander of this Prize said that it was generally reported and believed at  Guiaquil  that the ViceRoy was fitting out Sail of Frigots to drive us out of the Seas This news made our unsettled Crew wish that they had been perswaded to accept of Captain  Eaton  's Company on reasonable Terms Capt  Davis  and Capt  Swan  had some discourse concerning Capt  Eaton  they at last concluded to send our small Bark towards the Coast of  Lima  as far as the Island  Lobos  to seek Capt  Eaton  This being approved by all hands she was clean'd the next day and sent away mann'd with Men of Capt  Davis  's and of  Swan  's Men and Capt  Swan  writ a Letter directed to Capt  Eaton  desiring his Company and the Isle of  Plata  was appointed for the general Rendezvous When this Bark was gone we turn'd another Bark which we had into a Fireship having or Carpenters who soon fixt her and while the Carpenters were at work about the Fireship we scrubbed and clean'd our Men of War as well as time and place would permit  The th day of  Oct  we finished our Business and the th day we sailed towards the Island  Lobos  where our Bark was ordered to stay for us or meet us again at  Plata  We had but litte Wind there∣fore it was the d day before we passed by Point  St Hellena  The th day we crossed over the Bay of  Guiaquil  The th day we doubled Cape  Blanco  This Cape is in lat d m It is counted the worst Cape in all the  South Seas  to double passing to the Southward for in all other places Ships may stand off to Sea or Leagues off if they find they  cannot get any thing under the Shoar but here they dare not do it for by relation of the  Spani∣ards  they find a Current setting N W which will carry a Ship off more in two Hours than they can run in again in five Besides setting to the North∣ward they lose ground therefore they always beat up in under the Shoar which ofttimes they find very difficult because the Wind commonly blows very strong at S S W or S by W without altering for here are never any Landwinds This Cape is of an indifferent heighth it is fenced with White Rocks to the Sea for which reason I believe it hath this Name The Land in the Country seems to be full of high steep rugged and barren Rocks  The d day of  November  we got as high as  Pay∣ta  We lay about six Leagues off shoar all the day that the  Spaniards  might not see us and in the E∣vening sent our Canoas ashoar to take it Mann'd with Men  Payta  is a small  Spanish  SeaPort Town in the lat of d m It is built on the Sand close by the Sea in a Nook Elbow or small Bay under a pret∣ty high Hill There are not above or Houses and two Churches The Houses are but low and ill built The Building in this Country of  Peru  is much alike on all the SeaCoast The Walls are built of Brick made with Earth and Straw kneaded toge∣ther They are about three foot long two foot broad and a foot and a half thick They never burn them but lay them a long time in the Sun to dry before they are used in building In some places they have no Roofs only Poles laid across from the side Walls and covered with Matts and then those Walls are carry'd up to a considerable heighth But where they build Roofs upon their Houses the Walls are not made so high as I said before The Houses in general all over this Kingdom are but meanly built one chief Reason with the common People especi∣ally  is the want of Materials to build withal for however it be more within Land yet here is nei∣ther Stone nor Timber to build with nor any Mate∣rials but such Brick as I have described and ever the Stone which they have in some places is so brit∣tle that you may rub it into Sand with your fingers Another reason why they build so meanly is be∣cause it never rains therefore they only endeavour to fence themselves from the Sun Yet their Walls which are built but with an ordinary sort of Brick in comparison with what is made in other parts of the World continue a long time as firm as when first made having never any Winds nor Rains to rot moulder or shake them However the richer sort have Timber which they make use of in build∣ing but it is brought from other places  This dry Country commences to the Northward from about Cape  Blanco  to  Coquimbo  in about d S having no Rain that I could ever observe or hear of nor any green thing growing in the Mountains nei∣ther yet in the Valleys except where here and there water'd with a few small Rivers dispers'd up and down So that the Northermost parts of this Tract of Land are supplied with Timber from  Guiaquil Galleo Tornato  and other places that are watered with Rains where there are plenty of all sorts of Timber In the South parts as about  Guasco  and  Coquimbo  they fetch their Timber from the Island  Chiloe  or other places thereabouts The Walls of Churches and rich Mens Houses are whitened with Lime both within and without and the Doors and Posts are very large and adorned with carved Work and the Beams also in the Churches The inside of the Houses are hung round with rich embroidered or painted Cloths They have likewise abundance of fine Pictures which adds no small Ornament to their House These I suppose they have from  Old Spain  But the Houses of  Payta  are none of them  so richly furnished The Churches were large and fairly carved At one end of the Town there was a small Fort close by the Sea but no great Guns in it This Fort only with Musquets will command all the Bay so as to hinder any Boats from landing There is another Fort on the top of the Hill just over the Town which commands both it and the lower Fort There is neither Wood nor Water to be had there they fetch their Water from an  Indian  Town called  Colan  about Leagues N N E from  Payta  for at  Colan  there is a small River of fresh Water which runs out into the Sea from whence Ships that touch at  Payta  are supplied with Water and other Refreshments as Fowls Hogs Plantains Yams and Maiz  Payta  being destitute of all these things only as they fetch them from  Colon  as they have occasion  The  Indians  of  Colan  are all Fishermen they go out to Sea and fish for Barklogs Barklogs are made of many round Logs of Wood in manner of a Raft and very different according to the use that they are designed for or the humour of the people that make them or the matter that they are made of If they are made for fishing then they are on∣ly or Logs of light Wood of or foot long plac'd by the side of each other pinn'd fast together with wooden Pins and bound hard with Withes The Logs are so placed that the middlemost are longer than those by the sides especially at the head or forepart which grows narrower gradually into an angle or point the better to cut through the Water Others are made to carry Goods The bot∣tom of these is made of or great Trees of a∣bout or foot long fasten'd like the other side to side and so shaped on the top of these they place another shorter row of Trees across them pinn'd fast to each other and then pinn'd to the un∣dermost row this double row of Planks makes the  bottom of the Float and of a considerable breadth  From this bottom the Raft is raised to about foo  higher with rows of Posts sometimes set upright and supporting a Floor or two but those I observ'd were rais'd by thick Trees laid across each other as in Woodpiles only not close together as in the bottom of the Float but at the ends and sides only so as to leave the middle all hollow like a Chamber except that here and there a Beam goes across it to keep the Float more compact In this Hollow at about foot heighth from the Beams at the bottom they lay small Poles along and close together to make a floor for another Room on the top of which also they lay another such floor made of Poles and the enterances in both these Rooms is only by creep∣ing between the great traverse Trees which make the Walls of this SeaHouse The lowest of these stories serves as a Cellar there they lay great stones for Ballast and their Jars of fresh Water closed up and whatever may bear being wet for by the weight of the Ballast and Cargo the bottom of this Room and of the whole Vessel is sunk so deep as to lie or feet within the surface of the Water The second story is for the Seamen and their ne∣cessaries Above this second story the Goods are stowed to what heighth they please usually about or feet and kept together by poles set upright quite round only there is a little space abaft for the Steersman for they have a large Rudder and afore for the Firehearth to dress their Victuals espe∣cially when they make long Voyages as from  Lima  to  Truxillo  or  Guiaquil  or  Panama  which last Voy∣age is or leagues In the midst of all among the Goods rises a Mast to which is fastned a large Sail as in our WestCountry Barges in the  Thames  They always go before the Wind being unable to Ply against it and therefore are fit only for these Seas where the Wind is always in a manner the  same not varying above a point or two all the way from  Lima  till such time as they come into the Bay of  Panama  and even there they meet with no great Sea but sometimes Northerly winds and then they lower their Sails and drive before it waiting a change All their care then is only to keep off from Shoar for they are so made that they cannot sink at Sea These Rafts carry or Tuns of Goods and upwards their Cargo is chiefly Wine Oil Flower Sugar  Quito  Cloth Soap Goatskins drest  c  The Float is manag'd usually by or Men who being unable to return with it against the Tradewind when they come to  Panama  dispose of the goods and bottom together getting a passage back again for themselves in some Ship or Boat bound to the Port they came from and there they make a new Barklog for their next Cargo  The smaller sort of Barklogs described before which lie flat on the Water and are used for Fish∣ing or carrying Water to Ships or the like half a Tun or a Tun at a time are more governable than the other tho' they have Masts and Sails too With these they go out at night by the help of the Landwind which is seldom wanting on this Coast and return back in the day time with the Seawind  This sort of Floats are used in many places both in the  East  and  WestIndies  On the Coast of  Coro∣mandel  in the  EastIndies  they call them  Catamarans  These are but one Log or two sometimes of a sort of light Wood and are made without Sail or Rud∣der and so small that they carry but one Man whose legs and breech are always in the Water and he manages his Log with a Paddle appearing at a distance like a Man sitting on a Fish's back  The Country about  Payta  is mountainous and bar∣ren like all the rest of the Kingdom of  Peru  There is no Towns of consequence nearer it than  Piura  which is a large Town in the Country miles di∣stant  It lieth by report of our  Spanish  Prisoners in a Valley which is water'd with a small River that disembogues it self into the Bay of  Chirapee  in about d of North latitude This Bay is nearer to  Piura  than  Payta  yet all Goods imported by Sea for  Piura  are landed at  Payta  for the Bay of  Chirapee  is full of dangerous sholes and therefore not frequented by shipping The Road of  Payta  is one of the best on the Coast of  Peru  It is sheltered from the Southwest by a Point of Land which makes a large Bay and smooth Water for Ships to ride in There is room enough for a good Fleet of Ships and good anchoring in any depth from fathom Water to fathom Right against the Town the nearer the Town the Shallower the Water and the smoother the riding it is clean Sand all over the Bay Most Ships passing either to the North or the South touch at this place for Water for tho' here is none at the Town yet those  Indian  Fishermen of  Colan  will and do supply all Ships very reasonably and good Wa∣ter is much prized on all this Coast through the scar∣city of it  November  the d at a clock in the morning our Men landed about miles to the South of the Town and took some Prisoners that were sent thi∣  her to watch for fear of us and these Prisoners  aid That the Governour of  Piura  came with  rmed Men to  Payta  the night before purposely to  ppose our landing there if we should attempt it  Our Men marched directly to the Fort on the  ill and took it without the loss of one Man Here∣upon the Governor of  Piura  with all his Men and  he Inhabitants of the Town ran away as fast as  hey could Then our Men entered the Town and  ound it emptied both of Money and Goods there was not so much as a Meal of Victuals left for them The Prisoners told us a Ship had been here a lit∣tle before and burnt a great Ship in the Road but  did not land their Men and that here they put a∣shore all their Prisoners and Pilots We knew this must be Captain  Eaton  's Ship which had done this and by these circumstances we supposed he was gone to the  EastIndies  it being always design'd by him The Prisoners told us also That since Capt  Eaton  was here a small Bark had been off the Harbour and taken a pair of Barklogs a fishing and made the Fishermen bring aboard or Jars of fresh Water This we supposed was our Bark that was sent to rhe  Lobos  to seek Capt  Eaton  In the Evening we came in with our Ships and anchored before the Town in fathom Water near a Mile from the Shore Here we staid till the sixth day in hopes to get a Ransom for the Town Our Captains demanded Packs of Flower pound of Sugar Jars of Wine and Jars of Water to be brought off to us but we got nothing of it Therefore Captain  Swan  ordered the Town to be fired which was presently done Then all our Men came aboard and Captain  Swan  ordered the Bark which Captain  Harris  commanded to be burnt because she did not sail well  At Night when the Landwind came off we sailed from hence towards  Lobos  The th Day in the Evening we saw a Sail bearing N W by N as far as we could well discern her on our Deck We im∣mediately chased separating our selves the better to meet her in the Night but we mist her Therefore the next Morning we again trimm'd sharp and made the best of our way to the  Lobos de la Mar  The th day we had sight of the Island  Lobos de Terra  It bore East from us we stood in towards it and betwixt and a Clock in the Night came to an Anchor at the N E end of the Island in fathom Water This Island at Sea is of an indifferent height and appears like  Lobos de la Mar  About a quarter of a Mile from the Northend there is a great hollow  Rock and a good Channel between where there is fathom Water The th day we went ashore and found abundance of Penguins and Boobies and Seal in great quantities We sent aboard of all these to be drest for we had not tasted any Flesh in a great while before therefore some of us did eat very heartily Capt  Swan  to encourage his Men to eat this course Flesh would commend it for extraordi∣nary good Food comparing the Seal to a roasting Pig the Boobies to Hens and the Penguins to Ducks This he did to train them to live contentedly on course Meat not knowing but we might be forced to make use of such Food before we departed out of these Seas for it is generally seen among Privateers that nothing emboldens them sooner to mutiny than want which we could not well suffer in a place where there are such quantities of these Animals to be had if Men could be perswaded to be content with them  In the Afternoon we sailed from  Lobos de Terra  with the Wind at S by E and arriv'd at  Lobos de la Mar  on the th day Here we found a Letter left by our Bark that was sent to seek Capt  Eaton  by which we understood that Captain  Eaton  had been there but was gone before they arrived and had left no Letter to advise us which way he was gone and that our Bark was again returned to  Plata  in hopes to find us there or meet us by the way else resolving to stay for us there We were sorry to hear that Capt  Eaton  was gone for now we did not ex∣pect to meet with him any more in these Seas  The st day we sent out our  Moskito  Strikers for Turtle who brought aboard enough to serve both Ships Companies and this they did all the time that we abode here While we lay at this Island Capt  Swan  made new Yards squarer than those he had before and made his Sails larger and our Ships Company in the mean time split Plank for Firewood  and put aboard as many Planks as we could conveniently stow for other uses Here being Plank enough of all sorts which we had brought hither in the first Prize that we took and left here  The th day in the Evening we saw a small Bark about Leagues N N W from the Island but we supposing her to be our own Bark did not go after her The next Morning she was two Leagues South of the Island standing off to Sea but we did not now chace her neither altho' we knew she was not our Bark for being to Windward of us she could have made her escape if we had chaced her This Bark as we were afterwards inform'd was sent out purposely to see if we were at this Island Her Orders were not to come too near only to ap∣pear in  ight they supposing that if we were here we should soon be after her as indeed it was a wonder we had not chaced her But our not doing so and lying close under the Island undiscern'd by them was a great occasion of our coming upon  Pu∣na  afterwards unexectedly they being now without fear of any Enemy so near them  The th day we scrubbed our Ships bottom in∣tending to sail the next day towards  Guiaquil  it be∣ing concluded upon to attempt that Town before we returned again to  Plata  Accordingly on the th day in the Morning we loosed from hence steering directly for the Bay of  Guiaquil  This Bay runs in between Cape  Blanco  on the Southside and Point  Chandy  on the North About Leagues from C  Blanco  near the bottom of the Bay there is a small Island called  Santa Clara  which lies East and West It is of an indifferent length and it appears like a dead Man stretched out in a Shroud The Eastend represents the Head and the Westend the Feet Ships that are bound into the River of  Guia∣quil  pass on the Southside to avoid the sholes which lie on the Northside of it whereon for  Ships  have heen lost It is reported by the  Spaniards  that there is a very rich Wreck lies on the Northside of that Island not far from it and that some of the Plate hath been taken up by one who came from  Old Spain  with a Patent from the King to fish in those Seas for Wrecks but he dying the Project ceas'd and the Wreck still remains as he left it only the  Indians  by stealth do sometimes take up some of it and they might have taken up much more if it were not for the  Catfish  which swarms hereabouts  The  Catfish  is much like a  Whiting  but the Head is flatter and bigger It hath a great wide Mouth and certain small Strings pointing out from each side of it like  Cats Whiskers  and for that reason it is call'd a  Catfish  It hath three Fins one growing on the top of his Back and one on either side Each of these Fins have a stiff sharp Bone which is very ve∣nomous if it strikes into a Man's Flesh therefore it it is dangerous diving where many of these Fish are The  Indians  that adventured to search this Wreck have to their sorrow experienc'd it some having lost their Lives others the use of their Limbs by it This we were informed by an  Indian  who himself had been fishing on it by stealth I my self have known some white Men that have lost the use of their Hands only by a small prick with the Fin of these Fish Therefore when we catch them with a Hook we tread on them to take the Hook out of their Mouths for otherwise in flurting about as all Fish will when first taken they might acciden∣tally strike their sharp Fins into the Hands of those that caught them Some of these Fish are or pound weight some again in some particular pla∣ces are none of them bigger than a Man's Thumb but their Fins are all alike venomous They use to be at the Mouths of Rivers or where there is much Mud and Oaze and they are found all over the  American  Coast both in the  North  and  SouthSea  at  least in the hot Countries as also in the  EastIndies  where sailing with Captain  Minchin  among certain Islands near the  Streights  of  Malacca  he pointed to an Island at which he told me he lost the use of his hand by one of these only in going to take the Hook out of its mouth The wound was scarce visible yet his Hand was much swoln and the Pain lasted about weeks during most part of which the raging heat of it was almost ready to distract him How∣ever though the Bony Fins of these Fish are so ve∣nomous yet the Bones in their Bodies are not so at least we never perceived any such effect in eating the Fish and their Flesh is very sweet delicious and wholesome Meat  From the Island  Santa Clara  to  Punta Arena  is leagues E N E This  Punta Arena  or  Sandy Point  is the Westermost Point of the Island  Puna  Here all Ships bound into the River of  Guiaquil  anchor and must wait for a Pilot the enterance being very dan∣gerous for Strangers  The Island  Puna  is a pretty large flat low Island stretching East and West about or leagues long and about or leagues wide The Tide runs very strong all about this Island but so many different ways by reason of the Branches Creeks and Rivers that run into the Sea near it that it casts up many dangerous sholes on all sides of it There is in the Island only one  Indian  Town on the South∣side of it close by the Sea and leagues from  Point Arena  which Town is also called  Puna  The  Indians  of this Town are all Seamen and are the only Pi∣lots in these Seas especially for this River Their chiefest employment when they are not at Sea is fishing These Men are obliged by the  Spaniards  to keep good watch for Ships that anchor at Point  Are∣na  which as I said before is leagues from the Town  Puna  The place where they keep this watch is at a Point of Land on the Island  Puna  that starts  out into the Sea from whence they can see all Ships that anchor at Point  Arena  The  Indians  come thither in the morning and return at night on Horseback From this watching Point to Point  Arena  it is leagues all drowned MangroveLand And in the midway between these two Points is ano∣ther small Point where these  Indians  are obliged to keep another Watch when they fear an Enemy The Centinel goes thither in a Canoa in the morn∣ing and returns at night for there is no coming thither by Land through that Mangrove marshy ground The middle of the Island  Puna  is Savannah or Pasture There are some ridges of good Wood∣land which is of a light Yellow or sandy Mould producing large tall Trees most unknown even to Travellers But there are plenty of  PalmetoTrees  which because I am acquainted with I shall de∣scibe The  PalmetoTree  is about the bigness of an ordinary Ash It is about foot high the body straight without any limb or branch or leaf ex∣cept at the head only where it spreads forth into many small Branches not half so big as a Mans Arm some no bigger than ones Finger These Branches are about or foot long clear from any knot At the end of the Branch there groweth one broad leaf about the bigness of a large Fan This when it first shoots forth grows in folds like a Fan when it is closed and still as it grows bigger so it opens till it becomes like a Fan spread abroad It is strengthened towards the stalk with many small ribs springing from thence and growing into the leaf which as they grow near the end of the leaf grow thinner and smaller The leaves that make the brush part of the Flagbrooms which are brought in∣to  England  grow just in this manner and are in∣deed a small kind of  Palmeto  for there are of them of several dimensions In  Bermudas  and elsewhere they make Hats Baskets Brooms Fans to blow  the fire instead of Bellows with many other House∣implements of  Palmetoleaves  On the Ridges where these Trees grow the  Indians  have here and there Plantations of Maiz Yams and Potatoes  There are in the Town of  Puna  about Houses and a small Church The Houses stand all on Posts or foot high with Ladders on the outside to go up into them I did never see the like Building any where but among the  Malayans  in the  EastIndies  They are thatched with  Palmetoleaves  and their Chambers well boarded in which last they exceed the  Malayans  The best place for Ships to lie at an Anchor is against the middle of the Town There is fathom Water within a Cables length of the shoar and good soft deep Oaze where Ships may careen or hale ashoar it stows or foot Wa∣ter up and down  From  Puna  to  Guiaquil  is reckoned leagues It is league before you come to the River of  Guiaquil  's mouth where it is above two mile wide from thence upwards the River lies pretty streight with∣out any considerable turnings Both sides of the Ri∣ver are low swampy Land overgrown with Red Mangroves so that there is no landing Four mile before you come to the Town of  Guiaquil  there's a low Island standing in the River This Island di∣vides the River into two parts making very fair Channels for Ships to pass up and down The S W Channel is the widest the other is as deep but nar∣rower and narower yet by reason of many Trees and Bushes which spread over the River both from the Main and from the Island and there are also several great stumps of Trees standing upright in the Water on either side The Island is above a mile long From the upper part of the Island to the Town of  Guiaquil  is almost a league and near as much from one side of the River to the other In that spacious place Ships of the greatest burthen may  ride afloat but the best place for Ships is nearest to that part of the Land where the Town stands and this place is seldom without Ships  Guiaquil  stands facing the Island close by the River partly on the side and partly at the foot of a gentle Hill decli∣ning towards the River by which the lower part of it is often overflown There are two Forts one standing on the low Ground the other on the Hill This Town makes a very fine prospect it being beautify'd with several Churches and other good Buildings Here lives a Governor who as I have been informed hath his Patent from the King of  Spain Guiaquil  may be reckoned one of the chiefest Seaports in the  South Seas  The Commodities which are exported from hence are Cacao Hides Tallow Sarsaparilla and other Drugs and WoollenCloth commonly called Cloth of  Quito  The Cacao grows on both sides of the River a∣bove the Town It is a small Nut like the  Campea∣chy  Nut I think the smallest of the two they pro∣duce as much Cacoa here as serves all the Kingdom of  Peru  and much of it is sent to  Acapulco  and from thence to the  Phillipine Islands  Sarsaparilla grows in the Water by the sides of the River as I have been informed  The  Quito  Cloth comes from a rich Town in the Country within Land called  Quito  There is a great deal made both Serges and BroadCloth This Cloth is not very fine but is worn by the common sort of People throughout the whole Kingdom of  Peru  This and all other Commodities which come from  Quito  are shipt off at  Guiaquil  for other Parts and all imported Goods for the City of  Qui∣to  pass by  Guiaquil  By which it may appear that  Guiaquil  is a Place of no mean Trade  Quito  as I have been informed is a very popu∣lous City seated in the heart of the Country It is inhabited partly by  Spaniards  but the major part of  its Inhabitants are  Indians  under the  Spanish  Go∣vernment  It is environed with Mountains of a vast heighth from whose bowels many great Rivers have their rise These Mountains abound in Gold which by violent Rains is wash'd with the Sand into the adjacent Brooks where the  Indians  resort in Troops washing away the Sand and putting up the Golddust in their Calabashes or Gourd Shells But for the manner of the gathering the Gold I refer you too Mr  Wafer  's Book only I shall remark here that  Quito  is the place in all the Kingdom of  Peru  that abounds most with this Rich Metal as I have been often informed  The Country is subject to great Rains and very thick Fogs especially the Valleys For that reason it is very unwholesome and sickly The chiefest Distempers are Fevers violent Headach Pains in the Bowels and Fluxes I know no place where Gold is found but what is very unhealthy As I shall more particularly relate when I come to speak of  Acbin  in the Isle of  Sumatra  in the  EastIndies Guia∣quil  is not so sickly as  Quito  and other Towns farther within Land yet in comparison with the Towns that are on the Coast of  Mare Pacifico  South of Cape  Blanco  it is very sickly  It was to this Town of  Guiaquil  that we were bound therefore we left our Ships off Cape  Blanco  and ran into the Bay of  Guiaquil  with our Bark and Canoas steering in for the Island  Santa Clara  where we arrived the next day after we left our Ships and from thence we sent away two Canoas the next evening to Point  Arena  At this Point there are abundance of Oysters and other Shellfish as Cockles and Muscles therefore the  Indians  of  Puna  often come hither to get these Fish Our Canoas got over before day and absconded in a Creek to wait for the coming of the  Puna Indians  The next morning  some of them according to their custom came thither on Barklogs at the latter part of the Ebb and were all taken by our Men The next day by their advice the two Watchmen of the  Indian  Town  Puna  were taken by our Men and all its Inhabitants not one escaping The next Ebb they took a small Bark laden with  Quitocloth  She came from  Guia∣quil  that Tide and was bound to  Lima  they having advice that we were gone off the Coast by the Bark which I said we saw while we lay at the Island  Lo∣bos  The Master of this ClothBark informed our Men that there were Barks coming from  Guia∣quil  laden with Negroes he said they would come from thence the next Tide The same Tide of Ebb that they took the Clothbark they sent a Canoa to our Bark where the biggest part of the Men were to hasten them away with speed to the  Indian  Town The Bark was now riding at Point  Arena  and the next Flood she came with all the Men and the rest of the Canoas to  Puna  The Tide of Flood being now far spent we lay at this Town till the last of the Ebb and then rowed away leaving Men aboard our Bark who were ordered to lie still till a clock the next morning and not to fire at any Boat or Bark but after that time they might fire at any ob∣ject for it was supposed that before that time we should be masters of  Guiaquil  We had not rowed above mile before we met and took one of the three Barks laden with Negroes the Master of her said that the other two would come from  Guiaquil  the next Tide of Ebb We cut her Mainmast down and left her at an Anchor It was now strong Flood and therefore we rowed with all speed to∣wards the Town in hopes to get thither before the Flood was down but we found it farther than we did expect it to be or else our Canoas being very full of men did not row so fast as we would have them The day broke when we were two leagues  from the Town and then we had not above an hours Flood more therefore our Captains desired the  Indian  Pilot to direct us to some Creek where we might abscond all day which was immediately done and one Canoa was sent toward  Puna  to our Bark to order them not to move nor fire till the next day But she came too late to countermand the first orders for the two Barks before mentioned laden with Negroes came from the Town the last quarter of the evening Tide and lay in the River close by the shoar on one side and we rowed upon the other side and mist them neither did they see nor hear us Assoon as the Flood was spent the two Barks weighed and went down with the Ebb towards  Puna  Our Bark seeing them coming di∣rectly towards them and both full of men supposed that we by some Accident had been destroyed and that the two Barks were Mann'd with  Spanish  Sol∣diers and sent to take our Ships and therefore they fired Guns at them a league before they came near The two  Spanish  Barks immediately came to an Anchor and the Masters got into their Boats and rowed for the shoar but our Canoa that was sent from us took them both The firing of these Guns made a great disorder among our advanced Men for most of them did believe they were heard at  Guiaquil  and that therefore it could be no profit to lie still in the Creek but either row away to the Town or back again to our Ships It was now quarter ebb therefore we could not move upwards if we had been dispos'd so to do At length Captain  Davis  said he would immediately land in the Creek where they lay and march directly to the Town if but Men would accompany him and without saying more words he landed among the Mangroves in the Marshes Those that were so minded followed him to the number of or Captain  Swan  lay still with the rest of the Party in the Creek  for they thought it impossible to do any good that way Captain  Davis  and his Men were absent about hours and then returned all wet and quite tired and could not find any passage out into the firm Land He had been so far that he almost despair'd of getting back again for a Man cannot pass thro' those red Mangroves but with very much labour When Capt  Davis  was return'd we concluded to be going towards the Town the beginning of the next flood and if we found that the Town was alarm'd we purposed to return again without attempting any thing there As soon as it was flood we rowed away and passed by the Island thro' the N E Channel which is the narrowest There are so many Stumps in the River that it is very dangerous passing in the night and that is the time we always take for such Attempts for the River runs very swift and one of our Canoas stuck on a stump and had certainly overset if she had not been immediately rescued by others When we were come almost to the end of the Island there was a Musquet fired at us out of the Bushes on the Main We then had the Town open before us and presently saw lighted Torches or Candles all the Town over whereas before the Gun was fired there was but one Light there∣fore we now concluded we were discovered Yet many of our Men said that it was a Holyday the next day as it was indeed and that therefore the  Spaniards  were making Fireworks which they often do in the night against such times We rowed therefore a little farther and found firm Land and Cap∣tain  Davis  pitch'd his Canoa ashore and landed with his Men Captain  Swan  and most of his Men did not think it convenient to attempt any thing seeing the Town was alarmed but at last being upbraided with Cowardize Captain  Swan  and his Men landed also The place where we landed was about mile from the Town it was all overgrown with Woods  so thick that we could not march through in the Night and therefore we sat down waiting for the light of the Day We had two  Indian  Pilots with us one that had been with us a Month who having re∣ceived some Abuses from a Gentleman of  Guiaquil  to be revenged offered his Service to us and we found him very faithful The other was taken by us not above or days before and he seemed to be as willing as the other to assist us This latter was led by one of Captain  Davis  's Men who shewed himself very forward to go to the Town and up∣braided others with faintheartedness Yet this Man as he afterwards confessed notwithstanding his Courage privately cut the String that the Guide was made fast with and let him go to the Town by himself not caring to follow him but when he thought the Guide was got far enough from us he cried out that the Pilot was gone and that some Body had cut the Cord that tied him This put every Man in a moving Posture to seek the  Indian  but all in vain and our Consternation was great being in the dark and among Woods so the design was wholly dashed for not a Man after that had the heart to speak of going farther Here we staid till day and then rowed out into the middle of the River where we had a fair view of the Town which as I said before makes a very pleasant pros∣pect We lay still about half an hour being a mile or something better from the Town They did not fire one Gun at us nor we at them Thus our design on  Guiaquil  fail'd yet Captain  Townely  and Capt  Francois Gronet  took it a little while after this When we had taken a full view of the Town we rowed over the River where we went ashore to a Beef Estantion or Farm and kill'd a Cow which we drest and eat We staid there till the Evening Tide of Ebb and then rowed down the River and the th day in the Morning arrived at  Pima  In our  way thither we went aboard the Barks laden with Negroes that lay at their Anchor in the River and carried the Barks away with us There were Negroes in Barks all lusty young Men and Women When we came to  Puna  we sent a Canoa to Point  Arena  to see if the Ships were come thither The th day she returned again with tydings that they were both there at Anchor There∣fore in the Afternoon we all went aboard of our Ships and carry'd the ClothBark with us and about of the stoutest NegroMen leaving their Barks with the rest and out of these also Capt  Davis  and Capt  Swan  chose about or apiece and turn'd the rest ashore  There was never a greater oportunity put into the Hands of Men to enrich themselves than we had to have gone with these Negroes and settled our selves at  Santa Maria  on the Isthmus of  Darien  and employed them in getting Gold out of the Mines there Which might have been done with ease For about Months before this Capt  Har∣ris  who was now with us coming over Land from the  North Seas  with his Body of Privateers had routed the  Spaniards  away from the Town and GoldMines of  Santa Maria  so that they had never attempted to settle there again since Add to this that the  Indian  Neighbourhood who were mortal Enemies to the  Spaniards  and had been flusht by their Successes against them through the assistance of the Privateers for several years were our fast Friends and ready to receive and assist us We had as I have said Negroes to work for us we had Tun of Flower that lay at the  Gallapagos  there was the River of  Santa Maria  where we could careen and fit our Ships and might fortifie the mouth so that if all the strength the  Spaniards  have in  P  had come against us we could have kept them out If they lay with Guardships of Strength to keep us  in yet we had a great Country to live in and a great Nation of  Indians  that were our Friends Be∣side which was the principal thing we had the  North Seas  to befriend us from whence we could export our selves or Effects or import Goods or Men to our assistance for in a short time we should have had assistance from all parts of the  WestIndies  many thousands of Privateers from  Jamaica  and the  French  Islands especially would have flockt over to us and long before this time we might have been Masters not only of those Mines the richest GoldMines ever yet found in  America  but of all the Coast as high as  Quito  And much more than I say might then probably have been done  But these may seem to the Reader but Golden Dreams To leave them therefore The th day we sailed from Point  Arena  towards  Plata  to seek our Bark that was sent to the Island  Lobos  in search of Captain  Eaton  We were Ships in Company and Barks and the th day we arrived at  Plata  but found no Bark there nor any Letter The next day we went over to the Main to fill Water and in our Passage met our Bark She had been a second time at the Island  Lobos  and not finding us was coming to  Plata  again They had been in some want of Provision since they left us and therefore they had been at  Santa Hellena  and taken it where they got as much Maize as served them or days and that with some Fish and Turtle which they struck lasted them till they came to the Island  Lobos de Terra  They got Boobies and Penguins Eggs of which they laid in a store and went from thence to  Lobos de la Mar  where they replenished their stock of Eggs and salted up a few young Seal for fear they should want And being thus victualled they returned again towards  Plata  When our Water was fill'd we went over again to the Island  Plata  There we parted the Cloths that w  re taken in the  ClothBark into two Lots or Shares Captain  Da∣vis  and his Men had one part and Captain  Swan  and his Men had the other part The Bark which the Cloth was in Captain  Swan  kept for a Tender At this time here were at  Plata  a great many large Turtles which I judge came from the  Gallapago's  for I had never seen any here before tho' I had been here several times This was their Couplingtime which is much sooner in the Year here than in the  WestIndies  properly so called Our Strikers brought aboard every day more than we could eat Captain  Swan  had no Striker and therefore had no Turtle but what was sent him from Captain  Davis  and all his Flower too he had from Captain  Davis  But since our Disappointment at  Guiaquil  Capt  Davis  's Men murmured against Captain  Swan  and did not willingly give him any Provision because he was not so forward to go thither as Capt  Davis  How∣ever at last these differences were made up and we concluded to go into the Bay of  Panama  to a Town called  La Velia  but because we had not Ca∣noas enough to land our Men we were resolved to search some Rivers where the  Spaniards  have no Commerce there to get  Indian  Canoas  CHAP VII  They leave the Isle of  Plata  Cape  Passao  The Coast between that and Cape  St Francisco  and from thence on to  Panama  The

account of tbe Strength of the  Spanish Fleet  and of the  Privateers  and the  Engagement  between them  THE d day of  Decemb  we sailed from the Island  Plata  towards the Bay of  Panama  The Wind at S S E a fine brisk gale and fine Wea∣ther The next morning we past by Cape  Passao  This Cape is in lat d m South of the Equa∣tor It runs out into the Sea with a high round Point which seems to be divided in the midst It is bald against the Sea but within Land and on both sides it is full of short Trees The Land in the Country is very high and Mountainous and it ap∣pears to be very woody Between Cape  Passao  and Cape  St Francisco  the Land by the Sea is full of small Points making as many little sandy Bays between them and is of an indifferent heighth  covered with Trees of divers sorts so that sailing by this Coast you see nothing but a vast Grove or Wood which is so much the more pleasant because the Trees are of several Forms both in respect to their Growth and Colour  Our design was as I said in my first Chapter to search for Canoas in some River where the  Spaniards  have neither Settlement nor Trade with the native  Indians  We had  Spanish  Pilots and  Indians  bred un∣der the  Spaniards  who were able to carry us into any Harbour or River belonging to the  Spaniards  but were wholly unacquainted with those Rivers which were not frequented by the  Spaniards  There are many such unsrequented Rivers between  Plata  and  Panama  Indeed all the way from the Line to the Gulph of  St Michaels  or even to  Panama  it self the Coast is not inhabited by any  Spaniards  nor are the  Indians  that inhabit there any way un∣der their subjection except only near the Isle  Gal∣lo  where on the Banks of a Gold River or two there are some  Spaniards  who work there to find Gold  Now our Pilots being at a loss on these less fre∣quented Coasts we supply'd that defect out of the  Spanish  Pilotbooks which we took in their Ships These we found by experience to be very good Guides Yet nevertheless the Country in many Places by the Sea being low and full of openings Creeks and Rivers it is somewhat difficult to find any particular River that a Man designs to go to where he is not well acquainted  This however could be no discouragement to us for one River might probably be as well furnished with  Indian  Canoas as another and if we found them it was to us indifferent where yet we pitcht on the River  St Jago  not because the  were not other Rivers as large and as likely to be inhabited with  Indians  as it but because that River was not far from  Gallo  an Island where our Ships could an∣chor  safely and ride securely We past by Cape St  Francisco  meeting with great and continued Rains The Land by the Sea to the North of the Cape is low and extraordinary woody the Trees are very thick and seem to be of a prodigious height and bigness From Cape St  Francisco  the Land runs more Easterly into the Bay of  Panama  I take this Cape to be its Bounds on the South side and the Isles of  Cobaya  or  Quibo  to bound it on the N side Between this Cape and the Isle  Gallo  there are many large and navigable Rivers We passed by them all till we came to the River St  Jago  This River is near d North of the Equator It is large and navigable some leagues up and leagues from the Sea it divides it self into two parts making an Island that is leagues wide against the Sea The widest branch is that on the S W side of the Island Both Branches are very deep but the Mouth of the narrower is so choakt with sholes that at low wa∣ter even Canoas can't enter Above the Island it is a league wide and the Stream runs pretty straight and very swift The Tide flows about leagues up the River but to what heighth I know not Probably the River hath its Original from some of the Rich Mountains near the City  Quito  and it runs through a Country as rich in Soil as perhaps any in the World especially when it draws within or leagues of the Sea The Land there both on the Island and on the both sides of the River is of a black deep Mold producing extraordinary great tall Trees of many sorts such as usually grow in these hot Climates I shall only give an account of the  Cotton  and  Cabbagetrees  whereof there is great plenty and they are as large of their kinds as ever I saw  There are two sorts of  Cottontrees  one is call'd the Red the other the White  Cottontree  The white  Cottontree  grows like an Oak but generally  much bigger and taller than our Oaks The body is straight and clear from knots or boughs to the very head there it spreads forth many great Limbs just like an Oak The Bark is smooth and of a grey co∣lour the Leaves are as big as a large Plumb Leaf jagged at the edge they are oval smooth and of a dark green colour Some of these Trees have their bodies much bigger or foot high than nearer the ground being big bellied like Ninepins They bear a very fine sort of Cotton called Silk Cotton When this Cotton is ripe the Trees appear like our Appletrees in  England  when full of Blossoms If I do not mistake the Cotton falls down in  November  or  December  then the Ground is covered white with it This is not substantial and continuous like that which grows upon the Cottonshrubs in Plantati∣ons but like the Down of Thistles so that I did never know any use made of it in the  WestIndies  be∣cause it is not worth the Labour of gathering it but in the  EastIndies  the Natives gather and use it for Pillows It hath a small black Seed among it The Leaves of this Tree fall off the begining of  April  while the old Leaves are falling off the young ones spring out and in a weeks time the Tree casts off her old Robes and is cloathed in a new pleasant Garb The red Cottontree is like the other but hardly so big it bears no Cotton but its Wood is somewhat harder of the two yet both sorts are soft spungy Wood fit for no use that I know but only for Canoas which being straight and tall they are very good for but they will not last long espe∣cially if not drawn ashoar often and tarred other∣wise the Worm and the Water soon rot them They are the biggest Trees or perhaps Weeds rather in the  WestIndies  They are common in the  East  and  WestIndies  in good fat Land  As the Cotton is the biggest Tree in the Woods so the Cabbagetree is the tallest The Body is not  very big but very high and straight I have mea∣sured one in the Bay of  Campeachy  feet long as it lay on the Ground and there are some much higher It has no Limbs nor Boughs but at the head there are many Branches bigger than a Man's Arm These Branches are not cover'd but flat with Sharp edges they are or foot long A∣bout two foot from the Trunk the Branches shoot forth small long Leaves about aninch broad which grow so regularly on both sides of the Branch that the whole Branch seems to be but one Leaf made up of many small ones The Cabbage fruit shoots out in the midst of these Branches from the top of the Tree it is invested with many young Leaves or Branches which are ready to spread abroad as the old Branches drop and fall down The Cabbage it self when it is taken out of the Leaves which it seems to be folded in is as big as the small of a Man's Leg and a foot long it is as white as Milk and as sweet as a Nut if eaten raw and it is very sweet and wholesom if boiled Besides the Cab∣bage it self there grow out between the Cabbage and the large Bran  hes small twigs as of a Shrub about two foot long from their Stump At the end of those twigs which grows very thick together there hang Berries hard and round and as big as a Cherry These the Trees shed every year and they are very good for Hogs for this reason the  Spaniards  fine any who shall cut down any of these in their Woods The Body of the Tree is full of rings round it half a foot asunder from the bottom to the top The Bark is thin and brittle the Wood is black and very hard the heart or middle of the Tree is white Pith They do not climb to get the Cabbage but cut them down for should they ga∣ther it off the Tree as it stands yet its head being gone it soon dies These Trees are much used by Planters in  Jamaica  to board the sides of the Houses  for it is but splitting the Trunk into parts with an Axe and there are so many Planks Those Trees appear very pleasant and they beautifie the whole Wood spreading their green Branches above all other Trees  All this Country is subject to very great Rains so that this part of  Peru  pays for the dry weather which they have about  Lima  and all that Coast I believe that is one reason why the  Spaniards  have made such small discoveries in this and other Rivers on this Coast Another reason may be because it lies not so directly in their way for they do not Coast it a∣long in going from  Panama  to  Lima  but first go West∣ward as far as to the Keys or Isles of  Cobaya  for a Westerly wind and from thence stand over towards Cape  St Francisco  not touching any where usually till they come to  Manta  near Cape St  Lorenzo  In their return indeed from  Lima  to  Panama  they may keep along the Coast hereabouts but then their Ships are always laden whereas the light Ships that go from  Panama  are most at leisure to make disco∣veries A third reason may be the wildness and enmity of all the Natives on this Coast who are naturally fortified by their Rivers and vast Woods from whence with their Arrows they can easily an∣noy any that shall land there to assault them At this River particularly there are no  Indians  live with∣in leagues of the Sea and all the Country so far is full of impassable Woods so that to get at the  Indians  or the Mines and Mountains there is no way but by rowing up the River and if any who are Enemies to the Natives attempt this as the  Spaniards  are always hated by them they must all the way be exposed to the Arrows of those who would lie purposely in Ambush in the Woods for them These wild  Indians  have small Plantations of Maiz and good PlantainGardens for Plantains are their chiefest food They have also a few Fowls and Hogs  It was to this River that we were bound to seek for Canoas therefore the th supposing our selves to be abrest of it we went from our Ships with Canoas The th day in the Morning we entered at half Flood into the smaller branch of that River and rowed up leagues before we met any Inhabitants There we found two small Huts thatched with  Pal∣meto  Leaves The  Indians  seeing us rowing towards their Houses got their Wives and little ones with their Housholdstuff into their Canoas and paddled away faster than we could row for we were forced to keep in the middle of the River because of our Oars but they with their Paddles kept close under the Banks and so had not the strength of the stream against them as we had These Huts were close by the River on the East side of it just against the end of the Island We saw a great many other Houses a league from us on the other side of the Ri∣ver but the main stream into which we were now come seemed to be so swift that we were afraid to put over for fear we should not be abe to get back again We found only a Hog some Fowls and Plantains in the Huts We killed the Hog and the Fowls which were drest presently Their Hogs they got as I suppose from the  Spaniards  by some accident or from some Neighbouring  Indians  who converse with the  Spaniards  for this that we took was of their  European  kind which the  Spaniards  have introduced into  America  very plentifully especially into the Islands  Jamaica Hispaniola  and  Cuba  above all being very largely stored with them where they feed in the Woods in the day time and at night come in at the sounding of a  Conchshell  and are put up in their Crauls or Pens and yet some turn wild which nevertheless are often decoy∣ed in by the other which being all marked when∣ever they see an unmarked Hog in the Pen they know it is a wild one and shoot him presently  These  Crauls  I have not seen on the Continent where the  Spaniards  keep them tame at home A∣mong the wild  Indians  or in their Woods are no Hogs but Pecary and Warree a sort I have men∣tioned before  After we had refreshed our selves we returned towards the Mouth of the River It was the even∣ing when we came from thence and we got to the Rivers Mouth the next Morning before Day Our Ships when we left them were order'd to go to  Gal∣lo  where they were to stay for us  Gallo  is a small uninhabited Island lying in between two and De∣grees North Lat It lieth in a wide Bay about Leagues from the Mouth of the River  Tomaco  and Leagues and half from a small  Indian  Village called  Tomaco  The Island  Gallo  is of an indifferent heighth it is cloathed with very good TimberTrees and is therefore often visited with Barks from  Guiaquil  and other places for most of the Timber carry'd from  Guiaquil  to  Lima  is first fetch'd from  Gallo  There is a Spring of good Water at the N E end at that place there is a small fine sandy Bay where there is good landing The Road for Ships is against this Bay where there is good secure riding in or fathom Water and here Ships may careen It is but shoal Water all about this Island yet there is a Channel to come in at where there is no less than fathom Water You must go in with the Tide of Flood and come out with Ebb sounding all the way  Tomaco  is a large River that takes its Name from an  Indian  Village so called It is reported to spring from the rich Mountains about  Quito  It is thick inhabited with  Indians  and there are some  Spani∣ards  that live there who traffick with the  Indians  for Gold It is shoal at the Mouth of the River yet Barks may enter  This Village  Tomaco  is but small and is seated not far from the Mouth of the River It is a place to entertain the  Spanish  Merchants that come to  Gallo  to load Timber or to traffick with the  Indians  for Gold At this place one  Doleman  with or Men more once of Captain  Sharp's  Crew were killed in the year From the branch of the River  St Jago  where we now lay to  Tomaco  is about leagues the land low and full of Creeks so that Canoas may pass within Land through those Creeks and from thence into  Tomaco  River  The th day we left the River of  St Jago  cros∣sing some Creeks in our way with our Canoas and came to an  Indian  House where we took the  and all his Family We staid here till the Aftern  and then rowed towards  Tomaco  with the M  this House for our Guide We arrived at  Tomaco  ¦bout a clock at Night Here we took all the I  ¦habitants of the Village and a  Spanish  Knight call'd  Don Diego de Pinus  This Knight came in a Ship from  Lima  to lade Timber The Ship was riding in a Creek about a mile off and there were only one  Spaniard  and  Indians  aboard We went in a Ca∣noa with Men and took her she had no Goods but or Jars of good Wine which we took out and the next day let the Ship go Here an  Indian  Canoa came aboard with three Men in her These Men could not speak  Spanish  neither could they di∣stinguish us from  Spaniards  the wild  Indians  usual∣ly thinking all white Men to be  Spaniards  We gave them or four Callabashes of Wine which they freely drank They were straight bodies and well limb'd Men of a mean heighth their Hair black long visag'd small Noses and Eyes and were thin fac'd ill look'd Men of a very dark copper colour A little before Night Captain  Swan  and all of us re∣turned to  Tomaco  and left the Vessel to the Seamen The st day two of our Canoas who had been  up the River of  Tomaco  returned back again to the Village They had rowed or leagues up and found but one  Spanish  House which they were told did belong to a Lady who liv'd at  Lima  she had Servants here that traded with the  Indians  for Gold but they seeing our Men coming ran away yet our Men found there several Ounces of Gold in Cal∣labashes  The first day of  January  we went from  To∣maco  towards  Gallo  We carried the Knight with us and too small Canoas which we took there and while we were rowing over one of our Canoas took a PacquetBoat that was sent from  Panama  to  Lima  The  Spaniards  threw the Pacquet of Letters overboard with a Line and a Buoy to it but our Men seeing it took it up and brought the Letters and all the Prisoners aboard our Ships that were then at an anchor at  Gallo  Here we staid till the th day reading the Letters by which we understood that the Armada from  Old Spain  was come to  Porta∣bel  and that the President of  Panama  had sent this Pacquet on purpose to hasten the Plate Fleet thither from  Lima  We were very joyful of this News and therefore sent away the PacquetBoat with all her Letters and we altered our former Resolutions of going to  La∣velia  We now concluded to careen our Ships as speedily as we could that we might be ready to intercept this Fleet The properest place that we could think on for doing it was among the  Kings Islands  or  Pearl Keys  because they are near  Panama  and all Ships bound to  Panama  from the Coast of  Lima  pass by them so that being there we could not possibly miss the Fleet According to these Re∣solutions we sailed the next Morning in order to ex∣ecute what we designed We were Ships and Barks in Company  viz  Captain  Davis  Captain  Swan  a Fireship and small Barks as Tenders  one on Captain  Davis  's Ship the other on Captai  Swan  's We weighed before day and got out all bu  Captain  Swan  's Tender which never budged fo  the Men were all asleep when we went out and th  Tide of Flood coming on before they waked w  were forced to stay for them till the next day  The th day in the Morning we descried a Sai  to the West of us the Wind was at South and w  chased her and before noon took her She was a Ship of about Tun laden with Flower she cam  from  Truxillo  and was bound to  Panama  Thi  Ship came very opportunely to us for Flower be¦gan to grow scarce and Captain  Davis  his Me  grudg'd at what was given to Captain  Swan  who  as I said before had none but what he had from Captain  Davis  We jogged on after this with a gentle Gale to¦wards  Gorgonia  an Island lying about Leagues from the Island  Gallo  The th day we anchored at  Gorgonia  on the Westside of the Island in fa∣thom clean Ground not Cables length from the Shoar  Gorgonia  is an uninhabited Island in lat a∣bout degrees North It is a pretty high Island and very remarkable by reason of Saddles or risings and fallings on the top It is about Leagues long and a League broad and it is Leagues from the Main At the Westend is another small Island The Land against the Anchoringplace is low there is a small sandy Bay and good landing The Soil or Mould of it is black and deep in the low Ground but on the side of the high Land it is a kind of a red Clay This Island is very well clothed with large Trees of several sorts that are flourishing and green all the Year It is very well watred with small Brooks that Issue from the high Land Here are a great many little black Monkeys some  Indian  Conies and a few Snakes which are all the Land Animals that I know there It is reported of this  Island that it rains on every day in the Year more or less but that I can disprove However it is a very wet Coast and it rains abundantly here all the Year long There are but few fair days for there is little difference in the Seasons of the Year between the wet and dry only in that Season which should be the dry time the Rains are less frequent and more moderate than in the wet Season for then it pours as out of a Sieve It is deep Water and no anchoring any where about this Island only at the Westside The Tide riseth and falleth or foot up and down Here are a great many Perewincles and Muscles to be had at low Water Then the Monkeys come down by the Seaside and catch them digging them out of their Shells with their Claws  Here are PearlOysters in great plenty They grow to the loose Rocks in or fathom Wa∣ter by Beards or little small Roots as a Muscle These Oysters are commonly flatter and thinner than other Oysters otherwise much alike in shape The Fish is not sweet nor very wholsom it is as slimy as a ShellSnail they taste very copperish if eaten raw and are best boiled The  Indians  who gather them for the  Spaniards  hang the Meat of them on Strings like Jewsears and dry them before they eat them The Pearl is found at the head of the Oyster lying between the Meat and the Shell Some will have or small SeedPearl some none at all and some will have or pretty large ones The inside of the Shell is more glorious than the Pearl it self I did never see any in the  South Seas  but here It is reported there are some at the Southend of  Callifornia  In the  WestIndies  the  Ran∣cho Reys  or  Rancheria  spoken of in Chap is the place where they are found most plentifully 'Tis said there are some at the Island  Margarita  St  Augustin  a Town in the Gulph of  Florida  the  EastIndies  the Island  Ainam  near the Southend of  China  is said to have plenty of these Oysters more productive of large round Pearl than those in other places They are found also in other parts of the  EastIndies  and on the  Persian  Coast  At this Island  Gorgona  we rummaged our Prize and found a few Boxes of Marmalade and or Jars of Brandy which were equally shared between Capt  Davis  Capt  Swan  and their Men Here we fill'd all our Water and Capt  Swan  furnished him∣self with Flower Afterward we turned ashore a great many Prisoners but kept the chiefest to put them ashore in a better place  The th day we sailed from hence toward the  Kings Islands  We were now Sail Men of War Tenders a Fireship and the Prize We had but little Wind but what we had was the common Trade at South The Land we sailed by on the Main is very low towards the Seaside but in the Country there are very high Mountains  The th day we passed by Cape  Corrientes  This Cape is in lat d m it is high bluff Land with or small Hillocks on the top It appears at a di∣stance like an Island Here we found a strong Cur∣rent running to the N but whether it be always so I know not The day after we passed by the Cape we saw a small white Island which we chaced sup∣posing it had been a Sail till coming near we found our Error  The st day we saw Point  Garachina  This Point is in lat d m North it is pretty high Land rocky and destitute of Trees yet within Land it is woody It is fenced with Rocks against the Sea Within the Point by the Sea at low Water you may find store of Oysters and Muscles  The  Kings Islands  or  Pearl Keys  are about leagues distant from this Point Between Point  Gara∣china  and them there is a small low flat barren Island  called  Gallera  at which Captain  Harris  was sharing with his Men the Gold he took in his pillaging  Sancta Maria  which I spake of a little before when on a sudden  Spanish  Barks fitted out on purpose at  Pa∣nama  came upon him but he fought them so stoutly with one small Bark he had and some few Canoas boarding their Admiral particularly that they were all glad to leave him By this Island we anchored and sent our Boats to the  Kings Island  for a good careening place  The  Kings Islands  are a great many low Woody Islands lying N W by N and S E by S They are about leagues from the Main and leagues in length and from  Panama  about leagues Why they are called the  Kings Islands  I know not they are sometimes and mostly in Maps called the  Pearl Islands  I cannot imagine wherefore they are called so for I did never see one Pearl Oyster about them nor any Pearl Oystershells but on the other Oy∣sters I have made many a Meal there The Northermost Island of all this range is called  Pachea  or  Pa∣cheque  This is but a small Island distant from  Pa∣nama  or leagues The Southermost of them is called  St Pauls  Besides these two I know no more that are called by any particular Name tho' there are many that far exceed either of the two in big∣ness Some of these Islands are planted with Plan∣tains and Bonanas and there are Fields of Rice on others of them The Gentlemen of  Panama  to whom they belong keep Negroes there to plant Weed and Husband the Plantations Many of them especially the largest are wholly untill'd yet very good fat land full of large Trees These unplanted Islands shelter many RunawayNegroes who abscond in the Woods all day and in the night boldly pillage the Plantain Walks Betwixt these Islands and the Main is a Channel of or leagues wide there is good depth of Water and good Anchoring all the  way The Islands border thick on each other yet they make many small narrow deep Channels fit only for Boats to pass between most of them At the S E end about a league from St  Paul  's Island there is a good place for Ships to careen or hale ashore It is surrounded with the Land and hath a good deep Channel on the North side to go in at The Tide riseth here about foot perpendicular  We brought our Ships into this place the th day but were forced to tarry for a Spring Tide before we could have Water enough to clean them there∣fore we first clean'd our Barks that they might cruise before  Panama  while we lay here The th day our Barks being clean we sent them out with Men in each The th day after they returned with a Prize laden with Maiz or  Indian  Corn SaltBeef and Fowls She came from  Lavelia  and was bound to  Panama Lavelia  is a Town we once de∣signed to attempt It is pretty large and stands on the Bank of a River on the North side of the Bay of  Panama  or leagues from the Sea  Nata  is another such Town standing in a Plain near another Branch of the same River In these Towns and some others on the same Coast they breed Hogs Fowls Bulls and Cows and plant Maiz purposely for the support of  Panama  which is sup∣plied with Provision mostly from other Towns and the Neigbouring Islands  The Beef and Fowl our Men took came to us in a good time for we had eaten but little Flesh since we left the Island  Plata  The Harbour where we careen'd was incompassed by three Islands and our Ships rode in the middle That on which we haled our Ships ashore was a little Island on the North side of the Harbour There was a fine small sandy Bay but all the rest of the Island was invironed with Rocks on which at low Water we did use to gather Oy∣sters Clams Muscles and Limpits The Clam is  a sort of Oyster which grows so fast to the Rock that there is no separating it from thence therefore we did open it where it grows and take out the Meat which is very large fat and sweet Here are a few common Oysters such as we have in  Eng∣land  of which sort I have met with none in these Seas but here at Point  Garachina  at  Puna  and on the  Mexican  Coast in the lat of d North I have a Manuscript of Mr  Teat  Capt  Swan  's chief Mate which gives an account of Oysters plenti∣fully found in Port St  Julian  on the Eastside and somewhat to the North of the Streights of  Magel∣lan  but there is no mention made of what Oysters they are Here are some Guanoes but we found no other sort of LandAnimal Here are also some Pigeons and TurtleDoves The rest of the Islands that incompass this Harbour had of all these sorts of Creatures Our Men therefore did every day go over in Canoas to them to Fish Fowl or Hunt for Guanoes but having one Man surprized once by some  Spaniards  lying there in ambush and carried off by them to  Panama  we were after that more cauti∣ous of straggling  The th day of  Feb  we made an end of cleaning our Ship fill'd all our Water and stock'd our selves with Firewood The th day we went out from among the Islands and anchored in the Channel between them and the Main in fathom Water soft Oazy Ground The PlateFleet was not yet arrived therefore we intended to cruise before the City of  Panama  which is from this place about leagues The next day we sailed towards  Pana∣ma  passing in the Channel between the  Kings Islands  and the Main It is very pleasant sailing here ha∣ving the Main on one side which appears in divers forms It is beautified with many small Hills cloath'd with woods of divers sorts of Trees which are al∣ways green and flourishing There are some few  small high Islands within a league of the Main scat∣tering here and there one These are partly Woody partly bare and they as well as the Main appear very pleasant The  Kings Islands  are on the other side of this Channel and make also a lovely pros∣pect as you sail by them These as I have already noted are low and flat appearing in several Shapes according as they are naturally formed by many small Creeks and Branches of the Sea The th day we anchored at  Pacheque  in fathom Water about a leagne from the Island and sailed from thence the next day with the Wind at N N E directing our course towards  Panama  When we came abrest of  Old Panama  we anchor'd and sent our Canoa ashore with our Prisoner Don  Diego de Pinas  with a Letter to the Governour to treat about an Exchange for our Man they had spi∣rited away as I said and another Captain  Harris  left in the River of  St Maria  the year before coming over Land Don  Diego  was desirous to go on this Errand in the Name and with the Consent of the rest of our  Spanish  Prisoners but by some accident he was killed before he got ashore as we heard afterwards  Old Panama  was formerly a famous place but it was taken by Sir  Henry Morgan  about the year and at that time great part of it was burned to Ashes and it was never reedified since  New Panama  is a very fair City standing close by the Sea about Mile from the Ruines of the Old Town It gives Name to a large Bay which is fa∣mous for a great many navigable Rivers some where∣of are very rich in Gold it is also very pleasantly sprinkled with Islands that are not only profitable to their Owners but very delightful to the Pas∣sengers and Seamen that sail by them some of which I have already described It is incompassed on the backside with a pleasant Country which is full of small Hills and Valleys beautified with many  Groves and Spots of Trees that appear in the Sa∣vannahs like so many little Islands This City is all compassed with a high Stone Wall the Houses are said to be of Brick Their Roofs appear higher than the top of the City Wall It is beautified with a great many fair Churches and Religious Houses be∣sides the Presidents House and other eminent Build∣ings which altogether make one of the finest objects that I did ever see in  America  especially There are a great many Guns on her Walls most of which look toward the Land They had none at all against the Sea when I first entred those Seas with Captain  Sawkins  Captain  Coxon  Captain  Sharp  and others for till then they did not fear any Enemy by Sea but since then they have planted Guns clear round This is a flourishing City by reason it is a thorough∣fair for all imported or exported Goods and Trea∣sure to and from all Parts of  Peru  and  Chili  whereof their StoreHouses are never empty The Road also is seldom or never without Ships Besides once in years when the  Spanish  Armada comes to  Portobel  then the PlateFleet also from  Lima  comes hither with the King's Treasure and abundance of Merchant Ships full of Goods and Plate at that time the City is full of Merchants and Gentlemen the Seamen are busie in landing the Treasure and Goods and the Carriers or Caravan Masters im∣ployed in carrying it over land on Mules in vast droves every day to  Portobel  and bringing back  European  Goods from thence Tho' the City be then so full yet during this heat of Business there is no hiring of an ordinary Slave under a Piece of Eight a day Houses also Chambers Beds and Victuals are then extraordinary dear  Now I am on this Subject I think it will not be amiss to give the Reader an account of the Progress of the Armada from  Old Spain  which comes thus every three Years into the  Indies  Its first arrival is  at  Carthagena  from whence as I have been told an Express is immediately sent over Land to  Lima  thro' the Southern Continent and another by Sea to  Porto∣bel  with two Pacquets of Letters one for the Viceroy of  Lima  the other for the Viceroy of  Mexico  I know not which wa  that of  Mexico  goes after its arrival at  Portobel  whether by land or Sea But I believe  S  a to  La Vera Cruz  That for  Lima  is sent by Land to  Panama  and from thence by Sea to  Lima  Upon mention of these Pacquets I shall digress yet a little further and acquaint my Reader that before my first going over into the  South Seas  with Captain  Sharp  and indeed before any Privateers at least since  Drake  and  Oxengham  had gone that way which we afterwards went except  La Sound  a  French  Cap∣tain who by Captain  Wright  's Instructions had ven∣tured as far as  Cheapo  Town with a Body of Men but was driven back again I being then on board Capt  Coxen  in company with or more Privateers about leagues to the East of  Portobel  we took the Pacquets bound thither from  Carthagena  We open'd a great quantity of the Merchants Letters and found the Contents of many of them to be very surprizing the Merchants of several parts of  Old Spain  thereby in∣forming there Correspondents of  Panama  and else∣where of a certain Prophecy that went about  Spain  that year the Tenour of which was  That there would be  English  Privateers that Year in the  WestIn∣dies  who would make such great Discoveries as to open a Door into the  South Seas which they sup¦posed was fastest shut And the Letters were accor¦dingly full of Cautions to their Friends to be very watchful and careful of their Coasts  This Door they spake of we all concluded must b  the Passage over Land through the Country of th  Indians  of  D  who were a little before this becom  our Friends and  ad lately fallen out with the  Spani¦ards  breaking off the Intercourse which for som  time they had with them and upon calling al∣so to mind the frequent Invitations we had from those  Indians  a little before this time to pass through their Country and fall upon the  Spaniards  in the  South Seas  we from hence forward began to enter∣tain such thoughts in earnest and soon came to a Resolution to make those Attempts which we after∣wards did with Capt  Sharp Coxen c  So that the taking these Letters gave the first life to those bold Undertakings and we took the advantage of the fears the  Spaniards  were in from that Prophecy or probable Conjecture or whatever it were for we sealed up most of the Letters again and sent them ashoar to  Portobel  The occasion of this our late Friendship with those  Indians  was thus About years before this time Capt  Wright  being cruising near that Coast and go∣ing in among the  Samballoes  Isles to strike Fish and Turtle took there a young  Indian  Lad as he was pad∣dling about in a Canoa He brought him aboard his Ship and gave him the name of  John Gret  cloathing him and intending to breed him among the  English  But his  Moskito  Strikers taking a fancy to the Boy begg'd him of Capt  Wright  and took him with them at their return into their own Country where they taught him their Art and he married a Wife among them and learnt their Language as he had done some broken  English  while he was with Capt  Wright  which he improved among the  Moskitoes  who corresponding so much with us do all of them smatter  English  after a sort but his own Language he had almost forgot Thus he lived among them for many years till about or months before our ta¦king these Letters Capt  Wright  being again among the  Samballoes  took thence another  Indian  Boy about or years old the Son of a Man of some ac∣count among those  Indians  and wanting a Striker he went away to the  Moskito  's Country where he  took  John Gret  who was now very expert at it  John Gret  was much pleased to see a Lad there of his own Country and it came into his mind to persuade Capt  Wright  upon this occasion to endeavour a Friend∣ship with those  Indians  a thing our Privateers had long coveted but never durst attempt having such dreadful Apprehensions of their numbers and fierce∣ness But  John Gret  offered the Captain that he would go ashoar and negotiate the matter who ac∣cordingly sent him in his Canoa till he was near the shoar which of a sudden was covered with  Indians  standing ready with their Bows and Arrows  John Gret  who had only a Clout about his middle as the fashion of the  Indians  is leapt then out of the Boat and swam the Boat retiring a little way back and the  Indians  ashoar seeing him in that habit and hearing him call to them in their own Tongue which he had recovered by conversing with the Boy lately taken suffered him quietly to land and gathered all about to hear how it was with him He told them particularly that he was one of their Countrymen and how he had been taken many years ago by the  English  who had used him very kindly that they were mistaken in being so much afraid of that Nation who were not Enemies to them but to the  Spaniards  to confirm this he told them how well the  English  treated another young Lad of theirs they had lately taken such a ones Son for this he had learnt of the Youth and his Father was one of the Company that was got together on the shoar He persuaded them therefore to make a League with these friendly People by whose help they might be able to quell the  Spaniards  assuring also the Father of the Boy that if he would but go with him to the Ship which they saw at anchor at an Island there it was  Golden Island  the Eastermost of the  Samballoes  a place where there is good striking for Turtle he should have his Son restored to him  and they might all expect a very kind reception Upon these Assurances or of them went off presently in or Canoas laden with Plantains Bo∣nanoes Fowls  c  And Capt  Wright  having treated them on board went ashoar with them and was en∣tertained by them and presents were made on each side Captain  Wright  gave the Boy to his Father in a very handsome  English  Dress which he had caused to be made purposely for him and an Agreement was immediately struck up between the  English  and these  Indians  who invited the  English  through their Coun∣try into the  South Seas  Pursuant to this Agreement the  English  when they came upon any such Design or for Traffick with them were to give a certain Signal which they pitcht upon whereby they might be known But it hap∣pened that Mr  la Sound  the  French  Captain spoken of a little before being then one of Captain  Wright  's Men learnt this Signal and staying ashoar at  PetitGuavres  upon Captain  Wright  's going thither soon after who had his Commission from thence he gave the other  French  there such an account of the Agreement beforementioned and the easiness of entring the  South Seas  thereupon that he got at the head of about of them who made that unsuc∣cessful attempt upon  Cheapo  as I said making use of the Signal they had learnt for passing the  Indians  Country who at that time could not distinguish so well between the several Nations of the  Europeans  as they can since  From such small beginnings arose those great stirs that have been since made over the  South Seas viz  from the Letters we took and from the Friendship contracted with these  Indians  by means of  John Gret  Yet this Friendship had like to have been stifled in its Infancy for within few Months after an  English  trading Sloop came on this Coast from  Jamaica  and  John Gret  who by this time had advanced himself a  a Grandee among these  Indians  together with or more of that Quality went off to the Sloop in their long Gowns as the custom is for such to wear among them Being received aboard they expected to find every thing friendly and  John Gret  talkt to them in  English  but these  English  Men having no know∣ledge at all of what had happened endeavoured to make them Slaves as is commonly done for upon carrying them to  Jamaica  they could have sold them for or Pound a piece But  John Gret  and the rest perceiving this leapt all overboard and were by the others killed every one of them in the Water The  Indians  on shoar never came to the knowledge of it if they had it would have endangered our Cor∣respondence Several times after upon our conver∣sing with 'em they enquired of us what was become of their Countrymen but we told them we knew not as indeed it was a great while after that we heard this Story so they concluded the  Spaniards  had met with them and killed or taken them  But to return to the account of the progress of the Armada which we left at  Cartagena  After an ap∣pointed stay there of about days as I take it it goes thence to  Portobel  where it lies days and no longer Therefore the Viceroy of  Lima  on notice of the Armada's arrival at  Cartagena  immediately sends away the Kings Treasure to  Panama  where it is land∣ed and lies ready to be sent to  Portobel  upon the first news of the Armada's arrival there This is the rea∣son partly of their sending Expresses so early to  Lima  that upon the Armada's first coming to  Portobel  the Treasure and Goods may lie ready at  Panama  to be sent away upon the Mules and it requires some time for the  Lima  Fleet to unlade because the Ships ride not at  Panama  but at  Perica  which are small Islands leagues from thence The King's Treasure is said to amount commonly to about of Pieces of Eight besides abundance of Merchants  Money All this Treasure is carried on Mules and there are large Stables at both places to lodge them Sometimes the Merchants to steal the Custom pack up Money among Goods and send it to  Venta de Cruzes  on the River  Chagre  from thence down the River and afterwards by Sea to  Portobel  in which passage I have known a whole Fleet of Periago's and Canoas taken The Merchants who are not ready to sail by the th day after the Armada's arrival are in danger to be left behind for the Ships all weigh the th day precisely and go to the Harbors Mouth yet sometimes on great importunity the Admiral may stay a week longer for it is impossible that all the Merchants should get ready for want of Men When the Armada departs from  Portobel  it re∣turns again to  Cartagena  by which time all the King's Revenue which comes out of the Country is got rea∣dy there Here also meets them again a great Ship call'd the  Pattache  one of the  Spanish  Galeons which before their first arrival at  Cartagena  goes from the rest of the Armada on purpose to gather the Tribute of the Coast touching at the  Magarita  's and other places in her way thence to  Cartagena  as  Punta de Guaira Moracaybo Riode la Hacha  and  Sancta Martha  and at all these places takes in Treasure for the King Af∣ter the set stay at  Cartagena  the  Armada  goes away to the  Havana  in the Isle of  Cuba  to meet there the  Flota  which is a small number of Ships that go to  la Vera Cruz  and there takes in the effects of the City and Country of  Mexico  and what is brought thither in the Ship which comes thither every year from the  Philip∣pine  Islands and having join'd the rest at the  Havana  the whole  Armada  sets sail for  Spain  through the Gulf of  Florida  The Ships in the  South Seas  lie a great deal longer at  Panama  before they return to  Lima  The Merchants and Gentlemen which come from  Lima  stay as little time as they can at  Portobel  which is at the best but a sickly place and at this time is very full  of Men from all parts But  Panama  as it is not over∣charg'd with Men so unreasonably as the other tho' very full so it enjoys a good Air lying open to the Seawind which riseth commonly about or a Clock in the Morning and continues till or a Clock at night then the Landwind comes and blows till or in the morning  There are no Woods nor Marshes near  Panama  but a brave dry Champion Land not subject to Fogs nor Mists The wet season begins in the latter end of  May  and continues till  November  At that time the Seabreezes are at S S W and the Landwinds at N At the dry Season the Winds are most betwixt the E N E and the N Yet off in the Bay they are commonly at South but of this I shall be more particular in my Chapter of Winds in the  Appendix  The Rains are not so excessive about  Panama  it self as on either side of the Bay yet in the Months of  June July  and  August  they are severe enough Gen∣tlemen that come from  Peru  to  Panama  especially in these Months cut their Hair close to preserve them from Fevers for the place is sickly to them because they come out of a Country which never hath any Rains or Fogs but enjoys a constant Serenity but I am apt to believe this City is healthy enough to any other People Thus much for  Panama  The th day we went and anchored within a league of the Islands  Perico  which are only little barren rocky Islands in expectation of the President of  Panama  's Answer to the Letter I said we sent him by  Don Diego  treating about exchange of Prisoners this being the day on which he had given us his Pa∣role to return with an answer The st day we took another Bark laden with Hogs Fowl Salt Beef and Molossoes she came from  Lavelia  and was going to  Panama  In the afternoon we sent another Letter a∣shoar by a young  Mastiso  a mixtbreed of  Indians  and  Europeans  directed to the President and or Co∣pies  of it to be dispersed abroad among the common People This Letter which was full of Threats to∣gether with the young Man's managing the business wrought so powerfully among the common People that the City was in an uproar The President im∣mediately sent a Gentleman aboard who demanded the FlowerPrize that we took off of  Gallo  and all the Prisoners for the Ransom of our two Men but our Captains told him they would exchange Man for Man The Gentleman said he had not Orders for that but if he would stay till the next day he would bring the Governours Answer The next day he brought aboard our two Men and had about Prisoners in exchange  The th day we run over to the Island  Tabago Tabago  is in the Bay and about Leagues South of  Panama  It is about mile long and broad a high mountainous Island On the Northside it declines with a gentle descent to the Sea The Land by the Sea is of a black Mold and deep but towards the top of the Mountain it is strong and dry The North∣side of this Island makes a very pleasant shew it seems to be a Garden of Fruit inclosed with many high Trees the chiefest Fruits are Plantains and Bona∣na's They thrive very well from the foot to the middle of it but those near the top are but small as wanting moisture Close by the Sea there are many CocoNutTrees which make a very pleasant sight Within the CocoNutTrees there grow many  Mam∣met  Trees The  Mammet  is a large tall and straitbodied Tree clean without Knots or Limbs for or foot or more The Head spreads abroad into many small Limbs which grow pretty thick and close together The Bark is of a dark grey colom thick and rough full of large Chops The Fruit is bigger than Quince it is round and cover'd with a thick Rind of a grey colour When the Fruit is ripe the Rind is yellow and though and it will then peel  off like Leather but before it is ripe it is brittle the juice is then white and clammy but when ripe not so The ripe Fruit under the Rind is yellow as a Carrot and in the middle are two large rough stones flat and each of them much bigger than an Almond The Fruit smells very well and the taste is answera∣ble to the smell The S W end of the Island hath never been cleared but is full of Firewood and Trees of divers sorts There is a very fine small Brook of fresh Water that springs out of the side of the Mountain and gliding thro' the Grove of Fruittrees falls into the Sea on the Northside There was a small Town standing by the Sea with a Church at one end but now the biggest part of it is destroyed by the Privateers There is good anchoring right a∣gainst the Town about a mile from the shoar where you may have or fathom Water soft oazy ground There is a small Island close by the N W end of this called  Tabogilla  with a small Channel to pass between There is another woody Island a∣bout a mile on the N E side of  Tabago  and a good Channel between them this Island hath no Name that ever I heard  While we lay at  Tabago  we had like to have had a scurvy trick plaid us by a pretended Merchant from  Panama  who came as by stealth to traffick with us privately a thing common enough with the  Spanish  Merchants both in the  North  and  South Seas  notwith∣standing the severe Prohibitions of the Governours who yet sometimes connive at it and will even trade with the Privateers themselves Our Merchant was by agreement to bring out his Bark laden with Goods in the night and we to go and anchor at the South of  Perico  Out he came with a Fireship instead of a Bark and approached very near haling us with the Watchword we had agreed upon We suspecting the worst call'd to them to come to an anchor and upon their not doing so fir'd at them when immediately  their Men going out into the Canoas set fire to their Ship which blew up and burnt close by us so that we were forc'd to cut our Cables in all haste and scamper away as well as we could  The  Spaniard  was not altogether so politick in ap∣pointing to meet us at  Perico  for there we had Sea∣room whereas had he come thus upon us at  Tabago  the Landwind bearing hard upon us as it did we must either have been burnt by the Fireship or upon loosing our Cables have been driven ashore But I suppose they chose  Perico  rather for the Scene of their Enterprize partly because they might there best sculk among the Islands and partly because if their Exploit fail'd they could thence escape best from our Canoas to  Panama  but leagues off  During this Exploit Capt  Swan  whose Ship was less than ours and so not so much aim'd at by the  Spaniards  lay about a mile off with a Canoa at the Buoy of his Anchor as fearing some Treachery from our pretended Merchant and a little before the Bark blew up he saw a small Float on the Water and as it appear'd a Man on it making towards his Ship but the Man dived and disappear'd of a sudden as thinking probably that he was discovered  This was supposed to be one coming with some combustible Matter to have stuck about the Rudder For such a Trick Captain  Sharp  was served at  Co∣quimbo  and his Ship had like to have been burnt by it if by meer accident it had not been discover'd I was then aboard Captain  Sharp  's Ship Captain  Swan  seeing the Blaze by us cut his Cables as we did his Bark did the like so we kept under Sail all the Night being more scar'd than hurt The Bark that was on Fire drove burning towards  Taba∣go  but after the first blast she did not burn clear only made a smother for she was not well made though Capt  Bond  had the framing and manage∣ment of it  This Capt  Bond  was he of whom I made mention in my th Chapter He after his being at the Isles of Cape  Verd  stood away for the  South Seas  at the instigation of one  Richard Morton  who had been with Capt  Sharp  in the  South Seas  In his way he met with Capt  Eaton  and they two consorted a day or two At last  Morton  went aboard Capt  Eaton  and perswaded him to lose Capt  Bond  in the Night which Capt  Eaton  did  Morton  continuing aboard of Capt  Eaton  as finding his the better Ship Capt  Bond  thus losing both his Consort  Eaton  and  Mor∣ton  his Pilot and his Ship being but an ordinary Sailer he despaired of getting into the  South Seas  and had plaid such tricks among the  Caribbee Isles  as I have been told that he did not dare to appear at any of the  English  Islands Therefore he perswa∣ded his Men to go to the  Spaniards  and they con∣sented to do any thing that he should propose So he presently steered away into the  WestIndies  and the first place where he came to an Anchor was at  Portabel  He presently declared to the Governour that there were  English  Ships coming into the  South Seas  and that if they question'd it he offered to be kept a Prisoner till time should discover the truth of what he said but they believed him and sent him away to  Panama  where he was in great esteem This several Prisoners told us  The  Spaniards  of  Panama  could not have fitted out their Fireship without this Capt  Bond  's assi∣stance for it is strange to say how grosly ignorant the  Spaniards  in the  WestIndies  but especially in the  South Seas  are of Seaaffairs They build in∣deed good Ships but this is a small matter for any Ship of a good bottom will serve for these Seas on the South Coast They rig their Ships but untowardly have no Guns but in or of the King's Ships and are meanly furnished with Warlike Provisions and much at a loss for the making any Fireships or other  less usual Machines Nay they have not the sense to have their Guns run within the sides upon their dis∣charge but have Platforms without for the Men to stand on to charge them so that when we come near we can fetch them down with small shot out of our Boats A main reason of this is that the Native  Spa∣niards  are too proud to be Seamen but use the  Indians  for all those Offices One  Spaniard  it may be going in the Ship to command it and himself of little more knowledge than those poor ignorant Creatures nor can they gain much Experience seldom going far off to Sea but coasting along the Shores  But to proceed In the Morning when it was light we came again to an anchor close by our Buoys and strove to get our Anchors again but our BuoyRopes being rotten broke While we were puzling about our Anchors we saw a great many Canoas full of Men pass between  Tabago  and the other Island This put us into a new Consternation We lay still some time till we saw that they came directly towards us then we weighed and stood towards them And when we came within hale we found that they were  English  and  French  Privateers come out of the  North Seas  through the  Isthmus  of  Darien  They were Men in Canoas of them  French  the rest  English  They were commanded by Capt  Gronet  and Capt  Lequie  We presently came to an Anchor again and all the Canoas came aboard These Men told us that there were  English  Men more un∣der the command of Capt  Towneley  in the Coun∣try of  Darien  making  Canoas  as these men had been to bring them into these Seas All the  English  men that came over in this Party were immediately en∣tertain'd by Capt  Davis  and Capt  Swan  in their own Ships and the  French  men were order'd to have our FlowerPrize to carry them and Capt  Gronet  being the eldest Commander was to command them there and thus they were all disposed of to their  Hearts content Capt  Gronet  to retalliate this kind∣ness offer'd Capt  Davis  and Capt  Swan  each of them a new Commission from the Governour of  Pe∣tit Guavres  It hath been usual for many years past for the Governor of  P Cuavres  to send blank Com∣missions to Sea by many of his Captains with orders to dispose of them to whom they saw convenient Those of  Petit Guavres  by this means making them∣selves the Sanctuary and Asylum of all People of de∣sperate Fortunes and increasing their own Wealth and the Strength and Reputation of their Party thereby Capt  Davis  accepted of one having be∣fore only an old Commission which fell to him by Inheritance at the decease of Capt  Cook  who took it from Capt  Tristian  together with his Bark as is before mentioned But Capt  Swan  refused it saying He had an Order from the Duke of  York  neither to give offence to the  Spaniards  nor to re∣ceive any affront from them and that he had been injured by them at  Baldivia  where they had kill'd some of his Men and wounded several more so that he thought he had a lawful Commission of his own to right himself I never read any of these  French  Commissions while I was in these Seas nor did I then know the import of them but I have learnt since that the Tenour of them is to give a Liberty to Fish Fowl and Hunt The occasion of this is that the Island  Hispaniola  where the Garrison of  PetitGuavres  is belongs partly to the  French  and partly to the  Spaniards  and in time of Peace these Com∣missions are given as a Warrant to those of each side to protect them from the adverse Party But in ef∣fect the  French  do not restrain them to  Hispaniola  but make them a pretence for a general ravage in any part of  America  by Sea or Land  Having thus disposed of our Associates we in∣tended to sail towards the Gulf of St  Michael  to seek Capt  Townley  who by this time we thought  might be entering into these Seas Accordingly the second day of  March  we sailed from hence towards the Gulph of St  Michael  This Gulf lies near leagues from  Panama  towards the S E The way thither from  Panama  is to pass between the  Kings Islands  and the Main It is a place where many great Rivers having finished their courses are swallowed up in the Sea It is bounded on the S with Point  Garachina  which lieth in North lat d m and on the North side with Cape St  Lorenzo  Where by the way I must correct a gross error in our common Maps which giving no name at all to the South Cape which yet is the most considera∣ble and is the true Point  Garachina  do give that name to the North Cape which is of small remark only for those whose business is into the Gulf and the name  St Lorenzo  which is the true name of this Northern Point is by them wholly omitted the name of the other Point being substituted into its place The chief Rivers which run into this Gulf of  St Michael  are  Santa Maria Sambo  and  Congos  The River  Congos  which is the River I would have persuaded our Men to have gone up as their nearest way in our Journey over Land mentioned Chap comes directly out of the Country and swallows up many small Streams that fall into it from both sides and at last looseth it self on the North side of the Gulf a league within Cape  St Lorenzo  It is not very wide but deep and navigable some leagues within Land There are Sands without it but a Channel for Ships 'Tis not made use of by the  Spaniards  because of the neighbourhood of  Santa Maria  River where they have most business on ac∣count of the Mines  The River of  Sambo  seems to be a great River for there is a grear tide at its mouth but I can say nothing more of it having never been in it This River falls into the Sea on the Southside of the Gulf  near Point  Garachina  Between the Mouths of these Rivers on either side the Gulf runs in towards the Land somewhat narrower and makes or small Islands which are cloathed with great Trees green and flourishing all the year and good Channels be∣tween the Islands Beyond which further in still the shoar on each side closes so near with Points of low Mangrove Land as to make a narrow or straight scarce half a mile wide This serves as a mouth or enterance to the Innerpart of the Gulf which is a deep Bay or leagues over every way and about the Eastend thereof are the mouths of several Rivers the chief of which is that of  Santa Maria  There are many Outlets or Creeks besides this narrow place I have described but none navi∣gable beside that For this reason the  Spanish  GuardShip mention'd in Chap chose to lie between these two Points as the only Passage they could imagine we should attempt since this is the way that the Privateers have generally taken as the nearest between the  North  and  South Seas  The River of  Santa Maria  is the largest of all the Rivers of this Gulf It is navigable or leagues up for so high the tide flows Beyond that place the Ri∣ver is divided into many Branches which are only fit for Canoas The tide rises and falls in this Ri∣ver about foot  About leagues from the Rivers mouth on the Southside of it the  Spaniards  about years ago upon their first discovery of the Gold Mines here built the Town  Santa Maria  of the same name with the River This Town was taken by Captain  Coxen  Captain  Harris  and Captain  Sharp  at their entrance into these Seas it being then but newly built Since that time it is grown considerable for when Cap∣tain  Harris  the Nephew of the former took it as is said in Chap he found in it all sorts of Trades∣men with a great deal of Flower and Wine and  abundance of Iron Crows and Pickaxes These were Instruments for the Slaves to work in the Gold Mines for besides what Gold and Sand they take up together they often find greatlumps wedg'd be∣tween the Rocks as if it naturally grew there I have seen a lump as big as a Hens Egg brought by Cap∣tain  Harris  from thence who took pound there and he told me that there were lumps a great deal bigger but these they were forc'd to beat in pieces that they might divide them These lumps are not so solid but that they have crevises and pores full of Earth and Dust This Town is not far from the Mines where the  Spaniards  keep a great many Slaves to work in the dry time of the year but in the rainy Season when the Rivers do overflow they cannot work so well Yet the Mines are so nigh the Mountains that as the Rivers soon rise so they are soon down again and presently after the rain is the best searching for Gold in the Sands for the violent rains do wash down the Gold into the Ri∣vers where much of it settles to the bottom and re∣mains Then the Native  Indians  who live here∣abouts get most and of them the  Spaniards  buy more Gold than their Slaves get by working I have been told that they get the value of Shillings a day one with another The  Spaniards  withdraw most of them with their Slaves during the wet Season to  Panama  At this Town of  St Maria  Captain  Townley  was lying with his Party making Canoas when Captain  Gronet  came into the Seas for it was then abandoned by the  Spaniards  There is another small new Town at the mouth of the River called the  Scuchaderoes  It stands on the North side of the open place at the mouth of the River of  St Maria  where there is more air than at the Mines or at  Santa Maria  Town where they are in a manner stifled with heat for want of air  All about these Rivers especially near the Sea the Land is low it is deep black Earth and the Trees it produceth are extraordinary large and high Thus much concerning the Gulf of  St Michael  whi∣ther we were bound  The second day of  March  as is said before we weighed from  Perico  and the same night we anchor'd again at  Pacheque  The third day we sailed from thence steering towards the Gulf Captain  Swan  undertook to fetch off Capt  Townley  and his Men therefore he kept near the Main but the rest of the Ships stood nearer the  Kings Islands  Captain  Swan  desired this Office because he intended to send Let∣ters overland by the  Indians  to  Jamaica  which he did ordering the  Indians  to deliver his Letters to any  English  Vessel in the other Seas At a clock we were again near the place where we clean'd our Ships There we saw Ships coming out who proved to be Captain  Townley  and his Men They were coming out of the River in the night and took Barks bound for  Panama  the one was laden with Flower the other with Wine Brandy Sugar and Oyl The Prisoners that he took declared that the  Lima  Fleet was ready to sail We went and anchored among the  Kings Islands  and the next day Captain  Swan  returned out of the River of  Santa Maria  being informed by the  Indians  that Captain  Townley  was come over to the  Kings Islands  At this place Captain  Townley  put out a great deal of his Goods to make room for his Men He distributed his Wine and Brandy some to every Ship that it might be drunk out because he wanted the Jars to carry Water in The  Spaniards  in these Seas carry all their Wine Brandy and Oyl in Jars that hold or Gallons When they lade at  Pisco  a place about leagues to the Southward of  Lima  and fa∣mous for Wine they bring nothing else but Jars of Wine and they stow one tier on the top of another  so artificially that we could hardly do the like without breaking them yet they often carry in this manner or or more in a Ship and sel∣dom break one The th day we took a small Bark that came from  Guiaquil  she had nothing in her but Ballast The th day there came an  In∣dian  Canoa out of the River of  Santa Maria  and told us that there were  English  and  French  men more coming overland from the  NorthSeas  The th day we met a Bark with or  English  men in her that belonged to Captain  Knight  who had been in the  South Seas  or Months and was now on the  Mexican  Coast There he had spied this Bark but not being able to come up with her in his Ship he detach'd these or Men in a Canoa who took her but when they had done could not recover their own Ship again losing company with her in the night and therefore they came into the Bay of  Panama  intending to go overland back into the  North Seas  but that they luckily met with us for the Isthmus of  Darien  was now become a common Road for Privateers to pass between the  North  and  South Seas  at their pleasure This Bark of Captain  Knight  's had in her or Jars of Brandy she was now commanded by Mr  Henry More  but Captain  Swan  intending to promote Captain  Harris  caused Mr  More  to be turned out alledging that it was ve∣ry likely these Men were run away from their Commander Mr  More  willingly resigned her and went aboard of Captain  Swan  and became one of his Men  It was now the latter end of the dry Season here and the Water at the  Kings  or  Pearl Islands  of which there was plenty when we first came hither was now dried away Therefore we were forced to go to Point  Garachina  thinking to Water our Ships there Captain  Harris  being now Com∣mander of the new Bark was sent into the River  of  Santa Maria  to see for those Men that the  Indi∣ans  told us of whilst the rest of the Ships sailed to∣wards Point  Garachina  where we arrived the st day and anchored mile from the Point and found a strong Tide running out of the River  Sambo  The next day we run within the Point and anchored in fathom at low Water The Tide riseth here or foot the Flood sets N N E the Ebb S S W The  Indians  that inhabit in the River  Sambo  came to us in Canoas and brought Plantains and Bonanoes They could not speak nor under∣stand  Spanish  therefore I believe they have no Commerce with the  Spaniards  We found no fresh Water here neither so we went from hence to  PortoPinas  which is leagues S by W from hence  PortoPinas  lieth in lat d North It is so called because there are many Pinetrees growing there The Land is pretty high rising gently as it runs in∣to the Country This Country near the Sea is all covered with pretty high Woods the Land that bounds the Harbor is low in the middle but high and rocky on both sides At the mouth of the Har∣bor there are small high Islands or rather barren Rocks The  Spaniards  in their Pilot Books com∣mend this for a good Harbor but it lieth all open to the S W Winds which frequently blow here in the wet Season beside the Harbor within the Islands is a place of but small extent and hath a very narrow going in what depth of Water there is in the Harbor I know not  The th day we arrived at this Harbor of Pines but did not go in with our Ship find∣ing it but an ordinary place to lie at We sent in our Boats to search it and they found a stream of good Water running into the Sea but there were such great swelling Surges came into the Harbor that we could not conveniently fill our Water there  The th day we returned to Point  Garachina  again In our way we took a small Vessel laden with Cacao she came from  Guiaquil  The th day we arrived at Point  Garachina  There we found Cap∣tain  Harris  who had been in the River of  Santa Maria  but he did not meet the Men that he went for Yet we was informed again by the  Indians  that they were making Canoas in one of the branches of the River of  Santa Maria  Here we shared our Cacao lately taken  Because we could not fill our water here we de∣signed to go to  Tabago  again where we were sure to be supplied Accordingly on the th day we set sail being now Ships in company and had a small wind at S S E The first day of  April  be∣ing in the Channel between the  Kings Islands  and the Main we had much Thunder Lightning and some Rain This Evening we anchored at the Island  Pacheque  and immediately sent Canoas before us to the Island  Tabago  to take some Priso∣ners for information and we followed the next day The d day in the evening we anchored by  Pe∣rica  and the next morning went to  Tabago  where we found our Canoas They arrived there in the night and took a Canoa that came as is usual from  Panama  for Plantains There were in the Ca∣noa  Indians  and a  Mulata  The  Mulata  because he said he was in the Fireship that came to burn us in the night was immediately hanged These Pri∣soners confirmed that one Capt  Bond  an  English  Man did command her  Here we filled our Water and cut Firewood and from hence we sent Canoas over to the Main with one of the  Indians  lately taken to guide them to a Sugarwork for now we had Cacao we wanted Sugar to make Chocolate But the chief∣est of their business was to get Coppers for each Ship having now so many Men our Pots would  not boil Victuals fast enough though we kept them boiling all the day About or days after they returned aboard with Coppers  While we lay here Captain  Davis  his Bark went to the Island  Otoque  This is another inhabited Island in the Bay of  Panama  not so big as  Tabago  yet there are good Plantainwalks on it and some Negroes to look after them These Negroes rear Fowls and Hogs for their Masters who live at  Pana∣ma  as at the  Kings Islands  It was for some Fowls or Hogs that our Men went thither but by acci∣dent they met also with an Express that was sent to  Panama  with an account that the  Lima  Fleet was at Sea Most of the Letters were thrown over∣board and lost yet we found some that said posi∣tively that the Fleet was coming with all the strength that they could make in the Kingdom of  Peru  yet were ordered not to fight us except they were forc'd to it though afterwards they chose to fight us having first landed their Treasure at  Lavelia  and that the Pilots of  Lima  had been in consultation what course to steer to miss us  For the satisfaction of those who may be curious to know I have here inserted the Resolutions taken by the Committee of Pilots as one of our compa∣ny translated them out of the  Spanish  of two of the Letters we took The first Letter as follows  SIR  HAving been with his Excellency and heard the Letter of Captain  Michael Sanches de Tena  read wherein he says there should be a meeting of the Pilots of  Panama  in the said City they say 'tis not time putting for objection the  Gallapagoes  to which I answered That it was fear of the Enemy and that they might well go that way I told this to his Excellency who was pleased to command me to write the Course which is as follows  The day for sailing being come go forth to the West South West from that to the West till you are forty leagues off at Sea then keep at the same distance to the N W till you come under the Line from whence the Pilot must shape his Course for  Moro de Porco  and for the Coast of  Lavelia  and  Natta  where you may speak with the People and according to the In∣formation they give you may keep the same Course for  Otoque  from thence to  Tabago  and so to  Panama  This is what offers as to the Course  The Letter is obscure But the Reader must make what he can of it The Directions in the other Letter were to this effect  THE surest Course to be observed going forth from  Malabrigo  is thus You must sail W by S that you may avoid the sight of the Islands of  Lobos  and if you should chance to see them by reason of the Breezes and should fall to Leward of the Lat of  Malabrigo  keep on a Wind as near as you can and if necessary go about and stand in for the shoar then tack and stand off and be sure keep your Latitude and when you are leagues to the Westward of the Island  Lobos  keep that distance till you come under the Line and then if the general Wind follows you farther you must sail N N E till you come into degrees North And if in this Lat you should find the breezes make it your business to keep the Coast and so sail for  Panama  If in your course you should come in sight of the Land before you are abrest of Cape  St Francisco  be sure to stretch off again out of sight of Land that you may not be discovered by the Enemy  The last Letter supposes the Fleet's setting out from  Malabrigo  in about deg South Lat as the other doth its going immediately from  Lima  deg further South and from hence is that Caution given of avoiding  Lobos  as near  Malabrigo  in their  usual way to  Panama  ahd hardly to be kept out of sight as the Winds are thereabouts yet to be avoid∣ed by the  Spanish  Fleet at this time because as they had twice before heard of the Privateers lying at  Lobos de la Mar  they knew not but at that time we might be there in expectation of them  The th day we sailed from  Tabago  towards the  Kings Island  again because our Pilots told us that the King's Ships did always come this way The th day we anchored at the place where we ca∣reen'd Here we found Captain  Harris  who had gone a second time into the River of  Santa Maria  and fetched the body of Men that last came over Land as the  Indians  had informed us but they fell short of the number they told us of The th day we sent Men in Canoas to the River  Cheapo  to take the Town of  Cheapo  The st day all our Ships but Captain  Harris  who staid to clean his Ships followed after The d day we arriv'd at the Island  Chepelio  Chepelio  is the pleasantest Island in the Bay of  Pa∣nama  It is but Leagues from the City of  Panama  and a League from the Main This Island is about mile long and almost so broad it is low on the Northside and riseth by a small ascent towards the Southside The Soil is yellow a kind of Clay The high side is stony the low Land is planted with all sorts of delicate Fruits  viz  Sapadilloes Avogatopears Mammees MammeeSappota's Starapples  c  The middle of the Island is plan∣ted with PlantainTrees which are not very large but the Fruit extraordinary sweet  The Sapadillotree is as big as a large Peartree the Fruit much like to a Bergomapear both in co∣lour shape and size but on some Trees the Fruit is a little longer When it is green or first gathered the Juice is white and clammy and it will stick like glew then the Fruit is hard but after it hath been  gathered or days it grows soft and juicy and then the Juice is clear as SpringWater and very sweet in the midst of the Fruit are or black Stones or Seeds about the bigness of a Pumkin∣seed This is an excellent Fruit  The  Avogato  Peartree is as big as most Peartrees and is commonly pretty high the Skin or Bark black and pretty smooth the Leaves large of an oval shape and the Fruit as big as a large Limon It is of a green colour till it is ripe and then it is a little yellowish They are seldom fit to eat till they have been gathered or days then they become soft and the Skin or Rind will peel off The substance in the inside is green or a little yel∣lowish and as soft as Butter Within the substance there is a Stone as big as a HorsePlumb This Fruit hath no taste of it self and therefore 'tis usu∣ally mixt with Sugar and Limejuice and beaten together in a Plate and this is an excellent Dish The ordinary way is to eat it with a little Salt and a roasted Plantain and thus a Man that's hungry may make a good Meal of it It is very whol∣some eaten any way It is reported that this Fruit provokes to Lust and therefore is said to be much esteemed by the  Spaniards  and I do believe they are much esteemed by them for I have met with plenty of them in many places in the NorthSeas where the  Spaniards  are settled as in the Bay of  Campeachy  on the Coast of  Cartagena  and the Coast of  Caraccos  and there are some in  Jamaica  which were planted by the  Spaniards  when they pos∣sessed that Island  The  MammeeSappotaTree  is different from the Mammee described at the Island  Tabago  in this Chapter It is not so big or so tall neither is the Fruit so big or so round The Rind of the Fruit is thin and brittle the inside is a deep red and it has a rough flat long Stone This is accounted the prin∣cipal  Fruit of the  WestIndies  It is very pleasant and wholesome I have not seen any of these on  Jamai∣ca  but in many places in the  WestIndies  among the  Spaniards  There is another sort of Mammeetree which is called the wild Mammee This bears a Fruit which is of no value but the Tree is straight tall and very tough and therefore principally used for making Masts  The StarAppletree grows much like the QuinceTree but much bigger It is full of Leaves and the Leaf is broad of an oval shape and of a very dark green colour The Fruit is as big as a large Apple which is commonly so cover'd with Leaves that a Man can hardly see it They say this is a good Fruit I did never taste any but have seen both of the Trees and Fruit in many place on the Main on the Northside of the Continent and in  Jamaica  When the  Spaniards  possess'd that Island they planted this and other sorts of Fruit as the Sapadillo AvogatoPear and the like and of these Fruits there is still in  Jamaica  in those Plan∣tations that were first settled by the  Spaniards  as at the  Angels  at  Mile Walk  and  Mile Walk  There I have seen these Trees which were planted by the  Spaniards  but I did never see any Improvement made by the  English  who seem in that little cu∣rious The Road for Ships is on the Northside where there is good anchoring half a mile from the shoar There is a Well close by the Sea on the North side and formerly there were or Houses close by it but now they are destroyed This Island stands right against the mouth of the River  Cheapo  The River  Cheapo  springs out of the Mountains near the North side of the Country and it being penn'd up on the South side by other Mountains bends its course to the Westward between both till finding a passage on the S W it makes a kind of a half circle and being swell'd to a considera∣ble  bigness it runs with a slow motion into the Sea leagues from  Panama  This River is very deep and about a quarter of a mile broad but the mouth of it is choak'd up with Sands so that no Ships can enter but Barks may There is a small  Spanish  Town of the same name within Leagues of the Sea it stands on the left hand going from the Sea This is it which I said Captain  La Sound  attempted The Land about it is champion with many small Hills cloathed with Woods but the biggest part of the Country is Savannah On the Southside of the River it is all Woodland for many leagues together It was to this Town that our Men were sent The th day they returned out of the River ha∣ving taken the Town without any opposition but they found nothing in it By the way going thi∣ther they took a Canoa but most of the Men escaped ashoar upon one of the  Kings Islands  She was sent out well appointed with armed Men to watch our motion The th day Captain  Harris  came to us having cleaned his Ship The th day we went again towards  Tabago  our Fleet now upon Captain  Harris  joining us again consisted of Sail We arrived at  Tabago  the th day there our Prisoners were examin'd concerning the strength of  Panama  for now we thought our selves strong enough for such an Enterprize being near Men Out of these on occasion we could have landed but our Prisoners gave us small Encon∣ragement to it for they assured us that all the strength of the Country was there and that many Men were come from  Portobel  besides its own In∣habitants who of themselves were more in number than we These reasons together with the strength of the place which hath a high Wall deterr'd us from attempting it While we lay here at  Tabago  some of our Men burnt the Town on the Island  The th of  May  we sailed hence again bound for the  Kings Islands  and there we continued cruising from one end of these Islands to the other till on the d day Capt  Davis  and Capt  Gronet  went to  Pacheque  leaving the rest of the Fleet at anchor at St  Paul's Island  From  Pacheque  we sent Canoas to the Island  Chepelio  in hopes to get a Prisoner there The th day our Canoas return'd from  Che∣pelio  with three Prisoners which they took there They were Seamen belonging to  Panama  who said that Provision was so scarce and dear there that the poor were almost starved being hindred by us from those common and daily supplies of Plantains which they did formerly enjoy from the Islands especially from those two of  Chepelia  and  Tabago  That the President of  Panama  had strictly ordered that none should adventure to any of the Islands for Plantains but necessity had obliged them to trespass against the President's Order They far∣ther reported that the Fleet from  Lima  was ex∣pected every day for it was generally talked that they were come from  Lima  and that the report at  Panama  was that King  Charles  II of  England  was dead and that the Duke of  York  was crowned King The th day Capt  Swan  and Capt  Townley  al∣so came to  Pacheque  where we lay but Captain  Swan  's Bark was gone in among the  Kings Islands  for Plantains The Island  Pacheque  as I have before related is the Northermost of the  Kings Islands  It is a small low Island about a League round On the Southside of it there are or small Islands nei∣ther of them half a mile round Between  Pacheque  and these Islands is a small Channel not above or paces wide and about a Mile long Through this Captain  Townley  made a bold run being prest hard by the  Spaniards  in the fight I am going to speak of though he was ignorant whether there was a sufficient depth of Water or not On the Eastside  of this Channel all our Fleet lay waiting for the  Lima  Fleet which we were in hopes would come this way  The th day we had a very wet morning for the Rains were come in as they do usually in  May  or  June  sooner or later so that  May  is here a very uncertain month Hitherto till within a few days we had good fair weather and the Wind at N N E but now the weather was altered and the Wind at S S W  However about eleven a Clock it cleared up and we saw the  Spanish  Fleet about leagues W N W from the Island  Pacheque  standing close on a Wind to the Eastward but they could not fetch the Island by a league We were riding a league S E from the Island between it and the Main only Captain  Gronet  was about a mile to the Northward of us near the Island he weighed so soon as they came in sight and stood over for the Main and we lay still expecting when he would tack and come to us but he took care to keep himself out of harms way  Captain  Swan  and  Townley  came aboard of Cap∣tain  Davis  to order how to engage the Enemy who we saw came purposely to fight us they being in all Sail besides Periagoes rowing with and Oars apiece Six Sail of them were Ships of good force first the Admiral Guns Men the ViceAdmiral Guns Men the RearAdmiral Guns Men a Ship of Guns Men one of Guns Men and one of eight Guns Men great Fireships Ships only with small Arms having Men on board them all besides or hundred Men in Periagoes This Account of their Strength we had afterwards from Captain  Knight  who being to the Windward on the Coast of  Pern  took Prisoners of whom he had this Information being what they brought  from  Lima  Besides these Men they had also som  hundreds of  Old Spain  Men that came from  Portobe  and met them at  Lavelia  from whence they now came and their Strength of Men from  Lima  wa  Men being all the strength they could mak  in that Kingdom and for greater Security they had first landed their Treasure at  Lavelia  Our Fleet consisted of Sail first Captain  Da¦vis  Guns Men most  English  Captain  Swan  Guns Men all  English  These were the only Ships of force that we had the rest having none but small Arms Captain  Townley  had Men all  English  Captain  Gronet  Men all  French  Captain  Harris  Men most  English  Captain  Branly  Men some  English  some  French Davis  his Tender Men  Swan  's Tender Men  Townley  's Bark Men and a small Bark of thirty Tuns made a Fireship with a Canoas Crew in her We had in all Men But Captain  Gronet  came not to us till all was over yet we were not dis∣couraged at it but resolved to fight them for be∣ing to Windward of the Enemy we had it at our choice whether we would fight or not It was a Clock in the afternoon when we weighed and being all under sail we bore down right afore the wind on our Enemies who kept close on a Wind to come to us but night came on without any thing beside the exchanging of a few shot on each side When it grew dark the  Spanish  Admiral put out a light as a signal for his Fleet to come to an Anchor We saw the light in the Admirals top which continued about half an hour and then it was taken down In a short time after we saw the light again and being to Windward we kept under sail supposing the light had been in the Ad∣mirals top but as it proved this was only a stra∣tagem of theirs for this light was put out the se∣cond time at one of their Barks Topmasthead and  then she was sent to Leeward which deceived us for we thought still the Light was in the Admiral's Top and by that means thought our selves to wind∣ward of them  In the Morning therefore contrary to our ex∣pectation we found they had got the Weathergage of us and were coming upon us with full Sail so we ran for it and after a running Fight all day and ha∣ving taken a turn almost round the Bay of  Panama  we came to an Anchor again at the Isle of  Pacheque  in the very same place from whence we set out in the Morning  Thus ended this days Work and with it all that we had been projecting for or Months when instead of making our selves Masters of the  Spanish  Fleet and Treasure we were glad to escape them and owed that too in a great measure to their want of Courage to pursue their Advantage  The th day in the Morning when we looked out we saw the  Spanish  Fleet all together leagues to Leeward of us at an Anchor It was but little Wind till a Clock and then sprung up a small Breeze at South and the  Spanish  Fleet went away to  Panama  What loss they had I know not we lost but one Man And having held a Consult we re∣solved to go to the Keys of  Quibo  or  Cohaya  to seek Capt  Harris  who was forc'd away from us in the Fight that being the place appointed for our Ren∣dezvous upon any such Accident As for  Gronet  he said his Men would not suffer him to joyn us in the Fight But we were not satisfied with that ex∣cuse so we suffered him to go with us to the Isles of  Quiboa  and there cashiered our cowardly Com∣panion Some were for taking from him the Ship which we had given him But at length he was suffered to keep it with his Men and we sent them away in it to some other place  CHAP VIII  They set out from  Tabago  Isle of  Churche  The Mountain called  Moro de Porcos  The Coast to the Westward of the Bay of  Panama  Isles of  Quibo Quicaro Rancheria  The  PalmaMariatree  The Isles  Canales  and  Cantarras  They build Canoas for a new Expedition and take  Puebla Nova  Captain  Knight  joyns them Canoas how made The Coast and Winds between  Quibo  and  Nicoya Volcan Vejo  again Tornadoes

Contin∣ent  Guatulco  Port The  Buffadore  or Water∣spout Ruins of  Guatulco  Village The Coast ad∣joining Capt  Townley  marches to the River  Capalita  Turtle at  Guatulco  An Indian Set∣tlement The  Vinello  Plant and Fruit  ACcording to the Resolutions we had taken we set out  June  the first passing be∣tween  Point  Garachina  and the  Kings Islands  The Wind was ot S S W rainy Weather with Torna∣does of Thunder and Lightning The d day we passed by the Island  Chuche  the last remainder of the Isles in the Bay of  Panama  This is a small low round woody Island uninhabited lying leagues S S W from  Pacheca  In our passage to  Quibo  Captain  Branly  lost his MainMast therefore he and all his Men left his Bark and came aboard Captain  Davis  his Ship Captain  Swan  also sprung his MaintopMast and got up another but while he was doing it and we were making the best of our way we lost sight of him and were now on the North side of the Bay for this way all Ships must pass from  Panama  whether bound towards the Coast of  Mexico  or  Peru  The th day we passed by  Moro de Porcos  or the  Mountain of Hogs  Why so called I know not It is a high round Hill on the Coast of  Lavelia  This side of the Bay of  Panama  runs out Westerly to the Islands of  Quibo  there are on this Coast ma∣ny Rivers and Creeks but none so large as those on the South side of the Bay It is a Coast that is partly mountainous partly low Land and very thick of Woods bordering on the Sea but a few leagues within Land it consists mostly of Savannahs which are stock'd with Bulls and Cows The Ri∣vers on this side are not wholly destitute of Gold though not so rich as the Rivers on the other side of the Bay The Coast is but thinly inhabited for except the Rivers that lead up to the Towns of  Nata  and  Lavelia  I know of no other Settlement between  Panama  and  Puebla Nova  The  Spaniards  may travel by Land from  Panama  through all the Kingdom of  Mexico  as being full of Savannahs but towards the Coast of  Peru  they cannot pass fur∣ther than the River  Cheapo  the Land there being so full of thick Woods and watered with so many  great Rivers besides less Rivers and Creeks that the  Indians  themselves who inhabit there cannot travel far without much trouble  We met with very wet weather in our Voyage to  Quibo  and with S S W and sometimes S W Winds which retarded our Course It was the th day of  June  when we arrived at  Quibo  and found there Captain  Harris  whom we sought The Island  Quibo  or  Cobaya  is in lat d m North of the Equator It is about or leagues long and or broad The land is low except only near the N E end It is all over plentifully stored with great tall flourishing Trees of many sorts and there is good Water on the East and NorthEast sides of the Island Here are some Deer and plenty of pretty large black Monkies whose Flesh is sweet and wholesome besides a few Guanoes and some Snakes I know no other sort of Land Animal on the Island There is a shole runs out from the S E point of the Island half a mile into the Sea and a league to the North of this shole point on the East side there is a rock about a mile from the shore which at the last quarter ebb appears above Water Besides these two places there is no dan∣ger on this side but Ships may run within a quar∣ter of a mile of the shoar and Anchor in or fathom good clean Sand and Oaze  There are many other Islands lying some on the S W side others on the N and N E sides of this Island as the Island  Quicaro  which is a pretty large Island S W of  Quibo  and on the North of it is a small Island called the  Rancheria  on which Island are plenty of  PalmaMaria  Trees The  PalmaMaria  is a tall straight bodied Tree with a small Head but very unlike the Palmtree notwith∣standing the Name It is greatly esteemed for ma∣king Masts being very tongh as well as of a good length for the grain of the Wood runs not straight  along it but twisting gardually about it These Trees grow in many places of the  WestIndies  and are fre∣quently used both by the  English  and  Spaniards  there for that use The Islands  Canales  and  Cantarras  are small Islands lying on the N E of  Rancheria  These have all Channels to pass between and good An∣choring about them and they are as well stored with Trees and Water as  Quibo  Sailing without them all they appear to be part of the Main The Island  Quibo  is the largest and most noted for al∣though the rest have Names yet they are seldom used only for distinction sake these and the rest of this knot passing all under the common name of the  Keys of Quibo  Captain  Swan  gave to several of these Islands the Names of those  English  Mer∣chants and Gentlemen who were Owners of his Ship  June  th Captain  Swan  came to an Anchor by us and then our Captains consulted about new methods to advance their Fortunes and because they were now out of hopes to get any thing at Sea they resolved to try what the Land would afford They demanded of our Pilots what Towns on the Coast of  Mexico  they could carry us to The City of  Leon  being the chiefest in the Country any thing near us though a pretty way within Land was pitch'd on But now we wanted Canoas to Land our Men and we had no other way but to cut down Trees and make as many as we had oc∣casion for these Islands affording plenty of large Trees fit for our purpose While this was doing we sent Men to take  Puebla Nova  a Town upon the Main near the innermost of these Islands to get Provision It was in going to take this Town that Captain  Sawkins  was killed in the year who was succeded by  Sharp  Our Men took the Town with much ease although there was more strength of Men than when Captain  Sawkins  was kill'd They returned again the th day but got  no Provision there They took an empty Bark in their way and brought her to us  The th day of  July  Captain  Knight  mentioned in my last Chapter came to us He had been crui∣sing a great way to the Westward but got nothing beside a good Ship At last he went to the South∣ward as high as the Bay of  Guiaquil  where he took a Barklog or pair of Barklogs as we call it laden chiefly with Flower She had other goods as Wine Oyl Brandy Sugar Soap and Leather of Goatskins and he took out as much of each as he had occasion for and then turned her away again The Master of the Float told him that the Kings Ships were gone from  Lima  towards  Panama  that they carried but half the Kings Treasure with them for fear of us although they had all the strength that the Kingdom could afford that all the Merchants Ships which should have gone with them were laden and lying at  Payta  where they were to wait for further Orders Captain  Knight  having but few Men did not dare to go to  Payta  where if he had been better provided he might have taken them all but he made the best of his way into the Bay of  Panama  in hopes to find us there inriched with the Spoils of the  Lima  Fleet but coming to the  Kings Islands  he had advice by a Prisoner that we had ingaged with their Fleet but were worsted and since that made our way to the Westward and therefore he came hither to seek us He presently consorted with us and set his Men to work to make Canoas Every Ships company made for themselves but we all helped each other to launch them for some were made a mile from the Sea  The manner of making a Canoa is after cutting down a large long Tree and squaring the upper∣most side and then turning it upon the flat side to shape the opposite side for the bottom Then again  they turn her and dig the inside boring also three holes in the bottom one before one in the middle and one abast thereby to gage the thickest of the bottom for otherwise we might cut the bottom thinner than is convenient We left the bottoms commonly about Inches thick and the sides Inches thick below and one and an half at the top One or both of the ends we sharpen to a point  Capt  Davis  made two very large Canoas one was foot long and or feet wide the other foot long and near as wide as the other In a Months time we finished our Business and were rea∣dy to sail Here Capt  Harris  went to lay his Ship aground to clean her but she being old and rotten fell in pieces And therefore he and all his Men went aboard of Capt  Davis  and Capt  Swan  While we lay here we struck Turtle every day for they were now very plentiful But from  August  to  March  here are not many The th day of  July John Rose  a  Frenchman  and Men more belonging to Capt  Gronet  having made a new Canoa came in her to Capt  Davis  and desired to serve under him and Capt  Davis  accepted of them because they had a Canoa of their own  The th day of  July  we sailed from  Quibo  bend∣ing our course for  Ria Lexa  which is the Port for  Leon  the City that we now designed to attempt We were now Men in Sail of Ships com∣manded by Capt  Davis  Capt  Swan  Capt  Town∣ley  and Capt  Knight  with a Fireship and three Tenders which last had not a constant Crew We past out between the River  Quibo  and the  Rancheria  leaving  Quibo  and  Quicaro  on our Larboard side and the  Rancheria  with the rest of the Islands and the Main on our Starboard side The Wind at first was at South South West We coasted along shore passing by the Gulf of  Nicoya  the Gulf of  Dulce  and by the Island  Caneo  All this Coast is low Land  overgrown with thick Woods and there are but few inhabitants near the shore As we sailed to the West∣ward we had variable Winds sometimes S W and at W S W and sometimes at E N E but we had them most commonly at S W we had a Tornado or two every day and in the Evening or in the Night we had Landwinds at N N E  The th day of  August  being in the lat of d m by my observation we saw a high Hill in the Country towring up like a SugarLoaf which bore N E by N We supposed it to be  Volcan Vejo  by the smoak which ascended from its top therefore we steered in North and made it plainer and then knew it to be that  Volcan  which is the Seamark for the Harbour for  Ria Lexa  for as I said before in Chap∣ter the th it is a very remarkable Mountain When we had brought this Mountain to bear N E we got out all our Canoas and provided to embark into them the next day  The th day in the Morning being about leagues from the shoar we left our Ships under the charge of a few Men and of us went away in Canoas towing towards the Harbour of  Ria Lexa  We had fair Weather and little Wind till a Clock in the Afternoon then we had a Tornado from the shore with much Thunder Lightning and Rain and such a gust of Wind that we were all like to be foundred In this extremity we put right afore the Wind every Canoas crew making what shift they could to avoid the Threatning Dan∣ger The small Canoas being most light and buoyant mounted nimbly over the Surges but the great heavy Canoas lay like Logs in the Sea ready to be swallowed by every foaming Billow Some of our Canoas were half full of Water yet kept two Men constantly heaving it out The fierceness of the Wind continued about half an hour and a∣bated by degrees and as the Wind died away so  the fury of the Sea abated For in all hot Countries as I have observed the Sea is soon raised by the Wind and as soon down again when the Wind is gone and therefore it is a Proverb among the Sea∣men  Up Wind up Sea Down Wind down Sea  At a clock in the Evening it was quiet calm and the Sea as smooth as a Millpond Then we tugg'd to get into the Shore but finding we could not do it before Day we rowed off again to keep our selves out of sight By that time it was day we were Leagues from the Land which we thought was far enough off Shore Here we intended to lie till the Evening but at a clock in the Afternoon we had another Tornado more fierce than that which we had the day before This put us in greater peril of our Lives but did not last so long As soon as the violence of the Tornado was over we rowed in for the shore and entred the Harbor in the Night The Creek which leads towards  Leon  lieth on the S E side of the Harbour Our Pilot being very well acquainted here carried us into the Mouth of it but could carry us no farther till day be∣cause it is but a small Creek and there are other Creeks like it The next Morning assoon as it was light we rowed into the Creek which is very nar∣row the Land on both sides lying so low that every Tide it is overflown with the Sea This sort of Land produceth red MangroveTrees which are here so plentiful and thick that there is no passing thro' them Beyond these Mangroves on the firm Land close by the side of the River the  Spaniards  have built a Brestwork purposely to hinder an Enemy from the landing When we came in sight of the Brestwork we rowed as fast as we could to get ashore The noise of our Oars allarmed the  Indians  who were set to watch and presently they ran a∣way towards the City of  Leon  to give notice of our approach We landed as soon as we could and  marched after them Men were drawn out to march to the Town and I was left with Men more to stay and guard the Canoas till their return  The City of  Leon  is Mile up in the Country The way to it plain and even thro' a Champion Country of long grassy Savannahs and spots of high Woods About Mile from the Landingplace there is a Sugarwork Mile farther there is ano∣ther and Mile beyond that there is a fine River to ford which is not very deep besides which there is no Water in all the way till you come to an  Indian  Town which is Mile before you come to the City and from thence it is a pleasant straight sandy way to  Leon  This City stands in a Plain not far from a high pecked Mountain which oftentimes casts forth fire and smoak from its top It may be seen at Sea and it is called the  Volcan  of  Leon  The Houses of  Leon  are not high built but strong and large with Gardens about them The Walls are Stone and the Covering of Pantile There are Churches and a Cathedral which is the head Church in these parts Our Countryman Mr  Gage  who travelled in these Parts recommends it to the World as the pleasantest place in all  America  and calls it the Paradice of the  Indies  Indeed if we consider the Advantage of its Scituation we may find it surpassing most places for Health and Pleasure in  America  for the Country about it is of a sandy Soil which soon drinks up all the Rain that falls to which these parts are much subject It is en∣compassed with Savannahs so that they have the benefit of the Breezes coming from any Quarter all which makes it a very healthy place It is a place of no great trade and therefore not rich in Money Their Wealth lies in their Pastures and Cattle and Plantations of Sugar It is said that they make Cordage here of Hemp but if they have any such Manufactory it is at some distance  from the Town for here is no sign of any such thing  Thither our Men were now marching they went from the Canoas about a clock Captain  Townley  with of the briskest Men marched be∣fore Captain  Swan  with Men marched next and Captain  Davis  with Men marched next and Captain  Knight  brought up the Rear Captain  Townley  who was near mile a head of the rest met about Horsemen mile before he came to the City but they never stood him About a clock Captain  Townley  only with his Men en∣tred the Town and was briskly charged in a broad Street with or  Spanish  Horsemen but or of their Leaders being knock'd down the rest fled Their Foot consisted of about Men which were drawn up in the Parade for the  Spaniards  in these parts make a large Square in every Town tho' the Town it self be small The Square is cal∣led the Parade commonly the Church makes one side of it and the Gentlemens Houses with their Galleries about them the other But the Foot al∣so seeing their Horse retire left an empty City to Captain  Townley  beginning to save themselves by flight Captain  Swan  came in about a clock Captain  Davis  with his Men about and Captain  Knight  with as many Men as he could encourage to march came in about but he left many Men tired on the Road these as is usual came drop∣ping in one or two at a time as they were able The next morning the  Spaniards  kill'd one of our tired Men he was a stout old Greyheaded Man aged about who had served under  Oliver  in the time of the  Irish  Rebellion after which he was at  Jamaica  and had followed Privateering ever since He would not accept of the offer our Men made him to tarry ashoar but said he would venture as far as the best of them and when sur∣rounded  by the  Spaniards  he refused to take Quarter but discharged his Gun amongst them keeping a Pistol still charged so they shot him dead at a di∣stance His name was  Swan  he was a very mer∣ry hearty old Man and always used to declare he would never take Quarter But they took Mr  Smith  who was tired also he was a Merchant belonging to Captain  Swan  and being carried before the Governour of  Leon  was known by a  Mulatta  Wo∣man that waited on him Mr  Smith  had lived ma∣ny years in the  Canaries  and could speak and write very good  Spanish  and it was there this  Mulatta  Woman remembred him He being examin'd how many Men we were said at the City and at the Canoas which made well for us at the Canoas who straggling about every day might ea∣sily have been destroyed But this so daunted the Governour that he did never offer to molest our Men although he had with him above Men as Mr  Smith  guessed He sent in a Flag of Truce about Noon pretending to ransom the Town ra∣ther than let it be burnt but our Captains de∣manded Pieces of Eight for its Ransom and as much Provision as would victual Men Months and Mr  Smith  to be ransomed for some of their Prisoners but the  Spaniards  did not intend to ransom the Town but only capitulated day af∣ter day to prolong time till they had got more Men Our Captains therefore considering the di∣stance that they were from the Canoas resolved to be marching down The th day in the morning they ordered the City to be set on fire which was presently done and then they came away But they took more time in coming down than in go∣ing up The th day in the morning the  Spaniards  sent in Mr  Smith  and had a Gentlewoman in ex∣change Then our Captains sent a Letter to the Governour to acquaint him that they intended  next to visit  Ria Lexa  and desir'd to meet him there they also released a Gentleman on his promise of paying Beefs for his Ransom and to deliver them to us at  Ria Lexa  and the same day our Men came to their Canoas where having staid all night the next Morning we all entred our Canoas and came to the Harbour of  Ria Lexa  and in the after∣noon our Ships came thither to an Anchor  The Creek that leads to  Ria Lexa  lieth from the N W part of the Harbour and it runs in Norther∣ly It is about Leagues from the Island in the Harbours Mouth to the Town two thirds of the way it is broad then you enter a narrow deep Creek bordered on both sides with Red Mangrove Trees whose Limbs reach almost from one side to the other A mile from the Mouth of the Creek it turns away West There the  Spaniards  have made a very strong Brestwork fronting towards the mouth of the Creek in which were placed Soldiers to hinder us from landing and Yards below that Brestwork there was a Chain of great Trees placed cross the Creek so that Men could have kept off or  When we came in sight of the Brestwork we fired but two Guns and they all run away And we were afterwards near half an hour cutting the Boom or Chain Here we landed and marched to the Town of  Ria Lexa  or  Rea Lejo  which is a∣bout a mile from hence This Town stands on a Plain by a small River It is a pretty large Town with Churches and an Hospital that hath a fine Garden belonging to it besides many large fair Houses they all stand at a good distance one from another with Yards about them This is a very sickly place and I believe hath need enough of an Hospital for it is seated so nigh the Creeks and Swamps that it is never free from a noisom smell The Land about it is a strong yellow Clay yet  where the Town stands it seems to be Sand Here are several sort of Fruits as Guavo's Pineapples Melons and PricklePears The Pineapple and Melon are well known  The GuavaFruit grows on a hard scrubbed Shrub whose Bark is smooth and whitish the Branches pretty long and small the Leaf somewhat like the Leaf of Hazel the Fruit much like a Pear with a thin rind it is full of small hard Seeds and it may be eaten while it is green which is a thing very rare in the  Indies  For most Fruit both in the  East  or  WestIndies  is full of clammy white unsa∣vory Juice before it is ripe though pleasant enough afterwards When this Fruit is ripe it is yellow soft and very pleasant It bakes as well as a Pear and it may be coddled and it makes good Pies There are of divers sorts different in shape taste and Colour The inside of some is yellow of others red When this Fruit is eaten green it is binding when ripe it is loosening  The PricklePear Bush or Shrub of about or foot high grows in many places of the  WestIndies  as at  Jamaica  and most other Islands there and on the Main in several places This prickly Shrub delights most in barren sandy Grounds and they thrive best in places that are near the Sea especially where the Sand is saltish The Tree or Shrub is or foot high spreading forth several branches and on each branch or leaves These leaves if I may call them so are round as broad every way as the Palm of a Man's hand and as thick their substance like Houseleek these leaves are fenced round with strong prickles above an inch long The Fruit grows at the farther edge of the leaf it is as big as a large Plumb growing small near the leaf and big towards the top where it opens like a Medlar This Fruit at first is green like the leaf from whence it springs with small Prickles  about it but when ripe it is of a deep red colour The inside is full of small black Seeds mixt with a certain red Pulp like thick Syrup It is very pleasant in taste cooling and refreshing but if a Man eats or of them they will colour his Water making it look like Blood This I have often experienced yet found no harm by it  There are many Sugarworks in the Country and Estantions or Beef Farms There is also a great deal of Pitch Tar and Cordage made in the Country which is the chief of their Trade This Town we approached without any opposition and found no∣thing but empty Houses besides such things as they could not or would not carry away which were chiefly about Packs of Flower brought hither in the great Ship that we left at  Amapalla  and some Pitch Tar and Cordage These things we wanted and therefore we sent them all aboard Here we received Beefs promised by the Gentleman that was released coming from  Leon  besides we visited the BeefFarms every day and the SugarWorks going in small Companies of or Men and brought away every Man his Load for we found no Horses which if we had yet they ways were so wet and dirty that they would not have been serviceable to us We stayed here from the th till the th day and then some of our de∣structive Crew set fire to the Houses I know not by whose order but we marched away and left them burning at the Brestwork we imbarked into our Canoas and returned aboard our Ships  The th day Capt  Davis  and Capt  Swan  broke off Consortship for Capt  Davis  was minded to return again on the Coast of  Peru  but Capt  Swan  desired to go farther to the West∣ward I had till this time been with Capt  Davis  but now left him and went aboard of Capt  Swan  It was not from any dislike to my old Cap∣tain but to get some knowledge of the Northern Parts of this Continent of  Mexico  And I knew that Capt  Swan  determined to Coast it as far North as he thought convenient and then pass over for the  EastIndies  which was a way very agreeable to my In∣clination Capt  Townley  with his two Barks was resolved to keep us Company but Capt  Knight  and Capt  Harris  followed Captain  Davis  The th day in the Morning Capt  Davis  with his Ships went out of the Harbour having a fresh Land Wind They were in Company Capt  Davis  's Ship with Capt  Harris  in her Capt  Davis  's Bark and Fireship and Capt  Knight  in his own Ship in all Sail Capt  Swan  took his last farewel of him by firing Guns and he fired in return of the Civility  We stayed here some time afterwards to fill our Water and cut Firewood but our Men who had been very healthy till now began to fall down apace in Fevers Whether it was the badness of the Water or the unhealthiness of the Town was the cause of it we did not know but of the two I rather believe it was a distemper we got at  Ria Lexa  for it was reported that they had been vi∣sited with a Malignant Fever in that Town which had occasioned many People to abandon it and although this Visitation was over with them yet their Houses and Goods might still retain somewhat of the Infection and communicate the same to us  I the rather believe this because it afterwards raged very much not only among us but also among Capt  Davis  and his Men as he told me himself since when I met him in  England  Himself had like to have died as did several of his and our Men The d day of  September  we turned ashore all our Prisoners and Pilots they being unacquainted fur∣ther to the West which was the Coast that we de∣signed  to visit for the  Spaniards  have very little Trade by Sea beyond the River  Lempa  a little to the North West of this place  About a clock in the morning the same day we went from hence steering Westward being in company Sail as well as they who left us  viz  Captain  Swan  and his Bark and Capt  Townley  and his Bark and about Men  We met with very bad weather as we sailed along this Coast seldom a day past but we had one or two violent Tornadoes and with them very fright∣ful Flashes of Lightnings and Claps of Thunder I did never meet with the like before nor since These Tornadoes commonly came out of the N E the Wind did not last long but blew very fierce for the time When the Tornadoes were over we had the Wind at W sometimes at W S W and S W and sometimes to the North of the West as far as the N W  We kept at a good distance off shoar and saw no land till the th day but then being in lat d m the Volcan of  Guatimala  appeared in sight This is a very high Mountain with two peeks or heads appearing like two Sugarloaves It often belches forth Flames of Fire and Smoak from between the two heads and this as the  Spaniards  do report happens chiefly in tempestuous weather It is called so from the City  Guatimala  which stands near the foot of it about leagues from the South Sea and by report or leagues from the Gulf of  Matique  in the Bay of  Honduras  in the North Seas This City is famous for many rich Commodities that are produced thereabouts some almost peculiar to this Country and yearly sent into  Europe  especially rich Dyes Indico Otta or Anatta Silvester and Cochineel  Indico is made of an Herb which grows a foot and half or two foot high full of small Branches  and the Branches full of Leaves resembling the Leaves which grow on Flax but more thick and substantial They cut this Herb or Shrub and cast it into a large Cistern made in the Ground for that purpose which is half full of Water The Indico Stalk or Herb remains in the Water till all the leaves and I think the skin rind or bark rot off and in a manner dissolve but if any of the leaves should stick fast they force them off by much labour tossing and tumbling the Mass in the Water till all the pulpy substance is dissolved Then the Shrub or woody part is taken out and the Water which is like Ink being disturbed no more settles and the Indico falls to the bottom of the Cistern like Mud When it is thus settled they draw off the Water and take the Mud and lay it in the Sun to dry which there becomes hard as you see it brought home  Otta or Anatta is a red sort of Dye It is made of a red Flower that grows on Shrubs or foot high It is thrown into a Cistern of Water as the Indico is but with this difference that there is no stalk nor so much as the head of the Flower but only the Flower it self pull'd off from the head as you peel Roseleaves from the bud This remains in the Water till it rots and by much jumbling it dissolves to a liquid substance like the Indico and being settled and the Water drawn off the red Mud is made up into Rolls or Cakes and laid in the Sun to dry I did never see any made but at a place called the  Angels  in  Jamaica  at Sir  Tho Muddiford  's Plantations about years since but was grubb'd up while I was there and the Ground otherwise employed I do believe there is none any where else on  Jamaica  and even this probably was owing to the  Spaniards  when they had that Island Indico is common enough in  Jamaica  I observed they planted it most in sandy Ground they sow  great Fields of it and I think they sow it every year but I did never see the Seeds it bears In∣dico is produced all over the  WestIndies  on most of the  Caribbe Islands  as well as the Main yet no part of the Main yields such great quantities both of Indico and Otta as this Country about  Guatimala  I believe that Otta is made now only by the  Spani∣ards  for since the destroying that at the  Angels  Plantation in  Jamaica  I have not heard of any Improvement made of this Commodity by our Countrymen any where and as to  Jamaica  I have since been informed that 'tis wholly left off there I know not what quantities either of Indico or Ot∣ta are made at  Cuba  or  Hispaniola  but the place most used by our  Jamaica  Sloops for these things is the Island  Porto Rico  where our  Jamaica  Tra∣ders did use to buy Indico for Rials and Otta for Rials the Pound which is but  s    d  of our Money and yet at the same time Otta was worth in  Jamaica    s  the Pound and Indico  s    d  the Pound and even this also paid in Goods by which means alone they got or  per Cent  Our Traders had not then found the way of trading with the  Spaniards  in the Bay of  Honduras  but Captain  Coxon  went thither as I take it at the be∣ginning of the Year under pretence to cut Logwood and went into the Gulf of  Matique  which is in the bottom of that Bay There he landed with his Canoas and took a whole Store∣house full of Indico and Otta in Chests piled up in several parcels and marked with different marks ready to be shipt off aboard two Ships that then lay in the road purposely to take it in but these Ships could not come at him it being shole∣water He opened some of the Chests of Indico and supposing the other Chests to be all of the same species ordered his Men to carry them away They immediately set to work and took the nearest at  hand and having carried out one heap of Chests they seized on another great pile of a different mark from the rest intending to carry them away next But a  Spanish  Gentleman their Prisoner knowing that there was a great deal more than they could carry away desired them to take only such as belonged to the Merchants whose marks he undertook to shew them and to spare such as had the same mark with those in that great Pile they were then entring upon because he said those Chests belonged to the Ship Captains who fol∣lowing the Seas as themselves did he hoped they would for that reason rather spare their Goods than the Merchants They consented to his Request but upon their opening their Chests which was not before they came to  Jamaica  whereby conni∣vance they were permitted to sell them they found that the  Don  had been to sharp for them the few Chests which they had taken of the same mark with the great Pile proving to be Otto of greater value by far than the other whereas they might as well have loaded the whole Ship with Otto as with Indico  The  Cochineel  is an Insect bred in a sort of Fruit much like the PricklePear The Tree or Shrub that bears it is like the PricklePear Tree about foot high and so prickly only the Leaves are not quite so big but the Fruit is bigger On the top of the Fruit there grows a red Flower This Flow∣er when the Fruit is ripe falls down on the top of the Fruit which then begins to open and covers it so that no Rain nor Dew can wet the inside The next day or two days after its falling down the Flower being then scorched away by the heat of the Sun the Fruit opens as broad as the mouth of a Pint Pot and the inside of the Fruit is by this time sull of small red Insects with curious thin Wings As they were bred here so here they would die  for want of food and rot in their husks having by this time eaten up their mother Fruit did not the  Indians  who plant large fields of these Trees when once they perceive the Fruit open take care to drive them out for they spread under the branch∣es of the Tree a large Linnen Cloth and then with sticks they shake the branches and so disturb the poor Insects that they take wing to be gone yet hovering still over the head of their native Tree but the heat of the Sun so disorders them that they presently fall down dead on the Cloth spread for that purpose where the  Indians  let them remain or days longer till they are thoroughly dry When they fly up they are red when they fall down they are black and when first they are quite dry they are white as the sheet wherein they lie though the Colour change a little after These yield the much esteemed Scarlet The Cochineel∣trees are called by the  Spaniard  Toona's They are planted in the Country about  Guatimala  and about  Cheape  and  Guaxaca  all in the Kingdom of  Mexi∣co  The Silvester is a red Grain growing in a Fruit much resembling the Cochineelfruit as doth also the Tree that bears it There first shoots forth a yellow Flower then comes the Fruit which is longer than the Cochineel Fruit The Fruit being ripe opens also very wide The inside being full of these small Seeds or Grains they fall out with the least touch or shake The  Indians  that gather them hold a Dish under to receive the Seed and then shake it down These Trees grow wild and or of these Fruits will yield an ounce of Seed but of the Cochineelfruits or will yield an ounce of Insects The Silvester gives a Colour almost as fair as the Cochineel and so like it as to be often mistaken for it but it is not near so valuable I often made enquiry how the Silvester grows and of the Cochineel but was never fully satisfied till  I met a  Spanish  Gentleman that had lived years in the  WestIndies  and some years where these grow and from him I had these relations He was a ve∣ry Intelligent Person and pretended to be well ac∣quainted in the Bay of  Campeachy  therefore I exa∣mined him in many particulars concerning that Bay where I was well acquainted my self living there years He gave very true and pertinent answers to all my demands so that I could have no distrust of what he related  When we first saw the Mountain of  Guatimala  we were by judgment leagues distance from it As we came nearer the Land it appeared higher and plainer yet we saw no Fire but a little smoak pro∣ceeding from it The Land by the Sea was of a good height yet but low in comparison with that in the Country The Sea for about or leagues from the shoar was full of floating Trees or DriftWood as it is called of which I have seen a great deal but no where so much as here and Pumice∣stones floating which probably are thrown out of the burning Mountains and washed down to the shoar by the Rains which are very violent and frequent in this Country and on the side of  Hon∣duras  it is excessively wet  The th day we were in lat d m North and the Weather more settled Then Captain  Townley  took with him Men in Canoas and went away to the Westward where he intended to Land and romage in the Country for some refreshment for our sick Men we having at this time near half our Men sick and many were dead since we left  Ria Lexa  We in the Ships lay still with our Topsails furled and our Corses or lower Sails hal'd up this day and the next that Captain  Townley  might get the start of us  The th day we made sail again coasting to the Westward having the Wind at North and fair  weather We ran along by a tract of very high Land which came from the Eastward more within Land than we could see after we fell in with it it bare us company for about leagues and ended with a pretty gentle descent towards the West  There we had a perfect view of a pleasant low Country which seemed to be rich in Pasturage for Cattle It was plentifully furnished with Groves of green Trees mixt among the grassy Savannahs Here the Land was fenced from the Sea with high sandy Hills for the Waves all along this Coast run high and beat against the shoar very boisterously making the Land wholly unapproachable in Boats or Canoas So we coasted still along by this low Land or leagues farther keeping close to the shoar for fear of missing Captain  Townley  We lay by in the Night and in the Day made an easie sail  The d day of  October  Captain  Townley  came a∣board he had coasted along shoar in his Canoas seeking for an entrance but found none At last being out of hopes to find any Bay Creek or Ri∣ver into which he might safely enter he put a∣shoar on a sandy Bay but overset all his Canoas he had one Man drowned and several lost all their Arms and some of them that had not waxt up their Cartrage or Catouche Boxes wet all their Powder Captain  Townley  with much ado got a∣shoar and dragged the Canoas up dry on the Bay then every Man searched his CatoucheBox and drew the wet Powder out of his Gun and pro∣vided to march into the Country but finding it full of great Creeks which they could not ford they were forced to return again to their Canoas In the night they made good fires to keep themselves warm the next morning  Spaniards  and  Indians  fell on them but were immediately repulsed and made greater speed back than they had done for∣ward  Captain  Townley  followed them but not far For fear of his Canoas These Men came from  Te∣guantapeque  a Town that Captain  Townley  went chiefly to seek because the  Spanish  Books make mention of a large River there but whether it was run away at this time or rather Captain  Townley  and his Men were shortsighted I know not but they could not find it  Upon his return we presently made sail coasting still Westward having the Wind at E N E fair weather and a fresh gale We kept within mile of the shoar sounding all the way and found at miles distance from Land fathom at miles distance fathom gross Sand We saw no open∣ing nor sign of any place to land at so we sailed about leagues farther and came to a small high Island called  Tangola  were there is good anchor∣ing The Island is indifferently well furnished with Wood and Water and lieth about a league from the shoar The Main against the Island is pretty high champion Savannah Land by the Sea but or leagues within Land it is higher and very woody  We coasted a league farther and came to  Guatulco  This Port is in lat d m it is one of the best in all this Kingdom of  Mexico  Near a mile from the mouth of the Harbour on the Eastside there is a little Island close by the shoar and on the Westside of the mouth of the Harbour there is a great hollow Rock which by the continual work∣ing of the Sea in and out makes a great noise which may be heard a great way Every Surge that comes in forceth the Water out of a little hole on its top as out of a Pipe from whence it flies out just like the blowing of a Whale to which the  Spaniards  also liken it They call this Rock and Spout the  Buffadore  upon what account I know not Even  in the calmest Seasons the Sea beats in there ma∣king the Water spout out at the hole so that this is always a good mark to find the Harbour by The Harbour is about mile deep and one mile broad it runs in N W But the Westside of the Harbour is best to ride in for small Ships for there you may ride landlocked whereas any where else you are open to the S W Winds which often blow here There is good clean Ground any where and good gradual Soundings from to Fathom it is bounded with a smooth sandy Shoar very good to land at and at the bottom of the Harbour there is a fine Brook of fresh Water running into the Sea Here formerly stood a small  Spanish  Town or Vil∣lage which was taken by Sir  Francis Drake  but now there is nothing remaining of it beside a little Chapel standing among the Trees about paces from the Sea The Land appears in small short ridges parallel to the Shoar and to each other the innermost still gradually higher than that nearer the Shoar and they are all cloathed with very high flourishing Trees that it is extraordinary pleasant and delightful to behold at a distance I have no where seen any thing like it  At this place Captain  Swan  who had been very sick came ashoar and all the sick Men with him and the Surgeon to tend them Captain  Townley  again took a company of Men with him and went into the Country to seek for Houses or Inhabitants He marched away to the Eastward and came to the River  Capalita  which is a swift River yet deep near the mouth and is about a league from  Guatulco  There of his Men swam over the River and took  Indians  that were placed there as Centinels to watch for our coming These could none of them speak  Spanish  yet our Men by Signs made them understand that they desired to know if there was any Town or Village near who by the Signs  which they made gave our Men to understand that they could guide them to a Settlement but there was no understanding by them whether it was a  Spanish  or  Indian  Settlement nor how far it was thi∣ther They brought these  Indians  aboard with them and the next day which was the th day of  Octo∣ber  Captain  Townley  with Men of whom I was one went ashoar again taking one of these  Indians  with us for a Guide to conduct us to to this Settlement Our Men that stay'd aboard fill'd our Water and cut Wood and mended our Sails and our  Moskito  Men struck or Turtle every day They were a small sort of Turtle and not very sweet yet very well esteemed by us all because we had eaten no Flesh a great while The th day we returned out of the Country having been about  miles directly within Land before we came to any Settlement There we found a small  Indian  Village and in it a great quantity of Vinello's drying in the Sun  The Vinello is a little Cod full of small black Seeds it is or Inches long about the bigness of the Stem of a Tobacco Leaf and when dried much resembling it so that our Privateers at first have often thrown them away when they took any wondring why the  Spaniards  should lay up Tobac∣co Stems This Cod grows on a small Vine which climbs about and supports it self by the neighbour∣ing Trees it first bears a yellow Flower from whence the Cod afterwards proceeds It is first green but when ripe it turns yellow then the  Indi∣ans  whose Manufacture it is and who sell it cheap to the  Spaniards  gather it and lay it in the Sun which makes it soft then it changes to a Chesnut colour Then they frequently press it between their Fingers which makes it flat If the  Indians  do any thing to them beside I know not but I have seen the  Spaniards  sleek them with Oil  These Vines grow plentifully at  Boccatoro  where I have gathered and tried to cure them but could not which makes me think that the  Indians  have some Secret that I know not of to cure them I have often askt the  Spaniards  how they were cured but I never could meet with any could tell me One Mr  Cree  also a very curious Person who spoke  Spanish  well and had been a Privateer all his Life and years a Prisoner among the  Spaniards  at  Porto∣bel  and  Cartagena  yet upon all his Enquiry could not find any of them that understood it Could we have learnt the Art of it several of us would have gone to  Boccatoro  yearly at the dry Season and cured them and freighted our Vessel We there might have had Turtle enough for Food and store of Vinello's Mr  Cree  first shewed me those at  Boccatoro  At or near a Town also called  Caihooca  in the Bay of  Campeachy  these Cods are found They are commonly sold for pence a Cod among the  Spaniards  in the  WestIndies  and are sold by the Druggist for they are much used among Chocolate to perfume it Some will use them among Tobacco for it gives a delicate scent I never heard of any Vinello's but here in this Country about  Caihooca  and at  Boccatoro  The  Indians  of this Village could speak but little  Spanish  They seemed to be a poor innocent Peo∣ple and by them we understood that here are ve∣ry few  Spaniards  in these parts yet all the  Indians  hereabout are under them The Land from the Sea to their Houses is black Earth mixt with some Stones and Rocks all the way full of very high Trees  The th day we sent Canoas to the West∣ward who were ordered to lie for us at Port  An∣gels  where we were in hopes that by some means or other they might get Prisoners that might give us a better account of the Country than  at present we could have and we followed them with our Ships all our Men being now pretty well recovered of the Fever which had raged amongst us ever since we departed from  Ria Lexa  CHAP IX  They set out from  Guatulco  The Isle

again and Cape  Corrientes  The reason of their ill Success on the  Mexican  Coast and Departure thence for the  EastIndies  IT was the th of  October  when we set out of the Harbour of  Guatulco  with our Ships The Land here lies along West and a little South∣erly for about or Leagues and the Seawinds are commonly at W S W sometimes at S W the Landwinds at N We had now fair Weather and but little Wind We coasted along to the West∣ward keeping as near the shole as we could for the benefit of the Landwinds for the Seawinds were right against us and we found a Current setting to the Eastward which kept us back and obliged us to anchor at the Island  Sacrificio  which is a small green Island about half a mile long It lieth about a league to the West of  Guatulco  and about half a mile from the Main There seems to be a fine Bay to the West of the Island but it is full of Rocks The best riding is between the Island and the Main there you will have or fathom Water Here runs a pretty strong Tide the Sea riseth and falleth or foot up and down  The th day we sailed from hence coasting to the Westward after our Canoas We kept near the shoar which was all sandy Bays the Country  pretty high and woody and a great Sea tumbling in upon the shoar The d day of our Canoas came aboard and told us they had been a great way to the Westward but could not find Port  An∣gels  They had attempted to land the day before at a place where they saw a great many Bulls and Cows feeding in hopes to get some of them but the Sea run so high that they overset both Ca∣noas and wet all their Arms and lost Guns and had one Man drown'd and with much ado got off again They could give no account of the other Canoas for they lost company the first night that they went from  Guatulco  and had not seen them since  We were now abrest of  Port Angels  though our Men in the Canoas did not know it therefore we went in and anchored there This is a broad open Bay with or Rocks at the Westside Here is good anchoring all over the Bay in or or fathom Water but you must ride open to all Winds except the Landwinds till you come into or fathom Water then you are sheltered from the W S W which are the common Trade∣winds The Tide riseth here about foot the Flood sets to the N E and the Ebb to the S W The landing in this Bay is bad the place of land∣ing is close by the Westside behind a few Rocks here always goes a great swell The  Spaniards  com∣pare this Harbour for goodness to  Guatulco  but there is a great difference between them For  Cuatulco  is almost Landlocked and this an open road and no one would easily know it by their Cha∣racter of it but by its Marks and its Latitude which is d North For this reason our Canoas which were sent from  Guatulco  and ordered to tarry here for us did not know it not thinking this to be that fine Harbour and therefore went farther  of them as I said before returned again but the  other were not yet come to us The Land that bounds this Harbour is pretty high the Earth sandy and yellow in some places red it is partly Wood∣land partly Savannahs The Trees in the Woods are large and tall and the Savannahs are plenti∣fully stored with very kindly Grass Two leagues to the East of this place is a Beef Farm belonging to  Don Diego de la Rosa  The day we landed about Men and march∣ed thither where we found plenty of of fat Bulls and Cows feeding in the Savannahs and in the House good store of Salt and Maiz and some Hogs and Cocks and Hens but the Owners or Overseers were gone We lay here or days feasting on fresh Provision but could not contrive to carry any quan∣tity aboard because the way was so long and our Men but weak and a great wide River to ford Therefore we returned again from thence the th day and brought every one a little Beef or Pork for the Men that stay'd aboard The two nights that we stay'd ashoar at this place we heard great droves of Jaccals as we suppos'd them to be bark∣ing all night long not far from us None of us saw these but I do verily believe they were Jaccals tho' I did never see those Creatures in  America  nor hear any but at this time We could not think that there were less than or in a company We got aboard in the Evening but did not yet hear a∣ny news of our two Canoas  The th day in the morning we sailed from hence with the Landwind at N by W The Sea∣wind came about noon at W S W and in the even∣ing we anchored in fathom Water by a small rocky Island which lieth about half a mile from the Main and leagues Westward from Port  An∣gels  The  Spaniards  give no account of this Island in their Pilotbook The th day we sailed again with the Landwind In the afternoon the Sea∣breez  blew hard and we sprung our Main Topmast This Coast is full of small Hills and Valleys and a great Sea falls in upon the shore In the Night we met with the other two of our Canoas that went from us at  Guatulco  They had been as far as  Acapulco  to seek  Port Angels  Coming back from thence they went into a River to get Water and were encountered by  Spaniards  yet they filled their Water in spight of them but had one Man shot thro' the Thigh Afterward they went into a Lagune or Lake of Saltwater where they found much dried Fish and brought some aboard We being now a∣brest of that place sent in a Canoa mann'd with Men for more Fish The mouth of this Lagune is not Pistolshotwide and on both sides are pretty high Rocks so conveniently placed by Nature that many Men may abscond behind and within the Rock and Lagune opens wide on both sides The  Spaniards  being alarmed by our two Canoas that had been there two or three days before came armed to this Place to secure their Fish and seeing our Canoa coming they lay snug behind the Rocks and suf∣fered the Canoa to pass in then they fired their Volley and wounded five of our Men Our People were a little surprized at this sudden Adventure yet fired their Guns and rowed farther into the Lagune for they durst not adventure to come out again through the narrow Entrance which was near a quarter of a Mile in length Therefore they rowed into the middle of the Lagune where they lay out of Gunshot and looked about to see if there was not another Passage to get out at broader than that by which we entred but could see none So they lay still two Days and three Nights in hopes that we should come to seek them but we lay off at Sea about three Leagues distant waiting for their return supposing by their long absence that they had made some greater Discovery and were  gone farther than the FishRange because it is usu∣al with Privateers when they enter upon such de∣signs to search farther than they proposed if they meet any Encouragement But Capt  Townley  and his Bark being nearer the shore heard some Guns fired in the Lagune So he mann'd his Canoa and went towards the shore and beating the  Spaniards  away from the Rocks made a free passage for our Men to come out of their Pound where else they must have been starved or knocked on the head by the  Spaniards  They came aboard their Ships again the st of  Octob  This Lagune is about the lat of d m North  From hence we made sail again coasting to the Westward having fair Weather and a Current set∣ting to the West The second day of  November  we past by a Rock called by the  Spaniards  the  Alga∣tross  The Land hereabout is of an indifferent height and woody and more within the Country Mountainous Here are or white Cliffs by the Sea which are very remarkable because there are none so white and so thick together on all the Coast They are five or six Mile to the West of the  Algatross  Rock There is a dangerous shoal lieth S by W from these Cliffs four or five Mile off at Sea Two leagues to the West of these Cliffs there is a pretty large River which forms a small Island at its Mouth The Channel on the East side is but shoal and sandy but the West Channel is deep enough for Canoas to enter On the Banks of this Channel the  Spaniards  have made a Brestwork to hinder an Enemy from landing or filling Water  The d day we Anchored abrest of this River in fathom Water about a Mile and a half off shore The next Morning we mann'd our Canoas and went ashore to the Brestwork with little resistance although there were about Men to keep us off They fired about or Guns at us but seeing  we were resolved to land they quitted the place one chief reason why the  Spaniards  are so frequently routed by us although many times much our su∣periors in numbers and in many places fortified with Brestworks is their want of small Firearms for they have but few on all the Sea Coasts unless near their larger Garisons Here we found a great deal of Salt brought hither as I judge for to salt Fish which they take in the Lagunes The Fish I observed here mostly were what we call Snooks neither a Seafish nor fresh Waterfish but very nu∣merous in these salt Lakes This Fish is about a Foot long and round and as thick as the small of a Man's Leg with a pretty long head It hath Scales of a whitish colour and is good meat How the  Spaniards  take them I know not for we never found any Nets Hooks or Lines neither yet any Bark Boat or Canoa among them on all this Coast except the Ship I shall mention at  Acapulco  We marched two or three Leagues into the Coun∣try and met with but one House where we took a  Mulatto  Prisoner who informed us of a Ship that was lately arrived at  Acapulco  she came from  Lima  Captain  Townley  wanting a good Ship thought now he had an opportunity of getting one if he could perswade his Men to venture with him into the Harbour of  Acapulco  and fetch this  Lima  Ship out Therefore he immediately proposed it and found not only all his own Men willing to assist him but many of Captain  Swan  's Men also Cap∣tain  Swan  opposed it because Provision being scares with us he thought our time might be much bet∣ter imployed in first providing our selves with rood and here was plenty of Maiz in the River where we now were as we were informed by the same Prisoner who offered to conduct us to the place where it was But neither the present necessity nor  Captain  Swan  's perswasion availed any thing no nor yet their own interest for the great design we had then in hand was to lie and wait for a rich Ship which comes to  Acapulco  every Year richly la∣den from the  Philippine  Islands But it was necessary we should be well stored with Provisions to ena∣ble us to Cruise about and wait the time of her co∣ming However  Townley  's Party prevailing we only fill'd our Water here and made ready to be gone So the fifth Day in the Afternoon we sailed again Coasting to the Westward toward  Acapulco  The th Day in the Afternoon being about twelve Leagues from the shoar we saw the high Land of  Acapulco  which is very remarkable for there is a round Hill standing between two other Hills the Westermost of which is the biggest and highest and hath two Hillocks like two Paps on its top the Eastermost Hill is higher and sharper than the mid∣dlemost From the middle Hill the Land declines toward the Sea ending in a high round point There is no Land shaped like this on all the Coast In the evening Captain  Townley  went away from the Ships with Men in Canoas to try to get the  Lima  Ship out of  Acapulco  Harbour  Acapulco  is a pretty large Town degrees North of the Equator It is the SeaPort for the City of  Mexico  on the West side of the Continent as  La Vera Cruz  or  St John d' Ulloa  in the Bay of  Nova Hispania  is on the North side This Town is the only place of Trade on all this Coast for there is little or no Traffick by Sea on all the N W part of this vast Kingdom here being as I have said neither Boats Barks nor Ships that I could ever see unless only what come hither from other parts and some Boats near the S E end of  California  as I guess by the intercourse between that and the Main for Pearlfishing  The Ships that Trade hither are only three two that constantly go once a Year between this and  Manila  in  Luconia  one of the  Philippine  Islands and one Ship more every Year to and from  Lima  This from  Lima  commonly arrives a little before  Christ∣mas  she brings them Quicksilver Cacao and Pieces of Eight Here she stays till the  Manila  Ships arrive and then takes in a Cargo of Spices Silks Callicoes and Muslins and other  EastIndia  Commodities for the use of  Peru  and then re∣turns to  Lima  This is but a small Vessel of Guns but the two  Manila  Ships are each said to be above Tun These make their Voyages alternately so that one or other of them is always at the  Manila  's When either of them sets out from  Acapulco  it is at the latter end of  March  or the beginning of  April  she always touches to re∣fresh at  Guam  one of the  Ladrone  Islands in about Days space after she sets out There she stays but two or three Days and then prosecutes her Voyage to  Manila  where she commonly arrives some time in  June  By that time the other is ready to sail from thence laden with  EastIndia  Commodities She stretcheth away to the North as far as or sometimes into degrees of North lat before she gets a Wind to stand over to the  American  shoar She falls in first with the Coast of  California  and then Coasts along the shoar to the South again and never misses a Wind to bring her away from thence quite to  Acapulco  When she gets the length of Cape  St Lucas  which is the Southermost point of  California  she stretcheth over to Cape  Corientes  which is in about the th degree of North lat from thence she Coasts along till she comes to  Sal∣lagua  and there she sets ashoar Passengers that are bound to the City of  Mexico  From thence she makes her best way Coasting still along shoar till she arrives at  Acapulco  which is commonly about  Christmas  never more than or days before or after Upon the return of this Ship to the  Manila  the other which stayeth there till her arrival takes her turn back to  Acapulco  Sir  John Narborough  there∣fore was imposed on by the  Spaniards  who told him that there were Sail or more that used this Trade  The Port of  Acapulco  is very commodious for the reception of Ships and so large that some hundreds may safely Ride there without damnify∣ing each other There is a small low Island cros∣sing the mouth of the Harbour it is about a Mile and a half long and half a Mile broad stretching East and West It leaves a good wide deep Chan∣nel at each end where Ships may safely go in or come out taking the advantage of the Winds they must enter with the SeaWind and go out with the LandWind for these Winds seldom or never fail to succeed each other alternately in their proper season of the Day or Night The Westermost Channel is the narrowest but so deep there is no Anchoring and the  Manila  Ships pass in that way but the Ships from  Lima  enter on the S W Chan∣nel This Harbour runs in North about Miles then growing very narrow it turns short about to the West and runs about a Mile farther where it ends The Town stands on the N W side at the mouth of this narrow passage close by the Sea and at the end of the Town there is a Platform with a great many Guns Opposite to the Town on the East side stands a high strong Castle said to have Guns of a very great bore Ships com∣monly Ride near the bottom of the Harbour under the Command both of the Castle and the Plat∣form  Captain  Townly  who as I said before with Men left our Ships on a design to fetch the  Lima  Ship out of the Harbour had not Rowed above or Leagues before the Voyage was like to end  with all their Lives for on a sudden they were en∣countred with a violent Tornado from the shore which had like to have foundered all the Canoas but they escaped that danger and the second night got safe into  Port Marquis Port Marquis  is a very good Harbour a League to the East of  Acapulco  Har∣bour Here they staid all the next Day to dry them∣selves their Cloaths their Arms and Ammunition and the next Night they rowed softly into  Acapulco  Harbour and because they would not be heard they hal'd in their Oars and paddled as softly as if they had been seeking Manatee They paddled close to the Castle then struck over to the Town and found the Ship riding between the Brestwork and the Fort within about Yards of each When they had well viewed her and considered the danger of the design they thought it not possi∣ble to accomplish it therefore they paddled softly back again till they were out of command of the Forts and then they went to Land and fell in a∣mong a Company of  Spanish  Soldiers for the  Spani∣ards  having seen them the day before had set Guards along the Coast who immediately fired at them but did them no damage only made them retire farther from the shore They lay afterwards at the mouth of the Harbour till it was day to take a view of the Town and Castle and then returned aboard again being tired hungry and sorry for their Dis∣appointment  The th day we made sail again further on to the Westward with the Land wind which is com∣monly at N E but the Sea winds are at S W We passed by a long sandy Bay of above Leagues All the way along it the Sea falls with such force on the shore that it is impossible to come near it with Boat or Canoa yet it is good clean ground and good an∣choring a Mile or two from the shore The Land by the Sea is low and indifferent Fertile produ∣cing  many sorts of Trees especially the spreading  which grows in spots from one end of the Bay to the other  The P  tree is as big as an ordinary Ash growing about or Foot high The Body is clear from Boughs or Branches till just at the head there it spreads forth many large green Branches not much unlike the Cabbage tree before described These Branches also grow in many Places as in  Jamaica Darien  the Bay of  Campeachy  c from a stump not above a Foot or two high which is not the Remains of a Tree cut down for none of these sort of Trees will ever grow again when they have once lost their Head but these are a sort of Dwarfpalm and the Branches which grow from the stump are not so large as those that grow on the great Tree These smaller Branches are used both in the  East  and  West Indies  for thatching Houses They are very lasting and serviceable much surpassing the Palmeto For this Thatch if well laid on will endure five or six Years and this is called by the  Spaniards  the  Palmeto Royal  The  English  at  Jamaica  give it the same Name Whether this be the same which they in  Guinea  get the Palm wine from I know not but I know that it is like this  The Land in the Country is full of small pecked barren Hills making as many little Valleys which appear flourishing and green At the Westend of this Bay is the Hill of  Petaplan  in lat d m N This is a round Point stretching out into the Sea At a distance it seems to be an Island A little to the West of this Hill are several round Rocks which we left without us steering in between them and the round Point where we had fa∣thom Water We came to an Anchor on the N W side of the Hill and went ashore about Men of us and marched into the Country or  Miles There we came to a poor  Indian  Village that did not afford us a Meal of Victuals The Peo∣ple all fled only a  Mulatto  Woman and three or four small Children who were taken and brought a∣board She told us that a Carrier one who drives a Caravan of Mules was goin to  Acapulco  laden with Flower and other Goods but stopt in the Road for fear of us a little to the West of this Village for he had heard of our being on this Coast and she thought he still remained there And therefore it was we kept the Woman to be our Guide to car∣ry us to that place At this place where we now lay our  Moskitomen  struck some small Turtle and many small  Jewfish  The  Jewfish  is a very good Fish and I judge so called by the  English  because it hath Scales and Fins therefore a clean Fish according to the  Levitical Law  and the  Jews  at  Jamaica  buy them and eat them very freely It is a very large Fish shaped much like a Cod but a great deal bigger one will weigh or or hundred weight It hath a large Head with great Fins and Scales as big as an HalfCrown answerable to the bigness of his Body It is very sweet Meat and commonly fat This Fish lives among Rocks there are plenty of them in the  West Indies  about  Jamaica  and the Coast of  Caraccos  but chiefly in these Seas especially more Westward  We went from hence with our Ships the th day and steered West about two Leagues farther to a place called  Chequetan  A Mile and half from the shore there is a small Key and within it is a very good Harbour where Ships may careen there is also a small River of fresh Water and Wood enough  The th Day in the Morning we went with Men in six Canoas to seek for the Carrier taking the  MulattoWoman  for our Guide but Captain  Townley  would not go with us Before day we lan∣ded  at a place called  Estapa  a League to the West of  Chequeton  The Woman was well acquainted here having been often at this place for Muscles as she told us for here are great plenty of them They seem in all respects like our  English  Muscles She carry'd us through the pathless Wood by the side of a River for about a League Then we came into a Savannah full of Bulls and Cows and here the Carrier beforementioned was lying at the Estan∣tionhouse with his Mules not having dared to advance all this while as not knowing where we lay so his own fear made him his Mules and all his Goods become a Prey to us He had Packs of Flower some Chocolate a great many small Cheeses and abundance of Earthen Ware The Eatables we brought away but the Earthen Vessels we had no occasion for and therefore left them The Mules were about We brought our Prize with them to the Shore and so turned them away Here we also kill'd some Cows and brought with us to our Canoas In the Afternoon our Ships came to an Anchor half a Mile from the place where we landed and then we went aboard Captain  Townley  seeing our good success went ashore with his Men to kill some Cows for here were no Inhabitants near to oppose us The Land is very woody of a good fertile Soil watered with many small Rivers yet it hath but few Inhabitants near the Sea Capt  Townley  kill'd Beefs and after he came aboard our Men contrary to Captain  Swan  's inclination gave Capt  Townley  part of the Flower which we took ashore Afterwards we gave the Woman some Cloaths for her and her Children and put her and two of them ashore but one of them a very pretty Boy about or Years old Capt  Swan  kept The Woman cried and begg'd hard to have him but Capt  Swan  would not but promised to make much of him and was as  good as his word He proved afterwards a very fine Boy for Wit Courage and Dexterity I have often wonder'd at his Expressions and Actions  The st day in the evening we sailed hence with the LandWind The LandWinds on this part of the Coast are at N and the SeaWinds at W S W We had fair Weather and Coasted along to the Westward The Land is high and full of ragged Hills and West from these ragged Hills the Land makes many pleasant and fruitful Valleys among the Mountains The th day we were abrest of a very remarkable Hill which towring above the rest of its fellows is divided in the top and makes two small parts It is in lat d m North The  Spaniards  make mention of a Town called  Thelupan  near this Hill which we would have visited if we could have found the way to it The th day Captain  Swan  and Capt  Townley  with Men of whom I was one went in our Canoas to seek for the City of  Colima  a rich Place by report but how far within Land I could never learn for as I said before here is no Trade by Sea and therefore we could never get Guides to inform us or conduct us to any Town but one or two on this Coast and there is never a Town that lieth open to the Sea but  Acapulco  and therefore our search was commonly fruitless as now for we rowed above Leagues along shoar and found it a very bad Coast to Land We saw no House nor sign of In∣habitants although we past by a fine Valley called the Valley of  Maguella  only at two places the one at our first setting out on this Expedition and the other at the end of it we saw a Horseman set as we supposed as a Centinel to watch us At both places we landed with difficulty and at each place we followed the track of the Horse on the sandy Bay but where they entred the Woods we lost the track and although we diligently searcht  for it yet we could find it no more so we were perfectly at a loss to find out the Houses or Town they came from The th Day being tired and hopeless to find any Town we went aboard our Ships that were now come abrest of the place where we were for always when we leave our Ships we either order a certain place of meeting or else leave them a sign to know where we are by making one or more great Smoaks yet we had all like to have been ruin'd by such a signal as this in a former Voyage under Captain  Sharp  when we made that unfortunate Attempt upon  Arica  which is mentioned in the  History of the Buccaneers  For upon the routing our Men and taking several of them some of those so taken told the  Spaniards  that it was agreed between them and their Com∣panions on board to make two great Smoaks at a distance from each other as soon as the Town should be taken as a signal to the Ship that it might safely enter the Harbour The  Spaniards  made these Smoaks presently I was then among those who staid on board and whether the signal was not so exactly made or some other discourage∣ment happen'd I remember not but we forbore going in till we saw our scatter'd Crew coming off in their Canoas Had we enter'd the Port upon the false signal we must have been taken or sunk for we must have past close by the Fort and could have had no Wind to bring us out till the LandWind should rise in the Night  But to our present Voyage After we came a∣board we saw the Volcan of  Colima  This is a very high Mountain in about d m North standing or Leagues from the Sea in the midst of a pleasant Valley It appears with two sharp peeks from each of which there do always issue flames of fire or smoak The Valley in which this Volcan stands is callel the Valley of  Colima  from the Town  it self which stands there not far from the Volcan The Town is said to be great and rich the chief of all its Neighbourhood and the Valley in which it is seated by the relation which the  Spaniards  give of it is the most pleasant and fruitful Valley in all the Kingdom of  Mexico  This Valley is about ten or twelve Leagues wide by the Sea where it makes a small Bay but how far the Vale runs into the Country I know not It is said to be full of Cacoa∣gardens Fields of Corn Wheat and PlantainWalks The neighbouring Sea is bounded with a sandy shoar but there is no going ashoar for the violence of the Waves The Land within it is low all along and Woody for about two Leagues from the East side at the end of the Woods there is a deep River runs out into the Sea but it hath such a great Bar or sandy Shoal that when we were here no Boat or Canoa could possibly enter the Sea running so high upon the Bar otherwise I judge we should have made some farther discove∣ry into this pleasant Valley On the West side of the River the Savannah land begins and runs to the other side of the Valley We had but little Wind when we came aboard therefore we lay off this Bay that Afternoon and the Night ensuing  The th Day our Captains went away from our Ships with Men intending at the first conve∣nient place to land and search about for a Path for the  Spanish  Books make mention of or other Towns hereabouts especially one called  Sallagua  to the West of this Bay Our Canoas rowed along as near the shoar as they could but the Sea went so high that they could not land About or a Clock two Horsemen came near the shoar and one of them took a Bottle out of his Pocket and drank to our Men While he was drinking one of our Men snatch'd up his Gun and let drive at him and kill'd his Horse so his Consort immediately set Spurs to  his Horse and rode away leaving the other to come after afoot But he being Booted made but slow haste therefore two of our Men stript them∣selves and swam ashoar to take him But he had a Macheat or long Knife wherewith he kept them both from seizing him they having nothing in their Hands wherewith to defend themselves or offend him The th day our Men came all a∣board again for they could not find any place to land in  The first day of  December  we passed by the Port of  Sallagua  This Port is in lat d m It is only a pretty deep Bay divided in the middle with a rocky point which makes as it were two Har∣bours Ships may ride securely in either but the West Harbour is the best there is good Anchoring any where in or fathom and a Brook of fresh Water runs into the Sea Here we saw a great new thatched House and a great many  Spaniards  both Horse and Foot with Drums beating and Co∣lours flying in defiance of us as we thought We took no notice of them till the next Morning and then we landed about Men to try their Cou∣rage but they presently withdrew The Foot ne∣ver stay'd to exchange one shot but the Horsemen stay'd till two or three were knock'd down and then they drew off our Men pursuing them At last two of our Men took two Horses that had lost their Ri∣ders and mounting them rode after the  Spaniards  full drive till they came among them thinking to have taken a Prisoner for Intelligence but had like to have been taken themselves for four  Spaniards  sur∣rounded them after they had discharged their Pi∣stols and unhorsed them and if some of our best Footmen had not come to their rescue they must have yielded or have been killed They were both cut in two or three places but their Wounds were not Mortal The four  Spaniards  got away before our Men  could hurt them and mounting their Horses speed∣ed after their Consorts who were marched away into the Country Our Men finding a broad Road leading into the Country followed it about four Leagues in a dry stony Country full of short Wood but finding no sign of Inhabitants they returned again In their way back they took two  Mullatto  's who were not able to march as fast as their Consorts therefore they had skulked in the Woods and by that means thought to have escaped our Men These Prisoners informed us that this great Road did lead to a great City called  Oarrha  from whence many of those Horsemen before spoken of came That this City was distant from hence as far as a Horse will go in four Days and that there is no place of consequence nearer That the Country is very poor and thinly inhabited They said also that these Men came to assist the  Philippine  Ship that was every day expected here to put ashore Passen∣gers for  Mexico  The  Spanish  PilotBooks mention a Town also called  Sallogua  hereabouts but we could not find it nor hear any thing of it by our Prisoners  We now intended to cruise off the Cape  Corrien∣tes  to wait for the  Philippine  Ship So the th Day of  Decemb  we set sail coasting to the Westwards towards Cape  Corrientes  We had fair Weather and but little Wind the SeaBreezes at N W and the Land Wind at N The Land is of an indifferent heighth full of ragged Points which at a distance appear like Islands The Country is very woody but the Trees are not high nor very big  Here I was taken sick of a Fever and Ague that afterwards turned to a Dropsie which I laboured under a long time after and many of our Men died of this Distemper though our Surgeons used their greatest skill to preserve their Lives The Dropsie is a general Distemper on this Coast and the Natives  say that the best remedy they can find for it is the Stone or Cod of an Allegator of which they have one near each Leg within the Flesh pulverized and drunk in Water This Receipt we also found menti∣oned in an Almanack made at  Mexico  I would have tried it but we found no Allegators here tho' there are several  There are many good Harbours between  Salla∣gua  and Cape  Corrientes  but we passed by them all As we drew near the Cape the Land by the Sea appeared of an indifferent heighth full of white Cliffs but in the Country the Land is high and barren and full of sharp pecked Hills unpleasant to the sight To the West of this ragged Land is a Chain of Mountains running parallel with the Shore They end on the West with a gentle descent but on the East side they keep their heighth ending with a high steep Mountain which hath three small sharp pecked tops somewhat resembling a Crown and therefore called by the  Spaniards Coronada  the  Crown Land  The th day we were fair in sight of Cape  Cor∣rientes  it bore N by W and the  Crown Land  bore North The Cape is of an indifferent heighth with steep Rocks to the Sea It is flat and even on the top cloathed with Woods The Land in the Coun∣try is high and doubled This Cape lieth in d m North I find its longitude from  Tenariff  to be d m but I keep my longitude Westward according to our Course and according to this reckoning I find it is from the  Lizard  in  England  d m so that the difference of time is eight Hours and almost six Minutes  Here we had resolved to cruize for the  Philippine  Ship because she always makes this Cape in her Voyage homeward We were as I have said four Ships in Company Captain  Swan  and his Ten∣der Captain  Townley  and his Tender It was so  ordered that Captain  Swan  should lye Eight or Ten Leagues off shore and the rest about a League di∣stant each from other between him and the Cape that so we might not miss the  Philippine  Ship but we wanted Provision and therefore we sent Capt  Townley  's Bark with or Men to the West of the Cape to search about for some Town or Planta∣tions where we might get Provision of any sort The rest of us in the mean time cruising in our Stations The th Day the Bark came to us again but had got nothing for they could not get about the Cape because the Wind on this Coast is commonly be∣tween the N W and the S W which makes it very difficult getting to the Westward but they left four Canoas with Men at the Cape who resol∣ved to row to the Westward The th Day we sailed to the Keys of  Chametly  to fill our Water These Keys or Islands of  Chametly  are about or Leagues to the Eastward of Cape  Corrientes  They are small low and woody invironed with Rocks there are five of them lying in the form of an half Moon not a Mile from the shore and be∣tween them and the Main is very good Riding se∣cure from any Wind The  Spaniards  do report that here live Fishermen to fish for the Inhabitants of the City of  Purification  This is said to be a large Town the best hereabouts but is Leagues up in the Country  The th instant we entred within these Islands passing in on the S E side and Anchored between the Islands and the Main in five fathom clean Sand Here we found good fresh water and wood and caught plenty of Rockfish with Hook and Line a sort of Fish I described at the Isle of  John Fernando  but we saw no sign of Inhabitants besides three or four old Hutts therefore I do believe that the  Spanish  or  Indian  Fishermen come hither only at  Lent  or some other such Season but that they do not live  here constantly The st Day Captain  Townley  went away with about Men to take an  Indian  Village or Leagues from hence to the Westward more towards the Cape and the next Day we went to cruise off the Cape where Captain  Townley  was to meet us The th Day as we were cruising off the Cape the four Canoas beforementioned which Captain  Townley  's Bark left at the Cape came off to us They after the Bark left them past to the VVest of the Cape and rowed into the Valley  Valderas  or perhaps  Val d' Iris  for it signi∣fies the  Valley of Flags  This Valley lies in the bottom of a pretty deep Bay that runs in between Cape  Corrientes  on the S E and the point of  Pontique  on the N VV which two places are about Leagues asunder The Valley is about Leagues wide there is a level sandy Bay against the Sea and good smooth land∣ing In the midst of the Bay is a fine River where∣into Boats may enter but it is brackish at the latter end of the dry Season which is in  February March  and part of  April  I shall speak more of the Seasons in my Chapter of VVinds in the Ap∣pendix This Valley is bounded within Land with a small green Hill that makes a very gentle de∣scent into the Valley and affords a very pleasant prospect to Seaward It is inriched with fruitful Savannahs mixt with Groves of Trees fit for any uses besides FruitTrees in abundance as Guava's Oranges and Limes which here grow wild in such plenty as if Nature had designed it only for a Garden The Savannahs are full of fat Bulls and Cows and some Horses but no House in sight  VVhen our Canoas came to this pleasant Valley they landed Men and marched into the Coun∣try seeking for some Houses They had not gone past three Mile before they were attackt by  Spa∣niards  Horse and Foot There was a small thin  VVood close by them into which our Men retreat∣ed to secure themselves from the fury of the Horse Yet the  Spaniards  rode in among them and attackt them very furiously till the  Spanish  Captain and more tumbled dead off their Horses then the rest retreated being many of them wounded VVe lost four Men and had two desperately wounded In this action the Foot who were armed with Lances and Swords and were the greatest number never made any attack the Horsemen had each a brace of Pistols and some short Guns If the Foot had come in they had certainly destroy'd all our Men VVhen the Skirmish was over our Men placed the two wounded Men on Horses and came to their Canoas There they kill'd one of the Horses and dress'd it being afraid to venture into the Savannah to kill a Bullock of which there was store VVhen they had eaten and satisfied themselves they re∣turned aboard The th Day being  Christmass  we cruised in pretty near the Cape and sent in Canoas with the Strikers to get Fish being desi∣rous to have a  Christmas  Dinner In the Afternoon they returned aboard with three great  Jew fish  which feasted us all and the next Day we sent a∣shoar our Canoas again and got three or four more  Captain  Townley  who went from us at  Chametly  came aboard the th Day and brought about Bushels of Maiz He had landed to the Eastward of Cape  Corrientes  and march'd to an  Indian  Village that is or Leagues in the Country The  Indians  seeing him coming set two Houses on fire that were full of Maiz and run away yet he and his Men got in other Houses as much as they could bring down on their backs which he brought aboard  We cruised off the Cape till the first Day of  Ja∣nuary  and then made towards the Valley  Valderas  to hunt for Beef and before Night we Anchored in the bottom of the Bay in fathom  Water a Mile from the Shoar Here we stay'd hunting till the th Day and Captain  Swan  and Captain  Townley  went ashoar every Morning with about Men and marched to a small Hill where they remained with or Men to watch the  Spaniards  who appeared in great companies on other Hills not far distant but did never attempt any thing against our Men Here we killed and salt∣ed above two Months Meat besides what we spent fresh and might have killed as much more if we had been better stored with Salt Our hopes of meeting the  Philippine  Ship were now over for we did all conclude that while we were necessitated to hunt here for Provisions she was past by to the Eastward as indeed she was as we did understand afterwards by Prisoners So this design fail'd through Captain  Townley  's eagerness after the  Lima  Ship which he attempted in  Acapulco  Harbour as I have related For though we took a little Flow∣er hard by yet the same Guide which told us of that Ship would have conducted us where we might have had store of Beef and Maiz but instead there∣of we lost both our time and the opportunity of providing our selves and so we were forced to be victualling when we should have been cruising off Cape  Corrientes  in expectation of the  Manila  Ship  Hitherto we had coasted along here with two dif∣ferent designs the one was to get the  Manila  Ship which would have inriched us beyond measure and this Captain  Townley  was most for Sir  Tho Cavendish  formerly took the  Manila  Ship off Cape  St Lucas  in  California  where we also would have waited for her had we been early enough stored with Provisions to have met her there and threw much rich Goods overboard The other design which Captain  Swan  and our Crew were most for was to search along the Coast for rich Towns and Mines chiefly of Gold and Silver which we were  assured were in this Country and we hoped near the shoar not knowing as we afterwards found that it was in effect an Inland Country its Wealth remote from the  South Sea  Coast and having little or no commerce with it its Trade being driven Eastward with  Europe  by  La Vera Cruz  Yet we had still some expectation of Mines and so resolved to Steer on farther Northward but Captain  Town∣ley  who had no other design in coming on this Coast but to meet this Ship resolved to return again towards the Coast of  Peru  In all this Voyage on the  Mexican  Coast we had with us a Captain and two or three of his Men of our friendly  Indians  of the Isthmus of  Darien  who having conducted over some parties of our Privateers and expressing a desire to go along with us were received and kindly entertained aboard our Ships and we were pleas'd in having by this means Guides ready provided should we be for returning over Land as several of us thought to do rather than sail round about But at this time we of Captain  Swan  's Ship designing farther to the NorthWest and Captain  Townley  going back we com∣mitted these our  Indian  Friends to his care to carry them home So here we parted he to the East∣ward and we to the Westward intending to search as far to the Westward as the  Spaniards  were settled  It was the th Day of  January  in the Morning when we sailed from this pleasant Valley The Wind was at N E and the weather fair At a Clock the Seawind came at N W Before Night we passed by Point  Pontique  this is the West point of the Bay of the Valley of  Valderas  and is distant from Cape  Corrientes  Leagues This point is in lat d m North it is high round rocky and barren At a distance it appears like an Island A league to the West of this point are two small bar∣ren  Islands called the Islands of  Pontique  There are several high sharp white Rocks that lie scat∣tering about them We pass'd between these rocky Islands on the left and the Main on the right for there is no danger The Seacoast beyond this point runs Northward for about Leagues making ma∣ny ragged points with small sandy Bays between them The Land by the Seaside is low and pretty woody but in the Country full of high sharp barren rugged unpleasant Hills  The th Day we had sight of a small white Rock which appears very much like a Ship under sail This Rock is in lat d m it is Leagues from the Main There is a good Channel between it and the Main where you will have or fathom Water near the Island but running nearer the Main you will have gradual soundings till you come in with the shoar At Night we Anchored in six fathom Water near a League from the Main in good ouzy ground We caught a great many  Cat∣fish  here and at several places on this Coast both before and after this  From this Island the Land runs more Northerly making a fair sandy Bay but the Sea falls in with such violence on the shoar that there is no land∣ing but very good Anchoring on all the Coast and gradual Soundings About a League off shoar you will havo fathom and Mile off shoar you will have fathom Water We came to an Anchor every Evening and in the Mornings we sailed off with the Landwind which we found at N E and the Seabreezes at N W  The th Day we Anchored about three Miles on the East side of the Islands  Chametly  different from those of that name beforementioned for these are six small Islands in lat d m a little to the South of the Tropick of  Cancer  and about Leagues from the Main where a Salt Lake hath its outlet  into the Sea These Isles are of an indifferent heighth Some of them have a few shrubby bushes the rest are bare of any sort of Wood They are rocky round by the Sea only one or two of them have sandy Bays on the North side There is a sort of Fruit growing on these Islands called Penguins and 'tis all the Fruit they have  The Penguin Fruit is of two sorts the yellow and the red The yellow Penguin grows on a green Stem as big as a Man's Arm above a Foot high from the ground The Leaves of this Stalk are half a Foot long and an Inch broad the edges full of sharp prickles The Fruit grows at the Head of the Stalk in or great clusters or in a cluster The Fruit is as big as a Pullets Egg of a round form and in colour yellow It has a thick Skin or Rind and the inside is full of small black Seeds mixt among the Fruit It is sharp pleasant Fruit The red Penguin is of the bigness and colour of a small dry Onion and is in shape much like a Ninepin for it grows not on a Stalk or Stem as the other but one end on the ground the other standing up∣right Sixty or seventy grow thus together as close as they can stand one by another and all from the same Root or cluster of Roots These Penguins are encompass'd or fenced with long Leaves about a Foot and an half or two Foot long and prickly like the former and the Fruit too is much alike They are both wholsome and never offend the Stomach but those that eat many will find a heat or tickling in their Fundament They grow so plentifully in the Bay of  Campeachy  that there is no passing for their high prickly Leaves  There are some Guanoes on these Islands but no other sort of Land Animal The Bays about the Islands are sometimes visited with Seals and this was the first place where I had seen any of these Animals on the North side of the Equator in these  Seas For the Fish on this sandy Coast lye most in the Lagunes or Saltlakes and Mouths of Rivers but the Seals come not so much there as I judge For this being no rocky Coast where Fish resort most there seems to be but little Food for the Seals unless they will venture upon Catfish  Capt  Swan  went away from hence with Men in our Canoas to the Northward to seek for the River  Coolecan  possibly the same with the River of  Pastla  which some Maps lay down in the Province or Region of  Cullacan  This River lieth in about d N lat We were informed that there is a fair rich  Spanish  Town seated on the Eastside of it with Savannahs about it full of Bulls and Cows and that the Inhabitants of this Town pass over in Boats to the Island  California  where they fish for Pearl I have been told since by a  Spaniard  that said he had been at the Island  California  that there are great plenty of Pearl Oysters there and that the Native  Indians  of  California  near the Pearlfishery are mortal Enemies to the  Spaniards  Our Canoas were absent or Days and said they had been above leagues but found no River that the Land by the Sea was low and all sandy Bay but such a great Sea that there was no landing They met us in their return in the lat d m coasting along shore after them towards  Cullacan  so we returned again to the Eastward This was the farthest that I was to the N on this Coast  Six or seven leagues N N W from the Isles of  Cha∣metly  there is a small narrow entrance into a Lake which runs about leagues Easterly parallel with the shore making many small low Mangrove Islands The Mouth of this Lake is in lat about d m It is called by the  Spaniards Rio de Sall  for it is a salt Lake There is Water enough for Boats and Canoas to enter and smooth landing af∣ter you are in On the Westside of it there is an  House and an Estantion or Farm of large Cattle Our Men went into the Lake and landed and coming to the House found or Bushels of Maiz but the Cattle were driven away by the  Spaniards  yet there our Men took the Owner of the Estantion and brought him aboard He said that the Beefs were driven a great way in the Country for fear we should kill them While we lay here Capt  Swan  went into this Lake again and landed Men on the N E side and marched into the Country About a Mile from the Landingplace as they were entring a dry  Salina  or Saltpond they fired at two  Indians  that cross'd the way before them one of them being wounded in the Thigh fell down and being examined he told our Men that there was an  Indian  Town or leagues off and that the way which they were going would bring them thither While they were in Discourse with the  Indian  they were attack'd by  Spanish  Horsemen who came with a design to scare them back but wanted both Arms and Hearts to do it  Our Men past on from hence and in their way marched through a Savannah of long dry Grass This the  Spaniards  set on fire thinking to burn them but that did not hinder our Men from marching forward though it did trouble them a little They rambled for want of Guides all this Day and part of the next before they came to the Town the  Indian  spoke of There they found a com∣pany of  Spaniards  and  Indians  who made head against them but were driven out of the Town after a short Dispute Here our Surgeon and one Man more were wounded with Arrows but none of the rest were hurt When they came into the Town they found two or three  Indians  wounded who told them that the Name of the Town was  Massaclan  that there were a few  Spaniards  living in it and the rest were  Indians  that five Leagues from this Town  there were two rich Gold Mines where the  Spaniards  of  Compostella  which is the chiefest Town in these parts kept many Slaves and  Indians  at Work for Gold Here our Men lay that Night and the next Morning packt up all the Maiz that they could find and brought it on their backs to the Canoas and came aboard  We lay here till the d of  February  and then Captain  Swan  went away with about Men to the River  Rosario  where they landed and marched to an  Indian  Town of the same Name They found it about Mile from the Sea the way to it fair and even This was a fine little Town of about or Houses with a fair Church and it was chiefly inhabited with  Indians  they took Prisoners there which told them That the River  Rosario  is rich in Gold and that the Mines are not above two Leagues from the Town Captain  Swan  did not think it convenient to go to the Mines but made haste aboard with the Maiz which he took there to the quantity of about or Bushels and which to us in the scarcity we were in of Provisions was at that time more valuable than all the Gold in the World and had he gone to the Mines the  Spaniards  would probably have destroyed the Corn before his return The d of  February  we went with our Ships also towards the River  Rosario  and Anchored the next Day against the Rivers mouth fathom good ouzy ground a League from the shoar This River is in lat d m N When you are at an Anchor against this River you will see a round Hill like a Sugarloaf a little way within Land right over the River and bearing N E by N To the Westward of that Hill there is another pretty long Hill called by the  Spaniards Caput Cavalli  or the Horse's head  The th day Captain  Swan  came a board with the Maiz which he got This was but a small quantity for so many Men as we were especially considering  the place we were in being strangers and having no Pilots to direct or guide us into any River and we being without all sort of Provision but what we were forced to get in this manner from the shoar And though our PilotBook directed us well enough to find the Rivers yet for want of Guides to carry us to the Settlements we were forced to search or Days before we could find a place to land for as I have said before besides the Seas being too rough for landing in many places they have neither Boat Bark nor Canoa that we could ever see or hear of and therefore as there are no such land∣ing places in these Rivers as there are in the  North Seas  so when we were landed we did not know which way to go to any Town except we acciden∣tally met with a path Indeed the  Spaniards  and  Indians  whom we had aboard knew the Names of several Rivers and Towns near them and knew the Towns when they saw them but they knew not the way to go to them from the Sea  The th day Captain  Swan  sent about Men to seek for the River  Oleta  which is to the East∣ward of the River  Rosario  The next day we fol∣lowed after with the Ships having the Wind at W N W and fair weather In the Afternoon our Canoas came again to us for they could not find the River  Oleta  therefore we designed next for the River  St Jago  to the Eastward still The th day in the Evening we Anchored against the mouth of the River in fathom Water good soft ouzy ground and about two Mile from the shoar There was a high white Rock without us called  Maxentelbo  This Rock at a distance appears like a Ship under sail it bore from us W N W distant about Leagues The Hill  Zelisco  bore S E which is a very high Hill in the Country with a Saddle or bending on the top The River  St Jago  is in lat d m It is one of the principal Rivers on  this Coast there is Foot Water on the Bar at low Water but how much it flows here I know not The mouth of this River is near half a Mile broad and very smooth entring Within the mouth it is broader for there are three or four Ri∣vers more meet there and issue all out together is fresh Water is brackish a great way up yet there the Water is to be had by digging or making Wells in the sandy Bay two or three Foot deep just at the mouth of the River  The th Day Captain  Swan  sent Men in four Canoas into this River to seek a Town for al∣though we had no intelligence of any yet the Country appearing very promising we did not question but they would find Inhabitants before they returned They spent two Days in rowing up and down the Creeks and Rivers at last they came to a large Field of Maiz which was almost ripe they immediately fell to gathering as fast as they could and intended to lade the Canoas but seeing an  Indian  that was set to watch the Corn they quitted that troublesome and tedious work and seiz'd him and brought him aboard in hopes by his information to have some more easie and ex∣pedite way of a supply by finding Corn ready cut and dried He being examined said that there was a Town called  Santa Pecaque  four leagues from the place where he was taken and that if we de∣signed to go thither he would undertake to be our Guide Captain  Swan  immediately ordered his Men to make ready and the same Evening went away with Eight Canoas and Men taking the  Indian  for their Guide  He rowed about five Leagues up the River and landed the next Morning The River at this place was not above Pistolshot wide and the Banks pretty high on each side and the Land plain and even He left Men to guard the Canoas and  marcht with the rest to the Town He set out from the Canoas at six a Clock in the Morning and reach'd the Town by The way through which he passed was very plain part of it Woodland part Savannahs The Savannahs were full of Horses Bulls and Cows The  Spaniards  seeing him coming run all away so he entred the Town without the least opposition  This Town of  Santa Pecaque  stands on a Plain in a Savannah by the side of a Wood with many Fruit Trees about it It is but a small Town but very regular after the  Spanish  mode with a Parade in the midst The Houses fronting the Parade had all Balconies there were two Churches one a∣gainst the Parade the other at the end of the Town It is inhabited most with  Spaniards  Their chiefest occupation is Husbandry There are also some Carriers who are imployed by the Merchants of  Compostella  to Trade for them to and from the Mines  Compostella  is a rich Town about leagues from hence It is the chiefest in all this part of the King∣dom and is reported to have white Families which is a great matter in these parts for it may be that such a Town hath not less than Fami∣lies of coppercoloured People besides the white The Silver Mines are about five or six leagues from  Santa Pecaque  where as we were told the Inha∣bitants of  Compostella  had some hundreds of Slaves at Work The Silver here and all over the King∣dom of  Mexico  is said to be finer and richer in pro∣portion than that of  Potosi  or  Peru  tho' the Oar be not so abundant and the Carriers of this Town of  Santa Pecaque  carry the Oar to  Compostella  where it is refined These Carriers or Sutlers also furnish the Slaves at the Mines with Maiz whereof here was great plenty now in the Town designed for that use Here was also Sugar Salt and Saltfish  Captain  Swan  's only business at  Santa Pecaque  was to get Provision therefore he ordered his Men to divide themselves into two parts and by turns carry down the Provision to the Canoas one half remaining in the Town to secure what they had taken while the other half were going and com∣ing In the Afternoon they caught some Horses and the next Morning being the th day Men and some Horses went laden with Maiz to the Canoas They found them and the Men left to guard them in good order though the  Spaniards  had given them a small diversion and wounded one Man but our Men of the Canoas landed and drove them away These that came loaded to the Canoas left Men more there so that now they were Men to guard the Canoas At Night the other returned and the th Day in the Morning that half which staid the Day before at the Town took their turn of going with every Man his bur∣then and Horsesladen Before they returned Captain  Swan  and his other Men at the Town caught a Prisoner who said that there were near a thousand Men of all colours  Spaniards  and  Indians Negroes  and  Mulatto's  in arms at a place called  St Jago  but Leagues off the chief Town on this River that the  Spaniards  were armed with Guns and Pistols and the Coppercoloured with Swords and Lances Captain  Swan  fearing the ill conse∣quence of separating his small Company was re∣solved the next Day to march away with the whole Party and therefore he ordered his Men to catch as many Horses as they could that they might carry the more Provision with them Accordingly the next Day being the th Day of  February  Captain  Swan  called out his Men betimes to be gone but they refused to go and said that they would not leave the Town till all the Provision was in the Canoas Therefore he was forced to  yield to them and suffered half the company to go as before They had now Horses laden which Captain  Swan  ordered to be tied one to another and the Men to go in two bodies before and as many behind but the Men would go at their own rate every Man leading his Horse The  Spaniards  observed their manner of marching and laid an Ambush about a Mile from the Town which they managed with such success that falling on our body of Men who were guarding the Corn to the Canoas they killed them every one Capt  Swan  hearing the report of their Guns ordered his Men who were then in the Town with him to march out to their assistance but some opposed him de∣spising their Enemies till two of the  Spaniards  Horses that had lost their Riders came galloping into the Town in a great fright both bridled and saddled with each a pair of Holsters by their sides and one had a Carbine newly discharged which was an apparent token that our Men had been engaged and that by Men better armed than they imagined they should meet with Therefore Captain  Swan  immediately march'd out of the Town and his Men all followed him and when he came to the place where the Engagement had been he saw all his Men that went out in the Morn∣ing lying dead They were stript and so cut and mangl'd that he scarce knew one Man Captain  Swan  had not more Men then with him than those were who lay dead before him yet the  Spaniards  never came to oppose him but kept at a great di∣stance for 'tis probable the  Spaniards  had not cut off so many Men of ours but with the loss of a great many of their own So he marched down to the Canoas and came aboard the Ship with the Maiz that was already in the Canoas We had a∣bout Men killed and among the rest my Inge∣nious Friend Mr  Ringrose  was one who wrote that  Part of the  History of the Buccaneers  which relates to Captain  Sharp  He was at this time CapeMer∣chant or SuperCargo of Captain  Swan  's Ship He had no mind to this Voyage but was necessitated to engage in it or starve  This loss discouraged us from attempting any thing more hereabouts Therefore Captain  Swan  proposed to go to Cape  St Lucas  on  California  to careen He had two reasons for this First that he thought he could lye there secure from the  Spaniards  and next that if he could get a Commerce with the  Indians  there he might make a discovery in the Lake of  California  and by their Assistance try for some of the Plate of  New Mexico  This Lake of  California  for so the Sea Channel or Streight between that and the Continent is called is but little known to the  Spaniards  by what I could ever learn for their Drafts do not agree about it Some of them do make  California  an Island but give no manner of account of the Tides flowing in the Lake or what depth of Water there is or of the Harbours Rivers or Creeks that border on it Whereas on the West side of the Island towards the  Asiatick  Coast their PilotBook gives an account of the Coast from Cape St  Lucas  to d North Some of their Drafts newly made do make  California  to join to the Main I do believe that the  Spaniards  do not care to have this Lake dis∣covered for fear lest other  European  Nations should get knowledge of it and by that means visit the Mines of  New Mexico  We heard that not long before our arrival here the  Indians  in the Province of  New Mexico  made an Insurrection and destroyed most of the  Spaniards  there but that some of them flying towards the Gulph or Lake of  California  made Canoas in that Lake and got safe away though the  Indians  of the Lake of  California  seem to be at perfect Enmity with the  Spaniards  We had  an old intelligent  Spaniard  now aboard who said that he spoke with a Frier that made his Escape among them  New Mexico  by report of several  English  Prisoners there and  Spaniards  I have met with lieth N W from  Old Mexico  between four and Leagues and the biggest part of the Treasure which is found in this Kingdom is in that Province but without doubt there are plenty of Mines in other parts as well in this part of the Kingdom where we now were as in other places and probably on the Main bordering on the Lake of  California  al∣though not yet discovered by the  Spaniards  who have Mines enough and therefore as yet have no reason to discover more  In my opinion here might be very advantageous Discoveries made by any that would attempt it for the  Spaniards  have more than they can well manage I know they would lie like the  Dog in the Man∣ger  altho' not able to eat themselves yet they would endeavour to hinder others But the Voyage thither being so far I take that to be one reason that hath hindered the Discoveries of these parts yet it is possible that a Man may find a nearer way hither than we came I mean by the North West  I know there have been divers attempts made about a North West Passage and all unsuccessful yet I am of opinion that such a Passage may be found All our Countrymen that have gone to discover the N W Passage have endeavoured to pass to the Westward beginning their search along  Davis  's or  Hudson  's  Bay  But if I was to go on this Discovery I would go first into the  South Seas  bend my course from thence along by  California  and that way seek a Passage back into the  West Seas  For as others have spent the Summer in first searching on this more known side nearer home and so before they got through the time of the  year obliged them to give over their search and provide for a long Course back again for fear of being left in the Winter on the contrary I would search first on the less known Coast of the South Seaside and then as the Year past away I should need no retreat for I should come farther into my knowledge if I succeeded in my attempt and should be without that Dread and Fear which the others must have in passing from the known to the un∣known who for ought I know gave over their search just as they were on the point of accomplish∣ing their Desires  I would take the same Method if I was to go to discover the NorthEast Passage I would winter about  Japan Corea  or the NorthEast part of  Chi∣na  and taking the Spring and Summer before me I would make my first trial on the Coast of  Tar∣tary  wherein if I succeeded I should come into some known Parts and have a great deal of time before me to reach  Archangel  or some other Port Captain  Wood  indeed says this N East Passage is not to be found for Ice but how often do we see that sometimes Designs have been given over as impossible and at another time and by other ways those very things have been accomplished but enough of this  The next day after that fatal Skirmish near  Santa Pecaque  Capt  Swan  ordered all our Water to be filled and to get ready to sail The st day we sailed from hence directing our Course towards  Ca∣lifornia  we had the wind at N W and W N W a small gale with a great Sea out of the West We past by Islands called the  Maria  's After we past these Islands we had much wind at N N W and N W and at N with thick rainy weather We beat till the th day of  February  but it was against a brisk wind and proved labour in vain For we were now within reach of the Land Tradewind  which was opposite to us but would we go to  Cali∣fornia  upon the discovery or otherwise we should bear or Leagues off from the shoar where we should avoid the Landwinds and have the be∣nefit of the true Easterly Tradewind  Finding therefore that we got nothing but ra∣ther lost ground being then d m N we steered away more to the Eastward again for the Islands  Maria  's and the th day we came to an an∣chor at the Eastend of the middle Island in fa∣thom Water good clean Sand  The  Maria  's are three uninhabited Islands in lat d m they are distant from Cape  St Lu∣cas  on  California  leagues bearing East South East and they are distant from Cape  Corrientes  leagues bearing upon the same points of the Com∣pass with Cape  St Lucas  They stretch N W and S E about leagues There are or small high Rocks near them The westermost of them is the biggest Island of the three and they are all three of an indifferent heighth The Soil is stony and dry the Land in most places is covered with a shrubby sort of Wood very thick and trouble∣some to pass through In some places there is plen∣ty of straight large Cedars though speaking of the places where I have found Cedars Chap I for∣got to mention this place The  Spaniards  make mention of them in other places but I speak of those which I have seen All round by the Seaside it is sandy and there is produced a green prickly Plant whose leaves are much like the Penguinleaf and the root like the root of a  Sempervive  but much larger This root being bak'd in an Oven is good to eat and the  Indians  on  California  as I have been informed have great part of their subsistence from these Roots We made an Oven in a sandy Bank and baked of these Roots and I eat of them but none of us greatly cared for them They taste ex∣actly  like the Roots of our  English  Burdock boil'd of which I have eaten Here are plenty of Gua∣noes and Raccoons a large sort of Rat and  Indian  Conies and abundance of large Pigeons and TurtleDoves The Sea is also pretty well stored with Fish and Turtle or Tortoise and Seal This is the se∣cond place on this Coast where I did see any Seal and this place helps to confirm what I have obser∣ved that they are seldom seen but where there is plenty of Fish Captain  Swan  gave the middle Island the Name of  Prince George's Island  The th Day we run nearer the Island and ancho∣red in five fathom and moored Head and Stern and unrigg'd both Ship and Bark in order to Careen Here Capt  Swan  proposed to go into the  EastIndies  Many were well pleased with the Voyage but some thought such was their Ignorance that he would carry them out of the World for about two thirds of our Men did not think there was any such way to be found but at last he gained their Consents  At our first coming hither we did eat nothing but Seal but after the first or Days our Strikers brought aboard Turtle every Day on which we fed all the time that we lay here and saved our Maiz for our Voyage Here also we measured all our Maiz and found we had about Bushels This we divided into three parts one for the Bark and two for the Ship our Men were divided also Men aboard the Ship and aboard the Bark besides three or four Slaves in each  I had been a long time sick of a Dropsie a Di∣stemper whereof as I said before many of our Men died so here I was laid and covered all but my Head in the hot Sand I indured it near half an Hour and then was taken out and laid to Sweat in a Tent I did sweat exceedingly while I was in the Sand and I do believe it did me much good for I grew well soon after  VVe staid here till the th Day and then both Vessels being clean we sailed to the Valley of  Balderas  to VVater for we could not do it here now In the wet Season indeed here is VVater enough for the Brooks then run down plentifully but now though there was VVater yet it was bad filling it being a great way to fetch it from the holes where it lodged The th Day we anchored in the bottom of the Bay in the Valley of  Balderas  right against the River where we watered before but this River was brackish now in the dry season and therefore we went or Leagues nearer Cape  Corrientes  and anchored by a small round Island not half a Mile from the Shoar The Island is about four Leagues to the Northward of the Cape and the Brook where we filled our VVater is just within the Island upon the Main Here our Strikers struck or  Jewfish  some we did eat and the rest we salted and the th Day we fill'd Tuns of very good VVater  Having thus provided our selves we had nothing more to do but to put in execution our intended Expedition to the  EastIndies  in hopes of some better success there than we had met with on this little frequented Coast VVe came on it full of ex∣pectations for besides the richness of the Coun∣try and the probability of finding some SeaPorts worth visiting we perswaded our selves that there must needs be Shipping and Trade here and that  Acapulca  and  La Vera Cruz  were to the Kingdom of  Mexico  what  Panama  and  Portobel  are to that of  Pe∣ru viz  Marts for carrying on a constant Commerce between the South and North Seas as indeed they are But whereas we expected that this Commerce should be managed by Sea we found our selves mistaken that of  Mexico  being almost wholly a Landtrade and managed more by Mules than by Ships so that instead of profit we met with little  on this Coast besides fatigues hardships and losses and so were the more easily induced to try what better fortune we might have in the  EastIndies  But to do right to Captain  Swan  he had no in∣tention to be as a Privateer in the  EastIndies  but as he hath often assured me with his own Mouth he resolved to take the first opportunity of return∣ing to  England  So that he feigned a compliance with some of his Men who were bent upon going to cruise at  Manila  that he might have leisure to take some favourable opportunity of quitting the Privateer Trade  CHAP X  Their Departure from Cape  Corrientes  for the  Ladrone  Islands and the  EastIndies  Their Course thither and Accidents by the way with a Table of each days Run  c  Of

length of our Voyage from hence to  Guam  one of the  Ladrone  Islands which is the first place that we could to  ch at and there also being not certain to find Provisions most of our Men were almost daunted at the thoughts of it for we had not days Provision at a little more than half a pint of Maiz a day for each Man and no other Provision except Meals of salted  Jewfish  and we had a great many Rars aboard which we could not hinder from eating part of our Maiz Beside the great distance between Cape  Corrientes  and  Guam  which is variously set down The  Spa∣niards  who have the greatest reason to know best make it to be between and Leagues our Books also reckon it differently between and degrees which all comes short indeed of Leagues but even that was a Voyage enough to frighten us considering our scanty Provisions Captain  Swan  to encourage his Men to go with him perswaded them that the  English  Books did give the best account of the distance his Reasons were many although but weak He urged among the rest that Sir  Thomas Candish  and Sir  Francis Drake  did run it in less than Days and that he did not question but that our Ships were better sailers than those which were built in that Age and that he did not doubt to get there in little more than Days This being the best time in the Year for breezes which undoubtedly is the reason that the  Spaniards  set out from  Acapulco  about this time and that although they are Days in their Voyage it is because they are great Ships deep laden and very heavy sailers besides they wanting nothing are in no great haste in their way but sail with a great deal of their usual Caution And when they come near the Island  Guam  they lie by in the Night for a Week before they make Land In prudence we also should have contrived to lie by in the Night when we came near Land for other∣wise we might have run ashoar or have outsailed the Islands and lost sight of them before Morning But our bold Adventures seldom proceed with such wariness when in any straights  But of all Captain  Swan  's Arguments that which prevailed most with them was his promising them as I have said to cruise off the  Manila  's So he and his Men being now agreed and they incouraged with the hope of gain which works its way thro' all Difficulties we set out from Cape  Corrientes March  the st We were Ships in Company  Captain  Swan  's Ship and a Bark commanded un∣der Captain  Swan  by Captain  Teat  and we were Men aboard of the Ship and aboard the Bark beside Slaves as I said  We had a small Landwind at E N E which carried us or Leagues then the Seawind came at W N W a fresh gale so we steered away S W By a Clock in the Evening we were about leagues S W from the Cape then we met a Landwind which blew fresh all Night and the next Morning about a Clock we had the Seabreez at N N E so that at Noon we were leagues from the Cape It blew a fresh gale of Wind which carried us off into the true Tradewind of the difference of which Tradewinds I shall speak in the Chapter of Winds in the Appendix for although the con∣stant Seabreez near the Shoar is at W N W yet the true Trade off at Sea when you are clear of the Landwinds is at E N E At first we had it at N N E so it came about Northerly and then to the East as we run off At leagues distance from the Shoar we had it at E N E and there it stood till we came within leagues of  Guam  When we had eaten up our Meals of salted  Jew∣fish  in so many Days time we had nothing but our small allowance of Maiz  After the st Day of  March  we made great runs every Day having very fair clear Weather and a fresh Trade wind which we made use of with all our Sails and we made many good  Observations  of the Sun At our first setting out we steer'd into the lat of degrees which is near the lat of  Guam  then we steered West keeping in that lat By that time we had sailed Days our Men see∣ing we made such great runs and the Wind like to continue repined because they were kept at such short allowance Captain  Swan  endeavoured to perswade them to have a little Patience yet  nothing but an augmentation of their daily allow∣ance would appease them Captain  Swan  though with much reluctance gave way to a small en∣largement of our Commons for now we had not above spoonfuls of boil'd Maiz a Man once a day whereas before we had  I do believe that this short allowance did me a great deal of good though others were weakened by it for I found that my Strength encreased and my Dropsie wore off Yet I drank times every Hours but many of our Men did not drink in or days time and some not in days one of our Men did not drink in days time and said he was not adry when he did drink yet he made water every day more or less One of our Men in the midst of these hardships was found guilty of theft and condemned for the same to have  blows from each Man in the Ship with a inch and a half rope on his bare back Captain  Swan  began first and struck with a good will whose example was followed by all of us  It was very strange that in all this Voyage we did not see one Fish not so much as a FlyingFish nor any sort of Fowl but at one time when we were by my account miles West from Cape  Corrientes  then we saw a great number of Boobies which we supposed came from some Rocks not far from us which were mentioned in some of our SeaCarts but we did not see them  After we had run the Leagues by our reck∣oning which made the  English  account to  Guam  the Men began to murmur against Captain  Swan  for perswading them to come this Voyage but he gave them fair words and told them that the  Spa∣nish  account might probably be the truest and see∣ing the Gale was likely to continue a short time longer would end our troubles  map of the East Indies  A Map of the EAST INDIES  As we drew nigh the Island we met with some small Rain and the Clouds settling in the West were an apparent token that we were not far from Land for in these Climates betwixt or near the Tropicks where the Tradewind blows constantly the Clouds which fly swift over head yet seem near the Limb of the Horizon to hang without much motion or alteration where the Land is near I have often taken notice of it especially if it is high Land for you shall then have the Clouds hang about it without any visible motion  The th day of  May  our Bark being about Leagues ahead of our Ship sailed over a rocky Shole on which there was but fathom water and abundance of Fish swimming about the Rocks They imagin'd by this that the Land was not far off so they clap'd on a Wind with the Barks Head to the North and being past the Shole lay by for us When we came up with them Captain  Teat  came aboard us and related what he had seen We were then in lat d m steering West The Island  Guam  is laid down in Lat d N by the  Spaniards  who are Masters of it keeping it as a baitingplace as they go to the  Philippine  Islands Therefore we clap'd on a Wind and stood to Northward being somewhat troubled and doubtful whe∣ther we were right because there is no Shole laid down in the  Spanish  Drafts about the Island  Guam  At a Clock to our great Joy we saw the Island  Guam  at about Leagues distance  It was well for Captain  Swan  that we got sight of it before our Provision was spent of which we had but enough for days more for as I was af∣terwards informed the Men had contrived first to kill Captain  Swan  and eat him when the Victuals was gone and after him all of us who were acces∣sary in promoting the undertaking this Voyage This made Captain  Swan  say to me after our ar∣arrival  at  Guam Ah  Dampier  you would have made them but a poor Meal  for I was as lean as the Captain was lusty and fleshy The Wind was at E N E and the Land bore at N N E therefore we stood to the Northward till we brought the Island to bear East and then we turned to get in to an anchor  The account I have given hitherto of our Course from Cape  Corrientes  in the Kingdom of  Mexico  for I have mentioned another Cape of that name in  Peru  South of the Bay of  Panama  to  Guam  one of the  Ladrone  Islands hath been in the gross But for the satisfaction of those who may think it

Summ of all the Westings  Making Deg of Longitude in all d m  Now the Island  Guam  bore N N E Leagues dist this gives m to my Lat and takes from my Meridian dist so that the Island is in Lat and the Merid dist from  Corrientes  miles which reduced into degrees makes d m  The Table consists of Columns The first is of the days of the Month The d Column con∣tains each days course or the point of the Compass we ran upon The d gives the distance or length of such course in  Italian  or Geometrical miles at the rate of to a degree or the Progress the Ship makes every day and is reckoned always from noon to noon But because the Course is not al∣ways made upon the same Rumb in a direct line therefore the th and th Columns shew how ma∣ny miles we ran to the South every day and how many to the West which last was our main run in this Voyage By the th of  April  we were got pretty near into the latitude of  Guam  and our Course then lying along that parallel our Northing and Southing consequently were but little accord∣ing as the Ship deviated from its direct Course and such deviation is thenceforward exprest by N or S in the th Column and the Ships keeping straight on the West Rumb by that is to say no North∣ing or Southing The th Column shews the lat we were in every day where R signifies the  dead Reckoning  by the running of the Logs and Ob shews the lat by observation The th Column shews the Wind and Weather  To these I would have added an th Column to shew the variation of the Needle but as it was very small in this Course so neither did we make any ob∣servation of it above once after we were set out from the  Mexican  Coast At our departure from Cape  Corrientes  we found it to be d m Easterly and the observation we made of it afterwards when we had gone about a third of the Voyage  shewed it to be so near the same to be decreasing Neither did we observe it at  Guam  for Captain  Swan  who had the Instruments in his Cabbin did not seem much to regard it Yet I am inclined to think that at  Guam  the Variation might be either none at all or even increasing to the Westward  To conclude  May  th at Noon when we begin to call it st we were in lat d m N by R having run since the Noon before Miles direct∣ly West We continued the same Course till Two that Afternoon for which I allow ten Miles more West still and then finding the parallel we ran up∣on to be too much Southerly we clapt on a Wind and sailed directly North till Five in the Afternoon having in that time run Miles and increased our latitude so many Minutes making it d m We then saw the Island  Guam  bearing N N E di∣stant from us about leagues which gives the latitude of the Island d m And according to the account foregoing its longitude is d m West from the Cape  Corrientes  on the Coast of  Mexico  allowing and  Italian  Miles to a degree in these latitudes at the common rate of Miles to a degree of the Equator as before computed  As a Corollary from hence it will follow that upon a supposal of the truth of the general al∣lowance Seamen make of  Italian  Miles to an Equinoctial degree that the South Sea must be of a greater breadth by degrees than it's commonly reckoned by Hydrographers who make it only about more or less For since we found as I shall have occasion to say the distance from  Guam  to the Eastern parts of  Asia  to be much the same with the common reckoning it follows by way of necessary consequence from hence that the degrees of longitude or thereabouts which are un∣derreckoned in the distance between  America  and the  EastIndies  Westward are overreckoned  in the breadth of  Asia  and  Africk  the  Atlantick  Sea or the  American  Continent or all together and so that Tract of the Terraqueous Globe must be so much shortned And for a further confirmation of the fact I shall add that as to the  Aethiopick  or  Indian  Sea its breadth must be considerably less than 'tis generally calculated to be if it be true what I have heard over and over from several able Seamen whom I have conversed with in these parts that Ships sailing from the  Cape of Good Hope  to  New Holland  as many Ships bound to  Java  or thereabouts keep that latitude find themselves there and sometimes to their cost running aground when they have thought themselves to be a great way off and 'tis from hence possibly that the  Dutch  call that part of this Coast the Land of  Indraught  as if it magnetically drew Ships too fast to it and give cautions to avoid it But I rather think 'tis the nearness of the Land than any Whirlpool or the like that surprizes them As to the breadth of the  Atlantick  Sea I am from good hands assured that it is overreckoned by six seven eight or ten de∣grees for besides the concurrent Accounts of seve∣ral experienced Men who have confirmed the same to me Mr  Canby  particularly who hath sailed as a Mate in a great many Voyages from Cape  Lopez  on the Coast of  Guinea  to  Barbadoes  and is much esteem'd as a very sensible Man hath often told me that he constantly found the distance to be between and degrees whereas 'tis laid down in and degrees in the common draughts  As to the supposition it self which our Seamen make in the allowing but Miles to a Degree I am not ignorant how much this hath been canvased of late Years especially and that the prevailing opi∣nion hath been that about or upwards should be allowed But till I can see some better grounds  for the exactness of those trials that have been made on Land by Mr  Norwood  and others con∣sidering the inequality of the Earths surface as well as the obliquity of the way in their allow∣ing for which I am somewhat doubtful of their measures Upon the whole matter I cannot but adhere to the general Seacalculation confirmed as to the main by daily experience till some more certain estimate shall be made than those hither∣to attempted For we find our selves when we sail North or South to be brought to our intended place in a time agreeable enough with what we expect upon the usual supposition making all rea∣sonable allowance for the little unavoidable devi∣ations East or West and there seems no reason why the same estimate should not serve us in cros∣sing the Meridians which we find so true in Sailing under them As to this course of ours to  Guam  particularly we should rather increase than shorten our estimate of the length of it considering that the Easterly Wind and Current being so strong and bearing therefore our Log after us as is usual in such cases should we therefore in casting up the run of the Log make allowance for so much space as the Log it self drove after us which is common∣ly or Miles in in so brisk a gale as this was we must have reckoned more than degrees but in this Voyage we made no such allowance though it be usual to do it so that how much so∣ever this computation of mine exceeds the common Draughts yet is it of the shortest according to our experiment and calculation  But to proceed with our Voyage The Island  Guam  or  Guahon  as the Native  Indians  pronounce it is one of the  Ladrone  Islands belongs to the  Spaniards  who have a small Fort with six Guns in it with a Governour and or Soldiers They keep it for the relief and refreshment of their  Phi∣lippine  Ships that touch here in their way from  Acapulco  to  Manila  but the Winds will not so easily let them take this way back again The  Spaniards  of late have named  Guam  the Island  Maria  it is about leagues long and broad lying N and S It is pretty high Champain Land  The st day of  May  at a Clock in the Evening we anchored near the middle of the Island  Guam  on the West side a Mile from the shore At a distance it appears flat and even but coming near it you will find it stands shelving and the East side which is much the highest is fenced with steep Rocks that oppose the Violence of the Sea which continually rage against it being driven with the constant Tradewind and on that side there is no Anchoring The West side is pretty low and full of small sandy Bays divided with as many rocky Points The Soil of the Island is reddish dry and indifferent fruitful The Fruits are chiefly Rice PineApples Watermelons Muskmelons Oranges and Limes Coconuts and a sort of Fruit called by us Breadfruit  The Coconut Trees grow by the Sea on the Western side in great Groves or Miles in length and a Mile or two broad This Tree is in shape like the Cabbagetree and at a distance they are not to be known each from other only the Coconut Tree is fuller of Branches but the Cabbagetree generally is much higher tho' the Coconut Trees in some places are very high  The Nut or Fruit grows at the head of the Tree among the Branches and in Clusters or in a Cluster The Branch to which they grow is about the bigness of a Man's Arm and as long running small towards the end It is of a yellow Colour full of Knots and very tough The Nut is gene∣rally bigger than a Man's Head The outer Rind is near two Inches thick before you come to the Shell  the Shell it self is black thick and very hard The Kernel in some Nuts is near an Inch thick sticking to the inside of the Shell clear round leaving a hol∣low in the middle of it which contains about a Pint more or less according to the bigness of the Nut for some are much bigger than others  This Cavity is full of sweet delicate wholsom and resreshing Water While the Nut is growing all the inside is full of this Water without any Kernel at all but as the Nut grows towards its Maturity the Kernel begins to gather and settle round on the inside of the Shell and is soft like Cream and as the Nut ripens it increaseth in substance and becomes hard The ripe Kernel is sweet enough but very hard to digest therefore seldom eaten unless by Strangers who know not the effects of it but while it is young and soft like Pap some Men will eat it scraping it out with a Spoon after they have drunk the Water that was within it I like the Water best when the Nut is almost ripe for it is then sweetest and briskest  When these Nuts are ripe and gathered the out∣side Rind becomes of a brown rusty colour so that one would think that they were dead and dry yet they will sprout out like Onions after they have been hanging in the Sun or Months or thrown about in a House or Ship and if planted afterward in the Earth they will grow up to a Tree Before they thus sprout out there is a small spungy round knob grows in the inside which we call an Apple This at first is no bigger than the top of ones finger but increaseth daily sucking up the Water till it is grown so big as to fill up the Cavity of the Coconut and then it be∣gins to sprout forth By this time the Nut that was hard begins to grow oily and soft thereby giving passage to the Sprout that springs from the  Apple which Nature hath so contrived that it points to the hole in the Shell of which there are three till it grows ripe just where it's fastned by its Stalk to the Tree but one of these holes remains open even when it is ripe through which it creeps and spreads forth its Branches You may let these teem∣ing Nuts sprout out a foot and half or two foot high before you plant them for they will grow a great while like an Onion out of their own Sub∣stance  Beside the Liquor or Water in the Fruit there is also a sort of Wine drawn from the Tree called Toddy which looks like Whey It is sweet and very pleasant but it is to be drunk within hours after it is drawn for afterwards it grows sowre Those that have a great many Trees draw a Spirit from the sowre Wine called Arack Arack is di∣still'd also from Rice and other things in the  East Indies  but none is so much esteemed for ma∣king Punch as this sort made of Toddy or the sap of the Coconut Tree for it makes most deli∣cate Punch but it must have a dash of Brandy to hearten it because this Arack is not strong enough to make good Punch of it self This sort of Li∣quor is chiefly used about  Goa  and therefore it has the Name of  Goa  Arack The way of drawing the Toddy from the Tree is by cutting the top of a Branch that would bear Nuts but before it has any Fruit and from thence the Liquor which was to feed its Fruit distils into the hole of a Cal∣labash that is hung upon it  This Branch continues running almost as long as the Fruit would have been growing and then it dries away The Tree hath usually three fruitful Branches which if they be all tapp'd thus then the Tree bears no Fruit that Year but if one or two only be tapp'd the other will bear Fruit all the while The Liquor which is thus drawn is emptied out of the  Callabash duly Morning and Evening so long as it continues running and is sold every Morning and Evening in most Towns in the  East Indies  and great gains are produced from it even this way but those that distil it and make Arack reap the greatest profit There is also great profit made of the Fruit both of the Nut and the Shell  The Kernel is much used in making Broath When the Nut is dry they take off the Husk and giving two good Blows on the middle of the Nut it breaks in two equal parts letting the Water fall on the Ground then with a small Iron Rasp made for the purpose the Kernel or Nut is rasped out clean which being put into a little fresh Water makes it become white as Milk In this milky Water they boil a Fowl or any other sort of Flesh and it makes very savory Broath  English  Seamen put this Water into boiled Rice which they eat instead of Rice∣milk carrying Nuts purposely to Sea with them This they learn from the Natives  But the greatest use of the Kernel is to make Oyl both for burning and for frying The way to make the Oyl is to grate or rasp the Kernel and steep it in fresh Water then boil it and scum off the Oyl at top as it rises But the Nuts that make the Oyl ought to be a long time gathered so as that the Ker∣nel may be turning soft and oily  The Shell of this Nut is used in the  East Indies  for Cups Dishes Ladles Spoons and in a manner for all eating and drinking Vessels Well shaped Nuts are often brought home to  Europe  and much esteem∣ed The Husk of the Shell is of great use to make Cables for the dry Husk is full of small Strings and Threads which being beaten become soft and the other Substance which was mixt among it falls a∣way like Sawdust leaving only the Strings These are afterwards spun into long Yarns and twisted up into Balls for Convenience and many of these  RopeYarns joined together make good Cables This Manufactory is chiefly used at the  MaldiveIslands  and the Threads sent in Balls into all places that Trade thither purposely for to make Cables I made a Cable at  Achin  with some of it These are called  Coire  Cables they will last very well But there is another sort of  Coire  Cables as they are called that are black and more strong and lasting and are made of Strings that grow like Horsehair at the heads of certain Trees almost like the Coco∣nut Tree This sort comes most from the Island  Ti∣mor  In the South Seas the  Spaniards  do make Oa∣kam to chalk their Ships with the Husk of the Coconut which is more serviceable than that made of Hemp and they say it will never rot I have been told by Captain  Knox  who wrote the Relation of  Cey∣lon  that in some places of  India  they make a sort of course Cloth of the Husk of the Coconut which is used for Sails I my self have seen a sort of course Sailcloth made of such a kind of substance but whether the same or no I know not  I have been the longer on this subject to give the Reader a particular Account of the use and profit of a Vegetable which is possibly of all others the most generally serviceable to the conveniencies as well as the necessities of humane Life Yet this Tree that is of such great use and esteemed so much in the  East Indies  is scarce regarded in the  West Indies  for want of the knowledge of the bene∣fit which it may produce And 'tis partly for the sake of my Countrymen in our  American  Planta∣tions that I have spoken so largely of it For the hot Climates there are a very proper soil for it and indeed it is so hardy both in the raising it and when grown that it will thrive as well in dry san∣dy ground as in rich land I have found them grow∣ing very well in low sandy Islands on the West of  Sumatra  that are overflowed with the Sea every  Springtide and though the Nuts there are not very big yet this is no loss for the Kernel is thick and sweet and the Milk or Water in the inside is more pleasant and sweet than of the Nuts that grow in rich ground which are commonly large indeed but not very sweet These at  Guam  grow in dry ground are of a middle size and I think the sweetest that I did ever taste Thus much for the Coconut  The Lime is a sort of bastard or Crab Limon The Tree or Bush that bears it is prickly like a Thorn growing full of small boughs In  Jamaica  and other places they make of the Lime Bush Fences about Gardens or any other Inclosure by planting the seeds close together which growing up thick spread abroad and make a very good Hedge The Fruit is like a Limon but a smaller the rind thin and the inclosed substance full of Juice The Juice is very tart yet of a pleasant taste sweetned with Sugar It is chiefly used for making Punch both in the  East  and  West Indies  as well ashoar as at Sea and much of it is for that pur∣pose yearly brought home to  England  from out  West India  Plantations It is also used for a particu∣lar kind of Sauce which is called PepperSauce and is made of Codpepper commonly call'd  Guineapepper  boiled in Water and then pickled with Salt and mix'd with Limejuice to preserve it Limes grow plentiful in the  East  and  West Indies  within the Tropicks  The Breadfruit as we call it grows on a large Tree as big and high as our largest AppleTrees It hath a spreading Head full of Branches and dark Leaves The Fruit grows on the Boughs like Ap∣ples it is as big as a Pennyloaf when Wheat is at five Shillings the Bushel It is of a round shape and hath a thick t  ugh rind When the Fruit is ripe it is yellow and soft and the taste is sweet  and pleasant The Natives of this Island use it for Bread they gather it when full grown while it is green and hard then they bake it in an Oven which scorcheth the rind and makes it black but they scrape off the outside black crust and there remains a tender thin crust and the inside is soft tender and white like the crumb of a Penny Loaf There is neither Seed nor Stone in the inside but all is of a pure substance like Bread it must be eaten new for if it is kept above hours it be∣comes dry and eats harsh and choaky but 'tis ve∣ry pleasant before it is too stale This Fruit lasts in season Months in the Year during which time the Natives eat no other sort of food of Breadkind I did never see of this Fruit any where but here The Natives told us that there is plenty of this Fruit growing on the rest of the  Ladrone  Islands and I did never hear of any of it any where else  They have here some Rice also but the Island being of a dry Soil and therefore not very proper for it they do not sow very much Fish is scarce about this Island yet on the shole that our Bark came over there was great plenty and the Natives commonly go thither to fish  The Natives of this Island are strong bodied large limb'd and wellshap'd They are Coppercoloured like other  Indians  their Hair is black and long their Eyes meanly proportioned they have pretty high Noses their Lips are pretty full and their Teeth indifferent white They are long visaged and stern of Countenance yet we found them to be affable and Courteous They are many of them troubled with a kind of a Leprosie This distemper is very common at  Mindanao  therefore I shallspeak more of it in my next Chapter They of  Guam  are otherwise very healthy especially in the dry season but in the wet season which comes in in  June  and holds till  October  the Air is more  thick and unwholsome which occasions Fevers but the Rains are not violent nor lasting For the Island lies so far Westerly from the  Philippine  Islands or any other Land that the Westerly Winds do sel∣dom blow so far and when they do they do not last long but the Easterly Winds do constantly blow here which are dry and healthy and this Island is found to be very healthful as we were informed while we lay by it The Natives are ve∣ry ingenious beyond any People in making Boats or Proes as they are called in the  East Indies  and therein they take great delight These are built sharp at both ends the bottom is of one piece made like the bottom of a little Canoa very neatly dug and left of a good substance This bottom part is instead of a Keel It is about or foot long the under part of this Keel is made round but inclining to a wedge and smooth and the upper part is almost flat having a very gentle hollow and is about a foot broad From hence both sides of the Boat are carried up to about foot high with nar∣row Plank not above or inches broad and each end of the Boat turns up round very pretti∣ly But what is very singular one side of the Boat is made perpendicular like a Wall while the o∣ther side is rounding made as other Vessels are with a pretty full belly Just in the middle it is about or foot broad aloft or more according to the length of the Boat The Mast stands exactly in the middle with a long Yard that  up and down like a Mizenyard One end of it reacheth down to the end or head of the Boat where it is placed in a notch that is made there purposely to receive it and keep it fast The other end hangs over the Stern To this Yard the Sail is fastened At the foot of the Sail there is another small Yard to keep the Sail out square and to roll up the Sail on when it blows hard for it serves instead of a  Reef to take up the Sail to what degree they please according to the strength of the Wind Along the Bellyside of the Boat parallel with it at about or foot distance lies another small Boat or Ca∣noa being a Log of very light Wood almost as long as the great Boat but not so wide being not above a foot and an half wide at the upper part and very sharp like a Wedge at each end And there are two Bamboas of about or foot long and as big as ones Leg placed over the great Boats side one near each end of it and reaching about or foot from the side of the Boat By the help of which the little Boat is made firm and conti∣guous to the other These are generally called by the  Dutch  and by the  English  from them  Out∣layers  The use of them is to keep the great Boat upright from oversetting because the Wind here being in a manner constantly East or if it were at West it would be the same thing and the Range of these Islands where their business lies to and fro being mostly North and South they turn the flat side of the Boat against the Wind upon which they sail and the Bellyside consequently with its little Boat is upon the Lee And the Vessel having a Head at each end so as to sail with either of them foremost indifferently they need not tack or go about as all our Vessels do but each end of the Boat serves either for Head or Stern as they please When they ply to Windward and are minded to go about he that Steers bears away a little from the Wind by which means the Stern comes to the Wind which is now become the Head only by shifting the end of the Yard This Boat is steered with a broad Paddle instead of a Rudder I have been the more particular in describing these Boats because I do believe they Sail the best of any Boats in the World I did here for my own satis∣faction try the swistness of one of them sailing  by our Log we had Knots on our Reel and she run it all out before the half MinuteGlass was half out which if it had been no more is after the rate of Mile an Hour but I do believe she would have run Mile an Hour It was very pleasant to see the little Boat running a long so swift by the others side  The Native  Indians  are no less dextrous in ma∣naging than in building these Boats By report they will go from hence to another of the  Ladrone  Islands about Leagues off and there do their Business and return again in less than Hours I was told that one of these Boats was sent Express to  Manila  which is above Leagues and performed the Voyage in Days time There are of these Proes or Boats used in many places of the  East Indies  but with a Belly and a little Boat on each side Only at  Mindanao  I saw one like these with the Belly and a little Boat only on one side and the other flat but not so neatly built  The  Indians  of  Guam  have neat little Houses very handsomly thatch'd with Palmetothatch They in¦habit together in Villages built by the Sea on the Westside and have  Spanish  Priests to instruct them in the Christian Religion  The  Spaniards  have a small Fort on the West side near the South end with six Guns in it There is a Governour and or  Spanish  Soldiers There are no more Spaniards on this Island beside or Priests Not long before we arrived here the Na∣tives rose on the  Spaniards  to destroy them and did kill many But the Governour with his Soldiers at length prevailed and drove them out of the Fort So when they found themselves disappoint∣ed of their intent they destroyed the Plantations and Stock and then went away to other Islands There were then or  Indians  on this Island but now there are not above for all that were  in this Conspiracy went away As for these who yet remain if they were not actually concerned in that broil yet their Hearts also are bent against the  Spaniards  for they offered to carry us to the Fort and assist us in the Conquest of the Island but C  Swan  was not for molesting the  Spaniards  here  Before we came to an Anchor here one of the Priests came aboard in the Night with  Indians  They first haled us to know from whence we came and what we were To whom answer was made in  Spanish  that we were  Spaniards  and that we came from  Acapulco  It being dark they could not see the make of our Ship nor very well discern what we were Therefore we came aboard but perceiving the mistake they were in in taking us for a  Spanish  Ship they endeavoured to get from us again but we held their Boat fast and made them  ome in Capt  Swan  received the Priest with much Civility and conducting him into the Great Cabbin declared That the reason of our coming to this Island was want of Provison and that he came not in any hostile manner but as a Friend to purchase with his Mo∣ney what he wanted And therefore desired the Priest to write a Letter to the Governour to inform him what we were and on what account we came For having him now aboard the Captain was willing to detain him as an Hostage till we had Provision The  Padre  told Captain  Swan  that Provision was now scarce on the Island but he would engage that the Governour would do his utmost to furnish us  In the Morning the  Indians  in whose Boat or Proe the Frier came aboard were sent to the Go∣vernour with two Letters one from the Frier and another very obliging one from Captain  Swan  and a Present of four Yards of Scarletcloath and a piece of broad Silver and Gold Lace The Governour lives near the South end of the Island on the West  side which was about Leagues from the place where we were therefore we did not expect an answer till the Evening not knowing then how nimble they were Therefore when the  Indian  Canoa was dispatched away to the Governour we hoised out of our Canoas and sent one a fishing and the other ashore for Coconuts Our fishing Canoa got nothing but the Men that went ashore for Coconuts came off laden  About a Clock that same Morning the Go∣vernour of the Island sent a Letter to Capt  Swan  complimenting him for his Present and promising to support us with as much Provision as he could possibly spare and as a Token of his Gratitude he sent a Present of Hogs of a small sort most ex∣cellent Meat the best I think that ever I eat They are fed with Coconuts and their Flesh is hard as Brisket Beef They were doubtless of that breed in  America  which came originally from  Spain  He sent also Muskmelons larger than ours in  Eng∣land  and as many Watermelons both sorts here being a very excellent Fruit and sent an order to the  Indians  that lived in a Village not far from our Ship to bake every day as much of the Breadfruit as we did desire and to assist us in getting as many dry Coconuts as we would have which they ac∣cordingly did and brought off the BreadFruit eve∣ry day hot as much as we could eat After this the Governour sent every day a Canoa or two with Hogs and Fruit and desired for the same Powder Shot and Arms which was sent according to his Request We had a delicate large  English  Dog which the Governour did desire and had it given him very freely by the Captain though much a∣gainst the grain of many of his Men who had a great value for that Dog Captain  Swan  endea∣voured to get this Governour's Letter of Recom∣mendation to some Merchants at  Manila  for he  had then a design to go to Fort  St George  and from thence intended to trade to  Manila  but this his de∣sign was concealed from the company While we lay here the  Acapulco  Ship arrived in sight of the Island but did not come in the sight of us for the Governour sent an  Indian  Proe with advice of our being here Therefore she stood off to the South∣ward of the Island and coming foul of the same shole that our Bark had run over before was in great danger of being lost there for she struck off her Rudder and with much ado got clear but not till after three days labour For tho' the shole be so near the Island and the  Indians  go off and fish there every day yet the Master of the  Acapulco  Ship who should one would think know these Parts was utterly ignorant of it This their striking on the shole we heard afterward when we were on the Coast of  Manila  but these  Indians  of  Guam  did speak of her being in sight of the Island while we lay there which put our Men in a great heat to go out after her but Captain  Swan  perswaded them out of that humour for he was now wholly averse to any Hostile action  The th day of  May  the Governor sent his last Present which was some Hogs a Jar of pickled Mangoes a Jar of excellent pickled Fish and a Jar of fine Rusk or Bread of fine Wheat Flower ba∣ked like Bisket but not so hard He sent besides or packs of Rice desiring to be excused from sending any more Provision to us saying he had no more on the Island that he could spare He sent word also that the West Monsoon was at hand that therefore it behoved us to be jogging from hence unless we were resolved to return back to  America  again Captain  Swan  returned him thanks for his kindness and advice and took his leave and the same day sent the Frier ashoar that was seized on at our first arrival and gave him a large  Brass Clock an Astrolable and a large Telescope for which Present the Frier sent us aboard six Hogs and a Roasting Pig or Bushels of Potatoes and pound of  Manila  Tobacco Then we prepared to be gone being pretty well furnished with Provision to carry us to  Mindanao  where we designed next to touch We took aboard us as many Coconuts as we could well stow and we had a good stock of Rice and about Hogs in Salt  CHAP XI  They resolve to go to  Mindanao  Their depar∣tare from  Guam  Of the  Philippine  Islands The Isle  Luconia  and its chief Town and Port  Manilo Manila  or  Manilbo  Of the rich Trade we might establish with these Islands  St John  's Island They arrive at  Mindanao  The Island described Its Fertility The  Lib∣by  Trees and the  Sago  made of them The Plantain Tree Fruit Liquor and Cloath A smaller Plantain at  Mindanao  The Bonano Of the Clove bark Cloves and Nutmegs and the Methods taken by the  Dutch  to Monopo∣lize the Spices The BetelNut and ArekTree The  Durian  and the JacaTree and Fruit The Beasts of  Mindanao Centapees  or  Forty Legs  a venemous Insect and others Their Fowls Fish  c  The temperature of the Climate with the Course of the Winds Tornadoes Rain and temper of the Air throughout the Year  WHile we lay at  Guam  we took up a Reso∣lution of going to  Mindanao  one of the  Philippine  Islands being told by the Frier and others that it was exceedingly well stored with Provisi∣ons that the Natives were  Mahometans  and that they had formerly a Commerce with the  Spaniards  but that now they were at Wars with them This Island was therefore thought to be a convenient place for us to go to for besides that it was in our  way to the  East Indies  which we had resolved to visit and that the Westerly  Monsoon  was at hand which would oblige us to shelter somewhere in a short time and that we could not expect good Harbours in a better place than in so large an Island as  Mindanao  besides all this I say the Inhabitants of  Mindanao  being then as we were told tho' falsly at Wars with the  Spaniards  our Men who it should seem were very squeamish of plundering without Licence derived hopes from thence of getting a Commission there from the Prince of the Island to plunder the  Spanish  Ships about  Manila  and so to make  Mindanao  their common Rendezvous And it Captain  Swan  was minded to go to an  En∣glish  Port yet his Men who thought he intended to leave them hoped to get Vessels and Pilots at  Mindanao  fit for their turn to cruize on the Coast of  Manila  As for Captain  Swan  he was willing enough to go thither as best suiting his own de∣sign and therefore this Voyage was concluded on by general consent  Accordingly  June  d we left  Guam  bound for  Mindanao  We had fair Weather and a pretty smart gale of Wind at East for or Days and then it shifted to the S W being Rainy but it soon came about again to the East and blew a gentle gale yet it often shuffled about to the S E For though in the  East Indies  the Winds shift in  April  yet we found this to be the shifting season for the Winds here the other shifting season being in  October  sooner or later all over  India  As to our course from  Guam  to the  Philippine  Islands we found it as I intimated before agreeable enough with the account of our common Draughts  The st Day of  June  we arrived at the Island  St John  which is one of the  Philippine  Islands The  Philippines  are a great company of large Islands ta∣king up about deg of Lat in length reaching  near upon from d of North Lat to the th de∣gree and in breadth about deg of Longitude They derive this Name from  Philip  II King of  Spain  and even now they do most of them belong to that Crown  The chiefest Island in this range is  Luconia  which lies on the North of them all At this Island  Magellan  died on the Voyage that he was making round the World For after he had past those Streights be∣tween the South end of  America  and  Terra del Fuego  which now bear his Name and had ranged down in the  South Seas  on the back of  America  from thence stretching over to the  EastIndies  he fell in with the  Ladrone  Islands and from thence steering East still he fell in with these  Philippine  Islands and anchored at  Luconia  where he warr'd with the Native  Indians  to bring them in Obedience to his Master the King of  Spain  and was by them kill'd with a Poy∣soned Arrow It is now wholly under the  Spani∣ards  who have several Towns there The chief is  Manilo  which is a large Seaport Town near the S E end opposite to the Island  Mindora  It is a place of great Strength and Trade The two great  Acapulco  Ships before mentioned fetching from hence all sorts of  EastIndia  Commodities which are brought hither by Foreigners especially by the  Chinese  and the  Portuguese  Sometimes the  English  Merchants of Fort  St George  send their Ships hither as it were by stealth under the charge of  Portu∣guese  Pilots and Mariners For as yet we cannot get the  Spaniards  there to a Commerce with us or the  Dutch  although they have but few Ships of their own This seems to arise from a Jealousie or Fear of discovering the Riches of these Islands for most if not all the  Philippine  Islands are rich in Gold And the  Spaniards  have no place of much strength in all these Islands that I could ever hear of besides  Manilo  it self Yet they have Villages  and Towns on several of the Islands and Padres or Priests to instruct the Native  Indians  from whom they get their Gold  The  Spanish  Inhabitants of the smaller Islands especially would willingly trade with us if the Go∣vernment was not so severe against it for they have no Goods but what are brought from  Manilo  at an extraordinary dear rate I am of the Opini∣on That if any of our Nations would seek a Trade with them they would not lose their labour for the  Spaniards  can and will Smuggle as our Seamen call Trading by stealth as well as any Nation that I know and our  Jamaicans  are to their profit sen∣sible enough of it And I have been informed that Captain  Goodlud  of  London  in a Voyage which he made from  Mindanao  to  China  touch'd at some of these Islands and was civilly treated by the  Spa∣niards  who bought some of his Commodities giv∣ing him a very good Price for the same  There are about or more large Islands ly∣ing to the Southward of  Luconia  most of which as I said before are inhabited by the  Spaniards  Be∣sides these there are an infinite number of small Islands of no account and even the great Islands many of them are without Names or at least so variously set down that I find the same Islands named by divers Names  The Island St  John  and  Mindanao  are the Sou∣thermost of all these Islands and are the only Islands in all this Range that are not subject to the  Spaniards  St  John  's Island is on the Eastside of the  Min∣danao  and distant from it or Leagues It is in lat about or North This Island is in length about Leagues stretching N N W and S S E and it is in breadth about Leagues in the middle of the Island The Northermost end is broader and the Southermost is narrower This Island is of a  good heighth and is full of many small Hills The Land at the SouthEast end where I was ashoar is of a black fat Mould and the whole Island seems to partake of the same fatness by the vast number of large Trees that it produceth for it looks all over like one great Grove  As we were passing by the S E end we saw a Canoa of the Natives under the shoar therefore one of our Canoas went after to have spoken with her but she run away from us seeing themselves chaced put their Canoa ashoar leaving her fled into the Woods nor would be allured to come to us altho' we did what we could to entice them be∣sides these Men we saw no more here nor sign of any Inhabitants at this end  When we came aboard our Ship again we steered away for the Island  Mindanao  which was now fair in sight of us it being about leagues distant from this part of St  John  's The d day we came within a league of the Eastside of the Island  Min∣danao  and having the Wind at S E we steered toward the Northend keeping on the Eastside till we came into the lat of d m and there we anchored in a small Bay about a Mile from the Shoar in Fathom Water Rocky foul ground  Some of our Books gave us an account That  Mindanao  City and Isle lies in d m we guest that the middle of the Island might lie in this lat but we were at a great loss where to find the City whether on the East or West side Indeed had it been a small Island lying open to the Eastern Wind we might probably have searched first on the Westside for commonly the Islands within the Tropicks or within the bounds of the TradeWinds have their Harbours on the Westside as best sheltered but the Island  Mindanao  being guarded on the Eastside by St  John  's Island we might as rea∣sonably expect to find the Harbour and City on  this side as any where else but coming into the Lat in which we judg'd the City might be found no Canoas or People that might give us any um∣brage of a City or place of Trade near at hand tho' we coasted within a League of the Shoar  The Island  Mindanao  is the biggest of all the  Phi∣lippine  Islands except  Luconia  It is about Leagues long and or broad The South end is in about d N and the N W end reacheth almost to d N It is a very Mountainous Island full of Hills and Valleys The Mould in general is deep and black and extraordinary fat and fruitful The sides of the Hills are stony yet productive enough of very large tall Trees In the heart of the Coun∣try there are some Mountains that yield good Gold The Valleys are well moistned with plea∣sant Brooks and small Rivers of delicate Water and have Trees of divers sorts flourishing and green all the Year The Trees in general are very large and most of them are of kinds unknown to us  There is one sort which deserves particular no∣tice called by the Natives  LibbyTrees  These grow wild in great Groves of or Miles long by the sides of the Rivers Of these Trees Sago is made which the poor Country People eat instead of Bread or Months in the Year This Tree for its body and shape is much like the PalmetoTree or the CabbageTree but not so tall as the latter The Bark and Wood is hard and thin like a Shell and full of white Pith like the Pith of an Elder This Tree they cut down and split it in the mid∣dle and scrape out all the Pith which they beat Iustily with a Wooden Pestle in a great Mortar or Trough and then put it into a Cloth or Strainer held over a Trough and pouring Water in among the Pith they stir it about in the Cloth So the Water carries all the substance of the Pith through the Cloth down into the Trough leaving nothing in  the Cloth but a light sort of Husk which they throw away but that which falls into the Trough settles in a short time to the bottom like Mud and then they draw off the Water and take up the muddy substance wherewith they make Cakes which being baked proves very good Bread  The  Mindanao  People live or Months of the Year on this Food for their Bread kind The Na∣tive  Indians  of  Teranate  and  Tidore  and all the  Spice Islands  have plenty of these Trees and use them for Food in the same manner as I have been in∣form'd by Mr  Caril Rofy  who is now Commander of one of the King's Ships He was one of our Company at this time and being left with Captain  Swan  at  Mindanao  went afterwards to  Teranate  and lived there among the  Dutch  a Year or two The Sago which is transported into other parts of the  East Indies  is dried in small pieces like little Seeds or Comfits and commonly eaten with Milk of Almonds by those that are troubled with the Flux for it is a great binder and very good in that Distemper  In some places of  Mindanao  there is plenty of Rice but in the hilly Land they plant Yams Po∣tatoes and Pumkins all which thrive very well The other Fruits of this Island are WaterMelons MuskMelons Plaintains Bonanoes Guavas Nut∣megs Cloves BetelNuts Durians Jacks or Jacas CocoNuts Oranges  c  The Plantain I take to be the King of all Fruit not except the Coco it self The Tree that bears this Fruit is about Foot or Foot and an half round and about or Foot high These Trees are not raised from Seed for they seem not to have any but from the Roots of other old Trees If these young suckers are taken out of the Ground and planted in another place it will be Months be∣fore they bear but if let stand in their own native  Soil they will bear in Months As soon as the Fruit is ripe the Tree decays but then there are many young ones growing up to supply its place When this Tree first springs out of the Ground it comes up with two Leaves and by that time it is a Foot high two more springs up in the inside of them and in a short time after two more within them and so on By that time the Tree is a Month old you may perceive a small body almost as big as ones Arm and then there are eight or ten Leaves some of them four or five Foot high The first Leaves that it shoots forth are not above a Foot long and half a Foot broad and the Stem that bears them no big∣ger than ones Finger but as the Tree grows higher the Leaves are larger As the young Leaves spring up up in the inside so the old Leaves spread off and their tops droop downward being of a greater length and breadth by how much they are nearer the Root and at last decay and rot off but still there are young Leaves spring up out of the top which makes the Tree look always green and flourishing When the Tree is full grown the Leaves are or Foot long and a Foot and half broad towards the end they are smaller and end with a round point The Stem of the Leaf is as big as a Man's Arm almost round and about a Foot in length between the Leaf and the Body of the Tree That part of the Stem which comes from the Tree if it be the outside Leaf seems to inclose half the Body as it were with a thick Hide and right against it on the other side of the Tree is another such answering to it The next two Leaves in the inside of these grow opposite to each other in the same manner but so that if the two outward grow North and South these grow East and West and those still within them keep the same order Thus the Body of this Tree seems to be made up of many thick Skins growing one over another and when it is full grown there  springs out of the top a strong Stem harder in sub∣stance than any other part of the Body This Stem shoots forth at the Heart of the Tree is as big as a Man's Arm and as long and the Fruit grows in clusters round it first blossoming and then shooting forth the Fruit It is so excellent that the  Spaniards  give it the preheminence of all other Fruit as most conducing to Life It grows in a Cod about or Inches long and as big as a Man's Arm The Shell Rind or Cod is soft and of a yellow colour when ripe It resembles in shape a Hogsgut Pudding The inclosed Fruit is no harder than Butter in Winter and is much of the colour of the purest yellow But∣ter It is of a delicate taste and melts in ones Mouth like Marmalet It is all pure Pulp without any Seed Kernel or Stone This Fruit is so much esteemed by all  Europeans  that settle in  America  that when they make a new Plantation they commonly begin with a good Plantainwalk as they call it or a Field of Plantains and as their Family encreaseth so they augment the Plantainwalk keeping one Man pur∣posely to prune the Trees and gather the Fruit as he sees convenient For the Trees continue bearing some or other most part of the Year and this is many times the whole Food on which a whole Family subsists They thrive only in rich fat ground for poor sandy will nor bear them The  Spaniards  in their Towns in  America  as at  Havana Cartagena Portabel  c have their Markets full of Plantains it being the common Food for poor People Their common price is half a Riol or  d  a Dozen When this Fruit is only used for Bread it is roasted or boil'd when it's just full grown but not yet ripe or turn'd yellow Poor People or Negroes that have neither Fish nor Flesh to eat with it make Sauce with Codpepper Salt and Limejuice which makes it eat very savory much better than a crust of Bread alone Sometimes for  a change they eat a roasted Plantain and a ripe raw Plantain together which is instead of Bread and Butter They eat very pleasant so and I have made many a good meal in this manner Some∣times our  English  take or ripe Plantains and mashing them together make them into a lump and boil them instead of a Bagpudding which they call a BuffJacket and this is a very good way for a change This Fruit makes also very good Tarts and the green Plantains slic'd thin and dried in the Sun and grated will make a sort of Flour which is very good to make Puddings A ripe Plantain slic'd and dried in the Sun may be preserved a great while and then eats like Figs very sweet and pleasant The  Darien Indians  pre∣serve them a long time by drying them gently over the Fire mashing them first and moulding them into lumps The  Moskito Indians  will take a ripe Plantain and roast it then take a pint and half of Water in a Calabash and squeeze the Plantain in pieces with their Hands mixing it with the Water then they drink it all off together This they call  Mishlaw  and it's pleasant and sweet and nou∣rishing somewhat like Lambswool as 'tis call'd made with Apples and Ale and of this Fruit alone many thousands of  Indian  Families in the  WestIndies  have their whole subsistence When they make Drink with them they take or ripe Plantains and mash them well in a Trough then they put Gallons of Water among them and this in Hours time will ferment and froth like Wort In Hours it is fit to Drink and then they Bottle it and Drink it as they have occasion but this will not keep above or Hours Those therefore that use this Drink Brew it in this manner every Morning When I went first to  Jamaica  I could relish no other Drink they had there It drinks brisk and cool and is very pleasant This Drink is windy and so is the Fruit eaten raw but  boil'd or roasted it is not so If this Drink is kept above Hours it grows sharp but if then it be put out into the Sun it will become very good Vine∣gar This Fruit grows all over the  WestIndies  in the proper Climates at  Guinea  and in the  EastIndies  As the Fruit of this Tree is of great use for Food so is the Body no less serviceable to make Cloaths but this I never knew till I came to this Island The ordinary People of  Mindanao  do wear no other Cloth The Tree never bearing but once and so being fell'd when the Fruit is ripe they cut it down close by the Ground if they intend to make Cloth with it One blow with a Hachet or long Knife will strike it asunder then they cut off the top leaving the trunk or foot long stripping off the outer Rind which is thickest towards the lower end having stript or of these Rinds the Trunk becomes in a manner all of one bigness and of a whitish colour Then they split the Trunk in the middle which being done they split the two halves again as near the middle as they can This they leave in the Sun or Days in which time part of the juicy substance of the Tree dries away and then the ends will appear full of small Threads The Women whose employment it is to make the Cloth take hold of those Threads one by one which rend away easily from one end of the Trunk to the other in bigness like whited brownthread for the threads are naturally of a determi∣nate bigness as I observed their Cloth to be all of one substance and equal fineness but 'tis stubborn when new wears out soon and when wet feels a little slimy They make their pieces or Yards long their Warp and Woof all one thickness and substance  There is another sort of Plantains in that Island which are shorter and less than the others which I never saw any where but here These are full  of black Seeds mixt quite through the Fruit They are binding and are much eaten by those that have Fluxes The Country People gave them us for that use and with good success  The  Bonano  Tree is exactly like the Plantain for shape and bigness nor easily distinguishable from it but by its Fruit which is a great deal smaller and not above half so long as a Plantain being also more mellow and soft less luscious yet of a more delicate taste They use this for the making Drink oftner than Plantains and it is best when used for Drink or eaten as Fruit but it is not so good for Bread nor doth it eat well at all when roasted or boil'd so 'tis only necessity that makes any use it this way They grow generally where Plantains do being set intermixt with them purposely in their Plantainwalks They have plenty of Clovebark of which I saw a Ship load and as for Cloves  Raja Laut  whom I shall have occasion to mention told me that if the  English  would settle there they could order Matters so in a little time as to send a Shipload of Cloves from thence every Year I have been informed that they grow on the Boughs of a Tree about as big as a Plumbtree but I ne∣ver happened to see any of them  I have not seen the Nutmegtrees any where but the Nutmegs this Island produces are sair and large yet they have no great store of them being unwil∣ling to propagate them or the Cloves for fear that should invite the  Dutch  to visit them and bring them into subjection as they have done the rest of the neighbouring Islands where they grow For the  Dutch  being seated among the SpiceIslands have monopolized all the Trade into their own Hands and will not suffer any of the Natives to dispose of it but to themselves alone Nay they are so careful to preserve it in their own Hands that they will not suffer the Spice to grow in the  uninhabited Islands but send Soldiers to cut the Trees down Captain  Rofy  told me that while he lived with the  Dutch  he was sent with other Men to cut down the SpiceTrees and that he himself did at several times cut down or Trees Yet altho' the  Dutch  take such care to destroy them there are many uninhabited Islands that have great plenty of SpiceTrees as I have been informed by  Dutch  Men that have been there particularly by a Cap∣tain of a  Dutch  Ship that I met with at  Achin  who told me that near the Island  Banda  there is an Island where the Cloves falling from the Trees do lie and rot on the ground and they are at the time when the Fruit falls or Inches thick under the Trees He and some others told me that it would not be a hard matter for an  English  Vessel to pur∣chase a Ships Cargo of Spice of the Natives of some of these SpiceIslands  He was a free Merchant that told me this For by that name the  Dutch  and  English  in the  EastIn∣dies  distinguish those Merchants who are not Ser∣vants to the Company The free Merchants are not suffered to Trade to the SpiceIslands nor to many other places where the  Dutch  have Factories but on the other Hand they are suffered to Trade to some places where the  Dutch  Company them∣selves may not Trade as to  Achin  particularly for there are some Princes in the  Indies  who will not Trade with the Company for fear of them The Seamen that go to the SpiceIslands are obliged to bring no Spice from thence for themselves except a small matter for their own use about a pound or two Yet the Masters of those Ships do common∣ly so order their business that they often secure a good quantity and send it ashoar to some place near  Batavia  before they come into that Harbour for it is always brought thither first before it's sent to  Europe  and if they meet any Vessel at Sea that  will buy their Cloves they will sell or Tuns out of and yet seemingly carry their Comple∣ment to  Batavia  for they will pour Water among the remaining part of their Cargo which will swell them to that degree that the Ships Hold will be as full again as it was before any were sold This Trick they use whenever they dispose of any clan∣destinely for the Cloves when they first take them in are extraordinary dry and so will imbibe a great deal of Moisture This is but one Instance of many hundreds of little deceitful Arts the  Dutch  SeaMen have in these Parts among them of which I have both seen and heard several I believe there are no where greater Thieves and nothing will persuade them to discover one another for should any do it the rest would certainly knock him on the Head But to return to the Products of  Min∣danao  The BetelNut is much esteemed here as it is in most places of the  East Indies  The BetelTree grows like the CabbageTree but it is not so big nor so high The Body grows strait about or foot high without Leaf or Branch except at the Head There it spreads forth long Bran∣ches like other Trees of the like nature as the CabbageTree the CocoNut Tree and the Palm These Branches are about or foot long and their stems near the head of the Tree as big as a Man's Arm On the top of the Tree among the Branches the BetelNut grows on a tough stem as big as a Man's Finger in clusters much as the CocoNuts do and they grow or in a cluster This Fruit is bigger than a Nutmeg and is much like it but rounder It is much used all over the  EastIndies  Their way is to cut it in four pieces and wrap one of them up in an Arek leaf which they spread with a soft Paste made of Lime or Plaster and then chew it altogether  Every Man in these parts carries his LimeBox by his side and dipping his Finger into it spreads his Betel and Arek leaf with it The Arek is a small Tree or Shrub of a green Bark and the Leaf is long and broader than a Willow They are packt up to sell into Parts that have them not to chew with the Betel The BetelNut is most esteem'd when it is young and before it grows hard and then they cut it only in two pieces with the green Husk or Shell on it It is then exceeding juicy and therefore makes them spit much It tastes rough in the Mouth and dies the Lips red and makes the Teeth black but it preserves them and cleanseth the Gums It is also accounted very wholsom for the Stomach but sometimes it will cause great giddiness in the Head of those that are not us'd to chew it But this is the effect only of the old Nut for the young Nuts will not do it I speak of my own Experience  This Island produceth also Durians and Jacks The Trees that bear the Durians are as big as Ap∣ple Trees full of Boughs The Rind is thick and rough the Fruit is so large that they grow only about the Bodies or on the Limbs near the Body like the Cacao The Fruit is about the bigness of a large Pumkin covered with a thick green rough Rind When it is ripe the Rind begins to turn yellow but it is not fit to eat till it opens at the top Then the Fruit in the inside is ripe and sends forth an excellent Scent When the Rind is opened the Fruit may be split into four quarters each quarter hath several small Cells that inclose a certain quantity of the Fruit according to the bigness of the Cell for some are larger than others The largest of the Fruit may be as big as a Pullets Egg 'Tis as white as Milk and as soft as Cream and the Taste very delicious to those that are ac∣customed to them but those who have not been  used to eat them will dislike them at first because they smell like roasted Onions This Fruit must be eaten in its prime for there is no eating of it before it is ripe and even then 'twill not keep a∣bove a day or two before it putrifies and turns black or of a dark colour and then it is not good Within the Fruit there is a Stone as big as a small Bean which hath a thin Shell over it Those that are minded to eat the Stones or Nuts roast them and then a thin Shell comes off which incloses the Nut and it eats like a Chesnut  The Jack or Jaca is much like the Durian both in bigness and shape The Trees that bear them also are much a like and so is their manner of the Fruits growing But the inside is different for the Fruit of the Durian is white that of the Jack is yellow and fuller of Stones The Durian is most esteemed yet the Jack is very pleasant Fruit and the Stones or Kernels are good roasted  There are many other sorts of Grain Roots and Fruits in this Island which to give a particular de∣scription of would fill up a large Volume  In this Island are also many sorts of Beasts both wild and tame as Horses Bulls and Cows Buf∣faloes Goats Wild Hogs Deer Monkies Gua∣no's Lizards Snakes  c  I never saw or heard of any Beasts of Prey here as in many other places The Hogs are ugly Creatures they have all great Knobs growing over their Eyes and there are mul∣titudes of them in the Woods They are com∣monly very poor yet sweet Deer are here very plentiful in some places where they are not di¦sturbed  Of the venemous kind of Creatures here are Scor∣pions whose sting is in their Tail and Centapees call'd by the  English  Legs both which are also com∣mon in the  WestIndies  in  Jamaica  and elsewhere These Centapees are or Inches long as big as  a GooseQuill but flattish of a Dun or reddish co∣lour on the Back but Belly whitish and full of Legs on each side the Belly Their Sting or bite is more raging than the Scorpion They lie in old Houses and dry Timber There are several sorts of Snakes some very Poisonous There is another sort of Creature like a Guano both in colour and shape but four times as big whose Tongue is like a small Harpoon having two beards like the beards of a Fishook They are said to be very venemous but I know not their Names I have seen them in other places also as at  Pulo Condore  or the Island  Condore  and at  Achin  and have been told that they are in the Bay of  Bengal  The Fowls of this Country are Ducks and Hens Other tame Fowl I have not seen nor heard of any The wild Fowl are Pidgeons Parrots Parakits Turtle Doves and abundance of small Fowls There are Bats as big as a Kite  There are a great many Harbours Creeks and good Bays for Ships to ride in and Rivers navi∣gable for Canoas Proes or Barks which are all plentifully stored with Fish of divers sorts so is al∣so the adjacent Sea The chiefest Fish are Bonetas Snooks Cavally's Bremes Mullets Pounders  c  Here are also plenty of Sea Turtle and small Manatee which are not near so big as those in the  WestIndies  The biggest that I saw would not weigh above Pound but the flesh both of the Turtle and Manatee are very sweet  The Weather at  Mindanao  is temperate enough as to heat for all it lies so near the Equator and especially on the borders near the Sea There they commonly enjoy the breezes by day and cooling Land Winds at Night The Winds are Easterly one part of the Year and Westerly the other The Easterly Winds begin to blow in  October  and it is the middle of  November  before they are settled  These Winds bring fair Weather The Westerly Winds begin to blow in  May  but are not settled till a Month afterwards The West Winds always bring Rain Tornadoes and very Tempestuous Weather At the first coming in of these Winds they blow but faintly but then the Tornadoes rise one in a Day sometimes two These are Thundershowers which commonly come against the Wind bringing with them a contrary Wind to what did blow before After the Tornadoes are over the Wind shifts about again and the Sky be∣comes clear yet then in the Valleys and the sides of the Mountains there riseth a thick fog which covers the Land The Tornadoes continue thus for a Week or more then they come thicker two or three in a Day bringing violent gusts of Wind and terrible claps of Thunder At last they come so fast that the Wind remains in the quarter from whence these Tornadoes do rise which is out of the West and there it settles till  October  or  Novem∣ber  When these Westward Winds are thus settled the Sky is all in mourning being covered with black Clouds pouring down excessive Rains some times mixt with Thunder and Lightning that no∣thing can be more dismal The Winds raging to that degree that the biggest Trees are torn up by the Roots and the Rivers swell and overflow their Banks and drown the low Land carrying great Trees into the Sea Thus it continues some∣times a week together before the Sun or Stars appear The fiercest of this Weather is in the latter end of  July  and in  August  for then the Towns seem to stand in a great Pond and they go from one House to another in Canoas At this time the Water carries away all the filth and nastiness from under their Houses Whilst this tempestuous season lasts the Weather is Cold and Chilly In  September  the Wea∣ther is more moderate and the Winds are not so  fierce nor the Rain so violent The Air thence∣forward begins to be more clear and delightsome but then in the morning there are thick Fogs con∣tinuing till or a Clock before the Sun shines out especially when it has rained in the Night In  October  the Easterly Winds begin to blow again and bring fair Weather till  April  Thus much concern∣ing the natural state of  Mindanao  CHAP XII  Of the Inhabitants and Civil State of the Isle of  Mindanao  The  Mindanayans Hilanoones Sologues  and  Alfoorees  Of the  Minda∣nayans  properly so called Their Manners and Habits The Habits and Manners of their Women A Comical Custom at  Minda∣nao  Their Houses their Diet and Wash∣ings The Languages spoken there and Trans∣actions with the  Spaniards  Their fear of the  Dutch  and seeming desire of the  English  Their Handycrafts and peculiar sort of Smiths Bellows Their Shipping Commodi∣ties and Trade The  Mindanao  and  Ma∣nila  Tobacco A sort of Leprosie there and other Distempers Their Marriages The  Sultan  of  Mindano  his Poverty Power Family  c  The Proes or Boats here  Ra∣ja Laut  the General Brother to the  Sultan  and his Family Their way of Fighting Their Religion  Raja Laut  's Devotion A Clock or Drum in their Mosques Of their  Cir∣cumcision  and the Solemnity then used Of other their Religious Observations and Supersti∣tions Their abhorrence of Swines Flesh  c  THis Island is not subject to one Prince nei∣ther is the Language one and the same but the People are much alike in colour strength and stature They are all or most of them of  one Religion which is Mahometanism and their customs and manner of living are alike The  Mindanao  People more particularly so called are the greatest Nation in the Island and trading by Sea with other Nations they are therefore the more civil I shall say but little of the rest being less known to me but so much as hath come to my knowledge take as follows There are besides the  Mindanayans  the  Hilanoones  as they call them or the  Mountaneers  the  Sologues  and  Alsoores  The  Hilanoones  live in the heart of the Country They have little or no commerce by Sea yet they have Proe's that row with or Oars apiece They enjoy the benefit of the Gold Mines and with their Gold buy forreign Commodities of the  Mindanao  People They have also plenty of BeesWax which they exchange for other Commodi∣ties  The  Sologues  inhabit the N W end of the Island They are the least Nation of all they Trade to  Manila  in Proes and to some of the Neighbouring Islands but have no Commerce with the  Mindanao  People  The  Alsoores  are the same with the  Mindanayans  and were formerly under the subjection of the Sultan of  Mindanao  but were divided between the Sultan's Children and have of late had a Sultan of their own but having by Marriage contracted an alliance with the Sultan of  Mindanao  this has oc∣casioned that Prince to claim them again as his Subjects and he made War with them a little after we went away as I afterwards understood  The  Mindanayans  properly so called are Men of mean statures small Limbs straight Bodies and little Heads Their Faces are oval their Fore∣heads flat with black small Eyes short low No∣ses pretty large Mouths their Lips thin and red their Teeth black yet very sound their Hair  black and straight the colour of their Skin taw∣ney but inclining to a brighter yellow than some other  Indians  especially the Women They have a Custom to wear their Thumbnails very long especially that on their left Thumb for they do never cut it but scrape it often They are indued with good natural Wits are ingenious nimble and active when they are minded but generally very lazy and thievish and will not work except forced by Hunger This laziness is natural to most  Indi∣ans  but these People's laziness seems rather to pro∣ceed not so much from their natural Inclinations as from the severity of their Prince of whom they stand in awe For he dealing with them very ar∣bitrarily and taking from them what they get this damps their Industry so they never strive to have any thing but from Hand to Mouth They are generally proud and walk very stately They are civil enough to Strangers and will easily be acquainted with them and entertain them with great freedom but they are implacable to their Enemies and very revengeful if they are injured frequently poisoning secretly those that have af∣fronted them  They wear but few Cloaths their Heads are circled with a short Turbat fringed or laced at both ends it goes once about the Head and is tied in a knot the laced ends hanging down They wear Frocks and Breeches but no Stockings nor Shooes  The Women are fairer than the Men and their Hair is black and long which they tie in a knot that hangs back in their Poles They are more round visaged than the Men and generally well featured only their Noses are very small and so low between their Eyes that in some of the Fe∣male Children the rising that should be between the Eyes is scarce discernable neither is there any  sensible rising in their Foreheads At a distance they appear very well but being nigh these Im∣pediments are very obvious They have very small Limbs They wear but two Garments a Frock and a sort of Petticoat the Petticoat is only a piece of Cloth sowed both ends together but it is made two Foot too big for their Wastes so that they may wear either end uppermost that part that comes up to their Wastes because it is so much to big they gather it in their Hands and twist it till it sits close to their Wastes tucking in the twisted part between their Waste and the edge of the Petticoat which keeps it close The Frock sits loose about them and reaches down a little below the Waste The Sleeves are a great deal longer than their Arms and so small at the end that their Hands will scarce go through Being on the Sleeve sits in folds about the wrist wherein they take great pride  The better sort of People have their Garments made of long Cloth but the ordinary sort wear Cloth made of Plantaintree which they call  Saggen  by which Name they call the Plantain They have neither Stocking or Shooe and the VVomen have very small Feet  The VVomen are very desirous of the company of Strangers especially of VVhite Men and doubt∣less would be very familiar if the Custom of the Country did not debar them from that freedom which seems coveted by them Yet from the high∣est to the lowest they are allowed liberty to con∣verse with or treat Strangers in the fight of their Husbands  There is a kind of begging Custom at  Mindanao  that I have not met elsewhere with in all my Tra∣vels and which I believe is owing to the little Trade they have which is thus VVhen Strangers arrive here the  Mindanao  Men will come aboard  and invite them to their Houses and inquire who has a  Comrade  which word I believe they have from the  Spaniards  or a  Pagally  and who has not A  Comrade  is a familiar Malefriend a  Pa∣gally  is an Innocent Platonick Friend of the other Sex All Strangers are in a manner oblig'd to ac∣cept of this Acquaintance and Familiarity which must be first purchased with a small Present and afterwards confirmed with some Gift or other to continue the Acquaintance and as often as the Stranger goes ashore he is welcome to his  Comrade  or  Pagally  's House where he may be entertained for his Money to Eat Drink or Sleep and com∣plimented as often as he comes ashore with To∣bacco and BetelNut which is all the Entertain∣ment he must expect  gratis  The richest Mens Wives are allow'd the freedom to converse with her  Pagally  in publick and may give or receive Presents from him Even the Sultans and the Generals Wives who are always coopt up will yet look out of their Cages when a Stranger passeth by and de∣mand of him if he wants a  Pagally  and to invite him to their Friendship will send a Present of To∣bacco and Betelnut to him by their Servants  The chiefest City on this Island is called by the same name of  Mindanao  It is seated on the South side of the Island in lat d m N on the banks of a small River about two Mile from the Sea The manner of building is somewhat strange yet generally used in this part of the  EastIndies  Their Houses are all built on Posts about or Foot high These Posts are bigger or less ac∣cording to the intended magnificence of the Super∣structure They have but one Floor but many Par∣titions or Rooms and a Ladder or Stairs to go up out of the Streets The Roof is large and covered with Palmeto or Palmleaves So there is a clear passage like a Piazza but a filthy one under the  House Some of the poorer People that keep Ducks or Hens have a fence made round the Posts of their Houses with a Door to go in and out and this Underroom serves for no other use Some use this place for the common draught of their Houses but building mostly close by the River in all parts of the  Indies  they make the River receive all the filth of their House and at the time of the Landfloods all is washed very clean  The Sultan's House is much bigger than any of the rest It stands on about great Posts or Trees a great deal higher than the common Building with great broad Stairs made to go up In the first Room he hath about Iron Guns all Saker and Minion placed on FieldCarriages The General and other great Men have some Guns also in their Houses About paces from the Sultan's House there is a small low House built purposely for the Reception of Ambassadors or Merchant Strangers This also stands on Posts but the Floor is not raised above three or four Foot above the Ground and is neatly Matted purposely for the Sultan and his Council to sit on for they use no Chairs but sit crosslegg'd like Taylors on the Floor  The common Food at  Mindanao  is Rice or Sago and a small Fish or two The better sort eat Buffa∣lo or Fowls ill drest and abundance of Rice with it They use no Spoons to eat their Rice but every Man takes a handful out of the Platter and by wetting his Hand in Water that it may not stick to his Hand squeezes it into a lump as hard as possibly he can make it and then crams it into his Mouth They all strive to make these lumps as big as their Mouths can receive them and seem to vie with each other and glory in taking in the biggest lump so that sometimes they almost choak them∣selves They always wash after Meals or if they touch any thing that is unclean for which reason  they spend abundance of VVater in their Houses This VVater with the washing of their Dishes and what other filth they make they pour down near their Fireplace for their Chambers are not boarded but floored with split Bamboes like Lathe so that the VVater presently falls underneath their dwelling Rooms where it breeds Maggots and makes a pro∣digious stink Besides this filthiness the sick Peo∣ple ease themselves and make VVater in their Cham∣bers there being a small hole made purposely in the floor to let it drop through But healthy sound People commonly ease themselves and make VVater in the River For that reason you shall always see abundance of People of both Sexes in the River from Morning till Night some easing themselves others washing their bodies or Cloaths If they come into the River purposely to wash their Cloaths they strip and stand naked till they have done then put them on and march out again both Men and VVo∣men take great delight in swimming and washing themselves being bred to it from their Infancy I do believe it is very wholsom to wash Mornings and Evenings in these hot Countries at least three or four Days in the VVeek For I did use my self to it when I lived afterwards at  Bencooly  and found it very refreshing and comfortable It is very good for those that have Fluxes to wash and stand in the River Mornings and Evenings I speak it experimen∣tally for I was brought very low with that distem∣per at  Achin  but by washing constantly Mornings and Evenings I found great benefit and was quickly cured by it  In the City of  Mindanao  they speak two Lan∣guages indifferently their own  Mindanao  Lan∣guage and the  Malaya  but in other parts of the Island they speak only their proper Language ha∣ving little Commerce abroad They have Schools and instruct the Children to Read and VVrite and  bring them up in the  Mahometan  Religion There fore many of the words especially their Prayers are in  Arabick  and many of the words of civility the same as in  Turkey  and especially when they meet in the Morning or take leave of each other they express themselves in that Language  Many of the old People both Men and Women can speak  Spanish  for the  Spaniards  were formerly settled among them and had several Forts on this Island and then they sent two Friers to the City to convert the Sultan of  Mindanao  and his People At that time these People began to learn  Spanish  and the  Spaniards  incroached on them and endea∣voured to bring them into subjection and proba∣bly before this time had brought them all under their yoak if they themselves had not been drawn off from this Island to  Manila  to resist the  Chiness  who threatned to invade them there When the  Spa∣niards  were gone the old Sultan of  Mindanao  Fa∣ther to the present in whose time it was razed and demolished their Forts brought away their Guns and sent away the Friers and since that time will not suffer the  Spaniards  to settle on the Islands  They are now most afraid of the  Dutch  being sensible how they have inslaved many of the Neigh∣bouring Islands For that Reason they have a long time desired the  English  to settle among them and have offered them any convenient Place to build a Fort in as the General himself told us giving this Reason that they do not find the  English  so in∣croaching as the  Dutch  or  Spanish  The  Dutch  are no less jealous of their admitting the  English  for they are sensible what detriment it would be to them if the  English  should settle here  There are but few Tradesmen at the City of  Mindanao  The chiefest Trades are Goldsmiths Blacksmiths and Carpenters There are but two or  three Goldsmiths these will work in Gold or Silver and make any thing that you desire but they have no Shop furnished with Ware ready made for Sale Here are several Blacksmiths who work very well considering the Tools that they work with Their Bellows are much different from ours They are made of a wooden Cylinder the trunk of a Tree about three Foot long bored hollow like a Pump and set upright on the ground on which the Fire it self is made Near the lower end there is a small hole in the side of the Trunk next the Fire made to re∣ceive a Pipe through which the wind is driven to the Fire by a great bunch of fine Feathers fastned to one end of the Stick which closing up the inside of the Cylinder drives the Air out of the Cylinder through the Pipe Two of these Trunks or Cy∣linders are placed so nigh together that a Man standing between them may work them both at once alternately one with each Hand They have neither Vice nor Anvil but a great hard Stone or a piece of an old Gun to hammer upon yet they will perform their work making both common Utensils and Ironworks about Ships to admiration They work altogether with Charcoal Every Man almost is a Carpenter for they can work with the Ax and Adds Their Ax is but small and so made that they can take it out of the Helve and by turn∣ing it make an Adds of it They have no Saws but when they make Plank they split the Tree in two and make a Plank of each part plaining it with the Ax and Adds This requires much pains and takes up a great deal of time but they work cheap and the goodness of the Plank thus hewed which hath its grain preserv'd entire makes a∣mends for their cost and pains  They build good and serviceable Ships or Barks for the Sea some for Trade others for Pleasure and some Ships of War Their trading Vessels they  send chiefly to  Manila  Thither they transport Beeswax which I think is the only Commodity be∣sides Gold that they vend there The Inhabitants of the City of  Mindanao  get a great deal of Beeswax themselves but the greatest quantity they purchase is of the Mountaneers from whom they also get the Gold which they send to  Manila  and with these they buy their Calicoes Muslins and  China  Silk They send sometimes their Barks to  Borneo  and other Islands but what they transport thither or import from thence I know not The  Dutch  come hither in Sloops from  Ternate  and  Tidore  and buy Rice Beeswax and Tobacco for here is a great deal of Tobacco grows on this Island more than in any Island or Country in the  EastIndies  that I know of  Manila  only excepted It is an excellent sort of Tobacco but these People have not the Art of managing this Trade to their best advantage as the  Spaniards  have at  Manila  I do believe the Seeds were first brought hither from  Manila  by the  Spaniards  and even thither in all probability from  America  the difference between the  Mindanao  and  Manila  Tobacco is that the  Min∣danao  Tobacco is of a darker colour and the Leaf larger and grosser than the  Manila  Tobacco being propagated or planted in a fatter Soil The  Manila  Tobacco is of a bright yellow colour of an in∣different size not strong but pleasant to Smoak The  Spaniards  at  Manila  are very curious about this Tobacco having a peculiar way of making it up nearly in the Leaf For they take two little Sticks each about a Foot long and flat and placing the Stalks of the Tobacco Leaves in a row or of them between the two Sticks they bind them hard together so that the Leaves hang dangling down One of these bundles is sold for a Rial at Fort  St George  but you may have or pound of Tobacco at  Mindanao  for a Rial and the Tobacco is  as good or rather better than the  Manila  Tobacco but they have not that vent for it as the  Spaniards  have  The  Mindanao  People are much troubled with a sort of Leprosie the same as we observed at  Guam  This Distemper runs with a dry Scurf all over their Bodies and causeth great itching in those that have it making them frequently scratch and scrub them∣selves which raiseth the outer skin in small whitish flakes like the scales of little Fish when they are raised on end with a Knife This makes their skin extraordinary rough and in some you shall see broad white spots in several parts of their Body I judge such have had it but are cured for their skins were smooth and I did not perceive them to scrub themselves yet I have learnt from their own mouths that these spots were from this Distemper Whether they use any means to cure themselves or whether it goes away of it self I know not but I did not perceive that they made any great matter of it for they did never refrain any company for it none of our People caught it of them for we were afraid of it and kept off They are some∣times troubled with the Small Pox but their ordi∣nary Distempers are Fevers Agues Fluxes with great pains and gripings in their Guts The Coun∣try affords a great many Drugs and Medicinal Herbs whose Virtues are not unknown to some of them that pretend to cure the Sick  The  Mindanao  Men have many Wives but what Ceremonies are used when they Marry I know not There is commonly a great Feast made by the Bridegroom to entertain his Friends and the most part of the Night is spent in Mirth  The Sultan is absolute in his Power over all his Subjects He is but a poor Prince for as I men∣tioned before they have but little Trade and therefore cannot be rich If the Sultan understands  that any Man has Money if it be but Dollars which is a great matter among them he will send to borrow so much Money pretending urgent oc∣casions for it and they dare not deny him Some∣times he will send to sell one thing or another that he hath to dispose of to such whom he knows to have Money and they must buy it and give him his price and if afterwards he hath occasion for the same thing he must have it if he sends for it He is but a little Man between or Years old and by relation very good natured but overruled by those about him He has a Queen and keeps about Women or Wives more in whose com∣pany he spends most of his time He has one Daughter by his Sultaness or Queen and a great many Sons and Daughters by the rest These walk about the Streets and would be always beg∣ging things of us but it is reported that the young Princess is kept in a Room and never stirs out and that she did never see any Man but her Father and  Raja Laut  her Uncle being then about Fourteen Years Old  When the Sultan visits his Friends he is carried in a small Couch on four Mens shoulders with eight or ten armed Men to guard him but he never goes far this way for the Country is very Woody and they have but little Paths which renders it the less commodious When he takes his pleasure by Wa∣ter he carries some of his Wives along with him The Proes that are built for this purpose are large enough to entertain or Persons or more The Hull is neatly built with a round Head and Stern and over the Hull there is a small slight House built with Bamboes the sides are made up with split Bamboes about four Foot high with little Windows in them of the same to open and shut at their pleasure The roof is almost flat neatly thatched with Palmeto Leaves This House is di∣vided  into two or three small Partitions or Chambers one particularly for himself This is neatly Matted underneath and round the sides and there is a Carpit and Pillows for him to sleep on The se∣cond Room is for his Women much like the for∣mer The third is for the Servants who tend them with Tobacco and BetelNut for they are always chewing or smoaking The fore and afterparts of the Vessel are for the Marriners to sit and Row Be∣sides this they have Outlayers such as those I de∣scribed at  Guam  only the Boats and Outlayers here are larger These Boats are more round like the HalfMoon almost and the Bamboes or Out∣layers that reach from the Boat are also crooked Besides the Boat is not flat on one side here as at  Guam  but hath a Belly and Outlayers on each side and whereas at  Guam  there is a little Boat fa∣sten'd to the Outlayers that lies in the Water the Beams or Bamboes here are fasten'd traverse∣wise to the Outlayers on each side and touch not the Water like Boats but or Foot above the Water and serve for the Barge Men to sit and Row and paddle on the inside of the Vessel except on∣ly just afore and abaft being taken up with the apartments for the Passengers There run across the Outlayers two tire of Beams for the Padlers to sit on on each side the Vessel The lower tire of these Beams is not a bove a Foot from the Water so that upon any the least reeling of the Vessel the Beams are dipt in the Water and the Men that sit are wet up to their Waste their Feet seldom esca∣ping the Water And thus as all our Vessels are Rowed from within these are Paddled from with∣out  The Sultan hath a Brother called  Raja Laut  a brave Man He is the second Man in the Kingdom All Strangers that come hither to Trade must make their Address to him for all Sea Affairs belong to  him He Licenceth Strangers to Import or Export any Commodity and 'tis by his Permission that the Natives themselves are suffered to Trade Nay the very Fishermen must ake a Permit from him So that there is no Man can come into the River or go out but by his leave He is two or three Years younger than the Sultan and a little Man like him He has eight Women by some of whom he hath Issue He hath only one Son about twelve or fourteen Years old who was Circumcised while we were there His Eldest Son died a little before we came hither for whom he was still in great heavi∣ness If he had lived a little longer he should have Married the Young Princess but whether this second Son must have her I know not for I did never hear any Discourse about it  Raja Laut  is a very sharp Man he speaks and writes  Spanish  which he learned in his Youth He has by often conversing with Strangers got a great sight into the Customs of other Nations and by  Spanish  Books has some knowledge of  Europe  He is General of the  Min∣danayans  and is accounted an expert Soldier and a very stout Man and the Women in their Dances Sing many Songs in his praise  The Sultan of  Mindanao  sometimes makes War with his Neighbours the  Mountaneers  or  Alfoores  Their Weapons are Swords Lances and some HandCressets The Cresset is a small thing like a Baggonet which they always wear in War or Peace at Work or Play from the greatest of them to the poorest or the meanest Persons They do never meet each other so as to have a pitcht Battle but they build small Works or Forts of Timber wherein they plant little Guns and lie in sight of each other or Months skirmishing every Day in small Parties and sometimes surprizing a Brestwork and whatever side is like to be worsted if they have no probability to escape by flight they  sell their lives as dear as they can for there is sel∣dom any quarter given but the Conqueror cuts and hacks his Enemies to pieces  The Religion of these People is Mahometanism  Friday  is their Sabbath but I did never see any difference that they make between this Day and any other Day only the Sultan himself goes then to the Mosque twice  Raja Laut  never goes to the Mosque but Prays at certain Hours Eight or Ten times in a Day where ever he is he is very punctual to his Canonical Hours and if he be aboard will go ashore on purpose to Pray For no Business nor Company hinders him from this Duty Whether he is at home or abroad in a House or in the Field he leaves all his Company and goes about Yards off and there kneels down to his Devotion He first kisses the Ground then prays aloud and divers times in his Prayers he kisses the Ground and does the same when he leaves off His Servants and his Wives and Children talk and sing or play how they please all the time but himself is very serious The meaner sort of People have little De∣votion I did never see any of them at their Pray∣ers or go into a Mosque  In the Sultan's Mosque there is a great Drum with but one Head called a  Gong  which is instead of a Clock This  Gong  is beaten at a Clock at and a Man being appointed for that Ser∣vice He has a Stick as big as a Man's Arm with a great knob at the end bigger than a Man's Fist made with Cotton bound fast with small Cords with this he strikes the  Gong  as hard as he can about strokes beginning to strike leisurely the first or strokes then he strikes faster and at last strikes as fast as he can and then he strikes again slower and slower so many more strokes thus he rises and falls three times and then leaves off till three Hours after This is done Night and Day  They circumcise the Males at or Years of Age or older and many are circumcised at once This Ceremony is performed with a great deal of Solemnity There had been no Circumcision for some Years before our being here and then there was one for  Raja Laut  's Son They chuse to have a general Circumcision when the Sultan or Ge∣neral or some other great Person hath a Son fit to be Circumcised for with him a great many more are Circumcised There is notice given about or Days before for all Men to appear in Arms and great preparation is made against the solemn Day In the Morning before the Boys are Circum∣cised Presents are sent to the Father of the Child that keeps the Feast which as I said before is either the Sultan or some great Person and about or a Clock the  Mahometan  Priest does his Of∣fice He takes hold of the foreskin with two Sticks and with a pair of Scissors snips it off After this most of the Men both in City and Country being in Arms before the House begin to act as if they were ingaged with an Enemy having such Arms as I described Only one acts at a time the rest make a great Ring of or Yards round about him He that is to exercise comes into the Ring with a great shriek or two and a horrid look then he fetches two or three large stately strides and falls to work He holds his broad Sword in one Hand and his Lance in the other and traverses his Ground leap∣ing from one side of the Ring to the other and in a menacing posture and look bids defiance to the Enemy whom his fancy frames to him for there is nothing but Air to oppose him Then he stamps and shakes his Head and grinning with his Teeth makes many ruful Faces Then he throws his Lance and nimbly snatches out his Cresset with which he hacks and hews the Air like a Madman often shrieking At last being almost tired with  motion he flies to the middle of the Ring where he seems to have his Enemy at his Mercy and with two or three blows cuts on the Ground as if he was cutting off his Enemy's Head By this time he is all of a Sweat and withdraws triumphantly out of the Ring and presently another enters with the like shrieks and gesture Thus they continue com∣bating their imaginary Enemy all the rest of the Day towards the conclusion of which the richest Men act and at last the General and then the Sultan concludes this Ceremony He and the Ge∣neral with some other great Men are in Armor but the rest have none After this the Sultan re∣turns home accompanied with abundance of Peo∣ple who wait on him there till they are dismist But at the time when we were there there was an after game to be played for the General's Son being then Circumcised the Sultan intended to give him a second visit in the Night so they all waited to attend him thither The General also pro∣vided to meet him in the best manner and there∣fore desired Captain  Swan  with his Men to attend him Accordingly Captain  Swan  ordered us to get our Guns and wait at the General's House till fur∣ther Orders So about of us waited till Eight a Clock in the Evening When the General with Captain  Swan  and about Men went to meet the Sultan with abundance of Torches that made it as light as Day The manner of the march was thus First of all there was a Pageant and upon it two dancing Women gorgeously apparelled with Co∣ronets on their Heads full of glistering Spangles and Pendants of the same hanging down over their Breast and Shoulders These are Women bred up purposely for dancing Their Feet and Legs are but little imployed except sometimes to turn round very gently but their Hands Arms Head and Body are in continual motion especi∣ally  their Arms which they turn and twist so strangely that you would think them to be made without Bones Besides the two dancing Women there were two old Women in the Pageant hold∣ing each a lighted Torch in their Hands close by the two dancing Women by which light the glit∣tering Spangles appeared very gloriously This Pageant was carried by six lusty Men Then came six or seven Torches lighting the General and Cap∣tain  Swan  who marched side by side next and we that attended Captain  Swan  followed close after marching in order six and six abrest with each Man his Gun on his Shoulder and Torches on each side After us came twelve of the General's Men with old  Spanish  Matchlocks marching four in a row After them about forty Lances and behind them as many with great Swords marching all in order After them came abundance only with Cressers by their fides who marched up close without any order When we came near the Sultan's House the Sultan and his Men met us and we wheel'd off to let them pass The Sultan had three Pageants went before him In the first Pageant were four of his Sons who were about or Years old They had gotten abundance of small Stones which they roguishly threw about on the Peoples Heads In the next were four young Maidens Nieces to the Sultan being his Sisters Daughters and in the d there were three of the Sultan's Children not above six Years old The Sultan himself followed next being carried in his Couch which was not like your  Indian Palankins  but open and very little and ordinary A multitude of People came after with∣out any order but as soon as he was past by the General and Captain  Swan  and all our Men clo∣sed in just behind the Sultan and so all marched together to the General's House We came thither between and a Clock where the biggest part  of the Company were immediately dismist but the Sultan and his Children and his Nieces and some other Persons of Quality entred the General's House They were met at the head of the Stairs by the General's Women who with a great deal of Respect conducted them into the House Captain  Swan  and we that were with him followed after It was not long before the General caused his dancing Women to enter the Room and divert the Company with that pastime I had forgot to tell you that they have none but vocal Musick here by what I could learn except only a row of a kind of Bells without Clappers in number and their weight increasing gradually from about three to ten pound weight These were set in a row on a Table in the General's House where for seven or eightDays together before the Circumcision Day they were struck each with a little Stick for the biggest part of the Day making a great noise and they ceased that Morning So these dancing Women sung them∣selves and danced to their own Musick After this the General's Women and the Sultan's Sons and his Nieces danced Two of the Sultan's Nieces were about or Years Old the other two were three or four Years Younger These Young Ladies were very richly drest with loose Garments of Silk and small Coronets on their Heads They were much fairer than any Women that I did ever see there and very well featured and their Noses tho' but small yet higher than the other Womens and very well proportioned When the Ladies had very well diverted themselves and the Company with dancing the General caused us to fire some Skyrockets that were made by his and Captain  Swan  's Order purposely for this Nights Solemnity and after that the Sultan and his retinue went a∣way with a few Attendants and we all broke up and thus ended this Days Solemnity but the Boys  being sore with their Amputation went stradding for a fortnight after  They are not as I said before very curious or strict in observing any Days or Times of particular Devotions except it be  Ramdam  time as we call it The  Ramdam  time was then in  August  as I take it for it was shortly after our arrival here In this time they Fast all Day and about seven a Clock in the Evening they spend near an Hour in Prayer Towards the latter end of their Prayer they loudly invoke their Prophet for about a quarter of an Hour both old and young bawling out very strangely as if they intended to fright him out of his sleepiness or neglect of them After their Prayer is ended they spend some time in Feasting before they take their repose Thus they do every Day for a whole Month at least for sometimes 'tis two or three Days longer before the  Ramdam  ends For it begins at the New Moon and lasts till they see the next New Moon which sometimes in thick hazy Wea∣ther is not till three or four Days after the Change as it happen'd while I was at  Achin  where they continued the  Ramdam  till the New Moon's ap∣pearance The next Day after they have seen the New Moon the Guns are all discharged about Noon and then the time ends  A main part of their Religion consists in washing often to keep themselves from being defiled or after they are defiled to cleanse themselves again They also take great care to keep themselves from being polluted by tasting or touching any thing that is accounted Unclean therefore Swines Flesh is very abominable to them nay any one that hath ei∣ther tasted of Swines flesh or touched those Creatures is not permitted to come into their Houses in many Days after and there is nothing will scare them more than a Swine Yet there are wild Hogs in the Islands and those so plentiful that they will  come in Troops out of the Woods in the Night in∣to the very City and come under their Houses to romage up and down the Filth that they find there The Natives therefore would even desire us to lie in wait for the Hogs to destroy them which we did frequently by shooting them and carrying them presently on board but were prohi∣bited their Houses afterwards  And now I am on this Subject I cannot omit a Story concerning the General He once desired to have a pair of Shoes made after the  English  Fa∣shion tho' he did very seldom wear any So one our Men made him a Pair which the General liked very well Afterwards some Body told him That the Thread wherewith the Shoes were sowed were pointed with Hogsbristles This put him into a great Passion so he sent the Shoes to the Man that made them and sent him withal more Leather to make another Pair with Threads pointed with some other Hair which was immediately done and then he was well pleased  CHAP XIII  Their

Mindanao  I shall now go on with the pro∣secution of our Affairs during our stay there  'Twas in a Bay on the N Eastside of the Island that we came to an Anchor as hath been said We lay in this Bay but one Night and part of the next Day Yet there we got Speech with some of the Natives who by signs made us to understand that the City  Mindanao  was on the Westside of the Island We endeavoured to persuade one of them to go with us to be our Pilot but he would not Therefore in the Afternoon we loosed from hence steering again to the South East having the Wind at S W When we came to the S E end of the Island  Mindanao  we saw two small Islands about three Leagues distant from it We might have passed between them and the main Island as we learnt since but not knowing them nor what dangers we might encounter there we chose rather to Sail to the Eastward of them But meeting very strong Westerly Winds we got nothing forward in many  Days In this time we first saw the Islands  Mean∣gis  which are about Leagues distant from the  Mindanao  bearing S E I shall have occasion to speak more of them hereafter  The th Day of  July  we got into a deep Bay four Leagues N W from the two small Islands before mentioned But the Night before in a violent Tornado our Bark being unable to beat any long∣er bore away which put us in some pain for fear she was overset as we had like to have been our selves We anchored on the South West side of the Bay in fifteen fathom Water about a Cables length from the shore Here we were forced to shelter our selves from the violence of the Weather which was so boisterous with Rains and Tornadoes and a strong Westerly Wind that we were very glad to find this place to Anchor in being the only shelter on this side from the West Winds  This Bay is not above two Mile wide at the Mouth but farther in it is three Leagues wide and seven fathom deep running in N N W There is a good depth of Water about four or five Leagues in but Rocky foul Ground for about two Leagues in from the mouth on both sides of the Bay except only in that place where we lay About three Lea∣gues in from the mouth on the Eastem side there are fair sandy Bays and very good anchoring in four five and six fathom The Land on the East side is high Mountainous and Woody yet very well wa∣tered with small Brooks and there is one River large enough for Canoes to enter On the West side of the Bay the Land is of a mean heighth with a large Savannah bordering on the Sea and stretching from the mouth of the Bay a great way to the Westward  This Savannah abounds with long Grass and it is plentifully stock'd with Deer The adjacent Woods are a covert for them in the heat of the Day but  Mornings and Evenings they feed in the open Plains as thick as in our Parks in  England  I never saw any where such plenty of wild Deer tho' I have met with them in several parts of  America  both in the North and South Seas  The Deer live here pretty peaceably and unmo∣lested for there are no Inhabitants on that side of the Bay We visited this Savannah every Morning and killed as many Deer as we pleased sometimes or in a Day and we did eat nothing but Venison all the time we staid here  We saw a great many Plantations by the sides of the Mountains on the East side of the Bay and we went to one of them in hopes to learn of the Inhabitants whereabouts the City was that we might not oversail it in the Night but they fled from us  We lay here till the th Day before the Winds abated of their fury and then we sailed from hence directing our course to the Westward In the Morning we had a Land Wind at North At a Clock the Sea breeze came at West just in our Teeth but it being fair Weather we kept on our way turning and taking the advantage of the Land breezes by Night and the Sea breezes by Day  Being now past the S E part of the Island we coasted down on the South side and we saw a∣bundance of Canoas a fishing and now and then a small Village Neither were these Inhabitants a∣fraid of us as the former but came aboard yet we could not understand them nor they us but by signs and when we mentioned the word  Mindanao  they would point towards it  The th Day of  July  we arrived before the Ri∣ver of  Mindanao  the mouth of which lies in lat d m N and is laid in d m Longi∣tude West from the  Lizard  in  England  We anchor∣ed right against the River in fathom Water clear  hard Sand about Miles from the shore and or Miles from a small Island that lay without us to the Southward VVe fired or Guns I remem∣ber not well which and were answered again with from the shore for which we gave one again Immediately after our coming to an Anchor  Raja Laut  and one of the Sultan's Sons came off in a Canoa being rowed with Oars and demanded in  Spanish  what we were and from whence we came Mr  Smith  he who was taken Prisoner at  Leon  in  Mexico  answered in the same Language that we were  English  and that we had been a great while out of  England  They told us that we were welcome and asked us a great many questions a∣bout  England  especially concerning our  East India  Merchants and whether we were sent by them to settle a Factory here Mr  Smith  told them that we came hither only to buy Provision They seemed a little discontented when they understood that we were not come to settle among them for they had heard of our arrival on the Eastside of the Island a great while before and entertained hopes that we were sent purposely out of  England  hither to settle a Trade with them which it should seem they are very desirous of For Capt  Goodlud  had been here not long before to treat with them about it and when he went away told them as they said that in a short time they might expect an Ambassadour from  England  to make a full bargain with them  Indeed upon mature thoughts I should think we could not have done better than to have com∣plied with the desire they seemed to have of our settling here and to have taken up our quarters among them For as thereby we might better have consulted our own profit and satisfaction than by the other loose roving way of life so it might probably have proved of publick benefit to our Nation and been a means of introducing an  English  Settlement and Trade not only here but through several of the SpiceIslands which lye in its neighbourhood  For the Islands  Meangis  which I mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter lye within twenty Leagues of  Mindanao  These are three smalls Islands that abound with Gold and Cloves If I may credit my Author Prince  Jeoly  who was born on one of them and was at that time a Slave in the City of  Mindanao  He might have been purchased by us of his Master for a small matter as he was aftewards by Mr  Moody  who came hither to trade and laded a Ship with CloveBark and by transporting him home to his own Country we might have gotten a Trade there But of Prince  Jeoly  I shall speak more hereafter These Islands are as yet pro∣bably unknown to the  Dutch  who as I said before indeavour to ingross all the Spice into their own Hands  There was another opportunity offered us here of settling on another SpiceIsland that was very well inhabited for the Inhabitants fearing the  Dutch  and understanding that the  English  were set∣tling at  Mindanao  their Sultan sent his Nephew to  Mindanao  while we were there to invite us thither Captain  Swan  conferr'd with him about it divers times and I do believe he had some Inclination to accept the offer and I am sure most of the Men were for it but this never came to a head for want of a true understanding between Captain  Swan  and his Men as may be declared hereafter  Beside the benefit which might accrue from this Trade with  Meangis  and other the Spice Islands the  Philippine  Islands themselves by a little care and industry might have afforded us a very bene∣ficial Trade and all these Trades might have been managed from  Mindanao  by settling there first For that Island lyeth very convenient for Trading  either to the SpiceIslands or to the rest of the  Philippine  Islands since as its Soil is much of the same nature with either of them so it lies as it were in the Center of the Gold and Spice Trade in these parts the Islands North of  Mindanao  abounding most in Gold and those South of  Meangis  in Spice  As the Island  Mindanao  lies very convenient for Trade so considering its distance the way thi∣ther may not be overlong and tiresome The Course that I would choose should be to set out of  England  about the latter end of  August  and to pass round  Terra del Fuego  and so stretching over to∣wards  New Holland  coast it along that Shore till I came near to  Mindanao  or first I would coast down near the  American  Shore as far as I found convenient and then direct my Course accordingly for the Island By this I should avoid coming near any of the  Dutch  Settlements and he sure to meet always with a constant brisk Easterly Trade Wind after I was once past  Terra del Fuego  Whereas in passing about the Cape of  Good Hope  after you are shot over the  EastIndian  Ocean and are come to the Islands you must pass through the Streights of  Malacca  or  Sandy  or else some other Streights East from  Java  where you will be sure to meet with Countrywinds go on which side of the Equator you please and this would require ordinarily or Months for the Voyage but the other I should hope to perform in or at most In your return from thence also you must observe the same Rule as the  Spaniards  do in going from  Manila  to  Acapulco  only as they run towards the NorthPole for variable Winds so you must run to the South∣ward till you meet with a Wind that will carry you over to  Terra del Fuego  There are places e∣nough to touch at for Refreshment either going or coming You may touch going thither on ei∣ther  side of  Terra Patagonica  or if you please at the  Gallapagoes Islands  where there is Refreshment enough and returning you may probably touch somewhere on  New Holland  and so make some pro∣fitable discovery in these Places without going out of your way And to speak my Thoughts freely I believe 'tis owing to the neglect of this easie way that all that vast Tract of  Terra Australis  which bounds the  South Sea  is yet undiscovered those that cross that Sea seeming to design some Business on the  Peruvian  or  Mexican  Coast and so leaving that at a distance To confirm which I shall add what Captain  Davis  told me lately That after his Departure from us at the Haven of  Ria Lexa  as is mentioned in the th Chap he went after seve∣ral Traverses to the  Gallapagoes  and that standing thence Southward for Wind to bring him about  Terra del Fuego  in the Lat of South about leagues from  Copayapo  on the Coast of  Coili  he saw a small sandy Island just by him and that they saw to the Westward of it a long Tract of pretty high Land tending away toward the North West out of sight This might probably be the Coast of  Terra Australis Incognita  But to return to  Mindanao  as to the Capacity we were then in of settling our selves at  Mindanao  al∣though we were not sent out of any such design of settling yet we were as well provided or better considering all Circumstances than if we had For there was scarce any useful Trade but some or other of us understood it We had Sawyers Car∣penters Joyners Brickmakers Bricklayers Shoe∣makers Taylors  c  we only wanted a good Smith for great Work which we might have had at  Mindanao  We were very well provided with Iron Lead and all sorts of Tools as Saws Axes Hammers  c  We had Powder and Shot enough and very good small Arms If we had designed to  build a Fort we could have spared or Guns out of our Ship and Men enough to have ma∣naged it and any Affair of Trade beside We had also a great Advantage above raw Men that are sent out of  England  into these places who proceed usu∣ally too cautiously coldly and formally to com∣pass any considerable Design which Experience better teaches than any Rules whatsoever besides the danger of their Lives in so great and sudden a change of Air whereas we were all inured to hot Climates hardened by many Fatigues and in general daring Men and such as would not be easily baffled To add one thing more our Men were almost tired and began to desire a  quietus est  and therefore they would gladly have seated them∣selves any where We had a good Ship too and enough of us beside what might have been spared to manage our new Settlement to bring the News with the Effects to the Owners in  England  for Captain  Swan  had already  l  in Gold which he and his Merchants received for Goods sold most∣ly to Captain  Harris  and his Men which if he had laid but part of it out in Spice as probably he might have done would have satisfy'd the Merchants to their Hearts content So much by way of digres∣sion  To proceed therefore with our first Reception at  Mindanao Raja Laut  and his Nephew sat still in their Canoa and would not come aboard us because as they said they had no Orders for it from the Sultan After about half an Hour's Discourse they took their leaves first inviting Captain  Swan  ashore and pro∣mising him to assist him in getting Provision which they said at present was scarce but in three or four Month's time the Rice would be gathered in and then he might have as much as he pleased and that in the mean time he might secure his Ship in some convenient place for fear of the Westerly  winds which they said would be very violent at the latter end of this Month and all the next as we found them  We did not know the quality of these two Per∣sons till after they were gone else we should have fir'd some Guns at their departure When they were gone a certain Officer under the Sultan came aboard and measured our Ship A custom deri∣ved from the  Chinese  who always measure the length and breadth and the depth of the Hold of all Ships that come to load there by which means they know how much each Ship will carry But for what reason this Custom is used either by the  Chinese  or  Mindanao  Men I could never learn un∣less the  Mindanaians  design by this means to im∣prove their skill in Shipping against they have a Trade  Captain  Swan  considering that the Season of the Year would oblige us to spend some time at this Island thought it convenient to make what inte∣rest he could with the Sultan who might after∣wards either obstruct or advance his designs He therefore immediately provided a Present to send a∣shore to the Sultan  viz  Yards of Scarlet Cloth Yards of broad Gold Lace a Turkish Scimiter and a Pair of Pistols and to  Raja Laut  he sent Yards of Scarlet Cloth and Yards of Silver Lace This Present was carried by Mr  Henry More  in the Even∣ing He was first conducted to  Raja Laut  's House where he remained till report thereof was made to the Sultan who immediately gave order for all things to be made ready to receive him  About Nine a Clock at Night a Messenger came from the Sultan to bring the Present away Then Mr  More  was conducted all the way with Torches and armed Men till be came to the House where the Sultan was The Sultan with eight or ten Men of his Council were seated on Carpets waiting  his coming The Present that Mr  More  brought was laid down before them and was very kindly accepted by the Sultan who caused Mr  More  to sit down by them and asked a great many questions of him The discourse was in  Spanish  by an In∣terpreter This Conference lasted about an Hour and then he was dismist and returned again to  Raja Laut  's House There was a Supper provided for him and the Boats Crew after which he re∣turned aboard  The next Day the Sultan sent for Capt  Swan  He immediately went ashore with a Flag flying in the Boats Head and two Trumpets sounding all the way When he came ashore he was met at his Landing by two principal Officers guarded along with Soldiers and abundance of People gazing to see him The Sultan waited for him in his Cham∣ber of Audience where Captain  Swan  was treated with Tobacco and Betel which was all his Enter∣tainment  The Sultan sent for two  English  Letters for Cap∣tain  Swan  to read purposely to let him know that our  EastIndia  Merchants did design to settle here and that they had already sent a Ship hi∣ther One of these Letters was sent to the Sultan from  England  by the  EastIndia  Merchants The chiefest things contained in it as I remember for I saw it afterwards in the Secretaries Hand who was very proud to shew it to us was to desire some priviledges in order to the building of a Fort there This Letter was written in a very fair Hand and between each Line there was a Gold Line drawn The other Letter was left by Captain  Goodlud  directed to any  English  Men who should happen to come thither This related wholly to Trade giving an account at what rate he had agreed with them for Goods of the Island and how  European  Goods should be sold to them  with an account of their Weight and Measures and their difference from ours  The rate agreed on for  Mindanao  Gold was  Spanish  Dollars which is a current Coin all over  India  the  English  Ounce and Dollars the  Min∣danao  Ounce But for Beeswax and Clovebark I do not remember the rate neither do I well re∣member the rates of  Europe  Commodities but I think the rate of Iron was not above four Dollars a Hundred Captain  Goodlud  's Letter concluded thus  Trust none of them for they are all Thieves but Tace is Latin for a Candle  We understood afterwards that Captain  Goodlud  was robb'd of some Goods by one of the General's Men and that he that robb'd him was fled into the Mountains and could not be found while Captain  Goodlud  was here But the Fellow returning back to the City some time after our arrival here  Raja Laut  brought him bound to Captain  Swan  and told him what he had done desiring him to punish him for it as he pleased but Captain  Swan  excused himself and said it did not belong to him therefore he would have no∣thing to do with it However the General  Raja Laut  would not pardon him but punished him ac∣cording to their own Custom which I did never see but at this time  He was stript stark naked in the Morning at Sun∣rising and bound to a Post so that he could not stir Hand nor Foot but as he was mov'd and was placed with his Face Eastward against the Sun In the Afternoon they turn'd his Face towards the West that the Sun might still be in his Face and thus he stood all Day parcht in the Sun which shines here excessively hot and tormented with the Moskitos or Gnats After this the General would have kill'd him if Captain  Swan  had consented to it I did never see any put to Death but I believe they are barbarous enough in it The General told us him∣self  that he put two Men to Death in a Town where some of us were with him but I heard not the manner of it Their common way of punish∣ing is to strip them in this manner and place them in the Sun but sometimes they lay them flat on their Backs on the Sand which is very hot where they remain a whole Day in the scorching Sun with the Moskito's biting them all the time  This action of the General in offering Captain  Swan  the punishment of the Thief caus'd Captain  Swan  afterwards to make him the same offer of his Men when any had offended the  Mindanao  Men but the General left such Offenders to be punished by Captain  Swan  as he thought convenient So that for the least offence Captain  Swan  punished his Men and that in the sight of the  Mindanaians  and I think sometimes only for revenge as he did once punish his Chief Mate Mr  Teat  he that came Cap∣tain of the Bark to  Mindanao  Indeed at that time Captain  Swan  had his Men as much under com∣mand as if he had been in a King's Ship and had he known how to use his Authority he might have led them to any Settlement and have brought them to assist him in any design he had pleased  Captain  Swan  being dismist from the Sultan with abundance of civility after about two Hours Discourse with him went thence to  Raja Laut  's House  Raja Laut  had then some difference with the Sultan and therefore he was not present at the Sultan's reception of our Captain but waited his re∣turn and treated him and all his Men with boiled Rice and Fowls He then told Captain  Swan  a∣gain and urged it to him that it would be best to get his Ship into the River as soon as he could because of the usual tempestuous Weather at this time of the Year and that he should want no assist∣ance to further him in any thing He told him al∣so that as we must of necessity stay here some  time so our Men would often come ashore and he therefore desired him to warn his Men to be careful to give no afront to the Natives who he said were very revengeful That their Customs being different from ours he feared that Captain  Swan  's Men might some time or other offend them though ignorantly that therefore he gave him this friendly warning to prevent it that his House should always be open to receive him or any of his Men and that he knowing our Customs would never be offended at any thing After a great deal of such Discourse he dismist the Captain and his Company who took their leave and came aboard  Captain  Swan  having seen the two Letters did not doubt but that the  English  did design to settle a Factory here therefore he did not much scruple the honesty of these People but immediately or∣dered us to get the Ship into the River The Ri∣ver upon which the City of  Mindanao  stands is but small and hath not above or Foot Water on the Bar at a Springtide therefore we lightened our Ship and the Spring coming on we with much ado got her into the River being assisted by or  Mindanaian  Fishermen who liv'd at the Mouth of the River  Raja Laut  himself being a∣board our Ship to direct them We carried her about a quarter of a Mile up within the Mouth of the River and there moored her Head and Stern in a hole where we always rode afloat After this the Citizens of  Mindanao  came frequently a∣board to invite our Men to their Houses and to offer us Pagallies 'Twas a long time since any of us had received such Friendship and therefore we were the more easily drawn to accept of their kindnesses and in a very short time most of our Men got a Comrade or two and as many Pagal∣lies especially such of us as had good Cloths and  ore of Gold as many had who were of the  number of those that accompanied Captain  Harris  over the Isthmus of  Darien  the rest of us being Poor enough Nay the very Poorest and Meanest of us could hardly pass the Streets but we were even hal'd by Force into their Houses to be treated by them altho' their Treats were but mean  viz  Tobacco or BetelNut or a little sweet spiced Wa∣ter Yet their seeming Sincerity Simplicity and the manner of bestowing these Gifts made them very acceptable When we came to their Houses they would always be praising the  English  as decla∣ring that the  English  and  Mindanaians  were all one This they exprest by putting their two Forefingers close together and saying that the  English  and  Min∣danaians  were  samo samo  that is  all one  Then they would draw their Forefingers half a Foot asunder and say the  Dutch  and they were  Bugeto  which sig∣nifies so that they were at such distance in point of Friendship And for the  Spaniards  they would make a greater Representation of distance than for the  Dutch  Fearing these but having felt and smarted from the  Spaniards  who had once almost brought them under  Captain  Swan  did seldom go into any House at first but into  Raja Laut  's There he dined commonly every day and as many of his Men as were ashore and had no Money to Entertain themselves resort∣ed thither about twelve a Clock where they had Rice enough boiled and well drest and some scraps of Fowls or bits of Buffaloe drest very nastily Cap∣tain  Swan  was served a little better and his two Trumpeters sounded all the time that he was at Din∣ner After Dinner  Raja Laut  would sit and Discourse with him most part of the Afternoon It was now the  Ramdam  time therefore the General ex∣cused himself that he could not Entertain our Captain with Dances and other Pastimes as he intended to do when this solemn Time was past  besides it was the very heighth of the wet Season and therefore not so proper for Pastimes  We had now very tempestuous Weather and excessive Rains which so swell'd the River that it overflowed its Banks so that we had much ado to keep our Ship safe For every now and then we should have a great Tree come floating down the River and sometimes lodge against our Bows to the endangering the breaking our Cables and either the driving us in over the Banks or carrying us out to Sea both which would have been very dangerous to us especially being without Ballast  The City is about a Mile long of no great breadth winding with the Banks of the River on the Right Hand going up tho' it hath many Houses on the other side too But at this time it seemed to stand as in a Pond and there was no passing from one House to another but in Canoas This tem∣pestuous rainy Weather happened the latter end of  July  and lasted most part of  August  When the bad Weather was a little asswaged Captain  Swan  hired a House to put our Sails and Goods in while we carren'd our Ship We had a great deal of Iron and Lead which was brought ashore into this House Of these Commodities Captain  Swan  sold to the Sultan or General Eight or Ten Tuns at the Rates agreed on by Captain  Goodlud  to be paid in Rice The  Mindanaians  are no good Accomptants theresore the  Chinese  that live here do cast up their Accompts for them After this Captain  Swan  bought Timbertrees of the General and set some of our Men to Saw them into Planks to Sheath the Ship's bottom He had two WhipSaws on Board which he brought out of  England  and four or five Men that knew the use of them for they had been Sawyers in  Jamaica  When the  Ramdam  time was over and the dry time set in a little the General to oblige Captain  Swan  entertained him every Night with Dances The dancing Women that are purposely bred up to it and make it their Trade I have already de∣scribed But beside them all the Women in gene∣ral are much addicted to Dancing They Dance or at once and that standing all round in a Ring joined Hand in Hand and Singing and keep∣ing time But they never budge out of their places nor make any motion till the Chorus is Sung then all at once they throw out one Leg and bawl out aloud and sometime they only clap their Hands when the Chorus is Sung Captain  Swan  to re∣taliate the General's Favours sent for his Violins and some that could Dance  English  Dances where∣with the General was very well pleased They commonly spent the biggest part of the Night in these sort of Pastimes  Among the rest of our Men that did use to Dance thus before the General there was one  John Thacker  who was a Seaman bred and could neither Write nor Read but had formerly learnt to Dance in the MusickHouses about  Wapping  This Man came into the  South Seas  with Captain  Harris  and getting with him a good quantity of Gold and be∣ing a pretty good Husband of his Share had still some left besides what he laid out in a very good Suit of Cloaths The General supposed by his Garb and his Dancing that he had been of noble Ex∣traction and to be satisfy'd of his Quality asked of one of our Men if he did not guess aright of him The Man of whom the General asked this Question told him he was much in the right and that most of our Ship's Company were of the like Extraction especially all those that had fine Cloaths and that they came abroad only to see the World having Money enough to bear their Ex∣expences  whereever they came but that for the rest those that had but mean Clothes they were only common Seamen After this the General shew'd a great deal of Respect to all that had good Clothes but especially to  John Thacker  till Captain  Swan  came to know the Business and marr'd all undeceiving the General and drubbing the NobleMan For he was so much incensed a∣gainst  John Thacker  that he could never indure him afterwards tho' the poor Fellow knew nothing of the Matter  About the middle of  November  we began to work on our Ship's bottom which we found very much eaten with the Worm For this is a horrid place for Worms We did not know this till after we had been in the River a Month and then we found our Canoas bottoms eaten like Honeycombs our Bark which was a single bottom was eaten thro' so that she could not swim But our Ship was sheath∣ed and the Worm came no farther than the Hair between the sheathing Plank and the main Plank We did not mistrust the General's Knavery till now for when he came down to our Ship and found us ripping off the sheathing Plank and saw the firm bottom underneath he shook his Head and seem∣ed to be discontented saying he did never see a Ship with two bottoms before We were told that in this place where we now lay a  Dutch  Ship was earen up in two Months time and the General had all her Guns and it is probable he did expect to have had Ours Which I do believe was the main Reason that made him so forward in assisting us to get our Ship into the River for when we went out again we had no Assistance from him We had no Worms till we came to this place For when we Careen'd at the  Marias  the Worm had not touch'd us nor at  Guam  for there we scrubb'd nor after we came to the Island  Mindanao  for at the S E end of the  Island we heel'd and scrubb'd also The  Mindanai∣ans  are so sensible of these destructive Insects that whenever they come from Sea they immediately hale their Ship into a dry Dock and burn her bot∣tom and there let her lye dry till they are ready to get to Sea again The Canoas or Proes they hale up dry and never suffer them to be long in the Water It is reported that those Worms which get into a Ships bottom in the salt Water will die in the fresh Water and that the fresh Water Worms will die in salt Water but in brackish Water both sorts will increase prodigiously Now this place where we lay was sometimes brackish Water yet commonly fresh but what sort of Worm this was I know not Some Men are of Opinion that these Worms breed in the Plank but I am perswaded they breed in the Sea For I have seen Millions of them swimming in the Water particularly in the Bay of  Panama  for there Captain  Davis  Captain  Swan  and my self and most of our Men did take notice of them divers times which was the reason of our Cleaning so often while we were there and these were the largest Worms that I did ever see I have also seen them in  Virginia  and in the Bay of  Campeachy  in the latter of which places the Worms eat prodigiously They are alway in Bays Creeks Mouths of Rivers and such places as are near the shore being never found far out at Sea that I could ever learn yet a Ship will bring them lodg'd in its Plank for a great way  Having thus ript off all our Wormeaten Plank and clapt on new by the beginning of  December  our Ships bottom was sheathed and tallowed and the th Day went over the Bar and took aboard the Iron and Lead that we could not sell and began to fill our Water and fetch aboard Rice for our Voyage But C  Swan  remain'd ashore still and was not yet determin'd when to sail or whither  But I am well assured that he did never intend to Cruise about  Manila  as his Crew designed for I did once ask him and he told me That what he had already done of that kind he was forc'd to but now being at Liberty he would never more Engage in any such Design For said he there is no Prince on Earth is able to wipe off the Stain of such Actions What other Designs he had I know not for he was commonly very Cross yet he did never pro∣pose doing any thing else but only ordered the Provision to be got Aboard in order to Sail and I am confident if he had made a motion to go to any  English  Factory most of his Men would have con∣sented to it tho' probably some would have still opposed it However his Authority might soon have oversway'd those that were Refractory for it was very strange to see the Awe that these Men were in of him for he punished the most stubborn and daring of his Men Yet when we had brought the Ship out into the Road they were not altoge∣ther so submissive as while it lay in the River tho' even then it was that he punished Captain  Teat  I was at that time a Hunting with the General for Beef which he had a long time promised us But now I saw that there was no Credit to be gi∣ven to his Word for I was a Week out with him and saw but four Cows which were so wild that we did not get one There were five or six more of our Company with me these who were young Men and had  Dalilahs  there which made them fond of the Place all agreed with the General to tell Captain  Swan  that there were Beeves enough only they were wild But I told him the Truth and advised him not to be too credulous of the Gene∣ral's Promises He seemed to be very angry and stormed behind the General's Back but in his Pre∣sence was very mute being a Man of small Cou∣rage  It was about the th Day of  December  when we returned from Hunting and the General designed to go again to another place to Hunt for Beef but he stayed till after  Christmasday  because some of us designed to go with him and Captain  Swan  had desired all his Men to be aboard that Day that we might keep it solemnly together And accord∣ingly he sent aboard a Buffaloe the Day before that we might have a good Dinner So the th Day about a Clock Captain  Swan  came aboard and all his Men who were ashore For you must understand that near a third of our Men lived con∣stantly ashore with their Comrades and Pagallies and some with Women servants whom they hired of their Masters for Concubines Some of our Men also had Houses which they hired or bought for Houses are very cheap for five or six Dollars For many of them having more Mony than they knew what to do with eased themselves here of the trouble of telling it spending it very lavishly their prodigality making the People impose upon them to the making the rest of us pay the dearer for what we bought and to the endangering the like imposi∣tions upon such  Englishmen  as may come here here∣after For the  Mindanaians  knew how to get our Squires Gold from them for we had no Silver and when our Men wanted Silver they would change now and then an Ounce of Gold and could get for it no more than or Dollars for a  Min∣danao  Ounce which they would not part with again under Dollars Yet this and the great prices the  Mindanaians  set on their Goods were not the only way to lessen their stocks for their Pa∣gallies and Comrades would often be begging somewhat of them and our Men were generous enough and would bestow half an Ounce of Gold at a time in a Ring for their Pagallies or in a Silver Wristband or Hoop to come about their  Arms in hopes to get a Nights Lodging with them  When we were all aboard on  Christmasday  Cap∣tain  Swan  and his two Merchants I did expect that Captain  Swan  would have made some pro∣posals or have told us his designs but he only dined and went ashore again without speaking a∣ny thing of his Mind Yet even then I do think that he was driving on a design of going to one of the Spice Islands to load with Spice for the Young Man before mentioned who I said was sent by his Unkle the Sultan of a Spice Island near  Ternate  to invite the  English  to their Island came aboard at this time and after some private Dis∣course with Captain  Swan  they both went ashore together This Young Man did not care that the  Mindanaians  should be privy to what he said I have heard Captain  Swan  say that he offered to load his Ship with Spice provided he would build a small Fort and leave some Men to secure the Island from the  Dutch  but I am since informed that the  Dutch  have now got possession of the Island  The next Day after  Christmas  the General went away again and five or six  Englishmen  with him of whom I was one under pretence of going a hunt∣ing and we all went together by Water in his Proe together with his Women and Servants to the hunting place The General always carried his Wives and Children his Servants his Money and Goods with him so we all imbarked in the Morning and arrived there before Night I have already described the fashion of their Proes and the Rooms made in them We were entertained in the General's Room or Cabbin Our Voyage was not so far but that we reached our Port before Night  At this time one of the General's Servants had offended and was punished in this manner He was bound fast flat on his Belly on a Bamboe be∣longing to the Proe which was so near the Wa∣ter that by the Vessel's motion it frequently del∣ved under Water and the Man along with it and sometimes when hoisted up he had scarce time to blow before he would be carried under Water a∣gain  When we had rowed about two Leagues we entred a pretty large deep River and rowed up a League further the Water salt all the way There was a pretty large Village the Houses built after the Country fashion We landed at this place where there was a House made ready immediately for us The General and his Women lay at one end of the House and we at the other end and in the Evening all the Women in the Village danced be∣fore the General  While he staid here the General with his Men went out every Morning betimes and did not re∣turn till four or five a Clock in the Afternoon and he would often complement us by telling us what good Trust and Confidence he had in us saying that he left his Women and Goods under our Protection and that he thought them as secure with us six for we had all our Arms with us as if he had left of his own Men to guard them Yet for all this great Confidence he always left one of his principal Men for fear some of us should be too familiar with his Women  They did never stir out of their own Room when the General was at Home but as soon as he was gone out they would presently come into our Room and sit with us all Day and ask a Thou∣sand Questions of us concerning our  English  Wo∣men and our Customs You may imagin that be∣fore this time some of us had attained so much of  their Language as to understand them and give them Answers to their Demands I remember that one Day they asked how many Wives the King of  England  had We told them but one and that our  English  Laws did not allow of any more They said it was a strange Custom that a Man should be consined to one Woman some of them said it was a very bad Law but others again said it was a good Law so there was a great Dispute a∣mong them about it But one of the General's Women said positively That our Law was better than theirs and made them all silent by the Reason which she gave for it This was the  War Queen  as we called her for she did always Accompany the General when ever he was called out to Engage his Enemies but the rest did not  By this Familiarity among the Women and by often discoursing them we came to be acquainted with their Customs and Priviledges The General lies with his Wives by turns but she by whom he had the first Son has a double Portion of his Com∣pany For when it comes to her turn she has him two Nights whereas the rest have him but one She with whom he is to lye at Night seems to have a particular Respect shewn her by the rest all the precedent Day and for a Mark of distinction wears a striped silk Handkerchief about her Neck by which we knew who was Queen that Day  We lay here about five or six Days but did never in all that time see the least sign of any Beef which was the Business we came about neither were we suffered to go out with the General to see the wild Kine but we wanted for nothing else However this did not please us and we often im∣portuned him to let us go out among the Cattle At last he told us That he had provided a Jar of Ricedrink to be merry with us and after that we should go with him  This Ricedrink is made of Rice boiled and put into a Jar where it remains a long time steep∣ing in Water I know not the manner of making it but it is very strong pleasant Drink The Even∣ing when the General designed to be merry he caused a Jar of this Drink to be brought into our Room and he began to drink first himself then afterwards his Men so they took turns till they were all as drunk as Swine before they suffered us to drink After they had enough then we drank and they drank no more for they will not drink after us The General leapt about our Room a little while but having his Load soon went to sleep  The next Day we went out with the General into the Savannah where he had near Men making of a large Pen to drive the Cattle into For that is the manner of their Hunting having no Dogs But I saw not above or Cows and those as wild as Deer so that we got none this Day yet the next Day some of his Men brought in Heifers which they kill'd in the Savannah With these we returned aboard they being all that we got there  Captain  Swan  was much vext at the Generals Actions for he promised to supply us with as much Beef as we should want but now either could not or would not make good his Promise Besides he failed to perform his Promise in a bargain of Rice that we were to have for the Iron which he sold him but he put us off still from time to time and would not come to any Account Neither were these all his Tricks for a little before his Son was Circumcised of which I spake in the forego∣ing Chapter he pretended a great streight for Money to defray the Charges of that Day and therefore desired Captain  Swan  to lend him about Ounces of Gold for he knew that Captain  Swan  had a considerable quantity of Gold in his possession which the General thought was his own but indeed had none but what belonged to the Merchants However he lent it the General but when he came to an Account with Captain  Swan  he told him that it was usual at such so∣lemn times to make Presents and that he received it as a Gift He also demanded Payment for the Victuals that our Captain and his Men did eat at his House These things startled Captain  Swan  yet how to help himself he knew not But all this with other inward troubles lay hard on our Captain's Spirits and put him very much out of Humour for his own Company also were pressing him every Day to be gone because now was the heighth of the Easterly Monsoon the only Wind to carry us farther into the  Indies  About this time some of our Men who were weary and tired with wandring ran away into the Country and absconded they being assisted as was generally believed by  Raja Laut  There were others also who fearing we should not go to an  English  Port bought a Canoa and designed to go in her to  Borneo  For not long before a  Mindanao  Vessel came from thence and brought a Letter di∣rected to the chief of the  English  Factory at  Min∣danao  This Letter the General would have Cap∣tain  Swan  have opened but he thought it might come from some of the  EastIndia  Merchants whose Affairs he would not intermeddle with and there∣fore did not open it I since met with Captain  Bowry  at  Achin  and telling him this Story he said that he sent that Letter supposing that the  Eng∣lish  were settled there at  Mindanao  and by this Letter we also thought that there was an  English  Factory at  Borneo  so here was a mistake on both sides But this Canoa wherewith some of them thought to go to  Borneo  Captain  Swan  took from  them and threatned the Undertakers very hardly However this did not so far discourage them for they secretly bought another but their De∣signs taking Air they were again frustrated by Captain  Swan  The whole Crew were at this time under a ge∣neral Disaffection and full of very different Pro∣jects and all for want of Action The main Divi∣sion was between those that had Money and those that had none There was a great Difference in the Humours of these for they that had Money liv'd a∣shore and did not care for leaving  Mindanao  whilst those that were poor liv'd Aboard and urg'd Capt  Swan  to go to Sea These began to be Unruly as well as Dissatisfy'd and sent ashore the Merchants Iron to sell for Rack and Honey to make Punch wherewith they grew Drunk and Quarelsome Which disorderly Actions deterr'd me from going Aboard for I did ever abhor Drunkenness which now our Men that were Aboard abandon'd them∣selves wholly to  Yet these Disorders might have been crusht if Capt  Swan  had used his Authority to Suppress them But he with his Merchants living always a∣shore there was no Command and therefore eve∣ry Man did what he pleased and encouraged each other in his Villanies Now Mr  Harthop  who was one of Captain  Swan  's Merchants did very much importune him to settle his Resolutions and declare his Mind to his Men which at last he consented to do Therefore he gave warning to all his Men to come Aboard the th day of  January    We did all earnestly expect to hear what Cap∣tain  Swan  would propose and therefore were very willing to go Aboard But unluckily for him two days before this Meeting was to be Captain  Swan  sent Aboard his Gunner  to fetch something ashore out of his Cabbin The Gunner rummaging to  find what he was sent for among other things took out the Captain's Journal from  America  to the Island  Guam  and laid down by him This Journal was taken up by one  John Read  a  Bristol  man whom I have mentioned in my th Chapter He was a pretty Ingenious young Man and of a very civil carriage and behaviour He was also accounted a good Artist and kept a Journal and was now prompted by his curiosity to peep into Captain  Swan  's Journal to see how it agreed with his own a thing very usual among Seamen that keep Journals when they have an opportunity and especially young Men who have no great ex∣perience At the first opening of the Book he light on a place in which Captain  Swan  had inveighed bitterly against most of his Men especially against another  John Reed  a  Jamaica  man This was such stuff as he did not seek after But hitting so pat on this subject his curiosity led him to pry farther and therefore while the Gunner was busie he convey'd the Book away to look over it at his leisure The Gunner having dispatch'd his business lock'd up the Cabbindoor not missing the Book and went ashore Then  John Reed  shewed it to his Namesake and to the rest that were aboard who were by this time the biggest part of them ripe for mis∣chief only wanting some fair pretence to set them∣selves to work about it Therefore looking on what was written in this Journal to be matter sufficient for them to accomplish their Ends Cap∣tain  Teat  who as I said before had been abused by Captain  Swan  laid hold on this opportunity to be revenged for his Injuries and aggravated the matter to the height perswading the Men to turn out Captain  Swan  from being Commander in hopes to have commanded the Ship himself As for the Seamen they were easily perswaded to any thing for they were quite tired with this long and  tedious Voyage and most of them despaired of ever getting home and therefore did not care what they did or whither they went It was only want of being busied in some Action that made them so uneasie therefore they consented to what  Teat  proposed and immediately all that were aboard bound themselves by Oath to turn Captain  Swan  out and to conceal this design from those that were ashore until the Ship was under Sail which would have been presently if the Surgeon or his Mate had been aboard but they were both ashore and they thought it no Prudence to go to Sea with∣out a Surgeon Therefore the next Morning they sent ashore one  John Cookworthy  to hasten off either the Surgeon or his Mate by pretending that one of the Men in the Night broke his Leg by falling into the Hold The Surgeon told him that he in∣tended to come aboard the next day with the Cap∣tain and would not come before but sent his Mate  Herman Coppinger  This Man sometime before this was sleeping at his Pagallies and a Snake twisted himself about his Neck but after wards went away without hurting him In this Country it is usual to have the Snakes come into the Houses and into the Ships too for we had several came aboard our Ship when we lay in the River But to proceed  Herman Coppinger  provided to go aboard and the next day being the time appointed for Captain  Swan  and all his Men to meet aboard I went aboard with him nei∣ther of us mistrusted what was designing by those aboard till we came thither Then we found it was only a trick to get the Surgeon off for now having obtained their Desires the Canoa was sent ashore again immediately to desire as many as they could meet to come aboard but not to tell the Reason left Captain  Swan  should come to hear of it  The th day in the Morning they weighed and fired a Gun Capt  Swan  immediately sent a∣board Mr  Nelly  who was now his chief Mate to see what the matter was To him they told all their Grievances and shewed him the Journal He per∣swaded them to stay till the next day for an An∣swer from Captain  Swan  and the Merchants So they came to an Anchor again and the next Morn∣ing Mr  Harthop  came aboard He perswaded them to be reconciled again or at least to stay and get more Rice But they were deaf to it and weigh∣ed again while he was aboard Yet at Mr  Harthop  's Perswasion they promised to stay till a Clock in the Afternoon for Captain  Swan  and the rest of the Men if they would come aboard but they suffered no Man to go ashore except one  William Williams  that had a wooden Leg and another that was a Sawyer  If Capt  Swan  had yet come aboard he might have dash'd all their designs but he neither came himself as a Captain of any Prudence and Cou∣rage would have done nor sent till the time was expired So we left Captain  Swan  and about Men ashore in the City and or that run away and about we had buried there the most of which died by Poison The Natives are very ex∣pert at Poisoning and do it upon small occasions Nor did our Men want for giving Offence through their general Rogueries and sometimes by dallying too familiarly with their Women even before their Faces Some of their Poisons are slow and linger∣ing for we had some now aboard who were Poi∣son'd there but died not till some Months after  CHAP XIV  They depart from the River of  Mindanao  Of the time lost or

The Surgeon's and the Author's desires of leaving their Crew  THE th day of  January  at of the Clock in the Afternoon we sailed from the River of  Mindanao  designing to cruise before  Mani∣la  It was during our stay at  Mindanao  that we were first made sensible of the change of time in the course of our Voyage For having Travell'd so far Westward keeping the same Course with the Sun we must consequently have gain'd some∣thing insensibly in the length of the particular Days but have lost in the tale the bulk or num∣ber of the Days or Hours According to the diffe∣rent Longitudes of  England  and  Mindanao  this Isle being West from the  Lizzard  by common Computation about Degrees the difference of time at our Arrival at  Mindanao  ought to be about Hours and so much we should have anticipated our reckoning having gained it by bearing the Sun company Now the natural Day in every par∣ticular place must be consonant to it self but this going about with or against the Suns course will of necessity make a difference in the Calculation of the civil Day between any two places Accord∣ingly at  Mindanao  and all other places in the  EastIndies  we found them reckoning a Day before us both Natives and  Europeans  for rhe  Europeans  com∣ing Eastward by the Cape of  Good Hope  in a Course contrary to the Sun and us whereever we met they were a full Day before us in their Ac∣counts So among the  Indian Mahometans  here their  Friday  the Day of their Sultan's going to their Mosques was  Thursday  with us though it were  Friday  also with those who came Eastward from  Europe  Yet at the  Ladrone  Islands we found the  Spaniards  of  Guam  keeping the same Computation with our selves the reason of which I take to be that they settled that Colony by a Course Westward from  Spain  the  Spaniards  going first to  America  and thence to the  Ladrones  and  Philippines  But how the reckoning was at  Manila  and the rest of the  Spa∣nish  Colonies in the  Philippine  Islands I know not whether they keep it as they brought it or correct∣ed it by the Accounts of the Natives and of the  Portugueze Dutch  and  English  coming the contrary way from  Europe  One great Reason why Seamen ought to keep the difference of time as exact as they can is that they may be the more exact in their Latitudes For our Tables of the Suns declination being cal∣culated for the Meridians of the places in which they were made differ about Minutes from those parts of the World that lie on their opposite Meridians in the Months of  March  and  Septem∣ber  and in proportion to the Suns declination at other times of the Year also And should they run farther as we did the difference would still in∣crease upon them and be an occasion of great Er∣rours Yet even able Seamen in these Voyages are hardly made sensible of this tho' so necessary to be observed for want of duly attending to the reason of it as it happened among those of our Crew who after we had past Degrees began  to decrease the difference of declination whereas they ought still to have increased it for it all the way increased upon us  We had the Wind at N N E fair clear Wea∣ther and a brisk Gale We coasted to the West∣ward on the Southside of the Island of  Mindanao  keeping within or Leagues of the Shore The Land from hence tends away W by S It is of a good heighth by the Sea and very woody and in the Country we saw high Hills  The next Day we were abrest of  Chambongo  a Town in this Island and Leagues from the Ri∣ver of  Mindanao  Here is said to be a good Har∣bour and a great Settlement with plenty of Beef and Buffaloe It is reported that the  Spaniards  were formerly fortified here also There are two shoals lie off this place or Leagues from the Shoar From hence the Land is more low and even yet there are some Hills in the Country  About Leagues before we came to the Westend of the Island  Mindanao  we fell in with a great ma∣ny small low Islands or Keys and about two or three Leagues to the Southward of these Keys there is a long Island stretching N E and S W about Leagues This Island is low by the Sea on the Northside and has a Ridge of Hills in the mid∣dle running from one end to the other Between this Isle and the small Keys there is a good large Channel Among the Keys also there is a good depth of Water and a violent Tide but on what point of the Compass it flows I know not nor how much it riseth and falls  The th day we anchored on the Eastside of all these Keys in fathom Water clean Sand Here are plenty of green Turtle whose Flesh is as sweet as any in the  WestIndies  but they are very shy A little to the Westward of these Keys on the Island  Mindanao  we saw abundance of Coconut Trees  Therefore we sent our Canoa ashore thinking to find Inhabitants but found none nor sign of any but great Tracts of Hogs and great Cattle and close by the Sea there were Ruins of an old Fort The Walls thereof were of a good heighth built with Stone and Lime and by the Workmanship seem'd to be  Spanish  From this place the Land trends W N W and it is of an indifferent heighth by the Sea It run on this point of the Compass or Leagues and then the Land trends away N N W or Leagues farther making with many bluff Points  We weigh'd again the th day and went thro between the Keys but met such uncertain Tides that we were forced to anchor again The d day we got about the Westermost Point of all  Mindanao  and stood to the Northward plying under the Shore and having the Wind at N N E a fresh Gale As we sailed along further we found the Land to trend N N E On this part of the Island the Land is high by the Sea with full bluff Points and very woody There are some small Sandy Bays which afford Streams of fresh Water  Here we met with two Prows belonging to the  Sologues  one of the  Mindanaiin  Nations beforementioned They came from  Manila  laden with Silks and Calicoes We kept on this Western part of the Island steering Northerly till we came a∣brest of some other of the  Philippine  Islands that lay to the Northward of us then steered away towards them but still keeping on the West side of them and we had the Winds at N N E  The d of  February  we anchored in a good Bay on the West side of the Island in Lat d min where we had Fathomwater good soft Oaze This Island hath no Name that we could find in any Book but lieth on the West side of the Island  Sebo  It is about or Leagues long mountain∣ous and woody At this place Captain  Read  who was the same Captain  Swan  had so much railed a∣gainst in his Journal and was now made Captain in his room as Captain  Teat  was made Master and Mr  Henry More  QuarterMaster ordered the Car∣penters to cut down our QuarterDeck to make the Ship snug and the fitter for sailing When that was done we heeled her scrubbed her Bottom and tal∣lowed it Then we fill'd all our Water for here is a delicate small run of Water  The Land was pretty low in this Bay the Mould black and fat and the Trees of several Kinds very thick and tall In some places we found plenty of Canes such as we use in  England  for WalkingCanes These were shortjointed not above two Foot and a half or two Foot ten Inches the longest and most of them not above two Foot They run along on the Ground like a Vine or taking hold of the Trees they climb up to their very tops They are or Fathom long and much of a bigness from the Root till within or Fathom of the end They are of a pale green Colour cloathed over with a Coat of short thick hairy Substance of a dun Colour but it comes off by only drawing the Cane through your Hand We did cut many of them and they proved very tough heavy Canes  We saw no Houses nor sign of Inhabitants but while we lay here there was a Canoa with Men came into this Bay but whither they were bound or from whence they came I know not They were  Indians  and we could not understand them  In the middle of this Bay about a Mile from the Shore there is a small low woody Island not above a Mile in Circumference our Ship rode a∣bout a mile from it This Island was the Habita∣tion  of an incredible number of great Batts with Bodies as big as Ducks or large Fowl and with vast Wings For I saw at  Mindanao  one of this sort and I judge that the Wings stretcht out in length could not be less assunder than or Foot from tip to tip for it was much more than any of us could fathom with our Arms extended to the utmost The Wings are for Substance like those of other Batts of a Dun or Mouse colour The Skin or Leather of them hath Ribs running along it and draws up in or Folds and at the joints of those Ribs and the extremities of the Wings there are sharp and crooked Claws by which they may hang on any thing In the Evening as soon as the Sun was set these Creatures would begin to take their flight from this Island in swarms like Bees directing their flight over to the Main Island and whither afterwards I know not Thus we should see them rising up from the Island till Night hindred our sight and in the Morning as soon as it was light we should see them returning again like a Cloud to the small Island till Sun rising This course they kept constantly while we lay here affording us every Morning and Evening an Hour's Diversion in gazing at them and talking about them but our Curiosity did not prevail with us to go ashoar to them our selves and Ca∣noas being all the day time taken up in business a∣bout our Ship At this Isle also we found plenty of Turtle and Manatee but no Fish  We stay'd here till the th of  February  and then having compleated our Business we sailed hence with the Wind at North But going out we struck on a Rock where we lay two Hours It was very smooth Water and the Tide of Flood or else we should there have lost our Ship We struck off a great piece of our Rudder which was all the damage that we received but we more narrow∣ly  mist losing our Ships this time than in any othe  in the whole Voyage This is a very dangerou  Shoal because it does not break unless proba¦bly it may appear in foul Weather It lies about two mile to the Westward without the small Batt Island Here we found the Tide of Flood setting to the Southward and the Ebb to the North∣ward  After we were past this Shoal we Coasted along by the rest of the  Philippine  Islands keeping on the Westside of them Some of them appeared to be very Mountainous dry Land We saw many Fires in the Night as we passed by  Panay  a great Island settled by  Spaniards  and by the Fires up and down it seems to be well settled by them for this is a  Spanish  Custom whereby they give Notice of any Danger or the like from Sea and 'tis probable they had seen our Ship the day before This is an unfrequented Coast and 'tis rare to have any Ship seen there We touched not at  Panay  nor any where else tho' we saw a great many small Islands to the Westward of us and some Shoals but none of them laid down in our Draughts  The th day of  Feb  we anchored at the N W end of the Island  Mindora  in Fathomwater a∣bout quarters of a Mile from the Shore  Mindora  is a large Island the middle of it lying in Lat about Leagues long stretching N W and S E It is High and Mountainous and not very Woody At this Place where we anchored the Land was neither very high nor low There was a small Brook of Water and the Land by the Sea was very Woody and the Trees high and tall but a League or two farther in the Woods are very thin and small Here we saw great tracks of Hogs and Beef and we saw some of each and hunted them but they were wild and we could kill none  While we were here there was a Canoa with  Indians  came from  Manila  They were very shy of us a while but at last hearing us speak  Spanish  they came to us and told us that they were go∣ing to a Fryer that liv'd at an  Indian  Village to∣wards the S E end of the Island They told us also that the Harbour of  Manila  is seldom or ne∣ver without or Sail of Vessels most  Chinese  some  Portugueze  and some few the  Spaniards  have of their own They said that when they had done their business with the Fryer they would return to  Manila  and hoped to be back again at this place in Days time We told them that we came for a Trade with the  Spaniards  at  Manila  and should be glad if they would carry a Letter to some Merchant there which they promised to do But this was only a pretence of ours to get out of them what intelligence we could as to their Shipping Strength and the like under Colour of seeeking a Trade for our business was to pillage Now if we had really designed to have Traded there this was as fair an op∣portunity as Men could have desired for these Men could have brought us to the Frier that they were going to and a small Present to him would have engaged him to do any kindness for us in the way of Trade for the  Spanish  Governours do not allow of it and we must Trade by stealth  The st Day we went from hence with the wind at E N E a small gale The d Day in the Morning we were fair by the S E end of the Island  Luconia  the Place that had been so long de∣sired by us We presently saw a Sail coming from the Northward and making after her we took her in Hours time She was a  Spanish  Bark that came from a place called  Pangasanam  a small Town on the N end of  Luconia  as they told us propably the same with  Pongassinay  which lies on a Bay at the N W side of the Island She was bound to  Manila  but had no Goods aboard and therefore we turned her away  The d we took another  Spanish  Vessel that came from the same place as the other She was laden with Rice and CottonCloth and bound for  Manila  also These Goods were purposely for the  Acapulco  Ship The Rice was for the Men to live on while they lay there and in their return and the Cottoncloth was to make Sail The Master of this Prize was Boatswain of the  Acapulco  Ship which escaped us at  Guam  and was now at  Manila  It was this Man that gave us the Relation of what Strength it had how they were afraid of us there and of the accident that happen'd to them as is before mentioned in the th Chapter We took these two Vessels with∣in or Leagues of  Manila  Luconia  I have spoken of already but I shall now add this further account of it It is a great Island taking up between and degrees of Lat in length and its breadth near the middle is about Leagues but the ends are narrow The Northend lies in a∣bout d North Lat and the S end in about d m This great Island hath abundance of small Keys or Islands lying about it especially at the Northend The Southside fronts towards the rest of the  Philippine  Islands Of these that are its nearest Neighbours  Mindora  lately mentioned is the chief and gives name to the Sea or Streight that parts it and the other Islands from  Luconia  being called the Streights of  Mindora  The Body of the Island  Luconia  is composed of many spacious plain Savannahs and large Moun∣tains The Northend seems to be more plain and even I mean freer from Hills than the Southend but the Land is all along of a good heighth It does not appear so flourishing and green as some of the other Islands in this Range especially that of St  John Mindanao Batt  Island  c  yet in some  depiction of an island near Manila  A Prospect of y  e  Coa  t of y  e  I L  near Manila at  L off Shore  bearing East  depiction of the islands of Pulo Condor the Con Dao Islands of Vietnam  the Islands Pulo Condor appear at L distance bearing South  depiction of the islands and harbour of Pulo Condore the Con Dao Islands of Vietnam  depiction of the Bashee Islands Batanes Islands of the Philippines  The BASHEE Islands  places it is very Woody Some of the Mountains of this Island afford Gold and the Savannahs are well stockt with herds of Cattle especially Buaffaloes These Cattle are in great plenty all over the  EastIndies  and therefore 'tis very probable that there were many of these here even before the  Spaniards  came hither But now there are also plenty of o∣ther Cattle as I have been told as Bullocks Horses Sheep Goats Hogs  c  brought hither by the  Spaniards  It is pretty well inhabited with  Indians  most of them if not all under the  Spaniards  who now are masters of it The Native  Indians  do live together in Towns and they have Priests among them to instruct them in the  Spanish  Religion  Manila  the chief or perhaps the only City lies at the foot of a ridge of high Hills facing upon a spacious harbour near the S W point of the Island in about the Lat of d North It is environ'd with a high strong Wall and very well fortify'd with Forts and Breastworks The Houses are large strongly built and covered with Pantile The Streets are large and pretty regular with a Pa∣rade in the midst after the  Spanish  fashion There are a great many fair Buildings beside Churches and other Religious Houses of which there are not a few  The Harbour is so large that some hundreds of Ships may ride here and is never without many both of their own and strangers I have already given you an account of the two Ships going and coming between this place and  Acapulco  Besides them they have some small Vessels of their own and they do allow the  Portuguese  to trade here but the  Chinese  are the chiefest Merchants and they drive the greatest Trade for they have commonly or or Jonks in the Harbour at a time and a great many Merchants constantly residing in the City  beside Shopkeepers and Handycraftsmen in a bundance Small Vessels run up near the Town but the  Acapulco  Ships and others of greater bur then lye a league short of it where there is a strong Fort also and Storehouses to put Goods in  I had the major part of this relation or years after this time from Mr  Coppinger  our Surgeon for he made a Voyage hither from  Porto Nova  a Town on the Coast of  Coromandel  in a  Portuguese  Ship as I think Here he found or of Cap∣tain  Swan  's men some of those that we left at  Mindanao  For after we came from thence they brought a Proe there by the Instigation of an  Irish man  who went by the name of  John FitzGerald  a person that spoke  Spanish  very well and so in this their Proe they came hither They had been here but months when Mr  Coppinger  arrived here and Mr  FitzGerald  had in this time gotten a  Spanish  Mustesa Woman to Wife and a good Dowry with her He then professed Physick and Surgery and was highly esteemed among the  Spaniards  for his supposed knowledge in those Arts for being al∣ways troubled with sore Shins while he was with us he kept some Plaisters and Salves by him and with these he set up upon his bare natural stock of knowledge and his experience in Kibes But then he had a very great stock of Confidence with∣al to help out the other and being an  Irish Roman  Catholick and having the  Spanish  Language he had a great advantage of all his Consorts and he alone lived well there of them all We were not within sight of this Town but I was shewn the Hills that overlooked it and drew a draft of them as we lay off at Sea which I have caused to be engraven among a few others that I took my self  See the Table  The time of the year being now too far spent to do any thing here it was concluded to sail from hence to  Pulo Condore  a little parcel of Islands on the Coast of  Cambodia  and carry this Prize with us and there careen if we could find any conve∣nient place for it designing to return hither again by the latter end of  May  and wait for the  Aca∣pulco  Ship that comes about that time By our Drafts which we were guided by being strangers to these parts this seemed to us then to be a place out of the way where we might lye snug for a while and wait the time of returning for our Prey For we avoided as much as we could the going to lye by at any great place of Com∣merce lest we should become too much exposed and perhaps be assaulted by a Force greater than our own  So having set our Prisoners ashore we sailed from  Luconia  the th Day of  Feb  with the Wind E N E and fair Weather and a brisk Gale We were in Lat d N when we began to steer away for  Pulo Condore  and we steer'd S by W In our way thither we went pretty near the Shoals of  Pracel  and other Shoals which are very dange∣rous We were very much afraid of them but escaped them without so much as seeing them on∣ly at the very Southend of the  Pracel  Shoals we saw little sandy Islands or spots of Sand stand∣ing just above Water within a Mile of us  It was the th Day of  March  before we came in sight of  Pulo Condore  or the Island  Condore  as  Pulo  signifies The th Day about Noon we Anchored on the Northside of the Island against a sandy Bay Mile from the Shore in Fathom clean hard Sand with both Ship and Prize  Pulo Condore  is the Principal of a heap of Islands and the only inhabited one of them They lye in lat d m North and about Leagues South and  by East from the Mouth of the River of  Cambodia  These Islands lye so near together that at a di∣stance they appear to be but one Island  Two of these Islands are pretty large and of a good heighth they may be seen or Leagues at Sea the rest are but little Spots The biggest of the two which is the inhabited one is about or Leagues long and lies East and West It is not above Mile broad at the broadest place in most places not above a Mile wide The other large Island is about Mile long and half a Mile wide This Island stretcheth N and S It is so conveniently placed at the Westend of the biggest Island that between both there is formed a very commodious Harbour The entrance of this Har∣bour is on the Northside where the two Islands are near a mile asunder There are or small Keys and a good deep Channel between them and the biggest Island Towards the Southend of the Harbour the two Islands do in a manner close up leaving only a small Passage for Boats and Canoas There are no more Islands on the Northside but or on the Southside of the great Island  See the Table  The Mold of these Islands for the biggest part is blackish and pretty deep only the Hills are somewhat stony The Eastern part of the biggest Island is sandy yet all cloathed with Trees of di∣vers sorts The Trees do not grow so thick as I have seen them in some Places but they are gene∣rally large and tall and fit for any use  There is one sort of Tree much larger than any other on this Island and which I have not seen any where else It is about or Foot Diameter in the Body from whence is drawn a sort of clam∣my Juice which being boiled a little becomes per∣fect Tar and if you boil it much it will become hard as Pitch It may be put to either use we  used it both ways and found it to be very service∣able The way that they get this Juice is by cu∣ting a great gap horizontally in the Body of the Tree half through and about a Foot from the Ground and then cutting the upper part of the Body aslope inwardly downward till in the mid∣dle of the Tree it meet with the traverse cutting or plain In this plain horizontal semicircular stump they make a hollow like a Bason that may contain a Quart or two Into this hole the Juice which drains from the wounded upper part of the Tree falls from whence you must empty it every day It will run thus for some Months and then dry away and the Tree will recover again  The Fruittrees that Nature hath bestowed on these Isles are Mangoes and Trees bearing a sort of Grape and other Trees bearing a kind of wild or bastard Nutmegs These all grow wild in the Woods and in very great plenty  The Mangoes here grow on Trees as big as Ap∣pletrees Those at  Fort St George  are not so large The Fruit of these is as big as a small Peach but long and smaller towards the top It is of a yellow∣ish colour when ripe it is very juicy and of a pleasant smell and delicate taste When the Mango is young they cut them in two pieces and pickle them with Salt and Vinegar in which they put some Cloves of Garlick This is an excellent Sauce and much esteemed it is called MangoAchar  Achar  I presume signifies Sauce They make in the  EastIn∣dies  especially at  Siam  and  Pegu  several sorts of  Achar  as of the young tops of Bamboes  c  Bam∣boAchar and MangoAchar are most used The Mangoes were ripe when we were there as were also the rest of these Fruits and they have then so delicate a Fragrancy that we could smell them out in the thick Woods if we had but the wind of them while we were a good way from them and  could not see them and we generally found them out this way Mangoes are common in many Places of the  EastIndies  but I did never know any grow wild only at this Place These though not so big as those I have seen at  Achin  and at  Maderas  or  Fort St George  are yet every whit as pleasant as the best sort of their Garden Mangoes  The Grapetree grows with a strait Body of a Diameter about a Foot or more and hath but few Limbs or Boughs The Fruit grows in Clusters all about the Body of the Tree like the Jack Du∣rian and Cacao Fruits There are of them both red and white They are mueh like such Grapes as grow on our Vines both in shape and colour and they are of a very pleasant Winy taste I never saw these but on the two biggest of these Islands the rest had no Tartrees Mangoes Grapetrees nor Wild Nutmegs  The Wild Nutmegtree is as big as a Walnuttree but it does not spread so much The Boughs are gross and the Fruit grows among the Boughs as the Walnut and other Fruits This Nutmeg is much smaller than the true Nutmeg and longer also It is inclosed with a thin Shell and a sort of Mace encircling the Nut within the Shell This bastard Nutmeg is so much like the true Nutmeg in shape that at our first arrival here we thought it to be the true one but it has no manner of smell nor taste  The Animals of these Islands are some Hogs Lizards and Guanoes and some of those Crea∣tures mentioned in Chap XI which are like but much bigger than the Guano  Here are many sorts of Birds as Parrots Para∣kites Doves and Pigeons Here are also a sort of wild Cocks and Hens They are much like our tame Fowl of that kind but a great deal less for they are about the bigness of a Crow The Cocks do  crow like ours but much more small and shrill and by their crowing we do first find them out in the Woods where we shoot them Their flesh is very white and sweet  There are a great many Limpits and Muscles and plenty of green Turtle  And upon this mention of Turtle again I think it not amiss to add some reasons to strengthen the opinion that I have given concerning these Crea∣tures removing from place to place I have said in Chapter th that they leave their common feeding places and go to places a great way from thence to lay as particularly to the Island  Ascention  Now I have discoursed with some since that Subject was printed who are of opinion that when the lay∣ing time is over they never go from thence but lye somewhere in the Sea about the Island which I think is very improbable for there can be no food for them there as I could soon make appear as particularly from hence that the Sea about the Isle of  Ascention  is so deep as to admit of no ancho∣ring but at one place where there is no sign of Grass and we never bring up with our sounding Lead any Grass or Weeds out of very deep Seas but Sand or the like only But if this be granted that there is food for them yet I have a great deal of reason to believe that the Turtle go from hence for after the laying time you shall never see them and whereever Turtle are you will see them rise and hold their Head above water to breath once in or minutes or at longest in or And if any Man does but consider how Fish take their certain Seasons of the year to go from one Sea to another this would not seem strange even Fowls also having their seasons to remove from one place to another  These Islands are pretty well watered with small Brooks of fresh Water that run flush into  the Sea for Months in the Year The latter end of  March  they begin to dry away and in  April  you shall have none in the Brooks but what is lodged in deep Holes but you my dig Wells in some places In  May  when the Rain comes the Land is again replenished with Water and the Brooks run out into the Sea  These Islands lie very commodiously in the way to and from  Japan China Manila Tunquin Co∣chinchina  and in general all this most Easterly Coast of the  Indian  Continent whether you go through the Streights of  Malacca  or the Streights of  Sunda  between  Samatra  and  Java  and one of them you must pass in the common way from  Eu∣rope  or other parts of the  EastIndies  unless you mean to fetch a great Compass round most of the  EastIndia  Islands as we did Any Ship in distress may be refreshed and recruited here very conveni∣ently and besides ordinary Accommodations be furnished with Masts Yards Pitch and Tar It might also be a convenient place to usher in a Commerce with the neighbouring Country of  Co∣chinchina  and Forts might be built to secure a Fa∣ctory particularly at the Harbour which is capa∣ble of being well fortified This place therefore being upon all these Accounts so valuable and with∣al so little known I have here inserted a Draft of it which I took during our stay there  The Inhabitants of this Island are by Nation  Cochinchinese  as they told us for one of them spake good  Malayan  which Language we learnt a smat∣tering of and some of us so as to speak it pretty well while we lay at  Mindanao  and this is the com∣mon Tongue of Trade and Commerce though it be not in several of them the Native Language in most of the  EastIndia  Islands being the  Lingua Franca  as it were of these Parts I believe 'tis the vulgar Tongue at  Malacca Sumatra Java  and  Borneo  but at  Celebes  the  Philippine  Islands and the Spice Islands it seems borrowed for the carrying on of Trade  The Inhabitants of  Pulo Condore  are but a small People in Stature well enough shaped and of a darker Colour than the  Mindanayans  They are pretty long Visaged their Hair is black and streight their Eyes are but small and black their Noses of a mean bigness and pretty high their Lips thin their Teeth white and little Mouths They are very civil People but extraordinary poor Their chiefest Employment is to draw the Juice of those Trees that I have described to make Tar They preserve it in wooden Troughs and when they have their Cargo they transport it to  Cochinchina  their MotherCountry Some others of them em∣ploy themselves to catch Turtle and boil up their Fat to Oil which they also transport home These People have great large Nets with wide Mashes to catch the Turtle The  Jamaica  Turtlers have such and I did never see the like Nets but at  Jamaica  and here  They are so free of their Women that they would bring them aboard and offer them to us and many of our Men hired them for a small mat∣ter This is a Custom used by several Nations in the  EastIndies  as at  Pegu Siam Cochinchina  and  Cambodia  as I have been told It is used at  Tunquin  also to my Knowledge for I did afterwards make a Voyage thither and most of our Men had Women aboard all the time of our abode there In  Africa  also on the Coast of  Guinea  our Merchants Fa∣ctors and Seamen that reside there have their black Misses It is accounted a piece of Policy to do it for the chief Factors and Captains of Ships have the Great Mens Daughters offered them the  Mandarins  or Noblemens at  Tunquin  and even the King's Wives in  Guinea  and by this sort of Alliance  the Country people are engaged to a greater Friend∣ship And if there should arise any difference about Trade or any thing else which might provoke the Natives to seek some treacherous Revenge to which all these Heathen Nations are very prone then these  Dalilahs  would certainly declare it to their White Friends and so hinder their Country∣mens Designs  These People are Idolaters but their manner of Worship I know not There are a few scattering Houses and Plantations on the great Island and a small Village an the Southside of it where there is a little Idol Temple and an Image of an Ele∣phant about foot high and in bigness proporti∣onable placed on one side of the Temple and a Horse not so big placed on the other side of it both standing with thei  Heads towards the South The Temple it self was low and ordinary built of Wood and thatched like one of their Houses which are but very meanly  The Images of the Horse and the Elephant were the most general Idols that I observ'd in the Tem∣ples of  Tunquin  when I travell'd there There were other Images also of Beasts Birds and Fish I do not remember I saw any Humane Shape there nor any such monstrous Representations as I have seen among the  Chinese  Whereever the  Chinese  Sea∣men or Merchants come and they are very numerous all over these Seas they have always hideous Idols on board their Jonks or Ships with Altars and Lamps burning before them These Idols they bring a∣shore with them And beside those they have in common every Man hath one in his own House Upon some particular solemn Days I have seen their  Bonzies  or Priests bring whole Armfuls of painted Papers and burn them with a great deal of Ceremony being very careful to let no Piece escape them The same Day they kill'd a Goat  which had been purposely fatting a Month before this they offer or present before their Idol and then dress it and feast themselves with it I have seen them do this in  Tunquin  where I have at the same time been invited to their Feasts and at  Ban∣couli  in the Isle of  Sumatra  they sent a Shoulder of the sacrific'd Goat to the  English  who eat of it and ask'd me to do so too but I refused  When I was at  Maderas  or  Fort St George  I took notice of a great Ceremony used for several Nights successively by the Idolaters inhabiting the Suburbs Both Men and Women these very well clad in a great multitude went in solemn Procession with lighted Torches carrying their Idols about with them I knew not the meaning of it I observ'd some went purposely carrying Oyl to sprinkle into the Lamps to make them burn the brighter They began their Round about a Clock at Night and having paced it gravely about the Streets till or a Clock in the Morning their Idols were carry'd with much Ceremony into the Temple by the Chief of the Procession and some of the Women I saw enter the Temple particularly Their Idols were different from those of  Tunquin Cambodia  c being in Humane Shape  I have said already that we arrived at these Islands the th day of  March  The next day we searched about for a place to careen in and the th day we entred the Harbour and imme∣diately provided to careen Some Men were set to fell great Trees to saw into Plank others went to unrigging the Ship some made a House to put our Goods in and for the Sailmaker to work in The Country People resorted to us and brought us of the Fruits of the Island with Hogs and sometimes Turtle for which they received Rice in exchange which we had a Shipload of taken at  Manila  We bought of them also a good quantity of their  pitchy Liquor which we boiled and used about our Ship's bottom We mixed it first with Lime which we made here and it made an excellent Coat and stuck on very well  We staid in this Harbour from the th day of  March  till the th of  April  in which time we made a new Suit of Sails of the Cloth that was ta∣ken in the Prize We cut a spare Maintopmast and sawed Plank to sheath the Ship's Bottom for she was not sheathed all over at  Mindanao  and that old Plank that was left on then we now ript off and clapt on new  While we lay here of our Men died who were poison'd at  Mindanao  they told us of it when they found themselves poison'd and had linger'd ever since They were open'd by our Doctor accord∣ing to their own Request before they died and their Livers were black light and dry like pieces of Cork  Our Business being finished here we left the  Spanish  Prize taken at  Manila  and most of the Rice taking out enough for our selves and on the th day we went from hence to the place where we first anchored on the Northside of the great Island purposely to water for there was a great Stream when we first came to the Island and we thought it was so now But we found it dried up only it stood in Holes or Hogsheads or a Tun in a Hole Therefore we did immediately cut Bamboos and made Spouts through which we conveyed the Water down to the Seaside by ta∣king it up in Bowls and pouring it into these Spouts or Troughs We convey'd some of it thus near half a Mile While we were filling our Wa∣ter Captain  Read  engaged an old Man one of the Inhabitants of this Island the same who I said could speak the  Malayan  Language to be his Pilot to the Bay of  Siam  for he had often been telling  us that he was well acquainted there and that he knew some Islands there where there were Fisher∣men lived who he thought could supply us with Saltfish to eat at Sea for we had nothing but Rice to eat The Easterly Monsoon was not yet done therefore it was concluded to spend some time there and then take the advantage of the beginning of the Western Monsoon to return to  Manila  a∣gain  The st day of  April  we sailed from  Pulo Condore  directing our Course W by S for the Bay of  Siam  We had fair Weather and a fine moderate Gale of Wind at E N E  The d day we arriv'd at  Pulo Ubi  or the Island  Ubi  This Island is about Leagues to the Westward of  Pulo Condore  it lies just at the entrance of the Bay of  Siam  at the S W point of Land that makes the Bay namely the point of  Cambodia  This Island is about or Leagues round and it is high∣er Land than any of  Pulo Condore  Isles Against the SouthEast part of it there is a small Key about a Cables length from the main Island This  Pulo Ubi  is very woody and it has good Water on the Northside where you may anchor but the best anchoring is on the Eastside against a small Bay then you will have the little Island to the Southward of you  At  Pulo Ubi  we found two small Barks laden with Rice They belonged to  Cambodia  from whence they came not above two or three Days before and they touched here to fill Water Rice is the gene∣ral Food of all these Countries therefore it is transported by Sea from one Country to another as Corn in these parts of the World For in some Coun∣tries they produce more than enough for themselves and send what they can spare to those places where there is but little  The th Day we went into the Bay of  Siam  This is a large deep Bay of which and of this Kingdom I shall at present speak but little because I design a more particular account of all this Coast to wit of  Tunquin Cochinchina Siam Champa Cam∣bodia  and  Malacca  making all the most Easterly part of the Continent of  Asia  lying  South  of  China  but to do it in the Course of this Voyage would too mueh swell this Volume and I shall chuse there∣fore to give a separate Relation of what I know or have learnt of them together with the neighbouring Parts of  Sumatra Jova  c where I have spent some time  We run down into the Bay of  Siam  till we came to the Islands that our  Pulo Condore  Pilot told us of which lie about the middle of the Bay But as good a Pilot as he was he run us aground yet we had no damage Captain  Read  went ashore at these Islands where he found a small Town of Fisher∣men but they had no Fish to sell and so we re∣turned empty  We had yet fair Weather and very little Wind so that being often becalmed we were till the th day of  May  before we got to  Pulo Ubi  again There we found two small Vessels at an Anchor on the Eastside They were laden with Rice and Laquer which is used in Japanning of Cabinets One of these come from  Champa  bound to the Town of  Malacca  which belongs to the  Dutch  who took it from the  Portugueze  and this shews that they have a Trade with  Champa  This was a very pret∣ty neat Vessel her bottom very clean and curiously coated she had about Men all armed with Cor∣tans or broad Swords Lances and some Guns that went with a Swivel upon their Gunnal They were of the Idolaters Natives of  Champa  and some of the briskest most sociable without fearfulness or shyness and the most neat and dextrous about  their Shipping of any such I have met with in all my Travels The other Vessel came from the Ri∣ver of  Cambodia  and was bound towards the Streights of  Malacca  Both of them stopt here for the Wester∣ly Winds now began to blow which were against them being somewhat bleated  We anchored also on the Eastside intending to fill Water While we lay here we had very vio∣lent Wind at S W and a strong Current setting right to Windward The fiercer the Wind blew the more strong the Current set against it This Storm lasted till the th day and then it began to abate  The st day of  May  we went back from hence towards  Pulo Condore  In our way we overtook a great Jonk that came from  Palimbam  a Town on the Island  Sumatra  She was full laden with Pep∣per which they bought there and was bound to  Si∣am  but it blowing so hard she was afraid to ven∣ture into that Bay and therefore came to  Pula Con∣dore  with us where we both anchored  May  the th This Vessel was of the  Chinese  make full of little Rooms or Partitions like our Wellboats I shall de∣scribe them in the next Chapter The Men of this Jonk told us that the  English  were settled on the Island  Sumatra  at a place called  Sillabar  and the first knowledge we had that the  English  had any set∣tlement on  Sumatra  was from these  When we came to an Anchor we saw a small Bark at an Anchor near the Shore therefore Cap∣tain  Read  sent a Canoa aboard her to know from whence they came and supposing that it was a  Malaya  Vessel he ordered the Men not to go aboard for they are accounted desperate Fel∣lows and their Vessels are commonly full of Men who all wear Cressets or little Daggers by their sides The Canoas Crew not minding the Captain's Orders went aboard all but one Man that stay'd in  the Canoa The  Malayans  who were about of them seeing our Men all armed thought that they came to take their Vessel therefore at once on a Signal given they drew out their Cressets and stabbed or of our Men before they knew what the matter was The rest of our Men leapt overboard some into the Canoa and some into the Sea and so got away Among the rest one  Daniel Wal∣lis  leapt into the Sea who could never swim before nor since yet now he swam very well a good while before he was taken up When the Canoas came aboard Captain  Read  manned two Canoas and went to be revenged on the  Malayans  but they seeing him coming did cut a Hole in their Vessel's bottom and went ashore in their Boat Capt  Read  followed them but they run into the Woods and hid themselves Here we stay'd ten or eleven Days for it blew very hard all the time While we stay'd here  Herman Coppinger  our Surgeon went ashore in∣tending to live here but Captain  Read  sent some Men to fetch him again I had the same Thoughts and would have gone ashore too but waited for a more convenient place For neither he nor I when we were last on board at  Mindanao  had any know∣ledge of the Plot that was laid to leave Capt  Swan  and run away with the Ship and being sufficient∣ly weary of this mad Crew we were willing to give them the slip at any place from whence we might hope to get a passage to an  English  Factory There was nothing else of Moment happen'd while we stay'd here  CHAP XV  They leave  Pulo Condore  designing for  Mani∣la  but are driven off

their design of Cruising off  Manila  for the  Aca∣pulco  Ship and 'tis resolved to fetch a Com∣pass to Cape  Comorin  and so for the  RedSea  HAving fill'd our Water cut our Wood and got our Ship in a Sailing posture while the blustring hard Winds lasted we took the first op∣portunity of a settled Gale to Sail towards  Manila  Accordingly  June  the th we loosed from  Pulo Condore  with the Wind at S W fair Weather at a brisk Gale The  Pepper  Jonk bound to  Siam  remained there waiting for an Easterly Wind but one of his Men a kind of a bastard  Portuguese  came aboard our Ship and was entertained for the sake of his knowledge in the several Languages of these Countries The Wind continued in the S W but hours or a little more and then came about to the North and then to the N E and the Sky became exceeding clear Then the Wind came at East and lasted betwixt E and S E for or Days Yet we continued plying to Windward expecting every Day a shift of Wind because these Winds were not according to the Season of the Year  We were now afraid lest the Currents might de∣ceive us and carry us on the Shoals of  Pracel  which were near us a little to the N W but we passed on to the Eastward without seeing any sign of them yet we were kept much to the Northward of our intended course and the Easterly Winds still continuing we despaired of getting to  Manila  and therefore began to project some new design and the result was to visit the Island  Prata  about the Lat of Deg Min North and not far from us at this time  It is a small low Island environ'd with Rocks clear round it by report It lyeth so in the way between  Manila  and  Canton  the head of a Province and a Town of great Trade in  China  that the  Chi∣nese  do dread the Rocks about it more than the  Spaniards  did formerly dread  Bermudas  for many of their Jonks coming from  Manila  have been lost there and with abundance of Treasure in them as we were informed by all the  Spaniards  that ever we converst with in these parts They told us also that in these Wrecks most of the Men were drowned and that the  Chinese  did never go thi∣ther  to take upon any of the Treasure that was lost there for fear of being lost themselves But the danger of the place did not daunt us for we were resolued to try our Fortunes there if the Winds would permit and we did beat for it or Days but at last were forced to leave that Design also for want of Winds for the S E Winds continuing forced us on the Coast of  China  It was the th Day of  June  when we made the Land and running in towards the Shore we came to an Anchor the same Day on the N E end of St  John  's Island  This Island is in Lat about d min North lying on the S Coast of the Province of  Quantung  or  Canton  in  China  It is of an indifferent heighth and pretty plain and the Soil fertile enough It is partly woody partly Savannahs or Pasturage for Cattle and there is some moist arable Land for Rice The skirts or outer part of the Island espe∣cially that part of it which borders on the main Sea is woody The middle part of it is good thick grassy Pasture with some Groves of Trees and that which is cultivated Land is low wet Land yielding plentiful Crops of Rice the only Grain that I did see here The tame Cattel which this Island affords are  China  Hogs Goats Buffaloes and some Bullocks The Hogs of this Island are all black they have but small Heads very short thick Necks great Bellies commonly touching the Ground and short Legs They Eat but little Food yet they are most of them very fat probably be∣cause they Sleep much The tame Fowls are Ducks and Cocks and Hens I saw no wild Fowl but a few small Birds  The Natives of this Island are  Chinese  They are subject to the Crown of  China  and consequently at this time to the  Tartars  The  Chinese  in general are tall straitbodied rawboned Men They  are long Visaged and their Foreheads are high but they have little Eyes Their Noses are pretty large with a rising in the middle Their Mouths are of a mean size pretty thin Lips They are of an ashy Complexion their Hair is black and their Beards thin and long for they pluck the Hair out by the Roots suffering only some few very long straggling Hairs to grow about their Chin in which they take great pride often combing them and sometimes tying them up in a knot and they have such Hairs too growing down from each side of their upper Lip like Whiskers The ancient  Chinese  were very proud of the Hair of their Heads letting it grow very long and stroking it back with their Hands curiously and then winding the plats all together round a Bodkin thrust through it at the hinder part of the Head and both Men and Women did thus But when the  Tartars  con∣quer'd them they broke them of this custom they were fond of by main force insomuch that they resented this Imposition worse than their subjecti∣on and rebelled upon it but being still worsted were forc'd to acquiesce and to this day they follow the fashion of their Masters the  Tartars  and shave all their Heads only reserving one lock which some tye up others let it hang down to a great or small length as they please The  Chinese  in other Countries still keep their old custom but if any of the  Chinese  is found wearing long Hair in  China  he forfeits his Head and many of them have abandoned their Country to preserve their liberty of wearing their Hair as I have been told by themselves  The  Chinese  have no Hats Caps or Turbans but when they walk abroad they carry a small Umbrello in their Hands wherewith they fence their Head from the Sun or the Rain by holding it over their Heads If they walk but a little way  they carry only a large Fan made of Paper or Silk of the same fashion as those our Ladies have and many of them are brought over hither one of these every Man carries in his Hand if he do but cross the Street skreening his Head with it if he hath not an Umbrello with him  The common Apparel of the Men is a loose Frock and Breeches They seldom were Stock∣ings but they have Shoes or a sort of Slippers ra∣ther The Mens Shoes are made diversly The Women have very small Feet and consequently but little Shoes for from their Infancy their Feet are kept swathed up with Bands as hard as they can possibly endure them and from the time they can go till they have done growing they bind them up every night This they do purposely to hin∣der them from growing esteeming little Feet to be a great Beauty But by this unreasonable Custom they do in a manner lose the use of their Feet and instead of going they only stumble about their Houses and presently squat down on their Breeches again being as it were con∣fined to sitting all Days of their Lives They sel∣dom stir abroad and one would be apt to think that as some have conjectured their keeping up their fondness for this Fashion were a Stratagem of the Mens to keep them from gadding and gossip∣ping about and confine them at home They are kept constantly to their work being fine NeedleWomen and making many curious Embroideries and they make their own Shoes but if any Stran∣ger be desirous to bring away any for Novelty's sake he must be a great Favourite to get a pair of Shoes of them though he give twice their value The poorer sort of Women trudge about Streets and to the Market without Shoes or Stockings and these cannot afford to have little Feet being to get their living with them  The  Chinese  both Men and Women are very in∣genious as may appear by the many curious things that are brought from thence especially the  Porce∣laine  or  China  Earthen Ware The  Spaniards  of  Manila  that we took on the Coast of  Luconia  told me that this Commodity is made of Conchshells the inside of which looks like Mother of Pearl But the  Portuguese  lately mentioned who had lived in  China  and spoke that and the neighbouring Lan∣guages very well said That it was made of a fine sort of Clay that was dug in the Province of  Can∣ton  I have often made enquiry about it but could never be well satisfied in it But while I was on the Coast of  Canton  I forgot to inquire about it They make very fine Lacquerware also and good Silks and they are curious at Painting and Carring  China  affords Drugs in great abundance especi∣ally  ChinaRoot  but this is not  culiar to that Country alone for there is much of this Root growing at  Jamaica  particularly at  mile walk  and in the Bay of  Honduras  it is very plentiful There is great store of Sugar made in this Coun∣try and Tea in abundance is brought from thence being much used there and in  Tunquin  and  Cochin∣china  as common drinking Women sitting in the Streets and selling Dishes of Tea hot and ready made they call it  Chau  and even the poorest People sip it But the Tea at  Tonqueen  or  Cochinchina  seems not so good or of so pleasant a bitter or of so fine a colour or such virtue as this in  China  for I have drank of it in these Countries unless the fault be in their way of making it for I made none there my self and by the high red colour it looks as if they made a Decoction of it or kept it stale Yet at  Japan  I was told there is a great deal of pure Tea very good  The  Chinese  are very great Gamesters and they will never be tired with it playing night and day  till they have lost all their Estates then it is usual with them to hang themselves This was fre∣quently done by the  Chinese  Factors at  Manila  as I was told by  Spaniards  that lived there The  Spani∣ards  themselves are much addicted to Gaming and are very expert at it but the  Chinese  are too subtle for them being in general a very cunning People  But a particular Account of them and their Country would fill a Volume nor doth my short Experience of them qualify me to say much of them Wherefore I confine my self chiefly to what I observ'd at St  John  's Island where we lay some time and visited the shore every day to buy Provision as Hogs Fowls and Buffaloe Here was a small Town standing in a wet swampy Ground with many filthy Ponds amongst the Houses which were built on the Ground as ours are not on Posts as at  Mindanao  In these Ponds were plenty of Ducks the Houses were small and low and covered with Thatch and the inside were but ill furnished and kept nastily and I have been told by one who was there that most of the Houses in the City of  Canton  it self are but poor and irregular  The Inhabitants of this Village seem to be most Husbandmen They were at this time very busy in Sowing their Rice which is their chiefest Com∣modity The Land in which they choose to Sow the Rice is low and wet and when Plowed the Earth was like a mass of Mud They plow their Land with a small Plow drawn by one Buffaloe and one Man both holds the Plow and drives the Beast When the Rice is ripe and gathered in they tread it out of the Ear with Buffaloes in a large round place made with a hard floor fit for that purpose where they chain or of these Beasts one at the tail of the other and driving them round in a ring as in a Horsemill they so order  it that the Buffaloes may tread upon it all  I was once ashore at this Island with or En∣glish Men more and having occasion to stay some time we killed a Shote or young Porker and roasted it for our Dinners While we were busie dressing of our Pork one of the Natives came and sat down by us and when the Dinner was ready we cut a good piece and gave it him which he willingly received But by Signs he begged more and withal pointed into the Woods yet we did not understand his meaning nor much mind him till our Hunger was pretty well asswaged although he did still make Signs and walking a little way from us he beckoned to us to come to him which at last I did and or more He going before led the way in a small blind Path through a Thicket into a small Grove of Trees in which there was an old Idol Temple about foot square The Walls of it were about Foot high and Foot thick made of Bricks The Floor was paved with broad Bricks and in the middle of the Floor stood an old rusty Iron Bell on its Brims This Bell was about two Foot high standing flat on the Ground the Brims on which it stood were about Inches diameter From the brims it did taper away a lit∣tle towards the Head much like our Bells but that the Brims did not turn out so much as ours do On the Head of the Bell there were Iron Bars as big as a Man's Arm and about Inches long from the top of the Bell where the ends join'd as in a Center and seemed of one Mass with the Bell as if Cast toge∣ther These Bars stood all Parallel to the Ground and their further ends which stood Triangularly and opening from each other at equal Distances like the Fliers of our KitchenJacks were made exactly in the shape of the Paw of some mon∣strous Beast having sharp Claws on it This it seems was their God for as soon as our zealous  Guide came before the Bell he fell flat on his Face and beckoned to us seeming very desirous to have us do the like At the inner side of the Temple  against the Walls there was an Altar of white hewn Stone The Table of the Altar was about Foot long Inches broad and Inches thick It was raised about two Foot from the Ground and supported by small Pillars of the same white Stone On this Altar there were several small Earthen Vessels one of them was full of small Sticks that had been burned at one end Our Guide made a great many Signs for us to fetch and to leave some of our Meat there and seemed very importunate but we refused We left him there and went aboard I did see no other Tem∣ple nor Idol here  While we lay at this Place we saw several small  China  Jonks Sailing in the  Lagune  between the Islands and the Main one came and anchored by us I and some more of our Men went aboard to view her She was built with a square flat Head as well as Stern only the Head or forepart was not so broad as the Stern On her Deck she had little thacht Houses like Hovels cover'd with Palmeto Leaves and raised about Foot high for the Sea∣men to creep into She had a pretty large Cabin wherein there was an Altar and a Lamp burning I did but just look in and saw not the Idol The Hold was divided in many small Partitions all of them made so tight that if a Leak should Spring up in any one of them it could go no farther and so could do but little Damage but only to the Goods in the bottom of that Room where the Leak springs up Each of these Rooms belong to one or two Merchants or more and every Man freights his Goods in his own Room and probably Lodges there if he be on Board himself These Jonks have only two Masts a Mainmast and a Foremast The  foremast has a square Yard and a square Sail but the Mainmast has a Sail narrow aloft like a SloopsSail and in fair Weather they use a Topsail which is to hale down on the Deck in foul weather Yard and all for they do not go up to furl it The Mainmast in their biggest Jonks seemed to me as big as any thirdrate Man of Wars Mast in  England  and yet not pieced as ours but made of one grown Tree and in all my Travels I never saw any single Treemasts so big in the Body and so long and yet so well tapered as I have seen in the  Chine  e  Jonks  Some of our Men went over to a pretty large Town on the Continent of  China  where we might have furnished our Selves with Provision which was a thing we were always in want of and was our chief Business here but we were afraid to lye in this Place any longer for we had some signs of an approaching Storm this being the time of the Year in which Storms are expected on this Coast and here was no safe Riding It was now the time of the Year for the S W Monsoon but the Wind had been whistling about from one part of the Compass to another for two or three Days and sometimes it would be quite calm This caused us to put to Sea that we might have Searoom at least for such flattering Weather is commonly the forerunner of a Tempest  Accordingly we weighed Anchor and set out yet we had very little Wind all the next night But the Day ensuing which was the th day of  July  about a clock in the afternoon the Wind came to the N E and freshned upon us and the Sky look'd very black in that quarter and the black Clouds began to rise apace and mov'd towards us having hung all the morning in the Horizon This made us take in our Topsails and the Wind still increa∣sing about a clock we rift our Mainsail and Fore∣sail  at we furl'd our Foresail keeping under a Mainsail and Mizen At a clock we furl'd our Mainsail and ballasted our Mizen at which time it began to rain and by a clock at night it blew exceeding hard and the Rain poured down as through a Sieve It thundered and lightned pro∣digiously and the Sea seemed all of a Fire about us for every Sea that broke sparkled like Light∣ning The violent Wind raised the Sea presently to a great heighth and it ran very short and be∣gan to break in on our Deck One Sea struck a∣way the Rails of our Head and our SheetAnchor which was stowed with one Flook or bending of the Iron over the Ships Gunal and lasht very well down to the side was violently washt off and had like to have struck a hole in our Bow as it lay beating against it Then we were forced to put right before the Wind to stow our Anchor again which we did with much ado but afterwards we durst not adventure to bring our Ship to the Wind again for fear of foundring for the turning the Ship either to or fro from the Wind is dangerous in such violent Storms The fierceness of the Wea∣ther continued till a clock that morning in which time we did cut away two Canoas that were tow∣ing astern  After four a clock the Thunder and the Rain abated and then we saw a  Corpus Sant  at our Maintopmast head on the very top of the truck of the Spindle This sight rejoyc'd our Men exceedingly for the heighth of the Storm is commonly over when the  Corpus Sant  is seen aloft but when they are seen lying on the Deck it is generally accounted a bad Sign  A  Corpus Sant  is a certain small glittering light when it appears as this did on the very top of the Mainmast or at a Yardarm it is like a Star but when it appears on the Deck it resembles a great Glow∣worm  The  Spaniards  have another Name for it though I take even this to be a  Spanish  or  Portuguese  Name and a corruption only of  Corpus Sanctum  and I have been told that when they see them they presently go to Prayers and bless themselves for the happy sight I have heard some ignorant Sea∣men discoursing how they have seen them creep or as they say travel about in the Scuppers telling many dismal Stories that hapned at such times but I did never see any one stir out of the place where it was first fixt except upon Deck where every Sea washeth it about Neither did I ever see any but when we have had hard Rain as well as Wind and therefore do believe it is some Jelly but e∣nough of this  We continued scudding right before Wind and Sea from till a Clock in the Morning and then the Wind being much abated we set our Mizen again and brought our Ship to the Wind and lay under a Mizen till Then it fell flat calm and it continued so for about Hours but the Sky looked very black and rueful especially in the S W and the Sea tossed us about like an Eggshell for want of Wind About one a Clock in the After∣noon the Wind sprung up at S W out of the quar∣ter from whence we did expect it therefore we presently brail'd up our Mizen and wore our Ship but we had no sooner put our Ship before the Wind but it blew a Storm again and rain'd very hard though not so violently as the Night before but the Wind was altogether as boysterous and so continued till or a Clock at Night All which time we scudded or run before the Wind very swift tho' only with our bare Poles that is with∣out any Sail abroad Afterwards the Wind died away by degrees and before Day we had but little Wind and sine clear Weather  I was never in such a violent Storm in all my Life  so said all the Company This was near the chang  of the Moon it was or days before the change  The th day in the Morning having fine handsom  Weather we got up our Yards again and began to dry our Selves and our Cloaths for we were all well sopt This Storm had deadned the Hearts of our Men so much that instead of going to buy more Provision at the same place from whence we came before the Storm or of seeking any more for the Island  Prata  they thought of going somewhere to shelter before the Full Moon for fear of another such Storm at that time For commonly if there is any very bad Weather in the Month it is about or Days before or after the Full or Change of the Moon  These Thoughts I say put our Men on thinking where to go and the Drafts or Seaplats being first consulted it was concluded to go to certain Islands lying in Lat d N called  Piscadores  For there was not a Man aboard that was any thing acquaint∣ed on these Coasts and therefore all our depen∣dance was on the Drafts which only pointed out to us where such and such Places or Islands were without giving us any account what Harbour Roads or Bays there were or the Produce Strength or Trade of them these we were forced to seek after our selves  The  Piscadores  are a great many inhabited Islands lying near the Island  Formosa  between it and  China  in or near the Lat of deg N Lat almost as high as the Tropick of  Cancer  These  Piscadore  Islands are moderately high and appear much like our  Dorset∣shire  and  WiltshireDowns  in  England  They produce thick short Grass and a few Trees They are pretty well watred and they feed abundance of Goats and some great Cattle There are abun∣dance of Mounts and old Fortifications on them  but of no use now whatever they have been  Between the Eastermost Islands there is a very good Harbour which is never without Jonks Ri∣ding in it And on the Westside of the Eastermost Island there is a large Town and Fort commanding the Harbour The Houses are but low yet well built and the Town makes a sine Prospect This is a Garrison of the  Tartars  wherein are also or Soldiers who live here years and then they are remov'd to some other Place  On the Island on the Westside of the Har∣bour close by the Sea there is a small Town of  Chinese  and most of the other Islands have some  Chinese  living on them more or less  Having as I said before concluded to go to these Islands we steered away for them having the Wind at W S W a small gale The th day of  July  we had first sight of them and steered in among them finding no place to anchor in till we came into the Harbour beforementioned We blundering in knowing little of our way and we admired to see so many Jonks going and coming and some at an Anchor and so great a Town as the Neighbouring Eastermost Town the  Tartarian  Garrison for we did not expect nor desire to have seen any People being in care to lie con∣ceal'd in these Seas however seeing we were here we boldly run into the Harbour and presently sent ashore our Canoa to the Town  Our People were met by an Officer at their Landing and our Quartermaster who was the chiefest Man in the Boat was conducted before the Governour and examined of what Nation we were and what was our Business here He an∣swer'd That we were English and were bound to  Amoy  or  Anhay  which is a City standing on a Na∣vigable River in the Province of  Fokien  in  China  and is a place of vast Trade there being a huge multi∣tude  of Ships there and in general on all these Coasts as I have heard of several that have been there He said also that having received some Damage by a Storm we therefore put in here to refit before we could adventure to go farther and that we did intend to lie here till after the full Moon for fear of another Storm The Go∣vernour told him that we might better refit our Ship at  Amoy  than here and that he heard that two English Vessels were arrived there already and that he should be very ready to assist us in any thing but we must not expect to Trade there but must go to the places allowed to entertain MerchantStrangers which were  Amoy  and  Macao Macao  is a Town of great Trade also lying in an Island at the very Mouth of the River of  Canton  'Tis fortified and garrisoned by a large  Portuguese  Colony but yet under the  Chinese  Governour whose People inhabit one Moiety of the Town and lay on the  Portuguese  what Tax they please for they dare not disoblige the  Chinese  for fear of losing their Trade However the Governour very kindly told our Quartermaster that whatsoever we wanted if that place could furnish us we should have it Yet that we must not come ashore on that Island but he would send aboard some of his Men to know what we wanted and they should also bring it off to us That nevertheless we might go on shore on other Islands to buy Refreshments of the  Chinese  After the Discourse was ended the Governour dismist him with a small Jar of Flower and or large Cakes of very fine Bread and about a dozen PineApples and WaterMelons all very good in their kind as a Present to the Captain  The next day an eminent Officer came aboard with a great many Attendants He wore a black Silk Cap of a particular make with a Plume of  black and white Feathers standing up almost round his Head behind and all his outside Cloaths were black Silk He had a loose black Coat which reached to his Knees and his Breeches were of the same and underneath his Coat he had two Garments more of other coloured Silk His Legs were covered with small black limber Boots All his Attendants were in a very handsom garb of black Silk all wearing those small black Boots and Caps These Caps were like the Crown of a Hat made of Palmetoleaves like our Strawhats but without brims and coming down but to their Ears These had no Feathers but had an oblong Button on the top and from between the Button and the Cap there fell down all round their Head as low as the Cap reached a sort of course Hair like Horsehair dyed as I suppose of a light red colour  The Officer brought aboard as a present from the Governour a young Heifer the fattest and kindliest Beef that I did ever taste in any Foreign Country 'Twas small yet full grown large Hogs Goats Baskets of fine Flower great flat Cakes of fine well tasted Bread great Jars of Arack made of Rice as I judged called by the  Chinese Sam Shu  and Jars of  Hoc Shu  as they call it and our  Europeans  from them This is a strong Liquor made of Wheat as I have been told It looks like Mum and tastes much like it and is very pleasant and hearty Our Seamen love it mightily and will lick their Lips with it for scarce a Ship goes to  China  but the Men come home fat with soaking this Liquor and bring store of Jars of it home with them It is put into small white thick Jars that hold near a quart The double Jars hold about two quarts These Jars are small below and thence rise up with a pretty full belly closing in pretty short at top with a small thick mouth Over  the mouth of the Jar they put a thin Chip cut round just so as to cover the mouth over that a piece of Paper ayd over that they put a great lump of Clay almost as big as the Bottle or Jar it self with a hollow in it to admit the neck of the Bottle made round and about inches long this is to preserve the Liquor If the Liquor take any vent it will be sowre presently so that when we buy any of it of the Ships from  China  returning to  Maderas  or Fort St  George  where it is then sold or o the  Chinese  themselves of whom I have bought it at  Achin  and  Bencouli  in  Sumatra  if the Clay be crackt or the Liquor motherly we make them take it again A quart Jar there is worth Sixpence Besides this Present from the Governor there was a Captain of a Jonk sent two Jars of  Arack  and abundance of Pineapples and Watermelons  Captain  Read  sent ashore as a Present to the Governor a curious  Spanish  Silverhilted Rapier an  English  Carbine and a Gold Chain and when the Officer went ashore three Guns were fired In the Afternoon the Governour sent off the same Officer again to complement the Captain for his Civility and promised to retaliate his kindness before we departed but we had such blustring Weather afterward that no Boat could come a∣board  We stayed here till the th Day and then sailed from hence with the Wind at S W and pretty fair Weather We now directed our course for some Islands we had chosen to go to that lye be∣tween  Formosa  and  Luconia  They are laid down in our Plots without any name only with a figure of denoting the number of them It was sup∣posed by us that these Islands had no Inhabitants because they had not any name by our Hydrogra∣phers Therefore we thought to lye there secure and be pretty near the Island  Luconia  which we did still intend to visit  In going to them we sailed by the South West end of  Formosa  leaving it on our Larboardside This is a large Island the Southend is in Lat d m and the Northend in the d m North Lat the Longitude of this Isle is laid down from d m to d m reckoning East from the Pike of  Tenariffe  so that 'tis but narrow and the Tropick of  Cancer  crosses it It is a High and Woody Island and was formerly well inhabited by the  Chinese  and was then frequently visited by English Mer∣chants there being a very good Harbour to secure their Ships But since the  Tartars  have conquered  China  they have spoiled the Harbour as I have been informed to hinder the  Chinese  that were then in Rebellion from Fortifying themselves there and ordered the Foreign Merchants to come and Trade on the Main  The sixth day of  August  we arrived at the five Islands that we were bound to and anchored on the Eastside of the Northermost Island in Fa∣thom a Cable's length from the Shore Here con∣trary to our Expectation we found abundance of Inhabitants in sight for there were large Towns all within a League of the Sea and another larger Town than any of the three on the backside of a small Hill close by also as we found afterwards These Islands lie in Lat d m North Lat by my Observation for I took it there and I find their Longitude according to our Drafts to be d m These Islands having no particular Names in the Drafts some or other of us made use of the Seamens priviledge to give them what Names we pleased Three of the Islands were pretty large the Westermost is the biggest This the Dutchmen who were among us called the Prince of  Orange  's Island in honour of his present Ma∣jesty It is about or Leagues long and about two Leagues wide and it lies almost N and S  The other two great Islands are about or Leagues to the Eastward of this The Northermost of them where we first anchored I called the Duke of  Grafton  's Isle as soon as we landed on it ha∣ving married my Wfe out of his Dutchess's Fami∣ly and leaving her at  Arlingtonhouse  at my going Abroad This Isle is about Leagues long and one League and a half wide stretching North and South The other great Island onr Seamen called the Duke of  Monmouth  's Island This is about a League to the Southward of  Grafton  Isle It is about Leagues long and a League wide lying as the other Between  Monmouth  and the South end of  Orange  Island there are two small Islands of a roundish Form lying East and West The Eastermost Island of the two our Men unanimously cal∣led  Boshee  Island from a Liquor which we drank there plentifully every day after we came to an Anchor at it The other which is the smallest of all we called  Goat  Island from the great num∣ber of Goats there and to the Northward of them all are two high Rocks  Orange  Island which is the biggest of them all is not Inhabited It is high Land flat and even on the top with steep Cliffs against the Sea for whichReason we could not go ashore there as we did on all the rest  I have made it my general Observation That where the Land is fenced with steep Rocks and Cliffs against the Sea there the Sea is very deep and seldom affords Anchorground and on the other side where the Land falls away with a de∣clivity into the Sea altho' the Land be extraordi∣nary high within yet there are commonly good Soundings and consequently Anchoring and as the visible declivity of the Land appears near or at the edge of the Water whether pretty steep or more stoping so we commonly find our Anchor∣ground  to be more or less deep or steep there∣fore we come nearer the Shore or anchor farther off as we see convenient for there is no Coast in the World that I know or have heard of where the Land is of a continual heighth without some small Valleys or Declivities which lye inter∣mixt with the high Land They are the subsi∣dings of Valleys or low Lands that make Dents in the Shore and Creeks small Bays and Harbours or little Coves  c  which afford good anchoring the surface of the Earth being there lodged deep under Water Thus we find many good Harbours on such Coasts where the Land bounds the Sea with steep Cliffs by reason of the Declivities or subsiding of the Land between these Cliffs But where the Declension from the Hills or Cliffs is not within Land between Hill and Hill but as on the Coast of  Chili  and  Peru  the Declivity is to∣ward the Main Sea or into it the Coast being perpendicular or very steep from the neighbouring Hills as in those Countries from the  Andes  that run along the Shore  there  is a deep Sea and few or no Harbours or Creeks All that Coast is too steep for anchoring and hath the fewest Roads sit for Ships of any Coast I know The Coasts of  Gallicia Portugal Norway  and  Newsoundland  c are Coasts like the  Peruvian  and the high Islands of the  Archipelago  but yet not so scanty of good Harbours for where there are short Ridges of Land there are good Bays at the extremities of those Ridges where they plunge into the Sea as on the Coast of  Caraccos  c The Island of  John Fernando  and the Island St  Helena  c are such high Land with deep Shore and in general the plunging of any Land under Water seems to be in proportion to the rising of its continuous part above Water more or less steep and it must be a bottom almost level or very gently declining  that affords good Anchoring Ships being soon driven from their Moorings on a steep Bank Therefore we never strive to anchor where we see the Land high and bounding the Sea with steep Cliffs and for this reason when we came in sight of  States  Island near  Terra del Fuego  before we entred into the South Seas we did not so much as think of anchoring after we saw what Land it was because of the steep Cliffs which appeared a∣gainst the Sea Yet there might be little Harbours or Coves for Shallops or the like to anchor in which we did not see or search after  As high steep Cliffs bounding on the Sea have this ill consequence that they seldom afford an∣choring so they have this benefit that we can see them far off and sail close to them without dan∣ger for which reason we call them Bold Shores whereas low Land on the contrary is seen but a little way and in many places we dare not come near it for fear of running aground before we see it Besides there are in many places Shoals thrown out by the course of great Rivers that from the low Land fall into the Sea  This which I have said that there is usually good anchoring near low Lands may be illustra∣ted by several Instances Thus on the South side of the Bay of  Campeachy  there is mostly low Land and there also is good anchoring all along Shore and in some Places to the Eastward of the Town of  Campeachy  we shall have so many Fathom as we are Leagues off from Land that is from or Leagues distance till you come within Leagues and from thence to Land it grows but shallower The Bay of  Honduras  also is low Land and con∣tinues mostly so as we past along from thence to the Coasts of  Portobel  and  Cartagena  till we came as high as  Santa Martha  afterwards the Land is low again till you come towards the Coast of  Caraccos  which is a high Coast and bold Shore The Land about  Surinam  on the same Coast is low and good anchoring and that over on the Coast of  Guinea  is such also And such too is the Bay of  Panama  where the PilotBook orders the Pilot always to sound and not to come within such a depth be it by Night or Day In the same Seas from the high Land of  Guitimala  in  Mexico  t  California  there is mostly low Land and good An∣choring In the Main of  Asia  the Coast of  China  the Bay of  Siam  and  Bengal  and all the Coast of  Coromandel  and the Coast about  Malacca  and a∣gainst it the Island  Sumatra  on that side are most∣ly low anchoring Shores But on the Westside of  Sumatra  the Shore is high and bold so most of the Islands lying to the Eastward of  Sumatra  as the Islands  Borneo Celebes Gilolo  and abundance of Islands of less note lying scattering up and down those Seas are low Land and have good anchoring about them with many Shoals scattered to and fro among them but the Islands lying against the  EastIndian  Ocean especially the Westsides of them are high Land and steep particularly the Westparts not only of  Sumatra  but also of  Java Timer c  Particulars are endless but in general 'tis seldom but high Shores and deep Wa∣ters and on the other side low Land and shallow Seas are found together  But to return from this Digression to speak of the rest of these Islands  Monmouth  and  Grafton  Isles are very hilly with many of those steep in∣habited Precipies on them that I shall describe particularly The two small Islands are flat and even only the  Bashee  Island hath one steep scrag∣gy Hill but  Goat  Island is all flat and very e∣ven  The Mold of these Islands in the Valley is blackish in some places but in most red The  Hills are very rocky The Valleys are well wa∣tered with Brooks of fresh Water which run into the Sea in many different places The Soil is in∣different fruitful especially in the Valleys pro∣ducing pretty great plenty of Trees tho' not very big and thick Grass The sides of the Mountains have also short Grass and some of the Mountains have Mines within them for the Natives told us That the yellow Metal they shewed us as I shall speak more particularly came from these Moun∣tains for when they held it up they would point towards them  The Fruit of the Islands are a few Plantains Bonanoes Pineapples Pumkins Sugarcanes  c  and there might be more if the Natives would for the Ground seems fertile enough Here are great plenty of Potatoes and Yames which is the com∣mon Food for the Natives for Breadkind For those few Plantains they have are only used as Fruit They have some Cotton growing here of the small Plants  Here are plenty of Goats and abundance of Hogs but few Fowls either wild or tame For this I have always observed in my Travels both in the  East  and  West Indies  that in those Places where there is plenty of Grain that is of Rice in one and Maiz in the other there are also found great abundance of Fowls but on the contrary few Fowls in those Countries where the Inhabitants feed on Fruits and Roots only The few wild Fowls that are here are Parakites and some other small Birds Their tame Fowl are only a few Cocks and Hens  Monmouth  and  Grafton  Islands are very thick in∣habited and  Bashee  Island hath one Town on it The Natives of these Islands are short squat People they are generally round visaged with low Foreheads and thick Eyebrows their Eyes of a ha∣zel  colour and small yet bigger than the  Chinese  short low Noses and their Lip and Mouths middle proportioned Their Teeth are white their Hair is black and thick and lank which they wear but short it will just cover their Ears and so it is cut round very even Their Skins are of a very dark copper colour  They wear no Hat Cap nor Turbat nor any thing to keep off the Sun The Men for the biggest part have only a small Clout to cover their Naked∣ness some of them have Jackets made of Plantain∣leaves which were as rough as any Bear'sskin I never saw such rugged Things The Women have a short Petticoat made of Cotton which comes a little below their Knees It is a thick sort of stubborn Cloth which they make themselves of their Cotton Both Men and Women do wear large Earrings made of that yellow Metal before mentioned Whether it were Gold or no I cannot positively say I took it to be so it was heavy and of the colour of our paler Gold I would fain have brought away some to have satisfied my Curiosity but I had nothing wherewith to buy any Captain  Read  bought two of these Rings with some Iron of which the People are very greedy and he would have bought more thinking he was come to a very fair Market but that the paleness of the Metal made him and his Crew distrust its being right Gold For my part I should have ventured on the purchase of some but having no property in the Iron of which we had great store on board sent from  England  by the Merchants along with Captain  Swan  I durst not barter it away  These Rings when first polished look very glo∣riously but time makes them fade and turn to a pale yellow Then they make a soft Paste of red Earth and smearing it over their Rings they cast them into a quick Fire where they remain till they  be red hot then they take them out and cool them in Water and rub off the Past and they look again of a glorious Colour and Lustre  These People make but small low Houses The sides which are made of small Posts watled with Boughs are not above foot and a half high the Ridgepole is about or foot high They have a Fireplace at one end of their Houses and Boards placed on the Ground to lye on They inhabit to∣gether in small Villages built on the sides and tops of rocky Hills or rows of Houses one a∣bove another and on such steep Precipices that they go up to the first Row with a wooden Ladder and so with a Ladder still from every Story up to that above it there being no way to ascend The Plain on the first Precipice may be so wide as to have room both for a Row of Houses that stand all along on the Edge or Brink of it and a very narrow Street running along before their Doors between the Row of Houses and the foot of the next Preci∣pice the Plain of which is in a manner level to the tops of the Houses below and so for the rest The common Ladder to each Row or Street comes up at a narrow Passage left purposely about the middle of it and the Street being bounded with a Precipice also at each end 'tis but drawing up the Ladder if they be assaulted and then there is no coming at them from below but by climbing up as against a perpindicular Wall And that they may not be assaulted from above they take care to build on the side of such a Hill whose backside hangs over the Sea or is some high steep per∣pendicular Precipice altogether inaccessible These Precipices are natural for the Rocks seem too hard to work on nor is there any sign that Art hath been employed about them On  Bashee  Island there is one such and built upon with its back next the Sea  Grafton  and  Monmouth  Isles are very  thick set with these Hills and Towns and the Natives whether for fear of Pirates or Foreign Enemies or Factions among their own Clans care not for Building but in these Fastnesses which I take to be the Reason that  Orange  Isle though the largest and as Fertile as any yet being Level and exposed hath no Inhabitants I never saw the like Precipices and Towns  These People are pretty Ingenious also in build∣ing Boats Their small Boats are much like our  Deal  Yalls but not so big and they are built with very narrow Plank pinn'd with wooden Pins and some Nails They have also some pretty large Boats which will carry or Men These they Row with or Oars of a side They are built much like the small ones and they Row dou∣bled Banked that is two Men setting on one Bench but one Rowing on one side the other on the other side of the Boat They understand the use of Iron and work it themselves Their Bel∣lows are like those at  Mindanao  The common Imployment for the Men is Fish∣ing but I did never see them catch much Whe∣ther it is more plenty at other times of the Year I know not The Women do manage their Planta∣tions  I did never see them kill any of their Goats or Hogs for themselves yet they would beg the Panches of the Goats that they themselves did sell to us And if any of our surly Seamen did heave them into the Sea they would take them up again and the Skins of the Goats also They would not meddle with Hogsguts if our Men threw away any beside what they made Chitterlings and Sausages of The Goatskins these People would carry ashore and making a Fire they would singe off all the Hair and afterwards let the Skin lie and Pearch on the Coals till they thought it eatable and then they  would knaw it and tear it in pieces with their Teeth and at last swallow it The Paunches of the Goats would make them an excellent Dish they drest it in this manner They would turn out all the chopt Grass and Crudities found in the Maw in∣to their Pots and set it over the Fire and stir it about often This would Smoak and Puff and heave up as it was Boyling wind breaking out of the Ferment and making a very savory Stink While this was doing if they had any Fish as com∣monly they had or small Fish these they would make very clean as hating Nastiness belike and cut the Flesh from the Bone and then mince the Flesh as small as possibly they could and when that in the Pot was well boiled they would take it up and strewing a little Salt into it they would eat it mixt with their raw minced Flesh The Dung in the Maw would look like so much boil'd Herbs mine'd very small and they took up their Mess with their Fingers as the  Moors  do their Pilaw using no Spoons  They had another Dish made of a sort of Locusts whose Bodies were about an Inch and an half long and as thick as the top of one's little Finger with large thin Wings and long and small Legs At this time of the Year these Creatures came in great Swarms to devour their Potatoleaves and other Herbs and the Natives would go out with small Nets and take a Quart at one sweep When they had enough they would carry them home and Parch them over the Fire in an earthen Pan and then their Wings and Legs would fall off and their Heads and Backs would turn red like boil'd Shrimps being before brownish Their Bodies being full would eat very moist their Heads would crackle in one's Teeth I did once eat of this Dish and liked it well enough but their other Dish my Stomach would not take  Their common Drink is Water as it is of all other  Indians  Beside which they make a sort of Drink with the Juice of the Sugarcane which they boil and put some small black sort of Berries among it When it is well boiled they put it into great Jars and let it stand or days and work Then it settles and becomes clear and is present∣ly fit to drink This is an excellent Liquor and very much like  English  Beer both in Colour and Taste It is very strong and I do believe very wholesome For our Men who drank briskly of it all day for several Weeks were frequently drunk with it and never sick after it The Natives brought a vast deal of it every day to those aboard and ashore For some of our Men were ashore at work on  Bashee  Island which Island they gave that Name to from their drinking this Liquor there that be∣ing the Name which the Natives call'd this Liquor by and as they sold it to our Men very cheap so they did not spare to drink it as freely And in∣deed from the plenty of this Liquor and their plentiful use of it our Men call'd all these Islands the  Bashee  Islands  What Language these People do speak I know not for it had no affinity in sound to the  Chinese  which is spoke much through the Teeth nor yet to the  Malayan  Language They called the Metal that their Earrings were made of  Bullawan  which is the  Mindana  word for Gold therefore propably they may be related to the  Philippine Indians  for that is the general Name for Gold among all those  Indians  I could not learn from whence they have their Iron but it is most likely they go in their great Boats to the North end of  Luconia  and Trade with the  Indians  of that Island for it Neither did I see any thing beside Iron and pieces of Buffaloes Hides which I could judge that they bought of Strangers Their Cloaths were of their own Growth and Manufacture  These Men had Wooden Lances and a few Lances headed with Iron which are all the Wea¦pons that they have Their Armour is a piece o  Buffaloehide shaped like our Carters Frocks being without Sleeves and sowed both sides together with holes for the Head and the Arms to come forth This BuffCoat reaches down to their Knees It is close about their Shoulders but below it is Foot wide and as thick as a Board  I could never perceive them to Worship any thing neither had they any Idols neither did they seem to observe any one day more than other I could never perceive that one Man was of greater Power than another but they seemed to be all equal only every Man Ruling in his own House and the Children Respecting and Honouring their Parents  Yet 'tis probable that they have some Law or Custom by which they are govern'd for while we lay here we saw a young Man buried alive in the Earth and 'twas for Theft as far as we could understand from them There was a great deep hole dug and abundance of People came to the Place to take their last Farewell of him Among the rest there was one Woman who made great Lamentation and took off the condemn'd Person's Earrings We supposed her to be his Mother After he had taken his leave of her and some others he was put into the Pit and covered over with Earth He did not struggle but yielded very qui∣etly to his Punishment and they cramm'd the Earth close upon him and stifled him  They have but one Wife with whom they live and agree very well and their Children live very Obediently under them The Boys go out a Fish∣ing with their Fathers and the Girles live at home with their Mothers And when the Girles are grown pretty strong they send them to their Plantations  to dig Hames and Potatoes of which they bring home on their Heads every day enough to serve the whole Family for they have no Rice nor Maize  Their Plantations are in the Valleys at a good distance from their Houses where every Man has a certain spot of Land which is properly his own This he manageth himself for his own use and provides enough that he may not be beholding to his Neighbour  Notwithstanding the seeming nastiness of their Dish of Goats Maw they are in their Persons a very neat cleanly People both Men and Women And they are withal the quietest and civilest People that I did ever meet with I could never perceive them to be angry with one another I have admired to see or Boats aboard our Ship at a time and yet no difference among them but all civil and quiet endeavouring to help each other on occasi∣on No noise nor appearance of distaste and al∣though sometimes cross Accidents would happen which might have set other Men together by the Ears yet they were not moved by them Some∣times they will also drink freely and warm them∣selves with their Drink yet neither then could I ever perceive them out of Humour They are not only thus civil among themselves but very obliging and kind to Strangers nor were their Children rude to us as is usual Indeed the Women when we came to their Houses would modesty beg any Rags or small pieces of Cloth to swaddle their young ones in holding out their Children to us and begging is usual among all these wild Nations Yet neither did they beg so importunely as in other Places nor did the Men ever beg any thing at all Neither except once at the first time that we came to an Anchor as I shall relate did they steal any thing but dealt justly and with great sincerity with us and make us very welcome to  their Houses with  Bashee  drink If they had none of this Liquor themselves they would buy a Jar of Drink of their Neighbours and sit down with us for we could see them go and give a piece or two of their Gold for some Jars of  Bashee  And indeed among Wild  Indians  as these seem to be I wonder'd to see buying and selling which is not so usual nor to converse so freely as to go aboard Stranger's Ships with so little caution Yet their own small Trading may have brought them to this At these Entertainments they and their Family Wife and Children drank out of small Callabashes and when by themselves they drink about from one to another but when any of us came among them then they would always drink to one of us  They have no sort of Coin but they have small Crumbs of the Metal before described which they bind up very safe in Plantain Leaves or the like This Metal they exchange for what they want giving a small quantity of it about or Grains for a Jar of Drink that would hold or Gallons They have no Scales but give it by guess Thus much in general  To proceed therefore with our Affairs I have said before that we anchored here the th day of  August  While we were furling our Sails there came near Boats of the Natives aboard with or Men in each so that our Deck was full of Men We were at first afraid of them and there∣fore got up or small Arms on our Poop and kept or Men as Centinels with Guns in their Hands ready to fire on them if they had offered to molest us But they were pretty quiet only they pickt up such old Iron that they found on our Deck and they also took out our PumpBolts and LinchPins out of the Carriages of our Guns before we perceived them At last one of our Men per∣ceived  one of them very busie getting out one of our Linch Pins and took hold of the fellow who immediately bawl'd out and all the rest presently leaped overboard some into their Boats others into the Sea and they all made away for the Shore But when we perceived their Fright we made much of him that was in hold who stood Trembling all the while and at last we gave him a small piece of Iron with which he immediately leapt over∣board and swam to his Consorts who hovered a∣bout our Ship to see the Issue Then we beckned to them to come aboard again being very loth to lose a Commerce with them Some of the Boats came aboard again and they were always very Honest and Civil afterward  We presently after this sent a Canoa ashore to see their manner of living and what Provision they had The Canoa's Crew were made very welcome with Bashee drink and saw abundance of Hogs some of which they bought and returned aboard After this the Natives brought aboard both Hogs and Goats to us in their own Boats and every day we should have or Hogs and Goats in Boats aboard by our side These we bought for a small matter we could buy a good fat Goat for an old Iron Hoop and a Hog of or pound weight for or pound of Iron Their drink also they brought off in Jars which we bought for old Nails Spikes and Leaden Bullets Beside the forementioned Commodities they brought aboard' great quantities of Yams and Potatoes which we purchased for Nails Spikes or Bullets It was one Man's work to be all day cutting out Bars of Iron into small pieces with a cold Chisel And these were for the great Purchases of Hogs and Goats which they would not sell for Nails as their Drink and Roots Wo never let them know what Store we have that they may value it the more  Every morning assoon as it was light they would thus come aboard with their Commodities which we bought as we had occasion We did commonly furnish our selves with as many Goats and Roots as served us all the day and their Hogs we bought in large Quantities as we thought convenient for we salted them Their Hogs were very sweet but I never saw so many Meazled ones  We filled all our Water at a curious Brook close by us in  Grafton  's Isle where we first anchored We stayed there about three or four days before we went to other Islands We sailed to the South∣ward passing on the Eastside of  Grafton  Island and then passed thro' between that and  Monmouth  Island but we found no Anchoring till we came to the North end of  Monmouth  Island and there we stopt during one Tide The Tide runs very strong here and sometimes makes a short chop∣ping Sea Its course among these Islands is S by E and N by W The Flood sets to the North and Ebb to the South and it riseth and falleth Foot  When we went from hence we coasted about Leagues to the Southward on the West side of  Monmouth  Island and finding no Anchorground we stood over to the  Bashee  Island and came to an Anchor on the North East part of it against a small sandy Bay in fathom clean hard Sand and about a quarter of a Mile from the Shore Here is a pretty wide Channel between these two Islands and Anchoring all over it The Depth of Water is and Fathom  We presently built a Tent ashore to mend our Sails in and stay'd all the rest of our time here  viz  from the th day of  August  till the th day of  September  In which time we mended our Sails and scrubb'd our Ships bottom very well and eve∣ry day some of us went to their Towns and were  kindly entertained by them Their Boats also came aboard with their Merchandize to sell and lay aboard all Day and if we did not take it off their Hands one day they would bring the same again the next  We had yet the Winds at S W and S S W mostly fair Weather In  October  we did expect the Winds to shift to the N E and therefore we pro∣vided to sail assoon as the Eastern Monsoon was settled to cruize off of  Manila  Accordingly we provided a stock of Provision We salted or good fat Hogs and bought Yams and Potatoes good store to eat at Sea  About the th day of  September  the Winds shifted about to the East and from thence to the N E fine fair Weather The th it came at N and began to grow fresh and the Sky began to be clouded and the Wind freshned on us  At a clock at night it blew a very fierce Storm We were then riding with our best Bower a Head and though our Yards and Topmast were down yet we drove This obliged us to let go our SheetAnchor veering out a good scope of Cable which stopt us till or a clock the next day Then the Wind came on so fierce that she drove again with both Anchors ahead The Wind was now at N by W and we kept driving till or a clock in the afternoon and it was well for us that there were no Islands Rocks or Sands in our way for if there had we must have been driven upon them We used our utmost Endea∣vours to stop here being loath to go to Sea be∣cause we had six of our Men ashore who could not get off now At last we were driven out into deep Water and then it was in vain to wait any longer Therefore we hove in our Sheet Cable and got up our Sheet Anchor and cut away our best Bower for to have heav'd her up then would  have gone near to have foundred us and so put to Sea We had very violent Weather the night en∣suing with very hard Rain and we were forced to scud with our bare Poles till a Clock in the morning Then the Wind slacken'd and we brought our Ship to under a mizen and lay with our Head to the Westward The th day the Wind abated much but it rained very hard all day and the Night ensuing The th day the Wind came about to the N E and it cleared up and blew a hard Gale but it stood not there for it shifted about to the Eastward thence to the S E then to the South and at last settled at S W and then we had a moderate Gale and fair Wea∣ther  It was the th day when the Wind came to the S W Then we made all the Sail we could for the Island again The th day we had the Wind at West and saw the Islands but could not get in before night Therefore we stood off to the Southward till two a Clock in the morning then we tackt and stood in all the morning and about a clock the st day of  October  we an∣chored again at the place from whence we were driven  Then our six Men were brought aboard by the Natives to whom we gave whole Bars of Iron for their kindness and civility which was an ex∣traordinaay Present to them Mr  Robert Hall  was one of the Men that was left ashore I shall speak more of him hereafter He and the rest of them told me that after the Ship was out of sight the Natives began to be more kind to them than they had been before and persuaded them to cut their Hair short as theirs was offering to each of them if they would do it a young Woman to Wife and a small Hatchet and other Iron Utensils fit for a Planter in Dowry and withal shewed  them a piece of Land for them to manage They were courted thus by several of the Town where they then were but they took up their head quar∣ters at the House of him with whom they first went ashore When the Ship appeared in sight again then they importuned them for some Iron which is the chief thing that they covet even above their Earrings We might have bought all their Earrings or other Gold they had with our Ironbars had we been assur'd of its goodness and yet when it was touch'd and compar  d with other Gold we could not discern any difference tho' it look'd so pale in the lump but the seeing them polish it so often was a new discouragement  This last Storm put our Men quite out of heart for although it was not altogether so fierce as that which we were in on the Coast of  China  which was still fresh in Memory yet it wrought more powerfully and frighted them from their design of cruising before  Manila  fearing another Storm there Now every Man wisht himself at home as they had done an hundred times before But Captain  Read  and Captain  Teat  the Master persuaded them to go towards Cape  Comorin  and then they would tell them more of their Minds intending doubtless to cruize in the  Red Sea  and they easily prevailed with the Crew  The Eastern Monsoon was now at hand and the best way had been to go through the Streights of  Malacca  but Captain  Teat  said it was dangerous by reason of many Islands and Shoals there with which none of us were acquainted Therefore he thought it best to go round on the Eastside of all the  Philippine  Islands and so keeping South toward the  Spice Islands  to pass out into the  East Indian  Ocean about the Island  Timor  This seemed to be a very tedious way about and as dangerous altogether for Sholes but not for meeting with  English  or  Dutch  Ships which was their greatest Fear I was well enough satisfied know∣ing that the farther we went the more Knowledge and Experience I should get which was the main Thing that I regarded and should also have the more variety of Places to attempt an Escape from them being fully resolv'd to take the first oppor∣tunity of giving them the slip  CHAP XVI  They depart from the  Bashee  Islands

the Wind at West We first steer'd S S W and passed close by certain small Islands that lye just by the Northend of the Island  Luconia  We left them all on the West of us and past on the Eastside of it and the rest of the  Phi∣lippine  Islands coasting to the Southward  The N Eastend of the Island  Luconia  appears to be good Champion Land of an indifferent heighth plain and even for many Leagues only it has some pretty high Hills standing upright by themselves in these Plains but no ridges of Hills or chains of Mountains joyning one to another The Land on this side seems to be most Savannah or Pasture The S E part is more Mountainous and Woody  Leaving the Island  Luconia  and with it our Gol∣den Projects we sailed on to the Southward passing on the East side of the rest of the  Philippine  Islands These appear to be more Mountainous and less Woody till we came in sight of the Island St  John  the first of that name I mentioned the other I  spake of on the Coast of  China  This I have alrea∣dy described to be a very woody Island Here the Wind coming Southerly forced us to keep farther from the Islands  The day of  October  we came close by a small low woody Island that lieth East from the S E end of  Mindanao  distant from it about Leagues I do not find it set down in any SeaChart  The th day we had the Wind at N E and we steered West for the Island  Mindanao  and arri∣ved at the S E end again on the th day There we went in and anchored between two small Islands which lie in about d m North Lat I mentioned them when we first came on this Coast Here we found a fine small Cove on the N W end of the Eastermost Island fit to careen in or hale ashore so we went in there and pre∣sently unrigg'd our Ship and provided to hale our Ship ashore to clean her bottom These Islands are about or Leagues from the Island  Mindanao  they are about or Leagues in Circumference and of a pretty good heighth The Mold is black and deep and there are two small Brooks of fresh Water  They are both plentifully stored with great high Trees therefore our Carpenters were sent ashore to cut down some of them for our use for here they made a new Boltsprit which we did set here also our old one being very saulty They made a new Foreyard too and a Foretopmast And our Pumps being faulty and not serviceable they did cut a Tree to make a Pump They first squa∣red it then sawed it in the middle and then hol∣lowed each side exactly The two hollow sides were made big enough to contain a Pumpbox in the midst of them both when they were joined to∣gether and it required their utmost Skill to close them exactly to the making a tight Cylinder for the  Pumpbox being unaccustomed to such Work We learnt this way of Pumpmaking from the  Spa∣niards  who make their Pumps that they use in their Ships in the  SouthSeas  after this manner and I am confident that there are no better Handpumps in the World than they have  While we lay here the young Prince that I men∣tioned in the th Chapter came aboard He under∣standing that we were bound farther to the South∣ward desired us to transport him and his Men to his own Island He shewed it to us in our Draft and told us the Name of it which we put down in our Draft for it was not named there but I quite forgot to put it into my Journal  This Man told us that not above six days before this he saw Captain  Swan  and several of his Men that we left there and named the Names of some of them who he said were all well and that now they were at the City of  Mindanao  but that they had all of them been out with  Raja Laut  fighting under him in his Wars against his Enemies the  Al∣foores  and that most of them fought with un∣daunted Courage for which they were highly ho∣noured and esteemed as well by the Sultan as by the General  Raja Laut  that now Capt  Swan  intend∣ed to go with his Men to Fort  St George  and that in order thereto he had proffered forty Ounces of Gold for a Ship but the Owner and he were not yet agreed and that he feared that the Sultan would not let him go away till the Wars were ended  All this the Prince told us in the  Malayan  Tongue which many of us had learnt and when he went away he promised to return to us again in days time and so long Captain  Read  promised to stay for him for we had now almost finished our Busi∣ness and he seemed very glad of the opportunity of going with us  After this I endeavoured to perswade our Men to return with the Ship to the River of  Mindanao  and offer their Service again to Captain  Swan  I took an opportunity when they were filling of Water there being then half the Ships Company ashore and I found all these very willing to do it I desired them to say nothing till I had tried the Minds of the other half which I intended to do the next day it being their turn to fill Water then But one of these Men who seemed most forward to invite back Captain  Swan  told Captain  Read  and Captain  Teat  of the Project and they presently disswaded the Men from any such Designs Yet fearing the worst they made all possible haste to be gone  I have since been informed that Captain  Swan  and his Men stayed there a great while afterward and that many of the Men got passage from thence in  Dutch  Sloops to  Ternate  particularly Mr  Rofy  and Mr  Nelly  There they remained a great while and at last got to  Batavia  where the  Dutch  took their Journals from them and so to  Europe  and that some of Captain  Swan  's Men died at  Mindanao  of which number Mr  Harthrope  and Mr  Smith  Cap∣tain  Swan  's Merchants were two At last Captain  Swan  and his Surgeon going in a small Canoa a∣board of a  Dutch  Ship then in the Road in order to get passage to  Europe  were overset by the Na∣tives at the Mouth of the River who waited their coming purposely to do it but unsuspected by them where they both were kill'd in the Water This was done by the General's Order as some think to get his Gold which he did immediately seize on Others say it was because the General's House was burnt a little before and Captain  Swan  was suspected to be the Author of it and others say That it was Captain  Swan  's Threats occasioned his own Ruin for he would often say passionate∣ly  that he had been abused by the General and that he would have satisfaction for it saying also that now he was well acquainted with their Rivers and knew how to come in at any time that he also knew their manner of Fighting and the Weakness of their Country and therefore he would go a∣way and get a Band of Men to assist him and re∣turning thither again he would spoil and take all that they had and their Country too When the General had been informed of these Discourses he would say What is Captain  Swan  made of Iron and able to resist a whole Kingdom Or does he think that we are afraid of him that he speaks thus Yet did he never touch him till now the  Mindanayans  kill'd him It is very probable there might be somewhat of Truth in all this for the Captain was passionate and the General greedy of Gold But whatever was the occasion so he was killed as several have assured me and his Gold seized on and all his Things and his Journal also from  England  as far as Cape  Corrientes  on the Coast of  Mexico  This Journal was afterwards sent away from thence by Mr  Moody  who was there both a little before and a little after the Murder and he sent it to  England  by Mr  Goddard  Chief Mate of the  Defence  But to our purpose Seeing I could not persuade them to go to Captain  Swan  again I had a great desire to have had the Prince's Company But Captain  Read  was afraid to let his fickle Crew lie long That very day that the Prince had promised to return to us which was  November  we sailed hence directing our course SouthWest and having the Wind at N W  This Wind continued till we came in sight of the Island  Celebes  then it veered about to the W and to the Southward of the West We came up with the N E end of the Island  Celebes  the th  day and there we found the Current setting to the Westward so strongly that we could hardly get on the Eastside of that Island  The Island  Celebes  is a very large Island extend∣ed in length from North to South about de∣grees of Lat and in breadth it is about degrees It lies under the Equator the Northend being in Lat d m North and the Southend in Lat d m South and by common account the Northpoint in the Bulk of this Island lies nearest North and South but at the NorthEast end there runs out a long narrow Point stretching N E a∣bout Leagues and about Leagues to the East∣ward of this long Slipe is the Island  Gilolo  on the Westside of which are small Islands close by it which are very well stored with Cloves The two chiefest are  Ternate  and  Tidore  and as the Isle of  Ceylon  is reckoned the only place for Cinna∣mon and that of  Banda  for Nutmegs so these are thought by some to be the only CloveIslands in the World but this is a great Error as I have already shewn  At the Southend of the Island  C  lebes  there is a Sea or Gulph of about or Leagues wide and or long which runs up the Country al∣most directly to the North and this Gulph hath several small Islands along the middle of it On the Westside of the Island almost at the Southend of it the Town of  Macasser  is seated A Town of great Strength and Trade belonging to the  Dutch  There are great Inlets and Lakes on the Eastside of the Island as also abundance of small Islands and Sholes lying scattered about it We saw a high peeked Hill at the N end but the Land on the Eastside is low all along for we cruized al∣most the length of it The Mold on this side is black and deep and extraordinary fat and rich  and full of Trees And there are many Brooks of Water run out into the Sea Indeed all this Eastside of the Island seems to be but one large Grove of extraordinary great high Trees  Having with much ado got on this Eastside coast∣ing along to the Southward and yet having but lit∣tle Wind and even that little against us at S S W and sometimes Calm we were a long time going a∣bout the Island  The d day we were in Lat d m South and being about Leagues from the Island standing to the Southward with a very gentle LandWind about or a Clock in the Morning we heard a clashing in the Water like Boats rowing and fear∣ing some sudden Attack we got up all our Arms and stood ready to defend our selves As soon as it was day we saw a great Proe built like the  Minda∣nayan  Proes with about Men in her and smal∣ler Proes They lay still about a Mile to windward of us to view us and probably design'd to make a Prey of us when they first came out but they were now afraid to venture on us  At last we shewed them  Dutch  Colours thinking thereby to allure them to come to us for we could not go to them but they presently rowed in to∣ward the Island and went into a large Opening and we saw them no more nor did we ever see a∣ny other Boats or Men but only one fishing Canoa while we were about this Island neither did we see any House on all the Coast  About or Leagues to the South of this place there is a great Range of both large and small Islands and many Shoals also that are not laid down in our Drafts which made it extreamly troublesome for us to get through But we past between them all and the Island  Celebes  and anchored against a sandy Bay in Fathom sandy Ground about half a Mile from the main Island being then in Lat d m South  Here we stay'd several Days and sent out our Canoas a striking of Turtle every Day for here is great plenty of them but they were very shy as they were generally whereever we found them in the  EastIndia  Seas I know not the reason of it un∣less the Natives go very much a striking here for even in the  WestIndies  they are shy in places that are much disturbed And yet on  NewHolland  we found them shy as I shall relate tho' the Natives there do not molest them  On the Sholes without us we went and gathered Shellfish at low Water There were a monstrous sort of Cockles the Meat of one of them would suffice or Men It was very good wholsom Meat We did also beat about in the Woods on the Island but found no Game One of our Men who was always troubled with sore Legs found a certain Vine that supported it self by clinging about other Trees The Leaves reach or Foot high but the Strings or Branches or It had a very green Leaf pretty broad and roundish and of a thick Substance These Leaves pounded small and boiled with Hogs Lard make an excellent Salve Our Men knowing the Vertues of it stockt themselves here there was scarce a Man in the Ship but got a Pound or two of it especially such as were troubled with old Ulcers who found great benefit by it This Man that discovered these leaves here had his first knowledge of them in the Isthmus of  Darien  he having had his Receipt from one of the  Indians  there and he had been ashore in divers places since purposely to seek these Leaves but did never find any but here Among the many vast Trees hereabouts there was one exceeded all the rest This Captain  Read  caused to be cut down in order to make a Canoa having lost our Boats all but one small one in the late Storms so lusty Men who had been Logwoodcutters in  the Bays of  Campeachy  and  Honduras  as Captain  Read  himself and many more of us had and so were very expert at this work undertook to fell it  taking their turn always cutting together and they were one whole Day and half the next be∣fore they got it down This Tree though it grew in a Wood was yet Foot in circumference and Foot of clean Body without Knot or Branch and even there it had no more than one or two Branches and then ran clean again Foot higher there it spread it self into many great Limbs and Branches like an Oak very green and flourishing yet it was perisht at the Heart which marr'd it for the Service intended  So leaving it and having no more Business here we weighed and went from hence the next Day it being the th Day of  November  While we lay here we had some Tornadoes one or two every Day and pretty fresh Landwinds which were at West The Seabreezes were small and uncertain sometimes out of the N E and so veering about to the East and SouthEast We had the Wind at North East when we weighed and we steered off S S W In the Afternoon we saw a Shole ahead of us and altered our Course to the S S E In the Evening at a Clock we were close by another great Shole therefore we tackt and stood in for the Island  Celebes  again for fear of running on some of the Sholes in the Night By Day a Man might avoid them well enough for they had all Beacons on them like Huts built on tall Posts above Highwater Mark probably set up by the Natives of the Island  Celebes  or those of some other neighbouring Islands and I never saw any such elsewhere In the Night we had a violent Tornado out of the S W which lasted about an Hour  The th day we had a fresh Land Wind and steered away South passing between the Shoals which we saw the Day before These Shoals lye in Lat d South and about Leagues from the Island  Celebes  Being past them the Wind died away and we lay becalmed till the Afternoon Then we had a hard Tornado out of the South West and towards the Evening we saw two or three Spouts the first I had seen since I came into the  EastIndies  in the  WestIndies  I had often met with them A Spout is a small Ragged piece or part of a Cloud hanging down about a Yard seemingly from the blackest part thereof Com∣monly it hangs down sloping from thence or sometimes appearing with a small bending or elbow in the middle I never saw any hang per∣pendicularly down It is small at the lower end seeming no bigger than ones Arm but 'tis fuller towards the Cloud from whence it proceeds  When the surface of the Sea begins to work you shall see the Water for about paces in circumference foam and move gently round till the whirling motion increases and then it flies upward in a Pillar about Paces in compass at the bottom but lessening gradually upwards to the smallness of the Spout it self there where it reacheth the lower end of the Spout through which the rising Seawater seems to be conveyed into the Clouds This visibly appears by the Clouds increasing in bulk and blackness Then you shall presently see the Cloud drive along al∣though before it seemed to be without any mo∣tion the Spout also keeping the same course with the Cloud and still sucking up the Water as it goes along and they make a Wind as they go Thus it continues for the space of half an Hour more or less until the sucking is spent and then breaking off all the Water which was below  the Spout or pendulous piece of Cloud falls down again into the Sea making a great noise with its fall and clashing motion in the Sea  It is very dangerous for a Ship to be under a Spout when it breaks therefore we always en∣deavoured to shun it by keeping at a distance if possibly we can But for want of Wind to carry us away we are often in great fear and danger for it is usually calm when Spouts are at work except only just where they are Therefore Men at Sea when they see a Spout coming and know not how to avoid it do sometimes fire Shot out of their great Guns into it to give it air or vent that so it may break but I did never hear that it proved to be of any benefit  And now being on this Subject I think it not amiss to give you an account of an accident that happened to a Ship once on the Coast of  Guinea  some time in or about the Year One Cap∣tain  Records  of  London  bound for the Coast of  Guinea  in a Ship of Tuns and Guns called the  Blessing  when he came into the Lat or degrees North he saw several Spouts one of which came directly towards the Ship and he having no Wind to get out of the way of the Spout made ready to receive it by furling his Sails It came on very swift and broke a little before it reached the Ship making a great noise and raising the Sea round it as if a great House or some such thing had been cast into the Sea The fury of the Wind still lasted and took the Ship on the Starboard∣bow with such violence that it snapt off the Boltsprit and Foremast both at once and blew the Ship all along ready to overset it but the Ship did presently right again and the Wind whirling round took the Ship a second time with the like fury as before but on the contrary side and was again like to overset her the other way  The Mizenmast felt the fury of this second Blast and was snapt short off as the Foremast and Bolt∣sprit had been before The Mainmast and Main∣topmast received no damage for the fury of the Wind which was presently over did not reach them Three Men were in the Foretop when the Foremast broke and one on the Boltsprit and fell with them into the Sea but all of them were saved I had this Relation from Mr  John Canby  who was then Quartermaster and Steward of her one  Abraham Wise  was Chief Mate and  Leonard Jefferies  Second Mate  We are usually very much afraid of them Yet this was the only damage that ever I heard done by them They seem terrible enough the rather because they come upon you while you lie becalm'd like a Log in the Sea and cannot get out of their way But though I have seen and been beset by them often yet the Fright was always the greatest of the harm  December  the st we had a gentle Gale at E S E we steered South and at noon I was by Observa∣tion in Lat d m South Then we saw the Island  Bouton  bearing South West and about Leagues distant We had very uncertain and un∣constant Winds The Tornadoes came out of the S W which was against us and what other Winds we had were so faint that they did us little kindness but we took the advantage of the smallest Gale and got a little way every day The th day at noon I was by Observation in Lat d m South  The th day we got close by the N W end of the Island  Bouton  and in the Evening it being fair Weather we hoised out our Canoa and sent the Moskito Men of whom we had or to strike Turtle for here are plenty of them but they being shy we chose to strike them in the night which  is customary in the  WestIndies  also for every time they come up to breathe which is once in or minutes they blow so hard that one may hear them at or yards distance by which means the Striker knows where they are and may more easily approach them than in the day for the Tur∣tle sees better than he hears but on the contrary the Manatee's hearing is quickest  In the morning they returned with a very large Turtle which they took near the Shore and withal an  Indian  of the Island cameaboard with them He spake the  Malayan  Language by which we did understand him He told us that Leagues far∣ther to the Southward of us there was a good Harbour in which we might Anchor So having a fair Wind we got thither by noon  This Harbour is in Lat d m South lying on the Eastside of the Island  Bouton  Which Island lies near the S E end of the Island  Celebcs  distant from it about or leagues It is of a long form stretching S W and N E about Leagues long and broad It is pretty high Land and appears pretty even and flat and very woody  There is a large Town within a League of the anchoring place called  Callasusung  being the chief if there were more which we knew not It is about a Mile from the Sea on the top of a small Hill in a very fair Plain incompassed with Coco∣nut Trees Without the Trees there is a strong Stone Wall clear round the Town The Houses are built like the Houses at  Mindanao  but more neat And the whole Town was very clean and delightsome  The Inhabitants are small and well shaped They are much like the  Mindanaians  in shape co∣lour and habit but more neat and tight They speak the  Malayan  Language and are all  Mahome∣tans  They are very obedient to the Sultan who  is a little Man about or years old and hath a great many Wives and Children  About an hour after we came to an Anchor the Sultan sent a Messenger aboard to know what we were and what our Business We gave him an ac∣count and he returned ashore and in a short time after he came aboard again and told us That the Sultan was very well pleased when he heard that we were  English  and said That we should have any thing that the Island afforded and that he himself would come aboard in the morning Therefore the Ship was made clean and every thing put in the best order to receive him  The th day in the morning betimes a great many Boats and Canoas came aboard with Fowls Eggs Plantains Potatoes  c  but they would dispose of none till they had order for it from the Sultan at his coming About a clock the Sul∣tan came aboard in a very neat Proe built after the  Mindanao  Fashion There was a large white Silk Flag at the head of the Mast edged round with a deep red for about or Inches broad and in the middle there was neatly drawn a Green Griffon trampling on a winged Serpent that seemed to struggle to get up and threatned his Adversary with open Mouth and with a long Sting that was ready to be darted into his Legs Other  EastIndian  Princes have their Devices also  The Sultan with or of his Nobles and of his Sons sate in the House of the Proe His Guards were Musqueteers standing on one side of the Proe and on the other side and be∣fore the door of the Proehouse stood one with a great broad Sword and a Target and more such at the after part of the House and in the Head and Stern of the Proe stood Musqueteers more at each end  The Sultan had a Silk Turbat laced with nar∣row Gold Lace by the sides and broad Lace at the end which hung down on one side the Head after the  Mindanayan  Fashion He had a Sky coloured Silk pair of Breeches and a piece of red Silk thrown cross his Shouldiers and hanging loofe about him the greatest part of his Back and Waist appearing naked He had neither Stocking nor Shoe One of his Sons was about or year old the other two were young things and they were always in the arms of one or other of his Attendants  Captain  Read  met him at the side and led him into his small Cabin and fired five Guns for his welcome Assoon as he came aboard he gave leave to his Subjects to traffick with us and then our People bought what they had a mind to The Sultan seemed very well pleas'd to be visited by the  English  and said he had coveted to have a sight of  Englishmen  having heard extraordinary Characters of their just and honourable Dealing But he ex∣claimed against the  Dutch  as all the  Mindanayans  and all the  Indians  we met with do and wish'd them at a greater distance  For  Macasser  is not very far from henee one of the chiefest Towns that the  Dutch  have in those parts From thence the  Dutch  comes sometimes hi∣ther to purchase Slaves The Slaves that these Peo∣ple get here and sell to the  Dutch  are some of the idolatrous Natives of the Island who not being under the Sultan and having no Head live strag∣gling in the Country flying from one place to another to preserve themselves from the Prince and his Subjects who hunt after them to make them Slaves For the Civilized  Indians  of the Maritime Places who Trade with Foreigners if they can∣not reduce the inland People to the Obedience of their Prince they catch all they can of them and sell them for Slaves accounting them to be but  as Savages just as the  Spaniards  do the poor  Ame∣ricans  After two or three Hours discourse the Sultan went ashore again and Guns were fired at his departure also The next day he sent for Captain  Read  to come ashore and he with or Men went to wait on the Sultan I could not slip an opportunity of seeing the Place and so accom∣panied them We were met at the landing place by two of the chief Men and guided to a pretty neat House where the Sultan waited our coming The House stood at the farther end of all the Town beforementioned which we past through and abundance of People were gazing on us as we past by When we came near the House there were poor naked Soldiers with Musquets made a Lane for us to pass through This House was not built on Posts as the rest were after the  Mindanayan  way but the Room in which we were enter∣tained was on the Ground covered with Mats to sit on Our Entertainment was Tobacco and Betel∣nut and young Coconuts and the House was beset with Men and Women and Children who thronged to get near the Windows to look on us  We did not tarry above an hour before we took our leaves and departed This Town stands in a sandy Soil but what the rest of the Island is I know not for none of us were ashore but at this Place  The next day the Sultan came aboard again and presented Capt  Read  with a little Boy but he was too small to be serviceable on board and so Captain  Read  returned Thanks and told him he was to little for him Then the Sultan sent for a bigger Boy which the Captain accepted This Boy was a very pretty tractable Boy but what was wonderful in him he had two Rows of Teeth  one within another on each Jaw None of the other People were so nor did I ever see the like The Captain was presented also with Hegoats and was promised some Buffaloe but I do believe that they have but few of either on the Island We did not see any Buffaloe nor many Goats neither have they much Rice but their chiefest Food is Roots We bought here about a thousand pound Weight of Potatoes Here our Men bought also abundance of Crockadores and fine large Parakites curiously coloured and some of them the finest I ever saw  The Crockadore is as big as a Parrrot and shaped much like it with such a Bill but it is as white as Milk and hath a bunch of Feathers on his head like a Crown At this place we bought a Proe also of the  Minda∣naian  make for our own use which our Carpenters afterwards altered and made a delicate Boat fit for any Service She was sharp at both ends but we saw'd off one and made that end flat fast ening a Rudder to it and she rowed and sailed incomparably  We stay'd here but till the th day because it was a bad Harbour and foul Ground and a bad time of the year too for the Tornadoes began to come in thick and strong When we went to weigh our Anchor it was hooked in a Rock and we broke our Cable and could not get our Anchor though we strove hard for it so we went away and left it there We had the Wind at N N E and we steered towards the S E and fell in with or small Islands that lie in d m South Lat and about or Leagues from  Callasusung  Harbour These Islands appeared very green with Coconut Trees and we saw two or three Towns on them and heard a Drum all night for we were got in among Shoals end could no get out again till the next day We knew not whether the Drum were for for fear of us  or that they were making merry as 'tis usual in these parts to do all the Night singing and dancing till Morning  We found a pretty strong Tide here the Flood setting to the Southward and the Ebb to the North∣ward These Sholes and many other that are not laid down in our Drafts lie on the South West side of the Islands where we heard the Drum about a League from them At last we past between the Islands and tried for a Passage on the East side We met with divers Sholes on this side also but found Channels to pass through so we steer'd away for the Island  Timor  intending to pass out by it We had the Winds commonly at W S W and S W hard Gales and rainy Weather  The th day we got clear of the Shoals and steered S by E with the Wind at W S W but veering every half hour sometimes at S W and then again at W and sometimes at N N W bring∣ing much Rain with Thunder and Lightning  The th day we passed by the Island  Omba  which is a pretty high Island lying in Lat d m and not above or Leagues from the N E part of the Island  Timor  It is about or Leagues long and or Leagues wide  About or Leagues to the West of  Omba  is a∣nother pretty large Island but it had no Name in our Plats yet by the Situation it should be that which in some Maps is called  Pentare  We saw on it abun∣dance of Smoaks by day and Fires by night and a large Town on the Northside of it not far from the Sea but it was such bad Weather that we did not go ashore Between  Omba  and  Pentare  and in the mid Channel there is a small low sandy Island with great Sholes on either side but there is a very good Channel close by  Pentare  between that and the Sholes about the small Isle We were three Days beating off and on not  having a Wind for it was at South South West  The d day in the Evening having a small Gale at North we got through keeping close by  Pen∣tare  The Tide of Ebb here set out to the South∣ward by which we were helped through for we had but little Wind But this Tide which did us a kindness in setting us through had like to have ruined us afterwards for there are two small Islands lying at the Southend of the Channel we came through and towards these Islands the Tide hurried us so swiftly that we very narrowly esca∣ped being driven ashore for the little Wind we had before at North dying away we had not one breath of Wind when we came there neither was there any AnchorGround But we got out our Oars and rowed yet all in vain for the Tide set wholly on one of the small Islands that we were forced with might and main Strength to bear off the Ship by thrusting with our Oars against the Shore which was a steep Bank and by this means we presently drove away clear of Danger and having a little Wind in the Night at North we steered a∣way S S W In the Morning again we had the Wind at W S W and steered S and the Wind com∣ing to the W N W we steered S W to get clear of the S W end of the Island  Timor  The th day we saw the N W point of  Timor  S E by E distant about Leagues  Timor  is a long high mountainous Island stretch∣ing N E and S W It is about Leagues long and or wide the middle of the Island is in Lat about d South I have been informed that the  Portuguese  do trade to this Island but I know no∣thing of its produce besides Coire for making Cables of which there is mention Chap X  The th day we saw two small Islands which lie near the S W end of  Timor  They bear from us S E We had very hard Gales of Wind and  still with a great deal of Rain the Wind at W and W S W  Being now clear of all the Islands we stood off South intending to touch at  New Holland  a part of  Terra Australis Incognita  to see what that Country would afford us Indeed as the Winds were we could not now keep our intended Course which was first westerly and then northerly without go∣ing to  New Holland  unless we had gone back again among the Islands But this was not a good time of the Year to be among any Islands to the South of the Equator unless in a good Harbour  The st day we were in Lat d m still standing to the Southward the Wind bearing com∣monly very hard at W we keeping upon it under two Courses and our Mizen and sometimes a Main∣topsail Rift About a Clock at Night we tackt and stood to the Northward for fear of running on a Shoal which is laid down in our Drafts in Lat d m or thereabouts It bearing S by W from the Eastend of  Timor  and so the Island bore from us by our Judgments and Reckoning At a Clock we tackt again and stood S by W and S S W  In the Morning assoon as it was day we saw the Shoal right ahead It lies in d m by all our Reckonings It is a small Spit of Sand just ap∣pearing above the Waters edge with several Rocks about it or foot high above water It lies in a triangular Form each side being about a League and half We stemm'd right with the middle of it and stood within half a Mile of the Rocks and sounded but found no Ground Then we went about and stood to the North two Hours and then tackt and stood to the Southward again thinking to weather it but could not So we bore away on the Northside till we came to the Eastpoint giving the Rocks a small birth Then we trimm'd  sharp and stood to the Southward passing close by it and sounded again but found no Ground  This Shole is laid down in our Drafts not above or Leagues from  New Holland  but we did run afterwards Leagues due South before we fell in with it and I am very confident that no part of  New Holland  hereabouts lies so far Northerly by Leagues as it is laid down in our Drafts For if  New Holland  were laid down true we must of ne∣cessity have been driven near Leagues to the Westward of our Course but this is very improba∣ble that the Current should set so strong to the Westward seeing we had such a constant Westerly Wind I grant that when the Monsoon shifts first the Current does not presently shift but runs after∣wards near a Month but the Monsoon had been shifted at least two Months now But or the Mon∣soons and other Winds and of the Currents else∣where in their proper place As to these here I do rather believe that the Land is not laid down true than that the Current deceived us for it was more probable we should have been deceived before we met with the Shole than afterwards for on the Coast of  New Holland  we found the Tides keeping their constant Course the Flood running N by E and the Ebb S by E  The th day of  January  we fell in with the Land of  New Holland  in the Lat of d m having as I said before made our Course due South from the Shole that we past by the st day of  December  We ran in close by it and finding no convenient anchoring because it lies open to the N W we ran along shore to the Eastward steering N E by E for so the Land lies We steered thus about Leagues and then came to a Point of Land from whence the Land trends East and Southerly for or Leagues but how afterwards I know not About Leagues to the Eastward of this Point  there is a pretty deep Bay with abundance of I∣slands in it and a very good place to anchor in or to hale ashore About a League to the Eastward of that Point we anchored  January  the th Mile from the Shore in Fathom good hard Sand and clean Groud  New Holland  is a very large Tract of Land It is not yet determined whether it is an Island or a main Continent but I am certain that it joyns neither to  Asia Africa  nor  America  This part of it that we saw is all low even Land with sandy Banks against the Sea only the Points are rocky and so are some of the Islands in this Bay  The Land is of a dry sandy Soil destitute of Water except you make Wells yet producing di∣vers sorts of Trees but the Woods are not thick nor the Trees very big Most of the Trees that we saw are Dragontrees as we supposed and these too are the largest Trees of any there They are about the bigness of our large Appletrees and about the same heighth and the Rind is blackish and some∣what rough The Leaves are of a dark colour the Gum distils out of the Knots or Cracks that are in the Bodies of the Trees We compared it with some Gum Dragon or Dragon's Blood that was aboard and it was of the some colour and taste The other sorts of Trees were not known by any of us There was pretty long Grass growing under the Trees but it was very thin We saw no Trees that bore Fruit or Berries  We saw no sort of Animal nor any Track of Beast but once and that seemed to be the Tread of a Beast as big as a great MastiffDog Here are a few small Landbirds but none bigger than a Blackbird and but few Seafowls Neither is the Sea very plentifully stored with Fish unless you reckon the Manatee and Turtle as such Of these Creatures there is plenty but they are extraordinary  shy tho' the Inhabitants cannot trouble them much having neither Boats nor Iron  The Inhabitants of this Country are the misera∣blest People in the world The  Hodmadods  of  Mo∣nomatapa  though a nasty People yet for Wealth are Gentlemen to these who have no Houses and skin Garments Sheep Poultry and Fruits of the Earth Ostrich Eggs  c  as the  Hodmadods  have And setting aside their Humane Shape they differ but little from Brutes They are tall strait bo∣died and thin with small long Limbs They have great Heads round Foreheads and great Brows Their Eyelids are always half closed to keep the Flies out of their Eyes they being so troublesome here that no fanning will keep them from coming to ones Face and without the assistance of both Hands to keep them off they will creep into ones Nostrils and Mouth too if the Lips are not shut very close So that from their Infancy being thus annoyed with these Insects they do never open their Eyes as other People And therefore they cannot see far unless they hold up their Heads as if they were looking at somewhat over them  They have great Bottle Noses pretty full Lips and wide Mouths The two Foreteeth of their Up∣perjaw are wanting in all of them Men and Wo∣men Old and Young whether they draw them out I know not Neither have they any Beards They are long visaged and of a very unpleasing Aspect having no one graceful Feature in their Faces Their Hair is black short and curl'd like that of the Negroes and not long and lank like the common  Indians  The colour of their Skins both of their Faces and the rest of their Body is coal black like that of the Negroes of  Guinea  They have no sort of Cloaths but a piece of the Rind of a Tree ty'd like a Girdle about their Waists and a handful of long Grass or or small green  Boughs full of Leaves thrust under their Girdle cover their Nakedness  They have no Houses but lie in the open Air without any covering the Earth being their Bed and the Heaven their Canopy Whether they co∣habit one Man to one Woman or promiscuously I know not but they do live in Companies or Men Women and Children together Their only Food is a small sort of Fish which they get by making Wares of Stone across little Coves or Branches of the Sea every Tide bringing in the small Fish and there leaving them for a Prey to these People who constantly attend there to search for them at Lowwater This small Fry I take to be the top of their Fishery They have no Instru∣ments to catch great Fish should they come and such seldom stay to be left behind at Lowwater Nor could we catch any Fish with our Hooks and Lines all the while we lay there In other places at Lowwater they seek for Cockles Muscles and Periwincles Of these Shellfish there are fewer still so that their chiefest dependance is upon what the Sea leaves in their Wares which be it much or little they gather up and march to the places of their abode There the old People that are not able to stir abroad by reason of their Age and the tender Infants wait their return and what Providence has bestowed on them they presently broil on the Coals and eat it in common Some∣times they get as many Fish as makes them a plen∣tiful Banquet and at other times they scarce get every one a taste But be it little or much that they get every one has his part as well the young and tender the old and feeble who are not able to go abroad as the strong and lusty When they have eaten they lie down till the next Lowwater and then all that are able march out be it Night or Day rain or shine 'tis all one they must attend the  Wares or else they must fast For the Earth affords them no Food at all There is neither Herb Root Pulse nor any sor of Grain fort them to eat that we saw nor any sort of Bird or Beast that they can catch having no Instruments wherewithal to do so  I did not perceive that they did worship any thing These poor Creatures have a sort of Wea∣pon to defend their Ware or fight with their Ene∣mies if they have any that will interfere with their poor Fishery They did at first endeavour with their Weapons to frighten us who lying ashore de∣terr'd them from one of their Fishingplaces Some of them had wooden Swords others had a sort of Lances The Sword is a piece of Wood shaped somewhat like a Cutlass The Lance is a long strait Pole sharp at one end and hardened after∣wards by heat I saw no Iron nor any other sort of Metal therfore it is probable they use StoneHatchets as some  Indians  in  America  do described in Chap IV  How they get their Fire I know not but pro∣bably as  Indians  do out of Wood I have seen the  Indians  of  BonAiry  do it and have my self tryed the Experiment They take a flat piece of Wood that is pretty soft and make a small dent in one side of it then they take another hard round Stick about the bigness of ones little Finger and sharpen∣ing it at one end like a Pencil they put that sharp end in the hole or dent of the flat soft piece and then rubbbing or twirling the hard piece between the Palms of their Hands they drill the soft piece till it smoaks and at last takes fire  These People speak somewhat thro' the Throat but we could not understand one word that they said We anchored as I said before  January  the th and seeing Men walking on the Shore we presently sent a Canoa to get some Acquaintance  with them for we were in hopes to get some Provision among them But the Inhabitants see∣ing our Boat coming run away and hid themselves We searched afterwards Days in hopes to find their Houses but found none yet we saw many places where they had made Fires At last being out of hopes to find their Habitations we searched no farther but left a great many Toys ashore in such places where we thought that they would come In all our search we found no Water but old Wells on the sandy Bays  At last we went over to the Islands and there we found a great many of the Natives I do be∣lieve there were on one Island Men Women and Children The Men at our first coming a∣shore threatned us with their Lances and Swords but they were frightned by firing one Gun which we fired purposely to scare them The Island was so small that they could not hide themselves but they were much disordered at our Landing espe∣cially the Women and Children for we went di∣rectly to their Camp The lustiest of the Women snatching up their Infants ran away howling and the little Children run after squeaking and bawl∣ing but the Men stood still Some of the Wo∣men and such People as could not go from us lay still by a Fire making a doleful noise as if we had been coming to devour them but when they saw we did not intend to harm them they were pretty quiet and the rest that fled from us at our first coming returned again This their place of Dwelling was only a Fire with a few Boughs before it set up on that side the Winds was of  After we had been here a little while the Men began to be familiar and we cloathed some of them designing to have had some service of them for it for we found some Wells of Water here and intended to carry or Barrels of it aboard  But it being somewhat troublesome to carry to the Canoas we thought to have made these men to have carry'd it for us and therefore we gave them some Cloaths to one an old pair of Breeches to another a ragged Shirt to the third a Jacket that was scarce worth owning which yet would have been very acceptable at some places where we had been and so we thought they might have been with these People We put them on them think∣ing that this finery would have brought them to work heartily for us and our Water being filled in small long Barrels about Gallons in each which were made purposely to carry Water in we brought these our new Servants to the Wells and put a Barrel on each of their Shoulders for them to carry to the Canoa But all the signs we could make were to no purpose for they stood like Statues without motion but grinn'd like so many Monkies staring one upon another For these poor Creatures seem not accustomed to carry Bur∣thens and I believe that one of our Shipboys of years old would carry as much as one of them So we were forced to carry our Water our selves and they very fairly put the Cloaths off a∣gain and laid them down as if Cloaths were on∣ly to work in I did not perceive that they had any great liking to them at first neither did they seem to admire any thing that we had  At another time our Canoa being among these Islands seeking for game espy'd a drove of these Men swimming from one Island to another for they have no Boats Canoas or Barklogs They took up Four of them and brought them aboard two of them were middle aged the other two were young Men about or Years old To these we gave boiled Rice and with it Turtle and Manatee boiled They did greedily devour what we gave them but took no notice of the Ship or  any thing in it and when they were set on Land again they ran away as fast as they could At our first coming before we were acquainted with them or they with us a Company of them who liv'd on the Main came just against our Ship and standing on a pretty high Bank threatned us with their Swords and Lances by shaking them at us at last the Captain ordered the Drum to be beaten which was done of a sudden with much vigour purposely to scare the poor Creatures They hearing the noise ran away as fast as they could drive and when they ran away in haste they would cry  Gurry Gurry  speaking deep in the Throat Those Inhabitants also that live on the Main would always run away from us yet we took several of them For as I have already ob∣served they had such bad Eyes that they could not see us till we came close to them We did always give them Victuals and let them go again but the Islanders after our first time of being a∣mong them did not stir for us  When we had been here about a week we hal'd our Ship into a small sandy Cove at a Spring∣tide as far as she would float and at low Water she was left dry and the Sand dry without us near half a mile for the Sea riseth and falleth here about fathom The Flood runs North by East and the Ebb South by West All the Neeptides we lay wholly aground for the Sea did not come near us by about a hundred yards We had there∣fore time enough to clean our Ships bottom which we did very well Most of our Men lay ashore in a Tent where our sails were mending and our Strikers brought home Turtle and Manatee every day which was our constant Food  While we lay here I did endeavour to persuade our Men to go to some  English  Factory but was threatned to be turned ashore and left here for  it This made me desist and patiently wait for some more convenient place and opportunity to leave them than here Which I did hope I should accomplish in a short time because they did in∣tend when they went from hence to bear down towards Cape  Comorin  In their way thither they design'd also to visit the Island  Cocos  which lieth in Lat d m North by our Drafts hoping there to find of that Fruit the Island having its Name from thence  CHAP XVII  Leaving  NewHolland  they pass by the Island  Cocos  and touch at another woody Island near it A Land Animal like large Craw∣fish CocoNuts floating in the Sea The Island  Triste  bearing Coco's yet overflown every Springtide They Anchor at a small Island near that of  Nassaw Hog  Island and others A Proe taken belonging to  Achin Nicobar  Island and the rest called by that Name Ambergrease good and bad The Manners of the Inhabitants of these Islands They Anchor at  Nicobar  Isle Its Situation Soil and pleasant mixture of its Bays Trees  c  The  Melory  Tree and Fruit used for Bread The Natives of  Nicobar  Island their Form Habit Language Habitations no form of Religion or Government Their Food and Canoas They clean the Ship The Au∣thor projects and gets leave to stay ashore here and with him two Englishmen more the  Por∣tuguese  and Malayans of  Achin  Their first Rencounters with the Natives Of the common Traditions concerning  Cannibals  or ManEaters Their Entertainment ashore They buy a Canoa to transport them over to  Achin  but overset her at first going out Having recruited and improved her they set out again for the East side of the Island They  have a War with the Islanders but Peace being reestablished they lay in Stores and make Preparations for their Voyage  MArch  the th we sailed from  NewHolland  with the Wind at N N W and fair weather We directed our Course to the North∣ward intending as I said to touch at the Island  Cocos  But we met with the Winds at N W W N W and N N W for several days which obliged us to keep a more easterly course than was convenient to find that Island We had soon after our setting out very bad weather with much Thunder and Lightning Rain and high blustring Winds  It was the th day of  March  before we were in the Lat of the Island  Cocos  which is in d m and then by Judgment we were or Leagues to the East of it and the Wind was now at S W Therefore we did rather chuse to bear away to∣wards some Islands on the West side of  Sumatra  than to beat against the Wind for the Island  Cocos  I was very glad of this being in hopes to make my escape from them to  Sumatra  or some other Place  We met nothing of remark in this Voyage beside the catching great Sharks till the th day Then we fell in with a small woody Island in Lat d m Its Longitude from  NewHolland  from whence we came was by my account d m West It was deep Water about the Island and therefore no Anchoring but we sent two Canoas ashore one of them with the Carpenters to cut a Tree to make another Pump the other Canoa went to search for fresh Water and found a fine small Brook near the S W point of the Island but there the Sea fell in on the Shore so high that  they could not get it off At noon both our Ca∣noas returned aboard and the Carpenters brought aboard a good Tree which they afterwards made a Pump with such a one as they made at  Mindanao  The other Canoa brought aboard as many Boobies and Men of War Birds as sufficed all the Ships Company when they were boiled They got also a sort of LandAnimal somewhat resembling a large Crawfish without its great Claws These Crea∣tures lived in holes in the dry sandy Ground like Rabbits Sir  Francis Drake  in his Voyage round the World makes mention of such that he found at  Ternate  or some other of the Spice Islands or near them They were very good sweet Meat and so large that two of them were more than a Man could eat being almost as thick as ones Leg Their Shells were of a dark brown but red when boiled  This Island is of a good heighth with steep Cliffs against the S and S W and a sandy Bay on the Northside but very deep water steep to the shore The Mold is blackish the Soil fat producing large Trees of divers sorts  About one a clock in the Afternoon we made sail from this Island with the Wind at S W and we steered N W Afterwards the Winds came a∣bout at N W and continued between the W N W and the N N W several days I observed that the Winds blew for the most part out of the West or N W and then we had always rainy Weather with Tornadoes and much Thunder and Light∣ning but when the Wind came any way to the Southward it blew but faint and brought fair weather  We met nothing of remark till the th day of  A∣pril  and then being in Lat d S we saw the Land of  Sumatra  at a great distance bearing North The th day we saw the Eastend of the Island  Su∣matra  very plain we being then in Lat d The th day being in Lat d m and about or Leagues from the Island  Sumatra  on the West side of it we saw abundance of Coconuts swim∣ming in the Sea and we hoysed out our Boat and took up some of them as also a small Hatch or Scuttle rather belonging to some Bark The Nuts were very sound and the Kernel sweet and in some the Milk or Water in them was yet sweet and good  The th day we came to a small Island called  Triste  in Lat by Observation d South it is a∣bout or Leagues to the West of the Island  Su∣matra  From hence to the Northward there are a great many small uninhabited Islands lying much at the same distance from  Sumatra  This Island  Triste  is not a mile round and so low that the Tide flows clear over it It is of a sandy Soil and full of Coconut Trees The Nuts are but small yet sweet enough full and more ponderous than I ever felt any of that bigness notwithstanding that every Springtide the Saltwater goes clear over the Island  We sent ashore our Canoas for Coconuts and they returned aboard laden with them three times Our Strikers also went out and struck some Fish which was boiled for Supper They also kill'd young Aligators which was salted for the next day  I had no Opportunity at this place to make my Escape as I would have done and gone over hence to  Sumatra  could I have kept a Boat to me But there was no compassing this and so the th day we went from hence steering to the Northward on the West side of  Sumatra  Our Food now was Rice and the Meat of the Coconuts rasped and steep'd in Water which made a sort of Milk into which we did put our Rice making a pleasant  Mess enough After we parted from  Triste  we saw other small Islands that were also full of Coconut Trees  The th day being in Lat d m S the S W point of the Island  Nassaw  bore N about mile dist This is a pretty large uninhabited Island in Lat d m S and is full of high Trees A∣bout a mile from the Island  Nassaw  there is a small Island full of Coconut Trees There we anchored the th day to replenish our stock of CocoNuts A Riff of Rocks lies almost round this Island so that our Boats could not go ashore nor come a∣board at low Water yet we got aboard four Boatload of Nuts This Island is low like  Triste  and the anchoring is on the Northside where you have fourteen Fathom a Mile from Shore clean Sand  The st day we went from hence and kept to the Northward coasting still on the Westside of the Island  Sumatra  and having the Winds between the W and S S W with unsetled Weather some∣times Rains and Tornadoes and sometimes fair Weather  The th day we crost the Equator still coast∣ing to the Northward between the Island  Suma∣tra  and a Range of small Islands lying or Leagues off it Amongst all these Islands HogIsland is the most considerable It lies in Lat d m North It is pretty high even Land cloathed with tall flourishing Trees we past it by the th day  The th we saw a Sail to the North of us which we chased but it being little Wind we did not come up with her till the th day Then being within a League of her Captain  Read  went into a Canoa and took her and brought her aboard She was a Proe with four Men in her be∣longing to  Achin  whether she was bound She  came from one of these Coconut Islands that we past by and was laden with Coconuts and Co∣conut Oil Captain  Read  ordered his Men to take aboard all the Nuts and as much of the Oil as he thought convenient and then cut a hole in the bot∣tom of the Proe and turned her loose keeping the Men Prisoners  It was not for the lucre of the Cargo that Cap∣tain  Read  took this Boat but to hinder me and some others from going ashore for he knew that we were ready to make our escapes if an oppor∣tunity presented it self and he thought that by his abusing and robbing the Natives we should be afraid to trust our selves among them But yet this proceeding of his turned to our great advantage as shall be declared hereafter  May  the st we ran down by the North West end of the Island  Sumatra  within or Leagues of the Shore All this Westside of  Sumatra  which we thus coasted along our  Englishmen  at  Fort St George  call the  WestCoast  simply without adding the name of  Sumatra  The Prisoners who were taken the day before shewed us the Islands that lie off  Achin  Harbour and the Channels through which Ships go in and told us also that there was an  English  Factory at  Achin  I wish'd my self there but was forced to wait with patience till my time was come  We were now directing our Course towards the  Nicobar  Islands intending there to clean the Ship's bottom in order to make her sail well  The th day in the evening we had sight of one of the  Nicobar  Islands The Southermost of them lies about Leagues N N W from the N W end of the Island  Sumatra  This most Southerly of them is  Nicobar  it self but all the cluster of Islands lying South of the  Audeman  Islands are called by our Seamen the  Nicobar  Islands  The Inhabitants of these Islands have no certain Converse with any Nation but as Ships pass by them they will come aboard in their Proes and offer their Commodities to sail never enquiring of what Nation they are for all white People are a∣like to them Their chiefest Commodities are Am∣bergrease and Fruits  Ambergrease is often found by the Native  In∣dians  of these Islands who know it very well as also know how to cheat ignorant Strangers with a certain mixture like it Several of our Men bought such of them for a small Purchase Capt  Weldon  also about this time touched at some of these Islands to the North of the Island where we lay and I saw a great deal of such Ambergrease that one of his Men bought there but it was not good having no smell at all Yet I saw some there very good and fragrant  At that Island where Captain  Weldon  was there were two Fryers sent thither to convert the  Indians  One of them came away with Captain  Weldon  the other remained there still He that came away with Captain  Weldon  gave a very good Character of the Inhabitants of that Island  viz  that they were very honest civil harmless People That they were not addicted to Quarrelling Theft or Mur∣der That they did marry or at least live as Man and Wife one Man with one Woman never chang∣ing till Death made the Separation That they were punctual and honest in performing their Bargains And that they were inclined to receive the Christi∣an Religion This Relation I had afterwards from the Mouth of a Priest at  Tonqueen  who told me that he received this Information by a Letter from the Fryer that Captain  Weldon  brought away from thence But to proceed  The th day of  May  we ran down on the West∣side of the Island  Nicobar  properly so called and  anchored at the N W end of it in a small Bay in Fathom Water not half a Mile from the Shore The body of this Island is in d m North Lat it is about Leagues long and or broad The Southend of it is pretty high with steep Cliffs against the Sea the rest of the Island is low flat and even The Mold of it is black and deep and it is very well watered with small running Streams It produceth abundance of tall Trees fit for any uses for the whole Bulk of it seems to be but one entire Grove But that which adds most to its Beauty off at Sea are the many spots of Coconut Trees which grow round it in every small Bay The Bays are half a Mile or a Mile long more or less and these Bays are intercepted or divided from each other with as many little rocky Points  Woodland  As the Coconut Trees do thus grow in Groves fronting to the Sea in the Bays so there is another sort of FruitTree in the Bays bordering on the backside of the CocoTrees farther from the Sea It is called by the Natives a MeloryTree This Tree is as big as our large AppleTrees and as high It hath a blackish Rind and a pretty broad Leaf The Fruit is as big as the Breadfruit at  Guam  de∣scribed in Chapter X or a large Penny Loaf It is shaped like a Pear and hath a pretty tough smooth Rind of a light green Colour The inside of the Fruit is in substance much like an Apple but full of small Strings as big as a brown Thread I did never see of these Trees any where but here  The Natives of this Island are tall welllimb'd Men pretty longvisag'd with black Eyes their Noses middle proportioned and the whole Sym∣metry of their Faces agreeing very well Their Hair is black and lank and their Skins of a dark Coppercolour The Women have no Hair on  their Eyebrows I do believe it is pluckt up by the Roots for the Men had Hair growing on their Eyebrows as other People  The Men go all naked save only a long narrow piece of Cloth or Sash which going round their Wastes and thence down between their Thighs is brought up behind and tuckt in at that part which goes about the Waste The Women have a kind of a short Petticoat reaching from their Waste to their Knees  Their Language was different from any that I had ever heard before yet they had some few  Malayan  Words and some of them had a Word or two of  Portugueze  which probably they might learn aboard of their Ships passing by this place for when these Men see a Sail they do presently go aboard of them in their Canoas I did not perceive any Form of Religion that they had they had nei∣ther Temple nor Idol nor any manner of outward Veneration to any Deity that I did see  They inhabit all round the Island by the Sea∣side in the Bays there being or Houses more or less in each Bay Their Houses are built on Posts as the  Mindanayans  are They are small low and of a square form There is but one Room in each House and this Room is about foot from the Ground and from thence the Roof is raised about Foot higher But instead of a sharp Ridge the top is exceeding neatly arched with small Raf∣ters about the bigness of a Man's Arm bent round like a HalfMoon and very curiously thatcht with Palmetoleaves  They live under no Government that I could perceive for they seem to be equal without any distinction every Man ruling in his own House Their Plantations are only those Coconut Trees which grow by the Seaside their being no cleared Land farther in on the Island for I observed that  when past the FruitTrees there were no Paths to be seen going into the Woods The greatest use which they make of their CocoTrees is to draw  Toddy  from them of which they are very fond  The Melory Trees seem to grow wild they have great Earthen Pots to boil the Melory Fruit in which will hold or Gallons These Pots they fill with the Fruit and putting in a little Water they cover the Mouth of the Pot with Leaves to keep the Steam while it boils When the Fruit is soft they peel off the Rind and scrape the Pulp from the Strings with a flat Stick made like a Knife and then make it up in great Lumps as big as a  Holland  Cheese and then it will keep or days It looks yellow and tastes well and is their chief∣est Food For they have no Yams Potatoes Rice nor Plantains except a very few yet they have a few small Hogs and a very few Cocks and Hens like ours The Men employ themselves in Fishing but I did not see much Fish that they got Every House hath at least or Canoas belonging to it which they draw up ashore  The Canoas that they go a fishing in are sharp at both ends and both the sides and the bottom are very thin and smooth They are shaped some∣what like the Proes at  Guam  with one side flattish and the other with a pretty big Belly and they have small slight Outlagers on one side Being thus thin and light they are better managed with Oars than with Sails Yet they sail well enough and are steer'd with a Paddle There commonly go or Men in one of these Canoas and sel∣dom fewer than or Their Oars are short and they do not paddle but row with them as we do The Benches they sit on when they row are made of split Bamboes laid across and so near together that they look like a Deck The Bam∣boes lie moveable so that when any go in to row  they take up a Bambo in the place where they would sit and lay it by to make room for their Legs The Canoas of those of the rest of these Islands were like those of  Nicobar  and probably they were alike in other things for we saw no dif∣ference at all in the Natives of them who came hi∣ther while we were here  But to proceed with our Affairs It was as I said before the th day of  May  about in the Morn∣ing when we anchored at this Island Captain  Read  immediately ordered his Men to heel the Ship in order to clean her which was done this Day and the next All the WaterVessels were fill'd they intended to go to Sea at Night For the Winds being yet at N N E the Captain was in hopes to get over to Cape  Comorin  before the Wind shifted otherwise it would have been somewhat difficult for him to get thither because the Westerly Mon∣soon was not at hand  I thought now was my time to make my Escape by getting leave if possible to stay here for it seemed not very feasible to do it by stealth and I had no reason to despair of getting leave this being a place where my stay could probably do our Crew no harm should I design it Indeed one reason that put me on the thoughts of staying at this particular place besides the present oppor∣tunity of leaving Captain  Read  which I did al∣ways intend to do as soon I could was that I had here also a prospect of advancing a profitable Trade for Ambergrease with these People and of gaining a considerable Fortune to my self For in a short time I might have learned their Language and by accustoming my self to row with them in the Proes or Canoas especially by conforming my self to their Customs and Manners of Living I should have seen how they got their Ambergrease and have known what Quantities they get and  the time of the Year when most is found And then afterwards I thought it would be easie for me to have transported my self from thence ei∣ther in some Ship that past this way whether  En∣glish Dutch  or  Portugueze  or else to have gotten one of the young Men of the Island to have gone with me in one of their Canoas to  Achin  and there to have furnished my self with such Commodities as I found most coveted by them and therewith at my return to have bought their Ambergrease  I had till this time made no open show of go∣ing ashore here But now the Water being fill'd and the Ship in a readiness to sail I desired Cap∣tain  Read  to set me ashore on this Island He sup∣posing that I could not go ashore in a place less frequented by Ships than this gave me leave which probably he would have refused to have done if he thought I should have gotten from hence in any short time for fear of my giving an account of him to the  English  or  Dutch  I soon got up my Chest and Bedding and immediately got some to row me ashore for fear le  t his Mind should change again  The Canoa that brought me ashore landed me on a small sandy Bay where there were two Houses but no Person in them For the Inhabitants were removed to some other House probably for fear of us because the Ship was close by And yet both Men and Women came aboard the Ship without any sign of fear When our Ship's Canoa was going aboard again they met the Owner of the Houses coming ashore in his Boat He made a great many Signs to them to fetch me off again but they would not understand him Then he came to me and offered his Boat to carry me off but I refused it Then he made Signs for me to go up into the House and according as I did under∣stand him by his Signs and a few  Malayan  Words  that he used he intimated that somewhat would come out of the Woods in the night when I was asleep and kill me meaning probably some wild Beast Then I carried my Chest and Cloaths up into the House  I had not been ashore an hour before Captain  Teat  and one  John Damarel  with or armed Men more came to fetch me aboard again They need not have sent an armed  Posse  for me for had they but sent the Cabbinboy ashore for me I would not have denied going aboard For though I could have hid my self in the Woods yet then they would have abused or have kill'd some of the Natives purposely to incense them against me I told them therefore that I was ready to go with them and went aboard with all my Things  When I came aboard I found the Ship in an up∣roar for there were Men more who taking Courage by my Example desired leave also to ac∣company me One of them was the Surgeon Mr  Coppinger  the other was Mr  Robert Hall  and one named  Ambrose  I have forgot his Sirname These Men had always harboured the same Designs as I had The two last were not much opposed but Captain  Read  and his Crew would not part with the Surgeon At last the Surgeon leapt into the Canoa and taking up my Gun swore he would go ashore and that if any Man did oppose it he would shoot him But  John Oliver  who was then Quartermaster leapt into the Canoa taking hold of him took away the Gun and with the help of two or three more they dragged him again into the Ship  Then Mr  Hall  and  Ambrose  and I were again sent ashore and one of the Men that rowed us ashore stole an Ax and gave it to us knowing it was a good Commodity with the  Indians  It was now dark therefore we lighted a Candle and I  being the oldest stander in our new Country conducted them into one of the Houses where we did presently hang up our Hammocks We had scarce done this before the Canoa came ashore a∣gain and brought the  Malayan  Men belonging to  Achin  which we took in the Proe we took off of  Sumatra  and the  Portuguese  that came to our Ship out of the  Siam  Jonk at  Pulo Condore  the Crew having no occasion for these being leaving the  Malayan  Parts where the  Portuguese  Spark served as an Inter∣preter and not fearing now that the  Achinese  could be serviceable to us in bringing us over to their Country Leagues off nor imagining that we durst make such an attempt as indeed it was a bold one Now we were Men enough to defend our selves against the Natives of this Island if they should prove our Enemies though if none of these Men had come ashore to me I should not have feared any danger Nay perhaps less because I should have been cautious of giving any offence to the Natives and I am of the Opinion that there are no People in the World so barbarous as to kill a single Person that falls accidently into their Hands or comes to live among them except they have before been injured by some outrage or vio∣lence committed against them Yet even then or afterwards if a Man could but preserve his Life from their first rage and come to treat with them which is the hardest thing because their way is usually to abscond and rushing suddenly upon their Enemy to kill him at unawares one might by some slight insinuate ones self into their Favours again Especially by shewing some Toy or Knack that they didnever see before which any  European  that has seen the World might soon contrive to amuse them withal as might be done generally even with a little Fire struck with a Flint and Steel  As for the common Opinion of  Authropophagi  or Maneaters I did never meet with any such Peo∣ple All Nations or Families in the World that I have seen or heard of having some sort of Food to live on either Fruit Grain Pulse or Roots which grow naturally or else planted by them if not Fish and LandAnimals besides yea even the People of  NewHolland  had Fish amidst all their Penury and would scarce kill a Man purposely to eat him I know not what barbarous Customs may formerly have been in the World and to Sacrifice their Enemies to their Gods is a thing hath been much talked of with relation to the Sa∣vages of  America  I am a Stranger to that also if it be or have been customary in any Nation there and yet if they Sacrifice their Enemies it is not necessary they should Eat them too After all I will not be peremptory in the Negative but I speak as to the compass of my own Knowledge and know some of these Cannibal Stories to be false and many of them have been disproved since I first went to the  WestIndies  At that time how Barba∣rous were the poor  Florida Indians  accounted whieh now we find to be Civil enough what strange Stories have we heard of the  Indians  whose Islands were called the Isles of  Cannibals  Yet we find that they do Trade very civilly with the  French  and  Spaniards  and have done so with us I do own that they have formerly endeavoured to destroy our Plantations at  Barbadoes  and have since hindred us from settling the Island  Santa Loca  by destroying two or three Colonies successively of those that were settled there and even the Island  Tabago  has been often annoyed and ravaged by them when settled by the Dutch and still lies wast though a delicate Fruitful Island as being too near the  Caribbees  on the Continent who visit it every Year But this was to preserve their own right by  endeavouring to keep out any that would settle themselves on those Islands where they had plant∣ed themselves yet even these People would not hurt a single Person as I have been told by some that have been Prisoners among them I could instance also in the  Indians  of  Bocca Toro  and  Bocca Drago  and many other Places where they do live as the  Spaniards  call it Wild and Salvage yet there they have been familiar with Privateers but by A∣buses have withdrawn their Friendship again As for these  Nicobar  People I found them Affable e∣nough and therefore I did not fear them but I did not much care whether I had gotten any more Company or no  But however I was very well satisfied and the rather because we were now Men enough to row our selves over to the Island  Sumatra  and accord∣ingly we presently consulted how to purchase a Ca∣noa of the Natives  It was a fine clear Moonlight Night in which we were left ashore Therefore we walked on the sandy Bay to watch when the Ship would weigh and be gone not thinking our selves secure in our newgotten Liberty till then About or a Clock we saw her under Sail and then we returned to our Chamber and so to sleep This was the th of  May  The next Morning betimes our Landlord with or of his Friends came to see his new Guests and was somewhat surprized to see so many of us for he knew of no more but my self Yet he seemed to be very well pleased and entertain'd us with a large Calabash of Toddy which he brought with him Before he went away again for wheresoever we came they left their Houses to us but whether out of Fear or Superstition I know not we bought a Canoa of him for an Ax and we did presently put our Chests and Cloaths  in it designing to go to the Southend of the Island and lye there till the Monsoon shifted which we expected every day  When our things were stowed away we with the  Achinese  entered with joy into our new Frigot and launched off from the Shore We were no sooner off but our Canoa overset bottom up∣wards We preserved our Lives well enough by Swimming and dragg'd also our Chests and Cloaths ashore but all our things were wet I had no∣thing of value but my Journal and some Drafts of Land of my own taking which I much prized and which I had hitherto carefully preserved Mr  Hall  had also such another Cargo of Books and Drafts which were now like to perish But we pre∣sently opened our Chests and took out our Books which with much ado we did afterwards dry but some of our Drafts that lay loose in our Chests were spoiled  We lay here afterwards days making great Fires to dry our Books The  Achinese  in the mean time fixt our Canoa with Outlagers on each side and they also cut a good Mast for her and made a substantial Sail with Mats  The Canoa being now very well sixt and our Books and Cloaths dry we launched out the se∣cond time and rowed towards the Eastside of the Island leaving many Islands to the North of us The  Indians  of the Island accompanied us with or Canoas against our desire for we thought that these Men would make Provision dearer at that side of the Island we were going to by giving an account what rates we gave for it at the place from whence we came which was owing to the Ships being there for the Ships crew were not so thrifty in bargaining as they seldom are as single Persons or a few Men might be apt to be who would keep to one bargain Therefore to  hinder them from going with us Mr  Hall  scared one Canoas Crew by firing a shot over them They all leapt overboard and cried out but seeing us row away they got into their Canoa again and came after us  The firing of that Gun made all the Inhabitants of the Island to be our Enemies For presently af∣ter this we put ashore at a Bay where were four Houses and a great many Canoas but they all went away and came near us no more for seve∣ral Days We had then a great Loaf of Melory which was our constant Food and if we had a mind to Coconuts or Toddy our  Malayans  of  Achin  would climb the Trees and fetch as many Nuts as we would have and a good Pot of Tod∣dy every Morning Thus we lived till our Me∣lory was almost spent being still in hopes that the Natives would come to us and sell it as they had formerly done But they came not to us nay they opposed us whereever we came and often shaking their Lances at us made all the shew of hatred that they could invent  At last when we saw that they stood in oppo∣sition to us we resolved to use force to get some of their Food if we could not get it other ways With this Resolution we went in our Canoa to a small Bay on the North part of the Island because it was smooth water there and good land∣ing but on the other side the Wind being yet on that Quarter we could not land without jeopardy of oversetting our Canoa and wetting our Arms and then we must have lain at the mercy of our Enemies who stood or Men in every Bay where they saw us coming to keep us off  When we set out we rowed directly to the North end and presently were followed by or of their Canoas They keeping at a distance rowed away faster than we did and got to the  Bay before us and there with about more Ca∣noas full of Men they all landed and stood to hinder us from landing But we rowed in within a hundred yards of them Then we lay still and I took my Gun and presented at them at which they all fell down flat on the Ground But I turn'd my self about and to shew that we did not intend to harm them I fired my Gun off to Sea so that they might see the Shot graze on the Water Assoon as my Gun was loaden again we rowed gently in at which some of them withdrew The rest stand∣ing up did still cut and hew the Air making signs of their hatred till I once more frighted them with my Gun and discharg'd it as before Then more of them sneak'd away leaving only or Men on the Bay Then we rowed in again and Mr  Hall  taking his Sword in his Hand leapt ashore and I stood ready with my Gun to fire at the  Indians  if they had injured him But they did not stir till he came to them and saluted them  He shook them by the Hand and by such signs of Friendship as he made the Peace was concluded ra∣tified and confirmed by all that were present And others that were gone were again call'd back and they all very joyfully accepted of a Peace This be∣came universal over all the Island to the great joy of the Inhabitants There was no ringing of Bells nor Bonfires made for that is not the Custom here but Gladness appeared in their Countenances for now they could go out and fish again without fear of being taken This Peace was not more welcome to them than to us for now the Inhabitants brought their Melory again to us which we bought for old Rags and small stripes of Cloth about as broad as the Palm of ones Hand I did not see abve or Hens for they have but few on the Island At some places we saw some small Hogs which we could have  bought of them reasonably but we would not offend our  Achinese  Friends who were Mahome∣tans  We stayed here two or three days and then rowed toward the Southend of the Island keeping on the Eastside and we were kindly received by the Natives whereever we came When we arrived at the Southend of the Island we fitted our selves with Melory and Water We bought or Loaves of Melory and about large Coconut shells that had all the Kernel taken out yet were preserved whole except only a small hole at one end and all these held for us about gallons and a half of Water We bought also or Bamboes that held about or Gallons more This was our Seastore  We now design  d to go to  Achin  a Town on the N W end of the Island  Sumatra  distant from hence about leagues bearing South South East We only waited for the Western Monsoon which we had expected a great while and now it seemed to be at hand for the Clouds began to hang their Heads to the Fastward and at last moved gently that way and though the Wind was still at East yet this was an infalliable Sign that the Western Mon∣soon was nigh  CHAP XVIII  The Author with some others put to Sea in an open Boat

Afternoon when we left  Nicobar  Island directing our Course towards  Achin  being Men of us in Company  viz    English    Malay∣ans  who were born at  Achin  and the mungrel  Portuguese  Our Vessel the  Nicobar  Canoa was not one of the biggest nor of the least size She was much about the Burthen of one of our  London  Wherries below Bridge and built sharp at both ends like the fore part of a Wherry She was deeper than a Wherry but not so broad and was so thin and light that when empty Men could launch he  or hale her ashore on a sandy Bay We had a good substantial Mast and a Mat Sail and good Outlagers lasht very fast and firm on each side the Vessel being made of strong Poles So that while these continued firm the Vessel could not overset which she would easily have done without them and with them too had they not been made very strong and we were therefore much beholding to our  Achinese  Companions for this Contri∣vance  These Men were none of them so sensible of the Danger as Mr  Hall  and my self for they all con∣fided so much in us that they did not so much as scruple any thing that we did approve of Neither  was Mr  Hall  so well provided as I was for before we left the Ship I had purposely consulted our Draft of the  EastIndies  for we had but one in the Ship and out of that I had written in my Pocket∣book an account of the bearing and distance of all the  Malacca  Coast and that of  Sumatra Pegu  and  Siam  and also brought away with me a PocketCompass for my Direction in any Enterprize that I should undertake  The Weather at our setting out was very fair clear and hot The Wind was still at S F a ve∣ry small Breeze just fanning the Air and the Clouds were moving gently from West to East which gave us hopes that the Winds were either at West already abroad at Sea or would be so in a ve∣ry short time We took this opportunity of fair Weather being in hopes to accomplish our Voyage to  Achin  before the Western Monsoon was set in strong knowing that we should have very bluster∣ing Weather after this fair Weather especially at the first coming of the Western Monsoon  We rowed therefore away to the Southward supposing that when we were clear from the Island we should have a true Wind as we call it for the Land hales the Wind and we often find the Wind at Sea different from what it is near the Shore We rowed with Oars taking our turns Mr  Hall  and I steered also by turns for none of the rest were capable of it We rowed the first Afternoon and the Night ensuing about twelve Leagues by my Judgment Our Course was South South East but the th Day in the Morning when the Sun was an Hour high we saw the Island from whence we came bearing N W by N Therefore I found we had gone a point more to the East than I intended for which reason we steered S by F  In the Afternoon at a Clock we had a gentle Breeze at W S W which continued so till all which time we laid down our Oars and steered away S S E I was then at the Helm and I found by the ripling of the Sea that there was a strong Current against us It made a great noise that might be heard near half a Mile At a Clock it fell calm and so continued till Then the Wind sprung up again and blew a fresh Breeze all Night  The th Day in the Morning we lookt out for the Island  Sumatra  supposing that we were now within Leagues of it for we had rowed and sailed by our reckoning Leagues from  Nicobar  Island and the distance from  Nicobar  to  Achin  is about Leagues But we lookt in vain for the Island  Sumatra  for turning our selves about we saw to our grief  Nicobar  Island lying W N W and not above Leagues distant By this it was visible that we had met a very strong Current against us in the Night But the Wind freshned on us and we made the best use of it while the Wea∣ther continued fair At Noon we had an Obser∣vation of the Sun my lat was d m and Mr  Hall  's was d N  The th Day the Wind freshned on us again and the Sky began to be clouded It was indiffe∣rent clear till Noon and we thought to have had an Observation but we were hindred by the Clouds that covered the Face of the Sun when it came on the Meridian This often happens that we are disappointed of making Observations by the Sun's being clouded at Noon though it shines clear both before and after especially in places near the Sun and this obscuring of the Sun at Noon is commonly sudden and unexpected and for about half an hour or more  We had then also a very ill Passage by a great Circle about the Sun or times the Diameter of it which seldom appears but storms of Wind or much Rain ensue Such Circles about the Moon are more frequent but of less import We do com∣monly take great notice of these that are about the Sun observing if there be any Breach in the Cir∣cle and in what Quarter the Breach is for from thence we commoly find the greatest stress of the Wind will come I must confess that I was a little anxious at the sight of this Circle and wish'd hear∣tily that we were near some Land Yet I shewed no sign of it to discourage my Consorts but made a Vertue of Necessity and put a good Countenance on the Matter  I told Mr  Hall  that if the Wind became too strong and violent as I feared it would it being even then very strong we must of necessity steer away before the Wind and Sea till better Wea∣ther presented and that as the Winds were now we should instead of about Leagues to  Achin  be driven and Leagues to the Coast of  Cudda  or  Queda  a Kingdom and Town and Harbour of Trade on the Coast of  Malacca  The Winds therefore bearing very hard we rolled up the Foot of our Sail on a Pole fastned to it and settled our Yard within three Foot of the Canoa sides so that we had now but a small Sail yet it was still too big considering the Wind for the Wind being on our broad side prest her down very much tho' supported by her Outlagers inso∣much that the Poles of the Outlagers going from the sides of their Vessel bent as if they would break and should they have broken our over∣turning and perishing had been inevitable Besides the Sea encreasing would soon have silled the Ves∣sel this way Yet thus we made a shift to bear up with the side of the Vessel against the Wind for a  while But the Wind still increasing about one a Clock in the Afternoon we put away right before Wind and Sea continuing to run thus all the Af∣ternoon and part of the Night ensuing The Wind continued increasing all the Afternoon and the Sea still swell'd higher and often broke but did us no damage for the ends of the Vessel be∣ing very narrow he that steered received and broke the Sea on his back and so kept it from coming in so much as to endanger the Vessel Though much Water would come in which we were forced to keep heaving out continually And by this time we saw it was well that we had al∣tered our Course every Wave would else have fill'd and sunk us taking the side of the Vessel And though our Outlagers were well lash'd down to the Canoas bottom with Rattans yet they must pro∣bably have yielded to such a Sea as this when even before they were plunged under Water and bent like Twigs  The Evening of this th day was very dismal The Sky looked very black being covered with dark Clouds the Wind blew hard and the Seas ran high The Sea was already roaring in a white Foam about us a dark Night coming on and no Land in sight to shelter us and our little Ark in danger to be swallowed by every Wave and what was worst of all none of us thought our selves prepared for another World The Reader may better guess than I can express the Confusi∣on that we were all in I had been in many eminent Dangers before now some of which I have already related but the worst of them all was but a Playgame in comparison with this I must confess that I was in great Conflicts of Mind at this time Other Dangers came not up∣on me with such a leisurely and dreadful Solemni∣ty A sudden Skirmish or Engagement or so  was nothing when ones Blood was up and push'd forwards with eager Expectations But here I had a lingring view of approaching Death and little or no hopes of escaping it and I must confess that my Courage which I had hitherto kept up failed me here and I made very sad Reflections on my former Life and look'd back with Horrour and Detestation on Actions which before I dis∣liked but now I trembled at the remembrance of I had long before this repented me of that roving course of life but never with such concern as now I did also call to mind the many miraculous Acts of God's Providence towards me in the whole course of my Life of which kind I believe few Men have met with the like For all these I re∣turned Thanks in a peculiar manner and this once more desired God's assistance and composed my Mind as well as I could in the hopes of it and as the Event shew'd I was not disappointed of my Hopes  Submitting our selves therefore to God's good Providence and taking all the care we could to preserve our Lives Mr  Hall  and I took turns to steer and the rest took turns to heave out the Water and thus we provided to spend the most doleful Night I ever was in About a clock it began to Thunder Lighten and Rain but the Rain was very welcome to us having drank up all the Water we brought from the Island  The Wind at first blew harder than before but within half an hour it abated and became more moderate and the Sea also asswaged of its Fury and then by a lighted Match of which we kept a piece burning on purpose we looked on our Compass to see how we steered and found our Course to be still East We had no occasion to look on the Compass before for we steered right before the Wind which if it shifted we  had been obliged to have altered our Course ac∣cordingly But now it being abated we found our Vessel lively enough with that small Sail which was then aboard to hale to our former Course S S E which accordingly we did being now in hopes again to get to the Island  Sumatra  But about a clock in the Morning of the th day we had another Gust of Wind with much Thunder Lightning and Rain which lasted till Day and obliged us to put before the Wind a∣gain steering thus for several Hours It was very dark and the hard Rain soaked us so throughly that we had not one dry Thread about us The Rain chill'd us extreamly for any fresh Water is much colder than that of the Sea For even in the coldest Climates the Sea is warm and in the hottest Climates the Rain is cold and unwholse∣some for Man's Body In this wet starveling plight we spent the tedious Night Never did poor Ma∣riners on a Leeshore more earnestly long for the dawning Light than we did now At length the Day appeared but with such dark black Clouds near the Horizon that the sirst glimpse of the Dawn appeared or degrees high which was dreadful enough for it is a common Saying a∣mong Seamen and true as I have experienced that a  high Dawn  will have  high Winds  and a  low Dawn small Winds  We continued our Course still East before Wind and Sea till about a Clock in the morning of this th day and then one of our  Malayan  Friends cried out  Pulo Way  Mr  Hall  and  Ambrose  and I thought the Fellow had said  Pull away  an Ex∣pression usual among  English  Seamen when they are Rowing And we wondered what he meant by it till we saw him point to his Consorts and then we looking that way saw Land appearing like an Island and all our  Malayans  said it was an  Island at the N W end of  Sumatra  called  Way  for  Pulo Way  is the Island  Way  We who were dropping with Wet Cold and Hungry were all over joyed at the sight of the Land and presently marked its bearing It bore South and the Wind was still at West a strong gale but the Sea did not run so high as in the Night Therefore we trimmed our small Sail no bigger than a Apron and steered with it Now our Outlagers did us a great kindness again for although we had but a small Sail yet the Wind was strong and prest down our Vessel's side very much But being supported by the Outlagers we could brook it well enough which otherwise we could not have done  About Noon we saw more Land beneath the supposed  Pulo Way  and steering towards it before Night we saw all the Coast of  Sumatra  and found the Errors of our  Achinesc  for the high Land that we first saw which then appear'd like an Island was not  Pulo Way  but a great high Mountain on the Island  Sumatra  called by the English the  Golden Mountain  Our Wind continued till about a Clock at night then it abated and at a Clock it died away And then we stuck to our Oars a∣gain tho all of us quite tired with our former Fa∣tigues and Hardships  The next Morning being the th day we saw all the low Land plain and judged our selves not above Leagues off About Clock in the Morn∣ing we had the Wind again at West a fresh gale and steering in still for the Shore a a Clock in the Afternoon we run to the Mouth of a River on the Island  Sumatra  called  Passange Jonca  It is Leagues to the Eastward of  Achin  and Leagues to the West of  Diamond Point  which makes with three Angles of a Rhombus and is low Land  Our  Malayans  were very well acquainted here and carried us to a small Fishing Village within a  Mile of the River's Mouth called also by the name of the River  Passange Jonca  The Hardships of this Voyage with the scorching heat of the Sun at our first setting out and the cold Rain and our con∣tinuing Wet for the last two days cast us all into Fevers so that now we are not able to help each other nor so much as to get our Canoa up to the Village but our  Malayans  got some of the Towns∣men to bring her up  The News of our Arrival being noised abroad one of the  Oramkai  's or Noblemen of the Island came in the Night to see us We were then lying in a small Hut at the end of the Town and it being late this Lord only viewed us and having spoken with our  Malayans  went away again but he returned to us again the next day and pro∣vided a large House for us to live in till we should be recovered of our Sickness ordering the TownsPeople to let us want for nothing The  Achinese Malayans  that came with us told them all the Cir∣cumstances of our Voyage how they were taken by our Ship and where and how we that came with them were Prisoners aboard the Ship and had been set ashore together at  Nccobar  as they were It was for this Reason probably that the Gentlemen of  Sumatra  were thus extraordinary kind to us to provide every thing that we had need of nay they would force us to accept of Presents from them that we knew not what to do with as young Buffaloes Goats  c  for these we would turn loose at Night after the Gentle∣men that gave them to us were gone for we were prompted by our  Achinese  Consorts to accept of them for fear of disobliging by our Refusal But the CocoNuts Plaintains Fowls Eggs Fish and Rice we kept for our use The  Malayans  that accompanied us from  Nicobar  separated them∣selves from us now living at one end of the House  by themselves for they were  Mahometans  as all those of the Kingdom of  Achin  are and though during our Passage by Sea together we made them be con∣tented to drink their Water out of the same Coco∣shell with us yet being now no longer under that Necessity they again took up their accustomed Ni∣cety and Reservedness They all lay sick and as their sickness increased one of them threatened us that if any of them died the rest would kill us for having brought them this Voyage yet I que∣stion whether they would have attempted or the Country People have suffered it We made a shift to dress our own Food for none of these People though they were very kind in giving us any thing that we wanted would yet come near us to assist us in dressing our Victuals Nay they would not touch any thing that we used We had all Fevers and therefore took turns to dress Victuals accord∣ing as we had strength to do it or Stomachs to eat it I found my Fever to increase and my Head so distempered that I could scarce stand therefore I whetted and sharpened my Penkife in order to let my self Blood but I could not for my Knife was too blunt  We stayed here ten or twelve days in hopes to recover our Health but finding no amendment we desired to go to  Achin  But we were delayed by the Natives who had a desire to have kept Mr  Hall  and my self to Sail in their Vessels to  Malacca Cudda  or to other places whither they Trade But finding us more desirous to to be with our Countrymen in our Factory at  Achin  they provided a large Proe to carry us thither we not being able to manage our own Canoa Besides before this three of our  Ma∣layan  Comrades were gone very sick into the Coun∣try and only one of them and the  Portuguese  re∣mained with us accompanying us to  Achin  and they both as sick as we  It was the beginning of  June  when we left  Passange Jonca  We had men to row one to steer and a Gentleman of the Country that went puprosely to give an Information to the Go∣vernment of our Arrival We were but three days and nights in our Passage having Seabreezes by day and Landwinds by night and very fair Weather  When we arrived at  Achin  I was carried before the  Shabander  the chief Magistrate in the City One Mr  Dennis Driscall  and  Irishman  and a Resi∣dent there in the Factory which our  East India  Company had there then was Interpreter I be∣ing weak was suffered to stand in the  Shabander  's Presence For it is their custom to make men sit on the Floor as they do cross legg'd like Taylors But I had not strength then to pluck up my Heels in that manner The  Shabander  asked of me se∣veral Questions especially how we durst adventure to come in a Canoa from the  Nicobar  Islands to  Su∣matra  I told him that I had been accustomed to hardships and hazards therefore I did with much freedom undertake it He enquired also concern∣ing our Ship whence she came  c  I told him from the  South Seas  that she had ranged about the  Philippine  Islands  c  and was now gone to∣wards  Arabia  and the  Red Sea  The  Malayans  also and  Portuguese  were afterward examined and con∣fimed what I declared and in less than half an Hour I was dismist with Mr  Priscal  who then lived in the  English East India  Company's Factory He provided a Room for us to lie in and some Victuals  Three Days after our arrival here our  Portuguese  died of a Fever What became of our  Malayans  I know not  Ambrose  lived not long after Mr  Hall  also was so weak that I did not think he would  recover I was the best yet still very sick of a Fever and little likely to live Therefore Mr  Dris∣cal  and some other Englishmen perswaded me to take some Purging Physick of a  Malayan  Doctor I took their advice being willing to get Ease But after three Doses each a large Calabash of nasty stuff finding no amendment I thought to desist from more Physick but was perswaded to take one Dose more which I did and it wrought so violently that I thought it would have ended my days I struggled till I had been about or times at Stool But it working so quick with me with little Intermission and my Strength being almost spent I even threw my self down once for all and had above Stools in all before it left off working I thought my  Malayan  Doctor whom they so much commended would have killed me outright I con∣tinued extraordinary Weak for some days after his Drenching me thus But my Fever left me for a∣bove a week After which it returned upon me again for a Twelve Month and a Flux with it  However when I was a little recovered from the Effects of my Drench I made a shift to go abroad And having been kindly invited to Capt  Bowrey  's House there my first visit was to him who had a Ship in the Road but lived ashore This Gentleman was extraordinary kind to us all par∣ticularly to me and importuned me to go his Boatsawain to  Persia  whither he was bound with a design to sell his Ship there as I was told though not by himself From thence he intended to pass with the Caravan to  Aleppo  and so home for  Eng∣land  His Business required him to stay some time longer at  Achin  I judge to sell some Commodities that he had not yet disposed of Yet he chose ra∣ther to leave the disposal of them to some Mer∣chant there and make a short trip to the  Nicobar  Islands in the mean time and on his return to take  in his Effects and so proceed towards  Persia  This was a sudden Resolution of Captain  Bowry  's pre∣sently after the arrival of a small Frigot from  Siam  with an Ambassador from the King of  Siam  to the Queen of  Achin  The Ambassador was a  Frenchman  by Nation The Vessel that he came in was but small yet very well mann'd and fitted for a Fight Therefore it was generally supposed here that Captain  Bowry  was afraid to lie in  Achin  Road because the  Siamers  were now at Wars with the  English  and he was not able to defend his Ship if should be attack'd by them  But whatever made him think of going to the  Nicobar  Islands he provided to Sail and took me Mr  Hall  and  Ambrose  with him though all of us so sick and weak that we could do him no service It was some time about the beginning of  June  when we sailed out of  Achin  Road But we met with the Winds at N W with turbulent Weather which forced us back again in two days time Yet he gave us each  Mess  apiece a Gold Coin each of which is about the Value of  d English  So he gave over that Design And some English Ships coming into  Achin  Road he was not afraid of the  Siamers  who lay there  After this he again invited me to his House at  Achin  and treated me always with Wine and good Cheer and still importuned me to go with him to  Persia  But I being very weak and fearing the Westerly Winds would create a great deal of trouble did not give him a positive Answer especially be∣cause I thought I might get a better Voyage in the  English  Ships newly arrived or some others now expected here It was this Captain  Bowry  who sent the Letter from  Borneo  directed to the Chief of the  English  Factory at  Mindanto  of which mention is made in Chapter XIII  A short time after this Captain  Welden  arrived here from  Fort St George  in a Ship called the  Cur∣tana  bound to  Tonqueen  This being a more agree∣able Voyage than to  Persia  at this time of the year besides that the Ship was better accommodated especially with a Surgeon and I being still sick I therefore chose rather to serve Captain  Welden  than Captain  Bowry  But to go on with a particular ac∣count of that Expedition were to carry my Reader back again Whom having brought thus far to∣wards  England  in my CircumNavigation of the Globe I shall not weary him with new Ram∣bles nor so much swell this Volume as I must to describe the Tour I made in those remote Parts of the  East Indies  from and to  Sumatra  So that my Voyage to  Tonqueen  at this time as also another to  Malacca  afterwards with my observations in them and the descriptions of those and the Neighbouring Countries as well as the description of the Island  Sumatra  it self and therein the Kingdom and City of  Achin Bencouli c  I shall refer to another place where I may give a particular Relation of them In short it may suffice that I set out to  Tonqueen  with Captain  Welden  about  July  and returned to  Achin  in the  April  following I staid here till the latter end of  Septemb  and making a short Voyage to  Malacca  came thither again about  Christ∣mas  Soon after that I went to  Fort St George  and staying thereabout five months I returned once more to  Sumatra  not to  Achin  but  Bencouli  an  English  Factory on the West Coast of which I was Gun∣ner about five months more  So that having broght my Reader to  Sumatra  without carrying him back I shall bring him on next way from thence to  England  And of all that occurr'd between my first setting out from this Island in and my final depature from it at the beginning of the Year I shall only take  notice at present of two Passages which I think I ought not to omit  The first is that at my return from  Malacca  a little before  Christmas  I found at  Achin  one Mr  Morgan  who was one of our Ships Crew that left me ashoar at  Nicobar  now Mate of a  Danish  Ship of  Trangambar  which is a Town on the Coast of  Coromandel  near Cape  Comorin  belonging to the  Danes  And receiving an account of our Crew from him and others I thought it might not be amiss to gratifie the Readers Curiosity therewith who would probably be desirous to know the success of those Ramblers in their new intended Expedition towards the  Red Sea  And withal I thought it might not be unlikely that these Papers might fall into hands of some of our  London  Merchants who were concerned in fitting out that Ship which I said formerly was called the  Cygnet of London  sent on a Trading Voyage into the  South Seas  under the Command of Captain  Swan  And that they might be willing to have a particular Information of the fate of their Ship And by the way even before this meeting with Mr  Morgan  while I was at  Ten∣queen Jan  I met with an  English  Ship in the River of  Tenqueen  called the  Rainbow of London  Captain  Poole  Commander by whose Mate Mr  Barlow  who was returning in that Ship to  Eng∣land  I sent a Pacquet which he undertook to de∣liver to the Merchants Owners of the  Cygnet  some of which he said he knew Wherein I gave a par∣ticular account of all the Course and Transactions of their Ship from the time of my first meeting it in the  South Seas  and going aboard it there to its leaving me ashoar at  Nicobar  But I never could hear that either that or other Letters which I sent at the same time were received  To proceed therefore with  Morgan  's Relation He told me That when they in the  Cygnet  went  away from  Nicobar  in pursuit of their intendedVoyage to  Persia  they directed their Course to wards  Ceylon  But not being able to Weather it the Westerly Monsoon being hard against them they were oblidged to seek Refreshment on the Coast of  Coromandel  Here this mad fickle Crew were upon new projects again Their Designs meet∣ing with such delays and obstructions that many of them grew weary of it and about half of them went ashoar Of this number Mr  Morgan  who told me this and Mr  Herman Copinger  the Surge∣on went to the  Danes  at  Trangambar  who kindly received them There they lived very well and Mr  Morgan  was employed as a Mate in a Ship of theirs at this time to  Achin  and Captain  Knox  tells me that he since Commanded the  Curtana  the Ship that I went in to  Tonqueen  which Cap∣tain  Welden  having sold to the Mogul's Subjects they employed Mr  Morgan  as Captain to Trade in her for them and it is an usual thing for the Trading  Indians  to hire  Europeans  to go Officers on board their Ships especially Captains and Gunners  About two or three more of these that were set ashore went to  Fort St George  but the main body of them were for going into the Mogul's Ser∣vice Our Seamen are apt to have great notions of I know not what Profit and Advantages to be had in serving the Mogul nor do they want for fine stories to encourage one another to it It was what these men had long been thinking and talking of as a fine thing but now they went upon it in good earnest The Place where they went ashore was at a Town of the  Moors  Which name our Seamen give to all the Subjects of the great Mogul but especially his  Mahometan  Subjects cal∣ling the Idolaters  Gentous  or  Rashbouts  At this  Moors  Town they got a Peun to be their Guide to  the Mogul's nearest Camp For he hath always se∣veral Armies in his vast Empire  These Peuns are some of the  Gentous  or  Rashbouts  who in all places along the Coast especially in Sea∣port Towns make it their business to hire them∣selves to wait upon Strangers be they Merchants Seamen or what they will To qualifie them for such attendance they learn the  European  languages  English Dutch French Portuguese c  according as they have any of the Factories of these Nations in their Neighbourhood or are visited by their Ships No sooner doth any such Ship come to an Anchor and the Men come ashore but a great many of these Peuns are ready to proffer their service 'Tis usual for the Strangers to hire their Attendance du∣ring their stay there giving them about a Crown a Month of our Money more or less The richest sort of men will ordinarily hire or Peuns to wait upon them and even the common Seamen if able will hire one a piece to attend them either for Convenience or Ostentation or sometimes one Peun between two of them These Peuns serve them in many Capacities as Interpreters Brokers Servants to attend at Meals and go to Market and on Errands  c  Nor do they give any trouble eating at their own Homes and Lodging there when they have done their Masters business for them expecting nothing but their Wages except that they have a certain allowance of about a Fanam or  d  in a Dollar which is an th part profit by way of Brokerage for every Bargain they drive they being generally employed in Buying and Selling When the Strangers go away their Peuns desire them to give them their Names in Writing with a Certificate of their honest and diligent serving 'em And these they shew to the next Comers to get into Business some being able to produce a large Scrowl of such Certificates  But to proceed the  Moors  Town where the  men landed was not far from  Cunnimere  a small English Factory on the  Coromondel  Coast The Go∣vernour whereof having intelligence by the  Moors  of the landing of these men and their intended March to the Mogul's Camp sent out a Captain with his Company to oppose it He came up with them and gave them hard Words But they being or resolute Fellows not easily daunted he durst not attack them but returned to the Gover∣nour and the News of it was soon carried to  Fort St George  During their March  John Oliver  who was one of them privately told the Peun who guided them that himself was their Captain So when they came to the Camp the Peun told this to the General And when their Stations and Pay were assigned them  John Oliver  had a greater re∣spect paid him than the rest and whereas their Pay was ten Pagodas a Month each Man a Pagoda is two Dollar or  s  English his Pay was twenty Pagodas Which Stratagem and Usurpation of his occasioned him no small Envy and Indignation from his Comrades  Soon after this or of them went to  Agra  to be of the Mogul's Guard A while after the Go∣vernour of  Fort St George  sent a message to the main Body of them and a Pardon to withdraw them from thence which most of them accepted and came away  John Oliver  and the small remainder continued in the Country but leaving the Camp went up and down plundering the Villages and fleeing when they were pursued and this was the last News I heard of them This Account I had partly by Mr  Morgan  from some of those Deser∣ters he met with at  Trangambar  partly from others of them whom I met with my self afterwards at  Fort St George  And these were the Adventures of those who went up into the Country  Captain  Read  having thus lost the best half of his Men sailed away with the rest of them after ha∣ving filled his Water and got Rice still intending for the  Red Sea  When they were near  Ceylon  they met with a  Portuguese  Ship richly laden out of which they took what they pleas'd and then turn'd her away again From thence they pursued their Voyage but the westerly Winds bearing hard against them and making it hardly feizable for them to reach the  Red Sea  they stood away for  Madagascar  There they entred into the Service of one of the petty Princes of that Island to assist him against his Neighbours with whom he was at Wars During this Interval a small Vessel from  NewYork  came hither to purchase Slaves Which Trade is driven here as it is upon the Coast of  Guinea  one Nation or Clan selling others that are their Enemies Captain  Read  with about or more stole away from their Crew and went aboard this  NewYork  Ship and Captain  Teat  was made Com∣mander of the Residue Soon after which a Bri∣gantine from the  West Indies  Captain  Knight  Com∣mander coming thither with design to go to the  Red Sea  also these of the  Cygnet  consorted with them and they went together to the Island  Jo∣hanna  Thence going together towards the  Red Sea  the  Cygnet  proving leaky and Sailing heavily as being much out of repair Captain  Knight  grew weary of her Company and giving her the slip in the Night went away for  Achin  for having heard that there was plenty of Glod there he went thi∣ther with a design to cruize And 'twas from one Mr  Humes  belonging to the  Ann  of  London  Capt  Freke  Commander who had gone aboard Captain  Knight  and whom I saw afterwards at  Achin  that I had this Relation Some of Captain  Freke  's men their own Ship being lost and gone aboard the  Cygnet  at  Johanna  And after Capt  Knight  had left  her she still pursued her Voyage towards the  Red Sea  But the Winds being against them and the Ship in so ill a condition they were forced to bear away for  Coromandel  where Capt  Teat  and his own men went ashore to serve the Mogul But the Strangers of Capt  Freke  's Ship who kept still aboard the  Cygnet  undertook to carry her for  Eng∣land  and the last News I heard of the  Cygnet  was from Captain  Knox  who tells me that she now lies sunk in St  Augustin  's Bay in  Madagascar  This Digression I have made to give an account of our Ship  The other Passage I shall speak of that occurred during this interval of the Tour l made from  Achin  is with relation to the Painted Prince whom I brought with me into  England  and who died at  Oxford  For while I was at  Fort St George  about  April  there arrived a Ship called the  Min∣danao  Merchant laden with Clovebark from  Min∣danao  Three of Capt  Swan  's men that remain'd there when we went from thence came in her From whom I had the account of Captain  Swan  's death as is before related There was also one Mr  Moody  who was Supercargo of the Ship This Gentle∣man bought at  Mindanao  the Painted Prince  Jeoly  mentioned in Chapter XIII and his Mother and brought them to  Fort St George  where they were much admired by all that saw them Some time after this Mr  Moody  who spoke the  Malay∣an  Language very well and was a person very capa∣ble to manage the Company's Affairs was ordered by the Governour of  Fort St George  to prepare to go to  Indrapore  an  English  Factory on the West Coast of  Sumatra  in order to succeed Mr  Gibbons  who was chief of that Place  By this time I was very intimately acquainted with Mr  Moody  and was importun'd by him to go with him and to be Gunner of the Fort there I  always told him I had a great desire to go to the Bay of  Bengal  and that I had now an offer to go thither with Capt  Metcalf  who wanted a Mate and had already spoke to me Mr  Moody  to en∣courage me to go with him told me that if I would go with him to  Indrapore  he would buy a small Vessel there and send me to the Island  Mean∣gis  Commander of her and that I should carry Prince  Jeoly  and his Mother with me that being their Country by which means I might gain a Commerce with his People for Cloves  This was a design that I liked very well and there∣fore I consented to go thither It was some time in  July  when we went from  Fort St George  in a small Ship called the  Diamond  Capt  Howel  Commander We were about or Passengers in all some ordered to be left at  Indrapore  and some at  Bencouli  Five or six of us were Officers the rest Soldiers to the Company We met nothing in our Voyage that deserves notice till we came abrest of  Indrapore  And then the wind came at N W and blew so hard that we could not get in but were forced to bear away to  Bencouli  another  English  Fa∣ctory on the same Coast lying or Leagues to the Southward of  Indrapore  Upon our arrival at  Bencouli  we saluted the Fort and were welcomed by them The same day we came to an Anchor and Captain  Howel  and Mr  Moody  with the other Merchants went ashoar and were all kindly received by the Covernour of the Fort It was two days before I went ashoar and then I was importuned by the Gover∣nour to stay there to be Gunner of this Fort be∣cause the Gunner was lately dead And this being a place of greater import than  Indrapore  I should do the Company more Service here than there I told the Governour if he would augment my Sallary which by Agreement with the Governour of  Fort St George  I was to have had at  Indrapore  I was willing to serve him provided Mr  Moody  would consent to it As to my Sallary he told me I should have Dollars  per  month which was as much as he gave to the old Gunner  Mr  Moody  gave no Answer till a Week after and then being ready to be gone to  Indrapore  he told me I might use my own Liberty either to stay here or go with him to  Indrapore  He added that if I went with him he was not certain as yet to perform his promise in getting a Vessel for me to go to  Meangas  with  Jeoly  and his Mother But he would be so fair to me that because I left  Maderas  on his account he would give me the half share of the two Painted People and leave them in my Possession and at my Disposal I accepted of the Offer and Writings were immediatly drawn be∣tween us  Thus it was that I came to have this Painted Prince whose Name was  Jeoly  and his Mother They were born on a small Island called  Meangis  which is once or twice mentioned in Chap XIII I saw the Island twice and two more close by it Each of the three seemed to be about four or five Leagues round and of a good heighth  Jeoly  himself told me that they all three abounded with Gold Cloves and Nutmegs For I shewed him some of each sort several times and he told me in the  Ma∣layan  Language which he spake indifferent well  Meangis Hadda Madochala se Bullawan  That is there is abundance of Gold at  Meangis Bullawan  I have observed to be the common word for Gold at  Mindanao  but whether the pro∣per  Malayan  word I know not for I found much difference between the  Malayan  Language as it was spoken at  Mindanao  and the Language on the Coast of  Malacca  and  Achin  When I shewed him Spice he would not only tell me that there was  Madochala  that is abundance but to make it ap∣pear more plain he would also shew me the Hair of his Head a thing frequent among all the  Indians  that I have met with to shew their Hair when they would express more than they can number He told me also that his Father was  Raja  of the Island where they lived That there were not above Thirty Men on the Island and about one Hun∣dred Women That he himself had Wives and eight Children and that one of his Wives painted him  He was painted all down the Brreast between his Shoulders behind on his Thighs mostly be∣fore and in the form of several broad Rings or Bracelets round his Arms and Legs I cannot liken the Drawings to any Figure of Animals or the like but they were very curious full of great variety of Lines Flourishes Chequered Work  c  keeping a very graceful Proportion and appearing very Artificial even to wonder especially that upon and between his Shoulderblades By the Account he gave me of the manner of doing it I understood that the Painting was done in the same manner as the  Jerusalemcross  is made in Mens Arms by pricking the Skin and rubbing in a Pig∣ment But whereas Powder is used in mak∣ing the  Jerusalemcross  they at  Meangis  use the Gum of a Tree beaten to Powder called by  Eng∣lish  Dammer which is used instead of Pitch in many Parts of  India  He told me that most of the Men and Women on the Island were thus painted And also that they had all Ear Rings made of Gold and Gold Shaekles about their Legs and Arms That their common Food of the Produce of the Land was Potatoes and Yames That they had plenty of Cocks and Hens but no other tame Fowl He said that Fish of which he was a great Lover as wild  Indians  generally are was very plentiful  about the Island and that they had Canoas and went a fishing frequently in them and that they often visited the other two small Islands whose inhabitants speak the same Language as they did which was so unlike the  Malayan  which he had learnt while he was a Slave at  Mindanao  that when his Mother and he were talking together in their  Meangian  Tongue I could not understand one Word they said And indeed all the  Indians  who speak  Malayan  who are the Trading and po∣liter sort lookt on these  Meangians  as a kind of  Barbarians  and upon any occasion of dislike would call them  Bobby  that is Hoggs the greatest expres∣sion of Contempt that can be especially from the mouth of  Malayans  who are generally  Mahometans  and yet the  Malayans  every where call a Woman  Babby  by a name not much different and  Mamma  signifies a Man Tho' these two last words proper∣ly denote Male and Female And as  Ejam  signifies a Fowl so  Ejam Mamma  is a Cock and  Ejam Babbi  is a Hen But this by the way  He said also that the Customs of those other Isles and their manner of living was like theirs and that they were the only People with whom they had any Converse And that one time as he with his Father Mother and Brother with two or three Men more were going to one of these other Islands they were driven by a strong Wind on the Coast of  Mindanao  where they were taken by the Fishermen of that Island and carried ashoar and sold as Slaves they being first stript of their Gold Ornaments I did not see any of the Gold that they wore but there were great holes in their Ears by which it was manifest that they had worn some Ornaments in them  Jeoly  was sold to one  Michael  a  Mindanayan  that spoke good  Spanish  and commonly waited on  Raja Laut  serving him as our Interpreter where the  Raja  was at a loss in any  word for  Michael  understood it better He did often beat and abuse his painted Servant to make him work but all in vain for neither fair means threats nor blows would make him work as he would have him Yet he was very timerous and could not endure to see any sort of Weapons and he often told me that they had no Arms at  Meangis  they having no Enemies to fight with  I knew this  Michael  very well while we were at  Mindanao  I suppose that Name was given him by the  Spaniards  who baptized many of them at the time when they had footing at that Island But at the deparrure of the  Spaniards  they were  Mahometans  again as before Some of our People lay at this  Michael  's house whose Wife and Daugh∣ter were  Pagallies  to some of them I often saw  Jeoly  at his Master  Michael  's House and when I came to have him so long after he remembred me again I did never see his Father nor Brother n  any of the others that were taken with them  Jeoly  came several times aboard our Ship when we lay at  Mindanao  and gladly accepted of such Victu∣als as we gave him for his Master kept him at very short Commons  Prince  Jeoly  lived thus a Slave at  Mindanao  or Years till at last Mr  Moody  bought him and his Mother for Dollars and as is before related carried him to  Fort St George  and from thence a∣long with me to  Bencouli  Mr  Moody  stayed at  Bencouli  about three weeks and then went back with Captain  Howel  to  Indrapore  leaving  Jeoly  and his Mother with me They lived in a House by themselves without the Fort I had no employ∣ment for them but they both employed them∣selves She used to make and mend their own Cloaths at which she was not very expert for they wear no Cloaths at  Meangis  but only a Claoth about their Wastes And he busied himself in  making a Chest with Boards and a few Nails that he begged of me It was but an ill shaped odd thing yet he was as proud of it as if it had been the rarest piece in the World After some time they were both taken sick and though I took as much care of them as if they had been my Bro∣ther and Sister yet she died I did what I could to comfort  Jeoly  but he took on extreamly inso∣much that I feared him also Therefore I caused a Grave to be made presently to hide her out of his sight I had her shrowded decently in a piece of new Callico but  Jeoly  was not so satisfied for he wrapped all her Cloaths about her and two new pieces of Chints that Mr  Moody  gave her saying that they were his Mothers and she must have 'em I would not disoblige him for fear of endangering his Life and I used all possible means to recover his health but I found little amendment while we stay'd here  In the little Printed Relation that was made of him when he was shewn for a Sight in  England  there was a Romantick Story of a Beautiful Sister of his a Slave with them at  Mindanao  and of the Sultans falling in Love with her but these were Stories indeed They reported also that his Paint was of such Vertue that Serpents and Venemous Creatures would flee from him for which rea∣son I suppose they represented so many Serpents scampering about in the Printed Picture that was made of him But I never knew any Paint of such Vertue and as for  Jeoly  I have seen him as much afraid of Snakes Scorpions or Centapees as my self  Having given this account of the Ship that left me at  Nicobar  and of my Painted Prince whom I brought with me to  Bencouli  I shall now proceed on with the Relation of my Voyage thence to  En∣gland  after I have given this short Account  of the occasion of it and the manner of my get∣ting away  To say nothing therefore now of that place and my Employment there as Gunner of the Fort the Year drew towards an end and not finding the Governour keep to his agreement with me nor seeing by his carriage towards others any great reason I had to expect he would I began to wish my self away again I saw so much Igno∣rance in him with respect to his charge being much fitter to be a Bookkeeper than Governour of a Fort and yet so much insolence and cruelty with respect to those under him and rashness in his management of the  Malayan  Neighbourhood that I soon grew weary of him not thinking my self very safe indeed under a Man whose hu∣mours were so brutish and barbarous I forbear to mention his name after such a Character nor do I care to fill these Papers with particular stories of him But therefore give this intimation because as it is the interest of the Nation in general so is it especially of the Honourable  East India  Compa∣ny to be informed of abuses in their Factories And I think the Company might receive great ad∣vantage by strictly enquiring into the behaviour of those wh  they entrust with any Command For  which reflects back upon the Superiours from the misdoings of their Servants how undeservedly soever the  e are great and last∣i  g mischiefs proceed from the Tyranny or Igno∣rant rashness of some petty Governours Those under them are discouraged from their Service by it  and often go away to the  Dutch  the Mogul or  Malayan  Princes to the great detriment of our Trade and even the Trade and the Ports them∣selves are many times in danger by indiscreet pro∣vocations given to the Neighbouring Nations who are best managed as all Mankind are by Ju∣stice  and fair dealings nor any more impla∣cably revengeful than those  Malayans  who live in the Neighbourhood of  Benc  li  which Fort ha  h been more than once in danger of being surpriz'd by them I speak not this out of disgust to this particular Governour much less would I seem to reflect on any others of whom I know nothing a¦miss But as it is not to be wondered at  should not know how to demean themselves in places of Power for which neither their Education nor their business possibly have sufficiently qualified them so it will be the more necessary for the Honourable Company to have the closer eye over them and as much as may be to prevent or re∣form any abuses they may be guilty of and 'tis purely out of my Zeal for theirs and the Nation's interest that I have given this caution having seen too much occasion for it  I had other Motives also for my going away I began to long after my Native Country after so tedious a ramble from it and I proposed no small advantage to my self from my Painted Prince whom Mr  Moody  had left entirely to my disposal only reserving to himself his right to one half share in him For beside what might be gained by shew∣ing him in  England  I was in hopes that when I had got some Money I might there obtain what I had in vain sought for in the  Indies viz  A Ship from the Merchants wherewith to carry him back to  Meangis  and reinstate him there in his own Country and by his Favour and Negotiation to establish a traffick for the Spices and other products of those Islands  Upon these Projects I went to the Governour and Council and desired that I might have my discharge to go for  England  with the next Ship that came The Council  hought it resonable and they consented to it he also give me his word  that I should go Upon the d of  January  there came to Anchor in  Bencouli  Road the  Defence  Captain  Heath  Commander bound for  England  in te service of the Company They had been at  Indrapore  where Mr  Moody  then was and he had made over his share in Prince  Jeoly  to Mr  Goddard  chief Mate of the Ship Upon his coming on shoar he shewed me Mr  Moody  's wri∣tings and lookt upon  Jeoly  who had been sick for Months in all which time I tended him as carefully as if he had been my Brother I agreed matters with Mr  Goddard  and sent  Jeoly  on board intending to follow him as I could and desiring Mr  Goddard  's assistance to fetch me off and con∣ceal me aboard the Ship if there should be occa∣sion which he promised to do and the Captain promised to entertain me For it proved as I had foreseen that upon Captain  Heath  's arrival the Governor repented him of of his Promise and would not suffer me to depart I importun'd him all I could but in vain so did Captain  Heath  also but to no purpose In short after several essays I slipt away at midnight understanding the Ship was to sail away the next morning and that they had taken leave of the Fort and creeping through one of the Portholes of the Fort I got to the shoar where the Ships Boat waited for me and carried me on board I brought with me my Journal and most of my written Papers but some Papers and Books of value I left in haste and all my Furniture being glad I was my self at liberty and had hopes of seeing  England  again  CHAP XX  The Author's departure from  Bencouli  on board the  Defence  under Captain  Heath  Of a Fight between some  French  Men of War from  Ponticheri  and

large Pomgranates and good Wines The Land Animals A very beautiful kind of  Onager  or wild Ass striped regularly bla  k and white Ostrages Fish Seales The  Dutch  Fort and Factory Their fine Garden Tbe Traffick here  BEing thus got on board the  Defence  I was con∣cealed there till a Boat which came from the Fort laden with Pepper was gone off again And then we set sail for the Cape of  Good Hope Jan  and made the best of our way as Wind and Weather would permit expecting there to  meet  English  Ships more bound home from the  Indies  for the War with the  French  having been proclaimed at  Fort St George  a little before Cap∣tain  Heath  came from thence he was willing to have company home if he could  A little before this War was proclaimed there was an Engagement in the Road of  Fort St George  between some  French  Men of War and some  Dutch  and  English  Ships at anchor in the Road which because there is such a plausible Story made of it in Monsieur  Duquesne  's late Voyage to the  East Indies  I shall give a short account of as I had it particu∣larly related to me by the Gunners Mate of Capt  Heath  's Ship a very sensible Man and several o∣thers of his Men who were in the Action The  Dutch  have a Fort on the Coast of  Coromandel  called  Pallacat  about Leagues to the Northward of  Fort St George  Upon some occasion or other the  Dutch  sent some Ships thither to fetch away their effects and transport them to  Batavia  Acts of Hostility were already begun between the  French  and  Dutch  and the  French  had at this time a Squa∣dron newly arrived in  India  and lying at  Ponticheri  a  French  Fort on the same Coast Southward of  Fort St George  The  Dutch  in returning to  Batavia  were obliged to coast it along by  Fort St George  and  Ponticheri  for the sake of the Wind but when they came near this last they saw the  French  Men of War lying at Anchor there and should they have proceeded along the Shore or stood out to Sea expected to be pursued by them They there∣fore turned back again for though their Ships were of a pretty good force yet were they unsit for Fight as having great Loads of Goods and many Passengers Women and Children on board so they put in at  Fort St George  and desiring the Go∣vernours Protection had leave to anchor in the Road and to send their Goods and useless People  ashore There were then in the Road a few small  English  Ships and Capt  Heath  whose Ship was a very stout Merchant man and which the  French  Relater calls the  English  Admiral was just come from  China  but very deep laden with Goods and the Deck full of Canisters of Sugar which he was preparing to send ashore But before he could do it the  French  appeared coming into the Road with their lower Sails and top Sails and had with them a Fireship With this they thought to have burnt the  DutchCommodore  and might probably enough have done it as she lay at Anchor if they had had the courage to have come boldly on but they fired their Ship at a distance and the  Dutch  sent and towed her away where she spent her self without any execution Had the  French  Men of War also come boldly up and grappled with their Enemies they might have done something considerable for the Fort could not have played on them without damaging our Ships as well as theirs But instead of this the  French  dropt An∣chor out of reach of the shot of the Fort and there lay exchanging shot with their Enemies Ships with so little advantage to themselves that after about four hours fighting they cut their Cables and went away in haste and disorder with all their Sails loose even their Top gallant Sails which is not usual but when Ships are just next to running away  Captain  Heath  notwithstanding his Ship was so heavy and incumbred behaved himself very brave∣ly in the sight and upon the going off of the  French  went aboard the  Dutch  Commodore and told him that if he would pursue them he wou'd stand out with them to Sea though he had very little Water aboard but the  Dutch  Commander excused himself saying he had orders to defend himself from the  French  but none to chase them  or go out of his way to seek them And this was the Exploit which the  French  have thought fit to brag of I hear that the  Dutch  have taken from them since their Fort of  Ponticheri  But to proceed with our Voyage We had not been at Sea long before our men began to droop in a sort of a Distemper that stole insensibly on them and proved fatal to above thirty who died before we arrived at the Cape We had some∣times two and once three men thrown over board in a morning This Distemper might probably arise from the badness of the Water which we took in at  Bencouli  For I did observe while I was there that the River water wherewith our Ships were watered was very unwholesome it being mixt with the Water of many small Creeks that proceeded from low Land and whose Streams were always very black they being nourished by the Water that drained out of the low swampy un∣wholesome Ground  I have observed not only there but in other hot Countries also both in the  East  and  West Indies  that the Landfloods which pour into the Channels of the Rivers about the season of the Rains are very unwholsome For when I lived in the Bay of  Campeachy  the Fish were found dead in heaps on the shores of the Rivers and Creeks at such a season and many we took up half dead of which sudden mortality there appeared no cause but only the malignity of the Waters draining off the Land This happens chiefly as I take it where the Wa∣ter drains through thick Woods and Savannahs of long Grass and swampy Grounds with which some hot Countries abound And I believe it re∣ceives a strong Tincture from the Roots of several kind of Trees Herbs  c  and especially where there is any stagnancy of the Water it soon cor∣rupts and possibly the Serpents and other poison∣ous  Vermin and Insects may not a little contribute to its bad Qualities at such times it will look very deep coloured yellow red or black  c  The season of the Rains was over and the Landfloods were abating upon the taking up this Water in the River of  Bencouli  but would the Seamen have given themselves the trouble they might have fill'd their Vessels with excellent good Water at a Spring on the backside of the Fort not above or paces from the Landing place and with which the Fort is served And I mention this as a caution to any Ships that shall go to  Bencouli  for the future and withal I think it worth the care of the Owners or Governours of the Factory and that it would tend much to the preservation of their Seamen's lives to lay Pipes to convey the Fountain Water to the Shore which might easily be done with a small charge and had I staid longer there I would have undertaken it I had a design also of bringing it into the Fort tho much higher for it would be a great convenience and security to it in case of a Siege  Besides the badness of our Water it was stowed among the Pepper in the Hold which made it very hot Every Morning when we came to take our Allowance it was so hot that a man could hardly suffer his hands in it or hold a Bottle full of it in his hand I never any where felt the like nor could have thought it possible that Water should heat to that degree in a Ships Hold It was ex∣ceeding black too and looked more like Ink than Water Whether it grew so black with standing or was tinged with the Pepper I know not for this Water was not so black when it was first taken up Our Food also was very bad for the Ship had been out of  England  upon this Voyage above three Years and the salt Provision brought from thence and which we fed on having been so long  in Salt was but ordinary Food for sickly Men to Feed on  Captain  Heath  when he saw the misery of his Company ordered his own Tamarinds of which he had some Jars aboard to be given some to each Mess to eat with their Rice This was a great refreshment to the men and I do believe it contri∣buted much to keep us on our Legs  This Distemper was so universal that I do be∣lieve there was scarce a man in the Ship but lan∣guished under it yet it stole so insensibly on us that we could not say we were sick feeling little or no pain only a Weakness and but little Stomach Nay most of those that died in this Voyage would hardly be perswaded to keep their Cabbins or Hammocks till they could not stir about and when they were forced to lye down they made their Wills and piked off in two or three days  The loss of these men and the weak languish∣ing condition that the rest of us were in rendered us uncapable to govern our Ship when the Wind blew more than ordinary This often happened when we drew near the Cape and as oft put us to our trumps to manage the Ship Captain  Health  to encourage his men to their labour kept his Watch as constantly as any man tho' sickly himself and lent an helping hand on all occasions But at last almost despairing of gaining his Passage to the Cape by reason of the Winds coming Southerly and we having now been sailing or weeks he called all our men to consult about our safety and desired every man from the highest to the lowest freely to give his real Opinion and Advice what to do in this dangerous juncture for we were not in a condition to keep out long and could we not get to Land quickly must have pe∣rished at Sea He consulted therefore whether it were best to beat for the Cape or bear away  for  Johanna  where we might expect relief that being a place where our outward bound  East In∣dia  Ships usually touch and whose Natives are very familiar but other places especially  St Laa∣rence  or  Madagascar  which was nearer was un∣known to us We were now so nigh the Cape that with a fair Wind we might expect to be there in or days but as the Wind was now we could not hope to get thither On the other side this Wind was fair to carry us to  Johanna  but then  Johanna  was a great way off and if the Wind should continue as it was to bring us into a true Trade Wind yet we could not get thither under a fortnight and if we should meet calms as we might probably expect it might be much longer Besides we should lose our passage about the Cape till  October  or  November  this being about the latter end of  March  for after the th of  May  'tis not usual to beat about the Cape to come home All circumstances therefore being weighed and considered we at last unanimously agreed to pro∣secute our Voyage towards the Cape and with pa∣tience wait for a shift of Wind  But Captain  Heath  having thus far sounded the inclination of his weak men told them that it was not enough that they all consented to beat for the Cape for our desires were not sufficient to bring us thither but that there would need a more than ordinary labour and management from those that were able And withal for their en∣couragement he promised a months pay  Gratis  to every man that would engage to assist on all oc∣casions and be ready upon call whether it were his turn to watch or not and this Money he promised to pay at the Cape This offer was first embraced by some of the Officers and then as many of the Men as found themselves in a capacity listed themselves in a Roll to serve their Commander  This was wisely contrived of the Captain for he could not have compell'd them in their weak condition neither would fair Words alone with∣out some hopes of a reward have engaged them to so much extraordinary Work for the Ship Sail and Rigging were much out of repair For my part I was too weak to enter my self into that List for else our common safety which I plainly saw lay at stake would have prompted me to do more than any such reward would do In a short time after this it pleased God to favour us with a fine Wind which being improved to the best advan∣tage by the incessant labour of these new listed men brought us in a short time to the Cape  The night before we entred the Harbour which was about the beginning of  April  being near the Land we fired a Gun every hour to give notice that we were in distress The next day a  Dutch  Captain came aboard in his Boat who seeing us so weak as not to be able to trim our Sails to turn into the Harbour tho we did tolerably well at Sea before the Wind and being requested by our Captain to assist him sent ashore for a hundred lusty men who immediately came aboard and brought our Ship in to an Anchor They also un∣bent our Sails and did every thing for us that they were required to do for which Capt  Heath  gra∣tified them to the full  These men had better stomachs than we and eat freely of such Food as the Ship afforded and they having the freedom of our Ship to go to and fro between Decks made prize of what they could lay their hands on especially Salt Beef which our men for want of stomachs in the Voyage had hung up or pieces in a place This was conveyed away before we knew it or thought of it besides in the night there was a Bale of Muz∣lins broke open and a great deal conveyed away  but whether the Muzlins were stolen by our own men or the  Dutch  I cannot say for we had some very dexterous Thieves in our Ship  Being thus got safe to an Anchor the Sick were presently sent ashore to Quarters provided for them and those that were able remained aboard and had good fat Mutton or fresh Beef sent a∣board every day I went ashore also with my Painted Prince where I remained with him till the time of sailing again which was about six Weeks In which time I took the opportunity to inform my self what I could concerning this Country which I shall in the next place give you a brief account of and so make what haste I can home  The Cape of  Good Hope  is the utmost Bounds of the Continent of  Africa  towards the South lying in d m S lat in a very temperate Climate I look upon this Latitude to be one of the mildest and sweetest for its temperature of any whatsoever and I cannot here but take notice of a common prejudice our  European  Seamen have as to this Country that they look upon it as much colder than Places in the same Latitude to the North of the Line I am not of their opinion as to that and their thinking so I believe may easily be ac∣counted for from hence that whatever way they come to the Cape whether going to the  East Indies  or returning back they pass thro a hot Climate and coming to it thus out of an extremity of heat 'tis no wonder if it appear the colder to them Some impute the coldness of the South Wind here to its blowing off from Sea On the contrary I have always observed the Sea Winds to be warmer than Land Winds unless it be when a bloom as we call it or hot blast blow from thence Such an one we felt in this very Voyage as we went from Cape  Verd  Islands towards the  South Seas  which I forgot to mention in its proper place Chap th  For one afternoon about the th of  Jan  in the lat of South we felt a brisk Gale coming from off the Coast of  America  but so violent hot that we thought it came from some burning Moun∣tain on the Shore and was like the heat from the mouth of an Oven Just such another Gleam I felt one afternoon also as I lay at Anchor at the  Groin  in  July  it came with a Southerly Wind both these were followed by a Thunder shower These were the only great Blooms I ever met with in my Travels But setting these aside which are exceptions I have made it my general observation that the SeaWinds are a great deal warmer than those which blow from Land unless where the Wind blows from the Poles which I take to be the true cause of the coldness of the South Wind at the Cape for it is cold at Sea also And as for the coldness of LandWinds as the South West parts of  Europe  are very sensible of it from the Northern and Eastern Winds so on the opposite Coast of  Virginia  they are as much pinched with the North West Winds blowing excessively cold from over the Continent tho its Lat be not much greater than this of the Cape  But to proceed This large Promontory consists of high and very remarkable Land and off at Sea it affords a very pleasant and agreeable Pro∣spect And without doubt the Prospect of it was very agreeable to those  Portuguese  who first sound out this way by Sea to the  East Indies  when after coasting along the vast Continent of  Africk  towards the  South Pole  they had the comfort of seeing the Land and their Course end in this Promontory Which therefore they called the Cape  de Bon Espe∣rance  or of  Good Hope  finding that they might now proceed Fastwardly  There is good sounding off this Cape or Leagues at Sea to the Southward and therefore  our  English  Seamen standing over as they usually do from the Coast of  Brazil  content themselves with their Soundings concluding thereby that they are abrest of the Cape they often pass by without seeing it and begin to shape their course Northward They have several other Signs where∣by to know when they are near it as by the SeaFowl they meet at Sea especially the Algatrosses a very large long winged Bird and the Mangovolucres a smaller Fowl But the greatest depen∣dance of our  English  Seamen now is upon their observing the variation of the Compass which is very carefully minded when they come near the Cape by taking the Suns Amplitude mornings and evenings This they are so exact in that by the help of the Azimuth Compass an Instrument more peculiar to the Seamen of our Nation they know when they are abrest of the Cape or are either to the East or West of it And for that reason though they should be to Southward of all the Soundings or fathomable Ground they can shape their course right without being obliged to make the Land But the  Dutch  on the contrary having settled themselves on this Promontory do always touch here in their  EastIndia  Voyages both going and coming  The most remarkable Land at Sea is a high Mountain steep to the Sea with a flat even top which is called the Table Land On the West side of the Cape a little to the Northward of it there is a spacious Harbour with a low flat Island lying off it which you may leave on either hand and pass in or out securely at either end Ships that anchor here ride near the main Land leaving the Island at a farther distance without them The Land by the Sea against the Harbour is low but backt with high Mountains a little way in to the Southward of it  The Soil of this Country is of a brown colour not deep yet indifferently productive of Grass Herbs and Trees The Grass is short like that which grows on our  Wiltshire  or  Dorsetshire  Downs The Trees hereabouts are but small and few the Country also farther from the Sea does not much abound in Trees as I have been informed The Mould or Soil also is much like this near the Har∣bour which though it cannot be said to be very fat or rich Land yet it is very fit for cultivation and yields good Croops to the industrious Husbandman and the Country is pretty well settled with Farms  Dutch  Families and  French  Refugees for or leagues up the Country but there are but few Farms near the Harbour  Here grows plenty of Wheat Barley Pease  c  Here are also Fruits of many kinds as Apples Pears Quinces and the largest Pomgranates that I did ever see  The chief Fruits are Grapes These thrive very well and the Country is of later Years so well stockt with Vineyards that they make abun∣dance of Wine of which they have enough and to spare and do sell great quantities to Ships that rouch here This Wine is like a  French  High Country Whitewine but of a pale yellowish co∣lour it is sweet very pleasant and strong  The tame Animals of this Country are Sheep Goats Hogs Cows Horses  c  The Sheep are very large and fat for they thrive very well here This being a dry Country and the short Pasturage very agreeable to these Creatures but it is not so proper for great Cattel neither is the Beef in its kind so sweet as the Mutton Of wild Beasts 'tis said here are several sorts but I saw none However it is very likely there are some wild Beasts that prey on the Sheep because they are commonly brought into the Houses in the night and penn'd up  There is a very beautiful sort of wild Ass in this Country whose body is curiously striped with equal Lists of white and black the Stripes coming from the Ridge of his Back and ending under the Belly which is white These Stripes are two or three Fingers broad running parallel with each other and curiously intermixt one white and one black over from the Shoulder to the Rump I saw two of the Skins of these Beasts dried and preserved to be sent to  Holland  as a Rarity They seemed big enough to inclose the Body of a Beast as big as a large Colt of a Twelvemonth old  Here are a great many Ducks Dunghil Fowls  c  and Ostriges are plentifully found in the dry Mountains and Plains I eat of their Eggs here and those of whom I bought them told me that these Creatures lay their Eggs in the Sand or at least on dry Ground and so leave them to be hatch'd by the Sun The Meat of one of their Eggs will suffice two Men very well The Inha∣bitants do preserve the Eggs that they find to sell to Strangers They were pretty scarce when I was here it being the beginning of their Winter whereas I was told they lay their Eggs about  Christ∣mas  which is their Summer  The Sea hereabouts affords plenty of Fish of di∣vers sorts especially a small sort of Fish not so big as a Herring whereof they have such great plenty that they Pickle great Quantities yearly and send them to  Europe  Seals are also in great numbers about the Cape which as I have still observed is a good sign of the plentifulness of Fish which is their Food  The  Dutch  have a strong Fort by the Sea side against the Harbour where the Governour lives At about or Paces distance from thence on the West side of the Fort there is a small  Dutch  Town in which I told about or Houses  low but well built with Stonewalls there be∣ing plenty of Stone drawn out of a Quarry close by  On the backside of the Town as you go to∣wards the Mountains the  Dutch East India  Com∣pany have a large House and a stately Garden walled in with a high Stonewall  This Garden is full of divers sorts of Herbs Flowers Roots and Fruits with curious spacious Gravelwalks and Arbors and is watered with a Brook that descends out of the Mountains which being cut into many Channels is conveyed into all parts of the Garden The Hedges which make the Walks are very thick and or foot high They are kept exceeding neat and even by continual pruning There are lower Hedges within these again which serve to separate the Fruittrees from each other but without shading them and they keep each sort of Fruit by them∣selves as Apples Pears abundance of Quinces Pomgranats  c  These all prosper very well and bear good Fruit especially the Pomgranat The Roots and GardenHerbs have also their di∣stinct places hedged in apart by themselves and all in such order that it is exceeding pleasant and beautiful There are a great number of Negro Slaves brought from other parts of the World some of which are continually weeding pruning trimming and looking after it All Strangers are allowed the liberty to walk there and by the Servants leave you may be admitted to taste of the Fruit but if you think to do it clandestinly you may be mistaken as I knew one was when I was in the Garden who took or Pomgranats and was espy'd by one of the Slaves and threat∣ned to be carry'd before the Governour I believe it cost him some Money to make his peace for I heard no more of it Further up from the Sea  beyond the Garden towards the Mountains there are several other small Gardens and Vineyards belonging to private Men but the Mountains are so nigh that the number of them are but small  The  Dutch  that live in the Town get considera∣bly by the Ships that frequently touch here chiefly by entertaining Strangers that come ashoar to re∣fresh themselves for you must give  s  or a Dollar a day for your Entertainment the Bread and Flesh is as cheap here as in  England  besides they buy good pennyworths of the Seamen both outward and homeward bound which the Farmers up the Country buy of them again at a dear rate for they have not an opportunity of buying things at the best hand but must buy of those that live at the Harbour the nearest Settlements as I was in∣formed being miles off  Notwithstanding the great plenty of Corn and Wine yet the extraordinary high Taxes which the Company lays on Liquor makes it very dear and you can buy none but at the Tavern except it be by stealth There are but Houses in the Town that sell strong Liquor one of which is this WineHouse or Tavern there they sell only Wine another sells Beer and Mum and the third sells Brandy and Tobacco all extraordinary dear A Flask of Wine which holds quarts will cost Sti∣vers for so much I paid for it yet I bought as much for Stivers in another place but it was privately at an unlicenced House and the person that sold it would have been ruined had it been known and thus much for the Country and the  European  Inhabitants  CHAP XX  Of the natural Inhabitants of the Cape of  Good Hope  the  Hodmodods  or  Hottantots  Their Personage Garb besmearing them∣selves their Cloathing Houses Food way of Living and Dancing at the Full of the Moon Compared in those respects with other  Negroes  and Wild  Indians  Captain  Heath  refreshes his Men at the Cape and getting some more Hands departs in compa∣ny with the  James and Mary  and the  Josiah  A great swelling Sea from S W They arrive at  Santa Hellena  and there meet with the  Princess Ann  homeward bound The Air Situation and Soil of that Island Its first discovery and change of Masters since How the  English  got it Its Strength Town Inhabitants and the product of their Plantations The  Santa Hellena Manatee  no other than the Sea Lion Of the  English  Women at this Isle The  English  Ships re∣fresh their Men here and depart all toge∣ther Of the different Courses from hence to  England  Their Course and arrival in the  English  Channel and the  Downs  THe Natural Inhabitants of the Cape are the  Hodmodods  as they are commonly called which is a corruption of the Word  Hottantot  for this is the Name by which they call to one ano∣ther either in their Dances or on any occasion  as if every one of them had this for his Name The Word probably hath some signification or other in their Language whatever it is  These  Hottantots  are People of a middle Stature with small Limbs and thin Bodies full of activity Their Faces are of a flat oval Figure of the  Negro  make with great Eyebrows black Eyes but neither are their Noses so flat nor their Lips so thick as the  Negroes  of  Guinea  Their Complexion is darker than the common  Indians  tho' not so black as the  Negroes  or  New Hollanders  neither is their Hair so much frizled  They besmear themselves all over with Grease as well to keep their Joints supple as to fence their half naked Bodies from the Air by stopping up their Pores To do this the more effectually they rub Soot over the greased parts especially their Faces which adds to their natural Beauty as Painting does in  Europe  but withal sends from them a strong Smell which though sufficiently pleasing to themselves is very unpleasant to others They are glad of the worst of Kitchinstuff for this purpose and use it as often as they can get it  This Custom of anointing the Body is very common in other parts of  Africa  especially on the Coast of  Guinea  where they generally use PalmOil anointing themselves from Head to Foot but when they want Oil they make use of Kitchinstuff which they buy of the  Europeans  that Trade with them In the  East Indies  also especially on the Coast of  Cudda  and  Malacca  and in general on almost all the Easterly Islands as well on  Sumatra Java c  as on the  Philippine  and Spice Islands the  Indian  Inhabitants anoint themselves with Coconut Oil two or three times a day especially Mornings and Evenings They spend sometimes half an hour in chasing  the Oil and rubbing it into their Hair and Skin leaving no place unsmear'd with Oil but their Face which they daub not like these  Hottantots  The  Americans  also in some places do use this Cu∣stom but not so frequently perhaps for want of Oil and Grease to do it Yet some  AmericanIndians  in the North Seas frequently daub themselves with a Pigment made with Leaves Roots or Herbs or with a sort of red Earth giving their skins a yel∣low red or green colour according as the Pig∣ment is And these smell unsavourly enough to People not accustomed to them tho not so rank as those who use Oil or Grease  The  Hottantots  do wear no covering on their Heads but deck their Hair with small shells Their Garments are Sheepskins wrapt about their Shoulders like a Mantle with the Woolly sides next their Bodies The Men have besides this Mantle a piece of Skin like a small Apron hanging before them The Women have another Skin tucked about their Wastes which comes down to their Knees like a Petticoat and their Legs are wrapt round with Sheepsguts two or three Inches thick some up as high as to their Calves others even from their Feet to their Knees which at a small distance seems to be a sort of Boots These are put on when they are green and so they grow hard and stiff on their Legs for they never pull them off again till they have occasion to eat them which is when they journey from home and have no other Food then these Guts which have been worn it may be six eight ten or twelve months make them a good Banquet This I was informed of by the  Dutch  They never pull off their Sheep skin Garment but to louse themselves for by continual wearing them they are sull of Vermin which obliges them often to strip and sit in  the Sun two or three hours together in the heat of the day to destroy them Indeed most  Indians  that live remote from the Equator are molested with Lice though their Garments afford less shel∣ter for Lice than these  Hottatots  Sheepskins do For all those  Indians  who live in cold Countries as in the North and South parts of  America  have some sort of Skin or other to cover their Bodies as Deer Otter Beaver or Seals Skins all which they as constantly wear without shifting them∣selves as these  Hottantots  do their Sheep skins And hence they are lousy too and strong scented though they do not daub themselves at all or but very little for even by reason of their Skins they smell strong  The  Hottantots  Houses are the meanest that I did ever see They are about or foot high and or from side to side They are in a manner round made with small Poles stuck into the ground and brought together at the top where they are fastened The sides and top of the House are filled up with Boughs coursely wattled between the Poles and all is covered over with long Grass Rushes and pieces of Hides and the House at a distance appears just like a Haycock They leave only a small hole on one side about or foot high for a door to creep in and out at but when the Wind comes in at this door they stop it up and make another hole in the opposite side They make the Fire in the middle of the House and the Smoak ascends out of the Crannies from all parts of the House They have no Beds to lye on but tumble down at night round the sire  Their Houshold Furniture is commonly an earth∣en Pot or two to boil Victuals and they live very miserably and hard 'tis reported that they will last two or three days together when they travel about the Country  Their common Food is either Herbs Flesh or Shellfish which they get among the Rocks or other places at low Water for they have no Boats Barklogs nor Canoas to go a Fishing in so that their chiefest subsistence is on Land Animals or on such Herbs as the Land na∣turally produceth I was told by my  Dutch  Land∣lord that they kept Sheep and Bullocks here be∣fore the  Dutch  settled among them and that the Inland  Hottantots  have still great stocks of Cattle and sell them to the  Dutch  for Rolls of Tobacco and that the price for which they sell a Cow or Sheep was as much twisted Tobacco as will reach from the Horns or Head to the Tayl for they are great lovers of Tobacco and will do any thing for it This their way of trucking was confirmed to me by many others who yet said that they could not buy their Beef this cheap way for they had not the liberty to deal with the  Hot∣tantots  that being a priviledge which the  Dutch East India  Company reserve to themselves My Landlord having a great many Lodgers fed us most with Mutton some of which he bought of the Butcher and there is but one in the Town but most of it he killed in the Night the Sheep being brought privately by the  Hottantots  who assisted in the Skinning and Dressing and had the Skin and Guts for their pains I judged these Sheep were fetched out of the country a good way off for he himself would be absent a day or two to procure them and two or three  Hottantots  with him These of the  Hottantots  that live by the  Dutch  Town have their greatest subsistance from the  Dutch  for there is one or more of them be∣longing to every House These do all sorts of servile work and there take their Food and Grease Three or four more of their nearest Relations sit at the Doors or near the  Dutch  House waiting  for the scraps and fragments that come from the Table and if between meals the  Dutch  people have any occasion for them to go on Errands or the like they are ready at command expecting little for their pains but for a Stranger they will not budge under a Stiver  Their Religion if they have any is wholly unknown to me for they have no Temple nor Idol nor any place of Worship that I did see or hear of yet their mirth and nocturnal pastimes at the New and Full of the Moon lookt as if they had some Superstition about it For at the Full especially they sing and dance all Night making a great noise I walked out to their Huts twice at these times in the Evening when the Moon arose above the Horizon and viewed them for an hour or more They seem all very busie both Men Women and Children dancing very oddly on the green Grass by their Houses They traced two and fro promiscuously often clapping their hands and singing aloud Their Faces were sometimes to the East sometimes to the West neither did I see any motion or gesture that they used when their Faces were toward the Moon more than when their backs were toward it Af∣ter I had thus observed them for a while I return∣ed to my Lodging which was not above or paces from their Huts and I heard them singing in the same manner all Night In the grey of the Morning I walk'd out again and found many of the Men and Women still Singing and Dancing who continued their Mirth till the Moon went down and then they left off Some of them going into their Huts to sleep and others to their attendance in their  Dutch  Houses Other Negroes are less circumspect in their NightDances as to the precise time of the Full Moon they being more general in these Nocturnal Pa∣stimes  and use them oftner as do many people also in the  East  and  West Indies  yet there is a dif∣ference between colder and warmer Countries as to their Devertisements The warmer Climates being generally very productive of delicate Fruits  c  and these unciviliz'd people caring for little else than what is barely necessary they spend the greatest part of their time in diverting themselves after their several fashions but the  Indians  of colder Climates are not so much at leisure the Fruits of the Earth being scarce with them and they necessiated to be continually Fishing Hunting or Fowling for their subsistance not as with us for Recreation  As for these  Hottantots  they are a very lazy sort of People and tho they live in a delicate Country very fit to be manured and where there is Land enough for them yet they choose rather to live as their Forefathers poor and miserable than be at pains for plenty And so much for the  Hottantots  I shall now return to our own af∣fairs  Upon our arrival at the Cape Captain  Heath  took an House to live in in order to recover his Health Such of his men as were able did so too for the rest he provided Lodgings and paid their Expences Three or four of our men who came ashore very sick died but the rest by the assist∣ance of the Doctors of the Fort a fine Air and good Kitchin and Cellar Physick soon recovered their Healths Those that subscribed to be at all calls and assisted to bring in the Ship received Cap∣tain  Heath  's Bounty by which they furnished themselves with Liquor for their homeward Voyage But we were now so few that we could not sail the Ship therefore Captain  Heath  desired the Governour to spare him some Men and as I was informed had a promise to be  supplied out of the homeward bound  Dutch East India  Ships that were now expected every day and we waiied for them In the mean time in came the  James and Mary  and the  Josiah of London  bound home Out of those we thought to have been furnished with men but they had only e∣nough for themselves therefore we waited yet longer for the  Dutch  Fleet which at last arrived but we could get no men from them  Captain  Heath  was therefore forced to get Men by stealth such as he could pick up whether Sol∣diers or Seamen The  Dutch  knew our want of Men therefore near of them those that had a design to return to  Europe  came privately and offered themselves and waited in the night at places appointed where our Boats went and fetched or aboard at a time and hid them especially when any  Dutch  Boat came aboard our Ship Here at the Cape I met my Friend  Daniel Wallis  the same who leapt into the Sea and swam at  Pulo Con∣dore  After several Traverses to  Madagascar Don Mascarin Ponticherri Pegu Cunnimere Maderas  and the River of  Hugli  he was now got hither in a homeward bound  Dutch  Ship I soon persuaded him to come over to us and found means to get him aboard our Ship  About the d of  May  we sailed from the Cape in the Company of the  James and Mary  and the  Jasiah  directing our course towards the Island  Santa Hellena  We met nothing of remark in this Voyage except a great swelling Sea out of the S W which taking us on the broad side made us roll sufficiently Such of our Watercasks as were between Decks running from side to side were in a short time all staved and the Deck well washed with the fresh Water The Shot tumbled out the Lockers and Garlands and rung a loud Peal rumbling from side to side every  wl that  the Ship made neither was it an easie matter to reduce them again within bounds The Guns be∣ing carefully look'd after and lash'd fast never budg'd but the Tackles or Pulleys and Lashings made great Musick too The sudden and violent motion of the Ship made us fearful last some of the Guns should have broken loose which must have been very detrimental to the Ship's sides The Masts were also in great danger to be rowl'd by the board but no harm happen'd to any of us besides the loss of or Butts of Water and a Barrel or two of good Cape Wine which was stav'd in the great Cabbin  This great tumbling Sea took us shortly after we came from the Cape The violence of it lasted but one night yet we had a continual swel∣ling came out of the S W almost during all the passage to  Santa Hellena  which was an eminent token that the S W Winds were now violent in the higher Latitudes towards the South Pole for this was the time of the Year for those Winds Notwithstanding this boisterous Sea coming thus obliquely upon us we had fine clear Weather and a moderate Gale at S E or between that and the East till we came to the Island  Santa Hellena  where we arrived the th day of  June  There we found the  Princess Ann  at an Anchor waiting for us  The Island  Santa Hellena  lies in about De∣grees South Lat The Air is commonly serene and clear except in the Months that yield Rain yet we had one or two very rainy days even while we were here Here are moist Seasons to Plant and Sow and the Weather is temperate enough as to Heat tho so near the Equator and very heal∣thy  The Island is but small not above nine or ten Leagues in length and stands or Leagues  from the main Land It is bounded against the Sea with steep Rocks so that there is no landing but at two or three places The Land is high and Mountainous and seems to be very dry and poor yet they are fine Valleys proper for cultivation The Mountains appear bare only in some places you may see a few low Shrubs but the Valleys afford some Trees fit for building as I was in∣formed  This Island is said to have been first discovered and settled by the  Portuguese  who stockt it with Goats and Hogs But it being afterwards de∣serted by them it lay waste till the  Dutch  find∣ing it convenient to relieve their  East India  Ships settled it again but they afterwards relinquished it for a more convenient place I mean the Cape of  Good Hope  Then the  English East India  Com∣pany settled their Servants there and began to for∣tify it but they being yet weak the  Dutch  about the year came thither and retook it and keep it in their possession This News being re∣ported in  England  Captain  Monday  was sent to retake it who by the advice and conduct of one that had formerly lived there landed a party of Armed Men in the night in a small Cove un∣known to the  Dutch  then in Garrison and climb∣ing the Rocks got up into the Island and so came in the morning to the Hills hanging over the Fort which stands by the Sea in a small Val∣ley From thence firing into the Fort they soon made them surrender There were at this time two or three  Dutch East India  Ships either at An∣chor or coming thither when our Ships were there These when they saw that the  English  were Masters of the Island again made sail to be gone but being chaced by the  English  Frigots of them became rich Prizes to Capt  Monday  and his men  The Island hath continued ever since in the hands of the  English East India  Company and hath been greatly strengthned both with Men and Guns so that at this day it is secure enough from the Invasion of an Enemy For the common Landing place is a small Bay like a Half Moon scarce paces wide between the two Points Close by the Seaside are good Guns planted at equal distances lying along from one end of the Bay to the other besides a small Fort a little fur∣ther in from the Sea near the midst of the Bay All which makes the Bay so strong that it is im∣possible to force it The small Cove where Capt  Monday  landed his Men when he took the Island from the  Dutch  is scarce fit for a Boat to land at and yet that is now also fortified  There is a small  English  Town within the great Bay standing in a little Valley between two high steep Mountains There may be about or small Houses whose Walls are built with rough Stones The inside Furniture is very mean The Governour has a pretty tolerable handsome low House by the Fort where he commonly lives having a few Soldiers to attend him and to guard the Fort But the Houses in the Town before mentioned stand empty save only when Ships arrive here here for their Owners have all Plantations farther in the Island where they con∣stantly employ themselves But when Ships ar∣rive they all flock to the Town where they live all the time that the Ships lie here for then is their Fair or Market to buy such Necessaries as they want and to sell off the Produce of their Plan∣tations  Their Plantations afford Potatoes Yams and some Plantains and Bonanoes Their Stock con∣sists chiefly of Hogs Bullocks Cocks and Hens Ducks Geese and Turkeys of which they have  great plenty and fell them at a low rate to the Sailers taking in exchange Shirts Drawers or any light Cloaths pieces of Callico Silks or Muzlins Arack Sugar and Lime juice is also much esteemed and coveted by them But now they are in hopes to produce Wine and Brandy in a short time for they do already begin to plant Vines for that end there being a few  French  men that are to manage that affair This I was told but I saw nothing of it for it rained so hard when I was ashoar that I had not the opportunity of seeing their Plantations I was also informed that they get Manatee or SeaCows here which seemed very strange to me Therefore enquiring more strictly into the matter I found the  Santa Hellena  Manatee to be by their shapes and manner of lying ashoar on the Rocks those Crea∣tures called SeaLyons for the Manatee never come ashoar neither are they feund near any rocky shores as this Island is there being no feed∣ing for them in such places Besides in this Island there is no River for them to drink at tho there is a small Brook runs into the Sea out of the Valley by the Fort  We stayed here or days all which time the Islanders lived at the Town to entertain the Seamen who constantly flock ashore to enjoy themselves among their Country people Our touching at the Cape had greatly drained the Seamen of their loose Corns at which these Islanders as greatly repined and some of the poorer sort openly complained against such doings saying it was fit that the  East India  Company should be acquainted with it that they might hinder their Ships from touching at the Cape Yet they were extreamly kind in hopes to get what was remaining They are most of them very poor but such as could get a little Liquor to sell  to the Seamen at this time got what the Seamen could spare for the Punchhouses were never empty But had we all come directly hither and not touched at the Cape even the poorest people among them would have gotten something by entertaining sick men For commonly the Seamen coming home are troubled more or less with Scorbutick Distempers and their only hopes are to get refreshment and health at this Island and th  se hopes seldom or never fail them if once they get footing here For the Islands afford  bundance of delicate Herbs wherewith the sick  re first bathed to supple their Joints and then the  ruits and Herbs and fresh food soon after cure them of their Scorbutick Humour So that in a weeks time men that have been carried ashore in Hammocks and they who were wholly unable to go have soon been able to leap and dance Doubtless the serenity and wholesomness of the Air contri∣butes much to the carrying off of these Distem∣pers for here is constantly a fresh breze While we stayed here many of the Seamen got Sweethearts One young man belonging to the  James and Mary  was married and brought his Wife to  England  with him Another brought his Sweetheart to  England  they being each engaged by Bonds to marry at their arrival in  England  and several other of our men were over Head and Ears in love with the  Santa Hellena  Maids who tho they were born there yet very earnestly de∣sired to be released from that Prison which they have no other way to compass but by marrying Seamen or Passengers that touch here The young Women born here are but one remove from  English  being the Daughters of such They are well shaped proper and comely were they in a dress to set them off  My stay ashore here was but two days to get refreshments for my self and  Jcoly  whom I car∣ryed ashore with me and he was very diligent to pick up such things as the Islands afforded carry∣ing ashore with him a Bag which the People of the Isle filled with Roots for him They flockt about him and seemed to admire him much This was the last place where I had him at my own disposal for the Mate of the Ship who had Mr  Moodie  's share in him left him entirely to my ma∣nagement I being to bring him to  England  But I was no sooner arrived in the  Thames  but he was sent ashore to be seen by some eminent persons and I being in want of Money was prevailed upon to sell first part of my share in him and by degrees all of it After this I heard he was carry∣ed about to be shown as a Sight and that he died of the small Pox at  Oxsord  But to proceed our Water being filled and the Ship all stockt with fresh Provision we sailed from hence in Company of the  Princess Ann  the  James and Mary  and the  Josiah July  the d directing our course towards  England  and design∣ing to touch no where by the way We were now in the way of the Trade Winds which we commonly find at E S E or S E by E or  S  E till we draw near the Line and sometimes till we are or degrees to the North of the Line For which reason Ships might shape their course so as to keep on the  Asrican  shore and pass between Cape  Verd  and Cape  Verd  Islands for that seems to be the dirctest course to  England  But expe∣rience often shews us that the sarthest way about is the nearest way home and so it is here For by striving to keep near the  Asrican  shore you meet with the Winds more uncertain and subject to calms whereas in keeping the mid way be∣tween  Asrica  and  America  or rather nearer the  American  Continent till you are North of the Line you have a brisk constant gale  This was the way that we took and in our pas∣sage before we got to the Line we saw three Ships and making towards them we found two of them to be  Portugueze  bound to  Brazil  The third kept on a Wind so that we could not speak with her but we found by the  Portugueze  it was an  English  Ship called the  Dorothy  Capt  Thwart  Commander bound to the  East Indies  After this we kept Company still with our Consorts till we came near  England  and then were separated by bad weather but before we came within sight of Land we got together again all but the  James and Mary  She got into the Channel be∣fore us and went to  Plymouth  and there gave an account of the rest of us whereupon our Men of War who l  y there came out to joyn us and meeting us brought us off of  Plymouth  There our Consort the  James and Mary  came to us again and from thence we all sailed in company of seve∣ral Men of War towards  Portsmouth  There our first Convoy left us and went in thither But we did not want Convoys for our Fleets were then re∣pairing to their Winter Harbours to be laid up so that we had the company of several  English  Ships to the  Downs  and a Squadron also of  Dutch  sailed up the Channel but kept off farther from our  English  Coast they being bound home to  Holland  When we came as high as the  South Foreland  we left them standing on their course keeping on the back of the  Goodwin Sands  and we lufft in for the  Downs  where we anchored  September  the th  BOOKS Printed for  J Knapton  at the  Crown  in St  Paul  's ChurchYard  VOyages and Descriptions  Vol II In three parts  viz  A  Supplement  of the  Voyage round the
