 THE  RAPE  of the  LOCK  AN HEROICOMICAL POEM In FIVE CANTO'S  Written by Mr  POPE    A tonso est hoc nomen adepta capillo  OVID  LONDON Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT at the  CrossKeys  in  Fleetstreet    TO Mrs  ARABELLA FERMOR    MADAM  _IT will be in vain to deny that I have some Value for this Piece since I Dedicate it to You Yet You may bear me Witness it was intended only to divert a few young  Ladies who have good Sense and good Humour enough to laugh not only at their Sex's little unguarded Follies but at their own But as it was communicated with the Air of a Secret it soon found its Way into the World An imperfect Copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller You had the GoodNature for my Sake to consent to the Publication of one more correct This I was forc'd to before I had executed half my Design for the  Machinery  was entirely wanting to compleat it  The  Machinery  Madam is a Term invented by the Criticks to signify that Part which the Deities Angels or Daemons are made to act in a Poem For the ancient Poets are in one respect like  many modern Ladies Let an Action be never so trivial in it self they always make it appear of the utmost Importance These Machines I determin'd to raise on a very new and odd Foundation the  Rosicrucian  Doctrine of Spirits  I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard Words before a Lady but 'tis so much the Concern of a Poet to have his Works understood and particularly by your Sex that You must give me leave to explain two or three difficult Terms  The  Rosicrucians  are a People I must bring You acquainted with The best Account I know of them is in a French Book call'd  Le Comte de Gabalis  which  both in its Title and Size is so like a  Novel  that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by Mistake According to these Gentlemen the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits which they call  Sylphs Gnomes Nymphs  and  Salamanders  The  Gnomes  or Daemons of Earth delight in Mischief but the  Sylphs  whose Habitation is Air are the bestcondition'd Creatures imaginable For they say any Mortals may enjoy the most intimate Familiarities with these gentle Spirits upon a Condition very easie to all true  Adepts  an inviolate Preservation of Chastity  As to the following Canto's all the Passages of them are as Fabulous as the Vision at the Beginning or the Transformation at the End except the Loss of  your Hair which I always name with Reverence The Human Persons are as Fictitious as the Airy ones and the Character of  Belinda  as it is now manag'd resembles You in nothing but in Beauty  If this Poem had as many Graces as there are in Your Person or in Your Mind yet I could never hope it should pass thro' the World half so Uncensured as You have done But let its Fortune be what it will mine is happy enough to have given me this Occasion of assuring You that I am with the truest Esteem  Madam  Your Most Obedient Humble Servant  A POPE  THE  RAPE  of the  LOCK CANTO  I  _WHAT dire Offence from am'rous Causes springs  What mighty Quarrels rise from trivial Things  I singThis Verse to  Cl  Muse is due  This ev'n  Belinda  may vouchsafe to view  Slight is the Subject but not so the Praise  If She inspire and He approve my Lays  Say what strange Motive Goddess cou'd compel  A wellbred  Lord  t'assault a gentle  Belle  Oh say what stranger Cause yet unexplor'd  Cou'd make a gentle  Belle  reject a  Lord    And dwells such Rage in softest Bosoms then  And lodge such daring Souls in Little Men  Sol  thro' white Curtains did his Beams display  And op'd those Eyes which brighter shine than they  Now  Shock  had giv'n himself the rowzing Shake  And Nymphs prepar'd their  Chocolate  to take  Thrice the wrought Slipper knock'd against the Ground  And striking Watches the tenth Hour resound  Belinda  still her downy Pillow prest  Her Guardian  Sylph  prolong'd the balmy Rest  'Twas he had summon'd to her silent Bed  The Morning Dream that hover'd o'er her Head  A Youth more glitt'ring than a  Birthnight Beau    That ev'n in Slumber caus'd her Cheek to glow  Seem'd to her Ear his winning Lips to lay  And thus in Whispers said or seem'd to say  Fairest of Mortals thou distinguish'd Care  Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air  If e'er one Vision touch'd thy infant Thought  Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught  Of airy Elves by Moonlight Shadows seen  The silver Token and the circled Green  Or Virgins visited by AngelPow'rs  With Golden Crowns and Wreaths of heav'nly Flow'rs  Hear and believe thy own Importance know  Nor bound thy narrow Views to Things below  Some secret Truths from Learned Pride conceal'd  To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd  What tho' no Credit doubting Wits may give  The Fair and Innocent shall still believe  Know then unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly  The light  Militia  of the lower Sky  These tho' unseen are ever on the Wing  Hang o'er the  Box  and hover round the  Ring    Think what an Equipage thou hast in Air  And view with scorn  Two Pages  and a  Chair    As now your own our Beings were of old  And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous Mold  Thence by a soft Transition we repair  From earthly Vehicles to these of Air  Think not when Woman's transient Breath is fled  That all her Vanities at once are dead  Succeeding Vanities she still regards  And tho' she plays no more o'erlooks the Cards  Her Joy in gilded Chariots when alive  And Love of  Ombre  after Death survive  For when the Fair in all their Pride expire  To their first Elements the Souls retire  The Sprights of fiery Termagants in Flame  Mount up and take a  Salamander  's Name  Soft yielding Minds to Water glide away  And sip with  Nymphs  their Elemental Tea  The graver Prude sinks downward to a  Gnome    In search of Mischief still on Earth to roam  The light Coquettes in  Sylphs  aloft repair  And sport and flutter in the Fields of Air  Know farther yet Whoever fair and chaste  Rejects Mankind is by some  Sylph  embrac'd  For Spirits freed from mortal Laws with ease  Assume what Sexes and what Shapes they please  What guards the Purity of melting Maids  In Courtly Balls and Midnight Masquerades  Safe from the treach'rous Friend and daring Spark  The Glance by Day the Whisper in the Dark  When kind Occasion prompts their warm Desires  When Musick softens and when Dancing fires  'Tis but their  Sylph  the wise Celestials know  Tho'  Honour  is the Word with Men below  Some Nymphs there are too conscious of their Face  For Life predestin'd to the  Gnomes  Embrace  Who swell their Prospects and exalt their Pride  When Offers are disdain'd and Love deny'd  Then gay Ideas crowd the vacant Brain  While Peers and Dukes and all their sweeping Train  And Garters Stars and Coronets appear  And in soft Sounds  Your Grace  salutes their Ear  'Tis these that early taint the Female Soul  Instruct the Eyes of young  Coquettes  to roll  Teach Infants Cheeks a bidden Blush to know  And little Hearts to flutter at a  Beau    Oft when the World imagine Women stray  The  Sylphs  thro' mystick Mazes guide their Way  Thro' all the giddy Circle they pursue  And old Impertinence expel by new  What tender Maid but must a Victim fall  To one Man's Treat but for another's Ball  When  Florio  speaks what Virgin could withstand  If gentle  Damon  did not squeeze her Hand  With varying Vanities from ev'ry Part  They shift the moving Toyshop of their Heart  Where Wigs with Wigs with Swordknots Swordknots strive  Beaus banish Beaus and Coaches Coaches drive  This erring Mortals Levity may call  Oh blind to Truth the  Sylphs  contrive it all  Of these am I who thy Protection claim  A watchful Sprite and  Ariel  is my Name  Late as I rang'd the Crystal Wilds of Air  In the clear Mirror of thy ruling  Star  I saw alas some dread Event impend  E're to the Main this Morning's Sun descend  But Heav'n reveals not what or how or where  Warn'd by thy  Sylph  oh Pious Maid beware  This to disclose is all thy Guardian can  Beware of all but most beware of Man  He said when  Shock  who thought she slept too long  Leapt up and wak'd his Mistress with his Tongue  'Twas then  Belinda  if Report say true  Thy Eyes first open'd on a  Billetdoux    Wounds Charms  and  Ardors  were no sooner read  But all the Vision vanish'd from thy Head  And now unveil'd the  Toilet  stands display'd  Each Silver Vase in mystic Order laid  First rob'd in White the Nymph intent adores  With Head uncover'd the  Cosmetic  Pow'rs  A heav'nly Image in the Glass appears  To that she bends to that her Eyes she rears  Th' inferior Priestess at her Altar's side  Trembling begins the sacred Rites of Pride  Unnumber'd Treasures ope at once and here  The various Off'rings of the World appear  From each she nicely culls with curious Toil  And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring Spoil  This Casket  India  's glowing Gems unlocks  And all  Arabia  breaths from yonder Box  The Tortoise here and Elephant unite  Transform'd to  Combs  the speckled and the white  Here Files of Pins extend their shining Rows  Puffs Powders Patches Bibles Billetdoux  Now awful Beauty puts on all its Arms  The Fair each moment rises in her Charms  Repairs her Smiles awakens ev'ry Grace  And calls forth all the Wonders of her Face  Sees by Degrees a purer Blush arise  And keener Lightnings quicken in her Eyes  The busy  Sylphs  surround their darling Care  These set the Head and those divide the Hair  Some fold the Sleeve while others plait the Gown  And  Betty  's prais'd for Labours not her own  THE  RAPE  of the  LOCK CANTO  II  NOT with more Glories in th' Etherial Plain  The Sun first rises o'er the purpled Main  Than issuing forth the Rival of his Beams  Lanch'd on the Bosom of the Silver  Thames    Fair Nymphs and welldrest Youths around her shone  But ev'ry Eye was fix'd on her alone  On her white Breast a sparkling  Cross  she wore  Which  Jews  might kiss and Infidels adore  Her lively Looks a sprightly Mind disclose  Quick as her Eyes and as unfix'd as those  Favours to none to all she Smiles extends  Oft she rejects but never once offends  Bright as the Sun her Eyes the Gazers strike  And like the Sun they shine on all alike  Yet graceful Ease and Sweetness void of Pride  Might hide her Faults if  Belles  had Faults to hide  If to her share some Female Errors fall  Look on her Face and you'll forget 'em all  This Nymph to the Destruction of Mankind  Nourish'd two Locks which graceful hung behind  In equal Curls and well conspir'd to deck  With shining Ringlets her smooth Iv'ry Neck  Love in these Labyrinths his Slaves detains  And mighty Hearts are held in slender Chains  With hairy Sprindges we the Birds betray  Slight Lines of Hair surprize the Finny Prey  Fair Tresses Man's Imperial Race insnare  And Beauty draws us with a single Hair  Th' Adventrous  Baron  the bright Locks admir'd  He saw he wish'd and to the Prize aspir'd  Resolv'd to win he meditates the way  By Force to ravish or by Fraud betray  For when Success a Lover's Toil attends  Few ask if Fraud or Force attain'd his Ends  For this e're  Phaebus  rose he had implor'd  Propitious Heav'n and ev'ry Pow'r ador'd  But chiefly  Love  to  Love  an Altar built  Of twelve vast  French  Romances neatly gilt  There lay the Swordknot  Sylvia  's Hands had sown  With  Flavia  's Busk that oft had rapp'd his own  A Fan a Garter half a Pair of Gloves  And all the Trophies of his former Loves  With tender  Billetdoux  he lights the Pyre  And breaths three am'rous Sighs to raise the Fire  Then prostrate falls and begs with ardent Eyes  Soon to obtain and long possess the Prize  The Pow'rs gave Ear and granted half his Pray'r  The rest the Winds dispers'd in empty Air  But now secure the painted Vessel glides  The Sunbeams trembling on the floating Tydes  While melting Musick steals upon the Sky  And soften'd Sounds along the Waters die  Smooth flow the Waves the Zephyrs gently play  Belinda  smil'd and all the World was gay  All but the  Sylph  With careful Thoughts opprest  Th' impending Woe sate heavy on his Breast  He summons strait his Denizens of Air  The lucid Squadrons round the Sails repair  Soft o'er the Shrouds Aerial Whispers breath  That seem'd but  Zephyrs  to the Train beneath  Some to the Sun their InsectWings unfold  Waft on the Breeze or sink in Clouds of Gold  Transparent Forms too fine for mortal Sight  Their fluid Bodies half dissolv'd in Light  Loose to the Wind their airy Garments flew  Thin glitt'ring Textures of the filmy Dew  Dipt in the richest Tincture of the Skies  Where Light disports in evermingling Dies  While ev'ry Beam new transient Colours flings  Colours that change whene'er they wave their Wings  Amid the Circle on the gilded Mast  Superior by the Head was  Ariel  plac'd  His Purple Pinions opening to the Sun  He rais'd his Azure Wand and thus begun  Ye  Sylphs  and  Sylphids  to your Chief give Ear  Fays Fairies Genii Elves  and  Daemons  hear  Ye know the Spheres and various Tasks assign'd  By Laws Eternal to th' Aerial Kind  Some in the Fields of purest  Aether  play  And bask and whiten in the Blaze of Day  Some guide the Course of wandring Orbs on high  Or roll the Planets thro' the boundless Sky  Some less refin'd beneath the Moon's pale Light  Hover and catch the shooting Stars by Night  Or suck the Mists in grosser Air below  Or dip their Pinions in the painted Bow  Or brew fierce Tempests on the wintry Main  Or on the Glebe distill the kindly Rain  Others on Earth o'er human Race preside  Watch all their Ways and all their Actions guide  Of these the Chief the Care of Nations own  And guard with Arms Divine the  British Throne    Our humbler Province is to tend the Fair  Not a less pleasing tho' less glorious Care  To save the Powder from too rude a Gale  Nor let th' imprison'd Essences exhale  To draw fresh Colours from the vernal Flow'rs  To steal from Rainbows ere they drop in Show'rs  A brighter Wash to curl their waving Hairs  Assist their Blushes and inspire their Airs  Nay oft in Dreams Invention we bestow  To change a  Flounce  or add a  Furbelo    This Day black Omens threat the brightest Fair  That e'er deserv'd a watchful Spirit's Care  Some dire Disaster or by Force or Slight  But what or where the Fates have wrapt in Night  Whether the Nymph shall break  Diana  's Law  Or some frail  China  Jar receive a Flaw  Or stain her Honour or her new Brocade  Forget her Pray'rs or miss a Masquerade  Or lose her Heart or Necklace at a Ball  Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that  Shock  must fall  Haste then ye Spirits to your Charge repair  The flutt'ring Fan be  Zephyretta  's Care  The Drops to thee  Brillante  we consign  And  Momentilla  let the Watch be thine  Do thou  Crispissa  tend her fav'rite Lock  Ariel  himself shall be the Guard of  Shock    To Fifty chosen  Sylphs  of special Note  We trust th' important Charge the  Petticoat    Oft have we known that sev'nfold Fence to fail  Tho' stiff with Hoops and arm'd with Ribs of Whale  Form a strong Line about the Silver Bound  And guard the wide Circumference around  Whatever Spirit careless of his Charge  His Post neglects or leaves the Fair at large  Shall feel sharp Vengeance soon o'ertake his Sins  Be stopt in  Vials  or transfixt with  Pins    Or plung'd in Lakes of bitter  Washes  lie  Or wedg'd whole Ages in a  Bodkin's  Eye  Gums  and  Pomatums  shall his Flight restrain  While clog'd he beats his silken Wings in vain  Or Alom  Stypticks  with contracting Power  Shrink his thin Essence like a rivell'd Flower  Ixion  fix'd the Wretch shall feel  giddy Motion of the whirling Mill  Fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow  tremble at the Sea that froaths below  He spoke the Spirits from the Sails descend  Orb in Orb around the Nymph extend  thrid the mazy Ringlets of her Hair  hang upon the Pendants of her Ear  With beating Hearts the dire Event they wait  Anxious and trembling for the Birth of Fate  THE  RAPE  of the  LOCK CANTO  III  CLOSE by those Meads for ever crown'd with Flow'rs  Where  Thames  with Pride surveys his rising Tow'rs  There stands a Structure of Majestick Frame  Which from the neighb'ring  Hampton  takes its Name  Here  Britain  's Statesmen oft the Fall foredoom  Of Foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home  Here Thou great  Anna  whom three Realms obey  Dost sometimes Counsel takeand sometimes  Tea    Hither the Heroes and the Nymphs resort  To taste awhile the Pleasures of a Court  In various Talk th' instructive hours they past  Who gave a  Ball  or paid the  Visit  last  One speaks the Glory of the  British Queen    And one describes a charming  Indian Screen    A third interprets Motions Looks and Eyes  At ev'ry Word a Reputation dies  Snuff  or the  Fan  supply each Pause of Chat  With singing laughing ogling and all that  Mean while declining from the Noon of Day  The Sun obliquely shoots his burning Ray  The hungry Judges soon the Sentence sign  And Wretches hang that Jurymen may Dine  The Merchant from th'  Exchange  returns in Peace  And the long Labours of the  Toilette  cease  Belinda  now whom Thirst of Fame invites  Burns to encounter two adventrous Knights  At  Ombre  singly to decide their Doom  And swells her Breast with Conquests yet to come  Strait the three Bands prepare in Arms to join  Each Band the number of the Sacred Nine  Soon as she spreads her Hand th' Aerial Guard  Descend and sit on each important Card  First  Ariel  perch'd upon a  Matadore    Then each according to the Rank they bore  For  Sylphs  yet mindful of their ancient Race  Are as when Women wondrous fond of Place  Behold four  Kings  in Majesty rever'd  With hoary Whiskers and a forky Beard  And four fair  Queens  whose hands sustain a Flow'r  Th' expressive Emblem of their softer Pow'r  Four  Knaves  in Garbs succinct a trusty Band  Caps on their heads and Halberds in their hand  And Particolour'd Troops a shining Train  Draw forth to Combat on the Velvet Plain  The skilful Nymph reviews her Force with Care  Let Spades be Trumps  she said and Trumps they were  Now move to War her Sable  Matadores    In Show like Leaders of the swarthy  Moors    Spadillio  first unconquerable Lord  Led off two captive Trumps and swept the Board  As many more  Manillio  forc'd to yield  And march'd a Victor from the verdant Field  Him  Basto  follow'd but his Fate more hard  Gain'd but one Trump and one  Plebeian  Card  With his broad Sabre next a Chief in Years  The hoary Majesty of  Spades  appears  Puts forth one manly Leg to sight reveal'd  The rest his manycolour'd Robe conceal'd  The Rebel  Knave  that dares his Prince engage  Proves the just Victim of his Royal Rage  Ev'n mighty  Pam  that Kings and Queens o'erthrew  And mow'd down Armies in the Fights of  Lu    Sad Chance of War now destitute of Aid  Falls undistinguish'd by the Victor  Spade    Thus far both Armies to  Belinda  yield  Now to the  Baron  Fate inclines the Field  His warlike  Amazon  her Host invades  Th' Imperial Consort of the Crown of  Spades    The  Club's  black Tyrant first her Victim dy'd  Spite of his haughty Mien and barb'rous Pride  What boots the Regal Circle on his Head  His Giant Limbs in State unwieldy spread  That long behind he trails his pompous Robe  And of all Monarchs only grasps the Globe  The  Baron  now his  Diamonds  pours apace  Th' embroider'd  King  who shows but half his Face  And his refulgent  Queen  with Pow'rs combin'd▪  Of broken Troops an easie Conquest find  Clubs Diamonds Hearts  in wild Disorder seen  With Throngs promiscuous strow the level  Thus when dispers'd a routed Army runs  Of  Asia  's Troops and  Africk  's Sable Sons  With like Confusion different Nations fly  In various Habits and of various Dye  The pierc'd Battalions disunited fall  In Heaps on Heaps one Fate o'erwhelms them all  The  Knave  of  Diamonds  now exerts his Arts  And wins oh shameful Chance the  Queen  of  Hearts    At this the Blood the Virgin's Cheek forsook  A livid Paleness spreads o'er all her Look  She sees and trembles at th' approaching Ill  Just in the Jaws of Ruin and  Codille    And now as oft in some distemper'd State  On one nice  Trick  depends the gen'ral Fate  An  Ace  of Hearts steps forth The  King  unseen  Lurk'd in her Hand and mourn'd his captive  Queen    He springs to Vengeance with an eager pace  And falls like Thunder on the prostrate  Ace    The Nymph exulting fills with Shouts the Sky  The Walls the Woods and long Canals reply  Oh thoughtless Mortals ever blind to Fate  Too soon dejected and too soon elate  Sudden these Honours shall be snatch'd away  And curs'd for ever this Victorious Day  For lo the Board with Cups and Spoons is crown'd  The Berries crackle and the Mill turns round  On shining Altars of  Japan  they raise  The silver Lamp and fiery Spirits blaze  From silver Spouts the grateful Liquors glide  And  China  's Earth receives the smoking Tyde  At once they gratify their Scent and Taste  While frequent Cups prolong the rich Repast  Strait hover round the Fair her Airy Band  Some as she sip'd the fuming Liquor fann'd  Some o'er her Lap their careful Plumes display'd  Trembling and conscious of the rich Brocade  Coffee  which makes the Politician wise  And see thro' all things with his half shut Eyes  Sent up in Vapours to the  Baron  's Brain  New Stratagems the radiant Lock to gain  Ah cease rash Youth desist e'er 'tis too late  Fear the just Gods and think of  Vide  Ovid Metam  Scylla  's Fate  Chang'd to a Bird and sent to flit in Air  She dearly pays for  Nisus'  injur'd Hair  But when to Mischief Mortals bend their Mind  How soon fit Instruments of Ill they find  Just then  Clarissa  drew with tempting Grace  A twoedg'd Weapon from her shining Case  So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight  Present the Spear and arm him for the Fight  He takes the Gift with rev'rence and extends  The little Engine on his Finger's Ends  This just behind  Belinda  's Neck he spread  As o'er the fragrant Steams she bends her Head  Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprights repair  A thousand Wings by turns blow back the Hair  And thrice they twitch'd the Diamond in her Ear  Thrice she look'd back and thrice the Foe drew near  Just in that instant anxious  Ariel  sought  The close Recesses of the Virgin's Thought  As on the Nosegay in her Breast reclin'd  He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her Mind  Sudden he view'd in spite of all her Art  An Earthly Lover lurking at her Heart  Amaz'd confus'd he found his Pow'r expir'd  Resign'd to Fate and with a Sigh retir'd  The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring  Forfex  wide  T'inclose the Lock now joins it to divide  Ev'n then before the fatal Engine clos'd  A wretched  Sylph  too fondly interpos'd  Fate urg'd the Sheers and cut the  Sylph  in twain    See  Milton  lib    But Airy Substance soon unites again  The meeting Points the sacred Hair dissever  From the fair Head for ever and for ever  Then flash'd the living Lightnings from her Eyes  And Screams of Horror rend th' affrighted Skies  Not louder Shrieks by Dames to Heav'n are cast  When Husbands or when Monkeys breath their last  Or when rich  China  Vessels fal'n from high  In glittring Dust and painted Fragments lie  Let Wreaths of Triumph now my Temples twine  The Victor cry'd the glorious Prize is mine  While Fish in Streams or Birds delight in Air  Or in a Coach and Six the  British  Fair  As long as  Atalantis  shall be read  Or the small Pillow grace a Lady's Bed  While  Visits  shall be paid on solemn Days  When numerous Waxlights in bright Order blaze  While Nymphs take Treats or Assignations give  So long my Honour Name and Praise shall live  What Time wou'd spare from Steel receives its date  And Monuments like Men submit to Fate  Steel did the Labour of the Gods destroy  And strike to Dust th' Imperial Tow'rs of  Troy    Steel cou'd the Works of mortal Pride confound  And hew Triumphal Arches to the Ground  What Wonder then fair Nymph thy Hairs shou'd feel  The conqu'ring Force of unresisted Steel  THE  RAPE  of the  LOCK CANTO  IV  BUT anxious Cares the pensive Nymph opprest  And secret Passions labour'd in her Breast  Not youthful Kings in Battel seiz'd alive  Not scornful Virgins who their Charms survive  Not ardent Lovers robb'd of all their Bliss  Not ancient Ladies when refus'd a Kiss  Not Tyrants fierce that unrepenting die  Not  Cynthia  when her  Manteau  's pinn'd awry  E'er felt such Rage Resentment and Despair  As Thou sad Virgin for thy ravish'd Hair  For that sad moment when the  Sylphs  withdrew  And  Ariel  weeping from  Belinda  flew  Umbriel  a dusky melancholy Spright  As ever sully'd the fair face of Light  Down to the Central Earth his proper Scene  Repairs to search the gloomy Cave of  Spleen    Swift on his sooty Pinions flitts the  Gnome    And in a Vapour reach'd the dismal Dome  No cheerful Breeze this sullen Region knows  The dreaded  East  is all the Wind that blows  Here in a Grotto sheltred close from Air  And screen'd in Shades from Day's detested Glare  She sighs for ever on her pensive Bed  Pain  at her side and  Languor  at her Head  Two Handmaids wait the Throne Alike in Place  But diff'ring far in Figure and in Face  Here stood  Illnature  like an  ancient Maid    Her wrinkled Form in  Black  and  White  array'd  With store of Pray'rs for Mornings Nights and Noons  Her Hand is fill'd her Bosom with Lampoons  There  Affectation  with a sickly Mien  Shows in her Cheek the Roses of Eighteen  Practis'd to Lisp and hang the Head aside  Faints into Airs and languishes with Pride  On the rich Quilt sinks with becoming Woe  Wrapt in a Gown for Sickness and for Show  The Fair ones feel such Maladies as these  When each new NightDress gives a new Disease  A constant  Vapour  o'er the Palace flies  Strange Phantoms rising as the Mists arise  Dreadful as Hermit's Dreams in haunted Shades  Or bright as Visions of expiring Maids  Now glaring Fiends and Snakes on rolling Spires  Pale Spectres gaping Tombs and Purple Fires  Now Lakes of liquid Gold  Elysian  Scenes  And Crystal Domes and Angels in Machines  Unnumber'd Throngs on ev'ry side are seen  Of Bodies chang'd to various Forms by  Spleen    Here living  Teapots  stand one Arm held out  One bent the Handle this and that the Spout  A Pipkin there like  Homer  's  Tripod  walks  Here sighs a Jar and there a Goosepye talks  Men prove with Child as pow'rful Fancy works  And Maids turn'd Bottels call aloud for Corks  Safe past the  Gnome  thro' this fantastick Band  A Branch of healing  Spleenwort  in his hand  Then thus addrest the Pow'rHail wayward Queen  Who rule the Sex to Fifty from Fifteen  Parent of Vapors and of Female Wit  Who give th'  Hysteric  or  Poetic  Fit  On various Tempers act by various ways  Make some take Physick others scribble Plays  Who cause the Proud their Visits to delay  And send the Godly in a Pett to pray  A Nymph there is that all thy Pow'r disdains  And thousands more in equal Mirth maintains  But oh if e'er thy  Gnome  could spoil a Grace  Or raise a Pimple on a beauteous Face  Like CitronWaters Matron's Cheeks inflame  Or change Complexions at a losing Game  If e'er with airy Horns I planted Heads  Or rumpled Petticoats or tumbled Beds  Or caus'd Suspicion when no Soul was rude  Or discompos'd the Headdress of a Prude  Or e'er to costive LapDog gave Disease  Which not the Tears of brightest Eyes could ease  Hear me and touch  Belinda  with Chagrin  That single Act gives half the World the Spleen  The Goddess with a discontented Air  Seems to reject him tho' she grants his Pray'r  A wondrous Bag with both her Hands she binds  Like that where once  Ulysses  held the Winds  There she collects the Force of Female Lungs  Sighs Sobs and Passions and the War of Tongues  A Vial next she fills with fainting Fears  Soft Sorrows melting Griefs and flowing Tears  The  Gnome  rejoicing bears her Gift away  Spreads his black Wings and slowly mounts to Day  Sunk in  Thalestris'  Arms the Nymph he found  Her Eyes dejected and her Hair unbound  Full o'er their Heads the swelling Bag he rent  And all the Furies issued at the Vent  Belinda  burns with more than mortal Ire  And fierce  Thalestris  fans the rising Fire  O wretched Maid she spread her hands and cry'd  While  Hampton  's Ecchos wretched Maid reply'd  Was it for this you took such constant Care  The  Bodkin Comb  and  Essence  to prepare  For this your Locks in PaperDurance bound  For this with tort'ring Irons wreath'd around  For this with Fillets strain'd your tender Head  And bravely bore the double Loads of Lead  Gods shall the Ravisher display your Hair  While the Fops envy and the Ladies stare  Honour  forbid at whose unrival'd Shrine  Ease Pleasure Virtue All our Sex resign  Methinks already I your Tears survey  Already hear the horrid things they say  Already see you a degraded Toast  And all your Honour in a Whisper lost  How shall I then your helpless Fame defend  'Twill then be Infamy to seem your Friend  And shall this Prize th' inestimable Prize  Expos'd thro' Crystal to the gazing Eyes  And heighten'd by the Diamond's circling Rays  On that Rapacious Hand for ever blaze  Sooner shall Grass in  Hide  Park  Circus  grow  And Wits take Lodgings in the Sound of  Bow    Sooner let Earth Air Sea to  Chaos  fall  Men Monkies Lapdogs Parrots perish all  She said then raging to  Sir Plume  repairs  And bids her  Beau  demand the precious Hairs    Sir Plume  of  Amber Snuffbox  justly vain  And the nice Conduct of a  clouded Cane    With earnest Eyes and round unthinking Face  He first the Snuffbox open'd then the Case  And thus broke out "My Lord why what the Devil  "Zds damn the Lock 'fore Gad you must be civil  "Plague on't 'tis past a Jestnay prithee Pox  "Give her the Hairhe spoke and rapp'd his Box  It grieves me much reply'd the Peer again  Who speaks so well shou'd ever speak in vain  But  In allusion to  Achilles  's Oath in  Homer  Il    by this Lock this sacred Lock I swear  Which never more shall join its parted Hair  Which never more its Honours shall renew  Clipt from the lovely Head where once it grew  That while my Nostrils draw the vital Air  This Hand which won it shall for ever wear  He spoke and speaking in proud Triumph spread  The longcontended Honours of her Head  But  Umbriel  hateful  Gnome  forbears not so  He breaks the Vial whence the Sorrows flow  Then see the  Nymph  in beauteous Grief appears  Her Eyes half languishing half drown'd in Tears  On her heav'd Bosom hung her drooping Head  Which with a Sigh she rais'd and thus she said  For ever curs'd be this detested Day  Which snatch'd my best my fav'rite Curl away  Happy ah ten times happy had I been  If  HamptonCourt  these Eyes had never seen  Yet am not I the first mistaken Maid  By Love of  Courts  to num'rous Ills betray'd  Oh had I rather unadmir'd remain'd  In some lone Isle or distant  Northern  Land  Where the gilt  Chariot  never mark'd the way  Where none learn  Ombre  none e'er taste  Bohea    There kept my Charms conceal'd from mortal Eye  Like Roses that in Desarts bloom and die  What mov'd my Mind with youthful Lords to rome  O had I stay'd and said my Pray'rs at home  'Twas this the Morning  Omens  did foretel  Thrice from my trembling hand the  Patchbox  fell  The tott'ring  China  shook without a Wind  Nay  Poll  sate mute and  Shock  was most Unkind  A  Sylph  too warn'd me of the Threats of Fate  In mystic Visions now believ'd too late  See the poor Remnants of this slighted Hair  My hands shall rend what ev'n thy own did spare  This in two sable Ringlets taught to break  Once gave new Beauties to the snowie Neck  The SisterLock now sits uncouth alone  And in its Fellow's Fate foresees its own  Uncurl'd it hangs the fatal Sheers demands  And tempts once more thy sacrilegious Hands  Oh hadst thou Cruel been content to seize  Hairs less in sight or any Hairs but these  THE  RAPE  of the  LOCK CANTO  V  SHE said the pitying Audience melt in Tears  But  Fate  and  Jove  had stopp'd the  Baron  's Ears  In vain  Thalestris  with Reproach assails  For who can move when fair  Belinda  fails  Not half so fixt the  Trojan  cou'd remain  While  Anna  begg'd and  Dido  rag'd in vain  To Arms to Arms the bold  Thalestris  cries  And swift as Lightning to the Combate flies  All side in Parties and begin th' Attack  Fans clap Silks russle and tough Whalebones crack  Heroes and Heroins Shouts confus'dly rise  And base and treble Voices strike the Skies  No common Weapons in their Hands are found  Like Gods they fight nor dread a mortal Wound  Homer  Il    So when bold  Homer  makes the Gods engage  And heav'nly Breasts with human Passions rage  'Gainst  Pallas Mars Latona Hermes  Arms  And all  Olympus  rings with loud Alarms  Jove  's Thunder roars Heav'n trembles all around  Blue  Neptune  storms the bellowing Deeps resound  Earth  shakes her nodding Tow'rs the Ground gives way  And the pale Ghosts start at the Flash of Day  Triumphant  Umbriel  on a Sconce's Height  Clapt his glad Wings and sate to view the Fight  Propt on their Bodkin Spears the Sprights survey  The growing Combat or assist the Fray  While thro' the Press enrag'd  Thalestris  flies  And scatters Deaths around from both her Eyes  A  Beau  and  Witling  perish'd in the Throng  One dy'd in  Metaphor  and one in  Song    O cruel Nymph a living Death I bear  Cry'd  Dapperwit  and sunk beside his Chair  A mournful Glance Sir  Fopling  upwards cast  A Song in the Opera of  Camilla  Those Eyes are made so killing  was his last  Thus on  Meander  's flow'ry Margin lies▪  Th' expiring Swan and as he sings he dies  As bold Sir  Plume  had drawn  Clarissa  down  Chloe  stept in and kill'd him with a Frown  She smil'd to see the doughty Hero slain  But at her Smile the Beau reviv'd again  Vid  Homer  Il      Virg  Aen    Now  Jove  suspends his golden Scales in Air  Weighs the Mens Wits against the Lady's Hair  The doubtful Beam long nods from side to side  At length the Wits mount up the Hairs subside  See fierce  Belinda  on the  Baron  flies  With more than usual Lightning in her Eyes  Nor fear'd the Chief th' unequal Fight to try  Who sought no more than on his Foe to die  But this bold Lord with manly Strength indu'd  She with one Finger and a Thumb subdu'd  Just where the Breath of Life his Nostrils drew  A Charge of  Snuff  the wily Virgin threw  The  Gnomes  direct to ev'ry Atome just  The pungent Grains of titillating Dust  Sudden with starting Tears each Eye o'erflows  And the high Dome reecchoes to his Nose  Now meet thy Fate th' incens'd Virago cry'd  And drew a deadly  Bodkin  from her Side    In Imitation of the Progress of  Agamemnon  's Scepter in  Homer  Il    The same his ancient Personage to deck  Her great great Grandsire wore about his Neck  In three  SealRings  which after melted down  Form'd a vast  Buckle  for his Widow's Gown  Her infant Grandame's  Whistle  next it grew  The  Bells  she gingled and the  Whistle  blew  Then in a  Bodkin  grac'd her Mother's Hairs  Which long she wore and now  Belinda  wears  Boast not my Fall he cry'd insulting Foe  Thou by some other shalt be laid as low  Nor think to die dejects my lofty Mind  All that I dread is leaving you behind  Rather than so ah let me still survive  And burn in  Cupid  's Flames but burn alive  Restore the Lock  she cries and all around  Restore the Lock  the vaulted Roofs rebound  Not fierce  Othello  in so loud a Strain  Roar'd for the Handkerchief that caus'd his Pain  But see how oft Ambitious Aims are cross'd  And Chiefs contend 'till all the Prize is lost  The Lock obtain'd with Guilt and kept with Pain  In ev'ry place is sought but sought in vain  With such a Prize no Mortal must be blest  So Heav'n decrees with Heav'n who can contest  Some thought it mounted to the Lunar Sphere  Vid  Ariosto Canto  Since all things lost on Earth are treasur'd there  There Heroe's Wits are kept in pondrous Vases  And Beau's in  Snuffboxes  and  TweezerCases    There broken Vows and Deathbed Alms are found  And Lovers Hearts with Ends of Riband bound  The Courtiers Promises and Sick Man's Pray'rs  The Smiles of Harlots and the Tears of Heirs  Cages for Gnats and Chains to Yoak a Flea  Dry'd Butterflies and Tomes of Casuistry  But trust the Museshe saw it upward rise  Tho' mark'd by none but quick Poetic Eyes  So  Rome  's great Founder to the Heav'ns withdrew  To  Proculus  alone confess'd in view  A sudden Star it shot thro' liquid Air  And drew behind a radiant  Trail of Hair    Not  Berenice  's Locks first rose so bright  The Skies bespangling with dishevel'd Light  The  Sylphs  behold it kindling as it flies  And pleas'd pursue its Progress thro' the Skies  This the  Beaumonde  shall from the  Mall  survey  And hail with Musick its propitious Ray  This the blest Lover shall for  Venus  take  And send up Vows from  Rosamonda  's Lake  This  Partridge  soon shall view in cloudless Skies  When next he looks thro'  Galilaeo  's Eyes  And hence th' Egregious Wizard shall foredoom  The Fate of  Louis  and the Fall of  Rome    Then cease bright Nymph to mourn the ravish'd Hair  Which adds new Glory to the shining Sphere  Not all the Tresses that fair Head can boast  Shall draw such Envy as the Lock you lost  For after all the Murders of your Eye  When after Millions slain your self shall die  When those fair Suns shall sett as sett they must  And all those Tresses shall be laid in Dust  This Lock  the Muse shall consecrate to Fame  And mid'st the Stars inscribe  Belinda  's Name  FINIS
