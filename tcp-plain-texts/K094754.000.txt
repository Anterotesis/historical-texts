 THE CANDIDATE BY Mr GRAY  WHEN sly Jemmy Twitcher had smugg'd up his face  With a lick of court whitewash and pious grimace  A wooing he went where three Sisters of old  In harmless society guttle and scold  Lord Sister says Physic to Law I declare  Such a sheepbiting look such a pickpocket air  Not I for the Indies you know I'm no prude  But his nose is a shame and his eyes are so lewd  Then he shambles and straddles so oddly I fear  No at our time of life 'twould be silly my dear  I don't know says Law now methinks for his look  'Tis just like the picture in Rochester's book  But his character Phyzzy his morals his life  When she died I can't tell but he once had a wife  They say he's no Christian loves drinking and whoring  And all the town rings of his swearing and roaring  His lying and filching and Newgatebird tricks  Not Ifor a coronet chariot and six  Divinity heard between waking and dozing  Her sisters denying and Jemmy proposing  From dinner she rose with her bumper in hand  She stroked up her belly and stroked down her band  What a pother is here about wenching and roaring  Why David loved catches and Solomon whoring  Did not Israel filch from th' Aegyptians of old  Their jewels of silver and jewels of gold  The prophet of Bethel we read told a lie  He drinks so did Noah he swears so do I  To refuse him for such peccadillos were odd  Besides he repents and he talks about G  Never hang down your head you poor penitent elf  Come buss me I'll be Mrs Twitcher myself  Dn ye both for a couple of Puritan bitches  He's Christian enough that repents and that
