 THE TrueBorn  Englishman  A SATYR Answer'd Paragraph by Paragraph  Nescio quâ Natale solum dulcedine cunctos  ucit immemores non sinit esse sui  Ovid  London  Printed in the Year  TO THE Right Worshipful Sir  Charles Duncomb  Knt And Alderman of the City of  London    SIR  THO' Your Merit has such an establish'd Basis that neither the Malice of the  Evil Speaker  nor the restless Attempts of the  Evil Doer  can shake it and Your Memory stands secur'd of Fame and Immortality in spight of the Murmurs of the Seditious and the prevailing Numbers of a sort of People who are unacquainted with  Justice  or  fair Dealing  yet 'tis but fitting that some should stand up in Vindication of what every one should defend and Assert the Cause of a Gentleman whose  Works of Charity  deserve better returns than the Base and  Ʋncharitable  Reflections that are flung upon him  But you have this Consolation amongst the Clamours of the Ungrateful that the same Person who makes it his Business to misrepresent Your Vertues and render 'em Odious if possible to Posterity has done the same by Your Country and as you have alway's stood up for the Kingdoms good against all manner of Opposers so you are now a sufferer with it from the Calumnies that are equally darted against Both  To be a Patriot in these days is to provide a Task for the Tongues of the Envious and to give Alms and Relieve those that are in want is immediately set down for an Act of  Ostentation  else Sir  Charles Duncomb  had seen his Countrymen  Reap  the Fruits of what he  Sow'd  and the Voice of the People had bless'd him for giving Ear to the Cry of the Prisoners and plentifully dealing part of what he was possess'd of to People in Distress  But I give more Offence to your Patience in remembring you of the  Good  you have done than the  Poetaster  who has occasion'd the following Remarks by putting on the Readers belief by the  Ill  you have  not  and it is equally troublesome to be accus'd of Faults  you are not Guilty of as it is to be told of Vertues which are inherent in Your Temper and shine with such a continued Lustre in all Your Actions  I shall therefore only leave my Petition behind me for Your Acceptance of what the knowledge of Your Worth has occasion'd and if the  Papers  I have written have not done that Justice either to my Country or Your Self Which both deserv'd that You would give me leave to beg pardon for their Defects and impute 'em to the too hasty Zeal of  Sir  Your most Humble And most Obedient Servant  THE PREFACE  THere being nothing material in the Preface to this scurrilous Satyr that has not been repeated over and over again in the Body of it I cannot but think it very suitable to the Business in hand to forbear making any further Remarks on the Poets Indecencies and apply my self to make Excuses for my own  If the Performance I have let loose into the World is Bad I have nothing to urge in my own defence but the hast I was oblig'd to make in the finishing it thro' the desire of two or three Friends and the difficulty there is in answering a Pamphlet Paragraph by Paragraph which has such a Redundancy of Tautologies as this has  I should indeed have made my Reply to it in Verse that being counted the fairer way of entring the Lists with a Poet but as I never had any great Inclination to  Dactyls  and  Spondees  so I was afraid I should shew my self as great a Bungler at the  Trade  of Rhiming as the Person has convinc'd the World he is whom I write in opposition to  However since he ends his Preface in Verse I hope I shall stand excus'd if I make use of the same Method and give the Reader a short Specimen of my Poetry after he has tyr'd him with a large one of his My Intent at first notwithstanding my small Acquaintance with the Nine  Water drinking  Ladies the Muses was to have taken up the Cudgels with him in Verse but such a Design requiring more Time than I have to bestow upon Poetry I thought it advisable to lay it aside that I might drudge on in the Beaten Way of  good Honest Humble  Prose and have flung by the following Lines which were written as so many Answers to his two first Paragraphs  Satyr Arise Thy Whips and Stings provide  And shake thy Scorpions on thy Country's side  While her own Sons their Parents Bowels tear  And meditate a more than Civil War  Speak speak the Cause that make's the Vip'rous Breed  The Rules of Modesty and Truth exceed  Eager to deal about their want of Shame  And impiously Elaspheme BRITANNIA's Name  The Land has yet tho' punish'd for it's Crimes  Patriots who dare be just in thankless Times  Whom neither Gifts nor Pensions can Persuade  Tamely to see their Liberties betray'd  Or  Forreigners  their proper Rights invad    Not that they would Alliances disclaim  But  Dch  Men are at  Home  at  Amam    And it has been a Customary thing  For  Englishmen  to serve an  English  King  Else had our Senators with Patience heard  Myn Heer to  Prciplity  prefer'd  And  H  deservedly the Nation's Boast  Forborn Reflections on a  Pg's  Post  But since Excess of Ryl Bounty falls  And He Commands within the Place Walls  Since on his Leg the  British  Order shines  And He disdain's His Belgick Father's Loyns  The  GoldenKey  not make's the Patriot speak  But  England  's Honour and His Countrie's sake  THE True BornEnglishman A SATYR Answer'd Paragraph by Paragraph  AS it is the Duty of every one that breaths  English  Air to stand up for the Place of his Nativity and Vindicate the  English  Nation from the Reproaches which Malice would fasten on it so I cannot but think my self oblig'd to take notice of a Libel which has stoln into the World under the Name of a Satyr and dispers'd its Venom in a conceal'd manner against a People whose Reputation in the Arts of War and Peace has rendred 'em Famous throughout all Christendom Had the Author of it been  an open Enemy perhaps I could have born it  but he is  our Acquaintance and our familiar Friend  a Man subject to the same Laws as  Englishmen  are and Liable to the same Obligations entertain'd by 'em when he was forc'd  to fly from the  Scourges  of  Ireland  and Hospitably receiv'd when he had not where to lay his Head in a Kingdom which owes her Obedience to this The Printer also is known for what he is a Sowre Discontented Canting Fellow as ever  Murmur'd  at falling  Manna  or found fault with the Bounties of the Almighty He has formerly been made City Surveyor for a Crime of the same Nature and taken a Prospect of its Buildings from his Wooden Edifice in the middle of the Street and one might have thought unless he was in love with that Scandalous Office he would have avoided all manner of Occasion of bring  lifted up above his Neighbours  again But He's arriv'd to such a heighth of Malignancy such an inveteracy of Temper as to be his Author's Humble Servant while he was Lampooning his God and making Sport with the Divine Existence of Him that made Him Therefore 'tis not to be suppos'd he would stick at lending his helping Hand towards Abuses upon the Country where he would have us think him  Born  after he had been forward in promoting Blasphemous Expressions against the Holy One of  Israel  that gave him  Breath  I shall have Field enough elsewhere to take the Author to task who acknowledg'd he expected it in his Preface tho' for other sort of Indecencies than His  mean Style rough Verse and incorrect Language  and make appear he labours under a greater scarcity of Manners than the Country he shews his Teeth at ever can We are happy indeed that a Man of his Character has no great esteem for us and 'tis a certain sign a People is Good when those who are notoriously Wicked speak reproachfully of 'em since it must be granted few Men fall out  with their own likeness or are at variance with their own Resemblance But  a Man is known by his Works  and the way to make him appear in his true Colours is to search into 'em and find out the Blackness of his  Soul  by the foulness of his  Thoughts  It's fitting therefore we fall into the  SATYR  and examine whether the Poet be as infamous as the Subject or he has the same Talent of ingratitude in Verse as he is celebrated for in Prose Mr  T  has a fit of Mortification coming upon him or he would have less value for the Hungry Entertainments on Mount  Parnassus  and is reconciling himself to his old Jesuitical Abstinence and Days of Fasting or he would scarce fall in Love with telling his Fingers and making wry Faces for adequate Epithets as he now certainly does While his versifying Folly gives us Occasion to examine his other faults and make an Estimate of the last from the wretched Ingredients the first is compos'd of But his Poetry carries such an invitation with it that it's pity the Reader should be any longer detain'd from it I shall begin therefore with the Invocation of his Muse which I find is but a very scurvey one by her Name and to avoid Confusion make Remarks on this Celebrated Piece Paragraph after Paragraph  The Introduction  Speak  Satyr  for there's none can tell like thee  Whether 'tis Folly Pride or Knavery  That makes the discontented Land appear  Less happy now in Times of Peace than War  Why Civil Feuds disturb the Nation more  Than all our bloody Wars have done before  Satyr  is too mild a Name and the Design of it too good to be made use of by such a Person as the Poet had he desir'd the assistance of a  Bilingsgate  Amazon 'twould have been more agreeable to the Matter contain'd in the Poem For Reformation is very far from his Intentions since to create Jealousies and Uneasiness amongst us has been always the business of Incendiaries like himself and if the Land is discontented he's mistaken in the Cause of it which probably is we have had so much Money spent to support a  War  that some People have very little left to enjoy after a  Peace    Fools out of Favour grudge at Knaves in Place  And Men are always honest in Disgrace  The CourtPreferments make Men Knaves in course  But they which wou'd be in them wou'd be worse  'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine  Wou'd Foreigners their Perquisites resign  The Grand Contention's plainly to be seen  To get some Men put out and some put in  For this our Srs make long Harangues  And florid Mrs whet their polish'd Tongues  Statesmen are always sick of one Disease  And a good Pension gives them present Ease  That's the Specifick makes them all content  With any King and any Government  Good Patriots at CourtAbuses rail  And all the Nation's Grievances bewail  But when the  Sov'reign Balsam  's once appli'd  The Zealot never fails to change his Side  And when he must the  Golden Key  resign  The  Railing Spirit  comes about again  The Parliament in general is much oblig'd to him for some Expressions in this Paragraph and Mr  H  in particular who I am satisfied loves his Country better than any  Golden Key  whatsoever Every true Patriot ought to stand up for his own Countrymen and if Foreigners jump into Posts that our Civil Constitutions allow  Natives  only to be instated in 'tis their Business as they are  English  Representatives to take care of the Peoples Prerogatives they are entrusted with And if those  florid Members  that stand up for the Liberties of the People do it for the sake of a  Pension  he passes a very odd Compliment on His Majesty by insinuating as much as when they are sick of the  MoneyDistemper  there is a certain  Court Elixir  which has been infallible in the Cure of 'em  Who shall this Bubbl'd Nation disabuse  While they their own Felicities refuse  Who at the Wars have made such mighty Pother  And now are falling out with one another  With needless Fears the Jealous Nation fill  And always have been sav'd against their Will  Who Fifty Millions  Sterling  have disburs'd  To be with Peace and too much Plenty curs'd  Who their Old Monarch eagerly undo  And yet uneasily obey the New  Search  Satyr  search a deep Incision make  The Poison's strong the Antidote's too weak  'Tis pointed Truth must manage this Dispute  And downright English  Englishmen  confute  If the Nation's  Bubbled  it's well for the Gamesters at t'other end of the Town but I am a better Subject than to think so I hear of no Members that  refuse their own Felicities  but are against giving away their Birthright to Strangers And how we come to be  sav'd against our will  it's impossible for me to conjecture when if we had not forwarded our own Salvations Matters would scarce have been as they now stand and our New Monarch had not had the Gift of our Obedience had not we eagerly undone our Old which is far from being an Act that is involuntary But our Author is as good at Sense as he is at Chirurgery when he's for making  Incisions  instead of giving proper Antidotes to repel Poison  Whet thy just Anger at the Nation's Pride  And with keen Phrase repel the Vicious Tide  To  Englishmen  their own beginnings show  And ask them why they slight their Neighbours so  Go back to Elder Times and Ages past  And Nations into long Oblivion cast  To Old  Britannia's  Youthful Days retire  And there for  TrueBorn Englishmen  enquire  Britannia  freely will disown the Name  And hardly knows her self from whence they came  Wonders that They of all Men shou'd pretend  To  Birth  and  Blood  and for a Name contend  Go back to Causes where our Follies dwell  And fetch the dark Original from Hell  Speak  Satyr  for there's none like thee can tell  Our Author's  Keen Phrase  is made ill use of in this Place and the question about  slighting  our Neighbours very improper Because we don't think any of 'em worthy of the Prpalty of  Wales  is that any injury to 'em Or that we repine at the Gift of a BlewG when our own Noblemen go without it does that bear the Face of a  Slight  The common Principle of Nature persuades us to consult our own good first and he gives a small increase to the Nobility of the  Dch  by depretiating the Original of the  English  who though they have underwent the common Fate of other Conquer'd Countries have no Lords among 'em that were  Oilmen  or Statesmen with  Coronets  on their Coaches that yesterday shoulder'd a  Bunch of Turnips  from the Market  THE TrueBorn  Englishman  Answered c PART I  An  English  Proverb  Where God has a Church the Devil has a Chappel  WHereever God erects a House of Prayer  The Devil always builds a Chappel there  And 'twill be found upon Examination  The latter has the largest Congregation  For ever since be first debauch'd the Mind  He made a perfect Conquest of Mankind  With Ʋniformity of Service he  Reigns with a general Aristocracy  No Nonconforming Sects disturb his Reign  For of his Yoak there's very few complain  He knows the Genius and the Inclination  And matches proper Sins for ev'ry Nation  He needs no StandingArmy Government  He always rules us by our own Consent  His Laws are easy and his gentle Sway  Makes it exceeding pleasant to obey  The List of his Vicegerents and Commanders  Outdoes your  Caesars  or your  Alexanders    They never fail of his Infernal Aid  And he's as certain ne'er to be betray'd  Thro' all the World they spread his vast Command  And Death's Eternal Empire's maintain'd  They rule so politickly and so well  As if they were L Jof Hell  Duly divided to debauch Mankind  And plant Infernal Dictates in his Mind  To begin with an  English  Proverb looks very much as if our Author was no great Doctor at  English  Poetry and though T smells very much of a Church with a Chimney in it some Roguish sort of Wags will be apt to say he is one of those that plies at the  Devil's Chappel  I don't mean the Supposititious one which he would have the Church of  England  go by the Name of from its  Ʋniformity of Service  but  Calves Head Assemblies  where Nonconformists meet together on the  th  of  January  to give Glory to God for his Permission in suffering the best of Kings to be murder'd by his Subjects that Day before his own Palace Gates  Pride  the First Peer and President of Hell  To his share  Spain  that largest Province fell  The subtile Prince thought fittest to bestow  On these the Golden Mines of  Mexico  With all the Silver Mountains of  Peru  Wealth which would in wise hands the World undo  Because he knew their Genius was such  Too Lazy and too Haughty to be Rich  So proud a People so above their Fate  That if reduc'd to beg they'll beg in State  Lavish of Money to be counted Brave  And Proudly starve because they scorn to save  Never was Nation in the World before  So very Rich and yet so very Poor  If  Pride  had  Spain for her Province Ireland  it's certain who had its Inhabitants from thence came in for a share of it Governess's Favours and there must needs be a smack of it in the Poet  's  Constitution who as I have been told was a  Priest of that Nation But how 'tis a  Wise  thing to  undo the World  I can't imagine unless Mischief is an instance of Policy and Barbarity a great Token of  Wisdom  That's certain if his Doctrine be true the World's in as fair a way to be undone as a Wicked Man can wish if the Gold of  Peru  being in  Wise hands viz French  Refiners can make it so  Lust  chose the Torrid Zone of  Italy  Where Blood ferments in Rapes and Sodomy  Where swelling Veins o'erflow with living Streams  With Heat impregnate from  Vesuvian  Flames  Whose flowing Sulphur forms Infernal Lakes  And human Body of the Soil partakes  There Nature ever burns with hot Desires  Fann'd with Luxuriant Air from Subterranean Fires  Here undisturb'd in Floods of scalding Lust  Th' Infernal King reigns with Infernal Gust  Italy  is indeed a hot Country but some degrees cooler than the  WestIndies  which are beyond the  Line  and plac'd under the  Torrid Zone  Had the Poet amongst his other Enquiries consulted the Celestial Globe he would have said otherwise but it may be a mistake and probably he design'd the Satyr upon  Jamaica  or  Barbardo's  which had been proper enough because so many Letcherous Whores and Rogues have made choice of those Places to reside in I have heard likewise that Air has blown up and kindled a Fire but never was inform'd before that it was the  Effect  of  Fire  since I am rather apt to believe it is the  Cause    Drunk'ness  the Darling Favourite of Hell  Chose  Germany  to rule and rules so well  No Subjects more obsequiously obey  None please so well or are so pleas'd as they  The cunning Artist manages so well  He lets them Bow to Heav'n and Drink to Hell  If but to Wine and him they Homage pay  He cares not to what Deity they Pray  What God they Worship most or in what way  Whether by  Luther Calvin  or by  Rome  They sail for Heav'n by Wine he steers them home  I perceive now that the Spark has read  Heylin  's  Cosmography  and taken the Character of  Germany  on trust from him But he cannot assign the same Reasons for their  Drunkenness  as he does for the  Italians Lust  since 'tis certain these Men  Intemperance  are no more influenc'd by the  Temperate Zone  which the greatest part of it lies directly under than those Children of Lust are affected by the  Torrid  But if none  please the Devil so well as they  how comes he in his Virulent Expressions against the  English  to say they are his Chief Favourites Contradiction is a Talent peculiar to himself and evil speaking altogether his own else he would not make 'em  Sail for Heav'n  with old  Nick  at the Helm plying at the  Steerage  or make the Devil bring 'em all into Hell notwithstanding their Attempts to gain Heav'n by following the Doctrines of  Luther Calvin  or  Rome  An instance of our Author's Thoughts of the weakness of Pray'r and the inefficacy of any sort of Devotion whatsoever  Ʋrgovern'd Passion settled in  France  Where Mankind lives in haste and thrives by Chance  A  Dancing Nation  Fickle and Ʋntrue  Have oft undone themselves and others too  Prompt the Infernal Dictates to obey  And in Hell's Favour none more great than they  Just before none pleas'd the Devil  so well  as the  Germans  but now the Scene's alter'd to  France  and none are  more great in his Favour  than the People of that Nation How to reconcile the Superiority of 'em Both to Sence I know not no more than I do the Character he gives the  French  Men of  thriving by Chance  when their Industry is so well known as to make their  Misfortunes  the Effect of  Chance  not the  Success  which generally attends their Endeavours in matters of  Trade    The  Pagan  World be blindly leads away  And Personally rules with Arbitrary Sway  The Mask thrown Off  Plain Devil  his Title stands  And what elsewhere he Tempts he there Commands  There with full Gust th' Ambition of his Mind  Governs as he of old in Heav'n design'd  Worshipp'd as God his  Painim Altars  smoke  Embru'd with Blood of those that him Invoke  One might have thought after he had surrendred the greatest part of Christendom into Satan's Hands he would have had some Compassion on his Brother Infidels But however it happens he falls foul upon them too as an Enemy of Mankind in general and either believing the  Turks  to be true Christians or numbring them  with Cannibals commits an Error in making them who are part of the  Pagan World  worship the Devil as God and offer Humane Sacrifice at his Altars which is a sort of Ceremony not us'd in the Eastern Countries who notwithstanding our Author's boasts of an upright Life making less Application to the Devil than his Worship who seems to have a great interest with him  The rest by Deputies he rules as well  And plants the distant Colonies of Hell  By them his secret Power he maintains  And binds the World in his Infernal Chains  That may be but I am apt to think that He that made the World has the Government of it notwithstanding  Satan  's DeputyLieutenants And one would think from his planting  the distant Colonies of Hell  he was settling Plantations beyond the South Seas or had taken possession of some Countries beyond the Moguls after he had given him the Dominion of all Paganism but he seldom advises with his Maps as will be seen by the Country which comes next in Play  By Zeal the  Irish  and the  Rush  by Folly  Fury the  Dane  The  Swede  by Melancholly  By stupid Ignorance the  Muscovite    The  Chinese  by a  Child of Hell  call'd Wit  Wealth makes the  Persian  too Effeminate  And Poverty the  Tartars  Desperate  The  Turks  and  Moors  by  Mah'met  he subdues  And God has giv'n him leave to rule the  Jews  Rage rules the  Portuguese  and Fraud the  Scotch  Revenge the  Pole  and Avarice the  Dutch    By my Shoul Dear Joy is much in the right to give his own Country the Post of Honour  Ireland  has  Zeal  for her Lord Deputy forsooth when  Ignorance  had been more proper for it as being that which is most predominant there And the  Swedes  are Tyrannically dealt with by the  Hypochondria  a Character no Person that knows their way of living can justly give 'em If  Wit  be a  Child of Hell  our Author is certainly a  Child of Heaven  if those who have no manner of Dealings with it deserve that Name But what is chiefly observable in this Paragraph is that the  Dane  and  Portuguese  are so much of the same Complexion that  Fury  rules one and  Rage  the other which in my poor sentiments is they have the same Constitution of Mind A miraculous thing for certain that two Nations should so sympathize when the last is so near the  Sun  and then first so far from it  Satyr  be kind and draw a silent Veil  Thy  Native England  's Vices to conceal  Or if that Task's impossible to do  At least be just and show her Vertues too  Too Great the first Alas the last too Few  Upon my Conscience he need not request his Satyr to be kind it's inoffensive enough in every thing but Impudence But he knows his own Temper best and doubts that 'tis  impossible  for him to treat a Country with any manner of Humanity that has used him better than he deserv'd though he makes a shew of exposing her Virtues to balance her Faults but has not the heart to do it  England  unknown as yet unpeopled lay  Happy had she remain'd so to this day  And not to ev'ry Nation been a Prey  Her Open Harbours and her fertile Plains  The Merchants Glory these and those the Swains  To ev'ry Barbarous Nation have betray'd her  Who conquer her as oft as they Invade her  So Beauty guarded but by Innocence  That ruins her which should be her Defence  For my part I can't find where the  Happiness  of  England  had been to have  lain unpeopled  when without doubt it was design'd at the Creation for Inhabitants as well as the rest of the World neither can I imagine that Person has any great skill in History who affirms that every Barbarous Nation that attempted to invade  Her  gain'd their Ends and were Conquerors even  Rome  her self the Empress of the rest of the World acknowledged repulses from  Her  and  Julius Caesar  's conquering Arms found a stop to 'em for a time by the Valour of  Her  Natives  Ingratitude  a Devil of  Black Renown  Possess'd her very early for his own  An Ʋgly Surly Sullen Selfish Spirit  Who Satan's worst Perfections does inherit  Second to him in Malice and in Force  All  Devil without  and all within him  Worse    If Ingratitude be one of the Ingredients which make up an  Englishman  the Poet has a Title to be called one of the Blood for treating him after such an infamous manner But it's a Mystery to me how this Devil of  Black Renown  could be  Second to Satan in Malice and in Force  when he was preferable to his Sovereign Lord by being much worse than Him which in Hell is a mark of precedence  He  made her Firstborn Race to be so rude  And suffer'd her to be so oft subdu'd  By several Crowds of Wandring Thieves o'errun  Often unpeopl'd and as oft undone  While ev'ry Nation that her Pow'rs reduc'd  Their Languages and Manners introduc'd  From whose mix'd Relicks our compounded Breed  By Spurious Generation does succeed  Making a Race uncertain and unev'n  Deriv  d from all the Nations under Heav'n  Very good DevilIngratitude had an excellent hand at Temptation if he could perswade the Firstborn to be ungrateful before they had any Benefactors I always took it for granted that an ill requital of kind Offices fell under that Name and no Person could be unthankful for a Courtesie before it was receiv'd But this Paragraph affords the Reader great choice of Observations I shall only remark on  as oft unpeopled and as oft undone  and desire 'em to consider how that agrees with part of a foregoing Paragraph that actually says the Land had been happy had it remain'd unpeopled to this very day  The  Romans  first with  Julius Caesar  came  Including all the Nations of that Name  Gauls Greeks  and  Lombards  and by Computation  Auxiliaries or Slaves of ev'ry Nation  With  Hengist Saxons Danes  with  Sueno  came  In search of Plunder not in search of Fame  Scots Picts  and  Irish  from th'  Hibernian  Shore  And Conqu'ring  William  brought the  Normans  o'er  The  Romans Danes  and  Saxons  that's certain Conquer'd us but the same may be said of each of those Countries the  Goths  and  Vandals  having broke in upon the first in such a manner as to destroy their very Language and the other two fall'n under the Fate of Vanquish'd Kingdoms So that we have no great reason to undervalue our selves on the account of Conquest when scarce a Nation in all Christendom has not had Revolutions of the same Nature But what is the greatest and most scandalous Reflection he numbers the  Irish  amongst our Conquerours when it's well known that Kingdom is now dependent on the  English  Crown by the Right of Conquest and that they been have ever since their Settlement such an inconsiderable People as our Kings did not think worth while for a long time to reduce 'em to their present Obedience  All these their Barb'rous Offspring left behind  The Dregs of Armies they of all Mankind  Blended with  Britains  who before were here  Of whom the  Welsh  ha' blest the Character  In the Nonage of Time there was not that distincton made betwixt Man and Man as there is now and when Armies were undisciplin'd they had no swelling Titles to distinguish one Fellow Creature from another neither is it probable that a Country so inviting as he owns this to be should have only the  Dregs of Armes  for its Possessors  From this Amphibious Illborn Mob began  That vain illnatur'd thing an  Englishman  The Customs Sirnames Languages and Manners  Of all these Nations are their own Explainers  Whose Relicks are so lasting and so strong  They ha' left a  Shiboleth  upon our Tongue  By which with easy search you may distinguish  Your  RomanSaxonDanishNorman  English  The Epithet of Amphibious to People who live in an Island when the Sea is its defence is not so scandalous as he design'd it though the Title he gives our Ancestors of an  Illborn Mob  sounds very hard I believe he's so little Conversant in Heraldry as to know nothing of their Originals neither while there was a sort of equality among Men has he any just excuse for lessening the Pedegree of those Forefathers from whence we sprung As for his finding fault with the Cadence of our Language I have heard from several hands he has been dabbling at an alteration of it several times to no effect and I'll defie him to tell me of any modern Tongue which is not made up of a Compound of others as well as ours which has risen from the same Cause  The great Invading  William  the Conq  Norman  let us know  What Conquerors in AfterTimes might do  To ev'ry  Or  Archer  Musqueteer  he brought to Town  He gave the Lands which never were his own  When first the  English  Crown he did obtain  He did not send his  Dutchmen  home again  No Reassumptions in his Reign were known  D'avenant  might there ha' let his Book alone  No Parliament his Army cou'd disband  He rais'd no Money for he paid in Land  He gave his Legions their Eternal Station  And made them all Freeholders of the Nation  He canton'd out the Country to his Men  And ev'ry Soldier was a Denizen  The Rascals thus enrich'd he call'd them  Lords  To please their Ʋpstart Pride with newmade Words  And  DoomsdayBook  his Tyranny records  What Paralel is there between the Case of  William the Conqueror  and that of our late Revolution In his days King  Harold  gave him Battle and oppos'd Force to Force which occasion'd a Conquest but in our Times His present Majesty was receiv'd by the Consent of the People invited over by the Nobility and Gentry and Establish'd in a Throne The whole Power of  Holland  could not have plac'd him in without our own Concurrence Therefore as Matters were different between the Conquerour and him it was but reasonable that those who had made him King should send away the Troops that came to our Assistance since we had not folly enough to think they would have came to rescue us without assurance of being paid nor Estates enough to spare to make a Gentleman of every Foot Soldier Six hundred thousand pound was a greater reward to the States than Queen  Elizabeth  had for saving 'em when they wrote themselves  DISTRESS'D  and he might have spar'd the Story which was more to shew King  William  might have done the same than to disgrace the Original of our Nobility though  what follows shews that also was intended by it  And here begins the Ancient Pedigree  That so exalts our Poor Nobility  'Tis that from some  French  Trooper they derive  Who with the  Norman  Bastard did arrive  The Trophies of the Families appear  Some show the Sword the Bow and some the Spear  Which their Great Ancestor  forsooth  did wear  These in the Heralds Register remain  Their Noble Mean Extraction to explain  Yet who the Hero was no Man can tell  Whether a Drummer or a Colonel  The silence Record blushes to reveal  Their Ʋndescended Dark Original  As Kings are the Fountains from whence Honours are deriv'd so  William the Conqueror  had as much Right to bestow Titles on his Subjects as another Prince has on his and if the Poet was to search into some Foreign Noblemens Families he has such an Esteem for because they are not  English  it would be a good while before he could find either  Sword  or  Bow  or  Spear  for their Crest But he's a Leveller and though he flatters King  William  is but for making one Estate of the Three the Nation is compos'd of and reducing the People under the Government of the People as in the Year  But grant the best How came the Change to pass  A  TrueBorn Englishman  of  Norman  Race  A  Turkish  Horse can show more History  To prove his Welldescended Family  Conquest  as by the  Dr  Sherl  De Facto  Moderns 'tis exprest  May give a Title to the Lands possest  But that the Longest Sword shou'd be so Civil  To make a  Frenchman English  that's the Devil  To Answer that Question it is not the Blood makes an  Englishman  but the Climate and it's allow'd by the Civil Law that whatsoever Kingdom a Person is born in though of Foreign Parents he is actually at the time of his Birth a Denizon of it  These are the Heroes that despise the  Dutch  And rail at newcome Foreigners so much  Forgetting that themselves are all deriv'd  From the most Scoundrel Race that ever liv'd  A horrid Medly of Thieves and Drones  Who ransack'd Kingdoms and dispeopl'd Towns  The  Pict  and Painted  Britain  Treach'rous  Scot  By Hunger Theft and Rapine hither brought  Norwegian  Pirates Buccaneering  Danes  Whose Redhair'd Offspring ev'ry where remains  Who joyn'd with  NormanFrench  compound the Breed  From whence your  Trueborn Englishmen  proceed  We have no aversion for 'em as they are  Dutchmen  but as they are possessed of Places of Trust the Natives of the same Country might reasonably expect to have And whatever our Primitive Original was the Blood which gave us Being having issued through so many Channels might in length of time purge it self off and 'tis known by experience the most unclean things imaginable thrown into a running stream leave no infection behind them which makes  against him if he allows the Circulation of the Blood which I believe notwithstanding all his Equivocations he cannot deny  And lest by Length of Time it be pretended  The Climate may this Modern Breed ha' mended  Wise Providence to keep us where we are  Mixes us daily with exceeding Care  We have been  Europe  's Sink the  Jakes  where she  Voids all her Offal Outcast Progeny  From our Fifth  Henry  's time the Strolling Bands  Of banish'd Fugitives from Neighb'ring Lands  Have here a certain Sanctuary found  The Eternal Refuge of the Vagabond  Wherein but half a common Age of Time  Borr'wing new Blood and Manners from the Clime  Proudly they learn all Mankind to Contemn  And all their Race are  TrueBorn Englishmen    Here he seems to be apprehensive of the Argument that was made use of against his last and to fence it off guards himself with a known untruth  Henry  the Fifth a Prince of the greatest Honour imaginable after his Accession to the Throne is made to countenance Vagabonds and banish'd Fugitives when there are many instances to the contrary if he will take the trouble upon him to read his Life But were it actually as he would have it it was always reckon'd no small Reputation for a Kingdom to be a Sanctuary to the Distressed and a Refuge to poor People who possibly might have other reasons for flying from the Land of their Nativity than the Crimes he seems to charge 'em with  Dutch Walloons Flemings Irishmen  and  Scots  Vaudois  and  Valtolins  and  Hugonots  In good Queen  Bess  's Charitable Reign  Supply'd us with Three hundred thousand Men  Religion  God we thank thee  sent them hither  Priests Protestants the Devil and all together  Of all Professions and of ev'ry Trade  All that were persecuted or afraid  Whether for Debt or other Crimes they fled  David  at  Hackelah  was still their Head  This Paragraph being much of the same nature with the former and written to reproach the Memory of the best of Queens after he had too hastily  shot his Bolt  against the most Glorious of our Kings I shall jump over the  repeated Crambe  he tires the Reader with to take notice of his expression  God we thank thee  Full of as much Impiety as could come from an Atheist's Mouth and one who denies all manner of reveal'd Religion He could have utter'd forth no worse complaints against the Goodness of that infinite Being had he said  God you are only to be blam'd for putting such Whims in the Fools as the Notions of Religion and instilling into their empty Skulls the Fears of offending an incensed Deity which has forced them to quit their own Country and lie a Rentcharge on our Hands  Which is downright Blasphemy or nothing can deserve that Name  The Offspring of this Miscellaneous Crowd  Had not their new Plantations long enjoy'd  But they grew  Englishmen  and rais'd their Votes  At Foreign Shoals of  Interloping Scots    The  King  Jam    Royal Branch from  Pictland  did succeed  With Troops of  Scots  and Scabs from  NorthbyTweed  The Seven first Years of his Pacifick Reign  Made him and half his Nation  Englishmen    Scots  from the  Northern  Frozen Banks of  Tay  With Packs and Plods came  Whigging  all away  Thick as the Locusts which in  Aegypt  swarm'd  With Pride and hungry Hopes compleatly arm'd  With Native Truth Diseases and No Money  Plunder'd our  Canaan  of the Milk and Honey  Here they grew quickly Lords and Gentlemen  And all their Race are  TrueBornEnglishmen    And what could hinder them from deserving the Name if they were born in  England  Since they were obliged to perform all the Offices of trueborn  Englishmen  where is the hurt to give them the Title of such K  James  the II was an excellent Prince and his Subjects were truly happy under his Reign which he by way of ridicule calls Pacifick And we cannot deny but several Families of  Scots  came with him into  England  but it's worth his Observation to take notice that his chiefest  Favourite  was an  Englishman  notwithstanding his Affection to his own Nation  The Civil Wars the common Purgative  Which always use to make the Nation thrive  Made way for all that strolling Congregation  Which throng'd in  King  Cha  II  Pious  Chs  's Restauration  The  Royal Refugee  our Breed restores  With  Foreign Courtiers  and with  Foreign Whores  And carefully repeopled us again  Throught his Lazy Long Lascivious Reign  With such a blest and Trueborn  English  Fry  As much illustrates our Nobility  A Gratitude which will so black appear  As future Ages must abhor to hear  When they look back on all that Crimson Flood  Which stream'd in  Lindsey  's and  Caernarvon  's Blood  Bold  Strafford Cambridge Capel Lucas Lisle  Who crown'd in Death his Father's Fun'ral Pile  The Loss of whom in order to supply  With TrueBorn  English  Nobility  Six Bastard Dukes survive his Luscious Reign  The Labours of  Italian Cn  French Ph Tabby St  and  Cambrian  Besides the Num'rous Bright and Virgin Throng  Whose Female Glories shade them from my Song  It's but an odd sort of an Observation that Countries  thrive by Civil Wars  since it is evident that where the Seat of a War is the Trade of that People is at a stand and had not that injur'd Prince whom he for want of due respect to his Memory brands with the Name of a  Refugee  been forc'd by Rebellious Subjects from the Land of his Inheritance he would have had no Obligations to return to Foreign Courts But a Party which our Author glories in being a Member of having been the occasion of his Exile we may thank them if he was withdrawn from a due Exercise of those admirable Parts he was the happy Master of and when he was Possessor of a Genius the fittest that could be for business that he gave himself up too much to his Pleasures The same reason that perswaded him to a due respect of His late Majesty's Natural Daughters might have with held him from abusing his Princely Sons some of which have been  and are a Pattern of true behaviour to the  English  Court But where Manners are not they cannot be expected  This Offspring if one Age they multiply  May half the House with  English  Peers supply  There with true  English  Pride they may contemn  Sg  and  Pd  newmade Noblemen  If we had no worse sort of Gentlemen amongst our  English  Nobility we need not care how many we had of the Breed no disparagement to  Sg  and  Pd  his new made Noblemen  French  Cooks  Scotch  Pedlars and  Italian  Whores  Were all made Lords or Lords Progenitors  Beggars and Bastards by his new Creation  Much multiply'd the Peerage of the Nation  Who will be all e'er one short Age runs o'er  As TrueBorn Lords as those we had before  These six Lines should have been explain'd if he would have any Body know the meaning of them For I am well assured no  French  Cooks or  Scotch  Pedlars were ever made Noblemen in the King's Reign whose Ashes he disturbs so basely And for the  Italian  Whores he makes mention of they might possibly have been made  Ladies  though I never heard the Dutchess of  Mazarine  had any  English  Title conferr'd on her But if he is not abandon'd to the want of Sense as well as good Manners he must agree with me their Sex would not permit them to be made  Lords    Then to recruit the Commons he prepares  And heal the latent Breaches of the Wars  The Pious Purpose better to advance  H' invites the banish'd Protestants of  France    Hither for God's sake and their own they fled  Some for Religion came and some for Bread  Two hundred thousand Pair of Wooden Shooes  Who God be thank'd had nothing left to lose  To Heav'n's great Praise did for Religion fly  To make us starve our Poor in Charity  In ev'ry Port they plant their fruitful Train  To get a Race of  TrueBorn Englishmen  Whose Children will when riper Years they see  Be as Illnatur'd and as Proud as we  Call themselves  English  Foreigners despise  Be surly like us all and just as wise  Had our Author any sense of Shame or Christianity in him he would never blame a Prince for an Action that has rendred his Name Famous in all the Courts of  Europe  When the Professors of Christ's Holy Gospel were expell'd from the Place of their Nativity he receiv'd them  Omnium egenos Ʋrbe domo Daeos  And more than imitated the Queen of  Carthage  's Noble Saying of  Non ignora mali miseris succurrere disco  He had been hospitably dealt with himself by the same People whose Prince's persecuting Genius flung them upon his Protection and if there had been Two Millions instead of Two Hundred Thousand his Name ought to be had in Everlasting Remembrance since to Feed the Hungry and Cloth the Naked is so far from the Transgression of a Duty that it is an actual Performance of our Saviour's Command  Thus from a Mixture of all Kinds began  That Het'rogeneous Thing  An Englishman  In eager Rapes and furious Lust begot  Betwixt a Painted  Britain  and a  Scot    Whose gend'ring Offspring quickly learnt to bow  And yoke their Heifers to the  Roman  Plough  From whence a Mongrel halfbred Race there came  With neither Name nor Nation Speech or Fame  Infus'd betwixt a  Saxon  and a  Dane    While their Rank Daughters to their Parents just  Receiv'd all Nations with Promiscuous Lust  This Nauseous Brood directly did contain  The wellextracted Blood of  Englishmen    The word  thus  seems to intimate we  Englishmen  had our Original from the  French  Refugees who have been admitted into the Kingdom these last thirty Years for no Persecution began in  Charles  the Second's Reign before But the Poet being not very good at Connexion and unsatisfy'd with abusing us in the same Nature before falls again into the very same malicious Account of our Primitive Rise on purpose to whet our Memory and stamp impressions on it of his great Civilities that we might think of suitable returns  Which Medly canton'd in a Heptarchy  A Rhapsody of Nations to supply  Among themselves maintain'd eternal Wars  And still the Ladies lov'd the Conquerors  It seems there were  Ladies  in the time of the  Heptarchy  though he allows of no such things as  Lords  before  William the Conqueror  but though  he seems to have a respect for the Fair Sex by the Title he gives 'em he deserves to lose much of their esteem if he ever had any of it for the Character he gave the Women in those Times of being  Mercenary  and in Love with the  strongest side    The  WesternAngles  all the rest subdu'd  A bloody Nation barbarous and rude  Who by the Tenure of the Sword possest  One part of  Britain  and subdu'd the rest  And as great things denominate the small  The Conqu'ring Part gave Title to the Whole  The  Scot Pict Britain Dane  submit  And with the  EnglishSaxon  all unite  And these the Mixture have so close pursu'd  The very Name and Memory's subdu'd  No  Roman  now no  Britain  does remain  Wales  strove to separate but strove in vain  The silent Nations undistingush'd fall  And  Englishman  's the common Name for all  Fate jumbl'd them together  God knows how  Whate'er they were they're  TrueBorn English  now  We have had as much before in good honest Prose which has more Beauties in it than his lamentable Verse that the  WesternAngles  Conquer'd the rest but the Parts which were Conquer'd as the  EastAngles  c help'd to give the whole Country the Name of  England  as well as that which had subdued 'em Which shews the Poet lies under a mistake and is guilty of some escapes in matters of History But what deserves our notice more particularly is his making the Conquerors who were Inhabitants of the Western Parts  Bloudy Barbarous    and  Rude  when 'tis apparent in our Chronicles those of the North were the most Cruel on purpose to taint the Nation in general which had submitted to the Conquest of those  Inhumane  People with the said Vices  The Wonder which remains is at our Pride  To value that which all wise Men deride  For  Englishmen  to boast of Generation  Cancels their Knowledge and lampoons the Nation  A  TrueBorn Englishman  's a Contradiction  In Speech an Irony in Fact a Fiction  A Banter made to be a Test of Fools  Which those that use it justly ridicules  A Metaphor invented to express  A Man  akin  to all the Ʋniverse  Pride  was wholly attributed to the  Spaniards  sometime before but now 'tis the property of the  English  Either his Memory is very treacherous or he has been so lavish of the Vices he has charg'd us with that he is forc'd to have recourse to those he has flung upon others because of the lowness of his Stock And if we are  akin to all the Ʋniverse  we have a multitude of Noble Relations for certain which renders us above the  common dregs of all Mankind  without any manner of Question  For as the  Scots  as Learned Men ha' said  Throughout the World their Wandring Seed ha' spread  So openhanded  England  'tis believ'd  Has all the Gleaning of the World receiv'd  The Travelling of the  Scots  is an Argument of their enquiries after Knowledge a Vertue for  which they are unreproachable therefore our Author does very ill to make use of  Cleaveland's  Word Wandring  unless he had been gifted with  Cleaveland's  Wit  But how he can prove that  England  has receiv'd all the Gleanings of the World unless he can make appear we had any Forefathers from  Japan  and  China  I can't imagine  Some think of  England  'twas our Saviour meant  The Gospel should to all the World be sent  Since when the blessed Sound did hither reach  They to all Nations might be said to Preach  Though he pretends to make out our Original he's more than Presumptious to explain our Saviour's Doctine after that manner I am apt to think those are no ones Sentiments but his own and notwithstanding the dangerous Opinion he has of no such Person in the Blessed Trinity no Man that has the Name of a Christian but will conclude that Christ's Predictions will be fullfill'd without any such mean Evasion as he impiously lays hold on  'Tis well that Vertue gives Nobility  Else God knows where we had our Gentry  Since scarce one Family is left alive  Which does not from some Foreigner derive  Of Sixty thousand  English  Gentlemen  Whose Names and Arms in Registers remain  We challenge all our Heralds to declare  Ten Families which  EnglishSaxons  are  'Tis well to use his own words he will acknowledge any such thing as Vertue to be amongst  us It's a Condescension he has not before been guilty of and if we have Sixty Thousand  English  Gentlemen it's no Matter whether they are deriv'd from the  Saxons  or no since we had People that have Conquer'd us of as great Antiquity as them  France  justly boasts the Ancient Noble Line  Of  Bourbon Mommorency  and  Lorrain  The  Germans  too the House of  Austria  show  And  Holland  their Invincible  Nassau    Lines which in Heraldry were Ancient grown  Before the Name of  Englishman  was known  Even  Scotland  too her Elder Glory shows  Her  Gourdons Hamiltons  and her  Monroes  Dowglas Mackays  and  Grahams  Names well known  Long before Ancient  England  knew her own  France  and both the  Germany's High  and  Low  have chang'd their Masters as often as us and though they have great swelling Names some of our Families may be no more obscure than theirs since we have the same Reasons to boast of their Antiquity And our Poetaster had paid ne'er the less Difference to the  Invincible Nassau  had he plac'd his GrandFathers Family  viz  that of the  Stewarts  which is the most Ancient in  Scotland  before that of  Monroe  which I never heard was Famous for any Member of it but one Mr  Monroe  who is a  celebrated Tobaconist    But  England  Modern to the last degree  Borrows or makes her own Nobility  And yet she boldly boasts of Pedigree  Repines that Foreigners are put upon her  And talks of her Antiquity and Honour  Her  Slls Sls Cls De Mrs  Mns  and  Mues Ds  and  Vrs  Not one have  English  Names yet all are  English  Your  Hns Pllons  and  Lliers  Pass now for TrueBorn  English  Knights and Squires Peers  And make good SenateMembers or LordMayors  Wealth howsoever got in  England  makes  Lords of Mechanicks Gentlemen of Rakes  Antiquity and Birth are needless here  'Tis Impudence and Money makes a Pr  The Names may be  French  on Account of the  Norman  Invasion but it's the Title that makes the Nobleman which cannot be said to be borrow'd If the Kings of  England  could not make their own Peers they would have less Prerogative than the meanest Soveraign Princes who have a Right to multiply the number of 'em as they please and if  Impudence and Money make a Peer  in these Days he has made a pretty sort of a Complement to His present Majesty whom we shall find he has Written a most Bombast Harangue in Verse upon and been after his laudable Custom exceeding Civil to the Duke and Earl whom he would have preferable to King  Charles  the Second's Sons  Innumerable CityKnights we know  From  Blewcoat Hospitals  and  Bridewell  flow  Draymen and Porters fill the City Chair  And Footboys Magisterial Purple wear  Fate has but very small Dictinction set  Betwixt the  Counter  and the Coronet  Tarpaulin Lords Pages of High Renown  Rise up by Poor Men's Valour not their own  Great Families of yesterday we show  And Lords whose Parents were  the Lord knows who    It's a sign when People rise in the World and make a Figure from small Beginnings Industry has had a great hand in their Promotion and when People of indifferent Circumstances are advanc'd to Honour there is an encouragement of Vertue going forward The Common Seaman's Labours may do much towards the gaining a Naval Victory but it is the Admiral's Conduct that brings it to pass and though  English  Pages for their Bravery at Sea are made Lords it is not a thing to be wondered at since a certain Gentleman belonging to a Nation he's so fond of has had more than the same Honour done him for  none  of those Performances  PART II  THE Breed's describ'd Now  Satyr  if you can  Their Temper show for  Manners makes the Man    Fierce as the  Britain  as the  Roman  Brave  And less inclin'd to Conquer than to Save  Eager to Fight and lavish of their Blood  And equally of  Fear  and  Forecast  void  The  Pict  has made 'em Sowre the  Dane  Morose  False from the  Scot  and from the  Norman  worse  What Honesty they have the  Saxon  gave them  And That now they grow old begins to leave them  The Climate makes them Terrible and Bold  And  English  Beef their Courage does uphold  No Danger can their  Daring  Spirit pall  Always provided  that their Belly's full  This Paragraph makes our Author look like a  Roman  himself though he will allow none of us to be any thing like them when they have left their Brood behind them without doubt as well as any of our other Conquerors and he seems like  Janus  to carry his Head two ways One while he commends us for our Valour another rails against us for our Falshood He names the Nations that bequeathed us the Vices he makes mention of and for our Stock of Honesty because he would make it as small as he could the  Saxons  forsooth above all other People must be our Benefactors in leaving us that A valuable sort of Gift indeed when according to his Challenge out of Families ten of them had not so much as a drop of their Blood in them  In close Intriegues their Faculty's but weak  For gen'rally whate'er they know they speak  And often their own Councils undermine  By their Infirmity and not Design  From whence the Learned say it does proceed  That  English  Treasons never can succeed  For they're so openhearted you may know  Their own most secret Thoughts and others too  If the  English  betray the Secrets that are committed to them by  Infirmity  not by any  Design  it's as plain as the Nose in his Face they are  Honest  which contradicts the Character he gave of them in the foregoing Paragraph And as that  implies a contradiction to  Sense  so the Character he gives them of having Faculties too weak for Intriegues is a downright contradiction to  Truth  since we have Statesmen now in being and  Englishmen  too not inferiour to the  Richlieu  's and  Mazarine  's of  France  or to any hard Names whatsoever the  Dutch  are distinguish'd by And it's beyond all manner of doubt certainly true that the last might have been glad to have got back to the  Texel  again had not some  Wise  Gentlemen that lived near the Names laid their Heads together in order to forward the  Happy  Revolution they boast of  The Lab'ring Poor in spight of Double Pay  Are Sawcy Mutinous and Beggarly  So lavish of their Money and their Time  That want of Forecast is the Nation's Crime  Good Drunken Company is their Delight  And what they get by Day they spend by Night  Dull Thinking seldom does their Heads engage  But Drink their Youth away and hurry on Old Age  Empty of all good Husbandry and Sense  And void of Manners most when void of Pence  Their strong Aversion to Behaviour's such  They always talk too little or too much  So dull they never take the pains to think  And seldom are goodnatur'd  but in Drink    He's  Almanzor  like for killing all and making a compleat Victory over the whole  English  Race The Nobility and Gentry have had a Tast of his Fury and he'll be impartial and fall upon the Poor also when if they were so  lavish of their Money and Time  as he would perswade us they are few of'em would come to wear  Gold Chains    which he blames them for or shew their Charity in  Magisterial Purple  which has been such a Mortification to him and if they had not  given themselves Time to think  they would never have arriv'd at  In  English  Ale their dear Enjoyment lies  For which they'll starve themselves and Families  An  Englishman  will fairly drink as much  As will maintain Two Families of  Dutch    Subjecting all their Labours to the Pots  The greatest Artists are the greatest Sots  I never heard but the  Dutch  were as good Tosspots as our selves though he would have us believe  one  Englishman  can drink as much as will maintain two Families of 'em  However he has made amends for that known  Lye  by giving his Assent to a known  Truth  which is that we are more dext'rous at Business than them and are the  greatest Artists  by consequence since he has the ill manners to call us  the greatest Sots    The Country Poor do by Example live  The Gentry Lead them and the Clergy drive  What may we not from such Examples hope  The Landlord is their God the Priest their Pope  A Drunken Clergy and a Swearing Bench  Has giv'n the Reformation such a Drench  As Wise Men think there is some cause to doubt  Will purge Good Manners and Religion out  The way to abolish Religion which has been the main design of our Author is to make the Clergy look little in the Eyes of the Laity and he has laid hold of effectual means to further his  intentions nothing being more capable to draw the People from the respect which is due to them so much as the imputation of Drunkenness unless they open their Eyes and examine into the Character of him that charges them with it But God be thank'd we have the soberest Clergy in the World our Ministers are Men of exemplary Lives as well as great Learning and our Gentry's Tenants are so far from standing in such a reverential Awe of their Landlords that they are Gentlemen themselves in respect of the Boors beyond Sea  Nor do the Poor alone their Liquor prize  The Sages joyn in this great Sacrifice  The Learned Men who study  Aristotle  Correct him with an ExplanationBottle  Praise  Epicurus  rather than  Lysander  And  The Drunkards Name for Canary  Aristippus  more than  Alexander    The Doctors too their  Galen  here resign  And gen'rally prescribe  Specifick Wine    The Graduates Study's grown an easier Task  While for the  Urinal  they toss the  Flask    The Surgeons Art grows plainer ev'ry Hour  And Wine's the Balm which into Wounds they pour  The reason he has for pecking at our Universities is because the ViceChancellor of one of them civilly desired him to withdraw himself from it for fear of his corrupting young GentlemenStudent's Morals which he had an excellent Talent at otherwise common Justice would have forced him to own there are the most excellent Scholars in them which are to be found in any place of Learning throughout  all  Europe  and the Statutes are so regularly put in force against all manner of Licentiousness that he has no manner of excuse for the Scandal he charges them with  English  Physicians also are Men of the best Reputation in that Faculty throughout the whole Universe And to speak against our Practitioners dexterity in Chirurgery is to give the lye to demonstration and vent a known  falshood  in the room of that which is  true    Poets long since  Parnassus  have forsaken  And say the Ancient Bards were all mistaken  Apollo  's lately abdicate and fled  And good King  Bacchus  reigneth in his stead  He does the Chaos of the Head refine  And Atomthoughts jump into Words by Wine  The Inspiration's of a finer Nature  As Wine must needs excel  Parnassus  Water  One may perceive by his hungry insipid Lines he's a Freshwater Poet and that Wine is very far from having any such thing as Inspiration in it if he makes use of it that is for certain  Apollo  would abdicate if he was in danger of having good Sense and Verse murder'd by the rest of his Subjects as he has done and  Helicon  would be soon drunk up were the rest of the Fraternity troubled so much with the  Heartburning  as he is But your Man of Verse knows better that would acquire Fame by his Writings and to perpetuate his Memory like one of his Predecessors always goes  Bene Potus ad Arma    Statesmen their weighty Politicks refine  And Soldiers raise their Courages by Wine  Caecilia  gives her Choristers their Choice  And lets them all drink Wine to clear the Voice  As for our Statesmen without Question the making their Heads  hot  is not the way to make their Thoughts sedate and cool and it's evident from the success of their Counsels our Author is no great Politician himself It's apparent also he's no Songster since he understands the Customs of SingingMen so little as to make them drink when Liquors are the most Pernicious things to a good Voice and the likeliest imaginable to take their livelihood from 'em  Some think the Clergy first found out the way  And Wine's the only Spirit by which they Pray  But other less prophane than so agree  It clears the Lungs and helps the Memory  And therefore all of them Divinely think  Instead of Study 'tis as well to drink  For certain he's not one of the  less prophane  by the wicked Expressions that come from him And seems to agree with the Belief of the Jews who said the Apostles were drunk with New Wine when they declaring the Message of the most High God So that the Reader may find what Sect he belongs to since he is against the Response of  with thy Spirit let us pray    And here I would be very glad to know  Whether our  Asgilites  may drink or no  Th' Enlight'ning Fumes of Wine would certainly  Assist them much  when they begin to fly  Or if a FieryChariot shou'd appear  Inflam'd by Wine they'd ha' the less to fear  He's resolv'd to pull every Body in by the Neck and Shoulders and Mr  Asgil  is maul'd off next for his notion of  Translation  but in such a manner that any Man would deserve the Name of a Wise one that could find out where the Satyr Bit He asks a Question and answers it himself for if it would give Wings to  Asgel  's Disciples and guard 'em from the  Fear of Death  without doubt Mr  Asgil  would not forbid 'em the use of a Liquor which would be very instrumental in forwarding their Translation  Even the Gods themselves as Mortals say  Were they on Earth wou'd be as drunk as they  Nectar  would be no more Celestial Drink  They'd all take Wine to teach them how to Think  But  English  Drunkards Gods and Men outdo  Drink their Estates away and Senses too  Colon  's in Debt and if his Friends should fail  To help him out must die at last in Gaol  His  Wealthy Uncle  sent a Hundred Nobles  To pay his Trifles off and rid him of his Troubles  But  Colon  like a  TrueBorn Englishman  Drank all the Money out in bright Champaign  And  Colon  does in Custody remain  Drunk'ness has been the Darling of the Realm  E'er since a Drunken Pilot had the Helm  What he brings the Gods in for is a secret to me unless he would shew he has read Poetry though he is Master of none of the Beauties of it And whom he means by  Colon  I can't tell but if it be any particular Person he points his  harmless  Satyr at it is foreign to the purpose  since he designs it as a Reflection against the  English  in general For though there may be a  Colon  or two or many more in the Nation he has no Authority to infer from thence that Drunkenness is the darling Vice in it or to shew the Partiality of his Spleen if it were so by dating it from the Reign of a Prince whom he had before rendred infamous for a Vice which is not consistent with it  In their Religion they are so unev'n  That each Man goes  his own Byway to Heav'n  Tenacious of Mistakes to that degree  That ev'ry Man pursues it sep'rately  And fancies none can find the Way but he  So shy of one another they are grown  As if they strove to get to Heav'n alone  Rigid and Zealous Positive and Grave  And ev'ry Grace but Charity they have  This makes them so Illnatur'd and Ʋncivil  That all Men think an  Englishman  the Devil  Any one may perceive he's for voting an Act of  Comprehension  and that he would all have the the straggling Sects whatsoever enjoy the same Privileges with those that are actually in common with the Establish'd Church though by his saying they are  tenacious of mistakes  he seems to conclude every different sort of Religion Practic'd in these Realms is  false  and none but the phantastical Schemes he proposes to us as Matters of Faith  true    Surly to Strangers Froward to their Friend  Submit to Love with a reluctant Mind  Resolv'd to be ungrateful and unkind  If by Necessity reduc'd to ask  The Giver has the difficultest Task  For what's bestow'd they awkwardly receive  And always Take less freely than they Give  The Obligation is their highest Grief  And never love where they accept Relief  So sullen in their Sorrows that 'tis known  They'll rather die than their Afflictions own  And if reliev'd it is too often true  That they'll abuse their Benefactors too  For in Distress their Haughty Stomach's such  They hate to see themselves oblig'd too much  Seldom contented often in the wrong  Hard to be pleas'd at all and never long  As for the Character he gives us in the beginning of this Paragraph it's so inconsistent with an  English  Temper that he needs nothing but his own Words to refute him  and if we take less freely than we give  it's a plain Argument against that lowness of Birth he would tax us with and shews our Generosity to be such that we take more Pleasure in having our own Beneficences accepted than to give our acceptance of those of others Which is so far from any thing that tends to our disparagement that it is a Vertue we ought to be priz'd above our Neighbours for and an Excellence of that uncommon Nature that makes us Superior to the rest of those Nations that People the World  If your Mistakes their Ill Opinion gain  No Merit can their Favour reobtain  And if they're not Vindictive in their Fury  'Tis their unconstant Temper does secure ye  Their Brain's so cool their Passion seldom burns  For all's condens'd before the Flame returns  The Fermentation's of so weak a Matter  The Humid damps the Fume and runs it all to Water  So though the Inclination may be strong  They're pleas'd by Fits and never angry long  If we are  inconstant in our Temper  we should certainly by the frequent changes it is guilty of sometime or other fall into a  Vindictive  Fury and resent Affronts which are put upon us but if we are such Strangers to Passion what amurrain is become of the  Danish Fury  and the  Porteguese Rage  which he not long since said had such an Ascendant over us And for the  Humid  to  damp the Fume  he might have as well said one moist thing adds moistness to another which proceeds from no Antipathy of one different Quality to another as he ignorantly would have it  Then if Good Nature shows some slender proof  They never think they have Reward enough  But like our  Modern Quakers  of the Town  Expect your Manners and return you none  The last Distich agrees very little with the first and I find he's overhappy in making Similitudes for if we are the Benefactors which he call's  a slender Proof of good Nature  it's our Business to  receive  acknowledgments and not  return  'em before any such thing is paid us  Friendship  th' abstracted Ʋnion of the Mind  Which all Men seek but very few can find  Of all the Nations in the Ʋniverse  None talk on't more or understand it less  For if it does their Property annoy  Their Property their Friendship will destroy  As I take it Friendship is the Union of two distinct Minds and not of one neither is it an  Abstract  of Agreement which is a sort of an Epitome of Happiness but an  entire perfect  and  compleat  Enjoyment betwixt one Soul and another And if we were so unhappy as to deserve the Character he gives since very few Nations are Masters of this Friendship we have this comfort as to have a great many Countries and amongst them perhaps his beloved  Dutchland  who share with us in the want of it  As you discourse them you shall hear them tell  All things in which they think they do excel  No Panegyrick needs their Praise record  An  Englishman  ne'er wants his own good Word  His first Discourses gen'rally appear  Prologu'd with his own wond  rous Character  When to illustrate his own good Name  He never fails his Neighbour to defame  And yet he really designs no wrong  His Malice goes no further than his Tongue  But pleas'd to Tattle he delights to Rail  To satisfie the Lech'ry of a Tale  His own dear Praises close the ample Speech  Tells you how Wise he is  that is how Rich  For Wealth is Wisdom he that's Rich is Wise  And all Men Learned Poverty despise  His Generosity comes next and then  Concludes that he's a  Trueborn Englishman  And they 'tis known are Generous and Free  Forgetting and Forgiving Injury  Which may be true thus rightly understood  Forgiving Ill Turns and Forgetting Good  Were our Author an  Englishman  as he would perswade us he is he would have contradicted himself in this point and been so far from giving himself his own good Word that he would have shewn he had pick'd out the worst he could find in the whole  English  Vocabulary But he is more partial than so and being of another Nation flings all the dirt that is possible upon us Tho' I dare swear he is in the wrong for charging our Rich Natives with boasting of their Riches since 'tis manifest there is no People in the Universe that are more cautious of having their Wealth known than the generality of Ours witness the Numbers in this Kingdom that are possessed of vast Sums and yet would have the World believe nothing like it As for our  forgiving Ill Turns  we thank him for the Character and take it for our own being in hopes he will apply that of  forgetting Good  to himself since he has been so unthankful for the Favours he has receiv'd here and so ungenerous as to return the Mercy of a Nation who might have handed him very severely for his impious Writings with so barbarous a Treatment  Chearful in Labour when they've undertook it  But out of Humour when they're out of Pocket  But if their Belly and their Pocket's full  They may be Phlegmatick but never Dull  And if a Bottle does their Brains refine  It makes their Wit as sparkling as their Wine  His Satyr now bears the countenance of Panegyrick and he has taken off the Scandal he before fastened on us of being a lazie People by  putting that of our being  chearful in Labour  in its room and if a  Bottle refines our Brains  and gives a spirituous influence to our  Wit  it very much makes against his side who has blamed us for diverting our selves over it  As for the general Vices which we find  They're guilty of in common with Mankind  Satyr  forbear and silently endure  We must conceal the Crimes we cannot cure  Nor shall my Verse the brighter Sex defame  For  English  Beauty will preserve her Name  Beyond dispute Agreeable and Fair  And Modester than other Nations are  For where the Vice prevails the great Temptation  Is want of Money more than Inclination  In general this only is allow'd  They're something Noisy and a little Proud  We have all manner of reason to thank him for his great condescension in being graciously pleas'd to shew his compassion in concealing our Vices after he has charged us with all the Devil could put in his Head and if he must not divulge the  crimes  he  cannot cure  he has already broke through that prohibition by making mention of so much as one single Fault since very few Patients will accept of a Cure where OldNick is known to be the Doctor As for the Ladies they are in his favour though I question whether he will be in theirs since to make them  Noisy  and  Proud  is enough to put them out of Humour  An  Englishman  is gentlest in Command  Obedience is a Stranger in the Land  Hardly subjected to the Magistrate  For  Englishmen  do all Subjection hate  Humblest when Rich but peevish when they're Poor  And think whate'er they have they merit more  If an  Englishman  is  gentle in Command  and does not curb in those who are put under him with too stiff a Rein he is certainly praiseworthy and is deservedly had in esteem But if  Obedience be a Stranger in the Land  how comes it about that His present Majesty is own'd as such throughout all the Three Kingdoms To be  humblest when rich  is also a certain token of an innate Goodness but to reconcile what follows with it is beyond my Ability since if their increase of Wealth is an increase of their Humility they can never be unsatisfied and think they merit more  Shamwhig  pretends t' ha' serv'd the Government  But baulk'd of due Reward turns Malecontent  For  English  Christians always have regard  To future Recompences of Reward  His forfeit Liberty they did restore  And gave him Bread which he had not before  But  Trueborn English Shamwig  lets them know  His Merit must not lie neglected so  As Proud as Poor his Masters he'll defy  And writes a  Piteous  Satyr in Praise of Folly and Knavery  Satyr  upon  Honesty    Some think the Poem had been pretty good  If he the Subject had but understood  He got Five Hundred Pence by this and more  As sure as he had ne'er a Groat before  To call  Tutchin  a  Shamwig  is directly to affirm he has not half the ill Qualities of a  Whig  as he would have him For my part I must own I think he has the particular Characteristic of that Rebellious and Whining Sect if a Murmuring Genius and an Unsatisfied Temper can point him out as a Member of so scandalous a Society But how two such Brothers in Iniquity who so directly  Tally  in every thing but their Opinion about Foreigners should fall out that's a Riddle to me Every Body knows  Tutchin  was deservedly order'd to be whip'd through the West Country MarketTowns and that he was set at Liberty and entertain'd by some People of no small note after the Revolution and how that he like a  True Whig  and Villain afterwards abus'd his Benefactors by writing a  Satyr in Praise of Folly and Knavery  incomparably better then his  TrueBorn Englishman  but I never could hear any Body say  Tutchin  was worse then  Td    In Bus'ness next some Friends of his employ'd him  And there he prov'd that Fame had not bely'd him  His Benefactors quickly he abus'd  And falsly to the Government accus'd  But they defended by their Innocence  Ruin'd the Traytor in their own Defence  This is also a Truth which he has pick'd out of the  Reverse  which was an Answer to the  Foreigners  and which as I take it intimates he had a Place given him at the VictuallingOffice but accusing the Commissioners before the Lords of the Admiralty and not able to make out what he charg'd 'em with he himself was divested of his  own Post By this the Author may perceive I am not so bad and so abandon'd to Wickededness as to be a Friend of  Tutchin  's neither have I so little Judgment as to have a good Opinion of the Person who rails at him  Thus kick'd about from Pillars unto Posts  He whets his Pen against the Lord of Hosts  Burlesques his God and King in Paltry Rhimes  Against the  Dutch  turns Champion for the Times  And Huffs the King upon that very score  On which he Panegyrick'd him before  It's natural for Men of both their Kidneys to change sides as occasion offers and if  Tutchin  's design in writing the Foreigners was only for the Good of his Nation he was far enough from Huffing the King who is an  English  Prince since he Reigns over us by taking part with the  English  who are the Subjects that have stood by him with their Lives and Fortunes and lost abundance of Treasure in his Defence when the  Dutch  have been Gainers by the War  Ʋnhappy  England  hast thou none but such  To plead thy Scoundrel Cause against the  Dutch  This moves their Scorn and not their Indignation  He that Lampoons the  Dutch  Burlesques the Nation  If  England  's be a  Scoundrel Cause  for God's sake what must that of  Holland  be And if we  move their scorn  it's our own Fault since we have had it in our power to  Command  their  Fear  and might have  Lampoon'd the Dutch  without  Burlesquing the Nation  had we been so wise as to have less dealings with 'em  The meanest  English  Ploughman Studies Law  And keeps thereby the Magistrates in Awe  Will boldly tell them what they ought to do  And sometimes punish their Omissions too  Certainly he has been in  Wales  or  Yorkshire  by the Character he gives the Ploughmen and the Gentlemen of the long Robe have no Reason to thank him for casting such a Reflection on the  Study of the Law  For their Part those are wise Magistrates indeed that are kept in awe by 'em and for mine I have never heard of any such but one CityJustice and he has a  ShoeMaker  to read Law to him  Their Liberty and Property's so dear  They scorn their Laws or Governors to fear  So bugbear'd with the Name of Slavery  They can't submit to their own Liberty  Restraint from Ill is Freedom to the Wise  But  Englishmen  do all Restraint despise  Slaves to the Liquor Drudges to the Pots  The Mob are Statesmen and their Statesmen Sots  If he blames us for our Liberty and Property being dear to us he cannot be a Friend to the late Revolution which he would be taken for a Champion of and he would do well to explain his unintelligible Assertion of our not being able to submit to our own Liberty The next two Lines are applicable to no  Englishmen  but those of his own Persuasion and the Contents of 'em put in practice by no sort of Persons but those who are under a perpetual uneasiness and have the Impudence to call our  Statesmen Sots    which reflects upon the Wisdom of him that made choice of 'em  Their Governours they count such dangerous things  That 'tis their custom to affront their Kings  So jealous of the Power their Kings possess'd  They suffer neither Power nor Kings to rest  The Bad with Force they eagerly subdue  The Good with constant Clamours they pursue  And did King Jesus reign they'd murmur too  A discontented Nation and by far  Harder to rule in Times of Peace than War  Easily set together by the Ears  And full of causeless Jealousies and Fears  Apt to revolt and willing to rebel  And never are contented when they're well  No Government cou'd ever please them long  Cou'd tye their Hands or rectify their Tongue  In this to Ancient  Israel  well compar'd  Eternal Murmurs are among them heard  He goes on with the known Qualities of his own Sect and being seemingly asham'd of owning 'em himself flings 'em on those who have no manner of relation to 'em He acknowledges there are but too many of this Temper in this Kingdom and that Rebellion Dissatisfaction and the other Crimes he falsly Charges us with has a Multitude of Disciples ready to side with either of 'em But let us seek for the Fountain which gives Being to this Sea of Wickedness and which for other causes then the River  Nile  hides its Head and we shall soon find the source of those mischiefs that are our perpetual Disturbers is on that side which he is the ungrateful Defender of  It was but lately that they were opprest  Their Rights invaded and their Laws supprest  When nicely tender of their Liberty  Lord What a Noise they made of Slavery  In daily Tumults show'd their Discontent  Lampoon'd their King and mock  d his Government  And if in Arms they did not first appear  'Twas want of Force and not for want of Fear  In humbler Tone than  English  us  d to do  At Foreign Hands for Foreign Aid they sue  And where was the Harm to think our selves injur'd if we really were and to complain of Grievances if we had a just cause for it King  James  was led aside and we did not make our Addresses to the  Dutch  who treading in wrong Paths themselves could not set His Majesty in the right but sent our Remonstrances over to the Princess and Prince of  Orange  in order to let them know whose principal Concern it was that they had a Jealousie there was no fair Play going forward at the  English  Court They addressed them in no humbler Tone than was fitting to be made use of to Princes of their High Birth and invited their Highnesses to  England  not so much for want of Force but because it was necessary that the Persons whose Concern it was to examine into the P of  Wales  his Birth should be at the Head of them to countenance what otherwise would have born the Face of a Rebellion  William  the Great Successor of  Nassau  Their Prayers heard and their Oppressions saw  He saw and sav'd them God and Him they prais'd  To This their Thanks to That their Trophies rais'd  But glutted with their own Felicities  They soon their New Deliverer despise  Say all their Prayers back their Joy disown  Ʋnsing their Thanks and pull their Trophies down  Their Harp of Praise are on the Willows hung  For  Englishmen  are ne'er contented long  It is not our business to question what he says on His Majesty's part and he says nothing on the part of the People but what is true since they gave their Deliverer no other Thanks than those he deserv'd But it's the greatest of Falshoods to say  we  soon despis'd him when if any Sect of People were guilty of that piece of Ingratitude those that call themselves Dissenters are the Persons who are not satisfied of having a free Exercise of their Religion according to the Dictates of their Conscience but will murmur on till theirs is the Establish'd Faith and their Meetings have the same Royal Authority in their behalf as the Kirk of  Scotland  which I presume from His Majesty's great Knowledge of the Churchof  England  Loyalty will never come to pass  The Rev'rend Clergy too and who'd ha' thought  That they who had such Nonresistance taught  Should e'er to Arms against their Prince be brought  Who up to Heav'n did Regal Pow'r advance  Subjecting  English  Laws to Modes of  France    Twisting Religion so with Loyalty  As one cou'd never live and t'other dye  And yet no sooner did their Prince design  Their Glebes and Perquisites to undermine  But all their PassiveDoctrines laid aside  The Clergy their own Principles deny'd  Ʋnpreach'd their NonResisting Cant and pray'd  To Heav'n for Help and to the  Dutch  for Aid  The Church chim'd all her Doctrines back again  And PulpitChampions did the Cause maintain  Flew in the face of all their former Zeal  And NonResistance did at once repeal  NonResistance in Things that are lawful was the Doctrine of our Church and the greatest part of our Clergy preached up Passive Obedience only where their Prince did not violate the Rights of his Subjects A great number of them I am well assured would have suffered the greatest Extremities for the sake of their Religion though when the ChurchLands were called in question and the Possessors of them were likely to be forced from them then  Judgment began at the House of God  and a certain Timeserver who is in  his  Party's Interest and lives not a Mile from the  Temple  cut asunder the  Gordian  Knot which he had before made indissoluble which does not at all affect the Churchof  England  Loyalty since that fulsome Harangemaker is looked upon as one of its rotten Members  The  Rabbies  say it would be too prolix  To tye Religion up to Politicks  The Church's Safety is  Suprema Lex  And so by a new Figure of their own  Do all their former Doctrines disown  As Laws  Post Facto  in the Parliament  In urgent Cases having obtain'd Assent  But are as dangerous Presidents laid by  Made lawful only by Necessity  The  Safety of the Church  is the Preservation of the Laws and as the infringement of the Privileges of the one is a downright violation of the other so unless the Authority of Religion be kept up and the Ministers of God's Holy Ordinances had in Reverence the Statutes of the Kingdom will be but an ill Fence to restrain the Violence of Licentious Men who will break in upon the other Laws after they have destroy'd that which is their Fundamental  The Rev'rend Fathers then in Arms appear  And Men of God became the Men of War  The Nation  fir  d by them  to Arms apply  Assault their Antichristian Monarchy  To their due Channel all our Laws restore  And made things what they shou'd ha' been been before  But when they came to Fill the Vacant Throne  And the  Pale Priests  look'd back on what they had done  How  English  Liberty began to thrive  And Churchof  England  Loyalty outlive  How all their Persecuting Days were done  And their Deliv'rer plac'd upon the Throne  The Priests  as Priests are wont to do  turn'd Tail  They're  Englishmen  and  Nature will prevail    Now they deplore the Ruines they ha' made  And Murmur for the Master they Betray'd  Excuse those Crimes they cou'd not make him mend  And suffer for the Cause they can't defend  Pretend they'd not ha' carry'd things so high  And ProtoMartyrs make for Popery  The Reflection which he designs upon the Lord Bishop of  London  for none of our other Fathers in God took Arms on that occasion is of so little  force that his Lordship has nothing to fear from it His Lordship was suspended by an Ecclesiastical High Court which was unlawfully established was under apprehensions of suffering every day worse and worse and had every Misfortune to provide himself against that either a Subject or a Christian ought to stand in fear of and therefore is very much to be excused though I don't vindicate taking Arms against a Sovereign But the Priests whom he joins the Epithet of  Pale  to meaning the NonJurants are falsly traduced they gave no more Assistance to the then Prince of  Orange  than their Prayers for his Success and their continued Vows to the Almighty to crown an Undertaking for the sake of Religion with an happy Issue And notwithstanding they were Men of such tender Consciences as not to be led by any hopes of Gain to take Oaths to a Prince who was established in the Throne during the Life of the King they had sworn to I am well persuaded they are so far from turning Martyrs for Popery that no People whatsoever are more against that idolatrous Opinion than themselves  Had the Prince done as they design'd the thing  Ha' set the Clergy up  to rule the King  Taken  a Donative  for coming hither  And so ha' left their King and them together  We had say they been now a happy Nation  No doubt we had seen a Blessed Reformation  For Wise Men say  t's as dangerous a thing  A Ruling Priesthood as a Priestrid  King  And of all Plagues with which Mankind are curst  Ecclesiastick Tyranny's the worst  It was not only the  Priest's  thoughts that His present Majesty would have settled Affairs on their Ancient Establishment and been contented with the Glory of rescuing Three Nations from Propery and Slavery but his Majesty's own Intentions as may be seen in his Declaration in the year was agreeable to their thoughts till the Parliament was so importunate with him to accept the Three that he could not have refused them without leaving the People he had freed to the same dangers they were before exposed to  If all our former Grievances were feign'd  King  James  has been abus'd and we trepann'd  Bugbear'd with Popery and Power Despotick  Tyrannick Government and Leagues Exotick  The Revolution's a Phanatick Plot  W  a Tyrant  S  a Sot  A Factious Army and a Poyson'd Nation  Ʋnjustly forc'd King  James  's Abdication  No true Protestant I am perswaded believes our Grievances were feign'd but is heartily glad they are redress'd However though I have a greater Veneration for the Person and Merit of  W  than to say he's a Tynt I am ready to affirm one  S  as I know perhaps not the Person he means guilty of a greater Crime than Sottishness for betraying so kind a Master  But if he did the Subjects Rights invade  Then he was punish'd only not betray'd  And punishing of Kings is no such Crime  But  Englishmen  ha' done it many a time  I must needs acknowledge I don't understand the Doctrine of punishing Kings though the Murder of good King  Charles  has been such a Barbarous Instance of it that if Divine Punishment does not overtake the Authors of it certainly there is no Vengeance in store for the vilest Offenders  When Kings the Sword of Justice first lay down  They are no Kings though they possess the Crown  Titles are Shadows Crowns are empty things  The Good of Subjects is the End of Kings  To guide in War and to protect in Peace  Where Tyrants once commence the King's do cease  For Arbitrary Power's so strange a thing  It makes the  Tyrant  and unmakes the  King    If Kings by Foreign Priests and Armies reign  And Lawless Power against their Oaths maintain  Then Subjects must ha' reason to complain  If Oaths must bind us when our Kings do ill  To call in Foreign Aid is to rebel  By Force to circumscribe our Lawful Prince  Is wilful Treason in the largest sense  And they who once rebel most certainly  Their God and King and former Oaths defy  If we allow no MaleAdministration  Could cancel the Allegiance of the Nation  Let all our Learned  Sons of Levi  try  This Eccles'astick Riddle to unty  How they could make a Step to Call the Prince  And yet pretend to Oaths and Innocence  If I mistake not the two first Lines in this Paragraph are not clear from Exceptions for according to the rules of common sense whether a King reigns justly or unjustly he is nevertheless a King beyond all dispute while he sits upon the Throne But great Disputants are sometimes out in their Consequences therefore I shall skip over the rest of his Argument as what is heard every day over Coffee and Tea and examine into the last Verses which seem to bear all the strength of Reason he is capable of mustring up If we may call a Person to the Relief of a Kingdom without any design of presenting him with the Throne of it as certainly we may there is no question but the People who called him are innocent and free from the breach of their Oath to their then Sovereign since to take up Arms is one thing and to petition for Assistance to remove Priests and Evil Counsellours another  By th' first Address they made beyond the Seas  They're per  ur'd in the most intense Degrees  And without Scruple for the time to come  May swear to all the Kings in  Christendom    And truly did our Kings consider all  They'd never let the Clergy swear at all  Their Politick Allegiance they'd refuse  For Whores and Priests do never want excuse  Perjury is the Violation of an Oath taken after a serious and premeditated manner but to break an Oath of Allegiance to one King without swearing to another makes it impossible that the  Nonjuring  Clergy should fall under the  Censure of so notorious a piece of impiety However the whole Fraternity Swearers or Nonswearers are extraordinarily oblig'd to their good Friend Mr  Author  who makes them as ready if they are in the wrong to prove themselves in the right and as good at furnishing themselves with Excuses as a thoroughpaced Whore before a Magistrate or a venerable Hypocritical Bawd before one of the  Society for Reformation of Manners  A great token of the respect he has for God's Ministers  But if the  Mutual Contract  was dissolv'd  The Doubt's explain'd the Difficulty solv'd  That Kings when they descend to Tyranny  Dissolve the Bond and leave the Subjects free  The Government's ungirt when Justice dies  And Constitutions are NonEntities  It is impossible Justice should die while the Fountain of it is living The Chanels through which it passes may be choak'd up for a time but as long as there is wherewithal to feed it at the Springhead can never wholly be stop'd  The Nation's all a Mob there's no such thing  As Lords or Commons Parliament or King  A great promiscuous Crowd the Hydra lies  Till Laws revive and mutual Contract ties  A Chaos free to chuse for their own share  What Case of Government they please to wear  If to a King they do the Reins commit  All Men are bound in Conscience to submit  But then that King must by his Oath assent  To  Postulata  's of the Government  Which if he breaks be cuts off the Entail  And Power retreats to its Original  The design of this Paragraph is to shew that the Kingly Power is the Gift of the Subjects and that whenever a Prince fails in the Duty of his Office the People may recal their Gift and bestow the Crown on whom they please This Doctrine might do very well in  Poland  amongst the  Radziouskies  and  Potoskies  who are for an Elective Kingdom but never will suit with a Nation whose Kingdom has been Hereditary upwards of six hundred years and always went to the next Heir of course notwithstanding the defects of the King for the time being might occasion his Dethronement  This Doctrine has the Sanction of Assent  From Nature's Ʋniversal Parliament  The Voice of Nations and the Course of Things  Allow that Laws superior are to Kings  None but Delinquents would have Justice cease  Knaves rail at Laws as Soldiers rail at Peace  For Justice is the End of Government  As Reason is the Test of Argument  If Laws are superiour to Kings the  Creature  may pretend a Sovereignty over the  Creator  since they are the product of their Royal Assent and never capable of being put in Force without their approbation The Potsherd may as well say to the Potter Wherefore hast thou made me as the Law put a Question to the King and ask him Why hast thou done thus  No Man was ever yet so void of Sense  As to debate the Right of SelfDefence  A Principle so grafted in the Mind  With Nature born and does like Nature bind  Twisted with Reason and with Nature too  As neither one nor t'other can undo  SelfDefence  is acknowledg'd by Universal Consent for the Voice of Nature and enjoin'd by her Laws to be put in Practice that is upon any sudden Attack of an Enemy or any causeless Provocation that may be given us to take care of our selves But the Divine Law which is superior to it and commands us  not to lift up our Hand against the Lord's Anointed  prohibits us to call Rebellion  SelfDefence  and ev'n Humane Ordinance allows Kings to be the Head of their People and not liable to the Censure of those that are inferiour to 'em  Nor can this Right be less when National  Reason which governs one should govern all  Whate're the Dialect of Courts may tell  He that his Right demands can ne'er rebel  Which Right if 'tis by Governors deny'd  May be procur'd by Force or Foreign Aid  For  Tyranny  's a Nation's Term for Grief  As Folks cry  Fire  to hasten in Relief  And when the hated word is heard about  All Men shou'd come to help the People out  That would be pretty indeed and we should have a hopeful Nation of it should the same Reason or rather want of it which  governs him govern all  Every one would cry such a Post of  Honour was his Right and if the King should deny him the Grant of it Rebellion would be the next Word and every Fool would cry Fire on purpose to make his Neighbour as wise as himself  S  Serjeants  when a Pris'ner they've beset  Cry out  stop Thief  when all the Theft is Debt  Thus  England  groan'd  Britannia  's Voice was heard  And Great  Nassau  to rescue her appear'd  Call'd by the Ʋniversal Voice of Fate  God and the Peoples Legal Magistrate  Ye Heav'ns regard Almighty  Jove  look down  And view thy Injur'd Monarch on the Throne  On their Ʋngrateful Heads due Vengeance take  Who sought his Aid and then his part forsake  Witness ye Powers It was Our Call alone  Which now our Pride makes us asham'd to own  Britannia  's Troubles fetch'd him from afar  To court the dreadful Casualties of War  But where Requital never can be made  Acknowledgment's a Tribute seldom paid  That is as much as to say after his own way of expressing himself  England  cry'd Fire  and a Neighbour came in an instant and quench'd it and receiv'd the House and all the Furniture for his Pairs Not that I would detract from the Debt of Gratitude which will be ever due to His Majesty but I Question not but His Majesty holds himself contented with the large Acknowledgments of both Houses of Parliament Since  per Annum  more than the Crown Revenue is a Gift never given to any Prince before though this Impudent Author in defrance of the  Donors calls down for Vengeance on their ungrateful Heads  He dwelt in Bright  Maria  's Circling Arms  Defended by the Magick of her Charms  From Foreign Fears and from Domestick Harms  Ambition found no Fuel for her Fire  He had what God cou'd give or Man desire  Till  Pity  z'd him from his soft Repose  His Life to unseen Hazards to expose  Till  Pity  mov'd him in our Cause t' appear  Pity  That Word which now we hate to hear  But  English  Gratitude is always such  To hate the Hand which does oblige too much  No Body doubts but the late Queen of Blessed Memory was an inestimable Present to His Majesty but to say he  had all that God could give  in the Possession of Her was to set Bounds to the Power of the Deity and say unto the Almighty Hither couldst thou go and no farther A thought too big for him that made use of it and too little for that Infinite Being for whom he made use of it  Britannia  's Cries gave Birth to his Intent  And hardly gain'd his unforeseen Assent  His boding Thoughts foretold him he should find  The People Fickle Selfish and Ʋnkind  Which Thought did to his Royal Heart appear  More dreadful than the Dangers of the War  For nothing grates a Generous Mind so soon  As base Returns for hearty Service done  I don't believe His present Majesty's Assent was so unforeseen as our Author would have it  neither can it enter into my thoughts that his Majesty's thoughts foretold to him that we are a  fickle selfish  and  unkind  sort of People since his Majesty would not have thought it worth his while to accept of the Government of a Kingdom he foresaw he should be uneasie in or yield to the repeated desires of such Petitioners as would be unthankful for the Grant of their Request  Satyr be silent  awfully prepare  Britannia  's Song and  William  's Praise to hear  Stand by and let her chearfully rehearse  Her Grateful Vows in

Honour furl'd  Rises like the Great Genius of the World  By Pate and Fame wisely prepar'd to be  The Soul of War and Life of Victory  He spreads the Wings of Vertue on the Throne  And ev'ry  Wind of Glory  fans them on  Immortal Trophies dwell upon his Brow  Fresh as the Garlands he has worn but now  Sweet  The Sails of Honour furl'd  shews a vast reach of Thought and an exuberancy of Fancy though I know the meaning of it no more than him that wrote it But they are Words and that's enough for it's uncivil to expect more when he is made up of nothing else  Fans them on  too is a very elegant Expression though he does our Great and Good King very little Service by the Wind he raises for him  By different Steps the high Ascent he gains  And differently that high Ascent maintains  Prime for Pride and  Lust of Rule  make War  And struggle for the Name of Conqueror  Some fight for Fame and some for Victory  He Fights to Save and Conquers to set Free  All this is to be confessed and that's a Madman who will not own it though I believe His Majesty has those Heroick Vertues in him as to love the Name of a Conqueror at the same time that he sets us  Free  since none but a Conqueror can deserve that Glorious Appellation  Then seek no Phrase his Titles to conceal  And bide with Words what Actions must reveal  No Parallel from  Hebrew  Stories take  Of Godlike Kings my Similies to make  No borrow'd Names conceal my living Theam  But Names and Things directly I proclaim  'Tis honest Merit does his Glory raise  Whom that exalts let no Man fear to praise  Of such a Subject no Man need be shy  Virtue's above the Reach of Flattery  He needs no Character but his own Fame  Nor any flattering Titles but his Name  If  Phrases conceal  His Majesty's  Titles  it may be taken for granted our Poetical Man of Prose or rather our Prosaical Man of Poetry has published more than is consistent with the true sense of him Since to say he'll directly proclaim Names and Thing of Him when he takes care to speak very little of either is as much as to say  Your Majesty's gracious Favours will be an Encouragement for me to speak more    William  's the Name that's spoke by ev'ry Tongue  William  's the Darling Subject of my Song  Listen ye Virgins to the Charming Sound  And in Eternal Dances hand it round  Your early Offerings to this Altar bring  Make him at once a Lover and a King  May he submit to none but to your Arms  Nor ever be subdu'd  but by your Charms  May your soft Thoughts for him be all sublime  And ev'ry tender Vow be made for him  May he be first in ev'ry Morningthought  And Heav'n ne'er hear a Pray'r  where he's left out    May ev'ry Omen ev'ry boding Dream  Be  Fortunate  by mentioning his Name  May this one Charm Infernal Powers affright  And guard you from the Terrors of the Night  May ev'ry chearful Glass as it goes down  To  William  's Health  be Cordials to your own  Let ev'ry Song be Chorust with his Name  And Musick pay her Tribute to his Fame  Let ev'ry Poet tune his Artful Verse  And in Immortal Strains his Deeds rehearse  And may  Apollo  never more inspire  The Disobedient Bard with his Seraphick Fire  May all my Sons their grateful Homage pay  His Praises sing and for his Safety pray  The Reader will infallibly conclude with me that  William  is a Name too good for his hoarse Instrument that sounds more like a  Lancashire  HornPipe than a Trumpet and that the  Virgins  may  listen  to  Eternity  and not hear such a thing come from him as a  Charming Sound  But I am amaz'd to see him turn  Pimp  while he is lab'ring at the painful Vocation of a  Panegyrist  and seek out for  Maidenheads  for His Majesty after having offer'd up his Wishes that he may be a  Lover  as well as a King How  soft Thoughts  can be  sublime  without altering the property I confess I am to seek And the next is the uncharitablest Wish imaginable  viz  that  Heav'n should ne'er hear a Prayer where his Name is left out  since we ought to pray for our Enemies And some disaffected People who don't own His present Majesty for their King without doubt pray for  Another  But this is the most diverting Passage of All after he has blamed the Men for taking a Cup so freely he encourages the  Ladies  to take a  chearful  Glass and drink about as a sort of a Cordial for them  Satyr return to our Ʋnthankful Isle  Secur'd by Heav'n's Regard and  William  's Toil  To both Ʋngrateful and to both Ʋntrue  Rebels to God and to Good Nature too  Saytyr may return if it pleases but no body will take notice of its scandalous Appearance How we have been either ungrateful or untrue to our King and Country may be seen by the large Summs we have advanced for the Service of both  If e'er this Nation he distress'd again  To whomsoe'er they cry they'll cry in vain  To Heav'n they cannot have the Face to look  Or if they should it would but Heaven provoke  To hope for Help from Man would be too much  Mankind would always tell 'em of the  Dutch  How they came here our Freedoms to maintain  Were  Paid  and  Curs'd  and  Hurry'd home again  How by their Aid we first dissolv'd our Fears  And then our Helpers damn'd for Foreigners  'Tis not our  English  Temper to do better  For  Englishmen  think ev'ry Man their Debtor  That is more than he knows Six hundred thousand pounds is a great deal of Money and there are People in the World would jump at it once more should we have occasion for their Assistance And the best Instance that can be thought on to prevail with any of our Neighbours will be that we  paid  the  Dutch  before we  sent them home again  As for Abuses upon us for  damning them for Foreigners  'twas done by Vote of Parliament and had the King's own Royal Assent to it and if he has any thing to  remonstrate it against the  Sixth of February  is near at Hand when he may see what thanks our Senators will give him for finding fault with their wise Consulation  'Tis worth observing that we ne're complain'd  Of Foreigners nor of the Wealth they gain'd  Till all their Services were at an End  Wise men affirm it is the  English  way  Never to Grumble till they come to Pay  And then they always think their Temper's such  The Work too little and the Pay too much  That Observation is a very wrong one to my Knowledge for the  Dutch  were found fault with some Years before the Peace though we stood in need of Troops for our  Quota  toward the War and 'twas more adviseable to pay Foreigners which were  Veterane  Troops than raise new ones of raw and unexperienc'd Natives  As frighted Patients when they want a Cure  Bid any Price and any Pain endure  But when the Doctor's Remedies appear  The Cure's too Easy and the Price too Dear  We never thought that we  paid  the  Dutch too much  though they were of such an unsatisfied Temper as to think it too little so that his Simile is very little to the purpose that relates to the  Doctor  and his  Patients    Great  Portland  ne'er was banter'd when he strove  For Ʋs his Master's kindest Thoughts to move  We ne'er Lampoom'd his Conduct when employ'd  King  James  's Secret Councils to divide  Then we caress'd him as the only Man  Which could the Doubtful Oracle explain  The only  Hushia  able to repel  The Dark Designs of  our Achitophel  Compar'd his Master's Courage to his Sense  The Ablest Statesman and the Bravest Prince  On his Wise Conduct we depended much  And lik'd him ne'er the worse for being  Dutch  Nor was he valued more than he deserv'd  Freely he ventur'd faithfully he serv'd  In all King  William  's Dangers he has shar'd  In  England  's Quarrels always he appear'd  The  Revolution  first and then the  Boyne  In Both his Counsels and his Conduct shine  His Martial Valour  Flanders  will confess  And  France Regrets  his Managing the Peace  Faithful to  England  's Interest and her King  The greatest Reason of our Murmuring  Ten Years in  English  Service he appear'd  And gain'd his Master's and the World's Regard  But 'tis not  England  's Custom to Reward  The Wars are over  England  needs him not  Now he's a  Dutchman  and  the Lord knows what  Great Portland  at the time of the Revolution was plain  Myn Heer Bentnick  and Possess'd no Place which  Englishmen  were wont to be Masters of so that he gave no occasion of murmuring to a People who stand mightily upon their BirthRight And no Body questions but he perform'd his Embassy in  France  with an Extraordinary Conduct but we never caress'd him as the  only Man  sit for so great an Employment being well satisfy'd that his Lordship notwithstanding his great Abilities has those who are Natives of this Kingdom that can equal him But I shall never  be of the Opinion that  France regrets his managing the Peace  till what pass'd between his Lordship and the Duke  de Boufflers  be made publick which perhaps may lead me into a lower esteem of the  French  Politicks and  England    though 'tis not her Custom to reward  has recompenc'd that  Noble Peer  's Services by giving his Royal Master such an addition to the CrownRevenue as to enable him to make his Lordship what returns His Majesty shall think fitting  Schonbergh  the Ablest Soldier of his Age  With  Great Nassau  did in our Cause engage  Both join'd for  England  's Rescue and Defence  The Greatest Captain and the Greatest Prince  With what Applause his Stories did we tell  Stories which  Europe  's Volumes largely swell  We counted him an Army in our Aid  Where he commanded no Man was afraid  His Actions with a constant Conquest shine  From  VillaVitiosa  to the Rhine  France Flanders Germany  his Fame confess  And all the World was fond of him but Ʋs  Our Turn first serv'd we grudg'd him the Command  Witness the Grateful Temper of the Land  If he means the old Mareschal  de Schonberg  as certainly he must by what he relates of him he's very much in the dark as to his Knowledge for that General was never Ill spoken of by the People of  England  but deservedly counted next His Majesty their support in time of War Or if he would have us understand him as to the Present Duke his Son and  Generalissimo  of the Forces in  England  whose Post has cheifly been since the Reduction of  Ireland  here in  England    and who has been so far from extending his Conquests from  VillaVitioso to the Rhine  though without question he has Courage and Conduct to do it enough if Opportunity should offer tho' I never heard his Grace had orders to attempt any thing but the taking  Furnes  and  Dixmude  Some malicious People perhaps have spoken disrespectfully of him but it's so far from being a natural affront put upon him that it's nothing else but the Resentments of some Soldiers under his Command  We blame the K that he relies too much  On Strangers  Germans Hugonots  and  Dutch  And seldom does his great Affairs of State  To  English  Counsellors Communicate  The Fact might very well be answer'd thus  He has so often been betray'd by us  He must have been a Madman to rely  On  English  Gns Fidelity  For laying other Arguments aside  This Thought might mortify our  English  Pride  That Foreigners have faithfully obey'd him  And none but  Englishmen  have e'er betray him  They have our Ships and Merchants bought and sold  And barter'd  English  Blood for Foreign Gold  First to the  French  they sold our  Turky  Fleet  And Injur'd  Talmash  next at  Camaret    The King himself is shelter'd from their Snares  Not by his Merit but the Crown he wears  Experience tell us 'tis the  English  way  Their Benefactors alway to betray  Without doubt His Majesty would find himself more assur'd of the Hearts and Purses of his  English  Subjects if it could be possible if  none but They were admitted into His Majesty's Council in relation to  English  Affairs For certainly a reliance on their Fidelity who have run all Hazards ventur'd their Lives and Fortunes and every thing that was dear to them for his Service would not be improper at a juncture of Time when the Hearts and Purses of those Subjects may be very necessary I know of no  Englishman  in a Place of Trust that has betray'd Him  ut in His Majesty's younger Days in  Holland  there were  De Wits  who would had not Providence hind'red their Designs And as for the Loss of the  TurkeyFleet  and the brave General  Talmash  few Men of Understanding but know both those unhappy Miscarriages lie at a Country's door who have no great Aversion to Herrings and Butter  And lest Examples should be too remote  A Modern Magistrate of Famous Note  Shall give you his own History by Rote  I'll make it out deny it he that can  His Worship is a Trueborn  Englishman  In all the Latitude that Empty Word  By Modern Acceptation's understood  The ParishBooks his Great Descent record  And now he hopes e're long to be a Lord  And truly as things go it wou'd be pity  But such as he bore Office in the City  While Robb'ry for BurntOffering he brings  And gives to God what he has stole from Kings  Great Monuments of Charity he raises  And good  St Magnus  whistles out his Praises  To CityGaols he grants a Jubilee  And hires Huzza's from his own Mobile  Lately he wore the Golden Chain and Gown  With which equipt he thus harangu'd the Town  If our Author was capable of blushing he might exert that Faculty now when he is going to abuse a Gentleman whose Name is as Ancient as that of most Families and who has advanc'd his Reputation and his Wealth to such a degree that never  London  Magistrate acquir'd such deserved Esteem during the Execution of his Office and never one went out of it with more good Wishes and  Money  after he had bestow'd so much in Charitable Uses But as these Calumnies were written on purpose to lessen the Number of those who had espous'd his Party against the ensuing Election for Members of Parliament for the City and the Author of it was in Fee with that scandalous hypocritical Sect that gave Bills out against him So Sir  Charles Duncomb  has the less to be concern'd at from the known Partiality and Inveteracy of those that are his Enemies and may stand secur'd of those Rewards for his Good Works which no HirelingScribler can detract from and which shall deduce his Name to Posterity when such a Fellow as the Author represents himself to be shall not be known so much as to have been born  Sir  Cs Db  's Fine Speech  c  WIth Clouted Iron Shooes and Sheepskin Breeches  More Rags than Manners and more Dirt than Riches  From driving Cows and Calves to  Layton  Market  While of my Greatness there appear'd no Spark yet  Behold I come to let you see the Pride  With which Exalted Beggars always ride  'Tis well known to all People who have any knowledge of the Gentleman he insolently spits his Venom at that his Father had not wherewithal to educate him as his sprightly Genius deserv'd yet he was so far from making him a  CowDriver  which sort of People are seldom thought to write and read that he had all the Education necessary for one who being born to no great Matters of Possession was one day to launch out into the World to make his Fortune  Born to the Needful Labours of the Plough  The CartWhip grace't me as the Chain does now  Nature and Fate in doubt what course to take  Whether I shou'd a Lord or PloughBoy make  Kindly at last resolv'd they wou'd promote me  And first  a Knave  and then  a Knight  they vote me  What Fate appointed Nature did prepare  And furnishd me with an exceeding Care  To fit me for what they design'd to have me  And ev'ry Gift  but Honesty  they gave me  Lyars they say ought to have good Memories and the Poet should have bethought himself of his making Sir  Charles  a Cowdriver in the preceding Paragraph before he made him a  Carter  in this else he must never expect the Character of a Man of  exceeding Care  which he has given a Person that deserves it without an  Irony    And thus Equipt to this Proud Town I came  In quest of Bread and not in quest of Fame  Blind to my future Fate an humble Boy  Free from the  Guilt and Glory  I enjoy  The Hopes which my Ambition entertain'd  Were in the Name of  FootBoy  all contain'd  The Greatest Heights from Small Beginnings rise  The Gods were Great on Earth before they reach'd the Skies  If he had not been Equip'd otherwise than our Author would have him and been furnished with Honesty which all Persons who have had any dealing him are ready to testifie yet even then he had exceeded him that makes his Speech for him and all his fancied Acquirements And if to come up to Town in order to advance his Fortunes may fall under the diminutive way of Business that Men follow who are in  Quest of Bread  then every Clergyman Physician and Person of other Creditable Callings may fall under the same imputation  Bwell  the Generous Temper of whose Mind  Was always to be bountiful inclin'd  Whether by his Ill Fate or Fancy led  First took me up and furnish'd me with Bread  The little Services he put me to  Seem'd Labours rather than were truly so  But always my Advancement be design'd  For twas his very Nature to be kind  Large was his Soul his Temper ever Free  The best of Masters and of Men to me  And I who was before decreed by Fate  To be made Infamous as well as Great  With an obsequious Diligence obey'd him  Till trusted with his All  and then betray'd him  Sir  Charles Dmb  has often made appear that he was never ungrateful for the Kindnesses he receiv'd of Alderman  Backwell  and is ready to own him now in the midst of his Prosperity for the first and some occasion of his rising in the World And if the Alderman was His Master as possibly he might though not in the low Station the Poetaster fixes him in it's a sign he was an Excellent and Faithful Servant or a Man of that Famous Banker's Penetrancy of Judgment and cautious way of Proceeding would never have  trusted him with his All    All his past Kindesses I trampled on  Ruin'd his Fortunes to erect my own  So Vipers in the Bosom bred begin  To hiss at that Hand first which took them in  With eager Treach'ry I his Fall pursu'd  And my first Trophies were  Ingratitude    If he had ruin'd his Fortunes the Son of that Honest and unhappy Bankrupt would have shewn his Resentments for it But Mr  Bll  who is now living is satisfy'd of other things and none at this time has a greater respect for Sir  Charles Dmb  and visits him oftner in the Country upon all Occasions  Ingratitude  's the worst of Human Guilt  The basest Action Mankind can commit  Which like the Sin against the Holy Ghost  Has least of Honour and of Guilt the most  Distinguish'd from all other Crimes but this  That 'tis a Crime which no Man would confess  That Sin alone which shou'd not be forgiv'n  On Earth altho perhaps it may in Heav'n  We have nothing to urge in defence of the Sin of Ingratitude or to speak in behalf of any Person who is guilty of it but when it is apply'd to a Gentleman who has it not in his Temper to Reward Good with Evil we should be guilty of the Sin our selves should we not stand up in his Vindication The Sin against the Holy Ghost is  unpardonable  and is the highest Offence any Human Being can commit but he makes a Comparison between it and Ingratitude which is Venial with God and Man which shews he does not rightly understand the Nature of the Crime he writes about  Thus my first Benefactor I o'rethrew  And how shou'd I be to a second true  The Publick Trust came next into my Care  And I to use them scurvily prepare  My Needy Sov'reign Lord I play'd upon  And Lent him many a Thousand of his own  For which great Int'rest I took care to Charge  And so my Illgot Wealth became so large  That is as much as to say he  Broke the Alderman's Back by not holding it  when 'tis apparently true King  Charles  the d's shutting up the Exchequer  was the Cause of it and he had never been forc'd out of his Native Country by his Creditors had not his Faithful Services been overbalanc'd by the Treachery of some Persons who manag'd his then Soveraign's Treasury I believe the Author is no great Conjurer of a Grammarian by making the word  Them  which is of the  Plural  Number agree with  Publick Trust  which is certainly the  Singular  but to take notice of his Faults and Incoherences that way would Employ us too much and 'tis so well known that when Sir  Charles  farm'd one of the Crown Revenues no Person that ever manag'd a Place of Trust behav'd himself more to the Satisfaction of his King and Country than himself  My Predecessor  Judas  was a Fool  Fitter to ha' been whipt and sent to School  Than Sell a Saviour had I been at hand  His Master had not been so Cheap Trepann'd  I wou'd ha' made the eager  Jews  ha' found  For Thirty Pieces Thirty thousand Pound  This is a High Rant indeed The Poet might have as well Compar'd himself to one of the most  Faithful  among the Apostles as the Gentleman whose good Name he takes such Liberty with to the most  Faithless    My Cousin  Ziba  of Immortal Fame  Ziba  and I shall never want a Name    Firstborn of Treason nobly did advance  His Master's Fall for his Inheritance  By whose keen Arts old  David  first began  To break his Sacred Oath to  Jonathan  The Good Old King 'tis thought was very loath  To break his Word and therefore broke his Oath  Ziba  's a Traytor of some Quality  Yet  Ziba  might have been inform'd by me  Had I been there he ne're had been content  With half th' Estate nor half the Government  The Person whom he rail's at under the Name of  Ziba  has so signaliz'd himself in his Services to the  English  Government that his envious Reflections on him return upon himself and without doubt if the  King was loath to break his Word  he would have had some scruple at  breaking  his Oath since Perjury is a Crime infinitely greater than the Breach of a Promise  In our late Revolution 'twas thought strange  That I of all mankind shou'd like the Change  But they who wonder  d at it never knew  That in it I did my Old Game pursue  Nor had they heard of Twenty thousand Pound  Which ne're was lost yet never cou'd be found  The Report this Paragraph is grounded upon is as false as Hell and Sir  Charles  was so far from getting such a large Sum by the Revolution that it's well known to some Persons who are more Acquainted with him than the Author he lost considerably by several belonging to the Court of St  Germains  Yet he Valued the Interest of the Country he was born in more than his own and Rejoyced at his present Majesty's Accession to the Throne purely out of a Principle of Love to the  Kingdom  not because he had outwitted the  King    Thus all things in their turn to Sale I bring  God and my Master first and then the King  Till by successful Villanies made bold  I thought to turn the Nation into Gold  And so to Forgy my Hand I bent  Not doubting I could gull the Government  But there was ruffl'd by the Parliament  And if I 'scap'd th' Ʋnhappy Tree to climb  'Twas want of Law and not for want of Crime  The very Vote of the  House of Commons  which has been Printed by his Enemies to hinder his Election in the City speaks otherwise and tho' there were not a few who gap'd more after his large Possessions than the good of their Fellow Subjects the Wisdom of the Parliament thought fit to drop the Pursuit of the Matter notwithstanding an Enemy of his who was against Reassumptions and is now above being a Member of the House push'd on the Matter in Dispute as far as possible And if such a Crime as  Forgery  could have been prov'd against him there was Law enough at that time in Force against him and they would scarce have put Themselves to the trouble of Voting for a new Act of Parliament for him  But my  The Devil  Old Friend  who printed in my Face  A needful Competence of  English  Brass  Having more business yet for me to do  And loth to lose his Trusty Servant so  Manag'd the matter with such Art and Skill  As sav'd his Hero and threw out the Bl  If the Devil stood Sir  Charles  's Friend and hinder'd the Bill from passing the Parliament of Consequence must have been influenc'd by him Which is a very disrespectful Reflection on so venerable an Assembly  And now I'm grac'd with unexpected Honours  For which I'll certainly abuse the Donors  Knighted and made a Tribune of the People  Whose Laws and Properties I'm like to keep well  The  Custos Rotulorum  of the City  And Captain of the Guards of their  Banditti    Surrounded by my Catchpoles I declare  Against the Needy Debtor open War  I hang poor Thieves for stealing of your Pelf  And suffer none to rob you but my self  Sir  Charles  no more made an Interest to be dubb'd a Knight than he did to be made a Sheriff but since it was His Majesty's and the Cities Pleasure that he should have those  unexpected Honours  conferr'd on him he was ready to do what lay in his Power for the Service of both Tho' he was so far from declaring War against  Needy Debtors  that he made  even their Enemies to be at Peace with 'em  and reconcil'd their Creditors to 'em by assisting those that were Insolvent  The King commanded me to help Reform ye  And how I'll do't Miss shall inform ye  I keep the best Seraglio in the Nation  And hope in time to bring it into Fashion  No  BrimstoneWhore  need fear the Lash from me  That part I'll leave to Brother  Jeffery    Our Gallants need not go abroad to  Rome  I'll keep a Whoring Jubilee at home  Whoring's the Darling of my Inclination  A'n't I a Magistrate for Reformation  For this my Praise is sung by ev'ry Bard  For which  Bridewell  wou'd be a just Reward  In Print my Panegyricks fill the Street  And hir'd Goalbirds their Huzza's repeat  Some Charities contriv'd to make a show  Have taught the Needy Rabble to do so  Whose empty Noise is a Mechanick Fame  Since for Sir  Belzebub  they'd do the same  Our Author who has it not in his Nature to be tender of any ones Reputation would have giv'n us the Name of the Lady as he has done that of the Knight were there any thing of Truth in what he Affirms But he knows so little of the Matter that he cannot so much as give us the first Letter of her Name an infallible Argument of his insufficiency in Matters of Proof If  Bridewell  be the Reward of those that Cry up the Great Actions of  Worthy  Persons  Newgate  certainly should be the place of Residence for those that publish their Praises on the  Ʋnworthy  And tho' I scarce believe any of the first will be sent to beat Hemp yet if common Discourse be not false one of the last is likely to be sent to the  Chequer Inn  in  Newgate street  if Captain  Darby  in St  MartinsLane  be taken up by a Messenger as it's reported  The Conclusion  THen let us boast of Ancestors no more  Or Deeds of Heroes done in days of Yore  In latent Records of the Ages past  Behind the Rear of Time in long Oblivion plac'd  For if our Virtues must in Lines descend  The Merit with the Families would end  And Intermixtures would most Fatal grow  For Vice would be Hereditary too  The Tainted Blood wou'd of necessity  Involuntary Wickedness convey  The Conclusion bears very little proportion to the Premises for the Close of the Poem is fill'd with a Libel against Sir  Charles Duncomb  only who is so far from  boasting of his Ancestors  that he is very ready to acknowledge he did not come into the World with that Advantage as some do If he did actually value himself on the Account of his Descent what Relation does that bear to the Nation in General Or what Plea has the Author to Justifie himself with for Taxing above two Millions of People with a Folly which he only charg'd one in particular with  Vice like Ill Nature for an Age or two  May seem a Generation to pursue  But Virtue seldom does regard the Breed  Fools do the Wise and Wise Men Fools succeed  Ill Nature  is certainly a Vice therefore the Consequence of his  Simile  is that Vice is like Vice which every one knew before And if  Vertue does not regard the Breed  I am inclinable to think he deserves no manner of Excuse for making  Vice  an Attendant of it and tainting the whole  English  Posterity with the Baseness of their ForeFathers Since a Love of Virtue without doubt has as much prevalence and run's in the Blood as an Inclination towards Actions that are Vitious  What is't to us what Ancestors we had  If Good what better Or what worse if Bad  Examples are for Imitation set  Yet all Men follow Virtue with Regret  That question is resolv'd without any Difficulty for if our Ancestors were good than the remembrance of their Brave Actions would excite us to tread in the same Paths of Honour if Bad the Reflections on their dishonourable Practices would create in us a Detestation of Vice and make us endeavour to degenerate from 'em  Cou'd but our Ancestors retrieve their Fate  And see their Offspring thus degenerate  How we contend for Birth and Names unknown  And build on their past Actions not our own  They'd cancel Records and their Tombs deface  And openly disown the vile degenerate Race  For Fame of Families is all a Cheat  'Tis Personal Virtue only makes us great  This Paragraph seems to contradict the main Design of all that went before for the Intent of the Satyr was to render our Ancestors Infamous but now he says we Degenerate from 'em which in plain  English  is we do nothing that is not Praise worthy A  I am glad to hear from him that  Personal Virtue  ly makes us Great  since he's likely to go without any great Stock of Fame who has so little Virtue to  Truck  for it by way of Exchange For if he has as small a share of Honesty as he has shewn of good Nature through his whole lamentable piece of Poetry he may more properly be stil'd a  Bankrupt  than a Dealer in that sort of Commodity  FINIS
