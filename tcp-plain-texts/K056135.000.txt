 OF THE TORMENTS OF HELL THE FOUNDATION and PILLARS thereof Discovered Searched Shaken and Removed WITH Many Infallible Proofs that there is not to be a Punishment after this Life for any to endure that shall never End To the Glory of GOD and Comfort of those in fear of the Torments of HELL and for the furtherance of a Holy Life  The Second Edition  Is not the arrow beyond thee  Sam  If ye will enquire enquire ye Return come  Isa  If thou hast any thing to say answer me if not hold thy peace and I shall teach thee wisdom  Job  LONDON  Printed and Sold by W BOREHAM at the  Angel  in  PaternosterRow    Of Christ's Descending into HELL  SOme of the Learned say  Christ Descended into Hell  and for Proof alledge  Psal    Acts  Dr  Willet  saith that those Words of Christ  Descended into Hell  is not found in the most ancient Creeds Dr  William Whitaker  saith I could produce fifty of the most ancient Creeds that have not these Words  He Descended into Hell  in his Answer to  Campion  pag Mr  William Perkins  on the Creed saith It seems likely that these Words  He Descended into Hell  were not placed in the Creed at first and that it crept in by Negligence for above threescore Creeds of the most ancient Councils and Fathers want this Clause  He Descended into Hell  among the rest not found in the  Nicene  Creed nor found in the  Romish  Church nor used in the Church of the  East    Also some of the Learned say Christ descended not into Hell yet it is an Article of their Faith but if you say he did not descend into Hell they will say you deny the Faith and are a Heretick and a Blasphemer and you may be glad if ye can escape so themselves interpret Hell otherwise than for a Place of Torments never to end Mr  Bucer  saith Christ descending into Hell is to be understood of his Burial Mr  Calvin  saith Hell is the Sorrow of Mind Christ was in before his Death  Why hast thou forsaken me  Is God's hiding his Face when he was upon the Cross saith Dr  Whitaker  against  Campion  pag for upon the Cross he said  It is finished  John therefore his Suffering was at an End Some of the Papists confess Christ suffered not after his Death  Luke    Ʋrsinus Catechis  pag Mr  Perkins  saith Hell is the inward Sufferings of Christ on the Cross  Bernard  makes the Grief of Christ's Soul his  Hell    Doctor  Ames  in his  Marrow of Divinity  pag saith That of the Place of  Hell  and manner of Torture there the Scripture hath not pronounced any thing distinctly If so then the Word of God saith not any thing at all of them for that which the Scripture speaks it speaks distinctly else it could not have been read distinctly  Neh  That which is spoken expresly is spoken distinctly the Spirit speaks expresly  Tim  The Word of the Lord came expresly  Ezek  That which is not spoken distinctly  cannot be understood as appears  Cor  to  Dr  Fulk  saith plainly That neither in the  Hebrew Greek  nor  Latin  there is no Word proper for  Hell  as we take  Hell  for the Place of Punishment of the Ungodly  Fulk  's  Defence Translation  pag Is not this a full Testimony against their Opinion of the Torments of  Hell  For if it be not to be read in the Word of God what have we to do with it We are not to believe any thing in Religion unless it be written  How readest thou  saith Christ  Revealed things belong to us  Deut  As it is written I believed  Cor They confess it is not written then sure I am it is not to be by any affirmed nor believed meddle not with Things not revealed they are but groundless Conceits Fables and Traditions of Men  That the word  Hell  is not in the  Hebrew  and  Greek  Bible for the word in the  Hebrew  for which the  English  word  Hell  is put is  Sheol  the proper Signification of  Sheol  is the Grave as all that be learned in the  Hebrew  do know  Sheol  hath its signification of  Shaal  to crave or require therefore it is one of the four that is never satisfied  Prov  We learn the Propriety of the  Hebrew  word from the learned Rabbies saith Dr  Fulk Def Trans Bib  p The  Hebrew  Doctors and  Jewish  Rabbies are for signification of Words faithful Interpreters they say  Sheol  is the Grave Rabbi  Levi  according to the Opinion of the Learned expounds  Sheol  to be the lowest Region of the World opposite to Heaven  If I descend into Sheol thou art present  So Rabbi  Abraham  on  Jonah  And  David Chimchi  and  R Solomon  read  Psal    Let the wicked be turned into Sheol  that is Death's Estate or deadly Bed  Jonah  calls the  Belly  of the  Whale Sheol  Jon Rabbi  Solomon Jarchi  on  Gen  saith That the true and proper Interpretation of  Sheol  is  Keber  which is the Grave the  hoar Head  is said to  go down Sheol  Gen In  Numb  it is said  They their Substance and Cattle went alive to Shelach  that is the Pit or Grave  Our Bones are scattered at the very brink or mouth of Sheol  Psal  Jacob  said  I will go down to my son Joseph to Sheol  Gen The Protestant Writers say  Sheol  properly signifies the Grave Dr  Fulk  's Answer to the Preface  Remist  p so also in his  Defence  p Mr  Beza  saith That  Sheol  properly signifies nothing but the Grave or Pit  Fulk  saith The best of the  Hebrews  that either interpreted Scripture or made Dictionaries  Jews  or Christians say  Sheol  properly signifies the Grave  pag  and that Deliverance  from the lowest Hell is Deliverance from the greatest Danger of Death so  Fulk  Answ  Remist  pag and so the late Annotation of the Bible interprets it and  Augustine  on  Psal  for  lowest Hell  read lowest Grave and so Dr  Willet Synop  p  The  Chaldee  Paraphrast retaineth the word  Sheol  and translates it the House of the Grave  pag  they interpret  Sheol Keburata  the Grave  Job  be i'th'  Keburata  the House of the Grave  p  Rabbi  Abraham Reristsol  joins  Sheol  and  Keber  together both signifying the Grave and so doth Dr  Fulk  in his  Defence  pag and so Mr  Cartwright  on  Acts  Mr  Gradock  saith Hell is not mentioned in the  Old Testament  but as it is taken for the Grave in his  Good News  pag  Sheol  enforces not any Place of Punishment because it signified not any Place of Punishment so says Dr  Willet Synops  pag also he saith the word  Sheol  cannot be translated but for the Grave There are four Words in the  Psalms  expressing the same thing in effect that  Sheol  doth yet none of them applicable to signifie any Place of Torment the first is  Shacath fovea  the Pit  Psal  the second is  Bhor  the Lake the third is  Cheber  the Grave both these Words used for the same Thing  Psal  the word is  Sheol  v the other Word used as expressing the former and all these three do contain a Description of Death and the Grave the fourth is  Tehemoth Abyssus Terrae Thou wilt take me from the depth of the earth  Psal in all which there is no mention of a Place of Torment  Willet Synop  p  The  Greek  translates  Sheol  into  Haiden  or  Haides  of  Adam  because  Adam  tasted Death and went to the Grave  Gen  The Gates of  Sheol  is Death  Sheol  and  Haides  are said to have Gates  Isa    Psal    Mat    The  Septuagint  express a Place generally to receive the Dead the Word used in the  Greek  instead of the  Hebrew  word  Sheol  signifies a dark Place such as the Grave or Pit in which the Dead are laid Dr  Fulk  saith Some take the  Greek  word for Hell but it signifies the Grave Hell it cannot signifie in their Speech that believe no Hell the  Greeks  say plainly that their Souls shall vanish like light Smoak or light Air  Fulk Def  p also he saith If the  Greek  and  Latin  Interpreters had before us translated amiss which gave occasion to divers Errors must we knowing the true signification of the Word follow them  The word Hell is not in the  Greek  the  Greek  word for which they put the  English  word  Hell  is  Gehenna Ge  in  Greek  is the Earth or Ground and  Henna  is borrowed from the  Hebrew  from the Valley of  Hinnom  Dr  Lightfoot  in his Epistle of his  Harmony  saith It is well known the judgment of  Gehinna  is taken from the Valley of  Gehinna Tophet  or  Gehinnom  are names of the Places of Idolatry there was the Idol  Moloch    Of Hellfire  Matth  and the everlasting fire and unquenchable fire  Matth  Fear him that hath power to cast into Hell  Luke  The damnation of Hell  Matt    Matth  The Fire of  Gehinna  and the everlasting Fire  c  how the  Jews  understood them it is evidently to be seen in their Writings that they understood them of the Fire of the Valley of  Hinnom  so saith Dr  Lightfoot  to the Reader in his  Harmony  Because of the Law thou art deliver'd from the judgment of  Gehenna  and  Baaltur Gen    The Protestant Writers confess that  Matt    Matt    Luke  is to be understood of the Fire of the Valley of the Son of  Hinnom  which is  Tophet  So Mr  Cartwright  Dr  Fulk  Mr  Trap  and the late Annotations of the Bible and others in danger of Hellfire  c  read in danger to burn in the Valley of  Hinnom  or  Tophet  the damnation of Hell of Hell  Gehinnah  they interpret these Places of the Valley of  Hinnom  or  Tophet  which Place was near to  Jerusalem  where they offered their Children to  Moloch Josh  King  Josiah  defiled  Tophet  the Valley of the Son of  Hinnom  that no Man might make his Son or Daughter to pass through the fire to  Moloch    Kings    Josiah  commanded all the Carrion of the City of  Jerusalem  to be carried to that Valley and burnt there that the Carrion might not annoy the City Thither said  David Chimchy  was carried all the Filth and unburied Carcasses to be burned The Synedrian of the  Jews  for some Offences sentenced the Bodies of the Offenders to lie unburied in that Valley to burn with the Carrion cast there which among the  Jews  was counted a great Disgrace and for Offences most criminal they burned alive in that Valley they set the Malefactor in a Dunghill up to the Knees and put a Towel about his Neck and one pulled it one way and another another way till strangling him forced him to open his Mouth then they  poured scalding Lead into his Mouth which went down into his Body and so burnt his Bowels  Talmud in Sanhedr Per  Mr  Cartwright  saith the  Jews  sent thither their Guilty to be burned in that Valley and those they buried there they dealt with as Guilty  Chr    It is confessed by all that Christ speaketh and alludeth to the Jewish Practice in their Judicature therefore the Places abovesaid concern them Secondly The Speech of Christ was to the  Jews  by Birth and Education they wrote the New Testament and though it be penned in  Greek  it speaketh the Phrase of the Jewish Nation The Apostle speaking to the Jews used the word  Gehenna  Jam Christ and his Disciples used known Terms that they might the better be understood Thirdly Because the Jews had not Power to send them to the Hell they speak of thly Because the last of the three Sins is said to be judged to the Fire of  Gehenna  which if it were to be understood as some would have it it will follow that some Sins deserve not Hell and shall not be punished there which is contrary to themselves who teach the least Sin deserves Hell thly  Matt  shewing the Ignorance and Severity of the Jews and Pharisees that Anger without a Cause And  Racha  a word of disgrace which signifies an empty Fellow or wicked Wretch as great Faults as to say Fool if not greater yet punished less rash Anger in danger of the Judgment  Racha  in danger of the Council if say Fool in danger of Hellfire to burn in the Valley of the Son of  Hinnom    Of the word  Everlasting    First The Fire of the Valley of  Tophet  is so called in that it did burn Night and Day and went not out  Secondly The word  Ever  and  Everlasting  the  Greeks  understand it for an Age  Ever  and  Everlasting  are of a like Signification and is used for a limited Time a time during Life  He shall serve his master for ever Ex  Luke that is until his own or Master's Death longer he could not serve him The everlasting Priesthood  Exod  was but until Christ came then it was to cease as appears  Heb  It is said they shall inherit the Land for Ever  Isa  That Ever was but a little while as appears  Isa    Thirdly In that Fire is durable and goeth not out until the combustible Matter is consumed may be called Everlasting  and unquenchable for the Fire that destroyed the Cities of  Sodom  and  Gomorrha  is called  eternal Fire  and  a word of a large signification in that it consumed those Cities for where no Wood is the Fire goeth out  Proverbs    Fourthly If Fire were Everlasting it will not follow that which is cast into it is Everlasting The Wicked are compared to Chaff and Stubble Fire is not long consuming them burn the  Chaff  Isa If any say Chaff will be ever burning and never consumed we know the contrary  Fifthly Consider that the Scriptures sometimes use Words that exceed their Signification and are not strictly to be understood according to their letter and signification of those Words as  John    The things that Jesus did if they should be written I suppose the world it self would not contain the things that should be written  A large Expression What will not the whole World contain a Record of the Actions of one Man The meaning is they would be too great So Sin and the strength of the  Aethiopian  Army are said to be Infinite  Job    Neh  that is very great for the World and all in it is Finite  Isa  These Considerations shew how such Words are to be understood and it may satisfy us herein  Is it not a very strange thing that themselves should confess that the  English  word Hell is in the Hebrew  Sheol  and in the Greek  Haides  and  Gehennah  and that they are to be understood as aforesaid that they should for the said Words translate it in  English  Hell and then expound Hell for a terrible and dreadful Place of Torment never to end O horrible Abuse and Blasphemy against God and his Word and even all Men are deluded and deceived thereby Verily verily they deserve the Name they give to others of denying the Word of God  The Story of  Dives  Luke  Is not any Proof of any Torments in Hell because it is a Parable not a History of a Parable we are not to ground a Doctrine The Story of  Dives  is no more a Proof of a Punishment after this Life than  Judg  is a Proof that Trees did walk and speak though it is said  The Trees went forth and said  c The Story of  Dives  is not to be understood according to the letter for these Reasons It saith There was a rich Man in Hell yet all confess the Body is in the Grave  How could  Dives  see so far as  Abraham  's Bosom is from Hell Mr  Leigh  saith the great Chaos between  Abraham  and  Dives  signify an infinite distance which overthroweth their seeing and speaking to each other It saith he saw  Abraham  yet they say Hell is a Place of utter Darkness How can any thing be seen in a Place of utter Darkness By what means can  Dives  know  Abraham  from another seeing as all confess his Body is in the Grave until the Resurrection  Fifthly How could  Dives  speak to  Abraham  his Body being in the Grave Can any speak without the Organs of the Body  Sixthly How shall  Dives  hear  Abraham  at so great a gulf and distance as Heaven is from Hell  Seventhly How comes  Dives  to have such Charity in Hell to his five Brethren seeing he had none to them when on Earth  Eighthly  Dives  would have  Abraham  to send to them which cannot be because  Abraham knoweth us not  Isa  Ninthly How shall  Abraham  send seing he hath no communion with us nor passage to us  Tenthly To what purpose will it be to send If they will not hear  Moses  and the Prophets neither will they be persuaded if one rise from the Dead  ver  It is therefore a Parable and the scope of it is as Dr  Fulk  saith that those that will not hear  Moses  and the Prophets are not to expect to be called neither by Vision nor Apparition  ver  This Parable is not done but represented saith Mr  Cartwright  on  Luke  The story of  Dives  in Hell is one of their main Pillars of Helltorments and by that which is said it is shaken and removed  Of Tophet  Isa    This Place is no proof of Helltorments themselves being Judges They say Hell is deep under Ground and  Tophet  is a Place above Ground as hath been shewed  Behold the days come  saith the Lord  that this place shall no more be called Tophet nor the valley of the son of Hinnom but the valley of slaughter for in this place will I cause to fall by the sword before their enemies by the hand of those that seek their lives and their carcases will I give for meat for the fowls of Heaven and they shall bury in Tophet till there be no place to bury in  Jer to Jer They confess  Tophet  is the Valley of the Son of  Hinnom Tophet  Hebrew  toph tympanum  that is to say  Gehinnom  Greek  Gehinna  signifieth a Tabret or Drumhead  or any thing that makes a Noise  ver    Tophet  is ordained of old Hebrew yesterday prepared fitted for the King and those with him whom the Lord will there slay for their Sins by their Enemies It is deep and large fit for great Armies to meet and fight in Fire and much Wood to consume the Carcases slain there the Breath of the Lord like a stream of Brimstone doth kindle it not a stream of Fire and Brimstone but like it the destruction being from God was great and terrible or Fire and Brimstone shall be sent from Heaven to destroy them there as  Ezek    Dan    Gen    Tophet  is another of their chief Proofs of the Torments of Hell and with that which is said it is shaken and remov'd  Of  Isa  They shall go forth and look upon the Men that have transgressed against me for their Worm shall not die neither shall their Fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring to all Flesh  This Place is not to be understood of any Punishment after this Life because it saith their Carcases shall lie to be seen and others shall look upon them In Hell they will confess the Carcases of the Wicked are not now nor hereafter shall be for a Carcase is without Life therefore not capable of Suffering If they say at the End of the World Soul and Body shall be united to suffer how is it then a Carcase after the End of the World How shall they be an abhorring to all Flesh For then there will be no Flesh to go forth to look upon them The late Annotation of the Bible on  Isa  say the Carcases are the Forces of Gog and Magog which shall be slain near  Jerusalem Ezek  to and containeth is apparent for after the slaughter is made of them they shall lie a long time unburied and seven Months shall the Children of Israel be a burying them that they may cleanse the Land  Ezek  Also the Judgment inflicted upon them shew it to be in this Life as Pestilence overflowing Rain great Hailstones Fire and Brimstone  Ezek  And the End why God punished them shew it to be in this Life which was that God might be magnified and sanctified in the Eyes of many Nations after the end of the World He cannot be sanctified in the Eyes of any much less many Nations The Worm hath reference to those that are bred and fed upon dead Bodies as  Acts  especially such as lie long upon the Ground until they Rot and become as Dung and Carrion John Jer The Fire to the burning  those Bodies not fit to be stirred and removed but to be consumed by Fire in the place where they lay  Isa    Ezek  that lie rotting upon the face of the Earth until they crawl all over with Worms and Maggots the sight of such is a loathsome Spectacle therefore it is said they shall be abhorring to all Flesh The  Greek  renders it a Sight or Spectacle it hath relation to  Tophet  abovesaid And the Hebrew Doctors say the same on this Place they shall go forth out of Jerusalem into the Valley of Hinnom and there they shall see the Carcases of those that  rebelled against Me  So Dr  Kimchi  and  Abiezr  in loc  The Worm that shall not die and the Fire that shall not be quenched is in this Life and not as they say in Hell  Mark    Rev    Ezek    c Ezek  concerning the Destruction of Gog and Magog as hath been shewed  Concerning  Luke  They shall not come out thence till they have  paid the utmost Farthing    This Place Mr  Leigh  doth alledge to prove Hell Torments and the Papists alledge it to prove their Purgatory and to as much purpose for  ver  is Christ's Counsel to avoid Differences and to compose them that fall out between Man and Man in this Life to prevent Suits in Law and Imprisonment so the Text shews and  Chrysostom  expounds it so The word in the  Greek  is an Adversary of the Law  Pro    Luke  mention is made of the Magistrate and Gaoler which are Terms and Offices properly fitting the Business of this Life A like Place is  Matt  To understand  Luke  of their Hell doth imply Freewill and falling from Grace and that suffering in Hell is a satisfaction and payment of the Debt They will confess in Hell there is no GoalDelivery nor any Redemption therefore it suits not to their purpose It is conceived that Hell is deep within the Earth Reason concludes it must needs be dark the Grave is called the Land of Darkness  Job  the Cruelty of the Enemy is called thick Darkness  Joel  to The Greek Poets say it is dark they compare the darkness thereof to a certain Territory that lieth betwen  Baiae  and  Cumae  where the  Cimeria  inhhabit so invironed with Hills that the Sun never came to it whereupon the Proverb comes  Darker than the darkness of Cimeria  But the chief Cause is because they are in darkness without the light of the Word for Darkness is in this Life  We cannot order our speech by reason of darkness  Job Where no Light is there is  utter Darkness  When the eye is evil the whole body is full of darkness  Matt The  dark  Places of the Earth full of  Cruelty  Psal Ignorant Men are in the Dark and full of  Works  of  Darkness  Rom that would have others tormented with cruel Tortures and Death because not of their Opinion in Religion All unconverted Men are in Darkness they are of the Night  Cor    Gen  Christ is the Light and Saints are the Children of the Light What communion hath Light with Darkness  Cor  Darkness covered the Earth till Christ the Light came to give Light to them that sate in Darkness  Isa    Luk  who hath delivered us from the Power of Darkness  Col  Who hath called us out of Darkness into his marvellous Light  Pet  The People that sate in a Darkness saw a great Light and to them that sate in the Region and Shadow of Death Light is sprung up  Matt  Ye were sometimes Darkness but now ye are Light in the Lord  Eph  The Chains of Darkness are not material Chains but so called because they are fast in Darkness and cannot get out The Law worketh Wrath when that cometh into a dark and ignorant Soul it causeth weeping and gnashing of Teeth  Luke  being sad and comfortless  Of burning the Tares  Matt    Is at the End of the World  ver  The Tares are the Wicked the Harvest is the World By which it appears the Wicked with the Earth shall be consumed by Fire  Pet  Is any so weak as to imagine that Earth will ever burn and never be consumed I have seen some burnt to Ashes in an Hour in a Coal Fire They say our Fire is but painted Fire to that in Hell if so then it will of necessity follow that so much as that Fire is hotter than our Fire so much sooner shall the Body be burnt and consumed in that more fierce and terrible Fire  The Wrath to come  Thess        The late Annotations of the Bible say They were to fill up a full Measure of their own and Father's Sins because God intended to sweep them away by the hand of the  Romans  to cut them off by a Temporal Death which was the Wrath to come to fill up their Sins for the Wrath is not shall come upon them to the uttermost  Thess  We are by Nature the Children of Wraih that is  liable to Wrath inward and outwatd  Thy wrath lieth har  on me  Ps The Wrath of God is the hiding of hi  Face  Isa  Outward Wrath is temporal Destruction he cast upon them the Fierceness of his Wrath  Ps    Destroyed them Deut    Lev    Jos  and  Numb    Ezek    Chr    Psal    Of the word  Cursed    It is to be barren so the Earth and FigTree were cursed  Mat  It is to be a Servant of Servants  Gen    Josh  to want Prosperity  Deut    Mal  to die a violent and disgraceful Death  Kings    Deut  to be a Fugitive a Wanderer  Ps  to eat in Sorrow  Gen  to endure Pain and Hardship  Lev    Of  Eternal Damnation    The word  Damned Mar    Thes    Rom  in  Greek  is Judged Damnation is Judgment Eternal Damnation is Eternal Judgment a Judgment is a Sentence the Sentence is to a second Death called Eternal because it is not to be reversed  The word  Reprobate  Is in the  Greek  of no Judgment a reprobate Mind is a Mind void of Judgment see  Rom    Tim    Tit  See the Notes in the Margin  Of the word  Fire    Fire is put for fiery Trials  Pet  inward Troubles Fire in my Bones  Lam  and the Tongue is a Fire  Sam  and his Word is a Fire  Jer  God's Spirit Fire  Mat  Baptized with Fire  Cor  God is a consuming Fire  Heb  last  Bellarmin  and  Bullinger  and others say the  Fire of Hell  is material Fire kindled with Wood and alledge for it  Isa    Isa  The  Fire of Hell  is true and substantial Fire kept under the Earth to punish withal saith  Tertullian    The Fire of Hell cannot be Corporal Fire for these Reasons  Our Fire is corporal they say our Fire is but painted Fire a Shadow to that therefore it is not corporal Fire  Corporal Elementary Fire is Light and enlightneth the Place where it is in Hell they say is utter Darkness if so the Fire of Hell is not corporal Fire  Corporal Fire consumes speedily all combustible Matter cast into it they say the Fire of Hell ever burneth and never consumeth that cast into it therefore it is not corporal Fire  They say the Fire of Hell is invisible then it is not corporal for that which is corporal may be seen  Corporal Fire may be quenched the Fire of Hell they say is unquenchable therefore it is not corporal  Corporal Fire goeth out without Wood theirs not therefore not corporal  They say the Fire of Hell is Eternal if so it is not corporal Corporal Fire is seen Things seen are not Eternal  They say the Absence of God is the greatest Torment in Hell Corporal Fire is a greater Torment to the Body than the Absence of God  Lastly Corporal Fire cannot work upon a Spirit the Devils are Spirits therefore cannot be tormented with corporal Fire Saith  Willet Synop  pag To say God is able to make corporal Work upon a Spirit and able to make to live without Food or Refreshment to Eternity and to make Fire burn without Wood is no Proof that he will do so and is as silly a kind of Reasoning as to say God is able to do all Things with God all Things are possible therefore he will do all Things Men should not build their vain Conceits upon God's Power without his Word  Others say the Fire of Hell is not Corporal but Spiritual Fire But that it cannot be neither for there is no spiritual Fire if it ceases to be natural Fire it ceaseth to be true Fire it cannot be spiritual because they say it is natural it cannot be natural because they say it is spiritual it cannot be neither of them because they say it is partly corporal and partly spiritual the one to burn the Body the other to burn the Soul Hell Flames are material yet not all material saith  Willet Synop  pag if so there are  two Fires in Hell  Bernard  saith Fire shall burn thy Flesh and a Worm thy Spirit Conscience accusing  Isidore  saith their Minds burn with Sorrow and their Bodies with the Flame  Others say HellFire is neither material nor spiritual nor mixed but metaphorical figurative so  Austin  and some of the modern Preachers say  Calvin  thinketh that there is no true Fire in Hell for saith he the Wood and Worm is to be taken metaphorically but saith another that the Fire is so to be taken I utterly deny  Ten Opinions of the Learned of the Places of Hell  Mr  Edw Leith Hugo  and others say Hell is a Bottomless Pit but there is no Place without a Bottom which is the Earth  It is generally agreed That Hell is in the lower Parts of the Earth but where these lower Parts should be Mr  Perkins  on the Creed saith No Man is able to define the lower Parts of the Earth is great Abasement saith Dr  Fulk  on  Phil  The lowest Degree of Christ's Humiliation  Eph  one part of the Earth is not put in Opposition to another Part thereof but to Heaven  Psal    David  saith Thou had fashioned me in the lowest Parts of the Earth  Psal  Was  David  born in Hell  Bishop  Bilson  Mr  Wheatly  and others say Hell is below but how many Miles it is to Hell they do not say nor cannot tell    Bellarmin Lyria  and others say Hell is in the Earth near the Centre hereof if so ye may know how far it is to Hell the Earth being round the Circumference thereof being Twenty one thousand and six hundred Miles The whole consisting of Degrees at Miles a Degree the Diametet of the Terrestrial Globe is Six thousand seven hundred and eighty two Miles and one Eleventh so there to the Centre or middle Point is Three thousand three hundred and ninety Miles and half at Length deep into the Earth to Hell but in the Day of Judgment when the Earth shall be consumed with Fire as  Pet  where shall Hell be Then it cannot be in the Center of the Earth when there is no Earth  Mr  Leigh  and others say Hell is a Lake the Lake is a Sea as appears  Luke  where the Swine were  choaked  Luke  whose common Death is not half a Mile Men seek Hell in the Bottom of the Sea because they know not where to find it Hell cannot be the Lake because Hell was cast into the Lake  Rev    Others say Hell is in the Air the Devil is the Prince that ruleth in the Air  Eph  the Air then is the Devil's Hell saith  Willet Synops  pag if so then all we that are alive are in Hell we do find it not a Place of so great Torment for almost all Men like it well for there they desire to dwell  Others say Hell is Above near the Third Heavens within the View of the glorious Saints and alledge for it  Isa    Rev  if so it is very far to Hell Astronomers say that there are three Heavens above the Firmament where the Fixed Stars are is a Hundred and sixteen Millions of Miles above the Earth which is so high that if a Stone or Weight should fall from thence and continue falling an hundred and fifty Miles an Hour it would be Eightyeight Years two Weeks four Days five Hours and twenty Minutes a falling down to the Earth  Some say the Absence of God's Face is Hell but that is not called  Hell  but  Wrath Isa  This was  Cain  's Punishment  from thy face shall I be hid my punishment is greater than I can bear  Gen The hiding of God's Face causeth Sadness and the breaking of the Bones of Comfort  Psal    Behold his eyelids try the children of men  Psal if shut they are troubled if open they are comforted  Some say Hell is in this Life and is a guilty accusing Conscience Dr  Willet  saith A guilty troubled Conscience is a Hell and Prison of the Soul what may rather be called Hell than Anguish of Soul The Judges Tribunal is in the Soul God sitteth there as Judge the Conscience is the Accuser Fear is the Tormentor Guilt in the Soul wounds the Spirit  A wounded spirit who can bear  Prov  they the spirits in prison  Pet  this is the wrath of God that abideth upon him that believeth not in the Son  John Heaven is God's Face and Presence and our greatest Joy in this Life  Exod  and so will be the next  Psal    Thou wilt fill me with the joy of thy face in thy presence is fulness of joy  Acts Pleasures or Pleasantness that is pleasant Joys at thy right Hand in the full Enjoyment of thee are sweet Delights eternal  Some say Hell is a local Place  Augustine  saith it is not a Place Doctor  Willet  saith the Place of Hell maketh not the Torments it is a Question saith he whether the Place make Hell or the Absence of the Presence of God  Synops  Page  Another saith it is in the other Side of the blue Cloud that appeareth to us in the Air others say where the Place of Hell is they cannot tell whether it be in the Earth or in the Water or in the Air it is not revealed saith  Greenwood  they that have taken Pains to find it out are as far from it as ever some of the Ministers of  France  affirm that Father  Cotton  the Jesuit did enquire of the Devil for a plain Place of Scripture to prove Purgatory so they are at as great Loss to prove Hell by a plain Place of Scripture truly translated their Hell of Torments never to end Also the learned agree not upon which Scripture to ground their Hell Torments upon for that Place one of them alledge to prove it another of themselves deny it that it is so to be understood Mr  Ainsw  on  Psal  saith that Place through Custom is taken for the Place of the Damned but is not so to be understood the Word being  Sheol Marolat  on  Apoc  Pag saith the Fire of  Gehenna  is the Place of the Damned others of them deny it M  Leigh  saith  Dives  proves it Dr  Fulk  and others deny it  See ye not the great Doubting and Uncertainty they are at among themselves They grope in the Dark without Light  Job  by their reeling staggering and stumbling that they are so drunk they can find no Ground to stand upon they understand not whereof they affirm yet each of them hugs his own Apprehension It is very strange that in a thing so signal of which they say they see it in the Word of God that they can no Way agree concerning it O ye learned in the seven liberal Sciences tell us how to reconcile these things in Point of Truth or tell us in as much as ye speak Contraries as yea and nay which of you we are to believe Have we not all cause to say herein  Where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world  Cor  he frustrateth the tokens of liars and makes diviners mad and turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge Foolishness  Isaiah  Mr  Edward Leigh    Esq  and Master of  MagdalenHall  in  Oxford  presents his Reasons to prove HellTorments or  Punishment after this Life for some to endure never to End let them be considered  Prov  Mr  Leigh  saith the Conscience of Man hath a Fear of some Punishment after this Life proves it  Answ  If they have that doth not prove it because the Conscience of Men are as they are instructed according to the Proverb  Such Docter such Scholar  hence it is that the Conscience of a Papist tells him it is not lawful to eat Flesh in Lent not of a Friday  And whoso killeth you will think he doth God good service  Joh that is his Conscience the Consciences of some Men are almost if not altogether for some Evil therefore that proves it not  Mr  Leigh  the Heathen held there was a Hell a Being and Place for wicked Men after this Life  Answ  Why did ye not say and prove that they hold that they shall be in Torment never to an end  The Heathens do not believe that there is to be such a Punishment after this Life for they deny the Resurrection of the Body therefore they burn the Body and save the Ashes in an Urn for a Memorial they believe as  Pythagoras  the Philosopher taught that the Soui goeth from one Body into another Man or Beast that some of the Philosohers grew so tender that they would not kill any Beast nor Fowl for they said it may be it is my Brother or my Sister These Heathen Greek Poets were long before the coming of Christ in their  treble Division  of the World they fain three Gods  Jupiter  the God of Heaven  Neptune  the God of the Sea and  Pluto  the God of the Earth in which they say he keeps his Court and Palace no word of Torment that would make it a poor Court and Palace so  Homer  and  Noninus  Greek Poets  Homer  wrote of the Destruction of  Troy  which was near a thousand Years before the Birth of Christ  Homer  is one of the most ancient Records extant it seems in his time there was no mention of a Hell of Torments never to end the said Poets call  Pluto Summanus  as being Chief of the Maunes or Spirits below To pacify these ill Spirits a feast was kept in  Febuary  with Wax Candles burning to  Pluto  called  CandlemasDay  so Mr  Jes  in his Almanack  The Cretians are always liers Titus  the greatst liars in the World that will fancy fain and say any thing is it a thing possible that Wax Candles above the Earth should give Light thousand of Miles into the Earth to pacifie those ill Spirits there it seems they are not in any great Torment if a little Light  will pacify them The Poets say Hell is twice as deep as Heaven is high the Astronomers say  Jupiter  the second Planet is Millions of Miles above the Earth if Hell be twice as deep it is a hundred and fifty four Millions of Miles to Hell which is  fabulous  so there  Cerberus  three Heads and  Charus Boat  to row Men to  Pluto  so the Fancy of Purgatory did spring first from the Heathen Poets long before the coming of Christ as appears by  Plato  and  Virgil  who have described at large the whole Commonwealth and all the Orders and Degrees of Purgatory These with their  Elysian  Fields and many other of their Barbarisms by long Use became venerable  Your Opinion is fitter for Heathens than for Christians If the Heathens do hold as you do are we to believe in Religion as the Heathen I pass not what they nor any else say unless they can read it me in the Word of God we cry  to the Law and to the Testimony if they speak not according to this Word it is because there is no light in them  Isa Mr  Leigh  saith clear Reason proves it God is just many abominable Sinners enjoy more Prosperity in this Life than those that live far more innocently must be punished hereafter according to the Multitude and Hainousness of their Sins  Psal    Answ  I see you are more bold to affirm than able to prove doth Reason deny the Punishment to be just except it never End The Scriptures you alledge say they have an end and you say they shall never have an end that is your clear Reason to say some are worse than others therefore they are to suffer a Punishment never to end so you exclude  Mary Magdalen  and the poor Prodigal but it is but your bare Affirmation without Proof your Reason is that God should shew Mercy to little Sinners but none to the great Sinners they must not be saved but this your clear Reason is clear against the Will and Wisdom of God who is pleased to save of the worst of Sinners as appears St  Luke    Tim    Asts  If some enjoy more Prosperity than others must they therefore suffer a Punishment never to end Outward Prosperity is a great Blessing and you make it a great Curse if that you say were true there is no Cause  in the Day of Prosperity to rejoyce  Eccl nor to say  O Lord I beseech thee send me now Prosperity  Psalm in saying greater Sinners you judge according to outward Appearances both for Sin and Punishment and may be mistaken in  both what they are in the inner Man for Sin and Punishment you know not the Heart of Unbelief and Rebellion of Spirit in others nor how God punisheth them in their Spirits Sin is punished in this Life  Mr  Leigh  saith 'tis just they should suffer for ever who if they had lived would have sinned for ever  Cast them out of my sight  Jer  Answ  If it be just we should suffer for ever it is just our Surety should suffer for ever  Do you consider that  the Creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him that hath subjected the same in hope  Rom  Cast them out of my sight  is no Proof that they shall suffer for ever but rather that they shall be utterly destroyed for if they have any Being wherever they be they cannot be out of Sight of God  Your Justice is not God's his is a Death yours is not a Death but another thing  Mr  Leigh  saith God's intentions from everlasting was to glorify his Justice as well as his Mercy  Rom  fitted to Destruction  Answ  Know you any of the Intentions of God that is not revealed in his Word  Deut  or doth the Word say that God not glorify his Justice unless he inflict so great a Punishment without end you give neither Scripture nor Reason to prove that you say is just the Justice of God was revealed and made known in causing the Earth to swallow up  Corah and his Company  they  were Vessels of Wrath prepared fitted to Destruction  your Opinion denies the Word of God that saith they are fitted to Destruction you say they are never to be destroyed die nor end Mr  Leigh  saith the Covenant under which ungenerate Men stand and by which they are bound over to this Wrath is everlasting  Answ  There is but two Covenants  Gal    the old and new  Heb and the old is no more everlasting than the Priesthood of it The Breach of the Covenant of Works is Death therefore not eternal Life in Misery Mr  Leigh  saith in that Torment they curse and accuse one another  Answ  When you write again I pray tell us how you know that in Hell they do so for the Word of God saith not so nor have you been there to hear it nor they that told you so To affirm things in Religion not revealed  in the World of God is to presume above that which is written and contrary to  Cor    Rom    Socrates  an Heathen was more wise and modest in not affirming things he knew not being asked what was done in Hell said he never went thither nor communed with any that came from thence Yet you and others affirm with great Boldness and Confidence things you know not some say in Hell the Eye is afflicted with Darkness whereas Darkness is no Affliction to the Eye also they say their Ears are afflicted with horrible and hideous Outcries their Noses with Poysons and stinking Smells of what I pray their Tongues with gaully Bitterness the whole Body with intollerable Fire the Damned shall prize a Drop of Water worth ten thousand Worlds cursing shall be their Tunes Blasphemies their Ditties Lamentation their Songs and Screeking their Strains they shall lye screeking and screaming continually Ye see how Men set their Brains to work to invent Lies for all they say is without Warrant from the Word of God One saith their Torments in Hell is so great that they cannot forbear roaring and you say they curse and accuse one another so that one of their vain Imaginations contradict another and all of them the Word of God they will not deny that those in Hell are in the greatest Trouble and they in less Trouble cannot speak  I am so troubled I cannot speak  Ps therefore they cannot curse and accuse one another as you affirm  Mr  Leigh  saith Divines unanimously concur  c  Ans  If they do it is not binding to us for we are satisfied they are not infallible  There must be Errors  Cor they have the greatest Share The Priests  Popish  and  Mahometan  Priests  Baals  Priests and all other Sorts of Priests concur common Consent sooner believed than naked Truth it is high time to  Cease from Men for wherein is he to be accounted of  Isa Truth and not Number of Men is to be followed  Every one must give an Account of himself to God  Rom  Luther  said he esteemed not the Worth of a Rush a Thousand  Agustines  and  Cyprians  against himself all Churches err  Parnormitan  said more Credit is to be given to one speaking Truth than to all Men in all Ages speaking the contrary  They are like to concur and agree if they take the Counsel they give as not to question Principles It seems we must take all upon Trust and Hearsay without Tryal they all say it therefore it is true but the  Bereans  wo  ld  and did search the Scriptures to see if Things were so as the Apostles preached see  Joh    Let it be certainly made to appear that God hath said in any thing contrary to any thing that I have said I desire with all my Heart to submit to it without that I cannot yield the Soveraignty of my Judgment and Conscience to the concurring Consent of blind Guides ignorant and erroneous Men though in Sheeps Cloathing and covered all over with the Title of Godly learned and holy Saints or Presbyters or Ministers of Christ the  Papists  call their Church Holy Church and their Priest Holy Priest and their Order Holy Order and all Holy if you will believe them  Some say the  Jews  report that in  Tophet  the Valley of the Son of  Hinnon  there was a great Ditch which could never be filled which they called the Mouth of Hell and that the  Chaldeans  when they slew the  Israelites  threw them in there If this Report be true which hath been brought to prove Hell then it will follow that the Mouth of Hell is near  Jerusalem  and that God doth give to the Wicked Power to cast his People into Hell  How much Weight there is in your Reasons to prove a Punishment after this Life never to end let who will Judge I for my Part profess I do not see how they serve to your Purpose your Nakedness appears and that your Opinion hath neither Scripture nor Reason to support it and therefore it must needs fall  Tim  You have done all you can and can come to no surer Bottom to rest upon than Supposals and Imaginations wresting Scriptures and Consent of others your Glory is that all are of your Mind though without good Ground or Reason as is shewed Also in that you alledge Reasons to prove Hell Torments it giveth me Occasion to believe in your own Judgment the Scriptures you alledge to prove it prove it not for if you believe the Scriptures prove it to what Purpose serve your Reasons Or do you think that those that doubt of the Sufficiency of our Proof of it by Scripture will be satisfied with your Reasons as a full Proof of it if there be any such they may be to them of some use  The learned contradict themselves Mr  Bolton  saith Thou must live in endless Woe in Brimsbone and Fire which thou mightest so often and easily escape which overthrows the Doctrine of Election also they say the Sense  of Loss in Hell is greater than the Sense of Pain So they make the sensible want of the Presence of God the greatest Torment in Hell and that is in this life I am cast out of thy Sight  Psal  it followeth by their Doctrine that the greatest Torment of Hell is in this Life  Mr  Leigh  saith in his  Body of Divinity  the Sense of God's Wrath Rage of Conscience Guilt Fear Dispair the Soul cannot melt with greater Torment if so then this is not a worse Torment in Hell than is in this Life  Water is so scarce in Hell that  Greenhood  saith the Damned prize a Drop of Water above ten thousand Worlds and yet they affirm those in Hell shall continually weep  c  therefore their own Sayings agree not  The first Author of the Opinion of the Torments of Hell never to end was  Marcion  the Heretick that held that Christ was not a Man but in Semblance and that there was two Beginnings two Gods one good one bad that there was Torments for some in Hell was first invented by him he determined the Reward of the Creature either in Torment or Refreshment to be laid up for them in Hell he was the first Author thereof by  Tertulian's  Confession as saith Dr  Fulk  in his Defence Page see and behold the Original of your Opinion of the Torments of Hell  An evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil  Luke  The seven Pillars of Hell shaken and removed  The Greek Fathers were the first Pillars of Hell Torments this came to pass by reason of the Ignorance of the Fathers in the  Hebrew  Tongue their not understanding the Word  Sheol  deceived them so saith Dr  Fulk  in his Defence Pag  The second Pillar of Hell Torments were the Writers of the  Hebrew  and  Greek  Copies of the Bible their Defect hath put us to a great Loss the original Copy the Apostles wrote is not only unknown to us but to the Learned we do not hear of any alive in  England  that can produce the New Testament the Apostle wrote it's not enough that they say that we have Books in  Hebrew  and  Greek  unless we could certainly know that these Copies as they call them agree Word for Word with those that were wrote by the Prophets and Apostles Many boast of God's  preserving the  Hebrew  and  Greek  Bible amidst so many Enemies as God hath been pleased to deliver up Christ and his People so also the Scriptures into the Hands of Sinners to be used at their Pleasure It is wonderful to consider what adding and altering the Scriptues have been subject unto one Pope publisheth what he pleases for Scriptures as Pope  Urban  V and within two Years after Pope  Clement  that succeeded him calls them in and burneth them and puts out what he pleaseth and calls it the holy Scriptures if ye will believe the Testimony of the learned and godly Protestant Writers who have not been esteemed Blasphemers nor Hereticks as Dr  Fulk  M  Beza  M  William Perkins  Dr  Amis  and others Dr  Fulk  saith that some  Greek  Copies are altered it is not unlikely in his Answer to the Remist to the Reader page And which is more he saith Corruption hath happened to all Copies this Day extant in his Answer to Preface page whole Verses omitted in some Copies as  Job  is not in some Copies nor in the  Syriack  which is ancient as Apostles read not this Verse at all but is extant in others and that there is at least sixteen various  Greek  Copies of the New Testament  Jus Divinum  page Dr  Lightfoot  saith Mr  Beza  was a Man that always question'd the Text to see so many differing Copies would put any one to a stand which to believe Mr  Perkin  saith it must not seem strange that Words in the Margin have crept into the Text Dr  Amis  saith  Helps Governments  in the first of the  Corinthians  are not in the Original he supposeth it to be done by the Prelates in Favour of their Government The Preachers who call themselves Divines have assumed and challenged Divine Authority to frame all Copies and Translations and to expound all T  xts according to their own Minds to maintain their own Doctrine and Practises to uphold their Power and Standing Hence it is that each differing Party's Translation agree not that Party that would have the Magistrate punish idolatry  c  have made a Text for it  Job  ▪ to be punished by the Judges But these Words are not in the  Hebrew  but are an Addition of their own as appears by the Bible printed in  London  by the Assigns of  John Bill  in the Year And the  Geneva  Bible differs from this and from the Translation printed by the  Stationers London  The  English  Transl  tion hath Variety of Differences not without evident Contradi  ion among divers Places  that might be instanced see Verse of the seventh of  Daniel  in the  Geneva  Traslation Verse is  I beheld till the Thrones were set up  And in the King's Translation printed by the Company of Stationers  London  the same Verse is  I behold till the Thrones were cast down  and Verse it is But Saints of the most High shall take the Kingdom And in the  Geneva  Translation the same Verse is And they shall take the Kingdom of the Saints both cannot be true which of these is an  Englishman  to believe Some say  Luther  added the Word  only  to the Text being ask'd why he did it said he did it to make the Apostle say more plainly  Faith only justifieth  Dr  Fulk  's Defence  English  Translation page saith we follow in our Translation as near as we can the holy Scripture in such Sense if any thing be doubtful as the proper Circumstance of the Place will lead us unto that we may attain to the meaning of the holy Ghost So then it seems if the Translator do think the holy Ghost meaneth this or that he may translate it so Is not this a large Liberty The  Jews  take on such Liberty  The Ministers of  Lincoln  Diocess in the Abridgment of their Grievances delivered to King  James  page say that the  English  Translation of the Bible is a Translation that takes away from the Text and adds to the Text and that sometimes to the changing and obscuring of the holy Ghost and Mr  Broughton  the great Linguist in his Advertisement of Corruption tells the Bishops that the publick Translation of the Scriptures in the  English  is such as that it perverts the Text of the old Testament in eight hundred forty and eight Places and that it causeth Millions to reject the old Testament and Dr  Featly  Dr of Divinity in his  Dipper Dipt  page saith no Translation is simply authentical or the undoubted Word of God In the undoubted Word of God there can be no Error but in the Translation there are and may be Errors the Bible translated therefore is not the undoubted Word of God but so far only as it agreeth with the Original the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles and in as much as our  English  Translation as he saith is not the undoubted Word of God what is that Preaching worth that is proved by it The false Glosses and Interpretations which are put upon the Scriptures by Men learned in the Languages who have made inconsiderate and bold Assertions without Proof in not keeping the true and proper Signification of the Words thereof hath caused many  Errors and great Trouble and Confusion they put the Word  Lucifer  for the Daystar  Isa  They have forsaken the Fountain and digged to themselves Cisterns as  Jer  And we see the People are willing to give up themselves to a Ministry of Fables  Kings    Pet  that makes the Scriptures say and unsay which being interpreted is to make them say just nothing the Force of Education and the Custom the Countrymen live in is such as ordinarily ingageth them to a Prejudice and evil Opinion against all Principles contrary thereunto though of divine Inspiration Hence the  Papists Turks  and several Sorts of  Protestants  cry down and censure each others Judgment and Opinion as abominable Error Heresy and Blasphemy  The third Pillar that upholds Hells Torments are fond Expositors that interpret  Sheol  for Hell Torments so Dr  Fulk  calls them in his Defence page I would know why Interpreters understand and translate a Hell of Torments from the  Hebrew  and  Greek  as is not in them as themselves confess as hath been shewed They will take  Sheol  figuratively and say by  Tophet  Hell is figured which is a Fancy a Fable and Delusion that is strong in many that expound Scripture without Sense or Reason it is as improper to interpret  Sheol  for a Place of Torment as to interpret the Word House to signify a Horse The Scripture is not of private Interpretation a Sense arising out of the Brain of an Interpreter is a private Interpretation and as the Scriptures are not of Man but of the holy Spirit so the Interpretation of them is not to be of Man but of the holy Spirit Oracles signify the Answer of God  Rom  see  Job    and how readest thou  Luke to interpret Words figuratively that are to be understood literally and Words literally that are to be understood figuratively is licencious and destructive to the Faith of the Gospel we are not to interpret any Place figuratively unless that figurative Sense be expressed in a plainer Place of Scripture if a Man will have an erroneous Perswasion whatsoever the Scripture saith to the contrary he will have it to be a figurative Sense they will be left in the Clouds of their own Perswasion so instead of proving their Hell of Torments never to end by the Scriptures  Ruffinus  and others say they that will not believe it shall seal it which is no Proof but a meer Shift as very a lie as Nurses use to still Children by telling them of a great Bulbegger and that a Man will come down the  Chimney and carry him away but not any but Children and Fools will be scared with such Bulbeggers  The Fourth Pillar that upholds their Hell Torment is the Consent of their Preachers their learned and godly Men agree herein but their weak and various and uncertain Grounds declare that they have not studied the Point but when Teachers and Hearers are ignorant any thing will serve and pass for Truth the simple believe every Word All sorts of Priests agree and abuse the People the  Mahometan  Priests blow a Powder into their Eyes that comes to see  Mahomet  hang that maketh them quite blind that for ever after they are led and the Priests say that the Glory of the Sight of  Mahomet  is so great that it taketh away their sight for ever after and about  Easter  time for ten Days there is great Joy about a great fire for their Priest  Mahomet  and those that cast themselves into the Fire and are burnt to Death are counted Martyrs and once a Year the Tomb of  Mahomet  is carried a broad upon a cart and his Priests say that those that put themselves under the Wheel of that Cart and are crushed to Death they say to dye Martyrs and some are so Simple to do so that so they may dye Martyrs so the AntichristianPriests and all sorts of Priests have greatly deluded and deceived the People blowing something into their Ears that for ever after they are not able to here and receive the Truth But as M  Beza  did detest the Papists Limbus and Purgatory so do I their Dreams of Hell it being a device of Man without Scripture with all their uncertain Brain sick Fancies for the Imaginations of Men have no end  The th Pillar of Hell is their wresting the Scripture to uphold their Hell of Torments this cozeneth and deceives many under Colour of Divine Authority when it's but Humane though they are not pleased publickly to say so because it streams not to their Purpose the Scriptures they alledge to prove is about considered if any say I wrest Scripture I appeal to the Learned in the Languages for to them concerneth the Decision of the Signification of Words who as I have shewed testifie with me  The sixth Pillar of Hell is their Arguments and Reasons they bring to prove Hell Torments which have been considered  The seventh Pillar of Hell is a strong Perswasion that is in Men that the believing Hell Torments is a great Means  to leave Sin and to live a holy Life and the not believing Hell Torments is a Means to commit all Sin with Greediness and to live as they list for they say Men live as though there were no Hell  Carnal Hearts of Men taken Offence of every thing except the Law of Works doing to be saved the Doctrine of Election God's free Grace and Salvation only and alone by Christ without Works  Rom  is changed to be one of the greatest Doctrines of Liberty to sin that ever was and is by the Ignorant made a Stumblingblock and Rock of Offence and a Cause of Carelesness in many  Ludovick  said if I be saved I be saved If I be damned I be damned the Papists say if good Works save us not to what Purpose shall we do them Then we may live as we list if we be appointed to Life we shall be saved though we Sin never so much  if we sin we have an Advocate  Joh  not any thing can separate us from the love of God  Rom If we be not appointed to Life we cannot be saved though we should do never so much good yea see how this truth is turned to Wantonness the Apostles exhort not to turn this grace of God into Wantonness Rom ▪ The corrupt Heart of Man is ready to do it there are many things in  Paul  's Epistle which the Ignorant Unlearned that know not God in Christ wrest to their own Destruction will any therefore say that the Doctrine of Election and Salvation by Christ alone is not a Doctrine fit to be taught not come abroad if so the Scriptutes must not come abroad  Moreover the Doctrine of the Protestant Ministers is charged not only to be a Doctrine of Liberty to Sin but a blasphemous Doctrine to teach that the Fall and Sin of Man was decreed they say is to make God the Author of Evil the Protestant Writers say that the Sin of Man was determined of God Dr  Willet Synop  pag He also saith the Protestants hold that the fall of  Adam  was both foreseen of God and decreed to be not permitted only they alledge  Gen    Sam    Acts  and  Acts    should ungodly lusts Judg  for the Creature was made subject to Vanity not willingly but by Reason of him that had subjected the same in Hope  Rom  Dr  William Whitaker  against  Campion  the Jesuit saith now answer me  Campion  do you think that which any one doth how wicked soever is done whether God will or no If you hold that any thing is done against  God's Will what Providence or Omnipotency do you leave him For he that permitteth that to be done which he would by no Means have to be done it is certain that he is not endued with so great Power as that he can forbid that which he would not have done wherefore you must needs confess that all Things that are done are done by the Will of God and Pag all confess God could have hindered Sin to be if he had so pleased but he would not hinder it therefore it was his will it should be the Will of God and not Sin is the Cause of God's Decree and the being of all things the Will and Pleasure of God is the Womb from whence springeth every Work of the Creature  Rom  God must first will his Creature to stand or fall before he can do either  Acts    Phil    Prov  the evil Actions of Men are not only foreseen of God but decreed saith Mr  Par  in hie Grounds of Divinity we are not saved from sin except we have committed Sin therefore Salvation from Sin is not without committing Sin saith  Fulk  pag God willed and decreed his Glory and Man's Happiness therefore he willed and decreed the Means to it The end and moving Cause of his willing Sin to be is for his Glory which Cause it was necessary for Sin to be if Sin had not been how should the Goodness of God in giving Man Eternal Life in Glory appeared his Love in sending Christ to die If there had not been Sin there had been no need of Christ's comming nor of his Death and Righteousness most of the great Works of God in this World and that to come have Dependance or Reference to Sin how should we have lived by Faith exercised the Fruits of the Spirit or have any Happiness or Glory in the World to come if it had not been for Christ And Christ had not been if there had been no Sin He that willeth the End willeth those things that are necessarily referr'd to that End Taking away Sin was decreed before the World therefore the Being of Sin was decreed Christ's Death was determined before the World for the End of Christ was to restore  Adam  's Fall If  Adam  had not fallen there had been no need of a Christ to restore him The Saints were chosen to Life before the World Choice hath Reference to the Fall therefore the fall of  Adam  was decreed If the Will of Man had been the first and chief Cause of the being of Sin then the Will of Man should be the Cause of God's Will and so Men should be the  original Cause of the Salvation of himself and so much the Cause of it that without his will it could not have been and so the Determination of God what to do shall not be from himself but from the Will of Man which is contrary to  Eph  if Men should will Sin before God willed it then shall the Will of God depend and wait upon the Will of Man as if God should say If Man will Sin then I will his Salvation And if God should first will to send Christ to save Man and leave it to Mans Will and Power whether he shall fall or no then it was possible for Man to stand and so to frustrate the Decree of God For if Man had not sinned God's Decree of sending Christ had been void and of none Effect Mr  Perkins  saith God Decree the fall of  Adam  if the fall was decreed if Man had Power to Stand then he had Power to frustrate God's Decree which no wise Man will affirm and then that saying that  Adam  had Power to keep the Law is without truth if he had consider  Ezek    Je  God willeth all things well he sinneth not nor can Sin because he is under no Law God commands Men to keep the Law that no Man can do he commands Men to think no vain Thoughts and not to sin we cannot but think some vain Thoughts and in many Things we Sin all Christ saith  No man can come to me except the Father draw him  John if they be drawn they come  draw us and we will run after thee  Cant if I put sufficient Strength to move the Earth Motion must needs follow when Men sin they are beguiled enticed deceived drawn away  they like men have transgressed  Hos  We are to distinguish between that which followeth a Doctrine in its own Nature and that which followeth by Accident or rather that a corrupt Heart draweth from it and is not from the Nature and Working of the Doctrine it self it is strange to consider Men are to set upon the Popish Principle to be saved for their Works that they count all Prophaness that crosseth their Way some have burned the Bible and Doctor  Crisp  's Book of Salvation by Christ alone Mr  Archers  late of  Allhallowes London  his Treatise of Comfort to beleivers against their Sins and Sorrow was burnt by the Hangman the same Spirit is alive to burn this also I expect no better from such as are not taught of God they condemn those Things they know not and think they do God Service when they persecute the Truth and Professors of it  Take for Instance that the Fear of the Torments of Hell is no such Preserver against Sin is evident for those that sin with the greatest Greediness the greatest Sinners they do believe there are Hell Torments For tho' they be never so wicked they hope it doth not belong to them or they hope to repent and lead new Lives before they die though they sin for the present they hope to make God amends for all as an  Arminian  being drunk saith that he was now in the State of Damnation but he said he would be in the State of Grace to morrow so he comforted himself The Lives of many Heathens that have denied the Resurrection of the Body and therefore did not hold a Hell of Torment after have been better than many that seek to escape Hell and get Heaven by their Works  If Fear of Hell were a Preserver against Sin then those that are delivered from the Fear of Hell that believe they shall be saved they should Sin more than others but we find the contrary that none more free from Sin than these  Experience teacheth that the Fear of Hell though at first it startleth and frighteth Men yet that is soon over and is no Preserver against Sin I knew one set before him the Torments of Hell to keep him from Sin and finding that would not do he added Vows and Curses to keep him from Sin I knew another wished the Devil to take him Soul and Body if he did not do the thing he spake of and I knew he did it not Another wished he might sink into Hell presently if he did the thing he spake of yet did do it before he went from the Place the Reason is because the Lusts of Men are stronger than the Fear of Hell Resolutions and Curses  Because Men are given up to their own Hearts Lusts it may be that they may find that Liberty to Sin is the greatest Misery and Bondage in the World it hath all misery in it whether they Sin with more or less Fear and could enjoy all the Pleasures of Sin for a Season they will find they have made a bad Bargain of it  What fruit had ye of those things whereof ye are now ashamed  Rom  If I sin thou markest me  Job  Be sure your sin will find you out  Numbers  In keeping thy commands there is great reward  Psal In breaking them a great Punishment loss of inward Peace and Comfort a guilty accusing Conscience Disgrace Affliction Losses Crosses  and Death  the bloody and deceitful man shall not live out half his Days  Psal  I will curse your blessings  Mal see  Deut    Men Sin because  they are led Captive by the Devil at his will  Tim and also Men Sin because they are under the Law so long as a Man is under the Law Sin will have Dominion over a Man  Rom    Sin shall not have dominion over them that are under grace  Men Sin because they have not received Power from on high against Sin until they receive that Power they cannot but Sin  Thou hast led Captivity Captive and given Gifts for Men  Psal until Christ by his Spirit set the Soul at Liberty it is in Bondage and enthrall'd to base Lusts  But if the Son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed  John but not till then see  Eccles  The Punishment of the Magistrates keeps Men from abusing others more than Fear of Hell Men would be exceeding dissolute if under no Discipline of Superiors  Men go to Sin for Comfort Sweetness and Satisfaction but when satisfy'd they go not to Sin to act for Life is no Love to God nor Selfdenial nor any Spiritualness nor will it do them good it's not accepted of God nor will it continue such so restrained ofttimes do exceed all other in Sin the spiritual Soul that lives in the Enjoyments of the Love of God needs no such Weights to procure its Motion he acts from a new Life and Principle to the Glory of God and good of others and in this Work and Labour of Love is more Sweetness than is in all the Pleasures of Sin which are but for a Season  It is great Ignorance for any to think that it is in the Power of any Man to Sin as much as he will if this be proved all Objections are answered and this the Scripture proves that without the Will of God Men cannot do any thing not so much as go to a City unless God will  Jam  God worketh governeth and disposeth all Things after the Counsel of his own will  Ephesians    Job  he  Act    Rom    Who hath resisted his will Gods will is done Luke    Hebr    Eph    Acts  The Measure of Men's Sins are set Men cannot do more nor less than their Measure they fill up their Measure always  Thess  it was determined how often  Peter  should deny Christ  Luke  with verse God saith if you will believe him  The wicked  shall do wickedly  Daniel ▪  they cannot cease from sin  Pet  That which is determined shall be done  Dan he that restraineth the Clouds that they dropt not down Rain  He made a decree for the Rain  John and the Earth that it bring not forth Grass  Deut    He that stilleth the Winds and the Tempest  Psal  that saith to the Waves of the Sea  Hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud Waves be stayed  Job he restraineth Men from doing their Wills when he pleases they would go further but he restraineth them  Job  that they cannot do the things they had appointed them to do  Gen  and  and    and    Revelat      O Lord I know the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps  Jerem  Psalm  Prov    A man's heart deviseth his way but the Lord directeth his steps  Prov  The preparation of the heart and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord  Prov  The heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of waters he turneth it whithersoever he will  Prov  Man his days are determined  Jo  and the bounds of his habitation  Acts so are his Works and Sins  surely the wrath of man shall praise thee and the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain  Ps  Setting aside the Opinions and Conjectures of Mens devised Fables I am fully satisfied with the Testimony of the Word of God besides their own Testimony which is sufficient against themselves with which I see through the thick Darkness of the Inventions and Traditions of Men  Several Considerations that there is not to be a Punishment after this Life that shall never end  We do not find the Place of Hell mentioned in any of the six Days Work of God if it be a Place it is a created Place and so a Part of the Creation of God the Whale is mentioned in Scripture if there be a Place of Hell it is a greater thing and in that it is not found in the Creation of God it is a Ground to judge that it is of the Creation of Man a vain Imagination of Man for their Reasons prove it not nor do they agree amongst themselves of the Proof of it neither where it is nor what it is    Solomon  was wiser than all Men  King  yet he spake not any thing of the Torments of Hell nor of any Punishment never to end he spake from the Cedar to the Hysop he spake also of Beasts and Fouls of creeping  things and of Fishes v if he had known of any Hell and Torments there he would have spoken of that also  The  Jews  unto whom were committed the Oracles of God  Rom  to give unto us they have delivered no such thing to us nor do they believe any such thing for the  Hebrew  Doctors understand the seventh Day of seven thousand Years which is in the World to come he blessed because in the seven thousand Years all Souls shall be bound up in the Bundle of Life in the World to come  Aisnworth  on  Gen    a Day with the Lord is as a thousand years  Pet the  Jews  say as the World was made in six Days so it should continue six thousand Years and no more and that the seventh Day in the seven thousand Years in the World to come in which all Souls shall be blessed Also they say a good Man and a bad Man died afterwards One in a Vision saw the good Man walking in Gardens among pleasant Fountains of Water but the bad Man near a River and his Tongue reaching after Water but could not reach it  Talm  Jerus in  Chag  fol  Col  in that these things are received among them for Truth though they be but  Jewish  Fables yet by them we see evidently that they do not believe the Opinion of a Torment after this Life never to end The  Jews  and  Hebrew  Doctors were great Searchers of every Tittle of Scriptures and if it had been there to be seen they or their Prophets should have seen it  The Saints recorded in Scripture did not believe that there was to be a Punishment for any to endure never to end this appeareth because when they made a Confession of Sin and the Punishment due to them for the same they do not confess to have deserv'd any such Punishment they confess to us belongs confusion of Face  Dan  it's the Lord's Mercy we are not consumed  Lam  thou hast delivered me from Death  Psal    Chron    Nor do we find that they did ever give Thanks for any such Deliverance if they had known of any such Deliverance it could not but appear the greatest Deliverance any could enjoy and that it did require the greatest Acknowledgment and Thankfulness nor doth it appear that ever they did pray for or express any Desire of any such Deliverance in that they express neither it is a Ground to judge that they knew of no such Punishment and if there had been any such Deliverance they should have known it I should not have been hid from them they admired the  Deliverance of saving their Lives from Death as the greatest Deliverance  Ezek  the Kindness of the Lord not to Die  Sam    Do you believe that if  Moses  and  Paul  had believed that there was so great and exceeding Torment without end that in the least they would have wished or desired to be raced out of the Book of Life  Exod  and to be separated from Christ  Rom  to endure the said Torment without end I do not believe that they were willing so to suffer  Christ when on Earth spoke of the Destruction of  Jerusalem  which was to come and wept because they were to suffer that  Luk  he would much more have spoken of a Punishment never to end and wept for them that should suffer that if there had been any Punishment for any to endure  Because when God doth warn any from Sin from the Consideration of Punishment there is no mention of any Punishments but of those in this Life See  Cor  to they shall die of grievous Deaths  Jer    Chro    Cor  Death threatned  Ezek  and to  Titus  confounded that serve graven Images  Psal  a Punishment in this Life  Jerem  Death for Idolatry  Jer  the punishment of Idolatry set for an Example  Pet  be instructed lest my Soul depart from thee and I make thee desolate because of thy Sin▪  Mich  see  Jer  Abomination that makes desolate  Dan  he turned the Cities of  Sodom  and  Gomorrah  into Ashes condemned them with an Overthrow making them an Example  Pet  he that threatned Death would have threatned a Punishment never to end if there had been such a Punishment to be inflicted upon any  Because God's Punishment of Sin is not of so large an extent as his Mercy for his punishing of Sin is but to the third and fourth Generation  Deut  thy Mercy is great above the Heavens and thy Truth unto the Skies  Psal  by Truth in this Place understand the Punishing of Sin because the Word  Mercy  is put in Opposition which lieth in forgiving Sin the Heavens are far above the Skies Astronomers say the Clouds and Skies are not above fifty Miles above the Earth but the Heavens are above a hundred and sixteen Millions of Miles above the Skies but the Mercyseat above  Exod  his Nam  is his Glory his Glory above the Heavens  Psal  Why is it said he punisheth the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children to the third and fourth Generation and not to  tenth and twentieth Generation but to declare  is satisfied therewith and requireth not a further Punishment God doth punish Sin in the Sinner and upon his Children to the third and fourth Generation but because there is not to be a Punishment after this Life never to end Because Death and the fear of it is call'd the Terror of God  Gen  the King of Terrors  Job  therefore Death is the greatest Punishment and more terrible but if there were to be a Punishment never to end nor Death but that were the King of Terrors for is not terrible at all in Comparison of that Because Sin is punished in this Life to the full if you will believe God he saith according to their Works and Doings I punished them  Ezek  ▪  Hos  and  Jer  and  Jer    Job  every Transgression received a just Recompence of Reward  Heb  Would ye have it to be punished to the full in this Life and after in the World to come with a Punishment never to end That Sin is punish'd in this Life see  Isa  to  Deut    Mich    Hag    Lamen  I'll punish the World for their Iniquity they shall fall by the Sword  Isa  to outward Calamity and Death the Punishment of Sin  Lam    Pet  recompence their Sin to the full  Jer  for the Violence of the Sin of Man when all Flesh had corrupted his Way God saith I will destroy them with the Earth a Flood of Water to destroy all Flesh  Gen  to punish Sin twice is as disagreeable to Justice as to receive the Payment of one Debt twice  Because there is not a worse thing then the Dregs of God's Fury Anger and Wrath and these are poured out in this Life God doth not only begin to punish Sin in this Life but also finish it in this Life for it is said  He poured out all his fierce Anger he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation  Psal Death so  it was poured out  Esa Ezek  Accomplished my fury  Ezek  it consumed them  Ezek  for yet a very little while and mine indignation and anger shall cease in their destruction  Jer  Wrath past  Job  taken away all  Psal  he hath poured out all his Anger  Lam Zeph  the punishment of their iniquity is accomplished  Lam Ezek  and    and    the dregs of the Cup of my Fury accomplished  Ezek therefore there is no Continuance of it after this Life for when  Achan  was dead it is said the Lord turned from the Fierceness of his Anger  Jos  but if that they say were true his Death was but the Beginning of the Lord's fierce Anger  Many infallible Proofs that there is not to be a Punishment after this Life never to end  Proof  I Because the Scriptures hold forth no such thing as hath been shewed we ought not to presume above that which is written revealed things belong to us  Deut    Pooof  II Their Opinion of a Punishment never to end is contrary to the Word of God in that it doth maintain that the Wicked shall have Eternal Life If Man was to live for ever why was the flaming Sword set to keep the Way of the Tree of Life  Gen  Left he put forth his Hand and take of the Tree of Life and live for ever No Eternal Life came by the first  Adam  Eternal Life came by Jesus Christ who is the Tree of Life Eternal Life promised and given by Jesus Christ Eternal Life by Jesus Christ  Rom  and he that eateth of this Bread shall live for ever  John  Because I live ye shall live also  John    God sent his Son that we might live through him    John  only Believers have Eternal Life  he that believeth on the Son hath eternal iife he that believeth not the Son shall not see life  John  whosoever believeth shall not perish but have everlasting life  Jo  I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish  Jo  the wicked abide not for ever  John if ye Live after the Flesh ye shall die  Romans  him will God destroy in the  Greek it is corrupt  Cor the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish Foolishness  Thes  utterly perish  Pet    Luke  to their own Destruction  Pet  abideth in Death  Rom  they shall be destroyed for ever  Psal    John  If they perish and have not eternal Life then they cannot live for ever God said  Gen  if thou eatest thou shalt surely die but the Serpent said  Gen  ye shalt not die so the Serpent which is the Devil hath taught Men to say as the Serpent said Now they have eaten they shall not die but shall live  for ever and never die which is to say God is the Liar and that which the Devil said is Truth The Word saith  Him will God destroy  Matth Cor  and    they shall be destroyed  Pet  Swift destruction their end is destruction  Phil their Opinion saith they shall never be destroyed die nor end which is no Destruction The Word saith the last Enemy is Death  Cor  Their Opinions saith that is not the last there is an after that is much worse never to end It saith God's Anger is for ever he will never turn from it contrary to  Jer    Psal    and and Mr  Bolton  saith they shall suffer so long as God is God if so then they have eternal Life though in Misery whereas the Scripture doth not declare eternal Life to be for all Men  John    Promised us eternal life  John  I give unto them eternal life to as many as thou hast given him  John  in hope of eternal life  John  As many as were ordained to eternal life believed  Act  they that have done good unto the resurrection of life  John If it be granted that the Wicked have not eternal Life as hath been proved it will follow that they cannot suffer for ever so long as God is God and therefore all their building of a Punishment never to end fails grant the first and the later must needs follow  If  Adam  had not sinned he should have died this is proved first because  Adam  in his Creation had a natural Body  Cor  that which is natural is not eternal  v  he was of the Earth earthly therefore mortal and corruptible  Secondly Man in his first being was corporal and visible to be seen things seen are not eternal Mr  Bolton  saith If  Adam  had stood he could not have conveyed to us a Body immortal or not dying in his Treatise of Heaven Page  Basil  saith if God had given  Adam  an immutable and unchangeable Nature he had created a God and not a  Man Augustine  in his Book of  Confessions  saith because the Lord created a Man of nothing therefore he left in Man a Possibility to return into nothing if he obeyed not the Will of his Maker  Thirdly Man in Innocency needed Food  c  that which depends upon mutable and earthly Things is earthly and mutable we see it in all other Creatures that live upon perishing things at last perish and herein Man by the first  Adam  hath no Preeminence above a Beast Heaven  and Earth were created therefore had a Beginning and although they have a much longer Life than Man are to have an end Heaven and Earth shall be dissolved  Pet    If  Adam  had not died  Rom  he should have continued in this World he should not have gone to the World to come therefore by his Fall he lost no Happiness nor eternal Life in that World for he could not by that Fall lose more than he had and was to have Death is according to Nature but to attain Immortality is above Nature  Adam  being Earth and from the Earth his Enjoyment Life and Loss and Punishment must of necessity be earthly how cometh he then by his Fall to be capable of a Punishment never to end unless by his Fall he could purchase eternal Life which none will affirm Eternal Life cannot be by the first Man much less by Sin  I deny not but the  wages of sin is death  Rom There is difference to be put between a natural Death and a judicial Death the first is from nature the second is from Sin if the common Death that all die  Heb  were the Punishment of Sin as most Men think then Christ by freeing his from the Punishment of Sin by bearing Death for them of Necessity he must free them from dying a natural Death but Christ freeth not his from a natural Death yet freeth them from the Punishment of Sin therefore to die the common Death is no Part of the Punishment of Sin For where Sin is satisfied or pardoned or forgiven the Punishment is not inflicted if it be how is it forgiven Even Men when they pardon inflict not the Punishment all confess some Mens Sins are pardoned how then cometh it to pass that they die for Sin whose Sin is pardoned He that keepeth my saying shall not see Death  John  is not to be referred to a natural Death but to perish a judicial Death  John  the Scripture declares that there shall be a Resurrection of the Dead the Just and Unjust  Acts  the Unjust would enter into Life but shall not  John  Unto whom I swore in my Wrath that they should not enter into my Rest  Psal    Heb  and your selves thrust out  Luke  when they rise to Judgment at the last Day they shall be consumed with the Earth by Fire that's their End so that not to enter to be thrust out the second Death and to perish is one thing if they live for ever and have eternal Life how do they perish and how  is the End of those things Death  Rom  if there be no End to be carnally minded is Death  Rom  How is this true if they live  orever and not die  Sin being a Transgression of the Law is a legal Sin and so i  to have a legal Punishment For some Sins is Death  Rom  inflicted by God as  Gen  and by Man A legal Death is not from Nature but from Sin and is a Second Death if a Man for Murder be put to Death in dying he dieth the first and second Death for in dying he dieth a natural Death and a judicial Death This later is a second Death in that it is no  from Nature but from Sin  Men put the Stress of the Punishment of Sin upon the second Death but what that second Death is they cannot agree among themselves the Ministers in their late Annotations on the Bible on  Revel  on such the second Death hath no Power interpret it not to be destroyed by Antichrist nor by the  Turk  v so then according to their Inte  pretation it is not a Punishment never to end Mr  Perkins  saith the second Death is a total Separation from God if so it is not a Punishment without End and in that God is every where  Psal  if they be any where how are they absent from God  If the second Death be a Death it is not a Life of Misery never to end that is not a Death unless eternal Life be a Death they confess eternal Life in Misery is worse than Death if so then it is not a Death but another thing  The first Death is the Destruction of the Body a Separation of Soul and Body the second Death must be like it the second Death is an Image of the first else how is it a Death and a second Dea  h the second  Adam  being Man was an Image of the first the Scriptures saith  the second death is like the first  Luke the second is like to it  Matth  Therefore as the first Death so the second is a separation of Soul and Body else how is it a Death or a second Death  Reuben  by going into his Father's Bed deserved a judicial legal Death but did not die for it  Gen  and Chron let  Reuben  live and not die  Deut  a judicial or second Death The  Jews Onkelos  read  Deut  let  Reuben  live and not die the second Death and  Jonathan  on  Isa  I will deliver their Carkasses to the second Death  vers  the Lord will slay them  with the second Death by which it appears the  Jews  count the second Death is to be slain and if so it is not a Life of Misery never to end as some say the Book of the  Revelation  speaks of the second Death Dr  Featly  and Dr  Lightfoot  and others say that Book treats of the Church and things done in this World and if so then the second Death is a Punishment of this Life they also interpret Heaven in that Book to be the Church and the late Annotations on the Bible and Mr  Brightman  and others on  Apoc  say that the Devil in that Place is the great  Turk    It is their Opinion that say the Wages of Sin is not Death they say it is a Life of Misery never to end which is worse and more than Death therefore their Opinion is contrary to the Word that saith it is Death filled with all Unrighteousness haters of God despiteful proud Inventers of evil things they that commit such things are worthy of Death  Rom  these are great Sinners yet the Word saith not that they are worthy of more then Death and therefore why should any say they are worth of more then Death And if the End of these things are Death  Rom  therefore there is not any thing to come after Death  Kings  the Soul that Sinneth shall die  Ezek  that is all that Sin doth bring forth God in giving his Law did express the Punishment of the Breach of it saying in the Day that thou eatest of that Tree thou shalt surely die  Gen  dying thou shalt do that is naturally and judiciously not touch it left ye die  Gen  to bear Iniquity is to dye for it  Levit    Numb  that one Man die for the People  John  the Body is dead because of Sin  Rom  he that is dead is freed from Sin  Rom  neither Sin nor Punishment hath any thing to do with a dead Man This Iniquity shall not be purged from ye till ye die then it is purged from them if this Iniquity be purged from you till ye die we learn that Death acquitteth  Talm Jerus Sanched  Fol  Col    After Man had sinned God expounded the Punishment of the Breach of his Law  Gen  to v It is evident that the Punishment of the old Serpent the Devil and of the Woman and of the Man for their Sin are only Punishments of this Life there is not the least Word of any punishment after this Life much less of a Punishment never to end so that by that which is said  we may judge of that Mr  Bolton  and others say of being everlastingly in a redhot scorching Fire deprived of all Possibility of dying or of being ever consumed in Torment eternally they say the Fire of Hell burneth far hotter than ten thousand Rivers of Brimstone how know they it seeing they never felt it nor they that told you so Three drops of Brimstone will make one so full of Torment that one cannot forbear roaring out for Pain yet it must be born so long as God is God O Eternity Eternity Eternity If so they shall have Eternal Life which is contrary to the Scripture as hath been shewed and is therefore to be rejected also they say that the Soul of the Wicked goes immediately at Death to Hell to the Devil contrary to  Eccles  and  Gen    Heb    Ezek    Zach  if the Devils are in Hell in Torment as they commonly and vainly imagine Hell is in the Wicked the Devil's evil Spirits are there and rule there in the Children of Disobedience  Eph    Pet    Matth    Jud    Matth    Adam  in Innocency being a natural Man he had the Law of Nature written in his Heart the Breach of that natural Law caused a temporal Curse and Punishment and not any Eternal they that think eternal Life is to be had for our Works our well doing are prone to think eternal Life may be lost for our not well doing but the Way of the Gospel places not eternal Life and eternal Death in Misery upon our doing  Rom  Also the Scripture speaketh not of an eternal Death and therefore there is no such thing  Proof  III Their Opinion of a Punishment after this Life never to end makes not Sin but Christ to be the Cause of their so suffering This is evident because if Christ had not come there had been no Resurrection and if no Resurrection there could be no suffering of any Torment after this Life For if no Resurrection they should have perished in the Grave their had been their End If Christ be not risen they which are fallen asleep are perished  Cor  that the Resurrection came by Jesus Christ is also evident for Christ saith I am the Resurrection  John  By Man that is Christ came the Resurrection  ver  Therefore it is called the Resurrection of Jesus Christ  Pet  His Resurrection  Romans    Philippians    Pet  Christ is called the Firstfruits because he first rose from the Dead after him others if Christ had not risen no Man should ever have risen from the Dead therefore it is said They came out of his Graves after their Resurrection  Mat  and in that Christ is the Resurrection and the Cause of it in that it came by him sure none will deny that if there had been no Resurrection from the Dead there could be no Suffering after Death so long as God is God therefore it follows if any Man shall so suffer Christ is the Cause of it for without him they could not have lived for ever and therefore not suffer for ever and is it not very hard and unreasonable and contrary to the Word to charge Christ to be the Cause of their so Suffering seeing Christ came in love to the World  John  to save not to destroy  Luke  and not to make any miserable he came to save Sinners  Tim    Luke  he rose again for our satisfaction therefore if none can so suffer unless Christ be the Cause of it there is no such Punishment for any to endure never to end  Proof  IV The Scriptures declare what Christ came to do namely to deliver us from the hand of our Enemies  Luke  to taste Death for every Man  Heb  See  Luke  the last Enemy is Death he abolished Death  Tim  he hath promised Deliverance from Death and Grave I will redeem thee from Death  Hosea  that keeps my Sayings shall not see Death  John  O Death where is thy Sting O Grave where is thy Victory  Cor  I will ransom thee from the Power of the Grave he saith not from the Torments of Hell nor from the Punishment never to end O Death I will be thy Plagues O Grave I will be thy Destruction  Hos  so that if there be a Punishment after Death and Grave there is no mention of Christ's delivering us from that and in that the Scripture s  ith He is able to save from Death  Heb  is as much as to say Salvation from Death is sufficient and that there is no farther thing to be delivered from than Death and Grave if there were deliverance from them had not been satisfactory because not sufficient for if there is to be a Punishment after Death who shall deliver us from that Christ delivereth from Death and Grave no further Deliverance  from any thing is mentioned therefore he hath not delivered his from more and therefore there is no further thing to be delivered from so that ye may see that their Opinion makes void Christ's Suffering and the Saints Comfort for if a Punishment for ever be due to Man for Sin Christ must for ever suffer that Torment to free us from it or we must suffer it The Protestant Writers confess that the Way and Means that Christ freeth us from the Punishment of Sin is by his Suffering that Punishment we were to suffer To this the Scriptures agree  Gal    Isa  so that if Christ our Surety hath not suffered the said Torments for ever then hath not Christ suffered enough namely that which we were to suffer and so not delivered us from the said Punishment That Jesus Christ hath not so suffered is evident and confessed by the Protestant Writers some of the Protestants say the Rep  obates in Hell suffer the want of the Vision or Sight of God for ever fina  Rejection They shall be perplexed with the Horror of a guilty Conscience Deprived of the Gifts of the Holy Spirit Instead of Vertues they are defiled with Wickedness Indignation Desperation Christ suffered none of these saith  Willets Synopsis  pag far it be from us so to conceive Pag also they say in Hell is inward and outward Darkness A Lake of Fire and Brimstone Fire unquenchable Worm and prick of Conscience Malediction Desperation second Death Christ suffered none of these therefore Christ suffered not the Torments of Hell to be ever in the  e in that Place they will not say Christ is now in if Christ had suffered the Pains of the Damned yet unless he suffer them without end Christ suffered not the Punishment of the Damned in Hell which they say we were to suffer also they say they suffer not those Torments without Sin and Desperation Will any say Christ so suffered also They say in Hell they shall see the Story of their Sins before their Eyes the Wrath of God lying upon them for their Sins cruel Indignation horrible Outcries Blasphemies fretting for horrible Torments endless Pains without all Hope or Comfort Who dare say Christ suffered any of these Some that are for the Torments of Hell confess that it stands not with the Dignity and Worthiness of Christ's Person nor with the Holiness of his Nature nor the Dignity of his Office to  suffer in that local Place eternally final Rejection with Desperation with the Worm of Conscience agreeth not to the Holiness of his Person final Rejection Christ suffered not nor eternal Flames nor the second Death For Christ to suffer these were to destroy the Work of our Redemption Christ could not be subject to Destruction  Willet Synops  Page Christ suffered none of these Punishments therefore he suffered not the Torments of Hell  Christ was heard in that he feared Christ  did not fear the Torments of Hell therefore he did not partake with us nor deliver us from them Christ not deliver us from any thing which he suffered not eternal Fire in Hell He suffered not nor are the Pains of this Life the Pains of Hell therefore if there be any such Hell or Punishment Christ suffered it not and therefore we must suffer it see ye not whither this their Doctrine tends To overthrow the sufficiency of Christ's Suffering and our Comfort in leaving us to suffer the said Torments ourselves  Christ leaving his suffering an example if we suffer with him  c Rom Must we suffer the Torments of Hell I believe Christ hath born the whole Punishment of Sin in it I am satisfied and desire no more but how Christ suffered the Torments of Hell I nor themselves see not They say Christ being God made an infinite Satisfaction paying at once upon the Cross that which we should have been ever a paying I grant Christ is God but the Godhead did not nor could not suffer if the Godhead of Christ was to make satisfaction to God is to say God satisfieth God and if Christ as God was to make satisfaction to what purpose was Christ to be made Man and die If ye say Christ was to make satisfaction in both his Godhead and Manhood doth the Godhead need the help of the Manhood to make satisfaction It is not proper to say God was to be satisfied for God was never unsatisfied God is perfect infinite happy unchangeable How is he so if he were ever unsatisfied To say God is or ever was unsatisfied is in effect to deny the Being of God to say he is not happy for Satisfaction and Content belong to Happiness where there is no Satisfaction there is no Content because no Perfection  God is one to us there is but one God God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself    Cor  That is Father Word and Spirit  God is one  not one Divine Nature in Christ satisfying  and another in the Father satisfied but the Father in the Son  God in Christ  the Essence of God is one and the same  reconciling the World to himself  God was never unreconciled to the World it's only Man that is at enmity and unreconciled therefore it is said  He reconciled them to him  the Change is in the Creature not in God  Mal  If the Manhood of Christ was to make satisfaction to God how can Man that is finite sati  fie that which is infinite unless you will affirm the Godhead of Christ did suffer there was not any thing to suffer but the Manhood of Christ Can the suffering of Man satisfie God Man is finite so is all he doth  Sin is a transgression of the Law  Sin is a Disorder of the Creatures first and chief Being which stands in Righteousness and is an Eclipse of the Glory of Man Sin is a Defect and Discovery of the Weakness and Mutability of the reasonable Creature Sin cannot impeach God  If thou sinnest what doest thou against him Or if thy righteousness be multiplied what doest thou unto him If thou be righteous what givest thou unto him or what receiveth he at thy hand Thy wickedness may hurt a Man as thou art and thy righteousness profit the Son of Man  Job God hath all Satisfaction in and from himself not from any thing without or besides himself God gave not a Law to himself to satisfie but to Man the Law belongs only to the humane Nature therefore Christ was a Man  He took on him the form of a servant and became obedient to death the death of the Cross  Phil  a body  Heb Obedience belongs to the humane Will  The man Christ made a curse for us he was bruised for our iniquities and with his stripes we are healed  Isa it was Blood that washed away our Sins Rev Therefore it is said  By the obedience of one  man  we are made righteous  Rom the Word saith not by the Obedience of God nor of God Man God is satisfied but by  the obedience of one man we are made righteous the Man Christ Jesus  Tim the Worthiness of Christ's Person did not abolish the Equity of the Law of God and exempt him from suffering that he  ought to suffer  Luke Some say the suffering of Christ was infinite but the Word saith not so the Punishment of Sin is Death he  tasted death  he died for us it is no infinite thing to die They reply the Sin of Man is infinite because against an infinite God to say Sin is infinite in a  strict Sense is to attribute too much to Sin and too little to God to give that to Sin which is proper to God to equal Sin with God is in effect to deny the Being of God because there can be but one infinite also to say Sin is infinite is to make all Sin alike equal for there is no Degrees in that which is infinite Sin not being infinite needs not an infinite Satisfaction They say infinite Majesty offended infinite Punishment opposed but it's but their say so because it is without and besides the Word of God The Punishment of Sin is not to be taken from the infiniteness of God but from the Penalty expressed in his Law for the Breach of it which is Death  Genesis    Proof  V The Word saith God's  fury is like fire in the fire of his jealousie he shall make a speedy riddance of all them in the day of the Lords wrath  Ezek but to continue in Torment for ever is no speedy  Riddance  therefore there is no such Punishment to be The pouring out of the fiery Anger of the Lord  is a day  Zeph Rom Ezek and James Isa  the day of the Lord is at hand  Deut Job a Punishment never to end no ways agrees to  a day  Therefore there is no such punishment to be  Proof  VI The Opinion of the Torments of Hell never to end hath and doth daily cause much Sin For  First It causeth Fear  Fear hath punishment  John  He that feareth is not perfect in love  John a servile and a slavish Fear is Sin  It causeth many evil and hard Thoughts of God  Fear troubleth the Hearts of many of the Lord's People and makes them sad with their Lyes this God complains of  Ezek    their lies cause them to err after which their Fathers walked Amos  Christ saith  Let not your Hearts be troubled  John the fear of Hell doeth greatly trouble the Hearts of many it is Gods Will to comfort the sad to release those that are bound  Isa  and  a word fitly spoken is like apples of Gold in pictures in Silver  Prov  Fear distracts and greatly discourageth the Soul hinders Faith that which freeth the Soul from Fear fits the Soul to serve  God without fear in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives  Luke  Fear unfits and disableth the Soul to every good Work to God or Man Fear unfits for any outward occasion Fear is a weight that depresses the Soul and makes it  weak it straitneth the Heart but Hope comforteth and enlargeth it  The Opinion of Hell Torments provokes the Soul to envy and Unbelief and hinders Subjection to God if the Soul apprehends it self liable to so great and everlasting Punishment it cannot submit to God nor be quiet This caused  Francis Spira  to wish he were above God The Light of this Truth causeth the Soul less to sin and less to be troubled to have less hard Thoughts of God and less to fret against the Lord  Their Opinion causes an exceeding and unreasonable trouble of Mind and melancholy such Trouble is Sin  John  a merry heart doeth good  Prov  the Knowledge of the Truth herein easeth the fearful Mind and causes as it were a Heaven upon Earth  Their Opinion hath caused many to murder themselves in taking away their own Lives by Poyson Stabbing Drowning Hanging Strangling and Shooting themselves casting themselves out of Windows and from high Places to break their Necks and by other Deaths that they might not live to encrease their Sin and encrease their Torments in Hell  Their Opinion provoketh to the greatest Sins as Despair Also to the Wickedness that the World lieth in namely working for Life to do Duties to escape Hell and get Heaven which is to  tread under foot the blood of Christ as an unholy thing  Heb in seeking to be justified by the Law of Works and not alone by the perfect Righteousness of Jesus Christ  Rev    Jer    Heb    Freedom from Fear causeth Love Love causeth Service  the love of Christ constraineth  it tends to the Comfort of many that through Weakness of Faith give way to Satans Temptations to fear the Torments of Hell causeth a feeble Mind  comfort the feeble mind  Thes Its a comfort to many whose Children and Friends die and leave no Testimony of their Conversion the Fear that they are to suffer so great and endless Torment hath greatly sadded and troubled the Heart of many a Parent and Friend  Proof  VII The Reason that God gives that  he will not contend for ever nor be always wroth for the spirit would fail before me and the souls I have made  Isa Man is  not able to dwell with everlasting burning  Isa  to be in so great a Torment as they speak of without End Ease and Refreshment the Spirit must needs fail a small thing will make the Spirit fail if so then the Reason is the same against the being of a Punishment never to end  Proof  VIII It is not agreeable to the God of Nature to go contrary to the Law of Nature that he hath written in Mankind there is planted in Man an universal Love to Man especially to their Offspring be they obedient or disobedient what Bowels of Love is there in Parents to their Offspring when in Misery and to others in Misery and Want Sure no Man doth desire any Man nor Creature to indure the Torment they speak of one Year much less their own Offspring how then may I or can I think so of God to be less pitiful less merciful then cruel Man  Jer  and  Hos  to his Offspring we are all his Offspring  Acts  sure God exceeds Man in Goodness if ye which are evil know how to give good things to your Children how much more shall your heavenly Father give good Things to them that ask him  Matth  Thou Lord art good and doest good  Psal    Matth  though they were evil and did evil God did good and gave Rain  Acts  They say the Fire  Dan  is nothing to Hell and that the greatest Torment Man can devise is scarce a Shadow to that in Hell by which they declare God to be more cruel than Man  Proof  IX If Man had deserved so great punishment why may not God shew that mercy as not to inflict it as well as to let his Sun to shine and his Rain to fall on them that no way deserve it seeing he could if he so pleased hinder it we do see Men shew more kindness to a rebellious and disobedient Child then he deserveth may not God do the same so much as God is greater than Man so much greater is his Mercy Love and Goodness than that in Man yea than that that is or ever was in all Men all that came from him and all is but the least drop to that great Sea and Ocean of Mercy and Love that is in him how little a portion is heard of him  Job  All Nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing Vanity  Isaiah    O how great is he that hangeth the Earth upon nothing  Job  he can and will do for the worst Creature far above that which it is able to ask or think  Proof  X Because God's general Goodness in the Creation of the World is to all his Creatures and also in his ordinary dispensation is towards and for the whole Universe of Mankind he hath provided room enough for all Men and Creatures and all good things for all the profit of the Earth is for all  Eccles  God hath commanded us to do good to all he that hath two Coats is to impart to him that hath none and he that hath Meat must do so likewise  Luke  all which doth hold forth God's good Will and Care to Mankind he that would not have them suffer the Torment of Misery and Want that taketh care to prevent that little and short Misery will not impose a far greater never to end  Proof  XI Their Opinion lesseneth the Goodness of God and limiteth to a few whereas the Scripture declares it to be to all  Rom  The Creature it self shall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God  Rom  The whole Creation and every Creature is Angels and Men  Jews  and  Gentiles  verse  Mark  in Bondage to Corruption subject to Vanity Idolatry and Delusion of the Devil that know not nor partake of the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God shall be delivered from this Bondage into the said Liberty for God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself  Cor  This is spoken to perswade them to be reconciled to God verse which shews it to concern Mankind the Protestants in  Poland  understand by every Creature Angels and Men they say there willcome a time when the Angels and wickedest Men shall be freed  Origen  one of the Fathers held that at last all should be saved Men and Devils the generality of the Fathers held that all Souls shall be purged by Fire of the last Judgment and so pass to Salvation  Moulin  pag see  Rom  All Flesh shall see the Salvation of God  Rom  see  Tim    Isaiah  The Glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all Flesh shall see it  Isa  the times of the restitution of all things God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets since the World began  Acts  they shall in time be delivered  from their Bondage for which deliverance they groan are not all Angels and Men obedient or disobedient the Creation of God if so the worst shall partake of the liberty of the Sons of God as the whole Creation came from God or rather is in God for in him we live it shall be taken up into the same Glory a good the larger it is the better if it be good to shew Mercy to some is it not more good to have mercy on all  Rom    Plato  could say God being a supreme Good there was no Envy in him to any of his Creatures but rather a desire that all might be made like him This is so great and glorious a discovery of God and that all Men are in God for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own Poets have said for we are all his offspring  Acts  I have wondred how the Heathen Poets came to know this Truth sure God did manifest it to them If all Men are in God all Men are in Christ for Christ saith I and my Father are one  John  Also if all Men are in God for in him we live and move  c  if so then all Men are in Christ for God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself  Cor  All confess that all that are in Christ shall be saved as in  Adam  all die so in Christ shall all be made alive  Cor  I see God is good and doth good and that it is suitable to the Being of God to do good to all and that no such torment of such continuance any way agrees to the Mind and Will of God  Romans  Puts the second  Adam  in opposition to the first in saving to his sinning if all Nations be blessed as  Gen  every particular is comprehended in the general word  All  it is a great lessening of the Greatness and Glory of the Fulness and Riches of God's Grace to say that God hath made this World for all who are many and the best World to come but for a very few shall the Fruit of Christ the Son of Righteousness be more narrow and confined than the Sun in the Firmament whose excellency is that its bright Rays and beams are dispersed into every corner of the Universe  Proof  XII It doth no way agree to the Spirit of a Saint we may know the mind of a Saint we have the mind of Christ  Cor  He that is turned to the Lord is one Spirit  Cor  God is in them of a truth  Cor  Christ in us  Col    Stephen  when stoned cryed Lord  lay not this sin to their charge  Acts  Saints they are ever merciful  Psalm  The desire of the righteous is only good  Prov  Such Torment of such continuance in the last agree not to the gracious mind and merciful heart of a Saint he desires not any Man nor Creature to be in such Torment an Hour therefore it doth no way agree to the Mind of God we find the more the Lord manifests himself in any the more their Minds and Spirit are humb  ed the more living and merciful they are even to their Enemies and can do them Good for Evil  Proof  XIII Such Torments do not in the least agree to the Mind and Will of Christ Christ is full of Love and Mercy to the worst Men it was truly said of Christ He was a friend to Publicans and Sinners He the best friend to them that ever was when they crucified him he said Father forgive them  Luke  When the Disciples would have had Fire to come down from Heaven to consume Christ's Enemies he rebuked them  Luke  He that will by no means suffer his Enemies to suffer a short Death by Fire will not inflict upon them a more terrible Fire never to end ye may know the mind of God by the mind of Christ for Christ is God alike equal  Acts    Heb  and as one I and my Father are one  John    Proof  XIV Such Punishments agree not to the Fruits of the holy and blessed God the Fruit of the Spirit is Love Joy Peace Goodness  c    Gal  the fruit of the Spirit is in all Goodness  Eph  The words of the Lord are pure words  Psal  The words of the pure are pleasant words  Prov  good words comfortable words the holy Spirit is called a Comforter not a Tormenter the pure Spirit of Love sends forth only Love and Sweetness  Proof  XV No such torment no way agrees to the nature of God God is Love  John  it is his nature there is no anger nor fury in love fury is not in me  Isa  God wills us to love enemies that abuse wrong and hate us God will do so much more love his enemies  Luke  If God should only love them that love him  do not the Publicans the same  Mat  All that is in God is God as infinite God is love love is infinite without bounds and limits though we in our shallowness and narrowness have often set bounds and limits to infiniteness there was never any beginning in God therefore no beginning of his love the infinite blessed God is one and ever the same I am the Lord I change not  Mich  This love delights in mercy and love and not in punishing of Sin That is his strange act  Isa  Christ died to answer the Law we broke  Christ did not purchase the love of God he loved us before the World began and ever will  John  God was never without his love nor is ever out of that love Christ saith thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me  John  at what shall God be angry or unsatisfied for God was never angry with Christ nor his People nor at the being of Sin nor at Christ taking our Sins upon him for he laid them on him the iniquity of us all  Isa    Proof  XVI It is not suitable to the mercifulness of a Father to his Child of a Creator to his Creature the work of his hands to impose so great a punishment without end upon any of them that were worse then to forsake the works of his hands and is contrary to  Psal  Your heavenly Father is merciful  Luke  rich in mercy  Eph  the Lord is gracious of great m  rcy the Lord is good to all and his tender mercies over all his works all thy works shall praise thee and thy Saints shall bless thee  Psal  he is good to all he despiseth not any  Job  no respecter of persons  Acts    Proof  XVII Sin cannot overcome his love where Sin hath abounded grace abounds muth more  Rom  this declares the mercy of God to be greater then sin if so the grace of God is to all to the worst for Sin ab  urds in them most and where Sin abounds Grace abou  s much more if so then all their Sins shall be forgiven and if any were so to suffer how hath Grace abounded to them much more where Sin hath abounded answer this if ye can with the Lord there is mercy  Psal  the Lord is good to all therefore to the worst of Men his  tender Mercy are over all his Works therefore to the worst of Men also for they are the Work of his Hands  Job    Isa  therefore there is no punishment for any to endure never to end he that bids us not to be overcome with evil but to overcome evil with good he will not be overcome with evil but will overcome all evil with his infinite Goodness that which is finite cannot possibly overcome that which is infinite  Proof  XVIII God he is just therefore he will not do any thing but that which is just and right the greatest Punishment of the breach of his law is death he will not inflict another much less a worser punishment then he hath expressed in his Law Justice is in number weight and measure God requires things equal ye may see the mind of God in his command in forbidding any thing to be done but that which is equal and suitable to the fact as eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot stripe for stripe  Exod    How much she hath glorified her self and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her  Rev  What measure you mete to others shall be measured to you again  Murder an horrible and grievous Sin yet it is punished with an equal Punishment in this Life Life for Life he that sheddeth Man's Blood by Man shall his Blood be shed  Gen  Life for Life is equal but to lose Life for Life and also to suffer so great torment never to end is not equal  Proof  XIX It is no profit nor pleasure to God for any to suffer such endless torment he hath no pleasure in the death of any  Ezek  much less can it be any pleasure to him for any so to suffer he desires Mercy and not Sacrifice  Mich  if so he desires not any should be so sacrificed in a Torment never to end God abhors cruelty  Anos  and casting off Pity  Proof  XX It is not for the glory of God to impose such a punishment upon any glory lieth not in imposing great and terrible punishments that belongs to cruelty is abhored by the light of nature Glory lieth in great mercy and forgivene's  Exod  the greater mercy and forgiveness the greater is the grace and the more is it to the glory of God love covereth all sins  Prov  he that covereth transgression seeketh love  Pro  if  man  his glory is to  pass over transgression  Prov  it is for the glory of God to do so much more God made all things and doth all things for his glory he seeketh his glory in his exceeding greatness and riches of his grace  Ephes  it is more for his glory to save all then to save a few the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life  Rom  sin could not hinder  Manasses Mary Magdalen  persecutors and wicked prodigals to find mercy I cannot admit to think any thing that is cruel to be in God in love whose goodness is unsearchable past finding out far above all we can ask or think there is such a confused noise among men of the grace and love of God so many several voices that we are in confusion and know not what to make of it look above and hearken to the sweet voice above in the Region of love what is the voice in Heaven they agree in one there is no voice comes from Heaven but love peace and good will to man let men say what they will I rest satisfied in the voice above that is only a voice of love and good will its enough to satisfie any in this doubt and suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of Heavenly Hosts praising God and saying glory be to the highest on earth peace and good will to men  Luke  not only to some men but to all people  v  this is glad tidings indeed good news from Heaven the best news that ever was that God hath good will to men there is no ill will all is good will to men this causeth peace and praise glory be to the highest for his sweet peace and good will to men to all people  Conclusion in reading the Scriptures we are not to understand any text in such sense as is not plain in Scriptures or contrary to Scriptures or contrary to the Law of nature or against the general Goodness of God to Mankind or to lessen the Goodness of God or contrary to the gracious Spirit and mercifulness of a Saint or contrary to the mind of Christ which he declared when on Earth or contrary to the fruits of the blessed Spirit the nature of the Love Goodness and Mercy of God or that shall tend to contradict or lessen the glory of God or lessen the greatness and riches of his grace for it is not to be imagined that God who is only wise should do and teach contrary things  Sure I am from hence arise no inconveniency to the Gospel nor is it any dishonour to God nor any grief nor hinders  faith and love in any good man nor any discouragement to any in serving of God that there is not to be a punishment for any to endure that shall never end There is not any thing more plain than that which hath been said to him that will agree to truth some will not agree to any thing though never so plain and certain if contrary to the tradition of their Fathers this their way is their folly and their posterity approve their sayings Psal who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed  Isa    Some believed the things that were spoken and some believed not  Acts  they make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn away the just for a thing of nought  Isa    O God the Lord the strength of my salvation thou hast co+vered my head in the day of battel  Psal    So be it
