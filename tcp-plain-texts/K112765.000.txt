Woe  When first  Distress  with Dagger keen  Broke forth to waste his destin'd Scene  His wild unsated Foe    By  Pella  's  Euripides  of whom  Aristotle  pronounces on a Comparison of him with  Sophocles  That he was the greater Master of the tender Passions    Bard a magic Name  By all the Griefs his Thought could frame  Receive my humble Rite  Long  Pity  let the Nations view  Thy skyworn Robes of tend'rest Blue  And Eyes of dewy Light    But wherefore need I wander wide  To old  Ilissus'  distant Side  Deserted Stream and mute  Wild  Arun  The River  Arun  runs by the Village in  Sussex  where  Otway  had his Birth  too has heard thy Strains  And Echo 'midst my native Plains  Been sooth'd by  Pity's  Lute    There first the Wren thy Myrtles shed  On gentlest  Otway  's infant Head  To Him thy Cell was shown  And while He sung the Female Heart  With Youth's soft Notes unspoil'd by Art  Thy Turtles mix'd their own    Come  Pity  come by Fancy's Aid  Ev'n now my Thoughts relenting Maid  Thy Temple's Pride design  Its Southern Site its Truth compleat  Shall raise a wild Enthusiast Heat  In all who view the Shrine    There Picture's Toils shall well relate  How Chance or hard involving Fate  O'er mortal Bliss prevail  The Buskin'd Muse shall near her stand  And sighing prompt her tender Hand  With each disastrous Tale    There let me oft retir'd by Day  In Dreams of Passion melt away  Allow'd with Thee to dwell  There waste the mournful Lamp of Night  Till Virgin Thou again delight  To hear a  British  Shell  ODE to FEAR  THOU to whom the World unknown  With all its shadowy Shapes is shown  Who see'st appall'd th' unreal Scene  While Fancy lifts the Veil between  Ah  Fear  Ah frantic  Fear  I see I see Thee near  I know thy hurried Step thy haggard Eye  Like Thee I start like Thee disorder'd fly  For lo what  Monsters  in thy Train appear  Danger  whose Limbs of Giant Mold  What mortal Eye can fix'd behold  Who stalks his Round an hideous Form  Howling amidst the Midnight Storm  Or throws him on the ridgy Steep  Of some loose hanging Rock to sleep  And with him thousand Phantoms join'd  Who prompt to Deeds accurs'd the Mind  And those the Fiends who near allied  O'er Nature's Wounds and Wrecks preside  Whilst  Vengeance  in the lurid Air  Lifts her red Arm expos'd and bare  On whom that rav'ning  Alluding to the  of  Sophocles  See the ELECTRA  Brood of Fate  Who lap the Blood of Sorrow wait  Who  Fear  this ghastly Train can see  And look not madly wild like Thee  EPODE  In earliest  Grece  to Thee with partial Choice  The Grieffull Muse addrest her infant Tongue  The Maids and Matrons on her awful Voice  Silent and pale in wild Amazement hung  Yet He the Bard  Aeschylus  who first invok'd thy Name  Disdain'd in  Marathon  its Pow'r to feel  For not alone he nurs'd the Poet's flame  But reach'd from Virtue's Hand the Patriot's Steel  But who is He whom later Garlands grace  Who left awhile o'er  Hybla  's Dews to rove  With trembling Eyes thy dreary Steps to trace  Where Thou and  Furies  shar'd the baleful Grove  Wrapt in thy cloudy Veil th'  Incestuous Queen  Jocasta  Sigh'd the sad Call    See the Oedip Colon of  Sophocles  her Son and Husband hear'd  When once alone it broke the silent Scene  And He the Wretch of  Thebes  no more appear'd  O  Fear  I know Thee by my throbbing Heart  Thy with'ring Pow'r inspir'd each mournful Line  Tho' gentle  Pity  claim her mingled Part  Yet all the Thunders of the Scene are thine  ANTISTROPHE  Thou who such weary Lengths hast past  Where wilt thou rest mad Nymph at last  Say wilt thou shroud in haunted Cell  Where gloomy  Rape  and  Murder  dwell  Or in some hollow'd Seat  'Gainst which the big Waves beat  Hear drowning Seamen's Cries inTempests brought  Dark Pow'r with shudd'ring meek submitted Thought  Be mine to read the Visions old  Which thy awak'ning Bards have told  And lest thou meet my blasted View  Hold each strange Tale devoutly true  Ne'er be I found by Thee o'eraw'd  In that thricehallow'd Eve abroad  When Ghosts as CottageMaids believe  Their pebbled Beds permitted leave  And  Gobblins  haunt from Fire or Fen  Or Mine or Flood the Walks of Men  O Thou whose Spirit most possest  The sacred Seat of  Shakespear  's Breast  By all that from thy Prophet broke  In thy Divine Emotions spoke  Hither again thy Fury deal  Teach me but once like Him to feel  His  Cypress Wreath  my Meed decree  And I O  Fear  will dwell with  Thee  ODE to SIMPLICITY    O Thou by  Nature  taught  To breathe her genuine Thought  In Numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong  Who first on Mountains wild  In  Fancy  loveliest Child  Thy Babe or  Pleasure's  nurs'd the Pow'rs of Song    Thou who with Hermit Heart  Disdain'st the Wealth of Art  And Gauds and pageant Weeds and trailing Pall  But com'st a decent Maid  In  Attic  Robe array'd  O chaste unboastful Nymph to Thee I call    By all the honey'd Store  On  Hybla  's Thymy Shore  By all her Blooms and mingled Murmurs dear  By Her  The  or Nightingale for which  Sophocle  seems to have entertain'd a peculiar Fondness  whose Loveborn Woe  In Ev'ning Musings slow  Sooth'd sweetly sad  Electra  's Poet's Ear    By old  Cephisus  deep  Who spread his wavy Sweep  In warbled Wand'rings round thy green Retreat  On whose enamel'd Side  When holy  Freedom  died  No equal Haunt allur'd thy future Feet    O Sister meek of Truth  To my admiring Youth  Thy sober Aid and native Charms infuse  The Flow'rs that sweetest breathe  Tho' Beauty cull'd the Wreath  Still ask thy Hand to range their order'd Hues    While  Rome  could none esteem  But Virtue's Patriot Theme  You lov'd her Hills and led her Laureate Band  But staid to sing alone  To one distinguish'd Throne  And turn'd thy Face and fled her alter'd Land    No more in Hall or Bow'r  The Passions own thy Pow'r  Love only Love her forceless Numbers mean  For Thou hast left her Shrine  Nor Olive more nor Vine  shall gain thy Feet to bless the servile Scene    Tho' Taste tho' Genius bless  To some divine Excess  Faints the cold Work till Thou inspire the whole  What each what all supply  May court may charm our Eye  Thou only Thou can'st raise the meeting Soul    Of These let others ask  To aid some mighty Talk  I only seek to find thy temp'rate Vale  Where oft my Reed might sound  To Maids and Shepherds round  And all thy Sons O  Nature  learn my Tale  ODE on the POETICAL CHARACTER  AS once if not with light Regard  I read aright that gifted Bard  Him whose School above the rest  His Loveliest  Elfin  Queen has blest  One only One unrival'd Fair  Florimel  See  Spenser  Leg th    Might hope the magic Girdle wear  At solemn Turney hung on high  The Wish of each lovedarting Eye  Lo to each other Nymph in turn applied  As if in Air unseen some hov'ring Hand  Some chaste and AngelFriend to VirginFame  With whisper'd Spell had burst the starting Band  It left unblest her loath'd dishonour'd Side  Happier hopeless Fair if never  Her baffled Hand with vain Endeavour  Had touch'd that fatal Zone to her denied  Young  Fancy  thus to me Divinest Name  To whom prepar'd and bath'd in Heav'n  The Cest of amplest Pow'r is giv'n  To few the Godlike Gift assigns  To gird their blest prophetic Loins  And gaze her Visions wild and feel unmix'd her Flame    The Band as Fairy Legends say  Was wove on that creating Day  When He who call'd with Thought to Birth  Yon tented Sky this laughing Earth  And drest with Springs and Forests tall  And pour'd the Main engirting all  Long by the lov'd  Enthusiast  woo'd  Himself in some Diviner Mood  Retiring sate with her alone  And plac'd her on his Saphire Throne  The whiles the vaulted Shrine around  Seraphic Wires were heard to sound  Now sublimest Triumph swelling  Now on Love and Mercy dwelling  And she from out the veiling Cloud  Breath'd her magic Notes aloud  And Thou Thou richhair'd Youth of Morn  And all thy subject Life was born  The dang'rous Passions kept aloof  Far from the sainted growing Woof  But near it sate Ecstatic  Wonder    List'ning the deep applauding Thunder  And  Truth  in sunny Vest array'd  By whose the Tarsel's Eyes were made  All the shad'wy Tribes of  Mind    In braided Dance their Murmurs join'd  And all the bright uncounted  Pow'rs    Who feed on Heav'n's ambrosial Flow'rs  Where is the Bard whose Soul can now  Its high presuming Hopes avow  Where He who thinks with Rapture blind  This hallow'd Work for Him design'd    High on some Cliff to Heav'n uppil'd  Of rude Access of Prospect wild  Where tangled round the jealous Steep  Strange Shades o'erbrow the Valleys deep  And holy  Genii  guard the Rock  Its Gloomes embrown its Springs unlock  While on its rich ambitious Head  An  Eden  like his own lies spread  I view that Oak the fancied Glades among  By which as  Milton  lay His Ev'ning Ear  From many a Cloud that drop'd Ethereal Dew  Nigh spher'd in Heav'n its native Strains could hear  On which that ancicnt Trump he reach'd was hung  Thither oft his Glory greeting  From  Waller  's Myrtle Shades retreating  With many a Vow from Hope's aspiring Tongue  My trembling Feet his guiding Steps pursue  In vainSuch Bliss to One alone  Of all the Sons of Soul was known  And Heav'n and  Fancy  kindred Pow'rs  Have now o'erturn'd th' inspiring Bow'rs  Or curtain'd close such Scene from ev'ry future View  ODE Written in the beginning of the Year  HOW sleep the Brave who sink to Rest  By all their Country's Wishes blest  When  Spring  with dewy Fingers cold  Returns to deck their hallow'd Mold  She there shall dress a sweeter Sod  Than  Fancy  's Feet have ever trod    By Fairy Hands their Knell is rung  By Forms unseen their Dirge is sung  There  Honour  comes a Pilgrim grey  To bless the Turf that wraps their Clay  And  Freedom  shall awhile repair  To dwell a weeping Hermit there  ODE to MERCY  STROPHE  O Thou who sit'st a smiling Bride  By  Valour's  arm'd and awful Side  Gentlest of Skyborn Forms and best ador'd  Who oft with Songs divine to hear  Win'st from his fatal Grasp the Spear  And hid'st in Wreaths of Flow'rs his bloodless Sword  Thou who amidst the deathful Field  By Godlike Chiefs alone beheld  Oft with thy Bosom bare art found  Pleading for him the Youth who sinks to Ground  See  Mercy  see with pure and loaded Hands  Before thy Shrine my Country's Genius stands  And decks thy Altar still tho' pierc'd with many a Wound  ANTISTROPHE  When he whom ev'n our Joys provoke  The  Fiend of Nature  join'd his Yoke  And rush'd in Wrath to make our Isle his Prey  Thy Form from out thy sweet Abode  O'ertook Him on his blasted Road  And stop'd his Wheels and look'd his Rage away  I see recoil his sable Steeds  That bore Him swift to Salvage Deeds  Thy tender melting Eyes they own  O Maid for all thy Love to  Britain  shown  Where  Justice  bars her Iron Tow'r  To Thee we build a roseate Bow'r  Thou Thou shalt rule our Queen and share our Monarch's Throne  ODE to LIBERTY  STROPHE  WHO shall awake the  Spartan  Fife  And call in solemn Sounds to Life  The Youths whose Locks divinely spreading  Like vernal Hyacinths in sullen Hue  At once the Breath of Fear and Virtue shedding  Applauding  Freedom  lov'd of old to view  What New  AIcaeus  Alluding to that beautiful Fragment of  Alcaeus  Fancyblest  Shall sing the Sword in Myrtles drest  At  Wisdom's  Shrine awhile its Flame concealing  What Place so fit to seal a Deed renown'd  Till she her brightest Lightnings round revealing  It leap'd in Glory forth and dealt her prompted Wound  O Goddess in that feeling Hour  When most its Sounds would court thy Ears  Let not my Shell's misguided Pow'r  Callimach      E'er draw thy sad thy mindful Tears  No  Freedom  no I will not tell  How  Rome  before thy weeping Face  With heaviest Sound a Giantstatue fell  Push'd by a wild and artless Race  From off its wide ambitious Base  When Time his Northern Sons of Spoil awoke  And all the blended Work of Strength and Grace  With many a rude repeated Stroke  And many a barb'rous Yell to thousand Fragments broke  EPODE    Yet ev'n where'er the least appear'd  Th' admiring World thy Hand rever'd  Still 'midst the scatter'd States around  Some Remnants of Her Strength were found  They saw by what escap'd the Storm  How wond'rous rose her perfect Form  How in the great the labour'd Whole  Each mighty Master pour'd his Soul  For sunny  Florence  Seat of Art  Beneath her Vines preserv'd a part  Till They  The Family of the  Medici  whom Science lov'd to name  O who could fear it quench'd her Flame  And lo an humbler Relick laid  In jealous  Pisa  's Olive Shade  See small  Marino  The little Republic of  San Marino  joins the Theme  Tho' least not last in thy Esteem  Strike louder strike th' ennobling Strings  To those  The  Venetians  whose Merchant Sons were Kings  To Him  The Dogs of  Venice  who deck'd with pearly Pride  In  Adria  weds his greenhair'd Bride  Hail Port of Glory Wealth and Pleasure  Ne'er let me change this  Lydian  Measure  Nor e'er her former Pride relate  To sad  Liguria  's  Genoa  bleeding State  Ah no more pleas'd thy Haunts I seek  On wild  Helvetia  's  Switzerland  Mountains bleak  Where when the favor'd of thy Choice  The daring Archer heard thy Voice  Forth from his Eyrie rous'd in Dread  The rav'ning  Eagle  northward fled  Or dwell in willow'd Meads more near  With Those  The  Dutch  amongst whom there are very severe Penalties for those who are convicted of killing this Bird They are kept tame in almost all their Towns and particularly at the  Hague  of the Arms of which they make a Part The common People of  Holland  are said to entertain a superstitious Sentiment That if the whole Species of them should become extinct they should lose their Liberties  to whom thy Stork is dear  Those whom the Rod of  Alva  bruis'd  Whose Crown a  British  Queen  Queen  Elizabeth  refus'd  The Magic works Thou feel'st the Strains  One holier Name alone remains  The perfect Spell shall then avail  Hail Nymph ador'd by  Britain  Hail  ANTISTROPHE  Beyond the Measure vast of Thought  The Works the Wizzard  Time  has wrought  The  Gaul  'tis held of antique Story  Saw  Britain  link'd to his now adverse Strand  This Tradition is mention'd by several of our old Historians Some Naturalists too have endeavour'd to support the Probability of the Fact by Arguments drawn from the correspondent Disposition of the two opposite Coasts I don't remember that any Poetical Use has been hitherto made of it    No Sea between nor Cliff sublime and hoary  He pass'd with unwet Feet thro' all our Land  To the blown  Baltic  then they say  The wild Waves found another way  Where  Orcas  howls his wolfish Mountains rounding▪  Till all the banded West at once 'gan rise  A wide wild Storm ev'n Nature's self confounding  With'ring her Giant Sons with strange uncouth Surprise  This pillar'd Earth so firm and wide  By Winds and inward Labors torn  In Thunders dread was push'd aside  And down the should'ring Billows born  And see like Gems her laughing Train  The little Isles on ev'ry side  Mona  There is a Tradition in the Isle of  Man  that a Mermaid becoming enamour'd of a young Man of extraordinary Beauty took an Opportunity of meeting him one day as he walked on the Shore and open'd her Passion to him but was receiv'd with a Coldness occasion'd by his Horror and Surprize at her Appearance This however was so misconstrued by the SeaLady that in revenge for his Treatment of her she punish'd the whole Island by covering it with a Mist so that all who attempted to carry on any Commerce with it either never arriv'd at it but wander'd up and down the Sea or were on a sudden wreck'd upon its Cliffs  once hid from those who search the Main'  Where thousand Elfin Shapes abide  And  Wight  who checks the west'ring Tide  For Thee consenting Heav'n has each bestow'd  A fair Attendant on her sov'reign Pride  To Thee this blest Divorce she ow'd  For thou hast made her Vales thy lov'd thy last Abode  SECOND EPODE  Then too 'tis said an hoary Pile  'Midst the green Navel of our Isle  Thy Shrine in some religious Wood  O Soulenforcing Goddess stood  There oft the painted Native's Feet  Were wont thy Form celestial meet  Tho' now with hopeless Toil we trace  Time's backward Rolls to find its place  Whether the fierytressed  Dane    Or  Roman  's self o'erturn'd the Fane  Or in what Heav'nleft Age it fell  'Twere hard for modern Song to tell  Yet still if Truth those Beams infuse  Which guide at once and charm the Muse  Beyond yon braided Clouds that lie  Paving the lightembroider'd Sky  Amidst the bright pavilion'd Plains  The beauteous  Model  still remains  There happier than in Islands blest  Or Bow'rs by Spring or  Hebe  drest  The Chiefs who fill our  Albion  's Story  In warlike Weeds retir'd in Glory  Hear their consorted  Druids  sing  Their Triumphs to th' immortal String  How may the Poet now unfold  What never Tongue or Numbers told  How learn delighted and amaz'd  What Hands unknown that Fabric rais'd  Ev'n now before his favor'd Eyes  In  Gothic  Pride it seems to rise  Yet  Graecia  's graceful Orders join  Majestic thro' the mix'd Design  The secret Builder knew to chuse  Each spherefound Gem of richest Hues  Whate'er Heav'n's purer Mold contains  When nearer Suns emblaze its Veins  There on the Walls the  Patriot's  Sight  May ever hang with fresh Delight  And grav'd with some Prophetic Rage  Read  Albion  's Fame thro' ev'ry Age  Ye Forms Divine ye Laureate Band  That near her inmost Altar stand  Now sooth Her to her blisuful Train  Blithe  Concord's  social Form to gain  Concord  whose Myrtle Wand can steep  Ev'n  Anger's  bloodshot Eyes in Sleep  Before whose breathing Bosom's Balm  Rage  drops his Steel and Storms grow calm  Her let our Sires and Matrons hoar  Welcome to  Britain  's ravag'd Shore  Our Youths enamour'd of the Fair  Play with the Tangles of her Hair  Till in one loud applauding Sound  The Nations shout to Her around  O how supremely art thou blest  Thou Lady Thou shalt rule the West  ODE to a Lady on the Death of Colonel ROSS in the Action of  Fontenoy    WHILE lost to all his former Mirth  Britannia  's Genius bends to Earth  And mourns the fatal Day  While stain'd with Blood he strives to tear  Unseemly from his Seagreen Hair  The Wreaths of chearful  May    The Thoughts which musing Pity pays  And fond Remembrance loves to raise  Your faithful Hours attend  Still Fancy to Herself unkind  Awakes to Grief the soften'd Mind  And points the bleeding Friend    By rapid  Scheld  's descending Wave  His Country's Vows shall bless the Grave  Where'er the Youth is laid  That sacred Spot the Village Hind  With ev'ry sweetest Turf shall bind  And Peace protect the Shade    Blest Youth regardful of thy Doom  Aërial Hands shall build thy Tomb  With shadowy Trophies crown'd  Whilst  Honor  bath'd in Tears shall rove  To sigh thy Name thro' ev'ry Grove  And call his Heros round    The warlike Dead of ev'ry Age  Who fill the fair recording Page  Shall leave their sainted Rest  And halfreclining on his Spear  Each wond'ring Chief by turns appear  To hail the blooming Guest    Old  Edward  's Sons unknown to yield  Shall croud from  Cressy  's laurell'd Field  And gaze with fix'd Delight  Again for  Britain  's Wrongs they feel  Again they snatch the gleamy Steel  And wish th' avenging Fight    But lo where sunk in deep Despair  Her Garments torn her Bosom bare  Impatient  Freedom  lies  Her matted Tresses madly spread  To ev'ry Sod which wraps the Dead  She turns her joyless Eyes    Ne'er shall she leave that lowly Ground  Till Notes of Triumph bursting round  Proclaim her Reign restor'd  Till  William  seek the sad Retreat  And bleeding at her sacred Feet  Present the sated Sword    If weak to sooth so soft an Heart  These pictur'd Glories nought impart  To dry thy constant Tear  If yet in Sorrow's distant Eye  Expos'd and pale thou see'st him lie  Wild War infulting near    Where'er from Time Thou court'st Relief  The Muse shall still with social Grief  Her gentlest Promise keep  Ev'n humble  Harting  's cottag'd Vale  Shall learn the sad repeated Tale  And bid her Shepherds weep  ODE to EVENING  IF ought of Oaten Stop or Pastoral Song  May hope O pensive  Eve  to sooth thine Ear  Like thy own brawling Springs  Thy Springs and dying Gales  O  Nymph  reserv'd while now the brighthair'd Sun  Sits in yon western Tent whose cloudy Skirts  With Brede ethereal wove  O'erhang his wavy Bed  Now Air is hush'd save where the weakey'd Bat  With short shrill Shriek flits by on leathern Wing  Or where the Beetle winds  His small but sullen Horn  As oft he rises 'midst the twilight Path  Against the Pilgrim born in heedless Hum  Now teach me  Maid  compos'd  To breathe some soften'd Strain  Whose Numbers stealing thro' thy darkning Vale  May not unseemly with its Stillness suit  As musing slow I hail  Thy genial lov'd Return  For when thy folding Star arising shews  His paly Circlet at his warning Lamp  The fragrant  Hours  and  Elves  Who slept in Buds the Day  And many a  Nymph  who wreaths her Brows with Sedge  And sheds the fresh'ning Dew and lovelier still  The  Pensive Pleasures  sweet  Prepare thy shadowy Car  Then let me rove some wild and heathy Scene  Or find some Ruin 'midst its dreary Dells  Whose Walls more awful nod  By thy religious Gleams  Or if chill blustring Winds or driving Rain  Prevent my willing Feet be mine the Hut  That from the Mountain's Side  Views Wilds and swelling Floods  And Hamlets brown and dimdiscover'd Spires  And hears their simple Bell and marks o'er all  Thy Dewy Fingers draw  The gradual dusky Veil  While  Spring  shall pour his Show'rs as oft he wont  And bathe thy breathing Tresses meekest  Eve  While  Summer  loves to sport  Beneath thy ling'ring Light  While sallow  Autumn  fills thy Lap with Leaves  Or  Winter  yelling thro' the troublous Air  Affrights thy shrinking Train  And rudely rends thy Robes  So long regardful of thy quiet Rule  Shall  Fancy    Friendship    Science  smiling  Peace    Thy gentlest Influence own  And love thy fav'rite Name  ODE to PEACE  O Thou who bad'st thy Turtles bear  Swift from his Grasp thy golden Hair  And sought'st thy native Skies  When  War  by Vultures drawn from far  To  Britain  bent his Iron Car  And bad his Storms arise    Tir'd of his rude tyrannic Sway  Our Youth shall fix some festive Day  His sullen Shrines to burn  But Thou who hear'st the turning Spheres  What Sounds may charm thy partial Ears  And gain thy blest Return    O  Peace  thy injur'd Robes upbind  O rise and leave not one behind  Of all thy beamy Train  The  British  Lion Goddess sweet  Lies stretch'd on Earth to kiss thy Feet  And own thy holier Reign    Let others court thy transient Smile  But come to grace thy western Isle  By warlike  Honour  led  And while around her Ports rejoice  While all her Sons adore thy Choice  With Him for ever wed  The MANNERS An ODE  FAREWELL for clearer Ken design'd  The dimdiscover'd Tracts of Mind  Truths which from Action's Paths retir'd  My silent Search in vain requir'd  No more my Sail that Deep explores  No more I search those magic Shores  What Regions part the World of Soul  Or whence thy Streams  Opinion  roll  If e'er I round such Fairy Field  Some Pow'r impart the Spear and Shield  At which the Wizzard  Passions  fly  By which the Giant  Follies  die  Farewell the Porch whose Roof is seen  Arch'd with th' enlivening Olive's Green  Where  Science  prank'd in tissued Vest  By  Reason    Pride  and  Fancy  drest  Comes like a Bride so trim array'd  To wed with  Doubt  in  Plato  's Shade  Youth of the quick uncheated Sight  Thy Walks  Observance  more invite  O Thou who lov'st that ampler Range  Where Life's wide Prospects round thee change  And with her mingling Sons ally'd  Throw'st the prattling Page aside  To me in Converse sweet impart  To read in Man the native Heart  To learn where Science sure is found  From Nature as she lives around  And gazing oft her Mirror true  By turns each shifting Image view  Till meddling  Art's  officious Lore  Reverse the Lessons taught before  Alluring him from a safer Rule  To dream in her enchanted School  Thou Heav'n whate'er of Great we boast  Hast blest this social Science most  Retiring hence to thoughtful Cell  As  Fancy  breathes her potent Spell  Not vain she finds the charmful Task  In Pageant quaint in motley Mask  Behold before her musing Eyes  The countless  Manners  round her rise  While ever varying as they pass  To some  Contempt  applies her Glass  With these the  whiterob'd Maids  combine  And those the laughing  Satyrs  join  But who is He whom now she views  In Robe of wild contending Hues  Thou by the Passions nurs'd I greet  The comic Sock that binds thy Feet  O  Humour  Thou whose Name is known  To  Britain  's favor'd Isle alone  Me too amidst thy Band admit  There where the youngeyed healthful  Wit    Whose Jewels in his crisped Hair  Are plac'd each other's Beams to share  Whom no Delights from Thee divide  In Laughter loos'd attends thy Side  By old  Miletus  Alluding to the  Milesian  Tales some of the earliest Romances  who so long  Has ceas'd his Loveinwoven Song  By all you taught the  Tuscan  Maids  In chang'd  Italia  's modern Shades  By Him  Cervantes  whose  Knight's  distinguish'd Name  Refin'd a Nation's Lust of Fame  Whose Tales ev'n now with Echos sweet  Castilia  's  Moorish  Hills repeat  Or Him  Monsieur  Le Sage  Author of the incomparable Adventures of  Gil Blas de Santillane  who died in  Paris  in the Year  whom  Seine  's blue Nymphs deplore  In watchet Weeds on  Gallia  's Shore  Who drew the sad  Sicilian  Maid  By Virtues in her Sire betray'd  O Nature boon from whom proceed  Each forceful Thought each prompted Deed  If but from Thee I hope to feel  On all my Heart imprint thy Seal  Let some retreating Cynic find  Those oftturn'd Scrolls I leave behind  The  Sports  and I this Hour agree  To rove thy Scenefull World with Thee  The PASSIONS An ODE for Music  WHEN Music Heav'nly Maid was young  While yet ia early  Greece  she sung  The Passions oft to hear her Shell  Throng'd around her magic Cell  Exulting trembling raging fainting  Possest beyond the Muse's Painting  By turns they felt the glowing Mind  Disturb'd delighted rais'd refin'd  Till once 'tis said when all were fir'd  Fill'd with Fury rapt inspir'd  From the supporting Myrtles round  They snatch'd her Instruments of Sound  And as they oft had heard apart  Sweet Lessons of her forceful Art  Each for Madness rul'd the Hour  Would prove his own expressive Pow'r  First  Fear  his Hand its Skill to try  Amid the Chords bewilder'd laid  And back recoil'd he knew not why  Ev'n at the Sound himself had made  Next  Anger  rush'd his Eyes on fire  In Lightnings own'd his secret Stings  In one rude Clash he struck the Lyre  And swept with hurried Hand the Strings  With woful Measures wan  Despair  Low sullen Sounds his Grief beguil'd  A solemn strange and mingled Air  'Twas sad by Fits by Starts 'twas wild  But Thou O  Hope  with Eyes so fair  What was thy delightful Measure  Still it whisper'd promis'd Pleasure  And bad the lovely Scenes at distance hail  Still would Her Touch the Strain prolong  And from the Rocks the Woods the Vale  She call'd on Echo still thro' all the Song  And where Her sweetest Theme She chose  A soft responslve Voice was heard at ev'ry Close  And  Hope  enchanted smil'd and wav'd Her golden Hair  And longer had She sungbut with a Frown  Revenge  impatient rose  He threw his bloodstain'd Sword in Thunder down  And with a with'ring Look  The Wardenouncing Trumpet took  And blew a Blast so loud and dread  Were ne'er Prophetic Sounds so full of Woe  And ever and anon he beat  The doubling Drum with furious Heat  And tho' fometimes each dreary Pause between  Dejected  Pity  at his Side  Her Soulsubduing Voice applied  Yet still He kept his wild unalter'd Mien  While each strain'd Ball of Sight seem'd bursting from his Head  Thy Numbers  Jealousy  to nought were fix'd  Sad Proof of thy distressful State  Of diff'ring Themes the veering Song was mix'd  And now it courted  Love  now raving call'd on  Hate  With Eyes uprais'd as one inspir'd  Pale  Melancholy  sate retir'd  And from her wild sequester'd Seat  In Notes by Distance made more sweet  Pour'd thro' the mellow  Horn  her pensive Soul  And dashing soft from Rocks around  Bubbling Runnels join'd the Sound  Thro' Glades and Glooms the mingled Measure stole  Or o'er some haunted Stream with fond Delay  Round an holy Calm diffusing  Love of Peace and lonely Musing  In hollow Murmurs died away  But O how alter'd was its sprightlier Tone  When  Chearfulness  a Nymph of healthiest Hue  Her Bow across her Shoulder flung  Her Buskins gem'd with Morning Dew  Blew an inspiring Air that Dale and Thicket rung  The Hunter's Call to  Faun  and  Dryad  known  The Oakcrown'd  Sisters  and their chasteye'd  Queen    Satyrs  and
