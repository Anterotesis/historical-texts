 MACBETH RECONSIDERED AN ESSAY  Price One Shilling  MACBETH RECONSIDERED AN ESSAY INTENDED AS AN ANSWER TO PART OF THE REMARKS ON SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF SHAKSPEARE  LONDON PRINTED FOR T AND J EGERTON WHITEHALL  MDCCLXXXVI  TO EDMUND MALONE THIS ESSAY IS INSCRIBED BY HIS OBEDIENT AND OBLIGED SERVANT  THE AUTHOR  Advertisement to the Reader  THE Passages printed in Italics are quotations from Mr Wheatley's Remarks and the references correspond with the edition of Shakspeare given by Johnson and Stevens  MACBETH RECONSIDERED  PLAYS are designed by the joint powers of precept and example to have a good influence on the lives of men Enquiries into the conduct of fable in the drama were useless to this end the regular or irregular disposition of parts in a play is an artificial praise or blame that can contribute nothing to the improvement or depravation of the mind for the cause of morality is promoted only when by a catastrophe resulting from principles natural to the agents who produce it we are taught to love virtue and abhorvice  Neglect of unity is the obvious fault of Shakspeare's pieces truth of manners their unrivalled excellence  This Essay does not profess to observe upon any inconsistency in the conduct of the tragedy of Macbeth it concerns itself only with the sentiments of the hero of it presuming they will more effectually serve ethicks if in analysing his character it shews that there is no distinction between him and king Richard in the quality of personal courage If Macbeth be what Mr Wheatley describes him we must forego our virtuous satisfaction in his repugnance to guilt for it arises from mere cowardice and can gain no instruction from his remorse for it is only the effect of imbecility we despise him we cannot feel for him and shall never be amended by a wretch who is uniformly the object of our contempt  The writer of these pages does not consider that his position will never be established till Mr Wheatley's be overthrown without perceiving how difficult and apparently invidious a task he undertakes he relies however upon Shakspeare to clear Macbeth from the imputation laid on his nature and can truly say the argument is not taken up in a spirit of controversy but out of a love for what is believed to be just criticism  Having given many judicious proofs of the difference there certainly is in the characters of Macbeth and Richard Mr Wheatley proceeds to the article of courage and says  In Richard it is intrepidity and in Macbeth no more than resolution in him  Macbeth  it proceeds from exertion not from nature in enterprize he betrays a degree of fear though he is able when occasion requires to stifle and subdue it  The attempt to controvert this doctrine naturally resolves itself into three heads namely a repetition of the simple character of Macbeth as it stands before any change is effected in it by the supernatural soliciting of the weird sisters a consideration of his conduct towards Banquo and Macduff and a review of his deportment as opposed to Richard's in the "Remarks" This order will involve an inquiry into Mr Wheatley's interpretation of the poet's text into the appositeness of the facts adduced in support of hi opinion and into his philosophy of the pec  liar passion of characters when facts not supplying testimony he can substantiate his hypothesis only on the evidence of appropriated sentiment  An appeal for judgement on the nature of Macbeth's courage lies to the tribunal of  Shakspeare himself The circumscribed nature of a drama renders it generally impracticable for the principal personages in it gradually to unfold themselves it is therefore an allowed artifice with dramatic authors and of which they commonly avail themselves by an impressive description of their heroes to bring us in a great measure acquainted with them before they are actually engaged in scenes where for want of such previous intelligence their proceedings might appear at best confused and generally perhaps inexplicable We are bound then to receive the introductory portrait our author has drawn of Macbeth as a true resemblance for a creature of the poet's arbitrary creation may be assimilated only to those features which he has thought fit to give him Here is the picture  The merciless Macdonel    from the western isles  Of kernes and gallowglasses is supply'd  And fortune on his damned quarrel smiling  Shew'd like a rebel's whore but all's too weak  For brave Macbeth well he deserves that name  Disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel  Which smoak'd with bloody execution  Like valour's minion carved out his passage  'Till he fac'd the slave  And ne'er shook hands nor bade farewel to him  'Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chops  P v  Could Shakspeare call a man brave and insist upon his well deserving that appellation could he grace a man with the title of valour's minion and deem him as he does in a subsequent passage worthy to be matched even with the goddess of warcould he do this and not design to impress a full idea of the dignity of his courage Macbeth's great heart pants to meet the merciless leader of the rebels his executing sword all dyed in reeking gore hews out a passage to him he maintains the combat 'till the death of his antagonist crowns his persistive valour with the victory he burned for  It is said Macbeth has  resolution  not  intrepidity  What is the soldier's intrepidity but disdaining fortune  It is objected though with some qualification that Macbeth's courage  proceeds from exertion not from nature  and that in  enterprize he betrays a deal of fear  Let us turn to the portrait once more  Cap  No sooner justice had with valour arm'd  Compell'd these skipping kernes to trust their heels  But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage  With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men  Began a fresh assault  King  Dismay'd not this  Our captains Macbeth and Banquo  Cap  Yes  As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion  P v  The Thane of Rosse takes up the narrative  Norway himself with terrible numbers    began a dismal conflict  'Till that Bellona's bridegroom lapt in proof  Confronted him with selfcomparisons  Point against point rebellious arm 'gainst arm  Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude  The victory fell on us  P v  Is it to betray fear in enterprize already worn with the fatigues of a hardfought field to rush at disadvantage on fresh supplies and terrible numbers unconcerned as eagles when they swoop on sparrows and lions when they strike a hare It cannot be the laboured effect of exertion it is the spontaneous impulse of a dauntless nature that again hurries Bellona's bridegroom through all the horrors of a dismal conflict to single out and hold the royal invader point against point till his resistless  arm has curbed his lavish spirit and raised on his discomfiture the trophies of a second conquest  Macbeth now enters in the scene and a deputation from the sovereign meets him with these gracious acknowledgements to his triumphant valour  The king hath happily received Macbeth  The news of thy success and when he reads  Thy personal venture in the rebel's  ight  His wonder and his praises do contend  Which should be thine or his silenc'd with that  In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day  He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks  Nothing afraid of what thyself didst make  Strange images of death As thick as tale  Came post with post and every one did bear  Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence    For an earnest of a greater honour  He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor  P v  The king congratulates Macbeth on his success and professes that the praise due to his personal venture in the first battle is lost in silent wonder at the sublimity of his daring How inexpressible then are Duncan's feelings when he finds him once more engaged the selfsame day in the stout  Norweyan ranks careless of meeting that death which he was so terribly dealing on the squadrons that surrounded him The king confers the forfeited honours of the disloyal Cawdor upon his general only as a token of those higher dignities which all conspire to think his atchievements in the kingdom's great defence have justly merited  Such is the character Shakspeare attributes to Macbeth while yet the pureness of his conscience is uncontaminated by guilt The impetuosity of Glamis is the decision of intrepidity the feats of his own hand assure to him the renown of gallantry and the whole tenour of his conduct throughout this perilous adventure unequivocally displays a soul that with Othello's may  agnize  A natural and prompt alacrity  It finds in hardness  P v  We come now to the second part of this question The "Remarks" affirm that  Macbeth is personally afraid of Banquo  and that  his fear is founded on the superior courage of the other  The evidence which is given in of Banquo's superior courage may perhaps on examination  seem but of little weight Whence are the proofs of Macbeth's cowardice to be brought Not from his behaviour in battle It does not appear that  upon the first meeting of the witches Macbeth is agitated much more than Banquo  Banquo's description of their figures and his  several pertinent questions  to them amounting though to no more than two are not expressive of  mere curiosity  but of the surprise with which himself and his partner are equally affected on their unexpectedly encountering three objects of so grotesque an appearance  What are these  So wither'd and so wild in their attire  That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth  And yet are on'tLive you or are you ought  That man may question  P v  If Macbeth  only repeats the same inquiry  it is not from timidity but from a wish for the same information and when he does it  shortly  he indicates his impatience for an answer  Why should the speeches of Macbeth and Banquo in this scene  appear to be injudiciously distributed  And how will  the difference in their characters account for such a distribution  Banquo addresses the witches first Banquo is  made to see them first not in token of superiority but merely perhaps that their ceremonious silence to him  each at once her choppy finger laying  Upon her skinny lips  P v  may heighten the solemnity of the prophetic greeting with which they are about to hail Macbeth Yet the distribution of the parts is of so little moment that it might have happened fortuitously to have done however with conjecture the context evinces that it is not produced for the purpose of shewing Banquo's superiority in  being perfectly calm  under an occurrence that has  ruffled  Macbeth  If Macbeth  is amazed when he sees the witches are vanished  and likens their disappearance to the melting of breath into the wind Banquo is struck too and compares them in their sudden evanescence to the bursting bubbles of the waterP v  Banquo cannot be said to  treat the witches with contempt  he adjures them  I' the name of truth  P v  and with Macbeth gives them in some sort credit for  More than mortal knowledge  If you can look into the seeds of time  And say which grain will grow and which will not  Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear  Your favours nor your hate  P v  This is the language of manly firmness not of contempt He does not mean to  ridicule their prophecy  by answering to Macbeth's question  Went it not so  To the selfsame tune and words  P v  This is a grave and precise reply to a particular and interesting demand It has been observed from the highest critical authority that Malcolm confirms the serious import of the speech in question when he calls the effusions of Macduff's grief and rage a manly "tune"P v It is plain that Banquo's exclamation  What can the devil speak true  P v  on hearing part of the prophecy fulfilled is dictated by wonder not  disregard  for when Macbeth takes occasion from that very event to question him on the hope he now might  reasonably entertain of his family's advancement he solemnly replies  'Tis strange  And oftentimes to win us to our harm  The instruments of darkness tell us truths  Win us with honest trifles to betray us  In deepest consequence  P v  Now let us advert to the subsequent effect which the declarations of the sisters have upon Banquo's mind he prays to be delivered from their temptations  Merciful powers  Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature  Gives way to in repose  P v  Mr Stevens to whom every admirer of Shakspeare must feel himself under high obligations observes upon this passage  it is apparent from what Banquo says afterwards  to Macbeth "I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters"  that he had been solicited in a dream to attempt something in consequence of the prophecy of the witches that his waking senses were shock'd at  P v These horrible emotions could never have been  caused in him by declarations which he had contemned ridiculed or disregarded The adventure on the heath therefore does not prove Banquo's spirit greater than Macbeth's  The "Remarks" proceed thus in proof of Macbeth's personal fear of Banquo  his principal object is the death of the father and the securing of his crown against Banquo's issue who alone were pointed out to his jealousy by the witches is no more than a secondary consideration  Macbeth when he  confesses to Lady Macbeth that his mind is full of scorpions  shews Banquo not to be the sole cause of his uneasiness by adding "Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives" Moreover directing the assassins he tells them the son's absence is "no less material" to him than the father's he urges the death of Fleance on a motive distinct from cowardice for allowing one moment that he personally fear'd Banquo it is impossible to conceive he could have felt the same dread of a boy again had his fears been personal they must have ended with the removal of the object of them but finding the son has not fallen with the father he is again involv'd in all his former apprehensions  Fleance is 'scap'd  Then comes my fit again  P v  The witches it is true only point out Banquo's issue to Macbeth's jealousy but acual is not possible progeny and the loss of one child does not prevent a man from begetting others thus the securing of his crown against Banquo's issue is so far from being a  secondary  that it is the tyrant's only instigation to this double murder  The original idea of Macbeth's personally fearing Banquo seems founded on these words  our fears in Banquo  Stick deep  and  There is none but he  Whose being I do fear  P v  It will be essentially necessary towards explaining the sense of these strong lines to follow the train of reasoning through the context of the speech from which they are taken  To be thus is nothing  But to be safely thusOur fears in Banquo  Stick deep and in his royalty of nature  Reigns that which would be fear'd 'Tis much he dares  And to that dauntless temper of his mind  He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour  To act in safety There is none but he  Whose being I do fear and under him  My genius is rebuk'd as it is said  Mark Anthony's was by Caesar He chid the sisters  When first they put the name of king upon me  And bade them speak to him then prophetlike  They hail'd him father to a line of kings  Upon my head they plac'd a fruitless crown  And put a barren sceptre in my gripe  Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand  No son of mine succeeding If it be so  For Banquo's issue have I fil'd my mind  For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd  Put rancours in the vessel of my peace  Only for them and mine eternal jewel  Given to the common enemy of man  To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings  Rather than so come fate into the list  And champion me to the utterance  ibid  In this soliloquy the usurper reflects that after all he has done to obtain the crown he is in great danger of losing it weighs the causes of that danger and resolves by removing them to take effectual measures for the firmly establishing of his supremacy In other words  I have possess'd myself of the sovereignty but to what avail when in a moment it  may be wrested from me Banquo's eye is fix'd upon it and there reigns in his very nature a royalty that seems to realize his expectations he is not only a soldier of uncommon bravery but so consummate a politician that should he revolt against my government he would infallibly carry his designs successfully into execution He is the only man alive whose attempts I dread and he holds as high an ascendant over my good genius as it is said Caesar did over Mark Antony's His hopes are not only strengthen'd by his natural endowments but embolden'd too by the assurances of prophecy hearing me saluted king by the sisters he bade them speak to him they obey'd and hail'd him father to a line of kings they plac'd a crown upon my head and put a sceptre in my hand not to be transmitted to my own but to be wrench'd away by the unlineal inheritance of his children If so I shall have perpetrated such crimes as must embitter every moment of my life in this world and forbid every hope of happiness in the world to come only to make the seed of Banquo kings It must not beI here oppose myself to the prediction and resolve by extirpating his family to elude the decrees of fate itself  The usurper then does not plunge into fresh crimes  to get rid of personal fear  ambition impels him to the murder of Duncan and the same ambition urges him on the destruction of Banquo and Fleance who seem destin'd to degrade him and his house from the splendors of monarchy to the obscurity of vassalage  The "Remarks" find additional proofs of Macbeth's cowardice in his conduct towards Macduff"  The same motives of personal fear and those unmix'd with any other impel him to seek the destruction of Macduff  "  Macbeth is not wrought by  personal fear  to destroy Macduff but by the knowledge of his disaffection  How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person  At our great bidding  P v  The discontented Thane of Fife is a man whose parts and popularity are not to be despis'd he is described  Noble wise judicious  P v  And Rosse speaking of the misfortune that had befallen him in the loss of his wife and children says  No mind that's honest  But in it shares some woe  P v  If Macbeth thanks the apparition that had "harped his fears aright"it is because its caution justifying his suspicions he shall now provide more strenuously against the machinations of his enemy  If when told that  none of women born  Shall harm him  he says  Then live Macduff  yet repressing the feelings of confidence instantly adds  Thou shalt not live  That I may tell palehearted fear it lies  the quality of that fear is decided when being assur'd that he  shall never vanquish'd be until  Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill  Shall come against him  he exclaims  Our  highplac'd  Macbeth  Shall live the lease of nature  P v  When the Thane of Fife encounters Macbeth in battle the tyrant does not use the power upon his life which he believes himself possess'd of as instantly he would had he fear'd him but yielding to compunction for the inhuman wrongs he had done him wishes to avoid the necessity of adding Macduff's blood to that already spilt in the slaughter of his dearest connections  Get thee back my soul is too much charg'd  With blood of thine already  Macd  I have no words  My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain  Than terms can give thee out  Fight    Mach  Thou losest labour  As easy may'st thou the intrenchant air  With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests  I bear a charmed life which must not yield  To one of woman born  P v  Unmov'd by Macduff's taunts and furious attack Macbeth advises him to employ his valour where success may follow it and generously warns him against persisting to urge an unequal combat with one whom destiny had pronounced invincible  The "Remarks" would now condemn Macbeth from his own confession of the truth  of the accusations brought against him  That apprehension was his reason for these murthers he intimates himself when meditating on that of Banquo he observes that  Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill  P a s  And when that of Macduff is in contemplation he says  I am in blood  Stept in so far that shou'd I wade no more  Returning were as tedious as go o'er  P v  The comment on these passages which Cibber puts into the mouth of king Richard is remarkable and justly explains their meaning  Crowns got with blood must be with blood maintain'd  Act  and  When I look back 'tis terrible retreating  I cannot bear the thought nor dare repent  Act  In a word Macbeth does not meditate the deaths of Banquo and Macduff through  personal fear  of them but because his ambition renders the former obnoxious to his envy and the latter to his hatred  It must now be shewn that the proofs of Richard's superior courage are not conclusive against Macbeth Equal firmness in equal trials will invalidate some of them some are to be refuted by shewing that what is objected to Macbeth as timidity will as strongly affect Richard himself and some may perhaps be founded on misappreheasion of fact or sentiment  If it is a mark of resolution in Richard that when Tyrrel informs him the princes are dispatched  though certain of the event he is solicitous to hear at leisure in what manner it was conducted    Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper  When thou shalt tell the process of their death  P v  Macbeth must be allowed to display precisely the same quality when he says to the murderer who has related to him the process of Banquo's death  Get thee gone tomorrow  We'll hear ourselves again  P v  The "Remarks" proceed  Macbeth's suspicions extend to all his great lords    There is not a one of them but in his house  I keep a servant fee'd  p v  and "  he tells the physician"    The Thanes fly from me  P v  Does not Richard betray as much suspicion when he dares not trust Stanley till he has taken the young lord Strange as a surety for his fidelityand is he not as anxious from a mere doubt of his followers as Macbeth is on finding himself really deserted  K Rich  O Ratcliff I have dream'd a fearful dream  What think'st thouWill our friends prove all true  Rat  No doubt my Lord  K Rich  I fear I fear      Come go with me Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper  To hear if any mean to shrink from me  P v  Mr W says  His going round the camp just before the battle to listen if any meant to shrink from him is proper on that particular occasion  AgreedBut why think the same action proper conduct in Richard and cowardice in Macbeth  The "Remarks" bent upon exalting Richard at Macbeth's expence say  The same determined spirit carries him through the bloody business of murdering his nephews and when Buckingham shews a reluctance to be concern'd in it he immediately looks out for anotherHad Macbeth been thus disappointed in the person to whom he had open'd himself it would have disconcerted any design he had form'd  It appears however that the persons Macbeth open'd himself to were not wrought to his purpose on their first interview yet it does not disconcert his designs he sends for them again repeats his former conversation and prevails with them by strong arguments and large promises to undertake a murder the execution whereof he steadily persists in P v  Again  All the crimes Richard commits are for his advancement not for his security  Richard removes Clarence and Hastings as Macbeth does Duncan for his advancement but he murders his nephews and his wife as Macbeth does Banquo to secure himself in that advancement  Why should it be supposed Macbeth  catches the terrors he sees express'd in the countenance of the messenger who informs him of numbers of the enemy  Ser  There is ten thousand  Mach  Geese villain  Ser  Soldiers Sir  Mach  Go prick thy face and overred thy fear  Thou lilyliver'd boy What soldiers Patch  Death of thy soul those linen cheeks of thine  Are counsellors to fear  P v  From the contemptuous manner in which he treats the intelligence he seems rather to imagine what effect such looks might have upon the garrison than to acknowledge any they have produc'd upon himselfWhat is Richard's composure in a similar situation The information he receives of insurrections in Devonshire and Kent being followed by news of Buckingham's army striking the messenger he exclaims  Out on ye owlsnothing but songs of death  There take thou that  P v  Macbeth's courage is impeach'd because  he calls for his armour notwithstanding Seyton's remonstrance that  It is not needed yet  persists in putting it on calls for it again eagerly afterwards bids the person who is assisting him  Dispatch    then the moment it is on pulls it off again and directs his attendants to  Bring it after  P v  Is there more confusion and inconsistency in this than in the following scene  Rat  Most mighty sovereign on the western coast  Rideth a puissant navy to the shore  Throng many doubtful hollowhearted friends  Unarm'd and unresolv'd to beat them back  'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral  And there they hull expecting but the aid  Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore  K Rich  Some lightfoot friend post to the duke of Norfolk  Ratcliff thyself or Catesbywhere is he  Cates  Here my good lord  K Rich  Catesby fly to the duke  Cates  I will my lord with all convenient haste  K Rich  Ratcliffe come hither post to Salisbury  When thou comest thitherDull unmindful villain  To Catesby  Why stay'st thou here and go'st not to the duke  Cates  First mighty liege tell me your highness' pleasure  What from your grace I shall deliver to him  K Rich  O true good CatesbyBid him levy straight  The greatest strength and power he can make  And meet me suddenly at Salisbury  Cates  I go  Rat  What may it please you shall I do at Salisbury  K Rich  Why what would'st thou do there before I go  Rat  Your highness told me I shou'd post before  K Rich  My mind is chang'd  '  P v  Arguing principally from the recited instances of it the "Remarks" say  These are all symptoms of timidity which he confesses to have been natural to him when he owns that  The time has been my senses wou'd have cool'd To hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair Wou'd at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in'tI have supt full of horrors Direness familiar to my slaught'rous thoughts Cannot once start me  P v  Here Mr W refutes his own position for if his interpretation of these lines be admitted he must allow that Macbeth whatever his former feelings were has no timidity  in his disposition now But the passage refers neither to fear or courageit is a pathetic reflection on the dreadful change produced in his humane habits during a seventeen years usurpation the records whereof are crouded with practices so oppressive and bloody as have hardened his once easily yielding temper against all impressions of sensibility and the charities of nature  P When Richard "  asks  "  My lord of Surry why look you so sad  P v  and afterwards "  enquires  "  Saw'st thou the melancholy lord Northumberland  P v  he is not  satisfied upon being told that he and Surry were busied in  Chearing up the foldiers  He would indeed fain persuade himself to be satisfied but in reality he is far from being at ease  I am satisfiedGive me a bowl of wine  I have not the alacrity of spirit  Nor cheer of mind that I was won't to have  P v  The nature of Richard's question on Surry's sadness and observation of Northumberland's melancholy may be exemplify'd from Mr W's judicious reflection on Macbeth's interrogatories to the physician  Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd Pluck from the memory c c  P v  Though it is the disorder of Lady Macbeth that gives occasion to these questions yet in his own mind he is all the while making application to himself Richard represents the enemy as a troop of banditti A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways A scum of Brittains and base lackey peasants c  P v  This harangue to his army shou'd not have been quoted as an instance of Richard's intrepidity for it does not contain his real sentiments of Richmond's friends the inferiority of the foe is a topic which generals to encourage their own troops have commonly affected and Richard never cou'd have seriously held in contempt such enemies as  Sir Walter Herbert a renowned soldier  Sir Gilbert Talbot and Sir William Stanley  Oxford redoubted Pembroke Sir James Blunt  And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew  And many others of great name and worth  P v  When lady Macbeth finding her husband will proceed no further in the bloody business of his sovereign's death reproaches him thus  Would'st thou have that  Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life  And live a coward in thine own esteem  Letting I dare not wait upon I would  P v  his reply  I dare do all that may become a man  is so far being an assertion of mere  manliness of character  in Mr W's sense that it sublimely expresses an entire contempt of danger and reverence for virtue  To compare Macbeth and Richard under the influence of visionsMacbeth addresses Banquo thus  Why what care I If thou can'st nod speak too If charnelhouses and our graves must send Those that we bury back our monuments Shall be the maws of kites  P v  Again  What man dare I dare  Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear  The arm'd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tyger  Take any shape but that and my firm nerves  Shall never tremble Or be alive again  And dare me to the desert with thy sword  If trembling I inhabit then protest me  The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow  Unreal mockery hence  P v  Notwithstanding the firmness of this defiance it cannot be suppos'd but Macbeth is as much terrify'd while he utters it as Richard is when starting out of a dream in which the souls of those he had murder'd had appear'd to him he cries  Have mercy Jesusoft I did but dream  O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me  The lights burn blueIs it not dead midnight  Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh c  P v  Superstition may be a sign of timidity Macbeth's superstition is founded on the strong assurances of preternatural agents whose first promises to him had been made goodRichard condescends to be affected by omens  Richmondwhen I was last at Exeter  The mayor in courtsy shew'd me the castle  And call'd it Rougem  nt at which name I started  Because a bard of Ireland told me once  I shou'd not live long after I saw Richmond  P v  Again  The sun will not be seen today  The sky doth frown and lour upon our army  I wou'd these dewy tears were from the ground  P v  It will be said and it will be granted that Richard presently stifles these emotions it is only asserted that he feels them like Macbeth and that Macbeth like him can overcome themThe wood of Birnam moves towards DunsinaneThe tyrant  Doubts the equivocation of the fiend  and believing the laws of nature invented to his ruin  Pulls in resolution  Instantly however he shakes off this momentary dismay  Blow wind come wrack  At least we'll die with our harness on our back  P v  He rushes upon the enemyencounters Macduff The sisters have palter'd with him he has done with belief in the juggling fiends and can rely upon himself  Though Birnam wood be come to Dunfinane  And thou oppos'd being of no woman born  Yet I will try thy last before my body  I throw my warlike shield lay on Macduff  And damn'd be him that first cries hold enough  P v  This conduct in Macbeth is stigmatized with the name of  despair  It certainly is of the same nature with Richard's determination  I have set my life upon a cast  And I will stand the hazard of the die  P v  The resolution of both tyrants in the battles that decided their fate is that mix'd effusion of grief shame and pride which cannot be denominated less than the despair of innate bravery  If Macbeth's behaviour is to be called cowardly when overpowered by the completion of the prophecies he for a moment declines the combat with Macduff so must Richard's when he flies with Hastings before Warwick and Somerset leaving Edward to the mercy of the LancastriansP  v  From the review of the characters of the usurpers it appears not to be true of Richard that  upon no occasion however tremendous end at no moment of his life however unguarded  does he betray the least symptom of fear    or of Macbeth that he  is always shaken upon great and frequently upon trivial occasions  Macbeth and Richard are each of them as intrepid as man can be yet it may be said of each without any derogation from that character that he is at times agitated with apprehensions The Earl of Peterborough has left it upon record that intrepidity and sense of danger are by no means incompatible  Having endeavour'd to prove that Macbeth has a just right to the reputation of intrepidity that he feels no personal dread of Banquo and Macduff and that he meets equal not to say superior trials as boldly as Richard it may be expected this essay should attempt to shew in what the essential difference between these great bad men consists  Ambition is the impulse that governs every action of Richard's life he attains the crown by dissimulation that owns no respect for virtue and by cruelty which entails no remorse on the va  our that wou'd maintain his illacquir'd dignity Ambition is the predominant vice of Macbeth's nature but he gratifies it by hypocrisy that reveres virtue too highly to be perfectly itself and by murders  the recollection whereof at times renders his valour useless by depriving him of all fense but that of his enormous wickedness Richard's character is simple Macbeth's mix'd Richard is only intrepid Macbeth intrepid and feeling Richard's mind not being diverted by reflection from the exigencies of his situation he is always at full leisure to display his valour Macbeth distracted by remorse loses all apprehension of danger in the contemplation of his guilt and never recurs to his valour for support till the enemy's approach rouzes his whole soul and conscience is repell'd by the necessity for exertion  The writer of the above pages cannot conclude without saying he read the  Remarks on some of Shakspeare's Characters  with so much general pleasure and conviction that he wishes his approbation were considerable enough to increase the celebrity which Mr Wheatley's memory has acquir'd from a work so usefully intended and so elegantly perform'd  FINIS
