beams are sometimes found to inspire sleep as well as genius exerted the former power upon him with such effect that in a few minutes he sunk back motionless in his chair A fellow collegian coming into the room while the poet was in this situation and seeing from the paper which was laying before him the nature of his employment he immediately added two other lines to the above in order to

great pleasure in visiting the shop of an ingenious watchmaker at Geneva and passed there many hours One day he found written over the chimneypiece in large characters"  The hours of the industrious are lost by the intrusions  of the idle  " Conceiving immediately that this sarcasm was levelled at him he thought it proper to apologize for his intrusions and to assure the artizan that if he had made him spend his time unprofitably he would willingly make him any recompence To this the watchmaker said "Sir I assure you in putting up this I had no such intention as you suppose the time which your Highness passes in my shop is to me a great pleasure and I consider myself very highly honoured by your visits but at the same time I shall tell you very candidly that your Highness has been the

she seiz'd her ale  She clear'd it at a draught  John star'd with wonder petrify'd  His hair stood on his pate  And "why dost guzzle now" he cry'd  "At this enormous rate"  "John" she said "am I to

rest and leaned to his case in such a manner that he was acquitted  Chatterton the Poet  An old gentleman that possessed a great respect for men of uncommon literary talents and who frequently conversed with Chatterton at the Cyder cellar in Maidenlane gave a loose to his good nature one evening and requested the pleasure of the poet's company to supper at his house  When the cloth was removed some very sour wine was placed on the table which the generous old gentleman praised extravagantly as he was filling Chatterton's glass requesting him at the same time to drink a bumper to the memory of ShakespeareThe inspired youth had not finished his glass when tears stood trembling in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks "God bless me" says the old gentleman "You are in tears Mr Chatterton" "Yes Sir" says the bard "this dead wine of your's compels me to shed tears but by H  n they are not the tears of veneration"  The White Mice  Those in the least acquainted with the character of Dr Goldsmith know that oeconomy and foresight were not amongst the catalogue of his virtues In the suit of his pensioners and he generally enlarged the list as he enlarged his finances was the late unfortunate John Pilkington of scribbling memory who had served the doctor so many tricks that he despaired of getting any more money from him without coming out with a chefd'oeuvre once for all He accordingly called on the doctor one  morning and running about the room in a sit of joy told him his fortune was made "How so Jack" says the doctor "Why" says Jack "the Duchess of Marlborough you must know has long had a strange penchant for a pair of white mice and as I knew they were sometimes to be had in the EastIndies I commissioned a friend of mine who was going out then to get them for me and he this morning arrived with two of the most beautiful little animals in nature" After Jack had finished this account with a transport of joy he lengthened his visage by telling the doctor all was ruined for without two guineas to buy a cage for the mice he could not present them The doctor unfortunately as he said himself had but half a guinea in the world which he offered to lend him But Pilkington was not to be beat out of his scheme he perceived the doctor's watch hanging up in his room and after premising on the indelicacy of the proposal hinted that "if he could spare that watch for a week he could raise a few guineas on it which he would pay him with gratitude The doctor would not be the means of spoiling a man's fortune for such a trifle He accordingly took down the watch and gave it to him which Jack immediately took to the pawnbroker's raised what he could on it and never once looked after the doctor till he sent to borrow another half guinea from him on his death bed which the doctor very generously sent him  Comedy  Mr R  s a dramatic author on presenting a comedy to one of the theatres assured the manager that it was a production by no means to

 A clever young fellow being at dinner at a friend's house and observing one of the company  slily pocket a table spoon let it pass till he prepared to take his leave and then marching up to the sideboard took one and put it through his buttonhole Upon being asked his motive for so curious a manoeuvre he replied "I saw my neighbour here at dinner put a spoon in his pocket and supposing it was a customary thing at this house I preferred taking mine away in my buttonhole"  It should have been mentioned first that the same gentleman during dinner having observed that the top dish of fish was not quite so fresh as might have been wished took one and put it to his mouth and then to his ear The lady of the house having asked him the reason he answered "I had a brother who was shipwrecked the day before yesterday so was asking if the fish could give any information concerning his body to which it replied it knew nothing of the transaction not having been at sea these  three weeks  "  A Pillory Conversation  An English and a French gentleman had a dispute which nation most excelled in wit The English gentleman insisted that it was common here among the very mob and to convince the other of the English superiority he carried him to Charingcross where a man stood in the pillory for keeping a disorderly house The populace looking on it as an inconsiderable offence they did not throw any thing at or illtreat him as is usual for crimes of a different nature therefore the fellow was quite easy and unconcerned and lifted the upper part of the pillory sometimes higher and then let it lower again just to suit himself  Upon which one of the spectators who stood there with a load upon his head seeing the offender so dexterous said "It is my opinion this fellow has served his time to the pillory he is so handy about it" To which a droll rogue in a leather apron replied "Served his time to it You may be sure he has do you not see that he has set up for himself" "Set up" said another "how can that be set up when he stands" "Why you foolish dog" rejoined the second who spoke "do you not know it is a standing business" And now a fellow in a woollen cap calls out to the man in the pillory "Harkee cocky" said he "had you not rather the jokes should fly about than the rotten eggs" "Aye sure master" replies the man "though it was on account of some sort of jokes I got my head into this hole" At this time a barrow woman added one more to the assembly when a porter accosts her with "Well Moll what brought you here" To which she returned "Curiosity and my legs Jack now I hope the fool's answered" "Fool" says the fellow "what do you mean by that you slut" "Why" rejoined she "you must be a fool because you can neither read nor write" "Very true" answered the porter "but I can set my mark" and immediately striking her in the face gave her a black eye this brought on a battle between the porter and a man who took the woman's part when the Frenchman seeing the English fight like bulldogs said "The English shine in  war  as well as  wit  "  A Pot I carry  There was a notable fat apothecary revolling at a tavern in Fleetstreet and when his comrades  had given him his load they sought for one to carry him home A porter was found to convey him in a basket He got him up with much trouble and coming to Templebar the gates were shut for it was twelve at night The porter knocks the keeper comes and desires to know his business The porter answers "A thing of great weight" Upon seeing the basket the keeper asked what was in it the porter answered "  A Pot I carry  "  A Pair of Spectacles  Two brothers coming once to be executed for some enormous crime the eldest was turned of first without speaking one word the other mounting the ladder began to harangue the crowd whose ears were attentively open to hear him expecting some confession of importance "Good people" says he "my brother hangs before my face and you see what a lamentable spectacle he makes in a few moments I shall be turned off too and then you will see  a pair of spectacles  "  The Watch  Lord Mansfield being willing to save a man that had stole a watch desired the jury to value it at  tenpence  upon which the prosecutor cries out "  Tenpence  my lord why the very  fashion  of it cost me  five pounds  " "Oh" says his lordship "we must not hang a man for  fashion's sake  "  Heraldry  Mr Quick happened to be in company with a gentleman whose father was a  footman  when heraldry became the subject of conversation the gentleman observed "he had seen his arms on a  baronet's carriage of his name and they must be related" "No doubt" said the wit "your family Sir is pretty extensive your father's  arms  must have been upon many carriages"  No distinction at the Gallows  A highwayman and a chimneysweeper were condemned to be hanged the same day at Tyburn the first for an exploit on the highway the latter for a more ignoble robbery The highwayman was dressed in scarlet and mounted the cart with alacrity the chimneysweeper followed him slowly While the clergyman was praying with fervour the gay robber was attentive and the other approached near to his fellowsufferer to partake of the same benefit but met with a repulsive look from his companion which kept him at some distance But forgetting this angry warning he presumed still to come nearer when the highwayman with some disdain said "Keep farther off can't you""Sir" replied sweep "I  won't  keep off and let me tell you I have as much  right  to be  here  as you"  MayDay  Through the streets on Mayday you have seen without doubt  In sooty procession a chimneysweep rout  With a garland of bushes parade  Dress'd in barristers threetail'd perukes from ragfair  With lac'd coats and lac'd hats all of gilt paper ware  And chalk paint on their chubby cheeks laid  Thus gaily bedight they dance jigs at your door  And a concert of shovel and brush goes before  If ever you laugh you to laugh must be stirr'd  At exertion so awkward and pride so absurd  With so trisling advantage in view  But should you advise with however grave face  Any one to abandon his music and lace  He would laugh as profusely at you  In comparing importance thro' life's whole career  We are all to ourselvesthat we think we appear  The London Advertisementmakers outdone  A provincial attorney lately advertised an

roasting for his master's supper who thereupon asked him what was become of the crane's other leg Chinchillo immediately swore that cranes had but one leg The next morning as he was riding behind his master he made him in order to convince him he was right observed serveral cranes at roost upon  one leg but his master shouting they put down the other leg whereupon Chinchillo perceiving that his master was angry cried out "How lucky it was that you did not shout last night for your crane would have put down the other leg and have flown away as these did and your supper would have gone too"Currado laughed and Chinchilly escaped  The Wisdom of Solomona Fact  Mr Charles  who was several years in the T  y used every morning as he came from his ladymother's to the office to pass by the

unfortunately that he had forgot them "Poor duckeys" he cried "I am sorry I am in a hurry and cannot get you some bread but here is sixpence for you to buy some" and thereupon threw a sixpence to the ducks which one of them gobbled up At the office he very  wisely  told the whole of the story to some gentlemen with whom he was to dine There being ducks for dinner one of the gentlemen ordered a sixpence to be put into the belly of one of them which he gave to Charles to cut up our hero was surprised at finding a sixpence among the seasoning enraged he bid the waiter send up his master whom he saluted with the epithets of rascal and scoundrel and swore bitterly he would have him prosecuted for robbing the king of his ducks "for" says he "Gentlemen this  very  morning did I give this sixpence to one of the ducks in the canal in St James's  Park" One of the gentlemen in the sesret assured him it was a mistake for that the ducks then on the table came from a friend of his at St

Sleevelinings pockets silk and twist  And all the long expensive list  With which their uncouth bills abound  Tho' rarely in the garment found  By these and other arts in trade  Had soon a pretty fortune made  And did what few had ever done  Left  thirty thousand  to his son  The son a gay young swagg'ring blade  Abhorr'd the very name of trade  And lest reflection should be thrown  On him resolv'd to quit the town  And travel where he was not known  In gilded coach and liv'ries gay  To Oxford first he took his way  There beaux and belles his taste admire  His equipage and rich attire  But nothing was so much ador'd  As his fine silverhilted sword  Tho' short and small 'twas vastly neat  The sight was deem'd a perfect treat  Beau Ganter begg'd to have a look  But when the sword in hand he took  He swore by G  d it was an  odd  thing  And look'd much like a  taylor's bodkin  His pride was hurt by this expression  Thinking they knew his sire's profession  Sheathing his sword he sneak'd away  And drove for Glo'ster that same dav  There soon he found new cause for grief  For dining off some fine roast beef  One ask'd him which he did prefer  Some  cabbage  or a cucumber  The purseproud coxcomb took the hint  Thought it severe reflection meant  His stomach turn'd he could not eat  So made an ungenteel retreat  Next day left Glo'ster in great wrath  And bade his coachman drive to Bath  There he suspected fresh abuse  Because the dinner was roast  goose  And that he might no more be jeer'd  Next day to Exeter he steer'd  There with some bucks he drank about  Until he fear'd they found him out  His glass not full as was the rule  They said 'twas not a  thimble  full  The name of thimble was enough  He paid his reck'ning and went off  He then to Plymouth took a trip  And put up at the Royal Ship  Which then was kept by Caleb Snip  "Snip Snip" the host was often call'd  At which his guest was so much gall'd  That soon to Cambridge remov'd  There too he unsuccessful prov'd  For tho' he fill'd his glass or cup  He did not always drink it up  The scholars mark'd how he behav'd  And said a  remnant  sha'n't be sav'd  The name of remnant gall'd him so  That he resolv'd to York he'd go  There fill'd his bumper to the top  And always fairly drank it up  "Well done" says Jack a buck of York  "You go thro'  stitch  Sir with your work"  The name of stitch was such reproach  He rang the bell and call'd his coach  But ere he went enquiries made  By what strange means they knew his trade  "You put the cap on and it fits"  Reply'd one of the Yorkshire wits  "Our words in common acceptation  Could not find out your occupation  'Twas you yourself gave us the clue  To find out both your trade and you  Vain coxcombs and fantastic beaus  In
