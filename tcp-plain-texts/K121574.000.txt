 THE PATRIOT ENTERPRIZE OR An Address to BRITAIN A POEM  Inscribed to the Right Hon WILLIAM PITT  c c  By Mr JONES Author of the Earl of ESSEX  To which is added the  PRUSSIAN  CAMPAIGN A POEM  Celebrating The ATCHIEVEMENTS of  FREDERICK  the GREAT in the Years  By  WILLIAM DOBSON  LLB  LONDON  Printed and  DUBLIN  Reprinted for WILLIAM WHITESTONE opposite  Dick  'sCoffeeHouse in  SkinnerRow    THE PATRIOT ENTERPRIZE  ONE Briton yet asserts that aweful name  One Patriot yet supports the glorious theme  Amidst Corruption's flood still spotless seen  A heart still faithful and a hand still clean  Assist him Seraphs stoop from heav'n ye few  That once were Patriots once were firm and true  To Britain's cause ye kindred Spirits glow  Descend and shield him in this storm below  Your shelt'ring wings around his virtue spread  Inspire his heart and crown with wreaths his head  With gleams of Heav'n's pure light his soul array  And all the glories of the Just display  Full in his sight parental Heroes smile  His virtue aidO snatch from fate this Isle  Point out the paths you trod the arms you bore  Bid Truth return and ancient worth restore  Let Britain lift once more her laurel'd head  Above the waves and strike the world with dread  Thou PITT this verse with patient soul attend  Her buckler sword her guardian and her friend  Whose stedfast heart no virtuous toil can tire  Whose tongue is touch'd with Heav'n's resistless fire  In Heav'ns own injur'd cause supreme to shine  With dazzling force with splendors all divine  Thou Man belov'd thy country's boast and choice  To whom afflicted millions lift their voice  Thou last remaining champion of the state  On thee Integrity and Wisdom wait  Still lift thy dreaded arm still still pursue  The monstrous Python and his pois'nous crew  Repeat each righteous blow repeat each wound  And bring the bloated Hydra to the ground  Lo earth and sea and heav'n shall then rejoice  In one triumphant Paean lift their voice  The marks of gratitude ye Britons pay  And strew with thankful wreaths the Patriot's way  Let breathing brass let feeling stone confess  Whilst arches bend and story'd piles express  To ages yet unborn the glorious Man  His falling country's prop whose godlike plan  On curs'd Corruption trod on Faction fell  Who drives th' infernal monsters back to hell  Spurning their gilded baitwho strikes down Fraud  At home our bosom pest our bane abroad  That sap'd the vitals of our sinking pow'r  When hungry Vengeance urg'd the rip'ning hour  Then stood forth PITT unaided and alone  The People's friend yet faithful to the Throne  Trampling on British bribes with Roman scorn  Another TULLY for his country born  To counterwork each villain's dark designs  For Britain too may dread her CATILINES  He comes exulting in a heart sincere  A tongue that strikes Corruption's soul with fear  An arm still ready to redress the cause  Of Majesty oppress'd or injur'd Laws  Like CECIL bold in Virtue's sacred might  Like HAMPDEN glorious when restrain'd by right  Like FAULKLAND servid for his country's good  No pride provokes no faction fires his blood  For Britain's lasting weal his wishes glow  His Patriot heart see pant his blood see flow  Embrace him Britain to thy bosom press  One Patriot Son long long that Son possess  O quickly come thou Genius that sustains  Of Britain's ancient worth the small remains  O quickly come and kindle up those fires  With Freedom's breath that warm'd our godlike sires  The bless'd occasion snatch perhaps the last  And round your liberties a rampart cast  That shall like Nature's laws remain entire  Till Virtue darkens and the stars expire  Th' immortal task begin see Virtue rise  And lift her glorious flag to Britain's eyes  Leaning on PITT her dreaded sword she draws  Whilst angels trumpet wide th' eternal cause  See panting millions to her standard crowd  See Truth assert see Faith proclaim aloud  The grand behestfrom heav'n the sound is spread  Whilst crush'd Integrity uprears her head  Britons be honest to yourselves be just  In this unblemished man repose your trust  PITT the firm phalanx forms with manly pride  Integrity his shield and Truth his guide  See see each venal pest before him fly  Shrink from his voice and shudder at his eye  Such heav'nfraught powers appal the guilty soul  Where vengeance lightens and where thunders roll  Dreadful he marches on and void of fear  With Fortitude his front with Worth his rear  With every virtue see his soul supply'd  With Loyalty with Honour near his side  Auxiliars worthy of a cause design'd  To rescue Nature's right in human kind  From venal leprosy to purge the land  And all the taints of soul Corruption's hand  To push the barrier back that Freedom braves  To mark the bounds of subjects not of slaves  To call up British honesty once more  And ev'ry virtue to its reign restore  Ye Britons join with heart with voice unite  'Tis Wisdom calls you forth and native Right  Let future deeds your present crimes efface  Your fleets and armies that bring back disgrace  Council's o'erthrown by Caution's ghastly dreams  Orders rejected unattempted schemes  O biotfor ever blot the hateful page  Quick cancel Time the ignominious age  From out thy records See a train appears  Of British worthies and of glorious years  See Time by Virtue led o'er Albion smile  Returning Justice bless once more the isle  Exulting Commerce issuing from the main  And Britain's thunder shake the poles again  See Truth ascend her adamantine throne  Despotic Truth eternal and alone  Parent of Wisdom whose unbounded sway  The Virtues bend to and the Worlds obey  Great queen of harmony whence order springs  Whose moral scepter rules the hearts of kings  Before thy throne with Concord's emblems grac'd  See all the Virtues in their order plac'd  Hail sacred Truth O stretch thy ancient reign  O'er Britain's kindred isle call back again  Her golden age of plenty pow'r and wealth  Her honour temperance fortitude and health  Her justice courage conquest and renown  Let tyrants start and tremble at her frown  New brace her arm her trident's strength restore  Hark hark her thunder shakes yon hostile shore  Around the globe her dreaded flag display  Let ocean's utmost bounds her flag obey  Her crimson cross invincible let fly  Above the waves triumphant in the sky  'Tis done see direful Fraud see Discord bound  See hellborn Faction gasping on the ground  See bloated Luxury with famish'd jaws  See curs'd Corruption with her gilded claws  See pois'nous Perfidy with patriot air  See venal Villainy see mad Despair  A ghastly groupe in fell confusion lie  Beneath thy aweful frown O Truth and die  The caverns yawn the rocky bars give way  See Genius burst her bands and spring to day  Spurning the cave accurs'd Corruption's cell  Where Envy broods where venal vapours dwell  Thy bane O Truth see see she joyful soars  She drinks th' etherial ray she high explores  Her native heav'n by Virtue's hand set free  She gains new strength her piercing eye shall see  With tenfold force where Wisdom's secrets lie  Beneath th' abyss above the starry sky  Through Nature's works her mimic hand shall play  Where Freedom prompts where Virtue points the way  Ambition there to blameless heights shall rise  There guiltless Glory gain th' immortal prize  See Sculpture rear her lifecreating hand  See thinking stone on story'd basis stand  There classic piles attract the wond'ring ken  Here Genius dips the pencil and the pen  In kindred lights with friendly ray shall shine  A MASON's muse a HAYMAN's groupe divine  Unrival'd lov'd see HOGARTH's fancy reign  In BUTLER's rich unborrow'd matchless vein  Through blissful scenes the raptur'd mind shall rove  New POPES shall sing new LAMBERTS paint the grove  Did PHIDIAS there indent the magic steel  Did ROUBILIAC instruct the rocks to feel  A HUDSON's teint by beauty's beam refin'd  Shall through th' expansive features call the mind  Nature and Art their utmost pow'r shall shew  And SHAKESPEARS yet unborn and GARRICKS glow  The Arts exult at Virtue's great command  With Taste with Liberty in either hand  Triumphant Britain smiles near near each side  See native Honesty see native Pride  With Grecian worth with Roman bent to vye  Fame at her heart and Glory in her eye  With ancient Rome in her MAECENAS' days  When Judgment gave when Genius wore the bays  With both shall Britain now maintain the strife  To lift up nature and to polish life  Be hence thy high concern be hence thy care  From Gallia's haughty brow provok'd to tear  The rival wreaths a twofold empire gain  Science at land and conquest on the main  By both MINERVAS crown'd O Britain shine  Let learning still let conquest still be thine  Let courage taste and truth thy sons adorn  Let BACONS yet let MARLBOROUGHS yet unborn  For arts and arms above mankind rever'd  By Europe honour'd and by Europe fear'd  Expand the circles of thy vast renown  Let PITT let Virtue wear the immortal crown  THE  PRUSSIAN  CAMPAIGN A POEM CELEBRATING The ATCHIEVEMENTS OF  FREDERICK  the GREAT In the Years  By  WILLIAM DOBSON  LLB

Testimony Of truly affectionate and indeliable Gratitude From his Sincerest Friend WILLIAM DOBSON  THE  PRUSSIAN  CAMPAIGN  c  A PRINCE unrival'd in puissant deeds  Of noblest prowess and unconquer'd soul  I sing and with ambition lyre this verse  Attune the mighty FRED'RICK's honour'd name  Bless'd while my CHARL'MONT his propitious ear  Inclines attentive to the glorious theme  How amply bless'd if by the Bard invok'd  So oft descending Health her genial balm  Would round thee pour benign rekindling fair  Thy roseate bloom thou amiable Youth  Crown'd with each virtue with each grace adorn'd  O that a ray of the celestial flame  That erst illum'd the animated Bard  Who sung of  Eden  and o'er  Eden  's bow'rs  Highsoaring trac'd th' embattel'd Seraphim  In fiery conflict on th' ethereal plains  Beam'd on this breast that I might swift pursue  Thro' every vast design thro' every high  Emprize the great th' inimitable Chief  The Muse in various raptures sweetly lost  This shining path and that by turns surveys  Bewilder'd unresolv'd th' advent'rous task  Where to begin which splendor first which last  To celebrate in song his matchless might  His martial discipline exact or kind  Indulgence to the Brave his active soul  Rapt with fierce fury thro' the glorious field  Or steddiest counsels and deliberate care  But hark the trumpet's clangor rends the sky  And the loud clarions sound the voice of war  Forth issue  Prussia  's troops in various bands  While these to  Leipsic  's walls their rapid march  Direct those to proud  Dresden  's royal tow'rs  When lo th' impetuous monarch in just ire  Arose and with unerring clue pursued  The wily labyrinths of th' ambitious foe  By keen perception trac'd and all their dark  Device and machinations dire disclos'd  Near thrice three circling years his generous Soul  Had cultivated peace whose studious arts  Of peace and martial deeds alike expert  When rous'd at length his wrath with various clouds  From various climes beset the perilous storm  Soon as he saw concentring from afar  Furious he flew and borne on swiftest wing  Pierc'd the perfidious  Saxon  's inmost realms  At FREDERICK'S dread advance the tim'rous  Pole  Instant the court the capital deserts  Leaves his afflicted consort bath'd in tears  Disconsolate and speeds with eager course  His martial pow'rs to  Pirna  's close retreats  Pirna  whose strongfenc'd camp access defy'd  Proud of high battlements and ramparts vast  Fort above fort impenetrably firm  As when the tow'ring Eagle soars the skie  Sublime in numerous flocks th'aerial train  Speed their swift flight to many a winding cell  Deep in the caverns of some craggy rock  Cleft by Time's rigid hand there pant immur'd  With shuddring wingsMean time the vigilant Chief  Three several hosts their several charge assign'd  There to secure  Silesia  's plains and here  His native realms defend should  Russia  pour  Th' unnumber'd legions from her fertile loins  Himself the  Saxon  troops as couch'd they lay  Wrapt in the bosom of their shelt'ring camp  Nor daring to the field with pow'rful force  Invests on every hand environ'd round  Yet still the generous Prince his ire repress'd  And while th' avenging sword his arm display'd  That stretch'd the gentle olive forth fair pledge  Of amicable peace The  Pole  that pledge  Disdain'd thro'  Austrian  's vaunted aid secure  Forthwith from every circle stem decrees  Loudechoing mandates comminations dire  Fraught with each pompous circumstance of wrath  Pour through the Empire levelling their rage  At mighty  Brandenburgh  In furious tides  Russia  rolls down her thund'ring menaces  Whom thy vain insolence superb  Versailles  Thy haughty taunts succeed He unappall'd  With ample breast receives th' united storm  Firm as the stately promontory's height  Erect by surges lash'd on every side  Foaming redundant on the bigswoln main  His elevated brow o'er the mad waves  Rears it's dread honors and disdains their roar  Now while the  Saxons  with their hapless Prince  Clung to the trenches and the fort embrac'd  In deep despair involv'd' no succour nigh  Exhausted spiritless by  Prussian  troops  Encompass'd sore at length th' auxiliar host  From  Austria  's land in numerous squadrons move  Led by their mightiest Chieftain  Count Brown  Swift they march  As swift great FREDERICK whose quickdarting eye  No hostile motion scap'd his troops to join  Hastes where experienc'd KEITH his standard rear'd  All in a moment tow'ring in the van  Of choice battalions form'd to  Tournitz  's walls  He drives his rapid way Thither anon  March his whole host in two main columns rang'd  Obsequious to his high behests Nor staid  Th' impatient Heroe till  Welmina  's plains  He reach'd thence to his view at once appear'd  Austria  's vast pow'rs from wing to wing display'd  E'er yet the parting Sun his western goal  Attain'd light's scant remains the vigorous Chief  Seiz'd and explor'd the plains whence to assail  The foe at earliest dawn The night's long stage  His troops the rigour of th' inclement sky  With hearts unchill'd endure He in the front  Preeminent in danger and in toil  Unmindful of repose his list'ning bands  Incessant animates with liveliest cheer  And with endearing accents fires their souls  "My glorious partners in the bold emprize  On many a wellfought field in me your friend  In me your fire behold The morning sun  Or my presages err shall see the plains  With  Austrian  corses strown Myself shall share  Each perilous attempt each brave exploit  Witness and amply recompence Pursue  Yon path where glory where your country's love  Invites and  Pruassia  's still unsullied fame  Thus while he spake th'invigorated troops  Glow with fresh fire and feel the gen'rous flame  Glance thro' their thrilling veins the loit'ring Sun  They chide impatient panting for the field  Scarce blush'd the morn with streaks of orient day  FREDERICK upsprung with his attendant Chiefs  Led forth the valiant troops their various bands  In strong battalions regularly ranged  Line after line and file succeeding file  Here the right wing display'd and there the left  Each on a tow'ring hill In order due  Onward they march when in broad front appear  Austria  's equestrian bands array'd for war  "Advance said mighty  Brandenburgh  advance  Rush to the plains and Horse to Horse oppose  Swift they descend and with impetuous force  Burst on the foe when from the hostile rear  Sudden the latent enginry disgorge  Hurl'd from their brazen throats the flaming balls  Innumerable at the dire din alarm'd  And storms of thund'ring metal back they bend  Their not imprudent steps then form'd afresh  To the brisk charge return Now nor the roar  Of bellowing cannon nor incessant fire  Nor wideextended dyke nor obvious mound  Retard with furious onset the fierce steeds  And their dismounted warriors down they trod  In groans expiring welt'ring in their gore  In heaps on mangled heaps o'erthrown nor ceas'd  Till undistinguish'd sunk th' imperial Horse  All sunk in universal ruin whelm'd  Forthwith downrushing from the mountain's brow  FREDERICK's fierce Infantry with furious speed  Thro' iron tempests and thro' floods of fire  To  Low' schatz  's walls intrepid flew assail'd  With unresisted force th' astonied foe  Repell'd and from their boasted fortress drove  With rout on rout confounded The fell stroke  Vienna  's General mourns his scattered host  Driving precipate to  Budin  's plains  FREDERICK triumphant on the foughten field  Stands and surveys the soil with thousands slain  And thousands wide o'erspred whose nobler doom  The captive warriors envy and admire  Amid the illstar'd train gall'd at his fate  Undaunted  Lobkowitz'  superior tow'rs  With clouded aspect and indignant mien  Hail mighty  Prussia  hail With eagle wing  Hov'ring around thee Victory attend  They every march Beneath the hallow'd shade  Rest thee awhile thy noble toil suspend  Deign o'er thy brows to bind this laurel wreath  Th'ambitious Muse with pleasing labour wove  How did thine heart exult when thou surveyd'st  Thy daring legions by thy conduct fir'd  And all thy emulous Chiefs above those Chiefs  Highblazing as the peerless Star that leads  Th'ethereal host o'er the wide azure pour'd  Resplendent train Next thee great BEVERN shone  Sublime and darted terror on the foe  Reflecting his illustrious Monarch's rays  Nor valiant MULLER shall thy prowess pass  Unsung who with resistless might dispers'd  Th'embattel'd ranks like clouds of sleeting sand  Driv'n by th'impetuous whirlwind's rapid wing  With these the tribute of th'applauding bard  Unnumber'd heroes claim whose various deeds  Were long to trace The gen'rous FREDERICK's love  Shall crown their merits and their glorious names  Live in the records of immortal fame  Thence to the  Saxon  bands in  Pirna  's fort  Immur'd he wings his way bent to subdue  That treach'rous foe Nor long e'er from the camp  Th'imprison'd squadrons start o'er  Egra  's streams  From the bridg'd path while sable Night resum'd  Her reign alternate and th'incumbent mists  Spred o'er heaven's face impenetrable gloom  Deep'ning the wonted shades How vain th'attempt  Their wiles how frustrate The vast summit's height  Fronting thy turrets  Koningstein  with march  Laborious as they climb th'uprising sun  Shew'd them to PRUSSIA's view whose strong defiles  Enclos'd them round What gleam of hope remains  Where shall they fly how force th'obstructed way  Aghast and thunderstruck th'obdurate King  His highswoln pride submits in suppliant terms  Sues for that peace he insolently scorn'd  Thus quell'd proud  Austria  and th'ambitious  Pole  Flung from his tow'ring hopes the wint'ry storms  On blustring  Boreas  and bleak  Eurus'  wings  Rushing impetuous with malignant blasts  Warn to retire from forth the tented field  His troops th' indulgent Chief albeit inur'd  To each severe extreme his welllov'd troops  Withdraws and to his  Saxon  camp retires  Soon as the balmy Zephyrs' earliest gales  Led on the genial spring great FREDERICK's breast  Fraught with deep counsels in still silence form'd  Sudden unfolds His ev'ry valiant band  Instant he summons at his great command  Their tacit march they speed and swift attain  Bohemia  's realm three formidable hosts  This the fam'd BEVERN that brave SCHWERIN led  The third their Monarch's fav'rite conduct boasts  War soon resumes his flaming torch Again  Imperial  Austria  's congregated pow'rs  Appear in numerous squadrons firmly rang'd  A mighty host and KONINGSEGG commands  Deep was their rear entrench'd by village walls  Their right was shelter'd by impervious woods  Encompass'd the left wing Yet not the less  BEVERN impetuous drove his rapid bands  By every valiant Chieftain well sustained  Storm'd the strong cover thro' th' intrenchments rush'd  And pierc'd their dense array In sudden rout  All their vast cavalry involv'd the Foe  Astonish'd views while gallant LESWITZ springs  Fierce and undaunted 'mid the hostile fire  Swift flies thro' many a perilous defile  And with dread chase pursues the timorous host  Havoc and ruin marching in their rear  From hill to hill in wild confusion driv'n  To join thee BEVERN bends his eager course  Intrepid SCHWERIN to thy soul endear'd  By kindred Virtue's ever sacred tie  Him to ensnare within cover'd dale  Lurks the secreted foe a numerous band  Soon their insidious wiles the wary chief  Espied encounter'd and discomfited  Thence his impetuous progress onward rolls  Wide o'er the land unbounded uncontroll'd  With torrent force Before his fiery sword  On every hand they scour nor dare confront  His mighty rage inactive down they throw  Their unavailing arms The regions round  Bend to the victor and confess his sway  Now mighty FRED'RICK with observant ken  Saw where the foe their various squadrons drew  From the tow'rd fortress and each banner'd host  Rang'd in proud pomp beneath their mightiest Chief  Who from the terror of dread PRUSSIA's arm  So late retreated with sad overthrow  Gall'd on  Welmina  's memorable plains  Yet dares again by conscious valour fir'd  Again his thundring arm dread PRUSSIA rears  Impatient of delay with instant march  O'er  Moldaw  's streams he pass'd when lo in camp  Highfenc'd by nature's favour and by art  Strongcover'd deepentrench'd proudly deem'd  Impregnable th' imperial Army lay  Much glorying in their strength in numbers far  Superior Still undaunted his bold march  FRED'RICK pursues He nor their 'vantag'd ground  Nor highfenc'd camp nor trenches deep regards  Nor numbers far superior On he leads  To the fierce combat his courageous bands  They by their Monarch's voice that fav'rite voice  Enliven'd joyous spring with sweet presage  Of victory their standards wide unfurl'd  In awful pomp with rich emblazonry  Of vivid colours streaming to the wind  And o'er the horrent plain of glitt'ring steel  A wavy Harvest formidably gleam'd  Innumerable faulchions the sun's blaze  Oft as his radiant beams from fleecy cloud  Emerg'd reflecting fierce with burnish'd sheen  E'er long to be imbru'd in  Austrian  gore  E'er long to be imbru'd in  Austrian  gore  Nigh to the foe advanc'd each Warrior brave  Commanders and Commanded with like zeal  Inflam'd and emulation high contend  Who first shall the untrodden path explore  Who tempt the marish who the threat'ning mound  Clime hazardous plunge thro' the hostile fire  Foremost and burst their serried files Now 'gan  The onset dire enkindled at th' alarm  Of drums loudthundring and the trumpet's clang  Sonorous Fierce the conflict rag'd 'twixt host  And host The field throughout was seen no glimpse  Of dastard fear each nobly signaliz'd  Their valorous ardor Front to front they met  Warrior with warrior clos'd and steed with steed  In stern encounter The hoarse cannon's voice  Echoes with bellowing roar redundant smoke  Pours o'er the envelop'd sky with horrid flash  Pierc'd frequent and quick glance of sulph'rous flames  Swift thro' the ranks undaunted FRED'RICK sprung  High brandishing his faulchion  Austria  's dread  From wing to distant wing unwearied flew  Now in the Van now Rear on ev'ry part  Thro' each vicissitude each varying scene  With splendid conduct animating sounds  And brave example his obsequious bands  Inspir'd directed instigated cheer'd  And all his various pow'rs by turns display'd  Fervid yet vigilant with temper'd fire  Guiding the rapid war's alternate reins  On every part his victor arm prevails  At length o'erpow'r'd discomfited recede  Austria  's faint troops abandoning the field  Drench'd in their slaughter'd friends' commingled blood  How shall the Muse the wondrous havoc paint  The various images of horror trace  O'er the wide champain Now fierceissuing balls  Swept mighty numbers now th'impetuous sword  Clove with keen edge the tortur'd foe in twain  Thro' many a valiant breast with adverse stroke  Pierc'd the sharp wound and fix'd a glorious scar  Here from the quiv'ring trunk the sever'd head  Swift flies here the lop'd limb their lord desert  His agonizing groans and fruitless plaint  In the rude clamour drown'd With giant strides  Death travers'd the dread plain with all his pomp  Of terrors and each ghastly form enclos'd  What multitudes great FRED'RICK by thy arm  Thy just avenging arm what crouds on crouds  Descended to the baleful realms of night  E'erwhile with  Austrian  's throng'd of adverse stars  There jointly they complain their mutual woe  Sooth with condolence bland and enterchange  Sad gratulation soon with gloomy joy  Hailing their mightiest Chieftain new arriv'd  Thy great Antagonist who gor'd with wounds  On the same fatal plain heartpiercing wounds  That barr'd each glorious prospect of renown  At length groan'd forth indignant his high soul  In  Prague  's vain shelt'ring

The thousands foil'd who yet this vital air  Breathe and in thraldom grace the Conqueror's train  Lo what unnumber'd Trophies what rich Spoils  Torn from the grasping foe the solemn pomp  Attend their ravish'd Ensigns wav'd sublime  With splended painture sloating thro' the air  Display puissant FREDERICK's ample fame  See how th' imperial Cannon many a row  Move in slow pageantry the brazen throats  Silenc'd till FREDERICK bid them the dire roar  Renew and on their late Possessors proud  Pour the retorted rageYet 'mid this Scene  In all thy height of lustre matchless Prince  To check thy triumph with th' ingenious tear  Due to the mighty slain on the dread plains  Where grasp'd whole squadrons of th' expiring Foe  Fell valiant SCHWERIN by each virtuous breast  Lov'd and lamented gloriously he fell  With many a Chieftain of exalted name  Accompanied who prodigal of life  Pour'd in their Country's cause their generous blood  Austria  's deep consternation and dismay  Of every aid of her whole camp bereft  What tongue can utter Or what pow'r describe  FREDERICK's vast victoryBut other Scenes  Arise of different hue O hadst thou ne'er  Deserted  Prague  's 'sieg'd wall to charge the foe  Highposted on th' aerial mountain's brow  With legions heap'd on legions firm array'd  Beneath th' imperial DAUN Forgive the Muse  Great Chief who with thy sundry glories charm'd  Yet void of adulation while she strives  With faintest pencil to delineate  Shadowy thy godlike virtues paints thee  man  The wisest of whose race discreetest best  'Mid all his shining faculties betrays  Some tincture of th' impure alloy deriv'd  From his frail AncestorSagacious DAUN  With skill th' important situation chose  And look'd disdainful down Tho' fierce defiles  Tho' thund'ring batteries intercept the way  Undaunted FREDERICK with his furious host  Thro' thund'ring batteries and thro' fierce defiles  Up the steep cliff his arduous road maintain'd  Thrice he assay'd the  Austrian  's pow'rful wing  To burst repell'd them thrice yet thrice return'd  Then calm receding with serene retreat  Soft he descends to the subjacent vale  Where  Elbe  her liquid course obliquely rolls  Meand'ring unretarded unpursu'd  Soon  Russia  's legions from her populous clime  With tardy steps advanc'd their ling'ring march  Accelerate and FREDERICK'S realms invade  Thus tho' insulted the considerate Chief  With terms of mild composure deigns invite  Moscow  's imperial Queen his plan t' embrace  Surceasing hostile rage and war's dire flames  Extinguishing o'er harrass'd  Europe  pour  The salutary boon of prosp'rous Peace  His generous terms disdain'd his pow'r defy'd  His territories spoil'd war he declares  Immediate trusting in his righteous Cause  And Heav'n's protecting Arm LEWHALD led on  The squdrons and encounter'd more than twice  His force entrench'd on tow'ring hill secure  Nathless he vigorous charg'd their foremost lines  Burst and on every hand destruction dealt  Widewasting Yet lest the superior Foe  Crush his brave host by the unfriendly site  Disfavour'd by enormous multitudes  Oppress'd to  Velau  's camp the Chief mature  Retreated unrepulsed The  Moscovites  Dismay'd nor studious of pursuit lament  Their thousands slaughter'd and their  General Lapuchin  General thrall'd  Now in their several camps each Host enwrapt  Retire and War's tremendous thunder rests  Suspended when at once their sudden flight  Assaying  Russia  's troops with rapid speed  Scud as precipitant as slow they advanc'd  E'erwhileBut lo the fierce confed'rate Pow'rs  Vaunting united terrors onward move  Under their gallant Leaders great SOUBISE  And HILDBURGHAUSEN Their proud threats t'oppose  FREDERICK delay'd not his assembled troops  He rang'd in just array and thus address'd  "My Friends my Warriors braveThe Foe's advanc'd  PRUSSIA shall meet them Haste we to the field  With you your FREDERICK conquers or expires  Think how we've fought what glorious laurels won  Think on the equitable plea that drew  These valiant swords and vindicate the cause  God be our Guardian Confidence and Shield  He ended on he led his valiant files  Dauntless and bid them storm the the adverse wing  But on the edge of onset his quick eye  Determining instant as lightning's glance  Invert they their position lest the foe  Surround them unnaware Now  Prussia  's Horse  Spring furious on the  Gaul  in front direct  Oppos'd of vast immeasurable depth  The  Gaul  as furious the brisk charge receive  With equal brav'ry Long in dubious scale  Hung the fierce conflict till the  Gallic  bands  Swerv'd to the neighbouring summit's resuge flew  And recent form'd FREDERICK their rallied force  Soon disarray'd and with pursuit severe  Drove as the Lion drives his trembling chace  Then from each host the Cannon's bellowing voice  Incessant roar'd  Prussia  's bold infantry  Rush forth and battery after battery gain  With storms impetuous and unwearied fire  Rage their artillery on either wing  The foe sore galling till constrain'd they speed  Their ignominious flight with soul defeat  Confounded and in ruin dire involv'd  And but the Sun now prone descended swift  To th' Ocean waves and allinvolving night  Threw her deepshaded mantle o'er the plains  Fav'ring their trepid flight of that vast host  Who spread at morning dawn their vaunted files  So proud how few had from the deathful field  Return'd to tell the melancholy tale  Thou Miracle of Chiefs and will our Sons  Believe by storied Chronicles inform'd  How  Brandenburgh  's illustrious Prince with force  Immensely disproportionate subdu'd  Thousands on thousands of confederate Hosts  What numerous squadrons of the slaughter'd foe  Fell in their prime of Youth Of  Prussian  blood  How slight th' effusion what redundant tides  Of captiv'd troops the Victor's camp o'erflow'd  The generous FREDERICK his triumphant joy  Attempers sweet with piety humane  For guiltless Widows and for Orphan babes  Thus multiplied by his victorious arm  Nobly compassionate to the fallen foe  With blandest treatment he beguiles their pain  Pours the soft balm in their freshbleeding wounds  And bids Captivity her dejected head  Rear and unbend her brow with grateful smile  Now shall the humbled  Gaul  his vaunts suspend  And  Moscow  tremble at the  Prussian  name  Austria  has felt by oft repeated scourge  What martial discipline effects what the wise Chief's  Assiduous Care how fires each manly breast  To bold emprizes FREDERICK'S generous Soul  His fond Affection and paternal Love  In boundless streams impartially diffus'd  And thou ambitious POLE thy lawless pride  Repress nor with vain arrogance aspire  Grasping at alien realms with wiser aim  Guard well thy own and to fair
