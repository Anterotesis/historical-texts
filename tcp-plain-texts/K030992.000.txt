 AN  APPENDIX  TO THE HISTORY OF THE CrownInn With a KEY to the Whole  LONDON  Printed for J MOOR and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price  d  APPENDIX  TO THE HISTORY OF THE CrownInn  c  _I Must assure you that had I not thro' the great Hopes and Expectation of seeing you e're this omitted something in my last which I thought proper to communicate to you and would have done it Personally if our good Stars had so directed I should have had no farther Occasion of adding to all my former being of themselves sufficiently long and tiresome  As in the greatest Variety we are always put to the hardest difficulty in fixing our Choice so in the vast Field the numerous Subjects for Discourse one is at greater loss to put one's Thoughts into any Method for in all Instances we find there is no surer Evidence of a good  Genius  than that which is shewn in the Effect of Choice  I have very great reason to believe that every thing is well receiv'd by you not thro' any Motive but your sincere Friendship nor any Merit but the Subject both I know are particular but one much more worthy your Attention  One wou'd believe by their Actions that a Set of People here are really infected in their Brains and that they lie under the same Influence with Creatures of another Species which have lately been visited with a very odd Distemper There is some kind of correspondency in their Maladies only that which affects the Twolegg'd Creatures seems to be of the most fearful and tremendous Consequence and to threaten the Country in the most dear and tender Part But thank God the Distemper is not Epidemical tho' it seems the Nature of those infected to endeavour all they can to spread it about and to make  others in the same pickle with themselves  The Symptoms they are seiz'd with are a kind of Splenatick Mad Fits not much unlike Madness they foam at the Mouth roll their Eyes and utter strange incoherent Speeches and in this manner go raving up and down the Town The direct Cure for this we know were a Dark Room and Clean Straw with some Manual Exercise slender Diet and other proper Methods to correct the Fumes of the Distemper But at the rate they go on I despair of any Cure for them and were it not for the Honour of living in a Free Country where LIBERTY has been always the Peoples Right they are such as ought rather to be shut up in  Pesthouses  to prevent a Contagion than to breath in the open Air among Men of free and generous Principles  Some of these Creatures appear in  Furr'd Gowns    Tufted Garments  and fit in the  High Places  but are indeed Men of the most shallow and humble Understandings and you will find very few among them that act with a Spirit of Disinterestedness or are not attached to the Person of young  Shute  I have scarce Patience to Preface any longer when I think what degenerate Fellows  I treat on Good G  d what is become of that ancient Spirit that used to reign in this Kingdom or for which of our Sins was this stubborn Generation sown among us which have sprung up like the  Tares  that almost choaked the  good Corn  Wou'd they produce an Instance of that Time when they have not been Tumultuous and Troublesome I would spare their Shame unless it were like the D  l  who is good when he is pleased  They had set their Hearts so upon Rule in the  Widow  's Reign when they carry'd their Point as far and sat with as much Security as the memory of any known Time ever afforded them the Days of  Sir JACOB  excepted that 'tis no very great wonder they are so Impatient under their present Circumstances They had really under Her procured a pretty Tenantable Lease few  COPYHOLDS  were firmer and they were endeavouring to get a Grant of the  Inheritance  in  Feesimple  when alas the  Lease  it self depending on one single Life casually expired  Considering the Mischief they might do by the Influence of their former Power and how likely the Desperateness of their Case was to put them upon it what a Happiness must we acknowledge their Stupidity to be in fancying they had Pretensions to Renew it  under Mr WRIGHT And how justly may we impute our Safety to their miserably deceived Expectations and regret the less that it is the deplorable Occasion of their present Inveteracy Rage and Fury  I told you the State they stood in at preferring the  Old Servants  again and the grievous Clamours they raised against it tho' their justifying the same thing in the  Widow  had made it a very remarkable Precedent which of all Men they ought to be the last to Censure But Nature is predominant 'Tis true one Inconveniency seems to arise from their being displaced which is that they are too much at leizure to Plot and Cabal with the  Friends  of young  Shute  who by that Encouragement and Addition to their  Party  begin to gather Life again and to rouze themselves from a Despair that the late Alteration had thrown them into Their Business is now to act in concert together and not unlikely as Propperties to each other the  Family of the Bulls  by their Assistance to introduce themselves into Power again and the other by assisting them to advance the Interest of young  Sir Jacob  One thing in this is certain that they have united their Forces again and the daily Clamours and Disturbances we hear of in the Country are the true Effects of it 'Tis strange that the  BULLS FAMILY  who  have always been the Tools to  Sir JACOB  and his  Issue  should not once endeavour to honour themselves by disclaiming so scandalous a Correspondence But Reproofs are vain  The  Widow  poor Woman began severely to feel the Effect of Patronizing them so long and 'tis pity a Life of such Consequence should be sullied with their  MISCARRIAGES  I can hardly mention without Tears the Advantage it may give Posterity of treating her Memory with Contempt and obscuring a History that would else have appeared as bright as the Element her own Vertues shone in and could have been liable to no Contradiction from the most partial  Pen  But we will forgive them this forgive the sad Occasion of her Death But shall we forgive their going on in the same Road their repetition of Practices that have always been pernicious to the Interest of their Country 'Tis well known they were her Aversion the least of her Care or Concern for Nine Years which they sufficiently revenged by teazing her out of her Life in less than half the time and heaping on her anxious Head as great a weight of Trouble and Perplexity as their Predecessors the  OLD SERVANTS  had  loaded with accumulated Glory and Advantages  But I will have done with this Repetition you know the Truth of it too well already Do but revolve the Passages and Incidents of their last short Reign for you must understand they have been in Power in other past Times to as good a Purpose and you will find that not one single Action or Consequence went well from the very footing of their Administration Unless you will believe that idle Story trumpt up by them at that time of their beginning with Saving the  Church  which in reality never flourished with greater Tranquillity than during the  Widow  's time And I believe they will themselves acknowledge when they have not a mind to be merry with us that it was the highest Insolence and Affront to impute the contrary to Her  Now I am speaking of this I cannot but acquaint you with an odd Accident that happen'd here t'other Day An innocent Country Vicar Preaching in Town was Insalted and very rudely Treated by the Parishioners of the BULLIAN PARTY The Offence he was guilty of was  blessing Heaven for the happy Situation of Affairs and the imminent Danger we were lately rescued from  But that is not the Occasion I mention  it on I cannot but smile to think that the first Insult or Indignity literally offered to the  Church  since the time of  Sir JACOB  should be by the  Family of the Bulls  themselves who have always expressed such Reverence and Veneration to the Place and justified the Dignity of its Priests even to Rage and Madness  Had the other Party done as much good Heaven what Clamours wou'd have been raised It could not have escaped the Censure and Construction of their going to pull the  Church  down if no worse I hope they will not forget it together with their pulling down of  Conventicles  if there should be Occasion for the future to mention it to them by way of Alternative  Poor Men they have really been unfortunate for the most part in raising up Precedents against themselves tho' they are the least inclinable to be judged by their own Laws of any Men breathing Had they foreseen the Consequence of justifying the  Wid  w  's Proceeding in Displacing her  Old Servants  and that the Splutter they made about her Right to do it which they termed the highest Insolence in any one to question wou'd so soon have reverted upon themselves they wou'd not probably have been so violent in maintaining the Legality
