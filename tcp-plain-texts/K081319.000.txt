 THE TWO CONNOISSEURS▪ A COMEDY IN RHYME WRITTEN FOR A PRIVATE THEATRE BY WILLIAM HAYLEY ESQ  CALCUTTA PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLXXXV  PERSONS OF THE DRAMA  LORD SEEWELL  MR BERIL  MR BIJOU  MR CYCLE  TOM CARELESS  HARRY Servant to Mr BERIL  MR VARNISH  LADY HARRIOT Daughter of Lord SEEWELL  LADY FRANCES the same  MRS BIJOU  JOAN  THE TWO CONNOISSEURS  ACT THE FIRST SCENE I Chambers in the Temple  Tom Careless  and  Mr Cycle  CARELESS  WHATE'ER the success of your journey may be  My dear rural sage you are welcome to me  Your benevolent projects I hope you'll complete  By this trip from your snug scientific retreat  In return for amusement you've given me there  By your fine apparatus and lectures on air  I'll shew you the town and the town is a science  MR CYCLE  On my tutor dear Tom I've a perfect reliance  For I know in that study what vigils you've kept  CARELESS  'Tis the only one truly where I'm an adept  For as to the law that's the science of thorns  And tho' its black robe my lean figure adorns  Perhaps twice a year for my father's good pleasure  I've renounc'd I confess both its toil and its treasure  From my sapient Lord Coke this advantage I gain  He led me to find out a flaw in my brain  That title on which as wise parents have done  My father laid claim to the seals for his son  MR CYCLE  Such language dear Tom is in truth but a brogue  That betrays the young heir as an indolent rogue  'Tis the cant of ye allye want talents to drudge  CARELESS  Well think me my friend wise enough for a judge  I still must rejoice I have nothing to do  As my heart now inclines me to wait upon you  I wish I could raise you the cash you require  But you know I depend on a closehanded sire  Who promises largely and often has said  He will make me a Croesus whenever I wed  But to drive me I think to the conjugal state  Keeps the purse of the batchelor woefully strait  And guineas at present are scarce to my sorrow  How much are you now come to London to borrow  Two thousand d'ye say  MR CYCLE  Yes two thousand at least  And perhaps rather more as my plan is increas'd  I wish for no profit but public esteem  And much good to the world must arise from my scheme  CARELESS  Well I wish you may prosper but as I'm a sinner  I as soon should expect a roast Phoenix for dinner  As in times like the present such loans from a friend  When Opulence has not a stiver to lend  You philosophers look with contempt upon cash  But the fools of this town are so fond of the trash  That as you're a chemist both skilful and bold  You had best try to make a few odd lumps of gold  And this newlyfound art you may try with less cost  Since to borrow with ease seems an art that is lost  MR CYCLE  Dear Careless you're welcome to rally my hopes  So attack them with all your rhetorical tropes  The man is illwrapt in philosophy's cloak  Whose bosom is ruffled dear Tom by a joke  I know money's scarce yet I will not despond  I've two friends who'll supply what I want on my bond  CARELESS  What  two  such good friends so rich open and free  Dear Cycle I pray introduce them to me  For not one of that cast my long list can produce  Why man such a friend is the goldenegg'd goose  You may hunt for the bird e'en as long as you're able  But at last you will find it is only a fable  I wanted but one hundred pounds t'other day  And ask'd fifty friends that chance threw in my way  But they all shook their heads with a negative nod  So I dunn'd my old father in spite of the rod  But pray do I know the good creatures you mean  MR CYCLE  Aye bothThey're two friends whom for years I've not seen  But in juvenile days I held each as my brother  And I trust that we all are still dear to each other  You're acquainted with Beril  CARELESS  Well there I confess  Your wishes have some little chance of success  If there's one in the world who regardless of pelf  Would relieve a friend's wants tho' he straiten'd himself  You have now nam'd the man Yet perhaps he can't lend  I know he has suffer'd by aiding a friend  And I fancy he has but a slender estate  'Tis true he don't play tho' carest by the great  Yet in statues and books he's expensive 'tis said  I have seen him bid high for a porphyry head  MR CYCLE  'Tis hard fortune still should torment him with crosses  I sooth'd him to bear the severest of losses  I was with him when blasted in youth's blooming charm▪  His lovely Sophia was torn from his arms  You knew not I think that unfortunate fair  The victim of cruelty love and despair  She was bound to our friend by a mutual affection  But her rich sordid parents oppos'd the connection  The canker of sorrow incessantly prey'd  On the perishing bloom of the delicate maid  Her duty her suff'rings made nature relent  And wrung from her father a tardy consent  But death render'd vain the late sanction he gave  And his child's bridal bed was the pitiless grave  Many years have now soften'd the lover's wild grief  Perhaps some new beauty now yields him relief  He's still single I think  CARELESS  Yes in learning and art  He has sought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart  Hence a pleasing mild elegance runs thro' his life  And had I a sister I'd wish her his wife  But now for your second friendWhat is his name  For acquaintance with him too I'll certainly claim  You say that I know him come tell me who is it  MR CYCLE  Yes indeed it is one whom you frequently visit  And here you must own that my hopes are well founded  Since in kindness and wealth he has ever abounded  And a legacy lately  CARELESS  You don't mean Bijou  That collector of knickknacks  MR CYCLE  Indeed Tom I do  I've a title to ask any favor from him  He has some little vanity some little whim  Yet still he's a friendly benevolent man  CARELESS  You may rap at his doorbut get in if you can  Your friend when you saw him was jocund and free  His heart full of bounty his spirit of glee  His vanities too had so mirthful a cast  That Friendship herself even wish'd them to last  But Marriage that changer of mind and of feature  Has made poor Bijou quite a different creature  MR CYCLE  I am told that his wife with a pocket well laden  Was a little fat ancient and wellbehav'd maiden  Who having a similar taste for virtù  Put her cabinet under the care of Bijou  CARELESS  Yes indeed in an odd fit of amorous hunger  He married an old curiositymonger  Who is ready to faint if a visitor knocks  While she's brushing the dust from her rareeshew box  Her maid t'other day threw her into a swoon  By cracking the eye of a great stuff'd baboon  For instead of young children whose troublesome noise  Might disturb their sedate  virtuosical  joys  She fills their fine house with new monsters or mummies  MR CYCLE  Of your story dear Tom I perceive what the sum is  You don't like the ladyshe may not please you  And yet be an excellent wife for Bijou  I am told she has really much merit and taste  In her morals they say she's remarkably chaste  So with lectures perhaps she has wounded your ear  And you rakes of the Temple may think her severe  CARELESS  No faith with the lady I stand very well  I bought her esteem with an old empty shell  I own she has piety morals and sense  To chastity no one will doubt her pretence  But tho' with these virtues I freely invest her  My heart I confess is inclin'd to detest her  She has ruin'd her husbandat least so I think  To a dwarf she has made his benevolence shrink  And puff'd up his vanity into a giant  To all her strange whims he's so servilely pliant  He'd obey her caprice whatsoe'er it might hint  And deny himself bread to buy her an odd flint  MR CYCLE  Why Tom that's a proof of his fond tender heart  CARELESS  To me it proves nought but her ladyship's art  And so you yourself would explain the whole riddle  If you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle  As a more wretched brush never blotted poor paper  And ne'er squeak'd a Cremona beneath a worse scraper  Tho' pamper'd with flattery thus by his wife  Our friend has quite lost all his humor and life  And whenever I look on his cold chearless face  As he stands by the side of his wife's fossilcase  I think her a perfect Medusa I own  Who has turn'd her poor husband himself into stone  MR CYCLE  You loungers dear Tom in your idle disputes  Love to ridicule all life's amusing pursuits  But they all have their use and the lady who joys  In collecting an odd set of whimsical toys  Is herself a rare gem that my judgment regards  More than all the fair votaries of scandal and cards  I know I shall like her in spite of your stricture  And I'm going to see how you've fail'd in her picture  My old friend's goodwill I shall put to the trial  And solicit his aid without fear of denial  CARELESS  Come alongI will see if your welcome is hearty  Indeed I may serve you by joining the party  And I'm eager to know for my portrait is true  What you think of the change she has wrought in Bijou  To a knowledge of nature I ne'er will pretend  If when you have seen in the house of our friend  All the natural rarities rang'd in a glass  You don't rank his heart in the petrified class  Exeunt  SCENE changes to a Drawing Room at  Mrs Bijou'  s with a Door open into an interior Cabinet of Curiosities Several stuff'd Creatures and other Rarities discovered in the Apartment  JOAN  with a Brush  Lackaday would I once were well out of this house  Where I tremble to move full as much as a mouse  And Nanny's afraid to come into this room  Indeed the poor creature can scarce hold a broom  For my mistress she says has done nothing but bait her  Since she brush'd off the tail of the new alligator  I've a great mind to lay up my brush on the shelf  And leave madam to dust all her monsters herself  Would my master would make her for these stocks and stones  A young little plaything of good flesh and bones  But alas these old ladies who can't raise a baby  Are as full of nonsensical maggots as may be  And our house is so cramm'd with this whimsical jumble  That if you touch one thing another will tumble  Madam says I misplace whatsoever I clean  But I'll venture to wipe off the dust from this screen  Throws it down▪  A plague take the things they do nothing but fall  Lud my fingers have run thro' the cover and all  Taking up the Screen and uncovering it  'Tis my master's new drawinghow madam will thunder  This fine naked beauty I've torn quite asunder  And the rent must be seenI can thrust my whole thumb in  And I've no time to mend itmy mistress is coming  MRS BIJOU  entering in a dark brown Bedgown with a Brush of Peacock's Feathers  Some new mischief's done hereLord Joan what's the matter  I am sure you broke somethingI heard such a clatter  JOAN  Indeed Ma'am I've had a most cruel disaster  The screen  MRS BIJOU  What the beautiful work of your master  JOAN  My finger slipt thro' as I wip'd it in haste  But I'm sure I can mend it again with some paste  MRS BIJOU  You awkward pert hussy pray let it alone  Can paste mend a flaw in a goddess's zone  Ye stars give me patienceGet out of this door  And pray let me never set eyes on you more  I knew I should suffer as soon as you came  For taking a thing with so gothic a name  JOAN  I'll gofor I live but the life of a cur  Yet pray on my name do not throw any slur  I am sure 'tis good English altho' it is Joan  And that's more than you're able to say of your own  Exit  MR BIJOU  entering  What's the matter my dearWhat new plague from your maids  You for ever are vext by these pestilent jades  If bred in this town you object to their morals  If rusties they break all your glasses or corals  Let 'em come whence they will they bring trouble and strife  And your quarrels have made me half sick of my life  MRS BIJOU  Don't say soYou know my dear Mr Bijou  I take no young maids out of fondness to you  And these middleag'd creatures are all so unhandy  They make me as fretful as old Mr Shandy  But my dear if you see me sometimes in a flame  I think you won't say that my temper's to blame  'Twas my love for the works of your delicate hand  Which produc'd an emotion I could not command  If I rated old Joan in a great agitation  I am sure you will own I had much provocation  When you see this sad cause of the bustle between us  She has utterly ruin'd your very best Venus  This new lovely drawing the joy of all eyes  I vow I could cry  MR BIJOU  What sweet softnessshe cries  These feelings indeed prove the true connoisseur  This ill treatment of Art her fine sense can't endure  Henceforth of my works let them say what they will  No painter can boast such a test of his skill  Come chear up my dear Cognoscente come come  I can mend it again with a brushfull of gum  MRS BIJOU  D'ye think you can mend itand won't it look brown  If you don't hide the skin with the skirt of a gown  'Twould be pity to cloak up a body so fine  Especially since you have drawn it from mine  And you know I caught cold when I stript to the waist  To fit for the figure in true attic taste  But I did it from fondness that you might not roam  And wickedly hunt after models from home  To be sure I love artbut all artists they say  By their studies of nature are tempted to stray  And I own that your genius gives me great alarms  MR BIJOU  My dear tender creature pray trust your own charms  MRS BIJOU  Affectionate terrors will rise in my head  I was jealous I own t'other day of the dead  MR BIJOU  What fond sensibility exquisite feeling  MRS BIJOU  I hope I was wrong but strange fancies will steal in  When fondness has open'd the heart to suspicion  You're so dear to the females of every condition  But I hope Lady Fancybird was not so vicious  There was nothing indeed in her air meretricous  Yet a jealous pang seiz'd me I own when I found  That by will she bequeath'd to you three thousand pound  'Tis true that a legacy's very commodious  Yet the money appears to me utterly odious  When I think it was possibly meant as the price  Of endearments to which she had art to entice  And not in return for the pictures you drew  Of her parrot her bullfinch and old cockatoo  MR BIJOU  Lord my dear if such phantoms your quiet consume  You will make the old lady jump out of her tomb  'Tis true that I flatter'd her favourite passion  As I love to be well with old ladies of fashion  But pray don't suppose I was e'er so absurd  As to stroke her pale cheek for the pole of her bird  MRS BIJOU  Ah you humorous man you've such infinite wit  You can turn to a jest whatsoe'er you think fit  But my heart on this point can be never at ease  Unless you'll allow me to spend as I please  Half the money of which you're so oddly possest  Aud then I shall think it an honest bequest  Besides there's an auction at Lady ToyTruckle's  And I long for a rap at the Duchess's knuckles  Who outbid me you know t'other day for a shell  'Tis all for your credit  MR BIJOU  Well well my dear well  I never refuse you the cash I can spare  MRS BIJOU  You are sure I shall turn it to something most rare  For indeed I'm no pitiful hoarder of pelf  And I've now set my heart on some true antient delf  MR BIJOU  Tis time you were drest  MRS BIJOU  As I live there's a rap  I'm not fit to be seen in this bedgown and cap  Run and charge them my dear not to let in a soul  With my cabinet dust I'm as black as a coal  MR BIJOU    looking out    I'm too late  MRS BIJOU  For my orders they don't care a pin  And to vex me old Joan has let somebody in  I'll escapeI can't bear to be seen in this trim  MR BIJOU  'Tis only Tom Carelessyou need not mind him  Enter  Careless  and  Mr Cycle  CARELESS  Here good folks I have brought you a very rare bird  'Tis five years since his notes in this town have been heard  MR BIJOU  Mr Cycle my worthy old friend how d'ye do  Give me leave to present to you Mrs Bijou  MRS BIJOU  I'm asham'd to be found in this garb  MR BIJOU  O my dear  From a man of true science you've nothing to fear  He'll freely allow for he's candid and just  Philosophical ladies must dabble in dust  Mr Cycle my wife is a curious collector  In natural knowledge I hope you'll direct her  You are master of all from the earth to the stars  And may aid her in ranging her fossils and spars  MR CYCLE  She shall freely command all the little I know  MRS BIJOU  You're extremely obliging dear Sir to say so  But I cannot attend you in this dusty vest  I'll soon slip it off  CARELESS  You shan't stir I protest  To talk of your dress my dear Ma'am is a joke  To a sage who exists but in chemical smoke  Your robe is indeed like the robe of Saint Bruno  Yet still by your air we might take you for Juno  While the tail of your peacock that type of command  With such dignity waves in your awful white hand  MRS BIJOU  You're a young saucy creature  MR CYCLE  These idle rogues Madam  More like sons of the Serpent than children of Adam  Are apt to esteem it a dull occupation  To study the wonders of this fair creation  And hence they all rally with humour illplac'd  Those who seek for amusement in science and taste  MR BIJOU  Well said Mr CycleI'm glad that Virtù  Has found both a friend and a champion in you  Come and peep at my wife's philosophical treasure  I hope you'll survey it again at your leisure  My dear d'ye allow me to shew your museum  I'm exact in all matters of  tuum  and  meum  MRS BIJOU  My Cycle I'm sure is a privileg'd man  MR BIJOU  It is openCome Sir  Exeunt into the interior Apartment  MRS BIJOU  Tell me Tom if you can  Is not this Mr Cycle a man of great worth  Who wrote a most excellent book on the Earth  CARELESS  'Tis the author himself and I know not what college  Can shew his superior in virtue and knowledge  He's a man of few words with a heart and a mind  Ever busied in schemes for the good of mankind  And he now visits London in hopes to procure  Some support in a plan for relieving the poor  MRS BIJOU  The poorof their name I'm alarm'd at the mention  Mr Cycle indeed may have no ill intention  But I fear he'll involve my good husband in trouble  These projects of charity end in a bubble  The poor are ungrateful disorderly wretches  Who can shift for themselves by their tricks and their fetches  They deserve not a learned philosopher's thought  CARELESS  Your pardonHe'll think if he thinks as he ought  That Philosophy drawing from Heaven her birth  Is the science of soft'ning the evils on earth  By your fears you have done our friend infinite wrong  For tho' his heart's tender his judgment is strong  To the projects of Folly he never can stoop  Philanthropy's friend is not Phantasy's dupe  MRS BIJOU  Why Careless you talk in a language quite new  Who could dream of a charitysermon from you  CARELESS  Oh a cobler can preach when his spirit's inflam'd  Mine is apt to blaze forth if I hear a friend blam'd  And indeed I can't stifle my heart's ebullitions  When such good folks as you harbour vile suppositions  But I'm sure you'll forgive all the warmth I have shewn  When the worth of our friend is to you better known  If you're angry I know that your anger will cease  When you hear on what terms I can purchase my peace  A shell I can bring youmy interest such is  Very like what you lately gave up to the Duchess  Perhaps I may give it you  MRS BIJOU  You're a good soul  As large as her Grace's and perfectly whole  CARELESS  Yes I think 'tis as large and in colour as high  MRS BIJOU  Are you sure of its shape  CARELESS  Do you question my eye  I'll convince you I'm right let us instantly look  At the fine colour'd plates in your great Danish book  MRS BIJOU  Comeyou give me more joy than I'm able to speak  I can't bear that her Grace should possess an  Unique  They retire into the interior Apartment from whence  Mr Bijou  and  Mr Cycle  return  MR BIJOU  This scheme my good friend does you honor indeed  In a business so noble I hope you'll proceed  And may you accomplish your utmost desires  In raising the sum which your project requires  Pray look at this new little drawing of mine  Don't you think it an elegant pretty design  MR CYCLE  Very lively indeedBut my friend you forget  What I've said on the point of incurring this debt  Do not fly from the subjectI hate all evasion  I must say for your aid I have serious occasion  You know what I've ask'd and in asking I deem  That I give you a proof of my cordial esteem  In a poorhouse myself I would rather work hard  Than apply thus to one whom I did not regard  MR BIJOU  Mr Cycle I know you're a man without guile  And you think in a noble and singular style  But if asking for cash is of love a sure test  With affectionate friends all the wealthy are blest  MR CYCLE  I have done as I see that you wish to evade  A request that I thought I with justice had made  As you know when of fortune you felt a reverse  You had once the command of my prosperous purse  And since you of opulence now are possest  More enrich'd too of late by a friendly bequest  I suppos'd without trouble  MR BIJOU  Dear Cycle 'tis true  You shall have it but mum towards Mrs Bijou  MR CYCLE  O I now understand all the cause of demur  And if that is the case I have done my dear Sir  At the hazard of discord the sum you shan't lend  In family strife I'll not plunge my old friend  MR BIJOU  Do not think me a slavethere's no danger of strife  But you'll find if you e'er try the conjugal life  It is best not to waken the frowns of a wife  Besides there is surely no reason why you  Should talk on such business to Mrs Bijou  MR CYCLE  There is certainly noneyou shall do as you please  MR BIJOU  One thousand my friend I can spare you with ease  'Tis the sum I shall go to receive very soon  If you'll call here again you shall have it by noon  And to tell you the truth I would have you make haste  Lest my wife should demand it for matters of taste  When an auction is near she is apt to be rash  In laying her hand upon all my loose cash  And as she is thought so judicious a buyer  Her elegant wishes I seldom deny her  Yet 'tis time to grow prudentbut hush here they come  Remember my chargedear philosopher mum  Enter  Mrs Bijou  and  Careless  MRS BIJOU  O my dear I'm in raptures my young friend has cur'd  All the bitter vexation I've lately endur'd  Now in shells by the Duchess I am not surpast  Tom will bring me the fellow to what she bought last  MR BIJOU  He's exceedingly kindBut my dear it grows late  Remember the guest whom you must not make wait  Old Baron VanBettle's appointed today  Your curious collection of flies to survey  As some business abroad will oblige me to leave him  I entreat you my dear to be drest to receive him  These friends will excuse you  MRS BIJOU  I'll bid them farewell  Mr Cycle your servantRemember the shell  Exit  MR BIJOU  O my friend you've a thousand new drawings to see  I can tell you our artists grow jealous of me  JOAN  entering hastily  Sir a coach is just stopt and a man with a star on  MR BIJOU  Od's life I must leave you to wait on the Baron  MR CYCLE  I beg we mayn't keep you  MR BIJOU  My good friends adieu  Dear Cycle pray meet me again here at two  I am sorry I'm forc'd thus to part with you now  But for such an engagement I'm sure you'll allow  For the slies are all rang'd in the parlour below  And a guest like the Baron one can't leave you know  As the key's in the case he perhaps might unlock it  And whip the best butterfly into his pocket  'Tis a law with the curious to watch a collector  And you never must trust him without an inspector  Exit  CARELESS  Now my friend what d'ye say to the portrait I drew  Were my colours too dark for good Madam Bijou  But how have you sar'd in your moneypetition  If you get it I'll call you a mighty magician  I can tell you that Madam suspected a plot  MR CYCLE  I've his promisebut shall I accept it or not  CARELESS  If you can by all means'twill be sav'd from her clutches  Who would throw it away in outbidding a Duchess  And at auctions indeed she'd her husband undo  Were she not in her house quite a closehanded Jew  But on saving a penny she frequenly ponders  And her avarice scrapes what her vanity squanders  O if I were her master her whimsies I'd cure  And make a good wife of this vile connoisseur  Now for Berilhe's one of a different cast  MR CYCLE  Come alongsince I saw him some long years have past  And I'm eager to clasp his affectionate hand  CARELESS  Stop a moment and answer me this one demand  Don't you see a sad change in our poor friend below  Where's the lively companion the humorous beau  All his pleasantry's gone  MR CYCLE  I confess by his carriage  He seems to be render'd more serious by marriage  CARELESS  By my life I am griev'd in thus seeing him grow  The poor trumpeting slave to his wife's rareeshew  Well ye Gods if whenever my nuptial star twinkles  I should wed an old hunter of odd periwinkles  To engage her nice eye with unchanging attraction  May I turn in her arms to a cold petrifaction  End of ACT I  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE I  An elegant Apartment ornamented with a few Busts and Books a large Statue covered up and a Door open into a more extensive Library  Mr Beril  and  Harry  MR BERIL  PRAY Harry remove from the statue its case  And be careful in clearing the dust from its base  HARRY  Directly Sir  MR BERIL  Yes you must instantly do it  For my worthy Lord Seewell is coming to view it  Now my sweet Lady Frances I soon shall behold  All thy quick sensibility wake and unfold  Thou wilt pay to this sculpture the tribute most dear  Thou wilt praise the fine work by an eloquent tear  Unless by gay Harriot thy softness is check'd  How I long in thy features to mark the effect  Produc'd by the wonders of exquisite art  On a delicate mind and a sensible heart  But why on thy graces do I rashly dwell  Why study those charms that I know but too well  In my station 'tis madness to think of thy hand  Yet thou of all women in this lovely land  Thou only could'st fill in my desolate breast  The place that my tender Sophia possest  HARRY    advancing    There Sir 'tis as neat as a newtwisted cord  But I hope you won't sell this fine thing to my Lord  He's a desperate bidder for stonework I'm told  Yet I hope you will keep it in spite of his gold  MR BERIL  Do you hope sopray why I should rather have thought  You'd rejoice if his lordship the statue had bought  It would save you some trouble  HARRY  For that I don't care  Why I wish you to keep it I'll freely declare  I've observ'd since the day that poor Miss Sophy died  And that's five years I think next Bartholomewtide  There is only this statue that's now in our sight  In which you have seem'd to take any delight  And if this marble woman your heart so engages  Before you should sell her I'd give up my wages  MR BERIL  Thou'rt a generous lad with an excellent heart  Honest Harry the statue and I shall not part  But I hear a coach stophaste and let my Lord in  Exit  Harry  MR BERIL    alone    Harry's warmth is affecting'Tis pleasant to win  A regard unconstrain'd from the low ranks of life  Which are falsely suppos'd full of baseness and strife  How mistaken is he who incessantly raves  That domestics are nothing but idiots or knaves  When nature oft shines with a lustre most fervent  In the zeal of an honest affectionate servant  Enter  Lord Seewell  with  Lady Frances  and  Lady Harriot  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Beril my girls would attend me to see  Either you or your statueHowe'er that may be  I know you'll allow them a sight of your treasure  MR BERIL  My Lord I confess I had hopes of this pleasure  And my statue henceforth I more highly shall rate  Since to that I'm in debt for an honour so great  LADY HARRIOT  That's right Mr BerilI pray make it known  That we come for the sake of the marble alone  For tho' we have both a fair name as I think  Yet our poor reputations will instantly sink  If 'tis said by your neighbour old Lady SnapFan  That instead of a statue we visit a man  MR BERIL  If on spirit and worth there is any reliance  Lady Harriot may set every hag at defiance  And force even Scandal in silence to sit  If not just to her innocence aw'd by her wit  LADY HARRIOT  My dear Sir do not talk in so pleasing a tone  If you do I shan't relish the silence of stone  And the statue'll seem dullSo pray tell us where is it  Pray present us to her that we're now come to visit  MR BERIL  Here's the lady you honour  Shewing the Statue  LORD SEEWELL  Indeed this is fine  What perfect expression what strength of design  MR BERIL  Pray my dear Lady Frances advance to the place  Which will give you I think the best view of the face  'Tis the tender Alcestis just yielding her breath  On the arm of her husband reclining in death  And tho' pain o'er her form so much langour has thrown  You may still discern beauties resembling your own  LORD SEEWELL  Whence came it dear Beril'tis surely antique  The work my good friend is undoubtedly Greek  I swear the Laocoon is not so fine  Had I choice of the two this I'm clear would be mine  The subject more pleasing expression still higher  This longhidden treasure where could you acquire  MR BERIL  I owe it to chance to acknowledge the truth  And a princely and brave Neapolitan youth  Whom I luckily sav'd in a villainous strife  From the dagger of jealousy aim'd at his life  The work was dug up on his father's estate  And knowing my passion for marble is great  He nobly has sent me the gift in your view  In return for what accident led me to do  LORD SEEWELL  'Tis the first piece of sculpture perhaps on the earth  And I hardly know how to appreciate its worth  But if ever you wish to dispose of the treasure  I'll accept it at three thousand guineas with pleasure  MR BERIL  My Lord you now speak with that liberal spirit  Which you ever display when you estimate merit  Tho' I own works of art of such high estimation  Seem but ill to agree with my fortune and station  Yet these figures at present I wish to retain  Tho' the wish may appear ostentatious and vain  But my Lord if they e'er change their master anew  They shall find a more worthy possessor in you  LADY HARRIOT  Well ye dear connoisseurs you amaze me I own  By the value you set on this sorrowful stone  I indeed can believe 'tis a fine piece of art  But to buy it for furnitureas to my part  I'd as soon o'er my house throw a sepulchre's gloom  And purchase from WestminsterAbbey a tomb  LORD SEEWELL  You're a wild idle gipsy and past all correcting  You have not the least relish for what is affecting  LADY HARRIOT  That's your fault dear Papabut my sister you see  Makes ample amends for this failing in me  She gazes like you with such serious delight  That she's half turn'd to marble herself by the sight  I vow it has made her unable to speak  And has drawn a cold tear down her petrified cheek  LADY FRANCES  Pray my dear don't expose me  MR BERIL  O seek not to hide  What nature design'd your chief beauty and pride  With different charms she enriches the earth  To your sister she gave the sweet dimples of mirth  And that each in her province no rival may find  All the soft pensive graces to you she assign'd  LADY HARRIOT  Believe me you shine Mr Beril most brightly  In the delicate science of praising politely  In which many beaux are so savagely stupid  They a scalpingknife take for the weapon of Cupid  And to tickle one nymph basely slash every other  Well dear Frances how are you  LADY FRANCES  Indeed I can't smother  What I feel in surveying this wonder of art  It has something which takes such fast hold of the heart  In the faint dying wife such a fond resignation  In the poor widow'd husband such wild agitation  Such sorrow such anguish such love to Alcestis  LADY HARRIOT  That is true but I know the whole story a jest is  And Admetus I think such a shuffling poltroon  That he moves me no more than the man in the moon  A pitiful fellow to live in his case  And let his poor wife pass the Styx in his place  Modern husbands indeed I believe would be merry  If their wives in their stead would cross over that ferry  MR BERIL  But perhaps Ma'am you think that no husband could find  A young modern wife of Alcestis's mind  LADY HARRIOT  No indeed my good SirHere's my dear sister Fan  She'd be willing to die to preserve her good man  But I own for myself I should doubt and demur  If I thought my spouse wish'd his own trip to defer  Tho' myself to his fortunes I'd freely devote  If we both might embark at one time in the boat  I confess I should scarce be so wondrously kind  As to set sail myself but to leave him behind  HARRY    entering    Two gentlemen Sir wish to see you below  Mr Careless is one  LORD SEEWELL    to  Mr Beril  Harriot's favourite beau  LADY HARRIOT  Lord Papa Mr Beril will think me in love  MR BERIL    to  Harry  Let the gentlemen know we expect them above  Exit  Harry  LORD SEEWELL  Tom and Harriot have long had flirtations together  But their courtship has changeable fits like the weather  The improvident girl thinking lovers are plenty  Declares she won't wed till she's past oneandtwenty  Nor e'en then take her beau in her charms such her trust is  Unless he bids fair to become a chief justice  And Tom is the heir of too large an estate  To load his gay spirit with law's heavy weight  But here comes our young lawyer to urge his own plea  Enter  Careless  and  Mr Cycle  MR BERIL  My dear Tom how d'ye doMy good stars can it be  Is it you my dear Cycle my longabsent friend  MR CYCLE  And still heartily yours  MR BERIL  But why would you not send  And of your affection afford me a proof  By bespeaking your quarters here under my roof  However I'm happy that chance is so kind  As to give me th' occasion I've long wish'd to find  To present you to one who of all men on earth  Is most able to judge of your genius and worth  My dear Lord to your notice now let me commend  The man to whose name you're already a friend  Behold Mr Cycle  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Sir let me say  That I often have wish'd for this fortunate day  Which makes me acquainted with one whom I deem  So justly entitled to public esteem  Whose writings and life shew in fairest alliance  Philanthropical virtue and genuine science  MR CYCLE  My good Lord these are honours far more than my due  Yet I own with delight I receive them from you  As you're led to o'errate my poor merits I feel  By this dear partial friend's kind affectionate zeal  LORD SEEWELL  He indeed is your friendI regard his applause  But to wish your acquaintance I've still higher cause  Be assur'd I shall think myself truly your debtor  If you'll give me the pleasure of knowing you better  Either Beril or Careless will guide you to me  I have some things perhaps it may please you to see  Yet no gem I believe that's so worthy your sight  As a statue which Beril has just brought to light  Allow me to shew it you  MR BERIL    to  Lady Frances  Your  tender breast  My dear Lady Frances I fear is opprest▪  By this sculptur'd distress the mere creature of art  Yet too painful a scene for so feeling a heart  LADY FRANCES  No indeed at first sight tho' it made my veins thrill  And I felt thro' my bosom a cold icy chill  That impression once over I view it again  With a soothing delight unembitter'd by pain  LADY HARRIOT    to  Careless  And pray Sir from  which  court of justice come you  CARELESS  From the worshipful court of wise Madam Bijou  Where blind as old Themis she utters decrees  On the price of stuff'd parrots and petrified trees  LADY HARRIOT  O you mischievous creature you certainly mean  By the sound of her name to awaken my spleen  You know that the thought of her sickens me quite  And that I at her house must do penance tonight  CARELESS  Then I vow I'll be there if it's only to see  How Mortification and you may agree  Even that gloomy spright must appear with some grace  If it lurks in the lines of so lively a face  LADY HARRIOT  All my gaiety dies when her presence I come in  No crampfish could give me a shock so benumbing  She's my utter aversion  LORD SEEWELL  Pray tell me my dear  Of whom do you speak in a style so severe  LADY HARRIOT  Of your friend dear Papa your good Mrs Bijou  LORD SEEWELL  That's ungrateful dear Harriotshe's civil to you  And you should not indulge a satyrical vein  LADY HARRIOT  You forget my dear Sir how you often complain  That her low little pride and nonsensical whim  Have reduc'd your old friend to a pitiful trim  And I think she has made him so gloomy a slave  She has pent her good man in Trophonius' cave  Such to him was the temple of Hymen for after  He enter'd its vestibulefarewell to laughter  LORD SEEWELL  Why Harriot you really are quite acrimonious  But if you call wedlock the cave of Trophonius  Have a care if that cavern you chance to step near  You love laughing too well to resign it my dear  LADY HARRIOT  And therefore tho' woo'd like the nymph of Toboso  I never will marry an old virtuoso  Who thinks himself blest with taste science and worth  Because he picks up all the odd things on earth  When a passion for art or for nature is join'd  With a warm friendly heart and a liberal mind  I respect the pure taste which that union produces  Free from vanity's sordid fantastic abuses  Tho' I do not possess it I see and commend  Such taste dear Papa both in you and your friend  But I view with an utter contempt I confess  Those who awkwardly ape what you really possess  And for Mrs Bijou she has just as much soul  As a monkey who carries queer things to its hole  She with wonderful gusto half Gothic half Dutch  Like an old squirrel hides all she can in her hutch  CARELESS  An excellent portrait and true I protest  For I've just had a peep at the old squirrel's nest  LADY HARRIOT  Pray since we together her closet inspected  What whimsical rarities has she collected  CARELESS  O before I could count half the baubles she buys  I could tell you the name of each star in the skies  Her sphere is too wide for my genius to scan it  But I know what she reckons her Georgian planet  Her newlyfound starwhich tonight if you're free  Thro' a glass she perhaps may allow you to see  LADY HARRIOT  What wonder is thisis it flesh fish or fowl  A Lilliput dog or a Brobdignag owl  Or is it a remnant from Joseph's odd coat  CARELESS  It is something once held by a person of note  In our island and now I defy you to guess  LADY HARRIOT  Is it Essex's ring or the ruff of Queen Bess  Or Alfred's caketoaster or Rizzio's fiddle  Pray tell meI hate to be teaz'd by a riddle  CARELESS  In short 'tis a nightcap not worth half a groat  Which she for a guinea has luckily bought  Because this old fragment of worsted she vows  Once serv'd as a crown for poor Chatterton's brows  Tho' I think we should find if we knew the whole truth  That the cap was ne'er seen by that wonderful youth  LADY HARRIOT  Now Chatterton boast that thy illfated verse  Can teach antiquarians to open their purse  Yet hadst thou in misery su'd for that guinea  Its mistress had call'd thee a vain rhyming ninny  And prov'd to thy grief by the style of her giving  Virtuosos have little esteem for the living  LORD SEEWELL  Come Harriot I  must  stop the tide of your wit  Tho' you're now on a topic you don't love to quit    To  Mr Beril  We  must  take our leaveMany thanks for our pleasure  Mr▪ Cycle rememberyour first day of leisure  You sha'n't stir my dear Beril you sha'n't leave your friend  Here is Careless you know on the girls to attend  Let us see you together and shortlyAdieu  LADY HARRIOT    to  Careless  aside    Below let me whisper a few words to you  Mr Beril  and  Mr Cycle  MR BERIL  Well my worthy old friend I rejoice you are here  And that now you are known to that excellent peer  Who free from all pride affectation and vanity  Unites useful virtue to pleasing urbanity  Plain simple sincere yet of judgment refin'd  And fond of the arts as they're friends to mankind  Ennobled much less by his birth than his spirit  The model of Honor and patron of Merit  But how have you done for this age and what plan  For the profit of science or service of man  Brings you now from your fav'rite sequester'd retreat  Whate'er the occasion I'm glad that we meet  Tho' I meant to be with you ere next summer's sun  MR CYCLE  I know my dear Beril that you are not one  Whose welcome will suddenly sink into sorrow  When I tell you I now visit London to borrow  MR BERIL  If I'm able to levy the sum you require  The world can scarce give me a pleasure much higher  Than that of assisting a friend to whose mind  I have infinite debts of a far deeper kind  I can never forget what I owe to your care  In the frenzy of desolate love and despair  When my reason had yielded to passion's wild strife  Your friendship alone reconcil'd me to life  But tell me dear Cycle what sum will suffice  MR CYCLE  You must know I have lately been led to devise  A scheme for the poor  MR BERIL  My dear friend at your leisure  I'll hear your benevolent projects with pleasure  But farther discourse you must let me prevent  On the source of your wants till I know their extent  For indeed I can't rest till I'm happily sure  That whatever you wish I have means to procure  MR CYCLE  Not to keep you in doubt then my dear ardent friend  Two thousand I fancy will answer my end  The one I am promis'd today from Bijou  For the other I own I've depended on you  MR BERIL  And why not allow me to furnish the whole  Poor Bijou has a wife with no liberal soul  If any demur in that quarter you see  I entreat you to take all you wish for of me  But of this more anonhere is Careless return'd  Mr Beril Mr Cycle  and  Careless  CARELESS  Well my worthy philosopher a'n't you concern'd  To find our friend still unsupply'd with a wife  Thus form'd as he is for the conjugal life  As you're fond of new schemes for the good of the nation  I'll recommend one to your consideration  To revive wedded love that old obsolete passion  And bring honest Hymen again into fashion  MR CYCLE  In truth my dear Tom I am quite of your mind  There is no better scheme for the good of mankind  And nothing I know that could give it more weight  Than the grace which our friend would bestow on that state  MR BERIL  You are merry good friendsI subscribe to your joke  My gravity's fit for the conjugal yoke  CARELESS  I am serious indeed and have often declar'd  That had I a sister for wedlock prepar'd  Of all men in the world if you'd deign to embrace her  In your arms it would make me most happy to place her  But you're courted too much to be easily won  He whom many are fond of can fix upon none  MR BERIL  Indeed my dear Tom you are wrong on this theme  In return for a proof of your cordial esteem  I'll tell you the reason with frankness and truth  Why no nymph has supply'd the lost love of my youth  There is one whose mild virtue and elegant grace  The dear girl I deplore in my heart might replace  But my fortune's too humble for her rank of life  Tho' she may be  your sister  she can't be  my wife  CARELESS  Would you wed Lady Frances  MR CYCLE  The lady I've seen  She is like poor Sophia in features and mien  MR BERIL  You are right my dear friendit was that very thought  Led my heart to attach itself more than it ought  But my reason considers her rank and her station  And forbids me to form any rash expectation  Nor would I attempt to engage her affection  Without the least hope of our happy connection  CARELESS  More honor than foresight you shew by this strain  Be boldthere is nothing  you  may not attain  More of this when we meetI must now say adieu  MR CYCLE  So must Ifor you know my appointment at two  MR BERIL  But I hope my good friends you will both dine with me  MR CYCLE  For myself I'll return to you soon after three  CARELESS  I am griev'd to refuse such a frank invitation  But to tell you the truthI've a kind assignation  MR BERIL  Love and pleasure attend you  CARELESS  Dear Beril adieu  Let us all meet tonight at the house of Bijou  Exeunt  The Drawing Room of  Mrs Bijou  MRS BIJOU    speaking as she enters    Look over the staircase and tell me who knocks  JOAN  entering  Mr Varnish is come with a thing in a box  MRS BIJOU  A thing in a boxYou're a horrible Goth  But as you're to leave me I'll stifle my wrath  'Tis a picture you oafbid him bring it to me  Exit  Joan  Some cabinet jewel I now hope to see  This intelligent Varnish my patronage courts  And I get the first peep at whate'er he imports  Mrs Bijou  and  Mr Varnish  MRS BIJOU  Well Varnish  MR VARNISH  Dear Madam with most humble duty  I have brought you a gem of unparagon'd beauty  MRS BIJOU  Good Varnish what is it  MR VARNISH  An exquisite Titian  You never saw one in such brilliant condition  MRS BIJOU  And what is the subject  MR VARNISH  opening the case  Now Ma'am I'll display it  Here's a feast for the eye that knows how to survey it  Here's a JosephI ne'er saw his like in my life  And pray Ma'am observe what a Potiphar's wife  How chaste the design yet the colours how warm  What tints in each face and what life in each form  Pray Madam remark how he struggles to fly  We hear him exclaiming "No Mistress not I"  MRS BIJOU  It seems very fine and has striking expression  Was it ever in any great person's possession  MR VARNISH  Not a soul here has seen it except a poor Peer  For whom it was boughtbut alas 'twas too dear  His steward my friendbut I must not be rash  And betray a good Earl with more gusto than cash  Our Lords are all poor and so ruin'd my trade is  I should starve were it not for you welljudging ladies  There's my old Lady Oglenud had she a peep  Would certainly buy it before she would sleep  But having receiv'd many favours from you  I made it a point you should have the first view  MRS BIJOU  I thank you good VarnishBut what is the price  MR VARNISH  She'd give me a thousand I know in a trice  And buy some companions besides if I had 'em  But I'll leave it with you for eight hundred dear Madam  MRS BIJOU  Eight hundredSure Varnish that sum is too much  MR VARNISH  Dear Madam observe what a delicate touch  See how finely 'tis pencil'd and what preservation  There is not I know such a gem in the nation  And Italy has not a brighter I'm sure  The figures so glowing the story so pure  Good ladies would never have wandering spouses  If they'd only hang subjects like this in their houses  MRS BIJOU  I protest your remark is ingenious and new  You have gusto in Morals as well as Virtu  MR VARNISH  aside  I have hopes that my hint will assist our transaction  For the old dame is jealous they say to distraction  MRS BIJOU  Well I own Mr Varnish your picture is fine  If my husband is rich it shall quickly be mine  Here he comes to decide it  Enter  Mr Bijou  MRS BIJOU  My dear here's a sight  You are luckily come to complete my delight  Mr Varnish has been so exceedingly kind  As he knows on a Titian I've long set my mind  To bring me the finest I ever survey'd  And as we have often befriended his trade  He offers to leave it a bargain with us  MR BIJOU  Its merit or price it is vain to discuss  Tho' the picture possesses so tempting an air  At present my dear I've no money to spare  MRS BIJOU  Mr Varnish pray step in the parlour below  Our final resolve you shall presently know  MR VARNISH  Dear Madam for hours I'll wait on your pleasure  And I beg you will note all its beauties at leisure  Aside as he goes out  Now success to the sexBe this struggle more glorious  May the Joseph be kind and the Lady victorious  MRS BIJOU  My dearest you'll not let the picture depart  When you see it has taken such hold on my heart  I really can't rest till a Titian we've got  That  we  may have something Lord Seewell has  not  And as we expect him you know here tonight  I would shew him this piece with triumphant delight  MR BIJOU  I love to indulge all your wishes my dear  But I'm quite out of cash  MRS BIJOU  Nay Bijou I am clear  You have now all I want in your pocketCome come  I know you went out to receive a large sum  And still have it about youI vow I will look  Here it ishere are notes in this little red book  Takes out his PocketBook  MR BIJOU  Indeed I must beg you that book to release  MRS BIJOU  Here are ten I declare of an hundred apiece  I'll take just enough and restore you the rest  MR BIJOU  I can't suffer this freedom my dear I protest  For the notes are not mine they belong to a friend  MRS BIJOU  To a friendO I guess Sir to whom you would lend  Your slylooking guest Mr Cycle's the man  I know he was here on a borrowing plan  Throw your thousand away on a charity bubble  And leave your poor wife to vexation and trouble  MR BIJOU  Nay my dear be not vex'dyou have misunderstood  The sum will be safe and the interest good  MRS BIJOU  And what is the pitiful profit you'll raise  Compar'd to the transport with which we should gaze  On the picture my fondness would have you possess  For reasons the purest that wife can profess  Unkind as you areI have reasons above  Even profit and pleasurethe reasons of love  'Tis my aim by this modest production of art  To strengthen your virtue and chasten your heart  If you daily survey an example so bright  This model of continence ever in sight  No naughty young women will tempt you to wander  But your truth and your love will grow firmer and fonder  MR BIJOU  What a tender idea how virtuously kind  What affection and taste by each other refin'd  MRS BIJOU  But if for a poor and a foolish projector  You can thwart a fond wife and afflict and neglect her  Go go I shall weep while abroad you may roam  That your charity has no beginning at home  MR BIJOU  It begins and shall end thereI'm melted my dear  You may keep all the notesLet me kiss off that tear  MRS BIJOU  Now again youre my own dear delightful Bijou  And the Titian is mine and my love will be true  Exit in great haste  MR BIJOU    alone    Such virtuous endearments what heart could resist  Yet I fear by poor Cycle this sum will be miss'd  And what shall I say for the failureIn sooth  I think 'twill be fairest to tell him the truth  And sage as he is he perhaps too has felt  That Gold at the breath of a woman will melt  As I live here he is and I look rather small  With a pocket so empty to answer his call  Enter  Mr Cycle  MR BIJOU  Mr Cycle you're come and I'm really confus'd  But I know the mischance will by you be excus'd  In notes I had got you the thousand complete  They were all in this pocket  MR CYCLE  The thieves of the street  Have not pick'd it I hope in the bustle of strife  MR BIJOU  It was pick'd I confess by the hand of my wife  But for reasons so pure in so tender a mode  MR CYCLE  I am happy the sum is so justly bestow'd  MR BIJOU  I know you'll forgive when I come to explain  MR CYCLE  Dear Bijou let me save you at once from that pain  And assure you with truth that I now really come  As ready to quit as to take up the sum  Since Beril's so kind that without my desire  He has offer'd me all that my wants can require  MR BIJOU  I protest I am glad you have found such a friend  But if you hereafter should wish me to lend  I beg you will call without scruple on me  Your worthy friend Beril tonight we shall see  And Seewell in gusto the first of our Earls  Will be here with his daughters two delicate girls  To prove my good friend your forgiveness is hearty  Let me hope you will kindly make one of the party  MR CYCLE  Most chearfully  MR BIJOU  WellI am griev'd I must say  That I cannot detain you to dinner today  But to tell you the truth when for these gala nights  My wife is preparing to shew her fine sights  She spends so much time in adjusting her shelves  That we take a cold snap in the kitchen ourselves  So I'm sure you'll excuse it  MR CYCLE  Your reason is strong  And I'm sorry my friend I've intruded so long  MR BIJOU  We have time enough yetdo not hurry away  MR CYCLE  It really grows late  MR BIJOU  I won't press you to stay  As at night o'er our concert you'll come to preside  I am heartily glad all your wants are supply'd  MR CYCLE  Indeed I believe you my honest Bijou  So till night fare you well  MR BIJOU  My dear Cycle adieu  End of ACT II  ACT THE THIRD SCENE I  Lord Seewell  and  Lady Harriot  LADY HARRIOT  DEAR Papa don't betray meHer delicate mind  Would be wounded I know and would think me unkind  So far from allowing what now I impart  She herself little knows the true state of her heart  LORD SEEWELL  Believe me my dear I with pleasure survey  The sisterly fondness you warmly display  But you who for others so sensibly feel  May here be the dupe of affectionate zeal  And I hope you're mistaken  LADY HARRIOT  My dear Sir observe  You may trace her attachment in every nerve  If I name Mr Beril in some idle tale  Poor Fanny will blush and as often turn pale  In his absence still more and more pensive she grows  Yet thinks not from whence her uneasiness flows  And when he returns tho' her pleasure is meek  Yet the glow of content may be seen on her cheek  And her heart as if fully consol'd by his sight  Appears to repose in a tranquil delight  Dear Papa you'll perceive if you'll open your eyes  That from none but herself she her love can disguise  One other exception perhaps we may find  As I think Mr Beril is equally blind  And robb'd like herself of the talent of seeing  By that diffident love which denies it own being  LORD SEEWELL  I hope this attachment which neither has shewn  Exists my good girl in your fancy alone  LADY HARRIOT  Why so my dear SirShould it prove as you fear  I hope dear Papa that you won't be severe  Consider the delicate frame of my sister  But I know you've a heart that can never resist her  If you once clearly see she has fixt her affection  Tho' she own not her wishes for such a connection  As you know that her nature's so modest and meek  She would die from concealment before she would speak  I have strength to encounter the crosses of life  And to make my part good as a daughter or wife  But our gentle sweet Frances is illform'd to bear  The undeserv'd load of vexation and care  And therefore should wed unregardful of pelf  A husband as tender and mild as herself  LORD SEEWELL  Your reasoning I think is not perfectly just  In the kindness of Beril perhaps I might trust  But the motive you urge for this union my dear  Is what I confess would awaken my fear  As you say your mild sister should never be harrass'd  By those various ills with which life is embarrass'd  I should guard her from all the vexations that wait  On a liberal mind with a narrow estate  And if Beril had thoughts of becoming my son  Had I  not  more objections yet this must be one  LADY HARRIOT  I'll remove it my Lord for indeed this is all  As you think they'll be pinch'd by an income too small  You shall add to their fortune and large it will be  Two thirds of the portion you've destin'd for me  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Harriot I'm charm'd with thy soul I confess  Thou'rt a generous girlto a noble excess  LADY HARRIOT  To that name dear Papa I've no title indeed  As I only give up what I never can need  In your house all my wants will I know be supply'd  And if I should leave it as Careless's bride  The liberal heir of so large an estate  Will not grieve that my fortune has sunk in its weight  Or should my swain frown at the change in my purse  He may e'en take old Themis for better for worse  For tho' I confess he has won my regard  Yet the knot of my love is not twisted so hard  But 'twill slip in a moment if ever I see  That he's rather more fond of my purse than of me  LORD SEEWELL  'Tis a pity the friendly illusions of youth  Cannot instantly turn into substance and truth  Your affectionate fancy my dear is delighted  With the dream of beholding two persons united  Whom you fondly suppose only form'd for each other  LADY HARRIOT  I should like Mr Beril I own for my brother  Because I'm convinc'd that no mortal on earth  In manners in temper in taste and in worth  Is form'd so exactly to suit such a wife  On their lasting attachment I'd venture my life  LORD SEEWELL  Your warm heart my good girl your young judgment deceives  And what the first wishes the second believes  Dear Harriot to  this  fancied match there may be  Many bars which your eyes are unable to see  A mistress conceal'd with a young little fry  LADY HARRIOT  Should an angel declare it the fact I'd deny  For had Beril been loaded with such a connection  In his eyes I had never perceiv'd his affection  But I'll presently solve any doubts of this kind  As I'm soon to be told the true state of his mind  For Careless has promis'd  LORD SEEWELL  O fie my dear fie  Your intemperate zeal has now risen too high  I am really concern'd at your great indiscretion  LADY HARRIOT  Nay but hear me my LordI have dropt no expression  No not one single hint that could truly discover  Why in such a research I commission'd my lover  Don't think dear Papa I'd my sister betray  Enter a  Servant  SERVANT  Mr Beril my Lord sent this letter  LORD SEEWELL  Stay stay  Does any one wait for an answer below  SERVANT  No my Lord the man's gone  LORD SEEWELL  Very well you may go  Exit  Servant  LADY HARRIOT  Should this be an offer'twould give me great pleasure  But I fear he's too modest to take such a measure  Dear Papa does he venture on any advances  LORD SEEWELL  There my dearyou'll not find any mention of Frances  And I think by the note which to you I resign  Your conjectures are not so well founded as mine  LADY HARRIOT    perusing the Letter    "Occasion for money""The statue to you"  I'm amaz'dand can hardly believe it is true  He never would part with so dear a possession  But for some urgent reason  LORD SEEWELL  You see his confessio  His strong call for money is frankly declar'd  And I fear his small fortune is greatly impair'd  LADY HARRIOT  These tidings indeed give me real concern  But the source of this step I will speedily learn  Careless soon will be hereI will make him discover  And till we know all give no peace to my lover  But now my dear Lord by this note you may find  How the heart of my sister is really inclin'd  I'm convinc'd this will prove her affection is strong  Here she comes for the trialpray see if I'm wrong  LORD SEEWELL  Well my dear I will try by an innocent plot  If your sister has really this passion or not  Enter  Lady Frances  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Fanny you're come our concern to partake  For we both are much griev'd for our friend Beril's sake  LADY FRANCES  Mr Beril dear SirIs he hurtIs he kill'd  LORD SEEWELL  Nowith terrors too lively your bosom is fill'd  My dear how you trembleBut I was to blame  To raise this alarm in your delicate frame  He is well but some crosses of fortune I fear  Make him fell what he justly consider'd so dear  You will see by this letter    Aside to  Lady Harriot  Ah Harriot 'tis so  The excess of her fear from affection must flow  LADY FRANCES  How painful to him must the exigence be  Which extorts from his hand the agreement I see  How cruel for him to relinquish a treasure  Whence his elegant spirit deriv'd so much pleasure  But I trust dear Papa that your generous mind  Will not now press the bargain he once has declin'd  And scorning to profit by any distress  Will not catch at the gem he still ought to possess  LORD SEEWELL  My dear can I now what I offer'd withhold  And should I the statue no less would be sold  LADY FRANCES  Perhaps if you chose half its value to lend  From so galling a sale you might rescue your friend  LORD SEEWELL  I am pleas'd my dear girl with your spirit I own  But these are bad times for a dangerous loan  And to tell you the truth in this knotty affair  I have just at this crisis no money to spare  But I'll frankly explain our finances to you  And you shall instruct me in what I shall do  As I've seen that old fathers tho' reckon'd most sage  Often injure a child by the frolicks of age  That you may not suffer from follies like these  I have just now consign'd to the care of trustees  All I've sav'd for you bothso if I prove unsteady  You are safeWhen you wed both your fortunes are ready  LADY FRANCES  Let the fortune of Harriot be sacred I pray  For not very distant is her weddingday  But as  I  am convinc'd I shall not wed at all  Let my portion Papa answer every call  I must beg you to look on it still as your own  And if it may serve for so timely a loan  It can't give me more joy whatsoever my station  Than by saving your friend from such mortification  LORD SEEWELL  My dear girls you are both the delight of my life  May each warmhearted daughter be blest as a wife  What I said was but meant your kind spirit to try  For the wants of our friend I can amply supply  Of esteem it will please me to give him a proof  And preserve the fine statue still under his roof  Enter a  Servant  SERVANT  Mr Careless my Lord  LADY HARRIOT  Now the whole I shall know  Going  LORD SEEWELL  Stay  SERVANT  He wishes to see Lady Harriot below  LORD SEEWELL  Being equally anxious this point to discover  We will all my dear Harriot attend on your lover  Exeunt  SCENE  the Apartments of  Mrs Bijou  MR BIJOU  Where the deuce is my wifeAll her rarities plac'd  Her apartments adjusted with exquisite taste  Some disaster has happen'd or she would be here  Where she ought to be waiting to welcome the Peer  And I fancy I heard her in anger below  Enter  Mrs Bijou  in great Agitation  MR BIJOU  What's the matter my love  MRS BIJOU  O my dear such a blow  I really had swoon'd if vexation and wrath  Had not quicken'd my spirits to scold at the Goth  That awkward old Joanan unmannerly minx  Has knock'd off the nipple my dear from a Sphinx  And now on our chimney it cannot be plac'd  With a wound so indelicate maim'd and disgrac'd  But I've happily got these two Griffins of gold  In the room of the Sphinxes our candles to hold  MR BIJOU  My dear the exchange is most lucky and right  For a Sphinx is an awkward dispenser of light  But whether your Griffin's of gold or of copper  A flame from his mouth is exceedingly proper  MRS BIJOU  By your lessons my love I improve in Virtù  All the gusto I have I have gather'd from you  I have fixt the Great Mummy my dear to the wall  Lest the pert Lady Harriot should give him a fall  She'd be glad to throw down my old king out of spite  And I would not be vext in our triumph tonight  I know our new picture will stir up her gall  And this Titian will make us the envy of all  My dear don't you think it looks well by this light  MR BIJOU  The colours indeed are uncommonly bright  MRS BIJOU  What a beautiful youth is this JosephI swear  I am more and more charm'd with his delicate air  I delight in him more since I've found dear Bijou  That in one of his features he's very like you  MR BIJOU  Where can you my dear any likeness suppose  MRS BIJOU  I protest he has got the true turn of your nose  Not the aquiline curve but a little Socratic  And his eye flashes fire that is chastly ecstatic  There's a rap at our door and I hope my Lord's come  If vexation and envy do not strike him dumb  I think he'll harangue like a critic of Greece  On the exquisite charms of this beautiful piece  I long to behold how he's touch'd by the sight  But I know that his envy will sink his delight  The moment he sees it he'll think his luck cruel  In missing so precious a cabinet jewel  Enter  Mr Beril  and  Mr Cycle  MR BIJOU  Dear Cycle I take this exceedingly kind  And I hope you've not left your Cremona behind  In your presence tonight I most truly rejoice  And shall call for the aid of your hand and your voice  As my wife gives a snug little concert below  When you've seen what her upper apartments can shew  MR CYCLE  You may freely command me my friend as you please  MRS BIJOU  You're a judge Mr Beril of treasures like these  And I'm eager to shew you a Titian that's new  Since we last had the joy of a visit from you  MR BERIL  The story is told Ma'am with striking expression  MRS BIJOU  Don't you envy my husband this brilliant possession  I thought you'd burst forth into rapturous praise  But with no keen delight on this picture you gaze  MR BERIL  To confess Ma'am the truth I'm a whimsical being  And a subject like this I've no pleasure in seeing  On  your  lovely sex 'tis a satire most bitter  That illnature may laugh at and levity titter  But I'm griev'd when an artist has lavish'd his care  On a story that seems a disgrace to the Fair  MRS BIJOU  Our sex's chief lustre I own it obscures  But think what a lesson it offers to yours  Enter  Lady Harriot Lady Frances Lord Seewell  and  Mr Careless  MR BIJOU  My dear Lord I this instant was wishing for you  Your voice is decisive in points of Virtù  And you're come in the moment to end an odd strife  In a matter of taste about Potiphar's wife  Should her story be paintedWe want your decision  And here is the picture that caus'd our division  LORD SEEWELL  Ha my poor old acquaintanceBut how dear Bijou  How the deuce could this picture find favor with you  I hope that rogue Varnish has play'd you no trick  You have paid no great price  MRS BIJOU  I am cut to the quick  Sure my Lord you ne'er look'd on this picture before  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Madam 'tis one that I turn'd out of door  And as I may aid you to 'scape from a fraud  I'll proceed to inform you I bought it abroad  To relieve the distress of an indigent youth  Who copied old Masters with spirit and truth  And when it came home as I valu'd it not  My steward by chance this gay furniture got  To a new house of his it has lately been carried  And as your friend Varnish his daughter has married  I suppose the sly rogue by this picture has try'd  To increase the small fortune he gain'd with his bride  Search the garment of Joseph you'll find on its hem  And within a dark fold the two letters T M  MRS BIJOU  Aye there is the mark we are cheated we're plunder'd  That infamous villain to ask me eight hundred  But the law shall restore it  MR BIJOU  See Mrs Bijou  See the fruits of my hasty indulgence to you  LORD SEEWELL  Chear up my old friend'Tis my wish that this night  May be witness to nothing but peace and delight  I'll engage to make Varnish your money restore  And perhaps this adventure may save you much more  All we old connoisseurs if the truth we would own  Have at times been outwitted with canvas or stone  But here's one whose example our tribe now invites  To correct our mistakes and improve our delights  Here's Beril tho' blest with a treasure most rare  That with few works of art will admit of compare  Gives up the proud joys that on such wealth attend  For the nobler delight of assisting a friend  MR BERIL  My Lord you amaze me how could you divine  O Careless your zeal has betray'd my design  LORD SEEWELL  You have fixt on the traitor yet are not aware  That you're almost involv'd in a dangerous snare  But I'll shew you this traitor's accomplice my friend  And tell you what mischief these plotters intend  You must know Tom and Harriot in concert pursue  Their dark machinations 'gainst Frances and you  They have sworn you've a tender esteem for each other  Which you both have in modesty labour'd to smother  If their charge can be prov'd I your freedom restrain  And sentence you both to the conjugal chain  MR BERIL  O my Lord that I love Lady Frances is true  Yet I could not avow it to her or to you  But to force my confession such means you employ  I almost may call them the torture of joy  I'm o'erwhelm'd with surprize with delight and with dread  Lest I falsely have heard the kind things you have said  Speak my dear Lady Frances my anguish relieve  Does this tumult of hope my wild fancy deceive  LADY FRANCES  I so long have my father's indulgence confest  That against his decrees I shall never protest  MR BERIL  O how shall I thank thee dear pride of my life  LORD SEEWELL  By cherishing still in the mind of your wife  Such generous feelings as  you  have display'd  From my hand my dear Beril receive the kind maid  Your statue is not more indebted to art  Than she is to nature for moulding her heart  They both shall be yours both the statue and bride  And the wants of your friend shall no less be supply'd  Being free from one modish and wealthwasting vice  From those pests of our order the turf and the dice  I enjoy my dear children the fortunate power  Of securing your bliss by an affluent dower  Your quiet shall ne'er by your income be hurt  Which shall equal your wish tho' below your desert  MR BERIL  Of your kindness my Lord I so feel the excess  That my voice cannot speak what my heart would express  MR BIJOU  I am charm'd my dear Lord by your choice of a son  LORD SEEWELL  I know my old friend you'll approve what I've done  You and I dear Bijou wanting proper correction  Have on vanity lavished the dues of affection  We have both squander'd cash on too many a whim  But in taste let us take a new lesson from him  And rate our improvements in real Virtù  By the generous acts he may teach us to do  To remember this truth is the connoisseur's duty  "A benevolent deed is the essence of beauty"  MR BIJOU  I confess I too oft have been vanity's fool  But shall hope to grow wise my good Lord in your school  And as mirth should be coupled with wisdom I'll go  And see if the fiddles are ready below  Exit  LORD SEEWELL  Tonight my dear Madam you must not look grave  Tho' Varnish has prov'd such an impudent knave  I promise to make him your money refund  MRS BIJOU  With surprize and vexation I almost was stunn'd  But depending my Lord on your friendly assistance  I am ready to drive all chagrin to a distance  And to share in the joy of our dear happy guests  MR BERIL  What I owe to you Careless this fair one attests  And our sister I hope if I dare use the name  From your friendship will judge of your love's ardent flame  And short'ning your rigorous term of probation  Now fill your kind heart with complete exultation  LADY HARRIOT  The warm blaze of our joy I assure you dear brother  With the cold damp of prudery I will not smother  Your friend has for you play'd so feeling a part  I confess I am charm'd with his spirit and heart  As in law and long courtship he likes not to drudge  I will make him at once my comptroller and judge  CARELESS  I with transport and pride the dear office embrace  LORD SEEWELL  And long may you fill it with spirit and grace  My voice my dear Careless confirms her election  And I give her with joy to your tender direction  For sealing dear Tom you may fix your own day  Without dreading from law any irksome delay  As your father and I have with friendly advances  Already adjusted your nuptial finances  MR BIJOU  entering  Our musicians below are all ready my Lord  Of pleasure you teach us to touch the true chord  I've selected a few little pieces tonight  That are suited I hope to the present delight  May we all think this day the best day of our life  It will prove so I'm sure both to me and my wife  If a bargain should tempt us we will not be rash  But remember the Titian and pocket our cash  To Friendship and Want all we can we will give  And buy no more baubles as long as we live
