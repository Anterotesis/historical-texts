 THE FATAL FALSEHOOD A TRAGEDY AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN BY THE AUTHOR OF PERCY  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND M DCC LXXIX  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  TO COUNTESS BATHURST THIS TRAGEDY IS VERY RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED AS A SMALL TRIBUTE TO HER MANY VIRTUES AND AS A GRATEFUL TESTIMONY OF THE FRIENDSHIP WITH WHICH SHE HONOURS  HER MOST OBEDIENT AND MOST OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT H MORE  PROLOGUE  Written by the AUTHOR  and spoken by Mr HULL  OUR modern Poets scarce know how to chuse  A subject worthy of the Tragic Muse  For Bards so well have glean'd th' Historic field  That scarce one sheaf th' exhausted ancients yield  And these our timid author leaves to men  For classic themes demand a classic pen  Yet still the wilds of fiction open lie  A flow'ry prospect and a boundless sky  But hard the task the sober path to chuse  And wand'ring Fancy's treacherous baits refuse  She dares not touch the Drama's  nobler  strings  The fate of nations and the fall of Kings  The humbler scenes of private life she shews  A simple story of domestic woes  The weight of crowns a kingdom's weal or woe  How few can judge because how few can know  But here you all may boast the Critic's art  Here all are judgeswho possess a heart  To govern  Empires  is the lot of few  But all who live have  passions  to subdue  And ev'n by Patriots let it be confess'd  These  Rebel Subjects ought to be suppress'd  These Ravagers which spoil the human breast  Oh deign to learn this obvious lesson here  The verse is feeble but the moral clear  Your candour once endur'd our Author's lays  Endure them nowthat will be ample praise  EPILOGUE  Written by R B SHERIDAN  Esq  and spoken by Mr LEE LEWES  UNHAND me gentlemen by Heaven I say  I'll make a ghost of him who bars my way  Behind the scenes  Forth let me comeA Poetaster true  As lean as Envy and as baneful too  On the dull audience let me vent my rage  Or drive these  female  scribblers from the stage  For scene or history we've none but these  The law of Liberty and Wit they seize  In TragicComicPastoralthey dare to please  Each puny Bard must surely burst with spite  To find that women with such fame can write  But oh your partial favour is the cause  Who feed their follies with such full applause  Yet still our tribe shall seek to blast their fame  And ridicule each fair pretender's aim  Where the dull duties of domestic life  Wage with the Muse's toils eternal strife  What motley cares  Corilla's  mind perplex  While maids and metaphors conspire to vex  In studious deshabille behold her sit  A letter'd gossip and a housewife wit  At once invoking though for different views  Her gods her cook her millener and muse  Round her strew'd room a frippery chaos lies  A chequer'd wreck of  notable  and  wise  Bills Books Caps Couplets Combs a vary'd mass  Oppress the toilet and obscure the glass  Unfinish'd here an Epigram is laid  And there a mantuamaker's Bill unpaid  Here newborn Plays fore taste the town's applause  There dormant Patterns pine for future gauze  A moral Essay now is all her care  A Satire next and then a Bill of Fare  A Scene she now projects and now a Dish  Here's Act the Firstand hereremove with Fish  Now while this Eye in a fine phrenzy rolls  That soberly casts up a Bill for Coals  Black Pins and Daggers in one leaf she sticks  And Tears and Thread and Balls and Thimbles mix  Sappho  'tis true long vers'd in epic song  For years esteem'd all household studies wrong  When dire mishep though neither shame nor sin  Sappho  herself and not her Muse lies in  The virgin Nine in terror fly the bower  And matron Juno claims despotic power  Soon Gothic hags the classic pile o'erturn  A caudlecup supplants the sacred urn  Nor books nor implements escape their rage  They spike the inkstand and they rend the page  Poems and Plays one barbarous fate partake  Ovid and Plautus suffer at the stake  And Aristotle's only sav'dto wrap plumb cake  Yet shall a  woman  tempt the Tragic Scene  And darebut holdI must repress my spleen  I see your hearts are pledg'd to her applause  White Shakespear's spirit seems to aid her cause  Well pleas'd to aidsince o'er his sacred bier  A semale hand did ample trophies rear  And gave the greenest laurel that is worshipp'd there  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Earl Guildford  Mr Clarke  Rivers his son  Mr Lewis  Orlando a young Italian Count Mr Wroughton  Bertrand  Mr Aickin  WOMEN  Emmelina  Miss Young  Julia  Mrs Hartley  SCENE Earl Guildford's Castle  THE FATAL FALSEHOOD A TRAGEDY  ACT THE FIRST  SCENE an Apartment in Guildford Castle  Enter BERTRAND  WHAT fools are serious melancholy villains  I play a surer game and screen my heart  With easy looks and undesigning smiles  And while my actions spring from sober thought  They still appear th' effect of wild caprice  And I the thoughtless slave of giddy chance  What but this frankness has engag'd the promise  Of young Orlando to confide to me  That secret grief which preys upon his heart  'Tis dangerous indiscreet hypocrisy  To seem too good I am the careless Bertrand  The honest undesigning plain blunt man  The follies I avow cloke those I hide  For who will search where nothing seems conceal'd  'Tis rogues of solid prudent grave demeanor  Excite suspicion men on whose dark brow  Discretion with his iron hand has grav'd  The deepmark'd characters of thoughtfulness  Here comes my uncle venerable Guildford  Whom I cou'd honour were he not the father  Of that aspiring boy who fills the gap  'Twixt me and fortuneRivers how I hate thee  Enter  GUILDFORD  How fares my noble uncle  GUILDFORD  Honest Bertrand  I must complain we have so seldom met  Where do you keep believe me we have miss'd you  BERTRAND  O my good Lord your pardonspare me Sir  For there are follies in a young man's life  And idle thoughtless hours which I should blush  To lay before your wife and temperate age  GUILDFORD  Well be it soyouth has a privilege  And I should be asham'd could I forget  I have myself been young and harshly chide  The not ungraceful levity of youth  Prudence becomes moroseness when it makes  A rigid inquisition of the fault  Not of the man perhaps but of his youth  Foibles that shame the head on which old Time  Has shower'd his snow are then most pardonable  And age has many a weakness of its own  BERTRAND  Your gentleness my Lord and mild reproof  Correct the wandrings of misguided youth  More than rebuke and shame it into virtue  GUILDFORD  Saw you my beauteous ward the Lady Julia  BERTRAND  She past this way and with her your fair daughter  Your Emmelina  GUILDFORD  Call them both my daughters  For scarce is Emmelina dearer to me  Than Julia the lov'd child of my adoption  The hour approaches too and bless it heaven  With thy benignest kindliest influence  When Julia shall indeed become my daughter  Shall in obedience to her father's will  Crown the impatient vows of my brave son  And richly pay him for his dangers past  BERTRAND  Oft have I wonder'd how the gallant Rivers  Youthful and ardent doating to excess  Cou'd dare the dangers of uncertain war  E'er marriage had confirm'd his claim to Julia  GUILDFORD  'Twas the condition of her father's will  My brave old fellowsoldier and my friend  He wish'd to see our ancient houses join'd  By this our children's union but the veteran  So highly valued military prowess  That he bequeath'd his fortunes and his daughter  To my young Rivers on these terms alone  That he shou'd early seek renown in arms  And if he from the field return'd a conqueror  That sun which saw him come victorious home  Shou'd witness their espousals Yet he comes not  The event of war is to the brave uncertain  Nor can desert in arms ensure success  BERTRAND  Yet fame speaks loudly of his early valour  GUILDFORD  E'er since th' Italian Count the young Orlando  My Rivers' bosom friend has been my guest  The glory of my son is all his theme  Oh he recounts his virtues with such joy  Dwells on his merit with a zeal so warm  As to his gen'rous heart pays back again  The praises he bestows  BERTRAND  Orlando's noble  He's of a tender brave and gallant nature  Of honour most romantic with such graces  As charm all womankind  GUILDFORD  And here comes one  To whom the story of Orlando's praise  Sounds like sweet music  BERTRAND  What yourcharming daughter  Yes I suspect she loves th' Italian Count  Aside  That must not be Now to observe her closely  Enter  EMMELINA  GUILDFORD  Come hither Emmelina we were speaking  Of the young Count Orlando What think you  Of this accomplish'd stranger  EMMELINA  Confused  Sir your pardon  But as my father's guest my brother's friend  I do esteem the Count  GUILDFORD  Nay he has merit  Might justify thy friendship if he wanted  The claims thou mention'st yet I mean to blame him  EMMELINA  What has he done that cou'd offend my father  For you are just and are not angry lightly  And he is mild unapt to give offence  As you to be offended  GUILDFORD  Nay 'tis not much  Why does Orlando shun of late my presence  Why lose that chearful and becoming spirit  Which lately charm'd us all Rivers will chide us  Shou'd he return and find his friend unhappy  He is not what he was What says my child  EMMELINA  My Lord when first my brother's friend arriv'd  Be still my heart  Aside  BERTRAND  She dares not use his name  Her brother's friend  Aside  EMMELINA  When first your noble guest  Came from that voyage he kindly undertook  To ease our terrors for my Rivers' safety  When we believ'd him dead he seem'd most happy  And shar'd the universal joy he gave  Of late he is less gay my brother's absence  Or I mistake disturbs his friend's repose  Nor is it strange one mind informs them both  Each is the very soul that warms the other  And both are wretched or are bless'd together  BERTRAND  Why trembles my fair cousin  EMMELINA  Can I think  That my lov'd brother's life has been in danger  Nor feel a strong emotion  BERTRAND  Ironically  Generous pity  But when that danger has so long been past  You shou'd forget your terrors  EMMELINA  I shall never  For when I think that danger sprung from friendship  That Rivers to preserve another's life  Incurr'd this peril still my wonder rises  BERTRAND  And why another's life Why not Orlando's  Such caution more betrays than honest freedom  GUILDFORD  He's still the same the gibing thoughtless Bertrand  Severe of speech but ignorant of malice  Exit  Guildford Emmelina  going  BERTRAND  Stay my fair cousin still with adverse eyes  You view me Say had I Orlando's form  I mean were I like him your brother's friend  Then wou'd your looks be turn'd thus coldly on me  EMMELINA  But that I know your levity means nothing  And that your heart accords not with your tongue  This wou'd offend me  BERTRAND  Come confess the truth  That this gay Florentine this Tuscan rover  Has won your easy heart and given you his  I know the whole I'm of his secret council  He has confess'd  EMMELINA  Ha what has he confess'd  BERTRAND  That you are wondrous fair nay nothing farther  How disappointment fires her angry cheek  Yourself have told the rest your looks avow it  Your eyes are honest nor conceal the secret  EMMELINA  Conceal Virtue has nothing to conceal  So far from dreading it solicits notice  And wishes every secret thought it harbours  Bare to the eye of men as 'tis to heav'n  BERTRAND  Yet mark me well trust not Orlando's truth  The citron groves have heard his amorous vows  Breath'd out to many a beauteous maid of Florence  Bred in those soster climes his roving heart  Ne'er learn'd to think fidelity a virtue  But laughs at tales of British constancy  But see Orlando comesperhaps to seek you  With eyes bent downwards and with folded arms  Disorder'd looks and negligent attire  And all the careless equipage of love  He bends this way Why does the mounting blood  Thus crimson your fair cheek He does not see us  I'll venture to disturb his meditations  And instantly return  Exit  Bertrand  EMMELINA  No more but leave me  He's talkative but harmless rude but honest  Fuller of mirth than mischief See they meet  This way they come why am I thus alarm'd  Oh for a little portion of that art  Ungenerous men ascribe to our whole sex  A little artifice were prudence now  But I have none my poor unpractis'd heart  Is so unknowing of dissimulation  So little skill'd to seem the thing it is not  That if my lips are still my looks betray me  Enter  ORLANDO  and  BERTRAND  BERTRAND  Now to alarm her heart and search out his  Aside  ORLANDO  We crave your pardon beauteous Emmelina  If rudely we intrude upon your thoughts  Thoughts pure as infants' dreams or angels' wishes  And gentle as the breast from whence they spring  EMMELINA  Be still my heart nor let him see thy weakness  Aside  We are much bound to thank you cousin Bertrand  That since your late return the Count Orlando  Appears once more among usSay my Lord  Why have you shunn'd your friends' society  Was it well done My father bade me chide you  I am not made for chiding but he bade me  He says no more you rise at early dawn  With him to chase the boar I pleaded for you  Told him 'twas savage sport  ORLANDO  What was his answer  EMMELINA  He said 'twas sport for heroes and made heroes  That hunting was the very school of war  Taught our brave youth to shine in nobler fields  Preserv'd 'em from the rust of dull inaction  Train'd 'em for arms and fitted them for conquest  ORLANDO  O my fair advocate scarce can I grieve  To have done wrong since my offence has gain'd  So sweet a pleader  BERTRAND  Aside  So I like this well  Full of respect but cold  EMMELINA  My lord your pardon  My father waits my coming I attend him  Exit  BERTRAND  In truth my Lord you're a right happy man  Her parting look proclaims that you are blest  The crimson blushes on her cheek display'd  A gentle strife 'twixt modesty and love  Discretion strove to dash the rising joy  But conquering love prevail'd and told the tale  My Lord you answer not  ORLANDO  What shall I say  Oh could'st thou read my heart  BERTRAND  The hour is come  When my impatient friendship claims that trust  Which I so oft have press'd and you have promis'd  ORLANDO  I cannot tell thee 'tis a tale of guilt  How shall I speak my resolution sickens  All virtuous men will shun me thou wiltscorn me  And fly the foul contagion of my crime  BERTRAND  My bosom is not steel'd with that harsh prudence  Which wou'd reproach thy failings tell me all  The proudest heart loves to repose its faults  Upon a breast that has itself a tincture  Of human weakness I have frailties too  Frailties that teach me how to pity thine  What silent still Thou lov'st my beauteous cousin  Have I not guess'd  ORLANDO  I own that she has charms  Might warm a frozen stoic into love  Tempt hermits back again to that bad world  They had renounc'd and make religious men  Forgetful of their holy vows to heaven  Yet Bertrandcome I'll tell thee all my weakness  Thou hast a tender sympathising heart  And art not rigid to a friend's defects  That heav'nly form I view with eyes as cold  As marble images of lifeless saints  I see and know the workmanship divine  My judgment owns her exquisite perfections  But my rebellious heart denies her claim  BERTRAND  What do I hear you love her not  ORLANDO  Oh Bertrand  For pity do not hate me but thou must  For am I not at variance with myself  Yet shall I wrong her gentle trusting nature  And spurn the heart I labour'd to obtain  She loves me Bertrand Oh too fure she loves me  Loves me with tenderest truest chastest passion  Loves me oh my curs'd fate as I love Julia  BERTRAND  Heard I aright Did you not speak of Julia  Julia the lovely ward of my good uncle  Julia the mistress of your friend of Rivers  ORLANDO  Go on go on and urge me with my guilt  Display my crime in all its native horrors  Tell me some legend of infernal falschood  Tell me some dreadful tale of perjur'd friendship  Of trust betray'd and innocence deceiv'd  Place the black chronicle before my eyes  With added guilt and aggravated horror  That I may see the evils which await me  Nor pull such fatal mischiefs on my head  As with my ruin must involve the fate  Of all I love on earth  BERTRAND  Just as I wish  Aside  ORLANDO  Thou know'st I left my native Italy  Directed hither by the noble Rivers  To ease his father's fears who thought he fell  In that engagement where we both were wounded  His was a glorious wound gained in the cause  Of gen'rous friendship for an hostile spear  Aim'd at my breast Rivers in his receiv'd  Sav'd my devoted life and won my soul  BERTRAND  So far I knew but what of Emmelina  ORLANDO  Whether her gentle beauties first allur'd me  Or whether peaceful scenes and rural shades  Or leisure or the want of other objects  Or solitude apt to engender love  Engag'd my soul I know not but I lov'd her  We were together always till the habit  Grew into something like necessity  When Emmelina left me I was sad  Nor knew a joy till Emmelina came  Her soft society amus'd my mind  Fill'd up my vacant heart and touch'd my soul  'Twas gratitude 'twas friendship 'twas esteem  'Twas reason 'twas persuasion nay 'twas love  BERTRAND  But where was Julia  ORLANDO  Oh too soon she came  For when I saw that wond'rous form of beauty  I stood entranc'd like some astronomer  Who as he views the bright expanse of heaven  Finds a new star I gaz'd and was undone  Gaz'd and forgot the tender Emmelina  Gaz'd and forgot the gen'rous trusting Rivers  Forgot my faith my friendship and my honour  BERTRAND  Does Julia know your love  ORLANDO  Forbid it heav'n  What think'st thou I am so far gone in guilt  As boldly to avow it Bertrand no  For all the kingdoms of the spacious earth  I wou'd not wrong my friend or damn my honour  BERTRAND  Trust me you judge too hardly of yourself  ORLANDO  Think I have lodg'd a secret in thy breast  On which my peace my fame my all depends  Long have I struggled with the fatal truth  And scarce have dar'd to breathe it to myself  For oh too surely the first downward step  The treacherous path that leads to guilty deeds  Is to make vice familiar to the mind  Exit  BERTRAND  Am I awake No 'tis delusion all  My wildest wishes never soar'd to this  Fortune anticipates my plot he loves her  Not Emmelina but the Lady Julia  Orlando yes I'll play thee at my will  Poor puppet thou hast trusted to my hand  The strings by which I'll move thee to thy ruin  And make thee too the instrument of vengeance  Of glorious vengeance on the man I hate  Exit  End of the First Act  ACT THE SECOND  Enter  JULIA  and  EMMELINA  JULIA  HOW many cares perplex the maid who loves  Cares which the vacant heart can never know  You fondly tremble for a brother's life  Orlando mourns the absence of a friend  Guildford is anxious for a son's renown  In my poor heart your various terrors meet  With added fears and fonder apprehensions  They all unite in me I feel for all  His life his fame his absence and his love  For he may live to bless a sister's hopes  May live to gratify impatient friendship  May live to crown a father's house with honour  May live to glory and be dead to love  EMMELINA  Forbear these fears they wound my brother's honour  Julia a brave man must be ever faithful  Cowards alone dare venture to be false  Cowards alone dare injure trusting innocence  And with bold perjuries affront high heaven  JULIA  I know his faith and venerate his virtues  I know his heart is tender as 'tis brave  That all his father's worth his sister's softness  Meet in his generous breastand yet I fear  Whoever lov'd like me and did not fear  Enter  GUILDFORD  GUILDFORD  Where are my Friends my daughter where is Julia  How shall I speak the fulness of my heart  My son my Rivers will this day return  EMMELINA  My dearest brother  JULIA  Ha my Rivers comes  Propitious heaven  EMMELINA  And yet my Julia trembles  JULIA  Have I not cause my Rivers comes but how  I dread to ask and yet I die to hear  My Lordyou know the terms  GUILDFORD  He comes a conqueror  He comes as Guildford's son shou'd ever come  The battle's o'er the English arms successful  And Rivers like an English warrior hastens  To lay his laurels at the feet of beauty  Exit  JULIA  My joy oppresses me  EMMELINA  And see Orlando  How will the welcome news transport his soul  And raise his drooping heart with caution tell him  Lest the o'erwhelming rapture be too much  For his dejected mind  Enter  ORLANDO  and  BERTRAND  JULIA  My Lord Orlando  Wherefore that troubled air no more you dwell  On your once darling theme you speak no more  The praises of your Rivers is he chang'd  Is he not still the gallant friend you lov'd  As virtuous and as valiant  ORLANDO  Still the same  He must be ever virtuous ever valiant  EMMELINA  If Rivers is the same then must I think  Orlando greatly chang'd you speak not of him  Nor long for his return as you were wont  How did you use to spend the livelong day  In telling some new wonders of your friend  Till night broke in upon th' unfinish'd tale  And when 'twas o'er you wou'd begin again  And we again wou'd listen with delight  With fresh delight as if we had not heard it  Does Rivers less deserve or you less love  ORLANDO  Have I not lov'd him was my friendship cold  When any prais'd his glories in the field  My raptur'd heart has bounded at the tale  Methought I grew illustrious from his glory  And rich from his renown to hear him prais'd  More proud than if I had atchiev'd his deeds  And reap'd the fullblown harvest of his fame  How have I trembled for a life so dear  When his too ardent soul despising caution  Has plung'd him in the foremost ranks of war  As if in love with danger  JULIA  Valiant Rivers  How does thy greatness justify my love  BERTRAND  He's distant far so I may sasely praise him  Aside  I claim some merit in my love of Rivers  Since I admire the virtues that eclipse me  With pleasure I survey those dazzling heights  My gay inactive temper cannot reach  EMMELINA  Spoke like my honest cousin Then Orlando  Since such the love you bear your noble friend  How will your heart sustain the mighty joy  The news I tell will give you Yes Orlando  Restrain the transports of your grateful friendship  And hear with moderation hear me tell you  That Rivers will return  ORLANDO  How when  EMMELINA  This day  ORLANDO  Impossible  BERTRAND  Then all my schemes are air  Aside  EMMELINA  Today I shall embrace my valiant brother  JULIA  You droop my Lord did you not hear her right  She told you that your Rivers wou'd return  To bless your friendship and to crown our hopes  ORLANDO  He is most welcome Is he not my friend  You say my Rivers comesThy arm good Bertrand  BERTRAND  Joy to us all joy to the Count Orlando  Weak man take care  Aside to  Orlando  EMMELINA  My Lord you are not well  BERTRAND  Surprise and joy oppress him I myself  Partake his transports Rouse my Lord for shame  EMMELINA  How is it with you now  ORLANDO  Quite well'tis past  BERTRAND  The wonder's past and nought but joy remains  Enter  GUILDFORD  and  RIVERS  GUILDFORD  He's come he's here I have embrac'd my warrior  Now take me heav'n I have liv'd long enough  JULIA  My Lord my Rivers  RIVERS  'Tis my Julia's self  My life  JULIA  My hero Do I then behold thee  RIVERS  Oh my full heart expect not words my Julia  EMMELINA  Rivers  RIVERS  My sister what an hour is this  My own Orlando too  ORLANDO  My noble friend  RIVERS  This is such prodigality of bliss  I scarce can think it real Honest Bertrand  Your hand your's my Orlando your's my father  And as a hand I have a heart for all  Love has enlarg'd it from excess of love  I am become more capable of friendship  My dearest Julia  GUILDFORD  She is thine my son  Thou hast deserv'd her nobly thou hast won her  Fulfill'd the terms  RIVERS  Therefore I dare not ask her  I wou'd not claim my Julia as a debt  But take her as a gift and oh I swear  The dearest richest choicest noblest gift  The bounty of indulgent heaven bestows  Guildford  joins their hand  JULIA  Spare me my Lord you scarcely are return'd  Confusion stops my tongueyet I will own  If there be truth or faith in woman's vows  Then you have still been present to this heart  And not a thought has wander'd from its duty  Exeunt  Julia  and  Emmelina  RIVERS  Looking after  Julia    Oh generous Julia  ORLANDO  Aside to  Bertrand    Mark how much she loves him  BERTRAND  Aside to  Orlando    Mere words which the fond sex have always ready  RIVERS  Forgive me good Orlando best of friends  How my soul joys to meet thee on this shore  Thus to embrace thee in my much lov'd England  GUILDFORD  England the native soil the land of heroes  Where great Elizabeth the sceptre sways  O'er a free glorious rich and happy people  Philosophy not cloister'd up in schools  The speculative dream of idle monks  Attir'd in attic robe here roams at large  Wisdom is wealth and science is renown  Here sacred laws protect the meanest subject  The bread that toil procures fair freedom sweetens  And every peasant eats his homely meal  Content and free Lord of his small domain  RIVERS  Past are those gothic days and grant kind heav'n  They be forever past when English subjects  Were born the vassals of some tyrant lord  When freesoul'd men were basely handed down  To the next heir transmitted with their lands  The shameful legacy from sire to son  GUILDFORD  But while thy generous soul my noble boy  Justly abhors oppression yet revere  The plain stern virtues of our rough forefathers  O never may the gallant sons of England  Lose their plain manly native character  Forego the glorious charter nature gave'em  Beyond what kings can give or laws bestow  Of candour courage constancy and truth  Exeunt  Guildford  and  Rivers  ORLANDO  Stay Bertrand stayOh pity my distraction  This heart was never made to hide its feelings  I had near betray'd myself  BERTRAND  I trembled for you  Remember that the eye of love is piercing  And Emmelina mark'd you  ORLANDO  'Tis too much  My artless nature cannot bear disguise  Think what I felt when unsuspecting Rivers  Press'd me with gen'rous rapture to his bosom  Profess'd an honest joy and call'd me friend  I felt myself a traytor yet I swear  Yes by that power who sees the thoughts of men  I swear I love the gallant Rivers more  Than light or life I love but yet I fear him  I shrunk before the lustre of his virtue  I felt as I had wrong'd himfelt abash'd  I cannot bear this conflict in my soul  And therefore have resolv'd  BERTRAND  On what  ORLANDO  To fly  BERTRAND  To fly from Julia  ORLANDO  Yes to fly from all  From every thing I love to fly from Rivers  From Emmelina from myself from thee  From Julia nothat were impossible  For I shall bear her image in my soul  It is a part of me the dearest part  So closely interwoven with my being  That I can never lose the dear remembrance  Till I am robb'd of life and her together  BERTRAND  'Tis cowardly to fly  ORLANDO  To stay is base  BERTRAND  Where wou'd you go How lost in thought he stands  Aside  A vulgar villain now would use persuasion  And by his very earnestness betray  The thing he meant to hide I'll coolly wait  Till the occasion shews me how to act  Then turn it to my purpose Ho Orlando  Where wou'd you go  ORLANDO  To everlasting solitude  Yes I will shroud my youth in some dark cell  Where Disappointment steals Devotion's name  To cheat the wretched votary into ruin  There will I live in love with misery  Ne'er shall the sight of mirth prophane my grief  The sound of joy shall never charm my ear  Nor music reach it save when the slow bell  Wakes the dull brotherhood to lifeless prayer  Then when the slowretreating world recedes  Desires are dead and burning passions cold  And all things but my Julia are forgotten  One thought of her shall fire my languid soul  Warm the faint orison and feed despair  BERTRAND  What with monastic lazy drones retire  And chaunt cold hymns with holy hypocrites  First perish all the sex forbid it manhood  Where is your nobler self for shame Orlando  Renounce this superstitious whining weakness  Or I shall blush to think I call'd you friend  ORLANDO  What can I do  BERTRAND  After a pause  Beg she'll defer the marriage  But for one single day do this and leave  The rest to me she shall be thine  ORLANDO  How say'st thou  What wrong her virtue  BERTRAND  Still this cant of virtue  This pompous shew of words without a meaning  I grant that honour's something manly honour  I'd fight I'd burn I'd bleed I'd die for honour  But what's this virtue  ORLANDO  Ask you what it is  Why 'tis what libertines themselves adore  'Tis the celestial colouring of beauty  Which wakens gallantry and fans desire  Beyond the rosy lip or starry eye  Nay she who ministers to guilty pleasures  Puts on its semblance when she most wou'd please  'Tis heaven's own energy th'aetherial flame  Which animates cold beauty into spirit  Exit  Manet  BERTRAND  Curse on his principles Yet I shall shake them  And bend his pliant spirit to my will  Now while 'tis warm with passion and will take  Whatever mould my forming hand will give it  'Tis worthy of my genius Then I love  This Emmelinatrue she loves not me  But shou'd young Rivers die his father's lands  On me devolveIs Rivers then immortal  ComeGuildford's lands and his proud daughter's hand  Are worth some thought why what sharp spurs to genius  Are mischief poverty revenge and love  Exit  Bertrand  Enter  EMMELINA  and  RIVERS  talking  EMMELINA  Yet do not blame Orlando good my brother  He's still the same that brave frank heart you lov'd  Only his temper's chang'd he is grown sad  But that's no fault I only am to blame  Fond foolish heart to give itself away  To one who gives me nothing in return  RIVERS  How's this my father said Orlando lov'd thee  EMMELINA  Indeed I thought sohe was kinder once  Nay still he loves or my poor heart deceives me  RIVERS  If he has wrong'd thee yet I know he could not  His gallant soul is all made up of virtues  And I would rather doubt myself than him  Yet tell me all the story of your loves  And let a brother's fondness sooth thy cares  EMMELINA  When to this castle first Orlando came  A welcome guest to all to me most welcome  Yes spite of maiden shame and burning blushes  Let me confess he was most welcome to me  At first my foolish heart so much deceiv'd me  I thought I lov'd him for my brother's sake  But when I closely search'd this bosom traytor  I found alas I lov'd him for his own  RIVERS  Blush not to own it 'twas a well plac'd flame  I glory in the merit of my friend  And love my sister more for loving him  EMMELINA  He talk'd of you I listen'd with delight  And thought it was the subject only charm'd me  But when Orlando chose another theme  Forgive me Rivers but I listen'd still  With undiminish'd joyhe talk'd of love  Nor was that theme less grateful than the former  I seem'd the very idol of his soul  Rivers he said would thank me for the friendship  I bore to his Orlando I believ'd him  Julia was absent thenbut what of Julia  RIVERS  Aye what of her indeed why nam'd you Julia  You could not surely think no that were wild  Why did you mention Julia  EMMELINA  Nay 'twas nothing  'Twas accident nor had my words a meaning  If I did name her 'twas to note the time  To mark the period of Orlando's coldness  The circumstance was casual and but meant  To date the time it aim'd at nothing farther  RIVERS  'Tis very like no more I'm satisfied  You talk as I had doubts I have no doubts  Why do you labour to destroy suspicions  Which never had a birth is she not mine  Mine by the fondest ties of dear affection  But did Orlando change at her return  Did he grow cold It could not be for that  And yet you say 'twas at that time it happen'd  Was it just then I have no cause for asking  But for the love I bear my dearest sister  EMMELINA  'Twas as I said  RIVERS  He loves thee Emmelina  These starts of passion this unquiet temper  Betray how much he loves thee yes my sister  He fears to lose thee fears his father's will  May dash his rising hopes nor give thee to him  EMMELINA  Oh flatterer thus to sooth my easy nature  With tales of possible though doubtful bliss  Because it may be true my credulous heart  Whispers it is and fondly loves to cherish  The feeble glimmering of a sickly hope  RIVERS  This precious moment worth a tedious age  Of vulgar time I've stol'n from love and Jusia  She waits my coming and a longer stay  Were treason to her beauty and my love  Exeunt  End of the Second Act  ACT THE THIRD  SCENE a Garden  EMMELINA  WHY do my feet unbidden seek this grove  Why do I trace his steps I thought him here  This is his hour of walking and these shades  His daily haunt oft have they heard his vows  Ah fatal vows which stole my peace away  But now he shun's my presence yet who knows  He may not be ungrateful but unhappy  Yes he will come to clear his past offences  With such prevailing eloquence will plead  So mourn his former coldness and neglect  And by ten thousand graceful ways repair them  That I shall think I never was offended  He comes and every doubt's at once dispell'd  'Twas fancy all he never meant to wrong me  Enter  ORLANDO  ORLANDO  Why at this hour of universal joy  When every heart beats high with grateful rapture  And pleasure dances her enchanting round  O tell me why at this auspicious hour  You quit the joyful circle of your friends  "Rob social pleasures of its sweetest charm  "And leave a void ev'n in the happiest hearts  "An aching void which only you can fill"  Why seek alone these unfrequented shades  These gloomy haunts unfit for blooming beauty  But made for meditation and misfortune  EMMELINA  I might retort the charge my lord Orlando  And ask you how the bosomfriend of Rivers  Whom he has held deeprooted in his heart  Beyond a brother's dearness sav'd his life  And cherish'd it when sav'd beyond his own  I might enquire why when this Rivers comes  After long tedious months of expectation  Alive victorious and as firm in friendship  As fondness cou'd have wish'd or f  ncy feign'd  I might enquire why thus Orlando shuns him  Why thus he courts this melancholy gloom  As if he were at variance with delight  And scorn'd to mingle in the general joy  ORLANDO  Oh my fair monitress I have desery'd  Your gentle censure  EMMELINA  You will then grow chearful  Nor give your friends who love you room for blame  Julia complains too of you  ORLANDO  Ah does Julia  If Julia chides me I have erred indeed  For harshness is a stranger to her nature  But why does she complain O tell me wherefore  That I may soon repair th' unwilling crime  And prove my heart was guiltless of the offence  EMMELINA  Why so alarm'd  ORLANDO  Alarm'd  EMMELINA  Indeed you seem'd so  ORLANDO  Sure you mistake Alarm'd oh no I was not  There was no causeI cou'd not be alarm'd  Upon so slight a ground Something you said  But what I know not of your friend  EMMELINA  Did I  ORLANDO  That Julia was displeas'dwas it not so  'Twas that or something like it  EMMELINA  She complains  That you avoid her  ORLANDO  How that I avoid her  Did Julia say so ah you have forgot  It cou'd not be  EMMELINA  Why are you terrified  ORLANDO  No  Not terrifiedI am notbut were those  Her very words you might mistake her meaning  Did Julia say Orlando shun'd her presence  Oh did she cou'd she say so  EMMELINA  If she did  Why this disorder there's no cause  ORLANDO  No cause  O there's a cause of dearer worth than empire  Quick let me fly and find the fair upbraider  Tell her she wrongs me tell her I wou'd die  Rather than meet her anger  Emmelina faints  Ah you faint  What have I said curse my imprudent tongue  Look up sweet innocence my Emmelina  My gentle friend awake look up fair creature  'Tis your Orlando calls  EMMELINA  Orlando's voice  Methought he talk'd of lovenay do not mock me  My heart is but a weak a very weak one  I am not weilperhaps I've been to blame  Spare my confusion  Exit Emmelina  ORLANDO  So I've betray'd my secret  And struck a poison'd dagger to her heart  Her innocent heart Why what a wretch am I  Ruin approaches shall I tamely meet it  And  with destruction till it blast me  No I will sly thee Julia fly for ever  He sly what then becomes of Emmelina  Shah I abandon her it must be so  Better escape with this poor wreck of honour  Than hazard all by stayingRivers here  Enter  RIVERS  RIVERS  The same My other self my own Orlando  I came to seek thee 'twas in thy kind bosom  My suffering soul repos'd its secret cares  When doubts and difficulties stood before me  And now now when my prosperous fortune shines  And gilds the smiling hour with her bright beams  Shall I become a niggard of my bliss  Defraud thee of thy portion of my joys  And rob thee of thy wellearn'd claim to share them  ORLANDO  That I have ever lov'd thee witness Heaven  That I have thought thy friendship the best blessing  That mark'd the fortune of my happier days  I here attest the sovereign judge of hearts  Then think O think what anguish I endure  When I declare in bitterness of spirit  That we must part  RIVERS  What does Orlando mean  ORLANDO  That I must leave thee Rivers must renounce  Thy lov'd society  RIVERS  Thou hast been wrong'd  Thy merit has been slighted sure my father  Who knew how dear I held theebut he cou'd not  ORLANDO  He is all goodness nothere is a cause  Seek not to know it  RIVERS  Now by holy friendship  I swear thou shalt not leave me what just now  When I have safely pass'd so many perils  Escap'd so many threat'ning deaths return'd  To the kind arms of long desiring friendship  And now when I expected such a welcome  As happy souls in paradise bestow  Upon a new inhabitant who comes  To taste their blessedness you coldly tell me  You will depart it must not be Orlando  ORLANDO  It must it must  RIVERS  Ah must then tell me wherefore  ORLANDO  I wou'd not dim thy dawn of happiness  Nor shade the brighter beams of thy good fortune  With the dark sullen cloud that hangs o'er mine  RIVERS  Is this the heart of him I call'd my friend  Full of the graceful weakness of affection  How have I known it bend at my request  How lose the power of obstinate resistance  Because his friend intreated This Orlando  How is he chang'd  ORLANDO  Alas how chang'd indeed  How dead to every relish of delight  How chang'd in all but in his love for thee  Yet think not that my nature is grown harder  That I have lost that ductile yielding heart  Rivers I have notoh 'tis still too soft  Ev'n now it melts it bleeds in tenderness  FarewelI dare not trust myselffarewel  RIVERS  Then thou resolv'st to go  ORLANDO  This very day  RIVERS  What do I hear Today It must not be  This is the day that makes my Julia mine  ORLANDO  Wed her today  RIVERS  This day unites me to her  Then stay at least till thou behold'st her mine  ORLANDO  Impossible another day were ruin  RIVERS  Then let me fly to Julia and conjure her  To bless me with her hand this very hour  ORLANDO  Oh no no no  RIVERS  I will in such a cause  Surely she will forego the rigid forms  Of cold decorum then my best Orlando  I shall receive my Julia from thy hand  The blessing will be doubled I shall owe  The precious gift of love to sacred friendship  ORLANDO  Can'st thou bear this my heart  RIVERS  Then my Orlando  Since thy unkind reserve denies my heart  Its partnership in this thy hoard of sorrows  I will not press to know it thou shalt go  Soon as the holy priest has made us one  For oh 'twill sooth thee in the hour of parting  To know l'm in possession of my love  To think I'm blest with Julia to reflect  Thou gav'st her to my arms my bride my wife  ORLANDO  Ah my brain turns  RIVERS  'Tis as I thought I'll try him  Aside  Now answer me Orlando and with truth  Hide nothing from thy frienddost thou not love  ORLANDO  Ha how I am betray'd he reads my soul  RIVERS  Hast thou with all that tenderness of nature  Preserv'd thy bosom from love's soft infection  Has conquering beauty never touch'd thy soul  Come come I know full well  ORLANDO  Ha dost thou know  And knowing dost thou suffer me to live  And dost thou know my guilt and call me friend  He mocks but to destroy me  RIVERS  Come no more  Love is a proud an arbitrary God  And will not chuse as rigid fathers bid  I know that thine has destin'd for thy bride  A Tuscan maid but hearts disdain all force  ORLANDO  How's this what dost thou justify my passion  RIVERS  Applaud itglory

I'm giddy stilloh yes I understand thee  Thy beauteous sister what a wretch I've been  Oh Rivers too much softness has undone me  Yet I will never wrong the maid I love  Nor injure thee first let Orlando perish  RIVERS  Be more explicit  ORLANDO  For the present spare me  Think not too hardly of me noble Rivers  I am a man and full of human frailties  When I am ready to depart I'll see thee  Clear all my long accounts of love and honour  Remove thy doubts embrace thee and expire  Exit  Orlando  Manet  RIVERS  It must be soto what excess he loves her  Yet wherefore not demand her for his birth  May claim alliance with the proudest fortune  Sure there's some hidden causeperhapsah no  Turn from that thought my soul 'twas vile suspicion  'Tis true their faiths are differentthen his father  Austere and rigid dooms him to another  That must not bethese bars shall be remov'd  I'll serve him with my life nor taste of bliss  'Till I have sought to make Orlando happy  Exit  Reenter  ORLANDO  ORLANDO  Wed her today wed her perhaps this hour  Hasten the rites for  me I  give her to him  I  stand a tame spectator of their bliss  I  live a patient witness of their joy  First let this dagger drink my heart's warm blood  Takes a dagger from his bosom then sees  Julia  The sorceress comes oh there's a charm about her  Which holds my hand and makes me wish to live  I shudder at her

bridegroom find  To think upon so lost a wretch as I am  You hate me Julia  JULIA  Hate you how you wrong me  Live to partake our joy  ORLANDO  Hope you for joy  JULIA  Have I not cause am I not lov'd by Rivers  Rivers the best the bravest of his sex  Whose valour fabled heroes ne'er surpass'd  Whose virtues teach the young and charm the old  Whose graces are the wonder of our sex  And envy of his own  ORLANDO  Enough enough  But Julia if you wou'd not here behold me  Stretch'd at your feet a lifeless bloody corse  Promise what I shall now request  JULIA  What is it  ORLANDO  That till tomorrow's sun I ask no longer  You will defer this marriage  JULIA  Ha defer it  Impossible what wou'd my Rivers think  ORLANDO  No matter what 'tis for his sake I ask it  His peace his happiness

what I hear by chance  As of a thing I knew  He listens  ORLANDO  After a pause  And is she gone  Her parting words shot fire into my soul  Did she not say she left me with regret  Her look was tender and the starting tear  Fill'd her bright eye she left me with regret  She own'd it too  BERTRAND  'Twill do  Comes forward  What have you done  The charming Julia is dissolv'd in woe  Her radiant eyes are quench'd in floods of tears  For you they fall her blushes have confess'd it  ORLANDO  For me what say'st thou Julia weep for me  Yet she is gentle and she wou'd have wept  For thee for any who but seem'd unhappy  BERTRAND  Ungrateful  ORLANDO  How  BERTRAND  Not by her tears I judge  But by her words not meant for me to hear  ORLANDO  What did she say What didst thou hear good Bertrand  SpeakI'm on fire  BERTRAND  It is not safe to tell you  Farewel I wou'd not injure Rivers  ORLANDO  Stay  Or tell me all or I renounce thy friendship  BERTRAND  That threat unlocks my tongue I must not lose thee  Sweet Julia wept clasp'd her fair hands and cried  Why was I left a legacy to Rivers  Robb'd of the power of choice seeing me she started  Wou'd have recal'd her words blush'd and retir'd  ORLANDO  No more thou shalt not tempt me to my ruin  Deny what thou hast said deny it quickly  E'er I am quite undone for oh I feel  Retreating virtue touches its last post  And my lost soul now verges on destruction  Bertrand she promis'd to defer the marriage  BERTRAND  Then my point's gain'd that will make Rivers jealous  Aside  She loves you  ORLANDO  No and even if she did  I have no hope  BERTRAND  You are too scrupulous  Be bold and be successful sure of this  There is no fault a woman sooner pardons  Than that of which her beauty is the cause  ORLANDO  Shall I defraud my friend he bled to gain her  What rob the dear preserver of my life  Of all that makes the happiness of his  And yet her wondrous beauty might excuse  Nay almost sanctify a perjury  My soul is up in arms my reason's lost  And love and rage and jealousy and honour  Pull my divided heart and tear my soul  Exit  Manet  BERTRAND  Rave on and beat thy wings poor bird thou'rt lim'd  And vain will be thy struggles to get loose  How much your very honest men lack  prudence  Tho' all the nobler virtues fill one scale  Yet place but indiscretion in the other  In worldly business and the ways of men  That single folly shall weigh down the balance  While the ascending virtues kick the beam  Here's this Orlando now of rarest parts  Honest heroic frank and generous  As inexperience of mankind can make him  Yet shall this single weakness this  imprudence  Pull down the heaviest plagues upon his head  And snare his heedless soul beyond redemption  While dull unfeeling hearts and frozen spirits  Sordidly safe secure because untempted  Look up and wonder at the generous vice  They wanted wit to form and souls to dare  End of the Third Act  ACT THE FOURTH  SCENE an Apartment  EMMELINA  HOW many ways there are of being wretched  The avenues to happiness how few  When will this busy fluttering heart be still  When will it cease to feel and beat no more  Ev'n now it shudders with a dire presage  Of something terrible it fears to know  Ent'ring I saw my venerable father  In earnest conference with the Count Orlando  Shame and confusion fill'd Orlando's eye  While stern resentment fir'd my father's cheek  And look he comes with terror on his brow  He sees me he beholds his child and now  The terror of his look is lost in love  In fond paternal love  Enter  GUILDFORD  GUILDFORD  Come to my arms  And there conceal that sweet that asking eye  Lest it shou'd read what I wou'd hide for ever  Wou'd hide from all but most wou'd hide from thee  Thy father's grief his shame his rage his tears  EMMELINA  Tears heaven and earth behold my father weeps  GUILDFORD  He who has drawn this sorrow from my eyes  Shall pay me back again in tears of blood  'Tis for thy sake my child  EMMELINA  For me for me  Hear heaven and judge hear heaven and punish me  If any crime of mine  GUILDFORD  Thou art all innocence  Just what a parent's fondest wish wou'd frame  No fault of thine e'er stain'd thy father's cheek  For if I blush'd it was to hear thy virtues  And think that thou wast mine and if I wept  It was from joy and gratitude to heaven  That made me father of a child like thee  Orlando  EMMELINA  What of him  GUILDFORD  I cannot tell thee  An honest shame a virtuous pride forbids  EMMELINA  Speak  GUILDFORD  Canst thou not guess and spare thy father  EMMELINA  Perhapsperhaps I canand yet I will not  Tell me the worst while I have sense to hear  Thou wilt not speaknay never turn away  Dost thou not know that fear is worse than grief  There may be bounds to grief fear knows no bounds  "In grief we know the worst of what we feel  "But who can tell the end of what we fear"  Grief mourns some sorrow past and therefore known  But fear runs wild with horrible conjecture  GUILDFORD  Then hear the worst and arm thy soul to bear it  He hashe hasOrlando has refused thee  EMMELINA  After a long pause  'Tis well'tis very well'tis as it shou'd be  GUILDFORD  Oh there's an eloquence in that mute woe  Which mocks all language Speak relieve thy heart  Thy bursting heart thy father cannot bear it  Am I a man no more of this fond eyes  I am grown weaker than a chidden infant  While not a sigh escapes to tell thy pain  EMMELINA  See I am calm I do not shed a tear  The warrior weeps the woman is a hero  GUILDFORD  Embraces her  My glorious child now thou art mine indeed  Forgive me if I thought thee fond and weak  I have a Roman matron for my daughter  And not a feeble girl And yet I fear  For oh I know thy tenderness of soul  I fear this silent anguish but portends  Some dread convulsion fatal to thy peace  EMMELINA  I will not shame thy blood and yet my father  Methinks thy daughter shou'd not be refus'd  Refus'd It has a harsh ungrateful sound  Thou shoud'st have found a softer term refus'd  And have I then been held so cheap Refus'd  Been treated like the light ones of my sex  Held up to sale been offer'd and refus'd  GUILDFORD  Long have I known thy love I thought it mutual  To spare thy blushes met the Count  EMMELINA  No more  I am content to know I am rejected  But save my pride the mortifying tale  Spare me particulars of how and when  And do not parcel out thy daughter's shame  No flowers of rhetoric no arts of speech  Can change the factOrlando has refus'd me  GUILDFORD  He shall repent this outrage  EMMELINA  Think no more on't  I'll teach thee how to bear it I'll grow proud  As gentle spirits still are apt to do  When cruel slight or killing scorn falls on them  Come virgin dignity come female pride  Come wounded modesty come slighted love  Come scorn come conscious worth come black despair  Support me arm me fill me with my wrongs  Sustain this feeble spiritBut for thee  But for thy sake my dear fond injur'd

of my soul  Hear my fond pleadingsave me from that curse  Thus I adjure thee by the dearest ties  Kneels  Which link society by the sweet names  Of Parent and of Child by all the joys  These tender claims have yielded I adjure thee  Breathe not this fatal secret to my brother  Oh tell him not his sister was refus'd  That were consummate woe full perfect ruin  I cannot speak the rest but thou can'st guess it  And tremble to become a childless father  Exit Emmelina  GUILDFORD  What art thou Life thou lying vanity  Thou promiser who never mean'st to pay  Yet let me not complain I have a son

hurricanes and haggard famine  That man must perish by the hand of man  Nay to complete the horror friend by friend  RIVERS  What shall I then endure this outrage tamely  Is honour nothing  EMMELINA  Honour 'tis a phantom  Who having nothing solid in himself  Decks his thin form in the bright robe of virtue  Honour I know him well 'tis the fell demon  Who seeds on orphans tears and widows groans  And slakes his impious thirst in human blood  "Tis the archfiend's prime instrument of mischief  "His grand device to people his dark realms  "With noble spirits who but for this curst honour  "Had been at peace on earth or bless'd in heaven"  With this  false  honour Christians have no commerce  Religion disavows and truth disowns it  ORLANDO  Throws away his sword  An angel speaks and angels claim obedience  RIVERS  To Orlando  This is the heart thou hast wrong'd  EMMELINA  Comes up to Orlando  I pity thee  Calamity has taught me how to pity  Before I knew distress my heart was hard  But now it melts at every touch of woe  "Baneful prosperity corrupts the heart  "But wholesome sufferings bring it back to virtue  Rivers he once was good and just like thee  Who shall be proud and think he stands secure  If thy Orlando's false  RIVERS  Think of his crime  EMMELINA  Oh think of his temptation think'twas Julia  Thy heart cou'd not resist her how shou'd his  It is the very error of his friendship  Your souls were fram'd so very much alike  He cou'd not chuse but love whom Rivers lov'd  ORLANO  Think'st thou there is in death a pang like this  Strike my brave friend be sudden and be silent  Death which is terrible to happy men  To me will be a blessing I have lost  All that cou'd make life dear I've lost my friend  I've stab'd the peace of mind of that fair creature  I have surviv'd my honour this is dying  The mournful fondness of officious love  Will plant no thorns upon my dying pillow  No precious tears embalm my memory  But curses follow it  EMMELINA  See Rivers melts  He pities thee  ORLANDO  I'll spare thy noble heart  The pain of punishing Orlando's self  Revenges both  Goes to stab himself with the dagger  EMMELINA  Barbarian kill me first  RIVERS  Snatching the dagger  Thou shalt not die I swear I love thee still  That secret sympathy which long has bound us  Pleads for thy life with sweet but strong intreaty  Thou shalt repair the wrongs of that dear saint  And be again my friend  ORLANDO  Oh hear me  EMMELINA  No  I cannot stoop to live on charity  And what but charity is love compell'd  I've been a weak a fond believing woman  Easy 'tis true beyond my sexes softness  But with a woman's weakness I've her pride  I lov'd with virtue yet I fondly lov'd  That passion fix'd my fate determin'd all  And stain'd the colour of my life with woe  Hearts that love well love long they love but once  My peace thou hast destroy'd my honour's mine  She who aspir'd to gain Orlando's heart  Shall never owe Orlando's hand to pity  Exit  Emmelina  ORLANDO  After a pause  And I still live  RIVERS  Farewel shou'd I stay longer  I might forget my vow  ORLANDO  Yet hear me Rivers  Exit  Rivers Orlando  following  Enter  BERTRAND  on the other side  BERTRAND  How's this my fortune fails me both alive  I thought by stirring Rivers to this quarrel  There was at least an equal chance against him  I work invisible and like the tempter  My agency is seen in its effects  Well  honest  Bertrand now for Julia's letter  Takes ok a letter  This fond epistle of a love sick maid  I've sworn to give but did not swear to whom  Give it my love said she my dearest lord  Riv  rs she  ant there's no addressthat's lucky  Then where's the harm Orlando is a lord  As well as Rivers loves her too as well  Breaks open the letter  I must admire your stileyour pardon fair one  Runs over it  Do I not tread in air and walk on stars  There's not a word but fits Orlando's case  As well as Rivers'tender to excess  No name'twill do his faith in me is boundless  Then as the brave are still he's unsuspecting  And credulous beyond a woman's weakness  Going out he spies the dagger  Orlando's daggerha 'tis greatly thought  This may do noble service such a scheme  My genius catches fire the bright idea  Is form'd at once and fit for glorious action  Exit  End of the Fourth Act  ACT THE FIFTH  SCENE the Garden  BERTRAND  TWAS here we were to meet where does he stay  This compound of strange contradicting parts  Too flexible for virtue yet too virtuous  To make a glorious bold successful villain  Conscience be still preach not remorse to me  Remorse is for the luckless failing villain  He who succeeds repents not penitence  Is but another name for ill success  Was Nero penitent when Rome was burnt  No but had Nero been a petty villain  Subject to laws and liable to fear  Nero perchance had been a penitent  He comesThis paper makes him all my own  Enter  ORLANDO  ORLANDO  At length this wretched tempest beaten bark  Seems to have found its haven I'm resolv'd  My wav'ring principles are fix'd to honour  My virtue gathers force my mind grows strong  I feel an honest confidence within  A precious earnest of returning peace  BERTRAND  Who feels secure stands on the verge of ruin  Aside  Trust me it joys my heart to see you thus  What have I not attempted for your sake  My love for you has warp'd my honest nature  And friendship has infring'd on higher duties  ORLANDO  It was a generous fault  BERTRAND  Yet 'twas a fault  Oh for a flinty heart that knows no weakness  But moves right onward unseduc'd by friendship  And all the soft affections of the soul  ORLANDO  This is my last farewel absence alone  Can prop my stagg'ring virtue  BERTRAND  You're resolv'd  Then Julia's favours come too late  ORLANDO  What mean'st thou  BERTRAND  Nay nothing I renounce those weak affections  Which have misled us both I too repent  And will return the letter back to Julia  ORLANDO  Letter what letter Julia write to me  I will not see itWhat wou'd Rivers say  Bertrand he sav'd my lifeI will not see it  BERTRAND  I do not mean you shou'd nay I refus'd  To bring it you  ORLANDO  Refus'd to bring the letter  BERTRAND  Yes I refus'd at first  ORLANDO  Then thou hast brought it  My faithful Bertandcome  BERTRAND  'Twere best not to see it  ORLANDO  Not see it how not read my Julia's letter  An empire shou'd not bribe me to forbear  Come come  BERTRAND  Alas how frail is human virtue  My resolution melts and tho' I mean not  To trust you with the letter I must tell you  With what a thousand thousand charms she gave it  Take this said she and as Orlando reads it  Attend to every accent of his voice  Watch every little motion of his eye  Mark if it sparkles when he talks of Julia  If when he speaks poor Julia be the theme  If when he sighs his bosom heave for Julia  Note every trisling act each little look  For oh of what importance is the least  To hapless Julia  ORLANDO  The delicious poison  Has tainted all my soul give me the letter  Bertrand offers it Orlando refuses  Ha where's the virtue which but now I boasted  'Tis lost 'tis goneconflicting passions tear me  I am again a villainGive itno  A spark of honour strikes upon my soul  Take back the letter take it back good Bertrand  Spite of myself compel me to be just  I will not read it  BERTRAND  How your friend will thank you  Another day makes Julia his for ever  Even now the great pavilion is prepared  There will the nuptial rites be solemniz'd  Julia already dress'd in bridal robes  Like some fair victim  ORLANDO  O no more no more  What can she write to me  BERTRAND  Some prudent counsel  ORLANDO  Then wherefore fear to read it come I'll venture  What wondrous harm can one poor letter do  The letterquickthe letter  BERTRAND  Since you force me  Gives it  ORLANDO  Be firm ye shivering nerves It is her hand  Reads  "To spare my blushes Bertand brings you this  How have you wrong'd me you believed me false  'Twas my compassion for your friend deceiv'd you  Meet me at midnight in the great Pavilion  Till then avoid my presence from that hour  My future life is your's your oncelov'd friend  I pity and esteem but you alone  Possess the heart of Julia"  This to me  I dream I rave 'tis all Elysium round me  And thou my better angel this to me  BERTRAND  I'm dumb oh Julia what a fall is thine  ORLANDO  What is it such a crime to love away  Thy moral comes too late thou shoud'st have urg'd  Thy caution sooner or not urg'd at all  Thou shoud'stalas I know not what I say  But this I know the charming Julia loves me  Appoints a meeting at the dead of night  She loves The rest is all beneath my care  BERTRAND  Be circumspect the hour is just at hand  Since all is ready for your purpos'd parting  See your attendants be dispos'd aright  Near the Pavilion Gate  ORLANDO  Why so  BERTRAND  Why so  Make Julia the companion of your flight  'Tis what she means you must not mind her struggles  A little gentle violence perhaps  To make her yield to what she had resolv'd  And save her pride she'll thank you for it after  ORLANDO  Take her by force I like not that O Bertrand  There is a mutinous spirit in my blood  That wars against my conscienceTell my Julia  I will not fail to meet her  BERTRAND  I obey  Be near the garden I shall soon return  Exit Bertrand  ORLANDO  This giant sin whose bulk so lately scar'd me  Shrinks to a common size I now embrace  What I but lately fear'd to look upon  Why what a progress have I made in guilt  Where is the hideous form it lately wore  It grows familiar to me I can think  Contrive and calmly mediate on mischief  Talk temp'rately of sin and cherish crimes  I lately so abhorr'd that had they once  But glanc'd upon the surface of my fancy  I had been terrified Oh conscience conscience  Exit Orlando  Scene changes to another part of the Garden A grand Pavilion The moon shining  Enter  RIVERS  in a melancholy attitude  RIVERS  Ye dear ye well known scenes of former bliss  Scenes which I hop'd were fated to bestow  Still dearer blessings in a beauteous bride  Thou gay pavilion which art dress'd so fair  To witness my espousals why ah why  Art thou adorn'd in vain Yet still I court thee  For Julia lov'd thee oncedear faithless Julia  Yet is she false Orlando swore she was not  It may be so yet she avoids my presence  Keeps close from every eye but most from mine  Enter  ORLANDO  ORLANDO  Ha Rivers here wou'd I had shunn'd his walks  How shall I meet the man I mean to wrong  RIVERS  Why does Orlando thus expose his health  To this cold air  ORLANDO  I ask the same of Rivers  RIVERS  Because this solitude this silent hour  Feeds melancholy thoughts and sooths my soul  My Julia will not see me  ORLANDO  How  RIVERS  She denies me  Admittance to her presence  ORLANDO  Aside  Then I'm lost  Confirm'd a villain now 'tis plain she loves me  RIVERS  She will not pardon me this single fault  Of jealous love tho' thou hadst clear'd up all  ORLANDO  Wait 'till tomorrow all will then be known  RIVERS  Wait 'till tomorrow Look at that pavilion  All was prepar'd yes I dare tell thee all  For thou art honest now  ORLANDO  Aside  That wounds too deeply  RIVERS  Soon as the midnight bell gave the glad summons  This dear pavilion had beheld her mine  ORLANDO  All will be well tomorrow  Aside    If I stay  I shall betray the wholeGood night my Rivers  RIVERS  Good night go you to rest I still shall walk  Exit Orlando  RIVERS  Yes I will trace her haunts my too fond heart  Like a poor bird that's hunted from its nest  Dares not return and knows not how to go  Still it delights to hover round the spot  Which lately held its treasure eyes it still  And with heartbreaking tenderness surveys  The scene of joys which never may return  Exit  Scene changes to another Part of the Garden  Reenter  ORLANDO  ORLANDO  Did he say rest talk'd he of rest to me  Can rest and guilt associate but no matter  I cannot now go back then such a prize  Wou'd make archangels forfeit their allegiance  I dare not think reflection leads to madness  Enter  BERTRAND  Bertrand I was not made for this dark work  My heart recoilspoor Rivers  BERTRAND  What of Rivers  ORLANDO  I've seen him  BERTRAND  Where  ORLANDO  Before the great pavilion  BERTRAND  Aside  That's lucky saves me trouble were he absent  Half of my scheme had fail'd  ORLANDO  He's most unhappy  He wish'd me rest spoke kindly to me Bertrand  How how can I betray him  BERTRAND  He deceives you  He's on the watch else wherefore now abroad  At this late hour beware of treachery  ORLANDO  I am myself a traytor  BERTRAND  Come no more  The time draws near you know the cypress walk  'Tis dark  ORLANDO  The fitter for dark deeds like mine  BERTRAND  I have prepared your men when the bell strikes  Go into the pavilion there you'll find  The blushing maid who with faint screams perhaps  Will feign resentment But you want a sword  ORLANDO  A swordI'll murder no onewhy a sword  BERTRAND  'Tis prudent to be arm'd no words take mine  There may be danger Julia may be lost  This night secures or loses her for ever  The cypress walkspare none who look like spies  ORLANDO  Looking at the sword  How deeply is that soul involv'd in guilt  Who does not hold communion with it's thought  Nor ask itself what it designs to do  Exit Orlando  BERTRAND  Thus far propitious fortune fills my sails  Yet still I doubt his milkiness of soul  My next exploit must be to find out Rivers  And as from Julia give him a feign'd message  To come in haste to the pavilion gate  There shall Orlando's wellarm'd servants meet him  And take his righteous soul from this bad world  If they shou'd fail his honest cousin Bertrand  Will help him onward in his way to heav'n  Then this good dagger which I'll leave beside him  Will while it proves the deed conceal the doer  'Tis not an English instrument of mischief  And who'll suspect good Bertrand wore a dagger  To clear me further l've no swordunarm'd  Poor helpless Bertrand Then no longer poor  But Guildford's heir and lord of these fair lands  Exit  Bertrand  Enter  ORLANDO  on the other side  ORLANDO  Draw thy dun curtain round oh night black night  Inspirer and concealer of foul crimes  Thou wizard night who conjur'st up foul thoughts  And mak'st him bold who elle wou'd start at guilt  Beneath thy horrid veil he dares to act  What in broad day he wou'd not dare to think  Oh night thou hid'st the dagger's point from men  But can'st thou screen th' assassin from himself  Shut out the eye of heaven extinguish conscience  Or heal the wounds of honour Oh no no no  Yonder she goesthe guilty charming Julia  My genius drives me onJulia I come  Runs off  SCENE  the Pavilion  An arch'd Door through which  JULIA  and her Maid come forward on the Stage  JULIA  Not here not come look out my faithful Anna  There was a timeoh time for ever dear  When Rivers wou'd not make his Julia wait  Perhaps he blames me thinks the appointment bold  Too daring too unlike his bashful Julia  But 'twas the only means my faithful love  Devis'd to save him from Orlando's rashness  I have kept close refus'd to see my Rivers  Now all is still and I have ventur'd forth  With this kind maid and virtue for my guard  Come we'll go in he cannot sure be long  They go into the Pavilion  Enter  ORLANDO  his sword drawn and bloody his hair dishevell'd  ORLANDO  What have I done a deed that earns damnation  Where shall I fly Ha the pavilion door  'Tis openit invites me to fresh guilt  I'll not go inlet that fall'n angel wait  And curse her stars as I do  The midnight Bell strikes  Hark the bell  Demons of darkness what a peal is that  Again 'twill wake the deadI cannot bear it  'Tis terrible as the last trumpet's sound  That was the marriage signal powers of hell  What blessings have I blasted RiversJulia  Julia comes out  JULIA  My Rivers calls I come I comeOrlando  ORLANDO  Yes  Thou beautiful deceiver 'tis that wretch  JULIA  That perjur'd friend  ORLANDO  That devil  JULIA  I'm betray'd  Why art thou here  ORLANDO  Thou canst make ruin lovely  Or I wou'd ask why did'st thou bring me here  JULIA  I bring thee here  ORLANDO  Yes thou bright falsehood thou  JULIA  No by my hopes of heaven where is my Rivers  Some crime is meant  ORLANDO  Catches her hand  Julia the crime is done  Dost thou not shudder art thou not amaz'd  Art thou not cold and blasted with my touch  Is not thy blood congeal'd does no black horror  Fill thy presaging soul look at these hands  Julia they're stain'd with blood blood Julia blood  Nay look upon them  JULIA  Ah I dare notBlood  ORLANDO  Yes thou dear false one with the noblest blood  That ever stain'd a dark assassin's hand  Had not thy letter with the guilty message  To meet thee here this hour blinded my honour  And wrought my passion into burning phrenzy  Whole worlds shou'd not have bribed me  JULIA  Letter and message  I sent thee none  ORLANDO  Then Bertrand has betray'd me  And I have done a deed beyond all reach  All hope of mercyI have murder'd Rivers  JULIA  Oh  She falls into her maid's arms  ORLANDO  Here's the reward which love prepar'd for murder  Thus hell rewards its instruments  Enter  GUILDFORD  with Servants  GUILDFORD  Where is he  Where is this midnight murderer this assassin  This is the place Orlando's servant nam'd  ORLANDO  The storm comes on 'Tis Guildford good old man  Behold the wretch accurst of heaven and thee  GUILDFORD  Accurst of both indeed How Julia fainting  ORLANDO  She's pure as holy truth she was deceiv'd  And so was I

father  I have no child my son is basely murder'd  And my sweet daughter at the fatal news  Is quite bereft of reason  ORLANDO  Seize me bind me  If death's too great a mercy let me live  Drag me to some damp dungeon's horrid gloom  Deep as the centre dark as my offences  Come do your office take my sword oh Bertrand  Yet e'er I perish cou'd it reach thy heart  hey seize Orlando  JULIA  I will not long survive thee oh my Rivers  Enter  RIVERS  with the Dagger  RIVERS  Who calls on Rivers with a voice so sad  So full of sweetness  GUILDFORD  Ah my son  JULIA  'Tis he 'tis he  Julia and Rivers run into cach other's arms Orlando breaks from the guards and falls on his knees  ORLANDO  He lives he lives the godlike Rivers lives  Hear it ye host of heaven witness ye saints  Recording angels tell it in your songs  Breathe it celestial spirits to your lutes  That Rivers lives  JULIA  Explain this wonderous happiness  RIVERS  'Twas Bertrand whom Orlando killed the traytor  Has with his dying breath confess'd the whole  ORLANDO  Good sword I thank thee  RIVERS  In his confusion  Orlando miss'd the path he was to take  And pass'd thro' that where Bertrand lay conceal'd  To watch th' event Orlando thought 'twas me  And that I play'd him false the walk was dark  In Bertrand's bloody hand I found this dagger  With which he meant to take my life but how  Were you alarm'd  GUILDFORD  One of Orlando's men  Whom wealth cou'd never bribe to join in murder  ORLANDO  Murder I bribe to murder  RIVERS  No 'twas Bertrand  Brib'd them to that curst deed he lov'd my sister
