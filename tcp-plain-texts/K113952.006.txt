Written and Selected By FRANCIS FAWKES MA And WILLIAM WOTY  IN TWELVE VOLUMES  LONDON Printed by DRYDEN LEACH For J COOTE at the King's Arms in PaternosterRow MDCCLXIII  THE POETICAL CALENDAR  JUNE AN ODE  HArk 'tis the woodlark's note he feels the sun  And in full glee his mattins has begun  With him the linnet and the blackbird vie  Who sweetest shall salute the summer sky  From bush to bush the jealousy like fire  Seems to enflame the universal choir  Joint is the chorus sweet the serenade  Sweet vocal needs no instrumental aid  Now swell the udders of the milky kine  Now swells the green grape on the tender vine  Like ripen'd strawberries of red and white  The germinating blossoms charm the sight  Blended as in the rainbow various hues  Of flowers uncounted drink the morning dews  Acanthus hyacinth and crocus meet  To make young June rich sandals for her feet  With backward pace a seacrab leads the way  As if it fled the fond pursuit of May  But May is gone and leaves to buxom June  What she had rear'd with nicer care to prune  With animating heat to warm the seed  And of each plant the tender roots to feed  Thus month to month successive recommends  The growth of Nature to promote her ends  Gives to each other's hands the forming care  First January binds with nipping air  Next February lays the earth in snows  And March restrains them as his tempest blows  With milder aspect April sends his shower  And May's warm sun awakes herb tree and flower  'Till warmer suns with brighter June combine  To aid young Nature in her great design  ODE TO SUMMER  BY A GENTLEMAN OF CAMBRIDGE  HAil gentle Summer to this isle  Where Nature's fairest beauties smile  And breathe in every plain  'Tis thine to bid each flower display  And open to the eye of day  The glories of its reign  While yon few sheep enjoy the breeze  That softly dies upon the trees  And rest beneath the shade  This pipe which Damon gave shall raise  Its rural notes to sing thy praise  And ask the Muse's aid  Diana's ear shall catch the sound  And all the Nymphs that sport around  The vale or upland lawn  The Nymphs that o'er the mountain's brow  Pursue the lightlybounding roe  Or chase the flying fawn  Even now perchance some cool retreat  Defends the lovely train from heat  And Phoebus' noontide beam  Perchance they twine the flowery crown  On beds of roses soft as down  Beside the winding stream  Delightful season every mead  With thy fair robe of plenty spread  To thee that plenty owes  The laughing fields with joy declare  And whisper all in reason's ear  From whence that plenty flows  Happy the man whose vessel glides  Safe and unhurt by Passion's tides  Nor courts the gusts of praise  He sails with even steady pace  While Virtue's fullblown beauties grace  The Summer of his days  SUMMER A RURAL SONG  BY MR BREREWOOD  WHere the light cannot pierce in a grove of tall trees  With my fair one as blooming as May  Undisturb'd by all sound but the sighs of the breeze  Let me pass the hot noon of the day  When the sun less intense to the westward inclines  For the meadows the groves we'll forsake  And see the rays dance as inverted he shines  On the face of some river or lake  Where my fairest and I on its verge as we pass  For 'tis she that must still be my theme  Our two shadows may view on the watery glass  While the fish are at play in the stream  May the herds cease to lowe and the lambkins to bleat  When she sings me some amorous strain  All be silent and husht unless echo repeat  The kind words and sweet sounds back again  And when we return to our cottage at night  Hand in hand as we sauntering stray  Let the moon's silver beams thro' the leaves give us light  Just direct us and chequer our way  Let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk  As thus gently and slowly we move  And let no single thought be express'd in our talk  But of friendship improv'd into love  Thus enchanted each day with these rural delights  And secure from ambition's alarms  Soft love and repose shall divide all our nights  And each morning shall rise with new charms  SENT TO A YOUNG LADY  WITH A FINE CARNATION  TO thee my Fair this beauteous flower I send  Admit it as a moralizing friend  " In charms and sweetness you may me excell  " Yet deign to listen while this truth I tell  " I am your emblem drive vain pride away  " Both you and I soon blossom soon decay"  CONTEMPLATION AN ODE  Tecum vivere amem tecum obeaim libens  HOR  COntemplation lovely fair  Far from scenes of noise and care  Evermore delights to dwell  In the still sequester'd cell  Lead me then propitious power  To thy lonely rural bower  To the silent shady wood  To the rivulet's dimpling flood  And on summer mornings lead  To the russet heath or mead  To the cot's plain simple door  The ploughman's peaceful happy floor  Where Phyllis brings her loaded pail  And young affection lisps its tale  Lead to dusky lanes or shades  Where tall oaks lift high their heads  To the seat of happiness  To the garden's lov'd recess  Beds with pinks and roses gay  The pride and boast of June and May  Contemplation nymph serene  Guide to lawns or uplands green  Or near the promontory's side  Let me hear the roaring tide  Hear old Ocean's wild waves roll  On the sad knell slowly toll  Or at gloomy hour of day  With me to the churchyard stray  And meditate among the dead  While the sexton plies his spade  There peruse the timeworn stones  Or as he turns up human bones  Think on what I soon must be  Think on vast eternity  'Till torches dissipate the gloom  And the sable mourners come  'Till the venerable priest  In his snowy surplice dress'd  Loudly begins the solemn lines  And "dust to dust" at length consigns  Hail matron lovely tho' demure  Ever chaste and ever pure  Diffuse thy balm into my breast  Bring with thee happiness and rest  Sooth each melancholy sigh  Teach me to live and teach to die  VERSES WRITTEN IN AN ALCOVE AT  STranger here prolong thy stay  And the rural scene survey  Blossoms beautify the trees  Soft and pleasing is the breeze  Tho' the polyanthus dies  Fairer flowers begin to rise  Roses rear their crimson heads  Tulips decorate yon beds  Linnets chaunt sweet minstrelsy  See how active is the bee  Lo she flies from flower to flower  And exerts her chymic power  View yon grotto in the dell  And admire each polish'd shell  Then with rapture turn thine eye  To the rill that murmurs by  Mark the distant mountain's steep  And the snowy flocks of sheep  And the cattle grazing there  Stranger God is every where  In each favourite scene I see  Omnipresent Deity  Even the rill and antique rock  Lowing herd and harmless flock  Even the Anchorite's abode  Evince a wise and powerful God  ODE ON HEALTH  SHE comesand on each blooming cheek she wears  The blush which bright Aurora's pencil drew  Her eye looks life she breathes etherial sweets  And decks her hair with glittering gems of dew  She comes and with her Hebe  Goddess of Youth  ever young  The sweetest loveliest children of the skies  Health most goodnatur'd makes a longer stay  But Hebe charming cruel Hebe flies  Oh while I feel thy sister's genial ray  Do thou dear Health thy benison bestow  With bounding spirits fill my thirsty soul  And tinge my cheek with thy celestial glow  Ah leave me not unpitied and forlorn  But listen to thy sister's tender cry  For me she pleadsfor me she lifts her hand  Oh hear her Goddesshear her else I die  Grant me thy smile and I will shape my course  To whatsoever spot thy footsteps lead  Thro' bleating vallies and thro' sighing groves  Or o'er the mountains tall majestic head  Or when the sun imprints his virgin kiss  Soft on the surface of the trembling wave  At thy command I'll plunge into the flood  And wake each drowsy Naiad as I lave  List to my prayerbut if thou art resolv'd  That all thy benefits to me shall cease  Grant me some little notice to prepare  My long long journey to the Land of Peace  SONG  SWeet are the banks when Spring perfumes  The verdant plants and laughing flowers  Fragrant the violet as it blooms  And sweet the blossoms after showers  Sweet is the soft the sunny breeze  That fans the golden orangegrove  But oh how sweeter far than these  The kisses are of her I love  Ye roses blushing in your beds  That with your odours scent the air  Ye lillies chaste with silver heads  As my Cleora's bosom fair  No more I court your balmy sweets  For I and I alone can prove  How sweeter when each other meets  The kisses are of her I love  Her tempting eyes my gaze inclin'd  Their pleasing lesson first I caught  Her sense her friendship next confin'd  The willing pupil she had taught  Should fortune stooping from her sky  Conduct me to her bright alcove  Yet like the turtle I should die  Denied the kiss of her I love  ODE TO EVENING  THou tranquil daughter of the day  On whose fair face autumnal Zephyrs play  O'er whose serene unclouded eye  Sol sheds the mildest lustre of the sky  Thee undisturb'd oh let me hail  And tread the carpet of thy verdant vale  Near which with bonnet wheatenbound  Sits Ceres listening to the sheepbell's sound  Or let me woo thee by the stream  Obliquely gilded by the western beam  While flies and gnats unnumber'd throng  And faintly murmur no unpleasing song  Now to enjoy the silent hour  The lark descends from his aerial tower  Apollo is reclin'd to rest  Upon the down of Amphitrite's breast  The bird who loves the coming night  Hoots querulous and flaps his wing for flight  With wheeling plume the bat flies by  And mocks th' imperfect motion of the eye  The buzzing chafer here and there  Spreads his gauze wing and spins along the air  But darkeyed night so Heaven ordains  Comes nodding on and blackens all the plains  The pleasing scenes which Nature drew  Are clouded o'er and vanish'd from the view  The splendid morn the noon of day  And all the shades of evening are away  But soon the splendid morn again  Shall radiate all the firmamental plain  And soon the sun's meridian ray  Zenith'd on high shall give us back the day  And evening thou with aspect bland  Shalt pour thy lengthening shadow o'er the land  Such is thy pictur'd life oh man  Which daily dies and fades as it began  Thy infant morn shall sink away  Thy noon of youth and evening age decay  Then death shall wrap thee in his urn  For dust thou wert and shalt to dust return  THE LADY AND THE LINNET A TALE  ADDRESSED TO A FRIEND  Sumit Myrrha novos veteres ut ponit amictus  Mutat amatores miseros sic mutat amicos  FRAGM INCERT AUT    TO lift the low the proud depress  And succour weakness in distress  A foe forgive and yet contend  With generous ardour for a friend  Are virtues tho' but thinly sown  Not circumscrib'd to you alone  Since hourly observation finds  They spring in some inferior minds  Which tho' we justly pass our praise on  Are not the sound effects of reason  But often flow from whim or fashion  From pride or some impurer passion  But you whom heaven at first design'd  The boast and envy of your kind  Above your sex's censure plac'd  In beauty breeding temper taste  Who only show regard to merit  Unconscious what yourself inherit  While other ladies fume and rail  In indignation at my tale  With each reflection pick a quarrel  And find a satire in each moral  May safely every page peruse  Nor be offended with the muse  Where not a single line appears  Which honour dreads or virtue fears  A hungry hawk in quest of prey  Wide o'er the forest wing'd his way  Whence every bird that haunts the glade  Or warbles in the rural shade  Dispers'd in wild disorder flies  Before the tyrant of the skies  A linnet feebler than the rest  With weary wings and panting breast  Sought Sylvia's window in despair  And fluttering crav'd protection there  Compassion touch'd the fair one's mind  For female hearts are always kind  Upward the gliding sash she threw  And in the little stranger flew  There in her fragrant bosom prest  The nymph revives her drooping guest  Then danger o'er and all serene  Restores him to his fields again  What wondrous joy what grateful love  Inspir'd the wanderer of the grove  In unexpected life elate  When now he recollects his fate  And sets the friendly fair in view  Who gave him life and freedom too  For gratitude to courts unknown  And unreturn'd by man alone  Wide thro' the wing'd creation reigns  And dwells amidst the humble plains  In every verdant field and shade  The just the generous debt is paid  Back from the Sylvan bower he hies  To thank his dear deliverer flies  And at her window chaunting stood  Her praise with all the zeal he could  There Lin his morning visits pays  And there he tunes his evening lays  There oft the noonday hour prolongs  And pours his little soul in songs  His heavenly airs attention drew  And Sylvia soon the warbler knew  Then uses every charm to win  And draw the wild musician in  He enters fearless of a snare  For how should fraud inhabit there  And now by frequent visits free  At first he perches on her knee  Then grown by long acquaintance bolder  Familiarly ascends her shoulder  And wholly now devoid of fear  Plays with the pendant in her ear  O'er all her neck and bosom strays  And like a lover learns to teaze  Pecks on her hand and fondly sips  Delicious nectar from her lips  Thrice happy bird how wert thou bless'd  Of such superior love possess'd  Couldst thou but make the tenure sure  And those unrivall'd hours endure  But love a light fantastic thing  Like thee is always on the wing  And sacred friendship oft a jest  When center'd in a female breast  Thus Lin the circling moments past  In raptures too refin'd to last  When as his constant court he paid  Some envious songsters of the shade  Observ'd his motions to and fro  For merit's ne'er without a foe  They mark'd the transports of his eye  His sprightly air and glossy dye  And all agreed to know ere night  What gave the vagrant such delight  Strait to the beauteous bower they throng  Nor for admittance waited long  The nymph whom every charm attends  Receives her new aerial friends  With crumbled cake and fruitage feeds  And feasts them on her choicest seeds  Did all that kindness could inspire  To bring her coy acquaintance nigh her  And Linny now returns to pay  The due devotions of the day  When to his wondering eyes arose  A numerous circle of his foes  Grief touch'd his soul to see them there  But with a seeming easy air  He took his place among the rest  And sat an undistinguish'd guest  Alas how soon can time destroy  The surest pledge of earthly joy  A favourite's flattering hopes defeat  And tumble tyrants from their state  For time indulgent but to few  Deposes kingsand linnets too  He who was once the nymph's delight  Sits now neglected in her sight  In vain to charm her ear he tries  New forms engag'd her ears and eyes  The goldfinch spreads his gaudy coat  And all were ravish'd with his note  While none attends to Linny's strain  For ah poor Linny's plumes were plain  And now the mournful warbler flown  The nymph and friendly bower their own  O'er all reserve their spleen prevails  And every tongue in concert rails  All wonder'd what her eyes could see  In such a worthless thing as he  Who still pursues his private ends  Ungrateful to his kindest friends  One instance sure might serve to show him  Alas how little did they know him  Some then recounted all the arts  He us'd to vanquish little hearts  Affirm'd he still was making love  And kept a miss in every grove  Could trifle with the meanest fowl  Nay offer courtship to an owl  Scandal tho' pointed in the dark  Is seldom known to miss its mark  While few will interrupt its aim  Regardless of another's fame  Even they by whom we once were lov'd  Thro' life for several years approv'd  When spleen and envy rail aloud  Are often carried with the croud  Preferring rather than contend  To sacrifice their nearest friend  Thus Sylvia yielded to the birds  Too complaisant to doubt their words  Nor thought that creatures so polite  Could deal in calumny and spite  The injur'd Linnet with their leaves  For decency she still receives  Who tho' he sees his foes carest  Like some fond lover hopes the best  And doubts his own discerning eyes  But ah how obvious is disguise  At length of hope itself bereft  When now no friendly look was left  And every mark of fondness fled  He hung his wings and droop'd his head  And am I then resign'd he says  To such ungenerous foes as these  By these defrauded of my bliss  Is all her kindness come to this  Yet ah my tongue forbear to blame  That lov'd that everhonour'd name  This heart howe'er misus'd at last  Must own unnumber'd favours past  And shall tho' ne'er to meet again  The dear remembrance still retain  He spokeand to the window flew  There sat and sung his last adieu  FOUR ODES INTENDED FOR CHORUSES TO A TRAGEDY ALTERED FROM SHAKESPEAR ON THE DEATH OF JULIUS CAESAR  BY THE REV MR HUDSON  ODE I AFTER THE FIRST ACT TO LIBERTY  THE sable queen of shades retires  Encircled with her fading fires  Yok'd to her iron car the dragons fly  With slow wing blackening many a league of sky  Go melancholy Goddess go  Nurse of despondency and woe  'Tis time the cock's shrill clarion calls  The dawn and strikes the prowling wolf with fear  And bids the phantoms disappear  That glimmer 'midst yon mouldring walls  They startle at the sound  And gliding o'er the trackless ground  Loth to their marble mansions haste away  No more their livid lightnings play  The terrors of aerial tumults cease  Hush'd to Serenity and smiling Peace  For lo in heaven's ambrosial bowers  Wak'd by the stationary hours  Parent of day the morn unveils her eyes  And vermeil blushes streak the orient skies  How Nature triumphs at the sight  Renew'd in all her beauty bright  Her fragrant groves their incense yield  The Zephyrs from her humid stores diffuse  The sweetness of mellifluous dews  And Pleasure paints the lillied field  Here gilt with splendid rays  The spires and lofty turrets blaze  There the canals reflect a pleasing gleam  While dancing down the pebbly stream  The silver radiance cheers the feather'd throng  Woods hills and dales reecho with their song  Thus like the Morn will fairest Freedom come  In majesty divine  With dawning glory to disperse the gloom  Of dire oppression and illume the mind  To darkness and despondency confin'd  Arise O Liberty 'tis thine  The charms of nature to refine  With blooming hope and harmony to please  To crown with plenty and to bless with ease  To light up awful Virtue's living ray  And pour the flood of intellectual day  Place me in Afric's desert lands  Where Thirst sits gasping on the sands  If there auspicious Freedom fix her seat  'Midst burning blasts I'll hail the rude retreat  Soon shall the wild more polish'd grown  Admire new beauties not her own  Sage Industry shall dig the well  Capacious yawning many a fathom deep  While lowing herds and bleating sheep  Stand frequent in the cooling cell  Soon shall the mantling vine  Be taught around the palm to twine  And social arts the stranger Naiads wake  That sleep beneath the distant lake  Curious to view young Commerce gaily roam  And bring full harvests to his barren home  Place me beneath the gelid Zone  Near Winter's adamantine throne  Where farthest Ocean foams with icy roar  Along the bleak inhospitable shore  If Freedom to the smoky dome  With furcloath'd mortals deign to roam  Thro' snowy wastes the dome I'll seek  What hinders to enjoy the freezing year  For Property will there appear  And cheerful Health with rosy cheek  Pursue the panting prey  Or mindful of the lengthen'd day  Sit chaunting on the mountain's crystal brow  Where hanging torrents shine below  Nor will Cimmerian Sleep forget to bring  Safe Slumbers waving at his downy wing  Come then Celestial let thy wish'd return  This happier clime serene  This happier clime if Rome thy absence mourn  No more with smiles of pleasure entertains  Nor Baia's groves nor rich Campania's plains  Heartless we view the splendid scene  Of turrets and the painted green  Heartless the music of the groves we hear  As when new harness'd out by wrath and fear  Night's chariot moves in storms and thunders hurl'd  Roll their broad terrors round the groaning world  ODE II AFTER THE SECOND ACT TO FANCY  WHere art thou Fancy visionary maid  Whose lenient artifice and easy aid  Can quell the fierce disorders of the breast  And soothe the pensive soul to rest  Whether along the daisy bank reclin'd  With foliage veil'd you court the fanning wind  Or by the brook's loquacious channel stray  Where the deep dimpled eddies play  Haste thee from the blended glow  Of beauties in yon lucid bow  With finespun light and golden beams  Softly weave thy waking dreams  Bid the rang'd ideas fly  Opening to the ravish'd eye  A glimpse of bliss where gay Desire is found  Sporting with Youth while Music wakes around  Behold the variegated prospect rise  What gallant harmony what glad surprize  The sweet Mygdonian pipe with rural strains  Collects the nymyhs and shepherd swains  Secure in yonder vale their fleecy breed  And heifers 'midst the neighbouring pastures feed  Meanwhile with flowrets deck'd each blithesome pair  Have bid adieu to pine and care  See them hand in hand advance  Circling in the smoothpac'd dance  Now to numbers quaint they stray  Bounding on the mazy way  The goldfinch and the linnet nigh  Join the simple minstrelsy  The simple notes and merry gambols fire  Plac'd by the hawthornhedge each antient fire  But see where Solitude of sober mien  With Health and Modesty her charming maids  Leaving the strawroof'd neighbourhood is seen  To rove beneath the venerable shades  O harmless cottages O happy glades  Where no misfortunes factious rage deplore  No discontent the quiet breast invades  How pleasant 'tis from this farseason'd shore  To hear the tumbling Ocean's wavy roar  Now whither with the sunbeam's darting speed  Thy rapt enthusiast Fancy wilt thou lead  What other scenes of more sincere delight  The goddess and her guest invite  She like the Sybil with the golden bough  Descends to search the sacred realms below  In amaranthine bowers the blest appear  By pearly grot or fountain clear  To heroes ghosts or scepter'd kings  The laurell'd bard divinely sings  Hark the animating strains  Warble thro' th' Elysian plains  When the pause admits delay  Thus th' immortals seem to say  Closing the accents of each tuneful voice  " For ever thus for ever we rejoice"  What sad transition means this rising show  To drive out real pain with fancied woe  I see the mourners in the darken'd room  The rustic hearse the letter'd tomb  Still still the wayward wild ideas take  The solemn livery of Death and wake  Tendereyed Pity as the villagetrain  The shrouded husbandman sustain  What semblances of wretched plight  'Mid the procession strike the sight  Ah 'tis Grief herself appears  Her flowing tresses steep'd in tears  Her garments torn her bosom bare  Reckless of th' inclement air  Three orphan children mark their mother's moan  Hang down their heads and answer groan for groan  Hence hence ye hapless images away  Delusive Fancy with thy subtle heat  No more thy vain machinery display  Now the dank grave and now the green retreat  Contentment's truth surpasses thy deceit  Sister of Wisdom she of aspect mild  Who makes the golden mean her certain seat  And looks on Casualty as Nature's child  To heaven's behests still nobly reconcil'd  ODE III AFTER THE THIRD ACT ON TRUE GREATNESS  LET who will climb the towery steep  Of sovereignty with slippery strides  Where on the bosom of the deep  Below the pitchy pinnace rides  A death's head flag unfurl'd to view  Waves ghastly and a sable crew  Gaze from the deck and seem to wait  Dash'd down the pointed rocks the rash unfortunate  Mine be the low and level way  Amid the quiet vale to stray  Safe in some sylvan lodge to dwell  And lull'd by the clear stream that speeds  By shallow fords to rustling reeds  And small lakes fring'd with homely asphodel  There sits the calm the rural sage  With Nature's volume fair in view  And meditates the shining page  Replete with wonders ever new  While wisdom points on either hand  Where plants and herbs and flowrets stand  In emerald groves and shadowy glades  In furzy moors or muskysmelling meads  Truth in her liquid glass serene  To him explains each moral scene  Oft in the downward skies a train  Of tinsel insects he surveys  Or glowworm with fallacious blaze  Just emblem of court greatness frail and vain  Oft in his woodland walk he stops to mark  The spirited and youthful lark  Warn'd by the dawning in the dappled east  Lift his melodious flight thro' upper air  Late the low tenant of the rushy nest  Now sings unrival'd in his radiant sphere  The pondering hermit then sees Merit roam  Above the nurslings of the courtly dome  On Glory's sparkling wheels rais'd from its humble home  First of the families of fame  That Rome's imperial city grace  From rural huts and hamlets came  The Fabian and Fabrician race  With that firm Judge that could contemn  And banish the proud diadem  To Sabine fields she owes the vine  Whose tendrils yet round Virtue's column twine  Which braves Oppression's wintry breath  And stands the icy touch of Death  The leafless stock that Fortune dooms  To wither with returning Spring  While the glad flocks of Freedom sing  Profuse of promis'd sweets with double vigour blooms  Hark hark 'tis Brutus' name I hear  Join'd with his fair heroic bride  To Honour's hallow'd fane they steer  Along the favourable tide  To her and Safety there to place  The tablet vow'd to human race  Blow every kind and gentle gale  Of gratitude and fan the swelling sail  High on a fleecy couch reclin'd  Of white and amber clouds combin'd  Rome's genius lifts his august head  Now slow descending nearer draws  Hail'd with the popular applause  And bids the solemn pageantry proceed  Go the triumphal ornaments display  Ye sacred Salii lead the way  Next led the order of Patrician blood  In awful march a numerous train compose  And follow'd by the jubilating crowd  As Cybelé thro' Phrygian cities goes  Majestic and with golden turrets crown'd  A hundred gods her gorgeous car surround  A thousand tongues acclaim the clanging cymbals sound  ODE IV AFTER THE FOURTH ACT TO CONCORD  SOul of the world first Mover say  From thee what glorious being came  Powerful to raise this universal frame  Who taught the ponderous wheels to play  Gave Beauty to look forth with radiant eyes  And cloath'd with ambient Day the crystal skies  'Twas Concord who enthron'd above  With sevenfold adamantine chains  The path of wandering orbs restrains  Kindles the genial fire of love  And walks the courts of genuine light  While all heaven hails the wonders of her sight▪  Where Bliss has banish'd Chance and sore Annoy  And Goodness fills the cup of general Joy  Nor is she to the Heavens confin'd  Forth on the Morning's wings she rides  She skims the glowing Evening's purple tides  And leaves the setting Sun behind  Where doves sit cooing at the noontide hour  And linnets warble in the woodbine bower  Where the pale moon her lustre spreads  The lovelorn bird divides her song  The soft flute soothes the rural throng  And dewdrops load the flowrets' heads  Where the ingenuous Chorus sings  The delicate touch flies o'er the trembling strings  From the gilt roof the symphony rebounds  Thine Goddess are the charms and thine the silv  sounds  The buxom air the saphire main  All height and depth confess thy gracious reign  But chief is thy delight to dwell  Lodg'd in the human breast thy dearest cell  Favour and friendship meet thee there  And tender Transport with the gushing tear  There Wedlock at thy altar bends  There halcyon Peace securely broods  And meek Tranquillity attends  To quell unruly Rage and sooth the swelling floods  Now by the magic of thy tongue  That call'd up first the rolling spheres  Thro' the gay circle of revolving years  With rapturous sounds of mystic song  Attun'd in heavenly harmony to run  And by the virtue of th' enchanting zone  Which when the fair Idalian queen  Accepts with universal sway  The Smiles and winning Passions play  In her resistless look and mien  The Loves thy heavenly gift admire  And tip their little darts with lambent fire  Fresh wreaths the Graces bring and form the round  Where rising daisies mark the measur'd ground  Now by the rosy mildness sweet  Of which when youthful Spring awakes  From thy abundance amply she partakes  What time the silkplum'd Zephyrs meet  In Saba's groves to kiss the bending blooms  With balmy lips and wanton in perfumes  And by the ripened redolent grace  When Summer in the Persian fields  To soberseeming Autumn yields  Her treasures on the loaded sprays  The skyrob'd plum the purple vine  The velvet peach and damask nectarine  While Plenty waving her Hesperian bough  Gladdens Pomona with the golden show  Great Goddess with the words of Peace  Bid this wild Uproar of Contention cease  Bid Amity with gentle ray  The woes that lowr on Faction's brow display  Shall Rome to thee a rebel prove  For hellish Hate abandon heavenly Love  Here gentle Concord on each breast  Let thy springsweetness bland distill  Here thy ambrosial fragrance rest  And all mankind obey thy sovereign will  MELPOMENE AN ODE  QUeen of the human heart at whose command  The swelling tides of mighty Passion rise  Melpomene support my venturous hand  And aid thy suppliant in his bold emprise  From the gay scenes of pride  Do thou his footsteps guide  To Nature's aweful courts where nurst of yore  Young Shakespear Fancy's child was taught his various lore  So may his favour'd eye explore the source  To few reveal'd whence human sorrows charm  So may his numbers with pathetic force  Bid Terror shake us or Compassion warm  As different strains controul  The movements of the soul  Adjust its passions harmonize its tone  To feel for others' woe or nobly bear its own  Deep in the covert of a shadowy grove  Mid broken rocks where dashing currents play  Dear to the pensive pleasures dear to love  And Damon's muse that breathes her melting lay  This ardent prayer was made  When lo the secret shade  As conscious of some heavenly presence shook  Strength firmness reason allmy astonish'd soul forsook  Ah whither Goddess whither am I borne  To what wild region's necromantic shore  These panics whence and why my bosom torn  With sudden terrors never felt before  Darkness inwraps me round  While from the vast profound  Emerging spectres dreadful shapes assume  And gleaming on my sight add horror to the gloom  Ha what is he whose fierce indignant eye  Denouncing vengeance kindles into flame  Whose boisterous fury blows a storm so high  As with its thunder shakes his labouring frame  What can such rage provoke  His words their passage choak  His eager steps nor time nor truce allow  And dreadful dangers wait the menace of his brow  Protect me Goddess whence that fearful shriek  Of consternation as grim Death had laid  His icy fingers on some guilty cheek  And all the powers of manhood shrunk dismay'd  Ah see besmear'd with gore  Revenge stands threatening o'er  A pale delinquent whose retorted eyes  In vain for pity callthe wretched victim dies  Not long the spaceabandon'd to Despair  With eyes aghast or hopeless fixt on earth  This slave of passion rends his scatter'd hair  Beats his sad breast and execrates his birth  While torn within he feels  The pangs of whips and wheels  And sees or fancies all the fiends below  Beckoning his frighted soul to realms of endless woe  Before my wondering sense new phantoms dance  And stamp their horrid shapes upon my brain  A wretch with jealous brow and eyes askance  Feeds all in secret on his bosom pain  Fond love fierce hate assail  Alternate they prevail  While conscious pride and shame with rage conspire  And urge the latent spark to flames of torturing fire  The storm proceedshis changeful visage trace  From rage to madness every feature breaks  A growing phrenzy grins upon his face  And in his frightful stare Distraction speaks  His strawinvested head  Proclaims all reason fled  And not a tear bedews those vacant eyes  But songs and shouts succeed and laughtermingled sighs  Yet yet againa Murderer's hand appears  Grasping a pointed dagger stain'd with blood  His look malignant chills with boding fears  That check the current of life's ebbing flood  In midnight's darkest clouds  The dreary miscreant shrouds  His felon stepas 'twere to darkness given  To dim the watchful eye of allpervading Heaven  And hark ah Mercy whence that hollow sound  Why with strange horror starts my bristling hair  Earth opens wide and from unhallow'd ground  A pallid Ghost slowrising steals on air  To where a mangled corse  Expos'd without remorse  Lies shroudless unentomb'd he points the way  Points to the prowling wolf exultant o'er his prey  " Was it for this he cries with kindly shower  " Of daily gifts the traytor I caress'd  " For this array'd him in the robe of power  " And lodg'd my royal secrets in his breast  " O kindness ill repay'd  " To bare the murdering blade  " Against my lifemay Heaven his guilt explore  " And to my suffering race their splendid rights restore"  He said and stalk'd awayAh Goddess cease  Thus with terrific forms to rack my brain  These horrid phantoms shake the throne of peace  And Reason calls her boasted powers in vain  Then change thy magic wand  Thy dreadful troops disband  And gentler shapes and softer scenes disclose  To melt the feeling heart yet sooth its tenderest woes  The fervent prayer was heardWith hideous sound  Her ebon gates of darkness open flew  A dawning twilight cheers the dread profound  The train of terror vanishes from view  More mild enchantments rise  New scenes salute my eyes  Groves fountains bowers and temples grace the plain  And turtles coo around and nightingales complain  And every myrtle bower and cypress grove  And every solemn temple teems with life  Here glows the scene with fond but hapless love  There with the deeper woes of human strife  In groups around the lawn  By fresh disasters drawn  The sad spectators seem transfix'd in woe  And pitying sighs are heard and heartfelt sorrows flow  Behold that beauteous maid her languid head  Bends like a drooping lilly charg'd with rain  With floods of tears she bathes a Lover dead  In brave assertion of her honour slain  Her bosom heaves with sighs  To Heaven she lifts her eyes  With grief beyond the power of words opprest  Sinks on the lifeless corse and dies upon his breast  How strong the bands of Friendship yet alas  Behind yon mouldering tower with ivy crown'd  Of two the foremost in her sacred class  One from his friend receives the fatal wound  What could such fury move  What but illfated love  The same fair object each fond heart enthralls  And he the favour'd youth her hapless victim falls  Can aught so deeply sway the generous mind  To mutual truth as female trust in love  Then what relief shall yon fair mourner find  Scorn'd by the man who should her plaints remove  By fair but false pretence  She lost her innocence  And that sweet babe the fruit of treacherous art  Claspt in her arms expires and breaks the parent's heart  Ah who to pomp or grandeur would aspire  Kings are not rais'd above misfortune's frown  That form so graceful even in mean attire  Sway'd once a sceptre once sustain'd a crown  From filial rage and strife  To screen his closing life  He quits his throne a father's sorrow feels  And in the lap of Want his patient head conceals  More yet remain'dbut lo the pensive Queen  Appears confest before my dazzled sight  Grace in her steps and softness in her mien  The face of sorrow mingled with delight  Not such her nobler frame  When kindling into flame  And bold in Virtue's cause her zeal aspires  To waken guilty pangs or breathe heroic fires  Aw'd into silence my rapt soul attends  The Power with eyes complacent saw my fear  And as with grace ineffable she bends  These accents vibrate on my listening ear  " Aspiring son of art  " Know tho' thy feeling heart  " Glow with these wonders to thy fancy shown  " Still may the Delian God thy powerless toils disown  " A thousand tender scenes of soft distress  " May swell thy breast with sympathetic woes  " A thousand such dread forms on fancy press  " As from my dreary realms of darkness rose  " Whence Shakespear's chilling fears  " And Otway's melting tears  " That aweful gloom this melancholy plain  " The types of every theme that suits the tragic strain  " But dost thou worship Nature night and morn  " And all due honour to her precepts pay  " Canst thou the lure of Affectation scorn  " Pleas'd in the simpler path of Truth to stray  " Hast thou the Graces fair  " Invok'd with ardent prayer  " They must attire as Nature must impart  " The sentiment sublime the language of the heart  " Then if assenting Genius pour his ray  " Warm with inspiring influence on thy breast  " Taste judgment fancy if thou canst display  " And the deep source of Passion stand confest  " Then may the listening train  " Affected feel thy strain  " Feel Grief or Terror Rage or Pity move  " Change with thy varying scenes and every scene approve"  Humbled before her sight and bending low  I kiss'd the borders of her crimson vest  Eager to speak I felt my bosom glow  But Fear upon my lips her seal imprest  While awestruck thus I stood  The bowers the lawn the wood  The Form celestial fading on my view  Dissolv'd in liquid air and all the vision flew  TWO ODES  ODE I TO OBSCURITY  DAughter of Chaos and old Night  Cimmerian muse all hail  That wrapt in nevertwinkling gloom canst write  And shadowest meaning with thy dusky veil  What Poet sings and strikes the strings  It was the mighty Theban spoke  He from the everliving lyre  With magic hand elicits fire  Heard ye the din of modern Rhimers bray  It was cool Mn or warm Gy  Involv'd in tenfold smoke  The shallow Fop in antic vest  Tir'd of the beaten road  Proud to be singularly drest  Changes with every changing moon the mode  Say shall not then the heavenborn Muses too  Variety persue  Shall not applauding Critics hail the vogue  Whether the Muse the stile of Cambria's sons  Or the rude gabble of the Huns  Or the broader dialect  Of Caledonia she affect  Or take Hibernia thy still ranker brogue  On this terrestrial ball  The tyrant Fashion governs all  She fickle Goddess whom in days of yore  The Idiot Moria on the banks of Seine  Unto an antic fool hight Andrew bore  Long she paid him with disdain  And long his pangs in silence he conceal'd  At length in happy hour his lovesick pain  On thy blest Calends April he reveal'd  From their embraces sprung  Ever changing ever ranging  Fashion Goddess ever young  Perch'd on the dubious height she loves to ride  Upon a weathercock astride  Each blast that blows around she goes  While nodding o'er her crest  Emblem of her magic power  The light Cameleon stands confest  Changing its hues a thousand times an hour  And in a vest is she array'd  Of many a dancing moonbeam made  Nor zoneless is her waist  But fair and beautiful I ween  As the cestoscinctur'd Queen  Is with the Rainbow's shadowy girdle brac'd  She bids pursue the favourite road  Of losty cloudcapt Ode  Meantime each Bard with eager speed  Vaults on the Pegasean steed  Yet not that Pegasus of yore  Which th' illustrious Pindar bore  But one of nobler breed  High blood and youth his lusty veins inspire  From Tottipontimoy he came  Who knows not Tottipontimoy thy name  The Bloodyshoulder'd Arab was his Sire  The Author is either mistaken in this place or has else indulged himself in a very unwarrantable poetical licence Whitenose was not the Sire but a Son of the Godolphin Arabian See my Calendar HEBER  His Whitenose He on fam'd Doncastria's plains  Resign'd his fated breath  In vain for life the struggling courser strains  Ah who can run the race with death  The tyrant's speed or man or steed  Strives all in vain to fly  He leads the chace he wins the race  We stumble fall and die  Third from Whitenose springs  Pegasus with eagle wings  Light o'er the plain as dancing cork  With many a bound he beats the ground  While all the Turf with acclamation rings  He won Northampton Lincoln Oxford York  He too Newmarket won  There Granta's Son  Seiz'd on the Steed  And thence him led so fate decreed  To where old Cam renown'd in poet's song  With his dark and inky waves  Either bank in silence laves  Winding slow his sluggish streams along  What stripling neat of visage sweet  In trimmest guise array'd  First the neighing steed assay'd  His hand a taper switch adorns his heel  Sparkles refulgent with elastic steel  The whiles he wins his whiffling way  Prancing ambling round and round  By hill and dale and mead and greenswerd gay  'Till sated with the pleasing ride  From the lofty Steed dismounting  He lies along enwrapt in conscious pride  By gurgling rill or crystal fountain  Lo next a Bard secure of praise  His selfcomplacent countenance displays  His broad mustachios ting'd with golden die  Flame like a meteor to the troubled air  Proud his demeanor and his eagle eye  O'erhung with lavish lid yet shone with glorious glare  The grizzle grace  Of bushy Peruke shadow'd o'er his face  In large wide boots whose ponderous weight  Would sink each wight of modern date  He rides wellpleas'd So large a pair  Not Garagantua's self might wear  Not He of nature fierce and cruel  Who if we trust to antient Ballad  Devour'd three pilgrims in a sallad  Nor He of fame germane hight Pantagruel  Accoutred thus th' adventurous Youth  Seeks not the level lawn or velvet mead  Fast by whose side clear streams meandring creep  But urges on amain the fiery steed  Up Snowdon's shaggy side or Cambrian rock uncouth  Where the venerable herd  Of goats with long and sapient beard  And wanton kidlings their blithe revels keep  Now up the mountain see him strain  Now down the vale he's tost  Now flashes on the sight again  Now in the Palpable Obscure quite lost  Man's feeble race eternal dangers wait  With high or low all all is woe  Disease mischance pale fear and dubious fate  But o'er every peril bounding  Ambition views not all the ills surrounding  And tiptoe on the mountain's steep  Reflects not on the yawning deep  See see he soars with mighty wings outspread  And long resounding mane  The courser quits the plain  Aloft in air see see him bear  The Bard who shrouds  His lyric glory in the clouds  Too fond to strike the stars with lofty head  He topples headlong from the giddy height  Deep in the Cambrian gulph immerg'd in endless night  O steed divine what daring spirit  Rides thee now tho' he inherit  Nor the pride nor selfopinion  Which elate the mighty Pair  Each of Taste the favourite minion  Prancing thro' the desert air  By help mechanic of equestrian block  Yet shall he mount with classic housing grac'd  And all unheedful of the Critic mock  Drive his light courser o'er the bounds of Taste  ODE II TO OBLIVION  According to Lillaeus who bestows the Parental Function on Oblivion  Verba Obliviscendi regunt Genitivum  LIB XIII CAP VIII  There is a similar passage in Busbaeus  PArent of Ease Oblivion old  Who lov'st thy dwellingplace to hold  Where sceptred Pluto keeps his dreary sway  Whose sullen pride the shivering ghosts obey  Thou who delightest still to dwell  By some hoar and mossgrown cell  At whose dank foot Cocytus joys to roll  Or Styx' black streams which even Jove controul  Or if it suit thy better will  To chuse the tinkling weeping rill  Hard by whose side the seeded poppy red  Heaves high in air his sweetly curling head  While creeping in meanders slow  Lethe's drowzy waters flow  And hollow blasts which never cease to sigh  Hum to each carestruck mind their lullalullaby  A prey no longer let me be  To that gossip Memory  Who waves her banners trim and proudly flies  To spread abroad her bribblebrabble lies  With thee Oblivion let me go  For Memory's a friend to Woe  With thee Forgetfulness fair silent Queen  The solemn stole of grief is never seen  All all is thine Thy powerful sway  The throng'd poetic hosts obey  Tho' in the van of Memory proud t' appear  At thy command they darken in the rear  What tho' the modern Tragic strain  For nine whole days protract thy reign  Yet thro' the Nine like whelps of currish kind  Scarcely it lives weak impotent and blind  Sacred to thee the Crambo Rhime  The motley forms of Pantomime  For thee from Eunuch's throat still loves to flow  The soothing sadness of his warbled woe  Each day to thee falls Pamphlet clean  Each month a newborn Magazine  Hear then O Goddess hear thy votary's prayer  And if thou deign'st to take one moment's care  Attend thy Bard who duly pays  The tribute of his votive lays  Whose Muse still offers at thy sacred shrine  Thy Bard who calls Thee His and makes Him Thine  O sweet Forgetfulness supreme  Rule supine o'er every theme  O'er each sad subject o'er each soothing strain  Of mine O Goddess stretch thine awful reign  Nor let Memory steal one note  Which this rude hand to thee hath wrote  So shalt thou save me from the Poet's shame  Tho' on the letter'd Rubric Dodsley post my Name  O come with opiate poppies crown'd  Shedding slumbers soft around  O come fat Goddess drunk with Falstaff's sack  See where she sits on the benumb'd Torpedo's back  Me in thy dull Elysium lapt O bless  With thy calm Forgetfulness  And gently lull my senses all the while  With placid poems in the sinking stile  Whether the HerringPoet sing  Great Laureat of the Fishes' King  Or Lycophron prophetic rave his sill  Wrapt in the darker strains of Johnny Hill  Or if he sing whose verse affords  A bevy of the choicest words  Who meets his Lady Muse by mossgrown cell  Adorn'd with epithet and tinkling bell  These Goddess let me still forget  With all the dearth of Modern Wit  So may'st thou gently o'er my youthful breast  Spread with thy welcome hand Oblivion's friendly vest  THE SILENT LOVER  BY THE CELEBRATED SIR WALTER RAWLEIGH  PAssions are liken'd best to floods and streams  The shallow murmur but the deep are dumb  So when affections yield discourse it seems  The bottom is but shallow whence they come  They who are rich in words must needs discover  They are but poor in that which makes a lover  Wrong not sweet mistress of my heart  The merit of true passion  With thinking that he feels no smart  Who sues for no compassion  Since if my plaints were not t' approve  The conquest of thy beauty  It comes not from defect of love  But fear t' exceed my duty  For knowing that I sue to serve  A saint of such perfection  As all desire tho' none deserve  A place in her affection  I rather enuse to want relief  Than venture the revealing  When glory recommends the grief  Despair disdains the healing  Thus strong desires which boil so high  In any mortal lover  When Reason cannot bid them die  Discretion then should cover  Yet when discretion doth bereave  The plaints which I should utter  Your wise discretion should perceive  My silence is a suitor  Silence in love bewrays more woe  Than words tho' ne'er so witty  A beggar who is dumb you know  May challenge double pity  Then wrong not dearest of my heart  My love for secret passion  He smarteth most that hides his smart  And sues for no compassion  ON THE GREAT FOG IN LONDON  DECEMBER MDCCLXII  BY JEW  LOst and bewilder'd in the thickening mist  We stray amid th' irrefragable gloom  Nor can the penetrating lance of day  Bleed the thick vein behind a sizy cloud  The rays of light his orient messengers  Are intercepted nor can steer their course  Wreckt on a coast of jeteven beauty's eye  Compos'd of azure here is impotent  And allsubduing is itself subdued  We jostle each by vision unappriz'd  Of meeting till like vessels we run foul  And board each other in the sullen waste  This mockery of night like vanity  Conceals us from ourselves our shadows too  Lately our dear associates and compeers  Have like false lovers left us in the Fog  To seek our own identity in vain  Nature herself seems in the vapours now  Dim is the prospectshall we call it so  A purblind view next to invisible  Or rather darkness visible to sight  'Tis a black curtain drawn across the sky  Disgustful and shuts out the scenes of day  Or if a sunbeam glimmerlo the trees  As we approach 'em seem like hanging webs  Spun by the spidereven the great St Paul  With his huge dome and cupola appears  A craggy precipice rude uninform'd  Or like the ruins of an antient fort  Upon a hill when twilight shuts the day  The Morning like a widow all in weeds  Stalks forth incog unwilling to be known  Veil'd and disguis'd behind the mask of Night  Or if meridian Phoebus show his face  He seems a ball of molten copperore  Like a red beacon on a foggy coast  Absolute shade maintains despotic sway  Palpable darkness for we see by touch  If hearing not apprize us of approach  The coach or waggon by its rumbling warns  To shun the danger from our ears we see  The threatening wheels while often touch informs  When unawares we strike against a post  Like ships against a bank or sunken rock  For sight is useless in so drear a blank  The beams of day refracted in the cloud  Like birds in storms are dubious where to fly  And waste their radiance on the tawny air  When fable night appears in ebon car  The lamps are feeble like the socketsnuffs  Of tapers just expiring rushlights dim  Like dying wicks within a dreary vault  'Tis general mourning every colour fades  Even the fine roseat on the virgin's cheek  Turns to a livid blue and charms no more  The soldiers in the Park seem undertakers  While every coach or carriage like a hearse  Displays the pageant of a funeral pomp  Long streets of houses look like black perspectives  Of charcoal prospects the design of boys  While by no marks directed oft we miss  Our wellknown passageboats upon the Thames  Appear but as the buoys of distant ships  Or corks afloat upon the sullen flood  ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE HORSE  BY THE SAME  DEath is a common fortune sure to all  The horse the jocky and the 'squire must fall  Bucephalus himself some ages since  Has shar'd that fortune with his warlike prince  Immortal Caesar bow'd beneath the stroke  And Death fell'd Milo as he tore the oak  Shall Rozinante's memory still survive  By drole Cervantes' humour kept alive  Shall Hudibras's steed by Butler's pen  Immortal reign amid the tongues of men  And shall not Forrester demand a line  To lodge his glories with the tuneful Nine  He shall not want a verse if Phoebus' beam  Inspire the bard and animate his theme  What tho' Dan Ovid deathless honours won  And drove the flaming coursers of the sun  Tho' Rhesus stole the orient steeds of day  When thro' the hostile ranks he made his way  Yet not the horses of the sun shall vie  Or damp the spirit of our elegy  Not Pacolet who journey'd thro' the air  In old romance shall brighter glories share  Nor he hight Pegasus whom poets sung  From whose fam'd hoof sweet Hippocrené sprung  Fabled or real not a horse shall claim  Than Forrester a more exalted name  Raise to his shade the monumental bust  And sing a requiem to his silent dust  His form the mimic pencil set at nought  His chest with grace inimitable fraught  Braided with lightning flow'd his silver mane  He snufft impatient of the shining rein  Without a rider if he heard the hounds  Like thought o'er every obstacle he bounds  Impetuous see his pamper'd sides rejoice  If he but hear the wellknown clarion's voice  The battle dreads himand he seems alone  A mounted troopa cavalry in one  The whistling balls gave rapture to his ears  Elate the thunder of the train he hears  Froth'd is the golden bithe champs he rears  Swift in the flood of war he bathes his sides  He mocks the danger and the foe derides  Oft at Newmarket was his speed display'd  While others ran he fled across the glade  The eye in vain pursued him to the post  The chasm was fill'd the space between was lost  Beyond conception was his mighty power  Whose easy trot was sixteen miles an hour  But what avail his beauty speed or size  On the cold sod a lifeless lump he lies  No more alas to grace his rider's form  And dauntless bear him thro' the battle's storm  Raise to his shade the monumental bust  And sing a parting requiem to his dust  ANACREON ODE I IMITATED  OF trumpets drums guns and the bold bloody battle  My highsounding music most loudly should rattle  But alas my poor fiddle too weak would it prove  And can play to no tune but the soft tunes of love  T'other day with new catgut my fiddle I strung  Then "Britons strike home" most heroicly sung  To squeeze out high notes tho' my fiddlestick strove  My fiddle still tweedled and tweedled of love  A scraper from beauty no more will I rove  But tune up my fiddle to sonnets of love  VERSES ADDRESSED TO THE REV MR NOW BISHOP WARBURTON OCCASIONED BY READING HIS SERMONS  The lips of the wise disperse knowledge  SOLOMON  LET Rome on man God's image to deface  Still deem stupidity a mark of grace  On ignorance build what monks devotion name  Her faith impiety her glory shame  While priest and people ghostly commerce hold  And pious frauds exchange for sinful gold  May Truth's divine invariable ray  Still bless our isle with intellectual day  Here still let wisdom at each temple wait  Trace all our streets and knock at every gate  Still keep us sacred as her last retreat  From fools much cheated and from knaves who cheat  Still teach thy hands to build a blest employ  On knowledge virtue and on virtue joy  On Reason's base to bid Religion rise  'Till the tall pile shall end within the skies  GOD IS LOVE  THou at whose touch the snowclad mountains smoke  Eternal wisdom touch my lips prophane  O touch my heart my heart tho' cold shall glow  My lips breathe eloquence divine for not  Of earth in earthborn strains I mean to sing  Adventurous but of thee thy love alone  Thy wisdom knows thy love my awful theme  Let me not err low grovelling in the dust  Let me not fall high towering in the sky  O where shall I begin how trace the source  Of all how fathom vast immensity  Long as the God has been who ne'er began  Trac'd back and backward still but trac'd in vain  Love has so long existed God is Love  Who name him other know not yet his name  And if they seek him lost in error's gloom  Or superstition's labyrinth find him not  Whate'er the glimmering lamp of reason show'd  Of God thro' pagan darkness all was love  Whate'er the bright effulgence of thy Son  Blest revelation has display'd all still  Is love this pendent world those rolling orbs  Nature's whole system speaks its Maker kind  The varied fruits and flowers the pleasing change  Of day and night the painted landscape round  Of hill and dale clear fountain shady wood  The glittering dew of morn the crimson'd cloud  Of evening mild the sweetly varied song  The peopled earth and air and sea all parts  Of one stupendous whole and fram'd for bliss  Proclaim him goodLord of this blest domain  Not male alone but male and female

test of skill divine  Thrice happy pairto late degenerate times  Your morn and evening song had some blest bard  Transmitted fair in strains by heaven inspir'd  These had the gloomy bigot read abash'd  And own'd that God is Love But man alas  Fell from the perfect beauty pure desire  Fell to deformity and age and death  And hate and envy violence and guilt  He fell yet unremitted goodness spoke  To man apostate as he was the words  Of peace gave misery hope and show'd above  A brighter paradise than Eden's groves  His portion when the Woman's promis'd Seed  Should bruise the serpent's head amazing grace  The promis'd Seed was given the fullness then  Of Godhead dwelt in flesh high heaven itself  No more contains th' astonishment and joy  But down its radiant hosts impatient pour  And Peace proclaim on earth Good Will to man  Oh join the transports of th' angelic choir  And sing responding to the hallow'd strain  To God be GloryBut tremendous scene  Whom do I see in yon drear waste

Saviour groans and dies  Oh let me bending to the dust dissolve  In silent admiration let my soul  Attest in unexpressive thought that God  Is Love and dare I dare a groveling worm  Rejoice in scenes

ON THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL'S PASSAGE OUT OF EGYPT  WHen Egypt's king God's chosen tribes pursued  In crystal walls th' admiring waters stood  When thro' the desert wild they took their way  The rocks relented and pour'd forth a sea  What limits can Almighty goodness know  Since seas can harden and since rocks can flow  ELEGY  'TIS fate commandsreluctant I depart  Adieu ye scenes where powerful beauty reigns  Where Delia dwells the mistress of my heart  Delia the glory of Silurian plains  From her I part for seven long months at least  And bid at once to her and joy farewell  Adieu thou peaceful sunshine of the breast  That deign'd while Delia near with me to dwell  Ah me what woes in absence lovers prove  Some happier youth may boldly speak his care  May strive to win my Delia's soul to love  And she perchance may lend a listening ear  Fool that I was still silent to abide  Yet eloquence itself were vain I fear  Since I've no other charms defects to hide  Nor aught to boast of but that I'm sincere  Oh had sincerity suffic'd alone  Alone o'er lovely Delia to prevail  Boldly ere now my passion I had shown  And she with tenderness had heard my tale  With her perchance where Wye's clear waters roll  Along the flowery mead I might have stray'd  From her perchance some pleasing grace have stole  And learn'd perfection from my lovely maid  Did she in absence know how I'm distress'd  In absence know what pangs for her I prove  For her how frequent sighs my bleeding breast  At least she'd pity if she cannot love  While round the board the sparkling bumpers pass  And cheerful friends demand a toast from me  I to some other nymph fill up the glass  But while I drink it Delia think on thee  Come Daphnis give a social song they cry  To speed with mirth the evening hours away  In vain I with their wishes would comply  To plaintive notes I sing some lovesick lay  Yet oft I shun those friends whom most I prize  My taste for mirth and conversation gone  Even the quaint joke and wit I now despise  And love to wander pensively alone  When the chaste moon her silver beams displays  To hear the distant waters roll along  I stray to hear the cattle wandering graze  And give attention to the nightbird's song  Awhile the stranger sleep my eyelid flies  At length the loiterer to return will deign  Silent he steals upon my wearied eyes  Then fancy holds her visionary reign  She paints my Delia overwhelm'd with woes  And me she arms to guard my lovely maid  Numbers she makes my single arm oppose  Then shows her render'd happy by my aid  Then brings she milder scenes of soft delight  My Delia's form before me stands confess'd  Bland look her glossy eyes with lustre bright  Her dark hair flowing on her snowy breast  With Delia's sweetness makes she Delia speak  " Daphnis what anxious care thy bosom moves"  To her my passion I all fearful break  She hears attends me and with smiles approves  Now from the east breaks forth the greyey'd morn  On night's departing wings the vision flies  The bitter woes of absence now return  And tears stand trembling in my cheated eyes  Come then sweet Hope in youthful smiles appear  Oh make slowlingering time more swiftly move  Fortune is old and Age with looks severe  Frowns at the name of lover and of love  ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN  SAY for my theme what numbers shall I chuse  Shall I to Pindar's flights aspire  And imitate his heavenly fire  Of smoother verses write  And some soft elegy indite  To Pindar's flights aspire my muse  Unfetter'd there unbounded may'st thou rove  There best express thy grief and love  There no scant limits know  But in free torrents flow  Free as thy tears and boundless as thy woe  Must then the Grave insatiate reign  Must Fate this too tyrannic sway maintain  And must the learn'd the good the young  Be the sad subject of a funeral song  Now Death we find can never spare  Since he hath snatch'd this youth away  Since he can thus our bliss annoy  And so much harmony destroy  For sure all harmony dwelt there  In that fair piece of animated clay  Nature had exquisitely form'd each part  Resolv'd at last to conquer Art  She labour'd every member to refine  And made each feature seem divine  Yet did her want of strength betray  It was too fine to last and hasten'd to decay  Nor was his soul illsuited with his face  Each virtue flourish'd there and every grace  Yet more than all humility took place  His virtue and his pleasing air  Rais'd joy and wonder in the fair  These charms he learn'd with music to improve  Music the food of love  When Orpheus to the forests took his way  Touch'd his mute lyre and wak'd the sleeping lay  The savages came crouding round  And listening oaks admir'd the tuneful sound  This youth a harder task perform'd  Whene'er he play'd each icy breast he warm'd  While o'er the strings his flying fingers rove  Each heart kept time and every pulse beat love  Tho' blest with all these charms he breathless lies  Here draw a veil my Musethen see him rise  An infant star just lighted in the skies  There David and Cecilia meet  The newborn Saint with joy they greet  His coming and his strains improve  Teach his already welltaught lyre  A note yet higher  To sing the mighty source of power and love  There does he praises sing  To heaven's eternal King  There tunes to melody his harp so well  That angels only can his notes excell  ON ADMIRAL BYNG'S RETURN FROM MINORCA MDCCLVI  BRitons what unaton'd offence  Haunts your unprosperous race  See him you sent with honours hence  Returning with disgrace  Methinks upon the vessel's side  I see your prisoner stand  Cursing both winds and bark and tide  That bear him to the land  " This heart he cries these horrors show  " The weakness of my cause  " Who fears to meet his country's foe  " Must tremble at her laws  " Then with what face shall I appear  " Before her judgmentseat  " Even now they shout around my bier  " That flames in every street  " At my approach yon paly shore  " Would change its white to red  " And that high cliff come whelming o'er  " On this degenerate head  " My king I tremble at the name  " Tho' mercy guides his throne  " Must punish for his people's shame  " But scorns me for my own  " The eyes that wept when Maclean died  " Smile at my sentence past  " Tho' by a matronjury tried  " By their decree I'm cast  " Like Abdiel 'midst corruption sound  " See mangled Noel stands  " Lo Andrews shows his deadly wound  " And blood for blood demands  " See Blakeney with a scornful frown  " Points to the secret port  " There bids me set my succours down  " And save the wasting fort  " Blakeney to that important pass  " Too well I knew to steer  " But neither I nor they alas  " Had hearts to venture near  " Ha do I wake or are my eyes  " By their own fears betray'd  " See yon pale angry spectre rise  " My father's awful shade  " Shame to my blood I shake I swoon  " I die upon the sight  " O sink my bark sink instant down  " And bury me in night"  This said he twice essay'd to leap  Twice left the vessel's side  The third time in the frowning deep  He plung'd he sunk he died  A PRAYER FOR INDIFFERENCE  BY MRS G  OFT I've implor'd the gods in vain  And pray'd till I've been weary  For once I'll try my wish to gain  Of Oberon the Fairy  Sweet airy being wanton sprite  That liv'st in woods unseen  And oft by Cynthia's silver light  Tripst gaily o'er the green  If ere thy pitying heart was mov'd  As antient stories tell  And for th' Athenian maid who lov'd  Thou sought'st a wondrous spell  O deign once more t' exert thy power  Haply some herb or tree  Sovereign as juice from western flower  Conceals a balm for me  I ask no kind return in love  No tempting charm to please  Far from the heart such gifts remove  That sighs for peace and ease  Nor ease nor peace that heart can know  That like the needle true  Turns at the touch of joy or woe  But turning trembles too  Far as distress the soul can wound  'Tis pain in each degree  Bliss goes but to a certain bound  Beyond is agony  Then take this treacherous sense of mind  Which dooms me still to smart  Which pleasure can to pain refine  To pain new pangs impart  O haste to shed the sovereign balm  My shatter'd nerves newstring  And for my guest supremely calm  The nymph Indifference bring  At her approach see Hope see Fear  See Expectation fly  With Disappointment in the rear  That blasts the promis'd joy  The tears which pity taught to flow  My eyes shall then disown  The heart that throbb'd at others woe  Shall then scarce feel its own  The wounds which now each moment bleed  Each moment then shall close  And peaceful days shall still succeed  To nights of sweet repose  O fairy elf but grant me this  This one kind comfort send  And so may neverfading bliss  Thy flowery paths attend  So may the glowworm's glimmering light  Thy tiny footsteps lead  To some new region of delight  Unknown to mortal tread  And be thy acorn goblets fill'd  With heaven's ambrosial dew  From sweetest freshest flowers distill'd  That shed fresh sweets for you  And what of life remains for me  I'll pass in sober ease  Halfpleas'd contented

wonder of a day  Ere the last convulsive start  Rend thy unresisting heart  Ere the long enduring swoon  Weigh thy precious eyelids down  Ah regard a mother's moan  Anguish deeper than thy own  Fairest eyes whose dawning light  Late with rapture blest my sight  Ere your orbs extinguish'd be  Bend your trembling beams on me  Drooping sweetness verdant flower  Blooming withering in an hour  Ere thy gentle breast sustains  Latest fiercest mortal pains  Hear a suppliant let me be  Partner in thy destiny  TO THE MEMORY OF VARO A PHYSICIAN THE AUTHOR'S UNCLE  BY THE SAME  HOW can the muse attempt the string  Forsaken by her guardian power  Ah me that she survives to sing  Her friend and patron now no more  Yet private grief she might suppress  Since Clio bears no selfish mind  But oh she mourns to wild excess  The friend and patron of mankind  Alas the sovereign healing art  Which rescued thousands from the grave  Unaided left the gentlest heart  Nor could its skilful master save  Who shall the helpless sex sustain  Now Varo's lenient hand is gone  Which knew so well to soften pain  And ward all dangers but his own  His darling muse his Clio dear  Whom first his favour rais'd to fame  His gentle voice vouchsaf'd to cheer  His art upheld her tender frame  Pale envy durst not show her teeth  Above contempt she gaily shone  Chief favourite till the hand of death  Endanger'd both by striking one  Perceiving well devoid of fear  His latest fatal conflict nigh  Reclin'd on her he held most dear  Whose breast receiv'd his parting sigh  With every art and grace adorn'd  By man admir'd by heaven approv'd  Good Varo diedapplauded mourn'd  And honour'd by the muse he lov'd  TO THE MEMORY OF A SISTER  BY THE SAME  IF happy spirits are allow'd to know  And hover round what once they lov'd below  Maria gentlest excellence attend  To one who glories to have call'd thee friend  Remote in merit tho' allied in blood  Tho' worthless I and thou divinely good  Accept dear shade from me these artless lays  Who scorn unjustly or to blame or praise  How thy discreet economy outweigh'd  The finest wit in utmost pomp display'd  Let others sing while I attempt to paint  The glowing virtues of the friend and saint  With business and devotion never cloy'd  No moment of thy time past unemploy'd  Wellnatur'd mirth mature discretion join'd  Constant attendants on the virtuous mind  Ah me that heaven has from this bosom torn  The dearest friend whom I must ever mourn  Ere Stella could discharge the smallest part  Of what she ow'd to such immense desert  Or recompense with aught but empty praise  The sole companion of her joyless days  Pleasing thy face and form tho' heaven confin'd  To scanty limits thy extensive mind  Witness the taintless lustre of thy skin  Bright emblem of the brighter soul within  That soul which easy unaffected mild  Thro' jetty eyes with cheerful sweetness smil'd  But oh could fancy reach or language speak  The living beauties of thy lip and cheek  Where nature's pencil leaving art no room  Touch'd to a miracle the vernal bloom  To soundest prudence life's unerring guide  To love sincere religion void of pride  To friendship perfect in a female mind  Which I can never hope again to find  To mirth the balm of care from lightness free  To stedfast truth unwearied industry  To every charm and grace compris'd in you  Most worthy friend a long and last adieu  THE LUCID INTERVAL  BY THE SAME  WEar pleasure Stella on thy face  Nor check the rising joy  Nor canst thou since the heart displays  Its transport thro' the eye  These dearlywelcome hours of rest  This pleasing truce from care  Removes the mountain from thy breast  Thou hast not learnt to bear  Tho' distant far from what I love  My blooming hopes are crost  Yet free as air my thoughts may rove  In silent rapture lost  Then Stella prize thy present ease  This interval of woe  Since other moments blest as these  Thy life may never know  Snatch the fleet pleasures ere they part  Tomorrow should'st them say  Tho' pain may rend this tortur'd heart  Yet laugh and live today  A FAREWELL TO THE WORLD  BY THE SAME  WHile sickness rends this tenement of clay  Th'approaching change with rapture I survey  O'erjoy'd to reach the goal with eager pace  Ere my slow life has measur'd half its race  No longer shall I bear my friends to please  The hard constraint of seeming much at ease  Nor wear an outward smile a look serene  While piercing racks and tortures lurk within  Yet let me not ungrateful with regret  Record the evil and the good forget  For both I humble adoration pay  And bless the power who gives and takes away  Long shall my faithful memory retain  And oft recall each interval of pain  Nay to high heaven for greater gifts I bend  Health I've enjoy'd and I had once a friend  With pleasing toil I past the joyous day  And join'd at night the witty and the gay  Our labour sweet if labour it might seem  Allow'd the sportive and instructive theme  Yet here no lewd or useless wit was found  We pois'd the wavering sail with ballast sound  Wit mirth and music sciences and arts  Improv'd and exercis'd our nobler parts  Learning here plac'd her richer stores in view  Or wing'd with love the minutes gaily flew  True merit might unequall'd lustre wear  For envious base detraction came not there  Nay yet sublimer joys our bosoms prov'd  Divine benevolence by heaven belov'd  Wan meagre forms torn from impending death  Exulting blest us with reviving breath  The shivering wretch we cloth'd the mourner cheer'd  And sickness ceas'd to groan when we appear'd  Unask'd our care assists with tender art  Their bodies nor neglects th' immortal part  Sometimes in shades impierc'd by Cynthia's beam  Whose lustre glimmer'd on the dimpled stream  We led the sprightly dance thro' sylvan scenes  Or tript like fairies o'er the level greens  To join the dance our blooming partners haste  With love for ever pure for ever chaste  In every breast a generous fervour glows  Soft bliss which mutual love alone bestows  From fragrant herbage deck'd with pearly dews  And flowerets of a thousand various hues  By wafting gales the mingling odours fly  And round our heads in whispering breezes sigh  All nature seem'd to heighten and improve  The halcyon hours of innocence and love  Youth wit goodnature candor sense combin'd  To serve delight and civilize mankind  In wisdom's lore we every heart engage  And triumph to restore the golden age  Now close the blissful theme exhausted muse  The latest blissful theme that thou shalt chuse  Satiate with life what joys for me remain  Save one dear wish to ballance every pain  O'erwhelm'd with woes desperate and fatal all  On tardy death with ceaseless cries I call  So the tir'd babe whose waking hour is o'er  Whom glittering baubles can delight no more  Reclines its head with painful toil opprest  Till borne by friendly arms to welcome rest  THE PICTURE  BY THE SAME  HOW rare the piece where heaven and nature join  To frame a creature more than half divine  Tho' wit and beauty's mingled graces meet  Virtue and breeding must the work compleat  Mild unaffected softness let her wear  Gay without noife nor stray beyond her sphere  Tho rich in science and in arts refin'd  Yet truly feminate in form and mind  But since for safety and defence we own  Some male endowments should her virtues crown  Let dauntless fortitude and strength of soul  Preserve enoble and adorn the whole  AN EPITAPH ON HERSELF  BY THE SAME  DEstin'd while living to sustain  An equal share of grief and pain  All various ills of human race  Within this breast had once a place  Without complaint she learnt to bear  A living death a long despair  Till hard opprest by adverse fate  O'ercharg'd she sunk beneath its weight  And to this peaceful tomb retir'd  So much esteem'd so long desir'd  The painful mortal conflict o'er  A broken heart can bleed no more  THE HOURS OF LOVE  IN FOUR ELEGIES  NIGHT THE FIRST ELEGY  NOW Cynthia shone serene with silver light  And Silence reign'd sole monarch of the night  Now scarce a Zephyr fann'd the placid sky  But all was hush'dsave Philomel and I  Sweet tuneful bird who shun'st the noise of day  Darkling to chant thy melancholy lay  If it be love that makes thee loath repose  Then let me mingle sympathetic woes  But if thy mate regardless of thy pain  Still hears thee sing and hears thee sing in vain  How shall my ruder voice e'er hope to move  Or charm my gentle Delia into love  Here let me nightly wander in the grove  To court th' idea of my absent love  With fancy's eye to gaze upon her charms  And press the lovely phantom to my arms  Bring bring my Delia's image to my mind  And for a moment let me think her kind  Oh 'tis in vainimagination dies  The fancied Delia like the real flies  Oh I am sick oppress'd with tender grief  Bring gentle Love oh bring me soft relief  Quick on the wings of expectation fly  Oh help thy votary help me or I die  The night's far spent and soon the morn will rise  Come gentle sleep and seal these weeping eyes  Thou balm of nature sink into my breast  Shut every senseO lull my soul to rest  In soft repose the gentle Delia's laid  Sweet be the slumbers of the sleeping maid  Let no rude thought the peaceful charm destroy  But let her dream of love and dream of joy  Let some bright vision then my form assume  With charms delusive and etherial bloom  Then let the phantom kneel before the fair  And tell her how I love and how despair  For oh I think could gentle Delia know  But half my passion or but half my woe  She'd surely pity tho' she'd not approve  And tender pity is akin to love  MORNING THE SECOND ELEGY  WIsh'd morn is comea cheerful ray of light  Peeps thro' the sable curtains of the night  And now I hear the towering lark on high  Chant his glad mattins thro' the vocal sky  Sleepless I've toss'd the tedious night away  And wish'd impatient for the tardy day  What now avails the cheerful dawn of light  Wrapt in despair with me 'tis endless night  All nature seems refresh'd must only love  No kind repose no intermission prove  Even painful care is sometimes lull'd to sleep  Must love alone eternal vigils keep  At Delia's window I'll my station take  And sing of love till gentle Delia wake  In softest strain her slumbers I'll remove  And she shall wake to music and to love  O for Tibullus' voice for Hammond's lyre  To kindle rapture and excite desire  Then should she melt at every tender strain  And her heart sigh with sympathetic pain  This is her windowsweetest Delia rise  O lovely maid unveil thy radiant eyes  With one soft smile chase dark despair away  Arise my Delia smile and make it day  She hears me notregardless of my pain  Or if she hears she hears with cold disdain  On this bare earth for ever let me lie  Here let me languish here despair and die  But hark a noiseand now the window opes  'Tis Delia's self'tis she by all my hopes  Soft gracious smiles o'er every feature play  Bright as the radiance of the rising day  Hail beauteous nymph in native charms array'd  Thou need'st from gaudy dress no borrow'd aid  How sweet that loose attire that careless air  In artless negligence divinely fair  Come come my fair together let us stray  And taste the fragrance of the early day  So shall young Health the rosy child of Morn  With all his mother's bloom thy cheek adorn  Look look abroad behold 'tis break of day  See on yon lawn the tender lambkins play  Now every linnet sings in every grove  And laughing Nature charms the soul to love  She smiles assentdescend celestial maid  Come to my arms my love be not afraid  Thus let me press my kind consenting fair  Starting I wokeshe vanish'd into air  Oh 'twas a flattering dream too soon I found  Stretch'd at her door I slept upon the ground  Where Delia's form my busy fancy drew  Deck'd her in smiles then thought the vision true  Thus let me sleep oh thus for ever dream  Such heartfelt extasies must more than seem  Then like Endymion blest enraptur'd boy  I'll lie entranc'd in everlasting joy  NOON THE THIRD ELEGY  NOW Phoebus vertically shoots his rays  With all the fervor of his noontide blaze  Now let me seek some solitary grove  And give a loose to fancy and to love  In what soft scene is gentle Delia laid  Which is at noon my Delia's favourite shade  Oft in fair Richmond's interwoven bowers  Lonely she loiters out the sultry hours  Does she to Merlin's  Merlin's cave in Richmond gardens where there is a collection of English classics to which mr Pope alludes in this line  Even Merlin's cave is half unfurnish'd yet  awful cave retire  To feast her fancy with poetic fire  Or to the Hermitage  The Hermitage is a grotto in the same gardens in which are placed the busts of several learned men  romantic vault  Where learned busts adorn the classic grot  Oh let me find the beauteous maid alone  And at her feet pour out my artless moan  No longer will I pine in dumb despair  Perhaps my Delia is as kind as fair  Let the soft influence of th' enchanting scene  The mazy thickets walks for ever green  The flowery lawn the lightexcluding grove  Incline her to the melting voice of love  But hark there's music'tis my Delia's voice  My Delia sings let all the grove rejoice  Hush every breeze let not an aspin move  Let all be silent Delia sings of love  Sweet maid let me not interrupt thy song  Let the soft notes still warble on thy tongue  And yet it is too much at once to wound  Our eyes with beauty and our ears with sound  Start not my Delia here's no danger near  Thy beauty guards theebanish every fear  Even Love himself the tyrant of my heart  Awes with respect and takes fair Beauty's part  Long have thy charms depriv'd my soul of rest  Long has th' infection rankled in my breast  To speak my tender sorrow oft I've tried  As oft my tongue the tender task denied  Oh hear me gentle Delia hear me now  Incline propitious to my lovesick vow  So may thy charms no fading changes prove  But bloom for ever constant as my love  Tho' unadorn'd with titles or with power  Tho' Fortune smil'd not on my natal hour  Yet I've a heart that's rich in fond desire  And my soul glows with more than vulgar fire  But if 'tis wealth alone thy love can draw  I'll dig for treasure in the mines of  The author is designed for the profession of the bar  Law  Pierce the dull gloom of Coke's pedantic lore  And from his dross extract the purest ore  Wondering shall Delia hear my praises rung  What flowing periods trickle from my tongue  Inspir'd by thee and Love's superior aid  Like Coke I'll counsel and like Tully plead  Unpleasing thus I'll drudge away my youth  Far from the paths of science and of truth  Wage endless battles at the noisy bar  To deck thee with the spoils of civil war  For meif 'twere not to inrich my fair  I'd wish to shun the bustling noise of care  Far in the centre of some peaceful grove  Retir'd to dwell with Delia and with love  Then should we feast on pure extatic bliss  Exchanging souls at every melting kiss  Wrapt in delight my Delia then should prove  How poor all grandeur is compar'd to love  Ah do not gomy gentle Delia stay  You'll scorch your beauties in the blaze of day  The sun now rages in his highest noon  And 'tis a pity sure to part so soon  But if we mustlet's take one tender leave  Shall we my fair meet here again at eve  Oh there's celestial music in that yes  Thus let me seal the promise of my bliss  EVENING THE FOURTH ELEGY  HOW mild the evening how serene the sky  With streaky purple ting'd etherial dye  Calm stillness rules no Zephyr seems to move  And the soft hour invites the soul to love  The tedious minute now approaches near  When Delia promis'd she would meet me here  And now to feast my Delia in this bower  I've gather'd every fruit and every flower  The velvet peach the plum's unsullied blue  Emblem of untouch'd beauty's virgin hue  The pine's rich fruit less nature's child than art's  And cherriesthat resemble bleeding hearts  To form a couch these roses here I'll strow  With these I'll weave a garland for her brow  With Flora's gifts fantastic dress her hair  Then gaze with wonder on the smiling fair  Then will I press her little hand in mine  While she with blushing innocence divine  And soft reluctance shall my hand controul  I'll pour out all the rapture of my soul  Grown bold in love transported with my bliss  On her ripe lips I'll print a living kiss  Whose warm impression fondly shall impart  And send the soft infection to her heart  Love's fire shall flash around her as I gaze  And Delia's eye shall kindle in the blaze  Thro' every vein shall flame the young desire  Like subtil magic of electric fire  From soul to soul the mutual blaze thus caught  Wish meeting wish and thought preventing thought  Together we'll expire in flames of love  So Semele was once consum'd by Jove  But hark she comesthe punctual maid is near  The silky rustling of her veil I hear  I'll run to meet hersoft'twas but a breeze  That gently breathing fann'd the quivering trees  And yet the time's elaps'dwhy this delay  And now the setting sun has clos'd the day  I'll climb the lofty summit of this tree  Haply from thence my Delia I may see  Oh 'tis a dreary desert all around  I strain my eyeballs yet no Delia's found  Now were it well to ease at once my pains  And leaping hence beat out my desperate brains  I knew she would not comedeceitful maid  How soon her smiles my easy faith betray'd  Who'd think that Delia falsely thus could do  Yet as a woman who could think her true  Who knows but now most lavish of her charms  Loosely she wanton's in some rival's arms  While drunk with luscious love th' intemperate boy  Riots in bliss and surfeits with the joy  Distracting thought 'tis phrenzy 'tis despair  I'll fly this instant to th' abandon'd fair  Her and her paramour I'll drag to light  And feast censorious matrons with the sight  Yet stay my heart whence this tumultuous speed  My Delia's wrong'dshe's innocence indeed  She's chaste she's virtuous as the vestal flame  'Tis I am wretch'dshe's a spotless name  THE GENIUS OF BRITAIN  ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM PITT ESQ  O Thou ordain'd at length by pitying fate  To save from ruin a declining state  Adorn'd with all the scientific stores  Which bloom'd on Roman or Athenian shores  At whose command our passions rise or fall  Obedient to the magic of thy call  Whose breast O never let the flame expire  Glows ardent with the Patriot's sacred fire  Attend the Bard who scorns the venal lays  Which servile Flattery spurious Greatness pays  Whose British spirit emulating thine  Could ne'er burn incense at Corruption's shrine  Who far from courts maintains superior state  And thinks that to be free is to be great  Careless of pride's imperial smile or frown  A friend to all mankind but slave to none  Above temptation and unaw'd by power  Pleas'd with his present lot nor wishes more  Save that kind heaven would give his warm desire  What kings can't grant nor courtiers oft require  From each low view of selfish faction free  To think to speak to live O Pitt like thee  THE GENIUS OF BRITAIN  AN IAMBIC ODE WRITTEN IN MDCCLVI  AS late o'er Britain's chalky coasts  The Genius of the island flew  The venal swarm of foreign hosts  Inglorious basking in his view  Deep in his breast he felt the new disgrace  And honest blushes warm'd his godlike face  Quick flash'd the lightning of his spear  Which blasted France on Cressy's field  He wheel'd the blazing sword in air  And on his shoulders spread the shield  As when o'er Agincourt's bloodpurpled lands  Pale Terror stalk'd thro' all the Gallic bands  Soon as he cast his eyes below  Deep heav'd the sympathetic sigh  Sudden the tears of anguish flow  For sore he felt th' indignity  Discordant passions shook his heavenly frame  Now Horror's damp now Indignation's flame  Ah what avails he cried the blood  Shed by each patriot band of yore  When Freedom's unpaid legions stood  Protectors of this seagirt shore  When antient Wisdom deem'd each British sword  From hostile power could guard its valiant lord  What tho' the Danish raven spread  Awhile his wings o'er English ground  The bird of prey funereal fled  When Alfred call'd his peers around  Whose fleets triumphant riding on the flood  Deep stain'd each chalky cliff with Denmark's blood  Alfred on natives could depend  And scorn'd a foreign force t' employ  He thought who dar'd not to defend  Were never worthy to enjoy  The Realm's and Monarch's interest deem'd but one  And arm'd his subjects to maintain their own  What tho' weak John's divided reign  The Gallic legions tempted o'er  When Henry's barons join'd again  Those feather'd warriors left the shore  Learn Britons hence you want no foreign friends  The Lion's safety on himself depends  Reflect on Edward's glorious name  On my fifth Henry's martial deeds  Think on those peers of deathless fame  Who met their king on Thames's meads  When sovereign might acknowledg'd reason's plea  That heaven created man for liberty  Tho' Rome's fell star malignant shone  When good Eliza rul'd this state  On English hearts she plac'd her throne  And in their happiness her fate  While blacker than the tempests of the North  The Papal tyrant sent his curses forth  Lo where my Thames's waters glide  At great Augusta's regal feet  Bearing on each returning tide  From distant realms a golden fleet  Which homeward wafts the fruits of every zone  And makes the wealth of all the world your own  Shall on his silver waves be borne  Of armed slaves a venal crew  Lo the old God denotes his scorn  And shudders at th' unusual view  Down to his deepest cave retires to mourn  And tears indignant bathe his crystal urn  O how can vassals born to bear  The galling weight of Slavery's chain  A Patriot's noble ardor share  Or Freedom's sacred cause maintain  Britons exert your own unconquer'd might  A Freeman best defends a Freeman's right  Look back on every deathless deed  For which your Sires recorded stand  To battle let your nobles lead  The sons of toil a hardy band  The sword on each rough peasant's thigh be worn  And war's green wreathes the shepherd's front adorn  But see upon his utmost shores  America's sad Genius lies  Each wasted province he deplores  And casts on me his languid eyes  Bless'd with heaven's favourite ordinance I fly  To raise th' oppress'd and humble tyranny  This said the Vision westward fled  His wrinkled brow denouncing war  The way firemantled Vengeance led  And Justice drove his airy car  Behind firmfooted Peace her olive bore  And Plenty's horn pour'd blessings on the shore  FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE  A DIALOGUE ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY  FRIENDSHIP  IN vain thy lawless sires contend with mine  Tho' crowds unnumber'd fall before thy shrine  Let youths who ne'er aspir'd to noble fame  And the soft virgin kindle at thy flame  Thee son of indolence and vice I scorn  By reason nourish'd and of virtue born  LOVE  Vain is that boasted reason 'gainst my dart  I pierce the sage's as the vulgar heart  All ages sexes the soft torment share  The hoary patriot and the blooming fair  To narrow limits is thy sway confin'd  To some few breasts I triumph o'er mankind  FRIENDSHIP  From grovelling sources ever springs thy power  Still varying fancy and frail beauty's flower  Then with its cause the shortliv'd ardour flies  A flash of passion that but gleams and dies  Mine on fair virtue rais'd still lives the same  In generous hearts a constant equal flame  LOVE  Love is not always that degenerate thing  I too from virtue as from beauty spring  Thou to the same dull circle ever true  Know'st but one form all tempers to subdue  Wide is my empire manifold my arts  And various are the plumes that wing my darts  Here a fair face allures desiring eyes  There modesty and sense enslave the wise  Thus while each power with equal warmth contends  The clouds divide an heavenly form descends  Wings o'er his shoulders mantling wav'd behind  His snowy garments floated in the wind  A wreathe of mingled flowers adorn'd his head  Immortal flowers by mold etherial fed  Graceful he mov'd in youth and beauty's pride  His cheeks Aurora's opening blushes dy'd  A flaming torch he bore approaching now  Fair Hymen guardian of the nuptial vow  They knew and paus'd he first the silence broke  Celestial music warbled as he spoke  HYMEN  Cease rival powers with rage unjust to glow  Ye both to men the noblest gifts bestow  Howe'er by folly or by vice abus'd  Bsessings are turn'd to curses when misus'd  Mine be the praise the gifts of both to blend  And to the virtuous lover join the friend  Thus shall life glide away in mutual joys  Sweets that ne'er tire and rapture that ne'er cloys  So blest an union Anna may'st thou prove  A constant friendship in a tender love  A SONG  BY MA  THE shape alone let others prize  The features of the fair  I look for spirit in her eyes  And meaning in her air  A damask cheek an ivory arm  Shall ne'er my wishes win  Give me an animated form  That speaks a mind within  A face where awful honour shines  Where sense and sweetness move  And angel innocence refines  The tenderness of love  These are the soul of beauty's frame  Without whose vital aid  Unfinish'd all her features seem  And all her roses dead  But ah where both their charms unite  How perfect is the view  With every image of delight  With graces ever new  Of power to charm the greatest woe  The wildest rage controul  Diffusing mildness o'er the brow  And rapture thro' the soul  Their power but faintly to express  All language must despair  But go behold Arpasia's face  And read it perfect there  INSCRIPTION FOR AN OAK IN PENSHURST PARK  BY THE LATE MR F COVENTRY  STranger kneel here to age due homage pay  When great Eliza held Britannia's sway  My growth beganthe

virgin vows  And such they arefor loose desires  But ill deserve the tender name  They blast like lightning's transient fires  But Love's a pure and constant flame  Love scorns a sordid selfish bliss

smit with chill amaze  Confess the fiend and trembling praise  " How like 'tis Satan's self they cry  " His cloven foot his sawcer eye"  Children ran screaming from the sight  And women shriek'd and swoon'd with fright  Our artist now elate with pride  Looks big and moves with stately stride  Contracts his brow severe and awing  A firstrate handat devildrawing  Each coxcomb thus in nature's spite  At wit will nibble wrong or right  In vain they copy and they steal  Their folly still their jests reveal  They rhimeit pleases foe nor friend  They next to repartee descend  'Tis dullno laughter gains them fame  They fall to pun'tis just the same  Then tir'd with unsuccessful gleanings  Of wit they try at double meanings  In which of humour no more trace is  Than in our Goblin of the Graces  Yet see them all their labours past  Crown'd with the wish'd success at last  Proud of their power with hints obscene  To give fair modesty the spleen  To make bawds whores and coxcombs snigger  They strutno train'dband cit looks bigger  While all the good polite and wise  The pert dull graceless apes despise  FURTHER ADVICE TO AN AUTHOR AND MORE PLAUSIBLE  TO MR GEMINI SEE POETICAL CALENDAR FOR
