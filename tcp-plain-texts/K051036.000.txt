 AN ESSAY OF HEALTH AND LONG LIFE  By GEORGE CHEYNE M D F R S  Hippoc  At Imbecillis quo in Numero magna Pars Urbanorum omnesque pene Cupidi Literarum sunt Observatio major necessaria est ut quod vel corporis vel Loci vel Studii Ratio detrahit Cura restituat  Cels  LONDON  Printed for GEORGE STRAHAN at the  Golden Ball  overagainst the  Royal Exchange  in  Cornhill  and J LEAKE Bookseller at  Bath    TO THE Right Honourable Sir JOSEPH JEKYLL Master of the  ROLLS  This TREATISE is inscribed As a Testimony of Respect and Gratitude BY  His most obliged faithful humble Servant GEORGE CHEYNE  THE PREFACE  _THIS being probably the last Time I may trespass on the Publick I look upon myself in some Measure obliged to settle my Accounts with the World as an Author before I make my  Exit  by endeavouring to shew I have not always offended out of Presumption Vanity or Wantonness  The first Time I adventured in Print was on the Account of my great Master and generous Friend Dr  Pitcairn  He thought himself illused by some of his Brethren of the profession who then were at intestine War on the Subject of Fevers and fancied the handsomest Way to bring them down was to exhibit a more specious Account of this Disease than any of them had shewn His Business then in the Practice of Physick was so great as not to allow him sufficient Time for such a Work Two others therefore with myself were joined to manage the Affair In which he was to cut and carve and to add the practical Part My Province was the Theory I was then very young in the Profession and living in the Country But in a few Days I brought in my Part finished as it now appears under the Title of  The New Theory of Fevers  The others either suppress'd or forgot theirs and mine without the least Alteration but in a few Words was ordered for the Press I could not resist the Commands of my Friend but would not suffer my Name to be put to it being conscious it was a raw and unexperienced Performance There are tho' some Thing sin it which may be of Use to Beginners both as to the Method of philosophising on the animal Oeconomy and in the Account of the Manner of the Operation of the greater Medicines The Foundations also and the Causes assigned for acute and slow Fevers I still think solid and just and more particular and limited than those of any other Theory yet published But it wants so much filing and finishing so many Alterations and Additions as would cost me more Labour and Pains than the writing a new Treatise on the  same Subject So that out of mere Laziness and Inappetency I have thrown it by as unripe Fruit and suffered it to be as if it never had been  My next Sally was in a Book of abstracted Geometry and Algebra entitled  Methodus Fluxionum Inversa  brought forth in Ambition and bred up in Vanity There are some Things in it tolerable for the Time when the Methods of Quadratures the Mensuration of Ratio's and Transformation of Curves into those of other Kinds were not advanced to such Heights as they now are But it is a long Time since I was forced to forgoe these barren and airy Studies for more substantial and commodious Speculations Indulging and Rioting in these so exquisitely bewitching Contemplations being only proper for publick Professors and those born to Estates and who are under no outward  Necessities Besides to own a great but grievous Truth tho' they may quicken and sharpen the Invention strengthen and extend the Imagination improve and refine the reasoning Faculty and are of Use both in the necessary and the luxurious Refinement of mechanical Arts yet having no Tendency to rectify the Will sweeten the Temper or mend the Heart they often leave a Stiffness Positiveness and Sufficiency on weak Minds much more pernicious to Society and the Interests of the great End of our Being than all the Advantages they bring them can recompence They are indeed EdgeTools not to be trusted in the Hands of any but those who have already acquired an humble Heart a lowly Spirit and a sober and teachable Temper For in others they are very apt to beget a secret and refined Pride an overweening and overbearing Vanity the most  opposite Temper to the true GospelSpirit which without Offence I may suppose to be the best Disposition of Mind that tempts them to presume on a Kind of Omniscience in Respect of their FellowCreatures that have not risen to their Elevation and to set up for an Infallibility or at least a decisive Judgment even in Matters which do not admit of a  more  or  less  their proper Object of which Kind whatever relates to the infinite Author of our Being most certainly is Upon all which Accounts conscious of my own Weakness I have long since bid them an Adieu farther than as they serve to amuse or are useful in the absolute Necessities of Life  The Defence of that Book against the learned and acute Mr  Abr de Moivre  being written in a Spirit of Levity and Resentment I most sincerely  retract and wish undone so far as it is personal or peevish and ask him and the World Pardon for it as I do for the  Defence  of Dr  Pitcairn's Dissertations  and the  New Theory of Fevers  against the late learned and ingenious Dr  Oliphant  I heartily condemn and detest all personal Reflexions all malicious and unmannerly Turns and all false and unjust Representations as unbecoming Gentlemen Scholars and Christians and disprove and undo both Performances as far as in me lies in every Thing that does not strictly and barely relate to the Argument  The first Part of the  Philosophical Principles  that of  Natural Religion  consists merely of Discourses and Lectures of  Natural Philosophy  and of its Consequences on  Religion  occasionally read or discoursed  to that most noble and great Person the Duke of  Roxburgh  who is now so great an Ornament to his Country and his high Employments to whom they were inscribed I thought they might be of Use to other young Gentlemen who while they were learning the Elements of natural Philosophy might have thereby the Principles of natural Religion insensibly instilled into them And accordingly it has been and is still used for that Purpose at both Universities Upon which Account upon proper Occasions I will not fail to improve it in all the new Discoveries in Experimental Philosophy or in the final and natural Causes of Things as happen to be made so as to leave it as little imperfect in its Kind as I possibly can  The second Part of the  Philosophical Principles  to wit that of  Revealed Religion  was added afterward to shew that all our Knowledge of Nature was by Analogy or the Relations of Things only and not their real Nature Substance or internal Principles That from this Method of Analogy the only Medium of humane Knowlege we should be necessarily led to conclude the Attributes or Qualities of the supreme and absolute Infinite were indeed analogous to the Properties or Qualities of finite Beings but only in such a Manner as the Difference between Infinite and Finite requires and that therefore not being able to know precisely these Differences we ought implicitely to believe without reasoning what is revealed to us concerning the Nature of the infinite Being or bring our Reason to submit to the Mysteries of Faith How I have succeeded is not for me to determine As the End was honest I am secure the great  Principles and the fundamental Propositions are true and just They may want a little farther clearing up and Explication But as yet I have met with no Reason to retract any Thing material else I should most certainly do it  The  Essay on the Gout and  Bath  Waters  was brought forth by mere Accident The first Draught being as I there mentioned only a Paper of Directions for a Gentleman my Friend and Patient troubled with the Gout It was enlarged upon different Occasions and published to prevent its being pyrated several Copies having been given out to others in the same Circumstances I have the Satisfaction to know from many different Hands that it has benefited great Numbers of infirm and afflicted Persons and shall  therefore go on to cultivate it as far as my poor Abilities will permit  I am now come to this my last Production whose Origin was as casual as that of my former My good and worthy Friend the present Master of the  Rolls  having been last Autumn at  Bath  for a Confirmation of his Health at his Departure desired of me to draw up some Instructions in writing to direct him in the Conduct of his Health for the future and in the Manner of supporting his Spirits free and full under the great Business he is engaged in I was then in the Hurry of our Season and could not so soon answer his Expectation as his real Worth and my sincere Esteem required I thought myself therefore the more obliged assoon as I had Leisure to exert myself to the uttermost in Obedience to his Commands At first I drew up most of  these Rules at the End of the several Chapters but upon Reflexion thought it not Respect enough to his good Taste and Capacity to judge of the Reasons of Things to prescribe him bare and dry Directions in Matters of so great Moment I added therefore the philosophical Account and Reasons of these Rules which make up the Bulk of the Chapters themselves He out of his Love to his FellowCitizens which is one shining Part of his Character and which I ought to suppose has in this Instance only imposed on his better Judgment desired they might be made publick Upon which Account several Things have been since added to make the whole of more general Use If therefore any Thing in this Treatise be tolerable or if any Person receive Benefit by it they owe it entirely to that excellent Person upon whose Account  solely it was undertaken and at whose Request it is published  I have indeed long and often observed with great Pity and Regret many very learned ingenious and even religious Persons who being weak and tender as such generally are have suffered to the last Extremity for Want of a due Regimen of Diet and other general Directions of Health who had good Sense enough to understand the Force and Necessity of such Rules valued Health sufficiently and despised sensual Gratifications for the Pleasures of the Mind so far as to be able and willing to abstain from every Thing hurtful deny themselves any Thing their Appetites craved and to conform to any Rules for a tolerable Degree of Health Ease and Freedom of Spirits and yet being ignorant how  to conduct themselves from what to abstain and what to use they have suffered even to mortal Agonies who had they been better directed and instructed had pass'd their Lives in tolerable Ease and Quiet It is for these and these only the following Treatise is designed The Robust the Luxurious the PotCompanions the Loose and the Abandoned have here no Business their Time is not yet come But the Sickly and the Aged the Studious and the Sedentary Persons of weak Nerves and the Gentlemen of the learned Professions I hope by the divine Blessing on the following Treatise may be enabled to follow their Studies and Professions with greater Security and Application and yet preserve their Health and Freedom of Spirits more entire and to a longer Date I am morally certain  had I known and been as well satisfied of the Necessity of the Rules here laid down thirty Years ago as I am now I had suffered less and had had a greater Freedom of Spirits than I have enjoy'd But every Thing is best as it has been except the Errors and Failings of our free Wills  I know no useful Means of Health and Long Life I have omitted nor any pernicious Custom I have not noted and have given the plainest and most familiar Reasons I could urge for the Rules I have here laid down Most of my Arguments as they needs must have risen out of the animal Functions and Oeconomy And I have used as little Subtilty and Refinement in my Explications of these as the present State of Natural Philosophy could admit I have been often contented with  plain and obvious Facts to account for Appearances and the Cautions thence deduced when according to the Humour of the present Age I might have run into refined Speculations of Metaphysicks or Mathematicks being contented with the  Crasso Modo philosophari  because we shall never be able to search out the Works of the Almighty to Perfection so as to penetrate the internal Nature of Things  I have consulted nothing but my own Experience and Observation on my own crazy Carcase and the Infirmities of others I have treated in the following Rules their Reasons and Philosophy so that if any Thing is borrowed it has occurred to me as my own but in so far as Authorities go to shorten philosophical Accounts Not but that all systematick Writers in  Physick and many particular Authors have treated the same Subject But their Rules besides that they are often inconsistent with Reason or contrary to Experience are so general and express'd in so unlimited and undefined Terms as leave little or no Certainty in them when apply'd to particular Cases they want the necessary Precision and Exactness and so became useless or perplexing and lastly when they come which is rarely to be found among them to give the Reasons and Philosophy of their Directions they have not the Perspicuity and natural Way of convincing the ingenious sickly and tender Sufferers so necessary to make them chearfully and readily undergo such severe Restraints which I take to be by far the most difficult Part of such a Work and which I have laboured with my utmost Power to supply  I know not what may be the Fate and Success of this Performance nor am I solicitous about it being conscious the Design was honest the Subject weighty and the Execution the best my Time my Abilities and my Health would permit which cannot bear the Labour of much Fileing and Finishing Being careful not to incroach on the Province of the Physician I have concealed nothing my Knowledge could suggest to direct the Sufferer in the best Manner I could to preserve his Health and lengthen out his Life And I have held out no false or delusory Lights to lead him astray or torment him unnecessarily  If it were possible any Set of Men could be offended at my Performance it might be my Brethren of the Profession  for endeavouring to lessen the  Materia Morbifica  But as this would be the most malicious unjust and unworthy Reflexion could be thrown on Scholars and Gentlemen of a liberal Education so I never entertain'd the most remote Vanity to think any Endeavour of mine would make so considerable a Change in the Nation especially when the Devil the World and the Flesh were on the other Side of the Question which have stood their Ground even against the Rules of Life and Immortality brought to Light by the  Gospel  I cannot conclude this tedious Preface without begging Pardon of the Reader for troubling him with my private Matters All I can say as an Apology is that of whatsoever Indifference my Concerns as an Author may  be to him yet they were not so to me this being the only Place and Time I may have to adjust them in and it being the Heighth of my Ambition  Nil conscire mihi nullâ pallescere culpâ  THE CONTENTS  _INTRODUCTION  § It is easier to preserve than recover Health to prevent than to cure Diseases  p    The

Perfection  it proves the Exercise of a particular Faculty in the Soul proper to itself  p    That all Objects being to be loved in proportion to their Beauty God must be loved infinitely and all Creatures even ourselves in Comparison to him not at all  Yet there is an allowable and just Selflove  The Measures of it  ib  The Love of God for his own Sake and without Regard to our own Happiness

a Preface by Dr W Cockburn  AN ESSAY OF  Health  and  Long Life  §  _IT is a common Saying That every Man past Forty is either a  Fool  or a  Physician  It might have been as justly added that he was a  Divine  too For as the World goes at present there is not any Thing that the Generality of the better Sort of Mankind so lavishly and so unconcernedly throw away as  Health  except  eternal Felicity  Most Men know when they  are ill but very few when they are well And yet it is most certain that 'tis easier to  preserve  Health than to  recover  it and to  prevent  Diseases than to  cure  them Towards the first the Means are mostly in our own Power Little else is required than to  bear and forbear  But towards the latter the Means are perplexed and uncertain and for the Knowledge of them the far greatest Part of Mankind must apply to others of whose Skill and Honesty they are in a great measure ignorant and the Benefit of whose Art they can but conditionally and precautiously obtain A crazy Constitution original weak Nerves dearbought Experience in Things helpful and hurtful and long Observation on the Complaints of others who came for Relief to this universal Infirmary  BATH  have at last in some measure taught me some of the most effectual Means of preserving Health and prolonging Life in those who are  tender  and  sickly  and labour under  chronical  Distempers And I thought I could not spend my leisure Hours better than by putting together the most general Rules for that Purpose and setting them in the clearest and strongest Light I could for the Benefit of those who  may want them and yet have not had such favourable Opportunities to learn them  §  And that I might write with some Order and Connexion I have chosen to make some Observations and Reflections on the  Nonnaturals  as they are called possibly because that in their preternatural State they are eminently injurious to human  Constitutions  or more  probably  because tho' they be necessary to the Subsistence of  Man  yet in respect of  him  they may be considered as  external  or different from the  internal  Causes that produce  Diseases  to wit The  Air  we breathe in Our  Meat  and  Drink  Our  Sleep  and  Watching  Our  Exercise  and  Rest  Our  Evacuations  and their Obstructions The  Passions  of our Minds And  lastly  to add some Observations that come not so naturally under any of these Heads I shall not consider here how  philosophically  these  Distinctions  are made they seem to me the best general  Heads  for bringing in those  Observations  and  Reflections  I am to make in the following Pages  §  The Reflection is not more common than just That he who lives  physically  must live miserably The Truth is too great Nicety and Exactness about every minute Circumstance that may impair our Health is such a Yoke and Slavery as no Man of a generous free Spirit would submit to 'Tis as a  Poet  expresses it  to die for fear of Dying  And to forbear or give over a just charitable or even generous Office of Life from a too scrupulous Regard to Health is unworthy of a  Man  much more of a  Christian  But then on the other Hand to cut off our Days by  Intemperance    Indiscretion  and guilty  Passions  to live miserably for the sake of gratifying a  sweet Tooth  or a brutal  Itch  to die  Martyrs  to our  Luxury  and  Wantonness  is equally beneath the Dignity of  human Nature  and contrary to the  Homage  we owe to the  Author  of our Being Without some Degree of  Health  we can neither be agreeable to  ourselves  nor useful to our  Friends  we can neither relish the Blessings of  divine  Providence to us in  Life  nor acquit ourselves of our  Duties  to our  Maker  or our  Neighbour  He that  wantonly  transgresseth the  selfevident  Rules of  Health  is guilty of a Degree of  SelfMurder  and an  habitual  Perseverance therein is direct  SelfMurder  Suicide  and consequently the greatest Crime he can commit against the  Author  of his Being as it is slighting and despising the noblest  Gift  he could bestow upon him  viz  the  Means  of making himself infinitely  happy  and also as it is a  treacherous  forsaking the  Post  wherein his  Wisdom  has placed him and thereby rendering himself incapable of answering the Designs of his  Providence  over him The infinitely wise  Author  of  Nature  has so contrived  Things  that the most remarkable RULES of preserving LIFE and HEALTH are  moral Duties  commanded us so truē it is that  Godliness has the Promises of this Life as well as that to come  To avoid all useless Refinement I will lay down only a few plain easily observed Rules which a Man may readily follow without any Trouble or Constraint  CHAP I Of AIR  §  AIR  being one of the most necessary Things towards the  Subsistence  and  Health  of all  Animals  'tis a Wonder to me that here in  England  where  Luxury  and all the Arts of  living well  are cultivated even to a  Vice  the Choice of Air should be so little considered  §  From Observations on Bleeding in  Rheumatisms  and after catching Cold 'tis evident that the  Air  with its different  Qualities  can alter and quite vitiate the whole  Texture  of the Blood and  animal  Juices From the  Palsies    Vertigoes    Vapours  and other  nervous Affections  caused by  Damps    Mines  and working on some  Minerals    Vide  Ramazini  of the Diseases of Tradesmen  particularly  Mercury  and  Antimony  'tis plain  Air  so and so qualified can relax and obstruct the whole nervous  System  From the  Cholics    Fluxes    Coughs  and  Consumptions  produced by damp moist and  nitrous Air  'tis manifest that it can obstruct and spoil the noble  Organs  The  Air  is attracted and received into our  Habit  and mixed with our  Fluids  every Instant of our  Lives  so that any ill  Quality  in the  Air  so continually introduced must in Time produce  fatal  Effects on the animal  OEconomy  And therefore it will be of the utmost Consequence to every one to take Care what kind of  Air  it is they sleep and watch breath and live in and are perpetually receiving into the most intimate  Union  with the  Principles  of Life I shall only take Notice of three Conditions of  Air  §  The  first  is That when  Gentlemen  build  Seats  they ought never to place them upon any high  Hill  very near any great  Confluence  of Water in the Neighbourhood of any great  Mines  or Beds of  Minerals  nor on any swamp marshy or mossy Foundation but either in a  champaign  Country or on the  Side  of a small Eminence sheltered from the  North  and  East  Winds or upon a light gravelly Soil The Nature of the Soil will be well known from the  Plants  and  Herbs  that grow on it or rather more securely from the Nature of the  Waters  that spring out of it which ought always to be  sweet    clear    light    soft  and  tastless  All high  Mountains  are damp as Dr  Halley  observed at  St Helena  a mountainous Place where  Damps  fell so perpetually in the Night time that he was obliged to be every Moment wiping his  Glasses  in making his  Astronomical  Observations And where the  Mountains  are high the Inhabitants of them are forced to send their  Furniture  in Winter to the  Valley  lest it should rot And 'tis common to have it rain or snow on Mountains when the Valleys below are clear screne and dry All great  Hills  are Nests of  Minerals  and Covers made of the prominent Earth for  Reservoirs  of  RainWater  The Clouds are but great  Fleeces  of rarified Water sailing in the  Air  sometimes not many Yards above the  champaign  Country and these high  Hills  intercepting them they are compressed into  Dew  and  Rain  and are perpetually drilling down the  Crannies  of  the Mountains into these  Basins  Hence the  Origin  of  Rivers    and fresh Water Springs  Besides that these mountainous Places are always expos'd to high and almost perpetual  Winds  Where any great  Concourse  of Water is the  Air  must needs be perpetually damp because the  Sun  is perpetually straining from these  Waters  moist  Dews  and  Vapours  thro'  it  All great Nests of  Minerals  or large  Mines  must necessarily impregnate the  Air  with their respective Qualities And  mossy  Blackness is some Degree of  Putrefaction  as  See his Treatise about Light and Colours  Sir  Isaac Newton  observes  §  Secondly  the  Winds  that are most frequent and most pernicious in  England  are the  Easterly  especially the  North East  Winds which in the  Winter  are the most  piercing  cold in  Summer  the most  parching  hot In  Winter  they bring along with them all the  Nitre  of the  Northern  and  Scythian  Snows  Mountains of Ice  and  frozen Seas  thro' which they come and in  Summer  blow with all the  fiery  Particles of the  perpetual Day  they pass thro' From the end of  January  till towards the end of  May  the Wind blows almost perpetually from the  Eastern  and  Northern  Points if the  Spring  is dry and from the  Southern  and  Western  Points if the  Spring  is wet and generally from the setting in of the  Winds  on a  NewMoon  you may predict the Weather of the  Spring  and our  Bodies  most certainly attracting the circumambient  Air  and the  Fumes  of those Bodies that are next to us it will be very convenient for  valetudinary    studious  and  contemplative  Persons in a  dry  Spring or in  Easterly Winds  to change their Bedchambers into Rooms that have  Western  or  Southern  Lights or to shut close up the  Eastern  and  Northern  Lights or to have them but seldom opened and in  wet  Seasons to take the contrary Course And if any  such  Person has been much exposed or long abroad in a  Northerly  or  bleakish Easterly  Wind it will be very proper for him to drink down going to Bed a large Draught of warm Watergruel or of warm small  Mountainwine  Whey as an  Antidote  against the  nitrous Effluvia  suck'd into the Body and to open the  Obstructions  of the  Perspiration  made thereby  §  Thirdly  from the beginning of  November  till towards the beginning of  February    London  is cover'd over with one universal  nitrous  and  sulphurous  Smoak from the Multitude of Coal Fires the Absence of that  material Divinity  the  Sun  and the Consequence thereof the falling of the  Dews  and Vapours of the  Night  In such a  Season    weak  and  tender  People and those that are subject to  nervous  or  pulmonick  Distempers ought either to go into the  Country  or to be at  home  soon after  Sunset  and to dispel the  Damps  with clear warm Fires and chearful Conversation go early to Bed and rise proportionally sooner in the Morning for as the  Sun's  Removal suffers the Vapours to fall and condense in the  Evening  so his Approach dispels and raises them in the  Morning  I need not add that it will be very fit for those that are  valetudinary  to have their Servants Children Bedfellows and all those that approach them with whom they live constantly  and mix  Atmospheres  to be as healthy sound and sweet as possibly they can and for their  own sakes  to have them remov'd till they are made so if they are otherwise Nor shall I add any pressing instances to avoid  wet  Rooms  damp  Beds and  foul  Linnen or to remove  Ordure  and  Nusances  the Luxury of  England  having run all these rather into a  Vice  §  The  Air  is a  Fluid  wherein Parts of all Kinds of Bodies swim as in Water But  Air  differs from  Water  in this that the  first  is compressible into a lesser Compass and smaller  Volume  like a  Fleece  of  Wool  either by its own  Weight  or any other  Force  which  Weight  or  Force  being removed the  Air  immediately recovers its former Bulk and Dimensions again whereas no  Force  whatever can bring  Water  into narrower Bounds that is  Air  is extreamly  elastick  and  springy  but  Water  is not at all so Yet the Parts of  Air  would seem to be  grosser  than the Parts of  Water  For  Water  will get through a  Bladder  and may be forced through the  Pores  of  Gold  but  Air  will pass through neither By this its  elastick Force  the  Air  insinuates  itself into the patent  Cavities  of all  animal  Bodies and the  Infant  which never breathed before assoon as it is exposed to this  Element  has the little  Bladders  whereof the  Lungs  consist blown up into a  perpendicular  Erection on the Branches of the  Windpipe  whereby the Obstruction from the Pressure of these  Vesicles  arising from their being compressed together and lying upon one another being in some Measure taken off the  muscular Action  of the right  Ventricle  of the  Heart  is able to force the Blood through the  Lungs  into the left  Ventricle  But these little  Bladders  being thus  inflated  by an  elastick Fluid  still press so far upon and grind the grosser  Particles  of the Blood into more  sizeable ones  that they may become small enough to  circulate  through the other  capillary Vessels  of the Body This  elastick Air  pressing equally every Way round by its  Weight  and  Spring  shuts close the  Scales  of the  Scarfskin  of healthy and strong Persons so that it denies all  Entrance  to the  nitrous  and  watry  Mixture contained in it and thus becomes a Kind of  Cold Bath  to them and defends them from catching  Cold  But in  sickly    studious  and  sedentary  People  and those of weak  Nerves  where the  Spring  of the  Coverlets  and  Scales  that defend the Mouths of the  perspiratory Ducts  is weak the  Perspiration  little or next to none at all and the Blood  poor  and  sizey  the  nitrous  and  watry Particles  of the  Air  get a ready and free  Entrance  by these  Ducts  into the Blood and by breaking the  Globules  thereof  coagulating  and fixing its  Fluidity  quite stop the  Perspiration  and obstruct all the  capillary  Vessels the  cutaneous Glands  and those of the  Lungs  and  alimentary  Passages when such Bodies are long exposed to such an  Air  And thus begets all these Disorders in the Body that  Air  thus and thus  poisoned  was shewn capable to produce So long as the  Perspiration  is  strong    brisk  and  full  'tis impossible any of these Disorders should happen because the  Force  of the  perspiratory  Steams outward is greater than the  Force  whereby these  noxious Mixtures  enter unless the Body be indiscreetly too long exposed or the Action of the  nitrous  and  watry Mixtures  be extremely violent Hence it comes to pass that those who are very  strong  and  healthy  and those who have  drank strong Liquors  so plentifully as to have thereby a brisk  Circulation  and full  Perspiration  seldom or never catch  Cold  And this is the Reason why  rich Foods  and  generous Wines  moderately used become so excellent an  Antidote  in  infectious  and  epidemick  Distempers not only as they banish  Fear  and  Terror  but as they make so full and free a Stream of  Perspiration  and maintain so active and brisk an  Atmosphere  as suffers no  noxious Steams  or  Mixtures  in the  Air  to come within it but drives and beats off the Enemy to a Distance But Persons of  viscous    heavy Fluids  of  poor  and  sizey Juices  of little or no  Perspiration  such as generally all  studious    sedentary  and  sickly  Persons are but especially those that are subject to  nervous  Disorders must necessarily suffer under these  poisonous Mixtures  in the  Air  if they do not cautiously and carefully fence against them or take not a present Remedy and  Antidote  when  tainted  For besides the  Air  that gets through the  perspiratory Ducts  into the Blood whenever we Eat Drink or Breath we are taking into our Bodies such  Air  as is about us And when the  concoctive  Powers are  weak  as in such  Persons  and the  Quantity  of the  Food  is too great or its  Quality  too strong for  them the  Chyle  is too gross and the  perspiratory  Matter is stopped because too large for these small  Ducts  and this whole  Mass  which in  common  Health is more than  double  of the gross  Evacuations    recoils  in upon the  Bowels  and becomes as it were  Spears  and  Darts  and  Armour  to the  Air  received from without which being thus  sharpened  with the  Salts  of the  unconcocted Food  together with its own  elastick Force  pierces the Sides of the  Vessels  and gets into all the  Cavities  of the Body and between the  Muscles  and their  Membranes  and there in Time brings forth  hypochondriack    hysterick    nervous  and  vapourish  Disorders and all that  black Train  of  Evils  such Constitutions suffer under  I shall now draw out the  Cautions  here inculcated into a few general Rules  General Rules for Health and Long Life drawn from the Head Of AIR  THE healthiest Situation for a  Seat  is in a  champaign  Country or on the  Side  of a small Eminence on a  gravelly  Soil with a  Southern  or  Western  Exposition sheltered from the  North  and  East  Winds distant from any great  Concourse  of Waters or any great  Mines  or Beds of  Minerals  where the Water is  sweet    clear    light    soft  and  tastless    Tender  People on the setting in of  Easterly  and  Northerly  Winds ought to change their BedRooms for others of  Westerly  and  Southerly  Lights and the contrary in wet Seasons  Those who have been much exposed to or long abroad in  Easterly  or  Northerly  Winds should drink some thin and warm Liquor going to Bed  When the dark dull foggy Weather lasts at  London  in Winter tender  People and those of weak  Nerves  and  Lungs  ought either to go into the  Country  or keep much at Home in warm Rooms go early to Bed and rise betimes    Valetudinary  People ought to have their Servants Children and Bedfellows or those they continually approach and converse with sound sweet and healthy or ought to remove them 'till they are so if they are otherwise    Every  one in order to pteserve their Health ought to observe all the Cleanness and Sweetness in their Houses Cloaths and Furniture suitable to their Condition  CHAP II Of MEAT and DRINK  §  TO have our  Food  that is our Meat and Drink as to  Quantity  and  Quality  duly regulated and precisely adjusted to our  concoctive Powers  would be of the utmost Consequence to  Health  and  Long Life  Our Bodies require only a  determinate Quantity  thereof to supply the  Expences  of living and a just Proportion of that to these would very probably preserve us from  acute  most certainly from  chronical  Distempers and enable us to live without much Sickness and Pain so long as our Constitutions were originally made to  last  The Sources of  chronical  Distempers are  first  Viscidity in the Juices or the Overlargeness of their constituent  Particles  which not being sufficiently broken by the  concoctive  Powers stop or retard the  Circulation  or  secondly  too great abundance of sharp and acrimonious  Salts    whereby the Juices themselves are rendered so  corrosive  as to burst or wear out the Solids or  thirdly  a  Relaxation  or Want of a due  Force  and Springiness in the Solids themselves An Excess in  Quantity  begets the  first  the  ill Condition  of our Meat and Drink the  second  and  both  together with Want of due Labour the  third  §  The Meat of  England  is generally  animal  Substances The  Animals  themselves from  epidemick  Causes bad Food Age or other Infirmities have their Diseases as well as  human  Creatures and these diseased  Animals  can never be proper or sound Food for Men Adult  Animals  abound more in  urinous Salts  than young ones Their Parts are more closely compacted because more forcibly united and so harder of Digestion 'Tis true the great Distinction of the  Fitness  or  Unfitness  of the several Sorts of  Animals  and  Vegetables  for human Food depends upon their  original Make    Frame  and  Nature  and that can be found out only by Experience as also upon the  special  Taste  Complexion    Temperament  and  Habits  of the Person that feeds on them But by the Help of these  Three  Principles  viz First  That the  Strength  or Weakness of Cohesion of the Particles of fluid Bodies depends upon their  Bigness  or  Smallness  that is the  biggest  Particles cohere more firmly than the  smaller  because more Parts come into Contact in large Bodies than small and so their  Union  is greater  Secondly  That the  greater  the Force  Momentum  is with which two Bodies meet the stronger is their Cohesion and the more difficult their Separation  Thirdly  that  Salts  being comprehended by plain  Surfaces  being  hard  and in all Changes recovering their Figure unite the most firmly of any Bodies whatsoever Their plain  Surfaces  bring many Points into  Contact  and  Union  Their  Hardness  and constant  Figure  make them  durable  and  unalterable  and thereby the  active Principles  and the Origin of the Qualities of Bodies and when they approach within the  Sphere  of one another's  Activity  they firmly unite in  Clusters  all which make the Separation of their original  Particles  the more difficult I say from these  three Principles  we may in general compare the Easiness or Difficulty of digesting that is breaking into small Parts the several Sorts of  Vegetables  and  Animals  one with another and so discover their  Fitness  or  Unfitness  for becoming Food for tender and  valetudinary  Persons  All other Things being supposed equal those  Vegetables  and  Animals  that come to  Maturity  the soonest are  lightest  of  Digestion  Thus the Spring  Vegetables  as  Asparagus    Strawberries  and some Sorts of  Sallading  are more easily digested than  Pears    Apples    Peaches  and  Nectarines  because they have less of the  solar  Fire in them their Parts are united by a weaker Heat that is with less  Velocity  and abound less in nay scarce have any strong and fixed  Salts  Among the  Animals  the common Poultry  Hares    Sheep    Kids    Rabbets    c  who in the same or a few Years come to their  Maturity  that is to propagate their  Species  are much more tender and readily digested than  Cows  Horses or Asses were these last in use for Food as they have been in  Famine    c  for the Reason already given because their Parts cohere less firmly And it is observable of the  Vegetables  which are longest a ripening that is whose  Juices  have most of the  solar  Rays  in them that their  fermented Juices  yield the strongest  vinous  Spirits as Grapes Elderberries and the like and of the  Animals  that are longest in coming to  Maturity  that their  Juices  yield the most rank and most  foetid  urinous  Salts  Other Things supposed  equal  the  larger  and  bigger  the  Vegetable  or  Animal  is in its Kind the  stronger  and the  harder  to digest is the Food made thereof Thus a large  Onion    Apple  or  Pear  and large  Beef  and  Mutton  are  harder  to digest than the  lesser  ones of the same Kind not only as their Vessels being stronger and more  elastick  their Parts are brought together with a  greater  Force but also because the  Qualities  are proportionably more intense in great Bodies of the same Kind Thus other Things being equal a  greater  Fire is proportionably more intensely hot than a lesser one and the Wine contained in a larger Vessel becomes stronger than that contained in a lesser and consequently the Juices of larger  Animals  and  Vegetables  are more rank than the Juices of smaller ones of the same Kind  Other Things being equal The proper Food appointed for  Animals  by Nature is easier digested than the  Animals  themselves those  Animals  that live on  Vegetables  than those that live on  Animals  those that live on  Vegetables  or  Animals  that soonest come to  Maturity  than those that live on such as are longer a ripening Thus  Milk  and  Eggs  are lighter of Digestion than the Flesh of  Beasts  or  Birds    Pullets  and  Turkies  than  Ducks  and  Geese  and  Partridge  and  Pheasant  are  lighter  than  Woodcock  or  Snipe  because these last being  longbilled  suck only  animal  Juices and for the Reasons already given  Grass Beef  and  Mutton  are lighter than  stallfed Oxen  and  Sheep  All Things else being alike  Fish  and  SeaAnimals  are  harder  to digest than  LandAnimals  because universally their Food is other  Animals  and the  Salt Element  in which they live compacts their Parts more firmly  Salts  having a stronger Power of  Cohesion  than other Bodies And for the same Reason  Salt Water Fish  is harder to digest than  fresh  Water Thus the  Sea Tortoise  is harder  to digest than the  Land Tortoise  and  Sturgeon  and  Turbit  than  Trout  or  Perch  Other Things being equal  Vegetables  and  Animals  that abound in an  oily    fat  and  glutinous  Substance are  harder  to digest than those of a  dry    fleshy    fibrous  Substance because  oily  and  fat  Substances clude the Force and Action of the  concoctive  Powers and their Parts attract one another and unite more strongly than other Substances do except Salts as Sir  Isaac Newton  Vide Sir  Isaac Newton  's first  English  Edition of Light and Colours  observes Their  Softness  and  Humidity  relaxes and weakens the Force of the Stomach and the Fat and Oil itself is shut up in little  Bladders  that are with Difficulty broken Thus  Nuts  of all kinds pass through the  Guts  almost untouched  Olives  are harder to digest than  Pease    fat  flesh Meat than the  lean  of the same  Carp    Tench    Salmon    Eel  and  Turbit  are much harder to digest than  Whiting    Perch    Trout  or  Haddock    Vegetables  and  Animals  all Things else being alike whose Substance is  white    or inclining to the  lighter  Colours are  lighter  to digest than those whose  Substance  is  redder    browner  or inclining towards the more flaming Colours not only because the Parts that reflect  white  and the lighter Colours are lesser in Bulk than those that reflect the more flaming Colours  See the just quoted Author  but also because those of the more flaming Colours abound more with urinious Salts Thus  Turnips    Parsnips  and  Potatoes  are lighter than  Carrots    Skirrets  and  BeetRaves Pullet    Turkey    Pheasant  and  Rabbet  are lighter than  Duck    Geese    Woodcock  and  Snipe Whiting    Flounder    Perch  and  Soal  are lighter than  Salmon    Sturgeon    Herring  and  Mackarel Veal  and  Lamb  is lighter than  Red  or  Fallow  Deer    Lastly  All other Things being equal  Vegetables  and  Animals  of a  strong    poignant    aromatick  and hot Taste are  harder  to digest than those of a  milder    softer  and more  insipid  Taste High Relish comes from abundance of Salts Abundance of Salts supposes  adult Animals  and such as are long a coming to  Maturity  and where Salts abound the Parts are more difficultly separated and harder to be digested Strong and  aromatick  Plants imbibe and retain most of the  solar  Rays and become solid Spirits or fixed  Flames  And they that deal much in them swallow so much  liveCoals  which will at last inflame the Fluids and burn up the Solids  §  There is nothing more certain than that the greater Superiority the  concoctive  Powers have over the  Food  or the stronger the  concoctive Powers  are in regard of the Things to be  concocted  the  finer  the  Chyle  will be the  Circulation  the more free and the  Spirits  more lightsome that is the better will the Health be Now from these general Propositions taking in their own particular  Complexion  and  Habits    valetudinary    studious  or  contemplative  Persons may easily fix upon these particular  vegetable  or  animal  Foods that are fittest for them And if any Error should be committed 'tis best to err on the safest Side and rather chuse those Things that are under our  concoctive  Powers than those that are above them And in the Choice of  Animals  for our Food we  must not pass over the Manner of fattening and fitting them up for the Table About  London  we can scarce have any but cramm'd  Poultry  or  stallfed  Butchery Meat It were sufficient to disgust the stoutest Stomach to see the foul gross and nasty  Manner  in which and the  fetid  putrid and unwholesome  Materials  with which they are fed Perpetual Foulness and Cramming gross Food and Nastiness we know will putrify the  Juices  and mortify the  muscular  Substance of  human  Creatures and sure they can do no less in Brute  Animals  and thus make even our Food Poison The same may be said of hot Beds and forcing  Plants  and  Vegetables  The only Way of having sound and healthful  animal  Food is to leave them to their own  natural Liberty  in the free Air and their own proper  Element  with Plenty of Food and due Cleanness and a Shelter from the Injuries of the Weather when they have a Mind to retire to it I add nothing about  Cookery  Plain Roasting and Boiling is as high as  valetudinary    tender    studious  and  contemplative  Persons or those who would preserve their Health and lengthen out their Days ought to presume on  Made  Dishes  rich  Soop    high Sauces    Baking    Smoaking    Salting  and  Pickling  are the Inventions of  Luxury  to force an unnatural Appetite and encrease the  Load  which Nature without Incentives from ill Habits and a vicious Palate will of itself make more than sufficient for  Health and long Life Abstinence  and proper  Evacuations  due  Labour  and  Exercise  will always recover a decayed  Appetite  so long as there is any Strength and  Fund  in Nature to go upon And 'tis scarce allowble to provoke an Appetite with medicinal Helps but where the  digestive  Faculties have been spoiled and ruined by acute or tedious  chronical  Distempers And as soon as 'tis recovered to any tolerable Degree  Nature  is to be left to its own Work without any Spurs from  Cookery  or  Physick  §  The next Consideration is the  Quantity  of Food that is necessary to support Nature without overloading it in a due Plight That is indeed various according to the  Age    Sex    Nature    Strength  and  Country  the Party is of and the  Exercise  he uses In these  Northern  Countries the Coldness of the  Air  the  Strength  and large Stature of  People demand larger Supplies than in the  Eastern  and warmer Countries Young growing Persons and those of great Strength and large Stature require more than the Aged Weak and Slender But Persons of all Sorts will live more healthy and longer by universal  Temperance  than otherwise And some general Observations on the Quantity Persons of different Nations and Conditions have lived on healthy and to a great Age may give some Assistance to  valetudinary  and  tender  Persons to adjust the due  Quantity  necessary for them  §  It is surprising to what a great Age the  eastern Christians  who retir'd from the Persecutions into the Desarts of  Egypt  and  Arabia  lived healthful on a very little Food We are inform'd by  Cassian  that the common Measure in twenty four Hours was about twelve Ounces or a Pound for the  eastern  Pound was but twelve Ounces with mere Element for Drink St  Anthony  liv'd to Years on mere Bread and Water adding only a few Herbs at last  James  the  Hermit  to  Arsenius  the Tutor of the Emperor  Arcadius  to in the world and in  the Desart St  Epiphanus  to St  Jerome  to about  Simeon Stylites  And  Romualdus  And  Lewis Cornaro  a  Venetian  Nobleman after he had used all other Remedies in vain so that his Life was despair'd of at yet recover'd and liv'd by the mere Force of his Temperance near to years  §  Our Northern Climate as I said from the Purity and Coldness of the Air which bracing the Fibres makes the  Appetite  keener and the Action of Digestition stronger and from the Labour and Strength of the People which makes the Expences of living more will necessarily require a greater Quantity of Food Yet 'tis wonderful in what Sprightliness Stength Activity and fredom of Spirits a low Diet even here will preserve those that have habituated themselves to it  Buchanan  informs us of one  Laurence  who preserved himself to by the mere Force of Temperance and Labour  Spotswood  mentions one  Kentigern  afterwards called St  Mongah  or  Mungo  from whom the Famous Well in  Wales  is named who lived to Years tho' after he came to the Years of Understanding he never tasted  Wine nor strong Drink and slept on the cold Ground My worthy Friend Mr  Web  is still alive He by the Quickness of the Faculties of the Mind and the Activity of the  Organs  of his Body shews the great Benefit of a low Diet living altogether on  vegetable  Food and pure  Element  The History of the Milk  See an Essay on the  Gout  and  Bath  Waters  Doctor of  Croydon  who by living on Milk only cured himself of an otherwise incurable Distemper  viz  the  Epilepsy  and liv'd in perfect Health for sixteen Years after till an  Accident  cut him off I have already narrated in my Treatise of the Gout  Henry Jenkins  a Fisherman liv'd Years his Diet was  coarse  and  sower  as his  Historian  informs us that is plain and cooling and the Air where he lived sharp and clear  viz Allerton  upon  Swale  in  Yorkshire Parr  died sixteen Years younger  viz  at the age of Years Months his Diet was old  Cheese    Milk    coarse Bread    small Beer  and  Whey  And his  Historian  tells us he might have lived a good while longer if he had not changed his Diet and Air coming out of a clear thin free Air into the thick Air of  London  and after a constant plain  and homely country Diet being taken into a spendid Family where he fed high and drank plentifully of the best Wines whereby the natural Functions of the Parts were overcharged and the Habit of the whole Body quite disordered upon which there could not but soon ensue a  Dissolution  See Abr of Philos Transact by  Lowth  Dr  Lister  mentions eight Persons in the  North  of  England  the youngest of which was above Years and the eldest He says 'tis to be observed that the Food of all this mountainous Country is exceedingly coarse And certainly there is no Place in the World more likely to lengthen out Life than  England  especially those Parts of it that have a free open Air and a gravelly and chalky Soil if to due  Exercise    Abstemiousness  and a plain simple  Diet  were added  §  I have  See the Essay of the  Gout  and  Bath  Waters  elsewhere offered to determine the  Quantity  of Food sufficient to keep a Man of an Ordinary Stature following no laborious Employment  in due  Plight    Health  and Vigour to wit Ounces of Flesh Meat of Bread or vegetable Food and about a Pint of Wine or other generous Liquor in Hours But the  Valetudinary  and those employed in  sedentary  Professions or  intellectual  Studies must lessen this  Quantity  if they would preserve their Health and the Freedom of their Spirits long  Studious  and  sedentary  Men must of Necessity eat and drink a great deal less than those very same Men might do were they engaged in an  active  Life For as they want that  Exercise  that is necessary towards  Concoction  and  Perspiration  and that their  Nerves  are more worn out by  intellectual  Studies than even bodily Labour would waste them if in any wise they indulge  Freedom of Living  their Juices must necessarily become viscid and their  Stomachs  relaxed He that would have a  clear  Head must have a  clean  Stomach The Neglect of which is the Cause why we see so many  hypochondriacal  melancholy and vapourish Gentlemen among those of the  long Robe  the only Remedy of which is  Labour  and  Abstinence  §  Most of all the  chronical  Diseases the  Infirmities  of old Age and the  short  Periods of the Lives of  Englishmen  are owing to  Repletion  This is evident from hence because  Evacuation  of one Kind or another is  nine  Parts of  ten  in their Remedy For not only  Cupping    Bleeding    Blistering    Issues    Purging    Vomiting  and  Sweating  are manifest  Evacuations  or Drains to draw out what has been superfluously taken down but even  Abstinence    Exercise    Alteratives    Cordials    Bitters  and  Alexipharmicks  are but several means to dispose the gross Humours to be more readily evacuated by insensible  Perspiration  that new and well concocted  Chyle  and sweet comminuted Juices may take their Place to restore the Habit And therefore it were much more easy as well as more safe and effectual to prevent than incur the Necessity of such  Evacuations  And any one may lose a  Pound  of Blood take a  Purge  or a  Sweat  by dropping the great Meal or abstaining from  animal  Food and  strong  Liquors for four or five Days in  chronical  Cases as effectually as by opening a  Vein  swallowing a Dose of  Pills  or taking a sudorifick  Bolus  §  I advise therefore all Gentlemen of a  sedentary Life  and of  learned  Professions to use as much  Abstinence  as possibly they can consistent with the Preservation of their  Strength  and Freedom of  Spirits  Which ought to be done as soon as they find any  Heaviness    Inquietudes  restless Nights or Aversion to Application either by lessening one half of their usual Quantity of  animal  Food and  strong  Liqours 'till such Time as they regain their wonted Freedom and Indolence or by living a due Time wholly upon  vegetable  Diet such as  Sago    Rice    Pudding  and the like and drinking only a little Wine and Water And if they would preserve their  Health  and Constitution and  lengthen  out their Days they must either inviolably live low or  maigre  as the  French  call it a Day or two in the Week or once a Week Fortnight or Month at farthest take some  domestick  Purge which shall require neither  Diet  nor keeping at  Home  but may at once strengthen the Bowels and discharge superfluous  Humours  Of this Kind are a Dose or of the  Scotch  Pills half a Dram of the  Pilulae Stomachicae cum Gummi  with three or four  Grains of  Diagryd  mixt half a Dram of the  Pilulae Ruffi  two Ounces of  Hiera Piera  with one Dram of the Syrup of  Buckthorn  two or three Ounces of  Elixir Salutis  or what I prefer before all these this Preparation of  Rhubarb  Take the best  Rhubarb  in Powder two Ounces and a half Salt of  Wormwood  a Dram  Orange Peel  half an Ounce grated  Nutmeg  two Scruples  Cochineal  half a Dram Infusc Hours by a warm Fireside in a Quart of true  Arrack  Strain it off and put it in a well corked Bottle for Use  Of this two or three Spoonfuls may be taken two or three Times a Week or at Pleasure with great Safety and Benefit without Interruption of Business or Studies and continued even to mature old Age if found necessary So true is old  Verulam  's Aphorism  Nothing contributes more to Health and Long Life than frequent Family Purges  Nihil magis conducit ad Sanitatem Longaevitatem  quam crebrae domesticae purgationes  And the Gentlemen of the  long Robe  those of  learned  Professions and  contemplative  Studies must of Necessity at last take Sir  Charles Scarborough  's Advice as 'tis said to the Dutchess of  Portsmouth You must eat less or use more Exercise or take Physick or be sick  §  Those who have written about  Health  have given many  Rules  whereby to know when any Person has exceeded at a  Meal  I think there needs but this  short  one which is If any Man has eat or drank so much as renders him unfit for the  Duties  and  Studies  of his Profession after an Hour's sitting quiet to carry on the Digestion he has overdone I mean only of those of  learned  Professions and  studious  Lives for those of  mechanical  Employments must take the Body the other Part of the  compound  into Consideration If  tender  People and those of learned Professions would go by this  Rule  there would be little Use for  Physick  or  Physicians  in  chronical  Cases Or if they would but eat only one Part of  animal  Food at the great Meal and make the other two of  vegetable  Food and drink only Water  with a Spoonful of Wine or clear small Beer their Appetites would be a sufficient Rule to determine the Quantity of their Meat and Drink But  Variety  of Dishes the  luxurious  Artfulness of  Cookery  and swallowing  rich Wine  after every Bit of Meat so lengthen out the  Appetite  the Fondness of Mothers and the Cramming of Nurses have so stretched the Capacities of Receiving that there is no Security from the  Appetite  among the better Sort 'Tis amazing to think how Men of  Voluptuousness    Laziness  and  poor Constitutions  should imagine themselves able to carry off  Loads  of highseasoned Foods and inflammatory Liquors without Injury or Pain when Men of  mechanick  Employments and  rubust Constitutions  are scarcely able to live healthy and in Vigour to any great Age on a simple low and almost  vegetable  Diet  §  Since then our  Appetites  are deceitful and  Weight  and  Measure  troublesome and singular we must have Recourse to a  Rule  independent of our  Sensations  and free from unnecessary Trouble and Pain To answer which I know nothing but Eating and Drinking by our  Eye  that is determining first of all either by  Weight  or  Measure  or by particular Observation or  Experiment  the Bulk or Number of Mouthfuls of Flesh Meat and the Number of Glasses of strong Liquors  under  which we are best and then by our  Eye  determining an equal Quantity at all Times for the future Thus the two Wings of a middling  Pullet  or one Wing and both Legs three Ribs of a middling Neck of  Mutton  two middling Slices of a Leg or Shoulder throwing away the  Fat  and the  Skin  somewhat less of  Beef  may be sufficient for Flesh Meat at the great Meal For we are so wisely contrived that our Food need not be adjusted to  mathematical  Points A little over or under will make no Difference in our Health As for  Pork  and all Kinds of  Hog  's Flesh I think they ought to be forbidden  valetudinary  and studious People as they were the  Jews  They feed the foulest of any Creature and their Juices are the  rankest  their Substance the most  surfeiting  and they are the most subject to cutaneous Diseases and Putrefaction of any Creature insomuch that in the Time of a  Plague  or any  epidemical  Distemper they are universally destroyed  by all wise Nations as the  Southern  People do mad Dogs in the hot Months The same Censure I should pàss upon all  Fish  Most  Fish  live in a  saltish  Element and come only into  fresh Water  Rivers for the Quietness and Conveniency of bringing forth their young ones This makes their Parts more closely united and harder of Digestion Besides as I have before observed they feed upon one another and their  Juices  abound with a  Salt  that corrupts the  Blood  and breeds  chronical  Diseases And 'tis always observable that those who live much on  Fish  are infected with the  Scurvy    cutaneous Eruptions  and the other Diseases of a  foul  Blood And every Body finds himself more thirsty and heavy than usual after a full Meal of  Fish  let them be ever so fresh and is generally forced to have Recourse to  Spirits  and distilled Liquors to carry them off So that it is become a  Proverb  among those that live much upon them that  Brandy  is  Latin  for  Fish  Besides that after a full Meal of Fish even at Noon one never sleeps so sound the ensuing Night as is certain from constant Observation These few Hints may serve the  valetudinary  Person in a gross Manner to judge by  the  Eye  the  Quantity  of solid Flesh Meat he takes or ought to take down For I judge the mentioned Quantities to be rather a little under than over  eight Ounces  As to  Broths    Soops  and  Jellies  if they be strong I account them equal in  Nourishment  and harder to digest than the same Weight of solid Flesh Meat and three or four common Spoonfuls atmost make an  Ounce  in Weight in Liquids and about double the Number of Bits commonly swallowed at once make the same Weight in solid Flesh Meat for Exactness is not here requisite  §  Drink  is the other Part of our Food The common  Drink  here in  England  is either Water MaltLiquor or Wine or Mixtures of these for  Cyder  and  Perry  are drank but in few Places and rather for Pleasure and Variety than common Use Without all peradventure Water was the primitive original  Beverage  as it is the only Simple  Fluid  for there are but  three  more in Nature  Mercury    Light  and  Air  none of which is fit for human  Drink  fitted for  diluting    moistening  and  cooling  the Ends of  Drink  appointed by  Nature  And happy had it been for the  Race  of Mankind other  mixt  and  artificial  Liquors had never been invented It has been an agreeable Appearance to me to observe with what  Freshness  and  Vigour  those who tho' eating freely of  Flesh Meat  yet drank nothing but this  Element  have lived in  Health    Indolence  and  Chearfulness  to a great Age  Water  alone is sufficient and effectual for all the Purposes of  human  Wants in  Drink  Strong Liquors were never designed for common Use They were formerly kept here in  England  as other Medicines are in  Apothecaries Shops  and prescribed by  Physicians  as they do  Diascordium  and  VeniceTreacle  to refresh the  Weary  to strengthen the  Weak  to give Courage to the  Fainthearted  and raise the  Lowspirited  And it were as just and reasonable to see Men and if they go on it is not impossible I may hear of it since  Laudanum  is already taken into  Feasts  and  Entertainments  sit down to a Dish of  VeniceTreacle  or Sir  Walter Rawleigh's Confection  with a Bottle of  Hysterick Cordial  as to a Dish of  CrawfishSoop  an  OxCheek  or  VenisonPasty  with a Bottle of  Hermitage  or  Tockay  or which some prefer to either of them a Bowl of PUNCH  Wine  is now become as common as  Water  and the  better Sort  scarce ever dilute their Food with any other Liquor And we see by daily Experience that as natural Causes will always produce their proper Effects their Blood becomes  inflammed  into  Gout    Stone  and  Rheumamatism  raging  Fevers    Pleurisies    Small Pox  or  Measles  their Passions are enraged into  Quarrels    Murder  and  Blasphemy  their Juices are dried up and their Solids scorch'd and shrivel'd Those whose Appetite and Digestion is good and entire never want strong Liquors to supply  Spirits  Such  Spirits  are too  volatile  and fugitive for any solid or useful Purposes in Life Two Ounces of  Flesh Meat  well digested beget a greater Stock of more durable and useful  Spirits  than ten Times as much  strong Liquors  which nothing but  Luxury  and  Concupiscence  makes necessary Happy those whom their  Parents  their natural Aversion to strong Liquors or whom kind  Providence  among the  better Sort  has brought to the Age of  Maturity  and  Discretion  without dealing in or desiring any great  Quantity  of  strong Liquors  Their  Passions  have been  calmer  their  Sensations  more  exquisite  their  Appetites  less  unruly  and their  Health  more uninterrupted than any other  natural Cause  could have produced And thrice happy they who continue this Course to their last Minutes Nothing is more ridiculous than the common  Plea  for continuing in drinking on large  Quantities  of  spirituous Liquors    viz  Because they have been accustomed so to do and they think it  dangerous  to leave it off all of a sudden It were as reasonable for him that is fallen into the  Fire  or  Water  to lie there because of the Danger of removing him suddenly For neither  Element  will destroy him more certainly before his Time than wallowing in  strong Liquors  If the  Quantity  of strong Liquors they have been accustomed to may be supposed prejudicial to their  Health  or to introduce  noxious Humours  into the  Habit  the sooner a Stop be put to it the better No Man is afraid to forbear  strong Liquors  in an  acute  Distemper what  Quantity  soever he might have drank in his Health And yet any sudden Change of the  Humours  would not only be more  dangerous  then than at any other Time but also would more readily happen and come to pass in such critical Cases For the whole  System  of the  Fluids  being in a  Fermentation  small Changes or Errors then would not only be more fatal but more plain and obvious And if a Person be in Hazard by such a  sudden  Alteration he cannot live long by taking down so much  Poison  But the Matter of  Fact  is false and groundless For I have known and observed constant good Effects from leaving off suddenly great Quantities of  Wine  and  Flesh Meats  too by those long accustomed to both am ready to name the Persons and never observed any ill Consequence from it in any Case whatsoever Those whose Constitutions have been  quite broken  and running into  Dissolution  have lived longer and been less pained in Sickness by so doing And those who have had a  Fund  in Nature to last longer have grown better and attained their  End  by it I allow every Man that has been accustomed to drink  Wine  or  strong Liquors  a Pint in Hours And I am well satisfied that  Quantity  is sufficient for  Health  let their Custom have been what it will Their  Spirits  may indeed  flag  and  sink  a little at first for Want of introduced  Quicklime  and  Fire  But  Lowspiritedness  in such a Case I count no  Disease  And  bearing it for some Time is bountifully recompenced by the  Health    Indolence  and  Freedom of Spirits  they afterwards enjoy Not taking into Consideration their being rescued from the Tyranny of so  immoral  and mischievous a  Habit  It may be sufficient for those who are tender studious or contemplative to drink three Glasses of Water with a Spoonful of Wine at the  great Meal  And as Sir  W Temple  has it One for your  self  another for your  Friends  a third for  good Humour  and a fourth for  your Enemies  are more than sufficient after it  §  A great Mistake committed in this Affair is that most People think the only  Remedy  for  Gluttony  is  Drunkenness  or that the Cure of a  Surfeit  of  Meat  is a  Surfeit  of  Wine  Than which nothing can be more false or contrary to Nature for  'tis lighting  as the Saying is  the Candle at both Ends  For first of all  Wine  and all other strong Liquors are as hard to digest and require as much  Labour  of the  concoctive  Powers as  strong Food  itself This is not only evident with Respect to People of  weak Stomachs  but also from hence that healthy  People who drink only  Water  or weak  small Beer  shall be able to eat and digest almost double of what they could did they drink  strong Liquors  at their  Meals  as every one that pleases may  experience Water  is the only universal Dissolvent or  Menstruum  and the most certain Diluter of all Bodies proper for Food tho' there are a great many that  spirituous Liquors  not only will not dissolve but will  harden  and make more  undigestible  especially the  Salts  of Bodies wherein their  active Qualities  that is those which can do most  Harm  to  human Constitutions  consist And I have known Men of  weak  and  tender Constitutions  who could neither eat nor digest upon drinking of  Wine  who by drinking at Meals common  Water  heated have recovered their  Appetites  and  Digestion  have thriven and grown plump 'Tis true  strong Liquors  by their  Heat  and  Stimulation  on the  Organs  of Concoction by encreasing the  Velocity  of the Motion of the  Fluids  and thereby quickening the other  animal Functions  will carry off the Load that lies upon the  Stomach  with more present Chearfulness Yet besides the future Damages of such a  Quantity  of  Wine  to the  Stomach  and to the  Fluids  by its Heat and  Inflammation  the  Food  is hurried into the Habit  unconcocted  and lays a  Foundation  for a  Fever  a Fit of the  Cholick  or some  chronical  Disease  §  Another  Mistake  I shall observe is the extreme Fondness Persons of the  better Sort  here in  England  have lately run into for the strong and  high Country Wines  I can think of no Reason for this but the very honest one the  Vulgar  give for drinking  Brandy  that they get sooner drunk on it For surely the middling lighter Wines  inflame  the  animal  Juices less go more easily off the  Stomach  and afford more Room for long  Conversation  and Chearfulness  Excess  in them gives less Pain and is sooner remedied But there are Degrees in this Matter  No Body becomes extremely bad all at once  Nemo repente fuit turpissimus  They begin with the weaker Wines these by  Use  and  Habit  will not do they leave the  Stomach  sick and  mawkish  they must fly to stronger Wine and stronger still and run the  Rise higher by Degrees  Climax  through  Brandy  to  Barbadoes Waters  and double distill'd Spirits 'till at last they can find nothing  hot enough for them People who have any Regard for their  Health  or  Lives  ought to tremble at the first  Cravings  for such poysonous Liquors  Strong Waters  should never be taken but by the  Direction  of a  Physician  or in the  Agonies  of  Death  For when Persons arrive at that State that they become necessary to their  Ease  and  Freedom  of Spirits they may be justly reckoned among the  Dead  both as to the short Time they have to live and the little Use they can be of either to themselves or Mankind I speak not here of those who are under an actual  Fit  of the  Gout  or  Cholick  in the  Stomach    We must not die for fear of dying  Nor am I recommending  sour Verjuice  or  unripe Wines  But I cannot help being well satisfied both from  Reason  and  Experience  that the  light Wines  of a  moderate Strength  due  Age  and full  Maturity  are much preferable for  Chearfulness  and  Conversation  much more wholsome for human  Constitutions  and much more proper for  Digestion  than the hot and strong Wines The rich strong and heavy Wines ought never to be tasted without a sufficient Dilution of Water at least they should be used like Brandy or Spirits for a Cordial  i e  At most to take but three small Glasses of such    Ad summum tria pocula sume  Whatsoever is more cometh of  Sin  and must be diluted with the Waters of  Repentance  §  I have no Intention here to discourage the innocent Means of  enlivening  Conversation promoting  Friendship  comforting the  sorrowful  Heart and raising the  drooping  Spirits by the  cheerful Cup  and the  social Repast  Perhaps I may like the harmless  Frolick  the  warm Reception  of a Friend and even the  Horat i e  An agreeable Frolick or Extravagance  Dulce Furere  itself more than I ought Persons sober in the main will receive little Prejudice from such a  Fillip  when the Occasions happen but seldom and especially when they make it up by a greater Degree of  Abstinence  afterwards But a  Sot  is the lowest Character in Life Did only the  Profligate  the  Scoundrel  the  Abandon'd  run into these Excesses it were in vain to endeavour to reclaim them as it were to stop a  Tempest  or calm a  Storm  But now that the  Vice  is become  Epidemical  since it has got not only among  Mechanicks  and  Tradesmen  but among Persons of the brightest  Genius    the finest  Taste  and the most accomplish'd  Parts  and oh that I could give my Conscience the  Lye  in mentioning them even among the  first  and  least  fallen Part of the  Creation  itself and those of them too of the most elegant  Parts  and the strictest  Virtue  otherwise and which is still the most surprising of all even those too who are in all other Respects blameless Since I say the Case is so it will not be amiss to shew to the Evidence of a  Demonstration  the Folly as well as the Fruitlessness of such a Course A Fit of the  Colick  or of the  Vapours  a  FamilyMisfortune  a  casual Disappointment  the  Death  of a  Child  or of a  Friend  with the Assistance of the  Nurse  the  Midwife  and the next  Neighbour  often give  Rise  and become the weighty Causes of so fatal an Effect A little  Lowness  requires  Drops  which pass readily down under the Notion of  Physick    Drops  beget  Drams  and  Drams  beget more  Drams  'till they come to be without Weight and without Measure so that at last the miserable Creature suffers a true  Martyrdom  between its natural  Modesty  the great Necessity of concealing its Cravings and the still greater one of getting them satisfied  some how  Higher and more  severe Fits of  Hystericks    Tremors  and  Convulsions  begot by these bring forth farther  Necessity  upon  Necessity  of  Drops    Drams  and  Gills  'till at last a kind  Dropsy    nervous Convulsions  a  nervous Atrophy  or a  colloquative Diarrhaea  if not a  Fever  or a  Frenzy  set the  poor Soul  free It has very often raised in me the most melancholy  Reflexions  to see even the  Virtuous  and the  Sensible  bound in such Chains and Fetters as nothing less than  omnipotent Grace  or the  unrelenting Grave  could release them They were deaf to  Reason  and  Medicine  to their own  Experience  and even to the express Words of  Scripture  that says the  Drunkard shall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven  Did this bewitching  Poison  actually cure or relieve them from Time to Time something might be said to extenuate the  Folly  and  Frenzy  of such a Course But on the contrary it heightens and enrages all their Symptoms and  Sufferings  ever afterwards excepting the few Moments immediately after taking it down and every  Dram  begets the Necessity of two more to cure the ill  Effects  of the  first  and one Minutes Indolence they purchase with many Hours of greater  Pain  and  Misery  besides the making the  Malady    more incurable  Lowspiritedness  in itself is no Disease besides that there are  Remedies  in  Art  that will always relieve it so long as there is any  Oil  remaining in the  Lamp  and 'tis in vain to try to raise the  Dead Exercise    Abstinence  and proper  Evacuations  with  Time  and  Patience  will continually make it  tolerable  very often they will persectly cure it The running into  Drams  is giving up the whole at once for neither  Laudanum  nor  Arsenick  will kill more certainly although more quickly The Pretence of its being  Physick  or a present  Remedy  is trifling  Cordials  of any Kind even out of the  Apothecaries  Shops are but  Reprieves  for a Time to gain a  Respite  'till proper and extirpating  Remedies  can take Place and are never to be used twice the one immediately after the other but in the last Necessity And I can honestly say I never failed of relieving so as to make Life  tolerable    vapourish    hysterical  or  hypochondriacal  Persons who would be governed in their  Diet  by the Use of other proper  Means  if their was a  Fund  in  Life  and no  incurable  Disease complicated with  Lowness  Thus much the  Weight  of the Subject forced from one  more than this its  Disagreeableness  hinders me to say  §  Next to  Drams  no Liquor deserves more to be stigmatized and banished the Repasts of the  Tender    Valetudinary  and  Studious  than PUNCH 'Tis a Composition of such Parts as not one of them is  salutary  or kindly to such  Constitutions  except the pure Element in it The principal  Ingredient  is  Rum    Arrack    Brandy  or  Malt Spirits  as they are called all of them raised by the  Fire  from the  fermented Juices  of Plants brought from  Southern  Countries or which have longest born the  Heat  of the  Sun  in our own  Climate  And 'tis observable that every Thing that has past the  Fire  so that it has had due Time to divide and penetrate its Parts as far as it possibly can retains a  caustick    corrosive  and burning  Quality  ever afterwards This is evident from the  fiery  and  burning Touch  and  Taste  of newdrawn  Spirits  as also from the  burning  of  Limestone  which tho' extinguish'd by Boiling Water does ever after retain its heating and drying  Quality  as appears from the great Use of  LimeWater  in drying up all  humid  Sores when given inwardly by itself or compounded  with  sudorific  Woods and Roots and from its  Success  in outward Applications for the same Purposes And tho' Time may in some Measure get the better of this in its sensible and obvious Operations yet since  Water  is a grosser Body than  Fire  or  Flame  it never can penetrate it so far as quite to extinguish its inmost  Heat  especially if we consider that  Spirits  are but an  Accumulation  of fine  Salts  and light  Oil  compacted together into the smallest  Volume  the  first  whereof is so hard and solid as naturally to retain their Heat the longest into which  Water  cannot enter the other  to wit  the  Oyle  is so inflamable that it most readily receives  Heat  and  Fire  and defends the  Salts  from the Power of the  Water  over them And in the continued  Distillation  of Spirits this Action of the  Fire  is so strong as to reduce them to liquid  Flames  at last which will of themselves evaporate in visible  Flames  and  Fumes  The other principal Part of the  Composition  is the  Juice of Oranges  and  Lemons  And if we consider that a  Lemon  or  Orange  could never be transported  half Seas  over to us without rotting or spoiling if gathered when wholly  ripe  we should have no great Opinion of their  Juices  Every  Spanish  or  Portugal  Merchant can inform  us that they must be gathered  green  or at least a  Month  before they are  ripe  else they are not fit to be sent beyond the  Seas  The  SeaAir  and their being shut up  close  gives them that  golden yellow Colour  we so much admire The  Juice  of a  Crab Apple  of  unripe Grapes  or  Gooseberries  or even  good Juice  of  Sorrel  would come up at least to their Virtue of extinguishing the Heat of  Spirits  if not to their  Flavour  And how kindly a  Guest  such  Juices  would be to the  fine Fibres  of weak  Stomachs  and  Bowels  I leave every one to judge The Truth is all  fermenting  Juices such as these  eminently  are must be highly injurious to  weak Constitutions  for meeting with the  Crudities  in the  Bowels  they must raise a new  Battle  and  Colluctation  there and so must blow up the whole  Cavities  of the  human  Body with acrid  Fumes  and  Vapours  the great and sore Enemy of such Bowels And in the  West Indies  where from the Necessity of drinking much because of the Violence of the  Heat  and from the Want of proper  Liquors  there they are forced to drink much  PUNCH  tho'  Lemons  and  Oranges  be in their full Perfection they are universally afflicted with  Nervous  and  Mortal dryBellyaches    Palsies    Cramps  and  Convulsions  which cut them off in a few Days entirely owing to this  poisonous  Mixture  The  BathWater  is the only  Remedy  in such Cases whither they all hasten if they can get thither  alive  And here I have been inform'd of this  Fact  by Men of the  Profession  as well as their  Patients  who universally ascrib'd them to their drinking of  PUNCH  and  Spirituous Liquors  If  Acids  must be had without all peradventure the  Vinous  ones are the best and safest The  Romans  tho' they had the vegetable  Acids  in perfection made very little Use of them but in  Cookery  where the  Quantity  of the  Poison  was so small as not to do sufficient Harm to forbid their using them for the Sake of the exquisite Relish they gave their  Sauces  and the constant Drink of the lower  Souldiery  was  Vinegar  and  Water  which they found of excellent Use both as it prevented  Fevers    Plagues  and  Putrefaction  and also as it gave an  Energy  to the unactive  Element  and hindered it from  lodging  in the Body Hence also the great Use of  Oxymel  and  Oxycrate  that is of  Vinegar  with  Honey  and with  Water  among all the antient  Physicians  And indeed whenever  they prescrib'd an  Acid  they very prudently join'd a Corrective with it both to promote its  good  and to prevent it's  bad  Effects The two remaining  Ingredients  are  Sugar  and  Water  and these I will give up to the  PunchDrinkers  and allow them all the Benefit of them they can bring to this  Composition  Yet it will still have  Malignity  sufficient remaining to be held in Detestation at least for any great  Use  or in any great  Quantity  for some  Poisons  are so only by their  Quantity  by those  tender  and  valetudinary  Persons who value  Health  and  Life  The  Strong  the  Voluptuous  and the  Abandoned  need no  Advice  at least they will take none I could never see any Temptation for any one in their Senses to indulge in this  Heathenish  Liquor but that it makes it's Votaries the soonest and all of a sudden the deepest  Drunk  holds them longest in the Fit and deprives them the most entirely of the Use of their  Intellectual Faculties    and Bodily Organs  of any Liquor whatsoever It is likest  Opium  both in it's Nature and in the Manner of its Operation and nearest  Arsenick  in it's  deleterious  and  poisonous  Qualities And so I leave it to them  Who knowing this will yet drink on and die  §  As to Malt Liquors they are not much in Use excepting  small Beer  with any but  Mechanicks  and  Foxhunters  The  French  very justly call them  BarleySoop  I am well satisfied a  weak Stomach  can as readily and with less pain digest  Pork  and  PeaseSoop  as  Yorkshire  or  Nottingham  Ale They make excellent  Birdlime  and when  simmer'd  some time over a gentle Fire make the most sticking and the best  Plaister  for  old Strains  that can be contriv'd Even the  smallBeer  that is commonly drank at  London  if it be not  well Boiled  very  Clear  and of a  due Age  must be hurtful to Persons of  weak Nerves  and  slow Digestion  For  fermenting  again in the  alimentary  Channels it will fill the whole  Cavities  of the Body with Windy  Fumes  and  Vapours  which will at Length play odd  Pranks  in a  crasy  Constitution In Fine the  Valetudinary    Studious  and  Contemplative  must be contented with a  Pint  of  middling    light  Wine a Day one half with and the other without Water  §  Since the Time  foreign Luxury  has been brought to it's Perfection here  there are a kind of Liquors in Use among the better Sort which some great  Doctors  have Condemn'd by  Bell    Book  and  Candle  and others have as extravagantly commended I mean  Coffee    Tea  and  Chocolate  For my own Part I take all their  Virtue  to consist in  Custom  and all their  Harm  in  Excess  As to  Coffee  it is a meer  Calx  or a Kind of burnt  Horse Bean  but lighter on the Stomach and of somewhat a better Flavour The  Turks  use  it  and  Opium  instead of  Brandy  But the Plea that some make for running into Excess in it from this  Mahometan  Custom is altogether weak and groundless for those that do so there suffer by it as we do here And those that Debauch in it turn  Stupid    Feeble  and  Paralitick  by it especially when they join  Opium  with it as they frequently do as those who wallow in these do here and are as much Despis'd and Expos'd by serious Persons as our  Topers  and  Brandyswillers  are here A Dish or two of  Coffee  with a little  Milk  to soften it in raw or damp Weather or on a  Waterish  and  Flegmatick  Stomach is not only innocent but a present  Relief  But 'tis as ridiculous and perhaps more hurtful at least in thin and  dry  Habits to dabble in it two or  three Times every Day as it would be for such to drink nothing but scalding  LimeWater  There are two Kinds of  Tea  in Use  Green  and  Bohea  Mr  Cuningham  who liv'd several Years in  China  a very  learned  and  accurate  Person  Vide Phil Collect  informs us that they are both gathered from the same Shrub but at different Seasons of the Year and that the  Bohea  is Gather'd in the Spring and is dried in the  Sun  the  Green  at the  Fire  But I suspect and not without Authority that besides these Differences in drying some  Infusion  of another Plant or Earth perhaps such a one as that of  Japan Earth  or  Catechu  must be poured on some sorts of  Bohea Tea  to give it the  Softness    Flavour  and  Heaviness  on the Stomach it has whereby it becomes a meer  Drug  and wants the natural  Simplicity  of  Green Tea  which when light and drank neither too Strong nor too Hot I take to be a very proper  Diluent  when soften'd with a little Milk to cleanse the  alimentary  Passages and wash off the  Scorbutick  and  Urinous Salts  for a Breakfast to those who live full and free as also it or  Tea  made of a slic'd  Orange  or  Lemon  is one of the best promoters of  Digestion  after a full Meal or when one is adry between Meals and much more safe and effectual than  Drams  or strong  Cordials  which are commonly used for that Purpose Some Persons of weak tender  Nerves  fall into  Lowness  and  Trembling  upon using either of these Liquors with any Freedom from their too great  Quantity  or their  Irritation  on the tender and delicate  Fibres  of the Stomach Such ought carefully to avoid and abstain from them as from  Drams  and  Drops  But I can never be of their Opinion who ascribe the Frequency of  Scurvy    Vapours    Lowspiritedness  and  nervous  Distempers now to what they were in the Days of our  Forefathers  to the Custom of Drinking more frequently and freely of these  foreign Infusions  The Cause is not  adequate  to the Effect nor indeed has any  Analogy  to or  Connexion  with it We know that warm Water will most of any Thing promote and assist  Digestion  in weak Stomachs and tender  Nerves  And by this alone I have seen several such Persons recover to a Miracle when  cold Mineral  Waters  Bitters    Cordials  and  Drams  have done rather Hurt than Good And  Tea  is but an  Infusion  in Water of an  innocent  Plant  Innocent  I say because we find  by its Taste it has neither  poisonous    deleterious  nor  acrimonious  Qualities and we are certain from it's Use in the Countries it comes from which are larger than most of  Europe  that they receive no Damage from it but on the contrary that it promotes both  Digestion  and  Perspiration  The Argument from its  relaxing  the Coats of the Stomach and Bowels by its  Heat  is of no force For unless it be drunk much hotter than the Blood itself it can do no hurt that way And we see the  Bath  Guides who dabble in Water almost as  hot  as  Tea  is ever drunk a great Part of the Day and for one half of the Year at least are no ways injured by it except when they drink  strong Liquors  too freely to quench the Thirst it raises However I should advise those who drink  Tea  plentifully not to drink it much  hotter  than  bloodwarm  whereby they will receive all its  Benefit  and be secure against all the Harm it can possibly do As to  Chocolate  I am of opinion it is too hot and heavy for  valetudinary  Persons and those of weak  Nerves  I have before observed that  Nuts  pass through the  alimentary  Passages untouched and tho' they may part with some of their more  volatile  Particles yet I doubt if they can afford  much nourishment to Persons of  weak Digestions  Some say  Chocolate  gives them an Appetite the meaning of which may be that when they have a good Appetite for their  Breakfast  it is not unlikely it may continue all the Day But I am of opinion 'tis a  false  and  hysterical Appetite  such as sharp Wines and sharp Humours in the Stomach give For  fat  and  oily  Things such as all Nuts are are hard to digest and lie long in the Stomach for reasons I have already explain'd It may lubricate and sheath against the  Irritation  of  salt  and  sharp Humours  in the Bowels and therefore may be good in the  Colicks  and  Gravel  of those of strong and stout Digestion but can never be good Food for those of  weak Nerves  and  poor Constitutions  Nothing is so light and easy to the Stomach most certainly as the  Farinaceous  or mealy  Vegetables  such as  Pease    Beans    Millet    Oats    Barly    Rye    Wheat    Sago    Rice    Potatoes  and the like of some of which on  Milk  or  Water  I should ever advise the  Valetudinary  and those of  weak Nerves  to make their two  lesser  or  secondary  Meals  Tobacco  is another  foreign Weed  much in use here in  Britain  though not among the  best  yet among the  middle  and inferiour Ranks of the People For those of gross and  Phlegmatick  Constitutions who abound in  serous  and watry Humours who are subject to  Coughs    Catarrhs  and  asthmatick  Indispositions who labour under violent  Toothachs  or are troubled with  Rheums  in their  Eyes  who have cold and  waterish  Stomachs and live fully and freely both  Smoaking  and  Chewing  is a very beneficial Evacuation drawing off  superfluous  Humours  Crudities  and cold  Phlegm  provided they carefully avoid swallowing the  Smoak  or the  Juice  and drink nothing but rinse their Mouths with some watry Liquor after it and spit it out But to  thin    meagre  and  hectick  Constitutions it is highly pernicious and destructive heating their Blood drying their Solids and defrauding the Food of that  Saliva  which is so absolutely necessary towards  Concoction Snuffing  the Leaves or the grosser  Cut  in a Morning will readily promote a  Flux  of  Rheum  by the Glands of the Nose and will be of good use to clear the  Head  and the  Eyes  But the ridiculous Custom of perpetually sucking in  sophisticated  Powders and other Foreign  Drugs  sold for  Snuff  cannot but be prejudicial both to the  Eyes  and even to the  Stomach  at least if we believe the Reports of those who say they have brought it up from thence  §  I have endeavour'd to assist the  Reader  with some  Observations  and  Reflexions  to enable him towards determining the  Quantity  and  Quality  of his  solid Food  necessary either to prevent or cure  chronical  Distempers It may not be amiss here to make some Reflexions also on the fit Proportion of  Drink  proper for that purpose As the  Food  is so must  that  be various and uncertain with regard to the  Age    Size    Labour  and  Constitution  of the Person and the  Season  of the Year I have offer'd to limit the  Quantity  of strong Liquors fittest to preserve Health and lengthen out Life in general to a  Pound  or  Pint  and that of the  middling  Kind But the  Sickly  the  Aged  and those who would cure a  chronical  Distemper must even abate of  this  Quantity The only remaining Question is about the Quantity of  Water  or watry Liquors proper to be mix'd with this  strong  Liquor or drunk by itself For in this also though in itself harmless and innocent yet there is a  Choice  and Preference because too much Water will only serve to  distend  and  swell  up the Vessels and wash off some of the finer and more nutritious parts of the  Chyle  and too little will not be sufficient to dilute the  solid Food  or to make the Chyle  thin  and  fluid  enough to circulate through the  fine  and  small  Vessels I will suppose my  Patient  to deal in no other  Cookery  but  Roasting  and  Boiling  and that he eats only  fresh  Meat  Boiling animal  Food draws more of the  rank    strong  Juices from it and leaves it less  nutritive  more  diluted    lighter  and  easier  of Digestion  Roasting  on the other hand leaves it fuller of the  strong  nutritive Juices  harder  to digest and wanting more  Dilution  Those therefore who must have full grown and  adult animal  Food ought to eat it boiled and  well  boiled too if their Digestion be but weak They who can live on  young  animal Food which is best for weak Stomachs ought to eat it  roasted  but must lessen the Quantity in respect of the same Food  boiled  but they must dilute it more For as  roast  Meat has a better Flavour and more Nourishment so it lies less  flabby  on the Stomach and does not so readily  slip  from or disappoint the  Action  of  Grinding  which has some share in  Digestions  both  primary  and  subsequent  But it will want more  Dilution  with a watry  Menstruum  to soften its more  rigid  and  crisp  Fibres If therefore the whole Weight of the solid Food in twenty four Hours be supposed a  Pound  and a  Half    then  three Pounds  of Liquor that is one of strong Liquor and two of some aqueous Fluid will in a Medium be sufficient to dilute it abundantly For thus there will be two Particles of a Fluid to one solid Particle which abating the solid Parts thrown off by  Siege  will suffice to make the  Chyle  abundantly thin to circulate through all the  fine  Channels whose  Diameters  are  larger  than  that  of the solid Particle the principal End of its  Thinness  and  Fluidity  More than this would but  distend  the Vessels and carry off the  finer  Parts of the  Chyle  by  Water  or  Perspiration  for we constantly find  both these  encreased by an  overdose  of Fluids And less would not sufficiently dilute their Food I should advise those therefore who have  weak  Stomachs or  relaxed Nerves  to mix their Wine with the abovenamed quantity of boiled Water with a burnt Crust at least  Bloodwarm  and to drink it after their Meal is over if they can do it with ease rather than in the Time of Eating For the more  spirituous  and most nourishing Parts of the Food will readily run off without much  Dilution  and it will be the  grosser  and  harder  remaining Part that will want it most And if some time after their great Meal they find their Stomach  loaded  the Food rising  hard Belching    Heartburning  or much  Yawning  to swill down and dilute it with milkwarm light  Green Tea  or warm Water rather than to run to  Drams  and  Cordials  the usual but most pernicious  Antidote  in such Cases And upon great and heavy  Oppression  much trouble and great struggle in the Digestion to have recourse to  Carduus  or  CamomileFlower Tea  to bring it up rather than to trespass in these  poisonous  and  caustick  Liquors which though they may at present lessen the suffering and hurry on the  firstConcoction  yet make them dearly pay for it when the  unconcocted  load of  Crudities  comes to pass by  Siege  or  Perspiration  either in  Colicks    Gripes    Vapours  and  Oppression  of Spirits or by a general  Disability  and  Rheumatick  Stitches and Pains  §  Upon the Head of  Cordials  mentioned in one of the foregoing  Articles  I cannot forbear setting down  one  whose Virtues and Efficacy I have long tried and have never found it fail when any thing would succeed And I recommend it to be kept by them to all  those  who are liable to  low Spirits    Faintings    Oppressions    Sickness  at the Stomach  Headachs  and  Vapours  and also to those who wanting to exert themselves  in any business of consequence need a  Flow of Spirits  for some short time for that purpose or indeed upon any sudden accident arising of its own accord out of the Habit itself I think it a kind of an  universal Remedy  but never to be used but upon such occasions because Use may weaken it if not extinguish its Vertue 'Tis thus  Take of simple  ChamomileFlower Water  six Ounces  Compound Gentian  and  Wormwood Waters  each an Ounce and a Half Compound Spirit of  Lavender    sal Volatile    Tincture of Castor  and  Gum Ammoniack  dissolved in some simple Water each two Drams Tincture of  Snakeweed  and Tincture of the  Species Diambrae  each a Dram the  Chymical Oils  of  Lavender    Juniper  and  Nutmeg  each ten Drops mixed with a Bit of the Yolk of an Egg to make the whole uniform  Assafetida  and  Camphire  in a Rag each half a Dram But these may be left out by those to whom they are disagreeable  Two three or four Spoonfuls of this is a present Help in such Cases It will keep six Months good  General Rules for Health and Long Life drawn from the Head of MEAT and DRINK  THE great  Rule  of Eating and Drinking for  Health  is to adjust the  Quality  and  Quantity  of our Food to our  digestive  Powers The  Quality  may be judged by the following  Rules  Those  Substances  that consist of the  grossest  Parts are hardest of  Digestion  the constituent  Particles  coming into more  Contacts  and consequently adhering more firmly  These  Substances  whose Parts are brought together with the greatest  Force  cohere proportionably closer than those that come together with a smaller  i e  Force  Momentum    Salts  are very hard to be separated because united by plain  Surfaces  under which they are always comprehended And in the last Stages of the  Circulation  where it is slower  shoot  readily into larger  Clusters  and so are harder to be driven out of the  Habit  From these we may easily infer that Those  Vegetables  and  Animals  that come soonest to their full  Growth  are easier of Digestion than those that are longer of attaining  the State of  Maturity  Those that are the  smallest  of their Kind than the  biggest  Those of a  dry    fleshy  and  fibrous Substance  than the  oily    fat  and  glutinous  Those of a  white  Substance than those of a more  flaming  Colour Those of a  mild    soft  and  sweet  than those of a  strong    poignant    aromatical  or  hot  Taste  LandAnimals  than  SeaAnimals  Those  Animals  that live on  Vegetables  or other  light  Food than those that live on other  Animals  or hard and  heavy  Food The Nourishment Nature has appointed for young  Animals  is lighter than the Flesh of these  Animals  themselves  All  cramm'd  Poultry and  stallfed  Cattle and even  Vegetables  forced by hot Beds tend more to  Putrefaction  and consequently are more unfit for  human  Food than those brought up in the natural Manner    Plaindressed  Food is easier of Digestion than what is  pickled    salted    baked    smoaked  or any Way  highseasoned    Strong  Men those of  large  Stature and much  Labour  and the Inhabitants of a  cold  and clear Air require  more  Food than  Women    Children  the  Weak  the  Sedentary  and the  Aged  and those that live in a  warmer  Climate or  grosser Air  Nothing conduces more to  Health  and  Long Life  than  Abstinence  and  plain  Food with due  Labour  Where  Exercise  is wanting as in  studious  Persons there is the greater Need of  Abstinence  for these  Ounces  of  animal  and of  vegetable  Food in Hours is sufficient  Most  chronical  Diseases proceed from  Repletion  as appears from their being cured by  Evacuation    Tender  Persons ought to use as much  Abstinence  as they possibly can And if they neglect it their only Relief is from frequent  stomachick  and  FamilyPurges  A  plain  Rule for judging of the  Quantity  is not to eat so much as indisposes for  Business  A more  sensible  and  readier  one is first by  Experience  to find out how much fits one so as to be  lightsome  and  healthy  under it and ever after to judge the  Quantity  by the  Eye    Nature  requiring therein no  mathematical  Exactness    Pork  and  Fish  are not fit Food for the  Studious  and the  Tender    Water  is the most natural and wholesome of all  Drinks  quickens the Appetite and strengthens the  Digestion  most    Strong  and  spirituous  Liquors freely indulged become a certain tho' a slow  Poison  There is no Danger in leaving them off all at  once  the  Plea  for continuing them being false and groundless  The best  strong Liquor  for  weak  and  studious  People is  Wine  the best  Quantity  a  Pint  in Hours and the best Way of drinking it is three Glasses  with  and three  without Water  The  middling    light  Wines  fully ripe  and of a  due Age  are preferable to the  strong Wines  Strong Liquors do not prevent the Mischiefs of a  Surfeit  nor carry it off so safely as  Water  tho' they seem to give present  Relief  The frequent  Use  of  Spirits  in  Drams  and  Cordials  is so far from curing  Lowspiritedness  that it increases it and brings on more  fatal  Disorders  And even when they are diluted with Water in PUNCH the Quantity taken down at once and the Addition of a corroding  Acid  produce equally  pernicious  Effects in human Constitutions    Malt Liquors  excepting clear small Beer of a due Age are extremely hurtful to  tender  and  studious  Persons    Coffee  is only an  Infusion  of a kind of  Calx  and has the Effects of an  absorbent  Medicine and so may be of some Service to  watry Stomachs  if  moderately  used    Green Tea  is a good  Diluter  of the Food as it is an agreeable  warm    small  Liquor But  Bohea  is too  heavy  for the  Stomach    Chocolate  as all Nuts else is so  heavy  and  hard  of  Digestion  that it can  never be fit  for the Stomachs of  weak  and  tender  People    Smoaking Tobacco  without  drinking  after it  Chewing  or  Snuffing  the gross cut  Leaf  in a Morning are useful to  flegmatick  Constitutions but to  dry  and  lean  Habits they are  pernicious Snuff  is just  good for nothing  at all  The proper  Quantity  of  watry Liquors  in Hours to those that live regularly is  two Pints  as that of  strong  Liquor is  one  Pint which is best drank  warm  and rather  after  than in the Time of  Eating  The Form of a  Cordial  fit to be kept in private Families as a present and certian Relief for sudden  Qualms    Faintness    Sickness  or  low Spirits  but never to be taken but in Case of Necessity  CHAP III Of SLEEPING and WATCHING  §  THE next general  Head  in order is our  Sleeping  and  Watching  All Bodies by their Actions upon one another and by the Action of the circumambient Bodies are liable to be impaired and wasted And all  animal  Bodies from an  active  and selfmoving  Principle  within them as well as from the  Rubs  of Bodies without them are constantly throwing off some of their superfluous and decayed Parts so that animal Bodies are in a perpetual  Flux  To restore this  Decay  and  Wasting  of  animal  Bodies  Nature  has wisely made alternate  Periods  of  Labour  and  Rest    Sleeping  and  Watching    necessary  to our Being the one for the  active  Employments of Life to provide for and take in the  Materials  of our  Nourishment  the other to apply those  Materials  to the proper wasted Parts and to supply  the  Expences  of Living And it seems as improper in the  Order of Nature  to disturb the  animal Functions  in the time of  Sleep  by any other Employment than that of the  secondary Concoctions  as they are called  i e  the applying the Nourishment to the decayed Parts to  recruit  the Blood  perfect  the  Secretions  and to lay up plenty of  Spirits  or to speak more  Philosophically  to restore the weakned  Tone  of  nervous Fibres  that is in short to restore the  Decays  of  Watching  and  Action  This I say is as improper as it would be were it possible to  eat  or  drink  or make provision for the Necessities of Life in the time of  Sleeping  From hence is evident the  Absurdity  of  heavy    various  and  luxurious  Suppers or of going to Rest till  many  Hours after such a Meal which must otherwise break in upon the  Order  of  Nature  and the due and appointed Times of  Sleeping  and  Watching  Wherefore I advise the  Valetudinary  the  Studious  and the  Contemplative  either to make no Suppers or only of  vegetable  Food and to take a due Time for  Watching  after them  §  There is nothing more certain than that abstracting from  acute  Cases  our  Sleep  is  sound    sweet  and  refreshing  according as the alimentary  Organs  are easy quiet and clean If any one not suffering under any disease is disturbed in his Sleep 'tis certain his Stomach is filled with  Food  or  Crudities  or his  Guts  filled with  Wind    Choler  or  superfluous Chyle  And those restless Nights and the difficulty of going to Sleep which are generally ascribed to  Vapours  are entirely owing to these Causes though they be not so  strong  as to become sensible for then  Pain  is added to  Watching  and they are felt And upon complaints of such restless Nights I never once failed upon enquiry of finding the true Cause in the  Diet  of the preceding Day or of some few Days before and constantly have discovered that some error in  Eating  and  Drinking  either in  Quantity  or  Quality  has produced them I have been astonished to see  hypochondriacal  and  hysterical  People restless all Night tossing and tumbling till towards Morning then  dropping  asleep till late Hours awake  heavy    oppressed  and  unrefreshed  complain of being  hagridden    tired  and  wearied  as if they had been  whip'd    spurr'd    lashed  and  beaten  thro' all the  Watches  of the Night rise with  foul Mouths  and white Tongue Belchings  Yawnings Coughing Spitting or Reaching and Heaving without  Appetite    Spirits  or  Life  all the Daytime begin to live and breath become  cheerful  and hungry about ten eleven or twelve a clock at Night eat a  hearty    various  and  luxurious  Supper drink a  cheeruping  Cup of the best become as merry as  Crickets  and long to sit up later at last tumble to Bed and repeat the same  Farce  over again The Reason of all this Complaint is the Load on the Stomach that will not suffer them to rest till 'tis got off The sharp and crude Humours  twitching  and  twinging  the  nervous Fibres  and Coats of the  Bowels  become like so many  Needles  and  Pins  constantly running through them though not always with sensible pain The  unconcocted  Chyle stopping or circulating  slowly    first  in the Bowels  then  in the smallest  Vessels  begets these  Convulsions    Flatus    NightMares  and  Oppressions  of  Spirits  So that the secondary Digestions are not over till next Evening hence their want of  Appetite  And when these are finished their  Stomachs  come and their  Spirits  flow and thus the perpetual  Round  is carried on Did they but follow the  Dictates of Nature  go to Bed for some days with a  light Vegetable    or no  Supper  at all and bear the Inconveniences thence arising their  Appetites  would come in due season and they would quickly find the Truth of the Aphorism of the  Schola Salernitana  i e  That your Sleep may be sweet let your Supper be light  Somnus ut sit levis sit tibi Canoe brevis  §  The Seasons for  Sleeping  and  Watching  which Nature seems to point out to us at least in these our  Climates  near the  Tropick  are the  Vicissitudes  of  Day  and  Night  Those  Damps    Vapours  and  Exhalations  that are drawn up into the  higher Regions  and are so rarified by the Heat and Action of the  Sun  as to become  innocent  or very weak in the Daytime are  condensed    sink  low near the  Surface  of the Earth and are perpetually dropping down in the Night Season and consequently must be  injurious  to those  tender  Persons that  unnaturally  watch in that Season and must necessarily obstruct the  Perspiration  which the  Activity of Watching  and the  Motion  of  Labour  promotes I have already shewn that our Bodies  suck  and  draw  into them the good or bad qualities of the  circumambient Air  through the Mouths of all the  perspiratory Ducts  of the Skin And if we were to view an  animal  Body with a proper Glass it would appear with an  Atmosphere  quite round it like the  Steam  of a boiling Pot Now we may easily conceive what injury a  Constitution  may receive not only by stopping such a perpetual  Discharge  of  Superfluities  but also by forceing into the  Habit  by the  Air  's  Weight  and  Pressure  those  noxious Fumes  and  Vapours  that are perpetually falling near the  Surface  of the Earth in the Nighttime Your true  Topers  are so sensible of this that by Observation they have gathered it to be more safe for their  Health  and better for prolonging their  Lives  to get  drunk  betimes and go to Bed than to sit up and be  sober  §  On the contrary the  Heat  of the  Sun  in the Daytime by its  Action  on human Bodies the very  Light  and free  Air  and the  Motions  of things about us disturbing the Quiet of the Air must necessarily disorder the  equable  Course of the  Perspiration  the  Tenour  of the  secondary Concoctions  and the  Tranquillity  of the  Spirits  so necessary to  Rest  and  Quiet  So that nothing seems more directly pointed out to us by  Nature  than the  Day  for  Labour  and the  Night  for  Rest  And this without taking in the Consideration of the Necessity of the  Sun  's Light for the ends of  Labour  and providing the Necessaries of Life Some  Animals  that are exceeding tender are directed by  Nature  to alternate  Periods  of  Watching  and  Rest  not twice in Hours but twice in the Year  viz Summer  and  Winter  such as  Swallows    Bats  and many sorts of  Insects  who sleep all the  Winter  and watch all the  Summer  So consistent is  Nature  in appointing the  brightest  and most  enlightened  Parts of our Lives for  Action  and the  darkest  and most  inclement  for  Rest  Not but that  robust Constitutions  as well as  Animals  fitted by Nature for different ways of living may by Custom get the better of these  natural Appointments  But I write for the  Valetudinary  the  Studious  and the  Contemplative  §  I advise all such if they would preserve their  Health  and  lengthen  out their Days to avoid as much as is possible  evening Dews    nocturnal Studies  and  unseasonable Watching  in  Summer  to go to Bed with the  Sun  and in  Winter  to  rise at least by  Break of Day  Those who live  temperately  will necessarily  Sleep  but  little  But to recompence that their  Sleep  will be much more  sound    refreshing  and fruitful of Cheerfulness and  free Spirits  than that of those who live more  freely  For as I have before said the  Quantity of Sleep  will always be in proportion to the  Quantity  of  Eating  and  Drinking Valetudinary    Studious  and  Contemplative  People ought to go to Bed by  eight    nine  or  ten  at farthest and rise by  four    five  or  six  by which they will have  eight Hours  a Bed and that is sufficient for any Person not under an  acute  or the sharp Fits of à  Chronical  Distemper  §  Nothing can be more prejudicial to  tender  Constitutions  studious  and  contemplative  Persons than lying long a Bed or  lolling  and  soaking  in  Sheets  any time after one is distinctly awake or has slept a due and reasonable Time It necessarily  thickens  the Juices  enervates  the Solids and  weakens  the Constitution A free open  Air  is a kind of a  cold Bath  especially after rising out of a warm Bed and consequently makes the  Circulation  brisker and more compleat and  braces  up the Solids which lying a Bed  dissolves  and  soaks  in  Moisture  The  erect Posture  and the  Activity  of Watching make the  Perspiration  more plentiful and the gross  Evacuations  more readily thrown off This is evident from the  Appetite  and  Hunger  those that rise  early  feel beyond that which they get by lying  long  a Bed Add to all these the Influence of the  fresh    benign  Morning  Air  the retreating of all the  noxious  Damps and  Vapours  of the Night together with the Clouds and Heaviness that are thrown upon the  Brain  from Sleep and lastly that  Cheerfulness  and  Alacrity  that is felt by the Approach or Presence of that  glorious Luminary  the  Sun  which adds a new Force to the  Heart  and a  Spur  to the Spirits  §  All  Nations  and  Ages  have agreed that the  morning Season  is the proper Time for  speculative  Studies and those Employments that most require the  Faculties  of the  Mind  For then the  Stock  of the Spirits is undiminished and in its greatest Plenty the  Head  is clear and serene the  Passions  are quieted and forgot the  Anxiety  and Inquietude that the  Digestions  beget in the  nervous System  in most tender Constitutions and the  Hurry  the Spirits are under after the great  Meal are settled and  wrought off  I should advise therefore those who are of a weak relaxed State of  Nerves  who are subject to  hypochondraical  or  hysterical  Disorders whose Professions lead them to much Use of their  intellectual Faculties  or who would indulge  speculative  Studies to go early to Bed and to rise betimes to employ their morning Hours in these  Exercises  till eleven a Clock then to take some agreeable  Breakfast  of  vegetable  Food to go on with their  Studies  and  Professions  till  three    four  or  five  as their Spirits will hold out and then to take their  great Meal  of  animal  Food all the rest of the Day to throw off all  Study  and  Thought  divert themselves agreeably in some innocent  Amusement  with some gentle bodily  Exercise  and as soon as the  Digestion  is over to retire and provide for going to Bed without any farther supplies except it be a Glass of fair Water or warm SackWhey But the  Aged  and  Sickly  must go sooner to Bed and lye longer because  Age  and  Sickness  break rest and the stiffen'd and hardened Limbs of the Antient become more  pliant  and  relaxed  by much Sleep a  supine  Posture and the  Warmth  of the Bed  Rules for Health and Long Life drawn from the Head of SLEEP and WATCHING  THE  Valetudinary  the  Sedentary  and the  Studious  should eat very light or no  Supper  if any it ought to be  vegetable  Food neither ought they to go soon to  Bed  after any  Supper  whatsoever  Going to  Bed  on a  full Stomach  and  Wind  and  Crudities  somewhere in the in the  alimentary  Passages is the Cause of the want of due  Rest  which is  sound  and  refreshing  always in  Proportion  to the  Emptiness  and  Cleanness  of these  Passages  and their  Vacation  from their proper Office of  Digestion  And this is the Cause of the Want of  kindly and refreshing Rest  in  hypochondriacal  and  hysterical  People    Watching  by Night and  Sleeping  by Day is of the most pernicious Consequence to  Health  and  Long Life  and plainly contrary to the Indications of  Nature  and the  Constitutions  of our Bodies  The  Valetudinary    Sedentary  and  Studious  ought carefully to avoid evening  Dews  nocturnal  Studies  and unseasonable  Watching  go to Bed by  eight    nine  or  ten  and rise proportionably by  four    five  or  six  unless actually under a  Fit  of Sickness  Nothing is more prejudicial to  tender  Constitutions than lying  long  a Bed indulging a  lethargical  and drowsy Sleep or  lolling  or  loitering  awake as appears by their  Heaviness  and want of  Appetite  upon doing so and their good  Stomachs    Cheerfullness  and  Freedom  of  Spirits  when they rise  early  The most advantagious manner for the  Tender    Sedentary  and  Studious  to bestow their Time on account both of their  Health  and  Studies  is to go  early  to Bed rise  betimes  go about their Studies till  eleven  taking a light  vegetable  Breakfast prosecute them till about  four  in the Afternoon then to take their great Meal of  animal  Food and after that to employ the rest of their Time in some  innocent Amusement  or gentle bodily  Exercise  to retire betimes to prepare for going to Bed taking no farther Nourishment except a Draught of Water or warm  SackWhey  which will be particularly useful to those who labour under  Stone  and  Gravel  CHAP IV Of EXERCISE and QUIET  §  WE proceed in the next Place to the Consideration of  Exercise  and  Quiet  the due  Regulation  of which is almost as necessary to  Health  and  Long Life  as  Food  itself Whether we were so made before the  Fall  as to live in  intire  Health in a rigidly  sedentary  and  contemplative  Life is a  Speculation  of no great  Consequence  nor easily determined in our present  Situation  for there is no certain  Analogy  between Things as they now are and as they might have been then As there happen'd an intire  Revolution  in the  Complexion  and  Qualities  of the  Minds  of the  First Pair  so to me there appear to be evident  Indications  of a designed Change and  Alteration  of the  material World  and the Nature of the  Animals  and  Vegetables  which subsist on this  Globe  from what they were when GOD pronounced  every Thing  Good  that he had made Nor seem the  Coelestial  Bodies to have escaped so far as they regard us Whatever be in this the Passage where God tells  Adam    Gen  chap iii  v    That in the Sweat of his Brow he shall eat Bread  seems to be the Injunction of a  salutary  Penance that is Not merely a  Punishment  but also a  Remedy  against the Disorders his Body would be liable to in this  new  State of the Creation and against the poisonous Effects of the  Forbidden Tree  he had eaten the Fruit of I am the more confirmed in this Belief that I observe the  absolute  Necessity of  Labour  and  Exercise  to preserve the Body any Time in due plight to maintain  Health  and lengthen out  Life  For let whatsoever  Diet  be pursued however adjusted both in  Quantity  and  Quality  let whatever  Evacuations  be used to lessen the  Malady  or any  i e  Equivalent  Succedaneum  be proposed to prevent the ill Effects our Bodies are so made and the  Animal Oeconomy  now so contrived that without due  Labour  and  Exercise  the  Juices  will thicken the  Joints  will stiffen the  Nerves  will relax and on these Disorders  Chronical Distempers  and a crazy old  Age  must ensue Nor is this necessary only in the  colder  Climates and where the Food is  gross  but even in the  warmest  Climates and where the Food is  lightest  For though the  Warmth  of the Air may keep the  Perspiration  free and open or rather where it is very great promote  Sweating  yet at the same time and by Consequence it will  thicken  the Fluids and  relax  the Fibres to prevent both which  Exercise  is absolutely necessary but in such a Climate it ought to be gone about in the Cool of the Day And tho'  light Food  may  in a great measure  prevent the  Thickening  of the Fluids yet it cannot do it  sufficiently  without Exercise nor can it  at all  keep the Fibres in due  Tension  for to that purpose Exercise is absolutely necessary Nay the  joint  Power of  warm  Air and  light  Food cannot supply the Place of Exercise in keeping the  Joints pliant  and  moveable  and preserving them from growing  resty  and  stiff  §  I have sometimes also indulg'd a Conjecture that  Animal  Food and  Made  or  Artificial  Liquors in the  Original  Frame of our Nature and Design of our  Creation  were not intended for  Human Creatures  They seem to me neither to have these strong and fit  Organs  for digesting them at least such as  Birds  and  Beasts  of  Prey  have who live on  Flesh  nor naturally to have those  voracious  and  brutish  Appetites that require  Animal  Food and strong Liquors to satisfy them nor those  cruel  and  hard  Hearts or those  diabolical  Passions which could easily suffer them to tear and destroy their  Fellow  Creatures at least not in the  first  and  early  Ages before  every Man had corrupted his Way  and God was forced to exterminate the whole Race by an universal Deluge and was also obliged that the  Globe  of the  Earth  might not from the long Lives of its Inhabitants become a  Hell  and a  Habitation  for incarnate  Devils  to shorten their Lives from or Years to He wisely foresaw that  Animal Food  and  Artificial Liquors  would naturally contribute towards this  End  and indulg'd or permitted the  Generation  that was to plant the  Earth  again after the  Flood  the Use of these for  Food  knowing that tho' it would shorten the  Lives  and  plate  a  Scourge  of  Thorns  for the Backs  of the  Lazy  and  Voluptuous  it would be cautiously avoided by those who knew it was their  Duty  and  Happiness  to keep their Passions  low  and their  Appetites  in Subjection And this very  Aera  of the  Flood  is that mentioned in  Holy Writ  for the Indulgence of  Animal Food  and  Artificial Liquors  after the  Trial  had been made how insufficient alone a  Vegetable Diet  which was the first  Food  appointed for  Human kind  immediately after their  Creation  was in the  long Lives  of  Men  to restrain their  Wickedness  and  Malice  and after finding that nothing but  shortning  their  Duration  could possibly prevent the  Evil  'Tis true there is scarce a Possibility of preventing the destroying of  Animal  Life as Things are now constituted since  Insects breed  and  nestle  in the very  Vegetables  themselves and we scarce ever devour a  Plant  or  Root  wherein we do not destroy innumerable  Animalcules  But besides what I have said of  Nature  's being quite altered and changed from what was  originally  intended there is a great  Difference  between  destroying  and  extinguishing  an  Animal  Life which otherwise might subsist many Years by  Choice  and  Election  to gratify our  Appetites    and indulge  Concupiscence  and the  Casual  and  Unavoidable  crushing of those who perhaps otherwise would die within the  Day  or at most the  Year  and obtain but an inferior kind of  Existence  and  Life  at best Whatever be in this  Conjecture  'tis evident to those who understand the  Animal Oeconomy  and the  Frame  of  Human  Bodies together with the  History  both of those who have lived  Abstemiously  and of those who have lived  Freely  that  indulging  in flesh  Meats  and strong  Liquors    inflames  the  Passions  and  shortens  Life begets  Chronical  Distempers and a  Decrepit  Age as the  History  of the Life of  Cornaro  manifests to a Demonstration  §  Of all the  Exercises  that are or may be used for Health such as  Walking    Riding  a Horseback or in a Coach  Fencing    Dancing  playing at  Billiards    Bowls  or  Tennis    Digging  Working at a  Pump    Ringing  a dumb Bell  c    Walking  is the most  natural  as it would be also the most  useful  if it did not spend too much of the  Spirits  of the  Weakly Riding  is certainly the most  Manly  the most  Healthy  and the least  laborious  and  expensive  of  Spirits  of  any shaking the whole  Machine  promoting an universal  Perspiration  and  Secretion  of all the  Fluids  to which may be added the various Changes of the  Air  thro' which they so quickly pass every  Alteration  of which becomes as it were a new  Bath  and thereby variously  twitching  the  Nervous Fibres  to brace and contract them as the  new Scenes  amuse the  Mind  Those who cannot  ride  must be carried in a  Coach  or  Litter  which is the best  Exercise  for the  Lame  and  Crazy  and the only one proper for  Old  and  Decrepit  Persons as well as  those  that are so  Young  that they are not able to manage their own  Exercise  The Home  Exercises  such as  playing  at  Tennis  and  Billiards    Dancing    Fencing  and the like ought to be follow'd only when the  Season  forbids being  Abroad  for being in the  Air  contributes much towards the Benefit of  Exercise  'Tis beautiful to observe that earnest  Desire  planted by  Nature  in  Young  Persons to  romp    jump    wrestle  and  run  and constantly to be pursuing  Exercises  and Bodily  Diversions  that require  Labour  even till they are ready to drop down especially the healthier Sort of them So that  sitting or being  confined  seems to be the greatest  Punishment  they can suffer and  imprisoning  them for some time will much more readily correct them than  Whipping  This is a wise Contrivance of Nature for thereby their  Joints  are render'd  pliable  and  strong  their  Blood  continues sweet and proper for a full  Circulation  their  Perspiration  is free and their  Organs stretched  out by due Degrees to their proper  Extension  §  It is also very agreeable to  observe  how the several different  Organs  of  Labouring  Men are strengthen'd and render'd  Brawny  and  Nervous  as they happen to be most employ'd in their several  Vocations  let them be otherwise ever so  small  or  weakly  The  Legs    Thighs  and  Feet  of  Chairmen  the  Arms  and  Hands  of  Watermen  the  Backs  and  Shoulders  of  Porters  grow  thick    strong  and  brawny  by Time 'Tis certain that speaking  strong  and  loud  without  overstraining  will  strengthen  the  Voice  and give Force to the  Lungs  Our  Nails  and  Hair  the more they are  cut  and  shaved  the more they  grow  And we may promote any one  Evacuation  so far as to weaken and starve all the rest Using  any  Organ  frequently and forcibly brings  Blood  and  Spirits  into it and so makes it grow  Plump  and  Brawny  And if due Pains were taken by the  Labour  proper to them the  Organs  of all the  Functions  of the  Animal Oeconomy  might be strengthen'd and kept in due plight  §  Therefore to the  Asthmatick  and those of weak  Lungs  I should recommend  Talking much  and  loud  even by themselves walking up an easy  Ascent  and when any degree of  Weariness  warns them to sit and rest till they are easy and then to return to their  walking  again and so to increase it every Day till they are able to walk a  reasonable  Distance in a  reasonable  Time To those who have weak  Nerves  and  Digestion  and to those who are much troubled with  Headaches  most of all which arise from the ill State of the  Stomach  and  Bowels  I should recommend riding on  Horseback  as much as possibly they could in the clearest and driest  Air  and to change the  Air  daily if possible To those who are troubled with the  Stone  or  Gravel  to ride much over rough  Causeways  in a  Coach  To those that have  Rheumatick  Pains to play at  Billiards    Tennis  or  Cricket    till they  sweat  plentifully and then go immediately into a warm Bed and drink liberally of some warm thin Liquor with Ten Drops of Spirit of  Sal Armoniac  or  Harts horn  in each Draught to encourage the  Sweating  To those who have weak  Arms  or  Hams  playing two or three Hours at  Tennis  or at  FootBall  every Day To those who have weak  Backs  or  Breasts  ringing a  Bell  or working at a  Pump  Walking thro' rough Roads even to Lassitude will soonest recover the Use of their  Limbs  to the  Gouty  tho'  Riding  on Horseback or in a Coach will best prevent the  Distemper  But the  Studious  and the  Contemplative  the  Valetudinary  and those of weak  Nerves  if they aim at  Health  and  Long Life  must make  Exercise  a Part of their  Religion  as it is among some of the  Eastern  Nations with whom  Pilgrimages  at stated Times are an indispensible Duty and where  Mechanical  Trades are learned and practised by Men of all Ranks Those who have their Time in their own Hands ought to have stated  Seasons  for  Riding  or  Walking  in a good  Air  as indispensable as those for going to  Dinner  to  Bed  or to  Church Three  Hours for  Riding  or  Two  for  Walking  the one hals before the great  Meal  and the other before going to  Bed  is the least that can be dispensed with As the first Part begets an  Appetite  the second helps on the  Digestion  Those who are not Masters of their own Time must take it when they can but to be sure they ought to let no Opportunity of taking it slip  §  There are Three Conditions of  Exercise  to make it the most Beneficial that may be  First  That it be upon an  empty  Stomach as indeed that is the proper Time for all  Medicinal  Evacuations for thereby the now  concocted  Cocta non cruda sunt evacuanda  Hippocrat  Crudities  or those  Superstuities  Nature would be rid of and has fitted by going through the proper  Secretions  for being  ejected  but cannot throw off without foreign  Assistance  will be readiest discharged For on a full Stomach  Exercise  would be too tumultuous  precipitate  the  Secretions  and throw off the sound Juices with the corrupted Humours  Secondly  That it be not continued to downright  Lassitude    Depression  of Spirits or a  melting  Sweat The  First  will wear out the  Organs  the  Second  spend the  Strength  and the  Third  will only do  violence  to the Natural  Functions Thirdly  Due Care is to be had after  Exercise  to retreat to a  warm Room  and proper Shelter from the  Injuries  of the Weather lest sucking into the wasted Body the  nitrous  Particles of the circumambient  Air  they should  inflame  the Blood and produce a  Rheumatism    Fever  or  Cold  I might add a  Fourth Condition  Joining  Temperance  to  Exercise  otherwise the  Evil  will be as  broad  one Way as 'tis  long  the other For since  Exercise  will create a greater  Appetite  if it is indulg'd to the  full  the  concoctive  Powers will be as  unequal  to the  Load  as they were before But I pass that over having sufficiently treated this Subject already  §  Under this Head of  Exercise  I cannot forbear recommending  Coldbathing  and I cannot sufficiently admire how it should ever have come into such  Disuse  especially among  Christians  when commanded by the greatest  Lawgiver  that ever was under the Direction of  God's Holy Spirit    to his  Chosen  People and  perpetuated  to us in the  Immersion  at  Baptism  by the same  Spirit  who with  infinite  Wisdom in this as in every Thing else that regards the  Temporal  and  Eternal  Felicity of his  Creatures  combines their  Duty  with their  eternal  Happiness  First  The Necessity of a free  Perspiration  to the  Preservation  of  Health  is now known to every Body and frequent  washing  the Body in  Water  cleanses the Mouths of the  Perspiratory Ducts  from that  Glutinous  Foulness that is continually falling upon them from their own condensed  dewy Atmosphere  whereby the  Perspiration  would be soon  obstructed  and the  Party  languish  Secondly  The having the  Circulation    full    free  and  open  thro' all the  Capillary Arteries  is of great Benefit towards  Health  and  Long Life  Now nothing promotes that so much as Coldbathing for by the violent and sudden Shock it gives to the whole  System  of the  Fluids  from the  Circumference  inward towards the  Centre  and the  Fluids  because  Reaction  is always  equal  and  contrary  to  Action  springing back again from the  Centre  to the  Circumference  a  Force  is raised almost ever sufficient to break thro' all the  Dams  and  Obstructions  of the  smallest  Vessels where they mostly happen and to carry the  Circulation  quite round  Thirdly  Nothing is so injurious and so much prevents the Benefit of  Exercise  to  weak  and  tender  Constitutions as  sucking  into their Bodies the  Nitrous  and  Humid Particles  of the  Air  that is  Catching of Cold  Now nothing so effectually  prevents  this as  Coldbathing  as the  Nature  of the Thing shews and  Experience  confirms For if  Exercise  to attenuate the  Juices  and strengthen the  Solids  be added to  Coldbathing  a new  Spring  and  Force  will be given to the  Blood  both to drive out these  foreign  and noxious  Mixtures  and to unite the  Cuticular Scales  which form the  ScarfSkin  so as to strengthen it for the future against such violent  Entries  §  I should advise therefore every one who can afford it as regularly to have a  Cold Bath  at their House to wash their Bodies in as a  Bason  to wash their Hands and constantly  two  or  three  Times a Week  Summer  and  Winter  to go into it And those that cannot afford such  Conveniency  as often as they can to go into a  River  or  Living Pond  to wash their Bodies But this  ought never to be done under the actual  Fits  of a  Chronical  Distemper with a  quick Pulse    Headach    weak Lungs  or a  foul Stomach  nor ought they to stay in till they are  overchill'd  And in  Winter  they ought to pursue their  Exercises  immediately after they come out and those of tender  Nerves  ought to pour  Basons  of Cold Water on their Head or wash it well with a  dripping Spunge  before they go in I cannot approve the  precipitant  Way of  jumping  in or throwing the Head foremost into a  Cold Bath  it gives too violent a Shock to Nature and risques too much the  Bursting  some of the smaller Vessels The Natural Way is holding by the  Rope  to walk down the Steps as fast as one can and when got to the  Bottom  bending their  Hams  as Women do when they Curt'sy low to  shorten  their Length so as to bring their Heads a good Way under  Water  and then  popping  up again to take Breath and thus alternately for two or three Times and out again  rubbing  and  currying  well before they are dress'd And this brings me to say something of another kind of  Exercise  §  The  Flesh Brush  is an  Exercise  most useful for promoting a full and free  Perspiration  and  Circulation  Almost every Body knows what well  Currying  will do to  Horses  in making them  sleek  and  gay    lively  and  active  even so much as to be worth half the  Feeding  This it can no otherwise  effectuate  than by assisting  Nature  to throw off by  Perspiration  the  i e  The grosser Parts  Recrements  of the Juices which stop the full and free  Circulation  and by constant  Friction    Irritation  and  Stimulation  to  allicite Blood  and  Spirits  to the Parts most distant from the Seat of  Heat  and  Motion  and so to  plump  up the  superficial Muscles  The same Effect it would produce in other  Animals  even  Human  Creatures themselves if they were managed in the same Manner with the same Care and Regularity I should think it therefore well worth the Pains of Persons of weak  Nerves  and  Sedentary  Lives especially those threatned with  Paralytick Disorders  to supply the Want of  Exercise  of other Kinds with spending  half an  Hour  Morning and Night in  Currying  and  Rubbing  their whole Body more especially their  Limbs  with a  Flesh Brush  And 'tis a Wonder to me that  Luxury  has not brought  Coldbathing  and  Currying  in Use upon the  Animals  especially those of them upon whom they can be so readily made Use of such as  Oxen    Pigs    Veal    Lamb  and all  Poultry  which naturally delight in  Coldbathing  which are brought to the  Table  For certain it is that  Cleanness  and due  Exercise  of which  Currying  is one Part would much contribute to make all  Animals  whatsoever without Exception healthier in themselves fuller of  Juice  and  Spirits  and consequently better Food for  Human  Creatures  As to  Quiet  the Conditions of  Exercise  being determined there needs nothing to be said of it  RULES for  Health  and  Long Life  drawn from the  Head  Of EXERCISE and QUIET  WHATEVER was the  Original  Constitution of  Man  in our present State a due Degree of  Exercise  is indispensably necessary towards  Health  and  Long Life    Animal  Food and  Strong Liquors  seem not to have been designed for  Man  in his Original  Make  and  Frame  but rather indulged to shorten the  Antidiluvian Length  of  Life  in order to prevent the  excessive  Growth of  Wickedness    Walking  is the most Natural and effectual  Exercise  did it not spend the  Spirits  of the tender too much  Riding  a Horseback is less laborious and more effectual for such Riding in a  Coach  is only for the  Infirm  and  Young  Children  House  Exercises are never  to be allow'd but when the  Weather  or some Bodily  Infirmity  will not permit going abroad for  Air  contributes mightily to the Benefit of  Exercise Children  naturally love all kinds of  Exercise  which wonderfully promotes their  Health  increases their Strength and stretches out their  Organs  The  Organs  of the Body that are most used always become  strongest  and therefore we may strengthen any weak  Organ  by  Exercise  The  Lungs  are fortified by  loud  Talking and  walking  up an easy  Ascent  The  Digestion  and the  Nerves  are strengthened and most  Headaches  cured by  Riding  the  Stone  and  Gravel  eased by riding in a  Coach  over rough Ground  Rheumatick  Pains by playing at  Tennis    Billiards  c till one  sweat  and then going to a warm Bed to promote the  Sweating  Feeble  Arms  by playing at  Shittlecock  or  Tennis  Weak  Hams  by  Football  and weak  Backs  by  Ringing  or  Pumping  The  Gouty  best recover the Use of their  Limbs  by Walking in  rough  Roads but prevent the  Fits  best by  Riding  a Horseback or in a  Coach  The  Valetudinary    and the  Studious  ought to have stated Times for  Exercise  at least Two or Three Hours a Day the one Half  before  Dinner the other  before  going to Bed    Exercise  should always be gone about with an  empty Stomach  Should never be continued to  Weariness  After it one must take Care not to catch  Cold  And it should always be accompanied with  Temperance  else instead of a  Remedy  it will become an  Evil    Coldbathing  is of great Advantage to Health but should not be used under a  Fit  of a  chronical  Distemper with a quick Pulse or with a  Headach  or by those that have weak  Lungs  It promotes Perspiration inlarges the  Circulation  and prevents the Danger of catching  Cold  Those of tender  Nerves  should pour Water on their  Heads  before they go in and none ought to jump in suddenly and with their  Heads  foremost  The  FleshBrush  is a most useful  Exercise  as appears by its Advantage to  Horses  and ought not only to  be used on Human Bodies but also on such of the  Animals  we design for our Food as it can be applied to  CHAP V Of our  Evacuations  and their  Obstructions  §  THE Three Principal  Evacuations  are By  Siege  by  Water  and by  Perspiration  All these must be duly  regulated  and in the Order of  Nature  towards the Preservation of  Health  and the prolonging of  Life  The  First  ought to be of a due  Consistence  between both  Extremes  i e  The Gross Evacuations ought to be of such a Consistence in the Healthy as to take the Impression of the Guts  Oportet Sanorum Sedes esse figuratas  Those who are  costive  have either  overheated  their Bodies with  strong Liquors  have eaten too sparingly have too slow a  Digestion  or the  Peristaltick  Motion of their Guts are too weak whereby the Food staying too long a Time before the Mouths of the  Lacteals  is overdrained of its  Moisture  Those who have  purging Stools  have eat  too much  or of Things  too strong  for their  concoctive  Powers For  superfluous  Nourishment leaves too much  Chyle  in the  i e  The Food after it is drain'd of its Nutritious Parts  Faeces  which fermenting in the  Guts    stimulates  them so as to become a  Purge  I have often observed That a  full  Meal of  strong  Meat as  Fish    Beef    Pork    Baked Meat  or  made  Dishes in tender Persons goes off with the  Hurry  and  Irritation  of a  Purge  leaving the Bowels  inflated    colicked  or  griped  and the Spirits  sunk  to the last Degree The  Food  by its various  Mixture    Weight  and  Fermentation    stimulating  all along from the  Stomach  to the  Rectum  and being scarce ever drained of its  Chyle  without affording any Nourishment to the Body runs off thus crudely and becomes equal to a total  Abstinence  from Food for a long Time And hence we have a most infallible  Rule    i e  After the Tryal has been made  à posteriori  to judge if we have  governed ourselves in our  Diet  in Proportion to the Necessities of  Nature  and the  Forces  of our  concoctive  Powers This is the very Reason why the  Bark  overdosed and given to Persons of weak Digestion so constantly  purges  them and why  Mercury  given either inwardly or by  Friction  runs off in violent  purging  and cannot be raised into a  Salivation  to wit the not adjusting the  Doses  to the Strength of the  Stomach  and  nervous Fibres  For the  Bark  naturally binds and  Mercury  naturally rises to the most pervious  Glands  And in this Sense I myself have frequently observed in weak and  scrofulous  Bowels even  Diascordium  and  Venice Treacle  to purge Whereas had the Doses been duly proportioned or had they begun by Underdosing and taken a little longer Time their End might have been effectually answered as I have often experienced without ever failing  §  And here it may not be amiss to take Notice of a  fatal  Mistake those run into who being  weakly    thin  and  slender  aim by all Means and at any Price to become  plump  and  round  and in order to attain this are perpetually  devouring huge Quantities of  high    strong  Food and swallowing proportionable Measures of  generous  Liquors not knowing that by this very Method they promote and confirm the  Disease  they would remedy For in such Persons and Cases the  globular  Part of the Blood is constantly of a  small  Quantity and very  glewy  and the  serous  Part thin and watry that is The Blood is  poor  and  weak  and the  Solids  or  Nerves  are  loose  and  relaxed  And the concoctive Powers being in  Proportion  to these  Two  of Consequence the  Digestions  must be weak and imperfect and their Force unable to dissolve and break any Quantity of such  strong  Meat or  spirituous  Liquors into a proper Chyle for Nourishment And this great  Load  must either be hurried off intirely through the  alimentary Ducts  in supernumerary Discharges or the small Portion of  Chyle  drawn out of it being too gross to unite and make a  similar  Fluid with the Mass of the Blood must be  precipitated  through the other  Drains  of the Body and thus the poor thin Creature must starve in  Luxury  and waste amidst  Superfluity  The Case is the same with  Nurses  and  Parents  in rearing up  Young  Children The perpetual  Gripes    Colicks    Loosenesses    hard Bellies    Choakings    Wind  and  Convulsive Fits  which torment half the Children of  England  are intirely owing to the too great  Quantities  of too strong  Food  and too rank Milk thrust down their Throats by their overlaying  Mothers  and  Nurses  For what else do their  slimy  their  gray  or  chylous  their  blackish  and  cholerick  Discharges the  Noise  and  Motion  in their Bowels their  Wind  and  Choakings  imply but  Crudities  from superfluous Nourishment This is so certain that they are universally and infallibly cured by  testaceous  Powders which only  absorb  sharp  Crudities  by  Rhubarb  Purges which at once  evacuate  and  strengthen  the Bowels and by Milk  Clysters    Issues  and  Blisters  which are still upon the Foot of Evacuation by  obstinately  persisting in these and the like intended to  evacuate  and  strengthen  the  alimentary  Passages and a thin spare and nutritive  Diet  Nothing nourishes but Food duly  concocted  and in the Course of Nature we must first  plump  up and extend and then  harden  and strengthen This is the Way of Nature in  Vegetation  And thus the  Animal  Creation devoid of Reason rear up their Young And thus even  the skilful  Groom  treats his wasted and decayed  Horse  And which is wonderful you shall find a sagacious  HorseDoctor  plump up and fatten a  rotten    lean    brokenwinded  Jade and make him look  sleek    gay  and  lively  so as to cheat not only the  Esquire  but his  BrotherDoctor  in fewer Weeks than all the  ManDoctors  in  England  could rear up their  FellowCreature  in Years 'Tis true The  Juices  of  Men  are more variously and more throughly corrupted and their  Solids  intirely broken which never happens to the  BruteCreation  But the greatest Mistake lies in the Neglect of  duly  observing and  religiously  prosecuting a proper Regimen This must principally consist in a  Diet  of  soft    light    tender    cool  and  mucilaginous  Foods or such as are already become  Chyle  either by  Nature  or  Art  such are  Milk  and  MilkMeats Rice    Sago    Barley    Wheat    Eggs    Broths    light Soops    Jellies    white    young    tender  and  wellfed Poultry  or  Butchery  Meat eaten little at a Time and often never without an  Appetite  nor to  Satiety  joining to these the other Helps and Assistances mentioned in this  Treatise  When  Flesh  is once come 'tis easy to make it  strong  and  hardy  by  due  Exercise  and a gradual adventuring upon  higher  Foods and more  generous  Liquors  §  I have often heard  valetudinary  and  tender  Persons and those of  sedentary  Lives and  Learned  Professions complain of  Headaches    Sicknesses  at the Stomach  Colicks  and  Gripes    Lowness  of  Spirits    Wind  and  Vapours  and yet pretend they were very moderate and  abstemious  in their Eating and Drinking But upon Enquiry I constantly found these very Persons pursued with  purging  Stools which was an evident  Proof  to me that they had taken down more than they wanted or could digest For 'tis  universally  certain That those that do not exceed must have either  Costive  or at least Stools of a middle  Consistence  There is nothing more  ridiculous  than to see tender  hysterical  and  vapourish  People perpetually  complaining  and yet perpetually  cramming  crying out They are ready to  sink  into the Ground and faint away and yet  gobbling  down the  richest  and  strongest  Food and highest  Cordials  to oppress and overlay them quite  Fresh  and  generous  Food mixing with the  sharp  Humours of the  Stomach  and  Bowels  may for some short Time qualify and abate their  Irritation  and may give a  Fillip  to the sluggish  Circulation  and become as it were a  Cork  to stop the perpetual Fuming up of these  noxious  Steams upon the  Head  and  Brain  But this is pardon the Similitude as if one should go to quench the  pestilential  Steams of a  CommonShore  by throwing in greater Heaps of  Ordure  and  Nuisance  into it The proper  Remedy  in this Case is First To cleanse the  fetid Abyss  and then to preserve it clean by cutting off all the  Inlets  of  Putrefaction  This will require a little  Courage    Labour  and  Pain  but the future  Ease  and  Sweetness  will more than abundantly recompense them for there is nothing more certain than that of those born  sound  here in  England  the  Headaches    Stomachaches    Colicks  and  nervous  Pains and Disorders  universally  proceed from  Idleness and Fulness of Bread  §  Those who eat but one moderate  Flesh  Meal a Day will have regularly once a Day a  Discharge  of the Remains of their Food And generally speaking those that go oftner have exceeded some how Those who pretend  to cure themselves of  nervous  Disorders or any other  chronical  Diseases or preserve themselves from them or lengthen out their Days must  underdose  themselves and therefore can go but  once  in  two  Days even though they should undergo the Pain of  Costiveness  For 'tis impossible the  Nerves  of those who have  slippery  Bowels should ever be  braced  or  wound up  for there the  Cure  must begin where the  Evil  began and must be communicated thence to the rest of the  System  as a  Ropemaker  begins the  Twist  at one End of the  Rope  and communicates it to all the other Parts Our  Access  to the  Nerves  of the  Stomach  and  Bowels  is obvious and open To the  rest  the Way is difficult and far about And since a  Relaxation    Weakness  and  want of Spring  in the  Fibres  is the  Origin  of all  nervous  Distempers no Medicines but such as  contract    stiffen    wind up  and  shorten  them can remedy this  Evil  and they must necessarily  contract  and  bind  up the  Fibres  of the  Stomach  and  Guts  as the Parts they first approach and exert their Virtue upon And he who without  firm  Bowels thinks to cure a  nervous  Distemper labours as much in vain as  he who would keep a  Fiddlestring  soaking in  Oil  and  Water  to make it  vibrate  or play off a fine Composition of  Musick  §  By  Experience  and  Observation  I have found That in those who have one regular Discharge in Twentyfour Hours the  Time  of the Progress of the  Food  from the  Stomach  till its  Remains  are thrown off is  Three  Natural Days And in those who go but  once  in  Two  Days the Time is  Six  Natural Days The Curious may be satisfied in this by swallowing an  Almond  or any other  Nut  which passes without being broken or making any Irritation The Reason is this That a smaller  Quantity  of Food is retained  longer  by their  Suction  at the Mouths of the  Lacteals  to drain it intirely of its  Chyle  and its Weight being less the  Concoctive  Powers have the greater  Force  upon it and so it is retained till it is perfectly  Digested  and drain'd of all its  Humidity  whereby such People become  Costive  Whereas in People that  exceed  the contrary Causes precipitate the Course of the  Aliment  and so leave the Bowels always  slippery  And nothing can more  demonstratively  shew an  Excess  than the  Lubricity  of the Discharge and I have often observed in tender Persons and those of weak  Nerves  when a Meal I mean only of those who eat  Flesh  Meat only  once  a Day has been a little too hard for the  Stomach  tho' the  Spirits  have been full and free and the  Health  equal and good by duly  proportioned Meals  for two preceding Days the Third Day when the gross  Meal  came off they have been full of  Wind  and  Vapours  their  Eyes  dim and their  Heads  heavy with flying  Rheumatick  Pains over the Body and  ColickGripes  From whence we may draw these three  Corollaries  Coroll  It requires the same Time for the  unconcocted Chyle  of a gross  Meal  to run the  Circle  of the Habit and the  feculent  Remains to pass thro' the  Guts  the First by  Perspiration  and the Last by  Siege  Coroll  We may likewise gather from thence a  Confirmation  of that  Aphorism  of the  Physicians  That the  Errors  of the  first Concoction  are never mended in the  subsequent  unless the  Case to be mentioned in the next Paragraph be an  Exception  to it For the gross  Meal  gave rather more  Uneasiness  when it came to be thrown off by  Perspiration  Coroll  From hence we may also see the Ridiculousness of the  Vulgar  Opinion ascribing universally the  Pain  they suffer or the  Relief  they find to the  last Meal  or  Medicine  §  There are some sorts of  Food  which may  oppress  and  load  the  Stomach  and  Alimentary Ducts  in the  first Concoction  which may be very safe and benign in the  subsequent  ones For instance  Cheese    Eggs    MilkMeats  and  Vegetable Food  tho' duly prepared and justly proportioned in  Quantity  may chance to lie  heavy  on the  Stomach  or beget  Wind  in the  Alimentary  Passages of some Persons and yet drinking of  Water  will always remedy this  Inconveniency  But these neither having their Parts  strongly  united nor abounding in sharp  Urinous Salts  when they become sufficiently diluted with a  watry Menstruum  or dissolved into their  Component  Parts and their Parts being still  smaller  than the  smallest  Vessels and  their  Union  constantly less than the  Force  of the  Concoctive  Powers in Persons who have any remaining  Fund  of Life in them will thereby yield a sweet thin and easily  Circulating Chyle  in the after  Concoctions  become  benign  and  salutary  and afford no  Materials  for  Chronical  Distempers And the  Wind  thence generated not being  pointed  and  armed  with such sharp  Salts  as those of  Flesh  Meats or the  Corrosive  Juices of  Spirituous  Liquors will be as innocent and safe as the  Element  we breathe in  §  The Second  Evacuation  is by  Water  whose Circumstances and Condition tho' little adverted to may be of great Service to discover both the State of our  Constitution  and the  Proportion  of our  Diet  Some People are frightned when they find their  Water turbid    broken  and full of  Brickdust Sediment  whereas that is the best  Symptom  it can have For tho' it supposes the  Blood  loaded with  Urinous Salts  and  Cradities  yet 'tis still better they should pass off than continue in the  Habit  On the contrary when those that live  freely  have  Quantities  of  pale    limpid  and  sweet  Water 'tis a certain Sign that the  Perspiration  is stopp'd that neither the  First  nor the  Secondary Concoctions  have been duly perform'd that the  Chyle  has not been sufficiently  broken  nor the finer  Secretions  duly made by the lesser  Drains  and that the Urinous  Salts  are still retained in the  Habit  Upon which must needs ensue  Oppression  of  Spirits    Chills  upon the  Extremities    flying Rheumatick  Pains over the Body  Headaches    Cholicks  and  Gripes  And here it may not be amiss to take Notice of the Difference of the pale Water of  Hypochondriacal  and  Hysterical  Persons from that of those who labour under a true  Diabetes  the Apprehension of which terrifies so often the  Low  and  Dispirited  Persons of the  First  Class The  Water  of both has the same  Appearance  both in  Quality  and  Quantity  at least in the first Instance they are both attended with the same  Sinking  and  Dispiritedness  But in a true  Diabetes  there is a constant  Thirst  a  low  but  quick Pulse  the Water is much  sweeter  and continues longer to come off in  profuse Quantities  insomuch that sometimes it is so violent as to run down the  Party  in a few Days In  Hypochondriacal  and  Hysterical  Persons there is little or no  Thirst  never a  quick  Pulse but rather too  low  and  slow  a one the  Flux  soon stops of itself or by any little  Diaphoretick  Medicine and they are cold upon the  Extremities  which the others are not  §  That  bluish  and  variegated Film  which sometimes looks like  Oil  and  Fat  swimming on the Water of  Scorbutick  and  Cachectick  Persons is nothing but the  congregated Salts  which are  crowded  so thick together that they are ready to shoot into  Clusters  much like the  Film  of a  i e  A Lye  Lixivium  when standing for the  Crystallization  of fixed  Salts  The  Water  which has a  light Cloud  hanging almost from the  Top  to the  Bottom  is of a  bright Amber  Colour and about  three Quarters  of the Liquor taken down is best and a certain Sign of a  due Concoction  a just Proportion of Food and a total Absence of  Repletion  and  Crudity  And those who live  Temperately  use  due Exercise  and enjoy a perfect State of  Health  always make such  Water  §  Those who are subject to great  Quantities  of  limpid  and  pale  Water ought to conclude that their Food has been too  heavy  in  Quality  or too much in  Quantity  for their  Concoctive Powers  or their  Labour too  little and that therefore they ought to proportion both for the future with more  Caution  and  Exactness  by living  low  for some Time or using more  Exercise  And to stop their  Flux  of  pale Water  they ought to take a little  Gascoign's Powder    Confection  of  Alkermes  or Sir  Walter Raleigh's Cordial  at Night and drink liberally of  small warm Sack Whey  with a few  Drops  of  Spirit  of  Hartshorn  to set the  Perspiration  in order again Those on the other Hand who make  highcolour'd    foul  and very  turbid Water  in smaller  Quantities  have either inflamed their Blood  too  much with  Spirituous Liquors  or loaded it with  too  great a  Quantity  of  Animal Salts  To prevent therefore  Disorders  and  Diseases  they must lessen the  Quantity  of their  Flesh  Meat and  temper  the Heat of their  Wine  with Water Else they will lay the Foundation of some  Acute Inflammatory  or dangerous  Chronical  Distemper  §  The worst kind of Water of all is that of a  dark Brown  or  dirty Red  in a small  Quantity  and without any  Sediment  This kind of  Water  in  Acute  Diseases always indicates insuperable  Crudity    high Inflammation  tending towards  Mortification  and a dying  Languor  in Nature And in Persons labouring under no  visible  Distemper at the Time an almost total  Debility  of the  Concoctive  Powers an inseparable  Union  of the  Constituent  Parts of the Blood the highest Degree of  Crudity  and a  Deadness  in all the  Animal Functions  And if preceded by long continued  Excesses  requires the Advice of a  Physician  I shall say nothing of  Coffeecolour'd    Bloody    Wheyish  or  Purulent  Water or that with white  Gravel    Films    Rags  or  Bits  of broken  Membranes  They are well known to be  Nephritick  or  Symptoms  of an  Ulcer  somewhere in the  Urinary  Passages  §  There happens also an  Evacuation  both by  Siege  and  Urine  to some weak Persons of  relaxed Nerves  that extremely alarms the  Patient  and is not  so readily accounted for in common  That Part of Physick which teaches the Causes of Diseases  Aetiology  It is when either a  white transparent    viscid  Substance like  Gelly  is constantly voided by the  Bowels  more or less or when a  white    milk    glewy  Substance like  Cream  or laudable  Matter  settles in the  Water  Both these  Appearances  are commonly ascribed to an  Ulcer  in the  Guts  or in the  Kidneys  the very Apprehension of which is almost sufficient in some low Persons to bring on the Distemper feared And yet I am very certain there is neither  Ulcer  nor true  Matter  in either Case as I propose them For where there is violent and acute Pain or  Matter  of different Colours or Mixtures there very possibly may be nay certainly there is an  Ulcer  But in the  Case  I here intend there is very little or no Pain no  Hectical Paroxysms  which always attend an inward  Ulcer  no bloody or  sanious  Mixtures which always betray the inward Sore no  fetid  Smell to imply Corruption For the  Cases  I put at present happen to  Persons the least capable of  Inflammation  or  Imposthumation    viz  to  paralytick  Persons or those of a Natural Tendency that Way to  cold    vapourish  Persons of low  Spirits  and weak  Nerves  whose Pulse is low and slow and their natural  Functions  weak and languid all which evidently shew that these Discharges cannot come from an  Ulcer  The first  Case  I take to be either an Obstruction of some of the  Lacteals  whereby the  Chyle  cannot be carried off in any sufficient Quantity but passing through the  Guts  and its more Watry Part being  evaporated  it becomes thick and  gelatinous  and is thrown off at last with the Remains of the Food Else it must be an Obstruction of those  Glands  of the  Guts  by which a viscid  Matter  for lubricating of them is commonly secerned by the Imprisonment and  Evaporation  of which Matter it thickens and turns like a  Gelly  as it does by Cold or Overfeeding in the  Glands  of the  Mouth    Throat  and  Windpipe  and at last by the Squeezing of the  Guts  is thrown off And in the same Manner I take that  Milky  Substance subsiding in the  Water  in such a  Case  as I have mentioned to arise from  a  Relaxation  of the  Glands  of the  Kidneys  and  Bladder  and other  Urinary  Passages and that both are to be cured the same Way other  Nervous  Distempers are cured  viz  by a proper  Regimen  of  Diet  and a Course of contracting strengthening and volatile Medicines  §  The insensible  Perspiration  is the  Third Evacuation  to be considered The  Statical Chair  invented by  Sanctorius  for examining the  Quantity  of the  Perspiration  however  ingenious  and  delightful  in  Speculation  is too  cumbersome  and  laborious  to be of any great Use in  Common  Life 'Tis certain however that the free and full flowing of this  Evacuation  is as necessary to  Health  as any of the grosser since in  Quantity  it is at least equal to both the forementioned and an  Obstruction  thereof is generally the Source of all  acute  Diseases as it is a  Consequence  of all  Chronical  ones And therefore I have advised those who are much abroad in  Easterly  and  Northerly  Winds which most of any obstruct  Perspiration  and have  Fluxes  of  white  and  pale Water  to a ready  Antidote  to prevent the Beginnings of these  Obstructions  §  Dr  His Statica Britannica  JAMES KEILL has made it out beyond all possibility of doubting that  catching  of  Cold  is nothing but  sucking  in by the Passages of  Perspiration  large  Quantities  of moist  Air  and  nitrous Salts  which by  thickening  the Blood and Juices as is evident from Bleeding after catching  Cold  and thereby  obstructing  not only the  Perspiration  but also all the other finer  Secretions  raises immediately a small  Fever  and a  Tumult  in the whole  Animal Oeconomy  and neglected lays a Foundation for  Consumptions    Obstructions  of the great  Viscera  and universal  Cachexies  The  Tender  therefore and  Valetudinary  ought cautiously to avoid all Occasions of catching  Cold  and if they have been so unfortunate as to get  one  to set about its Cure immediately before it has taken too deep  Root  in the  Habit  From the  Nature  of the Disorder thus described the  Remedy  is obvious To wit  Lying  much abed  Drinking  plentifully of small warm  Sack Whey  with a few  Drops  of  Spirit  of  Hartshorn    PossetDrink    WaterGruel  or any other  warm small  Liquors a Scruple of  Gascoign  's Powder Morning and Night Living  low  upon  SpoonMeats    Pudding  and  Chicken  and  drinking  every thing  warm  In a Word treating it at first as a small  Fever  with gentle  Diaphoreticks  and afterward if any Cough or Spitting should remain which this Method generally prevents by  softening  the  Breast  with a little  SugarCandy  and  Oil of Sweet Almonds  or a Solution of  Gum Ammoniac  an Ounce to a Quart of  Barley  Water to make the  Expectoration  easy and going  cautiously  and well  cloathed  into the  Air  afterwards This is a much more  natural    easy  and  effectual  Method than the Practice by  Balsams    Linctus  's  Pectorals  and the like  Trumpery  in common Use which serve only to  spoil  the Stomach  oppress  the Spirits and  hurt  the Constitution  §  The surest Way of maintaining and promoting a due  Perspiration  is To take down no more Food than what the  Concoctive Powers  are sufficient to reduce into a due  Fluidity  and the Expences of Living require to prosecute necessary  Exercise  and use the other  Assistances  advised in the foregoing  Chapters  Want of due  Rest  and the  Refreshment  that follows upon it  starting    tossing  and  tumbling  abed are certain Signs that the  Perspiration  is not duly carried on in the  Night Season  And therefore in order to remedy this a greater Proportion of  Exercise  a greater Degree of  Abstinence  or some gentle domestick  Purge  must be had recourse to the next Day  Colical  Pains  Gripes  and  Purging  much  Eructation  and  Belching  of Wind  Low Spiritedness    Yawning  and  Stretching  are infallible  Signs  that the  Perspiration  flows not freely and plentifully then And therefore the same  Remedies  ought to be prosecuted as soon as an Opportunity offers else the Party will suffer at last  Wind  as  Sanctorius observes  and  demonstrates  is nothing but  obstructed Perspiration  And  Yawning  and  Stretching  are but  Convulsions  of the proper  Muscles  and  Organs  appointed by Nature the one for  Pumping  up  Wind  from the  Bowels  the other for pressing upon the  Excretory Ducts  in the  Skin  to force out the sluggish  perspirable  Matter And 'tis beautiful to observe how wisely  Nature  has contrived the  Sposms    Cramps  and  Convulsions  of the proper  Organs  to expel every  noxious  and  extraneous  Body out of the  Habit  Thus  Coughing  is a  Convulsion  of the  Diaphragm  and  Muscles  of the  Breast  to throw out viscid  Phlegm    Vomiting  of the  Stomach  assisted by the  Diaphragm  and  Muscles  of the  Abdomen  to throw up its  Crudities  and those of the  Bowels  or to  expel Sand  or  Stones  from the  Kidneys  The Throws of  Labouring  Women are to bring off the  Burden Sneezing  is an  Effort  of the proper  Muscles  to eject some noxious Particles from the  Organs  of  Smelling Shivering  and  Stretching  to assist  Perspiration  and  Yawning  to pump up  noxious Wind  And even  Laughing  itself is an Effort of the  Muscles  of the whole  Trunk  to throw off something that its  delicate  Membranes cannot bear And Lastly  Hysterical Fits  and  Convulsions  both in  Infants  and Persons come to  Maturity  are but violent  Efforts    Struggles    Workings    Cramps  and  Spasms  of all the  Muscles  of the whole Body together to expel squeeze and press out the sharp  Acrimonious Wind Fumes  and  Vapours  from the Cavities of the whole  Machine  §  There is an  Evacuation  incident to Persons of weak Nerves which could not conveniently come in  under the general  Division  because it happens too seldom to make a new Member of it It is a  Discharge  of thin  Rheum  from the  Glands  of the Mouth Throat and Stomach and is called by some A  Nervous  or  Scorbutick  Spitting It rises sometimes to the Heighth of a  petit Flux de Bouche  as the  French  call it and threatens some tender Persons as they apprehend with a  Consumption  though it imply nothing less We may observe some who are struck with a deep  Palsey  to flow at the Mouth and  drivel  down their Breasts insomuch that the Afflicted of this  Sort  who are advanced in Years can scarce speak intelligibly for the  Flux  till they have first emptied and cleaned their Mouths And this arises to so great a Heighth in some much broken  paralytick  Persons that upon the slightest Occasions either of  Joy  or  Grief  they are apt to run into a  Profusion  of Tears Sighs and Sobbings And some sorts of  Ideots  and those  Hysterically mop'd  and most of those who suffer from  relaxed  and weak  Nerves  are more or less subject to these  Salival  Discharges especially after  Excesses  in  Diet  Hence the  first  Sort receive the Appellation of  Snivellers  or  Drivellers  And the Difficulty of the Cure of all the Diseases of weak  Nerves  depends much on the Quantity and Constitution of this  Flux  For much and long Spitting and Running off of this  Rheum  implies a total  Relaxation  of the whole  Nervous System  and shews neither the first nor second  Concoctions  have been duly performed I have frequently had Occasion to shew how  Excesses  in the  Quantity  or  Quality  of the Food in Persons of  relaxed  and weak  Nerves  begot a viscid and gross  Chyle  of which  that Part  which could not get through the  Lacteals  lay fermenting and putrifying in the  Alimentary  Passages begot  Wind    Gripes  and  Colicks  and at last wrought itself off like a  Purge  and that  that Part  which got through the  Lacteals  and was received within the Limits of the  Circulation  being too gross and glewy to be mixed with the old  Mass  of the  Fluids  to circulate through the smallest Vessels and to enter the fine  Perspiratory Glands  would necessarily be thrown into the wider more spongy and loose  Salivary Glands  which are appointed by Nature to secern the more  Glutinous  Parts of the Fluids And from thence this  Salivary  Inundation  proceeds The  Fact  is When those of weak  Nerves  commit habitual Excesses in their  Diet  the  Glands  and small Vessels of all the Body are  tumified    swelled  and  obstructed  thereby as they needs must be And 'tis from the Pressure of these  inlarged Glands  and the obstructed  capillary  Vessels on the  Nerves  and patent  Blood Vessels  that most of the  Evils  they suffer under proceed But more especially are the  Glands  appointed to draw off the more viscid serous Part of the Blood  obstructed  and  tumified  thereby Upon which Account as  Baglivi  advises to enquire well into the State of the  Tongue  and  Mouth  in order to discover the Condition of the  Stomach    Guts  and  Bowels  so I think 'tis highly reasonable in a  Chronical  Case to have great regard to the Condition of the  Eyes  and if a dead cold  Languor  be observed in the  Hue  or  Water  of them as  Jewellers  speak of  Diamonds  and more especially if the  lachrymal Gland  in the Corner next the Nose which I always narrowly inspect if I say this  Gland  be found harder or larger than ordinary  swelled  and  tumified  it must certainly be concluded whatever else be in the Case  there must be a relaxed State of  Nerves  much  Vapours  weak natural  Functions  and a mismanaged  Regimen  And it is from the Obstruction and Swelling of this and the other  Glands  in and about the  Eyes  and their Pressure upon the  Optical Nerves  and fine Blood Vessels that those  Spots    Flies    Atoms    Dimness    Darkness  and  Confusion  of Sight in  Vapourish  and  Hysterical  People proceed For this  Gland  shews that the whole  serous Glands  in the upper Regions of the Body are in Proportion tumified and swelled with  viscid  Humours through  Excess  of Diet unless the Person have suffered there by Accident or labours under some natural Disorders of the  Eyes  From the Obstruction and Swelling of the  Salivary Glands  in the Mouth Throat and Gullet proceed also those  Choakings    Gulping  and  Strangling  that  Hysterick  Persons so often complain of The  Wind  and  Crudities  lodged in their Stomach and Guts and the rest of the Cavities of the Body pressing to get  vent  upwards are resisted and stopp'd in their Passage by the  Diaphragm  whereby the Inspiration is streightned and by the Bulk of these  Glands  throughout the Gullet the Way is intirely stopp'd  which raises such a  Tumult  and  Struggle  as produces the mentioned  Symptoms  which I have not Leisure to detail here more minutely Now this  Salivation  or Discharge of the thinner  Rheum  and that  Coughing  and  Hawking  of more viscid  Flegm  commonly called a  nervous Cough  as also the  Chincough  of Children and all such Discharges of sharp  Serum  in Persons of weak and relaxed Nerves is an  Effort of Nature  to relieve them And if discreetly managed and duly heeded would prove a  Crise  to their Disorders and quite free them from their present  The sharpest Part of the suffering Fit of a Disease  Paroxysms  and set the  Circulation  and  Perspiration  and consequently the  Spirits  at Freedom and Liberty again Some Persons most distractedly run to  Drams  and  Cordials  to remedy this  Evil  to stop the Violence of this  Deluge  and to raise their drooping Spirits But it serves only to thicken the  Flegm  shut up the Mouths of the  Salivary  Glands closer and so to perpetuate the  Evil  they mean to cure Others devour large Quantities of  high  and  generous Foods  because they find a  little Relief to their Spirits from the first  Run  of the sweet thin and  spirituous Chyle  But this is only adding  Fewel  to the  Fire  and running on in a perpetual Round of  Lowness  and  Slavering  Whereas would they suffer Nature to act her own Way to carry on this  critical Discharge  as far as it will go without offering in the least either to check or promote it but by thin light Food and cool Liquors in moderate or rather under dosed Quantities support her in the manner the  Concoctive  Powers are sufficient for after she had discharged all the  Crudities  from the Mass of the  Fluids  by these  Emunctory Glands  and thereby given a free Passage to the  Wind  to escape the Way it tends the  Salivation  would lessen gradually and at last stop of itself And if then towards the  Decline  a gentle  Vomit  to pump up the slow and viscid Remains of the  Wind  and  Flegm  in the Upper Part of the  Alimentary  Passages and afterwards a gentle  Stomachick  warm  Purge  to scour the Lower Part of these  Tubes  were carefully administred the  Patient  would soon find a  clear Head    lightsome Spirits  Ease and Freedom from Pain and Oppression the  Circulation  and  Perspiration  would be soon brought to their natural and sound State and  Health  and  Cheerfulness  restored together unless a mortal or habitual  Spitting  Ptyalism  was the Case which I have sometimes observed as fatal and incurable as a true  Dropsy  or inveterate  Diabetes  all which owe their Being to a deep  Scurvy  whereby the Globular Part of the Blood is intirely  broken  and the  Serum  made a meer  Lixivium  or Lye  RULES for  Health  and  Long Life  drawn from the Head Of EVACUATION    COSTIVE Stools  are Signs of overheated Blood too spare Feeding Slowness of Digestion or Weakness of the Guts    Purging Stools  shew intemperate Feeding Too  full  a  Meal  has the Effects of a  Purge  fills the Guts with Wind and gives Gripes  Mercury  and  even the  Bark    Diascordium  and  Treacle  if  overdosed    purge    Headaches    sick  Stomachs  Vapours    low  Spirits  Gripes  and  Colicks  proceed from  Cramming  and are ever accompanied with  loose Stools  Those that live  temperately  have  one  regular  Stool a Day  Those who have  more    exceed  The  Cure  of all  Relaxations  of the Nerves the Source of Chronical Diseases must necessarily  begin  at the  Stomach  and Guts  The  Time  from  eating  a Meal till its  Discharge  is  three  Days in those that have  one  Stool  a Day Six  in those that have but  one  in  two  Days  A  gross Meal  produces more  Disorders  the Day the Excrements of it  go off  than the Day it is  eaten  A  Meal  takes the  same Time  to get through the Habit by  Perspiration  that its  Remains  do to pass through the  Guts  The  Errors  of the first Concoctions cannot be  mended  afterwards    Pain  or  Relief  is not always the  Effect  of the  last Meal  or  Medicine  that was taken down  Though  Cheese    Eggs    Milk  and  Vegetable Foods  may be  hard  to digest without drinking of  Water  to some Stomachs yet their  Chyle  is  good  and produces no bad Effects    Turbid Water  with  Brickdust  Sediment proceeds from the  critical Discharge  of what was preternaturally retained in the Habit    Pale sweet  Water from the  Urinous Salts  being yet  retained  There is great Difference between  Hysterick pale Water  and that which proceeds from a  Diabetes  That Appearance of  Fat  on the Urine of some People is nothing but a  thin Film  of  Salts    Bright Ambercoloured  Water with a  light  Sediment rising toward the Top amounting to  three Quarters  of what is drank is a Sign of  good Digestion  Great Quantities of  pale  Water proceed from  Excess  in the  Quantity  of Food and  want  of  Exercise  The Cure of it is performed by  eating less  using  more Exercise  and taking some  Diaphoreticks  to set the  Perspiration  right    Highcolour'd turbid  Water in  small  Quantity shews abundance of  Animal Salts  in the Habit or the immoderate Use of  Spirituous Liquors  And must be cured by  vegetable Food  and  Water  or other  small Drink    Dark brown  Water or of a  dirty red  is extremely  dangerous  both in  acute  Cases and in those that seem at present to  ail nothing    Bloody purulent  Water and full of  Films  is a Sign of  Nephritick Ailments    Stone  and  Gravel  The viscid  Matter  like  Gelly  in the  Stools  and the viscid  milky Substance  somewhat like Matter in the  Urine  of some People of  weak Nerves  proceed from a Corruption of the Liquor of the  Mucous Glands  of the  Intestines  and of the  Bladder  and other Urinary Passages    Obstruction  of  Perspiration  is one Source of  acute  Diseases and a Consequence of  chronical  ones  Catching of  Cold  is an  Obstruction  of  Perspiration  by the  humid  and  nitrous  Particles of the Air It should be cured by gentle  Diaphoreticks  and not by  Balsamick  Pectorals which do no good but in the End of the Cure to promote  Expectoration  from the Lungs if there be any Occasion for it  Persons of weak Nerves have often a  critical Flux  of  Rheum  from the  Glands  of the  Mouth  and  Throat  to a very  large  Quantity which if not  tampered  with brings them great  Relief  CHAP VI Of the PASSIONS  §  I Come now in the Order of my first proposed  Method  to treat of the  Passions  which have a greater Influence on  Health  and  Long Life  than most People are aware of And that I may propose my  Scheme  with the greatest Clearness I can I will lay down some  Propositions  or  Axioms  as the Groundwork on which it is founded  Prop  I The  Soul  resides eminently in the  Brain  where all the  Nervous  Fibres terminate inwardly like a  Musician  by a welltuned  Instrument  which has  Keys  within on which  it  may play and without on which  other Persons  and  Bodies  may also play By the  inward Keys  I understand those Means by which the  Thoughts  of the  Mind  affect the  Body  and by the  outward    those whereby the  Actions  or  Sensations  of the  Body  affect the Mind Both these  Affections  may be called  Passions  in a general View as either Part of the Compound is acted upon  Scholium  As a  Man  is compounded of two different  Principles    Soul  and  Body  and as there are two different kinds of outward  Objects  by which these two different  Principles  may be acted upon to wit  Matter  and  Spirit  the  Passions  in these two different  Views  may be divided into  Spiritual  and  Animal  As to the  first  Branch of this Division since  Spirits  if I may be allow'd there are any such Beings may be supposed to act upon  one another  without the  Mediation  of  Organical  Bodies such perhaps was St  Paul's Extasy  when he was rapt up into the  Third Heavens  such was  Moses  's Commerce with his  Maker  when he spoke to  God Face to Face  such must the Influence of the  Divine Grace  be supposed and all who allow of  Revelation  admit that the  Soul  may be Serene and Tranquil while the  Body  is in Distress and Pain and even all the  Stoick Philosophy  is grounded on this  Distinction  it must have a real  Existence in  Nature  And the  other  Branch must also be allow'd by all those who cannot think  Brute Animals  mere  Machines  and who observe that we have  Impressions  made on our Bodily Organs which affect us sometimes very deeply even in our  Sleep  However these Things be 'tis sufficient for my Purpose that  Man  is allowed to be a compounded Being on which outward Objects may act to abstract the Consideration of the  Impressions  made on the  Spirit  from those made on the  Body  Prop  II The  Union  of these two  Principles  in the Compound  Man  seems to consist in  Laws  praeestablish'd by the  Author  of  Nature  in the  Communications  between  Bodies  and  Spirits  as there are no doubt  Laws  establish'd for  Spirits  in their Commerce and Actions upon  one another  For every one knows there are  Laws  of Nature establish'd by its  Author  for the Actions of  Bodies  upon  one another  Scholium  These  Laws  of the Actions of the  Soul  on the  Body  and of the  Body  upon the  Soul  are never to be known  to us but by their  Effects  as the  Laws  of Nature in the Actions of  Bodies  upon  one another  were first discovered by  Experiment  and afterward reduced into general  Propositions  One  Law  of the Action of the  Soul  on the  Body    vice versâ  seems to be That upon  such  and  such  Motions produced in the Musical Instrument of the  Body    such  and  such  Sensations should arise in the  Mind  and on such and such Actions of the  Soul  such and such  Motions  in the  Body  should ensue much like a  Signal  agreed to between two  Generals  the one within the other without a  Citadel  which should signify to one another what they have before agreed to and established between them or like the  Key  of a  Cypher  which readily explains the otherwise  unintelligible  Writing Besides these  Passions  and  Affections  which are  involuntary    Prop  III As  Bodies  are purely  passive  and are acted upon by other  Bodies  conformable to the settled  Laws  of  Nature  in  Spiritual  Beings on the contrary there is an  active    self motive    selfdetermining Principle  by which it directs and manages itself with regard not only to  its  own self  and its own  Sentiments  but also to its  Actions  and  Influence  on other Beings without it and their Actions and Influences on it And this is the Foundation of  Liberty  or  Freewill  in  Rational  and  Intelligent  Beings  Scholium  That this  Faculty  or  Principle  really exists and is essential to  Spiritual  Beings is as certain as that there is  Motion  in the  Universe  or that  Body  and  Spirit  are  essentially  different For that  Motion  is not essential to  Bodies  is as certain as that Bodies are  impenetrable  and that the  Quantity  of  Motion  in the  Universe  may be and is daily increased is as much  Demonstration  as any  Proposition  in  Euclid  And if  Motion  be is or may be increased it must arise from  Spiritual  Beings And he who can deny this only shews himself ignorant of the  Principles  of all true and just  Philosophy  and of the first  Elements  of the  System  of material and spiritual Beings For further Conviction of this and clearing up all possible Objections and Difficulties I refer the Reader to the  Learned  and  Ingenious  Dr  Clarke  in his Answer to the Enquiry into  Liberty  and his Letters to  Mr  Leibnitz  where he has treated this Matter with the greatest Perspicuity and Justness Besides these now mentioned  Principles    Prop  IV As in  Bodies  there is a  Principle  of  Gravity  or  Attraction  whereby  in Vacuo  they tend to one another and would  unite  according to certain  Laws  and  Limitations  established by the  Author  of  Nature  So there is an  Analogous Principle  in  Spirits  whereby they would as certainly in their proper  Vacuity  be  attracted  by  tend  to and  unite  with one another and their first  Author    Centre  and  the Rock out of which they were hewn  to use a Scripture Phrase as the  Planets  would to one another and to the  Sun  And this is nothing else but what in Scripture is called CHARITY  Scholium  This  Proposition  is as certain as the Rules of  Analogy  are which in my Opinion are the Foundation of all the Knowledge we can have of  Nature  while we can see only a few  Links  of the Universal  Chain  and but a few disjointed  Parts  of the grand  System  of the  Universe  The  Author  of  Nature  who could create  intelligent  Beings only in order to make them  Happy  could not leave them to so many different  Attractions  without  implanting  into their  Essence  and  Substance  as an  Antidote  to such Variety of  Distractions  an  infinite Tendency    Bent  and  Biass  towards Beings of the same Nature and towards  Himself  who was the  Cause  and  Object  of their Felicity And even in this our  lapsed  and forlorn Estate there remain evident Footsteps of this  Principle  yet uneffaced Such are the  Checks  of  Conscience    natural Affection  and the universal  Desire  of  Immortality  and Dread of  Annihilation  what the World calls the  Seeds of Honour  and  Renown  all that Concern and Regard paid mere  Romantick Heroes  and the  Worship  bestow'd by all Nations who are not sunk into mere  Brutality  on some  Superior and Invisible Powers  These are  Remains  of this  Principle  and its Workings sufficient to shew its Reality  à posteriori  as the Laws of  Analogy  and the  Nature  and  Attributes  of the  first Being  shew it  à priori  Those who admit of  Revelation  cannot doubt of it for a Moment  for  Deut xxx  Moses  calls it  A Law engraven on the Heart of Man  and  Cor xiii ult  St  Paul  The  greatest Perfection of Human Nature  Coroll  Hence the true Nature of Supreme  Spiritual Good  and  Evil  may be discovered For if there be impressed on  Spiritual  Beings an  infinite Tendency    Bent  and  Biass  to be  reunited  with their  Divine Original  and the Place in the  Divine Substance  out of which they were formed if I may speak so in a  Figurative Sense  then their being  finally united  with this their  Divine Original  is the  Supreme Spiritual Good  and the several  Approaches  toward this Union are  inferior Spiritual Goods  as the being  finally separated  from it is the  supreme Spiritual Evil  and the several Steps toward this  Separation    inferior Spiritual Evils  And the  Means  of this  Union  and  Separation  are  Moral Good  and  Evil  Coroll  By  Schol  of  Prop  the most general Division of the  Passions    was into  Spiritual  and  Animal  As in the  first  Sense  Passion  may be defined The  Sentiments  produced on the  Soul  by  external Objects  either  Spiritual  ones immediately or  Material  ones by the  Mediation  of the  Organs  of the  Body  So in the  second  Sense  Passion  may be defined The Effect produced by  Spirits  or  Bodies  immediately on the  Body  And since outward  Objects  may be considered as  Goods  or  Evils  the most natural Division of the  Passions  whether  Spiritual  or  Animal  as they regard these  Objects  is into the  Pleasurable  and the  Painful  which exhausts their whole Extent And in this Sense all the  Passions  may be reduced to  Love  and  Hatred  of which  Joy  and  Sorrow    Hope  and  Fear  c are but different  Modifications  or  Complexions  as they may be called I do not descend to a more particular Account not intending an accurate Treatise on the  Passions  but only to lay a Foundation for some general  Observations  on them as they regard and influence  Health  and  Long Life  §  In relation to the  Organical  Instruments of the  Body  and the Effects wrought on them or the Disorders  brought upon them the  Passions  may be divided into  Acute  and  Chronical  after the same Manner and for the same Reason as  Diseases  are The  acute Passions  whether  pleasurable  or  painful  have much the same  Effect  and work much after the same  Manner  as  Acute Diseases  do They effect a brisk and lively  Circulation  of the  Fluids    crisp  up and  constrict  the Solids for some short Time Thus sudden  Gusts  of  Joy  or  Grief    Pleasure  or  Pain  stimulate and spur the  Nervous  Fibres and the  Coats  of the  Animal Tubes  and thereby give a  Celerity  and brisker Motion to their included Fluids for the same Time And the  Functions  of the  Heart  and  Lungs  being  involuntary  they have their more immediate Effects upon them Thus both sudden  Joy  and  Grief  make us  breath  short and quick and make our  Pulse  small and frequent The retaining our  Breath  for some Time for so far our  Breathing  is  voluntary  to reflect more  intensely  upon the painful Object forces at last a strong  Exspiration  which becomes a  Sigh  Thus a sudden painful  Idea  makes a quicker  Circulation  of the Blood and thereby throwing a greater  Quantity thereof upwards through the  proportionally  larger Branch of the  Aorta  makes it appear in the superficial Vessels of the  Face    Neck  and  Breast  and so produces a  Blush  which when longer continued and being very strong is dispersed over the whole Surface of the Body Hence the Observation of  Blushing at the Back of one's Hand  and the Reasons why we  sigh  upon some Occasions and  blush  upon others depend upon the different Structure of the  Organs  of  Pulsation  and  Respiration  A quick surprizing Pain of Mind acts upon the  Heart  because the Motion of the Heart is altogether  involuntary  So that a sudden  Constriction  takes place there immediately to increase the  Pulse  Whereas we have some Power over the  Breathing  we can stop or suspend it for a Time and when we are thinking  intensely  our Attention partly makes us hold our  Breath  and hence ensues  Sighing  rather than  Blushing  For the Pain being  slow  quickens the  Pulse  more gradually But if it continues long  both  Actions of  both  Organs are respectively produced and hence it comes to pass that upon  Anxiety    Concern  and  earnest Expectation  the  Pulse  is found quick and small and the  Breath  thick and difficult as Experience shews The same Principles will account for the Effects of  Fear  and  Anger  which make us change Colour and look  red  or  pale  as the Blood is accelerated or retarded in its Course The sudden  Gusts  of these Passions being thus accounted for when they become extreme they drive about the  Blood  with such a Hurricane that Nature is overset like a  Mill  by a  Flood  So that what drove it only quicker round before now intirely stops it and renders the Countenance  pale  and  ghastly  Sudden and great  Fear  or  Grief  do so convulse the Nervous  System  that sometimes they alter the Position of the Parts and fix them in a new one Thus the Hair stands on end in a  Fright  and the whole  System  of the Nerves becomes so  rigid  and  stiff  as to lose their  Elasticity  whereby the  Animal  Functions are stopp'd at once and  Fainting  and sometimes  Death  ensues  §  The  Chronical Passions  like  Chronical Diseases  wear out waste and destroy the  Nervous System  gradually Those  Nerves  which are necessary for  considering    brooding  over and  fixing  such a Set of  Ideas  on the  Imagination  being constantly employ'd are worn out broken and impaired The  rest  by Disuse become resty and unactive lifeless and destitute of a sufficient  Flux  of warm Blood and due Nourishment And thus the whole  System  languishes and runs into Decay Thus slow and long  Grief    dark Melancholy    hopeless natural Love  and overweening Pride which is an outragious Degree of  Selflove  impair the Habit by making the proper Seasons of necessary Food and due Labour be neglected and thereby depriving the natural  Functions  of their wonted Supplies overworking some Part of the  Nervous System  and leaving the other to  rust  and become  resty  for want of Use Some of these Passions as  Love    Grief  and  Pride  when very intense and long indulg'd terminate even in  Madness  The Reason is as I have been saying because long and constant Habits of  fixing  one Thing on the  Imagination  begets a ready Disposition in the  Nerves  to produce again the same  Image  till the Thought of it become  spontaneous  and natural like breathing or the Motion of the  Heart  which the  Machine  performs without the Consent of the  Will  and also a Disability or  Immobility  Tetanus  ensues on the other Parts just as the  Faquiers  in  India  fix one or both Hands by long holding them up so as that they cannot bring them down again There is a kind of  Melancholy  which is called  Religious  because 'tis conversant about Matters of  Religion  although often the Persons so distempered have little  solid Piety  And this is merely a  Bodily Disease  produced by an ill  Habit  or  Constitution  wherein the  Nervous System  is broken and disordered and the  Juices  are become  viscid  and  glewy  This Melancholy arises generally from a  Disgust  or  Disrelish  of worldly  Amusements  and  CreatureComforts  whereupon the Mind turns to  Religion  for  Consolation  and  Peace  But as the Person is in a very imperfect and unmortified State not duly instructed and disciplined and ignorant how to govern himself there ensues  Fluctuation  and  Indocility    Scrupulosity    Horror  and  Despair  §  Since the  Mind  resides as has been said in the common  Sensory  like  a skilful Musician by a  welltuned Instrument  if the  Organ  be sound duly tempered and exactly adjusted answering and corresponding with the Actions of the  Musician  the  Musick  will be  distinct    agreeable  and  harmonious  But if the  Organ  be spoiled and broken neither duly  tuned  nor justly fitted up it will not answer the Intention of the  Musician  nor yield any distinct Sound or true  Harmony  Those therefore who are  tender  and  valetudinary  lead  sedentary  Lives or indulge  contemplative  Studies ought to avoid Excesses of the  Passions  as they would Excesses in  high  Food or  Spirituous  Liquors if they have any Regard to Health to the Preservation or Integrity of their  Intellectual  Faculties or the bodily  Organs  of them As the  Passions  when  slow  and  continued    relax    unbend  and  dissolve  the  Nervous  Fibres so the sudden and violent ones  screw up    stretch  and  bend  them whereby the Blood and Juices are hurried about with a violent  Impetuosity  and all the  Secretions  are either stopp'd by the Constrictions Cramps and Convulsions begot by them or are precipitated crude and unconcocted and so beget or at least dispose  toward  Inflammations    Fevers  or  Mortifications Hatred  for Example  Anger  and  Malice  are but Degrees of a  Frenzy  and a  Frenzy  is one kind of a raging  Fever  From all which 'tis plain the  violent  and  sudden Passions  are more dangerous to  Health  than the  slow  and continued as  acute  Diseases are more destructive than  chronical  §  To shew yet farther the Influence of the  Passions  on the  Animal Oeconomy  let us consider the different Constitutions of Men Those who have very  springy    lively  and  elastick  Fibres have the  quickest Sensations  a weaker  Impulse  producing a stronger  Sensation  in them These generally excel in the  Animal  Faculty of Imagination Hence the Poet    Poets are soon provok'd  Genus irritabile Vatum  And therefore your Men of  Imagination  are generally given to  sensual  Pleasure because the Objects of  Sense  yield  them  a more delicate  Touch  and a livelier  Sensation  than they do  others  But if they happen to live so long which is  hardly possible in the  Decline  of Life they pay dearly for the greater bodily Pleasures they enjoyed in the Youthful Days of their  Vanity  Those of  rigid    stiff  and  unyielding  Fibres have  less vivid Sensations  because it requires a greater Degree of  Force  to overcome a greater  Resistance  Those excel most in the  Labours  of the  Understanding  or the  Intellectual  Faculties retain their  Impressions  longest and pursue them farthest and are most susceptible of the slow and lasting  Passions  which secretly consume them as  chronical  Diseases do And  Lastly  Those whose  Organs  of  Sensation  are if I may speak so  unelastick  or intirely  callous    resty  for want of Exercise or any way  obstructed  or naturally  illformed  as they have scarce any  Passions  at all or any lively Sensations and are incapable of lasting  Impressions  so they enjoy the  firmest  Health and are subject to the fewest  Diseases  such are  Ideots    Peasants  and  Mechanicks  and all those we call Indolent People  §  We have before shewn that weak  Limbs  and all the bodily  Organs  may be strengthened and repaired  by proper  Exercise  And there is no doubt to be made but the  Organs  of  Sensation  and those the Mind uses in its  intellectual Operations  may be likewise  improved    strengthened  and  perfected  by constant Use and proper  Application  And if by Excesses an original bad  Conformation  or any Accident these  Organs  come to be spoiled or by the bad State of the Juices they be weakned in their  Functions  then the  Medicinal  and  Chirurgical  Arts may take place and come in play But if the Passions be  raging  and  tumultuous  and constantly fuelled nothing less than  He  who has the  Hearts of Men in His Hands  and  forms them as a Potter does his Clay    who stills the Raging of the Seas    and calms the Tempests of the Air  can settle and quiet such tumultuous overbearing  Hurricanes  in the Mind and  Animal Oeconomy  Without such a  Miracle  since the  Soul  and  Body  act mutually upon one another and the Tabernacle of Clay is the weakest Part of the  Compound  it must at last be overborn and thrown down  §  In such a wretched Case I know no Remedy but to drown all other Passions in that Spiritual one of the  Love of God The Reasonableness and Justness of which Proceeding and what may seem a  Paradox  the Usefulness of it to Health and its benign Influence on the  Animal Oeconomy  I shall endeavour to  demonstrate Spiritual Love  is that Principle  analogous  to  Attraction  spoken of in  Prop  IV 'Tis the  Tendency    Byass  or  Impulse  of the Minds of Men and other Spirits toward the most  amiable  Objects communicated by their  Creator  in their  original Formation  by virtue of which they constantly  tend    press  and  urge  to unite and if Obstacles were removed would unite with one another and be all united with their  Origin  This  Principle  indeed in this  lapsed Estate  of Man where 'tis overlaid and buried under  Rubbish  involved in so many other  Attractions  and stifled with such  Letts  and  Contrarieties  that its Action is felt but just enough to know that it is and wants to be a waked with Labour and excited with  Violence  as the Scripture mentions the  taking the Kingdom of Heaven by Force  on its first  Developement  and  Expansion  and in its first Exercises may be called a Spiritual  Passion  as 'tis the first Motions Endeavours and  Velleities  toward the  Love  of God  or  Charity  But in its Advances and  final Perfection  and  Consummation  it discovers itself to be a  Faculty    Quality  or inherent  Power  in the  Soul  whereby it will act without  Solicitation    Motive  or  Direction  As a  Stone  in a  Wall  fastened with  Mortar  compressed by surrounding  Stones  and involved in a  Million  of other  Attractions  cannot fall to the  Earth  nor sensibly exert its natural  Gravity  no not so much as to discover there is such a Principle in it just so the  intelligent Soul  in this her  lapsed  Estate being  drowned  in Sense  chained  and  fettered  by Ignorance and Perverseness drawn and hurried away by the  Devil  the  World  and the  Flesh  is disabled from exerting this inherent and innate Principle of  Reunion  and wants sufficient  Light  on the  Understanding  and a right  Turn  of the  Will  to be put in a Capacity of exercising it But in its proper  Vacuity  and being freed from these  Letts  and  Impediments  it would mount towards its  Original  like an  Eagle  toward the  Sun Amiability    Pulchritude  or  Beauty  is as much the peculiar and proper Object of this Affection of the  Mind  as  Light  or a  luminous  Body is of  Vision  for  Deformity    as such can never be loved And  Beauty  or  Perfection  is in Reality and just Philosophy nothing but  Analogy    Order  or just  Proportion  From hence it necessarily follows that in the Scale of Beings all Objects ought to be loved in proportion to their Degree of  Beauty    Symmetry  or  Perfection  And consequently the highest  Perfection  ought to be loved with the  highest  Degree of  Love  and the several  subordinate  Degrees of  Perfection  with proportionate Degrees of this  Affection  of the Mind And since  Finite  when compared with  Infinite  evanishes quite or becomes  nothing  it follows necessarily since there is and can be but  one  Object that is  Infinite    Good  and  Perfect  and all others are but  Created  and  Finite Goods  that is in  Comparison  they are nothing that according to the  eternal  and immutable  Laws  of  Analogy  the  One supreme Good  endued with  Infinite Perfection  ought to be loved with a  Love  infinitely superior to our Affections for  other  Things or which is the same Thing in other Words that in  Comparison  our  Love  to the Author of our Being ought to be  infinite  and that to ourselves and other Objects as  being  finite  Creatures none at all This is the true  Philosophy  of this Matter and as much a  Demonstration  as any thing in  Numbers  or  Geometry  possibly can be however it may be received by Men of  SelfLove  and  Carnal Minds  §  Yet I would not be so understood as if I condemned all  subordinate  and duly  proportioned Regards  for  ourselves  and other  Objects  about us that are necessary for our Support and Accommodation in our present State No There is a  just  and  laudable  Selflove as well as a  false  and  vitious  one If we love  Ourselves  as we love our  Neighbours  if we love  Ourselves  as  God  loves us if we love  Ourselves  as we deserve to be loved by the  infinitely perfect Being  if we love  Ourselves  with a justly proportioned and duly subordinate  Love  that is if we love  Ourselves  with a  Finite  and  Him  with an  Infinite Love  or a  Love  increasing and going on  in infinitum  that has neither Limits nor End Then we love  Ourselves  as we ought this  Selflove  is just and laudable and has its due and proper Degree of  Reality  and  Existence  in the Nature of Things  Perfection  or  an Object perfect in its kind or one that we think so is the proper Object of our  Love  And as in due  Analogy  Proportion and Order  infinite  Perfection requires  infinite  Love or the highest Degree of  Love  we can give it so all other  Objects  are to be loved with a Degree of  Love  proportioned to their  Perfection  And since a Being of  infinite Perfection  can be but  one  and all other Beings can have but a  finite  Degree of Perfection we must love them but with a  finite  Love or the  Proportion  of our Love to Him and them ought to be as  Infinite  is to  Finite  That is comparatively we ought to love them with  no Love  at all but absolutely or without comparing  created  Things to the  infinitely perfect Being  with their proper Degree of  finite  Love according to their  Rank  in the  Scale  of Beings  Coroll  Tho' from the Nature of the  Demonstration  I have given that  God  is to be loved it is evident he is to be loved  infinitely  for  Himself  and his own  infinite Perfections  abstracting from all other Considerations even that of our  own Happiness  in the Enjoyment of or  Union with Him Yet it is certain these  Two  our  Love  to  God  and  our own Happiness  cannot be actually separated  Pleasure  consists in this That the  Soul  and  Body  are affected by the Objects that produce it with an  harmonious  and  commensurate  Action or Touch for in their  original  and  uncorrupted Make  as they came from the Hands of their  Creator    both  separately and  each  by themselves and also in their Actions on one another all was  Harmony  and  Concord  As to the  Body  as nothing but a  musical  or  commensurate  Touch can affect it with Pleasure and as a  discordant  and  uncommensurate  Stroke creates a  Jarring    Grating  and  Obstruction  which is Pain this is evident in  Hearing  where the agreeable Sensations of sonorous Bodies are altogether  harmonious  Sir  Isaac Newton  has made it plain in  Vision  And no Doubt it is so in all the  other Senses  So likewise as to the Soul  Truth  and  Beauty  or  Perfection  are the only Objects that give  Pleasure  to the  Understanding  and  Will  its two  Cardinal  Faculties And these are nothing but  Harmony  or just  Proportion  in the respective Objects And we have shewn  that the Union of the Soul and Body or  Life  the so much coveted Good consists in a kind of  Harmonia praestabilita  though a kind very different from Mr  Leibnitz's  whereby an  harmonious Touch  or Action upon either of them produces a  pleasurable  Sensation Now as  Beauty  or  Perfection  gives Pleasure to both the Parts of the Compound and as nothing but the highest Degree of  Perfection  or  Beauty  can give the greatest Pleasure  i e  Happiness it necessarily follows That  Spiritual Love  or the  Love of God  as it is the only Mean of  uniting  us with the one Being who is  infinitely perfect  is also the only Mean of making us  infinitely happy  §  As to the  second  Thing proposed concerning  Spiritual Love  however foreign these  metaphysical Speculations  concerning it may seem to a Discourse about  Health  and  Long Life  yet if steadily believed and their natural Consequences reduced to  Practice  they would not only become the most effectual Means to prevent  Diseases  but also the most of any Thing promote  Health  and  Long Life  For  first  Were our  Love  proportioned to the  Order  and  Analogy  of Things were our  Love  to the  Supreme Good infinite  and that to others in Comparison  none at all  we should have but one single View in all our  Thoughts    Words  and  Actions  viz The  Promoting  and  Raising  that  supreme Love  to its due Degree and  Elevation  whereby all  Anxiety    carking Care  and  Solicitude  about other Things the Source of all our  Miseries  and of many Bodily  Diseases  would be  cut  off all at once  Secondly  Since  Love  always begets  Resemblance  of Manners since the Object of this  Love  is  infinitely perfect  if we loved him in the  supreme Degree  we should  infinitely  endeavour to  resemble him  whereby  Hatred  and  Malice    Luxury  and  Lewdness    Laziness  and all the other  Seeds  of Bodily  Diseases  would be altogether  destroyed Thirdly  Since  Spiritual Love  is not only the  noblest  but also the most  joyful  and  pleasant  Affection of the Mind since the Object of our  supreme Love  as an  inspired Poet  expresses it has  Fulness of Joy in his Presence and Rivers of Pleasures at his Right Hand for ever  and since our  Joy  and  Happiness  will always rise in proportion to our  Love  the placing our  supreme Love  on the  supreme Good    would render us  infinitely joyful    serene    calm  and  pleased  than which certainly no Man can imagine a more effectual  Mean  of  Health  and  Long Life  RULES of  Health  and  Long Life  drawn from the  Head  Of the PASSIONS  THE  Passions  have a greater Influence on  Health  than most People are aware of  All  violent  and  sudden  Passions dispose to or actually throw People into  acute  Diseases and sometimes the  most violent  of them bring on  sudden  Death  The  slow  and  lasting  Passions bring on  chronical  Diseases as we see in Grief and languishing hopeless Love  Therefore the  sudden  and  acute  Passions are  more dangerous  than the  slow  or  chronical  Men of lively Imaginations and great  Vivacity  are more liable to the  sudden  and  violent  Passions and their Effects    Thoughtful  People and those of good Understanding suffer most by the  slow  and  secretly consuming  Passions  The  Indolent  and the Thoughtless suffer  least  from the Passions The  Stupid  and Ideots  not at all  The  Diseases  brought on by the Passions may be  cured  by  Medicine  as well as those proceeding from other Causes when once the Passions themselves cease or are quieted But the  preventing  or  calming  the Passions themselves is the Business not of Physick but of  Virtue  and  Religion  The  Love of God  as it is the sovereign Remedy of all  Miseries  so in particular it effectually  prevents  all the Bodily  Disorders  the Passions introduce by keeping the Passions themselves within due Bounds and by the unspeakable Joy and perfect Calm Serenity and Tranquillity  it gives the Mind becomes the most  powerful  of all the  Means  of  Health  and  Long Life  CHAP VII Containing those OBSERVATIONS that came not naturally under the foregoing Heads  §  MENTION having been so often made of  Chronical  and sometimes of  Acute  Distempers it may be convenient here to suggest to the Readers as clear an Account of their Nature and Difference as I possibly can  Acute  Distempers then are understood Such as within some short  limited Time  have their Periods either of a perfect  Crise  and subsequent Recovery or of putting an End to the  Distemper  and  Life  both together and are therefore called  quick    sharp  or  acute  Distempers whose Symptoms are more violent their Duration shorter and their Periods more  quick  either of  sudden Death  or a glorious  Victory  over the Disease These are generally limited within  Forty Days  And those that run out longer turn into  chronical  Distempers whose Periods are more slow their  Symptoms  less severe and their  Duration  longer They too if new Fuel were not administred to them would by the Course of  Nature  and the  Animal Oeconomy  have their  Periods  and terminate at the last The  Viscidity  of the  Juices  and the  Flaccidity  of the  Fibres  would in a great measure and to some very tolerable Degree by  proper Remedies  and a due  Regimen  be removed and the Party recover in  these  as well as  acute  Cases But this requiring long Time much Care and great Caution unwearied Patience and Perseverance and so long a Course of  Selfdenial  as few People are willing to undergo it is become the  Reproach  of  Physick  and  Physicians  that  acute  Cases cure themselves or rather Nature cures them and  chronical  Cases are never cured But both the Branches of the Reflexion  are equally false In the First  Art  and  Care  judiciously applied will always  alleviate  the  Symptoms  and Suffering will help on Nature to the  Relief  she points out and quicken the  Crise  which it will constantly bring about if the  Distemper  is not too strong for the  Constitution  And even then it will  mitigate  the  Pain  and lay the  Patient  gently and easily down But in the  last Case  if due Care be had to follow timeously the Advice of an  honest  and  experienced Physician  a  Period  certainly may be brought about to most  chronical Distempers  where the great  Viscera  are not spoiled and destroyed The Failing is in the  Patient  himself who will not or cannot  deny himself  for a Time sufficient to bring about the  Cure  Some  chronical Distempers  indeed are such either by having gone  too far  or by being  Hereditary  and interwoven with the  Principles  of Life as never to be totally overcome And then 'tis a Piece of  great Wisdom  to know how far their Constitution will go and sit down contented with that  measure of Health  their  original  Frame will admit of But of this I am morally certain If the  Rules  and  Cautions  laid down in this  Treatise    be  carefully    steadily  and  constantly  observed few  chronical  Distempers but will receive such  Relief  and  Alleviation  by them as to make Life  tolerably easy  and free from  grievous Sufferings  And in the mentioned  Case  that is all that is left for  Art  to do But in other  chronical  Distempers taken in  due Time  where the  Viscera  are not quite spoiled they would infallibly bring about a  final Period  and perfect Cure The most certain distinguishing Mark of an  acute  Distemper is To have a  quick Pulse  that of a  Chronical  To have a  slow  one The first will exhaust the  Fluids  and wear out the  Solids  in a  short  Time whereas the  last  will require a longer Time to produce the same Effect Some  chronical  Distempers especially towards the  last  and  fatal  Period turn  acute  And some  acute  ones terminate in  chronical  Distempers But this  Mark  will not only keep them distinct but also point out when  acute  Distempers have  chronical  Remissions or Intermissions and when  chronical  Distempers have  acute  Fits or Paroxysms  §  Some Persons who are extremely healthy and sound during  their  younger  Days about or soon after the  Meridian  of Life that is about Thirtyfive or Thirtysix according to the Observation of an  inspired King  fall into  chronical  Distempers which cut them off in few Years or make them miserable all the rest of their Lives Thus  Consumptions  prove mortal to some about that Time Thus  Stone  and  Gravel    Gout  and  Rheumatism    Scurvy  and  Dropsy    King'sEvil  and  SkinDiseases  either make their  first  Appearances or shew themselves in their true  Type  about this Time of Life The Reason is While the  Juices  are sweet sufficiently thin and fluid but especially while the  solid  Organs the  Membranes  and  Fibres  are yet but  unfolding    stretching  and  drawing  out to their full  Dimensions  any  Acrimony  Sharpness or  corroding  Humour can affect them no other Way than by making them  vibrate  and so extend themselves farther and farther For as Pain so these sharp Salts by their Twitching and  Irritation  on the tender  Fibres  make them only contract and so draw at both  Extremities  and thereby unfold and extend themselves farther So while the  original Foldings  and  Complications  of  the  Solids  are not yet quite extended this  Irritation  serves only to draw them out and does not hurt them till they are arrived at their full  Extent  which generally happens about Fiveandtwenty It takes a  due  Time after that for these  sharp  Humours to  exalt  themselves to their utmost  Acrimony  to corrupt and putrify the Juices and also some more Time to  wear  out to obstruct and break the great  Organs  and their smaller  capillary  Vessels The Sum of all which brings the  Periods  of the great Attacks of these Distempers to the mentioned  Time  of  Life  Those in whom the  original Taint  is deeper and more radicated and the natural Constitution  weaker  suffer under these Attacks  sooner  And those in whom it is  slighter  and more superficial and whose Complexion is  stronger  and more  hardy  hold out  longer  But the Generality suffer first  eminently  about the  Meridian  of Life Hence the common Observation of those that die of a genuine  Consumption  that they begin to feel it first before  Thirtysix  §  There is no  chronical  Distemper whatsoever more  universal  more  obstinate    and more  fatal  in  Britain  than the  Scurvy  taken in its general Extent Scarce any one  chronical  Distemper but owes its  Origin  to a  Scorbutick Cachexie  or is so complicated with it that it furnishes its most cruel and most obstinate  Symptoms  To it we owe all the  Dropsies  that happen after the  Meridian  of Life all  Diabetes    Asthma's    Consumptions  of several kinds many sorts of  Colicks  and  Diarrhaea's  some kinds of  Gouts  and  Rheumatisms  all  Palsies  various kinds of  Ulcers  and possibly the  Cancer  itself and most  cutaneous  Foulnesses weakly Constitutions and bad Digestions  Vapours    Melancholy  and almost all  nervous  Distempers whatsoever And what a plentiful  Source  of Miseries these last are the  Afflicted  best can tell And scarce any one  chronical  Distemper whatsoever but has some Degree of this  Evil  faithfully attending it The Reason why the  Scurvy  is so  Peculiar to this Country  endemick  a Distemper and so fruitful of  Miseries  is that it is produced by  Causes  mostly special and particular to this  Island  to wit The indulging so much in  animal Food  and  strong  fermenting Liquors in  contemplative  Studies and  sedentary  Professions  and Employments and thence the Want of due  Labour  and  Exercise  together with the  nitrous  Moisture of an  Island  and the  Inconstancy  and  Inclemency  of the Seasons thence arising I have had many Occasions to shew how such  Causes  must necessarily and naturally produce such  Effects  I will here only touch the Matter slightly to point out the  Connexion Animal Foods  and  strong Liquors  to  Excess  and with Continuance must load and charge the  Fluids  with their  Salts  Want of due  Exercise  must suffer these to unite in  Clusters  and increase their  Bulk  in the small Vessels Their  larger Bulk  and greater  Acrimony  thence arising must increase the  Viscidity  of the  Fluids  by breaking the  Blood Globules  and so  coagulating  the Mass and at last obstruct the  finer  Pipes and all the smaller  Glands  Whereby the  Tone  of all the  elastick  Fibres must be interrupted and broken and their Vibrations stopt at every obstructed  Gland  and  capillary  Vessel and an universal  Disorder  produced in the whole  animal Oeconomy  And this Disorder will operate and shew it self in  Symptoms  special and particular according to the special and particular  Make  and  Conformation  of the Parts the Weakness or the Strength of the  Organs  the particular Mismanagements and precise State of the  Air  the Party lives in And the  Detail  of these general Causes applied to particular Persons must produce the  respective  Diseases mentioned In a Word The  Scurvy  is a kind of  Catholick  Distemper here in  Britain  arising from  constant  and  general Causes  from the  Customs  of the People and from the  Nature  of the  Climate  which renders the serous Part of the Blood too  thick  and  glewy  breaks and divides the Union of the  globulous  Parts obstructs the  small  Vessels and destroys the  Springiness  and  Elasticity  of the  Fibres  So that most  chronical  Distempers can be little else but  Branches  and  Cions  from this  Root  which like  Pandora  's Box is so fruitful of Variety of Mischiefs And its arising from the  Climate  and  Customs  of the People is the Reason why  chronical  Distempers are so frequent in  Britain  to what they are in  warmer Climates  which by a  freer Perspiration  and  lighter Diet  not only prevent those  Diseases  in their own  Inhabitants  but  universally  cure those of our  Island  who are afflicted with them  if they flee to those  Regions  any  reasonable Time  before Nature be quite worn out For though the Inhabitants of  Britain  live for the most part as  long  or rather  longer  than those of  warmer  Climates yet scarce any one especially those of the  better  Sort but becomes  crasy  and suffers under some  chronical  Distemper or other before they arrive at  old Age  The same Reason is to be assigned for the Frequency of  Selfmurders  here in  England  especially beyond any other Country For few have  Grace  and  Resignation  enough to suffer patiently the lasting Pains of a  chronical  Distemper or the yet more  torturing  and  crucifying Anguish  of a perpetual  Dispiritedness  though I have observed  generally  and have good Reason to conclude  universally  That all  Selfmurderers  are first  distracted  and distempered in their  intellectual  Faculties Notwithstanding the  Diffusiveness  and  Universality  of this Disease so that scarce a single Individual of the  better  Sort is altogether free from it yet I never once in my Life saw it  totally extirpated  in those who had it to any Degree so as to be intirely free from it all the rest of their Lives after but that it still appeared  and sprang up again in some  Symptom  or other and at last brought forth that  grand one  which put a  final Period  to all their Sufferings One good Reason for this is That it requires a  Regimen  and  Conduct  so intirely  contrary  and  opposite  to the  natural Habits  and  Customs  and the universal  Bent  and  Appetites  of the Inhabitants of this  Island  that it becomes a kind of perpetual  Selfdenial  to them which the  British Nation  in general does not mightily admire Another Reason is That  fine Folks  use their  Physicians  as they do their  Laundresses  send their Linen to them to be cleaned in order only to be dirtied again Nothing less than a very moderate Use of  animal Food  and that of the Kind which abounds least in  urinous Salts  as most certainly the young and the lightercoloured do and a more moderate use of  Spirituous Liquors    due Labour  and  Exercise  and a careful guarding against the  Inconstancy  and  Inclemency  of the  Seasons  can keep this  Hydra  under And nothing else than a  total Abstinence  from  animal Foods  and  strong fermented Liquors  can totally extirpate it And that too must be begun  early before or soon after the  Meridian  of Life or else there will remain too little  Oil  in the  Lamp  the  Spirits  will sink too far ever to be recovered again and the remaining Part of Life will be too short for so total a Change as must be made So that those who suffer greatly under this  British  Distemper must be contented to  bear  and  forbear  a little and must expect no greater  Degree of Health  than their  Time of Life  the  Nature  of their Disease and the State of their  Constitution  will admit of But still a great Moderation in  animal Foods  and  spirituous and fermented Liquors    due Exercise  and a Care to fence against the  Injuries  of the Weather will make Life tolerably easy especially if some gentle domestick  Purges  be interspersed The  Seeds  and young  Sprouts  of Vegetables have scarce any gross  fix'd  or  essential Salts  at all in them This is not only evident from the Reasons formerly given because they are young or the Nourishment appointed by Nature for young Vegetables for the  Earth  is only a proper  Nest  or  Matrix  for them and the  Sun  's Heat serves them instead  of  Incubation  but upon  See  Lowth  Abridg of Phil Trans  v    p    Trial  and  Examination  they yield none being too light and thin to  calcine  and  incinerate  and the  Salts  too  volatile  and consequently small and fit to pass by  Perspiration  and thereby can be no way injurious to  Human Constitutions  to endure the  Fire  which fullgrown  Plants  their  Stalks  and  Wood  readily do And in  unfermented Liquors  the  Salts  are so  enveloped  that they cannot unite to form a  Spirit  and are so  sheathed  by particular Coats of the  Materials  of the  Vegetable  that they can scarce do any harm except when they exceedingly abound to  animal  Bodies Hence it comes to pass that a  vegetable  Diet for a few Weeks or Months together with drinking Water or unfermented Liquors such as  Tea    Coffee    BarleyWater    LiquoriceWater    Teas  made of  Oranges  or other Seeds and Plants will fasten the Teeth when dropping out from a  Consumption  of the  Gums  by  scorbutick Salts  cure any  cutaneous Foulnesses  or  Eruptions  and even any spreading  Ulcer  if it is not  Scrofulous  when no  Medicine on the Face of the Earth will touch it Hence the grand  Maxim  in the Cure of all  Ulcers  is by  Diet  to bring them to the State of a  Wound  and then they will cure of themselves And as I have elsewhere observed there is scarce a  thin    consumptive    hysterick  or  hypochondriack  and weakly Constitution in  England  which has not for its Parent a latent or manifest  scorbutick Cachexy  excepting that which arises from a  Scrofula  From the whole we may gather how much a  proper Regimen  of  Diet  and  due Exercise  with the other  Helps  and  Remedies  already mentioned in this  Treatise  is able to do in most  British chronical  Distempers  §  Having had so often Occasion to speak of weak and relaxed Nerves it will not be amiss to  suggest  some of the outward and most sensible  Signs  and  Characters  whereby it may be manifest whether  one's self  or any  particular  Person he is concerned for be of this  Make  and  Constitution  before some  chronical  Distemper or other dismal  Symptom  has made it plain in order to prevent  these  as far as possible To which purpose we must observe that the  Nerves  are  Bundles of  solid    springy  and  elastick  Threads or  Filaments  like twisted  CatGuts  or  Hairs  whose one  Extremity  is terminated at the  common Sensory  in the  Brain  where the  Soul  is supposed to reside the  other  is interwoven into every Point of the  Scarfskin  the  Membranes  the  Coats  of the  Vessels  the  Muscles  and the other  sensible Solids  of the Body in order to convey the  Motions    Actions    Vibrations  or  Impulses  of outward  Objects  to the  Soul  These  Threads  or  Filaments  are highly  elastick  or  springy  as we may see from their hardned Substances such as  Whalebone    Ivory    Horn  and  Cartileges  which are more eminently  so  than any other Bodies known Some Persons have their  Fibres  very  quick  readily  vibrating  highly  springy  and  elastick  so as to  tremble  and  shake  violently by the least  Impulse  Others have more  rigid    firm  and  stretched Fibres  which yield not but to strong  Impressions  and move slowly but move for a long Time  Lastly  There are those who have  weak    loose    slender  and  relaxed Fibres  which though easily moved and yielding to the weakest  Impulse  yet communicate only  imperfect    languid  and  faint Impressions  and  Vibrations  to  the  Soul  and have all their other  Animal Functions  of the same  languishing  Nature And 'tis of these last I have been all along speaking And we may readily discover them by these outward  Characters  and  Signs  Those who have naturally  soft    thin    small  and  short Hair  are of a  loose    flabby  and  relaxed  State of  Nerves  For the  Hair  seems to be some of the fleshy  Fibres  only lengthen'd outwards and harden'd At least like the  Fibres  they consist of a great many lesser  Filaments  contained in a common  Membrane  are  solid    transparent  and  elastick  And as these Hairs are in  Strength  and  Bulk  so generally the  Fibres  of the Body are Those of the  fairest Hair  are of the  loosest Fibres  other Things being equal because the  Fairest  are more  rare    porous  and  fungous  And because Bodies of the  lighter  Colours consist of  smaller  Parts than those of the more flaming Colours as has been formerly observed Those of large or as they are called  mastiff Muscles  and of  big Bones  are generally of a firmer State of  Nerves  than those of  little Muscles  and  Bones  Because the  Muscles  and  Bones  being  similar  to their  Fibres  as is highly  probable and these being  bigger  and consequently stronger so must those be and on the contrary  Soft    yielding    pappy  Flesh is a sure  Symptom  of  loose Fibres  whereas  hard    firm  and  unyielding Muscles  are the constant Sign of  firm Fibres  A  white    fair    blanch'd  or  ashen  coloured  Complexion  or  Skin  constantly indicates a  weaker  and more  relaxed  State of  Fibres  than a  ruddy    fresh    dark sallow  or  black Hue  for Reasons already given A fat  corpulent  and  flegmatick  Constitution is always attended with  loose    flabby  and  relaxed Fibres  by their being dissolved and  oversoaked  in  Moisture  and  Humidity  And on the contrary those of a  dry    clean  and  firm Make  have  strong    firm  and  tense Fibres  Those who are subject to  Evacuations  of any kind in any Degree greater than what is natural and those who by any  Accident  have suffered long by any  preternatural Evacuation  whatsoever are or become of  loose    relaxed Fibres  and  Nerves  Thus those who frequently run into  Purging  or  Floods  of pale  Water    flow  at the Mouth or Nose or  melt  into profuse  Sweats  those who any Way have lost much  Blood  have had a  Diarrhoea  have recovered of  a  Fever  and those of the  Sex  who have  purified  longer or more than is usual all of these are  originally  or become  accidentally  of  weak  and  relaxed Nerves  and  Fibres    Lastly  Those who are of a  cold Constitution  are apt to run into  Coldnesses  on their  Extremities  or ready to catch  Cold  are also of  weak  and  loose Fibres  and  Nerves  because these are Signs of a  slow  and  interrupted Circulation  and  Perspiration  which manifests a weak  Spring  in the  Fibres  of the  Coats  of the  Vessels  the  Fibres  of the  Muscles  and a Weakness of the  Spring  of the  Scales  of the  Scarfskin  §  On this Occasion of rehearsing the Signs of weak Nerves I cannot omit  apprising  those of the breeding Part of the  Sex  and those who are concerned in them of their Readiness of  Miscarrying  unless duly tended and managed especially those of them of  tender  and  weak Nerves  or of too  delicate  a  Constitution  The Signs I have now laid down will always make it evident if any  particular  Person is so or not And if upon  Examination  they be found to be  such  they will be apt upon the slightest Occasion to run into frequent  Miscarriages  whereby a great Part of their  Posterity  will be destroyed and they themselves exposed to  Dropsies  or  Consumptions  or which is worse than either perpetual  Lowness  of  Spirits    Vapours  and other  Hysterick  Disorders And by this Misfortune alone a considerable Part of the  better Sort  here in  England  perish and are lost  Nature  has formed the Generality of the Sex of a  soft    slender  and  delicate Make  Want of due  Exercise  a full  Table  indiscreet  Nurses  overfond  Mothers  and  Hereditary  Sharpnesses make them much more so And if by  Neglect  or  Accident  they once begin to  miscarry  every  first Miscarriage  paves the Way for a  second  and a  third  and so on till the  poor    pretty Creature  has neither  Blood  nor  Spirits    Appetite  nor  Digestion  left For one Miscarriage weakens the  Constitution  breaks and tears the  nervous System  more than two  mature Births  If ever this is to be secured or prevented effectually 'tis to be done at least attempted in the  first Instance  if possible at least as soon as may be before a total  Relaxation  and  Dissolution  of the  nervous System  is brought on The  Giddiness    Romping  and  Gadding  about of the young Creature  herself is often the Cause of her  Miscarriage  But oftner the  Forwardness  and  Indiscretion  of  Surgeons  and  Midwives  by  bleeding  on every little threatning  Symptom  without considering the  Constitution Bleeding  may do well enough in  sanguine    robust  and  plethorick  Constitutions But 'tis  Death  and certain  Rain  to those of  slender  and weak  Nerves  and the surest  Way  to cause the  Miscarriage  'tis designed to prevent by  relaxing  the  Nervous  Fibres which  Bleeding  does as certainly as it lessens the  Quantity  of the  Blood  The most effectual  Method  I have ever found to prevent such  Misfortunes  is To order those in such Circumstances to drink plentifully  Bristol Water  with a very little  red Wine  for their  constant Drink  to lay the  Plaister ad Herniam  with  Oil  of  Cinnamon  and  London Laudanum  in a due Proportion to their  Reins  to keep them to a  low    light    easily digested Diet  especially of the  farinaceous Vegetables  and  milk Meats  to strengthen their Bowels with  Diascordium  and  toasted Rhubarb  if they become too  slippery  to  air  them once or twice a Day in a  Coach  or  Chair  and to keep them  cheerful  and in good  Humour  as much as  may be This  Method  will scarce ever fail unless a latent  Scrofula  or some other  Hereditary Sharpnesses  in their  Juices  destroy the  Birth  §  The  Tender    Sickly  and those of  weak Nerves  ought to have a Regard in the  Conduct  of their  Health  to the different  Seasons  of the  Year  I have elsewhere  Essay on the Gout  observed that such  Constitutions  begin to  sink    droop  and  languish  about  Christmas  or  Midwinter  go on from  worse  to  worse  till the  Spring  is over  get up  a little as the  Sun  grows  higher  and  stronger  arrive at their  Meridian Altitude  of  Health  and  Strength  about  Midsummer  and hold it out so long as the  Sun  warms them or the  Strength  they have acquired lasts Those who have very weak  Nerves    fail sooner  even about the  Autamnal Equinox  But they get up  sooner  because their weaker  Nerves  make less  Resistance  The  Sun new ferments    rarifies  and  exalts  their  viscid Juices  So that the  Circulation  is better performed more  full    free  and  universal  The  Perspiration  is also thereby much  increased  and  promoted  And the Load being drawn off by the Force of the  Sun's  Heat their  Appetite  is sharpen'd and their  Digestion  mended To which the  serene    warm  and  clear Air  and the greater Liberty of  Exercise  and  Business  contributes I should advise such therefore  religiously  to follow the  Indications  of  Nature  and to take these  Benefits  it offers  then  as a certain  Sign  of their being  best  and  fittest  for them After  Christmas  and in the Beginning of the  Spring    Milk    Eggs  and  SpringHerbs  as  Asparagus    Spinach  and  Sprouts  come in  first  Of which I advise them to make the greatest Part of their  Diet  then As the  Spring  advances  Lamb  and  Veal    Green Pease  and  Sallading  abound After the  vernal Equinox    Chicken  and  Rabbit  young  Turkies  and  early Fruit  come in  Season  About  Midsummer    Mutton  and  Partridge    Colliflower  and  Artichoak  may be had And  Autumn  brings in  Beef  and  Venison    Turnip  and  Carrot  And it will be found the  concoctive Powers  of weak Persons and those of  relaxed Nerves    rise  and  fortify  gradually as these  stronger  Foods come in  Season  By  Season  I mean not those  earlier  Days that  Luxury  in the  Buyers  and  Avarice  in the  Sellers  about  London  have forced the several kinds of  Vegetables  and  Animals  in But by  Season  I mean that  Time  of the  Year  in which by  Nature  common  Culture  and the mere  Operation  of the  Sun  and  Climate  they are in most  Plenty  and  Perfection  in this  Country  But the principal  Point  I would  urge  is That  such  Persons would regularly begin to correspond with  Nature  in both  lessening  the  Quantity  and  lowering  the  Quality  of their  Food  as the  Seasons  indicate and Providence provides the proper Food in greatest Plenty and Perfection By which they will preserve the  Ballance  of their  Health  pretty near  equal  all the Year round have the  lightest  and  least Food  when their  concoctive Powers  are  least  and their  nervous Fibres weakest  and  rise  in the Food in  proportion  as these  rise  Add to these That as  Winter  is best for  Home Exercises    Summer  is fittest for those without  Doors  And as the  Day  lengthens their  Labour  and  Exercises abroad  ought to be lengthened out Neither  Sydenham  nor  Fuller  have been able to tell the Half of what obstinate  Exercise  will do in low cachectick consumptive Cases  q d  Unweary'd Exercise will overcome any chronical Distemper  Labor omnia vincit  Improbus  HORAT  §  The  Germans  have a  Proverb  That  wise Men  ought to put on their  Winter  Cloaths  early  in  Autumn  and put them off  late  in the  Spring  By which they would insinuate that People ought always to go  wellcloathed  Whatever may be in this as to Persons that drink hard and require a plentiful  Discharge  by the  Skin  those who are  sober  or who would render themselves  hardy  ought to accustom themselves to as few Cloaths both in  Summer  and  Winter  as is possible Besides the general  Rule  of having as few  Necessaries  as may be  much  and  heavy  Cloaths  attract  and  draw  too much by  Perspiration  as Dr  Keill  proves in his  Med Static Britann tender  and  debilitate  the Habit and weaken the Strength The Custom of wearing  Flanel  is almost as bad as a  Diabetes  Nothing  can  enfeeble  and  drain    weak  and  tender  Persons more To make this clear we must distinguish between  Perspiration  and  Sweating  which differ as widely as the daily  natural Emptying  our Bowels and a  Looseness  or  Diarrhaea  And as no Body in their Senses much less the Tender and Weakly would endeavour to encourage this  last  no more ought they that other of Sweating For as promoting  slippery  Bowels would always keep the  Fibres  of the  alimentary  Passages  relaxed  so would perpetual  Sweating  those of the  Skin  And as the  Moisture  and  Damps  that  Flanel  perpetually keeps the Skin in and its growing so readily  dirty  shews what a  Flux  of  Perspiration  it promotes there so the perpetual  Friction  produced by it gives the  Reason  If one lays on a  superfluous Load  of  strong Liquors  'tis happy for him Nature  discharges  the  Ocean  any how for he had better  sweat  than burn in a  Fever  But for  temperate    tender  and  sickly  Persons the more  firm  and  tight  all the  Organs  of their  Evacuations  be if they be not totally  obstructed  the  better  it will be for them the more it will  strengthen  their  Nerves  and  harden  their  Constitution  Nothing but  Superfluity  in  Food  or  strong Liquors  requires  Sweating  And that is the  Reason  the  Germans  run so much upon it So far that  In his  Medicina Mentis Corporis  Tschirnhaus  a very  learned  and  ingenious Gentleman  otherwise resolves the  Cure  of almost all  Distempers  into  Sweating  upon observing its Success in their  BottleFevers  They drink much  thin sharp Wine  which passes every way and when it comes through the  Skin  both the  Conflict  and the  Danger  is over But for those Inhabitants of our  Islands  who are  sober  because they are  tender  or would preserve their  Health  the  lighter  and  fewer  their  Cloaths  are both by  Night  and by  Day  in  Summer  and  Winter  the  hardier  they will grow The more open the whole Body is to the  Air  provided it be  benign  the more  fluid  and the more  active  will the  Animal Juices  be and by consequence the more  full  and  free  will the  Perspiration  be For right tempered  Air  is beneficial and  medicinal  to the  Animal Juices  And a great Heap of  Cloaths  only  condenses  our own  excrementitious  Atmosphere  about us and stops the kindly  Influence  of this beneficial  Element  As to catching  Cold  he that lives  soberly  and avoids  nitrous  that is  moist  or  frosty Air  will either not readily catch  Cold  or if he does will soon get rid of it It is only  Air  thus  conditioned  that  thickens  and  coagulates  our  Juices  and gives painful and dangerous  Colds  It is  inward Heat  only which destroys us No  sober Persons  ever suffered by  Cold  unless it were  extreme  or that they expose themselves  obstinately  to it against  Sense  and  Reason  §  Another Mean of  Health  to the  Tender    Studious  and  Sedentary  is much and often  shaving Head  and  Face  and  washing    scraping  and  paring  their  Feet  and  Toes  The great Benefit besides the Pleasure to the  Head    Eyes  and  Ears  by often  shaving  the  Head  and  Face  and  washing  them Daily in  cold Water  with a few  Drops  of the  Compound Spirit of Lavender  or  Hungary Water  is best understood by those that have felt it The Cutting off the  Hair  and  shaving  the  Head  will in the  first  Instance scarce fail to cure a  Headach  a  Fluxion  or even a nervous  Weakness  of the  Eyes  Any one  Evacuation  will not only lessen the  whole Mass  but if encouraged will make that  Evacuation  more ample and full The more and oftner the  Hair  is  shaved  the  faster  and  thicker  it will  grow  So that thus  shaving  the  Head  and  Face  frequently will be like an  Issue  or perpetual  Blister  on these  Parts  Besides the  Washing  with  warm Water  and  Soap  and  scraping  the  Skin  with a  Razor  will  cleanse  the Mouths of the  Perspiratory Ducts  from that  Morphew  and  Scurf  that adheres to them and will extremely encourage the  Perspiration  from these Parts and give a full and free  Vent  to the  Fumes  on the  Head  and  Brain  And  washing  well and  dipping  in  cold Water  afterwards will shut the  Scales  of the  Scarfskin  and secure against  catching Cold  in the  Head  which is frequently a heavy  Grievance  to  tender    studious  and  sedentary  Persons Therefore I should advise  such  to  shave  both  Head  and  Face every  Day or every  other  Day or as  often  as they possibly can and  wash  them well in  cold Water  afterwards What  shaving  does to the  upper Parts  the same do  washing  and  scraping  the  Feet  and  paring  their  Nails  to the  lower  We know by the  Ticklishness  of the  Soles  what a multitude of fine  nervous Fibres  terminate in them  Walking    Standing  and  Treading  render them  callous  and the  Skin thick  and  hard  which much injures the  Perspiration  and hinders the  Derivation  of the  Blood  and  Spirits  into them And 'tis a common  Observation  That nothing is a surer  Sign  of  strong  and  rank  Health than a  kindly Heat  and a  profuse Perspiration  on the  Feet  It shews a full and free  Circulation  in the small  Vessels  at the greatest Distance from the Source of  Heat  and  Motion  than which nothing can more plainly  indicate great and good Health  On the contrary  weak  and  tender  Persons are always  cold  in the  Legs  and  Feet  and first of all feel  Cold  there in  frosty  Weather Let the  Tender  therefore and the  Weakly  duly  once  a Week wash in warm  Water    rub    scrape  and  pare  their  Feet  and  Nails  Which will likewise prevent  Corns    Hardnesses  and the unnatural  Tendency  of their  Nails  into the Flesh These are 'tis true but low and seemingly  trifling Observations  towards  Health  but 'tis in this Case as 'tis in a more  momentous  one  He that despiseth little Things shall perish by little and little  §  Those  tender  and  valetadinary  People whose  Studies  or  Profession  oblige them to  read  or  write  much ought as far as they possibly can to  stand  in an erect  Posture    bending  their  Head  and  Breast  as little as may be  leaning  only on a  sloping Desk  and continuing their  Exercises  in that  Posture  'till they grow  weary  then rest and be at it again  Custom  and  Practice  obstinately persisted in will at length render the  Posture  easy to them And 'tis inconceivable how many and great Advantages it will bring to the  Constitution Sitting    Bending  and  Leaning  low  compress  some if not many of the  Vessels  of the Body and so stop and retard the  Circulation  of the Blood and Juices thro' them which makes a more ready  Flux  through the other more  patent  and  pervious  ones Whence that  Sleepiness  and  Disability  to Motion in the  Limbs  till the  Blood  and  Spirits  by a proper Posture get a free  Admittance  into them From this also there ensues an  unequable  and  subsultory Circulation  of the  Juices  and an unequable  Secretion  in the  Glands  and consequently an unequal  Growth    Strength  and  Vigour    of the  Organs  and  Parts  Which is the Cause of  Rickets  in  Children  careless Nurses neglecting to  rock    dandle  and  toss  them sufficiently that the  Circulation  of the  Juices  and  Spirits  may be equally promoted every where And to avoid this  Inconveniency  seems to be the  Reason  why the  Romans  and the  Eastern  Nations lay along at their great  Meals  and  Feasts  and when they were obliged to continue long in one  Posture  Besides that in  Writing  or  Reading  if one sits there is a constant  Pressure  on the  Cavity  of the  Breast  and  Stomach  which must necessarily  weaken  their  Functions  and these are commonly the  Organs  which first decay in  Clerks  and  Under Secretaries  And  hanging down  the  Head  is the ready Way to raise  Fumes  and  Vapours  to it Whereby such will be exposed to  Lowness  of  Spirits  and perhaps  Consumptions    all which  are in a great measure avoided by an erect  Posture  For thereby all the  Organs  will be in their  natural Situation  Many of the  Muscles  will be in Action and so press on the  Blood Vessels  to facilitate the  Circulation  But  chiesly  by this erect  Posture  the  Juices  will have the Advantage of their own  Gavity  to  descend  with the greater  Velocity  to  warm  and  cherish  the  lower Parts  which are remotest from the  Source  of  Motion  and the grosser  Evacuations  will be more readily  promoted  and thereby preserve the  upper Regions clear  and  serene  Which will bring great Advantages towards  Health  and  Long Life  But this  Practice  will never become easy unless to those who begin  young  Those who  dictate  or  consult  ought to do them  standing  or  walking  which would relieve both  Body  and  Mind  §  The  Unwieldy    Fat  and  Overgrown  besides the  Rules  already laid down I advise in particular as much as is possible for them to  abstain  from  Drink  of all kinds No one  Rule  or  Condition  ever was contrived or can be of  so great Use  to  preserve  and  lengthen  the  Lives  of such as an  obstinate  and  universal Astinence  from all kinds of  Liquors  If the  Doctrine  be  true  as 'tis highly  probable  that the  Mass  of all the  Bodies  of  Vegetables  and  Animals  is only  Pipes  and  vascular Tubes  formed all at once in their first  Rudiments  and  Seeds  then  Growth  and  Increase  of  Bulk  is only  filling  and  plumping  up  diluting  and  unfolding  these  Pipes  with  Liquors  We know from  Kircher  's and Dr  Woodward  's Experiments to what  Bulk Vegetables  will thrive by mere  Element  alone Two  Pigs  of the same  Litter  were fed upon an equal  Quantity  of  Milk  only to one of them the  Milk  was mixt with the same  Quantity  of  Water  After a  Month  's feeding they were both  killed  and that which had the  Water  was found much  larger  and  fatter  than the other  Dropsies  at least  Anasarca  's have been cured by an obstinate Forbearance of  Drink  And  Lethargies  proceed from the  Moisture  of the  Brain  And these are the two  Distempers    Unwieldy    Fat  and  Overgrown  Persons are most subject to Therefore such ought to avoid  Drink  as those do who have the  i e Dread  of Water a Disease so called proceeding from the Bite of a  mad Dog  Hydrophobia  or are bit by a  mad Dog  Which they may easily bring about if they feed only on young  animal  and  moist  and  cool vegetable  Food But whenever I speak of  vegetable Food  I mean that which is dressed by  Fire  §  To the  Aged  and those who are passing off the  Stage  of  Life  I have only  two  Things to recommend if they would make the  last Hour  as  easy    indolent  and  free  from  Pain  as may be The  first  is That they would avoid the  Injuries  of the  Weather  as much as ever they can The  Blood  of the  Aged  is ever most certainly  poor  and  viscid  Their  Perspiration  little or none at all and their  concoctive  Powers  weak  And consequently they must be  subjected  to and suffer by the weakest  Injuries  of the  Weather  Therefore I advise  such  to keep  Home  provide  warm Rooms  and  Beds  and good  Fires  whenever the  Sky lowrs    Winds blow  or the  Air  is  sharp  Such are not to expect to  raise    improve  or  exalt  their  Constitutions  or  Health Freedom  from  Pain  to prevent the  vital Flame  's being extinguished by  Accidents  and to have it  burn  as clear and as long as Nature at their  Age  has designed it should is all they ought to  aim  at  Exercise  is only to purge off  Superfluities  If  these  therefore be careful not to  exceed  they will want none nor would it much contribute to their  Ease  For in old Men the  Bones petrify    the  Cartilages  and  Tendons  turn into  Bones  and the  Muscles  and  Nerves  into  Cartilages  and  Tendons  And all the  Solids  lose their  Elasticity  and turn in a great measure into that  Earth  they are going to be  dissolved  into So that the  Solids  wanting  Elasticity    Exercise  can do but little to  shake  off the  Load  It will therefore be  enough  for  such  to air themselves when the  Sun  lights them and the  Summer  Breezes can  refresh  them Or if they would lengthen out their  Days  to remove to a warmer  Climate  by which they may live as long as the  Crow  The  second  Thing I would advise  such  is To lessen their  Diet gradually  as they grow  older  before  Nature  has forced this  Diminution  upon them This is a powerful Mean to make their old Age  green  and  indolent  and to preserve the  Remains  of their  Senses  to the very last By this alone  Cornaro  lengthned out his  Days  and preserved his  Senses  in a great measure intire to a  hundred Years  He gradually lessened his  Diet  so far that as his  Historian  informs us he came at last to live on the  Yolk of an Egg  three Days I will not take upon me to advise others  in what  Measure  either of Time or Quantity of  Food  they ought to  diminish  But this I think they ought to consider That since 'tis certain aged  Persons  become  Children  as to the  Weakness  of their  Digestions  they ought to  diminish  as  Children  increase in their Food from  weaker  to  weaker  and from  less  to  less  For as their  Solids  are  unelastick  their  concoctive Powers  weak their  Perspiration  little and the  Expences  of Living scarce any their  Repairs  not to  overlay  the  Spark  of  Life  remaining ought to lessen  proportionally  And 'tis to the Neglect of this in  aged Persons  that those  Rheums    Catarrhs    Wind  and  Colicks  Loss of  Memory  and  Senses  those  Aches  and  Pains  and all that  dismal and black Train of Miseries  that wait on  Long Life  is mostly owing Which by a discreet and timeous lessening their  Diet  might in a great measure be prevented  §  There is no  Mistake  more fatal in the Cure of chronical Distempers incident to the Weak and Tender than the  vain and unjust  Expectation they entertain of a  sudden  and  quick  Cure or even of a sensible Relief This with  their Inconstancy and Impatience of being confined in their Appetites makes them either throw off all Remedies and Restraints in Despair and give themselves up to an  habitual  Indulgence in all those Things that brought on or exasperated the Distemper or run about changing from Doctor to Doctor till they end with a  Quack  or die under the Hands of a  Mountebank  and are  fool'd  out of their Lives and Money at once It is surprizing that reasonable Men can imagine that in any  small  Time any possible Methods or Medicines should cure or even sensibly relieve a Distemper that perhaps was  brought with  them into the World and  interwoven  with the Principles of their Being or at least may have been  Ten  or  Twenty Years  a breeding by  Excesses  or an  indiscreet Regimen  I know no fitter Similitude of the Case than the annual  Income  of an Estate just sufficient to keep one in decent Necessaries and due Plenty and Cleanness If one that has such an Estate run out every Year for Ten or Twenty Years and then set about to retrieve before he be come to  Starving  or a  Gaol  would we not count him mad if he should imagine  by Retrenching Management or Saving even joining to those  Daylabour  that a  few  Months or Years would recover all and bring his Estate to its first Condition No he must  labour    abstain  and  manage  for several Years and the Time required will be always in a Proportion compounded of the  Rate  of his former  Expences  and his present  Saving  That is If his Expences were but  small  and his Savings  great  the Time will be the shorter in respect of the Time he continued his overspending If he gives over  Saving  he must at last most certainly starve or go to Gaol and if he begins to save in due Time he will certainly  retrieve  all but the whole consists in  Labour  and  Saving  for a  due Time Excesses  and an  undue Regimen  is running out of one's Health which without a proper Remedy as  Labour  and  Abstinence  will necessarily bring a Man to  Diseases  or  Death  And these must be continued a  Time proportioned  to the Greatness of the  Excesses  with regard to the  Labour  and  Abstinence  Most  chronical  Distempers have for their Parents corrupted Fluids and broken Solids as has been shewn A bad State of the  Stomach  and  alimentary Organs  either beget these or accompany them Suppose for Example the Case be a  scorbutick  Habit shewing it self with  Blotches  and a  watry Ichor  or  Bumps  with  yellow  or  black  Spots on the Skin a thick viscid  rheumatick  Blood an obstructed  Liver  and a constant overflowing of the  Gall  Oppression of  Spirits  want of  Appetite  and  Digestion  and thereby a  Wasting    Lassitude    Inquietude  c which I have often met with in your  Bon Vivants  and your FreeLivers who have been born healthy vigorous and lively I know no way in Nature to relieve and effectually cure this Case but by oftenrepeated gentle  Vomits  and  Stomach Purges  as the  Choler  which certainly degenerates into  Flegm  before the Cure be brought about for  Flegm  is but  Choler  more diluted or the grosser Part of the  Serum  only as  Choler  is that of the whole  arterial Fluid  and when  Choler  is come to  Flegm  the Cure is half carried on one Part of the Fluids being already purified and the  Liver  free and open As the  Choler  I say and the  Flegm  rises and loads the alimentary Passages  Bitters    Aromaticks  and  Steel  varied and prescribed according  to the Strength of the Patient and one kind as another has lost its Virtue  Chalybeat  and  Mineral  Waters constant  Labour  and  Exercise  a  cool    light    spare Diet  and constant proper  Regimen  long and obstinately persisted in The Patient will often complain What  Vomits  and  Bitters    Galloping  and  Fasting  for ever  Vomits  only relieve for a few Days but do not  cure  We grow as bad as ever again and in some Months Perseverance find ourselves just where we began New Doctors must be had and they must either be cashier'd if they pursue the same Intentions which if they be honest Men they must do or else must write Things that can neither do Good nor Harm or those which will actually hurt for their Fees for there is no  Medium  till the miserable Person has run thro' the whole Faculty and at last got into the  Charlatan  Tribe It is certain that when Nature has begun to throw the gross and viscid Parts of the Juices on those loose and spungy Glands it will continue so to do till it has deflegmated the whole Mass and every new Vomit will make Room for another and there is no other Remedy as long as  there is any viscid Humour remaining nor can the Decline of the Disease be discovered so certainly by any Thing as by the Lessening of the Quantity excerned and the Lengthening of the Intervals As in a Vessel of Oil and Water incorporated a sure Way to separate the Oil from the Water is to skim it off as it comes to the Top Now  as long  as there is any Oil remaining it will swim if you but give it Time to extricate itself from the Embraces of the  Water  and then you may separate the viscid Mixture intirely No great Purpose in Life was ever brought about but by  Time  and  Patience  and by constantly  pursuing  the most natural and best approved Means that lead towards that End Nature works not by sudden Jumps and Starts but goes on steadily  fortement doucement  and 'tis Nature that is the true Physician Art only removes Obstacles checks Violences and gently sollicites Nature the Way she tends This requires  Time  and  Patience Tempus edax Rerum  It most certainly consumes chronical Diseases if not fuelled and fed  Nothing else  can  §  In fine Providence has been kind and gracious to us beyond all Expression in furnishing us with a certain  Relief  if not a Remedy even to our most  intense Pains  and  extreme Miseries  When our Patience can hold out no longer and our Pains are at last come to be  insupportable  we have always ready at Hand a Medicine which is not only a present Relief but I may say a standing and  constant Miracle  Those only who have wanted it most and have felt its friendly and kind Help in their Tortures can best tell its  wonderful Effects  and the great  Goodness  of Him who has bestowed it on us I mean  Opium  and its Solution  Laudanum  which when properly prescribed and prudently managed is a most  certain  and  sudden  Relief in all  exquisite  and  intense  Pain The  Manner of its Operation  may be gathered from the Observations I have made in the preceding Treatise Pain constricts crisps up shortens and contracts animal Fibres It acts like a Wedge in tearing rending and dividing these small Filaments it does to them in a living Body what the Points of Salts do to all animal Substances  which are to be preserved for Food  viz  hardens stiffens and contracts them The Fibres of live Animals being contractile tonick and springy when a hard pointed Body enters them which is the Case in all bodily Pain the Parts by their contractile Nature fly from recede and shun as much as possibly they can the wounding Instrument This appears in the large Gash of a Wound made across the Fibres of a Muscle in the continual Bending towards the other Side when any Part of one is pained in the  Cramps  and  Convulsions  nay and sometimes  Fevers  produced by intense  acute Pain  Pleasure on the contrary  relaxes  the Fibres by a gentle soft and bland or as the  Mathematicians  speak a commensurate and harmonious Touch It acts on the Fibres as two unison and concordant musical Instruments act on one another and by stroaking softening and smoothing comes at last intirely to relax and unbend them The Parts of the Fibres run after follow and pursue and at last break their Union in some Degree to reach such a demulcent Touch Some Persons have had the Faculty to  allay Pain by gently smoothing the afflicted Part with their Hands which in some Measure was true of the  Touching Doctor  Soft Oils and emollient Herbs with gentle Warmth by  relaxing  the crisped Fibres will allay  Pain  Soft Beds and Cloaths and tepid Baths will relax and weaken the whole Habit Now since Pain so certainly crisps up constricts and  contracts  animal Fibres and since  Opiates  infallibly if duly dosed relieve and  ease  Pain I can see no possible Way it can effect that but by  relaxing  and  unbending  these Fibres as much or near as much as Pain contracts and draws them up And that this is the real Fact we may observe from many Effects of  Opiates  Nothing is so powerful or so certain a  Diaphoretick  as an  Opiate  Nothing causes such plentiful Sweating especially if joined with  Volatiles  and promoted with plentiful drinking small warm Liquors This it can do only by relaxing the Fibres of the Skin and Perspiratory Glands Nothing so much  palls  the  Appetite  and  weakens  the first  Digestions  as the frequent Use of  Opiates  insomuch that most People after a liberal Dose of  them seldom fail to reach and never care for Food for a considerable Time after till their Effects are wrought off which are the constant Symptoms of a  relaxed Stomach and Guts  Nothing so much promotes the  Eruption  of the SmallPox and Measles the  Expulsion  of the Stone and Foetus the Monthly and the AfterBirth  Purifications  of the Sex as  Opiates  insomuch that in difficult Births they are now the only Resource of the Midwife Physicians and when joined with  Volatiles  will bring on the most powerful and  vigorous  Throws in the most weak and  languishing  Constitutions These Effects they can produce only by  relaxing  those Fibres Pain has  contracted  and render'd unelastick in some measure Nothing quiets and stops  Cramps    Convulsions  and  Hysterick  Fits so suddenly and certainly as  Opiates  do And every one knows these arise from violent Contractions and crisping up of the muscular Fibres All these and many more such Effects  Opiates  produce by  unbending    loosening  and  relaxing  those Fibres violent and acute Pain had constricted and  contracted  and by giving a Respite and Reprieve from its Tortures  and thereby allowing Nature the only true Physician to go undisturbed about its own Work The Way it stops Purging and cures a  Diarrhaea  I take to be by carrying off the sharp and watry Humours in the Bowels by  Perspiration  which  Opium  exceedingly promotes by quieting those  Spasms  and  Convulsions  and allaying those  Stimulations  excited by Purging and settling and calming the Violence of the  Peristaltick  Motion of the Guts which  hurries off  their Contents I will not take upon me here to determine the proper Cases for  Opiates  or their  Doses  That is the Business of the Physician But in general I may say Wherever Pain is  acute    intolerable  and  past  enduring where it may indanger  Convulsions  a  Fever  or  Inflammation  after premising the proper universal  Evacuations  such as Bleeding Blistering Cupping Purging or Glistering as the Case requires or will bear  Opiates  then will most certainly relieve and may be safely administred If the Case is attended with  Vomiting  solid  Opium  will do best because it will be in a smaller Volume and will not be so readily rejected If speedy Relief be required  where there is no Vomiting then  Laudanum  will disperse soonest through the Habit because  Liquid  and joined with a Spirituous Vehicle will  soonest  effect the Design raise the oppressed Spirits more and penetrate deeper and quicker In common Cases a vinous Vehicle will be sufficient because  Opium  is best dissolved in Wine to make  Laudanum  There are  four Cases  in which 'tis absolutely and eminently necessary the  Cholick  the  Stone  the hard  Labours  AfterBirth and Monthly sluggish  Purifications  of the Sex especially if attended with violent Pain as is common in such Cases and in the  Gout  and  Rheumatism  In the  first  it ought always to be given with some Stomach Purge as  Elixir Salutis  or  Tincture  of  Hiera Picra  with  Syrup  of  Buckthorn  and in those of more tender Bowels with  Tincture  of  Rhubarb  especially if the Cholick is in the lower Bowels and attended with no Vomiting in which Case an artificial Vomit is to be premised if Circumstances forbid it not In the  Stone  it ought to be given with  Oil  of sweet  Almonds  or in some soft  Emulsion  to lubricate the Parts In the  two last  Cases it ought always to  be given with proper  Volatiles    Antihystericks  and  Attenuants  In violent and acute Pain the first Dose ought to be large at least from  thirty  to  fortyfive  Drops of liquid  Laudanum  or its Equivalent in  Opium  from  two  Grains and a half to  three  and a half and afterwards to be increased by  fifteen  Drops of Liquid or half a Grain of solid  Laudanum  every half Hour till the Pain begin to remit and then an intire stop is to be put to its Administration And thus the End will be obtained without any Fear of  overdosing  And the Truth is there is less Hazard of that than Persons are aware For those who die of an Overdose of  Laudanum  in the  Opinion of the World  would have lived few Days without it For there are those that by Custom have brought themselves to  two Drams  of solid that is near  six Ounces  of liquid  Laudanum  a Day And I know a Gentleman who took near  three Ounces  at once instead of  Elixir Salutis  and had  never  taken any in his Life  before  who though it extreamly weakened his Stomach for some Time and that he dosed almost a Month under it yet  did well  and for ought I know is alive  still though it be many Years since If the preceding Dose be rejected by Vomiting about a Third Part may be supposed to stay and then the subsequent Doses may be proportioned accordingly The Difference of Constitutions will make no great Alteration here since very  weak  Persons seldom suffer very  violent  Pain which is the only Case I am here considering  §  To draw towards a Conclusion The  Grand Secret  and Sole Mean of Long Life is to keep the Blood and Juices in a due State of Thinness and  Fluidity  whereby they may be able to make those Rounds and Circulations through the animal Fibres wherein Life and Health consist with the fewest Rubs and least Resistance that may be In spite of all we can do Time and Age will  fix  and  stiffen  our  Solids  Our original Frame and Make renders this unavoidable and necessary As in the  greater  World the  See Sir  Isaac Newton  's Princip  Quantity of the Fluids is Daily lessening and decreasing so in our  lesser  World after  a limited Time the Appetite and Concoctions failing the  Fluids  are lessened and spent on the continual Repairs of the Solids and thereby lose their Nature and become firm and hard For by insinuating themselves into all the Pores of the  Solids  and the Interstices of their Parts and straitening and damming up the small Vessels which carry in Nourishment to the internal Substance of the Solids and so depriving them of their  Moisture  and Lubricating Juices these Solids come at last to harden stiffen and fix and thereby lose their  Elasticity  and Springiness Here the Process is  Mechanical  and  Necessary  Age and Time by weakning the Concoctions impairing the natural Heat which consists in a brisk and extended Circulation of the Juices by the turning those  Juices  into  solid  Substances and thereby fixing and hardning these Solids and depriving them of their due Elasticity the  Fluids  circulate with less  Velocity  and Force and seldom reach the  Extremities  and  smallest Vessels  but pass through the more  patent  and larger  Vessels  by their  biggest  lateral Branches And if with all these unavoidable and irremediable  Circumstances both the nutritious and serous Part of the  Blood  and the globular become  viscid    thick  and  glewy  the Circulation must stop at last and come to an End Now 'tis certainly in a great measure in our Power to maintain the  Juices  in a due State of  Fluidity  and  Thinness  and to render them such if they are not corrupted to an extreme Degree so that the remaining Part of Life be not too short for such a tedious Work We certainly may  dilute  and  thin  any  Fluid  that has an Inlet and Outlet And the more  fluid  a circulating Liquor is that is the  smaller  and  finer  its Parts are the  less Force  it will require to set it a going and to continue its Motion And in animal Bodies the thinner and more  fluid  the Juices are they will not only circulate by the  less Force  and with  less Resistance  i e  Pain  but also they will preserve by their Circulation the  Solids  the longer from  stiffening  and  hardening  There is not a more mischievous nor greater Mistake than the common one that  thin  Blood is  poor  Blood which the Vulgar and Herd of Mankind are as terribly affrighted for as outward Poverty and Want  For on the contrary the  thinnest  and most  fluid  Blood is the  richest  that is the  best  Blood if  rich  and  good  mean the same Thing For in  Hydropical    Anasarcous    Cachectick  and  Scorbutick  Persons both the serous and globular Part of the Blood is  thick    glewy  and  acrimonious  so that it can neither get thro' the  small Vessels  nor can it be long contained in them but corrodes and frets them and so falls at least the thinnest Part of it into the Cavities and begets a  Dropsy  or stops in and obstructs these small Vessels and so becomes an  Anasarca  or  Scurvy  In all which Cases the serous Part is overloaded with urinous Salts and becomes a perfect  Lixivium  so that by its  Grossness  it cannot run into Globules to facilitate the Circulation through the  Capillaries  for these small elastick Globules by turning Oval or Oblong wonderfully facilitate the Circulation of the Juices through the  small  Passages and the red or globular Part becomes a mere Cake of  Glue  and thus the Quantity of  Serum  is increased and the Quantity of the globular Part gradually lessened And in  this  Sense of a greater proportion of  Serum  this State of the Blood may be  called  thin  but it can in no Sense be called  good  Blood The thinnest and most fluid Blood is ever to be look'd upon as the  best  Blood as consisting of  finest  and  smallest  Parts which most readily runs into red Globules and most easily circulates thro' the  capillary  Vessels which is the most solid Foundation of good Health and Long Life Now as nothing but indulging in strong high Foods which the concoctive Powers cannot break and divide into Parts  small  enough to run into red Globules or circulate through the  small  Vessels but overstock them with urinous Salts which run into  Clusters  and first  obstruct  and afterwards  break  these small Vessels and in wallowing in strong Liquors which parboil and  eat out  the tender and delicate Fibres of the Solids I say as nothing but such an Indulgence and such Excesses long continued and obstinately persisted in can beget such a State of the Fluids and Solids and so bring on a  Cachexy  which may end in a  Dropsy  or some other fatal chronical Distemper according to the Habits and particular Make and Constitution of the Party for no Person that lived low and meagre and drank  only small and thin Liquors ever became Hydropical if his Solids were originally firm and his Fluids not tainted with some  hereditary  Sharpness so I know nothing under the Sun that can solidly and fully effectuate the contrary State of the  Blood  and  Juices  to render them  thin  sweet and in a constant  flowing  Condition but taking the contrary Measures and keeping to a strict Regimen of a  thin    fluid  spare and lean Diet We have no possible Way to attenuate clean and dilute a  Vessel  full of  gross    glewy  and foul Mixtures that has only a small Inlet and Outlet but by pouring into it a thin clear insipid  Fluid  and by shaking it often and much It is much the same with an animal Body No  voluptuous  nor  lazy  Person unless he has had an original Constitution of  Brass  was ever a  long Liver  And even then as his Life has been more Misery and  Pain  than ever a  sober Gally Slave  endured his End and the latter Part of his Days has been Rack and  Torture    Horror  and  Despair  And though he has not had the Hope nor  Consolation  of a Martyr yet his  Sufferings  have been far more  exquisite  and  extreme  All those who have lived  long  and without much Pain have lived  abstemiously    poor  and  meagre Cornaro  prolonged his Life and preserved his Senses by almost  starving  in his latter Days and some others have done the like They have indeed thereby in some measure weakned their natural  Strength  and qualified the Fire and Flux of their  Spirits  But they have preserved their  Senses  weakened their  Pains    prolonged  their Days and procured themselves a gentle and quiet  Passage  into another State Gentle domestick  Purges  frequently repeated due  Exercise  and the Use of the other  Means  prescribed in the foregoing Treatise will mightily  contribute  toward this End But the  Ground work  must be laid carried on and finished in  Abstemiousness  and though not in absolute  Fasting  for that is no ways required and would be prejudicial yet in a  thin    poor    low    light  and  meagre  Diet All the rest will be insufficient without  this  And  this  alone without  these  will suffice to carry on Life as long as by its natural Frame it was made to last and will make the Passage  easy  and  calm  as a Taper goes out for want of Fuel

much ought to do them  standing  or in as  erect  a Posture as they can And those who can go about any Part of their  Studies walking  should do it  The  Fat    unweildy  and  overgrown  ought to  avoid  all manner of  Drink  strong and small and even  Water  itself as much as possible And if their Food be  Vegetables  and  young Animals  they will have  little Occasion  for any Liquor  The  Aged  should carefully guard against all the  Injuries  of the  Weather  and  lessen  the Quantity and lower the Quality of  their Food gradually  as they grow  older  even  before  a manifest  Decay  of Appetite  force  them to it  As  chronical  Diseases are not brought on all at  once  so they cannot be  quickly  removed A  gradual  Corruption must be  gradually  remedied 'Tis contrary to the Nature of chronical Diseases to be  quickly  cured  In all acute and  vehement Pain    Opium  is the sovereign  Relief  particularly in the  Colick    Stone    Gout    Rheumatism  and hard  Labour  of Women It operates by  relaxing  and unbending the Fibres  overstretched  and crisped up by  Pain  The  great Secret  of  Health  and  Long Life  lies in keeping the Blood and consequently the other Juices of the Body in a due Degree of  Fluidity  CONCLUSION  TO  Conclude  without taking the Benefit of  Revelation  which in a Sense relating even to our  mortal  Bodies has  brought Life and Immortality to Light  if but the Precepts of the  Pagan  Philosophers were observed  Servare Modum Finemque tueri  Naturamque sequi  If Men would but observe the  golden Mean  in all their  Passions    Appetites  and  Desires  if in all their  Thoughts    Words  and  Actions  they would but mind I will not say the  End  of their  Being  and  Existence  here but the  End  to which their  Thoughts    Words  and  Actions  naturally tended in their last  Resort  And  Lastly  If in the  Gratifications  of their  Appetites    Passions  and  Desires  they follow'd the uncorrupted  Dictates  of  Nature  and neither spurred her on beyond her  Craving  nor too violently restrained her in her  innocent Biass  they would enjoy a greater Measure of  Health  than they do have their  Sensations  more  delicate  and their  Pleasures  more  exquisite  live with less  Pain  and die with less  Horror  For had it not been for the  Lewdness    Luxury  and intemperate  Gratifications  of the  Passions  and  Appetites  which first ruined and spoiled the  Constitution  of the  Fathers  whereby they could  communicate  only a  diseased    crasy  and  untuneable Carcass  to their  Sons  so that with the  World's Decay    vicious Souls  and  putrified Bodies  have in this our  Age  arrived to their highest and most exalted  Degrees  I say Had it not been for these  Evils  there never had  happened so much  Sickness    Pain  and  Misery  so  unhappy Lives  and such  wretched Ends  as we now behold among  Men  But even in this our  lapsed Estate  and Condition had the  Dictates  of  Nature  and  Reason  not to say  Religion  been followed we might have passed our Days in  Indolence  at least from  chronical  Distempers if not innocent  Pleasures  arrived at a  good old Age  with our Senses free and our rational  Faculties  clear and at last departed in  Peace  as a  Lamp  goes out for Want of  Oil  And let the Gentlemen of  Wit  and  Fire  of  Banter  and  Sneer  hug themselves ever so much in their boasted  Tranquillity  and  Security  gratify their  Passions    Appetites  and  Humours  to the  Full  and despise  Futurity  and  Whining  I dare promise when the  Farce  is ended and the  last Minutes  are drawing on they would prefer a  Life  thus  led  and an  End  so  calm  to all the  Pleasures  of  Lewdness  and  Sensuality  and the  Bounces  of a false and ignorant  Security
