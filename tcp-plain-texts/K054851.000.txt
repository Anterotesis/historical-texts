Salisbury  and by the Booksellers of OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE Price One Shilling  PREFACE  THE pious Designs and the magnificent Works of our Ancestors are Themes on which every Reader of a liberal Curiosity receives Information with Pleasure But the following Work is more immediately calculated for the peculiar Convenience of the Traveller and is principally designed as a  local Guide  to Strangers who may be tempted to visit the curious and entertaining Particulars which it professes to describe and illustrate  For the Satisfaction of the Reader it may be necessary still further to premise that our Account is compiled from the best private Information from an attentive Examination on the Spot and from a Variety of Materials relating to the Subject incidentally dispersed in different Books which have been carefully collected and succinctly digested To reader our Detail still more complete and authentic we have consulted two Folio Volumes written on Vellum belonging to the Cathedral Church of  Winchester  containing the Acts of the Pontificate of  William of Wykeham  whose Benefactions make so conspicuous a Figure in the History of  Winchester  It is called  Registrum Wykeham  and begins with the Year  mccclxvii  But our principal  Assistance has been derived from a valuable Manuscript of  Anthony Wood  never before printed and preserved in the  Ashmolean  Museum at  Oxford  D pag to It is dated Febru  and consists of the following Articles The Church of the Hospital of St  Cross  with it Epitaphs  Winchester  College with the monumental Inscriptions painted Windows Memorials of Arms and other Particulars in the Chapel Cloysters and Library The Obits of several of the Fellows of the said College as  in the Register of the College from AD to AD None of which appear to have been buried in the Chapel or Cloysters Catalogue of the Masters of St  Cross  Hospital AD to AD Extracts from a Register of Benefactions to  Winchester  College Begining with  "A Missal given to  Winchester  College by Mag  Thomas Nevil  Prior of the Cathedral Church of  Winchester  "  And ending with  "  John White  Bishop of  Winton  gave to the College at  Winton  by Will his Mitre and Cro  Staff a Tankard silvergilt a Bason and Yeure of Silver and a Turkie Carpet"  Besides these we have been favoured with the Perusal of several original Evidences and authentic Papers  THE CITY  WINCHESTER appears to have been a City of considerable Note among the antient  Britons  by whom it was called  Caer Guen  or the  White City  from its Situation upon a chalky Soil Many reputable Historians report that it was founded by  Ludor Rous Hudibras  Years before the Birth of Christ It afterwards became a Roman Station and probably one of their Cities as appears from the Discovery of a Pavement of Brick and Coins of  Constantine  the Great found in digging the Foundat  on of the Royal Palace of  Charles  II  Camden  But p  Ed Cib  tells us that during the  Saxon Heptarchy the  West Saxon  Kings resided in this City who adorned it with magnificent Churches and an Episcopal See King  Ethelstan  established here six Mints for the Coinage of Money The  Domeboc  of  Alfred  was reposited in the Cathedral of this City thence called  Codex Wintoniensis  as was afterwards the present  Domesday  book of the  Conqueror  Kennet's Paroch Ant pag  From its first Foundation to the last mentioned Period it was three Times destroyed by Fire In the Civil Wars between King  Stephen  and  Maud  the Empress this Place was almost totally desolated but the Misfortune was amply repaired by  Edward  III who fixed here a Staple  Leland acquaints us that the Staple Houses  "lay from the West Gate in a back Way to the North Gate"  Itiner vol iii pag ed  for Wool and Woollen Manufactures  Camden ubi supra    It is said to have been first fortified with Walls by  Guidorius  Anno Dom The present Walls are reported to have been erected by  Moleutius Dunwallo  Anno Dom On the South and East Sides for some Distance they remain entire and many Fragments of them are continued to a considerable Extent on the North and West particularly to the Westward on which is to be seen a Bastion called the  Hermit's Tower  Their Circumference is one Mile and  an Half There were formerly six City Gates the four principal of which still subsist as does one of the Posterns called the  King's Gate  Leland says that St Michael's Gate is spoken of by antient Writers and conjectures that  King's Gate  was sometimes so called on account of St Michael's Church standing near it Itinerar vol iii pag  the sixth Gate  Leland ut supra pag says it was called  B  rnegate  and that it led to a small Suburb  which stood between the North and East Gate is utterly destroyed On the West and on Part of the North and South Sides is a Foss of prodigious Breadth and Depth but to the Meadows which were easily floated by the River such a Defence was thought unnecessary The vacant Spaces within the Walls now formed into Gardens demonstrate that the Town has been greatly depopulated  Near the West Gate we survey the Ruins of a strong and stately Castle which according to Tradition was built by King  Arthur  Anno Dom and was a Place of remarkable Defence in the Reign of King  Stephen  against whose Attacks it was bravely maintained by  Maud  the Empress for a considerable Time By a Plan of it drawn Anno Dom it appears to have been a quadrangular Structure with a Tower at each Angle And by a small Sketch in  Speed  Anno Dom we discover that the Entrance from the West was over a Bridge thrown  across the Western Foss leading to a Gateway contiguous to the South West Angle of the Building It appears by the same Sketch to have had some Outworks with Towers to the South  Heylin  inform us that  "it was a gallant but not great Castle bravely mounted on a Hill for Defence and Prospect  Cosmograph pag edit  "  The West  Saxon  Kings and many of our Princes after the Conquest resided in this Castle some of whom were born and others crowned  William Rufus was crowned here every Christmas Angl sacr vol i pag Our Kings often kept their Christmas and Easter here  here In later  It appears to have been in the Crown in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth who allows  l    s    d  to the Constable of Winchester Castle Peck's Desid Curios vol i l p  Times it was inhabited as a Dwelling House by Sir  William Waller  and his Family near one hundred Years before the Grand Rebellion in which it was demolished about Anno Dom During the Troubles the King had seized and garrisoned this Fortress from whose Forces it was afterwards taken by Sir  William Waller  its original Owner who was one of  Cromwell  's Generals The Chapel of the Castle which was as at present originally a detached Building is still entire and is a magnificent Edifice consisting of three Iles Feet in Length and in Breadth In this Chapel a famous Cause concerning the Superiority of  the See of  Canterbury  over that of  York  was tried Anno Dom before  Hubert  the Pope's Legate King  William  and all the Bishops and Abbots in  England  Wharton's Angl Sacr vol ii pag  A Chantry formerly belonged to this Chape as appears by its Dissolution at the Reformation  Willis's Mitr Abb vol ii p a Pension of  l  is allowed to Nicholas Hill late Incumbent Anno Dom    The Assizes for the County of  Hants  were originally kept in this Castle at least as early as the Year as we learn from the  Winchester  Annalist who frequently remarks that the Royal Family quitted their Residence at this Place to make Room for the Judges but at present the Chapel of which I have been just speaking is appropriated to this Purpose At the End hangs what is commonly called King  Arthur's Round Table  which is Feet in Diameter It would be needless to multiply Authorities for a Proof that this Table is of modern Date However it is of higher Antiquity than it is commonly supposed to be For  Paulus Jovius  Descript Region  who wrote above two hundred Years ago relates that it was shewn to the Emperor  Charles  V and that at that Time many Marks of its Antiquity had been destroyed the Names of the Knights having been then just written afresh and the whole Table with its Ornaments newly repaired Turnaments being  often held at  Winchester  before the Court and Parliament this Table might probably have been used on those Occasions for entertaining the Combatants which on that Account was properly inscribed with the Names of  Arthur  's twentyfour Knights either in Commemoration of that Prince who was the reputed Founder and Patron of Tilts and Turnaments or because he was supposed to have established these martial Sports at  Winchester  In later Times these Exercises were called  Mensa Rotunda  Thom Walsing edit i pag See also Selden De Duello pag Works Fol vol iii  The Names of the Knights inscribed on the Table are much the same as those we find in an old Romance concerning King  Arthur  Called  Morte Arthur  c printed by Caxton  viz Sir  Lancelot du Lake  Sir  Tristram  Sir  Pelleas  Sir  Gawain  Sir  Garethe  c  On or near the Site of this Castle  Charles  II Anno Dom laid the Foundation of a magnificent Royal Palace only the Shell of which was finished A Cupola was designed Feet higher than the Roof which would have been seen at Sea and a Street was intended leading from the West End of the Cathedral to the Centre of the Front The Length of the whole is Feet A Park was also projected ten Miles in Circumserence but the Death of the  King prevented the Progress and Execution of this noble Plan The Palace is at present converted into a commodious Prison for  French  Prisoners of War  The City of  Winchester  contains eight Parish Churches It had formerly or more many of which were suppressed by Bishop  Fox  in the Reign of  Henry  VII as insufficient to maintain their respective Incumbents  Leland ut supra pag    In a Meadow called  Denemrch  ead  between Hyde Abbey and the City Wall  Guy  Earl of  Warwick  is said to have encountered and conquered  Colbrand  the  Danish  Giant The BattleAx with which he atchieved this memorable Exploit was kept in the Treasury of St  Swythun  's Cathedral till the Reformation and was called  Colbrandis Axe  See Rudbourne apud Wharton vol i pag  Eastward of the Town on a Hill called St  Giles  's Hill where stood a Chapel dedicated to St  Giles Waldawus  a  Saxon  Earl of  Northumberland  was beheaded by Command of the Conqueror  Leland ut supra pag but Camden says Waltheof Earl of Huntingdon pag edit Gib vol i    On the opposite Hill called  Catharine  Hill  Leland  acquaints us there was a fair Chapel dedicated to that Saint It was endowed with Lands and suppressed by Cardinal  Wolsey  Ut supra pag    The Prospect from either of these Hills is very delightful The City interspersed with Trees and Gardens magnificent Structures and venerable Ruins and the Country consisting of watered winding Vallies bordered by Declivities of a prodigious Height gradually rising into extensive Downs bounded by distant Woods must charm every Lover of romantic or rural beauty  St John's House  is appointed for the public Meetings of the Mayor and Aldermen It has an Hospital annexed and is said to have been founded by  William Lamb  Esq  In  Leland  's Time it was an Hospital for the Sick and in the Chapel was a Statute of St  Bristan  Bishop of  Winchester  who probably was the Founder  Ut supra pag  He died AD On the West Side of the CloseWall is a commodious Hospital founded by  William Symonds  Gent AD for six old Men one Woman and four Boys On the North Side of the Cathedral is a decent College founded by Bishop  Morley  AD for ten Widows of Clergymen  The County Hospital in this City is a magnificent Edifice the Front of which is Feet in Length It was opened for Patients at  Michaelmas  AD This Institution was the first of the Kind in  England  and was begun but not in the present Building AD  The Market Cross about the Middle of the Highstreet is an elegant Gothic Structure Feet high and as I conjecture of the Age of  Henry  VI  Besides the College and Cathedral which will be separately described there have been several religious Foundations in this City The most eminent was  HydeAbby  for Benedictines which stood for Years within the Precincts of St  Swythun  's and on a Quarrel between the two Societies was removed to a Suburb called  Hyde  It was established at  Hyde  by  Henry  I and  W Giffard  Bishop of  Winchester  AD and at the Dissolution AD was valued at l s  Tanner Not Mon pag Fol  It's Abbots had a Seat in Parliament The Church almost fills a large Meadow with it's Ruins and appears to have consisted of three Iles and to have been at least Feet long It was built with Flint cased with Stone Of the Monastery nothing remains except some Outbuildings toward the Street and one Gateway the Mouldings of which exhibit on each Side the Head of a King The same Head occurs on a Wall towards the South Great Part of the PrecinctWall is still standing In this Abby many  Saxon  Kings and Princes were sumptuously buried The Church now called  Hyde Church  "In Atrio Hydae"  MSS Coll Wint  originally stood within the Precincts  as did many Parish Churches in other Places  As at Winchecombe Co Glocester Cirencester ibid Evesham Co Worcester c  The Tower of Hyde Church was probably built with the Stone collected from the Ruins of the Abby  Next to this in Point of Eminence was a Benedictine Nunnery called St  Mary  's Abby founded by  Alswithe  the Wife of King  Alfred  AD It was situated near the House of  George Pescod  Esq  and is now reduced to a small Heap of Stones It consisted of an Abbess and Nuns and was valued at the Dissolution at  l    s    d  Tanner ibid  From this Nunnery  Henry  I took his Wife  Maud  Daughter of  Malcolm  King of  Scots  by which Marriage the Royal Families of the  Saxons  and  Normans  were united  Camden  acquaints us that the Ruins of this Monastery shewed it to have been a stately Fabric  Brit vol i Gib edit pag  Besides these there were the following Monasteries  See Tanner Not Mon in  Hampshire  or religious Foundations  The Hospital of the Almonry of the Church of St  Swythun  commonly called the Sustern Spytal maintained by St  Swythun  's Convent adjoined to the present College on the West  The College of St  Elisabeth  founded by  John de Pontisora  Bishop of  Winchester  AD for one Provost six Chaplain Priests six Clerks and six Choristers was valued at the Dissolution at  l    s    d  The Provost had six Marks and the Chaplains  s  per Annum besides Commons It stood in a Meadow called St  Stephen  's near the present College on the East  Leland  thus describes it's Site  "The College of St  Elisabeth  of  Hungorie  lyith straite Est upon the  NewCollege  WinchesterCollege and there is but a litle narrow Causey betwixt them The mayne Arme and  The same Writer observes that  "Blak Brydge  made of Wood  is betwixt Elisabeth and Est Bridge"  Ibid pag East Bridge is I suppose the Bridge just without the East Gate  Stream of  AlsfordWater  devided a little above the College Elizabeth College into two Armes runnith on each Side  Leland ut supra pag  "  Afterwards he adds  "within these twoArms not far from the College Church of St  Elisabeth  is a Chapel of St  Stephen  "  The Bishop in his Statutes sets forth that he founds this College before the Gates of  Wolvesey  Castle in a certain Meadow called St  Stephen  's Meadow containing six Acres in which also stands an antient Chapel of St  Stephen  Dugdal Mon vol iii Eccles Coll pag    On the North Side of the Churchyard of St  Mary  's Abby described above stood the Chapel of the  Holy Trinity  consisting of a Warden and several Priests  Here was a Convent of each of the four Orders of Mendicant Friers The Augustine Friers were just without the South Gate on the left in the Road to  Southampton  The Grey Friers or Minors on the right just with the East Gate The Dominicans on the North within the City  To these we may add the Prior and Brethren of St  Peter  in the Church of St  Maurice  and the Church of St  Mary Kalender  We shall close our Account of the City with a Description of the Hospital of St  Cross  which stands about half a Mile Southward of the Town  This  From Lowth's Life of Wykeham edit pag Tanner's Account varies in one or two Circumstances Ut supra pag  Hospital was founded by  Henry de Blois  Bishop of  Winchester  and Brother of King  Stephen  about the Year for the Maintenance of thirteen poor Men who likewise ordained that one hundred other poor Persons should be entertained here every Day at Dinner in a Place appointed for that Purpose called  HundredMennesHall  Of these there were always thirteen of the poorer Scholars of the great Grammar School of  Winchester  But this Institution of daily feeding the one hundred Poor was not of  long Continuance for it was abrogated before the Reign of  Richard  II and instead of it an Establishment was substituted of four Priests thirteen secular Clerks and four Choristers In the Year Cardinal  Beaufort  Bishop of  Winchester  made ample Additions to the Hospital for the Maintenance of two Priests thirtyfive Brethren and three Sisters besides those of the original Foundation He gave his new Constitution the Name of  The Alms House of Noble Poverty  by which it appears that he designed the House for the Relief of decayed Gentlemen This Hospital though considerably diminished in it's Revenues still subsists on the Remains of both Endowments  The Building consists of one extensive irregular Court The Church which was built in the Reign of King  Stephen  by the first Founder is a curious Remain of  Saxon  Architecture  "We have some Examples of the ancient SAXON Manner which was with Peers or  round  Pillars much stronger than Tuscan roundheaded Arches and Windows Such was WinchesterCathedral of old and such at this Day the Royal Chapel in the White Tower at London  The Chapel of St Crosses  the Chapel the Cathedral of ChristChurch in Oxford formerly an old Monastery and divers others I need not name before the Conquest"  Life of Sir Ch Wren PARENTALIA or Memoirs c pag from a Letter of Sir C Wren c  It is in the Form of a Cross and the Body consists of three Iles with a Transept From the Altar  to the West Door it is Feet in Length and the Transept The Roof is remarkably lofty On each Side of the Altar are handsome Screens of Spire Work in Stone The Names of all the Officers belonging to the Hospital about AD are carved on a Desk in the Chancel among which we find those of a Chanter and singing Men but at present there is no Provision for a Choir  The great West Window the Construction of which is in a more ornamental Style than any of the rest was probably altered to it's present Form by the second Founder Cardinal  Beaufort  It has some Remains of painted Glass with an Inscription nothing of which is legible or at least intelligible at present except the Words  Nicholas Bedford  In a South Window of the cross Ile are these Arms viz Gules three Lions Heads passant Fl de Lis reversed or three Eagles quartering Barry and a Chief In an East Window of the North Transept we find an  Ave Maria  with some Fragments of painted Glass under which is  Orate pro anima Ricardi de Buteshall  if I am right in the Name which is the most imperfect Part He was Master of the Hospital A D  On the Roof of the Nave are two Cheverons the Arms of  Wykeham  between three Roses also the Arms of  France  and  England  quartered The Coat between these two is defaced  In this Church are the following antient Epitaphs  On a Stone of grey Marble placed within an Arch in the North Ile is this Inscription in  Saxon  Characters  "Hic jacet Magister Petrus  He is mentioned in Catal Willis Magist Circ Mitr Abb vol i p  de Sanctâ Mariâ quondam Custos hujus Domus"  On a Brass Plate on the Ground  "Here lieth Elizabeth Wroughton Gentlewoman who departed the xxiii Day of May in the Year of our Lord whose Sowle Jesu pardon"  On another  "Hic

of the Nave on a large flat Stone is the Figure of a Man on a Brass Plate with two Labels over his Head  "Jesu cum veneris justificare noli me condemnarequi servasti me miserere mei"  Under the the Figure is  "Hic jacet Johes de Camden  Circ Willis ibid He was also Canon of Southwell and a Benefactor to Winchester College Regist Coll Winton  quondam Custos istius Hospitalis cujus animae c"

Chapel on the South Side of the Choir or Chancel  "Hic jacet Johannes Wayte filius Johis Wayte Armigeri et Agathae Uxoris ejus qui quidem Johes Wayte filius obiit ult Die Octob An Dom Cujus Animae c"  On the North Side of the Court is the Refectory in the Windows of which we find these Arms viz Arg A Cross pat S Quart Fr and England a bord Gobon The same are over the Gate I suppose for Cardinal Beaufort The Lodgings of the Master contiguous to the Refectory are spacious and decent On the East Side of the Court is this Inscription  "Henricus Compton Episcopus"  He was  Master here and promoted AD to the See of  Oxford  and afterwards to that of  London  We likewise find his Initials on the Stables HC with the Year In the Eastern Gallery and in other Places we frequently read  "Dilexi sapientiam RS "  This is the Memorial of  Roger  or  Robert Sherborn  Master of the Hospital and from hence preferred to the Bishoprick of St  David  's He was afterwards Bishop of  Chichester  and founded in that Cathedral Church four Prebends for which those alone are qualified who are or have been Fellows of  New College  in  Oxford  The Gateway of the Hospital is formed in a square stately Tower on one Side of which is the Statue of the Cardinal praying to another Figure now destroyed This Tower was probably built by the Cardinal  About the Year  Lowth ut supra  the Revenues of this ample Foundation were valued at  l  per Ann at which Time the yearly Salary of the Master was estimated at  l    s    d  Its second Founder Cardinal  Beaufort  added to the former Endowment an annual Augmentation of  l  besides several Impropriations  THE COLLEGE  THE College of St  Mary of Winchester  commonly called Winchester College is situated to the South East of the Cathedral just without the City Wall The Front is extended to the Length of Feet and consists of Offices on the West Side of the Gateway and of a Part of the Warden's Lodgings on the East Under the Gateway the Tower of which is adorned with a Statue of the  Virgin Mary  we enter the first Court On the left are the Warden's Lodgings which are commodious and ample That Part of them which fronts the Garden was erected at the Expence of Warden  Nicholas  the Year That Part which faces the Street was raised in the Wardenship of Dr  John Harmar  as appears by the Initials JH and the Date The North Front of the second Quadrangle loses much of its intended Effect by Means of another Part of these Lodgings built AD which runs at right Angles against it on the left  We enter the second Quadrangle under a stately Tower called the Middle Gate adorned with the Statues of the Founder the  Virgin Mary  and an Angel This Court is Feet over The lower Rooms on either Side of the Gateway and of the whole Eastern Side of this Court are the Lodging Rooms of the Scholars over which are the Apartments of the Fellows The Stair Case adjoining to the North West Angle leads to the Apartments of the Schoolmaster which are spacious and elegantly furnished On the West is the Kitchen and a convenient Conduit  The whole South Side is magnificently formed by the Chapel and Hall The latter is a noble Gothic Room Feet in Length and in Breadth in which the Scholars dine at Twelve and sup at Six In the uppermost Window on the North Side are the Arms of  England  and of the Marquis of  Winchester  The Chapel is equal to most and superior to many in our Universities whether we regard its Dimensions its Furniture and the Solemnity which strikes us at our Entrance It is Feet long and broad The Screen Stalls and Altarpiece which is of the  Ionic  Order were executed in the Wardenship of Dr  Nicholas  abovementioned The Altar is adorned with a beautiful Salutation Piece painted by  Le Moine  and given by the Reverend Dr  Burton  the present publicspirited and learned Head Master The Branches are the Gift of the Reverend Mr  Christopher Eyre  formerly Usher The East Window is painted with the Genealogy of Christ and has been celebrated in an elegant Poem written by the Reverend Dr  Lowth  Prebendary of  Durham  which is printed in an admired Collection of  English  Poems entitled The UNION  Printed for R Baldwin in Paternoster Row  The rest of the Windows are decorated with the Pourtraits of Saints with their Names underwritten Together with the following Inscription which is in many Places at present destroyed  "  Orate pro anima Wilhelmi de Wykeham Fundatoris istius Collegii  "  On the North Side stands the Organ The Roof is covered with a Cieling of Wood in Imitation of arched Stone Work without which the Height would be too great as it is at  New College  Chapel in  Oxford  where such a Cieling was probably originally intended At least the present Rafter Work of that noble Chapel is by no Means equal to the Magnificence of the rest This Cieling seems to have been finished about the Time of that which covers the Presbytery in the Cathedral as it is exactly of the same Workmanship  In this Chapel Choir Service is performed at Eight and Five on Sundays and Holidays and at Five on their preceding Eves The Choir consists of three Chaplains three Clerks one Organist and sixteen Choristers  In the Ante Chapel is a Recess to the South over Part of which stands the Tower containing five Bells This Addition which exhibits a more modern Style of Architecture seems to have been erected in the Reign of  Henry  VI together with the Tower by  William  of  Wainfleet  Bishop of  Winchester  whose Arms are cut in the Roof together with the following Arms and Rebuses  Two Cheverons between three Roses WYKEHAM  Lions passant quartering a Fret  Giron of in Fess a Rose  Three Sugar Loaves over it a Doctor's Cap  Arms of the See of Winton  Lions Ramp in chief four Keys two

Rose composed of Rays of the Sun  A large T charged with Tapers in Saltire for Thomas Chandler Warden AD  A Beacon with Arrows and a Tun for Thomas Beckington Bishop of Bath and Wells a liberal Benefactor to the College about the Time of the last mentioned Warden  Besides these there are Letters interwoven for Cyphers which by Length of Time are rendered unintelligible  One of the Windows belonging to this Recess has been lately closed up and the other is greatly defaced but the Paintings and Inscriptions of both having been fortunately preserved by  Anthony Wood  the  Oxford  Antiquary who visited this College in  February  I shall insert them from his original MSS which has never yet been printed The curious Observer will easily supply the Defects of the remaining Window by the Assistance of the following Description Arms  Girony of Or and Bl a Rose in Fess Point G  A Mitre in chief between three Bucks Heads cabossed in chief and three Pheons in Base  Arg two Chev S

Habit supported by another Bishop and an Archbishop as appears by the Cross placing the Mitre on his Head Under him are  two Chaplains praying This was most probably to represent the Consecration of  William  of  Wykeham  Underneath the whole Length of the Window is this Inscription  Hulyn AMSchola Grammaticali hujus Collegii et pro animabus parentum et amicorum eorundem  In another Compartment is this Inscription  Orate pro anima Magistri Willi Densford quondam Socii perpetui hujus Collegii qui obiit Octavo Die Decemb Ann Dni Cujus animae c  In another Compartment is the Figure of a Saint Beneath it is a Man praying with the following Scroll from his Mouth  Felix precatrix mihi sis precor auxiliatrix  In another Compartment St Anne is represented teaching her Daughter the blessed Virgin Under these is a Woman praying with the following Label  O mihi per natum vitam precor Anna beatum  In another Compartment is a Painting of God the Father with our Saviour in his Arms  Beneath are two Men praying at a Table at their Mouths are two Scrolls in the one  Per mortem nati qui mundum vivificasti  In the other  Simus salvatipetimus quos ipse creasti  At the Bottom is the Name  "  Agnetis Uxoris ejus  "  probably for  Agnes Champnewys  the Founder's Sister and Mother of  Alicia Perrot  See the Founder's Pedigree in Lowth's Wykeham Append No  Round the Ante Chapel are placed the Stalls originally belonging to the Choir or Inner Chapel The Brass Plates on the Floor were removed hither from the Choir when it was paved with black and white Marble in the memorable Wardenship of Dr  Nicholas  before mentioned  Many of the Epitaphs on the Brass Plates are obliterated and many others have been destroyed or removed The following Account is taken from  Wood  's Manuscript which

The original School specified as such by the Founder in his Statutes was the Room which is now called the  Seventh Chamber  He calls it magna illa Domus situated under the Hall  From the School Area we pass into the College Meadow in the Middle of which stands an Infirmary built for the Use of the Scholars by Warden  Harris  in the Reign of  Charles  I Part of this Meadow originally belonged to St  Elizabeth  's College  At the Dissolution of this House Thomas Lord Wriothesley sold it to Winchester College for l on Condition that the Warden and Fellows wouid either convert it into a Grammar School for twenty Scholars or pull it down before Whitsuntide The College chose the latter Regist Coll Winton  which stood in an adjacent Meadow to the East in Remembrance of which are the following Inscriptions on the Eastern Wall  Solum Ecclesiae  In Occiden  Tali Parte  Hujus Muri  Ab Hoc An  gulo  On the Western Wall are these Inscriptions  In Occidentali  Parte hujus  Muri Solum Col  legi

which includes the Additions from the Meadow in which stood the College of St  Elizabeth  From this Meadow we have a Prospect of  Catharine  Hill abovementioned on the Top of which is a  Danish  Circumvallation To this Hill the Scholars are permitted to make Excursions on Holidays  Ah happy Hills ah pleasing Shade  Ah Fields belov'd in vain  Where once my careless Childhood stray'd  A Stranger yet to Pain  I feel the Gales that from ye blow  A momentary Bliss bestow  As waving fresh their gladsome wing  And redolent of Joy and Youth  My weary Soul they seem to sooth  And breathe a second Spring  GREY  Contiguous to the College on the West is a spacious quadrangular Building in which the young Gentlemen not on the Foundation who are called Commoners live in a Collegiate Manner under the Care of the second Master or Usher a Situation which must be acknowledged to be far more convenient sor the Purposes of Learning and good Discipline than the usual Custom of our great Schools where the Youth are boarded in the Town and are at a Distance from the constant and immediate Inspection of their proper Governors On one Side of the Area of this Structure is a commodious Cloyster There is also a noble Hall Feet in Length and in Breadth in which the Commoners dine and when absent from the School pursue their private Studies  This College was founded by that magnificent Prelate  William  of  Wykeham  Bishop of  Winchester  for one Warden ten Fellows one Schoolmaster one Usher three Chaplains seventy Scholars three Clerks and sixteen Choristers  The first Stone was laid  March  the at Nine o'Clock in the Morning near a School in which  Wykeham  when a Boy was educated The Building being compleated on the th of  March  AD the Warden and Scholars made their solemn Entrance at Nine in the Morning chaunting in Procession It should be observed that the Founder by his first Charter established only a Warden and seventy Scholars which was the whole Society who took formal Possession of the College as abovementioned and who before the Building was finished were provided with Lodgings in the Parish of St  John  upon the Hill The Founder obtained a second Charter for the Establishment of the ten Fellows and Officers of the Choir  See the Charters in Dugd Mon vol iii Eccl Coll pag    THE CATHEDRAL  SOME Writers report that a Monastery was founded in this City by King  Lucius  AD which was destroyed in the Persecution of  Dioclesian  AD  Tho Rudborne Hist Maj Wint Ang Sacr tom i pag  This it is said was afterwards restored and underwent various Revolutions till  Kyngelise  the first Christian King of the  West Saxons  began a Cathedral Church AD which was probably finished by his Successor  Kenwalch  and replenished with Religious by  Birinus  the Bishop and Apostle of the  West Saxons  AD Soon afterwards viz AD the See of  Dorchester  now in  Oxfordshire  was removed hither and  Wina  was appointed the first Bishop But before this new Constitution commenced  Birinus  and  Agilbertus  were the two first Bishops of  Winchester  The Chapter of this Foundation who were Seculars continued about Years and were at length removed by the Persuasion of Bishop  Ethelwold  Hist Maj ut supr pag  in the Reign of King  Edgar  about AD who substituted a Convent of Benedictines which remained till the Reformation  About the Year Bishop  Walkelyne  See Annal Ec Wint ut supr pag  began the present Edifice and finished the Tower the Choir the Transept and probably the West End  Rudborne ibid  Accordingly the Monks in the Presence of almost all the Bishops and Abbots of  England  passed with much State and Triumph from the old Monastery to the new one AD on the Feast of their Patron St  Swythin  and in a most solemn Procession translated the Shrine of that Saint to the new Church The next Day  Walkelyne  commanded the old Monastery to be demolished which was effected the same Year one Porch and the high Altar excepted  Ut infra  The whole being nobly improved by  William  of  Wykeham  was at lenth finished as it now appears by  Fox  of whose respective Benefactions and Alterations I shall find a proper Occasion hereafter to speak more particularly  Notwithstanding the positive Assertions above concerning  Walkelyne  's entire Demolition of the old Church I am persuaded that the lowbuilt Iles at the East End of the Choir existed before the Time of  Walkelyne  and are a Part of the old Church erected by the  Saxon  Kings This appears from several demonstrative Proofs For they are in a more simple and confined Style of Architecture than any Part of  Walkelyne  's new Work and admitting that  Walkelyne  demolished great Part of the old Church it seems probable that he should leave that Part of it standing in which many of the  Saxon  Kings and Bishops his Predecessors are confessedly buried Another Evidence of this Hypothesis are the  Crypts  on which these low Iles stand to this day and which as appears from a Latin Epistle in Verse of  Wolstan  Apud Leland Collecta  vol i pag  Precentor of the Church to  Aelphege  Bishop of  Winchester  AD were constructed by  Ethelwold  in the Reign of King  Edgar  He is speaking of  Ethelwold  's rebuilding the Church  Insuper  occultas  studuistis addere  cryptas  These Crypts now remaining if they do not prove the Antiquity of the Building they support  yet at least they point out the original Situation of the Church and invalidate those Testimonies which assert that  Walkelyne  entirely demolished the old Church and chose a new Groundplot for his new Structure  There is another Circumstance mentioned by  Rudbourne  Pag apud Whart Angl Sacr vol i  which still further corroborates my Supposition He observes that  William Rufus  was buried in the Choir under a Tower which fell down a few Years afterwards and that in the Place of it  Walkelyn  erected the present Tower He adds that  Walkelyn  did not build this Tower in his Lifetime but committed the Care of it to his Executors who finished it after his Death  The Writer of the Epistle abovementioned who lived AD tells us that  Ethelwold  introduced a WaterCourse into the Priory now corruptly called the  LogPond  Hucque  Dulcia piscosae flumina traxit aquae  Secessusque  Sic  Laci  penetrant secreta  domorum  Mundantes  F Mu  centes  totum murmure coenobium  This WaterCourse is formed in a large Piece of subterraneous arched Stonework The antient  Course of it is thus described in a Passage faithfully translated from  Wykeham  's Register  Part fol seq    "And

reasonably suppose were demolished in the Reign of  Henry  VIII or soon afterwards as useless to the new Foundation and others have given Way to modern Improvements The principal Part now standing is the Dean's formerly the Prior's Hall It was very losty with a Roof of RafterWork still to be traced and was Feet long and broad But as the whole is subdivided into several Apartments its Height Length

Apartments with arched StoneRoofs seems to be made up of the Kitchen Buttery Cellars and other Offices The Cloisters formed an Area on the Southern Churchyard and were built  This with the Addition of other Circumstances appears from a Precept in the Register of Wykeham's Episcopate to prohibit the Inhabitants of Winton or others from claiming a public Way or Passage through the Cloisters or Court

Part of the Dean's Garden It was extended under the End of the Southern Transept to the Length of ninety Feet against which the Heads of Arches with some of their Pillars still appear and prove from

the Church beyond which the Cloister cea  ing the Remainder of this Side of the Church is finished with a Window lower than the rest and of enlarged Dimensions Under it is a lofty Gateway which was an

the Church are Part of a College the Foundation and Dissolution of which are equally obscure where  Constans  the Monk Son of  Constantine  who usurped the Empire against  Honorius  AD was educated But it seems more probable that these are the Remains of the most antient Part of the Convent in Question erected by some of the  Saxon  Kings that Part perhaps which as  Rudborne  already quoted relates was demolished by  Walkelyne  The Height of the Ground hereabouts demonstrates the Demolition of some  considerable Pile It appears also that there was a Garden with several Houses within the Cemetery under the West End of the Church an Encroachment which arose after the Reformation and which by Archbishop  Laud  's Injunctions was ordered to be removed AD  Wilkins's Concil vol iv pag

erroneous pag    The Prospect from the West End of the middle Ile to the East Window beyond the Choir must strike every Mind which is susceptible of those aweful Feelings that arise from the Contemplation of that Greatness and Extent which are peculiar to the Proportions of  Gothic  Architecture A judicious and entertaining Passage from  Lowth  's Life of  Wykeham  will here be properly introduced  "This Ile was originally of the  Saxon  Architecture not greatly differing from the  Roman  with round Pillars much stronger than  Doric  or  Tuscan  or square Piers adorned with small Pillars roundheaded Arches and Windows and plain  Walls on the Outside without Buttresses as appears by the Crossile and Tower which remain of it to this Day The Nave of the Church had been for some Time in a bad Condition Bishop  Edyngdon  undertook to repair it in the latter Part of his Time and by his Will ordered his Executors to finish what he had begun And whether in Pursuance of his Design and by his Benefaction or otherwise it appears that in the Year some Work of this Kind was carrying on at a great Expence However  Wykeham  upon due Consideration and Survey found it either so decayed and infirm or else so mean in its Appearance and so much below the Dignity of one of the first Episcopal Sees in the Kingdom that he determined to take down the whole from the Tower westward and to rebuild it both in a stronger and more magnificent Manner This great Work he undertook in the Year and entered upon it the Beginning of the next Year upon the following Conditions stipulated between him and the Prior and Convent who acquit the Bishop of all Obligation to it and acknowledge it as proceeding from his mere Liberality and Zeal for the Honour of God They agree to find the whole Scaffolding necessary for the Work they give the Bishop free Leave to dig and to carry away Chalk and Sand from any of their Lands as he shall think  most convenient and useful for the same Purpose and they allow the whole Materials of the old Building to be applied to the Use of the new He employed  William Winford  as Architect  Simon Membury  was appointed Surveyor of the Work on the Bishop's Part and  John Wayte  one of the Monks Controller on the Part of the Convent As the Church of  Winchester  is situated in low Ground which without great Precaution and Expence affords no very sure Foundation for so weighty a Structure  Wykeham  thought it safest to confine himself to the Plan of the former Building and to make Use of a Foundation already tried and subject to no Hazard He even chose to apply to his Purpose some Part of the lower Order of Pillars of the old Church though his Design was in a different Style of Architecture that which we commonly call  Gothic  with pointed Arches and Windows without Keystones and Pillars consisting of an Assemblage of many small ones closely connected together but which is more properly  Saracen  for such was its Origin The Crusades gave us an Idea of this Form of Architecture which afterwards prevailed throughout  Europe  The Pillars or Piers of the old Building which he made Use of were about sixteen Feet in Height of the same Form with those in the East Side of the Northern Crossile These he carried up higher  according to the new Design altering their Form but retaining their Strength and adopting them as a firm Basis for his own Work The new Pillars are nearly equal in Bulk to the old ones and the Intercolumniation remains much the same These Circumstances in which Stability and Security were very wisely in the first Place consulted have been attended however with some Inconvenience as it seems owing to them that this Building has not that Lightness and Freedom and that Elegance of Proportion which might have been expected from  Wykeham  's known Taste in Architecture and from the Style and Manner of his other Works in this Kind of which we have evident Examples in the Chapels of both his Colleges especially in the Western Part of that of  New College  in  Oxford  which is remarkably beautiful To the further Disadvantage of its present Appearance an Alteration which could not then be foreseen has since happened At that Time the Buildings of the Monastery covered the whole South Side of the Church so that it seemed needless to be at a great Expence upon Ornaments in that Part which was like to be for ever concealed By the Demolition of the Monastery this Side is now laid open and discovers a Defect of Buttresses and Pinnacles with which the North Side which was then the only one in View is properly  urnished Another  Alteration of the same Kind has been made in Inside and with the like Effect Immediately before the Entrance of the Choir stood the Vestry which extending from Side to Side of the Nave prevented the intire Conformation of those Pillars against which it rested to the new Design but at the same Time concealed the Irregularity In the Time of  Charles  the First this was pulled down and the present beautiful Skreen the Work of  Inigo Jones  was erected but no Care was taken by an easy and obvious Alteration to correct a Deformity which was then uncovered and still continues to disgrace the Building in a Part which of all others is the most frequently exposed to Observation However with its Defects which appear thus to be owing partly to an accidental and unforeseen Change of Circumstances partly to the Care of avoiding greater Inconveniencies there is no Fabric of its Kind in  England  after those of  York  and  Lincoln  which excells this Part of the Cathedral Church of  Winchester  in Greatness Stateliness and Majesty This great Pile took up about ten Years in erecting and was but just finished when the Bishop died He had provided in his Will for the intire Completion of his Design by his Executors in Case of his Death and allotted Marks for what then remained to be done besides Marks for the  Glass Windows This was about a Year and Half before it was finished by which some Sort of Estimate may be made of the whole Expence  Lowth's Life of Wykeham pag  "  From this Ile by a stately Flight of eight Steps we approach the Choir The Screen abovementioned is of the Composite Order and adorned on the Right Hand with a Statue of  James  I and on the Left of  Charles  I They are both of Brass and were given together with the Screen itself by the latter of these Monarchs During the Civil Wars the Pressbyterians among other Outrages barbarously defaced and abused both these Statues but particularly that of  Charles  at tempting to break off the Crown and declaring with much malicious Triumph  that they would bring him back to the Parliament  Dugdale ubi infr    The Stalls are of  Norway  Oak and are a masterly Piece of  Gothic  Spire Work being at once elegant and majestic They were erected by Prior  Silkestede  as appears by his Name out on the Pulpit  The StonePulpit in the Body of the Church was probably used for preaching before the Reformation as it was for many Years after  "Wykeham buildid the great Body of the Church of St Swithun's where now the Sermons are made and where  odie is enter  ed a very princelie Work"  Stowe's Annals by Howes pag ed This is now entirely disused  with which they are terminated on the North Side He died AD On  the same Side stands the Organ which was removed thither by the Command of  Charles  I from the old Screen where it was justly supposed to intercept the View from the West to the East End The Stalls on the South Side are bounded by the Bishop's Throne erected by Bishop  Trelawney  translated from  Exeter  AD The Pediment which is embellished with a Mitre and the Arms of the See impaling those of his Family is supported by fluted Columns of the  Corinthian  Order The Vaulting of the Roof of the Choir was executed in the Reign of  Charles  I there being before this an Opening from the Choir into the first Story or Room of the Tower on which Account the Side Arches of this first Story being intended to be seen from below are wrought and ornamented We find the same Opening in the Tower of St  Cross  built about the same Time It was undoubtedly looked upon as a Beauty in the Architecture and had in some Measure the same Effect as the  Louvre  or open Lantern formerly used in great Halls Height of Roof in the Inside was also a favourite Circumstance in Structure of this Sort which was produced from this Expedient in a very striking Degree The Arms and Initials of the King with those of his Queen  Mary  and of  John Young  Dean at that Time are introduced among the Ornaments of the Vaulting which is of Wood The two Branches are the  Gift of the late Dean Dr  Cheney  who has left by Will  l  for paving the Choir with Marble  In the Pannels below the Stalls under the Organ and on the opposite Side are some Memorials of the new Foundation of  Henry  VIII viz the Date in which the new Establishment commenced The King's Arms with HR  Henricus Rex  The Arms of the Church given by the said King  Vid Sigill Eccles A Church in the Gate of which is the Image of the Trinity  The Portcullis and the Arms of  William

Alteration of the House  In the Area leading to the high Altar is a plain raised Monument of a greyish Stone without any Inscription under which  William Rufus  who was killed in the neighbouring new Forest AD is buried This Tomb was opened by the Rebels in the Civil Wars who stole from thence the Remains of a Cloth of Gold a Ring set with Rubies said to be worth  l  and a small Silver Chalice  With this Area the Presbytery begins which is ornamented with a Roof highly finished in a different Taste from that of the Tower and is  separated on each Side from the North and South Iles by a wellexecuted Partition Wall of open Work On the Top of either Wall are placed three Shrines or Chests beautifully carved painted and gilded with a Crown on each in which are enclosed the Bones of several of the West  Saxon  Kings Bishops and some later Princes who had been originally buried behind the Altar or in different Parts of the Church These Remains were thus no less piously than carefully collected and deposited by Bishop  Fox  AD Their Names c are inscribed on every Chest which the Reader will find among the  Tombs  and  Monumental Inscriptions  The Ascent to and Area of the high Altar is paved with Marble by the Benefaction of Dr  William Harris  Prebendary and Schoolmaster of  Winchester  College who dying AD bequeathed  l  for ornamenting the Altar The Wood Work about the Altar was erected by Bishop  Fox  But the Canopy with its Festoons and other Ornaments were added about the Time when the new Screen of  Inigo Jones  at the ChoirEntrance was built as I conjecture from C R in the Cornice  The two Doors or Entrances on each Side still remain through which the Priest approached the Altar from the  Sanctum Sanctorum  The  Tops of three Niches are likewise remaining over the Altar which probably contained three Images representing the Trinity A good Piece of Painting would be a noble and proper Improvement of this superb Altarpiece Behind is a a very lofty Screen or Partition of Stone charged with most exquisite Embellishments of  Gothic  Workmanship and infinitely superior in Point of finishing to another of the same Sort in St  Alban  's Abbey Church The Niches before the Reformation were filled with Statues but are at present supplied with Urns which by some are thought inconsistent Decorations These were the Gift of Dr  William Harris  abovementioned  From his Epitaph    The Screen Side PartitionWalls Roof of the Presbytery and of the adjoining Side Iles with their Walls and Windows were finished at the Expence or by the Interest of Bishop  Fox  AD as appears by his Name and Arms carved in many Places The same liberal Benefactor new glazed with painted Glass as he had new made the Windows of this Part of the Church that is the Choir Windows and those of the parallel Iles He likewise fronted the Boundary of the Choir on the Outside with two beautiful Pinnacles and other ornamental Architecture among which his Statue is placed cloathed in the Episcopal Habit He probably  intended to complete the Remainder of the East End in the same Style  He seems to have reduced the Windows in the West Side of the Northern Transept to their present Form    It is said and from good Authority that the Bishop was assisted in this Work by Prior  Silkestede  Willis's Mitr Ab vol i pag  This Prior at least cooperated with  Fox  in improving the Church by building the Stalls and a Chapel about the Time when  Fox  began these Alterations  See Wood's Hist Univ Oxon L ii p  His Initials TS are in the Roof of  Fox  's Presbytery It should seem that Cardinal  Henry Beaufort  left some Money for this Purpose as HB appears on the Outside of the South Partition Wall and over its Entrance He died not many Years before  Fox  was advanced to the Bishoprick  In the Grand Rebellion the AltarScreen just mentioned was artfully protected from the Violence of the Presbyterians by Means of an extemporaneous Wall or Partition erected in a parallel Line just before it so as entirely to conceal its Beauties from the Observation of the sacrilegious Intruders Other Parts of the Church did not however escape the mistaken Zeal of these Enemies to all that was graceful or majestic On the th of  December  the Soldiers of Sir  William Waller  entered the Church  where they broke in Pieces the carved Work of the Choir containing the Story of the Old and New Testament in admirable Imagery destroyed the Organ  One of their Friends has recorded a most extraordinary Anecdote that in the Houses of the Prebendaries  "they found great Store of Popish Books Pictures and Crucifixes"  which after a mock Procession were burnt with the Organpipes in the Streets John Vicars's  God in the Mount  or England's Parliamentarie Chronicle c to London p  seized the rich Tapestry Cushions and Vestments of the Choir with the Vessels of the Altar threw down the Communion Table and carrying off the Rails which enclosed it burnt them in their Quarters After this they defaced many of the Monuments and pulling down some of the Chests which contained the Remains of the  Saxon  Kings they threw their Bones against the painted Glass which they thus destroyed throughout the Church  Heylin Hst of Presbyt pag edit Dugdale's Short View c pag  But the beautiful Window over the Altar exhibiting the Pourtraits of several Saints and Bishops of this Church being more out of their Reach and less exposed than the rest is still preserved entire together with a few Figures on the Windows contiguous The grand West Window seems to be made up of the dispersed Fragments which imperfect as it is has a fine Effect and leaves the pensive Imagination to supply that religious  Light which was diffused over all the Church when every Window retained its original Splendor  The East End of the Church is terminated by three Chapels That on the South is adorned with a Monument of  Thomas Langton  Bishop of  Winchester  who died AD The RoodLoft consists of elegant  Gothic  Carving in Wood and both the Sides are finished in the same Taste But the Work has been much damaged Under the Window are several Niches for Statues The Bishop is said to have built this Chapel  Leland Collectan vol i pag  The Roof is painted with a Hen on a Tun being a Rebus on  Henton  the Place of his Nativity and partly on his Name The Inscription  "  Laus tibi Christe  "  The Chapel in the Centre dedicated to the Virgin  Mary  was erected by Prior  Silkestede  before mentioned and is used at present for early Prayers His Name is on the Roof and on the Sides which are adorned with ancient Painting are embossed the Arms of  England  of  Silkestede  of the See a Rebus on  T Langton  viz TL with a Tun as in his Chapel just described and who was Bishop in the former Part of  Silkestede  's Priorate for whom also a Tun is introduced on the Cieling The Inscriptions  "  ad gloriam dei  "  The same Embossments appear on the Outside  of the Building in the Churchyard In this Chapel Queen  Mary  was married to King  Philip  and the Chair in which she was seated during the Ceremony still remains near the Altar It is a Mistake  Willis Mitr Abb vol i pag  that this Prior built the Chapel in the South Ile called  Silkestede  's Chapel Probably he might use it as a private Oratory or perhaps might be interred in it He seems to have born some Relation to it for opposite to it are the Remains of a Canopy under which the Presses for the Ch  Vestments are placed which formerly seems to have been the Covering of Stalls and still preserves in the Cornice the initial Letters of  Silkestede  's Name often repeated These I suppose belonged originally to the opposite Chapel It is not unlikely that  Silkestede  altered the Windows on this Side of the Transept for on the Library Window contiguous to them on the Outside is carved TS for  Thomas Silkestede  as I have before observed The elegant Screen of this little Chapel was at least erected by this Prior for on it is carved in large ornamented  Gothic  Capitals  C HD MA S S  On the North Side of the Virgin  Mary  's Chapel is a small Chapel perhaps dedicated to  S  Michael  as the Pourtraiture of that Angel appears in many Parts of the Roof  About the Middle of the great Western Ile stands an ancient Font It is a square massy Block of jetcoloured Marble in which a circular Bason is formed for the Water It is three Feet three Inches over and supported by a plain Pedestal of Stone The Sides of the Square are embellished with rude Bass Relievos which seem to represent the Miracles of some Saint belonging to this Church If we may judge from the Stile of the Architecture introduced in the Carving on the South Side this singular Monument of Antiquity was the Workmanship of the  Saxon  Times  In the Northern Transept are some imperfect Traces of antient Painting supposed to represent the Combat of  Guy  Earl of  Warwick  with the  Danish  Champion before mentioned  Mention is made of a Painting in the  Queen  's Chapel at  Winchester  "The King to the Sheriff of Hants"  "Cause to be painted in the  Queen  's  Chapel  at  Winchester  upon the GableEnd towards the West the Image of St  Christopher  who holds in his Arms our Blessed Saviour"  From a Latin Record in the  Court  of  Liveries  Henry III m citat apud Stukeley Palaeograph Brit No pag I presume this was some Chapel in the Castle of  Winchester  where the Royal Family resided    By Way of recapitulating what has been said concerning the building this Church I shall observe that it contains three Stiles of Architecture  agreeable to the Taste of the three different Ages in the Progress of which it grew to the present Perfection The first is the  Saxon  of which is the Tower the Transept and the Eastern Iles for the most Part built or begun by  Walkelyne  The second is the  Gothic  simply so called of which are the Western Iles and West Front erected by  Wykeham  The third is the ornamental or improved  Gothic  which began about the Reign of  Henry  VI and of which the Presbytery Side Iles and outward East End of the Choir by  Fox  as well as our Lady's Chapel by  Silkestede  are elegant Specimens  TOMBS AND MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS  On the South Partition Wall of the Presbytery the first Chest from the Altar has this Inscription  Edredus Rex obiit Anno  Hic pius in tumulo Rex Edredus requiescit  Qui has Britonum terras rexerat egregie  On the second is inscribed  Edmundus Rex obiit  Quem theca haec retinet Edmundum suscipe Christe  Qui vivente Patre Regia sceptra tulit  The third Chest formerly contained the Bones of  Canutus  and of  William Rufus  who was interred below This Chest had once this Inscription  Hic jacent Ossa Cnutonis et Willelmi Rufi  The present Inscription is this  In hac et altera è regione cistà Reliquiae sunt Ossium Canuti et Rufi Regum Emmae Reginae Winae et Alwini Episcoporum  On the first Chest on the Outside of the North Partition Wall  Rex Kingilsus obiit  On the Choir Side of the Chest  Adulphus Rex obiit  On the Outside  Kingulsti in cista hac simul offa jacent et Adulphi  Alter Fundator hic Benefactor erat  On the second Chest  Adulphus Rex obiit  On the Outside of the same  Egbertus obiit  Hic Rex Egbertus pausat cum Rege Kenulpho  Nobis egregie munera uterque tulit  The third Chest formerly contained the Bones of Bishop  Wina  Hic jacent ossa Winac Episcopi  With Bishop  Wina  's were enclosed the Bones of  Stigand  at first Bishop of  Winchester  afterwards translated to the See of  Canterbury  AD and on the North Side of the Coffin was this Inscription  Hic jacet Stigandus Archiepiscopus  But at present this Inscription is placed thereon  In hac cistà AD promiscuè recondita sunt Ossa Principum et Praelatorum sacrilegà barbarie dispersa AD  Under the second Chest on the South Wall we read the following Inscription  Intus est Corpus Ricardi Willielmi Conquestoris Filii et Beorniae Ducis  Under the same Wall under the second Chest is entombed the Heart of  Ethelmarus  Bishop of  Winchester  with this Inscription  Obiit Anno  Corpus Ethelmari cujus cor nunc tenet istud  Saxum Parisiis morte datur tumulo  Near the Choir Entrance in the same Wall is this Inscription  Intus est cor Nicolai olim Wintoniensis Episcopi cujus corpus est apud Waverly  On the North Side of the Wall formerly stood a fourth Chest containing the Bones of the Bishops  Elmstan  and  Kynulphus  with this Inscription  Pontifices haec capsa duos duos tenet incineratos  Primus Elmstanus huic successorque Kynulphus  The Monument of Bishop  Alfimus  was on the same Wall Eastward from Bishop  Elmston  's with this Inscription  Alfymus plumbo praesul requiescit in isto  Under  Kingulstus  's Chest in the same Wall is this Inscription  Qui jacet hic Regni Sceptrum tulit Hardicanutus  Emmae Cnutonis gnatus et ipse fuit  Obiit AD IIII  o    In the same Wall  Alwinus Obiit  Hic jacet Alwini corpus qui munera nobis  Contuli  Egregia parcito Christe pio  In the same Wall within the Choir is this Inscription for Queen  Emma  Hic Emmam cista Reginam continet ista  Duxit Etheldredus Rex hanc et postea Cnutus  Edwardum parit haec ac Hardicanutum  Quatuor hos Reges haec vidit Sceptra tenentes  Anglorum Regum fuit haec sic Mater et Uxor  Under the Monument of Bishop  Alfimus  we read this Inscription  Defuncti Corpus tumulus tenet iste Johannis  Pointes  Sometimes called  John De Pontissara  who built St  Elisabeth  's College mentioned supr pag  Wintoniae praesulis eximii  Obiit Anno  In the Wall on the same Side under the Chest of  Wina  is the Monument of Bishop  Toclive  with this Inscription  Praefulis egregii pausant his membra Ricardi  Toclive cui summi gaudia sunto poli  Obiit Anno  At the East End of the Southern Partition lies the Body of  Richard Fox  Bishop of  Winchester  the pious Founder of  Corpus Christi  College in  Oxford  under a Shrine which is a most finished Specimen of the improved ornamental  Gothic  Adjoining to the Shrine is a small private Oratory built with the rest which he usually frequented for his Devotion and which is still called Bishop  Fox  's Study He died AD  At the East End of the Northern Partition Wall is interred  Stephen Gardiner  Bishop of this See under a Shrine of plain Architecture He died AD The recumbent Figure of the Bishop was much injured in the Civil Wars  Behind the  Sanctum Sanctorum  is a traverse Wall at the Bottom of which we discern the Entrance into the Vault where the  Saxon  Kings already mentioned were first buried Over it is this Inscription  Sancta Maria et Dominus Jesus  Over the Entrance from End to End are these Names  Kyngulstus Rex Kinewaldus Rex Adulphus Rex Edwardus Rex Senior S Birinus Episcopus Egbertus Rex Aluredus Rex filius ejus Athelstanus Rex filius ejus  Edredus Rex Edgar Rex Emma Regina Alwinus Episcopus Etheldredus Rex S Edwardus Rex filius ejus Canutus Rex HardiCanutus filius ejus  Over each Name is a well ornamented Niche and Pedestal Under the whole is this Inscription  Corpora Sanctorum sunt hic in pace sepulta  Ex meritis quorum fulgent miracula multa  The Niches abovementioned seem to have made or ornamented by  Fox  The Arms above are of  Charles  I  In the Area on the East Side of this Wall is a sumptuous and stately Monument to the Memory of  Henry Beaufort  Cardinal of St  Eusebius  and Bishop of  Winchester  His Effigies is represented in the Cardinal's Habit The Inscription is now totally lost this being all according to  Godwyn  that remained legible near two hundred Years ago  Tribularer si nescirem misericordias tuas  He was a liberal Benefactor to the Hospital of St  Cross  near this City as I have before observed and died AD  Opposite to it and designed in evident Imitation of it is the magnificent Shrine and Monument of  William Wainfleet  Bishop of  Winchester  the munificent Founder of  Magdalen  College in  Oxford  He is represented on the Tomb in his Episcopal Habit grasping his Heart between his Hands The Roof and Spire Work of the Shrine is perhaps superior in Exuberance of Ornament and Height of finishing to any Structure of the same Kind It was gratefully repaired by  Magdalen  College AD Hedied AD  Westward of this are the Traces of the Effigies of a Bishop said to be St  Swythun  Near these is a Monument raised somewhat higher than the Pavement said to be that of  Lucius  the first Christian King It has no Inscription to illustrate this improbable Conjecture  At the Bottom of the Steps on the South Side of the Choir are two very ancient Monuments one of which has no Inscription the other belongs to a Prior of the Convent who died AD and is thus inscribed  Hic jacet Williemus de Basing quondam Prior istius Ecclesiae cujus animae propitietur Deus qui pro anima ejus oraverit tres annos quinquaginta dies Indulgentiae percipiet  His Predecessor may with equal Probability be the Prior here interred whose Name was likewise  William de Basynge  and who died AD  Near the Stone Pulpit in the Body of the Church we read the following Epitaph to the first Dean of this Cathedral  Wilhelmus Kingsmell prior ultimus Decanus  primus Ecclesiae  Obiit  Almost contiguous is the following Inscription  Robertus Horne Theologiae Doctoreximius quondam Christi caufa exul deinde Episcopus Winton pie obiit in Domino Jun Episcopatus sui Anno  Opposite to the former upon another Marble this Inscription appears  D Johannes Watson hujus Ecclesiae Winton Praebendarius Decanus ac Deinde Episcopus Prudentissimus Pater Vir optimus praecipue erga inopes mis  icors Obiit in Domino Januar Anno Aetatis suae Episcopatus  Nearer the Choir is the Tomb of  William  of  Edingdon  Bishop of  Winchester  with this Epitaph  Edyndon natus Wilhelmus hic est tumulatus  Praesul praegratus in Wintonia Cathedratus  Qui pertranfitis ejus memorare velitis  Providus mitis anfit cum mille peritis  Pervigil Anglorum fuit adjutor populorum  Dulcis egenorum Pater Protector eorum  MC tribus junctum post LXV fit I punctum  Octava Sanctum notat hunc Octobris inunctum    He was a noble Benefactor to the Church  Not far from the little South Door is the superb Tomb and Shrine of WILLIAM of WYKEHAM Bishop of  Winchester  the munificent  Founder of  Winchester  College and of  New College  in  Oxford  who died AD His nobler Shrine is the magnificent Ile under which he lies entombed and which was erected at his Expence The Figure of the Bishop is remarkably fresh and well preserved But the Shrine was much injured by the Presbyterians This grand Mausoleum is placed on the very Spot on which an Altar stood where  Wykeham  when a Boy constantly frequented a Mass called  Pekismass  Lowth's Wykeham pag  At the Feet of the Bishop are three small Figures of  Benedictine  Monks and at his Head two Angels This Epitaph encompasses the Tomb  Wilhelmus dictus Wickham jacet hic nece victus  Istius Ecclesiae

secundum  Jugiter oretis Tumulum quicunq{que} videtis  Pro tantis meritis quod sit sibi vita perenni    Near the Choir is the Figure of a martial Personage which is much defaced We learn his Name from the following Inscription  Hic jacet Willielmus Comes de Insula  Vana alias Wineall  Besides the  Saxon  Kings already recited  Ethelwulf Edsed  and  Edwin  were interred in this  Church together with some of its more ancient Bishops not yet mentioned viz  Denewulf E  wold Brithwald Walkelyne  It is  d that he was buried before the high Altar AD But  T    among his many curious manuscript Insertions in  Le  's FAST  Bibl Bodl Oxon  In  Museola Bibliothecarii  acquaints us that he was buried at  Ivinghoe  Co  Bucks  a Manor belonging to the Bishop of  Winchester  where he founded a Nunnery There is a Statue in that Church which the Inhabitants suppose to be his See Mon Angl T pag  Ivinghoe  was or is in the Patronage of the Bishop of  Winchester  Henry de Bloys  c  The more modern Monuments and Inscripscriptions of this Church which are very numerous are here purposely omitted  a formal and entire Recital of them would have exceeded the Limits of our Plan and extended our Work to a tedious and perhaps unnecessary Prolixity Those I have described are most likely to engage the Attention of curious Observers and their Inscriptions are such as are not immediately obvious to every Spectator  From this Survey of the Inside of the Church we would conduct the Spectator to the West End which is a striking Specimen of the massy  Gothic  Manner It is finished with two small Side Spires and a central Pinnacle with a Niche containing an Episcopal Statue of WILLIAM of WYKEHAM from whose ample Beneficence this venerable Pile derives its principal Magnificence and Beauty  FINIS
