sending them thus collected into the world I should feel perhaps more of confidence than apprehension were I not perfectly convinced that temporary favour is no decisive proof of real desert  Whatever the future fate of these performances may be I am aware that it must depend upon themselves alone and I shall not trouble my reader with  any vain attempt to enhance their merits or palliate their defects  Yet concerning one class of poems in the collection it may be proper to say a few words as some critics have expected to find in them much more than their author intendedI mean the essays on different arts In these it was by no means my design to assume the office of a legislator not only from a just diffidence in my own power of framing such laws but from a persuasion that in poetry they seldom prove either pleasing or useful  It may be said I believe of all didactic poems that the parts of them which do not pretend to teach are the most productive of pleasure and perhaps of utility  Paradoxical as this may appear I am convinced that in compositions relating to the fine arts it is strictly true A collection of precepts tho' expressed in the most elegant verse can never make either a Painter or a Poet whose productions to use the words of a great historian would excite less admiration if they could be created by the lessons of a preceptor  Rules of art are in general so trite or fallacious that they rather tend to tire and mislead than to animate and directLet us consider for instance the Art of Poetry by Boileau which is justly said to be superior to its rivalsIf we examine the mere precepts contained in this admirable Poem some of them are such as a  Poet would certainly be neglected for observing and others only such as must occur to every writer of a sound understandingThey are indeed embellished with all the graces of forcible and highlypolished expression yet surely the most engaging and useful parts of this celebrated work are its lively images and characters which by animating the composition inspire an enthusiastic esteem for the art and its professors  Concerning the real use of rules opinions have been very differentSome have even imputed the decline of art to the accumulation of precepts while others have thought so highly of their power as to imagine that no one can produce a good Poem  without being acquainted with the Poetics of Aristotle which is in truth like imagining that no one can become a parent without perusing a treatise of anatomy  Tho' I confess myself inclined to doubt the efficacy of precepts towards forming a great artist of any kind I am far from intending to condemn the poems that have appeared on a preceptive planMany of these are written in a manner so sprightly and with such an elegant felicity of expression that if they do not afford to young students that new and solid instruction which they profess to deliver they are at least highly pleasing and certainly very serviceable to that more numerous class of readers the critics and connoisseurs  It was however my wish to render my own Poems on different arts more  historical  than  preceptive  My principal design was to present a general view of the art in question with a just and animating character of its most eminent professors There is I believe a season of life in which Poems of this nature may be read with the happiest effectThe first and perhaps the most important step towards forming a great Artist in any line is to inspire a youth of quick feelings with an enthusiastic passion for some particular art and with an ingenuous delight in the glory of its Heroes  Such was the end that I proposed to myself in these essays for as delicate  or inconstant health and the love of literary retirement have prevented me from serving the community in scenes of active life I have considered it as particularly incumbent on me to endeavour at least in my poetical pursuits to promote the interest of society  I am aware that such an idea is open to much raillery as vain and romantic but Poetry is an art which conduces so little to the private emolument and advantage of those who devote even a life to it that they ought I think to be indulged in such prospects however chimerical as arise only from a benevolent vanity  In closing this Preface it may be proper to say that the collection contains  nothing which has not appeared before except an Ode to that elegant and instructive female author the Countess of Genlis with a few short and occasional compositions inserted at the end of the first volume  ERRATUM  Vol I P l from the bottom  for    read    AN ESSAY ON PAINTING IN TWO EPISTLES TO MR  ROMNEY        PHILOSTRATUS  Patet omnibus Ars nondum est occupata multum ex ill√¢ etiam futuris relictum est  SENEC Epist  EPISTLE THE FIRST  ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  IntroductionThe flourishing state of Art in this countryDisadvantages attending the modern Painter of PortraitsShort encomium on this branch of Art with the account of its origin in the story of the Maid of CorinthSuperiority of Historical PaintingSome account of the Greeks who excelled in itIts destruction and revival in ItalyShort account of the most eminent Italian and Spanish PaintersThose of Flanders and FranceThe corruption of Art among the latter  AN ESSAY ON PAINTING  EPISTLE I  BLEST be the hour when fav'ring gales restore  The travell'd Artist to his native shore  His mind enlighten'd and his fancy fraught  With finest forms by ancient genius wrought  Whose magic beauty charm'd with spell sublime  The scythe of Ruin from the hand of Time  And mov'd the mighty leveller to spare  Models of grace so exquisitely fair  While you whom Painting thus inspir'd to roam  Bring these rich stores of ripen'd judgment home  While now attending my accomplish'd friend  Science and Taste his soften'd colours blend  Let the fond Muse tho' with a transient view  The progress of her sister art pursue  Eager in tracing from remotest time  The steps of Painting through each favour'd clime  To praise her dearest sons whose daring aim  Gain'd their bright stations on the heights of fame  And mark the paths by which her partial hand  Conducts her ROMNEY to this radiant band  Painting sweet Nymph now leaves in lifeless trance  Exhausted Italy and tinfel France  And sees in Britain with exulting eyes  Her vot'ries prosper and her glories rise  Yet tho' my friend thy art is thus carest  And with the homage of the public blest  And flourishes with growing beauty fair  The child of Majesty's adoptive care  The youthful artist still is doom'd to feel  Obstruction's chilling hand that damps his zeal  Th' imperious voice of Vanity and Pride  Bids him from Fancy's region turn aside  And quit the magic of her scene to trace  The vacant lines of some unmeaning face  E'en in this work his wishes still are crost  And all the efforts of his art are lost  For when the canvas with the mirror's truth  Reflects the perfect form of age or youth  The fond affections of the partial mind  The eye of judgment with delusion blind  Each mother bids him brighter tints employ  And give new spirit to her booby boy  Nor can the painter with his utmost art  Express the image in the lover's heart  Unconscious of the change the seasons bring  Autumnal beauty asks the rose of spring  And vain selflove in every age the same  Will fondly urge some visionary claim  The luckless painter destin'd to submit  Mourns the lost likeness which he once had hit  And doom'd to groundless censure bears alone  The grievous load of errors not his own  Nor is it Pride or Folly's vain command  That only fetters his creative hand  At Fashion's nod he copies as they pass  Each quaint reflection from her crowded glass  The formal coat with intersecting line  Mars the free graces of his fair design  The towering cap he marks with like distress  And all the motley mass of female dress  The hoop extended with enormous size  The corks that like a promontory rise  The stays of deadly steel in whose embrace  The tyrant Fashion tortures injur'd Grace  But Art despairing over shapes like these  To cast an air of elegance and ease  Invokes kind Fancy's aidshe comes to spread  Her magic spellsthe Gothic forms are fled  And see to crown the painter's just desire  Her free positions and her light attire  Th' ambitious artist wishes to pursue  This brilliant plan with more extensive view  And with adopted character to give  A lasting charm to make the portrait live  All points of art by one nice effort gain  Delight the learned and content the vain  Make history to life new value lend  Ver See NOTE    And in the comprehensive picture blend  The ancient hero with the living friend  Most fair device "but ah what foes to sense  What broods of motley monsters rise from hence"  The strange pretensions of each age and sex  These plans of fancy and of taste perplex  For male and female to themselves unknown  Demand a character unlike their own  Till oft the painter to this quaint distress  Prefers the awkward shapes of common dress  Sweet girls of mild and pensive softness choose  The sportive emblems of the comic Muse  And sprightly damsels are inclin'd to borrow  The garb of penitence and tears of sorrow  While awkward pride tho' safe from war's alarms  Round his plump body buckles ancient arms  And from an honest justice of the peace  Starts up at once a demigod of Greece  Too firm of heart by ridicule to fall  The finish'd hero crowns his country hall  Ordain'd to fill if fire his glory spare  The lumbergarret of his wiser heir  Not less absurd to flatter NERO's eyes  Ver See NOTE II  Arose the portrait of colossal size  Twice fifty feet th' enormous sheet was spread  To lift o'er gazing slaves the monster's head  When impious Folly sway'd Oppression's rod  And servile Rome ador'd the mimic God  Think not my friend with supercilious air  I rank the portrait as beneath thy care  Blest be the pencil which from death can save  Ver See NOTE III  The semblance of the virtuous wise and brave  That youth and emulation still may gaze  On those inspiring forms of ancient days  And from the force of bright example bold  Rival their worth "and be what they behold"  Blest be the pencil whose consoling pow'r  Soothing soft Friendship in her pensive hour  Dispels the cloud with melancholy fraught  That absence throws upon her tender thought  Blest be the pencil whose enchantment gives  To wounded Love the food on which he lives  Rich in this gift tho' cruel ocean bear  The youth to exile from his faithful fair  He in fond dreams hangs o'er her glowing cheek  Still owns her present and still hears her speak  Oh LOVE it was thy glory to impart  Its infant being to this magic art  Inspir'd by thee the soft Corinthian maid  Ver See NOTE IV  Her graceful lover's sleeping form portray'd  Her boding heart his near departure knew  Yet long'd to keep his image in her view  Pleas'd she beheld the steady shadow fall  By the clear lamp upon the even wall  The line she trac'd with fond precision true  And drawing doated on the form she drew  Nor as she glow'd with no forbidden fire  Conceal'd the simple picture from her sire  His kindred fancy still to nature just  Copied her line and form'd the mimic bust  Thus from thy power inspiring LOVE we trace  The modell'd image and the pencil'd face  We pity Genius when by interest led  His toils but reach the semblance of a head  Yet are those censures too severe and vain  That scorn the Portrait as the Painter's bane  Tho' up the mountain winds the arduous road  That leads to pure Perfection's bright abode  In humbler walks some tempting laurels grow  Some flowers are gather'd in the vale below  Youth on the plain collects increasing force  To climb the steep in his meridian course  While Nature sees her living models share  The rising artist's unremitting care  She on his mind her every charm imprints  Her easy postures and her perfect tints  Till his quick pencil in maturer hour  Becomes her rival in creative power  Yet in these paths disdain a long delay  While eager Genius points a nobler way  For see expanding to thy raptur'd gaze  The epic field a brighter scene displays  Here stands the temple where to merit true  Fame gives her laurel to the favour'd few  Whose minds illumin'd with coelestial fire  Direct the pencil or awake the lyre  Who trace the springs of nature to their source  And by her guidance with resistless force  The tides of error and of transport roll  Thro' every channel of the human soul  How few my friend tho' millions boast the aim  Leave in this temple an unclouded name  Vain the attempt in every age and clime  Without the slow conductors toil and time  Without that secret soulimpelling power  Infus'd by genius in the natal hour  And vain with these if bright occasion's ray  Fail to illuminate the doubtful way  The elders of thy art ordain'd to stand  In the first circle of this honour'd band  Whose pencil striving for the noblest praise  The heart to soften and the mind to raise  Gave life and manners to the finish'd piece  These sons of glory were the sons of GREECE  Hail throne of genius hail what mighty hand  Form'd the bright offspring of this famous land  First in the annals of the world they shine  Such gifts O LIBERTY are only thine  Thy vital fires thro' kindling spirits run  Thou soul of life thou intellectual sun  Thy rays call forth profuse and unconfin'd  The richest produce of the human mind  First taught by thee the Grecian pencil wrought  The forceful lessons of exalted thought  And generously gave at glory's call  The patriot picture to the public hall  'Twas then PANAEUS drew with freedom's train  Ver See NOTE V  The chief of Marathon's immortal plain  In glorious triumph o'er the mighty host  That Persia pour'd in torrents on their coast  There POLYGNOTUS scorning servile hire  Ver See NOTE VI  Display'd the embattled scene from HOMER's lyre  His country view'd the gift with fond regard  And rank'd the painter with their noblest bard  Thy tragic pencil ARISTIDES caught  Ver See NOTE VII  Each varied feeling and each tender thought  While moral virtue sanctified thy art  And passion gave it empire o'er the heart  Correct Parrhasius first to rich design  Ver See NOTE VIII  Gave nice proportion and the melting line  Whose soft extremes from observation fly  And with ideal distance cheat the eye  The gay the warm licentious ZEUXIS drew  Ver See NOTE IX  Voluptuous Beauty in her richest hue  Bade in one form her scatter'd rays unite  And charm'd the view with their collected light  But Grace consign'd while her fair works he plann'd  Her softest pencil to APELLES' hand  Yet oft to gain sublimer heights he strove  Ver See NOTE X  Such strong expression mark'd his mimic JOVE  Inimitably great he seem'd to tower  And pass the limits of the pencil's power  Ye sons of art tho' on the gulph of years  No floating relic of your toil appears  Yet glory shews in every cultur'd clime  Your names still radiant thro' the clouds of time  Thy pride O ROME inclin'd thee to abhor  Each work that call'd thee from thy sphere of war  By Freedom train'd and favour'd by the Nine  The powers of eloquence and verse were thine  While chilling damps upon the pencil hung  Ver See NOTE XI  Where TULLY thunder'd and where VIRGIL sung  Yet Grecian artists had the splendid fate  To triumph o'er the Romans' scornful hate  Their matchless works profusion toil'd to buy  Their wonders glitter'd in the public eye  Till ROME's terrific pomp and letter'd pride  Were sunk in Desolation's whelming tide  Oh lovely Painting long thy cheering light  Was lost and buried in barbaric night  The furious rage of Anarchy effac'd  Each hallow'd character thy hand had trac'd  And Ign'rance mutt'ring in her monkish cell  Bound thy free soul in her lethargic spell  At length from this long trance thy spirit rose  In that sweet vale where silver Arno flows  There studious VINCI treasur'd every rule  Ver See NOTE XII  To form the basis of a rising school  Like early HESIOD 'twas his fate to shine  The herald of a master more divine  Inflam'd by Genius with sublimest rage  By toil unwearied and unchill'd by age  In the fine phrenzy of exalted thought  Gigantic ANGELO his wonders wrought  Ver See NOTE XIII  And high by native strength of spirit rais'd  The mighty HOMER of the pencil blaz'd  Taste Fancy Judgment all on RAPHAEL smil'd  Ver See NOTE XIV  Of Grandeur and of Grace the darling child  Truth passion character his constant aim  Both in the human and the heavenly frame  Th' enchanting painter rules the willing heart  And shines the finish'd VIRGIL of his art  The daring JULIO tho' by RAPHAEL train'd  Ver See NOTE XV  Reach'd not the summit where his master reign'd  Yet to no common heights of epic fame  True Genius guided his adventurous aim  Thus STATIUS fraught with emulous regard  Caught not the spirit of the Mantuan bard  Tho' rival ardour his ambition fir'd  And kindred talents his bold verse inspir'd  More richly warm the glowing TITIAN knew  Ver See NOTE XVI  To blend with Nature's truth the living hue  O had sublime design his colours crown'd  Then had the world a finish'd painter found  With powers to seize the highest branch of art  He fix'd too fondly on an humbler part  Yet this low object of his partial care  Grew from his toil so exquisitely fair  That dazzled judgment with suspended voice  Fears to condemn the error of his choice  Thus pleas'd a flowery valley to explore  Whence never Poet cull'd a wreath before  Unde prius nulli velarunt Tempora Musae LUCRETIUS Lib iv Ver  LUCRETIUS chose the epic crown to lose  For the bright chaplets of an humbler muse  Soft as CATULLUS sweet CORREGIO play'd  Ver See NOTE XVII  With all the magic charms of light and shade  Tho' Parma claim it for her rival son  Ver See NOTE XVIII  The praise of sweetest grace thy pencil won  Unhappy genius tho' of skill divine  Unjust neglect and penury were thine  Lamenting o'er thy labours unrepaid  Afflicted Art opprest with wrongs decay'd  Till with pure judgment the CARACCI came  Ver See NOTE XIX  And raising her weak powers and sinking frame  Reclaim'd the pencil of misguided youth  From Affectation's glare to tints of modest Truth  They form'd the Pencil to whose infant fame  Young ZAMPIERI ow'd his nobler name  Ver See NOTE XX  Profoundly skill'd his figures to dispose  The learned LANFRANC in their school arose  Ver See NOTE XXI  And train'd to glory by their forming care  The tender GUIDO caught his graceful air  Ver See NOTE XXII  Nor shall ye fail your wellearn'd praise to gain  Ye who adorn'd with art your native SPAIN  The unfrequented shore that gave you birth  Tempts not the faithful Muse to hide your worth  Just to all regions let her voice proclaim  TITIAN's mute scholar rival of his fame  Ver See NOTE XXIII  The power that Nature to his lips denied  Indulgent Art with fonder care supplied  The cruel bar his happy genius broke  Tho' dumb the painter all his pictures spoke  And thou VELASQUEZ share the honour due  Ver See NOTE XXIV  To forceful tints that fascinate the view  Thy bold illusive talents soar'd so high  They mock'd with mimic life the cheated eye  Thou liberal artist 'twas thy praise to guide  Thy happy scholar with parental pride  Thy care the soft the rich MURILLO form'd  Ver See NOTE XXV  And as thy precept taught thy friendship warm'd  Yet other names and not a scanty band  Have added lustre to th' IBERIAN land  But generous ITALY thy genial earth  Superior numbers bore of splendid worth  And rais'd amidst them in thy golden days  No mean historian to record their praise  Ver See NOTE XXVI  On Thee whom Art thy patroness and pride  Taught both the pencil and the pen to guide  Whose generous zeal and modest truth have known  To blazon others' skill not boast thy own  On thee VASARI let my verse bestow  That just applause so freely seen to flow  From thy ingenuous heart and liberal hand  To each great artist of thy native land  Tho' many shine in thy elaborate page  And more have risen since thy distant age  Their various talents and their different fame  The Muse unskilful must decline to name  Least in the nice attempt her judgment fail  To poise their merits in Precision's scale  E'en public Taste by no determin'd rule  Has class'd the merit of each nobler school  To ROME and FLORENCE in Expression strong  The highest honours of Design belong  On her pure Style see mild BOLOGNA claim  Ver See NOTE XXVII  Her fairest right to secondary fame  Tho' prouder VENICE would usurp that praise  Upon the splendid force of TITIAN's golden rays  Ver See NOTE XXVIII  But ill they know the value of their art  Who flattering the eye neglect the heart  Tho' matchless tints a lasting name secure  Tho' strong the magic of the clearobscure  These must submit as a dependant part  To pure Design the very soul of Art  Or Fame misguided must invert her course  And RAPHAEL's Grace must yield to REMBRANDT's Force  Ver See NOTE XXIX  Fancy's bold thought to Labour's patient touch  And Rome's exalted genius to the Dutch  Yet HOLLAND thy unwearied labours raise  Ver See NOTE XXX  A perfect title to peculiar praise  Thy hum'rous pencil shuns the epic field  The blazing falchion and the sanguine shield  But hap'ly marks the group of rural Mirth  In social circle round the chearful hearth  And rustic Joy from busy cares releas'd  To the gay gambols of the village feast  While Nature smiles her very faults to view  Trac'd with a skill so exquisitely true  These faults O REMBRANDT 'twas thy praise to hide  New pow'rs of ART thy fertile mind supplied  With dazzling force thy gorgeous colouring glows  And o'er each scene an air of grandeur throws  The meanest Figures dignity assume  From thy contrasted light and magic gloom  These strong illusions are supremely thine  And laugh at Imitation's vague design  So near to blemishes thy beauties run  Those who affect thy splendor are undone  While thy rash rivals loose and incorrect  Miscall their shadowy want of truth  Effect  And into paths of affectation start  Neglect of Nature is the bane of Art  Proud of the praise by RUBENS' pencil won  Ver See NOTE XXXI  Let FLANDERS boast her bold inventive son  Whose glowing hues magnificently shine  With warmth congenial to his rich design  And him her second pride whose milder care  From living Beauty caught its loveliest air  Who truth of character with grace combin'd  And in the speaking feature mark'd the mind  Her soft VANDYKE while graceful portraits please  Ver See NOTE XXXII  Shall reign the model of unrivall'd ease  Painting shall tell with many a grateful thought  From FLANDERS first the secret pow'r she caught  Ver See NOTE XXXIII  To grace and guard the offspring of her toil  With all the virtues of enduring oil  Tho' charm'd by ITALY's alluring views  Where sumptuous LEO courted every Muse  Ver See NOTE XXXIV  And lovely Science grew the public care  She fix'd the glories of her empire there  There in her zenith soon she ceas'd to shine  And dated passing her meridian line  From the CARACCI's death her period of decline  Yet in her gloomy and disgraceful hour  Of faded beauty and enfeebled power  With talents flowing in free Nature's course  With just exertion of unborrow'd force  Untrodden paths of art SALVATOR tried  Ver See NOTE XXXV  And daring Fancy was his favourite guide  O'er his wild rocks at her command he throws  A savage grandeur and sublime repose  Or gives th' historic scene a charm as strong  As the terrific gloom of DANTE's song  His bold ideas unrefin'd by taste  Express'd with vigour tho' conceiv  d in haste  Before slow judgment their defects can find  With awful pleasure fill the passive mind  Nor could one art with various beauty fraught  Engross the ardor of his active thought  His pencil pausing with satiric fire  He struck the chords of the congenial lyre  By generous verse attempting to reclaim  The meaner artist from each abject aim  But vain his satire his example vain  Degraded Painting sinks with many a stain  Her clouded beams from ITALY withdrawn  On colder FRANCE with transient lustre dawn  There in the arms of ROMAN science nurs'd  In every work of ancient genius vers'd  The sage POUSSIN with purest fancy fraught  Ver See NOTE XXXVI  Portray'd the classic scene as Learning taught  But Nature jealous of her sacred right  And piqu'd that his idolatry should slight  Her glowing graces and her living air  To worship marble with a fonder care  Denied his pencil in its mimic strife  The bloom of beauty and the warmth of life  Then rose LE BRUN his scholar and his friend  Ver See NOTE XXXVII  More justly skill'd the vivid tints to blend  Tho' with exalted spirit he present  The generous victor in the suppliant tent  Too oft the genius of his gaudy clime  Misled his pencil from the pure sublime  Thy dawn LE SUEUR announc'd a happier taste  Ver See NOTE XXXVIII  With fancy glowing and with judgment chaste  But Art who gloried in thy rising bloom  Shed fruitless tears upon thy early tomb  These lights withdrawn Confusion and Misrule  Seize the vain pencil of the Gallic school  Tho' FRESNOY teaches in Horatian song  Ver See NOTE XXXIX  The laws and limits that to Art belong  In vain he strives with Attic judgment chaste  To crush the monsters of corrupted taste  With ineffectual fire the poet sings  Prolific still the wounded Hydra springs  Gods roll'd on gods encumber every hall  And saints convulsive o'er the chapel sprawl  Bombast is Grandeur Affectation Grace  Beauty's soft smile is turn'd to pert grimace  Loaded with dress supremely fine advance  Old HOMER's heroes with the airs of FRANCE  Indignant Art disclaim'd the motley crew  Resign'd their empire and to BRITAIN flew  END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE SECOND  ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND EPISTLE  The rise of Painting in England and the reasons for its happening so lateThe rapidity of its improvementA slight sketch of the most eminent living Artists in EnglandThe author's wish to see his friend among the first of that numberHis reasons for hoping itThe reputation of a Painter in some degree owing to a happy choice of subjectsA few recommended from national eventsand from Milton and ShakespeareConclusionAuthor's wishes for his friend's success  AN ESSAY ON PAINTING  EPISTLE II  INGENUOUS ROMNEY whom thy merits raise  To the pure summits of unclouded praise  Whom Art has chosen with successful hand  To spread her empire o'er this honour'd land  Thy Progress Friendship with delight surveys  And this pure Homage to thy Goddess pays  Hail heavenly Visitant whose cheering powers  E'en to the happy give still happier hours  O next to Freedom and the Muse design'd  To raise ennoble and adorn mankind  At length we view thee in this favor'd Isle  That greets thy presence and deserves thy smile  This favor'd Isle in native Freedom bold  And rich in Spirit as thy Greeks of old  Tho' foreign Theorists with System blind  Ver See NOTE XL    Prescribe false limits to the British mind  And warp'd by Vanity presume to hold  Our northern Genius dark confin'd and cold  Painting sweet Nymph unconscious of their chain  In this fair Island forms her new Domain  And freely gives to BRITAIN's eager view  Those charms which once her fav'rite ATHENS knew  'Tis true when Painting on ITALIA's shore  Display'd those Graces which all Realms adore  No kindred forms of English growth appear  Age after age the hapless Pencil here  Dropt unsuccessful from the Native's hand  And fail'd to decorate this darker Land  But freely let impartial History say  Why Art on BRITAIN shone with later ray  When on this Isle the Gothic clouds withdrawn  The distant light of Painting seem'd to dawn  Fierce HARRY reign'd who soon with pleasure cloy'd  Ver See NOTE XLI  Now lov'd now scorn'd now worshipp'd now destroy'd  Thee as his Wives enchanting Art he priz'd  Now sought to crown thee now thy death devis'd  Now strove to fix with liberal support  Thy darling RAPHAEL in his sumptuous Court  Now o'er the hallow'd shrines thy hand had grac'd  "Cried havock and let slip the Dogs of Waste"  When timid Art saw ruin his delight  She fled in terror from the Tyrant's sight  The Virgin Queen whom dazzled eyes admire  The subtle Child of this imperious Sire  Untaught the moral force of Art to feel  Ver See NOTE XLII  Proscrib'd it as the slave of bigot Zeal  Or doom'd it throwing nobler works aside  To drudge in flatt'ring her fantastic Pride  And hence the Epic pencil in the shade  Of blank neglect and cold obstruction laid  E'en while the Fairysprite and Muse of fire  Hung high in Glory's hall the English lyre  JAMES both for Empire and for Arts unfit  His sense a quibble and a pun his wit  Whatever works he patroniz'd debas'd  But haply left the Pencil undisgrac'd  With fairer mind arose his nobler Son  Seduc'd by Parasites by Priests undone  Unhappy CHARLES oh had thy feeling heart  But honour'd Freedom as it valued Art  To merit just thy bounty flow'd alike  On bolder RUBENS and the soft VANDYKE  To this ennobled realm thy judgment brought  The sacred miracles that RAPHAEL wrought  But regal Pride with vain Ambition blind  Cut off the promise of thy cultur'd mind  By wounded Liberty's convulsive hand  Unbound fierce Anarchy usurps the Land  While trembling Art to foreign regions flies  To seek a refuge in serener skies  These storms subsiding see her once again  Returning in the second CHARLES's train  She comes to copy in licentious sport  The Minions of a loose luxurious Court  From whence the modest Graces turn their eyes  Where Genius sees and o'er the prospect sighs  LELY's soft tints and DRYDEN's nobler Lyre  Made the mean Slaves of dissolute Desire  Once more alarm'd by War's terrific roar  The sweet Enchantress quits the troubled shore  While sacred Freedom darting in disdain  Her vengeful Thunder on th' apostate Train  And pleas'd the gloomy Tyrant to disown  Gives to NASSAU the abdicated Throne  The peaceful Prince may rising Art defend  And Art shall crown her Patron and her Friend  In tumults from the cradle to the grave  'Tis thine O WILLIAM sinking realms to save  To thee no leisure mightier cares allow  To bind the laurel on the Artist's brow  'Tis thine to fix with tutelary hand  The Base of Freedom on which Art must stand  Yet to thy Palace KNELLER's skill supplied  Ver See NOTE XLIII  Its richest ornament in Beauty's pride  Unhappy KNELLER covetous though vain  Thee Glory yielded to seducing Gain  While partial Taste from modest RILEY turn'd  Ver See NOTE XLIV  By diffidence depriv'd of praise well earn'd  Tho' in succeeding years the Muses taught  "How ANN commanded and how MARLBRO' fought"  And THORNHILL's blaze of Allegory gilt  Ver See NOTE XLV  The piles that WREN's superior genius built  Contending Factions in her closing reign  Like winds imprison'd shook fair Freedom's Fane  Painting soft timid Nymph still chose to roam  And fear'd to fettle in this shaking Dome  At length the fury of each storm o'erblown  That threaten'd BRUNSWICK's race on BRITAIN's throne  Rebellion vanquish'd on her native shore  Her clans extinguish'd and her chiefs no more  The youthful Noble on a princely Plan  Ver See NOTE XLVI  Encourag'd infant Art and first began  Before the studious eye of Youth to place  The ancient Models of ideal Grace  When BRITAIN triumph'd thro' her wide domain  O'er FRANCE supported by imperious SPAIN  And sated with her Laurels' large increase  Began to cultivate the plants of Peace  Fixt by kind Majesty's protecting hand  Painting no more an alien in our land  First smil'd to see on this propitious ground  Her temples open'd and her altars crown'd  And Grace the first attendant of her train  She whom APELLES wooed nor wooed in vain  To REYNOLDS gives her undulating line  And Judgment doats upon his chaste design  Tho' Envy whispers in the ear of Spleen  What thoughts are borrow'd in his perfect scene  With glee she marks them on her canker'd scroll  Malicious Fiend 'twas thus that VIRGIL stole  To the bright Image gave a brighter Gloss  Or turn'd to purest Gold the foreign Dross  Excelling Artist long delight the eye  Teach but thy transient tints no more to fly  Ver See NOTE XLVII  BRITAIN shall then her own APELLES see  And all the Grecian shall revive in thee  Thy manly spirit glories to impart  The leading Principles of lib'ral Art  Ver See NOTE XLVIII  To youthful Genius points what course to run  What Lights to follow and what Rocks to shun  So ORPHEUS taught by Learning's heavenly sway  To daring Argonauts their doubtful way  And mark'd to guide them in their bold Career  Th' unerring Glories of the starry Sphere  Thy Hand enforces what thy Precept taught  And gives new lessons of exalted thought  Thy nervous Pencil on the canvass throws  The tragic story of sublimest woes  The wretched Sons whom Grief and Famine tear  The Parent petrified with blank Despair  Thy UGOLINO gives the heart to thrill  Ver See NOTE XLIX

has borrowed some of his ideas he has thrown together the subsequent Notes and disjoined them from the body of the Work as they are intended only for the perusal of those who have leisure and disposition for such kind of reading  NOTE I VERSE  MAKE history to life new value lend    One of the most elegant writers of the present age has made an ingenious effort to introduce History into the dull province of Portraitpainting  "by  representing a whole family in a single picture under some interesting historical subject suitable to their rank and character"  See Fitzosborne's Letters p But as the beauties and advantages of this plan struck forcibly on the imagination of this amiable Author the infinite difficulties attending its execution were likewise fully open to his discernment The success must depend on the choice of subject where that is not very happily adapted the picture will probably contain some most ridiculous absurditiesPerhaps the Reader may recollect an unfortunate instance or two of this kind  NOTE II VERSE  Not less absurd to flatter Nero's eyes    Pliny furnishes us with this singular anecdote as an instance of the extravagant abuse of Portraitpainting in his days which as he informs us had arrived to a degree of madness  "Nero had ordered himself to be painted under the figure of a Colossus upon cloth or canvass a hundred and twenty feet in height"  The same author informs us that this preposterous picture when it was finished met with its fate from lightning which consumed it and involved likewise the most beautiful part of the gardens where it was placed in the conflagration The reader may find some ingenious remarks upon this subject in the Notes sur l'Histoire de la  Peinture Ancienne extraite de l'Histoire Naturelle de Pline Fol London  NOTE III VERSE  Blest be the pencil which from death can save    The sweet illusion of this enchanting art is prettily expressed in a Letter of Raphael's to his friend Francesco Raifolini a Bolognese painter The two artists had agreed to exchange their own portraits and Raphael on receiving his friend's picture addresses him in the following words  "Messer Francesco mio caro ricevo in questo punto il vostro ritrattoegli √® bellissimo e tanto vivo che m' inganno talora credendomi di essere con esso voi e sentire le vostre parole"  Raccolta di Lettere sulla Pittura c Tom i pag  The charm of Portraitpainting is still more beautifully described in verse by a friend of Raphael's the amiable and accomplished Count Balthasor Castiglione  Sola tuos Vultus referens Raphaelis imago  Picta manu curas allevat usque meas  Huic ego delicias facio arrisuque jocoque  Alloquor et tanquam reddere verba queat  Assensu nutuque mihi saepe illa videtur  Dicere velle aliquid et tua verba loqui  Agnoscit balboque Patrem puer ore salutat  Hoc solor longos decipioque dies  These elegant lines are part of an epistle written in the name of his Countess Hyppolyte to her husband See Pope's edition of the Poemata Italorum Vol ii page  NOTE IV VERSE  Inspir'd by thee the soft Corinthian Maid    Pliny has transmitted to us the History of the Maid of Corinth and her father  "Dibutades a potter of Sicyon first formed likenesses in clay at Corinth but was indebted to his daughter for the invention the girl being in love with a young man who was soon going from her into some remote country traced out the lines of his face from his shadow upon the wall by candlelight Her father filling up the lines with clay formed a bust and hardened it in the fire with the rest of his earthen ware"  Plin Lib  Athenagoras the Athenian philosopher gives a similar account of this curious and entertaining anecdote adding the circumstance that the youth was sleeping when the likeness was taken from his shadow    The same writer who lived in the second century  of the Christian aera informs us that this monument of ancient art was extant at Corinth in his time though Pliny seems to intimate that it did not survive the taking of that city by Mummius  In the Poesies de Fontenelle there is an epistle from the Maid of Corinth whom the author calls Dibutadis to her imaginary lover Polemon She describes her own work in the following stanzas  Une lampe pretoit une lumiere sombre  Qui m'aidoit encore √† rever  Je voyois sur un mur se depeindre ton ombre  Et m'appliquois √† l'observer  Car tout plait Polemon pour peu qu'il represente  L'objet de notre attachement  C'est assez pour flater les langueurs d'une amante  Que l'ombre seule d'un amant  Mais je poussai plus loin cette douce chimere  Je voulus fixer en ces lieux  Attacher √† ce mur une ombre passagere  Pour la conserver √† mes yeux  Alors en la suivant du bout d'une baguette  Je trace une image de toi  Une image il est vrai peu distincte imparfaite  Mais enfin charmante pour moi  NOTE V VERSE  'Twas then Panaeus drew with freedom's train    Panaeus was the brother of Phidias the celebrated Sculptor whom he is said to have assisted in his noblest works Pausanias in his Fifth Book gives an account of several pictures by this early Artist and particularly of the picture here alluded to It was painted in the celebrated portico called  Poecile  Besides a general representation of the conflict the flight of the barbarians and a distant view of their ships Theseus Minerva and Hercules were according to this author exhibited in the piece The most conspicuous figures among the persons engaged were Callimachus and Miltiades and a hero called Echetlus he mentions also another hero who is introduced into the picture called Marathon from whom he says the field had its name  Pausanias fol Lip p  From Pliny's account of the same picture we learn that the heads of the generals were portraits  adeo jam colorum usus percrebuerat adeoque ars perfecta erat ut in eo Praelio ICONICOS duces pinxisse tradatur  Plin lib xxxv c  Miltiades had the honour of being placed foremost in this illustrious group as a reward for his having saved Athens and all Greece  Cor Nep in Vit√¢ Miltiadis  Panaeus flourished according to Pliny in the d Olympiad little more than forty years after the battle he painted  NOTE VI VERSE  There Polygnotus scorning servile hire    Of the talents of Polygnotus much honourable mention is made by many of the best authors of antiquity as Aristotle and Plutarch Dionysius Halicarnassensis c Pausanias speaks of the pictures here alluded to and in his Tenth Book introduces a very long description of other pictures by the same artist painted also from Homer in the Temple at Delphos The passage however gives but a confused and imperfect idea of the painter's performance How much the art is indebted to this ancient master what grace and softness he gave to the human countenance what embellishments he added to the female figure and dress are much more happily described by Pliny  Primus Mulieres lucid√¢ veste pinxit capita earum mitris versicoloribus operuit plurimumque picturae primus contulit siquidem instituit os adaperire dentes ostendere vultum ab antiquo rigore variare  The same author likewise bears honourable testimony to the liberal spirit of this great artist who refused any reward for his ingenious labours in the portico  Porticum gratuito cum partem ejus Mycon mercede pingeret  Plin Lib xxxv cap  He flourished about the th Olympiad  NOTE VII VERSE  Thy tragic pencil Aristides caught    The city of Thebes had the honour of giving birth to this celebrated Artist He was the first according to Pliny who expressed Character and Passion the Human Mind and its several emotions but he was not remarkable for softness of colouring  "His most celebrated picture was of an infant on the taking of a town at the mother's breast who is wounded and expiring The sensations of the mother were clearly marked and her fear least the child upon failure of the milk should suck her blood"  "Alexander the Great"  continues the same author  "took this picture with him to Pella"  It his highly probable according to the conjecture of Junius in his learned Treatise de Pictur√¢ VeterumÃÑ that the following beautiful epigram of Aemilianus was written on this exquisite picture      It is not ill translated into Latin by Grotius  Suge miser nunquam quae posthac pocula suges  Ultima ab exanimo corpore poc'la trahe  Expiravit enim jam saucia sed vel ab orco  Infantem novit pascere matris amor  But this is far inferior and so perhaps is the original itself to the very elegant English version of it which Mr Webb has given us in his ingenious and animated "Inquiry into the Beauties of Painting"  Suck little wretch while yet thy mother lives  Suck the last drop her fainting bosom gives  She dies her tenderness survives her breath  And her fond love is provident in death  Webb Dialogue vii p  NOTE VIII VERSE  Correct Parrhasius first to rich design    The name of Parrhasius is immortalized by many of the most celebrated ancient authors and his peculiar talents are thus recorded in Pliny  Primus symmetriam picturae dedit primus argutias vultus elegantiam capilli venustatem oris confessione artificum in lineis extremis palmam adeptus  He is one of the four ancient painters whose lives are written by Carlo DatiThis ingenious Italian very justly questions the truth of the singular story concerning Parrhasius preserved in Seneca where he is accused of purchasing an old Olynthian captive and exposing him to a most wretched death that he might paint from his agony the tortures of Prometheus The same author contradicts on this occasion a similar falsehood concerning the great Michael Angelo which was first circulated  from the pulpit by an ignorant priest as we learn from Gori's Historical Annotations to the Life of M Angelo by his scholar Condivi  NOTE IX VERSE  The gay the warm licentious Zeuxis drew    The Helen of Zeuxis is become almost proverbial the story of the Artist's having executed the picture from an assemblage of the most beautiful females is mentioned though with some variation as to the place by authors of great credit Pliny Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Cicero The last gives a very long and circumstantial account of it  De Inventione Lib  If the story is true it is perhaps one of the strongest examples we can find of that enthusiastic passion for the fine arts which animated the ancients Notwithstanding her praeeminence in beauty it seems somewhat singular that the painter should have chosen such a character as Helen as a proper decoration for the Temple of Juno A most celebrated Spanish Poet though not in other respects famous for his judgment has I think not injudiciously metamorphosed this Helen of Zeuxis into Juno herself  Zeusis Pintor famoso retratando  De Juno el rostro las faciones bellas  De cinco perfettissimas donzellas  Estuvo attentamente contemplando  Rimas de Lope de Vega Lisboa p  Junius supposes this picture to have been rated a little too high  NOTE X VERSE  Yet oft to gain sublimer heights he strove    Grace is the wellknown excellence of Apelles but that he sometimes very happily attempted the sublime we learn both from Plutarch and Pliny who speak of his force and energyThe Alexander of Philip says Plutarch was invincible the Alexander of Apelles inimitable  He painted says Pliny things that surpass the power of painting quae pingi non possunt Tonitrua fulgura fulgetraque  NOTE XI VERSE  While chilling damps upon the pencil hung    That the Romans attained to no degree of excellence in Painting or Sculpture seems to be confest and accounted for in the following passage of Tully's Tusculan Disputations Lib i  An censemus si Fabio nobilissimo homini laudi datum esset quod pingeret non multos etiam apud nos futuros Polycletos et Parrhasios fuisse honos alit artes omnesque incenduntur ad Studia Glori√¢ jacentque ea semper quae apud quosque improbantur  The fine arts necessarily languish without public protection or encouragement but public honours at Rome flowed in a very different channel While the Roman boasted his consummate skill in every art of empire and government he avowed in many works of genius and taste his inferiority with an air of triumph  Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera  Credo equidem vivos ducent de marmore vultus  Orabunt causas melius caelique meatus  Describent radio et surgentia Sidera dicent  Tu regere imperio populos Romane memento  Hae tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem  Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos  Aeneidos Lib VI  NOTE XII VERSE  There studious Vinci treasur'd every rule    Lionardo da Vinci was born near Florence in He was perhaps a man as universally accomplished as ever existed Not only admirable beyond his predecessors in his own profession of Painting but an excellent Architect and Musician and of great skill as an Anatomist Besides all these talents he was according to Vasari the best extempore rimer of his timeHis History and Works are well knownThe singular circumstance of his dying in the arms of Francis the First king of France is mentioned by a French poet of the present age  "Lorsque Francois premier Roi digne d' √™tre heureux  Tint Leonarda mourant dans ses bras genereux"  And the particulars of his death are thus curiously recorded by Vasari who speaks in raptures of his various and exalted talents  Finalmente venuto vecchio stette molti mesi ammalato et vedendosi vicino alla morte si volse diligentemente informare de le cose catoliche della via buona et santa religione christiana et poi con molti pianti confesso e contrito se

VERSE  Gigantic Angelo his wonders wrought    Michael Angelo Buonaroti was born near Florence and died at Rome  This illustrious man is too well known both as an Architect and a Painter to need any encomium he was also a Poet His  Rime  were printed by the Giunto at Florence in quarto in The following Sonnet which is to be found in Vasari to whom it is addressed is at once a proof of his poetical talents and his religious turn of mind it may serve also as a lesson to vanity in shewing that even a genius of the sublimest class entertained great apprehension concerning the mortality of his fame  Giunti √® gi√† 'l corso della vita mia  Con tempestoso mar per fragil barca  Al comun porto ov' √† render si varca  Conto e ragion d' ogni opra trista e pia  Onde l' affettuosa fantasia  Che

the death of Urbino his old and faithful servant shews that he united the soft virtues of a most benevolent heart to the sublime talents of an elevated mindThis letter is printed both in Vasari and in the first volume of Raccolta de Lettere sulla Pittura c p  NOTE XIV VERSE  Taste Fancy Judgment all on Raphael smil'd    Raffaello da Urbino was born in and died His amiable qualities as a Man were not inferior to his exalted talents as an Artist The reader will not be displeased to see the singular eulogium which the honest Vasari has bestowed on the engaging manners of this most celebrated

piu in altro tempo che nel  suo E questo aveniva perche restavano vinti dalla cortesia e dall' arte sua ma pi√π dal genio della sua buona natura  Vasari Vita di Raff p  To atone for the imperfect sketch which has been here attempted of these divine artists Michael Angelo and Raphael the author intended to have presented the reader with a long quotation from a most animated discourse of the President of the Royal Academy in which he has placed these great massers in a light of comparison with each other But as the discourses of Sir Joshua Reynolds are no longer scarce a new edition being now published he shall refer the reader to the Work itself He will find this most happy and ingemous parallel in the discourse delivered at the Royal Academy December  NOTE XV VERSE  The daring Julio though by Raphael train'd    Julio Romano was born at Rome and died at Mantua  His singular character is forcibly drawn by Vasari He was according to this writer the most successful imitator of Raphael the greater part of whose scholars became eminent and were almost infinite in number Raphael was particularly attentive to Julio and loved him with the affection of a parent  Vasari Vita di Giulio  NOTE XVI VERSE  More richly warm the glowing Titian knew    We find frequent censures thrown upon Titian by the critics for confining himself  "to flattering the eye by the richness and truth of his colouring without a proper attention to the higher branch of his art that of interesting our feeling by affecting subjects"  the criticism is indeed extended to the Painters of the Lombard School in general  Du Bos Tom I Sect  Why Titian chose not to follow the finished method of his excellent cotemporaries he declared to Francesco de Vargas the embassador of Charles the Vth at Venice  "I fear replied this eminent Painter to the question of Vargas I should never equal the extreme delicacy which distinguishes the pencils of Corregio Parmegiano and Raphael and even though I should be successful enough to equal them I should always rank below them because I should be only accounted their imitator In a word ambition which always attends the fine arts has induced me to choose a way entirely new in which I might make myself famed for something as the great Masters have done in the route they have followed"  Antoine Perez dans la soixanteunieme de ses Secondes Lettres  This great Artist enjoyed a long life of uninterrupted  health and died during the plague at Venice in at the uncommon age of ninetynine  NOTE XVII VERSE  Soft as Catullus sweet Corregio play'd    Antonio da CorregioVery different accounts are given by different authors of the birth and fortunes of this exquisite Painter His capital pictures were executed about the year according to Vasari who relates in a very affecting manner the circumstances of his poverty and death  Having taken a journey on foot in extremely hot weather he imprudently drank cold water which brought on a fever of which he died at about the age of forty  His colouring was most exquisitely adapted to the delicate softness of female beauty To form a perfect picture of Adam and Eve says an Italian writer on Painting Adam should be designed by Michael Angelo and coloured by Titain Eve designed by Raphael and coloured by Corregio  The ill fortune of Corregio and the gross neglect of Art in the very city which he had adorned with the most exquisite productions of his pencil are expressed with great feeling in a letter of Annibal Carracci written while he was studying the works of Corregio at Parma to his cousin Lodovico in  Vide Raccolta de Lettere c Tom I p  NOTE XVIII VERSE  Though Parma claim it for her rival son    Francesco Mazzuoli was born at Parma in and is thence usually called Parmegiano His character is thus distinctly marked by Vasari  "Fu dal cielo largamente dodato di tutte quelle parti che a un excellente pittore sono richieste poi che diede alle sue figure oltre quello che si √® detto di molti altri una certa venusta dolcezza e leggiadria nell attitudini che fu sua propria e particolare"  The same author gives us a particular description of the singular and admirable portrait which this delicate artist drew of himself refiected from a convex mirror he relates also some curious circumstances of his allegorical portrait of the emperor Charles the Vth which he painted by memory and by the recommendation of Pope Clement the VIIth presented to the emperor at BolognaThe honest biographer laments with great feeling the errors and misfortunes of this most promising painter who being seized early in life with the frenzy of turning alchemist impaired his health and fortune by this fatal pursuit his attachment to which however some authors have questioned a delirious fever put a period to his melancholy days at the age of thirtysix in his native city of Parma  NOTE XIX VERSE  Till with pure judgment the Caracci came    Lodovico  Caracci who with his cousins Annibal and Augustin established the famous Academy of Bologna was born in that city The circumstance that occasioned his death as related by a French author affords a singular proof how dangerous it is for an Artist to confide in the partial judgment of his particular friends  Son dernier ouvrage qui est une Annonciation peinte √† fresque dans une des lunettes de la Cathedrale de Bologne ne reussit pas son age une

moments  Raccolta Tom II p  NOTE XX VERSE  Young Zampieri ow'd his nobler name    Domenico Zampieri born at Bologna died at Naples not without suspicion of poison He entered early in life into the school of the Caracci and was there honoured with the affectionate appellation of Domenichino from his extreme youthHis Communion of St Jerome was compared by the judicious Poussin to the Transfiguration of Raphael yet Du Fresnoy has passed a severe censure on Domenichino and affirms that he has less nobleness in his works than any other artist who studied in the school of the Caracci So contradictory are the opinions of the two most enlightened judges in this delicate art  NOTE XXI VERSE  The learned Lanfranc in their school arose    Giovanni Lanfranco born at Parma was knighted by Pope Urban the VIIIth and died at Rome  NOTE XXII VERSE  The tender Guido caught his graceful air    Guido Reni was born in Bologna exquisite in grace though deficient in expression he was held during his life in the highest estimation A fatal passion for gaming involved him in continued scenes of distress His personal beauty was so great that  his master Lodovico Caracci is said to have drawn his angels from the head of Guido  NOTE XXIII VERSE  Titian's mute scholar rival of his fame    Titian is said to have resided in Spain from the year to and seems to have raised a strong passion for Art in that countryHis most eminent disciple was Juan Fernandez Ximenes de Navarrete who is called by his Spanish Biographer The Titian of SpainThough born deaf and dumb from whence he derives his common title  el Mudo  he rose to great reputation as a Painter and was warmly patronized by his Sovereign as appears from the following incidentIn painting the martyrdom of a Saint he had introduced the figure of his personal enemy who happened to be the King's Secretary in the character of the Executioner the Secretary complained to his master and petitioned that his features might be effaced but his Majesty defended the Painter and ordered the figure to remainIn praising this singular genius I have ventured to borrow something like a conceit from the famous Spanish Poet Lope de Vega who has celebrated his talents in the following verses  Del Mudo Pintor famosissimo  No quiso el cielo que hablasse  Porque con mi entendimiento  Diesse mayor sentimiento  A las cosas que pintasse  Y tanta vida les di  Con el pincel singular  Que como no pude hablar  Hize que hablassen por mi  The Poet also honoured this favourite Artist who died in with an Epitaph which turns on the same idea and which the curious reader may find in the Work from whence I have taken this short account of him  Vidas de los Pittores Espanoles por Palamino Velasco Octavo London  NOTE XXIV VERSE  And thou Velasquez share the honour due    Don Diego Velasquez de Silva the most accomplished of the Spanish Painters was born at Seville and clos'd his honourable and splendid life at Madrid in His master was Pacheco a Spaniard who united the sister arts of Painting and PoetryVelasquez was patronized by the famous Olivarez and had the honour of painting our Charles the First during his visit at Madrid perhaps he contributed not a little to form the taste and passion for art by which that Prince was so eminently distinguished The Spanish Painter rose to great honours in his own country and had like Rubens the singular fortune to unite the character of an Ambassador with that of an Artist being sent on an extraordinary commission in to Pope Innocent X  One of his most striking historical pictures was the expulsion of the Moors from Spain a noble national subject which he painted for Philip the Third in competition  with three Artists of reputation and obtained the preference  But he is particularly celebrated for the spirit and energy of his Portraits concerning which there are two singular ancedotes related by his Spanish Biographer and the following may possibly amuse the reader  In he executed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja Commander in chief of an armament appointed to New Spain and pleased himself so well in the execution that he affixed his name to the picture a circumstance not usual with him He had painted with pencils of uncommon length for the sake of working at a greater distance and with peculiar force so that the picture says my Spanish author when near is not to be distinguished and at a distance is a miracle As Velasquez after this portrait was finished was at work in the palace the King as usual went privately to his apartment to see him paint when observing the figure of Pareja and taking it for the real person he exclaimed with surprize  "What are you still here have you not your dispatches and why are you not gone"  But soon perceiving his mistake he turn'd to Velasquez who modestly doubted the reality of the deception and said  "I protest to you it deceived me"  For this story such as it is I am indebted to the author whom I have quoted in the preced ng Note The celebrated Murillo whose pictures are much better known in England than those of his master was a disciple of Velasquez  NOTE XXV VERSE  Thy care the soft the rich Murillo form'd    Don Bartolome Estevan Murillo was born in the neighbourhood  of Seville in His first master was Juan de Castillo but he soon settled in Madrid under the protection of Velasquez who contributed to his improvement in the most generous manner The Spaniards boast that Murillo became a great Painter without ever travelling out of Spain He is said to have refused the offer of an establishment in England from Charles the Second and to have pleaded his age as an excuse for not quitting his own country where he died and was buried with great marks of honour in  Those who wish for more information on the Artists of Spain may be amply gratified by the amusing work which Mr Cumberland has lately published on the Painters of that countrythey will find in it a very spirited account of the famous Mengs who died in the service of the Spanish court at the age of fiftyone in If we could trust to the praises bestowed on this celebrated Artist by his friend and biographer Azara we might revere him as the restorer of perfect art but the elegant writer of our country who has surveyed his capital productions with an impartial eye gives us to understand that they all betray a great poverty of genius Indeed the personal history of Mengs may tend to confirm this idea He was originally made a painter and a drudge by the tyranny of a cruel father and though he applied himself intensely through life to the practice and theory of his art he seems never to have attained that felicity of performance which can perhaps belong only to those who devote themselves to a favorite art in the happy ardour of unconstrained affection The professional writings of Mengs will  amuse if not instruct every lover of ArtBut readers of our country must feel some indignation at his insolent and injurious censure on a great Artist whose reputation is justly dear to every liberal Englishman  NOTE XXVI VERSE  No mean historian to record their praise    George Vasari to whom we are indebted for a most valuable history of Italian Painters was born at Arezzo in Tuscany Though the fame of the author seems to have eclipsed that of the artist he rose to considerable eminence as a painter and has left us a particular and entertaining account of himself and his pictures in the close of his great workit is introduced with an apology in which he speaks of his own talents and extreme passion for his art in the most modest and engaging mannerHis generous desire of doing justice to the merit of others is most happily rewarded in the following Elogy by the great Thuanus  "Ob excellentiam artis quam historia accurate eleganter scripta illustravit Georgius Vasarius meruit ut inter viros ingenio literis praestantes accenseretur Is Aretii in Etruria

pure Style see mild Bologna claim    The French author quoted above under the article Caracci not only speaks with the greatest warmth of the obligation which Painting owes to Lodovico Caracci for having raised it from that state of corruption into which it had fallen in all the schools of Italy but at the same time points out also the various manierists who had chiefly contributed to its debasement  The style introduced by Lodovico is recommended by that excellent judge Sir Joshua Reynolds See Discourse as better suited to grave and dignified subjects than the richer brilliancy of Titian  NOTE XXVIII VERSE  Titian's golden rays    This expression is borrowed from the close of that elegant sentence of modern Latin which the author of Fitzosborne's Letters has so justly commended

Rembrant Van Pryn born near Leyden died at Amsterdam or according to some accounts  The numerous works of this great master both with the engraver and pencil have rendered him universally known His singular studies and the pride which he seems to have taken in the natural force of his genius appear strongly marked in the two following passages of his French Biographer  "Les murs de son attelier couverts de vieux habits de piques et d'armures extraordinaires etoient toutes ses etudes ainsi qu'une armoire pleine d'etoffes anciennes d'autres choses pareilles qu'il avoit coutume d'appeller ses

"Qui es tu pour me parler de la sorte"Vandick repondit "Monsieur je suis Vandick pour vous servir"  Abr√©g√© de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres Tom III p  NOTE XXX VERSE  Yet Holland thy unwearied labours raise    There is no article of taste on which different writers have run more warmly into the opposite extremes of admiration and contempt than in estimating the Painters of Holland Those who are enchanted by the sublime conceptions of the Roman school are too apt precipitately to condemn every effort of the Dutch pencil as a contemptible performance while those who are satisfied with minute and faithful delineations of nature find absolute perfection in the very pictures which are  treated by others with the most supercilious neglectBut sound and impartial judgment seems equally to disclaim this hasty censure and this inordinate praiseand ranking the most eminent Dutch artists below the great Italian masters yet allows them considerable and peculiar meritA French author says I think not unhappily of the Dutch painters that they are  "dans la peinture ce que le comique le plaisant sonte dans la poesie"  In design their forte is certainly humour and they have frequently carried it to great perfection  NOTE XXXI VERSE  Proud of the praise by Rubens' pencil won    Sir Peter Paul Rubens who is happily styled by Mr Walpole  "The Popular Painter"  was born at Cologne and died of the gout at Antwerp The history of his life furnishes a most striking incentive to the young painter's ambitionThe many accomplishments which he possessed the infinitude of works which he produced the reputation and esteem the various honours and ample fortune which he so justly acquired present to the mind an animating idea of what may be expected from a happy cultivation of talents in a course of constant and spirited application Though he visited the court of Charles the First in the publick character of an ambassador it does not appear how long he resided hereMr Walpole conjectures about a yearHis pictures in the ceiling at  Whitehall were not painted in England which perhaps is the reason he has been at the pains of finishing them so neatly that they will bear the nearest inspection for he must have well known how greatly the reputation of any work depends on its first happy impression on the publick and concluded his pictures would be viewed by the king and court instantly on their arrival and that the critics would not be candid enough to delay their remarks on them till they were elevated to their intended height This noble work was falling into decay from which state it has been lately rescued by that excellent artist Mr Cipriani to whose care it has been most judiciously committed to be cleaned and repairedRubens received for this work ¬£  NOTE XXXII VERSE  Her soft Vandyke while graceful portraits please    Sir Anthony Vandyke the celebrated scholar of Rubens died of the same disorder which proved fatal to his master and at a much earlier period of life He was born at Antwerp expired in Black Fryars and was buried in St Paul's near the tomb of John of Gaunt On his first visit to England he received no encouragement from the Court but Charles becoming soon afterwards acquainted with his merit sent him an invitation to return Vandyke embraced the offer with joy and the king who shewed him by frequent sittings  the most flattering marks of esteem conferred on him the honour of knighthood in rewarding him also with the grant of an annuity of ¬£ for life  NOTE XXXIII VERSE  From Flanders first the secret power she caught    The Low Countries though little celebrated for inventive genius have given to mankind the two signal discoveries which have imparted as it were a new vital spirit both to Literature and to Painting This honour however has been brought into questionGermany made a strong but unsuccessful effort to rob Holland of the glory which she derives from the first invention of Printing and Painting in oil it has been said was known in Italy before the time of John Van Eyck or John of Bruges as he is commonly called to whom that discovery is generally ascribed about the year But Vasari in his Life of Antonello da Messina relates very particularly the circumstances of Van Eyck's invention and the subsequent introduction of the secret into Italy A most learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has supposed that Van Eyck might possibly  "learn the secret of using oil in England and take the honour of the invention to himself as we were then a country little known to the world of arts nor at leisure from the confusion of the times to claim the discovery of such a secret"    Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting Vol I p  The conjecture is not without some little foundationbut the conjectural claims which either Italy or England can produce to this excellent invention are by no means sufficiently strong to annihilate the glory of the happy and ingenious Fleming  Since the preceding part of this Note was written the reputation both of Van Eyck and his encomiast Vasari has been very forcibly attacked in an Essay on Oilpainting by Mr Raspe an Essay which discovers such a zealous attachment to the arts and such an active pursuit of knowledge as do great credit to its ingenious author But though I have perused it with the attention it deserves it does not lead me to retract what I had said because after all his researches on this subject it appears that although Oilpainting was not absolutely the invention of Van Eyck it was yet indebted to him for those improvements which made it of real value to his professionThe ingenious Fleming seems theresore to be still entitled to those honours that have been lavished on his name as improvement in such cases is often more useful and more meritorious than invention itself which is frequently the effect of chance while the former arises from welldirected study  NOTE XXXIV VERSE  Where sumptuous Leo courted every Muse    The  name of Medicis is familiar to every lover of the fine arts John de Medicis the Cardinal was raised to the papal See He continued that liberal patronage and encouragement to learning which had before distinguished his illustrious family He was profuse and magnificent The various and celebrated productions of taste and genius under his pontificate clearly mark the age of Leo the Xth as one of the great aeras of literature  NOTE XXXV VERSE  Untrodden paths of Art Salvator tried    Salvator Rosa was born at a village near Naples in After a youth of poverty and adventure he raised himself by his various and uncommon talents into lucrative reputation Having passed nine years at Florence in considerable employment he settled in Rome and died there at the age of in He was one of the few characters who have possessed a large portion of pleasant vivacity and satirical humour with a sublime imagination His talents as a painter are universally celebrated but his social virtues though perhaps not inferior are far from being so generally known In the "Raccolta di Lettere sulla Pittura" there are many of his letters to his intimate friend Ricciardi an Italian poet and professor of moral philosophy at Pisa which perfectly display the warmth of his friendship and the generosity of his heartThey contain  also some amusing anecdotes relating to his profession and the great delight which he took in discovering historical subjects of a peculiar cast untouched by other painters and appearing to an ignorant eye almost beyond the limits of his art He seems to describe himself with justice as well as energy in the following words of a letter to Ricciardi  "tutto bile tutto spirito tutto fuoco"  Though he must have been wonderfully pleasant as a companion and valuable as a friend yet he laments that his satires had made him many enemies and heartily wishes he had never produced them In that which relates to Painting he exposes indeed the vices of his brethren with great freedom and severityIt is remarkable that his poetry abounds more with learned allusions than with high flights of imagination yet in the satire I have mentioned there is much whimsical fancy An ape is introduced applying to a painter and begging to learn his profession as Nature he says has given him a genius for the mimetic artsThe painter compliesbut his disciple after an apprenticeship of ten years bids his master adieu with many humorous execrations against the art of PaintingOther parts of the poem contain many sensible and serious remarks on the abuses of the pencil and as the author has given us a portrait of himself in his poetical character I shall present it to the reader as a specimen of his style  La state all ombra e il pigro verno al foco  Tra

whimsical Italian poet Marino who being struck with some fresco works of the young painter at Paris employed him in some designs from his own poem l'Adone and enabled him to undertake an expedition to Rome He was recalled from thence by Cardinal Richelieu in but upon the death of Richelieu and the king he returned to Rome where he ended a life of primitive simplicity and patient application in

the French Academy with great reputation more than forty years he died in partly as the author of the Abr√©g√© assures us from the chagrin which he received from a cabal raised against him in favour of his rival Mignard but neither his own works nor the partial favour of his patron Louvois nor the friendship of Moliere who has written a long poem in his praise have been able to raise Mignard to the level of Le Brun  NOTE XXXVIII VERSE  Thy dawn Le Sueur announc'd a happier taste    Eustache Le Sueur who without the advantage of studying in Italy approached nearer than any of his countrymen to the manner of Raphael was a native of Paris Le Brun who came to visit him in his last moments is reported to have said on quitting his chamber  "Que la mort alloit lui tirer une grosse epine du pied"  If he was capable of uttering such a sentiment at such a time he thoroughly deserved the fate which is mentioned in the preceding Note  NOTE XXXIX VERSE  Though Fresnoy teaches in Horatian song

some eminent French authors concerning our national want of genius for the fine arts are refuted with great spirit in an ingenious essay by Mr Barry entitled "An Enquiry into the real and imaginary Obstructions to the Acquisition of the Arts in England" As this work highly distinguishes the elegance of his pen his Venus rising from the sea does equal honour to his pencil  NOTE XLI VERSE  Fierce Harry reign'd who soon with pleasure cloy'd    In this short account of the influence which the different characters of our Sovereigns  have had on the progress of national Art the Author is indebted principally to Mr Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting  NOTE XLII VERSE  Untaught the moral force of Art to feel    An accomplished Critic of our own time has touched on  the moral Efficacy of Picture  with his usual elegance and erudition After having illustrated the subject from the writings of Aristotle and Xenophon he concludes his remarks with the following reflection  "Yet considering its vast power in morals one cannot enough lament the ill destiny of this divine art which from the chaste handmaid of Virtue hath been debauched in violence of her nature to a shameless prostitute of Vice and procuress of Pleasure"  Hurd's Note on the following line of Horace  "  Suspendit picta vultum mentemque tabella  "  To this let me add one observation for the honour of our English artistsThe prostitution of the pencil so justly lamented by this amiable writer is perhaps less frequent in this kingdom than in any country whatever in which Painting has been known to rise to an equal degree of perfection  NOTE XLIII VERSE  Yet to thy Palace Kneller's skill supplied    Sir  Godfrey Kneller born at Lubec settled in England was knighted by King William created a Baronet by George the First and died No Painter was ever more flattered by the Muses who gave him credit for talents which he never displayed Dryden says in his enchanting Epistle to Kneller  Thy genius bounded by the times like mine  Drudges on petty draughts nor dares design  A more exalted work and more divine  But the drudgery of the Poet arose from the most cruel necessity that of the Painter from avarice the bane of excellence in every professionIf Sir Godfrey had any talents for history which is surely very doubtful we have as Mr Walpole well observes no reason to regret that he was confined to portraits as his pencil has faithfully transmitted to us  "  so many ornaments of an illustrious age  "  Though I have partly subscribed to the general idea that William in whose reign this Painter principally flourished  "contributed nothing to the advancement of arts"  yet I must observe that his employing Kneller to paint the Beauties at Hampton Court his rewarding him with knighthood and the additional present of a gold medal and chain weighing ¬£ may justify those lines of Pope which describe  "The Hero William"  as an encourager of Painting  NOTE XLIV VERSE  While partial Taste from modest Riley turn'd    John Riley was born in London Mr Walpole relates an anecdote of his being much mortified by Charles the Second who looking at his own picture exclaim'd  "Is this like me then Odsfish I am an ugly fellow"  The same author says happily of this artist  "With a quarter of Sir Godfrey's vanity he might have persuaded the world he was as great a master"  Notwithstanding his extreme modesty he had the good fortune to be appointed Principal Painter soon after the Revolution but died an early martyr to the gout  NOTE XLV VERSE  And Thornhill's blaze of Allegory gilt    Sir James Thornhill born in Dorsetshire was nephew to the celebrated Sydenham and educated by the liberality of that great physician He afterwards acquired a very ample fortune by his own profession was in parliament for Weymouth knighted by George the Second and died  His talents as a Painter are universally known from his principal works at Greenwich St Paul's c  NOTE XLVI VERSE  The youthful Noble on a princely plan    About twenty years ago the present Duke of Richmond opened in his house at Whitehall a gallery for artists completely filled with a small but wellchosen collection of casts from the antique and engaged two eminent artists to superintend and direct the studentsThis noble encouragement of art though superseded by a royal establishment is still entitled to remembrance and honour it not only served as a prelude to more extensive institutions but contributed much towards forming some capital artists of the present time The name of Mortimer is alone sufficient to reflect a considerable lustre on this early school  NOTE XLVII VERSE  Teach but thy transient tints no more to fly    Although the superior excellencies of this admirable artist make us peculiarly regret the want of durability in his exquisite productions yet he is far from being the only artist whose pictures soon discover an appearance of precipitate decay Fugitive colouring seems indeed to be the chief defect among our present painters in oil and it must be the most ardent wish of every lover of art that so great an evil may be effectually remedied As the Royal Academy is a society of enlightened artists established  for the improvement of every branch of Painting it may be hoped that they will pay attention to this mechanical point as well as to the nobler acquirements of art and employ some person who has patience and abilities for such an office to discover by a course of experiments to what cause this important evil is owing If it be found to arise from the adulteration of colours oils and varnishes might it not be eligible for the Academy to follow the example of another profession who where health and life are concerned obviate the difficulty of getting their articles genuine from the individual trader by opening a shop at the expence of the Society to prepare and sell the various ingredients free from those adulterations which private interest might otherwise produce  But there may be no just ground of complaint against the integrity of the colourman and this failure may perhaps arise from the artist's mixing his colours and their vehicles in improper proportions to each other that is instead of painting with oil properly thickened with colour using oil only fully stained with it to which a proper consistence or body as the painters call it is given by strong gum varnishes in short using more vehicle than colour by which although most brilliant and transparent effects may be produced yet the particles of colour are too much attenuated and divided from each other and consequently less able to withstand the destructive action of light If the deficiency  complained of originates from this source the Academy by a careful course of experiments may be able clearly to ascertain what preparations of the more delicate colours are most durable what oils and varnishes will best preserve the original brilliancy of the paint what are the best proportions for this purpose in which they can be used and how far glazing that almost irresistible temptation to oilpainters may or may not be depended on All these points are at present so far from being known with certainty that perhaps there are not two Painters who think perfectly alike on any one of them The author hopes that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his presuming to offer a hint on this delicate subject with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted The ideas which he has thus ventured to address to them arise only from the most ardent wish that future ages may have a just and adequate sense of the flourishing state of Painting in England in the reign of George the Third and that our present excellent artists may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the esteem of posterity  A very liberal Critic  Vide  the Gentleman's Magazine for November p  in his flattering remarks on the Poem seems in speaking of this Note to mistake a little the meaning of its author who alluded only to that defect in colouring where the finer tints are so managed for the sake of an immediate  and shortlived brilliancy that they sink very soon into no colour at all He did not mean to touch on those changes in Painting where the colours all grow darker the lights become brown and the shadows one mass of black This is likewise a great evil and calls aloud for redress Perhaps the Critic above mentioned has pointed out the true cause of this defect  viz  the indiscriminate blending of the colours and the not using pure simple uncompounded tints  NOTE XLVIII VERSE  The leading Principles of liberal Art    I embrace with pleasure the opportunity of paying this tribute to the great artist here mentioned who is not only at the head of his own profession but may justly be ranked among the first writers of the age His Discourses not merely calculated for the improvement of the young artists to whom they are addressed contain all the principles of true and universal taste embellished with great brilliancy of imagination and with equal force of expression  NOTE XLIX VERSE  Thy Ugolino c    As the subject of this admirable picture is taken from a poet so little known to the English reader as Dante it may not perhaps be impertinent to say that in Richardson's Discourse on the Science of a Connoisseur there is a translation  of the story in English blank verse A young and noble author now living has obliged the world with a translation of it in rhymeAs to the picture no artist could express more happily the wild and sublime spirit of the poet from whom he drew We may justly apply to him the compliment which a lively Italian addressed to a great man of his own country but of far inferior expression  "Fabro gentil ben sai  Ch' ancor tragico caso e' caro Oggetto  E che spesso l' Horror va col Diletto"  MARINO  NOTE L VERSE  Now Art exults with annual Triumphs gay    While we are delighted with the increasing splendor of these annual entertainments it is but just to remember that we are indebted to the Society of Arts and Sciences for our first public exhibition of Paintings The different societies of artists soon followed so excellent an example and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the highest honour on this happy institution Our exhibitions at once afford both the best nursery for the protection of infant genius and the noblest field for the display of accomplished merit nor do they only administer to the benefit of the artist and the pleasure of the public they have still a more exalted tendency and when national subjects are painted with dignity and force our exhibitions may  justly be regarded as schools of public virtue Perhaps the young soldier can never be more warmly animated to the service of his country than by gazing with the delighted public on a sublime picture of the expiring hero who died with glory in her defence But not to dwell on their power of inspiring martial enthusiasm our exhibitions may be said to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of those who fill the different departments of more tranquil life In support of this sentiment I beg leave to transcribe the following judicious remark from an author who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and spirited Essays  "They whose natural feelings have been properly improved by culture nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world know from experience how the heart is mollified the manners polished and the temper sweetened by a welldirected study of the arts of imitation The same sensibility of artificial excellence extends itself to the perception of natural and moral beauty and the student returns from the artist's gallery to his station in society with a breast more disposed to feel and to reverberate the endearments of social life and of reciprocal benevolence"  KNOX's Essays Moral and Literary p on Sculpture  NOTE LI VERSE  Thy Talents Hogarth c    William Hogarth was born in London and put apprentice to  an engraver of the most ordinary class but his comic talents which are said to have appeared first in the prints to Hudibras soon raised him to fame and fortuneHe married a daughter of Sir James Thornhill and died The peculiar merits of his pencil are unquestionable His Analysis of Beauty has been found more open to dispute but however the greater adepts in the science may differ on its principles it may certainly be called an honourable monument of his genius and application  NOTE LII VERSE  Whose needy Titian calls for illpaid gold    Richardson has fallen into a mistake concerning the famous Dana√´ and other pictures of Titian which he says in quoting a letter of Titian's without considering its address were painted for Henry the VIIIth of England a tyrant indeed voluptuous and cruel but still less detestable than the sullen and unnatural Philip the IId of Spain who filled up the measure of his superior guilt by the horrid assassination of his son Philip on his marriage with Mary assumed the title of King of England and to him Titian addressed the letter which speaks of the pictures in question the painter frequently mentions his attachment to his unworthy patron  His solicitude to ensure his protection and favour is strongly marked in the following short passage of  a letter which he addressed to one of Philip's attendants  "Mando ora la poesia di Venere e Adone nella quale V S vedr√† quanto spirito e amore so mettere nell' opere di sua Maest√†"  Raccolta tom ii p  How poorly this great artist was rewarded for his illdirected labour appears very forcibly in a long letter of complaint which he had spirit enough to address to the king on the many hardships he suffered in being unable to obtain the payment of the pension which had been granted to him by the emperor Charles the Vth  Raccolta tom ii p  NOTE LIII VERSE  Bid English pencils honour English worth    The great encouragement given our painters to select subjects from English history has of late years been very observable Many individuals of rank and fortune have promoted this laudable plan with spirit and effect and the Society of Arts and Sciences have confined their premiums to subjects taken from the British Annals  NOTE LIV VERSE  Her wounded Sidney Bayard's perfect peer    The gallant the amiable and accomplished Sir Philip Sidney may be justly placed on a level with the noble Bayard  "Le Chevalier sans peur sans reproche"  whose glory has of late received new lustre from the pen of Robertson and the pencil of West The striking scene here alluded to which preceded the death of Sidney has not yet I believe appeared upon canvass but is forcibly described by the noble and enthusiastic friend of Sidney the Lord BrookeSee Biograph Britan Art SIDNEY  The particulars also are minutely described and with great feeling in a letter from his uncle Leicester to Sir Thomas Heneage quoted in Collins's Memoirs of the Sidneys The tide of national admiration flowed very strong in favour of Sidney when Mr Walpole in speaking of Lord Brooke appeared to check the current but the merits of Sidney are sufficient to bear down all oppositionInstead of joining the elegant author I have mentioned in considering Sir Philip Sidney as  "an astonishing object of temporary admiration"  I am surprised that so judicious an author should ever question so fair a title to universal regard The learning and munificence the courage and courtesy of Sidney endeared him to every rank and he justly challenges the lasting affection of his country from the closing scene of his life in which heroism and humanity are so beautifully blended I never can think this accomplished character any ways degraded by his having written a tedious romance in which however there are many touches of exquisite beauty and spirit to amuse a most amiable sister whom he tenderly loved or by his having  threatened an unworthy servant of his father's with death in a hasty billet merely to intimidate and deter him from the future commission of an infamous breach of trust in opening his letters  NOTE LV VERSE  Th' heroic Daughter of the virtuous More    Margaret eldest daughter of the celebrated Sir Thomas More The scene which I have proposed for the subject of a picture is taken from the following passage in Ballard  "After Sir Thomas More was beheaded she took care for the burial of his body in the chapel of St Peter's ad Vincula within the precincts of the Tower and afterwards she procured his corpse to be removed and buried in the chancel of the church at Chelsea as Sir Thomas More in his lifetime had appointed His head having remained about fourteen days upon London Bridge and being to be cast into the Thames to make room for others she bought it For this she was summoned before the council as the same author relates and behaved with the greatest firmness justifying her conduct upon principles of humanity and filial piety She was however imprisoned but soon released and dying nine years after her father at the age of thirtysix was buried at St Dunstan's in Canterbury The head of her father which she had preserved with religious veneration in a box of  lead was at her particular request committed with her to the grave It was seen standing on her coffin in the year when the vault of the Roper her husband's family was opened"  See Ballard's Memoirs of Learned Ladies p  The character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by Addison and WalpoleShe married at the age of twenty William Roper Esquire of Kent to the infinite satisfaction of her father for she seems to have been the dearest object of his parental affection which is very strongly marked in his letters addressed to her She was indeed most eminently distinguished by her learning in an age when the graces of the mind were regarded as an essential article in female education but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a still superior lustre on this accomplished womanThere is more than one passage in her life which would furnish an admirable subject for the pencil Her interviw with her father on his return to the Tower is mentioned as such by Mr Walpole  NOTE LVI VERSE  But ob how poor the prostrate Satan lies    It is remarkable that the greatest painters have failed in this particular Raphael Guido and West are all deficient in the figure of Satan Richardson observes in his description of the pictures of Italy  "Je n'ai jamais vu d'aucun Ma√Ætre une representation  du Diable prince des Diables qui me satisfit"  Page  In recommending this subject to the pencil it may be proper to observe that it is not only extremely difficult but even attended with danger if we credit the following curious anecdote in a medical writer of great reputation  "Spinello fameux Peintre Toscan ayant peint la chute des anges rebelles donna des traits si terribles √† Lucifer qu'il en fut luimeme saisi d'horreur tout le reste de sa vie il crut voir continuellement ce Demon lui reprocher de l'avoir represent√© sous une figure si hidieuse  Tissot de la Sant√© des Gens de Lettres"  As this story is so singular it may amuse some readers to see it in the words of Vasari from whom Tissot seems to have taken itThe Italian Biographer says in describing a picture by Spinello Aretino who flourished in the close of the th century  "Si vede un Lucifero gia mutato in bestia bruttissima E si compiacque tanto Spinello di farlo orribile e contraffatto che si dice tanto puo alcuna fiata l'immaginazione che la detta figura da lui dipinta gl'apparue in sogno domandandolo doue egli l'hauvesse veduta si brutta e per che fattole tale scorno con i suoi pennelli E che egli svegliatosi dal sonno per la paura non potendo gridare con tremito grandissimo si scosse di maniera che la moglie destatasi lo soccorse ma niente di manco fu per cio a rischio stringendogli il cuore di morirsi per cotale accidente subitamente Ben che ad ogni  modo spiritaticcio e con occhi tondi poco tempo vivendo poi si condusse alla morte lasciando di se gran desiderio a gli amici"  Vasari Vita di Spinello Aretino pag Edit di Giunti  EPISTLE TO A FRIEND ON THE DEATH OF  JOHN THORNTON  Esq  CUJUS EGO INTERITU TOTA DE MENTE FUGAVI  HAEC STUDIA ATQUE OMNES DELICIAS ANIMI    NOTESCATQUE MAGIS MORTUUS ATQUE MAGIS  CATULLUS  EPISTLE TO A FRIEND  IN vain dear Monitor thy kind desire  To wake the embers of poetic fire  To clear the mind where Grief's dark shadows lower  And Fancy dies by Sorrow's freezing power  In vain would Friendship's chearing voice suggest  Her flattering visions to the Poet's breast  That public favor calls with just demand  Th' expected volume from his lingering hand  Lost are those anxious hopes that eager pride  With thee my THORNTON they declin'd they died  Friend of my opening soul whose love began  To hail thy Poet ere he rank'd as man  Whose praise like dewdrops which the early morn  Sheds with mild virtue on the vernal thorn  Taught his young mind each swell of thought to shew  And gave the germs of fancy strength to blow  Dear firm associate of his studious hour  Who led his idler step to Learning's bower  Tho' young imparting to his giddier youth  Thy thirst of science and thy zeal for truth  Ye towers of Granta where our friendship grew  And that pure mind expanded to my view  Our love fraternal let your walls attest  Where Attic joys our letter'd evening blest  Where midnight from the chains of sleep reliev'd  Stole on our social studies unperceiv'd  But not my THORNTON in that calm alone  Was thy mild genius thy warm virtue known  When manhood mark'd the hour for busy strife  And led us to the crowded maze of life  Where honours dearly bought and golden spoil  Tempt not the careless Bard who shrinks from toil  And whence to sweet retirement's soothing shade  Love and the Muse thy willing friend convey'd  Thy soul more firm to join the struggling crowd  To nobler Themis toilsome homage vow'd  With zeal devoting to her sacred throne  A heart as uncorrupted as her own  Still as thy mind with manly powers endued  The opening path of active life pursued  And round the ripening field of business rang'd  Thy heart unwarp'd unharden'd unestrang'd  To early friendship still retain'd its truth  With all the warm integrity of youth  Whene'er affliction's force thy friend opprest  Thou wert the rock on which his cares might rest  From thy kind words his rising hopes would own  The charm of reason in affection's tone  Where is the soothing voice of equal power  To take its anguish from the present hour  Beneath the pressure of a grief so just  The lenient aid of books in vain I trust  They that could once the war of thought controul  And banish discord from the jarring soul  Now irritate the mind they us'd to heal  They speak too loudly of the loss I feel  Thou faithful censor of the Poet's strain  No more shalt thou his sinking hope sustain  No more with ardent zeal's enlivening fire  Call from inglorious shades his silent lyre  No more as in our days of pleasure past  The eye of judgment o'er his labors cast  Keen to discern the blemishes that lurk  In the loose texture of his growing work  Eager to praise yet resolute to blame  Kind to his verse but kinder to his fame  How may the Muse who prosper'd by thy care  Now meet the public eye without despair  Now if harsh censures on her failings pour  Her warmest advocate can speak no more  Cold are those lips which breath'd the kind defence  If spleen's proud cavil strain'd her tortur'd sense  Which bade her song to public praise aspire  And call'd attention to her trembling lyre  Ah could she now thus petrified with grief  Find in some lighter lay a vain relief  Still must she deem such verse if such could be  A wound to friendship and a crime to thee  Profanely utter'd at this sacred time  When thy pale corse demands her plaintive rhime  And Virtue weeping whom she could not save  Calls the just mourner to thy recent grave  Hail hallow'd vault whose darksome caverns hold  A frame though mortal of no common mould  A heart scarce sullied with a human flaw  Which shun'd no duty and transgress'd no law  In joy still guarded in distress serene  Thro' life a model of the golden mean  Which Friendship only led him to transgress  Whose heavenly spirit sanctifies excess  Pure mind whose meekness in thy mortal days  Pursuing virtue still retir'd from praise  Nor wish'd that Friendship should on marble give  That perfect image of thy worth to live  Which 'twas thy aim alone to leave imprest  On the close tablet of her faithful breast  If now her verse against thy wish rebel  And strive to blazon what she lov'd so well  Forgive the tender thought the moral song  Which would thy virtues to the world prolong  That rescued from the grave's oblivious shade  Their useful lustre may be still survey'd  Dear to the pensive eye of fond regret  As light still beaming from a sun that's set  Oft to our giddy Muse thy voice has taught  The just ambition of poetic thought  Bid her bold view to latest time extend  And strive to make futurity her friend  If any verse her little art can frame  May win the partial voice of distant fame  Be it the verse whose fond ambition tries  To paint thy mind in truth's unfading dyes  Tho' firm yet tender ardent yet refin'd  With Roman strength and Attic grace combin'd  What tho' undeck'd with titles power and wealth  Great were thy generous deeds and done by stealth  For thy pure bounty from observance stole  Nor wish'd applause but from thy conscious soul  Tho' thy plain tomb no sculptur'd form may shew  No boastful witness of suspected woe  Yet heavenly shapes that shun the glare of day  To that dear spot shall nightly visits pay  Pale Science there shall o'er her votary strew  Her flow'rs yet moist with sorrow's recent dew  There Charity Compassion's lovely child  In rustic notes pathetically wild  With grateful blessings bid thy name endure  And mourn the patron of her villagepoor  E'en from the midnight shew with music gay  The soul of Beauty to thy tomb shall stray  In sweet distraction steal from present mirth  To sigh unnotic'd o'er the hallow'd earth  Which hides those lips that glow'd with tender fire  And sung her praises to no common lyre  But Friendship wrapt in sorrow's deepest gloom  Shall keep the longest vigils at thy tomb  Her wounded breast disdainful of relief  There claims a fond praeeminence in grief  She as the seasons of the year return  Shall place thy fav'rite plants around thy urn  Which in the luxury of tender thought  Her care shall raise with plaintive emblems wrought  Recalling ever with remembrance sweet  Thy kind attachment to her calm retreat  Short was thy life but ah its thread how fine  How pure the texture of the finish'd line  What tho' thy opening manhood could not gain  Those late rewards maturer toils attain  Hope's firmest promises 'twas thine to raise  That merit's brightest meed would grace thy lengthen'd days  For thine were Judgment's patient powers to draw  Entangled justice from the nets of law  Thine firm Integrity whose language clear  Ne'er swell'd with arrogance or shook with fear  Reason's mild power unvex'd by mental strife  Sway'd the calm current of thy useful life  Whose even course was in no season lost  Nor rough with storms nor stagnated by frost  In scenes of public toil or social ease  'Twas thine by firm sincerity to please  Sweet as the breath of spring thy converse flow'd  As summer's noontide warmth thy friendship glow'd  O'er thy mild manners by no art constrain'd  A pensive pleasing melancholy reign'd  Which won regard and charm'd th' attentive eye  Like the soft lustre of an evening sky  Yet if perchance excited to defend  The injur'd merit of an absent friend  That gentle spirit rous'd to virtuous ire  Indignant flash'd resentment's noble fire  Tho' just observance in thy life may trace  A lovely model of each moral grace  Thy last of days the noblest lesson taught  Severe instruction and too dearly bought  Whose force from memory never can depart  But while it mends must agonize the heart  Tho' thy shrunk nerves were destin'd to sustain  Th' increasing horrors of slowwasting pain  Those spiritquenching pangs whose base controul  Clouds the clear temper and exhausts the soul  Yet in that hour when Death asserts his claim  And his strong summons shakes the conscious frame  When weaker minds by frantic fear o'erthrown  Shrink in wild horror from the dread Unknown  Thy firmer soul with Christian strength renew'd  Nor lost in languor nor by pain subdued  While thy cold grasp the hand of Friendship prest  And her vain aid in fault'ring accents blest  With awe but not as Superstition's slave  Survey'd the gathering shadows of the grave  And to thy God in death devoutly paid  That calm obedience which thy life display'd  Thou friend yet left me of the choicer few  Whom grief's fond eyes with growing love review  O thou whom mutual sorrow will incline  To mix thy sympathetic sighs with mine  Still be it ours to pay with just regret  At Friendship's sacred shrine our common debt  Tho' doom'd so Heaven ordains to see no more  The gentle Being whom we both deplore  Painting shall still sweet soothing art supply  A form so precious in Affection's eye  Ah little thought we in that happier hour  When our gay Muse rehears'd the Pencil's power  To mourn that form in cold obstruction laid  And see him only by the pencil's aid  Blest be that pencil every art be blest  That stamps his image deeper on our breast  Oft let us loiter on his favourite hill  Whose shades the sadlypleasing thought instil  Recount his kindness as we fondly rove  And meet his spirit in the lonely grove  At evening's pensive hour or opening day  He yet shall seem the partner of our way  Blest Spirit still thro' Fancy's ear impart  The calm of virtue to the troubled heart  Correct each sordid view each vain desire  And touch the mortal with celestial fire  So may we still in this dark scene of earth  Hold sweet communion with thy living worth  And while our purer thoughts thy merit scan  Revere the Angel as we lov'd the Man  ODE INSCRIBED TO JOHN HOWARD ESQ FRS AUTHOR OF "  The State of

success of his various projects for the benefit of mankind I have frequently heard him dwell with great pleasure on the fortunate incident which led him to the discovery of his Ventilator to which I have alludedHe had ordered a new floor for one of his rooms his carpenter not having prepared the work so soon as he expected he thought the season improper for laying down new boards when they were brought to his house and gave orders for their being deposited in his barnfrom their accidental position in that place he caught his first idea of this useful invention    Who felt like thee for human

extorting money from these injured sufferersThis circumstance unknown to me when the Ode was written has tempted me to introduce the few additional stanzas as it is my ardent wish to render this

Britain yet boasts unnumber'd hearts  Who keenly pant for public praise  Her battles yet are firmly fought  By Chiefs with Spartan courage fraught  Her Painters with Athenian zeal unite  To trace the glories of the prosp'rous fight  And gild th' embattled scene with art's immortal light  Tho' many a hand may well portray  The rushing war's infuriate shock  Proud Calpe bids thee WRIGHT display  The terrors of her blazing rock  The burning bulks of baffled Spain  From thee she claims nor claims in vain  Thou mighty master of the mimic flame  Whose matchless pencil with peculiar aim  Has form'd of lasting fire the basis of thy fame  Just in thy praise thy country's voice  Loudly asserts thy signal power  In this reward may'st thou rejoice  In modest labour's silent hour  Far from those seats where envious leagues  And dark cabals and base intrigues  Exclude meek Merit from his proper home  Where Art whom Royalty forbade to roam  Against thy talents clos'd her selfdishonor'd dome  When partial pride and mean neglect  The nerves of injur'd Genius gall  What kindly spells of keen effect  His energy of heart recall  Perchance there is no spell so strong  As Friendship's sympathetic song  By fancy link'd in a fraternal band  Artist and Bard in sweet alliance stand  They suffer equal wounds and mutual aid demand  Go then to slighted worth devote  Thy willing verse my fearless Muse  Haply thy free and friendly note  Some joyous ardor may infuse  In fibres that severely smart  From potent Envy's poison'd dart  Thro' WRIGHT's warm breast bid tides of vigor roll  Guard him from meek Depression's chill controul  And rouse him to exert each sinew of his soul  ODE TO THE COUNTESS DE GENLIS  ODE TO THE COUNTESS DE GENLIS  I  NO more let English pride arraign  The Gallic Muse as light and vain  Whose trifling fingers can but weave  The flimsy novel to deceive  Inaction's languid hour  Where sentiment from nothing spun  Shines like a gardencobweb in the sun  Thrown in autumnal nights o'er many a wither'd flower  II  Too often in the giddy fit  Of wanton or satiric wit  The rash and frolic sons of France  Have sketch'd the frivolous romance  While reason stood aloof  While modesty the work disclaim'd  And griev'd religion with disdain inflam'd  On the licentious page pronounc'd her just reproof  III  The Genius of the generous land  Survey'd the vain fantastic band  And kindling with indignant pride  Athirst for genuine glory cried  "Too long have ye disgrac'd  "The Gallic nameye sophists hence  "A female hand shall expiate your offence  "The wrongs that ye have done to virtue truth and taste  IV  "Rise my GENLIS those ills correct  "That spring from this pernicious sect  "To infancy's important years  "That season of parental fears  "Devote thy varied page  "Mould and defend the youthful heart  "Against the subtle souldebasing art  "Of the sarcastic wit and selfintitled sage"  V  Illumin'd with angelic zeal  And wishing Nature's general weal  The lovely moralist arose  The flame that from religion flows  Play'd round her pensive head  The tender virtues smiling strove  T' enrich the variegated web she wove  Where wisdom's temperate hand the flowers of fancy spread  VI  The sisters of theatric power  Whose intermingled sun and shower  Give to the stage in friendly strife  Each touching charm of chequer'd life  Inspir'd the friend of youth  Arts yet unknown to her they taught  To fix and charm quick childhood's rambling thought  With unexampled scenes of tenderness and truth  VII  Her pathos is not proudly built  On splendid or impassion'd guilt  The little incidents that rise  As sportive youth's light season flies  Her simple drama fill  Yet he the sweet Socratic sage  Euripides    Who steep'd in tears the wide Athenian stage  Fram'd not his moral scene with more pathetic skill  VIII  In the rich novel's ampler field  Her genius rears a radiant shield  With fancy's blazonry imprest  Potent to save the youthful breast  From passion's poison'd dart  Like that which Homer's gods produce  Its highwrought beauties shine with double use  To charm the curious mind and guard th' unwary heart  IX  Ye Fairies 'twas your boast to bind  In sweet amaze the infant mind  But scorning fiction's faded flower  Behold GENLIS in magic power  Your sorcery excells  She first of childhood's pleasing friends  Arm'd with the force that liberal science lends  From art and nature frames her more attractive spells  Alluding to the Tale intitled "La F√©erie de l'Art de la Nature"    X  Lovely magician in return  For the sweet tears of fond concern  With moral pleasure's tender thrill  Awak'd by thy enchanting skill  Accept this votive rhyme  Spurn not a wreath of foreign hue  Tho' rudely twin'd of humble flowers that grew  In a sequester'd vale of Albion's wayward clime  XI  Think if from Britain's churlish sky  This verse to foreign genius fly  Think not our letter'd females raise  No titles to melodious praise  Keen science cannot find  One clime within the earth's wide zone  Whose daughters Britain have surpass'd thy own  In the career of art the triumphs of the mind  XII  This honest boast of English pride  Which meaner merit might deride  Will ne'er the just GENLIS beguile  Of one disdainful envious smile  For envy ne'er conceal'd  From her clear sight a rival's claim  Her voice has swell'd my fair compatriots fame  Pleas'd with their glorious march o'er learning's varied field  XIII  Doubly GENLIS may'st thou rejoice  Whene'er impartial glory's voice  Ranks with the happiest toils of men  The graceful works of woman's pen  Tho' not of Gallic frame  For O beneath whatever skies  Records of female genius may arise  Those records must enfold thy fair and fav'rite name  XIV  In every clime where arts have smil'd  Where'er the mother loves her child  And pants with anxious zeal possest  To fortify the tender breast  And the young mind enlarge  From thy chaste page she'll learn the art  Fondly to play the sage preceptor's part  And draw her dearest joys from that important charge  XV  Wherever youth with curious view  Instructive pleasure shall pursue  The little lively student there  With rapt attention's keenest air  Shall o'er thy volumes bend  And while his tears their charm confess  His grateful voice shall in their author bless  The spiritkindling guide the heartenchanting

bids my grief subside  Rais'd by the sickness of my distant friend  Blest the dear lines so long to hope deny'd  By languor's aching fingers kindly penn'd  How keen the fear to feel his letters end  Whose wit was my delight whose truth my guide  But how did joy that painful fear transcend  When I again his well known hand descried  Such was the dread of newcreated man  When first he miss'd the

glistening sail in view  Tumultuous hopes arise  'Tis heI feel the vision true  I trust my conscious eyes  IV  His promis'd signals from the mast  My timid doubts destroy  What was your pain ye terrors past  To this ecstatic joy  SONG  I  FROM glaring shew and giddy noise  The pleasures of the vain  Take me ye soft ye silent joys  To your retreats again  II  Be mine ye cool ye peaceful

Alas too wellfor mental toil  Our fine machinery will spoil  As Nature has decreed  She form'd the powers that raise the soul  Like wheels that kindle as they roll  And perish by their speed  III  Let health and vigour on the stage  Support the scene while milder age  Resigns the bustling part  If flowers the busy path adorn  Ingratitude there plants her thorn  Which pierces to the heart  IV  Oft hast thou seen her poison'd shoot  Where Hope expected fairest fruit  Yet still thy bounty flows  Like constant dew that falls on earth  Although it wakens into birth  The nightshade with the rose  V  Thy warmth of heart O still retain  Nor of ingratitude complain  Howe'er her wounds may burn  Bliss from benevolence must flow  Angels are blest while they bestow  Unconscious of return  VI  And

lustre of thy soul  No more eccentrically roll  Thro' Labour's long career  O haste it's dangerous course confine  And let it permanently shine  In Pleasure's milder sphere  VIII  In Friendship's name

invitation then forbear  Tho' at thy board in union rare  Kind Plenty reigns with Wit  Thy roof is joyous but I doubt  That we should find the brilliant rout  For burning eyes unfit  X  Thy noisy town and dusty street  Do thou exchange for this retreat  Whose charms thy songs commend  On Learning's page forbid to look  We yet can read that dearer book  The visage of a friend  A CARD OF INVITATION  TO Mr GIBBON at BRIGHTHELMSTONE  AN English Sparrow pert and free  Who chirps beneath his native tree  Hearing the Roman Eagle's near  And feeling more respect than fear  Thus with united love and awe  Invites him to his shed of straw  Tho' he is but a twittering Sparrow  The field he hops in rather narrow  When nobler plumes attract his view  He ever pays them homage due  And looks with reverential wonder  On him whose talons bear the thunder  Nor could the Jackdaws e'er inveigle  His voice to vilify the Eagle  Tho' issuing from those holy tow'rs  In which they build their warmest bow'rs  Their Sovereign's haunt they slily search  In hopes to find him on his perch  For PINDAR says beside his God  The thunderbearing Bird will nod  Then peeping round his still retreat  They pick from underneath his feet  Some molted feather he lets fall  And swear he cannot fly at all  Lord of the sky whose pounce can tear  These croakers that infest the air  Trust him the Sparrow loves to sing  The praise of thy imperial wing  He thinks thou'lt deem him on his word  An honest tho' familiar Bird  And hopes thou soon wilt condescend  To look upon thy little friend  That he may boast around his grove  A visit from the BIRD OF JOVE  TO MR MASON  On his sending the Author his Translation of DUFRESNOY with Notes by Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS  I  DEAR Brother of the tuneful art  To whom I justly bend  I prize with a fraternal heart  The pleasing gift you send  II  With pride by envy undebas'd  My English spirit views  How far your elegance of taste  Improves a Gallic Muse  III  I thought that Muse but meanly drest  When her stiff gown was Latin  But you have turn'd her grogram vest  Into fine folds of sattin  IV  Mild REYNOLDS looks with liberal favor  On your adopted girl  And to the graceful robe you gave her  Adds rich festoons of pearl  IMPROMPTU TO MR MEYER  On his sending the Author from the Continent two Prints representing The Coronation of VOLTAIRE and ROUSSEAU's Arrival in Elysium  I  THE Song that shakes the festive roof  When mirth and music's liveliest notes ascend  Is not more pleasing than the proof  Of kind remembrance from an absent friend  II  Then guess the pleasure that we share  And thus dear MEYER accept the thanks we owe  While we behold the crown'd VOLTAIRE  And see Elysium hail our lov'd ROUSSEAU  III  May all the honor all the joy  Known by each genius in thy gift portray'd  Be thine without the dull alloy  That ting'd their golden days with dusky shade  IV  As lively as the gay VOLTAIRE  With his keen pen may thy fine pencil strive  May'st thou as long delight the fair  And triumph like the Bard at  eightyfive  V  As tender as the warm ROUSSEAU  Like him thy happier thoughts on nature fix  But 'midst thy prospering children know  A true Elysiumon this side the Styx  A RECEIPT  To make a TRAGEDY  TAKE a virgin from Asia from Afric or Greece  At least a king's daughter or emperor's niece  Take an elderly miss for her kind confidant  Still ready with pity or terror to pant  While she faints and revives like the sensitive plant  Take a Hero thought buried some ten years or more  But with life enough left him to rattle and roar  Take a horrid old brute who deserves to be rack'd  And call him a tyrant ten times in each act  Take a priest of cold blood and a warrior of hot  And let them alternately bluster and plot  Then throw in of soldiers and slaves  quantum suff  Let them march and stand still fight and halloo enough  Now stir all together these separate parts  And season them well with Ohs faintings and starts  Squeeze in while they're stirring a potent infusion  Of rage and of horror of love and illusion  With madness and murder complete the conclusion  Let your princess tho' dead by the murderous dagger  In a wanton bold epilogue ogle and swagger  Prove her past scenes of virtue are vapor and smoke  And the stage's morality merely a joke  Let her tell with what follies our country is curst  And wisely conclude that playwriting's the worst  Now serve to the public this olio complete  And puff in the papers your delicate treat  TO MISS SEWARD  On her being at EARTHAM in the variable Weather August  I  "WHENCE are these storms"an angry poet cry'd  Who saw his shady summer haunts defac'd  Saw o'er his shatter'd grove black whirlwinds ride  And loud lamented this untimely waste  II  He spoke and Aeolus uprear'd his head  Half his huge form round which dark clouds were driv'n  Rising from ocean's broad and billowy bed  Fill'd up the vast expanse from earth to heav'n  III  As his fierce eye survey'd the rough profound  From the stern god the voice of anger broke  Air earth and sea reverberate the sound  And shrinking nature shudder'd as he spoke  IV  "Know thou vain Bard within thy mansion dwells  "The wond'rous source of all this wild uproar  "Thence round my cave the din of discord swells  "And I my rebel offspring rule no more  V  "To own my laws my mad'ning sons refuse  "All all are deaf to my paternal pow'r  "Struggling alike to kiss that vagrant Muse  "Who deigns to visit thy sequester'd bow'r  VI  "Rough Boreas us'd in these still months to fleep  "Starts from his cell in passion's wild alarms  "While dripping Auster rushes from the deep  "To snatch the Fairone from his brother's arms  VII  "Each other's fond ambition to destroy  "Alike they struggle merciless as death  "See my young Zephyr Nature's tender joy  "Encounters Eurus with contentious breath  VIII  "Cease my rash sons this cruel war to wage  "Tho' tempting beauty gave your conflict birth  "Lest Famine waken'd by your frantic rage  "Stalk in fell triumph o'er the blasted earth  IX  "See shiv'ring mortals mourn th' inverted year  "While Ceres weeps her golden pride deprest  "If ye no longer Nature's law revere  "Yet mildly listen to your sire's request  X  "Let each in order taste the tempting bliss  "For which these mutual wounds ye vainly bear  "Each unmolested take one precious kiss  "And freely clasp this phrenzykindling Fair"  XI  He paus'dblack Boreas eldest of his race  Whose stormy passion the chill Maiden shocks  Binds her reluctant in his strong embrace  And sports licentious in her auburn locks  XII  Eurus succeeds of less disgusting mien  Yet mad the trembling Fairone to assail  Beneath his pressure more intensely keen  The wounded ruby of her lip grows pale  XIII  Next with mild charms and less tumultuous love  By melting Auster see the nymph carest  He with the softness of the murm'ring dove  Waves his moist pinions o'er her softer breast  XIV  Now lively Zephyr the sweet Muse is thine  O long embrace her in our laughing skies  And round her bid this joyous landscape shine  Rich as her verse and radiant as her eyes  CONTENT  Written at the request of a Lady for the Vase at  Batheaston    "HOW idle are mortals" said Wisdom to Youth  "They slight the clear dictates of Reason and Truth  "They worship Ambition to Pleasure they bend  "Yet blindly o'erlook a more excellent friend  "And hence their vain hopes are eternally crost  "Their life in a tempest of wishes is lost  "Still destin'd to toil and of toil to repent  "For neglect of just vows to the Goddess Content  "That Goddess from whom all felicity flows  "Who unites every good in the gift she bestows  "So free of her bounty to all who confess it  "To solicit her smile is almost to possess it"  When I heard this fine speech my fond passion was rais'd  And I set forth in quest of the Being so prais'd  At the mansion of Grandeur my search I begin  And ask if the Goddess Content is within  But Pride who as centinel guarded the door  Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before  He told me I wanted a poor rustic slut  And bade me go look in some little thatch'd hut  I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode  'Twas a snug pretty cottage and stood near the road  And here a good woman possessing tho' humble  A face that could frown and a tongue that would grumble  Saidthe person I ask'd for had lodg'd in her cot  But alas such good luck was no longer her lot  For she quitted her roof where she oft had repos'd  When yon great house was built and the common inclos'd  I conceiv'd as I now bade the village farewell  With the mild sons of Science this Goddess must dwell  But those where I sought some obliging instructor  Were squabbling about an electric conductor  Some cry'd up the point some commended the ball  The soft breath of Science was turn'd to a squall  The Sages no mental conductor could find  To draw off the flame that now flash'd on their mind  In haste I exclaim'd to the Learned adieu  For e'en Science offends when she talks like a shrew  Having wander'd so wide of the object I sought  I was now led to think and rejoic'd at the thought  This Goddess herself for her charms so renown'd  With the daughters of Beauty must surely be found  With this hope I approach'd unperceiv'd by them all  Three lovely young girls just array'd for the ball  In each whose bright eyes on a mirror were bent  I thought I discover'd a spark of Content  But watching them more in their beautiful faces  Of the goddess I sought I no more saw the traces  For as they survey'd with a critical glance  The elegant MONTAGU move in the dance  In her exquisite figure such graces were shewn  That viewing her charms they distrusted their own  Thou gentlest of nymphs while thy triumphs increase  Unconscious of beauty so fatal to peace  Tho' the sparks of Content in one sex thou may'st smother  Bright Ecstasy's flame thou wilt raise in the other  If in bosom parental Content could reside  The heart of thy parent this treasure must hide  But alas 'tis a truth which all parents lament  Their tender anxiety stifles Content  O tell me while vainly to find thee I pant  Dear latent Divinity where is thy haunt  "Away to Batheaston" Goodnature replies  "Behold she there weaves the poetical prize"  With thy Myrtle kind MILLER O let me be crown'd  Then my search is repaid and the Goddess is found  Nay if to another your wreath you assign  And give it to verse far superior to mine  My search's dear object I still must attain  And the proof of this wonder's exceedingly plain  It rests on this maxim by Horace invented  The Bard who writes worst is the Bard most contented  My claim to this blessing thus made very clear  If I've nothing to hope I have nothing to fear  For MILLER can please while the mind she amuses  Both when she bestows and e'en when she refuses  In truth I suspect from her singular aim  The Goddess I seek is conceal'd by her name  She herself is Content and her house is the fane  Where Spleen and Illnature no favours obtain  Some mortals in vain for admission must pray  But all who once enter go smiling away  END
