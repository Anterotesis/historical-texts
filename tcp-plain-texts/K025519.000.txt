 THE SPEECH DELIVERED BY ROBERT JEPHSON  Esq  On the th of FEBRUARY In the Debate on the COMMITTING HEADS OF A BILL FOR  The better Encouragement of Persons professing the  Popish Religion  to become  Protestants  and for the further Improvement of the Kingdom  JOHN FOSTER  Esq  in the Chair  DUBLIN PRINTED BY JAMES HOEY JUN AT THE MERCURY IN PALIAMENTSTREET MDCCLXXIV  To the Editor  Mr HOEY  HAVING through your indulgence perused a manuscript which from its substance should become the property of the public it is a great satisfaction to find that the Author hath been  prevailed upon to yield it up No subject can be more important than one which involves the happiness of our country none in which mistakes can be more fatalThe  internal  interests of IRELAND lye within a small compass the employment of our people in useful industry and security to individuals in the pursuit of it On this principle it was that our  penal laws  became lately a matter of consideration in our own HOUSE OF COMMONS and certainly no subject at present requires to be more fully discussed  One gentleman in particular distinguished himself in the debate and pronounced the Speech now happily drawn through your hands from the Shades of the closet On the day of its being delivered it made an impression where impression should begin The contents flew rapidly from the House to the people and became the principal topic of every conversation The Speaker's great powers gave splendor to argument and suspicion could not fall on eloquence when it was seen that every ray of illumination converged  to a single point to the good of his countryTaking political philosophy for his guide he could not lose his wayin that way he could not walk alone but collected the united powers of the heart and head to lead others  into it  His abundance bore on his hearers like a torrent which confirmed habits of thinking could hardly resist He shewed he proved that the prosperity of this nation can never be obtained from the depression of two thirds of the people born to labour and who must be destitute  of every convenience of life without itThat the improvement of this country cannot be expected from men virtually forbid by law  to emprove  from men limited in landed tenures and from tenures limited in profit  BUT the truths delivered and the truths implied in the Speech itself must come very faintly from the delineation of a common hand They will be exhibited by you Sir in their full lustre from the colouring of a great master who has already freed some from the captivity of preoccupation  and taught them to substitute knowledge to opinion as a preliminary to the substitution of confidence to jealousyThis surely is beginning well before the prescription of necessity comes too late for reestablishing a sickly public  I am Sir Your very humble servant C O'CONOR  April d  A SPEECH c  Mr FORSTER  THE Question at present before us may be considered in two lights either as a scheme for inducing Papists to contribute to the  population and improvement of corporate towns by allowing them to take lots for building or to the cultivation of the country in general by permitting them to have small portions of land with a more advantageous tenure in their leases than they were before entitled to from the circumscriptions they labour under in consequence of the several statutes in force against them or the Bill may be considered as one step towards the partial repeal of a body of laws which  have been esteemed by some as one of the principal barriers of our civil and religious constitutions  IN the first view 'tis certainly an object of some consequence in the second of the utmost magnitude The arguments which have been offered in favour of the Bill as an expedient for effecting the desirable purpose held forth in it's title and in the contemplation of my worthy friend  place="foot" N="*" Hs Lshe Esq  who introduced it have been  sufficient to convince me that there is no danger of prejudice to the established interest of Ireland by our passing it into a law especially when there are such prudent regulations in regard to the power of devise therefore Sir I shall not take up your time by a repetition of reasons which you have heard already with much greater weight to the same point from other gentlemen but I beg your indulgence while I deliver my sentiments on this subject in a more comprehensive  view than it will admit of if contracted to the narrow bottom of the first simple consideration  As I intend to give my vote in favour of the Bill 'tis a great satisfaction to me to find it admitted on all sides that the laws of Ireland against Popery are in many respects inconsistent with true religion and rectitude not to be justified in several instances on spiritual or moral principles but as they first sprung from necessity can best be supported  by the predominancy of that plea only  THERE is Sir no principle of natural justice more clear no precept of moral policy more evident than that the rigour of penal statutes ought not to extend beyond the bounds absolutely necessary for the maintenance and good order of society when they transgress such limits every foundation of reliance between the legislature and the people is shaken such laws become  the terror not the protection of the subject he walks under them not as under the friendly roof which is to shelter him from the furious storm of wild unbridled outrage but like the tottering wall that every moment may crush him by its casual ruin accident not justice is his deliverer nor can he boast that committing no offence he feared no punishment his miserable consolation is that with innocence at his side he had the good fortune to escape itAs natural  justice is the principle common benefit is the end of state penalties Let the dreary tracts of desolate and uncultivated territory in every province of your kingdom proclaim how this end has been defeated by your penal statutes against Popery the husbandman will not turn up the earth nor the sower put down the grain when they know another is to reap the fruits of their toil and industryBlessed Sir as this island is by fertility of soil and temperature of climate we have often  endeavoured to investigate the causes of its partial barrenness and depopulation Sometimes we complain that our relative and dependent situation on a too powerful neighbour has dried up the springs of industry sometimes we say the rigorous exactions of our landlords damp all vigour and exertion in the inferior classes of our peasantry and sometimes with listless despondency we supinely acquiesce under the lazy reproach of national sloth and inactivity but we carefully avert our  eyes from these acts of our forefathers more prohibitory than the jealous and illiberal policy of a sister country more fraught with oppression than the unfeeling rapacity of our manyacred landholders more productive of inertness than the unmerited character of national indolence  WE must speak with deference of these laws while they are yet in being but were they once annulled humanity would exult over  their abrogation it would say they were unlike all other legal promulgations not the bridle but the spur to wickedness tempting not restraining the most dangerous passions encouraging not chastising the worst transgressions The jurisprudence of other civilized governments knows them not the universal instinct of nature disclaims them Can the partial code of any community or of the greatest nation drown the universal voice of nature or can volumes of parchment confront her  ordinances Divine and natural precepts say  Honour him who gave you being  the popery laws of Ireland say  Betray and beggar him  To knit more closely the endearing ties of private faith and of domestic security has been the favourite aim of every polished legislature this angry code makes them the objects of scrutiny and the prey of the informer it ransacks the oeconomy of families excites the interest of the son against his filial duty converts the brother into a  spy nay the marriagebed that last assylum of repose and tenderness it disturbs with perpetual apprehensions of discovery and separation  IT is a maxim Sir and a sound one that the strict execution of every unrepealed law is the part of clemency and wisdom How is this consistent with our policy The pledge of our security we are told is that these laws may be always put in execution the boast of our humanity is that they are seldom  executed For my part Sir I know little disference between the apprehension and the existence of a danger The worst of every evil is the fear I would rather be pierced at once to the Heart than have the sword of the tyrant for ever suspended over me  THERE is also Sir another maxim equally incontrovertible with the former That clemency ought rather to reside in a body of laws than in the private feeling of  any individual Our penal system against Popery is harsh and restrictive to the utmost extent of unsanguinary rigour It rises statute after statute and clause after clause to the consummation of legislative severity The unhappy objects of this code are sometimes obliged to the inadvertency sometimes to the indolence often to the humanity of their orthodox brethren but the letter and spirit of the edict are their deadly enemies and under this sanction interest or revenge caprice or  malignity may gorge and riot to the sating of every appetite  It is true Sir our market places don't as formerly blaze with the fires of martyrdom scaffolds do not reek with noble blood nor are gibbets loaded with human carcasses and as the bloody spirit of past times is spent so is the enthusiastic Bigotry the disease of weak minds and superstition the disgrace of true piety are now rarely to be found even in convents or in cloysters  though they abound in the annals of former ages but not in our experience nor amongst our contemporaries What is the complaint of churchmen all over Europe not that the laity are wedded to particular tenets and doctrines and are ready with unshaken constancy to commute the world for conscience but that Religion has lost it's strong grasp on the minds of all men and that decency or custom at best are become it's lukewarm substitutes The reason Sir is obvious The  pompous glare and pageantry of the Romish ritual were well calculated for the ages of ignorance and darkness when it had greatest prevalence Captivated by gawdy processions and allured by the enchantments of harmony the delusion of the senses was often mistaken for the conviction of the understanding and as it answered every purpose of a proud and ambitious hierarchy was long substituted for and made the test of devotion But these sacred sarces have been too often  exhibited the very externals of respect to these pious mummeries are now enforced by the secular authority nor can the supposed real presence of the Deity that most exalted mystery of their holy profanation extort a genuflexion till the fixed bayonet of the soldier commands the unwilling reverenceI myself have seen it  The amenability of our fellowsubjects of a different communion has been often urged in their favour  and has as often been overturned by the steady perseverance of their determined opponents Against a demeanour on their part loyal submissive and dutiful for now near an hundred years are produced two or three meagre examples of petulance and contumacy among the very refuse of their people Against a great principle of humanity and national policy are started a remote apprehension and a possible inconvenience and we are instructed to conclude that as terror not conviction has  wrought their submission and our safety it would be a species of virtual suicide to relax any thing of our former severity nay we should rather swell the massey volume of premunires amercements comminations and interdicts  But in my judgment Sir we frustrate all hopes of uniformity by mistaking the means of conversion The mild genius of toleration every day makes proselytes it heaps coals of fire on resistance and prejudice  and melts them down to acquiescence and conformity Persecution animates disobedience and multiplies the refractory Is the spirit of Popery weak and timorous Subdue it not with pains nor frighten it by penalties Is it acrimonious persevering vindictiveGive not rancour the eternal food of galling statutes and ignominious circumscriptions Take a link or two from the heavy iron load of these legal fetters and bind your fellowsubjects by the gentler ties of gratitude  and affectionIn what history of any country has it been found that persecution rooted out religious heresies or terrified men into the pale of establishment In none that I have read or heard of Nonconformists mingle peaceably and amicably with other members of whatever state they live in till the blast of intolerance drives them together Then they separate from the state then selfpreservation sets them on contrivance then they grow discontented and unhappy no wonder  they should become desperate and dangerousBut after all Sir 'tis not the mode of faith 'tis not the ceremonial of worship 'tis not the point of controversy 'tis the point of honour that resists your confiscations pains and penalties 'Tis not the disciple of Calvin nor the worshipper of saints and idols 'tis not the religionist but the MAN who kindles against menaces and dangers  OUR ancestors passed such laws because they were necessary Their  times required them That necessity is over those times are altered The Royal Succession and the religion of these countries is established beyond the power of subversion Our Sovereign reigns in the interests and in the hearts of his people while the destitute pretender to his right wanders from court to court the burden of every petty state and the outcast of every powerful The former adherents to his line wretched themselves and friendless scarce remember his name but by their afflictions and with a contemptuous  retrospect to his baffled projects for royalty Our Monarch gives laws to Europe kingly diadems have received stipends and subsidies from his bounty and his opulence while the house of Stuart can hardly obtain a subsistance from their charity What could not be effected when these principles were in their bloom and vigour when interest revenge capacity and power united in the quarrel and ranked under the same banners will it now be attempted when such claims are antiquated and such distinctions forgotten  WHEN the body of Jacobitism has long been laid quietly in the dust shall the wisdom of Parliament realize the fears of childhood and tremble at its apparition  No man Sir is more inclined than I am to pay all due deference to the wisdom of our forefathers and to the sanctity of prescription but never were laws of this nature framed without some tincture of the times they passed in Subsequent experience matures and mellows what was crude and undigested in earlier determinations We surely  Sir mistake our duty and relinquish one of the most valuable rights of Parliament if we suppose any antecedent law is too sacred for modern touch and that these especially like old medals will lose their value if the venerable rust of antiquity is rubbed off by the handling Can it Sir be a dangerous innovation to attempt the mitigation of laws which have had already all the effect and operation they were intended to produce Laws of which the acrimony only remains while the spirit  is evaporated Is it an instance of short sighted policy to attach three fourths of the community to the preservation of the whole When we have failed to induce them by principle to try what can be effected by interestTo make the country they inhabit dear to our fellow subjects by some more rational tye than the fortuitous circumstance of its being the place of their nativity Is it an unconstitutional endeavour to diffuse the blessings of a mild and beneficent government to every order and distinction of the people A  government the immunities of which become every day more precious in this country from the excellent character of that incomparable person into whose hands is delegated its executive authority Is it rash and unadvised to convert discontent into satisfaction poverty into opulence sloth into industry and indifference to the commonwealth into zeal for the general prosperity This Bill and every one of a similar tendency are so many steps  to such desireable purposes as such I hope we shall advance to meet it This Bill does not give to Papists the possession or the use of arms which may be wielded against the religion or the liberty of Protestants It does not invest them with the offices of state or with the powers of government It allows them no coercive authority over the conscience or the property of the reformed It only induces them by a permanent and valuable deposit to dispense that wealth they have earned by industry to the improvement  of a country where hitherto Sir they have sojourned but as strangers It gives them a freight in the general vessel to whose wreck or prosperity they were before indifferent It secures their cooperation by their partnership and grapples their allegiance by their interest
