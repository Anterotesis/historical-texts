possessed the  Jus Imaginum  the right of presenting to the public eye the portraits of their ancestors this institution far more sublime than the symbols of heraldry at once stimulated all ranks to virtue and prevented envy by reminding the people of the public services for which they were indebted to the ancestors of the great  It is hoped that the nobility and gentry in particular will encourage this work by communicating drawings from portraits of eminent men many of which may lurk in do∣mestic concealment Nor can it be necessary to remind them that the present expence is great and the future re∣muneration uncertain and that a work of this kind and devoted solely to the national glory when once abandoned is seldom or never resumed  PARLIAMENT  OF EDWARD I  ALEXANDER III  THE print prefixed is rather given as a curiosity than as presenting an accurate portrait of this monarch It is taken from a copy in the collection of the earl of Buchan from an ancient limning formerly in the Col∣lege of Arms London  Alexander III was born on the th of September He ascended the throne a minor not eight years of age th July on the death of his father Alexander II His life was distinguished by virtues his reign by wisdom and justice His accidental death on the th March left Scotland a prey to the ambition of the English monarch Edward I  Annals of Scotland by Sir David Dalrymple vol I  sub annis  The coronation of Edward took place on the th of August Alexander with his queen and many of his nobility assisted at the ceremony  Ibid  as did Llewellyn prince of Wales From the delineation here given it also appears that Alexander and Llewellyn sat in the house of peers in a parliament held as usual after the inauguration  This representation of the house of peers is curious and interesting The archbishops of Canterbury and York are seated somewhat lower than Alexander and Llewellyn the  two persons behind the latter are supposed to represent the pope's ambassadors he behind Alexander to bear the deed of homage for the lands possessed by that monarch in England The mitred abbots amount to nineteen while the bishops present are only eight the temporal peers twenty In the midst the chancellor and judges appear on their woolsacks  JAMES I  From Jonstoni Heroes Scotiae  portrait of James I of Scotland  JAMES I  THIS monarch was born in for he was in his fortyfourth year when he was slain in  Contin of Fordun II  In when he was about eleven years of age he was sent to France for his education by his father Ro∣bert III but was captured by the English on his voyage  Ibid Winton's Chronicle MS p who expressly dates this capture in and the death of Robert III a year after See also Ruddiman's notes on Buchanan I  and remained a prisoner in England for about nineteen years  This captivity was nevertheless attended with eminent advantages Nurtured in the school of adversity his mind eagerly imbibed the elegant arts and useful sciences and on the st of May  Contin of Fordun II  he ascended the throne of his fathers perhaps the most accomplished sovereign in Europe of his time  The regencies of Robert and Murdac dukes of Al∣bany had been fertile in public abuses and the dilapi∣dation of the royal lands and revenues which they had shared among the nobles in order to establish their own power exposed the new sovereign to a choice of difficulties His reign must be degraded by penury or rendered dan∣gerous by the arduous task of resuming the royal patri∣mony The spirit and genius of James preferred the latter alternative and after a long series of national dis∣order the sword of justice at length filled the hand of the monarch and flashed in the eyes of an usurping aristo∣cracy The most guilty of the public depredators fell  under the axe of the law neither rank nor even royal blood could save them from equal justice Terror for a time seized the peers and established tranquillity At length a conspiracy was formed and James perished un∣der the sword of an assassin on the night between the th and st of February  Contin of Fordun II Ruddiman's Buchanan I  In poetry in music in the learning of his age this prince was eminently skilled In the field of manly and martial exercise his management of the horse of the bow of the spear excited admiration his domestic hours were dedicated to elegant writing and miniature painting to mechanical arts and to the cultivation of the garden and the orchard  Contin of Fordun II c  He was short of stature and towards the end of his reign became very corpulent but his strength and agi∣lity remained unimpaired  Compare Contin of Fordun II with the Descriptio Asiae et Europae by Pope Pius II who had seen James in Scotland edit Paris vo p "Jacobus eo tempore regnabat qua∣dratus et multa pinguedine gravis qui cum olim in Anglia captus" c "His hair was auburn a colour between white and red" Drumm Hist p  The present portrait is taken in facsimile from that in the

Duke of Devonshire's possession  JAMES V  JAMES IV married Margaret of England daughter of Henry VII in August but many miscarriages and early deaths intervened before a vivacious fruit of their union appeared James V was born on the th of April  Epist Reg Scot M S in Bibl Reg B II  and in September when he was an in∣fant of a year and a half the sceptre fell upon his cradle after the unhappy battle of Flodden in which his father perished  John duke of Albany assumed the regency in May and held it with some intervals of absence in France until July when Margaret regained the supreme power In the following year she was constrained to share it with Beton the chancellor and Angus her hus∣band and in the latter usurped the sole autho∣rity  Lesley Buchanan Lindsay c  In the beginning of July James burst from the fetters of Angus in his seventeenth year and the first act of his power was the forfeiture and banishment of that peer his brothers friends and adherents After a short but active and just exercise of sovereignty he died on the th December a victim to the embarrassments of the time and his own high spirit His sceptre and misfortunes passed to the celebrated Mary his daughter an infant of a week old  Ibid  James V was a prince of no mean abilities and from the reign of James I genius and love of the arts were he∣reditary in the house of Stuart His subjects smiled at his vague amours while they admired his personal courage his strict administration of justice  Lesl Buchan xiv Lindsay  His persistance in the religion of his ancestors which was then that of the majority of the nation has excited the calumny of protes∣tant historians but time extinguishes party and revives candour The only apparent stain on his reign is the exe∣cution of lady Glamis the sister of Angus but that she was actually concerned in a plot of the house of Douglas against the king's life there is every room to believe from original papers which will soon be laid before the public His sternness to the nobles was more than compensated by the protection affability and generosity which he displayed to the people and every cottage exulted in his glorious epithet of KING OF THE POOR  Lesl ib  His person was of the middle size elegant and majes∣tic his face was oval his eyes blue  Oculi caesii ac illi quidem peracres Ibid  his hair yellow add an aquiline nose and the most striking features of the Stuarts from the accession of the family to the death of this soverēign will be delineated This portrait is from a drawing in lord Orford's possession taken from a contem∣porary painting in the collection of the duke of Devon∣shire  The resemblance accords with that given by Johnston in his Inscriptiones and in Drummond's history and with the gold coins Yet by a miracle of inaccuracy the late prints in Gu  hrie's history c have not a shadow of likeness  MARY OF GUISE  portrait of Mary of Guise queen of James V of Scotland  from a Painting in the Duke of Devonshire's po    MARY OF GUISE QUEEN OF JAMES V  MAGDALEN of France the first wife of James V having died in July in the seventh month af∣ter the marriage he in the subsequent year wedded Mary of Guise or Lorraine This lady was the daughter of Claude duke of Guise a branch of the house of Lorraine and widow of Louis duke of Longueville She arrived in Scotland on the th of June and the nuptials were immediately celebrated at St Andrew's  Lesley  During the life of her husband she appears to have taken no part in the political intrigues of a busy and important period On his death in Dec she was immersed in the disputes between cardinal Beton and Arran con∣cerning the regency and after the assassination of the for∣mer in she began to assume an active share in the government Instigated by the counsels of her brothers the duke of Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine she as∣pired to the regency which she at length obtained in April But amid the vehemence of the protestant and catholic parties her situation was exposed to numer∣ous difficulties and her death on the th of June may be partly imputed to their pressure  Robertson's Hist of Scotland I  An eminent historian has delineated her character with his usual ability He represents her as possessing the most eminent qualities discernment address intrepidity pru∣dence  gentle and humane without weakness zealous for her religion without bigotry a lover of justice without rigour Her sole foible was a devotion to France and the house of Guise natural and almost unavoidable but which became ruinous to her measures and to her politi∣cal reputation  Robertson I  Yet she shewed extreme lenity to the re∣formers and on her deathbed expressed to their chiefs with many tears her concern for any causes of dissention  Lesley  and even condescended to hear the pious advices of their teachers with reverence  Knox  Religious party and bigotry have now lost much of their force they perish but vir∣tue is eternal and Scotland may justly regard Mary of Guise as one of the most illustrious queens who ever shared the throne  Her beauty and the elegant gentleness of her manners are mentioned in general terms  Lesley  but amid the silence of historians and writers of memoirs her features may be best discerned from the portrait which is contained in the same picture with James V in the collection of the duke of Devonshire  JAMES II  from Jonston  Inscriptiones historice  JAMES II  THIS monarch ascended the Scotish throne in Fe∣bruary being only in the sixth year of his age  The historical materials of his reign are remarkably barren  The continuator of Fordun ends his work at the death of James I Hector Boyce the notorious fabulist is the only writer who details the reign of James II and his account is translated by Lindsay of Pittscottie and abridged by Lesley and Buchanan though it deserve very little credit being generally irreconcileable with the genuine fragments and records  His minority was chiefly rendered memorable by the contests between Crichton and Livingston and suc∣cessive earls of Douglas In James II espoused Mary of Gelder niece of Philip the Good duke of Bur∣gundy  The execution of William sixth earl of Douglas in the castle of Edinburgh had not quieted the rebel∣lious spirit of that great family and in James was in the effervescence of passion provoked to stab William the eighth earl of Douglas with his own hand in the castle of Stirling James the succeeding earl raised some commotions which were speedily appeased and the public tranquillity restored  But in the grand rebellion of the house of Douglas commenced which shook the Scotish throne and was suppressed with much difficulty In a forfeiture was led against the house of Douglas and the four brothers James it's chief the earls of Moray and Ormond and  lord Balveny were doomed to expiate by death or exile the vengeance of their offended monarch and country Yet in the course of a few years the branch of Angus suc∣ceeded to the exorbitant power of the stem Such stran∣gers were the monarchs to modern theoretic ideas of a design to subvert the aristocracy while in fact all they attempted was to withstand its incroachments when they became absolutely incompatible with royalty  On the d of August James II was accidentally slain by the bursting of a cannon while he was besieging Roxburgh  James II was a prince of eminent spirit and his mea∣sures were decisive even to violence The obscurity at∣tending his reign renders his private life little known His person according to a dry but veracious author was robust and a red stain which covered one side of his countenance gave rise to the vulgar epithet of James with the Fiery Face  John Major or Mair p Compare also the short chronicle in prose to the year at the end of Winton MS Reg D XX  This portrait is copied in facsimile from that in the Inscriptiones of Jonston  In Vol II of the Scotish Poets printed at Perth by the Morisons mo is an engraving of James II after a painting by Jameson at NewbottelAbbey the seat of the Marquis of Lothian The face has great resemblance to this but Jameson has bestowed a more brilliant and rather a more modern dress  Edward first lord Bruce of Kinloss  portrait of Edward Bruce first Lord Kinloss  b  o  Chap I  EDWARD BRUCE FIRST LORD KINLOSS  THIS statesman was the second son of Sir Edward Bruce of Blairhall and the progenitor of the earls of Elgin and Aylesbury He was bred to the law and displayed abilities which gained him the confidence of James VI who sent the earl of Mar and Bruce to con∣gratulate Elizabeth on the suppression of the insurrection by Essex in The subsequent correspondence be∣tween Bruce and Sir Robert Cecil operated greatly towards the peaceable accession of James to the English throne  On the d Feb James erected the dissolved abbey of Kinloss in Moray into a lordship in favour of this able negociator  Lord Kinloss attending his sovereign into England was further rewarded by the office of Master of the Rolls The patent is dated th July  This account is derived from Douglas's Peerage article  Elgin  See also Pennant's London and for the intercourse between Cecil and Bruce the "Secret Correspondence" Edin mo  And his epitaph mentions that he died on the th of January aged sixtytwo years  This figure is delineated from his monument in the Rolls

inscription commemorating the donation of that sum and of his library He lived in the reign of Charles I  Macure's Glasgow p  His translation of the scripture in such uncouth verse as to amount to burlesque has been often quot∣ed and the just fame of a benefactor to learning has been obscured by that cloud of miserable rimes Candour will smile at the foible but applaud the man  ISABEL OF SCOTLAND Duchess of Bretagne  portrait of Isabel of Scotland  from Lobincau Hist de Bretagne Original in the Cathedral of Vann  r  ISABEL OF SCOTLAND DUCHESS OF BRETAGNE  WAS the daughter of JAMES I and in July was affianced to Francis son of the Duke John V  Argentré in his History of Bretagne informs us that when the envoys of John returned from Scot∣land that Prince was eager to know their opinion of the lady They answered that she had beauty health and an elegant person but was very silent and apparently simple To which remark the Duke returned this celebrated reply "My dear friends I beg you will return to Scotland and bring her to me she is just such a wife as I desire for my son Knowledge does a woman more hurt than good upon my soul I shall have no other By the body of St Nicolas a woman is quite wife enough when she can distinguish her husband's shirt from his waistcoat"  The marriage was accordingly concluded but Isabel did not proceed to Bretagne till November and found her husband in the throne of that Duchy by the style of Francis I his father having died in August  In she was left a widow with two daughters Margaret who married Francis II Duke of Bretagne and Mary afterwards wife of the Viscount de Rohan  After refusing the Prince of Navarre and other offers of matrimony Isabel of Scotland died in an advanced age in  This account is derived from

who died in  Keith Bish  The Boyds of Pink∣hill and of Trochrig were descended from Adam Boyd third son of Alexander the second son of Ro∣bert lord Boyd the famous Chamberlain of Scotland in the minority of James III  Douglas Peer  The celebrated Mark Alexander Boyd was of the family of Pinkhill and first cousin to the pro∣fessor  See Biogr Brit art M A Boyd  Robert Boyd of Trochrig was professor of divinity at Saumur in France when he was invited by James VI to the office of principal of the university of Glas∣gow But not supporting the king's views in promot∣ing episcopacy he resigned and was then called by the city of Edinburgh to the same station in the uni∣versity there and found equal opposition from the court He therefore abandoned that charge and be∣came minister at Paisley He died in  Macure's Glasgow p  He wrote a commentary on the epistle to the Ephe∣sians and a poem called  Hecatombe Christiana  pre∣served in the  Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum  and dedicated to his relation Andrew Boyd bishop of Argyle a pre∣late eminent for his active virtues in reclaiming that barbaric see  The original painting is in the university of Glas∣gow  ALICIA STEWART  portrait of Alicia Stewart  from her Monument in the Sa  y  ALICIA STUART  OF this lady no more is known than what her epitaph bears that she was daughter of Simeon Stewart of Lakingheth in Suffolk and died on the th June  This Simeon Stewart seems the second son of Thomas Stewart of Mildenhall in Suffolk a family which displayed twenty quarters in their coat armorial Stewart of Bartonmills in Suffolk was another branch This family also extended to Norfolk and Cambridge shire and seven generations being in Elizabeth's time reckoned from their first ancestor's leaving Scotland that event must have happened in the Fourteenth century  Visitation of Suffolk temp Eliz MS Harl p  The portrait more properly belongs to the English series but the elegant simplicity and antique taste of the monument were thought worthy of being bet∣ter known and this branch of the Stuarts deserves commemoration in this work as it may tend to il∣lustrate the genealogical history of Scotland by pro∣moting further enquiries  An ingenious and respectable friend who has made collections for Suffolk says "My notes for Laken∣heath only mention an altartomb of grey marble for Simeon  Styward  In this monument and

the throne on the th March being in the fiftieth and fifth year of his age He died on the th of April His advanced years and an inflammation in his eyes prevented his personal appearance as an eminent actor in history but his reign was distinguished by the battle of Otterburn and other illustrious incidents  He was a just and beneficent Sovereign In per∣son he was tall and majestic but his countenance was disfigured by the inflammation of his eyes which Froissart says were distorted and red as sandal wood  Tome f  a defect which procured him the vulgar epithet of blear eye  This portrait from the Inscriptions of Jonston seems not much to be depended on the eyes are in∣deed distorted but the beard worn in that age is wanting The dress however accords with the  cos∣tume  David II appears with the robe fringed on the shoulders as here and the form of the bonnet repeatedly occurs in Montfaucon's prints  Strutt's Reg and Ecc Ant plate liii Montf Mon T iii pl  JAMES the First  portrait of James I of Scotland  from a Painting at Kielberg in S  bia  THIS portrait is taken from a painting at Kiel∣berg near Tubingen in Germany the seat of the Von Lytrums  The late learned Sir James Stuart Denham had in∣formed Lord Buchan that he had often seen at M Von Lytrum's a portrait full length of a Scotish king in a close jacket  the peaks of his shoes fastened to his girdle with chains of gold  that it was in a gallery with portraits of many other princes that an an∣cestor of M Von Lytrum being a great traveller had visited most courts in Europe and obtained those pictures of the  reigning  sovereigns  From his lordship's information  Lord Buchan in consequence applied to M Go∣gnel Chancellor to the Duke of Wirtemburg at Mont∣beliard for a copy of this piece which only came to hand half length as here though the remainder would have presented an instance of a singular fa∣shion mentioned by old English writers as beginning in the reign of Richard II but of which no other specimen is known in painting or miniature  The editor was led to suppose that this prince was James IV because the contemporary sovereigns were of his reign or soon after But he now inclines to infer James I from the following reasons  M Gognel named it the latter  The features cor∣respond so much with the fine portrait of James I  in Johnston's Inscriptions that the beard and more advanced years seem to form the only difference  The crown over the arms is too simple for the time of James IV that of James III having fleurons of quite a different height and richness  The hat re∣sembles that of Charles VII of France contemporary with James I in Mezeray  The jacket is not slashed There is in Montfaucon  Mon T iii pl  a portrait of Charles duke of Burgundy slain in in this very dress with the chain of the golden fleece but the jacket is slashed in strait lines and this fashion of slashing appears in the genuine portrait of James IV  The shoes with chains are so rare that it is probable they were only known in the latter part of the reign of Richard II and in that of Henry IV who died in when James I was twenty years of age and had been a captive for eight years Long peaks are common and appear in the statutes of Ed∣ward IV but no mention of chains occurs after the above period It is improbable that Von Lytrum should from such a distance visit Scotland but most likely that the portrait of James I was executed in England during his captivity and procured there by Von Lytrum who not being able to get that of the reigning monarch contented himself with another  ALEX ERSKINE  portrait of Alex Erskine  ALEXANDER ERSKINE PLENIPOTENTIARY FOR SWEDEN AT THE TREATY OF MUNSTER  THIS noted treaty took place in and there are fine prints of the meeting and of the different ambassadors from one of which the pre∣sent portrait is taken The painter was Van Hulle  In the military annals of Gustaf Adolf Erskine was an eminent character He was of the family of Er∣skine of Kirkbuddo in Fife sprung from the Erskines of Dun and was ennobled in Sweden Some of his descendants were not long since settled at Bonne in Germany  This information was obligingly communicated by lord Buchan  Further materials have not arisen  MARY  portrait of Mary Queen of Scots  from a Painting in Kensington Palace  MARY QUEEN OF SCOTLAND  THIS work is rather to be regarded as an account of portraits than of persons and concerning this prin∣cess in particular so much has been written that it is only necessary to state the chief dates in order to illustrate the portraits  In that splendid work the Heads of Illustrious Persons o  England Dr Birch has proceeded on a different plan But no one consults such books for biography and it had been better if he had authenticated and illustrated the portraits several of which are well known to be erro∣neous This last cause with the unwieldy size of superfluous ornaments for the portraits themselves might have appeared in vo may perhaps account for the abrupt termination of a work which the more ample it had proved the more honourable it had been to the nation No patriot would wish to confine the number of its illustrious or eminent persons  She was born on the th of Dec went to France in June was married to the Dauphin April in her sixteenth year queen of France June a widow Dec She came to Scotland August wedded Darnley July a widow Feb married Bothwell two months after fled to Eng∣land May beheaded Feb aged years and months after a captivity of nearly nineteen years the very term of that of James I of Scotland  The fictitious portraits of Mary are infinite In some of them she is confounded with Mary of Guise her mother with Mary queen of France sister of Henry VIII and even with Mary of Medici But any handsome woman is with the picture dealers Mary of Scotland The follow∣ing are the most authentic portraits  The Scotish silver coin of gives her bust at years of age the gold at The silver should be at There is it is believed at Holyroodhouse a portrait about pale  Cock of Antwerp in engraved a fine print three quarters in her seventeenth year Mr Harding's half length is faithfully copied from this print which the editor  has seen in the possession of Sir William Musgrave The small eyes and oval features occur in all the genuine por∣traits but this has not that rise in the middle of the nose which appears in the others Perhaps the engraver was careless or this feature was the product of more advanced years  Montfaucon Mon de la Mon Fr gives a curious small whole length of her leaning on a chair It is intended to be copied for this work  The portraits by Elstrack and a good modern profile by Stewart may be classed between her twentieth and thirtieth year The present undoubted portrait at Kensington seems of a later date  Portraits of Mary between her twentieth and thirtieth year are of all others the most uncommon  It has the marks of Charles I on the back both when prince and when king with this inscription "Of Jennet  Queen Marye of Scotland appointed by his Majesty for the cabinet roome By Jennet"  Charles I certainly knew the picture of his grandmother In the catalogue this piece is ascribed to  the younger  Jennet and is mentioned as a present of lord Danby It is a deli∣cate small picture the face is very pale perhaps by the fading of the painter's carnation Auburn hair black eyes  About the same age may be that in Johnston's Inscrip∣tions which if the drawing were somewhat mended would be a valuable portrait It is published fifteen years after her death  The tomb Westminster abbey gives a fine resemblance between thirty and forty Vertue's drawing in lord Orford's collection from lord Morton's picture and his fine print aet follow  From the account of her execution it appears that she was then fat and bloated There is a large print of her about this time apparently by De Leu with latin verses by a  G Cr Scotus  The face the same as De Leu's small one  WILLIAM FORBES  first Bishop of Edinburgh  WILLIAM FORBES FIRST BISHOP OF EDINBURGH  WHILE the English possessed Lothian for a short time in the seventh century there was a bishopric of Abercorn The province exposed to hostile inroads was afterwards ruled by the me∣tropolitan see of St Andrews which appointed an Archdeacon of Lothian till Charles I in created the bishopric of Edinburgh  William Forbes a native of Aberdeen and Prin∣cipal of the Marishal college there was nominated bishop on the th of January but he only survived his appointment about two months dying on the st of April that year He was succeeded by David Lindsay who was exposed to the fury of the populace on account of the new liturgy and was deposed in  Keith Bish  Of bishop Forbes Keith gives the following cha∣racter "A person he was endued most eminently with all christian virtues insomuch that a very worthy man Robert Burnet lord Crimond a judge of the session said of our prelate that he never saw him but he thought his heart was in heaven and that he was never alone with him but he felt within himself a commentary on those words of the Apostle  "Did not our hearts burn within us while he yet talked with us and opened to us the scriptures" During the time he was principal at Aberdeen he had interspersed several things among his academical prelections tending to create peace among the con∣tending parties of christianity some notes whereof were published above twenty years after his death under the title of  Considerationes Modestae et Pacifi∣cae  c"  Keith Bish  The book forms an vo volume replete with theological learning and its intentions are the more laudable because very uncommon But party ever in extremes is a stranger to reason and to all  Mo∣dest and Pacific Considerations  He who takes the mid∣dle open ground is only exposed to the fire of both armies Power admits of no compromise and when overcome receives no compromise because another power rules  SIR CONRAD RUTHVEN  from the Tabl  de Boye  SIR CONRAD RUTHVEN  OF this gentleman no memorials have yet arisen The portrait is given from the book mentioned below and the only information there to be found is that Sir Conrad was a Scotish gentleman and was surnamed the Red  Recueil d'Estampes d'aprés les tableaux de M Boyer d'Aguilles à Aix Paris folio The articles are arranged by the names of the painters No bears that John Bronchorst of Utrecht was born in and was yet living in that he was at first a painter on glass but became acquainted with Cornelis Polemburg and commenced painter in oil  Of the portrait we only have "Portrait de Conrad Ruten Gentil∣homme Ecossois surnommé le Roux" The inscription is  Conrardus Ruten ex Scotia Eques  And from the context it was painted by Bronkhorst  The inscription of the original print bears that he was a Scotish Knight He ap∣pears to have lived about and was perhaps of the Gowrie family  JAMES IV  portrait of James IV of Scotland  from a painting in the  of  at  JAMES IV  THIS magnanimous prince ascended the throne on the th of June aged sixteen and fell in the unhappy battle of Flodden th September in the fortieth and first year of his age and twentysixth of his reign which forms an epoch of the greatest prosperity to which Scotland ascended while a separate Power  A complete knight of chivalry generous magnifi∣cent a patron of the arts gentle affable just had his prudence equalled his other qualities he would have been one of the greatest of monarchs But his im∣petuosity of temper hurried him into two romantic and absurd wars with England in the latter of which himself and a great part of his nobility fell and the kingdom was left a prey to anarchy  Historians describe his person as of the middle size and elegant with a majestic countenance  Lesl Buch xiii  Many minute anecdotes of his dress c may be found in the contemporary account of his marriage with Margaret daughter of Henry VII published in the last edition of Leland's Collectanea  Vol IV App  The present curious and interesting portrait is from a painting in the possession of Mr Batsford at Fulham and which appears to have belonged to king Charles I as its former possessor asserted it had In the catalogue of that king's pictures p there is this article  "Item Beside the door the picture of king James IV of Scotland with a faulcon on his fist done after an ancient watercoloured piece half a figure so big as the life in a carved frame Length f Breadth f o Done by Daniel Mytens"  In that of the pictures of James II No is "James IV of Scot∣land half length with a hawk on his fist" apparently the same This piece was at Whitehall in both reigns and must have fallen into private hands after the fire in In the same collection two pictures of "  King James  with a hawk on his fist" are of James VI at five years of age as appears from MSS catalogues  The picture has been put on fresh canvas and reframed and the size now is feet inches by feet and one quarter of an inch a variation owing to the new frame not being so broad in the inner margin as the ancient This invaluable piece is in good preservation and Mytens who flourished in the reign of James I of England has shewn great talents in the execution The prototype was probably a painting in distemper in one of the Scotish palaces  Complexion fair eyes hazel hair deep chesnut Bonnet black ornament

PATRICK SCOUGAL  Bishop of Aberdeen  PATRICK SCOUGAL BISHOP OF ABERDEEN  WAS more memorable as the father of the author of "the Life of God in the Soul of Man" than from his own merits He was son of Sir John Scougal of Scougal and from the parson∣age of Salton in East Lothian was preferred to the see of Aberdeen in He was a pious and worthy man and died th February aged Bishop Burnet in the preface to his life of bishop Bedel gives a high character of the respectable prelate of Aberdeen  Keith Bish  His contemporary Scougal the painter was appa∣rently of the same family Betwixt Jameson and Scougal there seems a break in the Scotish list of painters Scotland indeed hardly produced a writer or artist during the commonwealth of England and even its annals of that period are obscure The History of Scotland under the com∣monwealth illustrated from original papers would form a curious and interesting work  JOHN EARL OF MAR Regent of Scotland  JOHN ERSKINE EARL OF MAR REGENT OF SCOTLAND  THIS truly illustrious character was third son of John twelfth lord Erskine and was edu∣cated to the church but the two elder brothers dying before their father he became thirteenth lord Erskine in Ten years after he regained the title and estates of Mar which had been unjustly wrested from the family by James II  Douglas Peer art Mar  On the birth of James VI in the royal babe was committed to the custody of the earl of Mar then governor of the castle of Stirling His candour and moderation became most conspicuous in the public distractions that followed and he was almost the only man who wished to preserve the inde∣pendence of his country alike unviolated either by French or English influence On the death of Len∣nox the earl of Mar was chosen Regent Sept in spite of the artifices of Elizabeth but he did not hold that high office much above a year dying on the th of Oct not without suspicions of poison a crime of which Elizabeth and Morton were not incapable His age is not com∣memorated but there is room to infer he was born about  His courage was conspicuous in his sally from Stir∣ling castle at the head of thirty men to repell the four hundred sent by Kirkaldy to surprize the peers and by his success in that unequal conflict His at∣tempts to conciliate all parties and to maintain the independence of his country against foreign influence evince the real patriot "He was perhaps the only person in the kingdom who could have enjoyed the office of Regent without envy and have kept it with∣out loss of reputation Notwithstanding their mutual animosities both factions acknowledged his views to be honourable and his integrity to be un∣corrupted"  Robertson II  The painting artist unknown is in the possession of James Erskine Esq of Alva Eyes dark blue and

Regent John earl of Mar and ancestor of the earl of Kelly was a distinguished character in the minority of James VI  Doug Peer art Mar and Kelly  After the death of the Regent the care of the education of that prince fell to Sir Alexander under whom Buchanan and Peter Young acted as chief preceptors In he favoured the party which op∣posed the infamous Morton the Regent who in re∣venge persuaded the young earl of Mar that his uncle intended to deprive him of the custody of the king and the government of Stirling castle The conse∣quence was that Mar seized the command of that fortress and expelled Sir Alexander  Robertson II  He was nevertheless in the same year appointed governor of the castle of Edinburgh and in vicechamberlain of Scotland He died before in which year his son Sir Thomas Erskine of Gogar appears he who killed Alexander Ruthven in the Gowrie conspiracy and was afterwards viscount Fen∣ton and earl of Kelly  Dougl art Kelly  The painting is in the possession of James Erskine Esq of Alva  JOHN ERSKINE EARL OR MAR L H Treasurer  from an original Painting in the possession of James Erskine Esq of  JOHN ERSKINE EARL OF MAR HIGH TREASURER OF SCOTLAND  WAS the only son of the Regent who died in In the king James VI en∣trusted to him the custody of his son and it is high∣ly to the honour of this illustrious family that the care of their minor sovereigns had been in a manner hereditary James V having been entrusted to lord Erskine by his mother Margaret and the parliament It was solely a special character of probity that pro∣duced those successive testimonies of high approba∣tion  This earl was joined with Bruce of Kinloss in con∣certing with Cecil the means of securing to James VI the accession to the English throne and he displayed much prudence in that grand transaction In he was made a knight of the garter On the death of prince Henry whose education he superintended he returned to Scotland In he was appointed lord High Treasurer of that kingdom an office which he resigned three years before his death which happened in  Dougl Peer and Crawf Off  By his first wife daughter of lord Drummond he left only one son John the stock of the family of Mar But his second wife lady Mary Stuart daugh∣ter  of Esme duke of Lennox bore him seven sons and four daughters The second of these sons is the ancestor of the Erskines earls of Buchan one of the others of the Erskines of Alva besides other il∣lustrious descendants  Douglas Peer  Nor has the family degene∣rated in hereditary probity and ability  The picture

was king of Scotland The fate of this dissipated weak and im∣prudent youth is too well known to need any recapitulation here He was murdered Feb in the twenty first year of his age  His brother Charles became earl of Lennox in on the death of his father He died in leaving issue Arabella Stuart The earldom revolved to his uncle the bishop of Caithness who four years after resigned it in favour of Esme created duke of Len∣nox his nephew in the noble line of Aubigny  Dougl art Lennox Stewart's Gen c  GEORGE JAMESON  portrait of George Jameson  from a lecture in the possession of  GEORGE JAMESON  THE Vandyke of Scotland was son of Andrew Jameson a builder and was born at Aberdeen in The portraits by him at Taymouth are said to have been executed before he studied in Flanders  So the late Lord Hailes thought but this opinion is very doubtful and the author of the Sketch of Painting in Scotland Weekly Magazine Vol XV Bee Vol XVIII asserts with great probability that Jameson re¦turned to Scotland in  and as one piece there is dated it would appear that he was advanced in years before he visited Ru∣bens He died at Edinburgh in aged and was buried in the GrayFriars churchyard  For some account of his works the reader may con∣sult the valuable "Anecdotes of Painting in England" nor is much additional information to be procured Dr Arthur Johnston in his Parerga Aberdeen addresses a small poem to Jameson instructing him how to paint the beautiful lady Ann Campbell One of his most curious paintings is at Cullen house het seat of the Earl of Finlater it is his own portrait sitting in his paintingroom the walls of which are hung with pictures probably such of his own as he most valued  Jameson is the first Scotish painter on record but eminent foreigners had visited Scotland and painted illustrious portraits The most curious assemblage of the kind is in the old gallery of the palace at Scone a huntingpiece in which James VI and his chief courtiers appear Alexander the scholar of Jameson married his daughter and Cosmo Alexander engraved a portrait of Jameson his great grandfather in The elder Scougal an imitator of Lely and Corrudes a foreigner appeared in Charles the Second's reign and were followed by De Wyck or De Wit and by  the younger Scougal To them succeeded Hude and Medina both foreigners and Wait and Aikman na∣tives  Sketch above quoted More ample information concerning the elder Alexander the Scougals Corrudes and Wait would be interesting They are unknown in the "Anecdotes of Painting"  This portrait of Jameson with a miniature of Isa∣bel Tosh his wife in his hand is taken from a picture by himself in the possession of another descendant Mr Carnegy townclerk of Aberdeen Hair and eyes black  JOHN LESLEY BISHOP OF ROSS  JOHN LESLEY BISHOP OF ROSS  IT appears that this prelate was the natural son of Gawin Lesley parson of Kingussie in Badenoch He was born th Sept In we find him at school in Moray in an  acolyte  in the cathe∣dral church of Aberdeen He is a canon of Aberdeen in and prebendary and official of that diocese eight years after  About he appears among the ecclesiastic lords of Session and in is commendator of the abbey of Lindoris and bishop of Ross  His attachment to Mary and his sufferings in her cause are well known Deprived of his preferments in his own country he was at last forced into exile and after various disappointments in France and Flan∣ders he died at Brussels st May aged  Keith's Bishops  It is no wonder that his active character has been blackened by party but a candid protestant must al∣low that Bishop Lesley acted with uniform principle As a writer his reputation ought also to stand in a su∣perior class for not to mention his works of contro∣versy and piety his History of Scotland from James III to his own time is executed with great informa∣tion and accuracy and is far superior in the real merits of history to the elegant but incorrect work of Buchanan The chronology and the preservation of important events and incidents are solely implied for both were partizans and this work estranged from party wishes not to pull a wreath from one character in order to bestow it on another but only to assign just applause where it is due  This portrait is from an original in the university of Aberdeen  KENSINGTON PICTURE  COMPARTMENT I  THIS exquisite painting is in complete preservation though executed as appears from the age of the prince ten or twelve about or Originally intended for an altarpiece it is in two divisions painted on both sides The first division contains on one side the king prince and St Andrew as here on the reverse is the trinity the father an old man with the dead Christ on his knees while the holy ghost is as usual typified by a dove The other division presents the queen and a saint apparently Canute the patron of Denmark and perhaps the features may be those of her father Christiern I the reverse bears the ecclesiastic and angels  The first compartment is rich in effect and it is hoped the copy will present an adequate idea of the original The king's gown is cloth of gold the robes of a lilac pur∣ple The lion of the arms is crowned and the tressure does not go round the top  It has been surmized that the saint might wear the fea∣tures of Shevis archbishop of St Andrews a favourite of James but the ecclesiastics did not then preserve their beards and the character of the face seems ideal  PICTURE AT KENSINGTON  Compartment II  KENSINGTON PICTURE  COMPARTMENT II  THE queen's headdress is singularly rich in gold pre∣cious stones and pearls The upper part of the kirtle or gown is cloth of gold the robe blue The arms of Denmark and Scotland are exactly blazoned the three united crowns for the united kingdoms of Denmark Sweden and Norway the three lions of Denmark lion and ax Norway the dragon for Slavonia the escutcheon of pretence is Holstein Sleswick Dithmarch Delmen∣horst surmounted by Oldenburg  The banner borne by the saint is the common cross of the crusades with the inscription AVE MARIA  It may allude to the arms of Gothland the holy lamb supporting a banner with the same cross as here See the Elzevir  Dania  His armour is a curious specimen of the platearmour of the times and a helmet appears in the preceding compartment a gauntlet hangs by the sword The ornament behind ap∣parently of oak leaves is singular but resembles that in one of the dresses of the order of the Knot or holy ghost in Montfaucon instituted in but afterwards dormant till revived by Henry III in the th century  Men of the Fr Mon pl cxviii English edition  Its mean∣ing here must be left to some future antiquary  PICTURE AT KENSINGTON  III  KENSINGTON PICTURE  COMPARTMENT III  IT is probable that this picture was painted for the royal chapel at Stirling founded by James III with much magnificence and that the ecclesiastic here kneeling was the dean of that chapel always the queen's confessor  Spottiswoode Rel Houses p He had also episcopal ju∣risdiction  three being no indication of superior dignity The arms three buckles and a cheveron can be traced to no family in Scotland except that of Bonkil in the Merse But perhaps the person may be Sir William Rogers the great English Musician the  Sir  being often applied to ecclesias∣tics or some other eminent foreigner  The angels in the original have little of ideal beauty and the unusual ornament of the coronet may denote the king's sister Mary first wedded to Thomas Boyd earl of Arran and afterwards to James lord Hamilton while the other may be Margaret not wedded to lord Crichton till  JAMES III  portrait of James III of Scotland  from Jonstom  ptiones  JAMES III  portrait of James III of Scotland  L  from the Picture at Kensmaton  JAMES III  THIS monarch ascended the throne on the th of August in the eighth year of his age and was slain after the civil conflict at Sauchy on the th June in the thirtysixth year of his age  His reign was distinguished by many memorable events the recapture of Roxburgh and Berwick and the acquisi∣tion of the Orkney islands by his marriage with the daugh∣ter of Denmark The chief stain on it is the murder of the earl of Mar youngest brother of James an incident the more singular as that king was averse from bloodand though all historical evidence infer the guilt yet the rebel∣lious peers eager to expose every fault of the government never impute this to their sovereign's charge If true James must have been infatuated by his love of astrology which predicted to him his death by one of his nearest kindredand Mar may not have been innocent of a con∣spiracy against his brother's life Certain it is that Albany the second brother aspired to the crown and termed James III a bastard  But the sovereignty of James was weak despotic and impolitic and his warm attachment to the arts forms the most pleasing part of his character His love of architec∣ture raised Cochran to the chief power in the state and Rogers the English musician was in high favour The fe∣rocious nobles despised what they esteemed the frivolous pursuits of the king and strangers to the arts could not estimate their value Of the patronage afforded by James III to foreign artists this noble painting may present no unfavourable specimen  Of the person of James III Drummond gives the best description "This king concerning his personage was of a stature somewhat higher than ordinary his hair was black his visage was rather long than round approaching in colour more to those in the southern than northern cli∣mates" This fallow complexion appears in the picture which besides corresponds so much with Drummond's deli∣neation that it may be borrowed from the painting And the complexion of James so different from that of the Stuart race in general may have had its weight in the calumnies of Albany especially considering the amorous propensity of Mary of Gelder his mother Eyes and hair black there is somewhat of melancholy in the face height∣ened in the original by a dark tinge even in the whites of the eyes  portrait of Margaret of Denmark Queen of James III of Scotland  MARGARET OF DENMARK QUEEN OF JAMES III  THIS lady was daughter of Christiern the first of that name and first king of Denmark of the house of Oldenburg She was married to James III in July being only in her thirteenth year and brought the perma∣nent dower of the Orkneys the superiority of which had remained with the court of Norway for six centuries  The Scotish historians are unanimous in applauding her person her virtues and piety  Ferrerius f Lesley c  An excellent wife an affectionate mother she adds the merit of being unknown in the political struggles of a turbulent period  Margaret of Denmark died in February aged only thirty one years and was buried at Cambuskenneth  Drummond  Whether she fell a prey to disease or to the continual agi∣tations occasioned by her husband's misrule is left in doubt by the barren historians of that age  JAMES VI  portrait of James VI of Scotland  from Jon  oni Inscriptiones  JAMES VI  THIS prince was born on the th of June and crowned on the th of July in the following year In he united the arms of England and Scot∣land and died on the th of March aged fifty nine  With the defect of a feeble character he had the high merit of being a pacific monarch a very little learning a very little knowledge being sufficient to shew the advan∣tages of peace over war both to the king and the people Even his short peaceful reign greatly advanced the trade agriculture and colonies of the kingdom and if by way of speculation we could imagine it prolonged to the present epoch the three realms would have been as one garden as another China in universal wealth and industry  In features particularly the nose James VI resembles his father Darnley more than the ancient Stuart line The singular stare of his eyes mentioned by contemporary au∣thors is more apparent in the portraits taken in more advanced years particularly a fine whole length at Wind∣for in which the face not a little resembles the vulgar sign of the Saracen's head  ANNE  portrait of Anne of Denmark Queen of James VI of Scotland  from Jonstons Inscriptiones  ANNE OF DENMARK QUEEN OF JAMES VI  WAS the daughter of Frederic II king of Denmark and Norway In October James proceeded himself in quest of his bride as his grandfather James V had set an example of this gallantry They were married in Denmark and Anne was crowned in the ensuing spring  She died in March  The character of Anne of Denmark was the reverse of that of her countrywoman Margaret wife of James III Amorous bold intriguing impressed with little reverence for her husband's spirit or abilities for government she was immersed in polities though her supreme cunning have veiled her from historical observation That in particular she had no small share in the Gowrie conspiracy may per∣haps be shewn by the editor in a short tract on that em∣broiled subject At present he shall only hint that the main actor Gowrie's brother was a paramour of Anne that she highly offended James by her continued favour to the for∣feited family that the earl of Gowrie himself appears to have been entirely innocent and that Anne's ambition might conspire with her lover's infatuation to imprison her husband and rival Elizabeth in female sovereignty Had the lover been a man of ability had not his mind been al∣most distracted with the weight of the enterprize another example might have been added to those in ancient and modern history of imperious queens who have imprisoned or murdered their husbands  HENRY SCOUGAL  THEOL PROF  Author of "The Life of God in the Soul of Man"  Original in the College Hall Aberdeen  HENRY SCOUGAL PROFESSOR OF DIVINITY AT ABERDEEN  WAS the son of Patrick Scougal bishop of Aberdeen and has the merit of being the first Scotish author it is believed who wrote a book of practi∣cal piety Ecclesiastical disputes so inconsistent with the meek spirit of christianity had first prevailed between the catholics and reformers then between the episcopals and presbyterians and afterwards between the presbyterians and independents Sermons and commentaries on scripture were sometimes interposed but the chief object the prac∣tice of the Christian virtues was unaccountably neglected Durham's curious work On Scandal being rather a discus∣sion of ecclesiastic discipline and polity and a defence of the presbyterians against the independent Jacobins of the day than an ethical production  Of Henry Scougal little is known It is said that being of an amorous complexion he sometimes loved God and sometimes loved women and that having unfortunately become enamoured of a married lady at Aberdeen he died in the struggles of virtue and passion But he had grown so corpulent in his retreat the steeple of the cathedral church of St Machan's at Old Aberdeen that his execu∣tors were forced to extract the body through a window These traditions seem rather inconsistent as love is gene∣rally supposed rather to belong to the class of consumptions than of dropsies and it is rare that the amorous swain pines away into plenitude  Scougal's Life of God in the soul of man was published by Bishop Burnet in vo and has since passed through many editions being a work of eminent piety without enthusiasm and written in a clear neat style  ALEXANDER HENDERSON  from a scar  Print by Hollar  ALEXANDER HENDERSON  THIS Franklin of the Scotish commotions in last century was minister at Leuchars and was in vain tempted with a bishopric He died in regretting the excess to which affairs were carried but never repent∣ing of his own moderate motives and actions as vainly repeated by his opponents a stale device of party  See Baillie's Letters vols vo  In fact the presbyterians after overturning the episcopal despotism of the time were gradually ruining their own cause by a despotism far more disguisting The saints at∣tempted to establish a clerical aristocracy not only over Scotland but over England and the civil power would have become the mere slave of ecclesiastic censure and excommunication Liberty of conscience was entirely de∣nied by the presbyterian party their church polity was a part of their creed and the penalty against any diffent was excommunication in this world and a liberal inheritance in hell fire hereafter A man's private life was to be tainted with saintship or hypocrisy and every pleasure was to va∣nish at the nod of those physicians of Sancho the governor The presbyterians supported the regal power as a shield against the independents and sectaries who with far supe∣rior political skill allowed universal liberty of conscience  But a nondescript saint named Cromwell put himself at the head of the independents and completely overthrew the presbyterian despotism Both parties appealed to King Christ and he decided in favour of the democratic church  In the sole choice left between the impertinent autho∣rity and degrading superstition of the presbyterians and  the power merely military of Cromwell it is no wonder that the nation sighed for the ancient monarchy a govern∣ment at least of gentlemen over gentlemen and more bene∣ficent to all than that of parsons or soldiers over slaves  Henderson's favourite polity and the clerical aristo∣cracy were after his death to be trampled under foot but be timously escaped from the evils to come One of the chief events of his life was the solemn conference with Charles I at Newcastle on various topics of religion and government the relation has been printed and does honour to both parties  PATRICK FORBES of CORSE and ONEIL Bishop of Aberdeen  Original Kings College Aberdeen  PATRICK FORBES BISHOP OF ABERDEEN  THIS learned prelate was descended of the ancient and noble family of Forbes  Pronounced  Forbis  not  Forbs  as in England  and was himself  baron  or  laird  of the estates of Corse and Oneil in Aberdeenshire Having received an excellent education and being attached to ecclesiastical studies he was often persuaded to take or∣ders but could not be prevailed on till the year when the minister of Keith having in a paroxysm of reli∣gious melancholy stabbed himself urged this as his dying request but the motive considering all the circumstances seems most inadequate to the effect  However this be Mr Forbes entered into ecclesiastic orders in his forty eighth year and was chosen bishop of Aberdeen six years after He died on the th March aged seventy one years and was interred in the south aile of the cathedral  In episcopal jurisdiction he was laudably rigid and used suddenly to visit the churches of his diocese on sundays that he might see the common method of the preachers and accommodate his instructions accordingly  He wrote a commentary on the Revelations printed by Elzevir to Some particulars concerning him may be found in the life of the yet more learned and cele∣brated John Forbes of Corse prefixed to his works Amst vols folio  Keith Bishops  SIR ROBERT DOUGLAS  SCOUNT

third son of Walter first Lord Blantyre  Stewarts House of Stuart p Douglas Peer  The chief ornament of the court of Charles II though rich in female charms she captivated the heart of that mo∣narch who finding all other hopes vain was meditating a divorce from Catherine of Portugal in order to espouse Miss Stuart when she unexpectedly wedded Charles Stuart Duke of Richmond and Lennox and Lord of Aubigny in France This peer had succeeded his cousin Esme in Au∣gust and dying at Elsineur in Dec without issue in him terminated the ancient race of Stuart of Len∣nox and Aubigny created dukes of Richmond in  Ibid  Charles II soon after gave the titles to his natural son by Louisa de Queroualle  In the exquisite Memoires de Grammont may be found numerous anecdotes relating to Miss Stuart To a person and face of wonderful excellence she united the simplicity of a child and when the king and his courtiers were occu∣pied in deep gaming she would sit building castles of cards while happy was the peer who assisted her in this amusement of a fool or a philosopher  This portrait is engraved from a painting of great merit by James Huysman a Flemish artist She is represented in the dress of a cavalier about the time of the civil wars a suit of buff or buffalohide adorned with blue ribbands The picture had belonged to James II being mentioned in  his catalogue as that of the Duchess of Richmond in man's apparel and is now in the gallery at Kensington  See Walpole's Aneedotes III  The likeness corresponds with that on her tomb in Henry the Seventh's chapel Westminsterabbey where her

Her marriage had been un∣happy the character of her husband afterwards the infa∣mous Louis XI being malignant to an inconceivable degree  Margaret was not only celebrated as a patroness of men of

Scotland  SEALS THE THREE FIRST PLATES  THE plan of this work as may be judged from the Prospectus entirely differs from those of Birch Per∣rault Hoffman or the like not being intended as a splendid publication of fine portraits but as a variegated assemblage of ancient portraits in particular represented without any improvement and in the just colours of the various sources whence they are taken Vertue in his heads of the English monarchs has sometimes been obliged to have recourse to seals and they at any rate shew the  costume  of the time and may sometimes serve to identify larger and more exact deli∣neations In the middle ages seals also present some of the best monuments of art and must supply the want of medals  The first plate contains those of David earl of Hun∣tingdon afterwards David I  The seals of Alex I David I and Malcom IV are all from the same dye and therefore omitted Those of Duncan and Edgar are already reengraved in Guthrie's History  and of Henry earl of Nor∣thumberland son of that monarch The first seal may be about A D the second There is also in Anderson's Diplomata a seal of David earl of Huntingdon brother of Malcom IV and son of Henry earl of Northum∣berland but as it varies little from the last it is omitted  The second plate contains those of William A D and Alexander II  The seals in the third plate are of Alexander III and John Baliol

Great This is from a charter dated in his ninth year Mr Astle in his late publication of Scotish seals gives another used by Robert I towards the close of his reigned In the same plate is that of David II son of Robert I who reigned from A D to  The second plate of this set contains that of Edward Baliol who twice usurped the throne during the reign of David II first for three months SeptDec and lastly for five years and that of Robert II the first of the house of Stuart  On the third plate the first in order of time is that of Euphemia Ross second wife but sole queen of Robert II The reverse only bears the arms of David Earl Palatine of Strathern her son who joins in the deed dated in which they agree with Alexander Murray of Drumsergath that he shall wed lady Jonet of Monymusk sister of the queen and be supported in his claim of inheriting some estate and that Walter Murray his brother may if he chuse marry the eldest daughter of the said Jonet This cu∣rious seal represents Euphemia clothed in the close kirtle and mantle of the times with a particular scepter alloted to the queens of Scotland in her hand The Gothic architecture is well delineated on her right hand are the arms of Scot∣land on her left those of Ross She appears to have died about  The next seal in order of time is that of Robert III The beard agrees better with the description  of his person given by the continuator of Fordun than the portrait in Johnson's  Inscriptiones  That at the top of the plate is of Robert duke of Albany Regent of Scotland The ducal coronet is of a singular form  All these plates are from that rare and highpriced work Anderson's Diplomata  The subject of the engravers of seals in the middle ages is obscure They were probably often Greeks from Con∣stantinople sometimes Italians and laterly Flemings  The seals of the four first Jameses are all from the same dyeand are besides unimportant as from James I the portraits of our monarchs are sufficiently identified In this case as in the former of Alex I David I and Malcom IV the first seal alone is entitled to any attention
