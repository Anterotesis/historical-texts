 RIMES  PINGO MIHI ET ARTI  LONDON PRINTED FOR CHARLES DILLY  M DCC LXXXI  ADVERTISEMENT  WHEN such of the ODES in this publication as extend to greater length were composed it was observed that whatever art might be used to diversify the cadence there was still somewhat wanting to the delight of the ear This defect was perceived to be chiefly owing to uniformity of stanza which protracted to any degree must ever fatigue as extinguishing the great source of all pleasure variety  To remedy this a particular series of stanzas was adopted in which the two first correspond and are succeeded by a third of as different a measure as might be This was thought to answer every intention proposed and appearing to present as per∣fect a succession of sounds as rime would admit was called by way of eminence MELODY  It was not till this plan was chosen after trying most modifications that rime could allow that it  was considered that the very model of Pindar was followed Such authority added to the author's confidence in the perfection of his method but de∣tracted much from the pride of invention by recal∣ling to his memory the real truth which was that he had only revived the ancient term MELOS  Mr Congreve has long since observed in his dis∣course on the Pindaric ode that the use of the STROPHE ANTISTROPHE and EPODE is obsolete and impertinent But such is the superstition for Antiquity that they are retained to this day tho' even their ancient use and origin cannot be ascer∣tained That as they are commonly used they confine the spirit of the greater modern Ode with∣out adding to its melody must be confessed Yet they must be retained because they give it regularity This is the only reason of most modern poets for retaining them They seldom appear to have ob∣served that in a long or grand production of the lyric kind the admission of a similar variety would contribute not a little to the riches of poetry  To have their full effect the Strophe Antistrophe and Epode or as they are here denominated the CADENCE ANTIPHONY and UNISON must have the property either of distinct harmony or brevity Every one must have observed that in the more ele∣gant  French and Italian odes there are two distinct parts in every stanza These like the parts of a Scots tune vary the measure and contribute exceed∣ingly to entertain the ear For example in this stanza of Malherbe  C'est en la paix que toutes choses  Succédent selon nos desirs  Comme au Printems naissent les roses  En la paix naissent les plaisirs  Elle met les pompes aux villes  Donne aux chams les moissons fertilles  Et de la majesté des loix  Appuyant les pouvoirs supremes  Fait demeurer les diademes  Fermes sur la teste des Rois  the first four lines are of a melody distinct from the six last This plan was well followed by Mr Gray in his odes on the Spring and Eton College And that he was very sensible of this beauty appears from his observation inserted among the Notes on Mr Mason's edition of his Poems "There is" says he  a  tout ensemble  of sound as well as of sense in poetical composition always necessary to its per∣fection What is gone before still dwells upon the ear and insensibly harmonizes with the pre∣sent line as in that succession of fleeting notes  which is called melody  So much for distinct∣ness of harmony as to brevity the other requisite its effect is obvious  From these observations the reader will expect that the author has paid a particular regard to his num∣bers He has so He always considered harmony as the chief perfection of the ode Music was in∣deed the first companion of lyric poetry and at this day who would not prefer a careless production of Dryden tho' void of every excellence but harmony to the most laboured of Cowley tho' rendered heavy with the very gold of fancy  To the Melodies in this Collection succeed ano∣ther species of lyric poetry here called SYMPHONIES By which name it is to be understood that the stanza is varied throughout as the subject seemed to de∣mand an answering mode  Dithyrambic Odes On Enthusiasm and To Laughter were likewise prepared but are not here given as there was no occasion to swell the Collec∣tion till the opinion of the public respecting its merit should be known  CONTENTS  MELODIES  I THE Education of the Muse Page  II To Pleasure Page  III The Temple of Liberty Page  IV To Science Page  V On the

MELODY I THE EDUCATION OF THE MUSE  CADENCE I  'THY infant form thou rosy fay  'May Beauty with each brighter charm array  'Thy mind each Virtue tend  'O fair O holy Lo my heavenly place  'I leave thy blessed birth to grace  'These airs of joy to lend'  So Harmony attuned her lyre  What day the lovely Muse was born  So Harmony attuned her lyre  So hailed the long expected morn  ANTIPHONY I  The rose that to the summer ray  But half her blushing beauties dares display  So sweetly never smiled  The jocund Spring when from her fragrant bed  She comes the genial Hours to lead  As Fancy's sacred child  When now the happy hand of Time  Gave every rising grace to view  The port of majesty sublime  Of love the eye the crimson hue  UNISON I  The mountain's front to tread  With solitary step to dally  Thro' each wild and haunted valley  Thro' each grove of sable shade  Were her delights There by some stream  She gathered flowers of every beam  The flowing honours of her head to crown  Or on a velvet bank at ease reclined  She caught the notes that by the vernal wind  Were from the wood in floating measures blown  CADENCE II  Taught by the warbling race of air  Her voice she tuned in sweetest descant clear  And new born ditties tried  With these the blessed the swains her early care  And Echo soon each willing fair  And scornful maid replied  All fears that chill and hopes that fire  The bosom of the faithful youth  The stolen treasures of desire  The ardent vow of endless truth  ANTIPHONY II  O happy age when known no toil  Save to obtain some haughty damsel's smile  And feed the fleecy flock  The fruits a feast of sprightly relish gave  With beverage from the orient wave  And honey from the rock  O happy age when shapes of light  Now shewn but to the mental eye  To dwell with man their radiant flight  Would hasten from the friendly sky  UNISON II  The mind untaught in vain  Her powers tho' blooming vigor nourish  Hopes in perfect pride to flourish  Culture must her might maintain  Soft and more soft ye breezes blow  More soft ye billows rise for lo  The tuneful Vision stems the azure tide  To Pleasure's Isle her destined course she bends  Her parent Fancy at the helm attends  And Harmony's smooth chimes each wild wind chide  CADENCE III  Now in her golden cradle lies  The infant Morn amid the varied dyes  Of every dewy flower  The lowly violet the sovereign rose  Around their mingled tints disclose  Their mingled fragrance pour  With purple lustre glows the deep  Resplendent to the orient ray  The comely band their progress keep  Exulting thro' the watry way  ANTIPHONY III  The Gales their gentle aid applied  Along the tide the painted galley hied  That spred a shining plain  And soon emergent from the western skies  They saw the verdant groves arise  That crowned the gay domain  A cloud of breathing incense sweet  To slumber soothed the ambient main  The merry mariners to meet  Shone on the strand a wanton train  UNISON III  To Pleasure's dome they came  With gold emblazoned and vermilion  Beamed abroad the bright pavilion  To the sun's meridian flame  There on a couch with fragrance spread  The Queen and young Desire were laid  Desire her mate and chosen solace dear  The Smiles and decent Graces stood around  The sovereign pair with perfect beauty crowned  With every gift of Love and laughing Chear  CADENCE IV  But chief the heavenly Fair excelled  The Muse with wondering gaze her state beheld  And thoughts of fond delight  Her blooming shape revealed in loose attire  Her azure eyes of amorous fire  Her locks of golden light  The Empress with a winning smile  To greet the welcome guests arose  'Be yours whate'er my hallowed isle  'To Art or lavish Nature owes'  ANTIPHONY IV  Tho' he of Thebes informed thy frame  Small praise O lyre his richest skill could claim  To paint that fairy scene  Where native May eternal empire held  O'er hill and shade and florid field  And balmy sky serene  Where rising slow with rapturous swell  Aerial strains were heard to stray  Like notes that from a master shell  In distant echoes spread away  UNISON IV  Here long the enamoured maid  All lost in dreams of dear delusion  Thro' the beauteous profusion  Led by bright eyed Rapture played  Exploring now the lawn's amel  Now happy groves of odorous smell  Now gardens trim with blooming fruits o'ergrown  And tuneful streams that living crystal flowed  And sunny hills with purple vines that glowed  Elysian bowers and cells grotesque and lone  CADENCE V  Nor barren of meet progeny  For Youth there dwelt and fair Felicity  And Health that sprightly maid  For Feast rejoiced amid the vines to rove  And Ease approved the still alcove  And Love the secret shade  O vanity of earthly joy  How early lost that better soil  When Justice sought her former sky  The deeps involved the magic isle  ANTIPHONY V  And now the charms of fair design  And elegance the Goddess can combine  With sweet simplicity  Her strains declared the cultivated mind  Awake to every bliss refined  Of grace and harmony  Yet wanted to complete her skill  Like science of the realm of woe  The sadder sympathy to feel  The sager sentiment to know  UNISON V  Ye blest abodes adieu  For now again the liquid azure  With bold prow the pilgrims measure  Seats of other clime to view  Bright be thy course thou star of eve  With purest splendor gild the wave  That trembles yet with gleams of fading day  Till slowly peering from her eastern bed  The perfect moon exalt her blessed head  And crown the level deep with silver ray  CADENCE VI  From mirth to sadness brief the road  And easy Ere the blush of morning glowed  They met the gloomy ground  Deep silence lulled each visionary vale  Save where the warbling nightingale  Her hidden recess found  Even from the solar blaze the land  Was dim with night of boundless woods  That sleeped along the lonely strand  And murmured o'er the sable floods  ANTIPHONY VI  Obscure amid a winding glade  Where darkest pines their chilling horrors spred  Arose a rocky cave  There Melancholy's modest form was seen  The pensive eye disclosed the Queen  And sad demeanour grave  With her was Wisdom reverend sage  His awful front his snowy hair  Expressed him of the train of Age  And versant in the storms of Care  UNISON VI  Of science much and truth  He spoke the flowery paths of error  That to snares of toil and terror  Lead the hapless soul they sooth  And oft their solemn talk between  A tale of tears would intervene  Oh heavenly Virgin what delights were thine  Now potent to controul the wondering heart  By every sympathy of magic Art  By Nature's force and Reason's light divine  MELODY II TO PLEASURE  CADENCE I  YE hymns that rule the Aeolian lyre  To Pleasure homage bear  The song O Queen inspire  And with indulgent audience own  If song thy grace or vows atone  Incline thy sovereign ear  From thy elysian throne  ANTIPHONY I  The throne thy parent Nature gave  What day her empire rose  Of chaos from the grave  Where reigns Desire thy chosen mate  The Smiles the Loves the Graces wait  And Music's airs disclose  The splendors of thy state  UNISON I  Thee Goddess thee adore  The great the wise the gay  All all thy blessed laws obey  All tho' by differing rites thy gracious aid implore  How enchanting the roseate smile of the Spring  When her Morning ascends on ambrosial wing  The winter dispelling and night  More enchanting Oh empress of every desire  Is thy smile to the soul when the shadows retire  Of sorrow before thy fair light  CADENCE II  In gilded domes let others try  With eager wishes vain  To win thy placid eye  Or sail to either Indian shore  To bribe thee with their gathered store  Thy source sincere nor Gain  May ever find nor Power  ANTIPHONY II  Thy present suppliant be lent  The balmy walks of Health  The fountains of Content  That life's small garden may divide  With chearful and with constant tide  So shall his days by stealth  In even tenor glide  UNISON II  Joy has its tears The reign  Of Rapture oft is found  To border on the hostile bound  Of cruel Agony and Horror's dark domain  He requires not in triumph to stem the wide deep  But along the safe shore his smooth progress to keep  With thee and Repose by his side  Nor rapid with transport nor silent with woe  Soft and pure let the gale of felicity blow  And Prudence each movement provide  MELODY III THE TEMPLE OF LIBERTY  CADENCE I  WHAT accents streaming from the solemn shell  Dilate their choral symphony  What songs of warbled extacy  O'er Albion's hoary mountains swell  And float along the sky  Oh Liberty thy natal day  To hymn awakes the festive lay  Amid the empyrean fires  Bend from their golden thrones thy sainted sires  As their loud harps to thee a thousand minstrels sway  ANTIPHONY I  With diamond inflamed and glowing gold  Emergent from the orient air  Thy consecrated courts appear  Where they whose hearts thy love controlled  Celestial raptures share  For ever bright with living green  Around elysian groves are seen  Young Spring from her ambrosial vase  Her silver dews and fragrant blooms displays  And all the Pleasures vie to grace the happy scene  UNISON I  Revive revive thou British lyre  Revive thy genuine fire  Thy genuine transports bestow  To deck each worshipped head  Let Fame her radiant chaplet braid  Her sonorous clarion blow  Conciliate their gallant bands  The Fathers of each rival realm  And hither oft in grace they send  The social sympathy to tend  The foes of Liberty to whelm  And o'er the favoured shores ordain  The glories of her reign  CADENCE II  While starry legions from the azure clime  Pour on the sight their blended rays  To whom shall Glory's altar blaze  To whom the golden sire of rhyme  The soaring anthem raise  To them the prime whose dauntless mind  The noble stand made by the ancient Britons against the progress of the Roman arms  The eagle of the east confined  Who as he sped his bloody path  Oft by the lightning of their rapid wrath  Shorn of his gaudy plumes fled screaming on the wind  ANTIPHONY II  Her rent sails fluttering o'er the stormy wave  State of the kingdom under king John when the barons obtained the Great Charter  Behold the publick prow obey  Each blast that wheels her boisterous way  No pilot from the rocks to save  Or to the port convey  To  sc Alcaei frag    Lo on the deck in warlike guise  The chosen mariners arise  New tackle binds each steady sail  Supreme in state she wooes the vernal gale  And every treacherous shoal and daring rock defies  UNISON II  The generous heir of Cambria's fame  Llewellyn the assertor of the liberty of Wales  Declare with loud acclaim  With strains of deep anguish deplore  Let equal accents wait  The rival of his hapless fate  The vaunt tower of the northern shore  Wallace the Brutus of Scotland    Lend the martial trumpet breath  Borne on that fiery courser view  By Valour led and Victory  The lord of Scotia's chivalry  King Robert Bruce    His march a fearless train ensue  Where'er they go the home bred Muse  Her rural incense strews  CADENCE III  From gloom escaped the rosy star of morn  Influence of the Reformation on liberty  Precedes the jocund hours of light  Ah dreary storms their splendor blight  Yet soon the rainbow's hues adorn  The horrors of the night  Dissolving each opposing cloud  The sun devolves his noonday flood  What scenes appear his blaze beneath  The crown refulgent thro' the shades of death  The sable scaffold dyed with dews of sovereign blood  ANTIPHONY III  He dies He dies the holy Anarch dies  Ye sons of Albion be free  Resounds the voice of Liberty  While nations gaze with wondering eyes  The fall of Tyranny  The happy flow of Glory's tide  The numbers of eminent men who distinguished the age of Crom∣well Milton's influence on their counsels See his Sonnets  Gay fleets with shouts of triumph ride  Stern chiefs their glittering banners wave  While sages teach each adverse blast to brave  Airs from the seraph shell their ardent labours guide  UNISON III  The crown of amaranth to blend  On wings of flame ascend  O Muse to the regions of day  Region de la luce e l'auree stelle Tasso Gier    Where living fountains bye  The flowrets of eternity  To breezes of harmony play  Nassau's mild front thou wreath entwine  Before whose matin radiance fled  The coward Wolf and left his prey  With grim despair His howling way  Fantastic Folly leads and Dread  While Scorn's deriding retinue  And Grief and Shame pursue  CADENCE IV  How art thou fallen from thy summer sky  Louis XIV whose ambition threatened the liberties of Europe till it was effectually extinguished by the Duke of Marlborough    Thou meteor whose lustre drear  Shot torments thro' the sickly air  Gave provinces to penury  And all the waste of war  Where'er thy deadly influence flowed  The thunder of the battle glowed  Mad Slaughter poured the rain of gore  The blasted plains and flaming cities o'er  And Famine and Despair and Desolation trod  ANTIPHONY IV  Till clad in Virtue's light the warrior rose  Decreed lost empires to redeem  The British lion followed him  And thro' the files of serried foes  Diffused the sanguine stream  His state a pomp of Graces led  As on the car of Fate conveyed  He held his victor way Around  Exulting monarchs grateful trophies crowned  And Liberty and Peace their sacred treasures spred  UNISON IV  High on the sunny mount of Power  To Fame's indulgent shower  The branches of Este  The House of Brunswick it is well known

MELODY IV TO SCIENCE  Menand  CADENCE I  SUN of the mind whose blessed beams exile  Of sullen Ignorance the gloomy power  With every phantom wild  That haunts his desert reign  ANTIPHONY I  Thee Teacher on the fabled marge of Nile  The sober Memory to Wisdom bore  There Fancy thee beguiled  With many a mystic strain  UNISON I  Where green Hymettus clad with thyme  Spreads fragrance thro' the Attic air  Thy holy form appeared  And oft in Latium's happy clime  From many a shade and grotto fair  Thy solemn voice was heard  Thy ample shrine ere Britain reared  Where Bacon soon his votive honours brought  And sagest Locke explored the maze of thought  CADENCE II  The radiant circuit of the stars to trace  The secrets of the earth and hoary main  The steady laws of Fate  My vows solicit

appears  What ghastly spectres wait around  The hapless birth to seize  The Passions tend his blooming years  The Cares his perfect age confound  His toils till Death release  The silent grave his only ease  Where never more alas he wakes to weep  But closes his brief day in endless sleep  CADENCE III  These ills to heal to bear impart thy skill  Tho' every passion every storm prepare  Yet thou thy blest ally  Can'st save celestial Guide  And lead to scenes where Fancy sports at will  So great thy power far from the realm of Care  Where Beauty Harmony  And pensive Ease reside  UNISON III  Since scant the source of pleasure flows  Instruct the fleeting stream to guide  To guide not to confine  With every little flower that blows  Around the variable tide  To deck life's sober shrine  For every purer joy is thine  By thee alone are all our cares redrest  True wisdom is the art of being blest  MELODY V ON THE MILITARY PREPARATIONS MDCCLXXIX  PRELUDE  THE kingly oaks whose lofty crest  The wrath of every storm defies  Of genial Spring the glad supplies  To guard their lustre crave  So they whom Honour's crown hath blest  Require the Muse's sacred rain  From Time from Envy's hateful train  Their ancient state to save  CADENCE I  When first the chiefs  Of Albion led  Their legions to the Gallic shore  The patriot flame  Informed each breast  That flame alas appears no more  Such is the baleful power  Corruption idol vile of thy destroying shower  ANTIPHONY I  O lasting shame  To every son  Of whom the gallant Edward led  When Cressy's field  Saw Conquest crown  With chaplet bright his helmed head  When wounded by Despair  The Gallic Genius fled and sought his native air  UNISON I  A breast of diamond serene and strong  Was thine of mighty sire thou mightier son  All regal merits did to thee belong  Chief of the sable mail that grace a throne  As from a storm the golden sun displays  His awful pomp in his meridian tower  O greater than thy fame such seemed thy power  When o'er the vales of Poitiers at thy blaze  The lilied legions fled with wild amaze  CADENCE II  Ye fays that rove  The moon loved mead  Where Seine extends his flowery stream  What wonder thrilled  Your little breasts  To see the British symbols beam  Along your haunted shore  Where seldom hostile foot had dared to pace before  ANTIPHONY II  For vain was art  For numbers vain  To stay heroic Henry's course  Witness ye plains  Of Azincour  Yet red with signals of his force  Nor force his sole renown  For gems of every virtue decked his warlike crown  UNISON II  And thou perfidious Spain yet darest engage  The sons of them who laid thy glory low  What time Eliza swayed her happier age  An age when valour still was vice's foe  With adverse sails tho' dark was all the main  Yet did the chiefs their steady honour hold  But Liberty to guard her favoured reign  With power invisible her foes controlled  And bad her own dread storms their pomp enfold  CADENCE III  When Cromwell steered  The golden helm  Of empire he unjustly won  Before his name  The Gallic king  Sat trembling on his painted throne  Nor less when from afar  The lord of Blenheim rolled the purple tide of war  ANTIPHONY III  Still still the fires  Of British fame  Beneath their silent embers live  They but demand  Some happy gale  Their ancient fervors to revive  Else whence of Wolfe the fate  That wild Canada's lakes and Albion's hills repeat  UNISON III  O then ye line of warlike sires awake  Ye British youth awake to ancient praise  Your souls let generous emulation take  To hide your fathers light with brighter rays  The wretched path of luxury forego  The wretched path that ever leads to shame  With patriot heat bid ever bosom glow  From Hazard's hand the wreath of Glory claim  True to your birth and to your country's fame  CLOSE  Thus hath the Muse with feeble skill  Her temple to Renown prepared  And many a solemn statue reared  The radiant space to crown  Blest did her power attend her will  Did Britons as they gaze aspire  To imitate the godlike choir  And make their praise their own  MELODY VI THE HARP OF OSSIAN  PRELUDE  THO' rich majestic Homer's lay  Tho' ages bend to Maro's sway  Supreme of Latian song  Yet Ossian mid the sainted train  Shall to thy harp of solemn strain  No second place belong  CADENCE  He fortunate whose eye  Could first thy beam espy  Glimmering thro' shades of solitary night  Whose hand blest lyre anew thy splendor could excite  O heaths of Morven and ye rocky isles  That dare the surges of the western main  Oft when mild Eve diffused her rosy smiles  The master soothed you with his mighty strain  Emergent from the chambers of the rain  While airy shapes with rapture heard the lays  As thro' the watry shore and desert plain  And shaggy caves obscure in winding maze  The wondering echoes spred the accents of their praise  ANTIPHONY  Of kings ye modern throng  Attend the moral song  Learn to be great ye only need be good  So Fingal's holy stem gods of their people stood  Like incense swelling from the sacred fire  Illustrious chief thy tuneful dictates flow  Able each breast with virtue to inspire  That wakes to human bliss or human woe  No more shall dull Oblivion rest thy foe  Thy ebon harp Fame in her shrine shall place  All worthy in the brightest rank to glow  No tinsel hues the simple frame deface  But gems and purest gold with orient lustre grace  UNISON  Envy in vain  Shall seek to dim the light of thy name  When the eagle from his rock  Descries the crows dark children of the wood  He degrades not his pride  By the base encounter  But rising in the blaze of noon  Leaves his foes in the regions of darkness  Such shall be thy praise  Thou Son of the Mighty  CLOSE  To hide the king of day  In vain the clouds display  Their shade  Soon as the king of day  Assumes meridian sway  They fade  MELODY VII ON THE PAINTING OF POESY  The art itself is nature  SHAKESP  CADENCE I  FAIR is the star whose golden light  Declares the coming day  Fair is the moon's serenest ray  That decks the realm of night  Of beauty and of life the sire  How fair O sun thy sovereign fire  Yet fairer to the mental

Her harp sweet Harmony prepares  And Fancy waves her magic wand  That lulls the soul in visions bland  UNISON I  In all her pride tho' beauteous Spring appear  Of brightest tint with many a gem  Yet can thy skill adorn her diadem  And with new music bless the ear  To Summer's train can added graces bring  And o'er her bower ethereal roses fling  To Autumn's field far richer stores impart  And teach even Winter's storms to sooth the heart  CADENCE II  Can Picture all thy living hues  Can all thy art attire  In equal pomp the fairy choir  That wait the pensive Muse  When all obedient to her spell  The fluttering idols crowd her cell  Succinct with eager speed to fill  The mandates of her mighty will  ANTIPHONY II  The sacred song o'er Virtue's path  The blooms of joy can spread  Then crown her pupil's favoured head  With Fame's immortal wreath  How many a clime how many an age  May Wisdom reap from Shakespeare's page  Led by his ethic scene to scan  The various heart of various man  UNISION II  Informed with being tho' the colours rise  Beneath the pencil's warmest power  Yet soon alas arrives the fatal hour  That banishes the fading dyes  But Night resuming her primeval sway  Shall ever hide the golden orb of day  Ere cease the wondering nations to inquire  Who Ilium sung Who tuned the Theban lyre  SYMPHONIES  SYMPHONIES  SYMPHONY I ON THE MUSIC OF POESY  QUEEN of the song O Muse thy parent dear  Bright Fancy thy sole guardian never rose  Tho' ever she precede thy wandering way  Fresh flowers to strew in wild profusion gay  To Harmony thy heart did still disclose  Like amity as oft thy raptured ear  With sweetest airs she charmed or solemn tones severe  The sonorous trump she blows that hill and dale  Resound with all their echoes At her call  The grizly war prepares his deadly storms  The lightning of the sword and fulgent arms  The thunder of the conflict and dire rain  Sanguine that deluges the boisterous field  Stern Slaughter and the horrid form of Death  Exert their terrors Anguish and Dismay  And Desolation Clad in steel and panoply  Exulting Valour waves his crimson crest  And shews the tide of battle where to roar  O'er the grim scene the Muse ascending sings  Sublime in glory and with golden light  Illumes the raging tempest as the sun  When thro' embattled clouds he pours the day  Gilding with richest blaze the dark of heaven  Far other when the rural pipe she plies  With flowing rills the flowing music vies  By simple huts and verdant vales she roves  Romantic bowers and visionary groves  Of love repeating much and love's disdain  The melting transport and the pleasing pain  The tragic lute to melancholy strains  Of deepest woe she wakes and wild despair  The frequent tear declares her ample rule  Silence that speaks unutterable thoughts  The eye aghast with terrors extacy  And all the sober family of sorrow  Laughter attends thee O Queen and the Jests with dim∣pled cheeks The Loves and Pleasures wave their golden locks wreathed with roses Ridicule mimics the uncouth gait of Humour while inspiring the merry flute thou visit∣est the comic walks of life instructing man what he ought to be by shewing him what he is  Alas what warbled sorrows meet the ear  What notes of anguish fill the sighing gale  When from thy solitary mansions drear  O Elegy is heard the plaintive tale  Of Grace and Worth envied by sullen Death  Of all the fading vanities of man  Joined with the weeping viol's softest breath  That vibrates to the heart each dying strain  Instinct with all thy living fire  What verse can paint thy power O lyre  As to the Muse's potent call  Thy spectres fill her airy hall  Like spectret swarming to the wizard's hall  T WARTON    Now to Mirth the lay devoting  And the florid tribe of joy  Dreams of fleeting bliss promoting  Wanton airs in mazes floating  All thy sacred art employ  In sable stole arrayed  Bedewed with falling tears  When awful Grief appears  Chill and slow  The melancholy measures flow  And pensive Pity lends her pious aid  To tend the mournful maid  'Hail thou form in shining cincture  'Clad of pure cerulean tincture  'Ever may thy pleasing ray  'With bland benignity  'Heal the indignity  'Of cruel Chance and Time's malignant sway'  Blyth Hope approves and to the warbled air  In many an antic maze leads her attendance fair  Oh Fear thou tyrant of the feeble mind  The languid line  That seems in sickly mood to pine  May ever move thy frantic influence blind  When Horror joins thy train  What phantoms fill the wizard plain  Stern ministers of Fate and guardians of his reign  Rich the richest praise above  Who can speak thy hymn O Love  What air of minstrelsy divine  Shall express  Thy power to bless  Shall thy varied rule define  Smite the deep shell with harshest hand  Rage in giant horrors clad  Rears aloft his ghastly head  Eyes that living lightnings glare  Frowning front and horrent hair  The grizly king declare  As in Fancy's shrine he takes his gloomy stand  Nor to the features sole of deepest shade  But every softer colour of the mind  Sweet Harmony attunes her magic power  So when the Morn dilates the dewey shower  The varying blooms a varying mirror find  Their lovely hues in lovelier light arrayed  With gleams of brightest beauty paint the glowing glade  SYMPHONY II THE DEFEAT OF THE OPERA  SHE said and smiled At Fancy's high command  Taste left the British strand  The Phantom to explore  On fair Ausonia's romantic shore  The shield of Truth he bore  But ere its potent virtue he unveiled  Thus with stern speech her leaden ear assailed  Daughter of Dulness from the happy fields  Of Albion I come and bear thy doom  No longer hope with tuneful sorcery  To witch the vulgar ear Fled is the time  When Superstition spread primeval night  O'er all the nations when sweet Poesy  Muttered her vigils from the cloystered cell  As by the moon's pale lamp the ruddy monk  And nun lascivious met with ardent vows  Saint Venus chief religion of their choir  Why then thou birth of that detested day  Should honour's robe vest thy fantastic state  Why still thy lying pride thy pride is great  The homage bear of many a dull domain  Declare the cause thou spectre speak and die  To him the Power but first an air was heard  Within her breast tho' dull her breast tho' dark  Revolving thoughts of seeming argument  Framed her reply I know thee and my fate  Yet ere thou seal my meditated fall  Attend my speech that wove with sighs and tears  Slow finds its mournful way  A faint imitation of some wonderfully affecting speeches in modern tragedies  On classic days  On classic days tho' fallen and critic tongues  Just is my rule and ancient When fair Greece  Nurtured each art of elegance the lyre  Aided the hero's sorrows From fair Greece  My regal forms arrayed in pomp and gold  That sing and singing in their glory move  This line from Milton The reader will observe several parodies of that Poet in this Production which as he is read by all required no mark    Derive their lineage That plea refused  For Nonsense as more old grows more deformed  Yet merit in my sons may move thy mind  Did not Quinault with sweetest ease devote  His sprightly verses to adorn my pomp  That Lulli with the soul of music gave  To flutter round the captivated heart  Of amorous damsels on the banks of Seine  Where chief

the funeral tale  Of kings that from the stroke of woe  The panoply of gold to shade  And serried guards could nought avail  Feebly the spoke with fading mien For Taste  Who suffers no appeal had now revealed  The shining orb of Truth that blasts anon  All false and empty with celestial light  Oblivion bore her to her silent cell  And dire shrieks rose from many an echo wild  ODES BOOK I  ODES

To sell his fury and his lies  Nor shall a feeble ship convey  His treasures o'er the watry way  While all his hopes and fears obey  The fickle wind's malignant sway  But crowned with peace and

hair  Released she to the sportive air  And soon confest in all her charms she stood  Amid the wanton eddies of the flood  Till satiate of the stream  She left the soothing joy  All on the velvet brim

hail  Nor smile that I this title owe  For from thy silent fountain flow  All streams that deck this desert vale  The hero's toil the patriot's care  And all the race of Labour fair  Where tend they save beneath thy sway  The evening of a boisterous day  To render to their weary lord  Blest to thy peaceful port to sail  And make his former woes a tale  To pleasure and to thee restored  And happy did thy wide command  Yet wider territories own  That every wretch whose restless hand  Spreads ruin thro' a blooming land  To gain a halter or a crown  From Industry's emotions free  Had been with Sleep or been with thee  Still where the blessed Muse is seen  Thy careless step will not be far  For with thee she delights to play  With thee she leaves the tainted reign  Of proud Ambition's evil star  And Wealth's tumultuary fray  She leaves their sad society  Where all the flowers Variety  In Pleasure's garden can disclose  Are blasted by Satiety  And Languor and Anxiety  Tho' banded guards in vain oppose  Their melancholy progress steal  To where the potent calls on Rest  And in his downy couch conceal  Their thorns that rend the feeble breast  With thee my visionary hours  Now trace

hoary majesty  The mazes of a river err  Low in the sullen heath afar  A silver lake's bright purity  Reflects the sapphire canopy  And distant music charms the ear  Sent from the woodland minstrelsy  Then to the villa's rural mound  Where Nature reigns by Splendor crowned  The florid garden's balmy scene  Amid whose shady alleys green  The tread of Science oft is seen  When Eve that lovely nun

holds his savage sway  Add fuel to the fading fire  Nor heed the storm's destructive ire  While Indolence governs the day  And laughs at Sorrow's evil train  Bring every sage of useful lore  Bring every bard of magic power  With living numbers to control  Each movement of the raptured soul  Bring mighty Ossian Homer old  The treasures of the Latian pair  The awful strain of Milton bold  And Tasso's wanton carol fair  Whose crown shall equal Spenser share  Bring father Shakespeare's native lay  And sly Fontaine and Moliere gay  Nor leave the lord of lyric fame  Grave Pindar nor the Teian son  Nor what the page of Sappho lone  Yet breathes of love's delusive flame  Be here the bards of latest days  Like planets who by borrow'd rays  Shine thro' the Muse's present night  With feeble yet with lovely light  The classic page of moral Gray  The portrait of the varied year  And Indolence thy castle dear  The vein of Akenside display  And his who decked the parrot's bier  Gresset    The tender scene of Hume be nigh  To wake the sympathetic sigh  Of Maffei and the Roman sire  Metastasio    Heir of the Attic art and sire  The chosen band let Fielding join  That minstrel sweet of skill divine  Each generous feeling to impart  And ope the fountains of the heart  And here the rival of his throne  Be Smollet Humour's genuine son  But why the countless stores relate  That Science to her votary lends  Even the vain pageants of her state  With joy keen Ridicule attends  Philosophers in Folly's tire  Who study much to be unwise  And bards who from their opiate lyre  Deal slumbers to the hearers eyes  O times when oft the torpid strain  The ghastly shades of Nonsense stain  While thro' the gloom false beauties tread  Like glowworms thro' the midnight mead  The genuine births of art how rare  And in their stead what shapes appear  Gay Tragedies in Grecian pall  Scenes that sleep and songs that brawl  Sad Comedies that teach to weep  With wit so thin and plot so deep  While Elegy with pulpit nod  Starts up a sable man of God  And Ode his sullen clerk below  Hums the rueful ditty slow  With tinsel prankt his tattered suit  And flowrets innocent of fruit  What joys are thine queen of my song  The voice of Music Painting's hand  All arts confess thy soft command  Their treasures all to thee belong  O ever let me live with thee  From care and toil and sorrow free  And when the Muse partakes the day  Brief be the magic of her sway  Ah far remove the hated praise  Of many foliovolumed lays  Be mine to build the slender RIME  That haply down the stream of time  With tuneful oar and spangled sail  May move to Fame's indulgent gale  Yet yet dread Power O ere confest  Thy influence now invades my breast  Yet hear me Ah in vain * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

not vain my song  Behold even mitred Dulness try and fall  How Taste did tremble as he marched along  By Rashness led and drest in Folly's pall  Styl praising faults and styl to beauties blind  Because those equal these surpass his mind  Ne let sweet Spenser move thy ruthless power  His feasts of fancy are no feasts for thee  Ne awful Milton fro his blissful bower  Frown thy detested arrogance to see  Ah spare them Spare thyself I thee entreat  Soar not like Icarus to find thy fate  Did not that man of every darksome spell  Stupendous Bentley waste his work and oil  Each blemish

That paints the honours of thy reign  She comes She comes Behold the maid  With wheaten crown and saffron vesture  Adorned but more with matron gesture  And charms that need not Art's vain aid  All hail thou queen of plenty hail  Thine are the treasures of the vale  That life and health to all afford  Best bounties of the social board  Thine is the orchards blushing hoard  With balm and various nectar stored  Thine is the Morn so fresh and gay  That from her opal tower displays  Her crimson banner's wavy blaze  While from the west the moon's wan ray  Lends all the dewey landscape bright  A double shade a double light  Here gilded with the matin beam  There with the meek moon's silver gleam  Thine when o'er every dusky mead  The grey Mist spreads her silent sway  That opening to the gold of day  The trees their pearly spangles shed  And smiling thro' the twilight scene  Reveal their robes of glittering green  When Noon in thy full splendor clad  As now roams o'er each mountain head  No fever burns the vital air  But thro' the sprightly azure clear  Each Gale of vivid vigor strays  And sports amid the tempered rays  O hour when Milton sage of song  Immerst in bliss of lofty thought  Would wander thy shorn fields along  Then turn with sacred treasures fraught  Say heavenly Muse for thou wast there  What seraph forms his soul did chear  His darkling steps by thee when led  Pensive amid the noon day glade  He heard celestial music breathe  'Above about or underneath  'Sent by some spirit to mortals good  'Or the unseen genius of the wood'  Thine is the Eve so blyth and

the ardors of the lyre  That raise the mind on wings of fire  Or tunes to softer charms serene  How vain our fleeting state that show  How vain all Fortune can bestow  How vain our bliss how vain our woe  When thy mild Morn and chearful Noon  Sweet Season hold their radiant throne  Be mine the breezy ocean shore  Or sunny field or mountain high  Of widest view of clearest sky  Thy varied riches to explore  When gleaming through a vermil cloud  The twilight star reveals his beam  Be mine the walk with trees embowed  The lonely heath the plaintive stream  Till shining from her southern bower  Thy

 Now o'er your heights now thro' your wilds  Now by your mossy marge  No longer shall I see her laid  Your banks along  No longer meet her in the glade  No longer wooe the willing maid  With rural pipe or song  Ah might ye as ye cite the lay  An equal vein inspire  Your varied graces should portray  The offspring of the lyre  With Nature's genuine wealth o'ergrown  From gaudy splendor free  Tho' here and there a flower bestrown  While Fancy's ray with gold should crown  The stream of harmony  To recompense the joys recluse  That in your reign she found  In Fame's fair shrine the grateful Muse  Should paint your classic ground  Your rills should thro' the mimic plain  Desporting stray  Your songsters warble in the strain  Your groves their vernal pomp maintain  Where Winter bears no sway  Still echo to my pensive ear  The breezes of the dawn  That wont new life and bliss to bear  Along your dewy lawn  Where rosy Health delights to dwell  And wooe the western Gale  That scatters o'er her rustic cell  With liberal wing each balmy smell  That scents the heathy vale  Sweet Goddess thee my languid soul  On rising pinions borne  Shall with the warbling lark extol  At early breath of Morn  When Noon from his meridian tower  Extends his ray  My steps shall seek thy pleasing power  Where by some green enwoven bower  The cooling waters play  Nor when the parting sigh of Eve  Pants o'er the twilight mead  Shall thy enamoured votary leave  Thy ample paths to tread  Without thee what is life A dream  In sloth immerst and pain  At thy command Oh queen supreme  Youth opes her pure ambrosial stream  And tunes the frame again  Round thee the laughing Pleasures still  Their purple plumes display  And from their nectared urns distil  The blooming sweets of May  Stout Vigour dimpled Smiles and Play  That antic boy  Still trace thy flowery sprinkled way  With Beauty Wit and Fancy gay  And Love and Peace and Joy  Ah happy did he know his state  He who of thee possest  Enjoys the riches safe from Fate  The riches of the breast  Him not the costly halls of Pride  In pageant splendor drest  Shall win with Languor to reside  The great while gilded mansions hide  The cot oft shields the blest  But where beside a sunny hill  That stems the Eastern wrath  The mazes of some nameless rill  Pursue their lonely path  Concealed amid the winding glade  From vulgar eyes  Where groves in sable gloom arrayed  Their venerable refuge spread  His lowly shed shall rise  Far from the plodding arts of Care  Far from the city's coil  Where Business plants his mazy snare  And Strife contends with Guile  From Superstition's bigot ire  And Pomp's tyrannic frown  From Avarice's low desire  And Luxury's seducing fire  And Fashion's fickle throne  There meek Content has reared her

Truth  Governed the willing throng  And there the infant Muse to sooth  The plaint of Age and toil of Youth  First poured the sprightly song  The Naiads held in wizard care  The music of each flood  And silver footed Dryads fair  Paced thro' each haunted wood  The Graces to the favoured reed  Of some young swain  The mazes of their measures led  Where fragrant Flora's purfled brede  Still decked

great  Ambition Fraud and lawless Strife  And Avarice and Wrong are rife  As in the domes of state  Favoured of heaven is he the man  Who monarch of his mind  Each hope and fear in reason's chain  With equal rule can bind  No change of Fortune's varying clime  Finds his recess  No dart of Fate or theft of Time  The tenor of his thought sublime  Can change or happiness  The happiness in every

knowing and the good  The poet and the sage  All hail ye fathers of each theme  That chears our evil doom  That warms the soul with fancy's beam  Or wisdom's vital bloom  While seeming good and real ill  Divide our day  The fair enchantments of your skill  The stormy shades with light can fill  And smooth our dreary way  Still let me hear your sapient lore  Your sweetest raptures prove  As I your

sweetest shame  Provokes the praise it dreads  The ready blush that warms thy cheek  When on thee darts the raptured eye  With eager gazeThou musest why  Shunning the fame thy peers so seek  O Modesty where art thou flown  The fair's diviner grace and boast  To Albion art thou ever lost  Thy meek attendance ever gone  Sincerity devoid of guile  And timid Innocence  The cordial glance the winning smile  The comely pride of Sense  Yet thou O Rose of May disdain  Be heard the Muses prayer  To join vain Folly's fickle train  Tho' clad in Fashion's glare  Partake so may some favoured youth  The blameless pleasures of thy life  And all your care and all your strife  Be who more love shall shew and truth  ODE IV TO THE LARK  HERALD blyth of Morn thy strain  Grateful audience invites  Lo to tend thy matin rites  Break I Sleep's bewitching chain  Now the park's amel I tread  Brushing from each waking flower  Spangles of the dewy shower  Eve with genial hands has spread  And now with heedless steps I stray  Along the woodland glade  And meditate my musing way  Thro' brake and warbling shade  Of new mown hay the grateful steam  Now rises on the gale  And chequed with many a shadowy gleam  Wide waves the grassy dale  Till the upland heath I gain  Where in russet amice drest  Twilight walks the odorous waste  Till day leave the eastern main  O'er the azure wave behold  Where his burning galley sails  See the laughing sky he scales  Clouds of crimson thro' and gold  How pure the breath of heaven descends  What prospects rise around  From where yon western vale extends  With groves and hamlets crowned  To yonder city's towery pride  That glitters in the sun  And where the Bass's dusky side  Yon erring vessels shun  Winding slow with easy sweep  See the princely Forth pursue  By green plains and mountains blue  His bright progress to the deep  Wreaths of smoke the hut forsake  Faintly sounds the distant mill  Far beside yon northern hill  Dimly shines a silver lake  Ever sweet minstrel may thy song  My due attendance gain  For to thy hour all charms belong  Of Morn's enchanting reign  Here on the dawning heath to greet  Thy kindred extacy  O ever may my willing

who prompts the idle lay  Let every Muse her poeans pay  Let fays and elves with gamesome glee  Trip o'er the green in measured maze  And each exalt the song of praise  O Vanity to thee  Thou Goddess from thy limbo boon  Thy old grotesque abode  Glide thro' the still nights shadowy noon  And bring thy magic rod  To charm to life the Ionic lyre  And sprightly flowing strains inspire  That lapt in visionary joy  Nor Fortune's wave nor Envy's blast  Nor present pain nor pleasure past  May ever breed annoy  And lo the minstrel fays advance  In robes of glossy green  While the elves lead on the mazy dance  Those strike the harp between  Thy birth O Vanity they sing  How Fancy on the day of Spring  Went forth to hail the rosy morn  And cull each dewy spangled flower  Around the fragrance of her bower  Her tresses to adorn  Till wandering in the vocal vale  Amid enchanted ground  Where gamboled every laughing Gale  With blooming odors crowned  To Error's cave her steps were led  Where Selflove on his downy bed  Dissolves his cares in soft repose  And lulled by Sloth's oblivious strain  He never shares another's pain  Nor in his rapture glows  Soon as the radiance of the maid  Approached the secret bower  Amazement from his sleepy shade  Arouzed the torpid Power  He gazed her ruby tinctured cheek  Her liquid eyes her bosom sleek  Surprize controled her rising scorn  Compressed her in his warm embrace  Time smiling urged his rapid race  And Vanity was born  Now all arrayed in rainbow hues  She strays along the green  Tracing with speed the roseate dews  To glad the village scene  Where the airy swain and buxom maid  Dance in the woodbine woven shade  Flaunting the coolly fragrant air  His foppish arts to steal her love  Her coy disdain her blushes prove  That Vanity is there  Thence to the courtly fair she flies  Love sporting in her train  Aids the smooth tongue and sparkling eyes  To flatter and to feign  To every charm gives brighter grace  Inspires the snowy vermil face  With softer languish sweeter fire  And teaches each delusive art  To fan or kindle in the heart  The flame of fond desire  Nor to the fair alone confined  Nor to the glittering hour  Even the benign enlightened mind  Oft feels thy magic power  But ah all such bless with thy hate  Suffice the gay the modern great  Thy light fantastic rod obey  The spleeny sage the vacant clown  The slaves of Pride of Pleasure own  Thy soul deluding sway  ODE VI TO A RIVULET  CHILD of the hill whose lucid wave  Ensues its solitary way  Thro' sedge thro' heath by rocky cave

brown with shade here bright with day  As in this valley's sheltered mound  Unnumbered flowers of fairest ray  Bend o'er thy mossy bound  Primrose pale and violet blue  Slender pinks of snowy hue  And rosiers of richest steam  And hyacinths in the watry gleam  Their mingled radiance view  While of these flowers a wreath I twine  To deck thy silver flight attend  Attend while down the stream divine  Of music fancy's flowers I send  Grateful as I am to thee  Fair Fount by whose windings free  Oft I trod when Morn arose  And oft at dusky evenclose  To meet dear Poesy  The lordly Flood whose ample sway  Guards empires oft with angry sweep  Rolls Plenty's liberal stores away  To the remorseless deep  Other far thy gentle reign  That with verdure clothes the plain  Nourishes each drooping flower  And laves the herds at noontide hour  And feeds the golden grain  Like thee O may my day still flow  Thro' Solitude's sequestred vale  Where Pleasure's secret flowrets blow  Remote from Fortune's rude assail  Yonder towers the steep that crown  Fear each storm's destroying frown  To the hidden hut beneath  That rises o'er thy humble path  Nor fear nor storm is known  Might the fond Muse recall the days  When faith and fancy were allied  Still should the yellowskirted fays  Sport on thy level side  When the moon admires her face  Mid thy silver quivering glass  Lune qui as ta robbe en rayons estoilee  Garde ceste fontaine aux jours les plus ardans  Defen la pour jamais de chaud et de gelee  Remply la de rosee et te mire dedans  RONSARD    Never should thy bright career  Or Summer's sultry beam severe  Or Winter's rage deface  ODE VII  From the Italian of Vincenzo Gravina  Di Vincenzo Gravina Giurisconsulto Egloghe VI MS pen Aut dated The verses which are here thrown into the form of a

l'ardente voglie  Ma 'l forte laccio mai non si discioglie  Se con eterno chiodo  Fissa gl'affetti grazia e cortesia  Urania overo del giro celeste Eg II  FEEBLE the bond that Beauty twines  If sweet Goodnature her mild aid denies  For swift as Time the power of Beauty flies  While Gentleness more brightly shines  As Time its latent force refines  And friendship with desire combines  ODE VIII

Castelloza  OH author of my chief desire  What joy shall fill my ardent breast  If when I sing thy fame  Thou but to humble faith aspire  In me and me alone still blest  And dead to other flame  I

fools the secret soul who spies  Their ignorance they only blame  Who blame my bliss divine  They never saw thee with my eyes  What hour thy wishes met my aim  And bent thee to be mine  My dreams still paint thee in my arms  But soon and leave me lost in woe  The rapturous visions fly  Oh come and bless me with thy charms  Or if thy heart no pity know  Oh come and see me die  ODE XIII  From

Orme advanced his dauntless shield  Since victors on the bank we stood  Of Ifa's stream that foamed with blood  O might my friends my fate but hear  Attendant foes my ghost should chear  No female drops should stain my doom  Blood blood alone should deck my tomb  ODE XV THE VALE OF WOE  After the Gaelic manner  HEARD ye not the raven scream  Saw ye not the sable stream  Heard ye not the bleak wind blow  Adown the vale of woe  Low in the glade beneath yon oak  That trembles o'er the gloomy rock  Where he who held her heart is laid  Behold the mourning maid  The lovely star of dewy eve  Is brilliant on the western wave  And thro' her wild locks as they stray  Reveals his golden ray  Rouzed by the solemn breathing sound  The meek roe starts and gazes round  As slowly wafts the lonely gale  Her lamentable wail  'Oh why oh why can death destroy  'The balmy blooms of opening joy  'Oh why the wished rest delay  'Of those who hate the day  'With morn awakes my sole desire  'No more to view her dreary fire  'But parting with that dying light  'To sleep in endless night  'Where now our scenes of fleeting bliss  'The winning smile the rapturous kiss  'The sighs from heart to heart

'The lovelorn plaint the hopeless tear  'Why cannot Grief the living slay  'Or move the silent clay  Hark deeper sighs the distant wood  Hark deeper sighs the rueful flood  A blue beam glimmers o'er the heath  And liquid accents breathe  'Sweet is the quiet of the grave  'No fears confound no hopes deceive  'But pleasures pure without desire  'The sunny mind inspire  'Cease cease thy fruitless sorrow Still  'New joys our kindred souls shall fill  'For love the mortal frame survives  'And with the happy lives'  ODE XVI THE GHOST OF AZO  In the style of the Provenzal Heroic Romanze  'STRIKE

life's rosy spring  On his arm of might reclined  Winding in his pensive mind  His deeds of grace and deeds of hate  The awful power of Rodolph sate  His knights and minions all around  Fondly quaffed the extatic sound  Nor heard the approaching peal of fate  The lamps burn blue' pale Oric cried  And threw his glittering harp aside  The glittering harp with dismal breath  It was an old superstition that on the eve of any calamity the musical instruments gave a melancholy sound  Wailed to the leaden hand of Death  'Ha No bidden guest art thou'  The potent screamed with frantic brow  Mien of fear

dreams of transport soothed her youthful breast  When Shakespear led her to the impassioned scene  She hoped no more till in her Milton blest  Who strength and beauty gave her to convene  In heavenly arms and heavenly splendor drest  She rose a cherub thro' the blue serene  SONNET II  TRUE she was fair as Fancy's fairest child  True much her thought excelled her early years  True nameless grace in every gesture smiled  True she was good above her gentlest peers  Yet cease my soul O be no more beguiled  Yet cease to dream her bright form still appears  Yet cease to dream her voice still charms my ears  Yet cease to paint her sweet demeanor mild  For why The sod is green that clothes her grave  Oh would to heaven that grave me rather knew  From sighs or tears no ease can sorrow have  From sighs or tears can no relief accrue  And is she gone beyond all power to save  Then Death thou only can'st give respite due  SONNET III TO HOPE  AS in the winding road of life we stray  With scenes of joy beset and scenes of care  Wisdom may guide but cannot deck our way  Her chosen mandate ever was 'Beware'  Her beams but tend our dangers to display  And warn our lingering step from Pleasure's snare  Like the sepulchral Lamp whose dismal glare  But serves with sights of sorrow to affray  Yet Hope dear Goddess thy enchanting sway  Awakes the soul to other objects fair  O ever let thy favourable ray  Exile the fatal shadows of Despair  To thy bright paradise my mind convey  And prospects large of future bliss declare  SONNET IV TO SLEEP  From the Italian of Bernardo Tasso  The father of Torquato As the originals of this and the sollowing sonnet are not common they are subjoined  QUEST ombra the giammai non vide it sole  Qual or a mezzo il  iel miro ogni cosa  Da it  o  i rami d'un mirteto ascosa  Colletto pien di calta e di viole  Dov' un garrulo rio si lagna e dole  Con l'onda chiara che non tien ascos  L'arena piu ch'una purpurea rosa  Lucido vetro e trasparente suole  Un povero pastor ch' altro non ave  Ti sacra O bello dio della quiete  Dolce riposo dell' inferme menti  Se col tuo sonno e tranquille e soave  Gli chiuderai quest' ochi egri e dolenti  Che non veggon mai case allegre o liete  SACRI superbi avventurosi e cari  Marmi che il piu bel Tosco in voi chiudete  E le sacre osse e'l cener santo avete  Cui non fu dopo chio sappio pari  Poiche m'e tolto preziosi e chiari  Arabi odor di che voi degni sete  Quanto altri mai con man pietofi e liete  Versarmi intorno e cingovi d' altari  Deh non schivate almen ch'umile e pio  A voi quanto piu so divoto inchini  Lo cor che come puo v'onora e cole  Cosi spargendo al ciel gigli e viole  Prego Damone e i bei colli vicini  Sonar povero e'l don ricco il desio  THIS shade that never saw the sun's bright beam  Tho' sent from his meridian mansion high  Where verdant myrtles rear their state supreme  O'er flowers of richest smell and richest dye  Thro' violet banks devolves a warbling stream  That shows each lucid pebble to the eye  As thro' the crystal we the rose descry  Not hid but shining with more radiant gleam  A pensive swain nought else he can bestow  With reverend honour consecrates to thee  O Sleep from whom sole ease the wretched find  Here then let all thy blessed influence flow  From Sorrow's chain his captive fancy free  And sooth with lenient dreams his weary mind  SONNET V THE TOMB OF PETRARCH  From the Italian of Benedetto Varchi  YE venerable marbles that inclose  The reliques of the lord of Tuscan song  To whom in ages past no equal rose  Nor shall I deem all future bards among  For that to me the blessed powers expose  No gift that to his worth might well belong  No part of rich Arabia's fragrant throng  Of herbs or gums my worship to disclose  Despise not ye that modest tho' of skill  To you my reverential vows I scan  So spoke the swain as with the Spring's best bloom  Of odorous flowers he strewed the honoured tomb  While thro' the circling hills soft voices ran  'Tho' poor thy gift O shepherd rich thy will'  THE END
