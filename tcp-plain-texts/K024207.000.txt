slaves detains  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains  With hairy springes we the birds betray  Slight lines of hair surprize the finny prey  Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare  And beauty draws us with a single hair  POPE'S  Rape of the Lock  LONDON Printed for the Author and sold by him at No CrossCourt BowStreet CoventGarden where may be had all his other publications at the

Two Wives Or Wigs for Ever A DRAMATICK FABLE  Enter Husband  SONG  Husb  WAS ever man so plagued as I  It almost makes me sob and cry  Two wives I have and can't please either  With black and grey hairs can please neither  One wishes that my hair were black  Whilst t'other but I fear alack  'Tis but pretence prefers the grey  To please both 'would I knew the way  If I had only one wife old  Tho' she perchance might be a scold  My grey hairs could not sure displease her  Nor my infirmities much teaze her  Or had I but one wife tho' young  And pert and flippant were her tongue  She surely would not find goodlack  Fault with my hairs for being black  Was ever man c  To please both 'would I knew the way  Enter  Old Wife  RECITATIVE Accompanied  Old Wife  Where is my husbandmine and Bett's  That he's half her's ofttimes sorely frets  But I'm his first wife and the elder  Tho' younger Ma'am has  Hans in Kelder  Oh here he is and now I'll try  To make him throw his black hairs by  DUETT  Husb  Ah ha my old spousy yet not the less dear  How little I thought you to me were so near  What news my dear chuck from the market or bath  I must go there myself I'm as thin as a lath  Old Wife  To the bath you may go but 'twill do you no good  While that bush of black hair remains under your hood  For health's sake let me that deformity crop  You ne'er will be well till that lumber you lop  Husb  Well do as you please my old spousy pray do  Your will is a law that I still buckle to  Old Wife  Come into next room then and if I have luck  Each black from the grey hairs I'll presently pluck  Both  Come into c  Husb  And if  youyou'll  c  Exeunt  Enter  Young Wife  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  Yg Wife  What can have become of my husband I wonder  With his old wife I guess were he younglightning thunder  How I'd rattle his ears nay his joints all his senses  But since of a husband nought's left but pretences  I'll cheer myself some way be it only to teaze him  For who can expect I should e'er wish to please him  Not a grey hair I'll suffer upon his old pate  But pluck them all out or no more be his mate  SONG  What folly I wonder induced me to wed  A greybeard who scarcely can crawl to his bed  And I young gay lively and sightly  Alas silly I  I almost could cry  Sure I merit a husband more sprightly  And yet on reflection it near makes me laugh  Of him tho' so old I have only one half  That's sure being stinted too tightly  Conceited dull log  You mere household clog  Two wives are not manag'd so lightly  Enter  Husband  SONG  Husb  Well now I think I look as should  Each man that's past Life's middle  For black hairs sure no wise man would  That can't dance to a fiddle  Now I and my old spouse well match  For she's grey as a badger  But hold should young Ma'am now me catch  New pluck'd how should I fadge her  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  Yg Wife  Oh here is the old boy well now for some fun  My humour I'll follow thus briskly begun  Why goodness what's here you lately were pyebald  But your black hairs are gone and now you are nighbald  Hush  Dear young wife be gentle I've lost all my black hairs  I dare not tell how and now I much lack hairs  Have pity then Darling upon poor old grey  And to him of comfort a word or two say  Yg Wife  To comfort my husband as should ev'ry wife  I always am ready each hour of my life  But sure my dear Hubby will do what he can  To prove himself loving as though a young man  Consign these grey hairs then unto my direction  And if you'll but patient endure the dissection  In less than five minutes I vow and declare  Upon your smooth pate shan't be seen a grey hair  SONG  With a snip of my scissars  Each white hair I'll mow  Or a twitch of my tweezers  No more shall they grow  For who would be link'd to a greyhead  As well in the grave one might lay head  Not I on my life  I'll no longer be wife  To one who sepate's cover'd with snow  Then quick let me mow it  And no longer show it  It shames me wherever I go  Oh who would be link'd to a greyhead  DUETT  Husb  What ever you please love so you be but happy  I do as she wills tho' I think I am sappy  Young Wife  Do just as I please love and you will be happy  To thwart a young wife would you know be quite sappy  Both  Do just as I please love c  What ever you please love c  Exeunt  Enter at the opposite side the  Old Wife  SONG  Old Wife  Well now I'm contented my husband and I  Look like one another as pigs in a sty  His grey hairs and mine now exactly agree  And no more he'll prefer young Eliza to me  Take example ye old wives and all of ye pull  Each black hair ye my find on your spouse's pied scull  A pretty condition before I was in  Why did I not sooner this practice begin  Our heads the fame liv'ry now properly wear  For on his white cranium there's not a black hair  Take example ye old wives and all of ye pull  Each black hair ye may find on your spouse's pied scull  Enter  Husband and Young Wife  RECITATIVE Accompanied  Husb  Oh dear oh dear how cold's my head  My nightcap fetch I'll go to bed  Old Wife  Why how now husband what's the matter  Young Wife  Why how now ma'am why all this clatter  Of all his black hairs you first stript him  I only of his grey bereft him  So between both bald meek and mild  He proves "an old man's twice a child"  Husb  Cease your taunting each at other  Or at me pray cease this pother  And say how I may quick escape  The shame of this my baldpate rape  AIR  Young Wife  To Britain strait send if you hence would look big  For one of their scullcaps I think called a wig  Old Wife  To Britain pray send if you hence would look big  For one of their scullcaps she says call'd a wig  Husb  To Britain I'll send that I hence may look big  For one of their scullcaps I know call'd a wig  SONG  Husb  The men only wore wigs but now with the ladies  I've heard that the best of the wigmaker's trade is  The redhair'd turn black and the grizzle grow flaxen  The colour they change as they please of their caxon  All ranks now appear in the newfashion'd rig there  And no female's a beauty who wears not a wig there  Then I'll think it no shame to conceal my bald pate dears  With curls that hung over some Blouzalind's great ears  Since damsels of fifteen throw off as they scorn'd 'em  The beautiful locks with which Nature adorn'd 'em  And frizzled wigs wear as in public they dash on  Pray why should not old men too follow the fashion  And since in the valley of years I'm declining  At what can't be help'd in the stead of repining  I'll sport each new whimsy in pantaloons strut too  To my throat a huge poultice I'll presently put too  Whilst with two such kind wives if I've any luck dears  I think when new wigg'd I shall be quite a buck dears  FINALE  Old Wife  When your hand shall be in my dear husband pray send  For a wig for me also 'twill serve this good end  That I shall no more be thought aged alack  And instead of grey hairs a wig get me coalblack  Young Wife  Same trouble will serve for three wigs as for two  Let me tho' I want it not have a wig too  My hair is quite flaxen to what shall it change  Why a lovely brunette which will not be so strange  Husb  Agreed my dear wives we will all three be wigg'd  And in the new fashion compleatly soon rigg'd  No colour of hair shall our union dissever  And in harmony henceforth we'll sing Wigs for Ever  CHORUS  No colour of hair shall our union dissever  And in harmony henceforth we'll sing Wigs for Ever  EPILOGUESONG  By Mrs HARLOWE  The Poet  Spenser  sweetly sang  Of  Rosalinda's  charms  Her diamond eyes her ruby lips  Her white and taper arms  When he described fly  Cupid's  web  Wove with her golden hair  All other Aethiops seem'd to Rose  She fairest of the fair  When  Shakspeare  drew the maid he lov'd  In rustic  Phoebe  veil'd  Her bugle eyeballs cheek of cream  Anne Hathaway  conceal'd  Arch  Cupid's  net in her was framed  Of glossy black silk hair  To him brunette was bright as gold  She fairest of the fair  But had they all existed now  The males had felt sad shocks  Had  Rosalinda's  golden curls  Anne Hathaway's  black locks  As 'twere by magick sudden chang'd  Gold blackblack golden hair  Would they have thought them monsters or  Each fairest of the fair  Mere monsters doubtless would have seem'd  The changelings in their eyes  Nor black or yellow turn'd the skin  Have caus'd more griev'd surprise  Be warn'd then females when you dress  Whate'er your toil or care  Forsake not stature she will shew  You fairest of the fair  FINIS  N B The Epilogue being too long for performance the third and fourth stanzas were compressed into the folâˆ£lowing one  But had they all existed now  And  Anna's  Anna  The reader who has any
