magazines and other periodical publications and if by selecting them together the author should contribute towards the entertainment of the public as well as to the lady he was in duty bound to oblige he will think the pains he has taken amply rewarded though at the same time he hopes the candid reader will not forget the following remark that  A slender poet must have time to grow  To spread and flourish as his brothers do  Who still looks leansure with ill fate is curst  But no man can be FALSTAFF fat at first  DRYDEN  {inverted ⁂} Notwithstanding that part of the title of this book  viz  "The Shrubs of Parnassus" is borrowed from Mr WOTY the author thinks it necessary to observe that not a single line is taken or imitated from that gentleman's worksHe hears there is a small pamplet in

noblest work of GOD POPE  I  GIVE ear O ye swains to my lay  Since COLIN alas is no more  Let's languish and pine all the day  In sorrow his loss to deplore  For he was the pride of the plain  The garden the grove and the field  But "lost is the PASTORAL strain"  Since he no more beauties can yield  II  Ye warblers that bill on each spray  Ye lambkins that ramble alone  Come round and attend to the lay  Then "bleat and your master bemoan"  For a tend'r good shepherd was he  So true and so kind to his trust  With mildness he liv'd and with glee  A picture of all that was just  III  His manner how soft and serene  Tranquillity dwelt in his air  No mortal like him e'er was seen  No mortal with him could compare  For he was so gentle and kind  That birds cluster'd round in a throng  And all in full harmony join'd  Whenever he echo'd his song  IV  But COLIN from us far borne  No longer he sings thro' the grove  No longer beneath the gay thorn  Mr CUNNINGHAN used frequently to lay about in the fields under a hedge or a tree in which situation he wrote several pastorals  He pours forth his sonnets of love  Then farewel O favourite bard  Adieu my dear COLIN adieu  Thy merit I e'er shall regard  To thy fame I will ever be true  SONG  I  THAT little rogue Cupid I vow  Is playing such tricks with my heart  I flutterI cannot tell how  Yet feel the sharp pangs of his dart  What cruel ungenerous swain  Could send this fond urchin to me  Whose heart was a stranger to pain  And e'er rov'd as free as a bee  II  But now my poor senses are gone  My spirits are fled from me quite  And I'm a poor maiden forlorn  No rest can I take day or night  How happy ah once sure was I  So chearful I 'rose in the morn  But now am addicted to sigh  For him that I treated with scorn  III  Young CORYDON must be the swain  None like him appears to my view  He caught my fond heart on the plain  Ah shepherd I'm wretched for you  O come then dear youth and be kind  No longer disdainful I'll be  But harbour content in my mind  And think upon no one but thee  SONG  I  COME haste thee my PHILLIS I pray  And let us repair to the grove  Where nightingale's chearful and gay  All tune their sweet accent of love  So soft is the sound of their song  'Twill surely delight you my fair  Then haste thee dear charmer along  And strait to the grove let's repair  II  For something I have to impart  That labours quite hard in my breast  So ardent and firm is the smart  It robs me of peace and of rest  'Tis love that dear passion I swear  By all that is honest and true  And thou art the source of my care  I sigh and I languish for you  III  Then come dearest PHILLIS I pray  And ease all your DORILAND'S pain  Ah let him be joyful and gay  Nor longer implore you in vain  But let honest freedom invite  For virtue's the path I pursue  And may happiness ev'r unite  With those that are constant and true  THE HAPPY SHEPHERD  I  HOW happy a Shepherd am I  with LAURA the pride of my heart  I'll never once languish or sigh  For know she has cu  'd all my smart  She vows that she will be my wife  By all that is honest and fair  Then I'll be her husband for life  And never know sorrow nor care  II  Brother shepherds that toil on the plain  By me take example I pray  Throw off all your sorrow and pain  And ever be chearful and gay  Then nymphs that are modest and shy  For once hear young DAMON'S advice  The reason I tell you for why  As happy you'll be in a trice  III  Give each of your hands to your swain  Then drive away faction and strife  Bid adieu to all anguish and pain  And be happy th' rest of your life  Such is DAMON'S advice my kind fair  Then take it most freely I pray  So fly from all sorrow and care  Henceforward be merry and gay  THE HAPPY SHEPHERDESS  I  SINCE JOCKEY of late is so kind  My poor panting heart is at rest  Such peace and contentment I find  No maiden's so happy and blest  For sweetly my days pass away  With joy I attend on my sheep  And though they should happen to stray  I'll never once offer to weep  II  Such bliss do I find from my swain  For he is so bonny and gay  He meets me each night on the plain  And calls me the flower of MAY  He took me last week to the fair  And gave me a topknot beside  Then kis'd me and call'd me his care  And vow'd that I should be his bride  III  Then tell me ye maidens I pray  How can I my JOCKEY deny  Who chearfully sings thro' the day  And charms me whenever he's nigh  On the banks of the soft flowing TWEED  Whenever we happen to meet  So pleasing he plays on his reed  No shepherd like JOCKEY'S so sweet  DAMON AND DOLLY  A SONG  I  ONE Midsummer morn as I stray'd thro' the grove  Young DOLLY I met by the way  I told her her charms had subdu'd me with love  And caus'd her a while for to stay  II  Silly DAMON she cry'd what would you be at  Your fooling give over I pray  For all your fond wooing your cooing and chat  No longer shall make me delay  III  Then I press'd her hand close saying Can you deny  A favour so trifling as this  But still she rejected and cry'd out Oh fye  When I stole unperceiv'd a sweet kiss  IV  With rapture I gaz'd on her delicate charms  For I could not resist it I vow  Then clasping her eagerly in my fond arms  Said she I must go to my cow  V  Then strait o'er the plain together we went  'Till come to cool river's side  Where we sat ourselves down till I gain'd her consent  For ever to be my true bride  VI  Adieu then ye troubles and plagues of this life  With DOLLY I sure shall be blest  Kind Providence means for to make her my wife  And lull all our cares into rest  THE SORROWFUL SHEPHERD  In imitation of  SHENSTONE  written at sixteen years old  I  AH whither alas shall I fly  What clime shall I seek for relief  Since PHILLIS no longer is nigh  O how shall I smother my grief  The sweetest the fairest is she  So neatly she trips o'er the plain  But now she ne'er smiles upon me  She's faithlessand false to her swain  II  With STREPHON she's gone far away  With him is contented and blest  Whilst I am distracted all day  And ruin'd for want of my rest  No heed can I take of my sheep  They ramble and roam as they please  For I can do nothing but weep  'Till PHILLIS my sorrow doth ease  III  Dear nymph hear thy shepherd complain  Return and subdue all my care  No longer torment me with pain  For constant I am I declare  Thy charms ever shall be my pride  Thy smiles I will ever admire  Then deign you to be but my bride  And satisfy all my desire  ON SPRING AND SHEPHERDS BLISS  Written at fifteen years old  I  HOW sweet the 'freshing gales of spring  Each blushing morn how gay  The tuneful lark begins to sing  As soon as dawn of day  II  Then next AURORA'S golden ray  Comes glancing o'er the plains  To hail the warbler's plaintive lay  And rouse the sturdy swains  III  Who from their cots to toil repair  Regardless of all strife  Unknowing and unknown to care  Is sure the shepherds life  IV  He toils he carols all the day  At eve then home he bends  Charm'd with birds on every spray  As to his cottage tends  V  His cottage teems with infants dear  That's wholesome clean and neat  His wife his bed his all is there  To make his joys compleat  VI  With these he sits a welcome guest  So happy and so gay  'Till twilight point the hour of rest  Then they its call obey  THE LINNET  Written at thirteen years old  I  AS passing by a wood and grove  I heard a linnet sing  Whose sweetly plaintive voice of love  Proclaim'd the chearful spring  II  His pretty accent seem'd to flow  As if he knew no pain  His downy throat he tun'd so sweet  It echo'd o'er the plain  III  Ah happy warbler I reply'd  Contented thus to be  'Tis only harmony and love  Can be compar'd to thee  IV  Thus perch'd upon the spray ye stand  The monarch of the shade  And ever sip embrosial sweets  That glows from ev'ry glade  V  Did man possess but half thy bliss  How joyful might he be  But man was never form'd for this  'Tis only joys for thee  VI  Then farewel pretty bird I said  Pursue thy plaintive tale  And let thy tuneful accent spread  All o'er the fragrant vale  AN EXTEMPORE  I  AS wand'ring in a rural shade  My soul quite rapt in thought  I chanc'd to meet the lovely maid  Who my fond heart had caught  II  I gaz'd I view'd her with delight  And told my lovesick tale  But ah the maid was in a fright  And bid me quit the vale  III  But I more tenderly reply'd  How can I leave the grove  Whilst here such matchless charms reside▪  That I adore and love  IV  But all in vain I told my tale  In vain I strove to please  For all my sighs could not prevail  Nor this fair maid appease  V  Some other swain there was in view  She said she lik'd the best  And vow'd to him she would prove true  With him her heart should rest  VI  Then strait I left the cruel fair  And fled along the plain  Regardless of her flirting air  And all her cold disdain  VII  And now some other nymph I'll find  Endow'd with lovely charms  And try if she will prove more kind  And take me to her arms  VIII▪  Adieu farewell then fickle maid  Adieu for ever more  No more I'll strive to seek thy aid  No more thy smiles implore  TO FLAVIA  Written on BirlingHill in Kent at fourteen years old  I  LOVELY FLAVIA list I pray  To yon warbler on the spray  Hear my fair his matin tale  Charming as the vernal gale  II  View▪ the fields all smiling round  See the flow'rets deck the ground  And the pretty lambkins play  While the ewes are gone astray  III  See the shepherd pensive sit  Making of a home spun net  With his bottle by his side  And his little dog call'd Tide  IV  How contented is his state  He envy's not the rich and great  Free from sorrows free from pain  Is the shepherd on the plain  V  Except his DAPHNE proves unkind  Then discontented is his mind  'Till she resolves to prove more true  Then all his cares she doth subdue  CORYDON'S COMPLAINT TO LUCINDA  Written at fifteen years old  I  WHY LUCINDA will you stray  From your ever constant swain  Who with anguish all the day  Sits repining on the plain  II  Turn fair maid and view me here  Pensive sitting on the ground  Drooping dying with dispair  Gazing on the fields around  III  When I view the pasture mead  How the lambkins skip and play  Shepherd's tune their oaten reed  And each bird his plaintive lay  IV  But what t' CORYDON are these  When LUCINDA is not near  Nought my sight can ever please  Nor sweet sounds will charm mine ear  V  Listen fair one to my grief  Take compassion on your swain  View him pleading for relief  Cease for ever all his pain  SONG  I  GENTLE is my dear FLORELLA  Kind and tender to her swain  Brighter sure then e'er was STELLA  Sweetest nymph of all the plain  II  Soft and pure are sure her kisses  Fragrance breathes thro' all her charms  She's the source of endless blisses  When I clasp her in my arms  III  STELLA thinks that she's more pleasing  O the vain ambitious fair  She her swain is always teazing  But FLORELLA soothes my care  IV  All her ways are so inviting  Ever giving fresh delights  Never pleas'd but when delighting  Crowns with peace my days and nights  THE WISH  A SONG  Written at fifteen years old  I  "WAS I a shepherd's maid to keep"  Some sheep upon the plain  I now had never known to weep  Nor felt ambition's pain  II  But pure contentment should enjoy  Unheedful of the great  Nor thus my hopes at once destroy  By pride's destructive state  III  Auspicious starssubdue my care  And guide me in thy ways  Nor thus let vanity ensnare  But happy make my days  IV  Teach me humility and love  And ever give me peace  O may I learn no more to rove  But from these foibles cease  DAMON AND LAURA  A DIALOGUE  DAMON  AH dearest LAURA ease my pain  Cease your DAMON'S anguish  Let me no longer sue in vain  No long'r let me languish  LAURA  Yes DAMON I will ease your pain  Since I do cause your smart  Then take at once my gentle swain  My hand and faithful heart  DAMON  Then strait to church let us repair  And join both hearts in one  We'll bid adieu to future care  And taste of joys alone  BOTH  Then we th' happiest pair will be  That e'er our state possest  Happier far than monarchs we  Let them be e'er so blest  A SONNET  I  LITTLE CUPID strike a dart  Stedfast at fair DAPHNE'S heart  Make her glow with fond desire  Fill her soul with am'rous fire  II  Charm her with thy soft persuasion  Make her melt at DAMON'S name  Give O give one kind occasion  To reward my ardent flame  III  Strive to make us blest for ever  In a peaceful humble state  Let ambition move us never  It is for the rich and great  IV  Give us only decent substance  With a little cleanly cot  There to live without reluctance  May this ever be our lot  SONG  I  YE gods how happy once was I  No mortal e'er so blest  'Till cruel JENNY caught my heart  And rob'd me of my rest  II  A form so lovely and divine  I could not but admire  But ah the sweet the cruel she  Has set my soul on fire  III  Come then thou soft endearing fair  And hear thy slave complain  Unlock his mind subdue his care  And take away the chain  SOLILOQUY ON A SPRING MORNING  By a Friend  I  HOW fresh the air How fair each scene  How full of sweets each field  What balmy odours breathe around  What lays the warblers yield  II  With what enchantment I review  AURORA'S early ray  That calls up nature's offspring all  To hail the fragrant MAY  III  Transported o'er the mead I walk  Or cross the verdant lawn  Pursue the winding streamlet's course  And mark the vernal dawn  IV  Devote my song to Him on high  From whom those beauties spring  And with extatic raptures cry  My GOD is nature's king  SAWNEY  A SCOTCH SONG  Set to music by Mr  French  I  SURE SAWNEY is the blythest swain  Of all around the TWEED  He tends the sheep upon the plain  And tunes his oaten reed  He tends c  II  He calls me his dear life and care  And his own MOGGY too  He vows by all that's good and fair  To me he will prove true  He vows c  III  So SAWNEY is a worthy swain  And I'll be SAWNEY'S wife  Then bid adieu to care and pain  And so be blest for life  Then bid c  SONNATA  I  SWEET CLARISSA of the Green  Lovely as the

III  Then to church let us be gone  There unite both hearts in one  So CLARISSA do not stay  But to church let's haste away  TO DELIA  I  MY Muse inspire me to impart  In humble ardent strain  To tell the anguish of my heart  To her that caus'd my pain  II  DELIA is the lovely maid  Alas thou charming fair  Behold fond DAMON seeks thy aid  To ease his pain and care  III  For thou alone can give relief  Or anguish most severe  Thy rapt'rous charms are all my grief  Until you prove sincere  SONG  Intended to be sung under  JESSICA  'S window in the  Merchant  of  Venice  by  LORENZO  LIST O

flow  Ye fragrant gales perfume around  While beauty decks the verdant ground  II  For here CLARINDA'S lull'd to rest  The darling pride of all the plain  But ah she scorns to make me blest  With scorn she shuns her constant swain  III  Waft to her ears kind CUPID pray  A soft and tender sigh from me  O bid her rise whilst here I stay  And set her faithful captive free  THE JOVIAL HUNTSMEN  A SONG  Written at fourteen years old  WITH hunting what sports can compare  So great are the pleasures it yields  How sweet to pursue the brisk hare  O'er vallies green meadows and fields  Then rouse all dull mortals and make no delay  To glorious hunting take horse and away  CHORUS  Then rouse c  For noble and manly's the game  'Tis wholesome and pleasant likewise  Of sports 'tis the foremost in fame  Then hunting we ever will prize  For we follow follow follow and we fly  O'er hedges and ditches with hounds in full cry  CHORUS  For we follow c  At eve we return from the chace  Quite chearful contented and gay  When eating and drinking takes place  To regale o'er th' sports of the day  So join chorus brave boys for on hunting's our song  Where glorious pleasure and pastime belong  FULL CHORUS  So join chorus c  SONG  I  ONE day o'er the green as I tript it along  A gentle young shepherd pass'd by  He tuned his pipe and so sweet was his song  He made my poor heart for to sigh  II  He called me back to sit by him a while  The swain I could scarcely deny  So sweetly he look'd and he gave me a smile  Which caus'd me still more for to sigh  III  Then strait he came to me and proffer'd a kiss  At which I seem'd modest and shy  Yet I vow in my heart I was pleased at this  Tho' he made me to flutter and sigh  IV  He told me he lov'd me and something beside  Which I must not repeat by th' bye  For fear the young shepherd my conduct should chide  And make me for ever to sigh  V  He promis'd to take me next week to the fair  And many fine things he will buy  Both roses and ribbons to stick in my hair  Then who'll be so shewy as I  IV  And if that the swain should make me his wife  To please him all means I will try  I'll ever be faithful and constant for life  And virt'ous until that I die  STREPHON AND PHOEBE  A CANTATA  Intended for the Public Gardens  Enter  Strephon  and  Phoebe  with wands in their hands  STREPHON  RECITATIVE  HAIL lovely PHOEBE charming maid  Why fly me

round me  "Or some bewitching charmer's near  "With music to confound me"  AIR  "Tune on tune on whoe'er thou art  "While I the heav'nly joys impart"  'Twas thus the sweet AMANDA cry'd  Mean time the swain inspir'd stood mute  Then eagerly threw down his lute  And thus in vocal lays reply'd  AIR  "Oh thou whose lovely charms outshine  "The sun's enamour'd ray  "Would gracious heav'n but make thee mine  "Thou sweetest flow'r of MAY  "Not all the outward gems or shew  "Bedeck'd with pride or art  "Should make me from my fairone go  "So constant is my heart"  RECITATIVE  Then strait AMANDA turning round  View'd DAMON kneeling on the ground  At which she started with surprize  While he exclaim'd "Sweet maid arise  "For ah I come to sooth your care  "Then deign to set your captive free  "Behold I come for to declare  "A flame that only burns for thee"  Then to each other's arms they sprung  And thus the youthful lovers sung  DUET  "Oh DAMON how shall I impart  "The joy this meeting

there's no depending  For their vows are soon forgot  Then what tormentsnever ending  Is the gen'rous maiden's lot  Yet DAMON urge not my request  Ease at once my raging pain  Ah make thy faithful DELIA blest  Take her to thy arms again  THE FORSAKEN MAID  A CANTATA  Written at thirteen years old  RECITATIVE  AH whither shall I fly to find relief  Is there no cure for wretchedness and grief  My

state  Ye nymphs take warning ere it is too late  AIR  How severe is my affliction  Thus to wander in dispair  Gods give ear to my direction  Cease ye pow'rs a maiden's care  Did the youth know how I languish  He would sure give me relief  Turn again and ease my anguish  Succour my distress and grief  The above little piece had the honor of being presented to the late Earl of CHESTERFIELD who admir'd it for its author's early genius and simplicity as he was pleased to say  THE SANDMAN  A CANTATA  Written at fourteen years old  Set to music by Mr  THOMAS SMART  RECITATIVE  I AM a poor lad and mean's my calling  From morn till night I am a bawling  Thro' streets thro' lanes and squares I pass  My treasure all on one poor ass  My constant theme where'er I go  Is "Maids do want sand Sand ho"  AIR  Tho' I'm a poor sandman I care not a jot  For all the fine folks in the nation  While I can get money to buy a full pot  I'm the happiest man in my station  I'm the happiest man in my station  What's riches or treasure  Or all the gay pleasure  Where happiness does not unite  'Tis nought but a juggle  A mere hubble bubble  Of pain and perplexity quite  Of pain and perplexity quite  RECITATIVE  Now my song's done a tale I'll tell  Which sure will please you all full well  One day as passing thro' the street  I blackey'd SUSAN chanc'd to meet  Ah dearest SAM to me she cry'd  When shall I be thy own true bride  Faith SUE quoth I I rather tarry  For hang me if I think to marry  She call'd me then ungrateful wretch  And said the devil would me fetch  But for all this I did not

OVID Epist iv v  I  I Ask'd the muse that rules the sounding lyre  To wreathe my temples with one sprig of bays  Some lofty subject to my soul inspire  Some lofty subject in heroic lays  II  But VENUS came the soft enchanting fair  I saw her glancing from her native sky  Loose flow'd her shining tresses in the air  And love's own lustre trembled from her eye  III  She bade me chuse a less ambitious strain  And shew'd the image of a smiling maid  Let DELIA'S praises echo to the plain  To ev'ry murm'ring stream and ev'ry shade  IV  O ruthless godess am I doom'd to bow  Again to love's soft empire and to thee  Wilt thou no respite to my pangs allow  No destin'd moment must this heart be free  V  Yet not for this I pass'd the sounding main  Yet not for this I sought a distant shore  Thy captive then exulting left his chain  And scorn'd that pow'r which gods and men adore  VI  But well thou hast aveng'd thy slighted pride  I feel thee now resistless in my veins  In vain would science soothe and wisdom hide  Thy triumphs goddess and thy suppliants pains  VII  Thee DELIA thee by ev'ry murm'ring stream  Or thicket rude unprest by human feet  I sing unheeded to the pale moon's gleam  Thee DELIA thee the echoing rocks repeat  VIII  Come then too fatal and too lovely fair  Come seek these groves and ease a wretch's toil  One look from thee can mitigate despair  And bid all nature with thy lover smile  IX  Nor thou despise the shepherd's artless tale  He leads fair truth and innocence along  Because she sings in some sequester'd vale  Are there no charms in Philomela's song  X  O might thy lover hope to win thy praise  His soul should kindle with a nobler flame  This hand should seize the bloodbesprinkled bays  Which conquest snatches from the shrines of fame  XI  Place me where raging slaughter's crimson wheels  O'er gasping ranks of bleeding warriors roar  And if my soul one thought of danger feels  O never DELIA may I see thee more  XII  Nor deem because I loiter in the shade  I bear a breast unequal in the deed  I hear the blasts of terror undismay'd  Tho' pleas'd I listen to the rural reed  XIII  For I was nurs'd in virtue's rigid lore  Nor will the goddess disavow my claim  She bade my steps the arduous path explore  Where sacred honour points the way to fame  XIV  But now far other cares distract my soul  Joyless the lawrel wreaths of fame I see  In vain her animating thunders roll  If with her blasts she mix no notes of thee  XV  Then listen DELIA to a swain undone  Ah hear a slave condemn'dthy chains to wear  So may thy days in peace glide gently on  Unmix'd with grief unsullied with a tear  XVI  For ah in vain thy gentle tear would slow  To see thy lover press an early tomb  Then let thy pity mitigate his woe  Ere sickness wither and despair consume  XVII  Wretch that I am ah rather let me bind  Hope's dear delusive chaplet to my brows  Let fancy paint thee to my wounded mind  All sweetly smiling on thy lover's vows  XVIII  O how I long by arching shades o'erhung  Where breezes sport and fountains murmur bland  To hear the tuneful accents of thy tongue  To press the glowing softness of thy hand  XIX  O how I long to lead thee to the bowers  Where FLORA scatters all her thousand dies  To braid thy glossy hair with dewy flowers  And catch the mild effulgence of thy eyes  XX  Thus with ideal bliss I fondly try  Beneath the woodbine shade to soothe my pains  But ah too soon the lovely phantoms fly  And stern reality alone remains  XXI  She bursts with thunders arm'd upon my dreams  She tears me strugling from the woodbine shade  She points to other groves and other streams  But ah she points me to no heav'nly maid  XXII  I come the mournful victim of despair  Adieu my DELIA and my hopes of rest  So flies the wounded deer the hunter's snare  Yet bears the arrow in his bleeding breast  ELEGY  Addressed to the Lady to whom this book is dedicated  Virtus nobillor auro  I  OH great APOLLO mighty prince of

spotless soul from ill ne'er knew a stain  But is with strictest honour amply stor'd  Virtue and truth with their angelic train  Compleat the nymph by all mankind ador'd  VIII  Would the indulgent pow'rs of heav'n decree  This fund of endless blisses for my wife  No kings in happiness should vie with me  Oh how delightfully would pass my life  IX  My pleasures she should shareand all my woe

for the year  M DCC LXXVI  Addressed to the farmers of Kent  Tune  As I was a driving my waggon one day  I  YE farmers of Kent who are jolly and gay  Come listen a while and pray mind what I say  May this season be crowned with plentiful crops  And off of an acre a load of good hops  Geho dobbin c  II  Oh may they prove fine tooand fetch a great price  That ye my brave boys may get rich in a trice  For as ye are ever both hearty and free  Success to ye all for to fill ye with glee  Geho dobbin c  III  To crown your repast in the hoping this year  I wish that the weather may be fine and clear  For when it is wet it is wretched and sad  From morning till night in a hop ground to pad  Oh sad hoping c  IV  Then to see th' poor hopers alas what a sight  'Tis enough t' put modesty into a fright  For they are so draggl'd and wet to the skin  And shew all for nothing their cloathing's so thin  Oh poor creatures c  V  In case of this weather let there be no flaw  Take care to provide them with plenty of straw  The hopers during the season▪ mostly lie upon straw in barns c which the farmers provide for them    That when the poor wretches retire to their nest▪  They may lie in comfort and all take their rest  Oh poor hopers c  IV  But above all that's said pray don't cheat the king  For if you do that it is sure a sad thing  As he'll have his duty by hook or by crook  Beware oh beware lest you're in the black book  Oh sad doings c  VII  Tho' ye have more honor at least so I trust  I'd have ye be always quite upright and just  For honor and honesty carries the sway  Then from these great maxims ne'er venture to stray  Oh rare hoping c  {inverted ⁂} As the above song was wrote at a very short notice and entirely to oblige a few gentlemen farmers in Kent it is hoped the critical reader
