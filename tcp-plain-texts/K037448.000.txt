 THE GOLDEN VERSES OF  PYTHAGORAS  Translated from the  Greek  by  N ROWE  Esq  WITH  A  POEM  on the late Glorious Successes c And an ODE for the NEWYEAR MDCCXVI By the same Hand  LONDON Printed for J TONSON And Sold by W FEALES at  Rowe  's Head the Corner of  EssexStreet  in the  Strand  MDCCXXXII  TO THE READER  _I  Hope the Reader will forgive the Liberty I have taken in Translating these Verses somewhat at large without which it would have been almost impossible to have given any kind of Turn in  English  Poetry to so dry a Subject The Sense of the Author is I hope no where mistaken and if there seems in some Places to be some Additions in the  English  Verses to the  Greek  Text they are only such as may be justify'd from  Hierocles  's Commentary and deliver'd by him as the larger and explain'd Sense of the Author's short Precept I have in some few  Places ventur'd to differ from the Learned Mr  Dacier  's French Interpretation as those that shall give themselves the trouble of a strict Comparison will find How far I am in the right is left to the Reader to determine  THE GOLDEN VERSES OF  PYTHAGORAS  _FIrst to the Gods thy humble Homage pay  The greatest this and first of Laws obey  Perform thy Vows observe thy plighte Troth  And let Religion bind thee to thy Oath  The Heroes next demand thy just regard  Renown'd on Earth and the Stars preferr'd  To Light and endless Life their Virtues sure Reward  Due Rights perform and Honours to the Dead  To ev'ry Wise to ev'ry Pious Shade  With lowly Duty to thy Parents bow  And Grace and Favour to thy Kindred show  For what concerns the rest of Humane kind  Choose out the Man to Virtue best inclin'd  Him to thy Arms receive him to thy Bosom bind  Possest of such a Friend preserve him still  Nor thwart his Counsels with thy stubborn Will▪  Pliant to all his Admonitions prove  And yield to all his Offices of Love  Him from thy Heart so true so justly dear  Let no rash Word nor light Offences tear  Bear all thou canst still with his Failings strive  And to the utmost still and still forgive  For strong Necessity alone explores  The secret Vigour of our latent Pow'rs  Rouses and urges on the lazy Heart  Force to its self unknown before t'exert  By use thy stronger Appetites asswage  Thy Gluttony thy Sloth thy Lust thy Rage  From each dishonest Act of Shame forbear  Of others and thy self alike beware  Let Rev'rence of thy self thy Thoughts control  And guard the sacred Temple of thy Soul  Let Justice o'er thy Word and Deed preside  And Reason ev'n thy meanest Actions guide  For know that Death is Man's appointed Doom  Know that the Day of great Account will come  When thy past Life shall strictly be survey'd  Each Word each Deed be in the Balance laid  And all the Good and all the Ill most justly be repaid  For Wealth the perishing uncertain Good  Ebbing and flowing like the sickle Flood  That knows no sure no fix'd abiding Place  But wandring loves from Hand to Hand to pass  Revolve the Getter's Joy and Loser's Pain  And think if it be worth thy while to gain  Of all those Sorrows that attend Mankind  With Patience bear the Lot to thee assign'd  Nor think it Chance nor murmur at the Load  For know what Man calls Fortune is from God  In what thou may'st from Wisdom seek Relief  And let her healing Hand asswage the Grief  Yet still whate'er the Righteous Doom ordains  What Cause soever multiplies thy Pains  Let not those Pains as Ills be understood  For God delights not to afflict the Good  The Reas'ning Art to various Ends apply'd  Is oft a sure but oft an erring Guide  Thy Judgment therefore sound and cool preserve  Nor lightly from thy Resolution swerve  The dazling Pomp of Words does oft deceive  And sweet Persuasion wins the Easy to believe  When Fools and Liars labour to persuade  Be dumb and let the Bablers vainly plead  This above all this Precept chiefly learn  This nearly does and first thy self concern▪  Let not Example let no soothing Tongue  Prevail upon thee with a  Siren  's Song  To do thy Soul's Immortal Essence wrong  Of Good and Ill by Words or Deeds exprest  Choose for thy self and always choose the best  Let wary Thought each Enterprize forerun  And ponder on thy Task before begun  Lest Folly shou'd the wretched Work deface  And mock thy fruitless Labours with Disgrace  Fools huddle on and always are in haste  Act without Thought and thoughtless Words they waste  But thou in all thou dost with early Cares  Strive to prevent at first a Fate like theirs  That Sorrow on the End may never wait  Nor sharp Repentance make thee Wise too late  Beware thy meddling Hand in ought to try  That does beyond thy reach of Knowledge lie  But seek to know and bend thy serious Thought  To search the profitable Knowledge out  So Joys on Joys for ever shall increase  Wisdom shall crown thy Labours and shall bless  Thy Life with Pleasure and thy End with Peace  Nor let the Body want its Part but share  A just Proportion of thy tender Care  For Health and Welfare prudently provide  And let its lawful Wants be all supply'd  Let sober Draughts refresh and wholsom Fare  Decaying Nature's wasted Force repair  And sprightly Exercise the duller Spirits chear  In all Things still which to this Care belong  Observe this Rule to guard thy Soul from Wrong  By virtuous Use thy Life and Manners frame  Manly and simply pure and free from Blame  Provoke not Envy's deadly Rage but fly  The glancing Curse of her malicious Eye  Seek not in needless Luxury to waste  Thy Wealth and Substance with a Spendthrift's Haste  Yet flying these be watchful lest thy Mind  Prone to Extremes an equal Danger find  And be to sordid Avarice inclin'd  Distant alike from each to neither lean  But ever keep the happy GOLDEN MEAN  Be careful still to guard thy Soul from Wrong  And let thy Thought prevent thy Hand and Tongue  Let not the stealing God of Sleep surprise  Nor creep in Slumbers on thy weary Eyes  Ere ev'ry Action of the former Day  Strictly thou dost and righteously survey  With Rev'rence at thy own Tribunal stand  And answer justly to thy own Demand  Where have I been In what have I transgress'd  What Good or Ill has this Day's Life express'd  Where have I fail'd in what I ought to do  In what to God to Man or to my self I owe  Inquire severe whate'er from first to last  From Morning's Dawn 'till Ev'ning's Gloom has past  If Evil were thy Deeds repenting mourn  And let thy Soul with strong Remorse be torn  If Good the Good with Peace of Mind repay  And to thy secret Self with Pleasure say  Rejoice my Heart for all went well today  These Thoughts and chiefly these thy Mind should move  Employ thy Study and engage thy Love  These are the Rules which will to Virtue lead  And teach thy Feet her heav'nly Paths to tread  This by his Name I swear whose sacred Lore  First to Mankind explain'd the Mystick FOUR  Source of Eternal Nature and Almighty Pow'r  In all thou dost first let thy Prayers ascend  And to the Gods thy Labours first commend  From them implore Success and hope a prosp'rous End  So shall thy abler Mind be taught to soar  And Wisdom in her secret Ways explore  To range through Heav'n above and Earth below  Immortal Gods and mortal Men to know  So shalt thou learn what Pow'r does all control  What bounds the Parts and what unites the Whole  And rightly judge in all this wondrous Frame  How universal Nature is the same  So shalt thou ne'er thy vain Affections place  On Hopes of what shall never come to pass  Man wretched Man thou shalt be taught to know  Who bears within himself the inborn Cause of Woe  Unhappy Race that never yet could tell  How near their Good and Happiness they dwell  Depriv'd of Sense they neither hear nor see  Fetter'd in Vice▪ they seek not to be free  But stupid to their own sad Fate agree  Like pond'rous Rollingstones oppress'd with Ill  The Weight that loads 'em makes 'em roll on still  Bereft of Choice and Freedom of the Will  For native Strife in ev'ry Bosom reigns  And secretly an impious War maintains  Provoke not THIS but let the Combat cease  And ev'ry yielding Passion sue for Peace  Wouldst thou great  Jave  thou Father of Mankind  Reveal the  Demon  for that Task assign'd  The wretched Race an End of Woes would find▪  And yet be bold O Man Divine thou art  And of the Gods Celestial Essence Part  Nor sacred Nature is from thee conceal'd  But to thy Race her mystick Rules reveal'd  These if to know thou happily attain  Soon shalt thou perfect be in all that I ordain  Thy wounded Soul to Health thou shalt restore  And free from ev'ry Pain she felt before  Abstain I warn from Meats unclean and foul  So keep thy Body pure so free thy Soul  So rightly judge thy Reason so maintain  Reason which Heav'n did for thy Guide ordain  Let that best Reason ever hold the Rein  Then if this mortal Body thou forsake  And thy glad Flight to the pure Aether take  Among the Gods exalted shalt thou shine  Immortal Incorruptible Divine  The Tyrant Death securely shalt thou brave  And scorn the dark Dominion of the Grave  A POEM On the Late Glorious Successes c  Humbly Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable the LORD TREASURER  _WHILE Kings and Nations on thy Counsels wait  And  ANNA  trusts to thee the  British  State  While Fame to thee from ev'ry Foreign Coast  Flies with the News of Empires won and lost  Relates whate'er her busy Eyes beheld  And tells the Fortune of each bloody Field  While with officious Duty Crowds attend  To hail the Labours of thy Godlike Friend  Vouchsafe the Muses humbler Joy to hear  For Sacred Numbers shall be still thy Care  Tho' mean the Verse tho' lowly be the Strain  Tho' least regarded be the Muse of all the tuneful Train▪  Yet rise neglected Nymph avow thy Flame  Assert th' inspiring God and greatly aim  To make thy Numbers equal to thy Theme  From Heav'n derive thy Verse to Heav'n belong  The Counsels of the Wise and Battles of the Strong  To Heav'n the Royal  ANNA

Stubborn and repress the Bold  Her peaceful Arts fierce Factions to asswage  To heal their Breaches and to sooth their Rage  Thence is that happy Prudence which presides  In each Design and ev'ry Action guides  Thence is she taught Her shining Court to grace  And fix the Worthiest in the worthiest Place  To trust at home GODOLPHIN's watchful Care  And send victorious CHURCHILL forth to War  Arise ye Nations rescu'd by Her Sword  Freed from the Bondage of a Foreign Lord  Arise and join the Heroine to bless  Behold She sends to save you from Distress  Rich is the Royal Bounty She bestows  'Tis Plenty Peace and Safety from your Foes▪  And thou  Iberia  rous'd at length disdain  To wear inslav'd the  Gallick  Tyrant's Chain  For see the  British  Genius comes to chear  The fainting Sons and kindle'em to War  With Her own glorious Fires their Souls She warms▪  And bids 'em burn for Liberty and Arms  Unhappy Land the Formost once in Fame  Once lifting to the Stars thy Noble Name  In Arts excelling and in Arms severe  The Western Kingdoms Envy and their Fear  Where is thy Pride thy conscious Honour flown  Thy ancient Valour and thy first Renown  How art thou sunk among the Nations now  How hast thou taught thy haughty Neek to bow  And dropt the Warrior's Wreath inglorious from thy Brow  Not thus of Old her valiant Fathers bore  The Bondage of the unbelieving  Moor  But oft alternate▪ made the Victors yield  And prov'd their Might in many a wellfought Field  Bold in Defence of Liberty they stood  And doubly dy'd their Cross in  Moorish  Blood  Then in Heroick Arms their Knights excell'd  The Tyrant then and Giant then they quell'd  Then ev'ry nobler Thought their Minds did move  And those who fought for Freedom sigh'd for Love  Like one those sacred Flames united live  At once they languish and at once revive  Alike they shun the Coward and the Slave  But bless the Free the Virtuous and the Brave  Nor frown ye Fair nor think my Verse untrue  Tho' we disdain that Man should Man subdue  Yet all the Freeborn Race are Slaves alike to you  Yet once again that Glory to Restore  The  Britons  seek the  Celtiberian  Shore  With echoing Peals at  ANNA  's high Command  Their Naval Thunder wakes the drowsy Land  High at their Head  Iberia  's promis'd Lord  Young  Charles  of  Austria  waves his shining Sword  His youthful Veins with Hopes of Empire glow  Swell his bold Heart and urge him on the Foe  With Joy he reads in ev'ry Warrior's Face  Some happy Omen of a sure Success  Then leaps exulting on the Hostile Strand  And thinks the destin'd Sceptre in his Hand  Nor Fate denies what first his Wishes name  Proud  Barcelona  owns his juster Claim  With the first Laurel binds his youthful Brows  And Pledge of future Crowns the mural Wreath bestows▪  But soon the Equal of his youthful Years  Philip  of  Bourbon  's haughty Line appears  Like Hopes attend his Birth like Glories grace  If Glory can be in a Tyrant's Race  In Numbers proud he threats no more from far  But nearer draws the black impending War  He views his Host then scorns the Rebel Town  And dooms to certain Death the Rival of his Crown  Now Fame and Empire all the Nobler Spoils  That urge the Hero and reward his Toils  Plac'd in their View alike their Hopes engage  And fire their Breasts with more than Mortal Rage  Not lawless Love not Vengeance nor Despair  So daring fierce untam'd and furious are  As when Ambition prompts the Great to War  As youthful Kings when striving for Renown  They prove their Might in Arms and combat for a Crown  Hard was the cruel Strife and doubtful long  Betwixt the Chiefs suspended Conquest hung  Till forc'd at length disdaining much to yield  Charles  to his Rival quits the fatal Field  Numbers and Fortune o'er his Right prevail  And ev'n the  British  Valour seems to fail  And yet they fail'd not all In that Extreme  Conscious of Virtue Liberty and Fame  They vow the youthful Monarch's Fate to share  Above Distress unconquer'd by Despair  Still to defend the Town and animate the War  But lo when every better Hope was past  When every Day of Danger seem'd their last  Far on the distant Ocean they survey  Where a proud Navy plows its wat'ry Way  Nor long they doubted but With Joy descry  Upon the Chief's tall Topmasts waving high  The  British  Cross and  Belgick  Lion fly  Loud with tumultuous Clamour loud they rear  Their Cries of Ecstasy and rend the Air  In Peals on Peals the Shouts Triumphal rise  Spread swift and rattle thro' the spacious Skies  While from below old Ocean grones profound  The Walls the Rocks the Shores repel the Sound  Ring with the deaf'ning Shock and thunder all around  Such was the Joy the  Trojan  Youth express'd  Who by the fierce  Rutilian  's Siege distress'd  Were by the  Tyrrhene  Aid at length releas'd  When young  Ascanius  then in Arms first try'd  Numbers and ev'ry other Want supply'd  And haughty  Turnus  from his Walls defy'd  Sav'd in the Town an Empire yet to come  And fix'd the Fate of his Imperial  Rome  But oh what Verse what Numbers shall reveal  Those Pangs of Rage and Grief the Vanquish'd feel  Who shall Retreating  Philip  's Shame impart  And tell the Anguish of his lab'ring Heart  What Paint what speaking Pencil shall express  The blended Passions striving in his Face  Hate Indignation Courage Pride Remorse  With Thoughts of Glory past the Loser's greatest Curse  Fatal Ambition say what wondrous Charms  Delude Mankind to toil for thee in Arms  When all thy Spoils thy Wreaths in Battle won  The Pride of Pow'r and Glory of a Crown  When all War gives when all the Great can gain  Ev'n thy whole Pleasure pays not half thy Pain  All hail ye softer happier Arts of Peace  Secur'd from Harms and blest with learned Ease  In Battles Blood and Perils hard unskill'd  Which haunt the Warrior in the fatal Field  But chief thee Goddess Muse my Verse wou'd raise  And to thy own soft Numbers tune thy Praise  Happy the Youth inspir'd beneath thy Shade  Thy verdant everliving Laurels laid  There safe no Pleasures there no Pains they know  But those which from thy Sacred Raptures flow  Nor wish for Crowns but what thy Groves bestow  Me Nymph Divine nor scorn my humble Pray'r  Receive unworthy to thy kinder Care  Doom'd to a gentler tho' more lowly Fate  Nor wishing once nor knowing to be Great  Me to thy peaceful Haunts inglorious bring  Where secret thy Celestial Sisters Sing  Fast by their Sacred Hill and sweet  Castalian  Spring  But nobler Thoughts the Victor Prince employ  And raise his Heart with high Triumphant Joy  From hence a better Course of Time rolls on  And whiter Days successive seem to run  From hence his kinder Fortune seems to date  The Rising Glories of his future State  From henceBut oh too soon the Hero mourns  His Hopes deceiv'd and War's inconstant Turns  In vain his echoing Trumpets loud Alarms  Provoke the cold  Iberian  Lords to Arms  Careless of Fame as of their Monarch's Fate  In sullen Sloth supinely Proud they sate  Or to be Slaves or Free alike prepar'd  And trusting Heav'n was bound to be their Guard  Untouch'd with Shame the noble Strife beheld  Nor once essay'd to struggle to the Field  But sought in the cool Shade and rural Seat  An unmolested Ease and calm Retreat  Saw each contending Prince's Arms advance  Then with a lazy dull Indifference  Turn'd to their Rest and left the World to Chance  So when commanded by the Wife of  Jove  Thaumantian Iris  left the Realms above  And swift descending on her painted Bow  Sought the dull God of Sleep in Shades below  Nodding and slow his drowsy Head he rear'd▪  And heavily the sacred Message heard  Then with a Yawn at once forgot the Pain  And sunk to his first Sloth and Indolence again  But oh my Muse th' ungrateful Toil forsake  Some Task more pleasing to thy Numbers take  Nor choose in melancholy Strains to tell  Each harder Chance the juster Cause befel  Oh rather turn auspicious turn thy Flight  Where MARLBOROUGH'S Heroick Arms invite  Where highest Deeds the Poets Breast inspire  With Rage divine and fan the sacred Fire  See where at once  Ramillia  's noble Field  Ten thousand Themes for living Verse shall yield  See where at once the dreadful Objects rise  At once they spread before my wond'ring Eyes  And shock my lab'ring Soul with vast Surprise  At once the wideextended Battles move  At once they join at once their Fate they prove  The Roar ascends promiscuous Grones and Cries  The Drums the Cannons' Burst the Shout supplies  One Universal Anarchy of Noise  One Din confus'd Sound mixt and lost in Sound  Echo's to all the frighted Cities round  Thick Dust and Smoke in wavy Clouds arise  Stain the bright Day and taint the purer Skies  While flashing Flames like Light'ning dart between  And fill the Horror of the fatal Scene  Around the Field all dy'd in purple Fome  Hate Fury and insatiate Slaughter roam  Discord with Pleasure o'er the Ruin treads  And laughing wraps her in her tatter'd Weeds  While fierce  Bellona  thunders in her Car  Shakes terrible her steely Whip from far  And with new Rage revives the fainting War  So when two Currents rapid in their Course  Rush to a Point and meet with equal Force  The angry Billows rear their Heads on high  Dashing aloft the foaming Surges fly  And rising cloud the Air with misty Spry  The raging Flood is heard from far to rore  By list'ning Shepherds on the distant Shore  While much they fear what Ills it should portend  And wonder why the watry Gods contend  High in the midst  Britannia  's warlike Chief  Too greatly bold and prodigal of Life  Is seen to press where Death and Dangers call  Where the War bleeds and where the thickest fall  He flies and drives confus'd the fainting  Gaul  Like Heat diffus'd his great Example warms  And animates the Social Warrior's Arms  Inflames each colder Heart confirms the Bold  Makes the Young Heroes and renews the Old  In Forms Divine around him watchful wait  The Guardian Genii of the  British  State  Justice and Truth his Steps unerring guide  And faithful Loyalty defends his Side  Prudence and Fortitude their MARLERO guard  And pleasing Liberty his Labours chear'd  But chief the Angel of his Queen was there  The Union Cross his Silver Shield did bear  And in his decent Hand he shook a warlike Spear  While Victory Celestial soars above  Plum'd like the Eagle of Imperial  Jove  Hang's o'er the Chief whom she delights to bless  And ever arms his Sword with sure Success  Dooms him the proud Oppressor to destroy  Then waves her Palm and claps her Wings for Joy  Such was young  Ammon  on  Arbela  's Plain  Or such the  Le Brun  Painter did the Hero feign  Where rushing on and fierce he seems to ride  With graceful Ardor and majestick Pride  With all the Gods of  Greece  and Fortune on his Side  Nor long  Bavaria  's haughty Prince in vain  Labours the Fight unequal to maintain  He sees 'tis doom'd his fatal Friend the  Gaul  Shall share the Shame and in one Ruin fall  Flies from the Foe too oft in Battle try'd  And Heav'n contending on the Victor's Side  Then mourns his rash Ambition's Crime too late▪  And yields reluctant to the Force of Fate  So when  Aeneas  thro' Night's gloomy Shade  The dreadful Forms of Hostile Gods survey'd  Hopeless he lese the burning Town and fled  Saw 'twas in vain to prop declining  Troy  Or save what Heav'n had destin'd to destroy  What vast Reward O  Europe  shalt thou pay  To him who sav'd thee on this glorious Day  Bless him ye grateful Nations where he goes  And heap the Victor's Laurel on his Brows  In ev'ry Land in ev'ry City freed  Let the proud Column rear its Marble Head  To MARLBOROUGH and Liberty decreed  Rich with his Wars triumphal Arches raise  To teach your wond'ring Sons the Hero's Praise  To him your skilful Bards their Verse shall bring  For him the tuneful Voice be taught to sing  The breathing Pipe shall swell shall found the trembling String  Oh happy thou where Peace for ever smiles  Britannia  noblest of the Ocean's Isles  Fair Queen who dost amidst thy Waters reign  And stretch thy Empire o'er the farthest Main  What Transports in thy Parent Bosom roll'd  When Fame at first the pleasing Story told  How didst thou lift thy Tow'ry Front on high  Not meanly Conscious of a Mother's Joy  Proud of thy Son as  Crete  was of her  Jove  How wert thou pleas'd Heav'n did thy Choice approve  And fixt Success where thou hadst fixt thy Love  How with Regret his Absence didst thou mourn  How with Impatience wait his wisht Return  How were the Winds accus'd for his Delay  How didst thou chide the Gods who rule the Sea  And charge the  Nereid  Nymphs to waft him on his Way  At length he comes he ceases from his Toil  Like Kings of Old returning from the Spoil  To  Britain  and his Queen for ever dear  He comes their Joy and grateful Thanks to share  Lowly he kneels before the Royal Seat  And lays his proudest Wreaths at  ANNA  's Feet  While form'd alike for Labours or for Ease  In Camps to Thunder or in Courts to please  Britain  's bright Nymphs make MARLBOROUGH their Care  In all his Dangers all his Triumphs share  Conqu'ring he lends the wellpleas'd Fair new Grace  And adds fresh Lustre to each beauteous Face  Britain  preserv'd by his victorious Arms  With wond'rous Pleasure each fair Bosom warms  Lightens in all their Eyes and doubles all their Cherms  Ev'n his own  Sunderland  in Beauty's Store  So Rich she seem'd incapable of more  Now shines with Graces never known before  Fierce with transporting Joy she seems to burn  And each soft Feature takes a sprightly Turn  New Flames are seen to sparkle in her Eyes  And on her blooming Cheeks fresh Roses rise  The pleasing Passion heightens each bright Hue  And seems to touch the finish'd Piece anew  Improves what Nature's bounteous Hand had giv'n  And mends the fairest Workmanship of Heav'n  Nor Joy like this in Courts is only found  But spreads to all the grateful People round  Laborious Hinds inur'd to Rural Toil  To tend the Flocks and turn the mellow Soil  In homely Guise their honest Hearts express  And bless the Warrior who protects the Peace  Who keeps the Foe aloof and drives afar  The dreadful Ravage of the Wasting War  No rude Destroyer cuts the rip'ning Crop  Prevents the Harvest and deludes their Hope  No helpless Wretches fly with wild Amaze  Look weeping back and see their Dwellings blaze  The Victor's Chain no mournful Captives know  Nor hear the Threats of the insulting Foe  But Freedom laughs the fuitful Fields abound  The chearful Voice of Mirth is heard to sound  And Plenty doles her various Bounties round  The humble Village and the wealthy Town  Consenting join their Happiness to own  What Heav'n and  ANNA  's gentlest Reign afford  All is secur'd by MARLBRÔ's conqu'ring Sword  O Sacred ever Honour'd Name O thou  That wert our Greatest  William  once below  What Place soe'er thy Virtues now possess  Near the bright Source of everlasting Bliss  Wheree'er exalted to Etherial Height  Radiant with Stars thou tread'st the Fields of Light  Thy Seats Divine thy Heav'n awhile forsake  And deign the  Britons'  Triumph to partake▪  Nor art thou chang'd but still thou shalt delight  To hear the Fortune of the glorious Fight  How fail'd Oppression and prevail'd the Right  What once below such still thy Pleasures are  Europe  and Liberty are still thy Care  Thy Great thy Gen'rous Pure Immortal Mind  Is ever to the Publick Good inclin'd  Is still the Tyrant's Foe and Patron of Mankind  Behold where MARLBOROUGH thy last best Gift  At Parting to thy Native  Belgia  left  Succeeds to all thy kind Paternal Cares  Thy watchful Counsels and laborious Wars  Like thee extends his great assisting Hand  And in thy Stead protects the Orphan Land  Like thee aspires by Virtue to Renown  Fights to secure an Empire not his own  Reaps only Toil himself and gives away a Crown  At length thy Pray'er O Pious Prince is heard  Heav'n has at length in its own Cause appear'd  At length  Ramillia  's Field atones for all  The faithless Breaches of the perjur'd  Gaul  At length a better Age to Man decreed  With Truth with Peace and Justice shall succeed  Fall'n are the Proud and the griev'd World is freed  One Triumph yet my Muse remains behind  Another Vengeance yet the  Gaul  shall find  On  Lombard  Plains beyond his  Alpine  Hills  Louis  the Force of Hostile  Britain  feels  Swift to her Friends distress'd her Succours fly  And distant Wars her Wealthy Sons supply  From slow unactive Courts they grieve to hear  Eugene  a Name to ev'ry  Briton  dear  By tedious languishing Delays is held  Repining and impatient from the Field  While factious▪ Statesmen riot in Excess  And lazy Priests whole Provinces possess  Of unregarded Wants the Brave complain  And the starv'd Soldier sues for Bread in vain  At once with generous Indignation warm  Britain  the Treasure sends and bids the Heroe Arm  Staight eager to the Field he speeds away  There vows the Victor  Gaul  shall dear repay  The Spoils of  Calcinato  's fatal Day  Chear'd by the Presence of the Chief they love  Once more their Fate the Warriors long to prove  Reviv'd each Soldier lifts his drooping Head  Forgets his Wounds and calls him on to Lead  Again their Crests the  German  Eagles rear  Stretch their broad Wings and Fan the  Latian  Air  Greedy for Battle and the Prey they call  And point great  Eugene  's Thunder on the  Gaul  The Chief commands and soon in dread Array  Onwards the moving Legions urge their Way  With hardy Marches and successful Haste  O'er ev'ry Barrier Fortunate they pass'd  Which Nature or the skilful Foe had plac'd  The Foe in vain with  Gallick  Arts attends  To mark which way the wary Leader bends  Vainly in War's mysterious Rules is Wise  Lurks where tall Woods and thickest Coverts rise  And meanly hopes a Conquest from Surprize  Now with swift Horse the Plain around 'em beats  And oft Advances and as oft Retreats  Now fix'd to wait the coming Force he seems  Secur'd by steepy Banks and rapid Streams  While RiverGods in vain Exhaust their Store  From plenteous Urns the gushing Torrents pour  Rise o'er their utmost Margins to the Plain  And strive to stay the Warrior's Haste in vain  Alike they pass the Plain and closer Wood  Explore the Ford and tempt the swelling Flood  Unshaken still pursue their stedfast Course  And where they want their Way they find it or they force  But anxious Thoughts  Savoy  's Great Prince infest  And roll illboding in his Careful Breast  Oft he revolves the Ruins of the Great  And sadly thinks on lost  Bavaria  's Fate  The hapless Mark of Fortune's cruel Sport  An Exile meanly forc'd to beg Support  From the slow Bounties of a Foreign Court  Forc'd from his lov'd  Turin  his last Retreat  His Glory once and Empire's ancient Seat  He sees from far where wide Destructions spread  And fiery Show'rs the goodly Town Invade  Then turns to mourn in vain his ruin'd State  And curse the unrelenting Tyrant's Hate  But great  Eugene  prevents his ev'ry Fear  He had resolv'd it and he would be there▪  Not Danger Toil the tedious weary Way  Nor all the  Gallick  Pow'rs his promis'd Aid delay  Like Truth itself unknowing how to fail  He scorn'd to doubt and knew he must prevail  Thus ever certain does the Sun appear  Bound by the Law of  Jove  's Eternal Year  Thus constant to his Course sets out at Morn  Round the wide World in twice Twelve Hours is born  And to a Moment keeps his fix'd Return  Straight to the Town the Heroes turn their Care  Their Friendly Succour for the Brave prepare  And on the Foe united bend the War  O'er the steep Trench and Ramparts guarded Height  At once they rush and drive the rapid Fight  With idle Arms the  Gallick  Legions seem  To stem the Rage of the resistless Stream  At once it bears 'em down at once they yield  Headlong are push'd and swept along the Field  Resistance ceases and 'tis War no more  At once the Vanquish'd own the Victors Pow'r  Throughout the Field wheree'er they turn their Sight  'Tis all or Conquest or Inglorious Flight  Swift to their rescu'd Friends their Joys they bear  With Life and Liberty at once they Chear  And save 'em in the Moment of Despair  So timely to the Aid of sinking  Rome  With active Haste did Great  Camillus  come  So to the  Capitol  he forc'd his Way  So from the proud  Barbarians  snatch'd the Prey  And sav'd his Country in one Signal Day  From impious Arms at length O  Louis  cease  And leave at length the lab'ring World in Peace  Lest Heav'n disclose some yet more Fatal Scene  Fatal beyond  Ramillia  or  Turin  Lest from thy Hand thou see thy Sceptre torn  And humbled in the Dust thy Losses mourn  Lest urg'd at length thy own repining Slave  Tho' fond of Burdens and in Bondage brave  Pursue thy Hoary Head with Curses to the Grave  ODE FOR THE  NEW YEAR  MDCCXVI  I  HAIL to thee Glorious rising Year  With what uncommon Grace thy Days appear  Comely art thou in thy Prime  Lovely Child of hoary Time  Where thy golden Footsteps tread  Pleasures all around thee spread  Bliss and Beauty grace thy Train  Muse strike the Lyre to some immortal Strain  But oh what Skill what Master Hand  Shall govern or constrain the wanton Band  Loose like my Verse they Dance and all without Command  Images of fairest things  Croud about the speaking Strings  Peace and sweet Prosperity  Faith and chearful Loyalty  With smiling Love and deathless Poesy  II  Ye skowling Shades who break away  Well do ye fly and shun the Purple Day  Ev'ry Fiend and Fiendlike Form  Black and sullen as a Storm  Jealous Fear and false Surmise  Danger with her dreadful Eyes  Faction Fury all are fled  And bold Rebellion hides her daring Head  Behold thou gracious Year behold  To whom thy Treasures all thou shalt unfold  For whom thy whiter Days were kept from times of Old  See thy  GEORGE  for this is he  On his Right Hand waiting free  Britain  and fair Liberty  Every Good is in his Face  Every open honest Grace  Thou great  Plantagenet  immortal be thy Race  III  See the Sacred Scyon springs  See the glad Promise of a Line of Kings  Royal Youth what Bard Divine  Equal to a Praise like thine  Shall in some exalted Measure  Sing thee  Britain  's dearest Treasure  Who her Joy in thee shall tell  Who the sprightly Note shall swell  His Voice attemp'ring to the tuneful Shell  Thee  Audenard  's recorded Field  Bold in thy brave Paternal Band beheld  And saw with hopeless Heart thy fainting Rival yield  Troubled he with sore Dismay  To thy stronger Fate gave way  Safe beneath thy noble Scorn  Wingyfooted was he Born  Swift as the fleeting Shades upon the golden Corn  IV  What Valour what distinguish'd Worth  From thee shall lead the coming Ages forth  Crested Helms and shining Shields  Warriors fam'd in foreign Fields  Hoary Heads with Olive bound  Kings and Lawgivers renown'd  Crowding still they rise anew  Beyond the Reach of deep Prophetick View  Young AUGUSTUS Never cease  Pledge of our present and our future Peace  Still pour the Blessings forth and give thy great Increase  All the Stock that Fate ordains  To supply succeeding Reigns  Whether Glory shall Inspire  Gentler Arts of Martial Fire  Still the fair Descent shall be  Dear to  Albion  all like Thee  Patrons of righteous Rules and Foes to Tyranny  V  Ye golden Lights who shine on high  Ye potent Planets who ascend the Sky  On the op'ning Year dispense  All your kindest Influence  Heav'nly Pow'rs be all prepar'd  For our CAROLINA's Guard  Short and easy be the Pains  Which for a Nation's Weal the Heroine sustains  Britannia  's Angel be thou near  The growing Race is thy peculiar Care  Oh spread thy Sacred Wing above the Royal Fair  GEORGE  by Thee was wafted o'er  To the long expecting Shore  None presuming to withstand  Thy Celestial armed Hand  While his Sacred Head to shade  The blended Cross on high Thy silver Shield display'd  VI  But oh what other Form Divine  Propitious near the Hero seems to shine  Peace of Mind and Joy serene  In her sacred Eyes are seen  Honour binds her Miter'd Brow  Faith and Truth beside her go  With Zeal and pure Devotion bending low  A thousand Storms around her threat  A thousand Billows roar beneath her Feet  While fix'd upon a Rock she keeps her Stable Seat  Still in sign of sure Defence  Trust and mutual Confidence  On the Monarch standing by  Still she bends her gracious Eye  Nor fears her Foes approach while Heav'n and He are nigh  VII  Hence then with ev'ry anxious Care  Begone pale Envy and thou cold Despair  Seek ye out a moody Cell  Where Deceit and Treason dwell  There repining raging still  Th'idle Air with Curses fill  There blast the pathless Wild and the bleak Northern Hill  There your Exile vainly moan  There where with Murmurs horrid as your own  Beneath the sweeping Winds the bending Forests groan  But thou Hope with smiling Chear  Do thou bring the ready Year  See the Hours a chosen Band  See with jocund Looks they stand  All in their trim Array and waiting for Command  VIII  The welcome Train begins to move  Hope leads Increase and chaste Connubial Love  Flora  sweet her Bounty spreads  Smelling Gardens painted Meads  Ceres  crowns the yellow Plain  Pan  rewards the Shepherd's Pain  All is Plenty all is Wealth  And on the balmy▪ Air fits Rosycolour'd Health  I hear the Mirth I hear the Land rejoice  Like many Waters swells the pealing Noise  While to their Monarch thus they raise the publick Voice  Father of thy Country hail  Always every where prevail  Pious Valiant Just and Wise  Better Suns for thee arise  Purer Breezes fan the Skies  Earth in Fruits and Flowers is drest  Joy abounds in ev'ry Breast  For thee thy People all for thee the Year is blest  FINIS
