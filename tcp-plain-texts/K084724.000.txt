 THE CALCULATION OF Solar Eclipses WITHOUT PARALLAXES  A Calculation of the Great Eclipse of the Sun  April  d  in the Morning  from M  r  Flamsteed's Tables as corrected according to S  r  Isaac Newtons Theory of the Moon in the Astronomical Lectures with its Construction for  London Rome and stockholme  By W Whiston  MA  NB  The Inquisitive are desir'd nicely to Observe whether in such Places where the Eclipse is plainly Total there be not streaks of Red Light just before after that Total Darkness and how long it is visible For if there be it will imply that 'tis an Atmosphere about the Moon that is the occasion of it by its duration the height of the same Atmosphere may in some measure be determined also  The Sun's True Place and Anomaly     s  °  ′  ″  s  °  ′  ″  Anno Dom

Disk of the Earth as seen from its Center Projected at the distance of the Moon The Elliptick Parallels with their Hours represent the Cities of  London Rome  and  Stockholme  as plac'd at those Hours at different Times The Principal strait Line divided by dotts represents the Path of the Moons Center ever the Disk of the Earth And by the Hours in Larger and those above and below in smaller Characters the Position of the Center is determind at those Times for those Places respectively So that if with a pair of Compasse  we take from the proper Scale the Semediameter of the Penumbra and carry it along the Path till it first reaches to and then leaves the same minute on any Parallel that is the very time of its Begin̄ing and Ending there And if at any intermediate time in both you make Circles one with the Moons Semidiameter on its Path the other with the Suns on any of the Parallels▪ the Intercepted part will shew the quantity of the Eclipse at that time in the Place to  which the Parallel you we does belong And if you carry a Square along the Path till the Perpendicular side cuts the same Hour and Minute there and in any Parallel that is the Middle of the Eclipse there Of all which you have examples in the Scheme Only Note that the Center of the Penumbra at after▪ and at after ▪ which are the beginning and ending of the General Eclipse extends beyond the▪ Copper Plate and is to be supply'd by the Ren at the intersection of the proper Lines there to directed  The Breadth of the intire Penumbra or paitial Eclipse upon this Perpendicular Plain appears by the Construction to be no less than minutes or Geographical Mibes on each side of the Moons Path or Miles in all w  ch  correspond to many more on the Spherical Surface of the Earth Nor is it all confind as you may see here to that Surface but reaches▪ off a greatway into the empty Space beyond it Northward The Lines which distinguish that breadth on each side into parts denote so many Digits of the Suns Eclipses besides ⅓ for the Total shade the places both as to Long▪ ▪ Lat where the sun will at any Time be so much Eclipsed And indeed I would willingly have procured a general Map here to have▪ shewd over what Countries and Places the intire Shadow would pass as Doctor Halley has given us a particular Map of England for the Passage of the Total Shadow over it But the nature of the Construction does not admit of that Projection Such a Thing cannot be truly represented any other way than by the Copernicus where there is a real Globe of the Earth capable of a Diurnal motion during the time of the Eclipse the imposibility of which in all Perspective Projections of the Sphere renders that designs otherwise impracticable Nor can I determin by this Construction whether the▪ Eclipse will be Total at London or not because the Circles of the Sun and Moon at the Southern Limit seem here exactly coincident But if we go by a Construction according to our Calculation the Digits Eclipsed at London will be hardly more than ⅘ and the Shadow▪ will go full Miles more Northward than in D  r  Halleys Map  So that y  e  Middle of the General Eclipse in common or apparent Time▪ will be after Nine in the Morning▪ differing from D  r  Halley's Computation near min But Note that the Construction is accommodated to the D  rs  Calculation  Note also that hence the breadth of the Shadow of Total Darkness will be Geographical Miles and that its length on the Oblique Horizon of London will be near Miles as D  r  Halley's Description asserts  But it must be here Observed that if in this Calculation the that and  th  New Equations of the Moon taken from S Isaac Newton's Theory were neglected this Calculation would be much nearer to D  r  Halley's as it is now nearer to M  r  Flamsteed's This Eclipse if the Air prove clear for exact Observations will go agreat  ay to determin how far those Equations are just and how far they are necessary in the Calculation of the New and Full Moons and of Eclipses that happen only at those Times S  t  Isaac Newton's third Equation w  ch  is no more than to be Substr  ted is here omitted as very inconsiderable     Moon's mean Motion

Eclipses both Solar and Lunar mentioned by  Pliny Nat Hist  II and by him only of all the Ancients is the Interval of ° Synodical Months = Days or =  Julian  Years with Days when the Cycle  or Period contains LeapYears and with Days when with Hours ′ ¼ In which Time the direct mean Motion of the  Moon  and her  Apogee  in the Ecliptick is nearly so much  more  and the Retrograde mean Motion of the  Nodes  nearly so much  less  than entire Revolutions as the mean Motion of the  Moon from the Sun  upon which all mean  Conjunctions Oppositions and Eclipses properly depend exceeds the like entire Revolutions Which Coincidences do therefore nearly restore the mean State of the Moon it self its Apogee▪ Nodes and Lunations And produce an eminent Revolution of correspondent New Moons  ull Moons and Eclipses after that Interval perpe  lly  This appears by the following Calculation of all these mean Motions from the Astronomical Tables  Mean Motion of the Sun or Earth     s  °  ′  ″  Years

of the Apogee        Substract that of the Moon in the Eclipt        Remains°⌊        To the mean Motion of the Moon          Add that of the Node          Sum          Difference from Signs °⌊          Whence it appears that the Difference of the mean Motions of the Apogee and of the Nodes from that of the Moon her self in the Ecliptick in such a Period is but small Not more in the former Case than ° ′″ = °⌊ nor in the latter than ′ ″ = °⌊ Whence also it appears that the Lunar Apogee does in every such Cycle differ but  of the entire Difference ⌊ That the Lunar Node only differs in that Cycle  of the entire Difference °⌊ And that the Anomaly of the Sun it self differs only  of the entite Anomaly ⌊ Which Quantities being generally small cannot occasion any great Inequality in the Times and Circumstances of New and Full Moons or of Eclipses▪ nor by consequence greatly disturb the regular Succession of the same in any single Period nor indeed very greatly in several successive Periods For since the mean Motion of the  Moon from the Sun  is within a very small Matter ever certain and invariable that Revolution is always just and always determines the mean Time of all Conjunctions Oppositions and Eclipses rightly and since the other Anomalies are but small and always come right again in Length of Time they cannot ever produce any  very great Anomalies in our Calculations from them As will farther appear under the following  Scholia  N B  This Period for Eclipses has of late been called both by Mr  Flamsteed  and Dr  Halley  the  Saros  or the  Chaldean Saros  As if it were known and us'd by the old  Chaldeans  and thence called by that Name For which I know no sufficient Foundation There is indeed a gross Mistake of  Pliny  's Number in  Suidas  who thus applies this term for Months as almost all the Editions of  Pliny  still have it and He calls that Period by this  Chaldean  Name  Saros  Yet the  Chaldeans  never that we find apply'd it to any other Period than that of  Years  or  Days  by which Period alone all the Antediluvian Reigns are determined both in  Abydenus  and  Berosus  themselves from the anc  entest Records of that Kingdom See my  New Theory  the later Editions  Hypoth  X  Lem  to the third Argument and  Appendix  to the  Essay  towards restoring the true Text of the Old Testament  p    SCHOLIA  We may here Observe that since the Limit for Eclipses of the Moon is about ° ′ = ′ on each Side of the Node as is the Limit for Eclipses of the Sun about ° ′ = ′ If we divide the Limit of the Moon's Eclipses by ′ ″ = ′⌊ which is the Difference between the Revolution of the Moon to the Sun and of the Node above given we shall have nearly Twenty Five for the Number of Cycles after a Central Lunar Eclipse in one  of the Nodes before the Moon goes off the Shadow of the Earth entirely at the same Node and Years {multiplier} = or double that Number Years for the Time that the Moon begins to enter the Ecliptick Limit on one Side till it goes out of it on the other During which long Interval there will still be Eclipses of the Moon each Period And if we divide ′ the Limit of the Sun's Eclipses by the same Number ′⌊ we shall have nearly for the Number of Periods after a Solar Central Eclipse at the Middle of the Earth in one of the Nodes before the Penumbra goes off the  North  or  South  Parts of the Disk of the Earth entirely at the same Time  i e  Years {multiplier} = or double that Number Years from the Time that the Moon in any such Period begins to enter the Ecliptick Limit on one Side till it goes out of on the other During which longer Interval there will still be somewhere Eclipses of the Sun each Period After which respective long Intervals of Time there will be no such Eclipses for much longer Intervals  Since the utmost Latitude of the Moon that can permit any Lunar Eclipse is about ′ and the same utmost Latitude that can permit a Solar Eclipse is about ′ If we divide the first Number by or the last by the Numbers of Revolutions for the Ecliptick Limits we shall have about ′⌊ = ′″ for the mean Alteration of the Moon's Latitude in each single Period all along and this both for Solar and Lunar Eclipses Which Latitude will be  South  during the one half of the long Period of the Ecliptick Limits beforementioned and  North  during the other half Gradually increasing  and as gradually decreasing perpetually As in the following Table  A Table of the mean Latitudes of the Moon each single Cycle either  North  or  South  beginning at an Eclipse in one of the Nodes without any Latitude at all  Latitudes for    Cycles in Lunar and    in Solar Eclipses  Cycles  ′  ″                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Since the principal Alteration in the Quantity and Duration of total Eclipses of the Sun arises from the Difference there is at any Time between the real Distances and apparent Diameters of the Sun and Moon at the Time of such Eclipses that Quantity and Duration must depend on the Difference of their mean Anomalies which gives us that Difference of Distances and Diameters and must therefore answer in each Cycle one with another to the Differences of those mean Anomalies during that Interval which in the Sun comes to °⌊ or ⌊ of its entire Anomaly And in the Moon to  ▪  or  of its entire Anomaly And since the whole mean Excentricity of the Moon is somewhat above three Times as great as that of the Sun or as  to The Differences of the Sun's Distances and Diameters will be but a little greater in each Period one with another than those of the Moon  When therefore the Anomalies of the Sun and Moon are of the same Species I mean both ascending or both descending their Distances and Diameters will one with another increase or decrease nearly in the same Proportion and the Quantity and Duration of total Darkness will alter but little in such a Period But when those Anomalies are of the contrary Species that is the one ascending while the other descends they will alter considerably So that if the Sun be descending and its apparent Diameter Increasing while the Moon is ascending and its apparent Diameter Decreasing the Eclipse of the Sun will each succeeding Cycle afford a smaller total Shadow till at last it afford no total Shadow  at all but the Eclipses become  Annular  And if the Sun be Ascending while the Moon is Descending the contrary will happen and the total Shadow grow greater perpetually From which Circumstances of the Sun and Moon in each Revolution of the Cycle duly considered we may nearly determine whether any succeeding correspondent Eclipse will afford us a greater or less total Shadow or whether the Eclipses will be only Annular  From the like Circumstances we may also nearly determine whether such Eclipses will come somewhat sooner or later than that of the mean Revolution of the Period before us For if the Earth be much nearer its Aphelion than the Moon its Apogaeon at the end of any Cycle and by consequence if the Earth then revolve comparatively slower and the Moon swifter than ordinary the meeting of the Luminaries will be accelerated And if the Earth be much remoter from its Aphelion than the Moon from its Apogaeon the contrary will happen and the Moon will be later than ordinary e'er it overtake the Sun So that in the former Case the Eclipse will come a little  before  and in the latter a little  after  the proper Conclusion of that Period  Since the Motion of the Node backward in one of these Periods does not quite reach to the Conjunction or Opposition that Node must every Cycle go forward with respect to the Lunations and Eclipses and at the ascending Node the Moon will pass more  Southward  and at the descending Node more  Northward  successively Thus at the Solar Eclipse  May  the Moon near its ascending Node had greater  Northern  Latitude than it will have at the next corresponding Solar Eclipse  May  And thus at  the total Solar Eclipse  April  the Moon near its descending Node had less  Northern  Latitude than it will have at its corresponding great Eclipse  May    Since the Motion of the Moon's Apogee forward is greater in one of these Periods than that of the Lunations that Apogee must also go forward every Cycle And if at any one Solar Eclipse that Apogee be in quadrature with the Sun after it had been in Conjunction the Moon will the next Period descend by going backward in its Eclipses towards the Perigee And if at any one such Apogee it be in the quadrature after it had been in Opposition it will the next Cycle ascend The Reverse of all which is true in Lunar Eclipses  The Place and Motion of the Sun in its Ellipsis is so easily known and that for many Ages by bare Memory and Reflection that a few Words will suffice The Sun is now farthest from the Earth Eight Days after the longest Day and nearest to it Eight Days after the shortest And its Motion about Degree in Years Whence it is evident that it has for all the past Ages of Astronomy been about the Summer Solstice in our Apogee and about the Winter Solstice in our Perigee if I may use the T  rms of the  Ptolemaick  System Nor is it therefore any Wonder that the greatest total Eclipses of the Sun have happened still in the Summer and the g  eatest Annular ones in the Winter half Year Since the farther the Sun is off in the Winter the less must be its apparent Diameter and by consequence the greater the Excess of the Moon's Diameter above it On which Excess alone the Greatness of such Eclipses depends And the Reverse is equally evident in the Case of Annular  Eclipses in Winter Nor indeed is it very strange that Annular Eclipses are in these Parts of the World so rarely observed since they most usually happen in Winter Days which being short must afford us a proportionably small Number of them To the Inhabitants of the other Side of the Equator the Reverse must happen But those Eclipses very rarely come to our Notice  Since this Period reaches only from the middle of one general Eclipse to another without regard to the Position of any particular Place on the Earth's Surface arising from the diurnal Motion we must remember that if an Eclipse of the Sun happens at any particular Place considerably before Noon it will come sooner and after Noon later than the proper Conclusion of this Period Though it must be noted that Eclipses of the Moon being absolute in their own Nature are here wholly unconcerned and no way subject to any Acceleration Retardation or Alteration on account of the diurnal Motion of the Earth  The principal Alteration of the Time of the Day in all Eclipses depends on the Excess of this Period above an even Number of Days which is Hours and ′¼ So that the Cycle does naturally put every correspondent Eclipse later than the foregoing almost Hours or one third part of a Day which thing by reason of the intervening diurnal Motion greatly alters all Eclipses especially Solar not only as to the bare Time of the Day when but also as to the Places on the Earth where such correspondent Eclipse will be visible  If therefore we join three of these Cycles together those odd Hours and Minutes will amount nearly to a whole Day and will therefore nearly bring the middle Point of the correspondent Eclipses to the same Time in the same Place and in part with the same Circumstances as before Which a single Cycle cannot possibly do Only with the Anticipation of ′ in Time Which three single Cycles therefore of Days or of Years with or Days I call the  Grand Cycle  And this will be I think of the greatest and readiest use in remote Eclipses of any other Period whatsoever  Thus for Example there was a total Eclipse of the Sun on  Black Monday  as it has thence been called ever since  March  about Ten a Clock in the Morning  Total  I say it was in the  North  of  Ireland  and the  Northwest  of  Scotland  tho' not so at  London  ot the remoter Parts of  England  and  Scotland  To this if we add one Cycle the Time of the next correspondent Eclipse will thus be discovered     y  d  h  ′  ″  To  A D    March            Add            Sum  April            So that the correspondent total Eclipse ought to have been  A D    April  the th ′ ¼ past aClock in the Evening And because the Earth was then a small Matter nearer its Aphelion than the Moon its Apogaeon the Time would be a little anticipated on that Account But then because this Eclipse was towards Evening it would be much more retarded on that Account than anticipated on the other and the main Part of  the Eclipse would happen after Sunset and be here invisible  To this Time if we add another Cycle the next correspondent Eclipse will in like Manner be discovered     y  d  h  ′  ″  To  A D    April            Add            Sum  April            So that the next correspondent total Eclipse ought to have been  April  th ′ ½ after one in the Morning and was therefore to be sure utterly invisible to us here To this Time if we add another Cycle we have the next correspondent total Eclipse thus     y  d  h  ′  ″  To  A D    April            Add            Sum  May            So that the next correspondent total Eclipse was to have been  A D  ′ ¾ past Nine aClock in the Morning which is not much before the Time when it was observ'd here and was no other than that famous Eclipse which was total at  Cadiz Barcelona Marseilles Geneva Bern  and  Zurich  and became very remarkable for the raising of the Siege of  Barcelona  during that total Darkness Though I have been inform'd by several there present that it came to both Armies wholly unexpected till the great Darkness of the Sky forced them to attend to it Now this affords us also a remarkable Instance of the near Approximation of our  Grand Cycle  both as to Time and Place For if instead of tracing this correspondent Eclipse through the distinct Cycles we had at once taken our  Grand Cycle  of Years and Days we had come immediately to this Eclipse And by allowing the Anticipation of ′ had been within about ′ of the Calculation at  London  To this Time if we add another single Cycle we shall have the next correspondent Eclipse thus     y  d  h  ′  ″  To  A D    May            Add            Sum  May            So that we ought hence to expect the total Eclipse next  May  ′ past in the Afternoon And because both the Position of the Sun and Moon in their Ellipses and the more considerable Alteration from the Time of the Day which is here much farther in the Evening than the last was in the Morning oblige us to suppose about  h  ¾ Retardation we hence justly expect that this Eclipse will be the nearest Total at  London  about ′ past Six in the Evening as the exactest Calculations do determine  If we would now trace a few Lunar Eclipses by this Cycle we may do it according to the following Examples  A D    Feb  about ′ past aClock at Night Mr  Flamsteed  observ'd the Middle of a great and total Eclipse of the Moon at  Greenwich  Proceed therefore as is already directed to find the next correspondent Eclipse of the Moon thus  y  d  h  ′  ″  To  A D    February            Add            Sum  Febr            So that this first correspondent total Eclipse of the Moon ought to have been  Feb  ′ ¼ past Six aClock in the Morning or in the daytime and so must needs have been in great Part to us invisible     y  d  h  ′  ″  To  A D    Feb            Add            Sum  March            So that the next correspondent total Eclipse of the Moon ought to have been  March    ′ ½ after Two aClock in the Afternoon which was in the daytime also and so must equally with the former have been here invisible     y  d  h  ′  ″  To  A D    March            Add            Sum  March            So that the next total correspondent Eclipse of the Moon is hence to be expected  A D    March    h  ¾ past aClock at Night which is about an Hour and half sooner than the Calculation Which difference we shall presently find to be near the greatest Difference that can happen  This may also be equally obtain'd by one entire  Grand Cycle  of Years and Days with the forementioned Anticipation of ′ which from  Feb    h  ′ brings us directly to  March  ′ past aClock at Night or to somewhat above an Hour and half before the Calculation  N B  As to the proper Quantity of the several Alterations arising in each Period which ought to be allowed for they are nearly these The Moon and Sun being about ′ ⅔ in Diameter and the Digits of their Observation being while the Difference of the Moon's Latitude as we have seen is about ′ ″ or the Twelfth Part of those Diameters it is plain that the mean natural Alteration of every Period in the same Circumstances is about one Digit though less in the lesser and greater in greater Latitudes which in the Moon whose Eclipse is to all Spectators the same holds constantly And though the diurnal Motion of the Earth removes all particular Places so much each Period as to render this Rule less observable in Solar Eclipses yet after each grand Period which nearly restores their former Position it will hold in a good Degree there also I mean so as to alter about Digits therein But besides that of the Digits eclipsed we ought also to see what Alteration in Time may happen to each Period Now as to the Inequality of the Sun's Motion it is as we have seen °⌊ and its greatest Velocity is at the Earth's Perihelion and its least at its Aphelion Its greatest Alteration therefore must be in  Aphelio  and  Perihelio  and is the Difference of the Equation belonging every where to the Addition of °⌊ and is here ″ which Space the Earth  goes in about ′ of Time So that the Difference of Time on this Account must each Period be some Quantity less than ′ And as to the Inequality of the Moon's Motion it is also greatest at the Perigee and Apogee and its greatest Alteration at the extreme Eccentricities of its Orbit is the Difference of the Equations at ° ′ ½ in Perigee and Apogee according to those extreme Eccentricities = ′ which the Moon usually goes in somewhat less than ′ So that the Difference of Time on this Account must each Cycle be some Quantity less than Minutes also  And now we come to the principal Alteration in Time that can happen in Eclipses though it belongs only to those of the Sun And that is the Time of the Day when they happen in any particular Place Now because the Center of the Moon usually goes over an entire Diameter of the Disk of the Earth in about three Hours and an half Part of which is almost always before and Part after Noon while the odd Hours of a small Cycle  h  ′ ¼ may reach equally from a Forenoon to an Afternoon's successive Eclipse 'tis possible such an Eclipse may appear an Hour and three Quarters later than the Period it self would determine it Tho' usually this Alteration will not be near so great especially when the Latitude of the Moon is very considerable But then it is so easy to allow very nearly for this Inequality upon a little Consideration that it ought not to be objected against the Accuracy of this Period If for Six Hours from Noon we allow about an Hour and half and for two Hours three Quarters of an Hour we shall not err very much from the true Time  Corollary  If we would know what is the greatest Inequality in Digits and Time in a grand Period made up of Three common ones or of Years or Days besides the constant Anticipation of ′ we must say it may possibly though it will very rarely be almost thrice the Quantities already stated for a single Cycle excepting the last and principal Difference peculiar to Solar Eclipses which is never much greater than that already mentioned  N B  If any are not contented to know these Matters by such Approximations but desire the utmost Accuracy they must either make use of Dr  Halley  's Equations fitted to this Cycle when published or rather make use of Mr  Flamsteed  's or Dr  Halley  's most accurate Astronomical Tables when published with that Trigonometrical Calculation afterward which I publish and exemplify in this Paper In the former Part of which Work this Cycle with its proper Equations will at least save us the one half of our Calculation if it will not bring us it self to that utmost Accuracy which indeed is hardly to be expected from it  So that upon the whole If we duly consider the particular Circumstances of the Sun and Moon with those of the Aphelion Apogee and Node and with the Times of the Day or Night when the Cycle ends and rightly apply them to this single Cycle and to this grand Cycle we shall be able nearly to determine the correspondent Eclipses with very small Trouble or Calculation  II  The Plane in which the Center of the Moon moves in Eclipses is not that of the Ecliptick but of the Orbit of the Moon consider'd with the Annual Motion Or it is a Plane inclined to the Plane of the Ecliptick in an Angle of about ° ′ Which in the Calculation of Eclipses is usually stiled  The Angle of the Moon's visible Way  This principal Plane I call  The Lunar Plane  III  This  Lunar Plane  cuts the Sphere of the Earth considered without its diurnal Motion in a Circle whose Pole or Vertex is distant from the Pole of the Ecliptick in the same Angle This Circle I call  The Lunar Circle  IV  In Eclipses which happen at the Solstices and in the Nodes of the Moon's Orbit the Distance of these Poles is exactly  Eastward  or  Westward  In those which happen at the Equinoxes and Nodes the Distance is exactly  North  and  South  But in all other Cases it is Oblique  V  The Angle of that Obliquity is always compos'd of the Distance of the Sun and Moon from the Solstitial Colure with the Distance of the same from the Nodes And is sometimes the  Sum  and sometimes the  Difference  of those Quantities  VI  The Distance between this Vertex and the Pole of the Earth when Eclipses happen at the Solstices is the  Sum  or  Difference  of the two forementioned Angles of Inclination the one of the Pole of the Equator and of the Pole of the Ecliptick = ° ′ the other of the Pole of the Ecliptick and of the Vertex of the Lunar Circle = ° ′ nearly But in all other Cases a Spherical Triangle must be solv'd in order to find that Distance Of which hereafter  VII  Since the Solstitial Colure is a great Circle that is also a Meridian or passes through the Poles of the Earth and Ecliptick And since besides the Distance between the Vertex of the Lunar Circle and the Pole of the Earth we shall want the Angle included between the Colure and that Line this also must be obtained by the like Solution of a Spherical Triangle Of which hereafter  VIII  Since the great Circle that passes thro' the Poles of the Earth▪ and of the Lunar Circle and that alone cuts both those Circles and their Parallels at Right Angles That Meridian and that alone wherein that Distance lies is perpendicular to the  Path of the Moon's Center  along the other and will determine the Point in that Path wherein  Center of the Shadow cuts that Meridian at R ght▪Angles and approaches nearest of all to the Pole of the Earth And indeed lays the Found  o  of our future Calculations This Meri  I call  The Primary Meridian  IX  The angular Distance about the Pole of the Earth of the Meridian that is directed to the Sun at the middle Point of the whole Eclipse from the primary Meridian is composed of the  Sum  or  Difference  of the Angle made by the Solstitial Colure and the primary Meridian and of the Complement of the Sun's Right Ascension at the middle of the general Solar Eclipse Which Angle is of the greatest Consequence in our future Calculations This Angle I call  the Primary Angle  X  Since the Motion of the Center of the Shadow of the Moon in Solar Eclipses is nearly even and nearly rectilinear since it is also in the Plane of the Lunar Circle and is all one as if it were along a Line that touched that Circle at the Middle of the general Eclipse the Point of Contact we must divide each Quadrant of Degrees into or unequal Parts but so that the  Difference  of the Sines of those unequal Angles may be equal and  or  of the entire Radius That so the first Sine    may be the second the third  c and this from the Table of natural Sines with their corresponding Arcs or Angles at the Vertex as follows  Arcs  D ff Sines Equal  Arcs  Diff Sine  Equal  Diff  °  ′  Diff  °  ′  ⌊

Vertex of the Lunar Circle on each Side of the Point of Contact by Reason of the perpendicular Situation of that Axis to its own Circle are always right Angles Only diminish'd in the Proportion of the Minutes describ'd by the Annual Motion during the Continuance of the Eclipse Thus in our present Eclipse which retains the Center of the Shadow near three Hours upon the Earth's Disk in which Time the annual Motion amounts to about ′ each of those right Angles in Strictness are to be esteem'd only ° ′ and both together ° ′ Only because the Refraction of the Rays of the Sun through our Atmosphere requires a somewhat greater Increase of this Angle than the annual Motion requires its Diminution I shall wholly omit it in all my Calculations hereafter  XIII  The Angles made at the Poles of the Earth which shew the Difference of the two extreme Meridians and limit the Extent of the entire central Eclipse by reason of the Obliquity of the Earth's Axis to that Lunar Circle are usually unequal to one another and more or fewer than twice ° as the Eclipse happens at different Latitudes of the Moon and Times of the Year  XIV  The Meridian that passes through the Middle or Central Point of general Solar Eclipses is the same with that which passes through the Center of the Sun at the same Time when the Moon has no Latitude and the Eclipses are Central in the Plane of the Ecliptick as also when they happen in either Solstices Otherwise the Moon's Latitude being taken perpendicular to the Plane of the Ecliptick and the nearest Distance of the Moon's Motion being taken perpendicular to the Lunar Circle while the Meridians always pass through the Poles of the Earth these Two Meridians will generally speaking be different and their included Angle no otherwise to be known than by Trigonometry as will appear hereafter  XV  The Dimensions of the Penumbra or entire Eclipse and the Extent of the total Shadow on the Earth are continually different according to the different Elevations of the Sun and Moon above any particular Horizon For as the Moon is about the same Distance from every Place when it is in its Horizon as it is from the Earth's Center  it self with regard to which Center alone our first Calculations are always made So when it is in the Zenith of any Place it is one Semidiameter of the Earth nearer it which Semidiameter being usually and at our next Eclipse ⌊ of its entire Distance as will appear hereafter will deserve an Allowance Nor will any lesser Elevation of the Moon be wholly inconsiderable in Eclipses but in all accurate Determinations thereof must be particularly computed in order to the distinct Knowledge of the Extent of such Eclipses especially of the Breadth of the Total Shadow therein Accordingly we are to observe that this Breadth of the Total Shadow will certainly be at this Eclipse considerably greater over  North America  where the Luminaries are greater elevated above the Horizon than over  Europe  where they are much nearer it as this Calculation requires Of which hereafter  XVI  The  Figure  of the entire  Penumbra  or general Eclipse and of the  Umbra  or Total Darkness as they appear upon every Country is different on account of the different Obliquity of every Horizon and will make Ovals or Ellipses of different Species perpetually This in the vast  Penumbra  is best understood by such an Instrument as my  Copernicus  or by the Perusal of a very scarce Book written by  P Coursier Philos Transact  N  o  p and cited by Dr  Halley  Which distinctly treats of the Intersection of a Conical and Spherical Surface But in the smaller  Umbra  or Total Darkness which is confined to a much narrower Compass it very nearly approaches to the Intersection of a conick Surface with a Plane which is a true Ellipsis  XVII  The  Species  of that Ellipsis depends on the Sun's Altitude above the Horizon at the Time of Total Darkness as does the  Position  of its longer Axis on the Azimuth of the Sun at the same Time Nor is it at all necessary that the Direction of this or any other Ellipsis should be along either of the Axes but may as well be along any other Diameter whatsoever  XVIII  The  Direction  of the Center of the Shadow is according to the Direction of the Moon's Motion along the Plane of the Lunar Circle as compounded with the diurnal Motion or with the Direction and Velocity of those Parts of the Earth over which it passes and will be hereafter brought to Calculation And indeed this Angle may be had either by finding the several Points of the Path of the Moon's Way upon the Earth in as many Meridians as we please and drawing a curve Line through those Points or by solving a Spherical Triangle whose Sides are the Complements of the Latitudes of two neighbouring Places equally distant  East  and  West  from the Place you work for and whose included Angle is the Angle at the Pole suited to the Difference of their Meridians and taking half the the two Angles at the Base the one internal and the other external for the Angle desir'd▪ Of which hereafter  XIX  Every Ellipsis made by the oblique Section of a Cone has the Intersection of the  Fig  Axis of the Cone  C  at some Distance from the Center of  the Ellipsis  D  And the Proportion of those unequal Divisions  B C  and  C A  are the same with that of the Sides of the Cone  V B  and  V A  As appears by the  Elem  III Elements of  Euclid  Whence it is evident that the proper Center of the total Shadow in Eclipses of the Sun or that made by the Axis of the Cone is not the same with the Center of the Elliptick Shadow and that the Proportion of its Distance from that Center may be easily determin'd by the Proposition here refer'd to Of which more hereafter  Scholium  This Ellipsis when the Sun is of a considerable Altitude is almost an exact one but when the Sun is near the Horizon it will be very long and so less exact because the Spherical Surface of the Earth is at that Distance more remote from a Plane  XX  The perpendicular  Breadth  of the Shadow is neither that of the longer nor that of the shorter Axis But that of the two longest Perpendiculars  Fig    A B  and  C D  drawn from the Tangents parallel to the Diameter  D B  along which the Direction of the Motion is The length of which Perpendiculars will be hereafter determined  XXI  The  Velocity  of the Motion of the Center of the Shadow is unequal not only on account of the Difference of the Moon's own Motion at the beginning and ending of the entire Eclipse which indeed is very inconsiderable but chiefly by reason of the Difference of the Obliquity of  the Horizon all the Way of its Passage However since the several Points may in all Meridians be distinctly found by Trigonometry as we shall shew presently this Inequality need create us no new Difficulty in the Determination of Eclipses  XXII  The Number of  Digits  eclips'd which are twelfth Parts of the Sun's Diameter with sexagesimal Parts of the same Digits are always to be estimated as distinct from the total Shadow and may be discovered by the help of the foregoing Table p Where the Digits are already noted at every proper Distance from the Path of the Moons Center and where the intermediate Fraction  ⌊ is more exact than  but which by dividing that Number  ⌊ by ⌊ will give those Sexagesimals without any farther Trouble The Application of that Table will be taught hereafter  XXIII  The  Distance  of the Vertex of the conical Shadow of the Moon which sometimes just reaches the Surface of the Earth as in total Eclipses  sine morâ  Sometimes does not reach it as in Annular Eclipses and sometimes would overreach it if it were not intercepted as in total Eclipses  cum morâ  may be easily discovered at any time by the Analogy following As  P C  the  Fig  Semidiameter of the Moon = geographical Miles is to  CV  the Distance of the Moon from that Vertex = ∷ So is  R s  = the smallest Semidiameter of the total Shadow which is the same as of the circular Shadow it self to  s V  the Distance of that Vertex therefrom  = which is thus ∷  XXIV  The Determination of the Circumstances of Solar Eclipses for any given Distance from the Path of the Moon's Center either way has no new Difficulty in it but is to be made just as is that for the Center of the Penumbra Only the Quantity of the Distance of the Vertex of the Lunar Plane from that Circle will be different as the Path of the Moon's Center it self might be at another Eclipse of otherwise the same Circumstances  XXV  If Two Bodies  A  and  B  set out together the one from  A  the other from  B  and move evenly forward in a known Proportion as to Velocity the Point C will be determined where the swifter will overtake the slower and they will be coincident Thus if the Velocity of  A Fig  be to that of  B  as to the Proportion of the Lines  A B  to  B C  will be as to and if we add to = we have the place  C  where the swifter will overtake the slower Thus if their Velocities be to each other as ⌊ to the Lines of their Motion  A B  and  B C  will be as ⌊ to So that if we take in the former Case ¼ of  A B  and in the other ⌊  of  A B  and add it to  A B  we gain  AC  the Distance of the Point  C  from  A  Corollary  If therefore  A  represent the Center of the Shadow of a Solar Eclipse as it is plac'd at the Middle of the general Eclipse and B  Greenwich  at the same Moment of absolute Time and at a known Distance from the middle  Point and if the Velocity of the Center of the Shadow along the Circle be to the Velocity of  Greenwich  in its diurnal Motion as  to if we ad ⌊ of their Distance at their setting out to that known Distance we obtain the Point or Place where the Center of the Eclipse will overtake  Greenwich  or the Time when the Eclipse will be at the Meridian of  Greenwich  And this whether the Center and  Greenwich  move along the same Line as  A B C  or two different Lines as  A B C  and  a b c  XXVI  The Duration of Solar Eclipses is different according as their Middle happe  s about Six in the Morning or Evening or a  out Noon or about any intermediate Time If that happens about Six aClock Morning or Evening the diurnal Motion then neither much conspires with nor opposes the proper Motion of the Center of the Shadow and the Duration is almost the same as it would be if the Earth had no diurnal Motion at all If that happens about Noon the diurnal Motion most of all conspires with that proper Motion of the Center and makes the Duration of the Eclipse the longest possible If it happens in the intermediate Times the diurnal Motion in a less Degree conspires with the other Motion and makes the Duration of a me  n Quantity between that of the other Cases But if it happens considerably be  ore Six aClock in the Morning or after Six aClock in the Evening the diurnal Motion is backward and short  ns that Duration proportionably Of the Quantity of which Duration we shall enquire more hereafter  PROBLEMS

assign'd  Latitude  and by a very small Allowance when the very middle of the Eclipse or of Total Darkness happens in any Place very near the same  Corollary  The same Branch determines the true  Difference of Meridians  in all Places over or near which the Center of the Eclipse passes and so the Distance  East  and  West  from any known Meridian whatsoever Thus because the Meridians of  Paris Greenwich  and  Dublin  do hence appear to be different as to the Angles of the Pole from the Primary Meridian in the foregoing Angles ° ′ ° ′ and ° ′ respectively It is plain that the respective  Longitude  of  Paris  and  Greenwich  when reduc'd from Angles of the Pole to the Difference of Meridians is ° ′ and that of  Greenwich  and  Dublin  ° ′ and by Consequence of  Paris  and  Dublin  ° ′ Which is no other than the Foundation of my grand  Problem  of  Discovering the Geographical  Longitude  of Places by Solar Eclipses from the  Latitude  given  Of which more hereafter  XV  To find the Duration of a Solar Eclipse along or near the Path of the Moon's Center in any Place whatsoever  From the Motion of the Moon from the Sun gain the Duration of the entire Eclipse or the Time of that Center's Passage over the Diameter of the Penumbra if there were no diurnal Motion during that Time thus  As the horary Motion of the Moon from the Sun which is in angular Measure ° ′ and is given in the Calculation to an Hour or ′ in Time∷ So let the Diameter of the Penumbra there given also in angular Measure = ° ′ be to a fourth Number which will be the Number of Minutes requir'd In Decimals thus ′⌊′∷′⌊′⌊=  h  ⅘  But then because the diurnal Motion of the Earth must be compounded with this rectilinear Motion of the Moon and that as we have already stated it this Eclipse will cross the Meridian of  Greenwich  ′ past aClock in the Evening the one Part of the Duration of the Eclipse being before and the other Part after that Time both Intervals must be unequally affected by the diurnal Motion and we must then take the former halfDuration ′ ″ distinctly And since the diurnal Motion of  Greenwich  is in a larger Parallel than that of the Center of the general Eclipse while its Obliquity to the Path of the Shadow's Center increases their respective Motions will nearly keep the same Proportion all along and so we may safely omit the Consideration of them both We have also already discovered that the Velocity of this Center's Motion is here to that of the Velocity of the diurnal Motion As ⌊ to ⌊ or as ⌊ to And because the Eclipse begins about ′ before ′ after balances the same and these Minutes are almost all one as if there were no diurnal Motion at all So that we have only ′ ″ capable of Retardation in the first half The middle Time of which will be about ′ after We must therefore look into the Table  p  for the  Arc  ½ o  its Supplement  corresponding to ¼ of the Sines Where the Difference of half a Degree is instead of ⌊ as about Noon no less than which multiplied by ⌊ comes to So that the Motion is here retarded a th Part Say then As to so is ⌊ to ⌊ which ⌊ or ′ ″ is to be added to the before excepted for the Duration of the former Part of the Eclipse = ′ ″ The Middle of the second Part will be about = °¼ backward  beyond ° that is ° ¾ of the Arc which corresponds to ° ½ of the Sines where the Difference of half a Degree is °  This multiplied by ⌊ gives So that the Retardation is as ⌊ to or to ⌊ Say then As ⌊ to ⌊ so is ⌊ to ⌊ = ′ ″ which is the Duration of the latter Part of the Eclipse and added to the former Part of the Duration gives us the whole Duration = ′ ″ =  h  ′ ″ without the Consideration of the Elevation of the Luminaries above the Horizon which a small Matter enlarges that Duration Of which hereafter  N B  If we would be still more precisely nice we may distinctly allow for the Difference of the Parallels and the different Obliquity of the Direction of which  p  before Which yet are here omitted as very inconsiderable  XVI  To find the Duration of the Total Darkness along the Path of the Moon's Center if the Luminaries were in the Horizon  Say As the Moon's Motion from the Sun in an Hour or ′ in the Calculation = ′ ″ is to those ′ So is the Difference of the Diameters of the Sun and Moon in the same Calculation = ′ ″ to a fourth Number Which will be the entire Duration of the Total Darkness if the Luminaries were not at all elevated above the Horizon In Decimals thus ′⌊′∷′⌊′⌊=′″⅔  XVII  To find the Altitude of the Sun above the Horizon when the Center of the Shadow crosses the Meridian at  Greenwich  In the Triangle  Fig    Z P S Z P  is = Distance between the Zenith and Pole of the Earth ° ′  P S  is = Distance between the Pole of the Earth and Center of the Sun = Complement of the Sun's Declination or to ° ′ And the Angle  Z P S  = interval of Time from the Meridian =  h  ′ = ° ′ whose Supplement is ° ′  Say then  R                            °  ′                    CSZ P S                      TZ P             °  ′        T P R  =      =    =  P R                 +    =  P S                 =    =  R S  And     °  ′                       CS P R                         CS Z

any Solar Eclipse extends to in a plain Perpendicular to the Axis of the Penumbra  When the Parallax of the Moon is ′ ″ which is near its mean Quantity the Moon's Distance is Semidiameters of the Earth And one Second on the Disk of the Earth as viewed at the Distance of the Moon or on the Disk of the Moon viewed at the Distance of the Earth is exactly one geographical Mile And ″ or one Minute is one Degree upon the Disk of the Earth or Moon But when the Moon's Parallax as in the Calculation of this Eclipse is ′ ″ whose Sine is or ⌊ of the Radius nearly One Second is less than a Mile and that in the Proportion of ⌊ to So that about geographical Miles correspond to ″ or one Minute And accordingly such Miles will correspond to ′ ″ which in that Calculation is the Semidiameter of the Penumbra or the utmost perpendicular Extent of the Eclipse  N B  We may always make use of the foregoing Tables  pag  for the perpendicular Distances from the Path of the Moon's Centre at all Durations of the Eclipses and of Total Darkness by still calling the Radius of every  Penumbra  equal Parts or Miles and the Radius of every  Umbra  or Total Shadow such Parts or Miles and using them accordingly And this without any other Inconvenience than the Supposition of other than geographical Miles Which Inconvenience by the Reduction of them to geographical Miles afterwards will always as here come to nothing  XX  To find the Alteration there is in the Extent and Duration of Eclipses and of total Darkness on Account of the Elevation of the Luminaries at that Time above the Horizon  This is ever as the Radius to the Sine of the Sun's Altitude As compared with the particular Distance of the Moon at that Time Thus at the Middle of this Eclipse at  Greenwich  the Altitude of the Sun has been found to be ° ′ whose Sine is which divided by ′⌊ is equal to ½ of the whole And in the Semidiameter of the  Penumbra  as well as  Umbra  amounts to about Miles every Way Thus also at the Middle of the Eclipse in  NorthAmerica  where 'tis Central at Noon the Sun will be about °▪ above the Horizon whose Sine is which divided by ⌊ is  nearly which in the same Semidiameters amounts to about Miles every way And for the Duration at  Greenwich  add to the common Duration already found or to  h  ′ ″ the Part of the same or about ⅓ of a Minute both ways which is about  in the whole which will bring the entire Duration from  h  ′ ″to full  h  ′ and for Total Darkness will add about of the whole total Darkness = ″ and increase the Duration from ′ ⅔ to ′ ″  But for the Alteration in  North America  which is about  both ways or in the whole this will there increase the entire Duration ′ ″ and from  h  ′ ″ bring it to  h  ′ ″ and for the total Darkness will add about of the whole or bring the ′ ″ ⅔ to ′ ″  XXI  To find the Species and Dimensions of the Ellipsis made by the Total Shadow at the same Places and Altitudes  The shorter Axis of the Ellipsis which is the same with the Diameter of the Conick Shadow it self in a Plane Perpendicular to the Axis is to the Longer as the Sines before▪mentioned Or at  Greenwich  as to and at  North America  as to And since that  horter Axis is in the Calculation Minutes or Miles of to a Degree they must be equal to Geographical Miles which by the last Problem must be increas'd to and to respectively The golden Rule will therefore soon shew the Length of the longer Axis of the Shadow in both Places     sine  rad  miles  miles  For  Greenwich    ∷      For  NorthAmerica    ∷      XXII  To determine the central Point in

Parts of the longer Axis being found the larger  C A  = Miles the lesser  B C  = Miles The half of which  D C  is the Distance between the central Point of the Shadow  D  and the Center of the Ellipsis  C  = ½ Miles  XXIII  To determine the Angle of Direction of the Total Shadow over the Meridian of  Greenwich  This to be done either by Construction upon drawing the Curve Line of this Motion through the several Points where by Calculation the Center of the Shadow crosses the Meridians of  Paris Greenwich▪  and  Dublin  and measuring the Angle it makes with the several Meridians or more exactly for  Greenwich  by solving the Triangle  Fig    P V O  where the Arc  V O  is equally distant  West  as  Paris  is  East  from  Greenwich  is to be found by the Method already made use of thus  Paris  Angle at the Pole = ° ′ Angle for  O V  at the Pole is less by twice the Difference of the Angles at the Pole for  Paris  and  Greenwich  = ° ′ And ° ′ ° ′ = ° First then find the Arc  V O  = Compl Latitude for O as in  Probl  XIV by this Analogy  R                         °  ′                 CS  Q P C                   T  P V             °  ′     T  P R      =      Then say  °  ′                 CS  P V                   CS  P R                   CS  V C                                   °  ′  CS  P C      =                  Deduct                  Rem  t    V O                  V G                  V P      Then in the Triangle  V O  P whose included Angle is ° ′ and whose two Sides are ° ′ and ° ′ Find the Arc  P R  as usual thus  R                         °  ′                 CS  O V R                   T  V O             °  ′     T  V R      =                  from                  Remn  t  ° ′ = PR  Then for the Angle  VPO  say     °  ′                 S  P R                   S  V R                   T  O V R                                   °  ′  T  V P O  =      =      And for  V O R     °  ′                 S  V O                   S  V P O                   S

Center of the Shadow makes with the Meridian of  Greenwich  is ° ′ ½ And by consequence the Angle it makes with the Parallel of Latitude there is ° ′ ½ or Degrees mo  e than in Dr  Halley  's Scheme  Corollary  The longer Axis of the total Shadow at the Meridian of  Greenwich  makes an Angle of ° ′ ½ with the Direction of the Shadow  for if from the Angle that the Directi  n of the Center of the Shadow makes with the Parallel of  Greenwich    ½  We deduct the Angle that the longer Axis makes with the same Parallel which is the Azimuth formerly discovered      There remains this Angle    ½  XXIV  To D termine the perpendicular Breadth of the Total Shadow when that Shadow is nearest to  London  or when the central Point is about the Meridian of  Padsto  in  Cornwall  This  Problem  is In an Ellipsis of Miles broad and Miles long whose longer▪ Axis makes an Angle with the Direction of the Shadow of ° ½ To determine the Length of the greatest Perpendicular that falls on that Diameter along which the Direction of the Motion is For twice that Perpendicular is the Breadth required Now I have actually drawn this Ellipsis or total Shadow for my Map of this Eclipse And I find by that Construction that the Breadth of the total Shadow over  England  is about Miles or Miles broader than in Dr  Halley  's Scheme Time will probably discover which is nearest the Truth  N B  This total Shadow increases so greatly in Length as it goes  Eastward  that it will reach from  Paris  to the utmost Boundary of the Sunsetting at once And though the Center of the Shadow by my Calculation will end ° ⅔  East  of the Meridian of  London  in the Latitude of ° ′ or in the  Alps  not far from  Milan  and  Turi    Yet by reason of the Extension and Breadth of the total Shadow and the Refraction of the Rays of Light near the Horizon it seems probable to me that all  Switzerland  and  Lombardy  as far as  Trent Mantua Cremona  and  Parma  nay perhaps as far as  Venice Padua Bononia Ferrara Ravenna  and  Florence  may at the same Time be invelop'd in the Total Shadow and that the Sun may set eclipsed at all or most of those Places at once  XXV  To determine the Digits eclipsed and the Duration of the Eclipse or of total Darkness at  any given Distance from the Path of the Moon's Center and  vice versâ  These Digits and Durations if we do not consider the diurnal Motion are immediately found to any given Distance in the Tables  P  Thus if the Digits be or Duration ′ ″ the first Table gives us the Distance of Miles And  vice versâ  if the Distance be known to be Miles the same Table gives us Digits and ′ ″ Duration And the like is true of the total Shadow and the Distance or Duration in the second Table Thus also we learn from the Map of this Eclipse that the nearest Approach of the total Shadow to  London  will be about geographical Miles Which Miles in this Obliquity of the Motion is about perpendicular Miles So that  =  of a Digit is the Quantity of the Rim of Light that will be seen at  London  when the Eclipse is greatest And by consequence the Digits there eclipsed will be Nor does it appear to me that the total Darkness will come nearer to  London  than Miles although Dr  Halley  's Scheme brings it within or Miles As for the Duration of the entire Eclipse here it will be much the same as if it were Central And has been already determined to  h  ′ And for the total Darkness along the Path of the Center between  Exeter  and  Plimouth  its Duration will be as before stated ′ ″½  N B  As to the Alterations which will arise in more considerable Distances from the Path of the Moon's Center proceed thus First find the Minutes of Duration corresponding to any given Distance in Miles  e g  thus ∷ ′⌊ ′⌊ Or As Miles the Radius to the Sine∷ So are the Number of  Minutes for the Semidiameter of the Penumbra to the Number of Minutes for that Sine Now ′ ″ the present Length of the greatest Distance ′ ″ = ′ ″ Then compute every Thing as if the Center of the Shadow were ′ ″ Latitude or nearest Distance and as if the Chord of that Arc over the Earth's Disk were the Path of the Moon's Center and the Chord of the Distance from the Center of the Penumbra were the Diameter of the Penumbra And all will be discovered by the Rules before going without any new Directions whatsoever Only if this Distance be the contrary way to the present Example we must here make use of Addition instead of Substraction  N B  Upon confulting the  French  Ephemerides of  Des Places  recommended in some Degree by  Cassini  himself I find that he determines the Eclipse at  Paris  thus     h  ′  ″  Beginning  May    N S        Middle        End        Whence the Duration there is        Digits eclipss'd         Latitude of the Moon at the Middle  ′  ½     Difference from me in Digits         In Latitude      If these Digits and this Latitude be right Dr  Halley  and I and those  English  Astronomers that have computed and constructed this E  lipse who all I think do agree that it will be to  at  Paris  and that for two or three Miuutes also are prodigiously mistaken For if  Des Places  be in the right  Copenhagen  and  Stockholm  will stand much fairer for the Pretence to a total Eclipse  than either  Dublin London  or  Paris  Time will certainly determine who are in the right  N B  If we add the Duration of the Eclipse consider'd without Regard to the diurnal Motion to the Time of the Center of the Shadows passing over the entire Disk we gain the entire Duration of the Eclipse in general thus     h  ′  ″  To        Add        Sum        Therefore the general Eclipse by the Meridian of  London     h  ′  ″  Begins  II      Middle  V      End  VII      Duration    h      Eclipse at  London  Begins V      Middle VI      End VII  ½

his Duration at  London  about ′ longer  N B  I cannot tell the Reason why my Original Calculation of this general Eclipse which has been carefully made according to Sir  Isaac Newton  's famous  Theory of the Moon  does here so much differ from Dr  Halley  's Determination as ′ in Time especially since both those Methods did very well agree in the last celebrated total Eclipse  Apr  'Tis Time alone that can determine between these two Methods of Calculation  N B  I have lately been shewed an exact Scheme of this next Eclipse according to Mr  Flamsteed  's own Tables and Determination and made in his Lifetime wherein the Digits eclipsed are exactly according to my Determination in this Paper  A PROPOSAL For the Discovery of the LONGITUDE of the several Places of the Earth by Total Eclipses of the Sun  IT is humbly proposed That Observations be made in all Places where Solar Eclipses are seen of the exact  Duration  of the same by either viewing the Beginning and Ending thereof through a Telescope with a Glass smoaked in the Flame of a Candle for saving the Eye of the Observer or else by casting the Sun's Image through such a Telescope upon white Paper and viewing the first and last Impression of the Moon's Shadow upon it And that the Hour Minute and Second of some Pendulum Clock be carefully noted at the same Time And that when the same Observations are transmitted for the Uses of Geography the Latitudes of the Places be also set down and transmitted at the same Time That the like Observations be also made in all Places where such Eclipses are total and visible of the exact Beginning and Ending with the Duration of Total Darkness by the like Comparison of a Pendulum Clock or other pendulous Body that vibrates Seconds or half Seconds and with the Latitude be

Order to discover the LONGITUDE and LATITUDE at Sea  UPON the Receipt of the liberal Assistance of His most Excellent Majesty King  GEORGE  their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of  Wales  and many other of the Nobility and Gentry my kind Friends I sent last Year Four several DippingNeedles to Sea with Frames hung near the Center of Motion in Gimbols to avoid the Shaking of the Ship and with proper Instructions to the Masters of the Vessels And this in order to discover the State of Magnetism in the several Parts of the Globe and to find whether accurate Observations could be made at Sea and to determine whether the fundamental Theory I laid down from former Observations would hold or not  viz  "That Magnetick Variation and Dip are all deriv'd from one Spherical Magnet in the Center of our Earth with an irregular Alteration of the Variation according to the different Degrees of Strength of the several Parts of the Loadstone as compounded with a very slow Revolution from  East  to  West  And with a regular Alteration of the Dip nearly according to the Line of Sines from the Magnetick Pole to the Magnetick Equator the Axis of that Equator being sufficiently Oblique  to its Plane All which is the Case of Spherical Loadstones here"  Now having already received Four Journals from Four several Masters employ'd I take this Occasion of returning my Benefactors hearty Thanks for their Assistance and of giving them and the Publick some Account of the Success of these Observations and what Consequences are naturally to be drawn from them with the Difficulty hitherto met with in the Practice at Sea and the proper Remedy for the same in future Trials  Captain  James Jolly  set out in  July  for  Archangel  with one of my DippingNeedles on Board He for some time met with such Difficulties in the Practice as confin'd to the Frame I had given him that he was not at first able to make any good Observations at all But after some Time he took the Needle into his own Cabin and without any Approach to the Center of Motion or any Contrivance for avoiding the Shaking of the Ship at all having a clear and full Gale all along but without any stormy Weather He made me very good Horizontal Observations from the Latitude of quite to  Archangel  I say  Horizontal Observations  only as I desired him the Needle by an Accident before he went being rendred incapable of making any other with sufficient Accuracy In this Space the Needle altered its Velocity very greatly as I expected it would And Vibrations which at first were perform'd in about ″ beyond the  NorthCape  came to ″ till towards  Archangel  it gradually returned to about ″  Captain  Othniel Beal  set out about the same Time for  Boston  in  NewEngland  with the same  Instrument and made Four Observations of the Dip both by the Vertical and Horizontal Vibrations and by the Dip it self Three upon the open Sea and One in the Haven of  Boston  Which in some small Manner differed one from another but in the main agreed and kept the due Analogy I expected He greatly complained of the Shaking of the Ship till in  Boston  Haven he made a nice Observation both Ways which did not greatly differ Tho' the greatest Part of of his Observations by the Dip it self were somewhat more agreeable to Analogy than the other The Reason was I take it that as he assured me he always took great Care to avoid the Shaking of my Frame which Frame tho' it very much avoided the slower and greater Oscillation of the Ship yet made a quicker but lesser Oscillation it self Which Fault I was sufficiently sensible of just before the Ships were going away but was not able then to obviate as I am prepared to do hereafter After Captain  Beal  had made and sent me these Observations he pursued his Voyage to  Barbados  and thence to  Charles Town  in  South Carolina  at both which Places he made Observations but the best at  Barbados  For before he came to  Carolina  he observed the Axis of the Needle to shake which made him take the Dip there otherwise than he ought to have done which is the natural Occasion that the Dip there did not so well agree to Analogy as the rest However upon my Receipt of his first Journal with the Four first Observations especially the exact one at  Boston  I formed a more exact Theory of the Proportion of the Alteration of the Dip in the Spherical Magnet of the Earth and found it at this Distance of the Earth's Surface not far from that in my Spherical Loadstone at the Distance  of about of an Inch from its Surface  viz  Not exactly as the Line of Sines where at the Middle of the Line the Angles are and but rather as to Which Rule therefore is what I now propose as much nearer than the other By which Proportion I determined long beforehand the Dip at  Barbados  of ° or ° as many of my Friends can witness And when Captain  Beal  delivered me the Paper of this Observation at  Barbados  before I opened it or in the least knew what Dip it contain'd I foretold to him from that Theory the very same Dip which both himself and his Paper immediately assur'd me to be true and whose Truth as he inform'd me afterwards was confirm'd by another Observation made a little before in the open Sea of about °  Captain  Tempest  also about the same Time set out for  Antegoa  and  St Christopher  's with the same Instrument and Frame In his Letter da  ed last  January  he greatly complains of the Shaking of my Frame and proposes an Hint how it might be avoided Which Method of its Avoidance I had long before thought of and provided for accordingly and which has been a full Year ready for Practice Those Observations of his that I have yet received for I have not heard from him since  January  but hope soon to here farther were but Three and all at open Sea and but one of them made both the Ways that I desired And indeed seem the least agreeable to Analogy of any of the rest Only since that single Observation which was also made by the horizontal Vibrations and vertical Oscillations agrees very well to that Analogy since they all three are about the same  Quantity of or Degrees exceed that Analogy and since very near the same Place where the third Observation was made I have a double Observation of Captain  Beal  's to correct the same I rather conclude that Captain  Tempest  made a Mistake and placed the wrong Edge of the Needle upward in all the Three Observations Which would naturally occasion such a Difference When I receive the rest of his Observations or his Needle again I shall be able to judge better of that Matter However even these Observations agree in gross with all the rest to the gradual Decrease of the Dip as you go nearer to the Equator Tho' as they stand at present they do not determine the accurate Proportion of that Alteration so well as the others  Captain  Michel  also long after the rest set out for  Hamburgh  with the same Instrument though now without the Frame which he was not willing to incumber himself with and I suspected that in its present Contrivance it did more hurt than help the Nicety of the Experiments I also by him sent a Letter to the Reverend Mr  Eberhard  who was the Occasion of my studying this Matter and was then Pastor of  Altena  close by  Hamburgh  desiring that he would there make the Experiment very exactly and give me a particular Account of it But I have not yet received his Answer  Now the Observations here mentioned as well as those many others I had by me before do seem to me in general evidently to afford us the following Inferences  That there is one Spherical Loadstone and but one in the Center of our Earth and that this  Loadstone like other Spherical Loadstones has but one  Northern  Pole Contrary to Dr  Halley  's Hypothesis  That this  Northern  Pole is situated contrary to the same Hypothesis also a great Way to the  East  of our Meridian And indeed as I before had determined about the Middle of the Distance between the  North Cape  and  Nova Zembla  Captain  Jolly  's numerous Observations prove this most fully While in Sailing towards that Point his horizontal Vibrations greatly increas'd in Number And when he turned almost at right Angles as he went down to  Archangel  they soon diminished and yet so little after some time that it was evident he then sailed not far from a Parallel to that  Northern  Pole and not very many Degrees from it neither exactly according to my Expectations  That the absolute Power of the internal Magnet is considerably different in different Places and that without any certain Rule as it is upon the Surface of our  Terrellae  or Spherical Loadstones here This the various Number of Seconds to a vertical Oscillations and all the Accounts in the other Observations fully prove and by consequence this must cause different Variations in different Places as is the Case of our  Terrellae  That there no where appears in open Seas any such Irregularity in the Dip as we sometimes meet with near Shores or at Land and by consequence that Dr  Halley  's grand Objection against the Discovery of the Longitude by the DippingNeedle taken from an Observation of his own concerning such an Irregularity near the Shore at  Cape Verd  and from his own Hypothesis of the four Magnetick Poles is utterly groundless  Nor indeed shall I  e at Rest till▪I have sent a DippingNeedle to  Hudson's Bay  on purpose to determine this Dispute about the four Poles For that Voyage being almost directly towards his second  Northern  Pole all the way and about the same Distance all the way from mine if this Voyage afford much the same Dip it will demonstrate that there is but One  Northern  Pole and that it is nearl  where I place it But if that Dip greatly  increase  it will demonstrate a s  ond Pole somewhere in those Parts of  America  where Dr  Halley  places it And to this Decretory Experiment do I appeal for a final Determination of this Question The Doctor seems to me to draw his Inferences from the  Variation  which no Way proves any such double Poles as being full as sensible on our  Terrelle  which have no more than single ones while he avoids all Observations from the  Dip  which are still against him and which are alone capable of discovering the exact Place of such Poles either upon the Surface of the Earth or of  Terrellae  However when one Set of Experiments with a DippingNeedle sent to  Hudson's Bay  will certainly determine this Matter 'tis a vain Thing to go on in the Way of Controversy about it  In short The Observations hitherto made shew that the Foundations I go upon in this Discovery of the  Longitude  and the  Latitude  at Sea are true and right That the Terrestrial Magnetism is very regular and uniform in the open Seas that the Latitude in the  Northern  Parts may even without any Avoidance of the Shaking of the Ship in ordinary calm Weather be in good Degree thereby discovered already and that if I can sufficiently avoid the Shaking of the Ship which I am now endeavouring and have great  Hopes of performing both  Latitude  and  Longitude  may by this Method be discovered in the greatest Part of the sailing World I say nothing here of another Method of Trial which I am also pursuing and which depends like this on the avoiding the main Part of the Ship's Agitation and if effected will be more easy and universal than this But as to giving any farther Account of that to the Publick unless it succeed I have no Intention at all  N B  The original Journals are all in the Hands of my great Friend and Patron  Samuel Molyneux  Esq  Secretary to his Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales  and Fellow of the Royal Society Which Journals when I have compleated the rest of the Observations I hope to procure I intend to publish entire

                                                                                       N B  I take the  Northern  Pole of the Terrestrial Magnet to be about the Meridian of  Archangel  in the Latitude of ½ Its Equator to be nearly a great Circle intersecting the Earth's Equator about ½ Degrees  Eastward  of the Meridian of  London  and in its opposite Point And that its utmost Latitude  Northward  is in the Gulph of  Bengall  about ½ Degrees and as much  South  in the opposite Point in the great  South Sea  And that the  Souther  Pole is nearly circular its Radius Degrees of a great Circle and its Center in a Meridian  Eastward  from  Ceilon  about ½ Degrees and about ½ Latitude  N B London  is nearly  ⌊ = ⌊ distance from the  North  Pole of the Magnet whence its Dip will be at    which is certainly so in Fact  Boston  in  NewEngland  is  =  ⌊    whence its Dip will be about ° ′ which Captain  Beal  found to be so in Fact  Barbados  is about ⌊    = ⌊ distant from the Equator of the Magnet whence its Dip ought to be about ° ½ as Captain  Beal  also found it to be in Fact  St Helena  is about =  ⌊    whence its Dip ought to be about ° ′ as Dr  Halley  found it to be in Fact And so every where in the main Ocean at considerable Distances from the Shores  N B  If the Dip of any Needles be somewhat different at  London  add or substract a proportionable Part of the Dip elsewhere And you will have nearly the true Dip at any other Place with that Needle Thus if your Needle differ from the other ° or ′ and shew the Dip at  London  ° ′ instead of ° ′ which is itsproper Dip in this Table and you require the true Dip by this Needle for  Boston  in  NewEngland Southward  which in the Table is ° ′ proceed thus Because the equal Distance of  Boston  from the Magnetick Equator is Parts of ⌊ the like Distance of  London  from that Equator deduct  ⌊ ′ = ′ = ° ′ out of the Tabular Dip ° ′ The Remainder is ° ′ for the true Dip at  Boston  with that Needle Thus if you want the true Dip by the same Needle at  Dronthem  in  Norway Northward  Because the equal Distance of  Dronthem  from the Magnetick Pole is ⌊ Parts of ⌊ the Distance of  London  from that Pole deduct ⌊ ′ = ′ = ° ′ out of the Tabular Dip ° ′ and the Remainder ° ′ is the true Dip at  Dronthem  with that Needle And so in all other Cases whatsoever  N B  The Table before set down supposes that the true Dip differs according to such a Line of Sines whose middle Point gives ° on one Side and on the other and is made by adding or substracting to the Complement of the Dip found by the natural Sines for every  of equal Distances from the Equator or Pole  N B  If any desire to calculate by Trigonometry the Distances of all Places from the magnetick Equator of Poles and the Distances of that Equator and those Poles in every particular Case both made use of in the foregoing Calculations it is thus to be done  In the  Fig  Triangle  B L A  we have  B L  the CoLatitude of  London B A  the CoLatitude of the magnetick  North  Pole and the included Angle  A B L  = the Distance of the Meridian of that Pole from the Meridian of  London  to find the Angle  Q A M  and the Side  A L  Then  in the Triangle  Q A M  we have the Angles  Q A M  and  Q M A  and the Side  A M  = the Distance of the Magnetick Pole from the Magnetick Equator to find  A Q  So we have the Proportion of  A L  to  AQ Q E I  But since the  Data  are not yet sufficiently exact for the Calculation measuring is sufficient  FINIS  to fold out at the end of y  e  Book  Fig    Fig    Fig    Fig    Fig    Fig    Fig    Fig
