 AN HEROIC POSTSCRIPT TO THE PUBLIC  PRICE ONE SHILLING  AN HEROIC POSTSCRIPT TO THE PUBLIC Occasioned by their favourable Reception of a late HEROIC EPISTLE To Sir WILLIAM CHAMBERS Knt c By the AUTHOR of that EPISTLE  Sicelides musae paullo majora canamus  VIRGIL  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed for J ALMON opposite BURLINGTONHOUSE in PICCADILLY MDCCLXXIV  AN HEROIC POSTSCRIPT TO THE PUBLIC  Verse I that of late  Rle ego qui quondam c  VIRGIL or somebody for him  I THAT of late Sir William's Bard and Squire  March'd with his helm and buckler on my lyre  What time the Knight prick'd forth in illstarr'd haste  Verse Works of taste  Put synonimously for his Majesty's works  See Sir  William's title page  Comptroller General of the works of taste  Now to the Public tune my grateful lays  Warm'd with the sunshine of the Public praise  Warm'd too with mem'ry of that golden time  When Almon gave me reason for my rhyme  glittering orbs and what endear'd them more  Each glittering orb the sacred features bore  Of George the good the gracious and the great  Unfil'd unsweated all of sterling weight  Or were they not they pass'd with current ease  Good seemings then were good realities  No Senate had convey'd by smuggling art  Verse Cadogan's part Master of the Mint  Pow'r to the mob to play Cadogan's part  Now thro' the land that impious pow'r prevails  All weigh their Sov'reign in their private scales  Verse And find him wanting Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting Daniel chap v  And find him wanting all save me alone  For sad to say my glittering orbs are gone  But ill beseems a Poet to repent  Lightly they came and full as lightly went  Peace to their manes may they never feel  Some keen Scotch banker's unrelenting steel  While I again the Muse's sickle bring  To cut down Dunces wheresoe'er they spring  Bind in poetic sheaves the plenteous crop  And stack my fullear'd load in Almon's shop  For now my Muse thy fame is fixt as fate  Tremble ye Fools I scorn ye Knaves I hate  I know the vigour of thy eagle wings  I know thy strains can pierce the ear of Kings  Did China's monarch here in Britain doze  Verse A King of Prose KienLong the present Emperor of China is a poet M de Voltaire did him the honour to treat him as a brother above two years ago and my late patron Sir William Chambers has given a fine and most intelligible prose version of an ode of his Majesty upon tea in his postscript to his Dissertation I am however vain enough to think that the Emperor's composition would have appeared still better in my heroic verse but Sir William forestalled it on which account I have entirely broke with him  And was like western Kings a King of Prose  Thy song could cure his Asiatic spleen  And make him wish to see and to be seen  Verse That solemn vein of irony "A sine vein of solemn irony runs through this piece" See  Monthly Review  under the article of the Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers  That solemn vein of irony so fine  Which e'en Reviewers own adorns thy line  Would make him soon against his greatness sin  Desert his sofa mount his palanquin  And post where'er the Goddess led the way  Perchance to proud Spithead's imperial bay  Verse There should he see A certain naval event happened just about two calendar months after the publication of the Heroic Epistle 'Twas impossible considering the necessary preparations it could have been sooner Facts are stubborn things  There should he see as other folks have seen  That ships have anchors and that seas are green  Should own the tackling trim the streamers fine  With Sandwich prattle and with Bradshaw dine  And then sail back amid the cannon's roar  As safe as sage as when he left the shore  Such is thy pow'r O Goddess of the song  Come then and guide my careless pen along  Yet keep it in the bounds of sense and verse  Verse Nor like MacHomer See if the reader thinks it worth while a late translation of the Iliad  Nor like MacHomer make me gabble Erse  No let the flow of these spontaneous rhymes  So truly touch the temper of the times  That he who runs may read while well he knows  I write in metre what he thinks in prose  So shall my song undisciplin'd by art  Find a sure patron in each English heart  If this it's fate let all the frippery things  Beplac'd bepension'd and bestarr'd by Kings  Verse Like old young Fannius The noble personage here alluded to being asked to read the Heroic Epistle said "No it was as bad as blasphemy"  Verse Fannius Before I sent the M S to the press I discovered that an accidental blot had made all but the first syllable of this name illegible I was doubtful therefore whether to print it Fannius or Fannia After much deliberation I thought it best to use the masculine termination If I have done wrong I ask pardon not only of the Author but the Lady  The Editor  Frown on the page and with fastidious eye  Like old young Fannius call it blasphemy  Let these prefer a levee's harmless talk  Be ask'd how often and how far they walk  Proud of a single word nor hope for more  Tho' Jenkinson is blest with many a score  For other ears my honest number sound  With other praise those numbers shall be crown'd  Praise that shall spread no pow'r can make it less  While Britain boasts the bulwark of her press  Yes sons of freedom yes to whom I pay  Warm from the heart this tributary lay  That lay shall live tho' Court and Grubstreet sigh  Your young Marcellus was not born to die  The Muse shall nurse him up to man's estate  Verse And break the black asperity of fate  "Si qua fata aspera rumpas  Tu Marcellus eris"  VIRGIL  And break the black asperity of fate  Admit him then your candidate for fame  Pleas'd if in your review he read his name  Tho' not with Mason and with Goldsmith put  Yet cheek by jowl with Garrick Colman Foote  But if with higher Bards that name you range  His modesty must think your judgment strange  So when o'er CraneCourt's philosophic Gods  The Jovelike majesty of Pringle nods  If e'er he chance to wake on Newton's chair  He "wonders how the devil he came there"  Whate'er his fame or fate on this depend  He is and means to be his country's friend  'Tis but to try his strength that now he sports  With Chinese gardens and with Chinese courts  But if that country claim a graver strain  If real danger threat fair Freedom's reign  If hireling P**rs in prostitution bold  Sell her as cheaply as themselves they sold  Or they who honour'd by the People's choice  Against that People lift their rebel voice  And basely crouching for their paltry pay  Vote the best birthright of her sons away  Permit a nation's inborn wealth to fly  In mean unkingly prodigality  Nor e'er they give ask how the sums were spent  So quickly squander'd tho' so lately lent  If this they dare the thunder of his song  Rolling in deepton'd energy along  Shall strike with Truth's dread bolt each miscreant's name  Who dead to duty senseless e'en to shame  Betray'd his country Yes ye faithless crew  His Muse's vengeance shall your crimes pursue  Stretch you on satire's rack and bid you lie  Fit garbage for the hellhound Infamy
