 THE SUBSTANCE OF GENERAL BURGOYNE'S SPEECHES  PRICE ONE SHILLING  Speedily will be Published  A Genuine Copy of the PROCEEDINGS of the COURT MARTIAL held upon Colonel HENLEY of the American Troops at  Cambridge  in the Month of  February  upon the Prosecution of General BURGOYNE for Illtreatment of the  British  Troops  Printed for  J Almon  opposite BurlingtonHouse in Piccadilly  THE SUBSTANCE OF GENERAL BURGOYNE'S SPEECHES ON MR VYNER'S MOTION On the th of May AND UPON MR HARTLEY'S MOTION On the th of May  WITH AN APPENDIX CONTAINING General Washington's Letter TO General Burgoyne c  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ALMON OPPOSITE BURLINGTONHOUSE PICCADILLY MDCCLXXVIII  SPEECH OF GENERAL BURGOYNE  MOTION by Mr VYNER Martis  o  die Maii  "THAT this house will now resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to consider of the state and condition of the army which surrendered themselves on convention at Saratoga in America and also by what means Lieutenant General Burgoyne who commanded that army and was included in that convention was released and is now returned to England"  Mr Vyner in opening the motion stated some questions to General Burgoyne which he proposed to ask in the committee  The motion was seconded by Mr Wilkes who also stated further questions in respect to  the treaty with the Indians their conduct during the campaign and the burning the country  An amendment was proposed by Mr Fox to insert after the word  consider  these words  "of the transactions of the northern army under Lieutenant General Burgoyne and of"  The motion thus amended would have run as follows  "That this house will now resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to consider of the transactions of the northern army under Lieutenant General Burgoyne and of the state and condition of the said army c"  In the course of the debate General Burgopne spoke nearly as follows  Mr Speaker not imagining there would be any motion by the honourable gentleman who spoke first but that merely a desire of information would be expressed upon certain subjects I had myself prepared a motion for an address to the king to have such papers laid before the house as are now in possession of the secretary of state and contain an account in detail much too long for me to give in my place of every circumstance expressed in the questions of the honourable gentleman Those  papers are of the utmost importance to the state to parliament and to the public  The turn the business has taken precludes me at present from my intended motion but I rise to give my warmest support to the amendment proposed and as reasons for the expediency of instituting a full enquiry to which the amendment points I shall endeavour as far as I can do it without breach of order in debate to give to  Mr  Vyner  and Mr  Wilkes  both the gentlemen satisfaction upon the particular subjects of their enquiries  I agree with the honourable gentleman who seconded the motion that all the conduct respecting the Indian nations is a matter that ought to be thoroughly canvassed and I look upon his calling upon me openly and in my place as some reparation for the very free and not very generous comments he made upon my conduct in my absence  Sir I ever esteemed the Indian alliances at best a necessary evil I ever believed their services to be overvalued sometimes insignificant often barbarous always capricious and that the employment of them was only justifiable when by being united to a regular army they could be kept under controul and made subservient to a general system  Upon this principle I heartily concurred with that gallant and humane general Sir Guy Carleton in the year to decline the offers and solicitations of the Indians to be then employed separately the impossibility of compleating the preparations for passing the regular troops over the lakes made it impossible to employ them conjunctively  In that year Sir it was my lot by delegation from Sir Guy Carleton who was then at Quebec to preside at one of the greatest councils with the Indians that had been held at Montreal Many gentlemen here know that the ceremony preceding the taking up the hatchet is to offer to the representative of the power they mean to serve the pipe of war It was pressed upon me by the chiefs present and it was in my power by a single whif of tobacco to have given flame and explosion to a dozen nations I never felt greater satisfaction than in being able to fulfil the instructions I was charged with for restraining the impetuous passions of these people it was a secondary satisfaction at my return to England in the winter to justify the conduct of Sir Guy Carleton in this respect though the justification was very unpopular among thoseI mean not to particularize  ministers or ministers of ministersbut among those men who in their zeal against the colonists had adopted the reasoning that  "partial severity was general mercy"  provided by carrying terrors it conduced to finishing the war How just so ever this principle may be my mind is not of a texture for carrying it into effect and I returned to Canada the following spring when I succeeded to the command determined to be the soldier not the executioner of the state  I found care had been already taken by General Carleton upon the same principles of humanity which always direct his conduct to officer the Indians with gentlemen selected from the British troops upon a distinction of their temper and judgment as well as upon that of their valour and in much greater number than ever was destined to that service before To these precautions I added that of a favourite priest who had more controul over the passions of the Indians than all their chiefs put together and I trust the expence put upon government to engage that gentleman's assistance through the course of the campaign will not be esteemed an improper article in my accounts  Sir with these assistances I was able to enforce obedience to the injunctions of my speech at the great council upon assembling the army which has been made public Barbarity was preventedSo much so that in one instance two wounded provincial officers were brought off in the midst of fire upon the backs of Indians and a captain and his whole detachment placed in ambuscade were brought prisoners to my camp by Indians without a man hurt though it was evident they were placed for the special purpose of destroying me upon a reconnoitring party and I was at that time very popular with the Indians  I could produce many more instances to shew that every possible exertion of humanity was used and that the case of Miss Mecree excepted which was accident not premeditated cruelty the stories upon which the honourable gentleman founded his accusation of me were merely those fabricated by committees and propagated in newspapers for temporary purposes The proclamation which the honourable gentleman in my absence treated with so harsh terms I avow was penned by myself The design was to excite obedience first by encouragement and next by the dread not the commission of severity  "to speak daggers but use none"  And so far were the Americans in their hearts from putting upon that proclamation the interpretation that gentleman has done that it served to procure me respect and acknowledgment wherever I afterwards travelled through the country  Sir a gentleman has been in London great part of the winter who I wish had been called to your barIt is for the sake of truth only I wish it for he is certainly not my friend His name is St Luc le Corne a distinguished partisan of the French in the last war and now in the British service as a leader of the IndiansHe owes us indeed some service having been formerly instrumental in scalping many hundred British soldiers upon the very ground where though with a different sort of latitude he was this year employed He is by nature education and practice artful ambitious and a courtier To the grudge he owed me for controlling him in the use of the hatchet and scalping knife it was natural to his character to recommend himself to ministerial favour by any censure in his power to cast upon an unfashionable general He was often closeted by a noble Lord in my eye  Lord  G Germaine  and with all these disadvantages as he has  not been examined here I wish the noble lord to inform the house what this man has presumed to say of my conduct with the Indians I know in private companies his language has been that the Indians might have done great services but they were discharged Sir if to restrain them from murder was to discharge them I take with pride the blameThey were discharged That circumstance apart I should say that the Indians and Mr St Luc at the head of them deserted    This part of the speech included between crotchets was omitted at the time of the preceding and following parts and delivered separately upon a second call of Mr Wilkes but now is inserted in its proper place as better connecting the whole matter spoke to by General Burgoyne  Sir in regard to the call made upon me by the same honourable gentleman for explanation respecting the burning of the country during the progress of the army under my command I am ignorant of any such circumstance I do not recollect more than one accident by fire I positively assert there was no fire by order or countenance of myself or any other officer except at Saratoga That district is the property of Major General Scuyler of the American troops there were large barracks built by him which took fire the day after the army arrived upon the  ground in their retreat and I believe I need not state any other proof of that matter being merely accident than that the barracks were then made use of as my hospital and full of sick and wounded soldiers General Scuyler had likewise a very good dwellinghouse exceeding large storehouses great sawmills and other outbuildings to the value altogether perhaps of ten thousand pounds a few days before the negotiation with General Gates the enemy had formed a plan to attack me a large column of troops were approaching to pass the small river preparatory to a general action and were entirely covered from the fire of my artillery by those buildings Sir I avow that I gave the order to set them on fire and in a very short time that whole property I have described was consumed But to shew that the person most deeply concerned in that calamity did not put the construction upon it which it has pleased the honourable gentleman to do I must inform the house that one of the first persons I saw after the convention was signed was General Scuyler I expressed to him my regret at the event which had happened and the reasons which had occasioned it He desired me to think no more of it  said that the occasion justified it according to the principles and rules of war and he should have done the same upon the same occasion or words to that effect He did moreHe sent an aiddecamp to conduct me to Albany in order as he expressed to procure me better quarters than a stranger might be able to find This gentleman conducted me to a very elegant house and to my great surprise presented me to Mrs Scuyler and her family and in this general's house I remained during my whole stay at Albany with a table of more than twenty covers for me and my friends and every other possible demonstration of hospitality a situation painful it is true in point of sensibility at the time but which I now contemplate with some satisfaction as carrying undeniable testimony how little I deserved the charges of the honourable gentleman and I leave it to his feelings whether after this explanation some farther apology is not due to me  In regard to the first and most material question asked me by the honourable gentleman who proposed the motion viz In what situation is the army at Cambridge It is with some surprize I find that any part of this country is ignorant of the extraordinary circumstances  that have attended it as I conceive government must have received intelligence of them some time ago In regard to the report made by myself I acquit the king's ministers of any blame in not yet having made it public because it was so voluminous that the papers could not be digested and copied with the constant labour of three clerks before last Saturday when they were put into the hands of the noble lord secretary of state for the American department But I trust that noble lord will now lose no time to make public matters of such importance Let them undergo the scrutiny of the committee as proposed by the amended motion and let the world judge upon their report whether the spirit of the troops and the honour of the nation have been sustained and vindicated during those transactions In confidence that these papers cannot possibly be withheld I refer the honourable gentleman to them for a full delineation and explanation of the state of things at Cambridge and will rest my present information upon a few material facts The troops have undergone hardships and trials of patience as severe though of a different nature as any they experienced in the conflicts of the campaign They have acquitted themselves  with equal resolution temper and honour They are at present detained by a resolve of the congress expressing that there are causes of suspicion that the convention was designed to be broke on our part and therefore they are justifiable without breach of public faith to suspend the embarkation of the troops till the convention is ratified by the court of Great Britain  In common with various pretences which involved other names in high departments to justify this measure the congress grounded many suppositions that I knew to be unjust upon my conduct I thought it a duty to the state to the army and to myself to refute those suppositions and still if possible to give immediate effect to the convention It will rest upon the house to judge when they see the papers whether I made good that refutation And that brings me to another question asked by the honourable gentleman  "By what means and upon what condition I am in person here"  Sir I charged my aid de camp who carried my dispatch to the congress in answer to their vote of suspension which the president had officially sent me with a second letter to be delivered in case the suspension after consideration had of my first letter was continued  The purport of this letter was to ask passports for my personal return for the reestablishment of my health which was then much affected for the purpose of settling large and complicated accounts and other reasons and I offered to give a parole that should the suspension of embarkation be prolonged beyond the time apprehended I would return to America upon demand of the congress and due notice given redeliver my person into their hands and abide the fate of the rest of the army with whom I had served Sir I had many reasons not necesary nor proper to be alleged to the congress founded upon a nearer interest than health or any private expediency to make me desirous to return home to lay before government important truths not to be communicated by other means and to supply as far as in me lay by an assiduous and honest exertion in this house the misfortune that had disenabled me from performing my duty in the field I accompanied my letter to the congress by one to General Washington wherein upon an opinion of his character I asked him for his support to an application that could not interfere with the public duties of our respective situations I shall beg leave to read his answer as part of my speech and I do it Sir not only lest in  these times of doubt and aspersion I should incur censure for holding private correspondence with an enemy but likewise because I think this letter though from an enemy does honour to the human heart    See the Appendix    Sir the congress readily consented to my application and by this candid treatment of my enemies I am here to vindicate my conduct against the false and barbarous interpretations that have arisen and have been suffered to prevail by those who could have contradicted them at home  The honourable gentleman wishes to know what is the difference of numbers of the army between the time of signing the convention and the present time and I find the idea of great desertion very much prevails That some men have deserted in the worst sense of the word is true They are few the scum of the regiments and no loss of real strength The greater part who have absconded have had no intention to abandon the service and if an epithet of honour could at any time be applied to a fault theirs might be called  an honourable desertion  General Burgoyne took occasion in two subsequent debates to explain his meaning in this phrase which he found had been misunderstood both within and without the house He meant to apply the word  honourable  only to the common soldier's conception who unused to consider and discriminate punctiliously the obligations of conventions with an enemy acted only upon the principles of zeal to serve his king and again to be actively employed in arms that therefore their conduct was honourably intended though misconceived That so far from justifying that conception himself he was persuaded that to retain such deserters when demanded or indeed discovered would be an infringement of the convention and he was persuaded Sir William Howe or Sir Henry Clinton would upon such demand or discovery return them  Some of  these men left letters or sent messages to their officers informing them that in their present want of necessaries and comforts and their inability to serve in arms they had taken to trades and day labour in the country but that they held themselves under an obligation from which they would never depart to return to their regiments whenever the time of embarkation was ascertained others upon a high though a mistaken suggestion of spirit made efforts to effectuate a passage through the woods to join the armies under Sir William Howe or Sir Henry Clinton and it is believed that some of them succeeded The whole of the absentees may amount to between five and six hundred men  Sir I have thus far endeavoured to give the honourable gentlemen satisfaction in the matters that seem most immediately to engage their attention and that I could consistently  with order adduce in argument to support my vote for a more general enquiry  I shall now proceed as yet stronger reasons for agreeing with the amendment to take notice of what has hitherto passed in the house and upon very imperfect information respecting other parts of the late campaign  But Sir accustomed as I have been to be indulged by the house upon every occasion and confident as I ought to be upon one where their indulgence is justice I find cause in my own mind in entering upon so complicated a subject to implore anew the fullest scope to their patience and candour for a man whose faculties far too weak for such shocks are almost unhinged by a succession of difficulties abroad that fall to the lot of few and whose disappointments and anxieties have been consummated by the unexpected reception he has met at home  And this address Sir is the more necessary because I stand here unconnected and unassisted I am ignorant who would have supported my own motion had I made it though confident from a prepossession of its propriety it would have found assistance somewhere Neither courting nor fearing power neither courting nor fearing party I stand here upon the sole  basis of truth and honour and only ask support in proportion to the justice of my cause  During my absence an enquiry was instituted in which my name was very much involved In the short space of time since my return and in the agitated state of mind I have mentioned it has been impossible for me to obtain from the mere conversation and recollection of friends all that passed upon that occasion but I have collected enough to know that I have been treated with great attention in general and it is among my first duties to return to every quarter of the house my very sincere and grateful acknowledgments I also know that with all that attention and favour much implied censure must have fallen upon me from the nature of the proceedings and more especially from the position which I cannot admit to be a true one but which I understand has been much in  isted upon  "That where there is miscarriage  here must be blame and consequently that  he acquittal of one man infers the condemnat  on of another"  Sir the papers which have been laid before the House are in some respects deficient and in others superfluous The first superfluity to which I allude is a private letter from me to  the noble Lord acquainting him with my intention of going to Bath of my audience with the King of my solicitation to his Majesty for active employment the next campaign expressing my hopes of his Lordship's patronage in that pursuit and concluding with such acknowledgments and professions as were natural to flow from a warm and unsuspicious heart impressed with a sense of another's favour  Not conceiving for what possible public purpose this letter was produced I can only attend to the effects it has had to prejudice me personally Suspicions have been excited that at the time I wrote that letter I was courting command and by adulatory means in preference and in prejudice to Sir Guy Carleton under whom I had had the honour to serve a confidential second the preceding campaign Every person in government might have pronounced my acquittal of so base a proceeding because they knew though the public did not that it was decided  This decision was made not only upon the expediency of the governor attending the civil duties of the province which were thought at that time to require particular attention but also upon doubts whether the general's commission authorised him to act beyond the boundaries and this whole transaction passed long before the return of General Burgoyne to England and entirely without his knowledge  in the Autumn of  and notified to Sir Guy Carleton accordingly that his military command was confined to the boundaries of the province of Quebec It did not occur to the noble Lord to state that fact because doubtless he did not foresee the prejudices the letter would occasion but I cannot but lament he did not produce other letters of mine which would have removed effectually every possible suspicion of a design so foreign to my heart as that of supplanting a gallant friend Such letters would at the same time have rendered unnecessary the long train of correspondence laid upon your table to shew that the preparations in Canada were duly expedited because I should have been found to express the fullest sense of the zeal the assiduity and the honour with which Sir Guy Carleton acted notwithstanding his disappointment in not being employed to conduct the campaign  Will it be said that the letters I allude to were withheld because they were privateIn the first place they do not properly come under that description though it is true they were not office lettersThey could not be directed as such because acting in subordination to Sir Guy Carleton the official correspondence could only with decorum pass  through him but they were not private as applied to secresy nor improper as they related to the distinct and separate object of the command I was entering upon But Sir had any parts of these letters or of any others necessary to my justification of which I say there are many been private in any sense of the word will that excuse be alleged for detaining them when there has appeared before you a paper of the most secret nature I mean my thoughts upon conducting the war from the side of Canada What officer will venture hereafter to give his opinion upon measures or men when called upon by a minister if his confidence his reasonings and his preferences are thus to be invidiously exposed to create jealousies and differences among his fellowofficers and at last to put an imposition upon the world and make him responsible for the plan as well as the execution of a hazardous campaign The plan as originally drawn I have no reason to be ashamed of because it underwent the inspection and had the sanction of some of the first and ablest officers of this country but the plan as it stood when my orders were framed can with no more propriety be called mine than any others formed by the cabinet for the distant parts of America  or any other quarter of the globe where I had no participation or concernThe noble Lord well knows that the idea expressed in the secret paper laid before you of a latitude to act against NewEngland was erased that a power to embark the troops in case of unforeseen impediments and make the junction with the southern army by sea was not admittedWill it then be insinuated that the plan was mineWhy was it not produced in that changed and garbled state by which the minister made it his own Because it would have been one proof if one had been wanting to unprejudiced minds that by cutting off every proposed latitude and confining the plan to one only object the  forcing  a passage to Albany the orders framed upon that plan could be no otherwise understood than as positive peremptory and indispensible But Sir it has been boldly insinuated and perhaps even credited by some in this house that the words at the latter end of the orders which are called the saving clause were specially dictated by meSir to suppose that is to suppose me an ideotSaving clauseto whom Surely not to the General who was to act under itfor see the situation in which it puts himUnder the words  "you are to act as  exigencies may require"  let us suppose him to take the cautious part He makes no attempt upon the enemy because his  exigency  was such that in doing so he must abandon his communications and risk his retreat What would the government the army and the country have said to him What ought every man to have said to him who read the prior part of this order  "Is this vigorous exertion Is this to  force  your way to Albany The enemy were panic struck before British troops there numbers therefore were but as shadows The loyalists awaited your advance to join by thousandsSir H Clinton was ready to move upon the lower part of Hudson's riverYour interpretation of orders was nonsense your inactivity was cowardiceYou have ignominiously lost the campaign"  Take the consideration the other wayThe general follows the principle the spirit and the letter of his orderfights his ground by inches and miscarries  "You shall be disgraced for your rashness"  says the minister  "You had a reserve and should have made use of it  Exigencies  required that you should have remained on the east side the Hudson's river"  Sir to imagine a  general could dictate such a dilemma for himself is preposterous To believe that ministers could mean it is severe credulity against them it would be to believe them capable of the equivocation of a fiend to insure the ruin of those who acted under their direction whatever part they should take I charge them not so heavily I am persuaded that saving clause was meant when it was penned as it has been understood by me by Sir William Howe and by every other person who has read it as referring solely to exigencies after the arrival of my army at Albany  But Sir this ideal blame in not availing myself of the  saving clause  has been supported by a story that I should hardly have believed it within malevolence to invent but which I find has been propagated with great industry viz that Generals Philips and Frazer remonstrated against the passage of the Hudson's River and that finding their remonstrances of no avail they took the parts of brave men in despair and persevered in their duty against their reason Upon the honor of a gentleman without any saving or reservation soever I pronounce that report to be a direct and abominable falsehood Sir those officers were the eyes and the hands by which I conducted  all material operations more able advisers or more faithful friends never existed▪ that they saw I was placed in an arduous situ+ation and felt for my difficulties it is true but that they ever dropt a syllable that implied an idea that I had an alternative I flatly deny The indefatigable alacrity of General Philips to bring forward the transports preparatory to the passage of the river was uncommon even in support of a favourite object it would have been uncommon indeed had he acted with secret reluctancy As to General Frazer our communications were those of the most unreserved friendship and it is my pride to affirm that the consonancy of his sentiments with mine were almost invariable Upon the passage of the Hudson's River in particular he thought it of uncontrovertible expediency he thought it glorious danger he was consulted upon all measures at the time and subsequent to it he bore an active part in many he approved of all and the last sentence he uttered was a message of affection and good wishes to me  The other falsehoods that have been dispersed respecting the same period of time can hardly be urged as reasons for enquiry for they are below refutation such as the delays  occasioned by carrying forward  all  the artillery and a cumberous train of baggage  "It was a merit of Eastern pomp"  says a ministerial newswriter That  all  the artillery was with the army is false for the heavy train was sent back to Canada the fieldtrain which remained was that which had been destined for the expedition when Sir Guy Carleton expected to have the conduct of it in person That intelligent and judicious officer General Philips had been consulted upon the proportion and it had been regulated upon the consideration of the nature of the war the power of that arm in forcing posts and against new troops and the probability of having posts ourselves to fortify Neither Sir was the artillery in the proportion carried cause of the least delay because the horses that drew it were supernumerary to those which were sufficient for all the carts and waggons we had and consequently within the time indispensibly given for the transport of the provision the artillery was brought forward by horses that could have been no otherways employed  The supposed quantity of baggage is equally erroneous I cannot suffer an idea so unjust to the spirit of the army to remain upon the  minds of the public All baggage of bulk to the abridgment of many material comforts had been chearfully left behind by the officers some of them had not beds many lay in soldier's tents and I know of none that had more then the common necessaries for active service  It must be total want of knowledge of the country and the war to suppose that with all these precautions the train of carriages did not still remain great It is to be considered there was a train of six hundred carriages and those too few for the indispensible purpose of transporting provision where there was no water carriage there was another train of very cumberous carriages equally necessary for the transport of the boats where the rapids prevented their passage in the stream a transport in some place of many miles in in length Sir it would be trifling with the house to dwell longer upon these censures the offspring of malice and ignorance the prevalence of such reports tends to one useIt will persuade the world at least that material faults could not abound when detraction itself is reduced to have recourse to such accusation  Sir reverting therefore to the more gross injuries my reputation has sustained I think I  have stated enough to shew that the character of a member has been unavoidably brought into question and upon his assertion that the information the House has proceeded upon is incomplete and fallacious I know not what description of men could justly refuse to him personally a new and full enquiry  I would ask of ministers themselves what would be their feelings if after an unsuccessful undertaking of high trust and importance and debarred by an interdiction from the presence of their Sovereign the means of submitting their conduct to that royal breast where justice and benevolence and protection to the innocent are ever to be expected except when truth is perverted or concealedwhat would be their feelings if refused also an appeal to their country To my brotherofficers in parliament I would more particularly apply for support to this amendment as a common cause of the profession they will consider the discouragement that must ensue and the injury the service must suffer if an officer who is conscious to have done his best whose greatest enemies pretend not to impute to him any other charges than excess of zeal and erroneous judgment and even these charges founded upon a mutilated state of facts  What is the state of officers if upon such grounds and by the artful management of other circumstances they are disgraced at court put by if not inevitably precluded the judgment of a military tribunal and at last denied the only possible means of justification that remainsa parliamentary investigation of a measure of state with which the rectitude or criminality of their conduct is inseparably blended To my honourable friends who made the original motion early in the winter and all who took part in it I may yet more strenuously address myself to repair by the passing this question and amendment the injury that unintentionally they brought upon me by the then confined mode of proceeding To all these considerations Sir I could join were it expedient many more persuasive calls upon the human heart to take up this proceeding for the sake of an injured individual but I wave an appeal to private sentiments and desire the motion to be considered as a call upon the public duty of the house and divesting myself as far as possible of every personal motive scorning the pitiful contention for such comparatively it would be whether the minister should exonerate himself from  this  error in his instruction or the general  from  that  in his execution I here in my place as a representative of the nation require and demand a full and impartial enquiry into the causes of the miscarriage of the northern army in an expedition from Canada  It is a great national object The crisis of the time emphatically requires it The existence of the British empire depends upon the exertions of the military and the best foundation for public spirit is public justice In addition to the natural animation which as Britons the army possess place before their eyes that secondary spring and controller of human actions reward and punishment Let the first and most glorious reward the honest applause of the country be obtained by a scrutiny into truth for those who deserve it on the contrary if there has been delinquency let the spirit of Manlius preside in the punishment  " The hand of fate is over us and heaven  " Exacts severity from all our thoughts"  If there has been disobedience if unauthorised by circumstances if  uncompelled by orders  for I will never shrink from that plea a general has rashly advanced upon the enemy and engaged against insurmountable odds the discipline of the state should strike though it were a favourite son  "  I Lictor deliga ad palum  "  These Sir are the means to excite true ambition in your leaders these are the means to keep them in due restraint this was the system of the glorious patriot  Lord  Chatham  whose obsequies you now celebrate and could his ashes awaken they would burst their cearments to support it  As for myself if I am guilty I fear I am deeply guilty an army lost the sanguine expectation of the kingdom disappointed a foreign war caused or the commencement of it accelerated an effusion of as brave blood as ever run in British veins shed and the severest family distresses combined with public calamityIf this mass of miseries be indeed the consequence of my misconduct vain will be the extenuation I can plead of my personal sufferings fatigue and hardship laborious days and sleepless nights ill health and trying situations poor and insufficient will be such atonement in the judgment of my country or perhaps in the eyes of Godyet with this dreadful alternative in view I provoke a trialGive me inquiryI put the interests that hang most emphatically by the heartstrings of manmy fortunemy honourmy headI had almost said my salvation upon the test  But Sir it is consolation to me to think  that I shall be even in surmise the only culpritWhatever fate may attend the general who led the army to Saratoga their behaviour at that memorable spot must entitle them to the thanks of their countrySir it was a calamitous it was an awful but it was an honourable hourDuring the suspence of the answer from the general of the enemy to the refusal made by me of complying with the ignominious conditions he had proposed the countenance of the troops beggars descriptiona patient fortitude a sort of stern resignation that no pencil or language can reach sat on every brow I am confident every breast was prepared to devote its last drop of blood rather than suffer a precedent to stand upon the British annals of an ignoble surrender  Sir an important subject of enquiry as I mentioned at my outset still remainsthe transactions at Cambridge and the cause of the detention of the troops If I there have been guilty let me there also be the only sufferer  Sir there is a famous story in antient history that bears some analogy to my circumstances and when allusions tend to excite men's minds to exertions of virtue or policy I shall never think them pedantic or misplaced  It had been mentioned in a former debate that references to ancient history carried sometimes an air of pedantry and were seldom of use  The event I mean happened in an age when Roman virtue was at its height It was that wherein Manlius devoted his son and the first Decius devoted himself A Roman army shut up by the Samnites at Candium were obliged to surrender their arms and to submit to the more ignominious condition of passing under the yoke of the enemy The consul who had commanded them proposed in the senate to break the treaty whereby the army was lost to the state and to make him in person the expiation by sending him bound to the enemy to suffer death at their hands In one point of view the present case extremely differs from the example because by the treaty at Saratoga the army was saved to the state It is the noncompliance with public faith that alone can lose itand here the parallel will hold if I have been instrumental to the loss of those brave troops  since  the treaty I am as culpable as if I had lost them  by  the treaty and ought to be the sacrifice to redeem them Sir this reference may appear vainglorious It may be doubted whether there exists in these times public  spirit seriously to emulate such examples I perhaps should find myself unequal but others who are most ready to judge me so must at least give credit to one motive for stating the parallelthat I am too conscious of innocence to apprehend there is the least risk of being exposed to the trial  Sir I have only to return my sincerest thanks to the house for the patience with which they have endured so long a trespass upon their time and to join my hearty concurrence with the other gentlemen who have spoken in favour of the amendment  Jovis  o  die Maii  MR Hartley moved  "That an humble address be presented to his majesty to entreat his majesty that he will be graciously pleased not to prorogue the parliament but that he will suffer them to continue sitting for the purpose of assisting and forwarding the measures already taken for the restoration of peace in America and that they may be in readiness in the present critical situation and prospect of public affairs to provide for every important event at the earliest notice"  Sir George Savile seconded the motion No person offering to answer the Speaker was proceeding to put the question General Burgoyne applied to the treasurybench to know whether the king's servants meant to agree to the motion In which case he said be should give the house no trouble that otherwise he thought hemself pledged to deliver his sentiments The call was "Go on" and General Burgoyne proceeded in substance as follows  Mr Speaker I shall not pursue the argument of the honourable gentleman upon the expediency of parliament being ready sitting to deliberate upon the first intelligence that may arrive from your commissioners that argument has already been too ably enforced to require a second neither Sir after so long an indulgence as I received in a former debate shall I again press upon the attention of the house the debt they owe to national justice and policy upon the subject of enquiry though the Generals Howe and Carleton may be expected every day and it was upon their absence alone that the greater part of the house seemed disposed to postpone so important and necessary a duty But Sir I shall rest solely upon a view of the present state of this country as universally compulsive upon the understanding in favour of the measure proposed While an enemy is prepared upon the neighbouring coast and perhaps is at this hour embarking diffidence despondency and consternation are evident among great part of the people A more fatal symptom prevails among a greater part a torpid indifference to our impending fate Men dare not or will not look into their desperate circumstances God grant that general panic be not  the result of all these demonstrations for panic is incident upon some occasions to those who have been most distinguished for bravery upon others  The salvation of the country depends upon the confidence of the people in some part of government The ministry have it not the whole nation see or think they see their insufficiency I mean not to apply these words grossly or virulently there are among them many to whose personal qualities and talents I bear respect and to none more than the noble lord in the blue ribband But talents are relative to times and it is no reproach to say that men well qualified for negotiation finance or the smooth current of government may be totally unfit for their stations when the crisis requires instant resource decisive counsel animating action That these are notoriously wanting the best friends of the ministers shake their heads and confess Is there a man of common sense and common spirit in the country that does not stand confounded and aghast at the late supineness that does not think the heralds ought to have accompanied your coach Sir when you carried up the address of the commons and that the declaration of war at St James's gate should have accompanied  the answer from the throne  "Be patient" we are told "France may repent Spain yet speaks us fair"  Sir to be patient in our situation is to be abject our pusillanimity gives tenfold encrease to our natural weakness Patience in private life under affliction or disease the strokes of fortune or the hand of heaven is a virtue of lovely hue but political enduringtamely to suffer provocation and injurythe most wanton insult that ever was offered to a nationI mean the message of the French ambassador  Turn thy complexion there  Patience thou young and roselipp'd cherubin  And there look grim as hell  It will be difficult to those who are most conversant in history and accurate in observation to point out examples where after an alarm the spirits of men have revived by inaction This nation is put into the state of a garrison whose outposts are abandoned whose sallies are stopt and who are to combat in the body of the place for their last stake I do not say that men have not fought desperately in such situations but then they have been brought to extremity by a progression of conflicts and have seen great examples to raise and  stimulate their public passions I know of no great exertions where the governing counsels have shewn apprehension and terror and confequent confusion at the outset The success of vigorous measures to restore an army after a panic is almost invariable ancient history abounds with examples in our own time they are frequent When General Romanzoff found the Russians impressed with apprehensions of the Turkish cavalry his first measure was to lay aside the use of chevaux de frize and to encamp without entrenchments The revival of the general spirit of a state depends upon the same principles We need not look abroad for examples we have a more striking one at home than foreign annals can produce in that immortal year the commencement of the Earl of Chatham's administration The most glorious tribute we can pay to his memory is to follow his example Let ministers visit his remains while yet above ground and catch wisdom and vigour and virtue from the view Did he keep fleets at Spithead to prevent invasion Did he fear to trust the internal defence of the nation to her own sons No Sir your navy was employed in offensive operation in every quarter of the globe and the nation supported by  a just confidence were ten times stronger after the dismission of the Hanoverians and Hesfians than before Every ship became a fleet every regiment felt itself an host  We have now a brave admiral riding at Spithead who knows the way to prevent invasion by seeking the enemy at a distance His share of glory in the defeat of Constans is on the minds of his followers you cannot gratify him or them more than to give them a second occasion and by the same means to save their country The brother of that admiral a member of this house  General  Keppel  bred also in the best schools of his profession is second in command on shore and second to one who needs no other praise than that he was the favourite  Lord  Amherst  and the friend and the confidential executor of the arduous plans of the great statesman I alluded toLet these men be assisted with national spirit and England is not to be subdued while a river or a hill remains without such spirit another battle of Hastings may make another conquest  Sir I repeat that the best hope of generating and diffusing this genuine strength of the mind to which arms and treasure are but inadequate substitutes depends upon the presence of parliament  "to provide according to the  words of the motion for every important event at the earliest notice"  To strengthen the crown not by adulatory addresses but by such occasional sanctions as would give fresh and extraenergy to its power pending the emergency that might require it To support public credit in union with the city of London not only by common engagements of faith but by acts of quick and encouraging efficacy towards individuals who might nobly risk their all in the cause but above all in full numbers and by general continuance to exhibit themselves to the world a true representative of a determined people attacked in their vitalsto prove that they are not to be seduced from their duty by the allurements of pleasure or personal interest but have fortitude to await the approach of the enemy as the Gauls were awaited by the senators in Rome and if need were to receive death in these seats to give example and fire to their surviving countrymen Sir a parliament thus inspired the occasion I believe in my conscience would give the inspiration would spread immediate and extensive veneration and influenceFaction in this great city if faction there is would be no moremajorities and minorities here would  be lost in unanimity for the public safetythe King's name thus supported would be in truth a tower of strength and the daring attempts of the enemy would only tend to the present glory and future stability of the state  Sir these are my sincere sentiments and for this free delivery of them I doubt not that I shall read in the morning papers of tomorrow that I have thrown myself into the arms of opposition I am conscious I never did so true a service to the king and to the country as I do in the part I now take and whatever may be the idle comments of the day I trust that with the respectable part of the public if the term  opposition  is to imply blame it will be applicable only to the rejection of this motion If the king's ministers take the lead and exercise their persuasion for that purpose I hold them to be opposers of national spirit opposers of public virtue opposers of the most efficacious means to save their country Sir I scorn to take up this language upon so pitiful a motive as personal resentment Government whoever are the ministers to conduct it shall have my voice when my conscience directs it That I think myself a persecuted man I avow  that I am a marked victim to bear the sins that do not belong to me I apprehend but this is not the first time I have stood the frowns of power for parliamentary conduct and whatever further vengeance may be in store for me I hope I shall endure it as becomes me I am aware that in far better times officers have been stript of their preferments for resisting the possessors of that benchThey cannot take from me an humble competence they cannot deprive me of a qualification to sit here they cannot strip me I trust they cannot of the confidence of my constituents to seat me here they cannot strip meI am sure they cannotof principle and spirit to do my duty here  I never was more excited by these motives and I never can be more than upon the present occasion to give my vote in support of the motion  APPENDIX  Copy of a Letter from General  Washington  to Lieutenant General  Burgoyne  HeadQuarters  Pensylvania    March  th  SIR  I Was only two days since honoured with your very obliging letter of the th of February  Your indulgent opinion of my character and the polite terms in which you are pleased to express it are peculiarly flattering and I take pleasure in the opportunity you have afforded me of assuring you that far from suffering the views of national opposition to be imbittered and debased by personal animosity I am ever ready to do justice to the merit of the gentleman and the soldier and to esteem where esteem is due however the idea of a public enemy may interpose You will not think it the language of unmeaning ceremony if I add that sentiments of personal respect in the present instance are reciprocal  Viewing you in the light of an officer contending against what I conceive to be the rights of my country the reverse of fortune you experienced in the field cannot be unacceptable to me but abstracted from considerations of national advantage I can sincerely sympathize with your feelings as a soldier the unavoidable difficulties of whose situation forbid his success and as a man whose lot combines the calamity of ill health the anxieties of captivity and the painful sensibility for a reputation exposed where he most values it to the assaults of malice and detraction  As your aid de camp went directly on to Congress the business of your letter to me had been decided before it came to hand I am happy that their chearful acquiescence with your request prevented the necessity of my intervention And wishing you a safe and agreeable passage with a perfect restoration of your health  I have the honour to be Very respectfully Sir Your most obedient servant GEO WASHINGTON  NOTE respecting the First Debate  SINCE the substance of the speech has been prepared for the press it has been observed in a daily paper that General Burgoyne stated that it had been a race between the Congress and him to engage the Indian nations It is a mistake that General Burgoyne made any mention of himself being any ways concerned in any negotiations with the Indians prior to giving directions for their junction with the army upon Lake Champlain excepting in the council of the autumn to in which they were dismissed for that year  It is true General Burgoyne did state in his speech that there had been a race between the emissaries of the Congress and the conductors of India affairs on the part of the British government to engage not only the contiguous but also the remote nations This fact might have been proved by Mr St Luc+le Corne had he thought proper as well as by many others  This part of the Indian subject accidentally escaped the press by its being omitted in the notes from which the speech was collected  NOTE respecting the Second Debate  MR Wedderburne took occasion after a short argument against the expediency of the motion to propound  doubts  relative to General Burgoyne's capacity to vote in parliament and he argued them at length with visible preparation and much learning He referred very particularly to the story of Regulus and to make the cases parallel stated the General as a common prisoner of war the convention of Saratoga being broke that consequently he was not  sui juris  but the present property of another power He insisted with still less expression of doubt that the General under his present obligations was incapacitated from exercising any office or bearing arms in this country  General Burgoyne in reply stated the mistake upon which Mr Wedderburne's argument was in great measure founded viz that the convention was  broke  and that the General was under the usual restrictions of a prisoner of war The convention was declared by the congress not intended to be broke on their part though the execution of it was suspended The General therefore insisted that he was under no other obligation than  that specified in the convention  "Not to serve in America"  and that of his parole  "To return at the demand of the congress and due notice given"  that in this country he was free to exercise his rights as a citizen and a soldier that should the enemy land though his present disfavour might preclude him from the command which his rank and some experience might entitle him to he trusted the king would not refuse his request to take a musquet in defence of his country He proceeded to argue that even upon the supposition that Mr Wedderburne's position had been true in its full extent and that he had been  directly  a prisoner of war under parole he should not have been incapacitated from acting in parliament and in answer to the precedents brought from remote ages he produced one of a present member Lord Frederick Cavendish who when a prisoner to France after the action at St Cas and upon his parole in England sat and voted in parliament That noble lord upon quitting France had asked whether any restraint in that respect was meant as he should certainly vote for every measure that could distress the enemyHe was told that they should as soon think of restraining him from getting a  child left when it came to maturity it should do them mischief  The General proceeded to observe that the cases in point of explanation were precisely the same for that before he left the army it had been intimated to him that there were persons  in Boston  who  doubted  whether he should not be restrained by parole from taking any part in parliament at least when America was concerned that he came to an explanation with those entrusted with the sentiments and powers of the congress and declared that if such restraint was intended he would remain and die in that country rather than return homeThe idea was abolished nay more it was expressed that the friends of the congress conceived rather advantage than injury from the General's presence in parliament that they wished for peace upon proper terms that they were persuaded the General as a man of humanity wished the same that they believed he had honour to speak truth and that truth would conduce to that desirable end  After this explanation Mr Wedderburne acknowledged no doubts remained upon the General's rights and the house were unanimous in the same opinion  FINIS
