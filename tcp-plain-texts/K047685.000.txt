 ZIMRI AN ORATORIO  Written by Dr HAWKESWORTH  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  BALAK King of Moab  ZURAN a Prince of Midian  COSBI his Daughter  Chorus of Midianites Attendants on Cosbi  MOSES  ZIMRI a Prince of Israel  Elders of Israel  A Messenger  Chorus of Iraelitish Virgins  PART I  SCENE I  Balak  and  Zuran  RECITATIVE  Bal  At length we triumph o'er the chosen race  Before whose march the parting sea gave way  Whose thirst the rock with sudden springs supply'd  Whose hunger drew down manna from the skies  Zur  In vain was Balaam's willing curse suppress'd  Vain was th'extorted blessing of his God  If guiltless they would still tho' curst prevail  Tho' blest yet guilty they must fall before us  Bal  Therefore in arms we did not vainly dare  The dreadful Cherub who before their host  Veil'd in a cloud or glowing like a flame  Sweeps with one stroke whole nations to the grave  Like him with silent force our daughters conquer  Nor can our foes withstand the glance of beauty  Beauty at once disarms them and assails  Subdues and bids the pestilence destroy  Save one their mighty princes all are guilty  And for their crime have twice ten thousand died  Zur  That one is Zimri O mighty Zimri fall  The boasted strength of Simeon's haughty tribe  Bal  Him with unrival'd charms thy daughter proves  And not his gods can save him if he loves  AIR  When with love the bosom burns  Passion reason rule by turns  Weaker still is reason's power  Passion's stronger ev'ry hour  When the cup of joy o'erflows  Vain are hints of distant woes  What if death in ambush lie  Lovers pant to drink and die  RECITATIVE  Zur  Thrice have the circling hours the morn renew'd  Since Cosbi's absence but as yonder camp  Lies full within our view I oft have seen her  Known by the sportive beauties in her train  Now passing Zimri's tent with wanton step  Now lost amidst the tall contiguous shade  Bal  See where she comes by all our hopes successful  The blush of triumph glowing on her cheek  SCENE II  Enter  Cosbi  and Chorus of  Midianitish  Women  RECITATIVE  Cos  At length Astarte unresisted reigns  Our lovely goddess all whose ri  es are bliss  Zimri by these incurs the burning wrath  Of Israel's sterner gods who frown destruction  Zur  Thrice happy Midian▪ we to gentle powers  Wa  t tender sighs and pay delightful vows  Nor yet to furious jealouly provoke  The dreadful Being at whose lightest touch  Eternal mountains like their snows dissolve  Before whose presence when he rides the whirlwind  The sun grows dark and earth's foundations tremble  But tell us now what happy wiles seduc'd  The steady Zimri from his vow'd allegiance  RECITATIVE  accompanied  Cos  When first I met the youth renown'd in arms  My girded robe disclos'd but half my charms  He stopp'd he gaz d then frowning with disdain  Turn'd back yet stopp'd and turn'd and gaz  d again  Oft as I cross'd his walk he still withdrew  But his slow steps long linger'd in my view  AIR  With thoughtful pace alone he stray'd  Along the still sequester'd glade  He stray'd nor cast his eyes above  But sigh'd in solitude for love  Tripping then within his view  All my wanton train I drew  Sprightly measures while we play'd  Each a thousand charms display'd  RECITATIVE  accompanied  Then loosely dress'd and glowing from the dance  Alone I stole on his belov'd retreat  Inflam'd confus'd he caught my am'rous glance  He could not fly me and he durst not meet  AIR  I saw the pride of virtue fail  And unresisted love prevail  The tyrant of his breast  Now pale now blushing with disdain  His varying looks declar'd his pain  And ev'ry fond desire exprest  With silent eloquence I sooth'd the boy  And reason soon resign'd his soul to joy  RECITATIVE  Zur  Oh haste away secure the glorious prize  he repent and mercy disappoint us  Bal  Haste and the triumph waits thy wish'd return  To thee shall temples rise and altars smoke  AIR  Love  rules the world beside  f a slave to thee  Thou  ev'ry passion guide  All subduing thou  free  Join in loud applauding    CHORUS  Beauty now with wisdom reigns  All the praise of noble aims  Zuran's lovely daughter claims  The bids which gods might envy she beslows  To save her country on her country's f  es  Bear the song to distant plains  Beauty now with wisdom reigns  Exeunt  SCENE III  The  Elders  of  Israel  RECITATIVE    st Eld  Well may luxuriant Midian sheathe the sword  And safety revel since our sins destroy us  These send the desolating angel forth  Who scatters wide the dying from the dead    d Eld  Yes Israel's princes still to idols bow  Still mix in rites obscene with Midian's daughters  AIR  No more our sacred songs their lips employ  No more in God the first and last they trust  In conscious virtue now no more they joy  No more the wise the mighty and the just  RECITATIVE    d Eld  But Moses comes and in his visage shines  The radiance caught from uncreated light  The mark of recent conference with God  SCENE IV  To them  Moses  and Chorus of  Israelitish  Virgins  RECITATIVE  Moses  Cut off the wicked and the just shall live  He in whose sight not heaven itself is pure  Nor angels wise commands that ev'ry chief  Who with affections vile and hands prophane  Has burnt his off  ing on an idol's altar  And Midian's loveless harlots has caress'd  Shall die now deck'd in gems and gay with wine  Ere night cast out to vultures and to dogs    st Eld  The just decree with rev'rence be fulfill'd  Of sov'reign goodness who destroys to save  Who thus deters his chosen tribes from guilt  From guilt since all the guilty must be wretched  DUET  Ah to be guilty and to die  To die for ever who can bear the thought  In endless night to close the swimming eye  In endless night with endless horrors fraught  RECITATIVE  Moses  'Tis dreadful Ye that shudder sin no more  SCENE V  To them an  Israelitish  Virgin  RECITATIVE  Vir  Ah why should those who are not chaste be fair  E'en Zimri falls seduc'd by guilty charms  Zimri who stemm'd the torrent of defection  In whom each excellence of youth and years  Combin'd to form the hero sage and saint  Last night near yon dark grove was seen to part  With Zuran's daughter scarce her loosen'd zone  Beneath her swelling breast her robe restrain'd  And smiles and blushes mingled in her cheek  AIR  Ah mourn with me the lovely youth  Whose heart receives a wanton guest  A heart where love should dwe  l with truth  And virtue be by virtue blest  RECITATIVE  Moses  A guilt incurr'd so late not yet we punish  To conscience first the judge within his breast  'Tis fit we leave him To the sacred tent  Now bend your steps and let one general pray'r  From all the just in unison ascend  CHORUS  Come to the sacred tent repair  And prostrate breathe the fervent prayer  May Heav'n accept the victims due  And favour Israel's race pursue  Exeunt  PART II  SCENE I  Zimri  alone  RECITATIVE  accompanied  Again seduc'd to guilty joys again  I break away to muse and to be wretched  Farewel the peaceful hour of meditation  When conscious virtue wa  ts the soul to heaven  If I look inward now I start with horror  And life becomes a burden and a curse  SCENE II  To him  Cosbi  and  Chorus  of  Midianitish  Women  RECITATIVE  Cos  What haggard looks what gestures of distraction  Why art thou thus when in the blossom'd bow'r  The voice of mirth invites thee to the banquet  And love would breathe soft murmurs on thy breast  Zim  I must not hear thy voice nor see thy face  Thy voice is fatal as the southern blast  Thy face more sure than basilisks destroys  DUET  Cos  Yet let the fond remembrance last  Of kinder thoughts and pleasures past  Zim  Of all the past I dread the view  And bid the guilty joys adieu  Cos  Why dread the scenes that love displays  Zim  Alas 'tis guilt 'tis death to gaze  Cos  Ah think  Zim  My thoughts to phrenzy turn  Again I languish and I burn  RECITATIVE  Cos  Come then my love  Zim  O no stand off seducer  This hour the victims of such wiles as thine  The mighty chiefs of Israel gasp in death  Cos  Haste then suspend the li  ted hand of murder  I do not talk thy eloquence too high  Go plead the cause of nature with her foes  Till superstition blush and priests learn mercy  AIR  and  CHORUS  A  Midianitish  Woman  Fly and disappoint the grave  Fly the destin'd victims save  And with them returning prove  Life is gain to those who love  RECITATIVE  Zim  Ah no but let me rather perish with them  How can I else atone my follies past  How else be sure that I shall not repeat them  Cos  Thou nor to crime nor folly art seduc'd  Nor die the princes by the gods decree  Cares not the common parent of mankind  Alike for all one family on earth  However nam'd and wheresoe'er they dwell  Would he who bids encrease deny the rite  Because th' enamour'd hearts that long to join  When first they beat were distant from each other  Zim  Ah could I but believe thy reas'ning just  Cos  That wish had prov'd it Nature never gave  Desires which yet 'tis duty to suppress  Zim  Subdu'd at once by eloquence and love  My fair enchantress all my soul is thine  AIR  That I should yield thy wit persuades  Thy wit thy matchless beauty aids  And gives and justifies delight  Whene'er we err our fault is less  More num'rous as temptations press  And all fair nymph in thee unite  Thy charms which prompt my fault the guilt destroy  Thy charms at once my safety and my joy  RECITATIVE  Cos  See yonder comes the tyrant of thy race  Stand firm to persevere is now to conquer  I leave thee follow with a lover's haste  O virgins aid my purpose with your song  DUET  Be thy thoughts for ever kind  Ever firm thy manly mind  Haste away to yonder plain  Haste with all thy kindred train  Tender joys our gods approve  Haste with us to live and love  Exeunt  SCENE III  To  Zimri Moses  RECITATIVE  Moses  Is yet the hand that softens rocks upon thee  Dost thou relent and wilt thou yet with us  Surround the sacred dwelling of our God  And see th' apostate chiefs of Israel die  Zim  Relent thou rather and forbid the murder  Nor more when driving on the tainted storm  Disease assails us feign that Heaven is wroth  And glut the grave with those that plagues would spare  Moses  Doubt and suspicion still attend on guilt  While yet thy life was pure thy faith was strong  But tell me thou whose intellectual eye  The midnight revel happily has purg'd  Why if contagion uncommission'd spreads  It teaches not to Midian  Zim  Tell me rather  Why if commission'd the seducers live  Moses  Abhorr'd of God he leaves them unreclaim'd  And only deigns to punish those he loves  Zim  Let reason judge who must are lov'd of Heaven  AIR  You happy race on fertile plains recline  Embrac'd by beauty and regal'd with wine  Aw'd by no terrors to no laws con  in'd  Love all the worship for their gods design'd  We still to hunger and to thirst a prey  With painful rites relentless pow'rs obey  From ev'ry joy restrain'd by stern command  And driv'n still vagrant o'er the burning sand  Forward we look for better days in vain  It patient famish'd if we murmur slain  RECITATIVE  Moses  To sense not reason is thy rash appeal  To brutal appetite luxurious ease  Is sweet but man should live to nobler purpose  AIR  The bliss that ne'er was found below  Above by virtue we obtain  And virtue if we wish to know  We must not strangers be to pain  Who hopes for Heav'n adversity defies  And sights on earth to triumph in the skies  RECITATIVE  Farewel Yet one word moreremember Sinai▪  SCENE IV  Zimri  alone  RECITATIVE  accompanied  Remember Sinai wou'd I could forget it  A thousand dread ideas rush upon me  Methinks again I see the mountain shake  It's lofty summit now involv'd in darkness  Now burning unconsum'd with ruddy fires  I hear again the thunder and the voice  Again obedient I believe and tremble  AIR  O First and Best the Parent of mankind  Who for thy throne the mercyseat design'd  Receive my fault'ring pray'r my crime forgive  To thee returning let thy servant live  SCENE V  To  Zimri Cosbi  and  Chorus  of  Midianitish  Women  RECITATIVE  accompanied  Zim  Again she come  my resolution fa  ls  As morning vapours vanish from the sun  RECITATIVE  Cos  Impatient of thy absence I return  Ah let me hear thy voice and see the  smile  Zim  I cannot speak  Cos  I must not cannot lose thee  Thus let me grasp thy hand and gaze upon thee  And now my lovely hero tell me true  Has this stern Moses frown'd away thy love  Zim  Oh leave me now nor farther urge thy pow'r  Lest for another momentary dream  I cast eternal happiness away  Cos  Leave to the gods eternity nor trust  For aught tomorrow which today can give  AIR  The future is not mine nor thine  The past alas no more returns  Let love our souls this moment join  For us his lamp this moment burnt  RECITATIVE  Zim  Again my soul has caught the sweet infection  Again I feel the phrenzy of desire  AIR  Yes though around me thousands die  While yet I live I'll life improve  The posting moments as they fly  I'll catch and fill the last with love  CHORUS  Mortals thus with haste possess  All that fortune gives to bless  And despising slavish rules  Leave the joys of hope to fools  Exeunt  PART III  SCENE I  Chorus  of  Israelitish  Virgins  RECITATIVE  accompanied    Vir  On time's swift wing the dreadful hour is come  With mournful steps in solemn slow procession  The princes pass to die a num'rous train  In sackcloth followHark the dirge of death  Solemn music    It ceasesand now awful silence reigns  O'er all the prostrate crowd The victims now  Alas their sands are few look round aghast  And now their eyes are veil'd to gaze no more  They lift their trembling hands and give the sign  Now now the agonies of death are on them  Now the last pang resigns them to the bar  Of heav'n's eternal Judgetremendous thought  AIR  Indulge unblam'd your tears ye virgin train  When guilt exacts the salutary pain  For oft as Justice wounds with dreadful sweep  Still gentle pity claims the right to weep  The friend of man she melts at ev'ry wee  Nor sees her streaming eye who feels the blow  RECITATIVE    Vir  O sight of yet more horror turn we from it  At this dread moment by the prostrate camp  Zimri inflam'd by beauty and by wine  Leads Zuran's daughter glowing with desire  Behind them dancing to the timbrel's sound  The gay companions of her wanton hours  d Vir  Her arts in vain essay'd from death to save  The victims destin'd to atone the past  But with fresh insult to provoke our God  She now prevails and we for Zimri perish    st Vir  The sky grows dark presaging swift destruction  Ah what can intercept th' impending stroke  Ah who propitiate now affronted Heav'n  SCENE II  To them  Moses  RECITATIVE  Moses  Fear notI saw the foul presumptuous insult  But by the sacred influence from above  Which fills so often my presaging breast  I know the end of all our woes is near  CHORUS  Belov'd of Heaven already we behold  And bless th' attesting sign the glooms disperse  It thunders one loud peal and all is clear  SCENE III  To them a  Messenger  and  Chorus  AIR  and  CHORUS  Tune your harps to songs of praise  Happy tidings now I bear  God with joy our grief repays  God propitious hears our pray'r  Not averted now his face  Now his gracious ear inclin'd  Now confess'd his chosen race  Give your sorrows to the wind  RECITATIVE  Moses  Has not some patriothand laid Zimri low  Mes  It has Th' apostate as he pass'd along  Embracing and embrac'd by Zuran's daughter  Brave Phineas mark'd and springing from his seat  With sacred fury seiz'd his dreaded lance  "Avenge the cause of Israel's God"he cried  Obedient to the word the weapon flew  And with one wound transfix'd the guilty pair  Gasping they fell and as they smote the ground  Applauding thunder shook the vault above  The sun with sudden blaze resum'd his glory  The sick inspir'd with instantaneous health  Leap'd up and horror seiz'd astonish'd Midian  Moses  See where our foes precipitate their flight  An  Israelite  RECITATIVE  accompanied  They fly but not from conscience in their breast  That stern Avenger of our wrongs they bear  But soon the blameless mind shakes off it's sorrows  For he whose will is fate at first decreed  No bands shou'd long bind innocence to woe  AIR  Smiling hope a cherub bright  Smiling hope is virtue's guest  Soothing anguish to delight  Healing soon the wounded breast  Joy succeeds to sorrow past  Give the beating heart to joy  Virtue's joy shall ever last  Ever last and never cloy  RECITATIVE  accompanied  Moses  Yes joy to guilt is but a transient beam  Like the red lightning that makes night more dreadful  To blameless minds 'tis sunshine without cloud  That gives new splendour to the chearful day  But other truths this awful day must teach  It's judgments else but half are understood  AIR  Nor wit's deceit nor beauty's charm  Nor mirth nor wine's insiduous pow'r  Eternal Justice e'er disarm  Or stop the sure tho' ling'ring hour  Who break Jehovah's sacred laws  Whate'er the means whate'er the cause  Shall stand impeach'd without reply  If mercy pleads no contrite tear  Fair virtue's pledge whene'er sincere  The guilty souls for ever die  CHORUS  Raise then to God the supplicating strain  To God whom virtue ne'er address'd in vain  His gracious voice shall answer to the song  "Be wise ye simple and ye weak be strong"  With joy receive the promise of the sky  And in one chorus let your praise reply
