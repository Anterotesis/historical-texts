in The GuardianThe  Bleeding Nan  is a tradition still credited in many parts of Germany and I have been told that the ruins of the castle of  Lauenstein  which she is supposed to haunt may yet be seen upon the borders of  Thuringia  The  WaterKing  from the third to the twelfth stanza is the fragment of an original Danish balladAnd  Belerma and Durandarte  is translated from some stanzas to be found in a collection of old Spanish poetry which contains also the popular song of  Gayferos and Melesindra  mentioned in Don QuixoteI have now made a full avowal of all the plagiarisms of which I am aware myself but I doubt not many more may be found of which I am at present totally unconscious  THE MONK  CHAP▪ I▪  Lord Angelo is precise  Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses  That his blood flows or that his appetite  Is more to bread than stone  MEASURE FOR MEASURE  SCARCELY had the abbeybell tolled for five minutes and already was the church of the Capuchins thronged with auditors Do not encourage the idea that the crowd was assembled either from motives of piety or thirst of information But very few were influenced by those reasons and in a city where superstition reigns with  such despotic sway as in Madrid to seek for true devotion would be a fruitless attempt The audience now assembled in the Capuchin church was collected by various causes but all of them were foreign to the ostensible motive The women came to show themselves the men to see the women some were attracted by curiosity to hear an orator so celebrated some came because they had no better means of employing their time till the play began some from being assured that it would be impossible to find places in the church and one half of Madrid was brought thither by expecting to meet the other half The only persons truly anxious to hear the preacher were a few antiquated devotees and half a dozen rival orators determined to find fault with and ridicule the discourse As to the remainder of the audience the sermon might have been omitted altogether certainly without their being disappointed and very probably without their perceiving the omission  Whatever was the occasion it is at least certain that the Capuchin church had never witnessed a more numerous assembly Every corner was filled every seat was occupied The very statues which ornamented the long aisles were pressed into the service Boys suspended themselves upon the wings of cherubims St Francis and St Mark bore each a spectator on his shoulders and St Agatha found herself under the necessity of carrying double The consequence was that in spite of all their hurry and expedition our two newcomers on entering the church looked round in vain for places  However the old woman continued to move forwards In vain were exclamations of displeasure vented against her from all sides in vain was she addressed with"I assure you Segnora there are no places here""I beg Segnora that you will not crowd me so intolerably" "Segnora you cannot pass this way Bless me How can people be so troublesome"  The old woman was obstinate and on she went By dint of perseverance and two brawny arms she made a passage through the crowd and managed to bustle herself into the very body of the church at no great distance from the pulpit Her companion had followed her with timidity and in silence profiting by the exertions of her conductress  "Holy Virgin" exclaimed the old woman in a tone of disappointment while she threw a glance of enquiry round her "Holy Virgin what heat what a crowd I wonder what can be the meaning of all this I believe we must return there is no such thing as a seat to be had and nobody seems kind enough to accommodate us with theirs"  This broad hint attracted the notice of two cavaliers who occupied stools on the right hand and were leaning their backs against the seventh column from the pulpit Both were young and richly habited Hearing this appeal to their politeness pronounced  in a female voice they interrupted their conversation to look at the speaker She had thrown up her veil in order to take a clearer look round the cathedral Her hair was red and she squinted The cavaliers turned round and renewed their conversation  "By all means" replied the old woman's companion "by all means Leonella let us return home immediately the heat is excessive and I am terrified at such a crowd"  These words were pronounced in a tone of unexampled sweetness The cavaliers again broke off their discourse but for this time they were not contented with looking up both started involuntarily from their feats and turned themselves towards the speaker  The voice came from a female the delicacy and elegance of whose figure inspired the youths with the most lively curiosity to view the face to which it belonged This satisfaction was denied them Her  features were hidden by a thick veil but struggling through the crowd had deranged it sufficiently to discover a neck which for symmetry and beauty might have vied with the Medicean Venus It was of the most dazzling whiteness and received additional charms from being shaded by the tresses of her long fair hair which descended in ringlets to her waist Her figure was rather below than above the middle size it was light and airy as that of an Hamadryad Her bosom was carefully veiled Her dress was white it was fastened by a blue sash and just permitted to peep out from under it a little foot of the most delicate proportions A chaplet of large grains hung upon her arm and her face was covered with a veil of thick black gauze Such was the female to whom the youngest of the cavaliers now offered his seat while the other thought it necessary to pay the same attention to her companion  The old lady with many expressions of gratitude but without much difficulty accepted  the offer and seated herself the young one followed her example but made no other compliment than a simple and graceful reverence Don Lorenzo such was the cavalier's name whose seat she had accepted placed himself near her but first he whispered a few words in his friend's ear who immediately took the hint and endeavoured to draw off the old woman's attention from her lovely charge  "You are doubtless lately arrived at Madrid" said Lorenzo to his fair neighbour "it is impossible that such charms should have long remained unobserved and had not this been your first public appearance the envy of the women and adoration of the men would have rendered you already sufficiently remarkable"  He paused in expectation of an answer As his speech did not absolutely require one the lady did not open her lips After a few moments he resumed his discourse  "Am I wrong in supposing you to be a stranger to Madrid"  The lady hesitated and at last in so low a voice as to be scarcely intelligible she made shift to answer"No Segnor"  "Do you intend making a stay of any length"  "Yes Segnor"  "I should esteem myself fortunate were it in my power to contribute to making your abode agreeable I am well known at Madrid and my family has some interest at court If I can be of any service you cannot honour or oblige me more than by permitting me to be of use to you""Surely" said he to himself "she cannot answer that by a monosyllable now she must say something to me"  Lorenzo was deceived for the lady answered only by a bow  By this time he had discovered that his neighbour was not very conversible but whether her silence proceeded from pride discretion timidity or idiotism he was still unable to decide  After a pause of some minutes"It  is certainly from your being a stranger" said he "and as yet unacquainted with our customs that you continue to wear your veil Permit me to remove it"  At the same time he advanced his hand towards the gauze the lady raised hers to prevent him  "I never unveil in public Segnor"  "And where is the harm I pray you" interrupted her companion somewhat sharply "Do not you see that the other ladies have all laid their veils aside to do honour no doubt to the holy place in which we are I have taken off mine already and surely if I expose my features to general observation you have no cause to put yourself in such a wonderful alarm Blessed Maria Here is a fuss and a bustle about a chit's face Come come child Uncover it I warrant you that nobody will run away with it from you"  "Dear aunt it is not the custom in Murcia"  "Murcia indeed Holy St Barbara  what does that signify You are always putting me in mind of that villanous province If it is the custom in Madrid that is all that we ought to mind and therefore I desire you to take off your veil immediately Obey me this moment Antonia for you know that I cannot bear contradiction"  Her niece was silent but made no further opposition to Don Lorenzo's efforts who armed with the aunt's sanction hastened to remove the gauze What a seraph's head presented itself to his admiration Yet it was rather bewitching than beautiful it was not so lovely from regularity of features as from sweetness and sensibility of countenance The several parts of her face considered separately many of them were far from handsome but when examined together the whole was adorable Her skin though fair was not entirely without freckles her eyes were not very large nor their lashes particularly long But then her lips were of the most rosy freshness her fair and undulating hair  confined by a simple ribband poured itself below her waist in a profusion of ringlets her neck was full and beautiful in the extreme her hand and arm were formed with the most perfect symmetry her mild blue eyes seemed an heaven of sweetness and the crystal in which they moved sparkled with all the brilliance of diamonds She appeared to be scarcely fifteen an arch smile playing round her mouth declared her to be possessed of liveliness which excess of timidity at present repressed She looked round her with a bashful glance and whenever her eyes accidentally met Lorenzo's she dropped them hastily upon her rosary her cheek was immediately suffused with blushes and she began to tell her beads though her manner evidently showed that she knew not what she was about  Lorenzo gazed upon her with mingled surprise and admiration but the aunt thought it necessary to apologize for Antonia's  mauvaise honte  "'Tis a young creature" said she "who is totally ignorant of the world She has been brought up in an old castle in Murcia with no other society than her mother's who God help her has no more sense good soul than is necessary to carry her soup to her mouth Yet she is my own sister both by father and mother"  "And has so little sense" said Don Christoval with feigned astonishment "How very extraordinary"  "Very true Segnor Is it not strange However such is the fact and yet only to see the luck of some people A young nobleman of the very first quality took it into his head that Elvira had some pretensions to beautyAs to pretensions in truth she had always enough of  them  but as to beautyIf I had only taken half the pains to set myself off which she did But this is neither here nor there As I was saying Segnor a young nobleman fell in love with her and married her unknown to his father Their union remained  a secret near three years but at last it came to the ears of the old marquis who as you may well suppose was not much pleased with the intelligence Away he posted in all haste to Cordova determined to seize Elvira and send her away to some place or other where she would never be heard of more Holy St Paul How he stormed on finding that she had escaped him had joined her husband and that they had embarked together for the Indies He swore at us all as if the evil spirit had possessed him he threw my father into prisonas honest a painstaking shoemaker as any in Cordova and when he went away he had the cruelty to take from us my sister's little boy then scarcely two years old and whom in the abruptness of her flight she had been obliged to leave behind her I suppose that the poor little wretch met with bitter bad treatment from him for in a few months after we received intelligence of his death"  "Why this was a most terrible old fellow Segnora"  "Oh shocking and a man so totally devoid of taste Why would you believe it Segnor when I attempted to pacify him he cursed me for a witch and wished that to punish the count my sister might become as ugly as myself Ugly indeed I like him for that"  "Ridiculous" cried Don Christoval "Doubtless the count would have thought himself fortunate had he been permitted to exchange the one sister for the other"  "Oh Christ Segnor you are really too polite However I am heartily glad that the condé was of a different way of thinking A mighty pretty piece of business to be sure Elvira has made of it After broiling and stewing in the Indies for thirteen long years her husband dies and she returns to Spain without an house to hide her head or money to procure her one This Antonia was then but an infant  and her only remaining child She found that her fatherinlaw had married again that he was irreconcileable to the condé and that his second wife had produced him a son who is reported to be a very fine young man The old marquis refused to see my sister or her child but sent her word that on condition of never hearing any more of her he would assign her a small pension and she might live in an old castle which he possessed in Murcia This had been the favourite habitation of his eldest son but since his flight from Spain the old marquis could not bear the place but let it fall to ruin and confusionMy sister accepted the proposal she retired to Murcia and has remained there till within the last month"  "And what brings her now to Madrid" enquired Don Lorenzo whom admiration of the young Antonia compelled to take a lively interest in the talkative old woman's narration  "Alas Segnor her fatherinlaw being  lately dead the steward of his Murcian estates has refused to pay her pension any longer With the design of supplicating his son to renew it she is now come to Madrid but I doubt that she might have saved herself the trouble You young noblemen have always enough to do with your money and are not very often disposed to throw it away upon old women I advised my sister to send Antonia with her petition but she would not hear of such a thing She is so obstinate Well she will find herself the worse for not following my counsels the girl has a good pretty face and possibly might have done much"  "Ah Segnora" interrupted Don Christoval counterfeiting a passionate air "if a pretty face will do the business why has not your sister recourse to you"  "Oh Jesus my lord I swear you quite overpower me with your gallantry But I promise you that I am too well aware of the danger of such expeditions to trust  myself in a young nobleman's power No no I have as yet preserved my reputation without blemish or reproach and I always knew how to keep the men at a proper distance"  "Of that Segnora I have not the least doubt But permit me to ask you Have you then any aversion to matrimony"  "That is an home question I cannot but confess that if an amiable cavalier was to present himself"  Here she intended to throw a tender and significant look upon Don Christoval but as she unluckily happened to squint most abominably the glance fell directly upon his companion Lorenzo took the compliment to himself and answered it by a profound bow  "May I enquire" said he "the name of the marquis"  "The marquis de las Cisternas"  "I know him intimately well He is not at present in Madrid but is expected here daily He is one of the best of men  and if the lovely Antonia will permit me to be her advocate with him I doubt not my being able to make a favourable report of her cause"  Antonia raised her blue eyes and silently thanked him for the offer by a smile of inexpressible sweetness Leonella's satisfaction was much more loud and audible Indeed as her niece was generally silent in her company she thought it incumbent upon her to talk enough for both this she managed without difficulty for she very seldom found herself deficient in words  "Oh Segnor" she cried "you will lay our whole family under the most signal obligations I accept your offer with all possible gratitude and return you a thousand thanks for the generosity of your proposal Antonia why do not you speak child While the cavalier says all sorts of civil things to you you sit like a statue and never utter a syllable of thanks either bad good or indifferent"  "My dear aunt I am very sensible that"  "Fye niece How often have I told you that you never should interrupt a person who is speaking When did you ever know me do such a thing Are these your Murcian manners Mercy on me I shall never be able to make this girl any thing like a person of good breeding But pray Segnor" she continued addressing herself to Don Christoval "inform me why such a crowd is assembled today in this cathedral"  "Can you possibly be ignorant that Ambrosio abbot of this monastery pronounces a sermon in this church every Thursday All Madrid rings with his praises As yet he has preached but thrice but all who have heard him are so delighted with his eloquence that it is as difficult to obtain a place at church as at the first representation of a new comedy His fame certainly must have reached your ears"  "Alas Segnor till yesterday I never had the good fortune to see Madrid and at Cordova we are so little informed of  what is passing in the rest of the world that the name of Ambrosio has never been mentioned in its precincts"  "You will find it in every one's mouth at Madrid He seems to have fascinated the inhabitants and not having attended his sermons myself I am astonished at the enthusiasm which he has excited The adoration paid him both by young and old by man and woman is unexampled The grandees load him with presents their wives refuse to have any other confessor and he is known through all the city by the name of The Man of Holiness"  "Undoubtedly Segnor he is of noble origin"  "That point still remains undecided The late superior of the Capuchins found him while yet an infant at the abbeydoor All attempts to discover who had left him there were vain and the child himself could give no account of his parents He was educated in the monastery where he has remained ever since He early showed a  strong inclination for study and retirement and as soon as he was of a proper age he pronounced his vows No one has ever appeared to claim him or clear up the mystery which conceals his birth and the monks who find their account in the favour which is shewn to their establishment from respect to him have not hesitated to publish that he is a present to them from the Virgin In truth the singular austerity of his life gives some countenance to the report He is now thirty years old every hour of which period has been passed in study total seclusion from the world and mortification of the flesh Till these last three weeks when he was chosen superior of the society to which he belongs he had never been on the outside of the abbeywalls Even now he never quits them except on Thursdays when he delivers a discourse in this cathedral which all Madrid assembles to hear His knowledge is said to be the most profound his eloquence the most persuasive In the whole course of his life  he has never been known to transgress a single rule of his order the smallest stain is not to be discovered upon his character and he is reported to be so strict an observer of chastity that he knows not in what consists the difference of man and woman The common people therefore esteem him to be a saint"  "Does that make a saint" enquired Antonia "Bless me then am I one"  "Holy St Barbara" exclaimed Leonella "what a question Fye child fye these are not fit subjects for young women to handle You should not seem to remember that there is such a thing as a man in the world and you ought to imagine every body to be of the same sex with yourself I should like to see you give people to understand that you know that a man has no breasts and no hips and no"  Luckily for Antonia's ignorance which her aunt's lecture would soon have dispelled an universal murmur through the  church announced the preacher's arrival Donna Leonella rose from her seat to take a better view of him and Antonia followed her example  He was a man of noble port and commanding presence His stature was lofty and his features uncommonly handsome His nose was aquiline his eyes large black and sparkling and his dark brows almost joined together His complexion was of a deep but clear brown study and watching had entirely deprived his cheek of colour Tranquillity reigned upon his smooth unwrinkled forehead and content expressed upon every feature seemed to announce the man equally unacquainted with cares and crimes He bowed himself with humility to the audience Still there was a certain severity in his look and manner that inspired universal awe and few could sustain the glance of his eye at once fiery and penetrating Such was Ambrosio abbot of the Capuchins and surnamed "The Man of Holiness"  Antonia while she gazed upon him eagerly felt a pleasure fluttering in her bosom which till then had been unknown to her and for which she in vain endeavoured to account She waited with impatience till the sermon should begin and when at length the friar spoke the sound of his voice seemed to penetrate into her very soul Though no other of the spectators felt such violent sensations as did the young Antonia yet every one listened with interest and emotion They who were insensible to religion's merits were still enchanted with Ambrosio's oratory All found their attention irresistibly attracted while he spoke and the most profound silence reigned through the crowded aisles Even Lorenzo could not resist the charm he forgot that Antonia was seated near him and listened to the preacher with undivided attention  In language nervous clear and simple the monk expatiated on the beauties of religion He explained some abstruse parts of the  sacred writings in a style that carried with it universal conviction His voice at once distinct and deep was fraught with all the terrors of the tempest while he inveighed against the vices of humanity and described the punishments reserved for them in a future state Every hearer looked back upon his past offences and trembled the thunder seemed to roll whose bolt was destined to crush him and the abyss of eternal destruction to open before his feet But when Ambrosio changing his theme spoke of the excellence of an unsullied conscience of the glorious prospect which eternity presented to the soul untainted with reproach and of the recompense which awaited it in the regions of everlasting glory his auditors felt their scattered spirits insensibly return They threw themselves with confidence upon the mercy of their judge they hung with delight upon the consoling words of the preacher and while his full voice swelled into melody they were transported to those happy  regions which he painted to their imaginations in colours so brilliant and glowing  The discourse was of considerable length yet when it concluded the audience grieved that it had not lasted longer Though the monk had ceased to speak enthusiastic silence still prevailed through the church At length the charm gradually dissolving the general admiration was expressed in audible terms As Ambrosio descended from the pulpit his auditors crowded round him loaded him with blessings threw themselves at his feet and kissed the hem of his garment He passed on slowly with his hands crossed devoutly upon his bosom to the door opening into the abbeychapel at which his monks waited to receive him He ascended the steps and then turning towards his followers addressed to them a few words of gratitude and exhortation While he spoke his rosary composed of large grains of amber fell from his hand and dropped among the surrounding multitude  It was seized eagerly and immediately divided amidst the spectators Whoever became possessor of a bead preserved it as a sacred relique and had it been the chaplet of thriceblessed St Francis himself it could not have been disputed with greater vivacity The abbot smiling at their eagerness pronounced his benediction and quitted the church while humility dwelt upon every feature Dwelt she also in his heart  Antonia's eyes followed him with anxiety As the door closed after him it seemed to her as she had lost some one essential to her happiness A tear stole in silence down her cheek  "He is separated from the world" said she to herself "perhaps I shall never see him more"  As she wiped away the tear Lorenzo observed her action  "Are you satisfied with our orator" said he "or do you think that Madrid overrates his talents"  Antonia's heart was so filled with admiration for the monk that she eagerly seized the opportunity of speaking of him besides as she now no longer considered Lorenzo as an absolute stranger she was less embarrassed by her excessive timidity  "Oh he far exceeds all my expectations" answered she "till this moment I had no idea of the powers of eloquence But when he spoke his voice inspired me with such interest such esteem I might almost say such affection for him that I am myself astonished at the acuteness of my feelings"  Lorenzo smiled at the strength of her expressions  "You are young and just entering into life" said he "your heart new to the world and full of warmth and sensibility receives its first impressions with eagerness Artless yourself you suspect not others of deceit and viewing the world through the medium of your own truth and innocence you fancy all who surround you to deserve  your confidence and esteem What pity that these gay visions must soon be dissipated What pity that you must soon discover the baseness of mankind and guard against your fellowcreatures as against your  oes"  "Alas Segnor" replied Antonia "the misfortunes of my parents have already placed before me but too many sad examples of the perfidy of the world Yet surely in the present instance the warmth of sympathy cannot have deceived me"  "In the present instance I allow that it has not Ambrosio's character is perfectly without reproach and a man who has passed the whole of his life within the walls of a convent cannot have found the opportunity to be guilty even were he possessed of the inclination But now when obliged by the duties of his situation he must enter occasionally into the world and be thrown into the way of temptation it is now that it behoves him to show the brilliance of his virtue The trial is dangerous  he is just at that period of life when the passions are most vigorous unbridled and despotic his established reputation will mark him out to seduction as an illustrious victim novelty will give additional charms to the allurements of pleasure and even the talents with which nature has endowed him will contribute to his ruin by facilitating the means of obtaining his object Very few would return victorious from a contest so severe"  "Ah surely Ambrosio will be one of those few"  "Of that I have myself no doubt by all accounts he is an exception to mankind in general and envy would seek in vain for a blot upon his character"  "Segnor you delight me by this assurance It encourages me to indulge my prepossession in his favour and you know not with what pain I should have repressed the sentiment Ah dearest aunt entreat my mother to choose him for our confessor"  "I entreat her" replied Leonella "I promise you that I shall do no such thing I do not like this same Ambrosio in the least he has a look of severity about him that made me tremble from head to foot Were he my confessor I should never have the courage to avow one half of my peccadilloes and then I should be in a rare condition I never saw such a sternlooking mortal and hope that I never shall see such another His description of the devil God bless us almost terrified me out of my wits and when h  spoke about sinners he seemed as if he was ready to eat them"  "You are right Segnora" answered Don Christoval "Too great severity is said to be Ambrosio's only fault Exempted himself from human failings he is not sufficiently indulgent to those of others and though strictly just and disinterested in his decisions his government of the monks has already shown some proofs of his inflexibility But the crowd is nearly  dissipated will you permit us to attend you home"  "O Christ Segnor" exclaimed Leonella affecting to blush "I would not suffer such a thing for the universe If I came home attended by so gallant a cavalier my sister is so scrupulous that she would read me an hour's lecture and I should never hear the last of it Besides I rather wish you not to make your proposals just at present"  My proposals I assure you Segnora"  "Oh Segnor I believe that your assurances of impatience are all very true but really I must desire a little respite It would not be quite so delicate in me to accept your hand at first sight"  "Accept my hand As I hope to live and breathe"  "Oh dear Segnor press me no further if you love me I shall consider your obedience as a proof of your affection you shall hear from me tomorrow and so  farewell But pray cavaliers may I not enquire your names"  "My friend's" replied Lorenzo "is the Condé d'Ossorio and mine Lorenzo de Medina"  "'Tis sufficient Well Don Lorenzo I shall acquaint my sister with your obliging offer and let you know the result with all expedition Where may I send to you"  "I am always to be found at the Medina palace"  "You may depend upon hearing from me Farewell cavaliers Segnor Condé let me entreat you to moderate the excessive ardour of your passion However to prove that I am not displeased with you and prevent your abandoning yourself to despair receive this mark of my affection and sometimes bestow a thought upon the absent Leonella"  As she said this she extended a lean and wrinkled hand which her supposed admirer  kissed with such sorry grace and constraint so evident that Lorenzo with difficulty repressed his inclination to laugh Leonella then hastened to quit the church the lovely Antonia followed her in silence but when she reached the porch she turned involuntarily and cast back her eyes towards Lorenzo He bowed to her as bidding her farewell she returned the compliment and hastily withdrew  "So Lorenzo" said Don Christoval as soon as they were alone "you have procured me an agreeable intrigue To favour your designs upon Antonia I obligingly make a few civil speeches which mean nothing to the aunt and at the end of an hour I find myself upon the brink of matrimony How will you reward me for having suffered so grievously for your sake What can repay me for having kissed the leathern paw of that confounded old witch Diavolo She has left such a scent upon my lips that I shall smell of  garlick for this month to come As I pass along the Prado I shall be taken for a walking omelet or some large onion running to seed"  "I confess my poor count" replied Lorenzo "that your service has been attended with danger yet am I so far from supposing it to be past all endurance that I shall probably solicit you to carry on your amours still further"  "From that petition I conclude that the little Antonia has made some impression upon you"  "I cannot express to you how much I am charmed with her Since my father's death my uncle the duke de Medina has signified to me his wishes to see me married I have till now eluded his hints and refused to understand them but what I have seen this evening"  "Well what have you seen this evening Why surely Don Lorenzo you cannot be mad enough to think of making a wife out of this granddaughter of  'as honest a painstaking shoemaker as any in Cordova'"  "You forget that she is also the granddaughter of the late marquis de las Cisternas but without disputing about birth and titles I must assure you that I never beheld a woman so interesting as Antonia"  "Very possibly but you cannot mean to marry her"  "Why not my dear condé I shall have wealth enough for both of us and you know that my uncle thinks liberally upon the subject From what I have seen of Raymond de las Cisternas I am certain that he will readily acknowledge Antonia for his niece Her birth therefore will be no objection to my offering her my hand I should be a villain could I think of her on any other terms than marriage and in truth she seems possessed of every quality requisite to make me happy in a wife young lovely gentle sensible"  "Sensible Why she said nothing but Yes and No"  "She did not say much more I must confessbut then she always said Yes or No in the right place"  "Did she so Oh your most obedient That is using a right lover's argument and I dare dispute no longer with so profound a casuist Suppose we adjourn to the comedy"  "It is out of my power I only arrived last night at Madrid and have not yet had an opportunity of seeing my sister You know that her convent is in this street and I was going thither when the crowd which I saw thronging into this church excited my curiosity to know what was the matter I shall now pursue my first intention and probably pass the evening with my sister at the parlourgrate"  "Your sister in a convent say you Oh very true I had forgotten And how does Donna Agnes I am amazed Don Lorenzo how you could possibly think of immuring so charming a girl within the walls of a cloister"  "I think of it Don Christoval How can you suspect me of such barbarity You are conscious that she took the veil by her own desire and that particular circumstances made her wish for a seclusion from the world I used every means in my power to induce her to change her resolution the endeavour was fruitless and I lost a sister"  "The luckier fellow you I think Lorenzo you were a considerable gainer by that loss if I remember right Donna Agnes had a portion of ten thousand pistoles half of which reverted to your lordship By St Jago I wish that I had fifty sisters in the same predicament I should consent to losing them every soul without much heartburning"  "How condé" said Lorenzo in an angry voice "do you suppose me base enough to have influenced my sister's retirement do you suppose that the despicable wish to make myself master of her fortune could"  "Admirable Courage Don Lorenzo Now the man is all in a blaze God grant that Antonia may soften that fiery temper or we shall certainly cut each other's throat before the month is over However to prevent such a tragical catastrophe for the present I shall make a retreat and leave you master of the field Farewell my knight of Mount Aetna Moderate that inflammable disposition and remember that whenever it is necessary to make love to yonder harridan you may reckon upon my services"  He said and darted out of the cathedral  "How wildbrained" said Lorenzo "With so excellent an heart what pity that he possesses so little solidity of judgment"  The night was now fast advancing The lamps were not yet lighted The faint beams of the rising moon scarcely could pierce through the gothic obscurity of the church Lorenzo found himself unable to quit the spot The void left in  his bosom by Antonia's absence and his sister's sacrifice which Don Christoval had just recalled to his imagination created that melancholy of mind which accorded but too well with the religious gloom surrounding him He was still leaning against the seventh column from the pulpit A soft and cooling air breathed along the solitary aisles the moonbeams darting into the church through painted windows tinged the fretted roofs and massy pillars with a thousand various shades of light and colours Universal silence prevailed around only interrupted by the occasional closing of doors in the adjoining abbey  The calm of the hour and solitude of the place contributed to nourish Lorenzo's disposition to melancholy He threw himself upon a seat which stood near him and abandoned himself to the delusions of his fancy He thought of his union with Antonia he thought of the obstacles which might oppose his wishes and a thousand changing visions floated  before his fancy sad 'tis true but not unpleasing Sleep insensibly stole over him and the tranquil solemnity of his mind when awake for a while continued to influence his slumbers  He still fancied himself to be in the church of the Capuchins but it was no longer dark and solitary Multitudes of silver lamps shed splendour from the vaulted roofs accompanied by the captivating chaunt of distant choristers the organ's melody swelled through the church the altar seemed decorated as for some distinguished feast it was surrounded by a brilliant company and near it stood Antonia arrayed in bridal white and blushing with all the charms of virgin modesty  Half hoping half fearing Lorenzo gazed upon the scene before him Sudden the door leading to the abbey unclosed and he saw attended by a long train of monks the preacher advance to whom he had just listened with so much admiration He drew near Antonia  "And where is the bridegroom" said the imaginary friar  Antonia seemed to look round the church with anxiety Involuntarily the youth advanced a few steps from his concealment She saw him the blush of pleasure glowed upon her cheek with a graceful motion of her hand she beckoned to him to advance He disobeyed not the command he slew towards her and threw himself at her feet  She retreated for a moment then gazing upon him with unutterable delight "Yes" she exclaimed "my bridegroom my destined bridegroom"  She said and hastened to throw herself into his arms but before he had time to receive her an unknown rushed between them his form was gigantic his complexion was swarthy his eyes fierce and terrible his mouth breathed out volumes of fire and on his forehead was written in legible characters"Pride Lust Inhumanity"  Antonia shrieked The monster clasped  her in his arms and springing with her upon the altar tortured her with his odious caresses She endeavoured in vain to escape from his embrace Lorenzo flew to her succour but ere he had time to reach her a loud burst of thunder was heard Instantly the cathedral seemed crumbling into pieces the monks betook themselves to slight shrieking fearfully the lamps were extinguished the altar sunk down and in its place appeared an abyss vomiting forth clouds of flame Uttering a loud and terrible cry the monster plunged into the gulph and in his fall attempted to drag Antonia with him He strove in vain Animated by supernatural powers she disengaged herself from his embrace but her white robe was left in his possession Instantly a wing of brilliant splendour spread itself from either of Antonia's arms She darted upwards and while ascending cried to Lorenzo "Friend we shall meet above"  At the same moment the roof of the cathedral  opened harmonious voices pealed along the vaults and the glory into which Antonia was received was composed of rays of such dazzling brightness that Lorenzo was unable to sustain the gaze His sight failed and he sunk upon the ground  When he awoke he found himself extended upon the pavement of the church it was illuminated and the chaunt of hymns sounded from a distance For a while Lorenzo could not persuade himself that what he had just witnessed had been a dream so strong an impression had it made upon his fancy A little recollection convinced him of its fallacy the lamps had been lighted during his sleep and the music which he heard was occasioned by the monks who were celebrating their vespers in the abbeychapel  Lorenzo rose and prepared to bend his steps towards his sister's convent his mind fully occupied by the singularity of his dream He already drew near the porch when his attention was attracted by  perceiving a shadow moving upon the opposite wall He looked curiously round and soon descried a man wrapped up in his cloak who seemed carefully examining whether his actions were observed Very few people are exempt from the influence of curiosity The unknown seemed anxious to conceal his business in the cathedral and it was this very circumstance which made Lorenzo wish to discover what he was about  Our hero was conscious that he had no right to pry into the secrets of this unknown cavalier  "I will go" said Lorenzo And Lorenzo stayed where he was  The shadow thrown by the column effectually concealed him from the stranger who continued to advance with caution At length he drew a letter from beneath his cloak and hastily placed it beneath a colossal statue of St Francis Then retiring with precipitation he concealed himself in a part of the church at a considerable  distance from that in which the image stood  "So" said Lorenzo to himself "this is only some foolish love affair I believe I may as well be gone for I can do no good in it"  In truth till that moment it never came into his head that he could do any good in it but he thought it necessary to make some little excuse to himself for having indulged his curiosity He now made a second attempt to retire from the church For this time he gained the porch without meeting with any impediment but it was destined that he should pay it another visit that night As he descended the steps leading into the street a cavalier rushed against him with such violence that both were nearly overturned by the concussion Lorenzo put his hand to his sword  "How now Segnor" said he "what mean you by this rudeness"  "Ha is it you Medina" replied the new comer whom Lorenzo by his voice  now recognized for Don Christoval "You  re the luckiest fellow in the universe not  o have left the church before my return  n in my dear lad they will be here immediately"  "Who will be here"  "The old hen and all her pretty little chickens In I say and then you shall know the whole history"  Lorenzo followed him into the cathedral and they concealed themselves behind the statue of St Francis  "And now" said our hero "may I take the liberty of asking what is the meaning of all this haste and rapture"  "Oh Lorenzo we shall see such a glorious sight The prioress of St Clare and her whole train of nuns are coming hither You are to know that the pious father Ambrosio the Lord reward him for it will upon no account move out of his own precincts It being absolutely necessary for every fashionable convent to have him for its confessor  the nuns are in consequence obliged to visit him at the abbey since when the mountain will not come to Mahomet Mahomet must needs go to the mountain Now the prioress of St Clare the better to escape the gaze of such impure eyes as belong to yourself and your humble servant thinks proper to bring her holy flock to confession in the dusk she is to be admitted into the abbeychapel by you private door The porteress of St Clare who is a worthy old soul and a particular friend of mine has just assured me of their being here in a few moments There is news for you you rogue We shall see some of the prettiest faces in Madrid"  "In truth Christoval we shall do no such thing The nuns are always veiled"  "No no I know better On entering a place of worship they ever take off their veils from respect to the saint to whom 'tis dedicated But hark they are coming Silence silence Observe and be convinced"  "Good" said Lorenzo to himself "I may possibly discover to whom the vows are addressed of this mysterious stranger"  Scarcely had Don Christoval ceased to speak when the domina of St Clare appeared followed by a long procession of nuns Each upon entering the church took off her veil The prioress crossed her hands upon her bosom and made a profound reverence as she passed the statue of St Francis the patron of this cathedral The nuns followed her example and several moved onwards without having satisfied Lorenzo's curiosity He almost began to despair of seeing the mystery cleared up when in paying her respects to St Francis one of the nuns happened to drop her rosary As she stooped to pick it up the light flashed full in her face At the same moment she dexterously removed the letter from beneath the image placed it in her bosom and hastened to resume her rank in the procession  "Ha" said Christoval in a low  voice "here we have some little intrigue no doubt"  "Agnes by heaven" cried Lorenzo  "What your sister Diavolo Then somebody I suppose will have to pay for our peeping"  "And shall pay for it without delay" replied the incensed brother  The pious procession had now entered the abbey the door was already closed upon it The unknown immediately quitted his concealment and hastened to leave the church ere he could effect his intention he descried Medina stationed in his passage The stranger hastily retreated and drew his hat over his eyes  "Attempt not to fly me" exclaimed Lorenzo "I will know who you are and what were the contents of that letter"  "Of that letter" repeated the unknown "And by what title do you ask the question"  "By a title of which I am now ashamed but it becomes not you to question me  Either reply circumstantially to my demands or answer me with your sword"  "The latter method will be the shortest" rejoined the other drawing his rapier "come on Segnor Bravo I am ready"  Burning with rage Lorenzo hastened to the attack the antagonists had already exchanged several passes before Christoval who at that moment had more sense than either of them could throw himself between their weapons  "Hold hold Medina" he exclaimed "remember the consequences of shedding blood on consecrated ground"  The stranger immediately dropped his sword  "Medina" he cried "Great God is it possible Lorenzo have you quite forgotten Raymond de las Cisternas"  Lorenzo's astonishment increased with every succeeding moment Raymond advanced towards him but with a look of suspicion he drew back his hand which the other was preparing to take  "You here Marquis What is the  meaning of all this You engaged in a clandestine correspondence with my sister whose affections"  "Have ever been and still are mine But this is no fit place for an explanation Accompany me to my hotel and you shall know every thing Who is that with you"  "One whom I believe you to have seen before" replied Don Christoval "though probably not at church"  "The condé d'Ossorio"  "Exactly so marquis"  "I have no objection to entrusting you with my secret for I am sure that I may depend upon your silence"  "Then your opinion of me is better than my own and therefore I must beg leave to decline your confidence Do you go your own way and I shall go mine Marquis where are you to be found"  "As usual at the hotel de las Cisternas but remember that I am incognito and that if you wish to see me you must ask for Alphonso d'Alvarada"  "Good good Farewell cavaliers" said Don Christoval and instantly departed  "You marquis" said Lorenzo in the accent of surprise "you Alphonso d'Alvarada"  "Even so Lorenzo but unless you have already heard my story from your sister I have much to relate that will astonish you Follow me therefore to my hotel without delay"  At this moment the porter of the Capuchins entered the cathedral to lock up the doors for the night The two noblemen instantly withdrew and hastened with all speed to the palace de las Cisternas  "Well Antonia" said the aunt as soon as she had quitted the church" what think you of our gallants Don Lorenzo really seems a very obliging good sort of young man he paid you some attention and nobody  knows what may come of it But as to Don Christoval I protest to you he is the very phoenix of politeness so gallant so wellbred so sensible and so pathetic Well if ever man can prevail upon me to break my vow never to marry it will be that Don Christoval You see niece that every thing turns out exactly as I told you the very moment that I produced myself in Madrid I knew that I should be surrounded by admirers When I took off my veil did you see Antonia what an effect the action had upon the condé And when I presented him my hand did you observe the air of passion with which he kissed it If ever I witnessed real love I then saw it impressed upon Don Christoval's countenance"  Now Antonia had observed the air with which Don Christoval had kissed this same hand but as she drew conclusions from it somewhat different from her aunt's she was wise enough to hold her tongue As this is the only instance known of a woman's  ever having done so it was judged worthy to be recorded here  The old lady continued her discourse to Antonia in the same strain till they gained the street in which was their lodging Here a crowd collected before their door permitted them not to approach it and placing themselves on the opposite side of the street they endeavoured to make out what had drawn all these people together After some minutes the crowd formed itself into a circle and now Antonia perceived in the midst of it a woman of extraordinary height who whirled herself repeatedly round and round using all sorts of extravagant gestures Her dress was composed of shreds of variouscoloured silks and linens fantastically arranged yet not entirely without taste Her head was covered with a kind of turban ornamented with vineleaves and wild flowers She seemed much sunburnt and her complexion was of a deep olive her eyes looked fiery and strange and in her hand she  bore a long black rod with which she at intervals traced a variety of singular figures upon the ground round about which she danced in all the eccentric attitudes of folly and delirium Suddenly she broke off her dance whirled herself round thrice with rapidity and after a moment's pause she sung the following ballad  THE GIPSY's SONG  COME cross my hand My art surpasses  All that did ever mortal know  Come maidens come My magic glasses  Your future husband's form can show  For 'tis to me the power is given  Unclosed the book of fate to see  To read the fixed resolves of heaven  And dive into futurity  I guide the pale moon's silver waggon  The winds in magic bonds I hold  I charm to sleep the crimson dragon  Who loves to watch o'er buried gold  Fenced round with spells unhurt I venture  Their sabbath strange where witches keep  Fearless the sorcerer's circle enter  And woundless tread on snakes asleep  Lo here are charms of mighty power  This makes secure an husband's truth  And this composed at midnight hour  Will force to love the coldest youth  If any maid too much has granted  Her loss this philtre will repair  This blooms a cheek where red is wanted  And this will make a brown girl fair  Then silent hear while I discover  What I in fortune's mirror view  And each when many a year is over  Shall own the Gipsy's sayings true  "Dear aunt" said Antonia when the stranger had finished "is she not mad"  "Mad Not she child she is only wicked She is a gipsy a sort of vagabond whose sole occupation is to run about the country telling lyes and pilfering from those who come by their money honestly Out upon such vermin If I were king of Spain every one of them should be burnt alive who was found in my dominions after the next three weeks"  These words were pronounced so audibly that they reached the gipsy's ears She  immediately pierced through the crowd and made towards the ladies She saluted them thrice in the eastern fashion and then addressed herself to Antonia  THE GIPSY  "Lady gentle lady know  I your future fate can show  Give your hand and do not fear  Lady gentle lady hear"  "Dearest aunt" said Antonia "indulge me this once let me have my fortune told me"  "Nonsense child She will tell you nothing but falsehoods"  "No matter let me at least hear what she has to say Do my dear aunt oblige me I beseech you"  "Well well Antonia since you are so bent upon the thingHere good woman you shall see the hands of both of us There is money for you and now let me hear my fortune"  As she said this she drew off her glove and presented her hand The gipsy looked at it for a moment and then made this reply  THE GIPSY  "Your fortune You are now so old  Good dame that 'tis already told  Yet for your money in a trice  I will repay you in advice  Astonished at your childish vanity  Your friends all tax you with insanity  And grieve to see you use your art  To catch some youthful lover's heart  Believe me dame when all is done  Your age will still be fiftyone  And men will rarely take an hint  Of love from two grey eyes that squint  Take then my counsels lay aside  Your paint and patches lust and pride  And on the poor those sums bestow  Which now are spent on useless show  Think on your Maker not a suitor  Think on your past faults not on future  And think Time's scythe will quickly mow  The few red hairs which deck your brow  The audience rang with laughter during  the gipsy's address and"fiftyone"squinting eyesred hairpaint and patches"c were bandied from mouth to mouth Leonella was almost choaked with passion and loaded her malicious adviser with the bitterest reproaches The swarthy prophetess for some time listened to her with a contemptuous smile at length she made her a short answer and then turned to Antonia  THE GIPSY  "Peace lady What I said was true  And now my lovely maid to you  Give me your hand and let me see  Your future doom and heaven's decree"  In imitation of Leonella Antonia drew off her glove and presented her white hand to the gipsy who having gazed upon it for some time with a mingled expression of pity and astonishment pronounced her oracle in the following words  THE GIPSY  "Jesus what a palm is there  Chaste and gentle young and fair  Perfect mind and form possessing  You would be some good man's blessing  But alas this line discovers  That destruction o'er you hovers  Lustful man and crafty devil  Will combine to work your evil  And from earth by sorrows driven  Soon your soul must speed to heaven  Yet your sufferings to delay  Well remember what I say  When you one more virtuous see  Than belongs to man to be  One whose self no crimes assailing  Pities not his neighbour's sailing  Call the gipsy's words to mind  Though he seem so good and kind  Fair exteriors oft will hide  Hearts that swell with lust and pride  Lovely maid with tears I leave you  Let not my prediction grieve you  Rather with submission bending  Calmly wait distress impending  And expect eternal bliss  In a better world than this  Having said this the gipsy again whirled herself round thrice and then hastened out of the street with frantic gesture The  crowd followed her and Elvira's door being now unembarrassed Leonella entered the house out of humour with the gipsy with her niece and with the people in short with every body but herself and her charming cavalier The gipsy's predictions had also considerably affected Antonia but the impression soon wore off and in a few hours she had forgotten the adventure as totally as had it never taken place  CHAP II  Fòrse sé tu gustassi una sòl volta  La millésima parte délle giòje  Ché gusta un còr amato riamando  Diresti ripentita sospirando  Perduto è tutto il tempo  Ché in amar non si spènde  TASSO  Hadst thou but tasted once the thousandth part  Of joys which bless the loved and loving heart  Your words repentant and your sighs would prove  Lost is the time which is not past in love  THE monks having attended their abbot to the door of his cell he dismissed them with an air of conscious superiority in which humility's semblance combated with the reality of pride  He was no sooner alone than he gave free loose to the indulgence of his vanity  When he remembered the enthusiasm which his discourse had excited his heart swelled with rapture and his imagination presented him with splendid visions of aggrandizement He looked round him with exultation and pride told him loudly that he was superior to the rest of his fellowcreatures  "Who" thought he "who but myself has passed the ordeal of youth yet sees no single stain upon his conscience Who else has subdued the violence of strong passions and an impetuous temperament and submitted even from the dawn of life to voluntary retirement I seek for such a man in vain I see no one but myself possessed of such resolution Religion cannot boast Ambrosio's equal How powerful an effect did my discourse produce upon its auditors How they crowded round me How they loaded me with benedictions and pronounced me the sole uncorrupted pillar of the church What then now is left for me to do Nothing but to  watch as carefully over the conduct of my brethren as I have hitherto watched over my own Yet hold May I not be tempted from those paths which till now I have pursued without one moment's wandering Am I not a man whose nature is frail and prone to error I must now abandon the solitude of my retreat the fairest and noblest dames of Madrid continually present themselves at the abbey and will use no other confessor I must accustom my eyes to objects of temptation and expose myself to the seduction of luxury and desire Should I meet in that world which I am constrained to enter some lovely female lovely as youMadona"  As he said this he fixed his eyes upon a picture of the Virgin which was suspended opposite to him this for two years had been the object of his increasing wonder and adoration He paused and gazed upon it with delight  "What beauty in that countenance" he continued after a silence of some minutes  "how graceful is the turn of that head what sweetness yet what majesty in her divine eyes how softly her cheek reclines upon her hand Can the rose vie with the blush of that cheek can the lily rival the whiteness of that hand Oh if such a creature existed and existed but for me were I permitted to twine round my fingers those golden ringlets and press with my lips the treasures of that snowy bosom gracious God should I then resist the temptation Should I not barter for a single embrace the reward of my sufferings for thirty years Should I not abandonFool that I am Whither do I suffer my admiration of this picture to hurry me Away impure ideas Let me remember that woman is for ever lost to me Never was mortal formed so perfect as this picture But even did such exist the trial might be too mighty for a common virtue but Ambrosio's is proof against temptation Temptation did I say To me it would be none What  charms me when ideal and considered as a superior being would disgust me become woman and tainted with all the failings of mortality It is not the woman's beauty that fills me with such enthusiasm it is the painter's skill that I admire it is the Divinity that I adore Are not the passions dead in my bosom have I not freed myself from the frailty of mankind Fear not Ambrosio Take confidence in the strength of your virtue Enter boldly into the world to whose failings you are superior reflect that you are now exempted from humanity's defects and defy all the arts of the spirits of darkness They shall know you for what you are"  Here his reverie was interrupted by three soft knocks at the door of his cell With difficulty did the abbot awake from his delirium The knocking was repeated  "Who is there" said Ambrosio at length  "It is only Rosario" replied a gentle voice  "Enter enter my son"  The door was immediately opened and Rosario appeared with a small basket in his hand  Rosario was a young novice belonging to the monastery who in three months intended to make his profession A sort of mystery enveloped this youth which rendered him at once an object of interest and curiosity His hatred of society his profound melancholy his rigid observation of the duties of his order and his voluntary seclusion from the world at his age so unusual attracted the notice of the whole fraternity He seemed fearful of being recognised and no one had ever seen his face His head was continually muffled up in his cowl yet such of his features as accident discovered appeared the most beautiful and noble Rosario was the only name by which he was known in the monastery No one knew from whence he came and when questioned on the subject he preserved a profound silence A stranger whose rich  habit and magnificent equipage declared him to be of distinguished rank had engaged the monks to receive a novice and had deposited the necessary sums The next day he returned with Rosario and from that time no more had been heard of him  The youth had carefully avoided the company of the monks he answered their civilities with sweetness but reserve and evidently showed that his inclination led him to solitude To this general rule the superior was the only exception To him he looked up with a respect approaching idolatry he sought his company with the most attentive assiduity and eagerly seized every means to ingratiate himself in his favour In the abbot's society his heart seemed to be at ease and an air of gaiety pervaded his whole manners and discourse Ambrosio on his side did not feel less attracted towards the youth with him alone did he lay aside his habitual severity When he spoke to him he insensibly assumed  a tone milder than was usual to him and no voice sounded so sweet to him as did Rosario's He repaid the youth's attentions by instructing him in various sciences the novice received his lessons with docility Ambrosio was every day more charmed with the vivacity of his genius the simplicity of his manners and the rectitude of his heart in short he loved him with all the affection of a father He could not help sometimes indulging a desire secretly to see the face of his pupil but his rule of selfdenial extended even to curiosity and prevented him from communicating his wishes to the youth  "Pardon my intrusion father" said Rosario while he placed his basket upon the table "I come to you a suppliant Hearing that a dear friend is dangerously ill I entreat your prayers for his recovery If supplications can prevail upon heaven to spare him surely yours must be efficacious"  Whatever depends upon me my son you know that you may command What is your friend's name"  "Vincentio della Ronda"  "'Tis sufficient I will not forget him in my prayers and may our thriceblessed St Francis deign to listen to my intercessionWhat have you in your basket Rosario"  "A few of those flowers reverend father which I have observed to be most acceptable to you Will you permit my arranging them in your chamber"  "Your attentions charm me my son"  While Rosario dispersed the contents of his basket in small vases placed for that purpose in various parts of the room the abbot thus continued the conversation  "I saw you not in the church this evening Rosario"  "Yet I was present father I am too grateful for your protection to lose an opportunity of witnessing your triumph"  "Alas Rosario I have but little cause  to triumph the saint spoke by my mouth to him belongs all the merit It seems then you were contented with my discourse"  "Contented say you Oh you surpassed yourself Never did I hear such eloquencesave once"  Here the novice heaved an involuntary sigh  "When was that once" demanded the abbot  "When you preached upon the sudden indisposition of our late superior"  "I remember it that is more than two years ago And were you present I knew you not at that time Rosario"  "'Tis true father and would to God I had expired ere I beheld that day What sufferings what sorrows should I have escaped"  "Sufferings at your age Rosario"  "Aye father sufferings which if known to you would equally raise your anger and compassion Sufferings which  form at once the torment and pleasure of my existence Yet in this retreat my bosom would feel tranquil were it not for the tortures of apprehension Oh God oh God how cruel is a life of fear Father I have given up all I have abandoned the world and its delights for ever nothing now remains nothing now has charms for me but your friendship but your affection If I lose that father oh if I lose that tremble at the effects of my despair"  "You apprehend the loss of my friendship How has my conduct justified this fear Know me better Rosario and think me worthy of your confidence What are your sufferings Reveal them to me and believe that if 'tis in my power to relieve them"  "Ah 'tis in no one's power but yours Yet I must not let you know them You would hate me for my avowal you would drive me from your presence with scorn and ignominy"  "My son I conjure you I entreat you"  "For pity's sake enquire no further I must notI dare notHark the bell rings for vespers Father your benediction and I leave you"  As he said this he threw himself upon his knees and received the blessing which he demanded Then pressing the abbot's hand to his lips he started from the ground and hastily quitted the apartment Soon after Ambrosio descended to vespers which were celebrated in a small chapel belonging to the abbey filled with surprise at the singularity of the youth's behaviour  Vespers being over the monks retired to their respective cells The abbot alone remained in the chapel to receive the nuns of St Clare He had not been long seated in the confessional chair before the prioress made her appearance Each of the nuns was heard in her turn while the others waited with the domina in the adjoining vestry Ambrosio listened to the confessions  with attention made many exhortations enjoined penance proportioned to each offence and for some time every thing went on as usual till at last one of the nuns conspicuous from the nobleness of her air and elegance of her figure carelessly permitted a letter to fall from her bosom She was retiring unconscious of her loss Ambrosio supposed it to have been written by some one of her relations and picked it up intending to restore it to her  "Stay daughter" said he "you have let fall"  At this moment the paper being already open his eye involuntarily read the first words He started back with surprise The nun had turned round on hearing his voice the perceived her letter in his hand and uttering a shriek of terror flew hastily to regain it  "Hold" said the friar in a tone of severity "daughter I must read this letter"  "Then I am lost" she exclaimed clasping her hands together wildly  All colour instantly faded from her face she trembled with agitation and was obliged to fold her arms round a pillar of the chapel to save herself from sinking upon the floor In the mean while the abbot read the following lines  "All is ready for your escape my dearest Agnes At twelve tomorrow night I shall expect to find you at the gardendoor I have obtained the key and a few hours will suffice to place you in a secure asylum Let no mistaken scruples induce you to reject the certain means of preserving yourself and the innocent creature whom you nourish in your bosom Remember that you had promised to be mine long ere you engaged yourself to the church that your situation will soon be evident to the prying eyes of your companions and that flight is the only means of avoiding the effects of their malevolent  resentment Farewell my Agnes my dear and destined wife Fail not to be at the gardendoor at twelve"  As soon as he had finished Ambrosio bent an eye stern and angry upon the imprudent nun  "This letter must to the prioress" said he and passed her  His words sounded like thunder to her ears she awoke from her torpidity only to be sensible of the dangers of her situation She followed him hastily and detained him by his garment  "Stay oh stay" she cried in the accents of despair while she threw herself at the friar's feet and bathed them with her tears "Father compassionate my youth Look with indulgence on a woman's weakness and deign to conceal my frailty The remainder of my life shall be employed in expiating this single fault and your lenity will bring back a soul to heaven"  "Amazing confidence What shall St Clare's convent become the retreat of prostitutes Shall I suffer the church of Christ to cherish in its bosom debauchery and shame Unworthy wretch such lenity would make me your accomplice Mercy would here be criminal You have abandoned yourself to a seducer's lust you have defiled the sacred habit by your impurity and still dare you think yourself deserving my compassion Hence nor detain me longer Where is the lady prioress" he added raising his voice  "Hold father hold Hear me but for one moment Tax me not with impurity nor think that I have erred from the warmth of temperament Long before I took the veil Raymond was master of my heart he inspired me with the purest the most irreproachable passion and was on the point of becoming my lawful husband An horrible adventure and the treachery of a relation separated us from each other I believed him for ever lost to  me and threw myself into a convent from motives of despair Accident again united us I could not refuse myself the melancholy pleasure of mingling my tears with his We met nightly in the gardens of St Clare and in an unguarded moment I violated my vows of chastity I shall soon become a mother Reverend Ambrosio take compassion on me take compassion on the innocent being whose existence is attached to mine If you discover my imprudence to the domina both of us are lost The punishment which the laws of St Clare assign to unfortunates like myself is most severe and cruel Worthy worthy father let not your own untainted conscience render you unfeeling towards those less able to withstand temptation Let not mercy be the only virtue of which your heart is unsusceptible Pity me most reverend Restore my letter nor doom me to inevitable destruction"  "Your boldness confounds me Shall  I  conceal your crime  I  whom you have  deceived by your feigned confessionNo daughter no I will render you a more essential service I will rescue you from perdition in spite of yourself Penance and mortification shall expiate your offence and severity force you back to the paths of holiness What ho Mother St Agatha"  "Father by all that is sacred by all that is most dear to you I supplicate I entreat"  "Release me I will not hear you Where is the domina Mother St Agatha where are you"  The door of the vestry opened and the prioress entered the chapel followed by her nuns  "Cruel cruel" exclaimed Agnes relinquishing her hold  Wild and desperate she threw herself upon the ground beating her bosom and rending her veil in all the delirium of despair The nuns gazed with astonishment upon the scene before them The friar now presented the fatal paper to the prioress  informed her of the manner in which he had found it and added that it was her business to decide what penance the delinquent merited  While she perused the letter the domina's countenance grew inflamed with passion What such a crime committed in her convent and made known to Ambrosio to the idol of Madrid to the man whom she was most anxious to impress with the opinion of the strictness and regularity of her house Words were inadequate to express her fury She was silent and darted upon the prostrate nun looks of menace and malignity  "Away with her to the convent" said she at length to some of her attendants  Two of the oldest nuns now approaching Agnes raised her forcibly from the ground and prepared to conduct her from the chapel  "What" she exclaimed suddenly shaking off their hold with distracted gestures "is all hope then lost Already do you  drag me to punishment Where are you Raymond Oh save me save me" Then casting upon the abbot a frantic look "Hear me" she continued "man of an hard heart Hear me proud stern and cruel You could have saved me you could have restored me to happiness and virtue but would not you are the destroyer of my soul you are my murderer and on you fall the curse of my death and my unborn infant's Insolent in your yetunshaken virtue you disdained the prayers of a penitent but God will shew mercy though you shew none And where is the merit of your boasted virtue What temptations have you vanquished Coward you have fled from it not opposed seduction But the day of trial will arrive Oh then when you yield to impetuous passions when you feel that man is weak and born to err when shuddering you look back upon your crimes and solicit with terror the mercy of your God oh in that fearful moment think upon me  think upon your cruelty think upon Agnes and despair of pardon"  As she uttered these last words her strength was exhausted and she sunk inanimate upon the bosom of a nun who stood near her She was immediately conveyed from the chapel and her companions followed her  Ambrosio had not listened to her reproaches without emotion A secret pang at his heart made him feel that he had treated this unfortunate with too great severity He therefore detained the prioress and ventured to pronounce some words in favour of the delinquent  "The violence of her despair" said he "proves that at least vice is not become familiar to her Perhaps by treating her with somewhat less rigour than is generally practised and mitigating in some degree the accustomed penance"  "Mitigate it father" interrupted the lady prioress "Not I believe me The laws of our order are strict and severe  they have fallen into disuse of late but the crime of Agnes shews me the necessity of their revival I go to signify my intention to the convent and Agnes shall be the first to feel the rigour of those laws which shall be obeyed to the very letter Father farewell"  Thus saying she hastened out of the chapel  "I have done my duty" said Ambrosio to himself  Still did he not feel perfectly satisfied by this reflection To dissipate the unpleasant ideas which this scene had excited in him upon quitting the chapel he descended into the abbeygarden In all Madrid there was no spot more beautiful or better regulated It was laid out with the most exquisite taste the choicest flowers adorned it in the height of luxuriance and though artfully arranged seemed only planted by the hand of Nature Fountains springing from basons of white marble cooled the air with perpetual showers and the  walls were entirely covered by jessamine vines and honeysuckles The hour now added to the beauty of the scene The full moon ranging through a blue and cloudless sky shed upon the trees a trembling lustre and the waters of the fountains sparkled in the silver beam a gentle breeze breathed the fragrance of orangeblossoms along the alleys and the nightingale poured forth her melodious murmur from the shelter of an artificial wilderness Thither the abbot bent his steps  In the bosom of this little grove stood a rustic grotto formed in imitation of an hermitage The walls were constructed of roots of trees and the interstices filled up with moss and ivy Seats of turf were placed on either side and a natural cascade fell from the rock above Buried in himself the monk approached the spot The universal calm had communicated itself to his bosom and a voluptuous tranquillity spread languor through his soul  He reached the hermitage and was entering  to repose himself when he stopped on perceiving it to be already occupied Extended upon one of the banks lay a man in a melancholy posture His head was supported upon his arm and he seemed lost in meditation The monk drew nearer and recognised Rosario he watched him in silence and entered not the hermitage After some minutes the youth raised his eyes and fixed them mournfully upon the opposite wall  "Yes" said he with a deep and plaintive sigh "I feel all the happiness of thy situation all the misery of my own Happy were I could I think like thee Could I look like thee with disgust upon mankind could bury myself for ever in some impenetrable solitude and forget that the world holds beings deserving to be loved O God what a blessing would misanthropy be to me"  "That is a singular thought Rosario" said the abbot entering the grotto  "You here reverend father" cried the novice  At the same time starting from his place in confusion he drew his cowl hastily over his face Ambrosio seated himself upon the bank and obliged the youth to place himself by him  "You must not indulge this disposition to melancholy" said he "What can possibly have made you view in so desirable a light misanthropy of all sentiments the most hateful"  "The perusal of these verses father which till now had escaped my observation The brightness of the moonbeams permitted my reading them and oh how I envy the feelings of the writer"  As he said this he pointed to a marble tablet fixed against the opposite wall on it were engraved the following lines  INSCRIPTION IN AN HERMITAGE  Whoe'er thou art these lines now reading  Think not though from the world receding  I joy my lonely days to lead in  This desert drear  That with remorse a conscience bleeding  Hath led me here  No thought of guilt my bosom sours  Freewilled I fled from courtly bowers  For well I saw in halls and towers  That Lust and Pride  The Archfiend's dearest darkest powers  In state preside  I saw mankind with vice incrusted  I saw that Honour's sword was rusted  That few for aught but folly lusted  That he was still deceiv'd who trusted  In love or friend  And hither came with men disgusted  My life to end  In this lone cave in garments lowly  Alike a foe to noisy folly  And browbent gloomy melancholy  I wear away  My life and in my office holy  Consume the day  Content and comfort bless me more in  This grot than e'er I felt before in  A palace and with thoughts still soaring  To God on high  Each night and morn with voice imploring  This wish I sigh  "Let me O Lord from life retire  Unknown each guilty worldly fire  Remorseful throb or loose desire  And when I die  Let me in this belief expire  To God I fly"  Stranger if full of youth and riot  As yet no grief has marred thy quiet  Thou haply throw'st a scornful eye at  The Hermit's prayer  But if thou hast a cause to sigh at  Thy fault or care  If thou hast known false love's vexation  Or hast been exil'd from thy nation  Or guilt affrights thy contemplation  And makes thee pine  Oh how must thou lament  thy  station  And envy mine  "Were it possible" said the friar "for man to be so totally wrapped up in himself as to live in absolute seclusion from human nature and could yet feel the contented tranquillity which these lines express I allow that the situation would be more desirable than to live in a world so  pregnant with every vice and every folly But this never can be the case This inscription was merely placed here for the ornament of the grotto and the sentiments and the hermit are equally imaginary Man was born for society However little he may be attached to the world he never can wholly forget it or bear to be wholly forgotten by it Disgusted at the guilt or absurdity of mankind the misanthrope flies from it he resolves to become an hermit and buries himself in the cavern of some gloomy rock While hate inflames his bosom possibly he may feel contented with his situation but when his passions begin to cool when Time has mellowed his sorrows and healed those wounds which he bore with him to his solitude think you that Content becomes his companion Ah no Rosario No longer sustained by the violence of his passions he feels all the monotony of his way of living and his heart becomes the prey of ennui and weariness He looks round and finds himself  alone in the universe the love of society  evives in his bosom and he pants to re  urn to that world which he has abandoned Nature loses all her charms in his eyes no one is near him to point out her beauties or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety Propped upon the fragment of some rock he gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye he views without emotion the glory of the setting sun Slowly he returns to his cell at evening for no one there is anxious for his arrival he has no comfort in his solitary unfavoury meal he throws himself upon his couch of moss despondent and dissatisfied and wakes only to pass a day as joyless as monotonous as the former"  "You amaze me father Suppose that circumstances condemned you to solitude would not the duties of religion and the consciousness of a life well spent communicate to your heart that calm which"  "I should deceive myself did I fancy that they could I am convinced of the  contrary and that all my fortitude would not prevent me from yielding to melancholy and disgust After consuming the day in study if you knew my pleasure at meeting my brethren in the evening After passing many a long hour in solitude if I could express to you the joy which I feel at once more beholding a fellowcreature 'Tis in this particular that I place the principal merit of a monastic institution It secludes man from the temptations of vice it procures that leisure necessary for the proper service of the Supreme it spares him the mortification of witnessing the crimes of the worldly and yet permits him to enjoy the blessings of society And do you Rosario do you envy an hermit's life Can you be thus blind to the happiness of your situation Reflect upon it for a moment This abbey is become your asylum your regularity your gentleness your talents have rendered you the object of universal esteem you are secluded from the world which you profess to hate yet  you remain in possession of the benefits of  ociety and that a society composed of the most estimable of mankind"  "Father father 'tis that which causes  ny torment Happy had it been for me  ad my life been passed among the vicious  nd abandoned had I never heard pronounced the name of virtue 'Tis my unbounded adoration of religion 'tis my  oul's exquisite sensibility of the beauty of  air and good that loads me with shame  hat hurries me to perdition Oh that I had never seen these abbeywalls"  "How Rosario When we last conversed you spoke in a different tone Is my friendship then become of such little consequence Had you never seen these abbeywalls you never had seen me Can that really be your wish"  "Had never seen you" repeated the novice starting from the bank and grasping the friar's hand with a frantic air "You you Would to God that lightning had blasted them before you ever  met my eyes Would to God that I were never to see you more and could forget that I had ever seen you"  With these words he flew hastily from the grotto Ambrosio remained in his former attitude reflecting on the youth's unaccountable behaviour He was inclined to suspect the derangement of his senses yet the general tenor of his conduct the connexion of his ideas and calmness of his demeanour till the moment of his quitting the grotto seemed to discountenance this conjecture After a few minutes Rosario returned He again seated himself upon the bank he reclined his cheek upon one hand and with the other wiped away the tears which trickled from his eyes at intervals  The monk looked upon him with compassion and forbore to interrupt his meditations Both observed for some time a profound silence The nightingale had now taken her station upon an orangetree fronting the hermitage and poured forth  a strain the most melancholy and melodious Rosario raised his head and listened to her with attention  "It was thus" said he with a deepdrawn sigh "it was thus that during the last month of her unhappy life my sister used to sit listening to the nightingale Poor Matilda she sleeps in the grave and her broken heart throbs no more with passion"  "You had a sister"  "You say right that I  bad  Alas I have one no longer She sunk beneath the weight of her sorrows in the very spring of life"  "What were those sorrows"  "They will not excite  your  pity  You  know not the power of those irresistible those fatal sentiments to which her heart was a prey Father she loved unfortunately A passion for one endowed with every virtue for a manoh rather let me say for a divinityproved the bane of her existence His noble form his spotless character his various talents his wisdom solid  wonderful and glorious might have warmed the bosom of the most insensible My sister saw him and dared to love though she never dared to hope"  "If her love was so well bestowed what forbad her to hope the obtaining of its object"  "Father before he knew her Julian had already plighted his vows to a bride most fair most heavenly Yet still my sister loved and for the husband's sake she doted upon the wife One morning she found means to escape from our father's house arrayed in humble weeds she offered herself as a domestic to the consort of her beloved and was accepted She was now continually in his presence she strove  ingratiate herself into his favour she succeeded Her attentions attracted Julian's notice the virtuous are ever grateful and he distinguished Matilda above the rest of her companions"  "And did not your parents seek for her Did they submit tamely to their loss  nor attempt to recover their wandering daughter"  "Ere they could find her she discovered herself Her love grew too violent for concealment yet she wished not for Julian's person she ambitioned but a share of his heart In an unguarded moment she confessed her affection What was the return Doting upon his wife and believing that a look of pity bestowed upon another was a theft from what he owed to her he drove Matilda from his presence he forbad her ever again appearing before him His severity broke her heart she returned to her father's and in a few months after was carried to her grave"  "Unhappy girl Surely her fate was too severe and Julian was too cruel"  "Do you think so father" cried the novice with vivacity "Do you think that he was cruel"  "Doubtless I do and pity her most sincerely"  "You pity her you pity her Oh father father then pity me"  The friar started when after a moment's pause Rosario added with a faltering voice "for my sufferings are still greater My sister had a friend a real friend who pitied the acuteness of her feelings nor reproached her with her inability to repress them I I have no friend The whole wide world cannot furnish an heart that is willing to participate in the sorrows of mine"  As he uttered these words he sobbed audibly The friar was affected He took Rosario's hand and pressed it with tenderness  "You have no friend say you What then am I Why will you not confide in me and what can you fear My severity Have I ever used it with you The dignity of my habit Rosario I lay aside the monk and bid you consider me as no other than your friend your father Well may  I assume that title for never did parent watch over a child more fondly than I have watched over you From the moment in which I first beheld you I perceived sensations in my bosom till then unknown to me I found a delight in your society which no one's else could afford and when I witnessed the extent of your genius and information I rejoiced as does a father in the perfections of his son Then lay aside your fears speak to me with openness speak to me Rosario and say that you will confide in me If my aid or my pity can alleviate your distress"  "Yours can yours only can Ah father how willingly would I unveil to you my heart how willingly would I declare the secret which bows me down with its weight But oh I fear I fear"  "What my son"  "That you should abhor me for my weakness that the reward of my confidence should be the loss of your esteem"  "How shall I reassure you Reflect  upon the whole of my past conduct upon the paternal tenderness which I have ever shown you Abhor you Rosario It is no longer in my power To give up your society would be to deprive myself of the greatest pleasure of my life Then reveal to me what afflicts you and believe me while I solemnly swear"  "Hold" interrupted the novice "Swear that whatever be my secret you will not oblige me to quit the monastery till my noviciate shall expire"  "I promise it faithfully and as I keep my vows to you may Christ keep his to mankind Now then explain this mystery and rely upon my indulgence"  "I obey you Know thenOh how I tremble to name the word Listen to me with pity revered Ambrosio Call up every latent spark of human weakness that may teach you compassion for mine Father" continued he throwing himself at the friar's feet and pressing his hand to his lips with eagerness while agitation for a  moment choaked his voice "father" continued he in faltering accents "I am a woman"  The abbot started at this unexpected avowal Prostrate on the ground lay the feigned Rosario as if waiting in silence the decision of his judge Astonishment on the one part apprehension on the other for some minutes chained them in the same attitudes as they had been touched by the rod of some magician At length recovering from his confusion the monk quitted the grotto and sped with precipitation towards the abbey His action did not escape the suppliant She sprang from the ground she hastened to follow him overtook him threw herself in his passage and embraced his knees Ambrosio strove in vain to disengage himself from her grasp  "Do not fly me" she cried "Leave me not abandoned to the impulse of despair Listen while I excuse my imprudence while I acknowledge my sister's  story to be my own I am Matilda you are her beloved"  If Ambros  o's surprise was great at her first avowal upon hearing her second it exceeded all bounds Amazed embarrassed and irresolute he found himself incapable of pronouncing a syllable and remained in silence gazing upon Matilda This gave her opportunity to continue her explanation as follows  "Think not Ambrosio that I come to rob your bride of your affections No believe me Religion alone deserves you and far is it from Matilda's wish to draw you from the paths of virtue What I feel for you is love not licentiousness I sigh to be possessor of your heart not lust for the enjoyment of your person Deign to listen to my vindication a few moments will convince you that this holy retreat is not polluted by my presence and that you may grant me your compassion without trespassing against your vows"She seated  herself Ambrosio scarcely conscious of what he did followed her example and she proceeded in her discourse  "I spring from a distinguished family my father was chief of the noble house of Villanegas he died while I was still an infant and left me sole heiress of his immense possessions Young and wealthy I was sought in marriage by the noblest youths of Madrid but no one succeeded in gaining my affections I had been brought up under the care of an uncle possessed of the most solid judgment and extensive erudition he took pleasure in communicating to me some portion of his knowledge Under his instructions my understanding acquired more strength and justness than generally falls to the lot of my sex the ability of my preceptor being aided by natural curiosity I not only made a considerable progress in sciences universally studied but in others revealed but to few and lying under censure from the blindness of superstition But  while my guardian laboured to enlarge the sphere of my knowledge he carefully inculcated every moral precept he relieved me from the shackles of vulgar prejudice he pointed out the beauty of religion he taught me to look with adoration upon the pure and virtuous and wo is me I have obeyed him but too well  "With such dispositions judge whether I could observe with any other sentiment than disgust the vice dissipation and ignorance which disgrace our Spanish youth I rejected every offer with disdain my heart remained without a master till chance conducted me to the cathedral of the Capuchins Oh surely on that day my guardian angel slumbered neglectful of his charge Then was it that I first beheld you you supplied the superior's place absent from illness You cannot but remember the lively enthusiasm which your discourse created Oh how I drank your words how your eloquence seemed to steal me from myself I  scarcely dared to breathe fearing to lose a syllable and while you spoke methought a radiant glory beamed round your head and your countenance shone with the majesty of a god I retired from the church glowing with admiration From that moment you became the idol of my heart the neverchanging object of my meditations I enquired respecting you The reports which were made me of your mode of life of your knowledge piety and selfdenial riveted the chains imposed on me by your eloquence I was conscious that there was no longer a void in my heart that I had found the man whom I had sought till then in vain In expectation of hearing you again every day I visited your cathedral you remained secluded within the abbey walls and I always withdrew wretched and disappointed The night was more propi+tious to me for then you stood before me in my dreams you vowed to me eternal friendship you led me through the paths of virtue and assisted me to support the  vexations of life The morning dispelled these pleasing visions I awoke and found myself separated from you by barriers which appeared insurmountable Time seemed only to increase the strength of my passion I grew melancholy and despondent I fled from society and my health declined daily At length no longer able to exist in this state of torture I resolved to assume the disguise in which you see me My artifice was fortunate I was received into the monastery and succeeded in gaining your esteem  "Now then I should have felt completely happy had not my quiet been disturbed by the fear of detection The pleasure which I received from your society was embittered by the idea that perhaps I should soon be deprived of it and my heart throbbed so rapturously at obtaining the marks of your friendship as to convince me that I never should survive its loss I resolved therefore not to leave the discovery of my sex to chanceto confess the whole to  you and throw myself entirely on your mercy and indulgence Ah Ambrosio can I have been deceived Can you be less generous than I thought you I will not suspect it You will not drive a wretch to despair I shall still be permitted to see you to converse with you to adore you Your virtues shall be my example through life and when we expire our bodies shall rest in the same grave"  She ceasedWhile she spoke a thousand opposing sentiments combated in Ambrosio's bosom Surprise at the singularity of this adventure confusion at her abrupt declaration resentment at her boldness in entering the monastery and consciousness of the austerity with which it behoved him to reply such were the sentiments of which he was aware but there were others also which did not obtain his notice He perceived not that his vanity was flattered by the praises bestowed upon his eloquence and virtue that he felt a secret pleasure in reflecting that a young and seemingly lovely  woman had for his sake abandoned the world and sacrificed every other passion to that which he had inspired still less did he perceive that his heart throbbed with desire while his hand was pressed gently by Matilda's ivory fingers  By degrees he recovered from his confusion his ideas became less bewildered he was immediately sensible of the extreme impropriety should Matilda be permitted to remain in the abbey after this avowal of her sex He assumed an air of severity and drew away his hand  "How lady" said he "can you really hope for my permission to remain amongst us Even were I to grant your request what good could you derive from it Think you that I ever can reply to an affection which"  "No father no I expect not to inspire you with a love like mine I only wish for the liberty to be near you to pass some hours of the day in your society to obtain your compassion your friendship and esteem  Surely my request is not unreasonable"  "But reflect lady reflect only for a moment on the impropriety of my harbouring a woman in the abbey and that too a woman who confesses that she loves me It must not be The risk of your being discovered is too great and I will not expose myself to so dangerous a temptation"  "Temptation say you Forget that I am a woman and it no longer exists consider me only as a friend as an unfortunate whose happiness whose life depends upon your protection Fear not lest I should ever call to your remembrance that love the most impetuous the most unbounded has induced me to disguise my sex or that instigated by desires offensive to  your  vows and my own honour I should endeavour to seduce you from the path of rectitude No Ambrosio learn to know me better I love you for your virtues lose them and with them you lose my affections I look upon you as a saint prove to me that you are no  more than man and I quit you with disgust Is it then from me that you fear temptation from me in whom the world's dazzling pleasures created no other sentiment than contempt from me whose attachment is grounded on your exemption from human frailty Oh dismiss such injurious apprehensions think nobler of me think nobler of yourself I am incapable of seducing you to error and surely your virtue is established on a basis too firm to be shaken by unwarranted desires Ambrosio dearest Ambrosio drive me not from your presence remember your promise and authorise my stay"  "Impossible Matilda  your  interest commands me to refuse your prayer since I tremble for you not for myself After vanquishing the impetuous ebullitions of youth after passing thirty years in mortification and penance I might safely permit your stay nor fear your inspiring me with warmer sentiments than pity but to yourself remaining in the abbey can produce none  but fatal consequences You will misconstrue my every word and action you will seize every circumstance with avidity which encourages you to hope the return of your affection insensibly your passions will gain a superiority over your reason and far from being repressed by my presence every moment which we pass together will only serve to irritate and excite them Believe me unhappy woman you possess my sincere compassion I am convinced that you have hitherto acted upon the purest motives but though you are blind to the imprudence of your conduct in me it would be culpable not to open your eyes I feel that duty obliges my treating you with harshness I must reject your prayer and remove every shadow of hope which may aid to nourish sentiments so pernicious to your repose Matilda you must from hence tomorrow"  "To morrow Ambrosio tomorrow Oh surely you cannot mean it you cannot resolve on driving me to despair you cannot have the cruelty"  "You have heard my decision and it must be obeyed the laws of our order forbid your stay it would be perjury to conceal that a woman is within these walls and my vows will oblige me to declare your story to the community You must from hence I pity you but can do no more"  He pronounced these words in a faint and trembling voice then rising from his seat he would have hastened towards the monastery Uttering a loud shriek Matilda followed and detained him  "Stay yet one moment Ambrosio hear me yet speak one word"  "I dare not listen Release me you know my resolution"  "But one word but one last word and I have done"  "Leave me Your entreaties are in vain you must from hence tomorrow"  "Go then barbarian But this resource is still left me"  As she said this she suddenly drew a poniard She rent open her garment and  placed the weapon's point against her bosom  "Father I will never quit these walls alive"  "Hold hold Matilda what would you do"  "You are determined so am I the moment that you leave me I plunge this steel in my heart"  "Holy St Francis Matilda have you your senses Do you know the consequences of your action that suicide is the greatest of crimes that you destroy your soul that you lose your claim to salvation that you prepare for yourself everlasting torments"  "I care not I care not" she replied passionately "either your hand guides me to paradise or my own dooms me to perdition Speak to me Ambrosio Tell me that you will conceal my story that I shall remain your friend and your companion or this poniard drinks my blood"  As she uttered these last words she lifted  her arm and made a motion as if to stab herself The friar's eyes followed with dread the course of the dagger She had torn open her habit and her bosom was half exposed The weapon's point rested upon her left breast and oh that was such a breast The moonbeams darting full upon it enabled the monk to observe its dazzling whiteness his eye dwelt with insatiable avidity upon the beauteous orb a sensation till then unknown filled his heart with a mixture of anxiety and delight a raging fire shot through every limb the blood boiled in his veins and a thousand wild wishes bewildered his imagination  "Hold" he cried in an hurried faltering voice "I can resist no longer Stay then enchantress stay for my destruction"  He said and rushing from the place hastened towards the monastery he regained his cell and threw himself upon his couch distracted irresolute and confused  He found it impossible for some time to  arrange his ideas The scene in which he had been engaged had excited such a variety of sentiments in his bosom that he was incapable of deciding which was predominant He was irresolute what conduct he ought to hold with the disturber of his repose he was conscious that prudence religion and propriety necessitated his obliging her to quit the abbey but on the other hand such powerful reasons authorised her stay that he was but too much inclined to consent to her remaining He could not avoid being flattered by Matilda's declaration and at reflecting that he had unconsciously vanquished an heart which had resisted the attacks of Spain's noblest cavaliers The manner in which he had gained her affections was also the most satisfactory to his vanity he remembered the many happy hours which he had passed in Rosario's society and dreaded that void in his heart which parting with him would occasion Besides all this he considered that as Matilda  was wealthy her favour might be of essential benefit to the abbey  "And what do I risk" said he to himself "by authorizing her stay May I not safely credit her assertions Will it not be easy for me to forget her sex and still consider her as my friend and my disciple Surely her love is as pure as she describes had it been the offspring of mere licentiousness would she so long have concealed it in her own bosom Would she not have employed some means to procure its gratification She has done quite the contrary she strove to keep me in ignorance of her sex and nothing but the fear of detection and my instances would have compelled her to reveal the secret she has observed the duties of religion not less strictly than myself she has made no attempt to rouse my slumbering passions nor has she ever conversed with me till this night on the subject of love Had she been desirous to gain my affections not my esteem she would not have concealed from me her  charms so carefully at this very moment I have never seen her face yet certainly that face must be lovely and her person beautiful to judge by herby what I have seen"  As this last idea passed through his imagination a blush spread itself over his cheek Alarmed at the sentiments which he was indulging he betook himself to prayer he started from his couch knelt before the beautiful Madona and entreated her assistance in stifling such culpable emotions he then returned to his bed and resigned himself to slumber  He awoke heated and unrefreshed During his sleep his inflamed imagination had presented him with none but the most voluptuous objects Matilda stood before him in his dreams and his eyes again dwelt upon her naked breast she repeated her protestations of eternal love threw her arms round his neck and loaded him with kisses he returned them he clasped her passionately to his bosom andthe vision was dissolved Sometimes his dreams presented the image of his  favourite Madona and he fancied that he was kneeling before her as he offered up his vows to her the eyes of the figure seemed to beam on him with inexpressible sweetness he pressed his lips to hers and found them warm the animated form started from the canvas embraced him affectionately and his senses were unable to support delight so exquisite Such were the scenes on which his thoughts were employed while sleeping his unsatisfied desires placed before him the most lustful and provoking images and he rioted in joys till then unknown to him  He started from his couch filled with confusion at the remembrance of his dreams scarcely was he less ashamed when he reflected on his reasons of the former night which induced him to authorise Matilda's stay The cloud was now dissipated which had obscured his judgment he shuddered when he beheld his arguments blazoned in their proper colours and found that he had been a slave to flattery to avarice and selflove If in one hour's conversation Matilda  had produced a change so remarkable in his sentiments what had he not to dread from her remaining in the abbey Become sensible of his danger awakened from his dream of confidence he resolved to insist on her departing without delay he began to feel that he was not proof against temptation and that however Matilda might restrain herself within the bounds of modesty he was unable to contend with those passions from which he falsely thought himself exempted  "Agnes Agnes" he exclaimed while reflecting on his embarrassments "I already feel thy curse"  He quitted his cell determined upon dismissing the feigned Rosario He appeared at matins but his thoughts were absent and he paid them but little attention his heart and brain were both of them filled with worldly objects and he prayed without devotion The service over he descended into the garden he bent his steps towards the same spot where on the preceding  night he had made this embarrassing discovery he doubted not that Matilda would seek him there He was not deceived she soon entered the hermitage and approached the monk with a timid air After a few minutes during which both were silent she appeared as if on the point of speaking but the abbot who during this time had been summoning up all his resolution hastily interrupted her Though still unconscious how extensive was its influence he dreaded the melodious seduction of her voice  "Seat yourself by my side Matilda" said he assuming a look of firmness though carefully avoiding the least mixture of severity "listen to me patiently and believe that in what I shall say I am not more influenced by my own interest than by yours believe that I feel for you the warmest friendship the truest compassion and that you cannot feel more grieved than I do when I declare to you that we must never meet again"  "Ambrosio" she cried in a voice at  once expressive both of surprise and of sorrow  "Be calm my friend my Rosario still let me call you by that name so dear to me our separation is unavoidable I blush to own how sensibly it affects meBut yet it must be so I feel myself incapable of treating you with indifference and that very conviction obliges me to insist upon your departure Matilda you must stay here no longer"  "Oh where shall I now seek for probity Disgusted with a perfidious world in what happy region does Truth conceal herself Father I hoped that she resided here I thought that your bosom had been her favourite shrine And you too prove false Oh God and you too can betray me"  "Matilda"  "Yes father yes 'tis with justice that I reproach you Oh where are your promises My noviciate is not expired and yet will you compel me to quit the monastery Can you have the heart to drive me  from you and have I not received your solemn oath to the contrary"  "I will not compel you to quit the monastery you have received my solemn oath to the contrary but yet when I throw myself upon your generosity when I declare to you the embarrassments in which your presence involves me will you not release me from that oath Reflect upon the danger of a discovery upon the opprobrium in which such an event would plunge me reflect that my honour and reputation are at stake and that my peace of mind depends on your compliance As yet my heart is free I shall separate from you with regret but not with despair Stay here and a few weeks will sacrifice my happiness on the altar of your charms you are but too interesting too amiable I should love you I should doat on you my bosom would become the prey of desires which honour and my profession forbid me to gratify If I resisted them the impetuosity of my wishes unsatisfied would drive me to madness if I  yielded to the temptation I should sacrifice to one moment of guilty pleasure my reputation in this world my salvation in the next To you then I sly for defence against myself Preserve me from losing the reward of thirty years of sufferings preserve me from becoming the victim of remorse  Your  heart has already felt the anguish of hopeless love oh then if you really value me spare mine that anguish give me back my promise fly from these walls Go and you bear with you my warmest prayers for your happiness my friendship my esteem and admiration stay and you become to me the source of danger of sufferings of despair Answer me Matilda what is your resolve" She was silent "Will you not speak Matilda Will you not name your choice"  "Cruel cruel" she exclaimed wringing her hands in agony "you know too well that you offer me no choice you know too well that I can have no will but yours"  "I was not then deceived Matilda's generosity equals my expectations"  "Yes I will prove the truth of my affection by submitting to a decree which cuts me to the very heart Take back your promise I will quit the monastery this very day I have a relation abbess of a convent in Estramadura to her will I bend my steps and shut myself from the world for ever Yet tell me father shall I bear your good wishes with me to my solitude Will you sometimes abstract your attention from heavenly objects to bestow a thought upon me"  "Ah Matilda I fear that I shall think on you but too often for my repose"  "Then I have nothing more to wish for save that we may meet in heaven Farewell my friend my Ambrosio And yet methinks I would fain bear with me some token of your regard"  "What shall I give you"  "Somethingany thingone of those flowers will be sufficient" Here she pointed to a bush of roses planted at the door of the grotto "I will hide it in my bosom  and when I am dead the nuns shall find it withered upon my heart"  The friar was unable to reply with slow steps and a soul heavy with affliction he quitted the hermitage He approached the bush and stooped to pluck one of the roses Suddenly he uttered a piercing cry started back hastily and let the flower which he already held fall from his hand Matilda heard the shriek and flew anxiously towards him  "What is the matter" she cried "Answer me for God's sake What has happened"  "I have received my death" he replied in a faint voice "concealed among the rosesa serpent"  Here the pain of his wound became so exquisite that nature was unable to bear it his senses abandoned him and he sunk inanimate into Matilda's arms  Her distress was beyond the power of description She rent her hair beat her bosom and not daring to quit Ambrosio  endeavoured by loud cries to summon the monks to her assistance She at length succeeded Alarmed by her shrieks several of the brothers hastened to the spot and the superior was conveyed back to the abbey He was immediately put to bed and the monk who officiated as surgeon to the fraternity prepared to examine the wound By this time Ambrosio's hand had swelled to an extraordinary size the remedies which had been administered to him 'tis true restored him to life but not to his senses he raved in all the horrors of delirium foamed at the mouth and four of the strongest monks were scarcely able to hold him in his bed  Father Pablos such was the surgeon's name hastened to examine the wounded hand The monks surrounded the bed anxiously waiting for the decision among these the feigned Rosario appeared not the most insensible to the friar's calamity he gazed upon the sufferer with inexpressible anguish and his groans which every moment  escaped from his bosom sufficiently betrayed the violence of his affliction  Father Pablos probed the wound As he drew out his lancet its point was tinged with a greenish hue He shook his head mournfully and quitted the bed side  "'Tis as I feared" said he "there is no hope"  "No hope" exclaimed the monks with one voice "say you no hope"  "From the sudden effects I suspected that the abbot was stung by a cientipedoro  The cientipedoro is supposed to be a native of Cuba and to have been brought into Spain from that stand in the vessel of Columbus  the venom which you see upon my lancet confirms my idea He cannot live three days"  "And can no possible remedy be found" enquired Rosario  "Without extracting the poison he cannot recover and how to extract it is to me still a secret All that I can do is to apply such herbs to the wound as will relieve  the anguish the patient will be restored to his senses but the venom will corrupt the whole mass of his blood and in three days he will exist no longer"  Excessive was the universal grief at hearing this decision Pablos as he had promised dressed the wound and then retired followed by his companions Rosario alone remained in the cell the abbot at his urgent entreaty having been committed to his care Ambrosio's strength worn out by the violence of his exertions he had by this time fallen into a profound sleep So totally was he overcome by weariness that he scarcely gave any signs of life He was still in this situation when the monks returned to enquire whether any change had taken place Pablos loosened the bondage which concealed the wound more from a principle of curiosity than from indulging the hope of discovering any favourable symptoms What was his astonishment at finding that the inflammation had totally subsided He probed the hand his lancet  came out pure and unsullied no traces of the venom were perceptible and had not the orifice still been visible Pablos might have doubted that there had ever been a wound  He communicated this intelligence to his brethren their delight was only equalled by their surprise From the latter sentiment however they were soon released by explaining the circumstance according to their own ideas They were perfectly convinced that their superior was a saint and thought that nothing could be more natural than for St Francis to have operated a miracle in his favour This opinion was adopted unanimously They declared it so loudly and vociferated "A miracle a miracle" with such fervour that they soon interrupted Ambrosio's slumbers  The monks immediately crowded round his bed and expressed their satisfaction at his wonderful recovery He was perfectly in his senses and free from every complaint except feeling weak and languid  Pablos gave him a strengthening medicine and advised his keeping his bed for the two succeeding days he then retired having desired his patient not to exhaust himself by conversation but rather to endeavour at taking some repose The other monks followed his example and the abbot and Rosario were left without observers  For some minutes Ambrosio regarded his attendant with a look of mingled pleasure and apprehension She was seated upon the side of the bed her head bending down and as usual enveloped in the cowl of her habit  "And you are still here Matilda" said the friar at length "are you not satisfied with having so nearly effected my destruction that nothing but a miracle could have saved me from the grave Ah surely heaven sent that serpent to punish"  Matilda interrupted him by putting her hand before his lips with an air of gaiety  "Hush father hush you must not talk"  "He who imposed that order knew not how interesting are the subjects on which I wish to speak"  "But I know it and yet issue the same positive command I am appointed your nurse and you must not disobey my orders"  "You are in spirits Matilda"  "Well may I be so I have just received a pleasure unexampled through my whole life"  "What was that pleasure"  "What I must conceal from all but most from you"  "But most from me Nay then I entreat you Matilda"  "Hush father hush you must not talk But as you do not seem inclined to sleep shall I endeavour to amuse you with my harp"  "How I knew not that you understood music"  "Oh I am a sorry performer Yet as silence is prescribed you for eightandforty  hours I may possibly entertain you when wearied of your own reflections I go to fetch my harp"  She soon returned with it  "Now father what shall I sing Will you hear the ballad which treats of the gallant Durandarte who died in the famous battle of Roncevalles"  "What you please Matilda"  "Oh call me not Matilda Call me Rosario call me your friend Those are the names which I love to hear from your lips Now listen"  She then tuned her harp and afterwards preluded for some moments with such exquisite taste as to prove her a perfect mistress of the instrument The air which she played was soft and plaintive Ambrosio while he listened felt his uneasiness subside and a pleasing melancholy spread itself into his bosom Suddenly Matilda changed the strain with an hand bold and rapid she struck a few loud martial chords and then  chanted the following ballad to an air at once simple and melodious  DURANDARTE AND BELERMA  SAD and fearful is the story  Of the Roncevalles fight  On those fatal plains of glory  Perished many a gallant knight  There fell Durandarte never  Verse a nobler chieftain named  He before his lips for ever  Clos'd in silence thus exclaimed  "Oh Belerma Oh my dear one  For my pain and pleasure born  Seven long years I serv'd thee fair one  Seven long years my fee was scorn  "And when now thy heart replying  To my wishes burns like mine  Cruel fate my bliss denying  Bids me every hope resign  "Ah though young I fall believe me  Death would never claim a sigh  'Tis to lose thee 'tis to leave thee  Makes me think it hard to die  "Oh my cousin Montesinos  By that friendship firm and dear  Which from youth has lived between us  Now my last petition hear  "When my soul these limbs forsaking  Eager seeks a purer air  From my breast the cold heart taking  Give it to Belerma's care  "Say I of my lands possessor  Named her with my dying breath  Say my lips I op'd to bless her  Ere they clos'd for aye in death  "Twice a week too how sincerely  I ador'd her cousin say  Twice a week for one who dearly  Lov'd her cousin bid her pray  "Montesinos now the hour  Mark'd by fate is near at hand  Lo my arm has lost its power  Lo I drop my trusty brand  "Eyes which forth beheld me going  Homewards ne'er shall see me hie  Cousin stop those tears o'erflowing  Let me on thy bosom die  "Thy kind hand my eyelids closing  Yet one favour I implore  Pray thou for my soul's reposing  When my heart shall throb no more  "So shall Jesus still attending  Gracious to a Christian's vow  Pleas'd accept my ghost ascending  And a seat in heaven allow"  Thus spoke gallant Durandarte  Soon his brave heart broke in twain  Greatly joy'd the Moorish party  That the gallant knight was slain  Bitter weeping Montesinos  Took from him his helm and glaive  Bitter weeping Montesinos  Dug his gallant cousin's grave  To perform his promise made he  Cut the heart from out the breast  That Belerma wretched lady  Might receive the last bequest  Sad was Montesinos' heart he  Felt distress his bosom rend  "Oh my cousin Durandarte  Woe is me to view thy end  "Sweet in manners fair in favour  Mild in temper fierce in fight  Warrior nobler gentler braver  Never shall behold the light  "Cousin lo my teare bedew thee  How shall I thy loss survive  Durandarte he who slew thee  Wherefore left he me alive"  While she sung Ambrosio listened with delight never had he heard a voice more harmonious and he wondered how such  heavenly sounds could be produced by any but angels But though he indulged the sense of hearing a single look convinced him that he must not trust to that of sight The songstress sat at a little distance from his bed The attitude in which she bent over her harp was easy and graceful her cowl had fallen backwarder than usual two coral lips were visible ripe fresh and melting and a chin in whose dimples seemed to lurk a thousand Cupids Her habit's long sleeve would have swept along the chords of the instrument to prevent this inconvenience she had drawn it above her elbow and by this means an arm was discovered formed in the most perfect symmetry the delicacy of whose skin might have contended with snow in whiteness Ambrosio dared to look on her but once that glance sufficed to convince him how dangerous was the presence of this seducing object He closed his eyes but strove in vain to banish her from his thoughts There she still moved before him adorned  with all those charms which his heated imagination could supply Every beauty which he had seen appeared embellished and those still concealed fancy represented to him in glowing colours Still however his vows and the necessity of keeping to them were present to his memory He struggled with desire and shuddered when he beheld how deep was the precipice before him  Matilda ceased to sing Dreading the influence of her charms Ambrosio remained with his eyes closed and offered up his prayers to St Francis to assist him in this dangerous trial Matilda believed that he was sleeping she rose from her seat approached the bed softly and for some minutes gazed upon him attentively  "He sleeps" said she at length in a low voice but whose accents the abbot distinguished perfectly "now then I may gaze upon him without offence I may mix my breath with his I may doat upon his features and he cannot suspect me of impurity and deceit He fears my seducing him to  the violation of his vows Oh the unjust Were it my wish to excite desire should I conceal my features from him so carefully those features of which I daily hear him"  She stopped and was lost in her reflections  "It was but yesterday" she continued "but a few short hours have passed since I was dear to him he esteemed me and my heart was satisfied now oh now how cruelly is my situation changed He looks on me with suspicion he bids me leave him leave him for ever Oh you my saint my idol You holding the next place to God in my breast yet two days and my heart will be unveiled to you Could you know my feelings when I beheld your agony Could you know how much your sufferings have endeared you to me But the time will come when you will be convinced that my passion is pure and disinterested Then you will pity me and feel the whole weight of these sorrows"  As she said this her voice was choaked by  weeping While she bent over Ambrosio a tear fell upon his cheek  "Ah I have disturbed him" cried Matilda and retreated hastily  Her alarm was ungrounded None sleep so profoundly as those who are determined not to wake The friar was in this predicament he still seemed buried in a repose which every succeeding minute rendered him less capable of enjoying The burning tear had communicated its warmth to his heart  "What affection what purity" said he internally "Ah since my bosom is thus sensible of pity what would it be if agitated by love"  Matilda again quitted her seat and retired to some distance from the bed Ambrosio ventured to open his eyes and to cast them upon her fearfully Her face was turned from him She rested her head in a melancholy posture upon her harp and gazed on the picture which hung opposite to the bed  "Happy happy image" Thus did she address the beautiful Madona "'tis to you that he offers his prayers 'tis on you that he gazes with admiration I thought you would have lightened my sorrows you have only served to increase their weight you have made me feel that had I known him ere his vows were pronounced Ambrosio and happiness might have been mine With what pleasure he views this picture With what fervour he addresses his prayers to the insensible image Ah may not his sentiments be inspired by some kind and secret genius friend to my affection May it not be man's natural instinct which informs him Be silent idle hopes let me not encourage an idea which takes from the brilliance of Ambrosio's virtue 'Tis religion not beauty which attracts his admiration 'tis not to the woman but the divinity that he kneels Would he but address to me the least tender expression which he pours forth to this Madona Would he but say that were he not already  affianced to the church he would not have despised Matilda Oh let me nourish that fond idea Perhaps he may yet acknowledge that he feels for me more than pity and that affection like mine might well have deserved a return Perhaps he may own thus much when I lie on my deathbed He then need not fear to infringe his vows and the confession of his regard will soften the p  gs of dying Would I were sure of this Oh how earnestly should I sigh for the moment of dissolution"  Of this discourse the abbot lost not a syllable and the tone in which she pronounced these last words pierced to his heart Involuntarily he raised himself from his pillow  "Matilda" he said in a troubled voice "Oh my Matilda"  She started at the sound and turned towards him hastily The suddenness of her movement made her cowl fall back from her head her features became visible to the monk's enquiring eye What was his  amazement at beholding the exact resemblance of his admired Madona The same exquisite proportion of features the same profusion of golden hair the same rosy lips heavenly eyes and majesty of countenance adorned Matilda Uttering an exclamation of surprise Ambrosio sunk back upon his pillow and doubted whether the object before him was mortal or divine  Matilda seemed penetrated with confusion She remained motionless in her place and supported herself upon her instrument Her eyes were bent upon the earth and her fair cheeks overspread with blushes On recovering herself her first action was to conceal her features She then in an unsteady and troubled voice ventured to address these words to the friar  "Accident has made you master of a secret which I never would have revealed but on the bed of death yes Ambrosio in Matilda de Villanegas you see the original of your beloved Madona Soon after I conceived my unfortunate passion I formed  the project of conveying to you my picture Crowds of admirers had persuaded me that I possessed some beauty and I was anxious to know what effect it would produce upon you I caused my portrait to be drawn by Martin Galuppi a celebrated Venetian at that time resident in Madrid The resemblance was striking I sent it to the Capuchinabbey as if for sale and the Jew from whom you bought it was one of my emissaries You purchased it Judge of my rapture when informed that you had gazed upon it with delight or rather with adoration that you had suspended it in your cell and that you addressed your supplications to no other saint Will this discovery make me still more regarded as an object of suspicion Rather should it convince you how pure is my affection and engage you to suffer me in your society and esteem I heard you daily extol the praises of my portrait I was an eye witness of the transports which its beauty excited in you yet I forbore to use against your virtue those  arms with which yourself had furnished me I concealed those features from your sight which you loved unconsciously I strove no  to excite desire by displaying my charms or to make myself mistress of your hear  through the medium of your senses To attract your notice by studiously attending to religious duties to endear myself to you by convincing you that my mind was virtuous and my attachment sincere such was my only aim I succeeded I became your companion and your friend I concealed my sex from your knowledge and had you not pressed me to reveal my secret had I not been tormented by the fear of a discovery never had you known me for any other than Rosario And still are you resolved to drive me from you The few hours of life which yet remain for me may I not pass them in your presence Oh speak Ambrosio and tell me that I may stay"  This speech gave the abbot an opportunity of recollecting himself He was  conscious that in the present disposition of his mind avoiding her society was his only refuge from the power of this enchanting woman  "Your declaration has so much astonished me" said he "that I am at present incapable of answering you Do not insist upon a reply Matilda leave me to myself I have need to be alone"  "I obey you but before I go promise not to Insist upon my quitting the abbey immediately"  "Matilda reflect upon your situation reflect upon the consequences of your stay our separation is indispensable and we must part"  "But not to day father Oh in pity not today"  "You press me too hard but I cannot resist that tone of supplication Since you insist upon it I yield to your prayer I consent to your remaining here a sufficient time to prepare in some measure the brethren for your departure stay yet two days  but on the third"He sighed involuntarily"remember that on the third we must part for ever"  She caught his hand eagerly and pressed it to her lips  "On the third" she exclaimed with an air of wild solemnity "You are right father you are right On the third we must part for ever"  There was a dreadful expression in her eye as she uttered these words which penetrated the friar's soul with horror Again she kissed his hand and then fled with rapidity from the chamber  Anxious to authorise the presence of his dangerous guest yet conscious that her stay was infringing the laws of his order Ambrosio's bosom became the theatre of a thousand contending passions At length his attachment to the feigned Rosario aided by the natural warmth of his temperament seemedlikely to obtain the victory the success was assured when that presumption which formed the groundwork of his character  came to Matilda's assistance The monk reflected that to vanquish temptation was an infinitely greater merit than to avoid it he thought that he ought rather to rejoice in the opportunity given him of proving the firmness of his virtue St Anthony had withstood all seductions to lust then why should not he Besides St Anthony was tempted by the devil who put every art into practice to excite his passions whereas Ambrosio's danger proceeded from a mere mortal woman fearful and modest whose apprehensions of his yielding were not less violent than his own  "Yes" said he "the unfortunate shall stay I have nothing to fear from her presence even should my own prove too weak to resist the temptation I am secured from danger by the innocence of Matilda"  Ambrosio was yet to learn that to an heart unacquainted with her vice is ever most dangerous when lurking behind the mask of virtue  He found himself so perfectly recovered  that when father Pablos visited him again at night he entreated permission to quit his chamber on the day following His request was granted Matilda appeared no more that evening except in company with the monks when they came in a body to enquire after the abbot's health She seemed fearful of conversing with him in private and stayed but a few minutes in his room The friar slept well but the dreams of the former night were repeated and his sensations of voluptuousness were yet more keen and exquisite the same lustexciting visions floated before his eyes Matilda in all the pomp of beauty warm tender and luxurious clasped him to her bosom and lavished upon him the most ardent caresses He returned them as eagerly and already was on the point of satisfying his desires when the faithless form disappeared and left him to all the horrors of shame and disappointment  The morning dawned Fatigued harassed and exhausted by his provoking  dreams he was not disposed to quit his bed he excused himself from appearing at matins it was the first morning in his life that he had ever missed them He rose late during the whole of the day he had no opportunity of speaking to Matilda without witnesses his cell was thronged by the monks anxious to express their concern at his illness and he was still occupied in receiving their compliments on his recovery when the bell summoned them to the refectory  After dinner the monks separated and dispersed themselves in various parts of the garden where the shade of trees or retirement of some grotto presented the most agreeable means of enjoying the fiesta The abbot bent his steps towards the hermitage a glance of his eye invited Matilda to accompany him she obeyed and followed him thither in silence they entered the grotto and seated themselves both seemed unwilling to begin the conversation and to labour under the influence of mutual embarrassment  At length the abbot spoke he conversed only on indifferent topics and Matilda answered him in the same tone she seemed anxious to make him forget that the person who sat by him was any other than Rosario Neither of them dared or indeed wished to make an allusion to the subject which was most at the hearts of both  Matilda's efforts to appear gay were evidently forced her spirits were oppressed by the weight of anxiety and when she spoke her voice was low and feeble she seemed desirous of finishing a conversation which embarrassed her and complaining that she was unwell she requested Ambrosio's permission to return to the abbey He accompanied her to the door of her cell and when arrived there he stopped her to declare his consent to her continuing the partner of his solitude so long as should be agreeable to herself  She discovered no marks of pleasure at receiving this intelligence though on the  preceding day she had been so anxious to obtain the permission  "Alas father" she said waving her head mournfully "your kindness comes too late my doom is fixed we must separate for ever yet believe that I am grateful for your generosity for your compassion of an unfortunate who is but too little deserving of it"  She put her handkerchief to her eyes her cowl was only half drawn over her face Ambrosio observed that she was pale and her eyes sunk and heavy  "Good God" he cried "you are very ill Matilda I shall send father Pablos to you instantly"  "No do not I am ill 'tis true but he cannot cure my malady Farewell father Remember me in your prayers tomorrow while I shall remember you in heaven"  She entered her cell and closed the door  The abbot dispatched to her the physician without losing a moment and waited his report impatiently but father Pablos  soon returned and declared that his errand had been fruitless Rosario refused to admit him and had positively rejected his offers of assistance The uneasiness which this account gave Ambrosio was not trifling yet he determined that Matilda should have her own way for that night but that if her situation did not mend by the morning he would insist upon her taking the advice of father Pablos  He did not find himself inclined to sleep he opened his casement and gazed upon the moonbeams as they played upon the small stream whose waters bathed the walls of the monastery The coolness of the night breeze and tranquillity of the hour inspired the friar's mind with sadness he thought upon Matilda's beauty and affection upon the pleasures which he might have shared with her had he not been restrained by monastic setters He reflected that unsustained by hope her love for him could not long exist that doubtless she would succeed in extinguishing her passion and seek for happiness  in the arms of one more fortunate He shuddered at the void which her absence would leave in his bosom he looked with disgust on the monotony of a convent and breathed a sigh towards that world from which he was for ever separated Such were the reflections which a loud knocking at his door interrupted The bell of the church had already struck two The abbot hastened to enquire the cause of this disturbance He opened the door of his cell and a laybrother entered whose looks declared his hurry and confusion  "Hasten reverend father" said he "hasten to the young Rosario he earnestly requests to see you he lies at the point of death"  "Gracious God where is father Pablos Why is he not with him Oh I fear I fear"  "Father Pablos has seen him but his art can do nothing He says that he suspects the youth to be poisoned"  "Poisoned Oh the unfortunate It is  then as I suspected But let me not lose a moment perhaps it may yet be time to save her"  He said and flew towards the cell of the novice Several monks were already in the chamber father Pablos was one of them and held a medicine in his hand which he was endeavouring to persuade Rosario to swallow The others were employed in admiring the patient's divine countenance which they now saw for the first time She looked lovelier than ever she was no longer pale or languid a bright glow had spread itself over her cheeks her eyes sparkled with a serene delight and her countenance was expressive of confidence and resignation  "Oh torment me no more" was she saying to Pablos when the terrified abbot rushed hastily into the cell "my disease is far beyond the reach of your skill and I wish not to be cured of it" Then perceiving Ambrosio"Ah 'tis he" she cried "I see him once again before we part for  ever Leave me my brethren much have I to tell this holy man in private"  The monks retired immediately and Matilda and the abbot remained together  "What have you done imprudent woman" exclaimed the latter as soon as they were left alone "tell me are my suspicions just Am I indeed to lose you Has your own hand been the instrument of your destruction"  She smiled and grasped his hand  "In what have I been imprudent father I have sacrificed a pebble and saved a diamond My death preserves a life valuable to the world and more dear to me than my ownYes father I am poisoned but know that the poison once circulated in your veins"  "Matilda"  "What I tell you I resolved never to discover to you but on the bed of death that moment is now arrived You cannot have forgotten the day already when your life was endangered by the bite of a cientipedoro  The physician gave you over declaring himself ignorant how to extract the venom I knew but of one means and hesitated not a moment to employ it I was left alone with you you slept I loosened the bandage from your hand I kissed the wound and drew out the poison with my lips The effect has been more sudden than I expected I feel death at my heart yet an hour and I shall be in a better world"  "Almighty God" exclaimed the abbot and sunk almost lifeless upon the bed  After a few minutes he again raised himself up suddenly and gazed upon Matilda with all the wildness of despair  "And you have sacrificed yourself for me You die and die to preserve Ambrosio And is there indeed no remedy Matilda And is there indeed no hope Speak to me oh speak to me Tell me that you have still the means of life"  "Be comforted my only friend Yes I have still the means of life in my power but it is a means which I dare not employ  it is dangerous it is dreadful Life would be purchased at too dear a rateunless it were permitted me to live for you"  "Then live for me Matilda for me and gratitude"He caught her hand and pressed it rapturously to his lips"Remember our late conversations I now consent to every thing Remember in what lively colours you described the union of souls be it ours to realize those ideas Let us forget the distinctions of sex despise the world's prejudices and only consider each other as brother and friend Live then Matilda oh live for me"  "Ambrosio it must not be When I thought thus I deceived both you and myself either I must die at present or expire by the lingering torments of unsatisfied desire Oh since we last conversed together a dreadful veil has been rent from before my eyes I love you no longer with the devotion which is paid to a saint I prize you no more for the virtues of your soul I lust for the enjoyment of your person The woman  reigns in my bosom and I am become a prey to the wildest of passions Away with friendship 'tis a cold unfeeling word my bosom burns with love with unutterable love and love must be its return Tremble then Ambrosio tremble to succeed in your prayers If I live your truth your reputation your reward of a life past in sufferings all that you value is irretrievably lost I shall no longer be able to combat my passions shall seize every opportunity to excite your desires and labour to effect your dishonour and my own No no Ambrosio I must not live I am convinced with every moment that I have but one alternative I feel with every heart throb that I must enjoy you or die"  "Amazement Matilda Can it be you who speak to me"  He made a movement as if to quit his feat She uttered a loud shriek and raising herself half out of the bed threw her arms round the friar to detain him  "Oh do not leave me Listen to my  errors with compassion in a few hours I shall be no more yet a little and I am free from this disgraceful passion"  "Wretched woman what can I say to you I cannotI must notBut live Matilda oh live"  "You do not reflect on what you ask What live to plunge myself in infamy to become the agent of hell to work the destruction both of you and of myself Feel this heart father"  She took his hand Confused embarrassed and fascinated he withdrew it not and felt her heart throb under it  "Feel this heart father It is yet the seat of honour truth and chastity if it beats tomorrow it must fall a prey to the blackest crimes Oh let me then die today Let me die while I yet deserve the tears of the virtuous Thus will I expire"She reclined her head upon his shoulder her golden hair poured itself over his chest "Folded in your arms I shall sink to sleep your hand shall close my eyes for ever and  your lips receive my dying breath And will you not sometimes think of me Will you not sometimes shed a tear upon my tomb Oh yes yes yes that kiss is my assurance"  The hour was night All was silence around The faint beams of a solitary lamp darted upon Matilda's figure and shed through the chamber a dim mysterious light No prying eye or curious ear was near the lovers nothing was heard but Matilda's melodious accents Ambrosio was in the full vigour of manhood he saw before him a young and beautiful woman the preserver of his life the adorer of his person and whom affection for him had reduced to the brink of the grave He sat upon her bed his hand rested upon her bosom her head reclined voluptuously upon his breast Who then can wonder if he yielded to the temptation Drunk with desire he pressed his lips to those which sought them his kisses vied with Matilda's in warmth and passion he clasped her rapturously  in his arms he forgot his vows his sanctity and his fame he remembered nothing but the pleasure and opportunity  "Ambrosio Oh my Ambrosio" sighed Matilda  "Thine ever thine" murmured the friar and sunk upon her bosom  CHAP III  These are the villains  Whom all the travellers do fear so much  Some of them are gentlemen  Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth  Thrust from the company of awful men  TWO GENTLEMAN OF VERONA  THE marquis and Lorenzo proceeded to the hotel in silence The former employed himself in calling every circumstance to his mind which related might give Lorenzo's the most favourable idea of his connexion with Agnes The latter justly alarmed for the honour of his family felt embarrassed by the presence of the marquis the adventure which he had just witnessed forbad his treating him as a friend and Antonia's interests being entrusted to his mediation he saw the impolicy of treating him as a foe He concluded from these  reflections that profound silence would be the wisest plan and waited with impatience for Don Raymond's explanation  They arrived at the hotel de las Cisternas The marquis immediately conducted him to his apartment and began to express his satisfaction at finding him at Madrid Lorenzo interrupted him  "Excuse me my lord" said he with a distant air "if I reply somewhat coldly to your expressions of regard A sister's honour is involved in this affair till that is established and the purport of your correspondence with Agnes cleared up I cannot consider you as my friend I am anxious to hear the meaning of your conduct and hope that you will not delay the promised explanation"  "First give me your word that you will listen with patience and indulgence"  "I love my sister too well to judge her harshly and till this moment I possessed no friend so dear to me as yourself I will also confess that your having it in your power  to oblige me in a business which I have much at heart makes me very anxious to find you still deserving my esteem"  "Lorenzo you transport me No greater pleasure can be given me than an opportunity of serving the brother of Agnes"  "Convince me that I can accept your favours without dishonour and there is no man in the world to whom I am more willing to be obliged"  "Probably you have already heard your sister mention the name of Alphonso d'Alvarada"  "Never Though I feel for Agnes an affection truly fraternal circumstances have prevented us from being much together While yet a child she was consigned to the care of her aunt who had married a German nobleman At his castle she remained till two years since when she returned to Spain determined upon secluding herself from the world"  "Good God Lorenzo you knew of her  intention and yet strove not to make her change it"  "Marquis you wrong me the intelligence which I received at Naples shocked me extremely and I hastened my return to Madrid for the express purpose of preventing the sacrifice The moment that I arrived I flew to the convent of St Clare in which Agnes had chosen to perform her noviciate I requested to see my sister Conceive my surprise when she sent me a refusal she declared positively that apprehending my influence over her mind she would not trust herself in my society 'till the day before that on which she was to receive the veil I supplicated the nuns I insisted upon seeing Agnes and hesitated not to avow my suspicions that her being kept from me was against her own inclinations To free herself from the imputation of violence the prioress brought me a few lines written in my sister's wellknown hand repeating the message already delivered All future attempts to obtain a moment's  conversation with her were as fruitless as the first She was inflexible and I was not permitted to see her till the day preceding that on which she entered the cloister never to quit it more This interview took place in the presence of our principal relations It was for the first time since her childhood that I saw her and the scene was most affecting she threw herself upon my bosom kissed me and wept bitterly By every possible argument by tears by prayers by kneeling I strove to make her abandon her intention I represented to her all the hardships of a religious life I painted to her imagination all the pleasures which she was going to quit and besought her to disclose to me what occasioned her disgust to the world At this last question she turned pale and her tears flowed yet faster She entreated me not to press her on that subject that it sufficed me to know that her resolution was taken and that a convent was the only place where she could now hope for tranquillity She persevered in  her design and made her profession I visited her frequently at the grate and every moment that I passed with her made me feel more affliction at her loss I was shortly after obliged to quit Madrid I returned but yesterday evening and since then have not had time to call at St Clare's convent"  "Then till I mentioned it you never heard the name of Alphonso d'Alvarada"  "Pardon me my aunt wrote me word that an adventurer so called had found means to get introduced into the castle of Lindenberg that he had insinuated himself into my sister's good graces and that she had even consented to elope with him However before the plan could be executed the cavalier discovered that the estates which he believed Agnes to possess in Hispaniola in reality belonged to me This intelligence made him change his intention he disappeared on the day that the elopement was to have taken place and Agnes in despair at his perfidy and meanness had resolved upon seclusion in a convent She  added that as this adventurer had given himself out to be a friend of mine she wished to know whether I had any knowledge of him I replied in the negative I had then very little idea that Alphonso d'Alvarada and the marquis de las Cisternas were one and the same person the description given me of the first by no means tallied with what I knew of the latter"  "In this I easily recognize Donna Rodopha's perfidious character Every word of this account is stamped with marks of her malice of her falsehood of her talents for misrepresenting those whom she wishes to injure Forgive me Medina for speaking so freely of your relation The mischief which she has done me authorises my resentment and when you have heard my story you will be convinced that my expressions have not been too severe"  He then began his narrative in the following manner  HISTORY OF DON RAYMOND MARQUIS DE LAS CISTERNAS  LONG experience my dear Lorenzo has convinced me how generous is your nature I waited not for your declaration of ignorance respecting your sister's adventures to suppose that they had been purposely concealed from you Had they reached your knowledge from what misfortunes should both Agnes and myself have escaped Fate had ordained it otherwise You were on your travels when I first became acquainted with your sister and as our enemies took care to conceal from her your direction it was impossible for her to implore by letter your protection and advice  On leaving Salamanca at which university as I have since heard you remained a year after I quitted it I immediately set  out upon my travels My father supplied me liberally with money but he insisted upon my concealing my rank and presenting myself as no more than a private gentleman This command was issued by the counsels of his friend the duke of Villa Hermosa a nobleman for whose abilities and knowledge of the world I have ever entertained the most profound veneration  "Believe me" said he "my dear Raymond you will hereafter feel the benefits of this temporary degradation 'Tis true that as the condé de las Cisternas you would have been received with open arms and your youthful vanity might have felt gratified by the attentions showered upon you from all sides At present much will depend upon yourself you have excellent recommendations but it must be your own business to make them of use to you you must lay yourself out to please you must labour to gain the approbation of those to whom you are presented they who would  have courted the friendship of the condé de las Cisternas will have no interest in finding out the merits or bearing patiently with the faults of Alphonso d'Alvarada consequently when you find yourself really liked you may safely ascribe it to your good qualities not your rank and the distinction shewn you will be infinitely more flattering Besides your exalted birth would not permit your mixing with the lower classes of society which will now be in your power and from which in my opinion you will derive considerable benefit Do not confine yourself to the illustrious of those countries through which you pass Examine the manners and customs of the multitude enter into the cottages and by observing how the vassals of foreigners are treated learn to diminish the burthens and augment the comforts of your own According to my ideas of those advantages which a youth destined to the possession of power and wealth may reap from travel he should not consider as the least essential  the opportunity of mixing with the classes below him and becoming an eyewitness of the sufferings of the people"  Forgive me Lorenzo if I seem tedious in my narration the close connexion which now exists between us makes me anxious that you should know every particular respecting me and in my fear of omitting the least circumstance which may induce you to think favourably of your sister and myself I may possibly relate many which you may think uninteresting  I followed the duke's advice I was soon convinced of its wisdom I quitted Spain calling myself by the assumed title of Don Alphonso d'Alvarada and attended by a single domestic of approved fidelity Paris was my first station For some time I was enchanted with it as indeed must be every man who is young rich and fond of pleasure Yet among all its gaieties I felt that something was wanting to my heart I grew sick of dissipation I discovered that the people among whom I lived and whose  exterior was so polished and seducing were at bottom frivolous unfeeling and insincere I turned from the inhabitants of Paris with disgust and quitted that theatre of luxury without heaving one sigh of regret  I now bent my course towards Germany intending to visit most of the principal courts Prior to this expedition I meant to make some little stay at Strasbourg On quitting my chaise at Luneville to take some refreshment I observed a splendid equipage attended by four domestics in rich liveries waiting at the door of the Silver Lion Soon after as I looked out of the window I saw a lady of noble presence followed by two female attendants step into the carriage which drove off immediately  I enquired of the host who the lady was that had just departed  "A German baroness monsieur of great rank and fortune she has been upon a visit to the duchess of Longueville as her servants informed me She is going to Strasbourg where she will find her husband and  then both return to their castle in Germany"  I resumed my journey intending to reach Strasbourg that night My hopes however were frustrated by the breaking down of my chaise the accident happened in the middle of a thick forest and I was not a little embarrassed as to the means of proceeding It was the depth of winter the night was already closing round us and Strasbourg which was the nearest town was still distant from us several leagues It seemed to me that my only alternative to passing the night in the forest was to take my servant's horse and ride on to Strasbourg an undertaking at that season very far from agreeable However seeing no other resource I was obliged to make up my mind to it accordingly I communicated my design to the postillion telling him that I would send people to assist him as soon as I reached Strasbourg I had not much confidence in his honesty but Stephano being well armed and the driver to all appearance  considerably advanced in years I believed I ran no risk of losing my baggage  Luckily as I then thought an opportunity presented itself of passing the night more agreeably than I expected On mentioning my design of proceeding by myself to Strasbourg the postillion shook his head in disapprobation  "It is a long way" said he "you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there without a guide besides monsieur seems unaccustomed to the season's severity and 'tis possible that unable to sustain the excessive cold"  "What use is there to present me with all these objections" said I impatiently interrupting him "I have no other resource I run still greater risk of perishing with cold by passing the night in the forest"  "Passing the night in the forest" he replied "Oh by St Denis we are not in quite so bad a plight as that comes to yet If I am not mistaken we are scarcely five minutes walk from the cottage of my old friend  Baptiste he is a woodcutter and a very honest fellow I doubt not but he will shelter you for the night with pleasure In the mean time I can take the saddlehorse ride to Strasbourg and be back with proper people to mend your carriage by break of day"  "And in the name of God" said I "how could you leave me so long in suspense Why did you not tell me of this cottage sooner What excessive stupidity"  "I thought that perhaps monsieur would not deign to accept"  "Absurd Come come say no more but conduct us without delay to the woodman's cottage"  He obeyed and we moved onwards the horses contrived with some difficulty▪ to drag the shattered vehicle after us My servant was become almost speechless and I began to feel the effects of the cold myself before we reached the wishedfor cottage It was a small but neat building as we drew near it I rejoiced at observing through the window  the blaze of a comfortable fire Our conductor knocked at the door it was some time before any one answered the people within seemed in doubt whether we should be admitted  "Come come friend Baptiste" cried the driver with impatience "what are you about Are you asleep Or will you refuse a night's lodging to a gentleman whose chaise has just broken down in the forest"  "Ah is it you honest Claude" replied a man's voice from within "wait a moment and the door shall be opened"  Soon after the bolts were drawn back the door was unclosed and a man presented himself to us with a lamp in his hand he gave the guide an hearty reception and then addressed himself to me  "Walk in monsieur walk in and welcome Excuse me for not admitting you at first but there are so many rogues about this place that saving your presence I suspected you to be one"  Thus saying he ushered me into the  room where I had observed the fire I was immediately placed in an easy chair which stood close to the hearth A female whom I supposed to be the wife of my host rose from her seat upon my entrance and received me with a slight and distant reverence She made no answer to my compliment but immediately reseating herself continued the work on which she had been employed Her husband's manners were as friendly as hers were harsh and repulsive  "I wish I could lodge you more conveniently monsieur" said he "but we cannot boast of much spare room in this hovel However a chamber for yourself and another for your servant I think we can make shift to supply You must content yourself with sorry fare but to what we have believe me you are heartily welcome"Then turning to his wife"Why how you sit there Marguerite with as much tranquillity as if you had nothing better to do Stir about dame stir about Get some supper look out some sheets Here here throw  some logs upon the fire for the gentleman seems perished with cold"  The wife threw her work hastily upon the table and proceeded to execute his commands with every mark of unwillingness Her countenance had displeased me on the first moment of my examining it yet upon the whole her features were handsome unquestionably but her skin was sallow and her person thin and meagre a louring gloom overspread her countenance and it bore such visible marks of rancour and illwill as could not escape being noticed by the most inattentive observer her every look and action expressed discontent and impatience and the answers which she gave Baptiste when he reproached her goodhumouredly for her dissatisfied air were tart short and cutting In fine I conceived at first sight equal disgust for her and prepossession in favour of her husband whose appearance was calculated to inspire esteem and confidence His countenance was open sincere and friendly his manners  had all the peasant's honesty unaccompanied by his rudeness his checks were broad full and ruddy and in the solidity of his person he seemed to offer an ample apology for the leanness of his wife's From the wrinkles on his brow I judged him to be turned of sixty but he bore his years well and seemed still hearty and strong The wife could not be more than thirty but in spirits and vivacity she was infinitely older than the husband  However in spite of her unwillingness Marguerite began to prepare the supper while the woodman converted gaily on different subjects The postillion who had been furnished with a bottle of spirits was now ready to set out for Strasbourg and enquired whether I had any further commands  "For Strasbourg" interrupted Baptiste "you are not going thither tonight"  "I beg your pardon if I do not fetch workmen to mend the chaise how is monsieur to proceed tomorrow"  "That is true as you say I had forgotten the chaise Well but Claude you may at least eat your supper here That can make you lose very little time and monsieur looks too kindhearted to send you out with an empty stomach on such a bitter cold night as this is"  To this I readily assented telling the postillion that my reaching Strasbourg the next day an hour or two later would be perfectly immaterial He thanked me and then leaving the cottage with Stephano put up his horses in the woodman's stable Baptiste followed them to the door and looked out with anxiety  "'Tis a sharp biting wind" said he "I wonder what detains my boys so long Monsieur I shall shew you two of the finest lads that ever stepped in shoe of leather the eldest is threeandtwenty the second a year younger their equals for sense courage and activity are not to be found within fifty miles of Strasbourg Would they were  back again I begin to feel uneasy about them"  Marguerite was at this time employed in laying the cloth  "And are you equally anxious for the return of your sons" said I to her  "Not I" she replied peevishly "they are no children of mine"  "Come come Marguerite" said the husband "do not be out of humour with the gentleman for asking a simple question had you not looked so cross he would never have thought you old enough to have a son of threeandtwenty but you see how many years illtemper adds to youExcuse my wife's rudeness monsieur a little thing puts her out and she is somewhat displeased at your not thinking her to be under thirtyThat is the truth is it not Marguerite You know monsieur that age is always a ticklish subject with a woman Come come Marguerite clear up a little If you have not sons as old you will  some twenty years hence and I hope that we shall live to see them just such lads as Jacques and Robert"  Marguerite clasped her hands together passionately  "God forbid" said she "God forbid If I thought it I would strangle them with my own hands"  She quitted the room hastily and went up stairs  I could not help expressing to the woodman how much I pitied him for being chained for life to a partner of such illhumour  "Ah Lord monsieur every one has his share of grievances and Marguerite has fallen to mine Besides after all she is only cross and not malicious the worst is that her affection for two children by a former husband makes her play the stepmother with my two sons she cannot bear the sight of them and by her good will they would never set a foot within my door But on this point I always stand firm and never will consent to abandon the poor lads to the  world's mercy as she has often solicited me to do In every thing else I let her have her own way and truly she manages a family rarely that I must say for her"  We were conversing in this manner when our discourse was interrupted by a loud halloo which rang through the forest  "My sons I hope" exclaimed the woodman and ran to open the door  The halloo was repeated We now distinguished the trampling of horses and soon after a carriage attended by several cavaliers stopped at the cottage door One of the horsemen enquired how far they were still from Strasbourg As he addressed himself to me I answered in the number of miles which Claude had told me upon which a volley of curses was vented against the drivers for having lost their way The persons in the coach were now informed of the distance of Strasbourg and also that the horses were so fatigued as to be incapable of proceeding further A lady who appeared  to be the principal expressed much chagrin at this intelligence but as there was no remedy one of the attendants asked the woodman whether he could furnish them with lodging for the night  He seemed much embarrassed and replied in the negative adding that a Spanish gentleman and his servant were already in possession of the only spare apartments in his house On hearing this the gallantry of my nation would not permit me to retain those accommodations of which a female was in want I instantly signified to the woodman that I transferred my right to the lady he made some objections but I overruled them and hastening to the carriage opened the door and assisted the lady to descend I immediately recognized her for the same person whom I had seen at the inn at Luneville I took an opportunity of asking one of her attendants what was her name  "The baroness Lindenberg" was the answer  I could not but remark how different a reception our host had given these newcomers and myself His reluctance to admit them was visibly expressed on his countenance and he prevailed on himself with difficulty to tell the lady that she was welcome I conducted her into the house and placed her in the armchair which I had just quitted She thanked me very graciously and made a thousand apologies for putting me to an inconvenience Suddenly the woodman's countenance cleared up  "At last I have arranged it" said he interrupting her excuses "I can lodge you and your suite madam and you will not be under the necessity of making this gentleman suffer for his politeness We have two spare chambers one for the lady the other monsieur for you my wife shall give up hers to the two waitingwomen as for the men servants they must content themselves with passing the night in a large barn which stands at a few yards distance from the house there they shall have a blazing fire and as  good a supper as we can make shift to give them"  After several expressions of gratitude on the lady's part and opposition on mine to Marguerite's giving up her bed this arrangement was agreed to As the room was small the baroness immediately dismissed her male domestics Baptiste was on the point of conducting them to the barn which he had mentioned when two young men appeared at the door of the cottage  "Hell and furies" exclaimed the first starting back "Robert the house is filled with strangers"  "Ha there are my sons" cried our host "Why Jacques Robert whither are you running boys There is room enough still for you"  Upon this assurance the youths returned The father presented them to the baroness and myself after which he withdrew with our domestics while at the request of the two waitingwomen Marguerite conducted  them to the room designed for their mistress  The two newcomers were tall stout wellmade young men hardfeatured and very much sunburnt They paid their compliments to us in few words and acknowledged Claude who now entered the room as an old acquaintance They then threw aside their cloaks in which they were wrapped up took off a leathern belt to which a large cutlass was suspended and each drawing a brace of pistols from his girdle laid them upon a shelf  "You travel well armed" said I  "True monsieur" replied Robert  "We left Strasbourg late this evening and 'tis necessary to take precautions at passing through this forest after dark it does not bear a good repute I promise you"  "How" said the baroness "are there robbers hereabout"  "So it is said madame for my own part I have travelled through the wood at  all hours and never met with one of them"  Here Marguerite returned Her stepsons drew her to the other end of the room and whispered her for some minutes By the looks which they cast towards us at intervals I conjectured them to be enquiring our business in the cottage  In the mean while the baroness expressed her apprehensions that her husband would be suffering much anxiety upon her account She had intended to send on one of her servants to inform the baron of her delay but the account which the young men gave of the forest rendered this plan impracticable Claude relieved her from her embarrassment he informed her that he was under the necessity of reaching Strasbourg that night and that would she trust him with a letter she might depend upon its being safely delivered  "And how comes it" said I "that you are under no apprehension of meeting these robbers"  "Alas monsieur a poor man with a large family must not lose certain profit because 'tis attended with a little danger and perhaps my lord the baron may give me a trifle for my pains besides I have nothing to lose except my life and that will not be worth the robbers taking"  I thought his arguments bad and advised his waiting till the morning but as the baroness did not second me I was obliged to give up the point The baroness Lindenberg as I found afterwards had long been accustomed to sacrifice the interests of others to her own and her wish to send Claude to Strasbourg blinded her to the danger of the undertaking Accordingly it was resolved that he should set out without delay The baroness wrote her letter to her husband and I sent a few lines to my banker apprising him that I should not be at Strasbourg till the next day Claude took our letters and left the cottage  The lady declared herself much fatigued by her journey besides having  come from some distance the drivers had contrived to lose their way in the forest She now addressed herself to Marguerite desiring to be shewn to her chamber and permitted to take half an hour's repose One of the waitingwomen was immediately summoned she appeared with a light and the baroness followed her up stairs The cloth was spreading in the chamber where I was and Marguerite soon gave me to understand that I was in her way Her hints were too broad to be easily mistaken I therefore desired one of the young men to conduct me to the chamber where I was to sleep and where I could remain till supper was ready  "Which chamber is it mother" said Robert  "The one with green hangings" she replied "I have just been at the trouble of getting it ready and have put fresh sheets upon the bed if the gentleman chooses to lollop and lounge upon it he may make it again himself for me"  "You are out of humour mother but that is no novelty Have the goodness to follow me monsieur"  He opened the door and advanced towards a narrow staircase  "You have got no light" said Marguerite "is it your own neck or the gentleman's that you have a mind to break"  She crossed by me and put a candle into Robert's hand having received which he began to ascend the staircase Jacques was employed in laying the cloth and his back was turned towards me Marguerite seized the moment when we were unobserved she caught my hand and pressed it strongly  "Look at the sheets" said she as she passed me and immediately resumed her former occupation  Startled by the abruptness of her action I remained as if petrified Robert's voice desiring me to follow him recalled me to myself I ascended the staircase My conductor ushered me into a chamber where  an excellent wood fire was blazing upon the hearth He placed the light upon the table enquired whether I had any further commands and on my replying in the negative left me to myself You may be certain that the moment when I found myself alone was that on which I complied with Marguerite's injunction I took the candle hastily approached the bed and turned down the coverture What was my astonishment my horror at finding the sheets crimsoned with blood  At that moment a thousand confused ideas passed before my imagination The robbers who infested the wood Marguerite's exclamation respecting her children the arms and appearance of the two young men and the various anecdotes which I had heard related respecting the secret correspondence which frequently exists between banditti and postillions all these circumstances flashed upon my mind and inspired me with doubt and apprehension I ruminated on the most probable means of ascertaining  the truth of my conjectures Suddenly I was aware of some one below pacing hastily backwards and forwards Every thing now appeared to me an object of suspicion With precaution I drew near the window which as the room had been long shut up was left open in spite of the cold I ventured to look out The beams of the moon permitted me to distinguish a man whom I had no difficulty to recognize for my host I watched his movements He walked swiftly then stopped and seemed to listen he stamped upon the ground and beat his stomach with his arms as if to guard himself from the inclemency of the season at the least noise if a voice was heard in the lower part of the house if a bat flitted past him or the wind rattled amidst the leafless boughs he started and looked round with anxiety  "Plague take him" said he at length with extreme impatience "what can he be about"  He spoke in a low voice but as he  was just below my window I had no difficulty to distinguish his words  I now heard the steps of one approaching Baptiste went towards the sound he joined a man whom his low stature and the horn suspended from his neck declared to be no other than my faithful Claude whom I had supposed to be already on his way to Strasbourg Expecting their discourse to throw some light upon my situation I hastened to put myself in a condition to hear it with safety For this purpose I extinguished the c  ndle which stood upon a table near the bed the flame of the fire was not strong enough to betray me and I immediately resumed my place at the window  The objects of my curiosity had stationed themselves directly under it I suppose that during my momentary absence the woodman had been blaming Claude for tardiness since when I returned to the window the latter was endeavouring to excuse his fault  "However" added he "my diligence  at present shall make up for my past delay"  "On that condition" answered Baptiste "I shall readily forgive you but in truth as you share equally with us in our prizes your own interest will make you use all possible diligence 'Twould be a shame to let such a noble booty escape us You say that this Spaniard is rich"  "His servant boasted at the inn that the effects in his chaise were worth above two thousand pistoles"  Oh how I cursed Stephano's imprudent vanity  "And I have been told" continued the postillion "that this baroness carries about her a casket of jewels of immense value"  "May be so but I had rather she had stayed away The Spaniard was a secure prey the boys and myself could easily have mastered him and his servant and then the two thousand pistoles would have been shared between us four Now we must let in the band for a share and perhaps the  whole covey may escape us Should our friends have betaken themselves to their different posts before you reach the cavern all will be lost The lady's attendants are too numerous for us to over power them Unless our associates arrive in time we must needs let these travellers set out to morrow without damage or hurt"  "'Tis plaguy unlucky that my comrades who drove the coach should be those unacquainted with our confederacy But never fear friend Baptiste an hour will bring me to the cavern it is now but ten o'clock and by twelve you may expect the arrival of the band By the bye take care of your wife you know how strong is her repugnance to our mode of life and she may find means to give information to the lady's servants of our design"  "Oh I am secure of her silence she is too much afraid of me and fond of her children to dare to betray my secret Besides Jacques and Robert keep a strict eye over her and she is not permitted to set a  foot out of the cottage The servants are safely lodged in the barn I shall endeavour to keep all quiet till the arrival of our friends Were I assured of your finding them the strangers should be dispatched this instant but as it is possible for you to miss the banditti I am fearful of being summoned by their domestics to produce them in the morning"  "And suppose either of the travellers should discover your design"  "Then we must poniard those in our power and take our chance about mastering the rest However to avoid running such a risk hasten to the cavern the banditti never leave it before eleven and if you use diligence you may reach it in time to stop them"  "Tell Robert that I have taken his horse my own has broken his bridle and escaped into the wood What is the watchword"  "The reward of courage"  "'Tis sufficient I hasten to the cavern"  "And I to rejoin my guests lest my absence  should create suspicion Farewell and be diligent"  These worthy associates now separated the one bent his course towards the stable while the other returned to the house  You may judge what must have been my feelings during this conversation of which I lost not a single syllable I dared not trust myself to my reflections nor did any means present itself to escape the dangers which threatened me Resistance I knew to be vain I was unarmed and a single man against three However I resolved at least to sell my life as dearly as I could Dreading lest Baptiste should perceive my absence and suspect me to have overheard the message with which Claude was dispatched I hastily relighted my candle and quitted the chamber On descending I found the table spread for six persons The baroness sat by the fireside Marguerite was employed in dressing a sallad and her stepsons were whispering together at the further end of the room Baptiste having the round of the garden  to make ere he could reach the cottage door was not yet arrived I seated myself quietly opposite to the baroness  A glance upon Marguerite told her that her hint had not been thrown away upon me How different did she now appear to me What before seemed gloom and sullenness I now found to be disgust at her associates and compassion for my danger I looked up to her as to my only resource yet knowing her to be watched by her husband with a suspicious eye I could place but little reliance on the exertions of her good will  In spite of all my endeavours to conceal it my agitation was but too visibly expressed upon my countenance I was pale and both my words and actions were disordered and embarrassed The young men observed this and enquired the cause I attributed it to excess of fatigue and the violent effect produced on me by the severity of the season Whether they believed me or not I will not pretend to say they at least ceased to embarrass  me with their questions I strove to divert my attention from the perils which surrounded me by conversing on different subjects with the baroness I talked of Germany declaring my intention of visiting it immediately God knows that I little thought at that moment of ever seeing it She replied to me with great ease and politeness professed that the pleasure of making my acquaintance amply compensated for the delay in her journey and gave me a pressing invitation to make some stay at the castle of Lindenberg As she spoke thus the youths exchanged a malicious smile which declared that she would be fortunate if she ever reached that castle herself This action did not escape me but I concealed the emotion which it excited in my breast I continued to converse with the lady but my discourse was so frequently incoherent that▪ as she has since informed me she began to doubt whether I was in my right senses The fact was that while my conversation turned upon one subject my thoughts were entirely occupied  by another I meditated upon the means of quitting the cottage finding my way to the barn and giving the domestics information of our host's designs I was soon convinced how impracticable was the attempt Jacques and Robert watched my every movement with an attentive eye and I was obliged to abandon the idea All my hopes now rested upon Claude's not finding the banditti In that case according to what I had overheard we should be permitted to depart unhurt  I shuddered involuntarily as Baptiste entered the room He made many apologies for his long absence but "he had been detained by affairs impossible to be delayed" He then entreated permission for his family to sup at the same table with us without which respect would not authorize his taking such a liberty Oh how in my heart I cursed the hypocrite how I loathed his presence who was on the point of depriving me of an existence at that time infinitely dear I had every reason  to be satisfied with life I had youth wealth rank and education and the fairest prospects presented themselves before me I saw those prospects on the point of closing in the most horrible manner yet was I obliged to dissimulate and to receive with a semblance of gratitude the false civilities of him who held the dagger to my bosom  The permission which our host demanded was easily obtained We seated ourselves at the table The baroness and myself occupied one side the sons were opposite to us with their backs to the door Baptiste took his seat by the baroness at the upper end and the place next to him was left for his wife She soon entered the room and placed before us a plain but comfortable peasant's repast Our host thought it necessary to apologize for the poorness of the supper "he had not been apprized of our coming he could only offer us such fare as had been intended for his own family"  "But" added he "should any accident  detain my noble guests longer than they at present intend I hope to give them a better treatment"  The villain I well knew the accident to which he alluded I shuddered at the treatment which he taught us to expect  My companion in danger seemed entirely to have got rid of her chagrin at being delayed She laughed and conversed with the family with infinite gaiety I strove but in vain to follow her example My spirits were evidently forced and the constraint which I put upon myself escaped not Baptiste's observation  "Come come monsieur cheer up" said he "you seem not quite recovered from your fatigue To raise your spirits what say you to a glass of excellent old wine which was left me by my father God rest his soul he is in a better world I seldom produce this wine but as I am not honoured with such guests every day this is an occasion which deserves a bottle"  He then gave his wife a key and instructed  her where to find the wine of which he spoke She seemed by no means pleased with the commission she took the key with an embarrassed air and hesitated to quit the table  "Did you hear me" said Baptiste in an angry tone  Marguerite darted upon him a look of mingled anger and fear and left the chamber His eyes followed her suspiciously till she had closed the door  She soon returned with a bottle sealed with yellow wax She placed it upon the table and gave the key back to her husband I suspected that this liquor was not presented to us without design and I watched Marguerite's movements with inquietude She was employed in rinsing some small horn goblets As she placed them before Baptiste she saw that my eye was fixed upon her and at the moment when she thought herself unobserved by the banditti she motioned to me with her head not to taste the liquor She then resumed her place  In the mean while our host had drawn the cork and filling two of the goblets offered them to the lady and myself She at first made some objections but the instances of Baptiste were so urgent that she was obliged to comply Fearing to excite suspicion I hesitated not to take the goblet presented to me By its smell and colour I guessed it to be champagne but some grains of powder floating upon the top convinced me that it was not unadulterated However I dared not to express my repugnance to drinking it I lifted it to my lips and seemed to be swallowing it suddenly starting from my chair I made the best of my way towards a vase of water at some distance in which Marguerite had been rinsing the goblets I pretended to spit out the wine with disgust and took an opportunity unperceived of emptying the liquor into the vase  The banditti seemed alarmed at my action Jacques half rose from his chair put his hand into his bosom and I discovered  the haft of a dagger I returned to my seat with tranquillity and affected not to have observed their confusion  "You have not suited my taste honest friend" said I addressing myself to Baptiste "I never can drink champagne without its producing a violent illness I swallowed a few mouthfuls ere I was aware of its quality and fear that I shall suffer for my imprudence"  Baptiste and Jacques exchanged looks of distrust  "Perhaps" said Robert "the smell may be disagreeable to you"  He quitted his chair and removed the goblet I observed that he examined whether it was nearly empty  "He must have drank sufficient" said he to his brother in a low voice while he reseated himself  Marguerite looked apprehensive that I had tasted the liquor A glance from my eye reassured her  I waited with anxiety for the effects  which the beverage would produce upon the lady I doubted not but the grains which I had observed were poisonous and lamented that it had been impossible for me to warn her of the danger But a few minutes had elapsed before I perceived her eyes grow heavy her head sank upon her shoulder and she fell into a deep sleep I affected not to attend to this circumstance and continued my conversation with Baptiste with all the outward gaiety in my power to assume But he no longer answered me without constraint He eyed me with distrust and astonishment and I saw that the banditti were frequently whispering among themselves My situation became every moment more painful I sustained the character of confidence with a worse grace than ever Equally afraid of the arrival of their accomplices and of their suspecting my knowledge of their designs I knew not how to dissipate the distrust which the banditti evidently entertained for me In this new dilemma the  friendly Marguerite again assisted me She passed behind the chairs of her stepsons stopped for a moment opposite to me closed her eyes and reclined her head upon her shoulder This hint immediately dispelled my incertitude It told me that I ought to imitate the baroness and pretend that the liquor had taken its full effect upon me I did so and in a few minutes seemed perfectly overcome with slumber  "So" cried Baptiste as I fell back in my chair "at last he sleeps I began to think that he had scented our design and that we should have been forced to dispatch him at all events"  "And why not dispatch him at all events" enquired the ferocious Jacques "why leave him the possibility of betraying our secret Marguerite give me one of my pistols a single touch of the trigger will finish him at once"  "And supposing" rejoined the father "supposing that our friends should not arrive to night a pretty figure we should make  when the servants enquire for him in the morning No no Jacques we must wait for our associates If they join us we are strong enough to dispatch the domestics as well as their masters and the booty is our own If Claude does not find the troop we must take patience and suffer the prey to slip through our fingers Ah boys boys had you arrived but five minutes sooner the Spaniard would have been done for and two thousand pistoles our own But you are always out of the way when you are most wanted You are the most unlucky rogues"  "Well well father" answered Jacques "had you been of my mind all would have been over by this time You Robert Claude and myselfwhy the strangers were but double the number and I warrant you we might have mastered them However Claude is gone 'tis too late to think of it now We must wait patiently for the arrival of the gang and if the travellers  escape us tonight we must take care to waylay them tomorrow"  "True true" said Baptiste "Marguerite have you given the sleepingdraught to the waitingwomen"  She replied in the affirmative  "All then is safe Come come boys whatever falls out we have no reason to complain of this adventure We run no danger may gain much and can lose nothing"  At this moment I heard a trampling of horses Oh how dreadful was the sound to my ears A cold sweat flowed down my forehead and I felt all the terrors of impending death I was by no means reassured by hearing the compassionate Marguerite exclaim in the accents of despair  "Almighty God they are lost"  Luckily the woodman and his sons were too much occupied by the arrival of their associates to attend to me or the violence of my agitation would have convinced them that my sleep was feigned  "Open open" exclaimed several voices on the outside of the cottage  "Yes yes" cried Baptiste joyfully "they are our friends sure enough Now then our booty is certain Away lads away Lead them to the barn you know what is to be done there"  Robert hastened to open the door of the cottage  "But first" said Jacques taking up his arms "first let me dispatch these sleepers"  "No no no" replied his father "Go you to the barn where your presence is wanted Leave me to take care of these and the women above"  Jacques obeyed and followed his brother They seemed to converse with the newcomers for a few minutes after which I heard the robbers dismount and as I conjectured bend their course towards the barn  "So that is wisely done" muttered Baptiste "they have quitted their horses  that they may fall upon the strangers by surprise Good good and now to business"  I heard him approach a small cupboard which was fixed up in a distant part of the room and unlock it At this moment I felt myself shaken gently  "Now now" whispered Marguerite  I opened my eyes Baptiste stood with his back towards me No one else was in the room save Marguerite and the sleeping lady The villain had taken a dagger from the cupboard and seemed examining whether it was sufficiently sharp I had neglected to furnish myself with arms but I perceived this to be my only chance of escaping and resolved not to lose the opportunity I sprang from my seat darted suddenly upon Baptiste and clasping my hands round his throat pressed it so forcibly as to prevent his uttering a single cry You may remember that I was remarkable at Salamanca for the power of my arm It now rendered me an essential service Surprised  terrified and breathless the villain was by no means an equal antagonist I threw him upon the ground I grasped him still tighter and while I fixed him without motion upon the floor Marguerite wresting the dagger from his hand plunged it repeatedly in his heart till he expired  No sooner was this horrible but necessary act perpetrated than Marguerite called on me to follow her  "Flight is our only refuge" said she "quick quick away"  I hesitated not to obey her but unwilling to leave the baroness a victim to the vengeance of the robbers I raised her in my arms still sleeping and hastened after Marguerite The horses of the banditti were fastened near the door My conductress sprang upon one of them I followed her example placed the baroness before me and spurred on my horse Our only hope was to reach Strasbourg which was much nearer than the perfidious Claude had assured me Marguerite was well acquainted  with the road and galloped on before me We were obliged to pass by the barn where the robbers were slaughtering our domestics The door was open we distinguished the shrieks of the dying and imprecations of the murderers What I felt at that moment language is unable to describe  Jacques heard the trampling of our horses as we rushed by the barn He flew to the door with a burning torch in his hand and easily recognised the fugitives  "Betrayed betrayed" he shouted to his companions  Instantly they left their bloody work and hastened to regain their horses We heard no more I buried my spurs in the sides of my courser and Marguerite goaded on hers with the poniard which had already rendered us such good service We flew light lightning and gained the open plains Already was Strasbourg's steeple in sight when we heard the robbers pursuing us Marguerite looked back and distinguished  our followers descending a small hill at no great distance It was in vain that we urged on our horses the noise approached nearer with every moment  "We are lost" she exclaimed "the villains gain upon us"  "On on" replied I "I hear the trampling of horses coming from the town"  We redoubled our exertions and were soon aware of a numerous band of cavaliers who came towards us at full speed They were on the point of passing us  "Stay stay" shrieked Marguerite "save us for God's sake save us"  The foremost who seemed to act as guide immediately reined in his steed  "'Tis she 'tis she" exclaimed he springing upon the ground "Stop my lord stop they are safe 'tis my mother"  At the same moment Marguerite threw herself from her horse clasped him in her arms and covered him with kisses The other cavaliers stopped at the exclamation  "The baroness Lindenberg" cried another of the strangers eagerly "Where is she Is she not with you"  He stopped on beholding her lying senseless in my arms Hastily he caught her from me The profound sleep in which she was plunged made him at first tremble for her life but the beating of her heart soon reassured him  "God be thanked" said he "she has escaped unhurt"  I interrupted his joy by pointing out the brigands who continued to approach No sooner had I mentioned them than the greatest part of the company which appeared to be chiefly composed of soldiers hastened forward to meet them The villains staid not to receive their attack Perceiving their danger they turned the heads of their horses and fled into the wood whither they were followed by our preservers In the mean while the stranger whom I guessed to be the baron Lindenberg after thanking me for my care of his lady proposed our returning with all speed to the  town The baroness on whom the effects of the opiate had not ceased to operate was placed before him Marguerite and her son remounted their horses the baron's domestics followed and we soon arrived at the inn where he had taken his apartments  This was at the Austrian Eagle where my banker whom before my quitting Paris I had apprised of my intention to visit Strasbourg had prepared lodgings for me I rejoiced at this circumstance It gave me an opportunity of cultivating the baron's acquaintance which I foresaw would be of use to me in Germany Immediately upon our arrival the lady was conveyed to bed A physician was sent for who prescribed a medicine likely to counteract the effects of the sleepy potion and after it had been poured down her throat she was committed to the care of the hostess The baron then addressed himself to me and entreated me to recount the particulars of this adventure I complied with his request instantaneously for in pain respecting Stephano's  fate whom I had been compelled to abandon to the cruelty of the banditti I found it impossible for me to repose till I had some news of him I received but too soon the intelligence that my trusty servant had perished The soldiers who had pursued the brigands returned while I was employed in relating my adventure to the baron By their account I found that the robbers had been overtaken Guilt and true courage are incompatible they had thrown themselves at the feet of their pursuers had surrendered themselves without striking a blow had discovered their secret retreat made known their signals by which the rest of the gang might be seized and in short had betrayed every mark of cowardice and baseness By this means the whole of the band consisting of near sixty persons had been made prisoners bound and conducted to Strasbourg  Some of the soldiers hastened to the cottage one of the banditti serving them as guide Their first visit was to the fatal barn where they were fortunate enough to find two of the baron's servants still alive though desperately  wounded The rest had expired beneath the swords of the robbers and of these my unhappy Stephano was one  Alarmed at our escape the robbers in their haste to overtake us had neglected to visit the cottage in consequence the soldiers found the two waitingwomen unhurt and buried in the same deathlike slumber which had overpowered their mistress There was nobody else found in the cottage except a child not above four years old which the soldiers brought away with them We were busying ourselves with conjectures respecting the birth of this little unfortunate when Marguerite rushed into the room with the baby in her arms She fell at the feet of the officer who was making us this report and blessed him a thousand times for the preservation of her child  When the first burst of maternal tenderness was over I besought her to declare by what means she had been united to a man whose principles seemed so totally discordant with her own She bent her eyes downwards and wiped a few tears from her cheek  "Gentlemen" said she after a silence of some minutes "I would request a favour of you You have a right to know on whom you confer an obligation I will not therefore stifle a confession which covers me with shame but permit me to comprise it in as few words as possible  "I was born in Strasbourg of respectable parents their names I must at present conceal My father still lives and deserves not to be involved in my infamy If you grant my request you shall be informed of my family name A villain made himself master of my affections and to follow him I quitted my father's house Yet though my passions overpowered my virtue I sunk not into that degeneracy of vice but too commonly the lot of women who make the first false step I loved my seducer dearly loved him I was true to his bed this baby and the youth who warned you my lord baron of your lady's danger are the pledges of our affection Even at this moment I lament his loss though 'tis to him that I owe all the miseries of my existence  "He was of noble birth but he had squandered away his paternal inheritance His relations considered him as a disgrace to their name and utterly discarded him His excesses drew upon him the indignation of the police He was obliged to fly from Strasbourg and saw no other resource from beggary than an union with the banditti who infested the neighbouring forest and whose troop was chiefly composed of young men of family in the same predicament with himself I was determined not to forsake him I followed him to the cavern of the brigands and shared with him the misery inseparable from a life of pillage But though I was aware that our existence was supported by plunder I knew not all the horrible circumstances attached to my lover's profession these he concealed from me with the utmost care He was conscious that my sentiments were not sufficiently depraved to look without horror upon assassination He supposed and with justice that I should fly with detestation from the embraces of a murderer Eight  years of possession had not abated his love for me and he cautiously removed from my knowledge every circumstance which might lead me to suspect the crimes in which he but too often participated He succeeded perfectly It was not till after my seducer's death that I discovered his hands to have been stained with the blood of innocence  "One fatal night he was brought back to the cavern covered with wounds he received them in attacking an English traveller whom his companions immediately sacrificed to their resentment He had only time to entreat my pardon for all the sorrows which he had caused me he pressed my hand to his lips and expired My grief was inexpressible As soon as its violence abated I resolved to return to Strasbourg to throw myself with my two children at my father's feet and implore his forgiveness though I little hoped to obtain it What was my consternation when informed that no one entrusted with the secret of their retreat was ever permitted to  quit the troop of the banditti that I must give up all hopes of ever rejoining society and consent instantly to accept one of their band for my husband My prayers and remonstrances were vain They cast lots to decide to whose possession I should fall I became the property of the infamous Baptiste A robber who had once been a monk pronounced over us a burlesque rather than a religious ceremony I and my children were delivered into the hands of my new husband and he conveyed us immediately to his home  "He assured me that he had long entertained for me the most ardent regard but that friendship for my deceased lover had obliged him to stifle his desires He endeavoured to reconcile me to my fate and for some time treated me with respect and gentleness At length finding that my aversion rather increased than diminished he obtained those favours by violence which I persisted to refuse him No resource remained for me but to bear my sorrows with patience I was conscious that I deserved  them but too well Flight was forbidden My children were in the power of Baptiste and he had sworn that if I attempted to escape their lives should pay for it I had had too many opportunities of witnessing the barbarity of his nature to doubt his fulfilling his oath to the very letter Sad experience had convinced me of the horrors of my situation My first lover had carefully concealed them from me Baptiste rather rejoiced in opening my eyes to the cruelties of his profession and strove to familiarise me with blood and slaughter  "My nature was licentious and warm but not cruel my conduct had been imprudent but my heart was not unprincipled Judge then what I must have felt at being a continual witness of crimes the most horrible and revolting Judge how I must have grieved at being united to a man who received the unsuspeding guest with an air of openness and hospitality at the very moment that he meditated his destruction Chagrin and discontent preyed upon my constitution the few charms bestowed on me by nature withered away and the dejection of  my countenance denoted the sufferings of my heart I was tempted a thousand times to put an end to my existence but the remembrance of my children held my hand I trembled to leave my dear boys in my tyrant's power and trembled yet more for their virtue than their lives The second was still too young to benefit by my instructions but in the heart of my eldest I laboured unceasingly to plant those principles which might enable him to avoid the crimes of his parents He listened to me with docility or rather with eagerness Even at his early age he shewed that he was not calculated for the society of villains and the only comfort which I enjoyed among my sorrows was to witness the dawning virtues of my Theodore  "Such was my situation when the perfidy of Don Alphonso's postillion conducted him to the cottage His youth air and manners interested me most forcibly in his behalf The absence of my husband's sons gave me an opportunity which I had long wished to find and I resolved to risque every thing to preserve the stranger  The vigilance of Baptiste prevented me from warning Don Alphonso of his danger I knew that my betraying the secret would be immediately punished with death and however embittered was my life by calamities I wanted courage to sacrifice it for the sake of preserving that of another person My only hope rested upon procuring succour from Strasbourg At this I resolved to try and should an opportunity offer of warning Don Alphonso of his danger unobserved I was determined to seize it with avidity By Baptiste's orders I went up stairs to make the stranger's bed I spread upon it sheets in which a traveller had been murdered but a few nights before and which still were stained with blood I hoped that these marks would not escape the vigilance of our guest and that he would collect from them the designs of my perfidious husband Neither was this the only step which I took to preserve the stranger Theodore was confined to his bed by illness I stole into his room unobserved by my tyrant communicated to him my project and he entered into it with eagerness  He rose in spite of his malady and dressed himself with all speed I fastened one of the sheets round his arms and lowered him from the window He flew to the stable took Claude's horse and hastened to Strasbourg Had he been accosted by the banditti he was to have declared himself sent upon a message by Baptiste but fortunately he reached the town without meeting any obstacle Immediately upon his arrival at Strasbourg he entreated assistance from the magistrate his story passed from mouth to mouth and at length came to the knowledge of my lord the baron Anxious for the safety of his lady who he knew would be upon the road that evening it struck him that she might have fallen into the power of the robbers He accompanied Theodore who guided the soldiers towards the cottage and arrived just in time to save us from falling once more into the hands of our enemies"  Here I interrupted Marguerite to enquire why the sleepy potion had been presented to me She said that Baptiste supposed me to have arms about me and  wished to incapacitate me from making resistance it was a precaution which he always took since as the travellers had no hopes of escaping despair would have incited them to sell their lives dearly  The baron then desired Marguerite to inform him what were her present plans I joined him in declaring my readiness to shew my gratitude to her for the preservation of my life  "Disgusted with a world" she replied "in which I have met with nothing but misfortunes my only wish is to retire into a convent But first I must provide for my children I find that my mother is no moreprobably driven to an untimely grave by my desertion My father is still living He is not an hard man Perhaps gentlemen in spite of my ingratitude and imprudence your intercessions may induce him to forgive me and to take charge of his unfortunate grandsons If you obtain this boon for me you will repay my services a thousandfold"  Both the baron and myself assured Marguerite that we would spare no pains to  obtain her pardon and that even should her father be inflexible she need be under no apprehensions respecting the fate of her children I engaged myself to provide for Theodore and the baron promised to take the youngest under his protection The grateful mother thanked us with tears for what she called generosity but which in fact was no more than a proper sense of our obligations to her She then left the room to put her little boy to bed whom fatigue and sleep had completely overpowered  The baroness on recovering and being informed from what dangers I had rescued her set no bounds to the expressions of her gratitude She was joined so warmly by her husband in pressing me to accompany them to their castle in Bavaria that I found it impossible to resist their entreaties During a week which we passed at Strasbourg the interests of Marguerite were not forgotten In our application to her father we succeeded as amply as we could wish The good old man had lost his wife He had no children but this unfortunate daughter of whom he had received  no news for almost fourteen years He was surrounded by distant relations who waited with impatience for his decease in order to get possession of his money When therefore Marguerite appeared again so unexpectedly he considered her as a gift from Heaven He received her and her children with open arms and insisted upon their establishing themselves in his house without delay The disappointed cousins were obliged to give place The old man would not hear of his daughter's retiring into a convent He said that she was too necessary to his happiness and she was easily persuaded to relinquish her designs But no persuasions could induce Theodore to give up the plan which I had at first marked out for him He had attached himself to me most sincerely during my stay at Strasbourg and when I was on the point of leaving it he besought me with tears to take him into my service He set forth all his little talents in the most favourable colours and tried to convince me that I should find him of infinite use to me upon the road I was unwilling to charge myself  with a lad scarcely turned of thirteen who I knew could only be a burthen to me however I could not resist the entreaties of this affectionate youth who in fact possessed a thousand estimable qualities With some difficulty he persuaded his relations to let him follow me and that permission once obtained he was dubbed with the title of my page Having passed a week at Strasbourg Theodore and myself set out for Bavaria in company with the baron and his lady These latter as well as myself had forced Marguerite to accept several presents of value both for herself and her youngest son On leaving her I promised his mother faithfully that I would restore Theodore to her within the year  I have related this adventure at length Lorenzo that you might understand the means by which "the adventurer Alphonso d'Alvarada got introduced into the castle of Lindenberg" Judge from this specimen how much faith should be given to your aunt's assertions  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
