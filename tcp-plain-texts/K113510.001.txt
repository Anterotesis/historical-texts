had many solicitations from private friends and a few wishes from persons unknown delivered in the public prints to commit to the press a part in the form in which the posthumous volumes might hereafter make their appearance I might have pleaded the imprudence of the attempt at my time of life of beginning so arduous an undertaking in my st year I happily till very lately had scarcely any admonition of the advanced season I plunged into the sea of troubles and with my papers in one hand made my way through the waves with the other and brought them secure to land This alas is senile boasting I must submit to the judgment of the public and learn from thence how far I am to be censured for so grievous an offence against the maxim of  Aristotle  who fixes the decline of human abilities to the th year I ought to shudder when I consider  the wear and tare of twentytwo years and I feel shocked at the remark of the elegant  Delaney  who observes  that it is generally agreed among wise men that few great attempts at lest in the learned way have ever been wisely undertaken and happily executed after that period  I cannot defend the wisdom yet from the good fortune of my life I will attempt the execution  It will be formed upon the model of my INTRODUCTION to the ARCTIC ZOOLOGY imitating as far as my talents will admit the great examples left by the disciples of the LINNAEAN school and the solid writings of the liberal and communicative race of the  hyperborean  learned fitted by climate to assiduous study and to retain the immenseness of their knowlege when acquired The Torrid Zone generally enervates the body and mind The divine particle melts away and every idea is too often lost in irresistible indolence  Yet there are two writers to whom I must own the highest obligations who felt no degeneracy by the influence of climate Their thoughts are as firm and collected as if they had been braced by the steady frost of the north  The first is  James Rennel  Esquire late Major of Engineers and Surveyor General in  Bengal  The effects of his  labors more immediately applied to the national service have been productive of others which have proved the brightest elucidations of a country till after the year little more than the object of conquest and now and then rarely indeed of sordid adventure Mr  Rennel  's Map of  Hindoostan  or the  Mogul  Empire and the attendant Memoir are unparalleled convictions of the accuracy of the author in the study of geography in which no rival dare dispute the palm of merit I cannot express the obligations my present Work is under to his labors I understand that there is another of the same nature but far more extensive perhaps in the pressevery success attend the labors of his pen  I pede fausto  Grandia laturus meritorum praemia  The other writer I allude to is the celebrated Sir WILLIAM JONES The subjects of that true genius were favored by APOLLO himself being as sublime and elegant as those over which that deity peculiarly presided The SUN whose character might melt away the powers of feeble Genii served only to exalt his strength of mind as its beams are feigned to give additional brilliancy to the diamond in its mine The reader will not wonder that  I make him so nearly the  Alpha  and  Omega  of this my labor The various pen of my illustrious countryman excelled in every science  Phoebus  smiled on all his undertakings and he was saluted by the whole circle attendant on the deity as  Gallus  is said to have been of old A truer simile cannot be adduced  Utque vero PHOEBI Chorus surrexerit omnis  I must not be silent in respect to the labors of another gentleman who notwithstanding he never visited  Hindoostan  has written with uncommon success on the wonderful mythology of the  Hindoo  religion derived most happily the sources of many of its mysteries and traced their origins nearly lost in the mists of fable from the sacred purity of HOLY WRIT He has done the same by numbers of the abstrusest antiquities of the works of art and that with a depth of learning and perspicuity rarely to be met with But alas no CHOIR rises to salute the Reverend  Thomas Maurice  This learned divine bends under the weight of  honesta pauperies  That still voice which hurtmerit and conscious modesty cannot always suppress is often drowned in the clamors of the undaunted throng so as never to emerge into the notice of those whose  peculiar duty it is to search deeply into characters be they in courts or choirs and to put to flight the  ignavum pecus  which are too frequently the pests of both  Who for their bellies sake  Creep and intrude and climb into the fold  Of other care they little reck'ning make  Than how to scramble at the shearers feast  And shove away the worthy bidden guest  THOMAS PENNANT  DOWNING  January  VOLUME IPLATES  FRONTISPIECE  A YOGEY or penitential  Faquir  These classes devote themselves to varieties of most cruel austerities  Tavernier  at p of his travels in  India  gives a plate of the various penances they inflict on themselves They select a large Baniantree under which they astonish mankind with their strange distortions These soon lose the use of some or other of their limbs by their persisting in the most unnatural attitudes They are the most squalid of the order They leave the hair of their head to grow far below their rumps and the beards to an enormous bushiness They permit their nails to assume the form of talons and often by clasping their hands suffer them to penetrate deep into the flesh  The other figure is of a  Pandaram  or  Senassey  of the class of pilgrims to the various Pagodas many of which are as eminent for their sanctity and miraculous powers as those of the most superstitious  Europeans  These are from their active life stout and robust They wear their hair short on the sides and tied up in a knot on the top of their head Their beards short and rough Their

Palace of the Rajah of Tassisudon  SHOULD future readers have opportunity of perusing a printed copy of the MS volume of the OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE which treats of  Arabia  and  Persia  they will find that we left behind the province of  Sind  rent from the  Hindoostan  empire by the usurper  Kouli Khan  who as nature seemed to have pointed out made the mighty river of that name the boundary between the  Persian  and  Indian  dominions  THE  Sind  or the  Seindhoo  of the  Sanscrit  THE INDUS  was called by the antients  Indus  a name retained by the moderns It rises from ten streams springing remote from each other out of the  Persian  and  Tartarian  mountains one of which originates in  Cashmere  The rivers of the  Panjab  and those which rise from the west above  Candahar  and  Cabul  are the great contributory streams but the parent one seems to be that which flows out of  Cashgar  in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ N The name  Sind  is native and of great antiquity and mentioned by  Pliny  and  Arrian  as the  Indian  appellative  the one writes it  Sindus  the other  We learn by the  Nubian  Geographer that the  Arabians  call it  Mehran  I mean to proceed down to its  Delta  where it is discharged into the sea and briefly point out the most remarkable places antient or modern which occur in my course  THE  Indus  PENINSULA OF INDIA  or rather the streams which fall into it from the east particularly the  Ihylum  or river of  Cashmere  and the  Ganges  near  Latak  in Little  Thibet  to the north of  Cashmere  approximate and then run diverging till they reach the sea and peninsulate the mighty empire so that they give the name to  Hindoostan  of the Peninsula of  India India  or  Hindoostan  is not of vernacular derivation antient as it is the name  Hind  was given it by the  Persians  who transmitted it to the  Greeks  and they formed from it the word  India  for we are assured by the scientific linguist Mr  Wilkins  that no such word is to be found in the  Sanscrit  Dictionary for the aborigines of the country knew it by no other than that of  Bharata  Rennel XX and the attendant note  The discovery is new but we have preserved the antient name of  Hindoostan  given it by the  Persians  and that of  India  by the  Grecians  who gave that of  Hindoos  to the aboriginal people of the country and  Stan  a region  THIS vast peninsula was formerly divided into two parts  Hindoostan  Proper which was bounded on the south by the rivers  Nerbudda  and  Soane  and the southern borders of  Bengal  and by the  Barrampooter  on the east  THE other division is the  Deccan  which signifies the  south  and under that meaning comprehends all the rest of the peninsula as far as Cape  Comorin  This name and this division seem at present scarcely known except in the mention of the great  Soubahship  possessed by  Nizam al Muluck  and his successors  This is now greatly altered in its limits and abridged in its extent  Hindoostan  tends to a conoid form The northern part spreads into a large irregular base  Hurdwar  the most northern place in the province of  Delhi  is nearly in Lat ¬∞ Long ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ Cape  Comorin  is the most southern extremity the point in Lat ¬∞ Long ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≥ E The length therefore of this country is thirteen hundred and eighty three  British  miles the breadth at the base from  Tatta  in the  Delta  of the  Indus  to  Silhet  on the eastern extremity of  Bengal  is thirteen hundred and ninety  IT is necessary to be observed that  India  is bounded on the north by a range of most lofty mountains rocky and frequently precipitous and inaccessible These were the  Haemodus  and  Paropamisus  of the antients and those which are interrupted by the  Indus  forcing its way through the chain are called the  Imaus  or the snowy but the flatterers of  Alexander  in compliment to him bestowed on the western part of that outlet the name of  Caucasus  as if says  Arrian Exped Alex  p they had been a continuation of his dominions in maps they still are called the  Indian Caucasus Pliny  Lib vi c gives authority for this by saying they were  Caucasi partes  ANTIENT ROADS TO  INDIA  THE earliest notice we have of commerce with this great empire was in the book of  Genesis  Ch where we find mention of the  Ishmaelites  carrying on a trade with  Egypt  PATRIARCHAL  in spices balm and myrrh the two last might have been productions of  Arabia  or of  Gilead  but the spices were consined to  India  They travelled at that time in caravans and carried  their goods on the backs of camels in the very manner that their descendants the  Arabs  continue to do from that period They took the same route as the patriarch  Jacob  did and delivered their articles of luxury at the proud  Memphis  As soon as they became a naval people much of the commerce of  Arabia  as well as of  India  was conveyed to  Muza  ARRIAN Periplus p  a port not remote from the modern  Mocha  and from thence shipped to  Berenice  or to  Myos hormos  and placed on the backs of camels conveyed to the  Egyptian  markets But in respect to the  Ishmaelites  who had met with  Joseph  and his brethren it is highly probable that it was prior to the time of their knowlege of navigation They had therefore performed the whole journey to and from  India  by land On their return they increased their caravan by the addition of the myrrh and balm the produce of their own country or of  Gilead  which they had left not long before they met with the patriarchs at  Dotham  a place in the middle of  Palestine  not far to the west of the sea of  Tiberias  They then proceeded on their journey to  Egypt  with the addition of another article of commerce a slave in the person of  Joseph  whom they had just purchased from his envious brethren  THIS communication with  India  was carried on for a great length of time To use the authority of HOLY WRIT our safest guide on all occasions we find that SOLOMON gave it every encouragement He founded  Hamath  in the country of  Galilee  and  Tadmor  in the wilderness or  Palmyra  and many other  cities of store  KINGS I Ch V CHRON II Ch V  or  emporia  for the commerce of  India  and  Tyre Sidon  and all the surrounding nations  I SHALL now mention the route for which the ancients were indebted to the  Macedonian  hero who after passing the  paropamisan Caucasus  founded a city on the southeast side of the  Ghergistan  mountains or  Hindoo Kho  or the  Indian Caucasus  and called it  Alexandria  in honor of himself  ALEXANDRIA  Alexander  passed this way in his pursuit of  Bessus  and returned by the same road on his invasion of  India  It is probable that  Alexandria  was founded on the first expedition in order to secure his return into a country the conquest of which he had so much at heart According to Mr  Rennel  it appears to have been in Lat ¬∞ opposite to the modern  Bamian  which stands on the northwest side of  Caucasus  Here according to  Quintus Curtius  lib vii c he left seven thousand old  Macedonian  soldiers and a number worn out in the service  Arrian  I p says that he appointed  Proexes  a noble  Persian  Governor and  Niloxenus  Commissary of the army  Alexandria  continued long an  emporium  of the goods of  India  the termination of the commercial views of the  Europeans  till it was superseded by the rise of  Candahar  and  Cabul  It seems to have had to it two roads the one direct and the same with the course taken by  Alexander  in his way from the  Caspian  sea to his pursuit of  Bessus  and his  Indian  conquest through  Aria  the modern  Herat  HERAT  which was till the latter ages a place of great strength and great commercial note In course of ages it suffered all the calamities to which the cities of the east are peculiarly incident but it often emerged  Abdulkurreem  A noble Cashmerian who attended Kouli Khan on his return from India See p of his Memoirs  saw it in on his return in a most distressful state the very ground floors of the houses were ploughed up and sown with grain but he speaks  of the magnificent ruins which shewed its former situation The country was uncommonly rich but the whole road from  Candahar  to this city was a scene of desolation marked by the march of  Kouli Khan  on his return from  India  From  Herat  the ancients directed their course to the southern part of the  Caspian  sea This journey must have been performed by caravans of camels or horses as the road was destitute of navigable rivers The route touched on the shore where  Astrabad  now stands which perhaps was the port  THE second way and which was much frequented was towards the northwest The merchants went by  Champan Drapsica  the modern  Damian Bactra  now called  Zariaspa Nautica  the modern  Nekebad  and from that town by a short stage to  Maracunda  or  Samarcand  SAMARCAND  seated in a most beautiful valley All these cities rose and were supported by the passage of the caravans As to  Samarcand  it had long been a vast city known by the name of  Maracunda  It was garrisoned by  Alexander  the great after the capture at  Nautica  of  Bessus  the murderer of  Darius  The  Scythians  laid siege to it but it was relieved by the  Macedonian  hero It is said to have been even then a city of vast opulence strength and splendor  FROM  Samarcand  the articles of commerce were conveyed to the  Oxus  THE OXUS  the modern  Amu  which runs at no great distance to the south That famous river rises far to the southeast in the  Caucasan  chain It becomes navigable for barks at  Termed  in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ N long before it comes near  Samarcand  it is singular that so distant a route should be pursued before the commodities were embarked In the days of  El Edrisi  or the  Nubian  Geographer p we find that it was frequented on  that account the Geographer mentions  Termed  among other stations near that great river When the goods were shipped from  Samarcand  they fell down the stream which in the time of  Herodotus  passed through a marshy tract the  paludes excipientes araxem  now the  Aral  lake out of which it flowed and going southwest fell into the  Caspian  sea in the bay of  Balchan  This passage has been destroyed above two centuries ago and its ancient channel is scarcely to be traced Master  Anthonie Jenkinson  a most authentic traveller gives the following account of the cause in his travels into those parts in as related by  Purchas  see p  The water that serueth all that countrey is drawne by ditches out of the river  Oxus  vnto the great destruction of the said river for which cause it falleth not into the  Caspian  sea as it hath done in times past and in short time all that land is like to be destroyed and to become a wildernesse for want of water when the river of  Oxus  shall faile  I WILL now briefly enter on some other ways pointed out by the ancients as commercial routes into  India  OTHER ROUTES  One is that mentioned by  Pliny  lib vii c who probably speaks on good authority his account is founded on intelligence delivered down by  Pompey  when he was pursuing the  mithridatic  war It was then certainly known that it was but seven days journey out of  India  to the  Bactryan  country even to the river  Icarus  which runs into the  Oxus  by means of which the  Indian  commerce may be transported by the channel of the  Caspian  sea and again by the river  Cyrus  the modern  Kur  CASPIAN SEA  on the western side as far as  Phasis  the  Rione  or modern  Fasz  a large and navigable river which falls into the head of the  Euxine  sea and appears to me a communication of great practicability  I MAY also mention  Batnae  BATNAE  a large commercial city built according to  Ammianus  lib xiv c not remote from the  Euphrates  in  Mesopotamia  by the  Macedonians  It was filled with rich merchants an annual fair was held there in the beginning of  September  and it was then the resort of multitudes of people for the sake of the commodities brought from  India  and even  Seres  or  China  and various other places both by land and water the last by the channel of the  Persian  gulph and so up the  Euphrates  THE  Seres  reminds me of the last communication I shall mention  THE SERES  which was to the north leading to the distant country of  China  The  Chinese  merchants descended from their country and leaving the head of the desert of  Gobi  to the west reached little  Bucharia  and got the conveniency of the river  Ilak  for part of their journey  THE ancient  Comedae  COMEDAE  the same with  Cashgar  seated in Lat ¬∞ N in the  Casia Regio  of  Ptolemy  lay at the foot of mount  Imaus  The  Indian  and  Chinese  trade carried on through this city is still considerable The river  Sir  the old  Iaxartes  is not far to the west of  Cashgar  and might by its falling into lake  Aral  be an ancient channel of communication with the  Caspian  sea This city was the rendezvous even in early times of the merchants trading with the country to the north and to the south This I dare suppose was the  receptaculum  eorum qui ad  Seras  negotii causa prosisciuntur penes  Imaum  montem  of  Ptolemy  and near it to the east was the  Lithinon  Purgon  and  Turris Lapidea  of  Ammianus  Shaw's Travels p  which by the name  TURRIS LAPIDEA  could be no other than a beacon sixed on a stone tower  Hierken  to the south of  Cashgar  HIERKEN  was another celebrated mart and is still the centre of commerce between the north of  Asia India Thibet  and  Sibiria  When the merchants reached the  Indus  they fell into the tracts before described  THE  Seres  above spoken of were the inhabitants of the north of  China  remarkable for their silk which the ancients believed was combed from the leaves of trees and when steeped in water was corded and spun and after their manner wove into a web These  Seres  had some intercourse with the  Romans  for  Florus  tells us that they sent ambassadors to  Augustus  who were four years on their journey They were a most gentle race and shunned mankind yet carried on a traffic in the same manner as the western  Moors  do at present with people they never see The  Moors  go annually in caravans  SINGULAR TRAFFIC  laden with trinkets to an appointed place on the borders of  Nigritia  There they find several heaps of gold deposited by the  Negroes  against each of which the  Moors  put as many trinkets as they think of equal value and then retire If the next morning the  Negroes  approve the bargain they take the trinkets and leave the gold or else they make some deduction from the gold dust and in this manner transact the exchange without the lest instance of dishonesty on either part  Tassy's Memoirs p Tassy's account is that a commerce similar to this is carried on between a nation called the Cadensis and the Negroes The Cadensis act as the middle man between them and the Tunisians who go to their country and obtain gold and negro slaves for European commodities    Candahar  CANDAHAR  seated in Lat ¬∞ o‚Ä≤ N Long ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ E is the capital of a recent kingdom formed by the convulsion given to this part of the eastern world It was founded by  Ahmed Abdalla  an  Afghan  prince compelled by  Kouli Khan  to join his army in On the assassination of the tyrant he appeared again among his subjects and added to his dominions  Candahar Cashmere  and some other small districts His successors reside at  Cabul  he has an army of two hundred thousand men once clothed with  British  manufactures which were sent up the  Indus  and thence to  Cabul  by the lesser river  Candahar  is a city of vast strength by nature as well as art being seated amidst fens and rocks The Governor  Hossein Khan  defended it eighteen months against all the attacks of  Kouli Khan  At length reduced to extremity he sallied out at the head of his men and fell bravely fighting in defence of his country  Candahar  and  Cabul  were considered of high importance in a political light The first was esteemed the gate of  India  in respect to  Persia  and  Cabul  that in respect to  Tartary  and both were in the middle ages the great  emporia  for  Indian  goods which were transported into Western  Tartary  and from thence by the  Caspian  and  Euxine  seas to  Constantinople  and from that city to all parts of  Europe Candahar  was the magazine of the  Indian  and  Persian  goods and  Cabul  of the spices They were conveyed in caravans northwestwards to the famous city of  Samarcand  in Lat ¬∞ N and from thence the goods were put in boats and sent down into the  Oxus  or  Amu  which falls into the  Caspian  sea as I have before related and there shipped for their different destinations those for  Russia  up the  Volga  those for  Constantinople  up the river  Cyrus  the modern  Kur  which descends a great and rapid river from mount  Caucasus  and is navigable very far up so as to form an easy communication with the  Euxine  sea  Venice  and  Genoa  received the  Indian  luxuries from  Constantinople  and their own port of  Caffa  and dispersed them over the other parts of  Europe  BOTH these cities continue the  emporia  of  Persia India Tartary  and all the circumjacent nations The commerce is still considerable notwithstanding it has been lessened by that of the  European  nations who have established factories in almost every part of the  Indian  empire  Cabul  is seated in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ N Long ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ E  CABUL  at the foot of the  Indian Caucasus  and in so happy a climate as to produce the fruits of both the temperate and torrid zones notwithstanding it is bordered by mountains capped with eternal snow The  Indian  historians speak of it in the most rapturous terms It stands on the river  Kameh  which falls into the  Indus  at  Attock  but possibly is interrupted by rapids as it is only navigable by rafts  Cabul  is the residence of the Kings of  Candahar  and the present capital The  Nubian  Geographer p speaks of  Cabul  as a noble city that its mountains abounded with the sinest aromatic woods  Neregil  and  Myrobalans  the first may be  Nellila Phylanthus emblica  the others the  Spondias purpurea  c All the  Myrobalans  had once a name in our shops as gentle purgatives among other purposes they are used in the tanning business  OF late days  Cabul  has been noted for its vast fairs of horses and cattle the first brought there by the  Ushec Tartars  Slaves are also a considerable article of commerce Merchants resort to these markets from  Persia China  and  Tartary  It was taken  by  Kouli Khan  by storm who put great part of the garrison to the sword and made himself master of a vast treasure in arms ammunition and jewels  Kouli Khan  shewed here a strong specimen of oriental justice by ripping up the bellies of eighty  Kuzzlebash  or soldiers for only being present when some of their comrades forced one of the country women  THE  Genoese  CAFFA  those once enterprizing people made themselves masters of  Caffa  a noted city and port on the  Euxine  sea in the famous peninsula of  Krim Tartary  This they seized in and made the  emporium  of the commodities of  India  and  Persia  which were brought down the  Oxus  and the other routes mentioned in the preceding page They colonized  Caffa  with their own countrymen and gained prodigious wealth during the time they were in possession It was wrested from them in by  Mahomet  the great and with it soon expired the mighty power of that city of merchants  Genoa  for centuries the rival of  Venice  equally potent and equally brave waged long and fierce wars with each other incited more by avarice than the ambition of glory  Bochara  BOCHARA  not far to the south of  Samarcand  was another great  emporium  and communicated the eastern articles to all the neighbouring parts of  Tartary  It traded with  India China  and  Persia  and partook of those of  Muscovy  by the caravans which went from that empire to  Cathay  This city seems to have been of more modern date it is not mentioned as far as I recollect before the days of the  Nubian  Geographer who wrote some time prior to the year but it appears to have been in the next century a most flourishing place  Anthonie Jenkinson Purchas  iii gives a very curious account of the state of  Bochara  and its commerce as it was in the year This has been uninterruptedly continued from the earliest time to the present for the northern parts of  Asia  have their wants and luxuries to supply even from  India  and  China  The discovery of the passage by the Cape of  Good Hope  gave a great check to this inland commerce No more commodities were conveyed that way to the greatest part of  Europe  yet still the trade is very considerable to the places I mentioned and even to the  Russian  empire  Catherine  has as yet no share in  Hindoostan  no  Indian  fleets her splendid courts and all the luxuries of her vast cities are supplied either from  Astrakan  or from the other  Caspian  ports  Astrakan  is the great  Russian  staple of the  Indian  commerce  Gurjef  and  Kislar  are the same  Persia  has its  Derbend Niezabad Baku  and others The  Tartars  have their bay of  Balchan  and  Mangushlak  through which  Bochara  still pours its  Indian  articles of commerce It is foreign to the plan of  outline  to enter into  minutiae  I must therefore refer to the second Volume of my friend the Reverend  Wm Coxe  's valuable Travels The th Chapter will satisfy the most ardent curiosity  In respect to the antient  Russian  commerce with these distant parts  RUSSIAN COMMERCE  I shall conclude the subject with observing that after the various commodities of  India  had arrived through the channel of the  Oxus  into the  Caspian  sea they were shipped for the  Volga  the  Rha  of the antients That river was so little known to the antients that they have not left us the name of a single place in its whole course The merchants ascended that great river After navigating it a very considerable way they entered  the  Kama  and arrived through the  Kokra  at  Tcherdyn  seated in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ North in those early times a mighty  emporium  From thence the several eastern articles of commerce were dispersed over all the  arctic  regions The  Nortmans  and the  Sueons  people of the  Baltic  had great intercourse with them through the  Nova  and  Ladoga  another vast  emporium  seated on the lake of the same name As a proof of the antiquity of its commerce coins of  Greece  and  Rome  of  Syria  and  Arabia  have been found in the antient burying places evidences that the people of the east and of the west had met there to supply their several wants even at  Tcherdyn  coins of the  Arabian Caliphs  have been discovered Notwithstanding the immense wealth of both  Tcherdyn  and  Ladoga  scarcely a trace is to be seen of those great  emporia  The commerce of the first extended even within the  artic  circle The  Beormas  the people of the old  Permia  ascended the  Petzora  with their furs exchanged them for the products of the torrid zones and falling down that northern river dispersed them over all their chilly regions  THE MARCH OF  ALEXANDER  TO THE  PANJAB  I INTRODUCE again the  Paropamisan Alexandria  No place could be fixed on with greater judgment whether as a  place d'armes  or an  emporium  of the mighty empire he designed from which he could form the vast commerce he meditated for in his lucid intervals a more able monarch never existed As from a head quarter from hence he directed his expedition to  Bactra  and  Sogdiana  the modern countries of  Balk Bucharia  and  Samarcand  Having fulfilled the objects of his march he returned and from this place set forth on his great design the conquest of  India  I will attend his march across the country to the banks of the  Indus  THE conqueror took a northeastern course and passed by the tract of the modern towns of  Killaut Tazee Meerout Jomrood  and  Gundermouk  He crossed several rivers in his way such as the  Cophenes  or  Cow river  or  Nagaz  and the  Choe  which falls into the  Guraeus  or modern  Kameh  On the upper part of the  Cophenes  which is called  Dilen  stood  Ghizni  GHIZNI  once the capital of a mighty empire of the same name which consisted of the tract lying between the  Indus  and  Parthia  to the south of the  Oxus  and part of the antient  Bactria  The city is now a heap of ruins and scarcely mentioned in history Its emperor  Mahmood  I surnamed  Ghizni  first invaded  India  in the year his first conquests extends only to  Moultan  He in conquered the kingdom of  Guzerat  at that time all  Hindoostan  was inhabited by the aborigines With true  Mahometan  zeal he exercised all sorts of barbarities against the  Hindoos  and in order if possible to exterminate their religion levelled with the ground their favorite Pagoda  Sumnaut  and every other object of their worship The  Ghiznian  empire continued years  Mahomed  began his reign in and it became extinct in  THE city of  Attock  stands opposite to the junction of the  Kameh  with the  Indus  In the district of  Bijore  not remote from hence stood the  Aornos Petra  and inaccessible mountain  AORNOS PETRA  towering into a conical form with a castle on its summit which gave so much trouble to  Alexander  and which he took merely  by an unexpected panic of the garrison M  D'Anville  supposes it to have been the modern  Renas  situated in about Lat ¬∞ North Our countryman the gallant Captain  John Jones  in mastered by open storm  Dellamcotta  a fort equally strong and seated in a manner equally singular amidst the  Boutan  mountains  AMIDST the savage mountains of  Sewad  and  Bijore  OFFSPRING OF THE MACEDONIANS  inhabits a tribe who assert that they are descended from some of the followers of  Alexander  the Great who were left behind when he passed through the country possibly the garrison of  Alexandria  and of the other garrisons he left behind might also contribute to this mixt species of population The tribe of  Sultani  assumes the honor of being the descendants of a daughter of that conqueror who came from  Cabul  and possessed this country and to this day carry with them their pedigree  Abul Fazul ii  They call their great ancestor  Sultan Secunder Z√ªlkerman  which Mr  Rennel  p observes should be printed  Zul Kernine  or the  twohorned  This is certainly a most remarkable allusion to the prophecy of  Isaiah  viii in which  Alexander  the Great is foretold under the description of the  Goat  with this difference only that they double the number of the horn with which he had destroyed the power of the  Persians  and the  Medes  See Rollin's Antient Hist vi    Taxila  stood on  TAXILA  or near the spot where the city  Attock  now stands Here  Alexander  crossed the  Indus  on a bridge of boats which his favorite  Hephestion  had some time before been sent to prepare In the famous  Timur Beg  or  Tamerlane  passed this river on one of the same kind In our days  Kouli  Khan  who may complete the sanguinary triumvirate crossed the  Indus  at  Attock  in the same manner This by reason of the great rapidity of the stream in all other parts was fixed on as the most convenient place which long after induced the emperor  Akbar  to build the castle of  Attock  for its defence against similar invasions  OPPOSITE to  Attock  stood a very antient city the  Nilaube  of  Ptolemy  This place is mentioned by two of the oriental historians quoted by Major  Rennel  p under the name of  Nilab  by which the river  Indus  itself was generally known by the old writers  Plin lib v c Arrian Exped Alex i    Alexander  after succeding in his passage  PANJAB  got clear of the mountains and arrived in the rich plains of  Panjab  or the  Five Rivers  each immortalized by being a great scene of action of the  Macedonian  hero The  Hydaspes  the modern  Behut  or  Chelum  the  Acesines  or  Jenaub  or  Cheenaub  and the  Hydraotes  or modern  Rauvee  all which after a long course unite in one channel which retains the name of  Cheenaub  and after the junction passes through the country of the  Oxydracae  beneath the north side of  Moultan  and at the distance of about twenty miles from that city falls into the  Indus  about two hundred miles below  Attock  in magnitude equal to the  Indus  itself  ON the banks of the  Hydraotes  stood the city of the  Malli  MALLI  who with the  Oxydracae  after a most gallant resistance made submission to  Alexander  In the same neighborhood stood the site now unknown  Sangala  inhabited by the  Cathaei  of  Arrian  ii  Exped Alex  and the  Catheri  of  Diodorus Siculus  Lib xvii c    They are supposed to have been the same with the valiant cast the  Khatre  to this day renowned for their desperate valour  Alexander  besieged them in their city their defence was brave and obstinate but they fell before the fortune of the  Macedonian  hero who destroyed the nation and levelled their city with the ground A nameless city as Mr  Rennel  styles it was to be found higher up the river on the opposite side This deserved to have been immortalized as having been the place where that hero endangered his life by one of the rash actions he was very subject to fall into  ALEXANDER WOUNDED  He leaped into the city was beset by enemies and received a desperate wound in his side by an arrow which had transfixed his breastplate He fainted but recovered the moment he felt an  Indian  going to strip him and drawing a dagger pierced his assailant to the heart I leave the reader to consult  Arrian Exped Alex  i about the event and Mr  Rennel  p as to reasons for fixing the site of the momentous affair in the place he does about ten miles above the conflux of the two rivers  GOLD is found in some of the rivers of  Panjab  GOLD  In respect to gold we are informed by  Herodotus  THALIA c that the  Indians  paid their tribute to  Darius  in that pretious metal and tells us that it is procured out of the rivers and also dug out of the earth and smelted by them into ingots before they make with it their donative One of the epithets the Poets bestow on the  Hydaspes  is  Aurifer  possibly as being peculiarly rich in gold  Herodotus Thalia  c relates and seems to credit the strange story of its particles being thrown up with the sand of the vast desert probably that of  Registan  by ants as big as foxes and that the  Indians  went with three camels to collect the grains which  they found in the hillocks As soon as they had filled their bags they returned with all possible expedition to avoid the fury of the ants which pursued them with incredible swiftness It is reasonable to suppose that the historian had heard of the monstrous nests of the  Termites  or  white Ants  which his informants thought proper to stock with most monstrous inhabitants  ON the banks of the  Hydaspes  was fought the decisive battle between  Alexander  and the  Indian  monarch  Porus  BATTLE WITH PORUS  both equal in valour but the former by his great superiority in the art of war obtained a complete victory with a handful of men  Porus  employed not fewer than two hundred elephants which terrific as they might have been to the  Macedonian  horses were with their garrisoned towers totally destroyed by the victorious army  I CANNOT resist the introduction into this place of the following curious anecdotes of the two famous Monarchs  PERSIAN HISTORY OF  as communicated to me by Major  Ouseley  the ingenious author of the  Persian  miscellanies He informs me that two  Persian  writers mention the invasion of  Hindoostan  by  Alexander  the great  Ferdusi  in his  Shah Nameh  or Chronicle of Kings written about the latter end of the th century and beginning of the th and  Nezami  another celebrated poet who flourished in the th The first enumerates the various troops of  Persia Greece  and  India  and the camel loads of presents which  Alexander  received from  Keid  the  Indian  Prince  Nezami  in his  Skander Nameh  or History of  Alexander  says that forty elephants were loaden with the various productions of the country among which several carried  Indian  steel  Porus  is mentioned under the name of  Four  The poet adds he brought two thousand elephants into the field which by a contrivance of  Aristotle Alexander  's Secretary were completely routed and  Four  himself  killed by  Alexander  who found in his castle of  Canooge  immense treasures  ON the banks of this river  NICOEA AND BUCEPHALA  opposite to each other he built on the bloody scene two cities  Nicoea  and  Bucephala Nicoea  so named from the victory the last in honor of his celebrated horse which died of old age at the time of this action  Alexander  gratefully paid it the highest funeral honors erected a magnificent sepulchre and called the city after its name  I SHALL not trace the sieges battles and slaughters of this ambitious character of his marches and his passages over the rivers that form this part of the  Panjab  but leave my readers to consult his original historians  Arrian  and  Quintus Curtius  It is very certain the hero did not amidst his deeds of arms neglect the study of natural history It is well known that he caused every species objects of that science to be collected for the use of his Tutor  Aristotle Q Curtius  relates some few remarks on the  zoology  of the neighborhood He met here with the  Rhinoceros  RHINOCEROS c c  with the great Serpent  Boa constrictor Gm Lin  iii with parrots or birds which could speak and with great flocks of wild peacocks  Aelian  in his  Hist An  lib v c relates that the conqueror was so struck with their beauty that he forbad his soldiers from killing them under the heaviest penalties  Psittacus  is a name derived from  Sillace  the  Indian  word for a parrot  Linnaus Gm Linn  i gives to one species long known the trivial of the  Maccdonian  hero  Psittacus Alexandri  as if in honor of the species discovered by his admiral  Nearchus  THE same great officer mentions also the vast spotted serpents  THE BOA  which he says were about sixteen cubits long  Arrian  i  Rev Indic  His veracity has been called in question but since  the  Aristotelian  cubit is little more than an  English  foot and a half we may give full credit to his having seen a serpent of the length he gives or one of twentyfour feet The antients are often abused for their credulity but let me remark that incredulity is more frequently the offspring of ignorance than the former At this time instances may be adduced of species from twenty to thirtysix feet in length in  Hindoostan Ceylon Java  and several other islands  Bontius  p a most respectable writer bears witness to the existence of some of thirtysix feet being found in  Java  AMONG the trees the  Ficus Indica  FICUS INDICA  the  Varinga Latifolia  of  Rumphius  could not fail engaging his attention which formed a grove of itself by the rooting of its pendulous branches  THE mountains bordering on the  Hydaspes  were part of the  Cachemerian  chain clothed with forests of trees of vast height and size He committed to the care of certain officers the falling the timber and floating it down the river to the place he had appointed for the rendezvous of the vessels which he had used in his expeditions up the other rivers At this place which was between the forks of the  Indus  and  Acesines  he founded another  Alexandria  ANOTHER ALEXANDRIA  and there formed his docks and ship yard He built several new ships rebuilt and repaired others and with a fleet which consisted of eighty  Triremes  or ships with three banks of oars and with lesser vessels probably collected from the several rivers of the country in all amounting to two thousand of different kinds he fell down the  Hydaspes  On his arrival at the junction of that river with the  Acesines  which preserves its name till it is lost in the greater river his navy underwent the utmost danger by the violent collision of the two waters Several  of his ships were dashed to pieces and himself and his admiral  Nearchus  with difficulty escaped The sides and channel are filled with rocks and  Alexander  through ignorance of the climate of  India  undertook his expedition in the rainy season which besides the swelling of the rivers which impeded his march made dreadful havoke among his troops by the diseases of the country  THE other two rivers which complete the  Panjab  are the  Beyah  once the  Beypasha  and the  Hyphasis  of  Alexander  The fifth and last is the  Setlege  or  Suttuluz  the  Zaradruz  of  Ptolemy  and  Hesudrus  of  Pliny  These rise in the mountains that divide  Thibet  from  India  and unite near  Firosepour  Soon after which they divide and insulate a pretty considerable tract into several islands then reunite and turning southerly fall into the  Indus  fiftythree miles below the mouth of the  Chenaub  according to Mr  Rennel  's great map Between the insulated part and the  Hydraotes  was the seat of the  Malli  and the  Catheri  objects of the destructive ambition of  Alexander  who in his expedition against those people seemed more intent on slaughter than useful conquest It was on the banks of the  Hyphasis  says  Quintius Curtius  that the hero joined his forces with those of  Hephestion  after each had performed some bloody exploit Here he concluded his expedition and after the display of his vanity by erecting twelve altars near the junction of the  Hyphasis  and  Hesudrus  commenced his voyage down the  Indus  The altars were equal in height to the loftiest towers of war On these he performed sacrisices after the manner of his country He then entertained the  Indians  with athletic and equestrian games and concluded with investing the vanquished  Porus  with the sovereignty of the whole country as far as the  Hyphasis  DURING his stay in these parts he founded another  Alexandria  between the forks of the  Indus  and  Acesines  The modern name of the place seems by Mr  Rennel  's map to be  Veh  IT does not appear that ever he saw the  Hesudrus  which according to  Pliny  was a discovery of  Seleucus Nicator  one of his ablest officers and his successor in part of his dominions and particularly of those between the  Euphrates  and the  Indus  He seems to have succeeded also to the ambition of his master for he meditated the conquest of  India  or at lest of reconquering those provinces beyond the  Indus  subdued by  Alexander  but which soon after his retreat were recovered by  Sandracotta  SANDRACOTTA  an  Indian  of mean birth but who by his abilities had rendered himself master of all  India Seleucus  found this new monarch so very powerful that he did not venture to attack him He entered into a treaty with him and agreed to retire on condition  Sandracotta  would supply him with five hundred elephants and thus covered his disgrace with a specious pretence  Alexander  began his voyage down the  Indus  about the end of the month of  October  and was nine months in the completion not from the difficulty of navigation for it might have been performed in a very short time but from his ambitious rage of conquest and slaughter on each side of the river His army marched divided in two parts on the eastern and western banks ready to execute his orders attended by his vast fleet  ONE motive to this voyage was a suspicion  Alexander  had entertained that he had found out the head of the  Nile  and  that this was no other than the celebrated river of  Egypt  because he saw in it crocodiles and beans the  Nymphoea Nelumbo  of  Linnaeus  similar to those of that kingdom  Arrian  adds that  Alexander  had even written to his mother an account of his discovery  IN our way down the stream we find among the  Sogdi  another  Alexandria  founded on the site of the royal residence of their monarch the modern  Bekhor  or  Bakhor  in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≥  WE afterwards come down to  Sindomana  SINDOMANA  the capital of the  Sindomanni  possibly it took the name from the tract being possessed of a considerable manufactory of  Sindones  or fine cloths  being the name applied to certain kinds the produce of the  Indian  looms I must not call them linens for I understand that  India  produces no sort of  Linum  or flax It appears by  Arrian  MUSICANUS  to have been in the dominions of a prince called  Musicanus  and that it opened its gates to  Alexander  on his passage down the  Indus Musicanus  had deserted that hero who caused him to be crucified and all the  Brachmins  he could find to be put to death as our  Edward  I did the  Welsh  bards for the same reason supposing the enthusiastic songs of both to have inspired their countrymen to the defence of their country against the ambitious invaders  THE next antient place of note is the  Prasiane insula  of  Pliny  PRASIANE INSULA  formed by the dividing of the  Indus  About twelve miles below stood  Mansura  a city mentioned by the  Nubian  Geographer p That town was the ancient  Minnagara  of  Arrian  ii  Mar Eryth  Its port was the  Barbaricum emporium  of the same  IMPORTS  near the most western mouth of the  Indus  Here were brought in ships from different places quantities of plain vestments  and a few colored also  Polymitae  or embroideries  Chrysolites Coral Styrax  a resin the produce of the  Clutia eluteria Burm Ind  incense glass vessels sculptured silver money and a small quantity of wine all these were sent up the river to the royal residence  THE exports were  Costus  the root of the  Costus Arabicus  EXPORTS  Merian Surin  tab till of late

be mentioned  Callaina Gemma  related  Plin  lib xxxvii to the sapphire of his days Sapphirs furs from the  Seres  or northern  China  a proof of intercourse  Othonium  a certain cloth or stuff of which vast quantities were sent in particular to the great commercial port of  Barygaza  Silk in the hank or thread ready for the loom  Indicum nigrum  that is the  Indian  indigo  Rumph Amboin  v p tab  LET me here mention  INDO SCYTHIA  that all the lower and middle parts of the western boundary of the  Indus  went by the name of  Indo Scythia  The  Scythians  chiefly the  Getae  had expelled the  Greeks  who continued long after the retreat of  Alexander  and repeopled it with colonies of their own nation The  Getae  were the most brave and most just of all the  Scythians  and continued to preserve this character in their new possessions  A FEW miles lower begins the  Delta  of the  Indus  PATTALA  named after the  Egyptian  or that of the  Nile  and was called by the  Indians Pattala  which in their language signifies the same thing There is a greater and a lesser  Delta  It is near the  sea intersected by numbers of unnavigable channels and creeks The isles formed by these were the  Insulae  solis of  Mela  lib ii c  contra Indi  ostia "fatal" says he  to all that enter them by reason of the violent heat of the air  There is not at present in all  India  a place more fatal to  Europeans Pattala  was the first  Indian  emporium frequented by the  Romans  but the passage from the  Red  sea was greatly infested with pirates for which reason the ships always took on board a certain number of archers for their defence  Plin Nat Hist lib vi c    THE tide comes up with a vast  bore  or head  VAST TIDES  and is very dangerous at certain times to vessels which are in its way The fleet of  Alexander  when he had arrived near the mouth of the river was surprized with one of these  bores  and lost great numbers of ships Those which lay on the sand banks were swept away by the fury of the tide those which were in the channel on the mud received no injury but were set afloat  Arrian i p p Exped Alex    THE mention of this occasions me to return to the conclusion of the expedition of the  Macedonian  hero When he reached  Pattala  he found the city deserted the fame of his barbarity had induced the prince who had before submitted to retire with all his subjects  Alexander  finding the necessity of repeopling the place sent out light troops who made some of the late inhabitants prisoners Those he treated with the utmost kindness dismissed them and promised them protection if they could induce their fellowcitizens to return He succeeded in his design he formed a haven and made docks in  order to refit his fleet which being accomplished he sailed down into the ocean The dangers which might occur in an unknown sea and the pressing instances made by his friends induced him to return He landed his forces and took the rout towards  Gedrosia  and at length arrived at the city of  Babylen  with the remains of his faithful army reduced by the toilsome march by famine pestilence and every calamity which his phrenetic ambition had involved it in  HE had committed the care of his fleet to  Nearchus  a man of first rate abilities who engaged to conduct it through the ocean to the  Persian  Gulph and the  Euphrates  He performed his engagement after many difficulties When he had arrived at  Harmozia  the modern  Ormus  he heard that his master was not remote He landed with a few of his companions and in five days reached the army but so squalid and miserable in their aspect that  Alexander  shocked at their appearance took  Nearchus  aside and asked Whether he had not lost his fleet On being assured of its safety he gave way to the most unbounded joy and crowned both him and  Leonnatus  with golden crowns  Nearchus  for having preserved the fleet  Leonnatus  for a victory obtained over the  Oritae  and the whole army saluted the former with flowers and garlands scattered over their celebrated admiral  Arrian i Exped Alex    I MUST not quit the historical part of the  Indus  SEMIRAMIS  without mention of the expedition undertaken by the heroine  Semiramis  many ages before that of  Alexander  Certainly historians must  greatly have exaggerated the preparations they make her army consist of three millions of foot and two hundred thousand horse and a hundred thousand chariots and multitudes of ships ready framed and carried in pieces by land to be put together in order to cross the  Indus  I suspect that these vessels were no more than so many coracles or  vitilia navigia  made of bamboos like those used by  Ayder Alli  in our days on the waters of  Malabar  In order to supply her wants of real elephants she caused a multitude of fictitious ones to be made out of the skins of three hundred thousand black oxen which were placed on camels backs guided by a man within this strange machine  STABROBATES  Stabrobates  king of  India  received advice of her preparations and by a prudent embassy endeavoured to divert her from her intentions The Queen rejected his remonstrances crossed the river and defeated the fleet of the  Indian  monarch that perhaps was not difficult notwithstanding it consisted of four thousand boats but as they were formed only of the bamboo cane they never could resist the shock of timber ships The victory proved fatal to her she succeeded in crossing the river but was deceived by the pretended flight of  Stabrobates  she pursued and overtook him the battle was fought The  Indian  monarch discovered the fictitious elephants and  Semiramis  was totally defeated She repassed the river with precipitation she lost great part of her troops and returned covered with shame into her own country So many fabulous circumstances attend this expedition that we may well doubt the veracity of the historian and possibly of the very existence of the heroine What credit as the learned  Bryant  justly observes  can be given to the historians of a person the time of whose life cannot be settled within years  LONG after this dubious expedition  Darius Hystaspes  DARIUS HYSTASPES  induced through the curiosity of ascertaining the place where the  Indus  met the ocean built says  Herodotus  in his  Melpomene  sect xliv a large fleet at  Caspatyrus  in the  Pactyan  territories on the borders of  Scythia  high up the river and gave the command of it to  Scylax  a  Grecian  of  Caryandra  a most able sailor He was directed to be attentive to discoveries on both sides and when he reached the mouth to sail westward and that way to return home He executed his commission passed the Streights of  Babel Mandel  and in thirty months from the time he sailed from  Caspatyrus  landed safely in  Egypt  at the place from whence it is said that  Necho  sent his  Phoenicians  to circumnavigate  Africa  by its now well known promontory the  Cape of Good Hope  This expedition took place in the twelfth year of  Darius  and in the year before the  Christian  aera  REVIEW OF THE  INDUS  I SHALL now give a short topographical review of the celebrated river from the ocean to its most remote part and also of the rivers which swell its stream That which receives this mighty river is the  Mare Erythroeum  or modern  Arabian  sea I have given some account of the  Delta  let me add that it is  DELTA OF THE INDUS  as it was in the time of the antients unhealthy and hot to the extreme all its fertility cannot compensate those inconveniencies There is a greater and lesser  Delta  the greater begins a  few leagues from  Hydrabad  the branch called  Nala Sunkra  forms the eastern side the lesser is included in the former and its northern point is at  Aurungabander  The  Delta  is of great extent each side being a hundred and fifteen miles From the sea as high as  Moultan  is a low and level country enriched with the water annually overflowing like the river  Nile  The  Indus  from the beginning of the  Delta  almost as high as  Moultan  runs through a flat tract bounded by a parallel range of mountains distant from the banks of the river from thirty to forty miles That on the western side is rocky that on the eastern composed of sand The last when it approaches the  Delta  conforms to its shape on the eastern side and diverges till it reaches the sea  BEYOND the eastern chain is a vast sandy desert  SANDY DESERT OF REGISTAN  extending the whole way above a hundred miles in breadth and in length reaches from near Lat ¬∞ N almost as high as the fertile  Panjab  or Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ This is the part of which  Herodotus    Thalia  c cii speaks when he says that the eastern part of  India  is rendered desert by sands  THE CAGGAR  Through it runs the river  Caggar  but the lower part with uncertain course lost in the sands of the desert and render the place of its discharge at this time very uncertain It slows from the northeast and rises in the  Damaun  chain which separates it from the distant  Jumna  and not far from the origin of that great river On its banks in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ stands  Ammercot  a strong fort the birth place of

the deserts of  Arabia  extends to the  Regislan  and even to the neighborhood of  Surat  Niebuhr Deser de l'Arabie p    THE most remarkable place we are to take notice of  BRAMINABAD  in first remounting the river is  Braminabad  once the capital of the  Circar  of  Tattah  at a small distance from  Tatta  Its name was taken from its having been sanctified by the chief residence of the  Brahmins  or perhaps where there might have been peculiar worship paid to the God  Brama  It had been the antient capital of the country and its fort was of vast extent being said to have had fourteen hundred bastions At the time of composing the  Ayeen Akberry  were considerable vestiges of this fortification It is mentioned in Vol ii p  AT  Tatta  we once had a factory  TATTA  perhaps may have to this day notwithstanding the excessive unwholesomeness of the place  There are seasons in which it does not rain during three years  Hamilton's Voy i  The heats are so violent owing to the vicinity of the sandy deserts that the houses are contrived to be ventilated occasionally by means of apertures in the tops like chimnies and when the hottest winds prevale the windows are closely shut and the hotter current excluded and the cooler part being more elevated descends through the funnels to the gasping inmates  Mr Rennel p  The object of the settlement was the sale of our broad cloths which were sent up the  Indus  to the northern parts of  India  The broad cloths and all other goods were landed at  Laribunder  a town on the  Ritchel  a branch of the  Indus  about five miles from the sea and sent to  Tatta  on the backs of camels  Hamilton  i p says that in his days it was almost depopulated by the plague which carried off eighty thousand of the inhabitants The vast extent of business carried on in the  Delta  was surprising for  Abulfazel  see  Ayeen Akberry  ii assures us that the inhabitants of the  Circar Tattah  had not less than forty thousand boats of different constructions In this city was attacked by  Francisco Bareto Rolen  viceroy of  India  Provoked by the treachery of the king of  Sind  he shewed relentless cruelty he put above eight thousand people to the sword nor did he spare the very animals He then burnt the place and with it immense riches notwithstanding this the plunder was very great all which was swallowed up by a furious tempest  Conquestes de

princes of  Sindi  who with the whole province is tributary to the king of  Candahar  We may also except the  Nomurdis  a tribe which like their ancestors the  Scythian Nomades  or shepherds are perpetually changing their place for sake of pasturage and from whom this tract took its name  Mr Rennel p Ayeen Akberry ii p    I MENTION here the imposthume of the liver  LIVER DISEASE  not as a local disease but on account of a peculiar superstition preserved in this country the  Sircar of Tatta  respecting the disorder The real cause says  Bontius  p  Engl  edit arises from intemperance an imposthume is often formed in that part and on opening it after death it is often found eaten or honeycombed The side is not unfrequently laid open to get at the part infected The impostume is cut and the liver cleansed I have heard from the credulous strange stories on this head The  Indians  of the  Sircar  firmly believe that the disease is inflicted by a set of sorcerers called  Jiggerkhars  or liver eaters  JIGGERKHARS  One of this class  says the  Ayeen Akberry  ii p  can steal away the liver of another by looks and incantations Other accounts say that by looking at a person he deprives him of his senses and then steals from him something resembling  the seed of a pomegranate and which he hides in the calf of his leg  THE  Jiggerkhar  throws on the fire the grain before described which thereupon spreads to the size of a dish and he distributes it amongst his fellows to be eaten which ceremony concludes the life of the fascinated person A  Jiggerkhar  is able to communicate his art to another and which he does by learning him the incantations and by making him eat a bit of the liver cake If any one cut open the calf of the magician's leg extract the grain and give it to the afflicted person to eat he immediately recovers These  Jiggerkhars  are mostly women It is said moreover that they can bring intelligence from a great distance in a short space of time and if they are thrown into a river with a stone tied to them they nevertheless will not sink In order to deprive any one of this wicked power they brand his temples and every joint in his body cram his eyes with salt suspend him for forty days in a subterraneous cavern and repeat over him certain incantations In this state he is called  Detcherch  Although after having undergone this discipline he is not able to destroy the liver of any one yet he retains the power of being able to discover another  Jiggerkhar  and is used for detecting those disturbers of mankind They can also cure many diseases by administering a potion or by repeating an incantation  Many other marvellous stories are told of these people  THE  Delta  has not on it a tree but in the dry parts is covered with brush wood In the time of  Abul Fazel  the inhabitants  hunted here the wild ass or  Koulan  Hist Quad i p The same author assures us that the camels were so numerous  CAMELS  that several of the inhabitants were possessed of herds of ten thousand each a number exceeding the stock of the patriarch JOB on the return of his prosperity Multitudes of camels still are bred on this tract the rest consists of noisome swamps or muddy lakes The  Ritchel  branch is the usual way to  Tatta  as high as the lake reaches it is a mile broad at  Tatta  only half a mile The tide does not run higher than that city or about sixtyfive miles from the sea  Bakhor  is an antient city and fortress in its neighborhood  BAKHOR  on the banks were observed by a modern traveller who went up the river as far as that city several of the moveable towns built of wood such as are mentioned by  Nearchus  and in the  Ayeen Akberry  They are inhabited by fishermen or graziers who constantly change their situation like persons encamped There were other towns says  Arrian Rer Indic  i p on the higher grounds and consisted of houses built with bricks and mortar Beyond  Bakhor  on the eastern bank of the  Indus  are  Dary  and  Ken  and  Bibigundycheck  and  Sitpour  each known to us only by name  IN Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ on the eastern side of the  Indus  THE STTLEGE  we meet with the conflux of the  Setlege  or  Hesudrus  with that river The town of  Veh  is at the forks It is remarkable that it is the only river we meet with from the discharge of the  Indus  into the sea to this place a tract of above five hundred and twenty miles It is the southern boundary of the  Panjah  PANJAB  or the region of five rivers so much celebrated for the bloody actions  within its limits by the destroyers of mankind  Alexander  the great  Timur Bek  or  Tamerlane  and  Kouli Khan  It is a most fertile tract often plain but towards the north and northeast intersected by a chain of hills The  Setlege  runs in one channel for some way then divides and embracing a considerable island reunites for a short space and at  Ferosapour  separates again The southern branch retains its name the northern assumes that of the  Beyah  or  Hyphasis  These diverge considerably from each other then converge so as almost to meet at their fountains at the foot of mount  Imaus  or  Himmaleh  This tract is called  Jallindar  and has in it  Sultanpour  and a few other towns  NEAR the fountain of the  Beyah  stands the famous temple of NAGERKOTE  NAGERKOTE  greatly frequented by the  Hindoo  pilgrims out of veneration to the goddess  Noshabo  This place outmiracles all miracles cut out your tongue and in a few days sometimes a few hours it will with due faith in the saint be again renewed  Ayeen ii p  This temple was immensely rich being paved with gold It was guarded by the fort  Kote Kangrah  It was taken by  Ferose  III in  Ferishta i p  To such a patron of literature he found a treasure in a library of books of the  Brahmins  He caused one which consisted of philosophy to be translated in the  Persian  language and called it the  Arguments of Ferose Goropim  as quoted by  Purchas  vi p says that  Nagerkote  mountain is the highest in the world  NOT far from  Nagerkote  JELLAMOOKY  is  Jellamooky  a temple built over the subterraneous fire Possibly the country may be inhabited  by the  Ghebres  or worshippers of fire or  Persees  descendants of those who had escaped the horrid massacre of  Timur Bek  ABOUT fiftyfive miles above the discharge of the  Setlege  THE CHUNAUB  the  Chunaub  or  Acesines  joins itself with the  Indus  and continues a single channel about the same space equal in size to that river On the southern banks nearly midway stands  Moultan  MOULTAN  capital of a province of that name The country is very productive in cotton and also sugar opium brimstone galls and camels which used to be transported into  Persia  The galls indicate oaks which I did not before know grew so far to the south The finest bows are made in this country and it produces the most beautiful and most active female dancers in all  India  who were in the highest esteem particularly in the kingdom of  Persia  THE air is excessively hot and very little rain falls in these parts This is a circumstance which attends remarkably the lower part of the  Indus  especially the  Delta  where it has been known to have wanted rain for the space of three years  THE city of  Moultan  stands in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ is small and strongly fortified It has a celebrated pagoda a mosque with a beautiful minaret and the place of interment of many pious  Shiekhs Abulfazel  ii says that it is one of the most antient cities in  India  It was not the capital of the  Malli  which Mr  Rennel  supposes to have been near  Toulumba  but they inhabited the circumjacent country  Moultan  was taken by one of the generals of  Tamerlane  Since the ravages made in this province after the invasion of  India  by  Kouli Khan  a conqueror equally barbarous the trade  of the place has received a considerable check  Thevenot  adds another reason that in his time about the year the river was choaked up which obstructed greatly all commerce from  Lahore  and other places to the northeast  THIS city is the great residence of the  Banians  BANIANS  or merchants and brokers of  India  They are of this country and have here their chieftain They are of the great commercial cast of the  Bhyse  created say the  Hindoos  by their  Brimhas  or Supreme Being from his thighs and belly but I shall say more of the CASTS hereafter These form settlements in all the commercial towns in  India  They also send colonies for a certain number of years to the trading towns of  Arabia  and  Persia  and we find them even as far as  Astrakan  In the beginning of the present century about a hundred and fifty or two hundred of this community went from  Moultan  to that city and carry on a great trade in pretious stones they live in a large stone  Caravansery  As they die away or incline to return home a supply is sent from  India  by their chief selected from among their young unmarried relations As they have no females from their own country they keep during their residence at  Astrakan Tartarian  women but the contract is only during that time They are a sine race of men and are highly esteemed for the integrity of their dealings  Communicated to me by Dr PALLAS  These support the most important trade of  Astrakan  by carrying it through  Astrabad  to the inland parts of the  Mogul  empire This points out a more southern inland road than was known in the middle ages when the merchants went by the way of  Bochara  and  Samarcand  to the northern cities of  India Candahar  and  Cabul  AT the distance of about sixty miles from its mouth the  Chenauh  divides into two branches which flow from the northwest from their origin at the foot of the  Himmaleh  chain The most southern is the  Rauvee  the old  Hydraotes  THE RAUVEE  About twentyfour miles from its mouth on the southern side stand the fort and town of  Toulamba  They lay in the route of  Tamerlane  TOULAMBA  and were plundered and the inhabitants enslaved by that monster of cruelty justly called in  India  the destroying Prince  He excelled even his brother hero  Alexander  in the slaughter of mankind  Tamerlane  in his march into  India  had collected above a hundred thousand prisoners these happened to shew some symptoms of joy at a repulse the tyrant had received before the citadel of  Delhi  he instantly ordered all above fifteen years of age to be massacred in cold blood The sum was a hundred thousand  THE city of  Lahore  is next  LAHORE  about a hundred and fifty miles distant from  Moultan  It is the capital of the  Seiks  a people which started up in the fifteenth century under a  Hindoo  of the name of  Nanuck  born in They are a set of religionists tolerant in matters of faith like the  Hindoos  but unlike them  THE SEIKS  admit proselytes They require a conformity in certain signs and ceremonies but in other respects are pure monotheists they worship God alone without image or intermediation They may be called the reformers of  India  They retain also a  calvinistical  principle and take an oath ever to oppose a monarchical government They eat any kind of meat excepting beef for like the  Hindoos  they hold the ox in the utmost veneration Their general food is pork probably because it is forbidden by  the  Mahometans  whom they hold in abhorrence Their army consists wholly of horse they can raise a hundred thousand cavalry and make war in the most savage mode They kept long concealed or unnoticed at length became formidable by their courage and enterprize and extended their conquests over  Lahore Moultan  and the western parts of  Delhi  Lahore  is a city of great antiquity and was the residence of the first  Mahometan  conquerors in  India  before they were established in the central parts In in the reign of  Mahmood  it was closely besieged by the confederated  Hindoos  who were compelled to retire on a vigorous sally made by the garrison It is also a Soubaliship of considerable extent  Humaioon  father of  Akbar  kept his court here part of his days Its length suburbs included was at that period three leagues It had a magnificent palace and several other fine buildings built of brick Possibly its trade is declined since the obstruction of the bed of the river by the banks of sand or gravel Here begins the famous avenue which extended five hundred miles even to  Agra  It consists according to  Thevenot  Part iii p of what he calls  Achy  trees It was planted in by  Jehang√¨r  He also erected an obelisk at the end of every  cose  and at the end of every third  cose  was sunk a well for the refreshment of travellers  THE pestilence first appeared in the  Panjab  in  PESTILENCE  spread to  Lahore  and then broke out in the  Duab  and  Dehli  It never before was known in  Hindoostan  if the memoirs of  Jehang√¨r  are to be depended on but Mr  Gibbon  iv assures us that the dreadful plague which depopulated the earth in the time of  Justinian  and his successors extended even to the  Indies  The people whom it raged among at this time according to  Procopius Bell Pers  lib ii cap were the  Barbari  or inhabitants of the neighborhood of the  Emporium Barbaricum  in the  Delta  of the  Indus  D' Anville Antiq Geogr de l' Inde p  Doctor  Mead  in his elegant treatise  de Peste  p relates that  India  was visited with a pestilence in whether it was the same with that which from the earliest times took its origin between the  Serbonian  bog and the eastern channel of the  Nile  or whether it might not have been the dysentery or bloody flux is uncertain  Bontius  Bontius Lib iii Obs  has discussed the point and given his opinion that it is the latter which at times carries off numbers equal to the plague itself Certainly there have been many instances of some dreadful disease carrying its terrors through  Hindoostan  but distinction must be made between the WIDE WASTING PESTILENCE described by  Procopius  and the local disease the consequence of famine such for example as that which has raged in the northern  Circars  within these very few years  THE province of  Lahore  is celebrated for its fine breed of horses  FINE HORETS  The  Mogul  Emperors used to establish studs in different parts and furnish them with their lamed stallions of the  Persian  and  Arabian  kind for the farther improvement It was the north of  India  which supplied them with the best cavalry I wish the reader to consult  Abulfazel  i relative to the magnificent establishment of the domestic stables and the oeconomy of the military cavalry in the time of his great master  Abulfazel  ii speaking of the rivers of this country says  METALS  that the natives by washing the sands obtain Gold Silver  Copper  Rowey  Tin Brass and Lead  Rowey  is unknown to me brass is factitious I am doubtful as to some of these metals being found in  India  Farther enquiry may ascertain the metallic productions of  India  in the course of this volume  A VAST mountain of rock salt is found in this province  ROCK SALT  equal to that of  Cardonna  and like the salt of that mountain is cut into dishes plates and stands for lamps Ice is an article of commerce from the northern mountains and sold at  Lahore  throughout the year  THE famous canal of  Shah Nehr  begins at  Ragipour  and is continued almost parallel to the  Rauvee  and ends at  Lahore  a distance of above eighty miles The intent of this canal seems to have been to supply  Lahore  with water in the dry season when all the  Indian  rivers are from twenty to thirty feet below the level of their banks Three other canals for the purpose of watering the country on the south and east of  Lahore  were drawn from the same place These formed in a distant age are strong proofs of attention to rural oeconomy and the benefit of the subject  THE  Chunaub  CHUNAUB UPPER  for a few miles is continued from its forks in a single channel Near  Zusserabad  the  Jhylum  or  Behut  falls into it with vast rapidity and violence This was the place where  Alexander  so nearly lost his fleet in the passage through this turbulent conflux The  Chunaub  flows in a strait channel from the foot of the  Himmaleb  or  Imaus  and there originates from two streams which quickly reunite  Gujerat  and  Jummoo  and  Mundal  are town and forts on its banks From the origin of the  Chunaub  to that of the  Rauvee  is a plain tract  bounded to the east by mount  Imaus  bounded on the west and south by the chain of the  Panjah  hills There is another plain similar from the upper part of the  Setlege  as far as the  Ganges  where it flows through the province of  Sirinagur  I NOW ascend from its union with the  Chunaub  the  Behut  THE BEHUT  the most celebrated of the five rivers the  Fabulosus Hydaspes  which flows in two magnificent meanders and issuing from a narrow gap between exalted mountains from its origin in the romantic  Cashmere  partly along a plain partly at the foot of mountains cloathed with forests of trees of size magnificent many of which are perishing continually through weight of years and others succeeding them in the full verdure and vigor of youth Would my pen could be inspired like that of M  Bernier  who in attended in quality of a physician and philosophic friend to a great  Omrah  of that time a follower of  Aurengezebe  in his splendid progress to  Cashmere  for the recovery of his health by a change of the burning clime of  Hindoostan  for the salubrious air of the former I leave to the reader the perusal of  Bernier  the first traveller I may say of his or any other age I shall in a very abridged form take up the account from the departure of the court from  Agra  His suite was an army He was also attended by his sister which gave splendor unspeakable to the train of ladies He left  Agra  in the moment pronounced fortunate by the imperial astrologers To this day nothing is done without their auspices He took the road to  Lahore  hunting or hawking on each side as occasion offered Among the nobler game a lion presented itself In crossing the rivers bridges of boats were used for the purpose The heats on the march were dreadful  caused by the lofty mountains of  Cashmere  keeping the cool air of the north from refreshing the parched plains Between the  Chenaub  and the  Behut  is the vast mountain  Bember  MOUNTAIN BEMBER  It seems like a purgatory to be passed before the entrance into the PARADISE of  Hindoostan  can be accomplished It is steep black and burned The procession encamped in the channel of a large torrent dried up full of sand and stones burning hot "After passing the  Bember  " says the elegant traveller  we pass from a torrid to a temperate zone for we had no sooner mounted this dreadful wall of the world I mean this high steep black and bald mountain of  Bember  but that in descending on the other side we found an air that was pretty tolerable fresh gentle and temperate But that which surprised me more in these mountains was to find myself in a trice transported out of the  Indies  into  Europe  For seeing the earth covered with all our plants and shrubbs except  Issop  Thyme Marjoram  EUROPEAN TREES  and Rosemary I imagined I was in some of our mountains of  Auvergne  in the midst of a forest of all our kinds of Trees Pines Oaks Elms Planetrees And I was the more astonished because in all those burning fields of  Indostan  whence I came I had seen almost nothing of all that  AMONG other things relating to plants this surprized me that one and a half days journey from  Bember  I found a mountain that was covered with them on both sides but with this difference that on the side of the mountain that was southerly towards the  Indies  INDIAN  there was a mixture of  Indian  and  European  plants and on that which was exposed to the North I observed none but  European  ones as if the former had participated  of the air and temper of  Europe  and the  Indies  and the other had been meerly  European  I NOW enter the kingdom of  Cashmere  KINGDOM OF CASHMERE  and immediately resume the words of the elegant traveller  Thousands of cascades descend from the surrounding mountains of this enchanting plain and forming rivulets meandring through all parts render it so fair and fruitful that one would take this whole kingdom for some great  Evergreen  garden intermixed with villages and burroughs discovering themselves between trees and diversisied by Meadows Fields of Rice Corn and divers other Legumes of Hemp and Saffron all interlaced with ditches full of water with Channels with small Lakes and Rivulets here and there Up and down and every where are also seen some of our  European  plants Flowers and all sorts of our Trees as Apples Pears Prunes Apricots Cherries Nuts Vines the particular Gardens are full of Melons Skirrets Beets Radishes all sorts of our Potherbs and of some we have not  THIS HAPPY VALLEY this PARADISE OF HINDOOSTAN  ONCE A LAKE  of the  Indian  poets is of an oval form about eighty miles long and forty broad and was once supposed to have been entirely filled with water which having burst its mound left this vale inriched to the most distant ages by the sertilizing mud of the rivers which fed its expanse This delicious spot is surrounded by mountains of vast height and rude aspect covered with snow or enchased in glacieres in which this enchanting jewel is firmly set At the foot of the exterior chain is an interior circle of hills fertile in grass abundant in trees and various sorts of vegetation and full of all kinds of cattle as Cows Sheep Goats  Gazelles and Musks The approach to  Cashmere  is also very rugged and difficult We have mentioned the mountains of  Bember  besides those is one on which the pioneers of  Aurengezebe  were obliged to cut through a  glaciere  or a great mass as  Bernier  calls it of icy snow  P    THE capital of this happy spot is sometimes called  Cashmere  sometimes  Sirinagur  and sometimes  Nagaz  By Cheresiddin in his Life of Timur Bee ii  is seated in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ North on the banks of the river which runs with a current most remarkably smooth At a little distance from it is a small but beautiful lake with a communication with the river by a navigable canal The town was in  Bernier  's time three quarters of a  French  league long built on both sides and some part extended to the lake Villas Mosques and Pagodas decorate several of the little hills that border the water The houses are built of wood four stories high some higher the lower is for the cattle the next for the family the third and fourth serve as warehouses The roofs are planted with tulips which in the spring produce a wonderful effect Roses and numberless other flowers ornament this happy clime The inhabitants often visit the lake in their boats for the pleasure of hawking the country abounding with cranes and variety of game  THE river  RIVER BEHUT OR IHLUM  which rises at  Wair Naig  near the southern part of the surrounding mountains flows with a northwestern course by the capital and falls into lake  Ouller  which is fiftythree miles in length and lies in the northern part of the valley not remote from the kingdom of great  Thibet  then passes through the outlet at  Barehmooleh  between two steep mountains and  from thence after a long course to its junction with the  Chunaub  This river is large and navigable even within the limits of  Cashmere Bernier  p says it carries boats as large as those on the  Seine  at  Paris  Many small lakes are spread over the surface and some of them contain floating islands Among others  Bernier  p visited one which he calls  A great lake amidst the mountains which had ice in summer and looked like a little icy sea having heaps of ice made and unmade by the winds  This reminds me of the coalition and separation of the ice in the  Spitzbergen  seas This in question may be like the  Ouller  for I see none of any size in the maps excepting that expanse of water  AMONG the miraculous waters of the natives he reckons a periodical spring or the ebbing and flowing well of  Sandbrarc  which has near to it the temple of the idol of  Brare  The reader may amuse himself with the account from p to of this favorite writer and at p those of another much of the same nature  THE author of the  Ayeen Akberry  dwells with rapture on the beauties of  Cashmere  whence we may conclude that it was a favorite subject with his master  Acbar  who had visited it three times before  Abulfazel  wrote Other emperors of  Hindoostan  visited it also and seemed to forget the cares of government during their residence in the HAPPY VALLEY By the salubrity of the air and the chearing beauties of the place they collected new vigor to resume the cares of government The remains of the palaces pavilion and gardens exhibit proofs of their elegance and splendor It appears that the periodical rains which almost deluge the rest of  India  are shut out of  Cashmere  by the height of the mountains so that only light showers fall there these however are in abundance sufficient to feed the thousands of cascades which are precipitated into the valley from every part of the stupendous and romantic bulwark that encircles it Amidst the various felicities of the  Cashmerians  one dreadful evil they are constantly subject to namely earthquakes but to guard against their terrible effects all their houses are built of wood of which there is no want  THE  Cashmerians  are esteemed a most witty race and much more intelligent and ingenious than the  Hindoos  and as much addicted to the sciences and to poetry as the very  Persians  They have a language of their own but their books are written in the  Shanscrit  tongue although the character be sometimes  Cashmerian  Ayeen Akberry ii  They are also very industrious and excellent mechanics The various articles of their workmanship are sent into all parts of  India  Bernier p  This race is famous for the fineness of their features and their admirable complexions They look like  Europeans  and have nothing of the  Tartarian  flatnosed face and small eyes like those of  Caschguer  and their neighbors of  Thibet  It is certainly quite right that this PARADISE THE REGION OF ETERNAL SPRING should be peopled with females angelic they are uncommonly beautiful The courtiers of the time of  Bernier  were most solicitous to obtain for their  Zenanas  the  Cashmerian  fair in order that they might have children whiter than the natives of  Hindoostan  in order that they might pass for the true  Mogul  breed congenerous with their monarch  THE religion of the  Cashmerians  is the same as that of the  Hindoos  possibly the pardonable superstition of the inhabitants warmed by their romantic situation may have multiplied the places of worship of  Mahadeo  of  Beschan  and of  Brama  Here is a sect of religionists free from idolatry which worship the Deity alone They are remarkably benevolent and abstain from the other sex They must therefore be continued by disciples As to the  Mahometans  they are not numerous and those split into sects  Ayeen ii    THE  Cashmerians  seem to have had an idea of the deluge for say they in the early ages of the world all  Cashmere  except the mountains was covered with water One  Kushup  brought the  Brahmins  to inhabit the country as soon as the waters had subsided  Same  Neither were they ignorant of the history of  Noah  for the  Indians  speak of him under the name of  Sattiaviraden  who with his wife was by the god  Vichenou  who sent to them an ark preserved from destruction in a general deluge  Sonnerat vol ii  The first monarch of the country was  Owgnund  who was elected says  Abulfazul  years before his time  ¬ß Ayeen    HERE are numbers of hermits in places nearly inaccessible They are highly venerated some being supposed to have power to excite the fury of the elements  Bernier  p found an antient anchoute who had inhabited the summit of the lofty mountain  Pirepenjale  ever since the time of  Jehangire  who was here in His religion was unknown To him was attributed the power of working miracles He caused at his pleasure great  thunders and raised storms of hail rain snow and wind He looked savage having a large white beard uncombed which like that of our Druid "streamed like a meteor to the troubled air" The sage forbid the making the lest noise on pain of raising furious storms and tempests  Cashmere  is famous for its manufacture of  shawls  SHAWLS  made of the wool of the broadtailed sheep who are found in the kingdom of  Thibet  and their fleeces in fineness beauty and length says Mr  Bogle  in Ph Trans lxviii exceed all others in the world The  Cashmerians  engross this article and have factors in all parts of  Thibet  for buying up the wool which is sent into  Cashmere  and worked into  shawls  superior in elegance to those woven even from the fleeces of their own country This manufacture is a considerable source of wealth  Bernier  relates that in his days  shawls  made expressly for the great  Omrahs  of the  Thibetian  wool cost a hundred and fifty  roupees  whereas those made of the wool of the country never cost more than fifty  Akbar  was a most particular encourager of the manufacture He not only paid a great attention to those of this province but introduced them into  Lahore  where in his days there were a thousand manufactories says  Abulfazul  of this commodity The natural color of the wool of the  Tools assel  the name of the animal is grey tinged with red but some are quite white  Akbar  first introduced the dying them The wool of another animal used in the manufacture is white or black out out of which were woven white black and grey shawls Possibly two sorts of animals may produce the material one  indisputably the sheep I mention the other I have heard called a goat  THE domestic animals of this country are horses small hardy and surefooted Cows black and ugly but yield plenty of milk and excellent butter Here is also a sheep called  Hundoo  which is used to carry burdens No description is left to vindicate me for imagining it to be either the camel  Llama  Hist Quad i N  o  or the  Chilihucque  N  o  the first of which is used for burdens in  Peru  the last formerly in  Chili  Certain it is that  India  has a tall sheep which saddled actually can carry a boy twelve years old It is found about  Surat  Whether it could bear the snows of the  Cashmerian  Alps I leave for the subject of future inquiry  Abulfazul  p vol ii mentions the elk as one of the wild animals of the country and adds that the hunting leopards are made use of in the chase of that enormous deer The  Chittah  or hunting leopard must be brought from the scorched plains of  Bengal  The elk may be a native of the woods at the base of the snowy mountains for they are impatient of heat and require forests for they subsist both by browzing and by grazing  Cashmere  says its historians  PRINCES  had its own princes four thousand years before its conquest by  Akbar  in  Humaioon  cast a longing eye on this rich gem but by different accidents the acquisition was reserved for his son  Akbar  would have sound dissiculty to reduce this paradise of the  Indies  situated as it is within such a fortress of mountains but its monarch  Yusof Khan  was basely betrayed by his  Omrahs Akbar  used his conquest with moderation and allowed a pension to the conquered  Khan  and his gallant son From that time this happy valley enjoyed the most perfect tranquillity  THAT 'devouring prince'  TAMERLANE THERE  as  Tamerlane  was called by the  Hindoos  encamped at a place called  Gebban  on the frontiers of  Cashmere  During his stay in that delicious country he seems to have forgot his cruelty and left without doing any injury to the innocent inhabitants  Cheresiddin's Life of TimurBee Eng Trans ii p  This fair gem is at present possessed by  Timur Shah  successor to  Ahmed Abdalla  late king of  Candahar  Marco Polo  MARCO POLO THERE  in his travels over the east between the years and visited  Cashmere  which he calls  Chesimur  He agrees in several respects with the account given by  Abulfazul  and  Bernier  Mentions that the inhabitants have a language of their own that they are idolaters that they are very superstitious and describes their hermits and the powers they had of raising tempests and darkening the very air  Voi√†ges de Mare Polo in Bergeron's Collections p    I REJOIN the  Indus  at the mouth of the  Chenaub  INDUS CONTINUED  A little higher on the west side it receives the  Lucca  an obscure river which flows from the northwest rising in the kingdom of  Candahar  It is the only one which falls into the  Indus  in all the extent of the western side Above that on the same side is the  Cow  or  Cophenes  which leads to  Ghizni  and to  Bamia  at the foot of the  Paropamysan Caucasus  beyond that we pass the mouth of the  Kameh  or  Guraeus  which flows from  Cabul  The principal places in the vicinity of these rivers have already been noticed  I NOW return to  Attock  MR FORSTER'S JOURNEY  where the river assumes the name of that city till it reaches the conflux of the  Chenaub  below  Moultan Attock  signifies the  forbidden  it having been the original boundary of  Hindoostan  on this side which the  Hindoos  were prohibited from passing Here the river is three quarters of a mile broad the water very cold rapid and turbulent and a great deal of black sand suspended in it A little above  Attock  is  Bazaar  where Mr  Forster  crossed the  Indus  The extraordinary journey of that gentleman merits notice In the disguise of an  Asiatic  he left  Calcutta  in crossed the  Ganges  between  Loldong  and  Hurdwar  and the  Jumna  near  Meiro  proceeded on the south side of the mountains to  Jummoo  and then seems to have made a tour of curiosity to  Cashmere  From thence turned towards the southwest to  Bazaar  went northward to  Cabul  where he found the bills of  Calicut  seventeen or eighteen hundred miles distant negociable from thence went to  Candahar  and crossed the modern provinces of  Seisten Korasan  and  Mazanderan  to the shore of the  Caspian  sea took shipping at  Basrush  reached the  Volga  and arrived safe at  Petersburg  From  Oude  the last  British  station to the  Caspian  sea was twentyseven hundred miles His security lay in his concealment of his country he travelled with  Asiatics  he was obliged to conform to their manners to content himself with the cookery of every place he passed through submit to every accommodation and generally to sleep in the open air even in rain and snow and this he endured in a journey of a whole year He returned to  India  and ended of late years at the court of the  Nizam  in a public capacity his active and most enterprizing life  AFTER reaching  Bazaar  we are very little acquainted with the course of the  Indus  Mr  Rennel  informs us that the highest  point to which this river can be traced is  Shuckur  two hundred and thirty miles distant from  Attock  and from  Attock  to the sea is six hundred and sorty By the excellent map of the world published by Mr  Arrowsmith  it appears to pass through a long and narrow gap between two chains of mountains and to terminate at its origin in the middle of  Cashgar  What that distance is from  Shuckur  I cannot with certainty pronounce perhaps a hundred miles Adding this to the two other numbers we may fairly call the whole length a thousand miles  MR

arrival"  HOSPITAL FOR BIRDS  says he p  after we had dined and rested a while we caused ourselves to be conducted  to see a famous hospital of birds of all forts which for being sick lame deprived of their mates or otherwise needing food and cure are kept and tended there with diligence as also the men who take care of them are maintained by the public alms the  Indian  Gentiles who with  Pythagoras  and the antient  Egyptians  the first authors of this opinion according to  Herodotus  believe the transinigration of fouls not only from man to man but also from man to brute beast conceiving it no less a work of charity to do good to beasts than to men The house of this hospital is small a little room sufficing for many birds Yet I saw it full of birds of all sorts which need tendance as cocks hens pigeons peacocks ducks and small birds which during their being lame or sick or mateless are kept here but being recovered and in good plight if they be wild they are let go at liberty if domestic they are given to some pious person who keeps them in his house The most curious thing I saw in this place was certain little mice who being found orphans without fire or dam to tend them were put into this hospital and a venerable old man with a white beard keeping them in a box amongst cotton very diligently tended them with his spectacles on his nose giving them milk to eat with a bird's feather because they were so little that as yet they could eat nothing else and as he told us he intended when they were grown up to let them go free whither they pleased  "THE next morning" p adds he  FOR GOATS c  we saw another hospital of goats kids sheep and wethers either sick or lame  and there were also some cocks peacocks and other animals needing the same help and kept altogether quietly enough in a great court nor wanted there men and women lodged in little rooms of the same hospital who had care of them In another place far from hence we saw another hospital of cows and calves some whereof had broken legs others more infirm very old or lean and therefore were kept here to be cured Among the beasts there was also a  Mahometan  thief who having been taken in theft had both his hands cut off but the compassionate Gentiles that he might not perish miserably now he was no longer able to get his living took him into this place and kept him among the poor beasts not suffering him to want any thing Moreover without one of the gates of the city we saw another great troop of cows calves and goats which being cured and brought into better plight or gathered together from being dispersed and without masters or being redeemed with money from the  Mahometans  who would have killed them to eat namely the goats and other animals but not the cows and calves were sent into the field to feed by neatherds purposely maintained at the public charge and thus they are kept till being reduced to perfect health 'tis found fitting to give them to some citizens or others who may charitably keep them I excepted cows and calves from the animals redeemed from slaughter because in  Cambaia  cows calves and oxen are not killed by any and there is a great prohibition against it by the instance of the Gentiles who upon this account pay a great sum of money to the prince and should any either  Mahometan  or other be found to kill them he would be punished severely even with death  THE country around is remarkably flat  VAST TIDES  and in parts overflowed with the most rapid and sudden tides in the world They rise four or five fathoms and sweep

MECCA  A ship one of the two which annually sail from  Surat  to  Arabia  filled with devotees of the highest rank and some of the first persons of the court of  Aurengzebe  was taken in its passage in the latter end of the last century by the infamous pirate  Avery  Among the passengers was a lady said to have been the daughter of the emperor It proved a prize invaluable in great sums of money vessels of gold and silver jewels and rich habits for usually they are as much laden with merchandize upon account of the  Mogul  as upon that of the pilgrims and their returns are so rich that they make a part of the  European  trade for the merchandize of  Arabia Felix Avery  after plundering the ship of its wealth dismissed it and all its passengers This piracy for a time embroiled us with the  Mogul  but the affair being explained as the act of a robber he dismissed his anger against the  English  nation In the beginning of the last century only one ship great and clumsy was employed on this religiouscommercial business It carried fourteen or fifteen hundred tons and the richness of its lading both in going out and in returning was immense  Terry's Voy p  This is the most antient

Goodaverie  on the  Coromandel  coast in  Barmah  north of  Pegu  in the isle of  Sumatra  and possibly in many other places The property of this timber in resisting the worm renders it invaluable yet it has been neglected by the nonapplication of it for the building our ships of war The words of that very intelligent writer Mr  Rennel  will best convey the idea of the importance of this invaluable tree  I CANNOT close this account without remarking the unpardonable negligence we are guilty of in delaying to build teek ships of war for the use of the  Indian  seas They might be freighted home without the ceremony of regular equipment as to masts sails and furniture which might be calculated just to answer the purpose of the home passage at the best season and crews could be provided in  India  The letter annexed which was written with the best intentions nine or ten years ago will explain the circumstances of the case  VAST DURATION  Teek ships of forty years old and upwards are no uncommon objects in the  Indian  seas while an  European  built ship is ruined there in five years The ships built at  Bombay  are the  best both in point of work manship and materials of any that are constructed in  India  and although fourth rates only are mentioned in the letter there is no doubt but that third rates may be constructed as there is a choice of timber The  Spaniards  build capital ships in their foreign settlements The  East India  Company have a teek ship on her fourth voyage at present which ship has wintered in  England  therefore any objection founded on the effects of frost on the teek timber is done away  FREQUENT have been the opportunities I have had of observing how very rapid the decay of ships built of  European  timber is in the  East Indies  and on the contrary how durable the ships are that are built of the wood of that country namely the teek which may not improperly be styled  Indian  oak The number of ships of war that were ruined in those seas during the late war to may be admitted as a proof of the former remark and the great age of the ships built in  India  may serve to prove the latter What I mean to infer from this for your Lordship's use is that ships of war under third rates may be constructed in  India  and with moderate repairs last for ages whereas a ship of  European  construction can remain there but a very few years to which disadvantage may be added that of losing in the mean time the services of the ships that are sent to relieve the worn out ones  THE  Britannia  of seven hundred tons which was built of  teek

one was built taking in a space of four miles in circuit It was of brick eight yards high with round bastions and on each were five or six cannons  Europeans  are surprised to hear of the extent of an  Indian  city but they must be told that besides their towns being very populous every house consists but of one floor which makes  them occupy more ground besides that every house is attended with a great garden a requisite as most of the food of the  Indians  is vegetable  Sevatjee  was founder of the  Mahratta  kingdom we so often hear mentioned  THE MAHRATTAS  The name is derived from  Mahrat  the province in which he first established his independency This hero derived his lineage from the  Rajahs  of  Chietore  who pretend that their descent is from  Porus  He took advantage of the troubles which arose in his time in the kingdom of  Visiapour  and again during the wars between  Aurengzebe  and his brothers He extended his conquests from  Baglana  near  Surat  to the  Portuguese  districts near  Goa  a little beyond the foot of the  Ghauts  His capital was  Poonah  an open town but he kept his archives at  Poorundar  a place of vast strength a fortress on the summit of a mountain he died in His successors extended their conquests or rather their inroads all over  Hindoostan  and even compelled the great  Mogul  to pay them a  chout  or tribute to save his subjects from future calamities  FROM time to time they extended their dominions to a vast magnitude  THEIR GOVERNMENT  and divided them into two empires that of  Poonah  or the western and  Berar  or the eastern The first is divided again among a number of chieftains who pay just as much obedience as they like to a  Paishwah  or head whom Mr  Rennel  justly compares to the emperor of  Germany  and the chieftains to the princes of that great body they often quarrel with him and often among themselves and never are united but by the apprehension of a common danger Their empires extend from  Guzerat  to near the banks of the  Ganges  and southerly to the  northern borders of the dominions of  Tippoo Sultan  Their forces consist of two hundred thousand foot and horse and the same number in garrison

Asia  p vol i It relates to the armies of  Ayder Alli  but applies equally to the military of all the powerful chieftains of  India  "It may" says the ingenious writer  perhaps afford some measure of gratification to  European  curiosity to be informed that the undisciplined troops of  Asia  generally inflamed with  bang  and other intoxicating drugs pour forth as they advance a torrent of menacing and abusive language on their adversaries Every expression of contempt and aversion every threat fitted to make an impression of terror or to excite ideas of horror that custom readily presents or inventive fancy can suggest accompanies the utmost ferocity of looks voice and gesture A murmuring sound with clouds of dust announce their approach while they are yet at the distance of several miles As they advance their accents are more and more distinctly heard until at last with their eyes fixed and weapons pointed at some individual they devote him with many execrations to destruction giving his flesh like the heroes in  Homer  and the  Philistine  warriors to the dogs and the birds of the air and the beasts of the field The numbers of the  Asiatic  armies the ferocity of their manner and the novelty of their appearance would unnerve and overcome the hearts of the small  European  bodies that are opposed to them in the field of battle if experience had not sufficiently  proved how much the silence of discipline excels barbarian noise and uniformity of design and action the desultory efforts of brutal force acting by starts and liable to the contagion of accidental impression  THE land from the mouth of the river of  Surat  CAPE ST JOHN  makes a slight curvature as far as Cape  St John  or the  Baryagazenum Promontorium  From this Cape as far as  Bombay  according to our  East India  pilot the coast is skirted with islands divided from the continent and from each other by very narrow channels To the north of it is  Damoon  a strong place possessed  DAMOON  in the last century by the  Portuguese  but now in a most ruinous state It was once besieged by  Aurengzebe  who had determined to take it by storm and fixed on a  Sunday  for the attack thinking that the  Christians  like the  Jews  would on that day make no resistance The Governor an old soldier caused mass to be said at midnight then made a sally with all his cavalry and a strong body of infantry into a quarter guarded by two hundred elephants he knew the dread those animals had of fire he assailed them with fireworks The distracted beasts in the darkness of the night and without their governors rushed on their own forces which put the army into such disorder that before morning half was cut to pieces by the  Portuguese  and in consequence the siege raised  THE tract that borders on the sea  CONCAN  from  Bombay  even as far as  Soonda  in Lat ¬∞ is called  Concan  This was the  Lymirica  of  Arrian  ii a coast full of ports of which he enumerates several it once formed part of the kingdom of  Visiapour  At the partition teaty it was confirmed to the  Mahrattas  who now  possess a line of coast of three hundred miles in extent out of which the  English  possess  Bombay  and its adjacent isles and the strong hold of  Victoria  and the  Portuguese Goa  and the antient domain belonging to that once famous  emporium  The part of the  Concan  next to the sea is low but at a small distance inland rises into vast strength It is guarded by the celebrated mountains the  Ghauts  which rise to a surprising height and oppose to the west a mural front with  Ghauts  THE GHAUTS  i e passes They are the same which the  Welsh  call a  Bwlch  From the word  Ghaut  the whole chain derives its name They give entrance into the lofty fertile and populous plains of boundless view which they support in the manner as buttresses do a terrace formed on an immense scale These run not remote from the sea from  Surat  to Cape  Comorin  at some places seventy miles distant but generally forty and in one place they advance to within six They have lesser hills at their bases clothed with forests particularly of the valuable  teek  The plains are blest from their situation with a cool and healthy air From the sides of the mountains precipitate magnificent cataracts forming torrents the means of facilitating the conveyance of the timber and giving a thousand picturesque scenes amidst the forests  THE  Ghauts  are distinguished into the western and the eastern  EASTERN c  The first extend as I have described uninterruptedly from  Surat  to the pass of  Palicaudchery  when near  Coimbetore  they suddenly turn deeply undulating to the north Then at the pass of  Gujethetty  wind north and northeasterly as high as  Amboor  and  Mugglee  the last about eighty miles due west of  Madras  From hence they are not by reason of the numbers  of branches sufficiently marked on the maps they seem to take a northerly course to comprehend  Aurungabad  to cross the  Tapte√®  and continue westerly at irregular distances from the river till they arrive at a certain space from  Surat  THE whole chain especially in the  Concan  seems a connected wall inaccessible to the summit unless by paths worked by the hand of man and is not to be ascended even by a single traveller without the fatiguing labor of many hours horrible precipices roaring cataracts and frequent reverberating echoes terrify the passenger on each side often violent gusts arise and hurry men and cattle into the black immeasurable abyss Having attained the summit the trouble is repaid by the magnificent prospect to the west of the far subjacent country broken into hills and clothed with beautiful vegetation the coast the islands and the immensity of ocean  THESE  Indian Appenines  mark with precision the limits of the winter and summer  SEASONS  or rather the wet and dry seasons in  India  They extend thirteen degrees of latitude from  Surat  to Cape  Comorin  They arrest the great body of clouds in their passage and according to the  Monsoons  or periodical winds from the northeast or southwest give alternately a dry season to one side and a wet one to the other some clouds do pass over and give a rainy season but at a very considerable distance to the leeward being too high and too light to condense and fall in rain within a small distance of this great range  IN Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≥ is a very considerable bay filled with islands  BAY OF BOMBAY  well known by the name of  Bombay  which forms the best and most secure harbour in  India  This as well as every part of  this coast was the usurped property of the  Portuguese  but the greatest part of this extremity was wrested from them by the  Mahrattas  a few places they retained for some time but at length all fell under the power of the new usurpers Among the places was  Bassein  BASSEIN  which had been taken by  Nugns d'Acugna  viceroy of  India  in and by him strongly fortified It was in our days seized by the  Mahrattas  and again in by the  English  under General  Goddard  who restored it to its late masters by the treaty of  DOCTOR  Fryer  who visited this city about the year when it was in possession of the  Portuguese  speaks of it as a very considerable place having six churches four convents a college of  Jesuits  and another of  Franciscans  ABOUT twenty miles from  Bassein  VISRABUY  inland is  Visrabuy  famous for its hot wells which are in high esteem for their medicinal virtues and accounted by the  Hindoos  of great sanctity  THE principal isle is that of  Salsette  ISLE OF SALSETTE  which is divided from the continent by a very narrow channel it is about fifteen miles in circumference and rich in fruits and vegetables General  Goddard  included this island in his other conquests It was wisely retained on the conclusion of the peace and confirmed to us by the last peace together with some little isles or rocks that lay within the important bay  Salsette  was gallantly defended by an old man of ninetytwo who being summoned to surrender answered "He was not sent for that purpose" It was not till he was slain in a bloody assault that the place was taken

Ives  calls it the grand storehouse of all the  Arabian  and  Persian  commerce The  Arabs  still keep up a considerable trade in ships of a thousand tons either  Indian  built or old  Indiamen  bought from the company One article is the  Kasmish  raisin a species without stones brought from  Kasmish  an isle in the  Persian  gulph The exports from  India  are chiefly cottons c to a great amount but the trade between these parts and the  Persian  and  Arabian  gulphs has of late been much injured by caravans crossing the isthmus of  Bassora  conducted by the  Syrians  themselves The whole bay is full of shoals or rocks yet with channels of sufficient depth of water for the skilful pilate to bring in securely the largest ships and here even our military fleets find conveniencies for heaving down and refitting Admiral  Watson  and again Admiral  Hughes  found here every species of naval store here his Majesty's ships winter and refit  ALTHOUGH  Bombay  is a place of very great

The durability of this timber is beyond belief greater than that of our best  English  oak it resists the worm longer than any other but whether this be owing to the nature of the timber itself or to the cement with which the plank is joined and covered I cannot tell  Surat  or  Bombay  built ships will certainly last threescore years some say many more in which time however they are generally doubled once or twice so that the sides of an old ship are as thick as the walls of an house Much is likewise said of the number of years they sometimes run without having occasion to use a pump but of this I cannot speak  with certainty All the repairs are effected by native carpenters and all the ships even the largest are built by them and in a simplicity of manner which would astonish an  European  workman M  Sonnerat  i tab represents the  Indian  with all the powers of his art The neighboring mountains supply them with  teekwood Bengal  with iron and hemp and the adjacent forests

peace to the southern part of this vast continent  A MOST unfortunate expedition took its departure from this place in  EXPEDITIONS FROM BOMBAY  at which period it had not the happiness of being under the rule of a HASTINGS A little time before  Roganaut Row  a  Mahratta  chieftain fled from his country and put himself under the protection of this presidency He had been guardian to the young  Paishwa Naron Row  his own nephew In the numbers of intrigues that infested the state of  Poonah  a conspiracy was formed against the youth A band of assassins were employed to murder him  Roganaut  better known by the name of  Ragobah  was at the time confined in prison The nephew flew to seek safety in his arms In that case he would have been safe but he could only fling himself at his feet The youth was murdered The uncle exchanged his prison for the  Paishwaship  Fresh conspiracies arose and  Roganaut  forced to fly to the  English  for protection  Account of Bombay p  Aspiring to the office he flattered the  English  with vast advantages in case they espoused his cause and soon prevaled on them to commence hostilities  Salsette Baroach  and other places fell before them The treaty of  Poorunder  in secured those places to us for a time In a little space war broke out again fomented by  Roganaut  assisted by our fears of the  French  who were busy in their intrigues at the court of  Poonah  In a small army  UNDER EGERTON  under the command of Brigadier General  Egerton  assisted by a field committee ever embarrassing from the days of the Duke of  Marlborough  to the present was sent with him to advise or rather to perplex the commanders The army which consisted of not quite four thousand men crossed the bay to  Uptah  river marched by  Panwel Campooly  and up the  Bhore Ghaut  to  Candolah  which we found unoccupied the object was  Poonah  They reached the once fair city of  Tullingaum  on  January  It had been burnt the night before by the  Mahrattas  themselves who appeared covering the plains numerous as the sands of the sea They made frequent attacks on our army and destroyed several gallant officers and numbers of our  European  soldiers and  Sepoys  We made a quick retreat to the village of  Worgaum  From thence our field committee sent a flag of truce and offer of treaty It was accepted on condition that we were to relinquish our past conquests of  Salsette  and other places to give up  Roganaut  and two of the field committee as hostages and to send orders to General  Goddard  on full march with the  Bengal  army to return instantly home  Goddard  received the humiliating orders  UNDER GODDARD  but rejected them with indignation and continued his route marked in every place with glory and victory  See the history of this disgraceful business in a little to pamphlet published at Brecknock in entitled The Expedition of Tullingaum c and the War in Asia i p p    IN  January  after the conquest of  Bassein  that able officer assembled his troops at  Vizrabuy  and in order to make a diversion in favor of  Madras  then in imminent danger advanced to  Campooly  and from thence to  Candolah  which the enemy had possessed themselves of in great force but they soon were driven from their arduous station It should seem that  Tullingaum  had been rebuilt since the last expedition for the General found it just burnt and  Poonah  filled with combustibles ready for the same fate He found an army of seventy thousand horse and foot ready to oppose his little body of six thousand yet such was the terror of the foe that they again burnt the town of  Tullingaum  An  Indian  town is as soon rebuilt as destroyed and every preparation was made for burning  Poonah  by filling the houses with straw and removing the inhabitants to the strong hold of  Sattarah  Thus circumstanced our General thought proper to retreat in order to assist with part of his forces his friends then besieged in  Tellicherry  by  Sardar Khan  a general of  Ayder Alli  's This movement was conducted with such secrecy and skill that the whole of the artillery and heavy stores reached the foot of the pass in safety and without the smallest interruption from the enemy who were astonished on  the morning of the th of  April  to find that our post at  Can dolah  had been deserted during the preceding night Ten thousand of the bravest undisciplined infantry in  Hindoostan  followed him to the subjacent country they consisted of  Arabs  and  Sindies  who attempted to harass him in his march but in vain He repelled every attack with great slaughter His own loss consisted only of a few camp followers and common soldiers I observe at this time  Hurry Punt  afterwards our friend in the campaigns in the  Mysore  in among the hostile commanders  Goddard  returned with fresh laurels to  Bombay  which even want of success could not sere  BESIDES the two islands I have mentioned  ELEPHANTA c  scattered over the found are several others such as  Caranja Elephanta Hog Butcher  and  Green  island most of them very small but all of them rising in one part or other into a lofty hill  OPPOSITE to  Caranja  stood the antient  Calliana  of  Arrian  CALLIANA  ii a famous and much frequented  emporium  It had been a common port to all nations till the  Romans  made a conquest of  Egypt  after which they prohibited every country from entering the  Red  sea and monopolized all the trade of  India  every port on this coast was shut against foreigners and that of  Calliana  is particularized by  Arrian  The remains of that city were observed by Doctor  Fryer  But what gives this neighborhood great celebrity is the vast caverns the works of very old times discovered in the isles of  Salsette  and of  Elephanta  and of certain other places hereafter to be pointed out  FAMOUS CAVERNS  The celebrated M NIEBUHR who visited those caves and those in  Salsette  in has given numbers of  elegant plates of the various figures attended with descriptions See his second volume of Travels p to Mr  Gough  has also published a most elaborate account of these wonderful caves printed by  John Nichol  in Finally descriptions may be found in the viith and viiith volumes of the  Archaelogia  by the pen of Messrs  Mackneil Hunter Pyke  and  Boon  The accounts are of considerable length drawn up with great accuracy and attended with figures of the principal antiquities Vast hills have been excavated by human art most probably for religious purposes Mr  Ives  gives the ground plan of that at  Elephanta  by which it appears to be a hundred and eighty feet by a hundred and fifty in dimensions part is supported by vast pillars of a rounded form swelling at the middle resting on a square base on the summit of which at each corner is a sitting ape In the entrance are left pillars nearly similar but plain and without figures  THE inside is divided into several square apartments the greatest propt by the pillars above described and is a hundred and four feet square At each angle it is divided into three small square rooms and at one of the entrances within for there are three is another all perhaps chapels These are expressed in Mr  Pyke  's plan  IN every cave described by these curious travellers are most amazing numbers of sculptures all cut out of the live rock of human figures extravagant deities monsters animals foliage and all that can astonish and bewilder the imagination Many represent idols of the  Indian  mythology figures half beast and half man many faces and many hands to the same sculpture  and often the  Cobra de Capello  that dreadful snake which is attendant on several of the incarnations of  Vistchenou  A fish is one which assists to explain the object of the sculptures and uses of the excavations  THESE caverns are the haunts of monstrous serpents  Hamilton  i tells us that on firing his fusil to enjoy the thundering echo of the report he disturbed a  Boa  fifteen feet in length and two feet in girth from its antient seat which put the traveller to speedy flight and an end to his curiosity  MOST of the figures are colossal from twelve to twentythree feet high Some of them with all their extravagancies are said to be finely executed many are cross leg'd in their attitude of prayer many have rosaries which prove that these places were objects of devotion  THE woman with three faces and four arms is engraven in Mr  Pyke  's account I beg leave to make a few remarks on that figure round her neck are five necklaces rich in pearls and gems with pendent jewels her hair is long and hangs in beautiful ringlets her ears not her earrings as they are called hang to a vast length exactly in the  Malabar  mode and her headdress is conic in the  Chinese  fashion which might have been in use in early times The last is dropt the strange deformity of long ears are still retained so far is certainly of eastern sculpture  BUT what can be said to the figures found in another cave in the neighborhood of  Bombay  not expressed by name they are engraven in volume vii of the  Archaelogia  some have the sausage curl others the cochlear twirl in the hair and others  the rich braid of pearl all resembling in some degree the fantastic variety in the headdresses of the  Roman  ladies without the lest trace of  oriental  fashion  I SHALL conclude with saying that the cave of  Elephanta  takes its name from an elephant with a lesser on its back cut on the outside of the cave and in a passage is the rude figure of a horse called that of  Alexander  the Great to whom the  Indians  attribute these mighty works as we  Welsh  do every thing stupendous to our favorite  Arthur  I mention this tradition to shew its great antiquity as well as that of the excavations themselves  Arrian  in his  Periplus maris Erythraei  ii says that there were near  Barygaza  foundations of camps antient chapels altars and  great wells all attributed to the  Macedonian  hero  THE idols mentioned here are quite diminutive to some in the  Soobahship  of  Cashmere  in recesses excavated in the mountain which are called says the  Ayeen  ii  Surnmii  and are pretended to have been the winter retreat of the antient inhabitants one of the figures was eighty ells high there was a woman of fifty and a child of fifteen In one of these  Surnmii  was found a tomb and in that a coffin in which was a corpse preserved by medical preparations one would suppose that the customs of the  Tartars  had been observed in this place and burning the bodies at that time not in use  THE method of travelling which begins at  Surat  TRAVELLING IN INDIA  and is continued through most parts of  India  is by oxen The ox supplies the use of the horse the smaller sort serve as pads the larger are used in drawing a kind of carriage called a hackerie  The beasts are commonly white have black noses and large perpendicular horns they are also remarkable like most other  Indian  and  African  cattle for a hunch rising between the shoulders Those of  Guzerat  are most remarkably large and in great request through most parts of  India  The hunch is highly esteemed as a delicacy salted and boiled When they are fitted for the saddle or the draft a cord and sometimes a piece of wood is passed through the nose from nostril to nostril and a cord extended from each end as a bridle M  Sonnerat  vol i tab gives a print of the  Hackerie  or  Gari  as it is called in  India  and all its apparatus In  England  if these creatures are forced out of their usual slow pace it is too well known that they will faint or lie down under their burthen but at  Bombay  they trot and gallop as naturally as horses and are equally as serviceable in every other respect except that by their being subject to a loose habit of body they sometimes incommode the traveller by the filth thrown upon him by the continual motion of their tails Whenever they get to the end of the journey the driver always alights and puts the near bullock in the other's place then he puts his hand into both their mouths and after pulling out the froth mounts his box again and drives back It seems this precaution is absolutely necessary for as they travel at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour they would otherwise be in danger of suffocation  BESIDES the large species which I have engraven in vol i tab ii of my  Hist Quadr  is a diminutive species tab iii common at  Surat  not bigger than a large dog which has a fierce look but is trained to draw children in their little carts I have been  informed that a bull and cow from I believe the  Tanjore  country have been imported into  England  the height of the first not exceeding nineteen inches and of the last not eighteen  BEING on the subject of animals  SHEEP  I shall mention a species of the next genus the sheep That called  Cabrito  by the  Portuguese  is a very long legged kind and of a very disgusting appearance At  Goa  it is sometimes saddled and bridled and serves instead of a poney and will carry a child of twelve years of age  ABOUT  Bombay  is found the squirrel  Hist Quadr  ii N  o  known by the name of the place it is very large and of a purple color  I MUST now digress to a very different class  SERPENTS  The tribe of snakes is very numerous in  India  I think their great historiographer  M de la Cepede  enumerates fortyfour species already known I shall only mention the most curious I am uncertain whether they are quite local Mr  Ives  speaks of some found in this island or neighborhood the  Cobra Capello  I shall describe some time hence Mr  Ives  relates that the  Cobra Manilla  is only a foot long of a bluish color haunting old walls Its bite is as fatal as that of the  Cobra Capello  which kills in the space of a quarter of an hour The  Cobra de Aurellia  is only six inches long and not thicker than the quill of a crow it is apt to creep into the ear and occasion death by madness The sand snake is small but not less fatal than the others The  Palmira  with a viperine head and varied body is four feet long yet in no part thicker than a swan's quill  AMONG the variety of beautiful shells found on the coast  TURBO SCALARIS  is the noted  Turbo Scalaris  or  Wentletrap  a shell seldom an inch and a quarter long of a pearly color and with about seven spires each having several elegant ridges crossing them from the first spire to the last a sine representation of the winding staircase A painter I knew filled with the  Conchamania  once gave fiftysix guineas for three of them one alone he valued at twentyfive  SOME few other things respecting the natural history of  Bombay  and its neighborhood may be here taken notice of The diseases of  India  begin to shew themselves in this place  BARBIERS A DISEASE  but I shall only attend to the  Barbiers  which is more prevalent on this side of the peninsula of  India  than the other It is a palsy which takes its name from  Beriberii  or the sheep as the afflicted totter in their gait like that animal when seized with a giddiness Its symptoms are both a numbness a privation of the use of the limbs a tremor and an attendant titillation usually not fatal but extremely difficult of cure It comes on slowly and usually in the rainy season but if a person drinks hastily when heated a large draught of  Toddy  or the liquor of the coco nut the attack of the disease is very sudden  Bontius English  edition p treats largely of the cure He recommends strongly baths or somentations of the  Nochile  of the  Malabars  or  Lagondi  of the  Malays  or the  Jasminum Indicum  THE phoenomenon of small fish appearing in the rainy season  FISHES FALLING ON LAND  in places before dry is as true as it is surprising The natives begin to fish for them the tenth day after the first rains  and they make a common dish at the tables Many are the modes of accounting for this annual appearance It has been suggested that the spawn may have been brought by the water fowl or may have been caught up by the  Typhons  which rage at the commencement of the wet season and be conveyed in the torrents of rain I can only give an explanation much less violent That these fishes never had been any where but near the places where they are found That they have had a preexistent state and began life in form of frogs that it had been the  Rana paradoxa  of  Gm Lin  iii p Their transformation is certainly wonderful I refer the reader to  Seba  i p tab and to  Merian  's  Surinam  p tab in which are full accounts of the wonderful phoenomenon of these transmuted reptiles which complete their last transformation in the first rains  ALL kinds of reptiles appear about that season among others  TOADS VAST  toads of most enormous sizes Mr  Ives  mentions one that he supposed weighed between four and five pounds and measured from the toe of the fore to that of the hind leg twentytwo inches  I NOW leave the bay after saying that the tides here and at  Cambay  rise to an amazing height this must be understood when they are pent up in bays or gulphs for on the open shore they do not rise above a foot and a half Into the eastern side flows the river  Pen  with stoney and steep banks Immediately beyond the mouth the land resumes its course  ISLES OF KANARA AND HUNARY  The isles of  Kanara  and  Hunary  appear at no great distance from shore small and lofty  Sevatjee  seized on the first in defiance of every effort  of the  English  at  Bombay  He fortified this little spot Finding ourselves too weak to remove so dangerous a neighbor we stirred up against him the  Siddee  or admiral to  Aurengzebe  This brought on several sharp naval actions  Orme's Fragments  The  Siddee  seized on the neighboring  Hunary  and each party carrying on a cruel war gave importance to these inconsiderable spots  Choule  and  Victoria  CHOULE  and several other small places are given in the charts on this coast  Dunda Rajapore  was a port the rendezvous of  Aurengzebe  's fleet under the command of his  Siddee  The  Siddee  was an office formed at the time when the  Mogul  empire first extended itself to these coasts Its duty was like that of the  Comes Littoris Saxonici  on the  French  and  British  shores and was here intended to repel the insults of the  Malabar  or  Portuguese  cruizers as the  Roman Comes  was those of the  Norman  rovers In the year there were a hundred and twenty  Gallivats  and fifteen Grabs and a vast army encamped in the neighborhood  Correspondent to them were  Nitrias  the modern  Newtya Tynadis Muziris  and numbers of other ports mentioned by the  Greek  and  Roman  historians  PIRATE COAST  This is the  Pirate coast  and extends almost from  Bombay  till we have arrived very near to  Goa  The  Romans  were obliged to put on board their merchantships a number of archers to defend them against the attacks of the pirates  Plin Nat Hist lib vi c  which according to the  Universal History  x p are said to have been  Arabians  Mr  Rennel  gives an admirable description of this extent of freebooters  PERHAPS there are few coasts so much broken into small bays and harbours and that at the same time have so straight a general outline This multitude of small ports uninterrupted view along shore and elevated coasts savourable to distant vision have sitted this coast for the seat of piracy and the alternate land and sea breezes that prevail during a great part of the year oblige vessels to navigate very near the shore No wonder then that  Pliny  should notice them in his time as committing depredations on the  Roman East India  trade and although a temporary check has been given them in the destruction of  Angria  's fleets c yet we may expect that they will continue the practice while commerce lasts They are protected by the shallowness of their ports and the strength of the country within As pirates they have greater natural advantages than those of  Barbary  who being compelled to roam far from their coasts have expensive outsets here the prizes come to their own doors and the cruizers may lie secure in port until the prey is discovered  THE vessels used by these pirates are of two kinds  GRABS  The larger are called  Grabs  a few have three masts and carry three hundred tons the lesser have only two masts and are of the burden of a hundred and fifty tons On the main deck under the forecastle are mounted two cannons nine or ten pounders pointing forwards and firing over the prow  Orme i p  which is constructed like that of a  Mediterranean  galley The cannons on the broadside are from six to nine pounders  Gallivats  are large row boats  GALLIVATS  built like the  Grabs  but do not exceed seventy tons The larger carry six or eight cannons from two to four pounders the lesser only petteraroes but both are furnished with forty or fifty stout oars which are rowed at the rate of four miles an hour both  Grabs  and  Gallivats  are crowded with men Eight or ten of the latter and forty or fifty of the former compose  Angria  's principal fleet for attacking ships of force They scruple not to make prize of every one which does not condescend to purchase their passports  As soon as they descry a sail they slip from port and sail as fast as the wind or if it is calm soon reach the object with their oars the  Gallivats  taking the  Grabs  in tow They then assemble on the stern of the chace within cannon shot and attempt to dismast her As soon as they succeed they surround and batter her on all sides If the ship makes an obstinate defence a number of  Gallivats  with two or three hundred men in each board her sword in hand from all quarters and in the same instant I am obliged to Mr  Orme  's classical history for this account  THIS coast was equally infamous in the days of  Pliny  possibly long before even as long as commerce became considerable in these seas In lib vi c he warns the  Roman  merchants of the dangers of this route from touching at  Muziris  not only because it is not abundant in articles of commerce but as it borders upon the  Piratae  HYDRAS  who had a port at  Hydras  some write it  Nitrias  yet I think the historian intended the first allusive to the fabled serpent which makes every thing its prey Their ports of this coast are truly described by  Pliny  to be shallow  VI  VICTORIA  so that the commerce was then carried on as it is in many places to this day in small boats which convey the merchandize to the ships which are obliged to anchor at a distance from land  Ptolemy  also mentions the ports of these pirates or the  and gives a lift of them It is not improbable but that these pests of the sea continued from that time to the present but certain it is that  Vasco de Gama  found them on this coast in full force in his first voyage to  India Marco Polo  who travelled in describes at p their piracies in those days both in the seas of  Guzerat  and  Malabar  He says they took their wives and children with them and passed the whole summer on the sea They commonly had twenty ships in a fleet which they ranged at the distance of five miles from each other making a line of a hundred miles As soon as any one described a merchant ship it made a signal by smoke to the rest so there was no possibility of escape They offered no violence to the crew they only plundered the vessel and set the people on shore  IN our days many of the ports of the modern pirates have been brought into notice by the attempts to extirpate these nests of thieves and with a temporary success Their principal fastnesses were in  Victoria Severndroog Sunderdoo Vingorla  rocks in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≥ six or seven miles from the shore and I should have given particular preeminence to  Gheriah  GHERIAH  the port of the chief pirate  Angria  nearly midway between  Bombay  and  Goa  Victoria  is the name we bestowed on one of these fastnesses The  Indian  one was  Bancoote  This we retain not only because  it has a good harbour and great trade in salt but because the neighborhood abounds with cattle with which we can supply the garrison and navy at  Bombay  The country is peopled with  Mahomctans  who have no scruple to part with them as the  Hindoos  have  Grose's Voyage ii    THE reduction of these piratical powers added greatly to the glory of the  British  arms  SIR WILLIAM JAMES  Severndroog  and five other of the forts on this coast were taken in  April  by Commodore  James  commander of the  East India  Company's marine forces in  India  Orme's Hist i  The  Mahratta  fleet made a shew of assisting us but never once came within reach of the guns Mr  James  acquired immortal honor and was among the very few who have of late years made the title of Baronet the  praemium virtutis  THIS success facilitated the reduction of  Gheriah  THE PIRATE ANGRIA  the chief fort and residence of  Angria  the head of the piratical states RearAdmiral  Watson  who commanded the royal squadron seconded by Mr  James  made himself master of the place in  February  in less than twentyfour hours at the expence of no more than twenty men The chieftain  Tullagee Angria  escaped two or three days before the attack and basely deserted his wife and little children Mr  Ives  gives an affecting account of the interview between them and our humane admiral Notwithstanding  Angria  forgot what ought to be dearer than all besides he took care to secure his treasure Our army and our navy who were very nearly quarrelling about the booty before  VII  GHERIAH  the attack was made found that the wily  Indian  had left them no more than the value of one hundred thousand pounds to divide among them  THE first of the name was  Conagee Angria  ORIGIN OF THE NAME  an adventurer in the time of  Aurengzebe  entrusted by the  Mahrattas  with the fort of  Severndroog  He not only kept possession of that fortress but extended his territories a hundred and twenty miles along the coasts and as far inland as the  Ghauts Mahrattas Indians  renegado  Christians  and  Negroes  flocked in vast numbers to the piratical standard which became at last as formidable in these seas as that of  Algiers  in the  Mediterranean  All his successors retained the name of  Angria  even to the last whose destruction we have related  I HERE mention  Dabul  a neighboring place  DABUL  to contrast the conduct of the  Portuguese  who in took it with uncommon instances of barbarity They set fire to it in four places The male inhabitants escaped but the savage heroes for we cannot deny the character of heroism put to the sword the defenceless sex and innocent children  Conquetes des Portugais iv  After various other barbarities along the coast the wretched conqueror  Brandan  was received at the capital  Goa  with every mark of approbation  THE important city of  Goa  stands on an island of the same name  ISLE OF GOA  in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≥ in a fine bay a few leagues lower The city was for a great length of time the most magnificent in  India  The churches and palaces of the inhabitants were of  great grandeur and splendor It stands elevated in form of an amphitheatre on the banks of a most beautiful bay The country rises gently into hills finely wooded and the scene is varied with churches convents and villas and the distance bounded by the  Ghauts  soaring with aweful majesty The  Algoada  fort defends the entrance on the northern side All this is shewn in Mr  Dalrymple  's elegant views Two rivers flow from the  Balagat  mountains and their mouths nearly meet opposite to the harbour On one which was called the  Ganges  a few leagues from the sea stood the  Nelcynda Arrian  ii says that the ships which took in part of their lading there fell down and received the rest while they lay at anchor before  Barace  a town near its mouth or in the modern canal of  Bardez  THE  Indian  name of  Goa  was  Tricurii  or the isle of  Thirty Villages  it is said to have been peopled by  Moorish  merchants who had been banished from different ports of  Malabar  and formed soon a very flourishing settlement This is said to have happened at no very distant period before the arrival of the  Portuguese  WHEN the great  Albuquerque  entered on his viceroyalty  SEIZED BY ALBUQUERQUE  it was a most opulent place and strongly fortified It was at that time subject to  Zabaim  a potent monarch who was then engaged in war with divers tributary princes  Timoia  a neighboring pirate who had submitted to the  Portuguese  strongly advised the  Christian  General to seize the opportunity of attacking  Goa  representing its great opulence and the honor and wealth that would attend his success  Albuquerque  listened to  his advice and after several assaults made himself master of the city by an agreement with the inhabitants This happened on  February  The citizens took the oaths of allegiance to  Emmanuel  he found in the place immense quantities of ammunition forty great cannon and in the docks forty men of war and in the stables numbers of fine  Persian  and  Arabian  horses  Osorio ii p  He himself resided in the royal palace the fame of his valor and prudence spread far and wide He received embassies from several of the  Indian  monarchs and even was encouraged to send an envoy to the sophy of  Persia  Unfortuately a mutinous spirit pervaded his army and even his principal officers This naturally infected his new subjects who repenting their disloyalty and disgusted with their sudden submission to a foreign and  Christian  yoke conveyed their sentiments to their late sovereign He assembled a mighty army on the continent and notwithstanding every endeavor of the able  Albuquerque  effected a landing on the island The  Portuguese  defended themselves with great valor but finding the place no longer tenable their commander determined to retire He embarked with great secrecy every thing that was necessary when on the th of  May  of the same year after a sharp conflict he made good his retreat to  Rapander  a neighboring town where he resolved to winter  Osorio ii p    Zabaim  proved a brave and active enemy  Albuquerque  was more than once obliged to remove his quarters at length receiving a strong reinforcement of  Portuguese  and other supplies he renewed his attempt on  Goa  and after several sharp actions made himself again master of the city by a most fierce and bloody assault the defence being equally obstinate as the attack  FROM that moment the able Viceroy determined to make  Goa  the capital of his master's new acquired dominion in  India  he gave it every strength his military skill could suggest and every encouragement that his wisdom and commercial knowlege could invent The success was for a long series of years equal to the greatness of the design and it flourished with unrivalled splendor It became the center of the riches of  India  and one of the greatest marts in the universe At length the common consequences of wealth pride luxury effeminacy and every species of fraud cruelty and oppression possessed the minds of these once brave and gallant people they degenerated into every vile action and thought nothing wrong that brought in advantage They established here an inquisition to enslave the minds of the people They persecuted the poor natives in every shape and in every place The Abbe  Raynal  in most animated terms describes the sad change To him I refer the reader After the fall of the  Portuguese  empire in  India  a priest of  Goa  being asked when he thought his nation might again resume its power sensibly replied"As soon as your wickedness shall exceed that of my people" Let me only say that the measure of their iniquity being filled they were beaten and expelled from the very seats conquered by the intrepidity and chivalry of their ancestors and that by a small nation who sallying from the fens of  Holland  by temperance wisdom and fortitude drove from almost every part of  India  that nation whose monarchs so long had tyrannised over them in  Europe Goa  and some few places on the  Malabar  coast were left to them Most of them are now deserted and fallen to ruin  Goa  barely keeps up its head a Viceroy a man of rank is still sent here a shew of state is kept up but nothing of territory is left except the island and the two peninsulas that form the harbour The port of  Goa  is one of the finest in  India  and in the hands of the  English  or  Dutch  would be a wealthy and flourishing settlement but its commercial consequence is sunk to nothing and such is the state of  Diu  and  Damoon  if they still remain in their hands  IT was at this place that the Apostle of the  Indies  ST FRANCIS DE XAVIER  St  Francis de Xavier  landed when he undertook his great mission for the conversion of the  Hindoos  He was born at the castle  Xavier  at the foot of the  Pyrenees  in He became the friend of  Ignatius Loyola  and in concert with him laid the plan for the society of  Jesus John  III of  Portugal  by his embassador requested of  Loyola  the recommendation of certain missionaries whom he would send to  India  on the pious errand  Xavier  was named as one He landed at  Goa  on  May  His success was correspondent to his zeal he made numberless converts at  Goa Comerin Malacca  in the  Molucca  isles and in  Japan  At length in he paid the debt to nature in an isle off the coast of  China  He had the honor of canonization in The citizens of  Goa  boast of having his body in the church of  Bon Jesus  in a magnificent chapel dedicated to the saint His tomb is of black marble brought from  Lishon  with the history of his  life cut on the sides which Mr  Franklin  Travels  says is admirably executed Legend says that the body was found fifty years after his death uncorrupted on the spot he died and by them conveyed to this city To disbelieve the account would be highly penal and a crime worthy of the notice of the holy office  I HERE mention a zoological anecdote  OF THE TURKEY  to disprove the opinion that very respected friend Mr  Barrington  had taken up that the turkey was a native of  Hindoostan  see his Miscellanies p In the Memoirs of  Jehang√¨r  P translated by Francis Gladwin Esq  we are told that they were first seen at  Goa  introduced by the  Portuguese  and bought by  Mocurreb Khan  embassador of  Jehang√¨r  as a curiosity neither he or his master ever had seen before  A FEW leagues south of  Goa  is Cape  Ramas  CAPE RAMAS  Between Cape  Ramas  and  Carwar  KINGDOM OF CANHARA  in Lat ¬∞ begins the province of  Canhara  the  cisghautian  part of  Bednore  which extends along the coast two hundred and thirty miles and ends at mount  Dilla  Before  Ayder Alli  made himself master of this important tract it was little known its numerous forests its precipitous chains of mountains and the inhabitants a wild race under  Polygars  who never before had submitted to any yoke At the partition treaty at  Seringapatam  this whole province was left to  Tippoo  This says Mr  Rennel  is to be lamented but unhappily we could not retain it as we had our full share without this assumption  See Mr RENNEL's Memoir on the Map of the Peninsula of India p a most valuable explanation of the Partition Treaty  In these parts that precipitous range comes within  six miles of the sea but is never more distant than twenty Below the Cape is  Carwar  Bay  CARWAR BAY  with a town of the same name at the bottom on a river capable of receiving ships of three hundred tons The  English  had a factory here in the latter end of the last century In our present war with  Tippoo Saib  while I write this  Carwar  was wrested from him by a detachment of our army under Major  Sartorious  All the interior part is an immense forest which extends far to the south It is full of animals both the destructive and those which are of the venison kind and other objects of food Tigers and all the pantherine tribe and jackals swarm there as do great variety of elegant antelopes and deer wild cattle boars and various of the feathered tribe  THE BUFFALO  Hist Zuadr  i N  o    BUFFALO  is very frequent in this country and chiefly in a state of nature and is a chace permitted to every one It is fond of wallowing in the mud and will swim over the broadest rivers It is often seen during the inundations to dive ten or twelve feet deep to force up with its horns the aquatic plants and eat them swimming It is a very fierce animal and will with its vast horns crush to pieces any person whom it attacks the horns have been known to grow to the length of ten feet each  NEAR to the bay of  Carwar  close to the coast  ISLES OF ANCHEDIVE  are the small isles of  Anchedive  important in former times for being the place where  Cabral Albuquerque  and other illustrious commanders were used to put in to refit their ships and refresh their crews after long voyages or repulses in their attacks of some of the more powerful enemies The brave  Almeyda  built near the  shore a strong fort It observable that he found in this island amidst the ruins of certain buildings several red and black crucifixes the marks of antient christianity in  India  ABOUT thirty miles to the south of  Carwar  Bay  MERJEE  is  Merjee  This is supposed to have been the  Musiris  of  Arrian  ii p and of  Pliny  lib vi c which the latter advises his countrymen to shun as its neighborhood was infamous for its piracies It was an  emporium  but not abounding in articles of commerce In our days it has been made remarkable for having been the place in which Brigadier General  Matthews  landed in  January  with his forces from  Bombay  on an expedition which terminated so fatally to himself and so disgracefully to the  English  nation  Tippoo Sultan  had in the latter end of the year made a most destructive inroad into the  Carnatic  To divert the ravages of the tyrant was the object of the presidency of this coast  GEN MAT  EWS LANDS THERE  When the General had arrived so far he landed his troops and sent orders to the southern army under the colonels  Macleod  and  Humberston  to march and join him Before their arrival he on  January  attacked and took a few places of small consequence He then directed his views to the richest parts of  Ayder Alli  's dominions to which he was encouraged by the distance they were at that time from relief He carried the opulent town of  Onore  ONORE SACKED  which lay on the coast by storm "Every man" says an actor in the tragedy  in  Onore  was put to the sword the carnage was great we trampled thick on dead bodies that were strewed in the way It was rather shocking to humanity but such are but secondary considerations to a soldier whose bosom glows with heroic glory and  are thought only accidents of course  Lieut Hubbard's Letter    Notwithstanding this sage reflection of our hero it is said that the  Kilidar  or governor and twelve hundred men were taken prisoners  Annual Register p  these probably had retired till the bosoms of our soldiers had exhausted their  heroic ardour  Fortunately for the southern army it had not made its junction with the general and so escaped the disgrace of the massacre which probably the generous commanders had they arrived might have diverted him from  THUS strengthened  ASCENT OF THE GHAUTS  he began his toilsome ascent up the  Hussein Ghurry Ghaut  with all windings not less than three miles in extent and strongly fortified at every turning  Luckily it happened  says Mr  Sheen  that the commander knew nothing of this defile otherwise it would have been madness for him to have attempted it for if the enemy had made any tolerable defence it would have

the eleventh battalion which I belong to the light company of the  Bombay Europeans  and part of the fifteenth battalion of  Sepoys  began the attack and took the first barrier with very little opposition  WHEN we came to the second we were alarmed at the prodigious number and strong position of the enemy but finding it no less dangerous to retreat than to advance we charged home in all quarters when the motley crew gave way and fled leaving about five hundred killed and wounded  Our small body flushed with success immediately proceeded with the bayonet and never stopped till they

distance from the edge of the  Ghauts  It is the present capital of the country but since it is come into possession of  Ayder Ali  the name is changed in honor of him to  Ayder Nager  or the royal city of  Ayder  In the history of  Ayder  i  By M M D L T de la Tour General of ten thousand men in the Mogul empire and formerly commander in chief of the artillery of Ayder Ali and of a body of European troops in the service of that prince His work is not in the highest esteem  as a place of uncommon splendor beauty and magnitude with streets two leagues in length every house in the centre of a luxuriant garden filled with trees and watered with limpid streams It was the capital of the ancient kingdom of  Canhara  RANA BIDDALURA  and was called  Rana Biddalura Ayder  possessed himself of this place and the whole of the rich province  ITS HISTORY  by the following accident The son of the reigning Queen of  Canhara  fled to  Ayder  imploring his protection and his assistance to put him in possession of his kingdom which his mother kept from him in a most iniquitous manner  Ayder  acceded to his petition marched against the usurpress defeated her army and in the end reconciled the contending parties She received  Ayder  with every mark of respect and even lodged him in the royal palace Under this mask she in concert with her husband for she had married a second a  Brahmin  determined on his destruction by the most horrid means that of blowing him up in the palace with gunpowder A subordinate  Brahmin  discovered  the plot he appeared before  Ayder  in presence of the Queen the King and whole court and charged the conspirators with their crime The trial commenced on the spot the charge was proved the Queen and her husband put to death and the king confined Possibly the complaint of the son was unconstitutional for the throne of  Canhara  is said to have always been filled with a female who had the privilege of marrying whom she pleased but exempted herself from the cruel rite of burning with the body of her husband in the manner that the affectionate spouses of her subjects were accustomed to do  SEIZED BY AYDER  Ayder Alli  seized on the kingdom and all the immense treasure of the capital but what he thought of more importance was a line of coast which flattered his ambition with the hopes of becoming as invincible by sea as he had hitherto been by land  FROM the time of the storming  Onore  the General's conduct was totally altered He grew irresolute respecting his proceedings paid no attention to the plan he was to execute by the orders of the Presidency and neglected every communication with them Before this he was held in high estimation as an officer  Hon Charles Grevile British India iii p  and a man He remained a long time in a state of despondency At length actuated by a passion before latent he suddenly took the resolution of performing the service he was appointed to He ascended the  Ghaut  in the manner related He appeared before  Bednore  at that time wholly defenseless  BEDNORE SURRENDERED  It was then governed by  Hyat Saib  a person of consummate abililities and firm fidelity towards his master He reflected on the  impossibility of resistance and the danger of having both the province and city desolated by the rage of the conqueror He secretly sent to  Matthews  as soon as he had entered the plains to offer to surrender the place and to deliver to the  English  all the treasures on condition that the persons and property of the inhabitants should be secured and himself continued in the government under the  English  with all the power he had under  Ayder  Matthews  now in possession of the treasures of ages and dazzled by the heaps of the gems of  Hindoostan  such strong temptations rose in view as instantly to dissipate every virtuous idea he might before have possessed Avarice and rapacity occupied their seats and he rose like the fiend  Mammon  with all his attributes The General seized on all the treasures and imprisoned  Hyat Saib  He as suddenly released him and made to him a pretended restitution of all his wealth  Lieut Sheen's Letter in Capt Oake's Narrative p  Strong suspicions of the General's conduct pervaded the army To allay their murmurs he prevaled on  Hyat Saib  to present the troops with about the value of twenty thousand pounds in  pagodas  He had also quarreled with  Macleod Mackenzie Humberston  and major  Shaw  after the capture of  Bednore  on the subject of precedency with the company's troops They quitted the army and hastened to  Bombay  to lay their complaints before the Presidency Their absence was most fatally missed The General now for the first time sent dispatches to the Presidency filled with false statements of affairs and complaints against the army from the generals to the very common men  AT  Bednore  he found to a patriotic commander a more important acquisition than any treasures  VAST MAGAZINES FOUNDRY c  All  Ayder  's principal magazines a very fine foundry for brass cannon a powder manufactory and immense stores of every kind  Hon Charles Grevile's British India iii p    Matthews  did not make a true estimate of this species of treasure his avarice made him neglect his security yet he weakened his army by making detachments to every place where the prospect of plunder could allure him He neglected the strong passes into the  Mysore  which secured he might have rested safely against all the efforts of the returning  Tippoo  Among other places he sent a detachment to  Annampour  a strong fort adjacent to  Bednore  ANNAMPOUR  which  Ayder  had made the dep√¥t of the rest of his treasure The place was taken by storm Let Lieutenant  Sheen  relate the disgraceful event  When a practicable breach was effected orders were issued for a storm and no quarters which was immediately put in execution  HORRID CRUELTIES  and every man put to the sword except one horseman who made his escape after being wounded in three different places A dreadful sight then presented itself above four hundred beautiful women either killed or wounded with the bayonet expiring in one another's arms while the private soldiers were committing every kind of outrage and plundering them of their jewels the officers not being able to restrain them  Sheen's Narrative p    THE troops were however afterwards  severely reprimanded  for it I had almost forgot to mention that some of the women rather than be torn from their relations threw  themselves into large tanks where they were drowned  The pretence for these brutalities was that the garrison an  uncivilized  people had acted in contradiction to the rules of war among  civilized  nations After the specimen we gave here I fear the idea of the civilization the  British  had arrived at will not rise to any great height  Matthews  suppressed in his dispatches all accounts of this or similar transactions and also of the vast treasures We are beholden to private letters for the history One officer was so shocked at one he had written that he tore it to pieces Lieut  Sheen  was not so delicate All these shameful relations have been contradicted yet still as Sir  Thomas Brown  expresses they are among those  verities we fear and heartily wish there was no truth therein  THE General  MANGGALORE TAKEN  now in imaginary security descended the  Ghaut  to effect new conquests in the maritime country He laid siege to  Mangalore  A practicable breach was soon effected which the gallant governor  Rustan Alli beg  could not persuade hid timid garrison to defend so he was compelled to surrender A few years after he unjustly lost his head in sight of the city by order of his cruel master  Tippoo Sultan  AT  Mangalore  the General received intelligence that  Tippoo  was in full march from the  Carnatic  to relieve his country After the receipt of the news his mind grew quite disordered He reascended the  Ghaut  and reentered  Bednore  In a few days the enemy appeared His forces were so numerous that they not only covered the adjacent plains but even every hill and more remote than the eye could reach  Matthews  in a frenzy marched out with his handful of men and  met the expected fate was at once defeated with the loss of five hundred men He made his retreat into  Bednore  which he bravely defended seventeen days but finding the garrison reduced by sickness and the number of slain  BEDNORE RETAKEN  he capitulated on honorable terms The garrison to be allowed the honors of war but to pile the arms on the glacis to retain all private property and to restore all public c c  Tippoo  took possession of the city Notwithstanding his situation the avarice of the General overcame every consideration He ordered the officers to make unlimited drafts on the paymaster who had before been greatly exhausted by various contrivances It was currently believed that he had sent by his brother to  Goa  three hundred thousand pounds and a great quantity of diamonds to be remitted to  Bombay  and that even on the point of his departure he had caused the  bamboos  of his  palanquin  to be pierced and filled with  pagodas  When  Tippoo  examined the state of his treasury he grew enraged at this infamous fraud he declared the treaty void put the officers and their  Sepoys  faithful to them to the last indiscriminately in irons and marched them in that condition in a burning sun to prisons at  Scringapatam  and other places Numbers fell dead on the road the remainder arrived at the place of their destination in the utmost misery and that increased by the wretched dungeons they were confined in Those who perished were nightly flung over the walls and in  Chitteldroog  the survivors heard the tigers gorging themselves with the corpses of their happier friends  Lieut Sheen's Narrative p    THE General was confined at  Seringapatam  THE GENERAL POISONED  where he was not suffered to linger long Various are the accounts given of the manner of his end but the most probable is that it was by poison Numbers of his officers suffered in the same manner in different places and died in the greatest agonies His brother  ALSO OTHERS  who unfortunately returned from his journey to  Goa  and a Mr  Weldon  were taken into the jungles and had their throats cut Numbers of the unhappy men fated to die by the poisonous draught abstained from food for many days till despair and hunger compelled them to take the fatal draught Others who by delay made the executioners impatient had the poison forced down their throats My pity is suspended for as many as might have been guilty of the barbarity at  Annampour  was it possible they could have been accessary to the savage fury of their troops stained in every part of the expedition with slaughter cruelty fraud rapine and avarice  Annual Register p    IT is evident that the severities exercised by  Tippoo  after this victory was  here  the determined resolution of inflicting a just punishment but unhappily he included in it the innocent as well as guilty After his defeat of Colonel  Braithwaite  on the banks of the  Coleroon  how different was his conduct he considered  Matthews  as the sordid adventurer  Braithwaite  as the generous enemy and treated him and the wounded captives with a humanity that shewed his coolness and capacity of

most grand but visionary plan not only of becoming sovereign of the  Indian  seas but of even retaliating on the  English  the several invasions they had made into  India  In order to become a naval power he invited shipwrights from all countries and under them trained a number of his own subjects He had in his own dominions abundance of materials and he fixed on  Mangalore  as his great dock and military naval port He has hitherto been unfortunate In the place was taken by a sleet sitted out from  Bombay  and nine great ships and several lesser were brought away  Annual Register p    Ayder  soon recovered his port and irritated at the disgrace redoubled his efforts to restore his navy and carry his great design into execution By the year he had almost finished six ships of the line and

of the bastions and only eighteen miles intervened between him and the grand army commanded by Lord  Cornwallis  ready to invest  Seringapatam  the residence of  Tippoo  The  Sultan  exerted every

roads and brought a battering train and a large supply of provisions and stores over fifty miles of woody mountains called  Ghauts  that immense barrier which separates the  Mysore  country from the

 Pliny  gives a very long list of the persumes used by the  Romans  They were mostly pomatums and consequently not the most  delicate The variety was endless and some of the ingredients would seem now very singular They anointed themselves with some kinds to suppress the rank smell of their bodies and often to prevent the effects of their intemperance and excess in meats and drinks being too sensibly perceived  Dioscorides  and  Pliny  say that the vegetable which yielded this perfume was a certain waterplant that floated on the surface like what we call duckmeat  Gerard  p called it

India  the knowledge of its vegetable kingdom can only be learned from the number of books expressly written on the subject yet in the course of this topography I shall incidentally give a brief account of the most singular or the most useful In this place I shall detain the reader a little longer than usual to mention the useful  Bamboo  BAMBOO REED  a reed which is found frequent in the country It is the retreat of tigers panthers bears and other beasts of prey and the haunt of infinite numbers and varieties of the monkey tribe Botanists style it  Arundo Bambos  and  Arundo arbor  it is an evergreen The stem is of a vivid green but as it grows older becomes of a duller color I refer to the  Syslema Plantarum  for the synonyms  Rumphius  iv describes but does not give its figure In the  Hortus Malaharicus  i tab it is found under the title of  Ily Bamboo  is not the  Indian  name but one imposed on it by the  Portuguese  from the violent explosion the hollows give on being set on fire occasioned by the confined air little inferior to that of a piece of artillery This plant grows to a prodigious height so as to overtop all trees of  the forest and its circumference so great as to occasion hyperbolical exaggeration  Pliny  says that the joints of those which grew about the  Acesines  are so large that a single one is sufficent to make a boat  Navigiorum etiam vicem praestant si credimus singula internodia  Pliny  seems to credit the relation and  Acosta  Aromatum liber an author of credit informs us that he had frequently seen them in use on the river near  Cranganor  on this coast and that they were capable of carrying two  Indians  one sate on each end with their knees joined and each carried a short oar or paddle with which they rowed with vast rapidity and even against the stream The honorable  Edward Monkton  who had been at  Goa  has assured me that the above must have been a mistake The largest joint he ever saw which always grows at the bottom of the plant was not two feet in length and about the thickness of a stout man's leg  THE  bamboo  is subservient to other uses similar but far more important The reed formed into a frame and covered with skin becomes a boat of the same sort with the  British  coracles or rather the  vitilia navigia  in which the  Britons  even crossed our narrow seas  Tour in Wales i    Ayder Alli  had great numbers which he carried with him in his campaigns those frames were carried by two men and the skins by two more and in a quarter of an hour they were ready for use one of these vessels was capable of containing twentyfive men or a piece of cannon with which they crossed any rivers they found in their march  Hist of Ayder Alli i  As to the horses they swim by the side of the coracle held by the horseman who is in the boat by the bridle in the same  manner as the  Scots  pass their nags over the narrow arms of the sea  Voy Hebrides last edit p Lucan lib iv    IT is pretended that these canes are so disliked by the crocodiles that they never seize on the navigators as the sharks in  Greenland  do on the poor  Greenlanders  whom they bite in two secured as they seem to be in their canoes  IN most places the joints are used as pitchers to carry water and some will contain sufficient to supply the family for the whole day From this use it is named the  Arundarbor Vasaria  AT the siege of  Mangalore Tippoo Sultan  mounted his spears on light  bamboos  a hundred and fortyseven feet long and made his desperadoes mount the breaches and under the fire of his artillery assail the brave garrison inflicting distant and unexpected wounds or death  Wars in Asia i    IN  China  the joints perforated serve as pipes for conveyance of water and in the same country by macerating them the  Chinese  make their paper both coarse and fine split into slender lengths this cane is of much use in making mats In short its uses are innumerable  THEY are often made use of for frames of houses for which their ready sissibility and their lightness peculiarly adapt them  THEY are greatly searched after as poles to carry burthens but particularly for the poles of  Palanquins  for this purpose they are bent while growing to give them a proper curvature and when richly carved as they often are are sold at a vast  price in the luxurious  Coromandel  and other parts  Linscofan  and M

very frequent even in the  European  courts  THIS reed is also called  Mambu  and was celebrated in early times by the  Arabian  physicians for producing from its joints a sort of inspissated juice of a sweet taste called  Tabaxar  TABAXAR  and  Sacar Mambu  It often grows dry and is discovered by its rattling within the hollow of the reed  ‚Ä† Acosta in Elus Exot  It was a famed medicine with all the  Orientalists  in outward and inward heats bilious fevers and other disorders of that nature and in dysenteries and it was reckoned peculiarly efficacious in discharges of coagulated blood so frequently left in internal wounds These uses made it once a great article of export from the  Malabar  ports The  Brahmins  also use this  Sacar  in their medical prescriptions  IN this hot country the reed is often applied to another use adapted to refresh the exhausted native it is bent so as to form arbours and cool walks of considerable length delicious retreats from the rays of the vertical sun Finally the application of it as an instrument of punishment in  China  at lest of the most  severe nature It is used as the bastinado and often till death ensues in the most cruel manner  SUGAR was originally brought from  India  SUGAR  by the introduction of the plant the  Saccharum Officinarum  I shall here give some account of this useful article and its various removals from its native place into  Europe  where it was for some ages cultivated with great success "  Arabia  " says  Pliny  lib xii c "produces  Sacearon  but the best is in  India  " It is a honey  collected from reeds a sort of white gum brittle between the teeth the largest pieces do not exceed the size of a hazel nut and it is used only in medicine  THE cane was an article of commerce in very early times  ANTIQUITY OF  The prophets  Isaiah  Ch xlv  and  Jeremiah  Ch vi  make mention of it "Thou hast brought me no sweet cane with money" says the first and the second  To what purpose cometh there to me the sweet cane from a far country  Brought for the luxury of the juice either extracted by suction or by some other means In the note on the elegant poem the  Sugar  Cane  Note in Book ix  Doctor  Grainger  informs us that at first the raw juice was made use of they afterwards boiled it into a syrup and in process of time an inebriating spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation  SUGAR was first made from the reed in  Egypt  ITS REMOVALS  from thence the plant was carried into  Sicily  which in the twelfth century supplied many parts of  Europe  with that commodity and from thence at a period unknown it was probably brought into  Spain  by the  Moors  From  Spain  the reed was planted in the  Canary  islands and in the  Madeira  by the  Portuguese  This happened about the year In the same year  Ferdinand  the Catholic ordered the cane to be carried from the  Canaries  to St  Domingo  From those islands the art of making sugar was introduced into the islands of  Hispaniola  and in about the year into the  Brazils  the reed itself growing spontaneously in both those countries Till that time sugar was a most expensive luxury and used only as Mr  Anderson  observes in feasts and physical necessities  I SHALL here anticipate the account of the state of sugar in  Spain  where in  Europe  it first became stationary  INTO SPAIN  borrowing it from the ninth volume of my Outlines of the Globe It was till of late years cultivated to great advantage in the kingdom of  Granada  and great quantities of sugar made in the  ingenios  or mills In the year in the city of  Mesril  were eight hundred families Their principal commerce was in sugars and syrups made in four sugar works from the plantations of canes which reached from the south side down to the sea side but these and the other sugar works are greatly decayed by reason of the excessive duties This with the increased demand for sugar on the prevaling use of chocolate in the kingdom which requires double the quantity of that article has occasioned a drain of a million of dollars out of the country in payment for sugar preserves and other confectionaries This is very extraordinary considering that  Spain  is possessed of some of the sinest sugar islands besides the power of manufacturing it within its home dominions  Uztariz ii ch    I NOW digress several leagues to the west  LACCADIVE ISLES  to the  Laccadive  isles a considerable group the centre of which is nearly opposite  to  Tellicherry  They extend from Lat ¬∞ to ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ north are low and not to be seen farther than six or seven leagues These are supposed to be the isles intended by  Ptolemy  by the title of  Insulae Numero  XIX but in fact they are thirtytwo all of them small and covered with trees and rocky on their sides mostly as if laid on a bottom of sand attended with reefs and the channels between them are very deep They are commonly navigated by our ships in their way to the  Persian  Gulph or the  Red  Sea That called the ix¬Ω degree channel or the passage between the most southern of the  Laccadives  the isle of  Malique  and that called  Mamala  or the viii degree channel between the isle of  Malique  and the most northern of the  Maldive  isles are those which are in use Each island has its name Captain  Cornwal  says that called  Calpenia  has a river where ships of two hundred tons may float and clean  THE principal traffic of these isles is in the products of the coco trees such as the oil the cables and cordage and in fish which is dried and sent to the continent of  India  from whence they get rice c in return They also trade to  Mascat  in large boats and carry there the same commodities and bring back dry and wet dates  AMBERGRISE  and a little coffee Ambergrise is found often floating off these isles  Hamilton  mentions a piece in possession of a certain  Rajah  valued at ¬£ sterling It is now generally supposed to be a mineral  Cronsted  at lest ranks it among them the best is of a grey color is a strong perfume and is also much used in medicine It is highly esteemed as a cordial and in nervous complaints and in extremities is administered often as a persuasive to the soul not to quit its earthly tenement  A Captain  Coffin  engaged in the southern or  Guinea  whale fishery found in a female spermaceti whale three hundred and sixty ounces of ambergrise This is said not to be unusual but then it always is in fickly emaciated fishes These instances do not prove that it was the production of the spermaceti whale the food of which is  squids  or the  sepia  many of the horny beaks were found adhering to the ambergrise or immersed in that soft substance It appears to me that the whales sometimes swallow it that it disagrees with them and acts as a sort of poison bringing on a decay and death and that the parts of the  sepia  found lodged in it are the undissolved remains lodged in the ambergrise Mr  Cossin  sold his prize at nineteen shillings and nine pence per ounce This is related in Phil Trans lxxxi p  MIDWAY between these isles and those of the  Maldives  ISLE OF MALIQUE  is the isle of  Malique  a small low and solitary spot surrounded with breakers seated in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ north It is inhabited and dependent on a  Rajah  on the  Malabar  coast A large shallop of twentytwo oars came off to a  French India  ship in among the people were three who appeared of rank and who very politely offered their services to the  European  officer  THE  Maldive  islands are to the south of the last  MALDIVE ISLANDS  They extend from north to south inclining a little to the southeast from Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ to a little more than Lat ¬∞ These are the most singular and numerous groups of isles in the world From their number  Ptolemy  names them  Insulae  MCCCLXXVIII The  Nubian  Geographer calls these isles  Robaihat  THE two  Mahometan  travellers of the ninth century make them amount to nineteen hundred and the sea which surrounds them and lies to the northwest of them they called the  Harchend  sea The natives make the number of their isles amount to twelve thousand They were discovered in by the younger  Almeyda  and conquered by the  Portuguese  from the  Moors  who had usurped the sovereignty of them from the natives who probably came originally from the adjacent  Malabar  The  Europeans  did not long maintain possession The  Portuguese  had obtained leave to erect a fort on one of the isles but they were soon cut off by the  Maldivians  and their fort demolished  THEY are divided into thirteen  Attollons  or provinces and are governed by one king but each  Attollon  has its particular governor who rules with great oppression The subjects are miserably poor and none dare wear any cloathing above the waist except a turband without a particular license The king assumes the magnificent title of  Sultan  of the  Maldives  king of thirteen provinces and twelve thousand isles From Mr  Dalrymple  's chart of the  Maldives  they seem divided into thirteen groups each pretty nearly equidistant and each with their proper name their form is most singular they are represented as reefs of small and very low islands regular in their form and surrounding a clear space of sea with a very shallow portion of water between them The chief is called  Atoll Maldivas  they have only four ports in which their few articles of commerce are collected  ONE article is the  Cowry  a small species of shell  TRADE IN COWRY SHELLS  the  Cyproea Moneta  of  Linnaeus D'Argenville  tab xviii fig K It is very singular that many parts of the world should for ages past be obliged to these little and remote islands for their specie and that the contemptible shells of the  Maldives  prove the price of mankind and contribute to the vilest of traffic in  Negroland  but so it is These shells are collected twice in the month at full and new moon It is the business of the women who wade up to their middle to gather them They are packed up in parcels of twelve thousand each and are the current money among the poor in  Bengal  A  Cowry  is rated there at the hundred and sixtieth part of a penny so that it is impossible to find a coin so small as to be of use to the poor in a country where provisions are so exceedingly cheap eighty  Cowries  make a  pun  and from fifty to sixty  puns  the value of a  roupee  or four shillings and sixpence  English  They are reexported to  England France  c and from those places again to  Guinea  as the price of the unhappy natives  Hamilton  i mistakes the manner of gathering them when he says  The natives fling into the sea branches of coco trees to which the shells adhere and are collected every four or five months  The exchange for them from  Bengal  is rice butter and cloth which is brought from that country in small vessels fitted for the shallow navigations  THESE islands as well as the  Laccadives  have besides a brisk trade with the western coasts of  India  chiefly in coco nuts and the several manufactures from that useful article Among which the  Kaiar  or cables and ropes made of the filaments of the nuts have a vast sale on all the coast of  India  FISH is another article  IN FISH  the species is said to be chiefly the  Bonito  or  Scomber Pelamys  These annually migrate among the isles in  April  and  May  They are caught both by hook and net are split and the bone taken out sprinkled with sea water and set to dry then put into the sand wrapt up in coco leaves and placed a foot or two below the surface where they become as hard as stockfish Vessels come from  Atcheen  in the isle of  Sumatra  with gold dust to purchase this necessary which is again sold there at the rate of ¬£ per thousand  THE coco tree is the only one which these isles do produce for they are universally sandy and barren Of this the inhabitants build vessels of twenty or thirty tons The cables ropes sails and every individual part is made of this tree which even supplies the sirewood and provision oil for their kitchens and lamps sugar and candied sweetmeats and strong cloth  THEY are furnished with water from wells which they dare not sink deeper than five or six feet otherwise the salt water will percolate through the sand On them they depend nor do these ever fail  Ali Rajah  of  Cananore  and High Admiral of  Ayder Alli  made a conquest of these isles took the king captive and cruelly put out his eyes In this state he presented him to  Ayder  who highly disapproving of the barbarity deprived the  Rajah  of the command of the fleet and treated the unhappy prince with the utmost humanity gave him a palace and settled on him a revenue to supply him with every pleasure he was capable of tasting  Hist of Ayder Alli i  The poets of  Ayder  's court added to his title on this  occasion "  King of the islands of the sea  " and in their poems placed him above  Alexander  and  Tamerlane  Let me here say that he had his poetlaureat always resident who had a stipend of a thousand  roupees  a month and the rank of a general of a thousand men  Hist Ayder Alli i    PART of the inhabitants profess  Paganism  part  Mahometism  the first retained from the original Their language is  Cingalese  or that of  Ceylon  Hamilton i  which points out their primoeval stock As to  Mahometism  it is a more modern religion derived from the  Moors  Some bury their dead others burn them like the  Hindoos  but  Knox  our best authority says that the poor only inter the rich commit them to the funeral pile  Hist Ceylon    Hamilton  saw on one island certain tombs "sculptured" says he "with as great variety of figures as he ever saw in  Europe  "  To return to the continent A few leagues below  Mah√®  SACRIFICE ROCK  at a small distance from the coast is the  Sacrifice Rock  supposed to have received its name from certain  Portuguese  taken by some of the neighboring cruizers of  Cottica  and on that rock made victims to the revenge of the  Indians  ¬ß Hamilton i p    THE city of  Calicut  seated in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤  CITY OF CALICUT  stands about eight leagues to the south of the  Rock of Sacrifice  This place is celebrated as being the first land in  India  which the  Europeans  ever saw after the long interval of the  Roman  commerce Here the great  Gama  on  May  first saw the fertile risings and plains of  Malabar  backed by the lofty  Ghauts  rise before him Mr  Dalrymple  in one of his plates gives a view of what it now  is and in respect to its natural situation what it must have been at that time The works of art are too minute to be perceptible amidst the bold and eternal operations of nature  Calicut  was at that time the greatest  emporium  of all  India  ITS ANTIENT TRADE  The commerce of the  Arabs  with this port was prodigious Pretious stones pearls amber ivory  China  ware gold and silver silks and cottons indigo sugar spices valuable woods perfumes beautiful varnishes and whatever adds to the luxuries of life were brought there from all parts of the east Some of these rich commodities came by sea but as navigation was neither so safe nor pursued with so much spirit as it hath been since a great part of them was conveyed by land on the backs of oxen and elephants  ALL its splendor and all its opulence was owing to commerce yet the houses were mean but not crowded detached from each other and surrounded with delicious gardens none were built of stone but the royal palace which rose with great magnificence above the other buildings The town was very extensive and very populous  AT the arrival of the  Portuguese  it was governed by a monarch  THE ZAMOREEN  called the  Zamorin  who like a lord paramount had all the other princes of  Malabar  as tributaries The account as related by the  Portuguese  historians is that six hundred years before the arrival of  Gama  or about the year  Perimal  reigned supreme over the whole country In his old age he became a convert to  Mahometism  and determined to resign his dominions to his relations and finish his days at the holy city of  Medina  His successors retained the antient religion and are considered as chief of the  Nayrs  I will relate the tale in the

but the jealousy of the  Arabs  prevented his friendship with the  Zamorin  from being of any duration The  Portuguese  never could make themselves masters of the place but at length  Albuquerque  in    SEIZED BY ALBUQUERQUE  prevaled on the reigning prince to permit him to build a fort not far from the city This gave him the command of the commerce notwithstanding the city remained under the line of its antient rulers who very frequently were engaged in wars with their  European  neighbors The  English  had their factories here but I believe have long since deserted the place As to the  Portuguese  they became so distressed by the union of the  Dutch  with the  Zamorin  that they blew up their fortress and entirely quitted the neighborhood It was afterwards either undermined with the sea or overthrown by an earthquake for  Hamilton  says that in his ship which drew twentyone feet water struck on its ruins  Ayder Alli  advanced towards this town  BY AYDER ALLI  It was voluntarily surrendered to him by the  Zamorin  who prostrated himself at his feet and presented him with two basons of gold one filled with pieces of gold the other with pretious stones and two small cannons of gold with golden carriages of the same metal  Ayder  raised him from the ground and promised to restore to him his dominions on condition of paying a small tribute The two princes parted seemingly in perfect amity The next day the palace appeared on fire In desiance of all attempts to save it it was wholly destroyed and with it perished the prince his family and vast treasures The  Zamorin  had just received letters from the  Hindoo Rajahs  of  Travancore  and  Cochin  bitterly reproaching him with betraying his country to the  Mahometans  and becoming apostate to his religion declaring him degraded and expelled from his cast So affected was he with the  disgrace that he determined on the fatal JOAR see page and by that rite made the horrible expiation  Life of Ayder Alli i    IN the year  BY MAJOR ABINGTON  this city was taken by Major  Abington  He was superseded in his command by Colonel  Humberston  The environs were at that time in possession of the enemy under  Mugdum Saheb  a general of  Ayder  's The youthful hero panting after glory sallied forth with a handful of men and gave him a total defeat  Mugdum  several principal officers and between three and four hundred men fell in the action His forces consisted of three thousand foot and near a thousand horse "I am ashamed" says the modest victor  to name the number of my troops they were so few that you will think me rash to have ventured an action In consequence the enemy evacuated all the country which belonged to the  Zamorin  whom I restored to his possessions  British India iii    Paniani  is a town a few miles farther where the  English  had once a settlement  PANIANI  What makes it particularly remarkable is that the  Ghauts  opposite to the place have in them a gap between fourteen and fifteen miles in length and about sixteen miles in width occupied chiefly by forest trees and is defended by the forts of  Annamally  and  Palicaudcherry  and others It being the important pass to and from the  Malabar  coast and of late years has been very frequently the seat of action In the campaign of the forts of  Annamally  and  Palicaudcherry  were taken by that most able officer Colonel  Fullarton  who knew how to conquer and knew how to record his actions  VIII PALICAUDCHERRY  The last was completely rebuilt by  Ayder  since the war of with the  English  and was furnished with all the advantages of  European  construction and defence and attended with every difficulty of approach from forests intersections of the  Paniani  river and deep rice grounds yet on the th of  November  by the conduct of the commander and the valor of his troops it was surrendered by a garrison of four thousand men after a long and desperate defence  Fullarton's Campaigns p  It was afterwards evacuated but by the partition treaty reserved to us with other accessions which gave entrance into  Dindigul  and our interior acquisitions Let me not omit that at  Palatchy  not remote from  Palicaudcherry

Meadows  's army marched from  Dindigul  toward the coast westward to clear the country of enemies and favor the great attack on  Tippoo Sultan  He descended the  Ghauts  by the  Paniani  gap reached the coast gained a most brilliant victory over one of the  Sultan  's generals at  Tervannagurry  on  December  and completely broke the enemy's force on the west of the  Ghauts  He took  Turuckabad  the capital of the country continued his march northward to  Cananore  joined General  Abercromby  and shared with him the fatigues and glory of the campaigns of and It is a break between the northern

northeast  Monsoons  ships at some distance at sea as soon as they come within the openings feel the fierce effect of the wind which pours on them with vast fury but before they reach the line of the gap and when they have passed it the stillest calm succeeds  THE river  Paniani  rises from the northeast in the  Coimbotore  country  COIMBOTORE COUNTRY  and passes through the breach and in the rainy season is navigable for small boats to the foot of the  Ghauts  Its source is from an elevated plain sixty miles in extent rising suddenly out of the surrounding country like a vast terrace and faces the great gap Such are common in  India  and are features almost peculiar to the country  TWENTYfive miles south of  Paniani  is  Cranganore  CRANGANORE  the northern frontier of the  Rajahship  of  Travencore  When  Gama  arrived on this coast he was surprised with a visit of certain deputies from that city informing him that they were like him  Christians  and requesting to be taken under the protection of his great master  Emmanuel Gama  received them with the utmost affection and assured them he should recommend their interests to the  Portuguese  Admirals  Osorio lib i p  whom he should leave on the coast After his departure a quarrel happened between them and the  Zamorin  A ship loaden with spices was on its way from  Calicut  to  Cranganore  such was the avarice of the  Portuguese  that they could not resist making it a prize The nephew of the  Zamorin  who was their warm  friend represented to them the danger of offending his uncle and at the same time assured them that the cargo was designed to be disposed of to them All was in vain they took the ship and slew some of the crew The nephew demanded satisfaction but his remonstrances were received with contempt  Lopez Soarez  a  Portuguese  admiral came into  India  about this time with thirteen ships He found that the  Zamorin  and the citizens of  Cranganore  were preparing to revenge the injuries done them He sailed for that port landed his men and assisted by the King of  Cochin  attacked the  Indian  army gained a complete victory and pursued the fugitives into the city and set it on fire  BURNT  It was to no purpose that the  Christian  inhabitants entreated the conquerors to spare their churches They did indeed attempt to quench the flames but to no purpose for very few of the places of worship escaped This happened in The  Portuguese  built a strong fort near the spot about a league up the river or channel which is not above a quarter of a mile broad but very deep yet on the bar at springtides had not above fourteen feet of water A new city arose but the  Indians  rebuilt it at some distance from the antient site and it became one of the sinest in  India  A channel divides it from another narrow isle which is about four leagues long and runs north and south parallel with the main land Another channel divides it from that of  Cochin  The  Dutch  under Commodore  Goens  made themselves masters of  Cranganore  in without meeting the lest resistance The  Portuguese  enervated with luxury and detested for their cruelty  in a single year lost every one of their possessions in  Malabar  to their antient foes who succeeded to their wealth and power supported by wisdom oeconomy and valor As soon as they were masters of the place they prohibited all boats or vessels from entering at the two channels determined to prevent surprise and illicit trade  THIS city was distinguished by two most remarkable circumstances  JEWS IN INDIA  the one to begin with the most antient was its having been the residence of a republic of  Jews  part of the tribe of  Manassch  who had been carried into captivity by  Nebuchadnezzar  who sent numbers of them to this distant place Their history says that they amounted to twenty thousand and that they were three years in travelling to this place from the time of their setting out from  Babylon  When they arrived they were treated with great humanity by the natives and allowed every indulgence in both religious and temporal concerns In process of time they grew so wealthy as to purchase the little kingdom of  Cranganore Hamilton  i p p makes them increase to eighty thousand families but in his days they were reduced to four thousand They established a commonwealth and selected the two sons of one of the first families eminent for their wisdom to govern them jointly One of them instigated by ambition murdered his brother after which the commonwealth became a democracy and their territory many centuries ago returned into the hands of the natives Powerful as they were they are at present very poor and few Numbers of them had removed to  God  where they were greatly encouraged by the  Zamorin  of the time They have to this  day a synagogue near the king's palace at a small distance from  Cochin  where are preserved their records engraven on copper plates in  Hebrew  characters and when any of the characters decay they are new cut so that they can shew their history from the reign of  Nebuchadnezzar  to the present time The  Maecenas  of  Malabar  M  von Rheede  caused these records to be translated into low  Dutch  The perusal would be very desirable I trust that these plates were not forgeries to impose on the curious governor as the famous inscription on the death of the  Danish  monarch  Hardicanute  at  Lambeth  was by a witty wag which so capitally deceived the first antiquaries of our days  See European Magazine Vol xvii    THAT St  Thomas  preached the Gospel in  India  CHRISTIANS IN INDIA  I make no doubt He first visited the isle of  Socotora  after performing the orders of his Divine Master he passed through the several kingdoms which intervened between that isle and  Jerusalem  From  Socotora  he landed at  Cranganore  where he continued some time and made numbers of proselytes and in all probability established a church government From thence he visited the eastern parts of  India  and met with martyrdom at  Meliapour  where we shall resume the history of this great Apostle  THOSE  Christians  on the  Malabar  coast grew into a potent people but if we may credit  Marco Polo  p there was in the centre of  India  a country called  Abasia  divided into seven kingdoms three of which were  Mahometan  the other four  Christian  The  Christians  distinguished themselves by a golden cross worn over their forcheads but the  Jews  who were among them were marked on their checks with a hot iron  BUT what weighs greatly with me concerning the truth of the existence of the  Indian Christians  OR CHRISTIANS OF ST THEMAS  or  Christians  of St  Thomas  as they are usually called is that the knowlege of them had reached  England  as early as the ixth century  KNOWN IN ENGLAND IN  for we are certain that our great  Alsred  in consequence of a vow sent  Sigh  m  II in the year Bishop of  Sherbourn  first to  Rome  and afterwards to  India  with alms to the  Christians  of the town of  Saint Thomas  now  Mcliapour  who returned with various rich gems some of which were to be seen in the church of  Sherbourn  according to  William of Malmsbury  lib ii even in his days I have not extent of faith to favour the legend of the place of the martyrdom of the saint which was fixed by pious historians to have been at St  Thomas  on the  Coromandel  coast of which the reader will find an account in the following volume  THE rites and customs of these  Christians  differ in several respects from those of the church of  Rome  THEIR RITES  In some they accord which makes me imagine there might have been some accidented communication of the nature of that I have mentioned above  Osorio  i gives an account of their ceremonies Speaking of the  Christians  of  Cranganore  he thus goes on  The  Christians  who reside here are generally very poor and their churches of a mean appearance They keep the sabbath in the same manner as we do in hearing sermons and performing other religious duties The high priest whom  they acknowleged as the head of their church had his seat near some mountains towards the north in a country called  Chaldaeis  He has a council composed of twelve cardinals two bishops and several priests With the assistance of these he settles all affairs relating to religion and all the  Christians  in these parts acquiesce in his decrees The priests are shaved in such a manner as to represent a cross on their crowns They administer the sacrament in both kinds making use of the juice of pressed grapes by way of wine and allow the laity to partake of both but no one is admitted to this solemn ordinance till he has made a confession of his iniquities They baptized not their infants till they were forty days old except in danger of death When any one amongst them is seized with a fit of sickness the priest immediately visits him and the sick person is greatly animated by the holy man's supplications When they enter their churches they sprinkle themselves with holy water They use the same form of burial as in other catholic countries the relations of the deceased give great entertainments which last a week during which time they celebrate his praises and put up prayers for his eternal happiness They preserve the sacred writings in the  Syrian  or  Chaldaean  language with great carefulness and their teachers are ready in all public places to instruct every one They keep the  Advent Sunday  and the forty days of  Lent  with great strictness and observe most of the festivals which we have in our church with the same exactness They compute their time likewise in the same manner as we do adding a day to every fourth year The  first day of  July  is kept as a holiday in honor of St  Thomas  not only by these  Christians  but many of the  Pagans  also There are likewise convents for the priests and nunneries for their women who adhere to their vows of chastity with the utmost probity Their priests are allowed to marry once but excluded from taking a second wife Marriages amongst other people cannot be annulled but by the death of one of the parties When a woman becomes a widow she forfeits her dowry if married within a twelvemonth after the death of her husband These are the customs and manners which the  Christians  in  Cranganore  as well as many other parts of  India  have observed with the utmost fidelity from the time of St  Thomas  WHEN  Gama  arrived on this coast there were about two hundred thousand of them in the southern parts of  Malabar  during thirteen hundred years they had been under the Patriarch of  Babylon  who appointed their  Metarene  or Archbishop They were extremely averse to the doctrine of St  Francis de Xavier  when he came among them and abhorred the worship of images which they considered as idolatry They refused to acknowlege the Pope's supremacy and at length were persecuted as heretics with all the horrors of the inquisition newly established at  Goa Xavier  had never troubled his new converts with any instruction nor ever instilled into them any knowlege of the principles of the  Christian  religion any farther than implicit obedience to the head of the church He gave them crucifixes to worship and told them they were then sure of heaven His preaching was subservient to the political interests  of his country his abilities and his labors for that end were amazing In him appeared all the powers which in after times gave to his order that vast importance in the affairs of the universe I will conclude this article with saying that out of the fifty thousand inhabitants found in  Bednore  when  Ayder Alli  took possession of it thirty thousand were  Christians  "who" says his historian i p  were endowed with great privileges  Cranganore  and a fort on the opposite side of the river named  Jacotta  gave rise to the important war of the  Mysore  They had been taken from the  Portuguese  by the  Dutch  and possessed by the last a hundred and fifty years  Ayder Alli  seeing the conveniency of  Cranganore  to his  Mysorean  kingdom in seized and garrisoned it In the ensuing war the  Dutch  repossessed themselves of it In  Tippoo Sultan  the successor of  Ayder  determined to make himself master of it in right of his father He raised a mighty army which so alarmed the  Dutch  that they resolved to dispose of the two forts to the  Rajah  of  Travancore  an ally of the  English  in order to divert the storm from themselves  Tippoo  marched with his forces and attacked the lines of  Travancore  The battle between his army and that of the  Rajah  the latter in defence of  Cranganore  on  May  was the signal of the general war on which commenced the first campaign in  June  following The conclusion of that glorious war was the putting us in possession of the whole coast from  Caroor  as far as mount  Dilly  a tract of a hundred and twenty miles This is the result of the partition treaty  Cochin  lies in Lat  COCHIN  ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ N on the southern side of the channel on an island opposite to another that stretches to the south It is a  Rajahship  possibly dependent on that of  Travancore  who seems to have undertaken the defence of the whole tract southward by erecting the famous lines of  Travancore  which begin at  Cranganore  and extend almost to the foot of the  Ghauts  The coast is very low scarcely discernible except by the trees The soundings are gradual and are at the distance of two miles from shore ten or eleven fathoms Ships usually lie three or four miles from land a dangerous bar is an obstruction to entering the harbour and a most furious surge at times beats on the shore  THIS was one of the first places visited by the  Portuguese  after their arrival at  Calicut  It was at that time governed by a prince tributary to the  Zamorin  but who shewed every act of friendship to the Admiral  Cabral  and his companions At his time the harbour was capacious and open While he was there two of the  Christians  of St  Thomas  came and requested him to convey them to  Portugal  that from thence they might visit  Jerusalem  and the  Holy Land Gama  himself afterwards visited  Cochin  and received every mark of respect The prince continued faithful to his new allies and assisted them with a considerable army against the  Zamorin  At length fortune declared against him the  Zamorin  burnt his capital and made himself master of his dominions The  Portuguese  under  Francis Albuquerque  says  Lasitau  came in to their assistance expelled the  Zamorin  and  Duarte Pachcco  whom  Albuquerque  had left behind by his astonishing valor and prudence reinstated  Triumpara  the reigning prince but only to fit him for a new mortification In the transports of his gratitude he permitted the  Portuguese  to build a fort This gave them full power over their faithful ally and under pretence of reducing his rebellious subjects made a conquest of the whole country In a little time the poor prince found himself enslaved  Cochin  became under its new masters a place of great commerce till the year fatal to the  Portuguese  power in this part of  India  It was attacked by the Commodore  Goens  The garrison made a most gallant defence nor was it taken till after great loss on both sides The  Dutch  found the city much too large for their purpose they reduced it considerably The titular king did not find any improvement in his situation and it is said that the present prince lives near  Cochin  with an income of little more than six hundred pounds a year Some of the race of the  Jewish  captives and some of the  Christians  of St  Thomas  reside here The last are miserably poor and ignorant but the church of St  Andrea  not far from hence is served by their clergy  IN this city breathed his last the great  Vasco de Gama  OF VASCO DE GAMA  the discoverer of  India  and with the illustrious  Albuquerque  the founder of the  Portuguese  empire in that inexhaustible region of wealth  Gama  was born at  Sines  a port in the province of  Alentejo  in  Portugal  of a family rendered illustrious by the valour of the individuals  Vasco  was only the fifth in heraldic history which does not even acquaint us with the time of his birth He had served in  France  and he was Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the great  Emmanuel  when he was appointed in  to the important command of the fleet destined for the discovery of the  Indies  We have successively mentioned his name on several glorious occasions our business now is only to trace him to his end He survived to the reign of  John  III to be appointed to a third voyage and to finish his days on that shore where he had begun his career of glory He sailed from  Lisbon  on  April  Prodigies attended his voyage on his arrival off the coast of  Cambay  in the stillness of a calm a dreadful swelling of the sea the then unknown symptons of an earthquake appalled the boldest  Gama  discovered the phoenomenon "Courage" says he "  India  trembles at our approach" Another danger followed this From the description his ship was nearly foundered by the fall of a waterspout He arrived at length at this port where he gave up his great soul on  December  to be judged according to unerring justice for amidst all his fine qualities he was deeply tainted with the character of his nation cruelty His body lay deposited at  Cochin  till when it was brought to  Lisbon  where it was received with greater honor than was ever before paid to any person excepting those of the blood royal  A FATE similar to that of  Gama  attended  Alphonso Albuquerque  OF ALBUQUERQUE  descended illegitimately from the blood royal of  Portugal  He was sent out by his prince for the first time in and in successive voyages shewed himself to have been superior to any one of his nation before or after him both in the military and political line he was fitted by his talents to be the founder of a great empire We trace him almost every where from the  Red  Sea to the utmost limits of his  Indian  expedition as far as  Sumatra  and the distant  Malacca  on his last voyage he was struck by the hand of death He directed his pilot to steer for  Goa  the scene of many of his glorious actions He was informed on the way that he was recalled and two persons most disagreeable to him were to succeed to the government of  India  "  Lopez Soarez  " exclamed he  Governor of  India  it is he it could be no other  Don James Mendez  and  James Pereyra  whom I sent prisoners for heinous crimes return the one governor of  Cochin  the other secretary It is time for me to take sanctuary in the church for I have incurred the King's displeasure for his subjects' sake and the subjects' anger for the King's sake Old man fly to the church it concerns your honor you should die and you never omitted any thing that concerned your honor  HE died in aged off the bar of  Goa  DIES  and was interred there but his corpse was not removed to its native country for numbers of years as is said at the instances of the citizens of  Goa  who venerated his memory He died with the highest sentiments of piety even the  Gentoos  and  Moors  through devotion visited his tomb so highly and universally was he esteemed He was an inflexible lover of justice and of most polished manners yet his actions at  Ormus  at  Calajate  Osorio i p p  and other places shew how impossible it is to suppress an inborn and national barbarity  ALL the tract of country from  Cranganore  almost to  Anjenjo  a tract of about a hundred and twenty miles consists of multitudes  of very low wooded isles formed by a thousand rivers that tumble from the  Ghauts  This flat country extends thirty miles inland and has intermixed a great assemblage of lakes rivers and forests the whole marshy and most unwholesome it abounds with fish and game which makes  Cochin  in that respect a most luxurious residence  A distemper prevales in these parts  SWELLED LEGS  supposed to arise from the badness of the water or from an impoverished state of blood from poor living Its symptoms are a violent swelling in one and sometimes in both legs so that it is not uncommon to see them a yard in circuit round the ancle  See the Plate in Linscottan's Voyage  It is not attended with any pain but with an itching the swollen leg is not heavier than the unaffected The distemper is called the  Cochinleg  and from the size the  Elephantleg  no remedy has yet been discovered The  Dutch  procure their water in boats from a distant place yet  Hamilton  says that he had seen both men and women of that nation afflicted with the malady This destroys the hypothesis of its being the effect either of the water or of poor living  FROM  Cochin  to the termination of the islands the coast is flat and so low as to be distinguished only by the trees or by the flags on the ensign staffs the sea clear of shoals and with good soundings  PORCAH  Porcah  on the island beyond  Cochin  is a small  Dutch  settlement  COULANG  Quilon  or rather  Coulang  is another now sunk into an inconsiderable place On the first arrival of the  Portuguese  it was governed by a QueenRegent who ruled  over a small principality The city was seated on a navigable river had an excellent harbour and its buildings were very splendid but its commerce had declined on the rise of  Calicut  Numbers of  Christians  of St  Thomas  were found spread over the country It was taken from the  Portuguese  by the  Dutch  in The country was at that time also governed by a Queen who resided at  Calliere  an inland town  Nieuhoff  was intrusted with a commission to her and found her a woman of majestic mien and excellent understanding  Nieuhoff's Voyage in Churchill's Coll ii p    To this place there continues a similarity of low and morassy country At a few miles distance to the south of  Coulang  the coast immediately alters the land rises into high and precipitous red cliffs near them is good fresh water at  Anjenga  ANJENGA  a small settlement with a fort belonging to the  English  it is very bad and scarce The fort was built by the  East India  Company in They pay for the ground rent to the queen of the country By my frequent mention of the Queen it should seem that a female reign in these parts was not uncustomary The trade of the neighborhood is pepper and a fine long cloth Mr  Franklin  p remarks that this is the best place in  India  for intelligence and that very lately a post to several parts of  India  has been established "A regular post" says Mr  Rennel  p  is established throughout the parts of  Hindoostan  subject to the  East India  Company and also from  Calcutta  to  Madras  The postmen always travel on foot Their stages are commonly from seven to eight miles and their rate of  travelling within our own districts about seventy miles in the twentyfour hours  CAPE  Comorin  CAPE COMORIN  the most southern part of  Hindooslan  is in Lat ¬∞ It is level low land at its extremity and covered with trees and not visible from the deck more than four or five leagues Mr  Thomas Daniell  Words are wanting to express the merit beauty and elegance of his present publication of the views in  Hindooslan  to whom I am indebted for numbers of informations informs me that the lostiest part is the  highland of Comorin  which is twelve hundred and ninetyfour yards high and quite smooth and verdant to the very summit Near the base bursts forth a most magnificent cataract and near that is a  Choultry  for the accommodation of travellers  A LITTLE to the northward is the termination of the  Ghauts  which may be seen nine or ten leagues at sea This was the  Comar  of  Arrian  ii where there was a castle and a port The sea adjacent was supposed to have been endued with peculiar virtues it was a great resort for the purposes of ablutions and lustrations by all such persons who had determined to pass a religious and solitary life The female sex performed the same rites Written history had even in  Arrian  's time delivered a legend of a certain goddess having here performed the ablutions every month The district was called  Comari Regio  but this holy water reached says  Arrian  as far as  Colchos  the modern  Mingrelia Al Edrisi  speaks p of a  Comr Insula  and gives it a vast extent There is a little  hill to the north of the cape which from the sea appears insulated possibly the  Nubian  Geographer might have received an account of that eminence mistaken for an island and its size exaggerated  CAPE  Comorin  is the termination of the kingdom of  Travancore  Which extends along the western coast  KINGDOM OF TRAYANCORE  from that of  Cranganore  as far as this headland a hundred and forty miles In it began to rise into importance by the abilities of its monarch who reigned forty years In giving audience to two embassadors whom he foresaw would weary him with prolix harangues he cut the first short with this sensible remark "  Be not tedious  " says he "  life is short  " He raised a fine army and well disciplined and meditated the conquest of  Malabar  Amidst all his great talents he mingled the weakness of being ashamed of his  cast  or  tribe  He wished to be a  Brahmin  he ordered a golden calf to be made he entered at the mouth and came out at the opposite part this was his  Metempsychosis  and he dated all his edicts from the days says Abb√©  Raynal  of this glorious regeneration  THIS kingdom begins in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ near  Cranganore  The breadth is greatly contracted by reason of the approach of the  Ghauts  towards the shore Intersected by rivers and covered with thick woods it seems almost unconquerable The  Rajah  whom I have mentioned gave his country additional strength by which he saved his successor from the oppression of the rising usurper  Ayder Alli  Around his capital and chief province  says the author of the War in  Asia  i p  he suffered the woods to grow for a number of  years till they formed an impenetrable belt of great depth This cut into labyrinths afforded easy egress to his people and rendered all attacks from without impracticable Immured within this natural fortification he encouraged the cultivation of the arts and sciences he invited the approach of men of genius and knowledge he cultivated the friendship of the  Brahmins  and was himself admitted into their society by the ceremony of passing as  Raynel  says through a golden cow which became the property of the  Brahmins  the cow being sacred in  India  as formerly in  Egypt  and by preparing his own military stores casting cannon making gunpowder c he rendered himself independent of foreign aid The subjects of his remoter provinces who to avoid the ravages of war had taken refuge within the woody circle now returned with their families and effects to their former habitations  This mode of fortification he evidently copied from his wild neighbors the  Polygars  but they live in almost a savage state while he adopted their plan to secure the cultivation of the mild arts of peace  EVEN the approach to this difficult retreat was impeded by the famous lines of  Travancore  LINES OF TRAVANCORE  which extend from the fouthern banks of the river of  Cranganore  close to sea to the foot of the  Ghauts  strongly fortified in their whole extent These proved the first check to the ambition of  Tippoo Sultan  He wished to provoke the  Rajah  to begin hostilities in order that he might not be charged with being aggressor For several days from the d to the th of  December  the  Sultan  's horsemen rode up to the  Rajah  's lines and made use of  every insulting expedient to draw the first act of hostility from the  Travancore  troops but finding them aware of his artifice and that a detachment of  English  troops was stationed at some distance he at last gave way to his rage and on the th of  December  attacked the lines by storm His troops had filled the foss with cotton They passed by that means into the interior of the lines when by some accident the cotton took fire and the whole formed a tremendous blaze In their rear were the flames in front a furious enemy Actuated by despair they fought with incredible valour out of fifteen hundred men only forty were taken the rest fell victims to the rage of the  Travancorian  defendants  Mackensie's Sketch i p    Tippoo  from the outside of the lines was a spectator of the horrid carnage of his soldiers The  Nayrs  pressed on him on all sides and being repulsed with disgrace and himself thrown from his horse in the retreat he is said to have made an oath that he never would wear his turban again till he had taken the  Rajah  's lines and accordingly he prepared to attack them by regular approach  Dirom's Campaigns  On  April  he completely executed his menaces He attacked the lines with such vigour that he made himself master of them totally destroyed this famous barrier and laid  Cranganore  in ruins carried desolation through the country and put every opponent to flight  Mackensie's Sketch i p    THE disgrace which  Tippoo  suffered  OF THE NATRS  was owing to three battalions of  Nayrs  and five hundred archers in all three thousand  men who stimulated by the cause of their country and of their religion were crowned with victory  British India by the Hon Charles Greville iii Also Mackensie's Sketch of the War with Tippoo Sultan i p  The  Nayrs  are the nobility of  Malabar  the antient dominions of the  Zamorins  and in times of their prosperity formed the body guards On the first appearance of  Cabrial  at  Calicut  the  Zamorin  sent two of his  Nayrs  to compliment him on his arrival They have at all times been famed for their valour and love of war They are of the great military casts the  Khatre  Sir Thomas Herbert's Travels d edit p He calls them Cutteries meaning Khatres  and support to this day the spirit of their ancestors They are excessively proud and are never known to laugh They are besides so very insolent to their inferiors that it is said if a person of the lower order dare to look at a  Nayr  he may be put to death on the spot with impunity Among the good qualities of the  Nayrs  may be reckoned their great sidelity It is customary for them to undertake the conduct of  Christian  or  Mahometan  travellers or strangers through their country The latter never venture without taking a single  Nayr  with them who makes himself responsible for their safety even an old decrepit man or a boy is sufficient for the purpose  Nieuhoff in Churchill  Should any misfortune befall the charge it is related that the  Nayrs  unable to bear the disgrace have frequently been known to put themselves to death  ¬ß Dellon's Voyage  Notwithstanding this at other times they are notorious  robbers and even will murder the traveller unprotected by one of their cast  IN their persons they are well made and of great strength Their complexion more black than olive their hair crisp but longer than that of the  Negro  their ears enormously long they think that custom graceful they lengthen them by art and hang on them and their noses numbers of baubles They at times load their arms and necks with silver bracelets and chains of pearl In time of war on their head they wear a most ungraceful clout hanging down pointed on each side and a short wrapper round the waist with a dagger stuck in a sash all the rest of them is naked In one hand is a sword of vast length Such is the figure of one given by Captain  Byron  engraven by  Vivares  In religion they are of the  Hindoo  in marriage strict  monogamists  PARALLEL to Mount  Dilli  and to  Mah√©  COORGA NAYRS  a small dominion called  Coorga  extends beyond the  Ghauts  unfortunately into the  Mysore  It consists of mountains and vast forests sheltering tigers and elephants innumerable being one of the few places in which the last are at present found in a state of nature The late  Ayder Alli  in vain attempted to subdue the brave inhabitants Family send between the  Rajah  and his brother enabled him to effect his purpose He destroyed one family made prisoners of the other and poffessed himself of the country The present  Rajah  then a boy was son to the younger of the contesting brothers This youth was by  Ayder  compelled to become a  Mussulman  with all the shameful ceremonies of initiation  Dirom p    He was enrolled among the  Chelas  or corps of slaves and continued so till he made his escape in into his own dominions His faithful subjects flocked to him The first act was the slaughter of a brigade of  Tippoo  's troops The  Rajah  instantly offered his service to the  English  It was accepted and he proved a most useful ally  Mercara  his capital was in the hands of the enemy We offered our assistance to reduce it This he declined but after some prudent delay besieged it with his own people took and dismantled it that in future his subjects might depend on their own valour in the field for the defence of their country At the treaty of  Seringapatam  Marquis CORNWALLIS generously stipulated for the security of the gallant  Rajah Tippoo Sultan  grew irritated to a degree of phrenzy at the demand and broke off the actual negotiation with our General who began to renew hostilities  Tippoo  finding a reluctance in his troops to defend the capital was compelled to accept the dictated terms  p p  and the laurels of humanity and fidelity added new glories to the head of the conqueror  THIS account I have selected from the curious relation of the  Mysore  campaigns by Major  Dirom  that of the natural face of the  Coorga  country shall be

contemplate a delightful journey to the traveller but a most arduous march and formidable barrier to an invading army  FROM Cape  Comorin  I take my departure for the island of  Ceylon  ISLE OF CALPENTYN  the nearest part of which the isle of  Calpentyn  is about a hundred and fifty miles distant The intervening sea is the gulph of  Manaar  which grows narrower and narrower till it reaches the fragments of the prior junction with the continent of which Cape  Koiel  a large promontory of the  Marawars  and various rocks are parts The Cape will be described in my progress from Cape  Comorin  along the eastern coasts of  Hindoostan  BEFORE  Cape Koiel  is the  insulasolis  of  Pliny  lib vi  RAMANA KOIEL  the isle of  Ramana Koiel  or the isle of the temple of the god  Rama  founded near the edge of the water and on vast stones to break the force of that element  Rama  had a right to a temple opposite to  Ceylon  for he killed the giant  Ravanen  king of that island and placed his brother  Vibouchanen  on the throne  Rama  was highly venerated in this country The capital of the  Marawars  and the residence of the prince was named in honor of the deity  Ramanadabaram  The passage between this island and the continent is called  Odioroa  passage It is extremely short about five miles broad and not exceeding in depth three feet  FROM the eastern end of the isle of  Ramana Koiel  is a chain of rocks which runs quite across the narrow channel to the isle  of  Manaar  almost adjacent to the  Ceylonese  shore the length is about thirty miles but the whole chain is frequently interfected by narrow passages so very shallow says  d'Apres  in his  Neptune Oriental  p as to be navigable only by the small crast of the neighboring shore and that only in calm weather so disturbed is the channel in gales by a dreadful surf The little vessels that wish to make the passage go under  Manaar  where they must unload pay duty to the  Dutch  get their vessel dragged through the pass and take in their cargo on the other side It is very probable that this succession of rocks was part of an isthmus which in very early times had united  Ceylon  and the continent for the water on each side of this chain does not exceed thirteen or fourteen feet  Pliny  in the passage before cited takes notice of the greenish cast of this part of the channel of its being filled with shrubs that is with corals and of its being so shallow that the rowers often brushed off the tops with their oars  THIS chain of rocks is called  Adam's Bridge  ADAM'S BRIDGE  the tradition is that our common father after his transgression was cast down from  Paradise  and fell upon  Ceylon  but that afterwards this bridge was made by angels for him to pass over to the continent  Manaar  is as the name implies sandy The little channel is on the eastern side and defended by a strong fort garrisoned with a hundred men notwithstanding it is impassable for any vessels which draw more than four or five feet water It had on it seven churches built by the  Portuguese  The natives were converted by St  Francis de Xavier  and still continue professors  of  Christianity  notwithstanding they have labored under many persecutions The pearl mussel is found in great abundance on this coast and the fishery has at different times been attended with good success since the  Dutch  have become masters  Pliny  says that the greatest plenty were found in his days on the coasts of  Tabrohana  and  Toidis  and  Perimula  on the peninsula of  Malacca  A SPECIES of  Manati  is certainly found here  Baldaeus  MANATI  a learned clergyman who resided long in  Ceylon  describes it  Churchill  's Coll iii so exactly that we cannot mistake the animal he intended  Here is a peculiar fish properly

may possibly have  been among them This  Strabo  delivers from the account left by  Onesicritus  a follower of  Alexander  the Great who sent him on a voyage to  India  where he informed himself of many things among which is no small share of fable or misrepresented accounts  Mela  speaks of this island as the part of another world  MELA's  and that it never was circumnavigated  Pliny  PLINY's  lib vi c gives us a large chapter on the subject of this island he not only gives the authority of  Megasthenes  who had written a history of  India  and of  Eratosthenes  a famous geometrician who pretended to give the circumference of  Ceylon  but has drawn many lights from the four embassadors actually sent from this island to  Rome  in the time of  Claudius  By accident a freed slave of a farmer of the  Roman  customs in the  Red  Sea was driven to the coast of  Ceylon  by a storm such an impression did he make on the king of the island by his favorable report of the  Romans  that determined him to send these envoys From them many particulars were learned they were not sparing of any thing which tended to exalt the glory of their country they said that it contained five hunded cities the chief was  Palesimundum  that had two hundred thousand citizens For other particulars I refer to the old historian more is beyond my plan  Ptolemy  comes next  PTOLEMY's  who is particular as to the productions of this great island He mentions rice honey ginger beryls hyacinths and gold silver and other metals and he agrees with  Pliny  about its producing elephants and tigers He also says the antient name of  Ceylon  was  Symondi  but in his days it  was called  Salice  still in some measure retained in its  Indian  appellative  SelenDive  The principal places named by the geographer are  Anurogrammum  ANUROGRAMMUM  of which the  Cingalese  say there are great remains in the vestiges of the antient city  Anarodgurro  Maragrammon  the capital town which answers to the modern  Candy Talacoris emporium  and  Nagadiba Prasodis sinus  and numbers of other places  Ptolem Geograph  which shew how well known this island was to the  Romans  either by their fleet from the  Red  sea or their coasting traders from the western side of  India  I will only mention  Malea Mons  or the modern  Yale  famous for the  Pascua Elephantum  Ptolem Geograph Aelian Nat Anim lib xvi c  Bumasani  PASCUA ELEPHANTUM  the great haunt of elephants and which were driven and probably shipped at a port still called by the  Dutch Geyeweys of Elephants van plaets  and transported in vast ships to  Calinga  The same  probably the same with the modern  Calingapatam  a city and port on the coast of the northern  Circars  El Edrisi  p  EL EDRISI  speaks of this island under the name of  Serandib  and  Marco Polo  under that of  Seilam  It is celebrated by each for its rich gems By mistake the  Nubian  Geographer places the diamond among them but all the rest it produces in high perfection and several kinds of aromatics or spices Silk was also exported from hence in his days He speaks highly of the ruling monarch who had sixteen privy counsellors four of his own people four  Christians  four  Mahometans  and four  Jews  such was the moderation of this excellent prince He loved good wine which he procured from  Parthia  and  Persia  and dispersed among his subjects He was indulgent in this gift of heaven but a most severe enemy to incontinence  THE  Portuguese  were the first of the  European  nations who visited  Ceylon  CEYLON VISITED BY LAWRENCE ALMEYDA  It was discovered by  Laurence Almeyda  in who was driven accidentally from his cruize off the  Maldive  isles by the violence of the currents into a port called by the natives  Gabalican  Oforio i p  The ruling prince was as he is now styled emperor and is lord paramount over the lesser kings he is styled most great invincible and  tailed  Wolf's Ceylon p  the first of his race coming from  Siam  with a tail a foot long pendent from behind his posterity in due time according to lord  Monboddo  's system shed their tails and became as capable of the arts of government as any  European  monarch whatsoever  Almeyda  was received by the governor with the utmost courtesy He sent  Pelagio Souza  one of his officers to the royal residence at  Colombo  where he was introduced to the emperor He met with a most favorable reception formed a league with his imperial majesty who agreed to pay  Emmanuel  annually two hundred and fifty thousand pounds weight of cinnamon on condition that the fleets of  Portugal  should defend his coasts from all hostile invasions It is well known that the  Portuguese  soon after made themselves masters of the principal ports and engrossed the whole trade of the valuable bark The  Moors  or  Arabs  exerted every effort to prevent them from establishing  themselves in  Ceylon  This highly concerned the  Arabs  who before that time were the sole venders of the cinnamon which they carried to  Suez  from whence it was conveyed over the isthmus and from  Alexandria  to all parts of  Europe  all their endeavors were to no purpose that rich trade became monopolized by these new rivals  THE  Dutch  first landed here in  DUTCH LAND HERE  and visited the emperor In they received a formal invitation from the ruling monarch and in consequence appeared off the coast with a potent fleet They confederated with the king of  Ceylon  and after a struggle of several years and after great bloodshed they expelled the  Portuguese  whose power ended in the taking of  Colombo  in after a siege of seven months in which the  Portuguese  exerted all that spirit and valour which originally made them lords of the  Indies  The emperor repaid the  Dutch  all the expence in cinnamon and other productions of the island and invested them with many privileges and in return found himself exactly in the same dependent state as he was before his victories The  Dutch  fortified every one of his ports They have besides a grant of coast round the island twelve miles in breadth reckoning from the sea  Wolf p  His majesty maintains a magnificent court at  Candy  but at any time his good allies by the sole interdiction of the article salt may make him and his subjects to submit to any terms they are pleased to dictate  Elscheskroon in Wolf's book p    THE form and extent of the isle of  Ceylon  FORM OF CEYLON  are very much undetermined The figure which is generally adopted in the roaps is that of a pear with the stalk turned towards the north The length from  Dondrahead  south to  Tellipeli  north is about two hundred and eighty miles the greatest breadth or from  Colombo  to  Trincoli  is about a hundred and sixty The latitudes of the two extremes in length are between ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≥ and ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ Its extremes of longitude are ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ and ¬∞ ‚Ä≤  THE island rises from on every side to the mountains which run in chains principally from north to south The highest and rudest tract is the kingdom of  Conde Uda  CONDE UDA  which is impervious by reason of rocks and forests except by narrow paths which are also impeded by gates of thorns closely watched by guards At the western skirt of these mountains soars  Hamalell  and  ADAM'S PEAK  in the  European  language  Adam's Peak  It rises preeminent above all the rest in form of a sugar loaf  Le Brun  ii p gives a view as it appears from the sea On the summit is a flat stone with an impression resembling a human foot two feet long it is called that of our great and common ancestor The  Cingalese  or aborigines of  Ceylon  say that it is of  Buddo  their great deity when he ascended into heaven from whom they expect salvation The  Mahometan  tradition is that  Adam  was cast down from  Paradise  we make his  Paradise  an earthly one and fell on this summit and  Eve  near  Judda  in  Arabia  They were separated two hundred years after which he found his wife and conducted her to his old retreat there he died and there he was buried and there are two large tombs To this day many votaries visit his imaginary sepulchre the  Mahometans  out of respect to our common father the  Cingalese  under the notion I have just mentioned Is there not a trace of  Christianity  in the opinion of the  Cingalese  respecting  Buddo  of the necessity of a mediator which they might have collected from the  Christians  of St  Thomas  Here they light lamps and offer sacrifices which by antient custom are given to the  Moorish  pilgrims All the visitants are in places obliged to be drawn up by chains so rude and inaccessible is the way to this mount of sanctity  FROM this mountain rushes the great river  MavilaGanga  GANGES  or  Ganges  which passes unnavigable close to  Candy  a very long and rocky course to the sea at  Trincomale  ALL the rest of the isle except some marshy flats adapted to the culture of rice are broken into thousands of hills beautifully cloathed with wood The intervening valleys are often morassy or consisting of a rich fat soil but the fertility of the open parts is astonishingly great  THE account given by  Ptolemy  of the mineral or fossil productions is in a great measure confirmed  MINERALS  Iron and copper are found here as is black lead A gold mine is said to be latent in one of the great mountains but the working prohibited by the emperor Of gems the ruby sapphire topaz  GEMS  the electric tourmalin  Cronsledt Ed Magellan  sect and the cat's eye or  Pseudopal  and hyacinth are met with But what occasions the neglect of the mines and of the gems is the attention to the great staple of the island the important bark of the cinnamon Doctor  Thunberg  is very exact in his account of the gems of  Ceylon  Travels iv They are dug up about  Matura  and the liberty of search is farmed for no more  than one hundred and eighty rixdollars a year Amethysts and an infinite variety of crystals and crystalline gems are found in that neighborhood The account of my able correspondent well merits perusal  THE inhabitants are the  Cingalese  INHABITANTS  these are aboriginal and differ totally in language from the people of  Malabar  or any other neighboring nation Their features more like  Europeans  than any other Their hair long most commonly turned up They are black but well made and with good countenances and of excellent morals  RELIGION  and of great piety Their religion is derived from  Buddo  a proselyte of the great  Indian Foe  his doctrine spread over  Japan  and  Siam  as well as that of  Foe  Knox Kaempser's Hist Japan i  It consists of the wildest idolatry and the idols the objects of their worship are the most monstrous and phantastic The  pagodas  are numerous and many of them like several in  India  of hewnstone most richly and exquisitely carved The  Cingalese  believe  Buddo  to have come upon earth and that to him belonged the salvation of souls all human happiness say they proceeds from him all evil from the devil to whom he permits the power of punishment When sick they dedicate a red cock to that being as the  Romans  did one to  Esculapius  During the time he inhabited the earth they tell us that he usually sate under the shade of the  ficus religiosa  which in honor of him is called in the  Cingalese  tongue  Budaghaha  His religion is the established religion of the island  THE civil government is monarchical  GOVERNMENT  The emperor in the time of  Knox  was absolute and clamed the most undisputable  right over the lives and fortunes of all his subjects He was a most barbarous tyrant and took a diabolical delight in putting his subjects to the most cruel and lingering deaths Elephants were often the executioners of his vengeance and were directed to pull the unhappy criminals limb from limb with their trunks and scatter them to the birds of the air or beasts of the field The emperor's residence was at  Candy  nearly in the center of the island but he was in  Knox  's time by the rebellion of his subjects obliged to desert that city The government is said by  Wolff  p to be at present very mild and regulated by the statute laws of the land the joint production of divers wise princes and are considered as sacred by the  Cingalese  It is possible that the tyrant in the days of  Knox  had destroyed the liberties of his country which were afterwards restored  ROBERT KNOX  The author  Robert Knox  is a writer fully to be depended on a plain honest man who in sailed in one of the  East India  Company's ships to  Madras  and on the return in was forced by a storm into  Ceylon  to refit when his father who was captain went on shore and with sixteen more of the crew were seized by the emperor's soldiers and detained The Captain died in a year's time Our author lived nineteen years in the island and saw the greatest part of it At length with difficulty he escaped and arrived safe in  England  in  September  His history of the island and of his adventures were published in and appears to be the only authentic account of the internal parts and the only one that can be entirely relied on  THERE is in this island a race of wild men called  Wedas  WEDAS OR BEDAS  or  Bedas  they speak the  Cingalese  language but inhabit the depth  of woods and the fastnesses of the mountains and are in all respects as savage as the domesticated animals are in the state of nature  OR BARBARI  I suspect them to be what  Solinus  Polyhistor c These may be the same with the  Wedas  which Solinus says made a trade of selling parrots to the Romans  calls  Barbari  to distinguish them from other  Indians  in a state of civilization for I think I have met with elsewhere the distinction between a wild people and others in a polished state of manners  THESE  Wedas  wear their hair long collect it together and tie it on the crown of the head in a bunch Their complexions are comparative to the other  Cingalese  light they inhabit the depth of woods and their skins that way escape the effect of the burning sun They live entirely on flesh or on roots the first they either eat raw or dried or preserved in honey They live either in caves or under a tree with the boughs cut and laid round about them to give notice when any wild beasts come near which they may hear by their rustling and trampling upon them  Knox p  They are like them without law and as  Wolf  page says without religion  Knox  p p asserts the contrary The wilder sort never shew themselves the tamer will enter into some kind of commerce with their civilized countrymen Their dress is only a cloth wrapped round their waists and brought between their legs A small ax is usually stuck in the wrapper They are skilful archers and very nice in their arrows The heads are of iron made by the smiths of the civilized people They have no other means of bespeaking them than leaving near the shop a pattern cut out of a leaf with a piece of flesh by way of reward If he does the  work they bring him more meat otherwise they shoot him in the night  AFTER this account of the lowest of the human race  ELEPHANT  I fear I shall injure the half reasoning elephant on putting him on a level with such of our own species as have scarcely any of the reasoning particles left This island was celebrated by  Pliny  lib viii c for its race of elephants which were larger and more adapted for war than those of  India  He also gives the methods of capture  Lib viii c  They are at present taken in different manners and after being tamed are sent to the great annual fair at  Jaffanapatam  The merchants of  Malabar  and  Bengal  have notice of the numbers and qualities of the elephants to be set up to sale sometimes a hundred are sold at one fair A full grown beast twelve or fourteen feet high will be sold at the rate of two thousand dollars  THE manner of taking these huge animals is thus described by Doctor  Thunberg  iv p who undertook a journey up the country to see what the  Dutch  call an  Elephanttoil  or  snare  "which served for capturing and inclosing a great number of elephants The toil was constructed of stout cocoa trees almost in the form of a triangle the side nearest to the wood being very broad and augmented with slighter trees and bushes which gradually extended themselves into two long and imperceptible wings The narrower end was strongly fortified with stakes planted close to each other and held firmly together by ropes and became at length so narrow that only one single  elephant could squeeze itself into the opening When the governor gives orders for an elephant chace on the company's account which happens at the expiration of a certain number of years it is performed in the following manner A great multitude of men as well  European  as  Cingalese  are sent out into the woods in the same manner in which people go out on a general hunt for wolves and bears in the north of  Europe  These diffuse themselves and encompass a certain extent of land which has been discovered to be frequented by elephants After this they gradually draw nearer and with great noise vociferation and beat of drum contract the area of the circle in the mean time the elephants approach nearer and nearer to the side on which the toil is placed Finally torches are lighted up in order to terrify still more these huge animals and force them to enter into the toil prepared for them As soon as they all have entered the toil is closed up behind them The last time that elephants were caught in this manner their numbers amounted to upwards of a hundred and on former occasions has sometimes amounted to one hundred and thirty"  "THE first care of the captors is to bring them out of the toil and to tame them For this purpose one or two tame elephants are placed at the side where the opening is through which each elephant is let out singly when he is immediately bound fast with strong ropes to the tame ones who discipline him with their proboscis till he likewise becomes tame and suffers himself to be handled and managed at pleasure This disciplinary correction frequently proceeds very briskly and is sometimes accomplished in a few days especially as the wild elephant is at the same time brought under control by hunger"  THE horses of the island are descended from the  Arabian  breed  HORSE  These are kept in a wild state in certain islands called  Ilbas de Cavallos  They are at certain times forced into the ponds and rivers and caught by people who in the most dexterous manner fling over any part they please a noose These are sent to a fair immediately following the elephant fair and sold for large prices The peasants make no sort of use of horses but in their place employ the buffalo which they catch and tame for the cart and all their rural work  Wolf p    THE species of deer are very elegant  DEER  here are found the spotted  Axis Hist Quad  N  o  the middle sized N  o  and the great N  o  called by the  Dutch Elk  as tall as a horse and the ribfaced N  o  with a tusk from each upper jaw pointing downwards  THE little  Indian  musk called  Meminna  not larger than a hare is a native of this isle This has like the last its tusks  BUFFALOES are very common here wild and tame  BUFFALO  and are the only animals used here for rural oeconomy  WILDBOARS are very numerous and very fierce  WILDBOAR  To fight an enemy to hunt the elephant and catch the wildhog are the three points of valour among the  Cingalese  MONKIES swarm here  MONKEY  the  Wanderow  is a species mentioned by  Knox  with a great white beard from ear to ear a black face and dark grey body There is a variety of the above quite white  THE purplefaced N  o  has a triangular white beard purple face and black body  THE  Rillow  or  Rolleway  N  o  is distinguished by the long hair on its head lying flat and parted They are as large as a bloodhound and are able to catch hold of a child and run up with it to the top of the loftiest trees and after admiring it for some time they will lay it gently down on the place they took it from These are very numerous and very audacious and will rob the corn fields and gardens in the very face of the owners and as soon as they are driven out of one end of the field will come skipping into the other and fill both their bellies and hands Of late years it has been discovered by a  Russian  tanner that their skins might be dressed and made into shoes  THE tailless  Macauco  N  o  and the  Loris  N  o  are found here  THE jackal  JACKAL  N  o  is numerous here as it is all over  India  THE tiger  TIGER  N  o  is too frequent in  Ceylon  These animals are shot with crossbows placed in their haunts  Pliny  says that tigers and elephants were made by the people the executioners of their kings whenever they had offended them They appointed a solemn hunting match and exposed their monarch to the fury of those beasts  BEARS  BEAR  N  o  are very common even in this neighborhood of the Line  Wolf  says they are large and black and feed on honey as they do in  Europe  THE  Civet  CIVET  N  o  is frequent in  Ceylon  THE  Mungo  or  Indian Ichneumon  N  o  is found here This weesel is famous for its antipathy to the  Naja  or  Cobra de Capello  and for its instant recourse to the antidote to the fatal  bite on its receiving a wound from that dreadful serpent The plants it seeks relief from are the  Ophiorrhiza Mungos Strychnos Colubrina  and  Ophioxylon serpentinum  The last is figured in  Burman Zeylan  tab and in  Rumph Amboin  vi tab xvi  THE  Naja  is found all over the hotter parts of  India  NAJA  and is distinguished by a mark on the back of the head of the form of a pair of spectacles also by the power of dilating the skin of the head into the form of a hood from which it has gotten the name of the  Cobra de Capello  or hooded snake They grow from four to eight or nine feet in length and are justly dreaded by the  Indians  Their bite is generally mortal yet there is a remedy if timely applied that has its efficacy The mortal effect sometimes takes place in a quarter of an hour sometimes in two or three hours In its fatal  sacculus  it seems to contain the poisons of the  Seps  one of  Lucan  's deadly list  Manant humeri fortesque lacerti Colla caputque fluunt calido non ocius austro Nix resoluta cadet nee solem cera sequetur  An universal gangrene takes place and the flesh falls from the bones convulsions sometimes bring on death according to the degree of  virus  on which the symptoms depend  THIS species never distends its hood but when it is agitated by some passion such as fear or rage it then quits its creeping attitude raises the fore part of the body a third of its whole length spreads its hood and moves its head around darting a fiery glare to every part often remaining in all other respects immoveable or its motion becomes slow steady and cautious  so that in  India  it is held to be the emblem of Prudence it is also held in veneration equal to a deity The legends of the country are full of strange tales relating to its actions they call it  Nella Pambou  or the  good serpent  it is often represented twisted round the deities under the name of  Calengam  in memory of the victory of one of their gods over an enormous  Naja  THIS certainly is not the  Deaf Adder  The  Indian  jugglers especially those of  Malabar  have a power of taming these dreadful animals and instructing them to dance after the inharmonious and slow air of their flagelets The serpent first seems astonished then begins to rear himself and sometimes by a gentle motion of the head and with distended hood seems to listen with pleasure to the notes This is said not to be peculiar to those which are accustomed to the exercise but even the snakes newly taken will shew the same disposition and fling themselves into the same attitudes  Nieuhoff  gives a plate of these jugglers and their snakes and  Kaempfer  a much better  I SHALL mention here two or three  Indian  serpents described by M  d'Obsonville  notwithstanding I am uncertain of their native place one is called in  French le Javclot  a species of  Jaculus  of a green color five or six feet long and most fatal in its bite It generally lurks extended or suspended among the branches of trees So situated that they either can dart on their prey such as little birds or insects or remove

death as rapidly as  Lucan  's  Volucer serpens  Our author saw a  Gentoo  bit by one The sufferer could only give a shriek and advance a few steps when he fell down dead  THE  Burningserpent  seems to possess the dreadful poison of three species  BURNINGSERPENT  It gives by its bite the symptoms of raging fire like the  Torrida dipsas  It causes at other times the blood to flow through every pore like the  Hoemorrho√Øs  at other times to cause swelling like the  Prester  and to incite racking pains at length by a happy numbness death brings kindly relief to the miserable sufferer The Reverend  Edward Terry  Voyage in p  saw a criminal put to death at  Amedavad  with all the effects of the bite of the  Dipsas  and of the  Prester  This species much resembles the last in form both inhabit dry hot and rocky places and live on insects full of saline and acrimonious particles which cannot fail of exalting the  virus  of the serpents that make them their food  OUR great  Ray Syn Quadr  enumerates several of the  Ceylonese  serpents one is the  Oehaetulla  i e  oculis infesius  the very same with that described above under the name of  Javelot  THE  Ninypolonga  is the same with the  Asp  which kills the person it bites by flinging him into an endless sleep  THE vast  Boa  BOA  the  Anacandaia  of the  Ceylonese  is common here and is compared for size to the mast of a ship  See Doctor Shaw's most elegant work The Naturalist's Miscellany Vol i tab    Quintus Curtius  mentions it among the monstrous serpents which astonished the army of  Alexander  in his march into  India  This is common to  Africa  and the greater islands of  India  It is the serpent which  Livy  Dec ii c feigns to have given  Regulus  so much employ on the banks of the  Bagrada  To what I have said of the  Cobra Manilla  at page I may here add an instance of the rapid fatality of its bite A gentleman resident in  India  sent his servant on an errand into a closet the man cried out that something had pricked his finger before his master could reach him he fell down dead on the floor Perhaps the same with the poison snake  CROCODILES are very common in  Ceylon  CROCODILE  and

length of five or six feet its flesh is eaten and thought to be medicinal  THE  Lacerta Gekko  is a species justly dreaded for the poison which exudes even from the ends of its toes and which infects to a degree of fatality any thing it passes over its urine and saliva are equally dangerous its voice which is acute like that of a cricket flings a whole company into consternation The  Indians  obtain from it a deadly poison for their arrows They  tie one of these animals pendent by the tail and provoke it till it emits its deadly saliva on the point of the weapons which kill with the slightest wound This dreadful reptile seldom attains a foot in length  THE  Draco volans  Same Vol ii tab    FLYING LIZARD  the animal which bears the dreadful name of  Dragon  is no more than an

of my friend  Latham  is as unerring a guide as human imperfection can produce In respect to the birds I shall here and elsewhere only point out those on whom nature hath impressed any characters worthy of philosophic attention  To shun prolixity I avoid giving in general descriptions of either beasts or birds In respect to the first I refer entirely to the third edition of my  History of

 Romans  were very fond of the parrot kind which they must have had from the eastern side The  Indians Barbari  profited of this passion and made them an article of commerce The  Wedas  are most skilful archers and probably do the same These birds inhabit the forests in which says  Solinus  c the trees were so lofty that they were beyond the reach of the arrows aimed at their inhabitants

my own account of its oeconomy taken from the  Indian Zoology  page deserves attention It is thus introduced  HAD Providence left the feathered tribe unendowed with any particular instinct the birds of the torrid zone would have built their nests in the same unguarded manner as those of  Europe  but there the lesser species having a certain prescience of the dangers that surround them and of their own weakness suspend their nest at the extreme branches of the trees they are conscious of inhabiting a climate replete with enemies to them and their young with snakes that twine up the bodies of the trees and apes that are perpetually in search of prey but heaveninstructed they clude the gliding of the one and the activity of the other  THE brute creation in the torrid zone are more at enmity with one another than in other climates and the birds are obliged to exert unusual artifice in placing their little broods out of the reach of an invader Each aims at the same end though by different means Some form their penfile nest in shape of a purse deep and open at top others with a hole in the side and others still more cautious with an entrance at the very bottom forming their lodge near the summit  BUT the little species we describe seems to have greater diffidence than any of the others it will not trust its nest even to the extremity of a slender twig but makes one more advance to safety by sixing it to the leaf itself  IT picks up a dead leaf and surprising to relate sews it to the side of a living one its slender bill being its needle and its thread some fine sibres the lining feathers gossamer and down Its eggs are white the color of the bird light yellow its length three inches its weight only three sixteenths of an ounce so that the materials of the nest and its own size are not likely to draw down a habitation that depends on so slight a tenure  Two flycatchers of uncommon form  FLYCATCHER  attract the eyes of all strangers small birds with

color is one proof I mention this in particular on account of its history but more so for that of the magnificent tree on which it usually alights to seed  THIS species swarms in certain seasons in the island of  Ceylon  FICUS INDICA  particularly when the fruit of the  Ficus Indica  or broad  leaved  Waringen  is ripe They alight in vast multitudes on that grotesque tree and are caught with birdlime by the natives who prepare the twigs against their arrival Mr  Loten  informed me that when he was governor in  Ceylon  one morning at break of day he saw some hundreds entangled on the boughs of the great  Waringen  tree before his window and ordered one of his  Ceylonese  servants to take them off They are excellent food and are often shot by the  Europeans  They are observed never to alight on the ground but to perch on high trees and give this the preference on account of the fruit It is for the same reason the haunt of various other birds but notwithstanding the sweetness of the fruit it is neglected by mankind  THIS tree immediately attracted the attention of the antients  Onesicritus  the philosopher who followed  Alexander  the Great in his expedition into  India  commanded his galley and recorded his actions first gives us an account of this wonderful tree For this at lest he does not merit the severe remark made on him by  Strabo  lib xv p who seems incredulous to all he says possibly there may be other points in which he may be also defended This tree rises high in the air then drops its boughs which take root and successively create new stems till a vast extent is covered with the arched shade It is even said to form of itself a forest of arched avenues and a labyrinth of alleys impenetrable by the rays of the vertical sun perhaps the extent may be exaggerated We will content ourselves with giving the dimensions of one near  Manjee  west of  Patna  the diameter of which was from three hundred and sixty three feet to three hundred and seventy three the  circumference of the shadow at noon eleven hundred and sixteen that of the several stems which were no more than fifty or sixty nine hundred and twentyone Hundreds of people may find a comfortable retreat beneath its foliage Such is the account given by the veracious Mr  Marsden  in page of his excellent history of  Sumatra  Pliny  lib xii c gives the fullest description he was best qualified for by the time he lived the  Romans  got tolerably well acquainted with the country His account is elegant and faithful speaking of the trees of  India  he says  Ficus ibi exilia

found in  Malabar Sumatra  c but is depretiated by another name  Cassia  and  Canella  to our unspeakable loss  CINNAMON OR CASSIA  Cinnamomum  was a more dignified name The antients speak of it under that title in such high terms that the  Dutch  wisely retained the name which gave it greatest respectability Our countryman the late  Taylor White  Esq in Ph Trans vol l p and Mr  Combes  resident in  Sumatra  in page are entirely of opinion that  Cinnamon  and  Cassia  do not specifically differ Mr  White  's account is accompanied with some very good figures of the leaves of the former  THE celebrated bark is the inner and is reckoned the most perfect when taken from trees of seven or eight years old if they grow in a wet slimy soil but those which grow in the warm white  sand of the vallies come to maturity in five years  Seba  says that the ages of the trees are fourteen fifteen or sixteen years It is the heat which gives the bark that quilled form in which it comes over to us especially the smaller and more delicate sort which is taken from the smaller branches The bark is first freed from the external coat when it is on the trees is then cut lengthways stripped off dried in the sand and so becomes merchantable  THE barkers of cinnamon are brought up to the trade and are called  Chialiases  The account given by Mr  Eschelskroon  of the management is most authentic from him I shall transcribe what will be highly satisfactory to the readers At page of  Wolfe  's account of the isle of  Ceylon  he begins thus  The time for barking the tree commences in the months of  June  and  July  and sometimes even in  August  now as soon as they come out of their villages for that purpose every district sends a detachment of  Dutch  soldiers and another composed of the natives themselves called  Lascaryns  along with them in order to guard the wood where they are to work and this partly on account of the roving  Cingalese  mountaineers which sometimes fall on the barked cinnamon and make it their booty but still more for the purpose of having an eye upon the  Chialiases  themselves that they may not be able to conceal any of the cinnamon and afterwards carry it off  THE bark that is peeled during the day must be carried every evening to the  Dutch  guard belonging to their respective districts there cleansed well dried and made up into bundles and afterwards taken in close cases to the factory where they  are weighed and received by the company as payment of the assessment or tax imposed on these people by government A man must be a very good hand indeed that can gather thirty pounds of cinnamon in a day whence it is easily calculated how many persons it will take to gather ten or twelve million pounds and that too of the best for what is brought in is looked over before it is weighed and the refuse of it burned  At the time for gathering this drug the company are obliged to draw out a  cordon  of seventytwo miles in circumference and as there are a great many of these  corps de garde  it follows that the company must pay a great many  Europeans  as well as  Cingalese  These cinnamon barkers are under the command of a captain called a  Malabadde  and are distributed into four different classes All the  Chiliases  must be ready at all times to work at the Governor's command for on him it depends how much is to be barked and delivered in and this again depends on the demand for it from  Europe  THIS important article of luxury was well known to the antients The  Greeks  called it  and sometimes  or  Casia Lignea  and  to the bark from the pipelike form it assumed by the rolling up We have applied the word  Cassia  to the inferior cinnamons of  Malabar  and  Sumatra  THE  Romans  called it  Cinnamomum  but generally with some addition The  Xylocinnamomum  or the wood we are told by  Pliny  was sold for twenty  denarii  or twelve shillings and eleven pence  per  pound The juice or expressed oil at one thousand  denarii  or ¬£ The  Daphnoides  or  Isocinnamon  seems not to be thought the genuine kind yet sold at the price of three hundred  denarii  or ¬£ the same price as the true  cinnamon  The  Cinnamomum camocans  was the expressed juice of a nut and perhaps a different article from the true  cinnamon  was sold for no more than forty asses or two shillings and sevenpence The antients according to  Pliny  esteemed as we do at present the cinnamon of the young twigs It was chiefly made use of as a perfume either as an ingredient for their unguents or to rub their bodies with in form of oil They appear to have been ignorant of the tree that produced it as well as the country they supposed that it came from that part of  Aethiopia  which bordered on the  Troglodytes Pliny  says they bought all

that the fruit grows to the weight of thirty or forty pounds that the taste is unpleasant and cadaverous yet that not fewer than fifteen dishes are prepared from it He adds that the trees of both kind are replete with a milky juice as tenacious as birdlime itself and  Knox  adds that the boys apply it to that purpose  Rumphius  i p calls the larger variety of this species  Saccus Arboreus major

Rumph Amboin  i tab  BORASSUS  The leaves are large and palmated the edges of the stalks serrated the leaves are four feet long divided into seventy or eighty rays like the sticks of a fan and may be folded up in the same manner In  Macassar  they are made into  umbrellas  but are so highly esteemed there that they are carried by none but by a few persons of the first rank The fruit grows in clusters and each is about the size of a child's head Within is a very eatable pulp  and besides are three lesser nuts of the size of a goose's egg containing when young a soft kernel when old a very palatable liquor A bread or cake is made from the kernel which requires a considerable preparation and a liquor greatly in use called  Sura  is extracted from the body with the usual process of tapping the tree From that again is got by boiling a rich syrup and a sort of sugar The timber is elegantly veined and striated and often made into chests  THE ascent to the summit of the tree is performed by a man who attains the height by the assistance of a girdle which surrounds his waist and the tree his knees are fixed against the body and he gains the height by alternately removing the girdle which supports his body and then with his knees gaining a new advance A most dangerous operation for should the girdle break his life is lost  Dactylifera  has been spoken of before in vol vi p and vol vii p  PHOENIX  of the MS outlines It is so amply treated of by the learned  Kaempfer  in his  Amaen Exoticae  page that it is difficult to give any thing in addition It grows not only in  Ceylon  but in many parts of the peninsula of  India  and is called in  Ceylon  at lest  Indi  and  Mahaindi  As the plenty and harvest of  India  consists in success of the palm trees it is supposed by  Linnaeus  that  India  might derive its name from that which these trees bear in that country It must be the generical name for Mr  Ives  says that the dates do not ripen to perfection in the peninsula of  India  THE beautiful CORYPHA  Umbraculisera  CORYPHA  i tab is the most elegant species of the palm kind from the regular expanse of  the leaf which is quite circular and terminating in the most beautiful rays resembling a glory like that of the sun surrounding the whole They are about three feet and a half in diameter and are the finest umbrellas in nature and in universal use in  Ceylon  to protect against the rays of the sun or the fury of the rains  Knox  at page shews the  Ceylonese  man under the protection of one of the leaves They also serve for paper for the lapping of parcels The wood is hard and veined with yellow and serves to make chests like the preceding The fruit is in the form of a cannon ball containing within two other nuts of the size of a musquet ball which are eaten by the poor These are of the richest saffron color and give a most brilliant appearance to this elegant tree and hang down in clusters three feet long  THIS palm is the  Tal  of  Bengal  the  Brab  of  Bombay  and the  Talaghas  and  Tala  of  Ceylon Arrian  i p mentions the bark of the  Tala  as a food used by the  Indians  a particular not noted by modern writers  Sylvestris Rheed Malab  iii tab  et seq  ELATE  This grows only to the height of about fourteen feet is covered with a greyish crust instead of a bark The fruit of the size and form of a small plumb is sometimes made use of by the poorer people to chew with  Betel  instead of the  Areca  The stalks of the fruit are greedily sought after by the elephants for the sake of the sweet pith they contain  Urens Rumph Amboin  i tab  CARYOTA  grows to the height of a middling coco palm The fruit grows in vast clusters adhering  to the sides of the twigs are of a round shape and of the size of a common plumb each has within two nuts of no sort of use the leaves are triangular and grow in pairs The timber is useful especially for shingles to cover houses Of the pith may be made a sort of  Sago  but far inferior to the true kind  I AM so much indebted to my late worthy friend  John Gideon Loten  JOHN GIDEON LOTEN  Esq for my acquaintance with the zoology of  Ceylon  and various particulars respecting its natural history that it would be ungrateful in me not to pay the full tribute of praise to his memory I became acquainted with him a few years after his arrival in  England  in and long enjoyed the valuable friendship of a man of the strictest honor integrity liberality simplicity and gentleness of manners He was by birth a  Dutchman  a native of  Utrecht  He went to  India  in the year where he exercised several of the highest offices at  Batavia  and in the islands of  Ceylon  and  Celebes  with the highest credit he alleviating the cares of his important duties with the fullest cultivation of the liberal arts At  Colombo  he established a botanical garden and in every place made the pleasing study of natural history a principal object He brought over with him a large collection of drawings done with equal neatness and accuracy some by the natives others by  Europeans  whom he found in the country I was indebted to his friendship for copies of several but the greater part he at my request liberally communicated to  Peter Brown  an ingenious artist a  Dane  by birth who engraved not fewer than twentyone and with several others from different places published a  splendid work in with the title of 'NEW ILLUSTRATIONS OF ZOOLOGY' under the patronage of my late worthy friend  Marmaduke Tunstal  Esq and myself  FROM the same collection was formed my INDIAN ZOOLOGY begun in and left a fragment It was resumed and published more complete in one volume quarto in I refer the reader to the preface to that work for an account of its rise and progress  Mr  Loten  returned into  Europe  in and coming into  England  where he lived several years in he married his second wife  Laetitia Cotes  of the respectable house of  Cotes  in  Shropshire  several years after which he returned into  Holland  and died at  Utrecht  on  February  aged eighty and was interred in St  Jacob  's church in that city During the whole of my acquaintance with him at frequent periods he endured the most severe spasmodic complaints in his chest which for months together disabled him from the use of a bed I should not have mentioned these circumstances was it not to add to his other virtues those of unfeigned piety and resignation unexampled amidst the trial of severest misery  IN the north aisle westward of  Westminster  Abby is a most magnificent cenotaph erected in to perpetuate the memory of this excellent man the performance of THOMAS BANKS A single figure representing Generosity attended by a lion sustains a medallion of his head and on a pedestal is a brief history of his life and his character in  Latin  There is another inscription consisting of the fifteenth psalm excepting the last  verse so expressive of the life of a good man concluding with these words  SUCH WAS JOHN GIDEON LOTEN  AFTER this account of my worthy friend  PONTA DE PEDRAS  I resume the view of  Ceylon  beginning at the northern extremity of its coast  Ponta de Pedras  Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≤ the  Boreum promontorium  of  Ptolemy  and taking the eastern side surround the whole island This northern extremity is broken into two or perhaps more isles divided from the greater by a very narrow channel the other side is faced by rocks and shoals and affected by most variable currents  THE city of  Jaffanapatam  stands on the western side of one of the isles  JAFFANAPATAM  this retains its  Cingalese  name most of the other places in the neighborhood have been changed to  Dutch  When the city was taken from the natives by the  Portuguese  in they found in the treasury the tooth of an ape so highly venerated by the people of  Ceylon  that immense sums were offered for its redemption but in vain To destroy this piece of idolatry the viceroy ordered it to be reduced to powder and then burnt Apes are in many parts of  India  highly venerated out of respect to the God  Hannaman  THE APEGOD HANNAMAN  a deity partaking of the form of that race with the addition of heads of bears who rendered the god  Vitchenou  great services in this very isle slaying giants and performing so many wondrous deeds In vol iii p of  Churchill  's collection is a long detail of his exploits There is a wonderful extravagance in the  Indian  mythology the warmth  of their climate creates ideas filled with the strangest imagery The tooth was probably worshipped as one belonging to his godship  MOST of the eastern side of  Ceylon  is guarded with sand banks or rocks  Between the bay of Trincomale and the sort Calirauw is the country called Bedas a tract of sorest comprehending a hundred and twenty miles The habitation of the Bedas  TRINCOMALE  Trincomale  harbour is in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≥ a fine and secure port protected by a strong garrison consisting of about four hundred men Such was the number in fort  Ostenburgh  when it was taken by assault on  January  by our brave seaman Sir  Edward Hughes  which on  August  of the same year was wrested from us by his active and gallant rival  Suffrein  ON  September  d the former came off  Trincomale  and to his great surprise found the  French  colors flying on all the forts  Suffrein  with a superior squadron sailed out of the harbour secure as he thought of victory Our brave admiral and his officers enraged at the loss of the place eagerly accepted the offer of combat The contending admirals displayed every proof of courage and skill  Suffrein  's ship was reduced to a wreck and he obliged to remove his flag to another By some neglect of ours we lost the disabled ship Night alone terminated the battle  Suffrein  retired into  Trincomale  crowding in without order Thus secured  Hughes  left him reluctantly and sailed for  Madras  with his shattered squadron Our loss was inconsiderable in common men for it did not exceed fiftyone killed  and three hundred wounded In officers we suffered severely The captains  Lumley Watt  and  Wood  fell in the action The loss of the  French  was enormous Four hundred and twelve men were killed and six hundred and seventysix were wounded The carnage on board the gallant  Suffrein  's ship the  Hero  was unheard in any fight of any age it was an unparalleled carnage Many of the  French  captains had behaved ill six were broke and sent prisoners to the island of  Mauritius  and thus ended the unavailing slaughters in the  Indian  seas  THE  Ganges  of  Ptolemy  runs into this harbour  Barticalo  is the next port  BARTICALO  lying in Lat ¬∞ ‚Ä≥ This also has a strong fortress Here the  Dutch  first landed in and took it by capitulation from the  Portuguese  The mountain the  Monk'shood  some leagues inland is a remarkable sea mark  Barticalo  may have been near the site of the town called by  Ptolemy Bocona  near it is a river which preserves the name being called by the natives  Kobokanoye  or the river of  Bokan  D'Anville Antiquit√© de l'Inde p    FROM the mouth of  Kobakan  river the land trends to the southwest Nothing remarkable occurs till we reach  Malawe  between that place and  Tangala  is a large plain thirty miles in circumference noted for the chace of elephants their antient place of embarkation the  Geyrreweys of Elyphants van plaets  is a little farther to the west  A LITTLE more to the west is  Matura  MATURA  where the  Dutch  have a strong fortress their policy is only to fortify the ports  Dondrahead  is next  DONDRAHEAD TANAWAR  that point is the most southern of any in the island A little to the west is  Tanawar  remarkable for having been the  Daiana  of  Ptolemy  sacred to the moon the place still has its temple or  Pagoda  highly venerated by the natives Near it is one of the  Dutch  posts of which they have a succession every ten or twelve miles guards to the internal parts and one may say to the imprisoned Emperor The garrisons are provided with flags by which signals either of internal commotions or the appearance of ships are conveyed all along the coasts even to  Colombo  the seat of the  Dutch  government Almost every one of these posts are near the mouth of some river or torrent which rush on all sides into the sea at short intervals from the lofty mountains  Punta de Galle  is a little to the northwest of  Dondrahead  PUNTA DE GALLE  in Lat ¬∞ turning almost due north The town is strongly fortified and is a place of great trade The fleets return from hence to  Europe  and generally sail by  December  th  COLOMBO  In Lat ¬∞ we find  Colombo  the  Dutch  seat of government and chief of their cities built in a beautiful and magnificent manner it was as I have before mentioned taken by them from the  Portuguese  The death of their gallant general  Gerard Hulst  cast a gloom over their success and caused their important acquisition for a while to be lost in their sorrow  Nigombo  is a fortress some miles to the north of  Colombo  NIGOMBO  and is the great guard to the cinnamon country The whole interval from  Colombo  is filled with beautiful villages and  open towns  ISLE OF CALPENTYN  characteristic of  Dutch  neatness and industry The long isle of  Calpentyn  lies near the shore about thirtysix miles farther north  ISLE OF MANAAR  That of  Manaar  see p concludes all I shall say of this magnificent island  THE LIFE OF SIR WILLIAM JAMES BARONET  COMMUNICATED BY LADY JAMES  SIR WILLIAM JAMES embarked in a sea life at twelve years of age He was more than twenty years at sea before he got the command of a ship He was with Sir  Edward Hawke  in the  West Indies  in as a junior officer Some years after he commanded a ship in the  Virginia  trade in her he was taken by the  Spaniards  in the Gulph of  Florida  and carried a prisoner to the  Havannah  His sufferings after his captivity will be related hereasterIn the beginning of he went to the  East Indies  as chief officer of one of the  East India  Company's ships and performed two voyages in that station In the  East India  Company appointed him to the command of a new ship called the  Guardian  equipped as a ship of war in her he sailed to  Bombay  to protect the trade on the  Malabar  coast which was much annoyed by the depredations of  Angria  and other pirates with which those seas swarmed  DURING two years he was constantly employed in convoying the merchant ships from  Bombay  and  Surat  to the  Red Sea  the Gulph of  Persia  and up and down the  Malabar  coast from the Gulph of  Cambay  to Cape  Comorin  He was frequently attacked on this service by the different piratical states At one time when he had near seventy sail of ships and vessels under his charge he was assailed by a large fleet of  Angria  's frigates and  gallivats full of men With the  Guardian Bombay  grab and  Drake  bomb ketch he engaged the enemy and kept them in close action whilst his fleet got safe into  Tellicherry  In this conflict he sunk one of the enemies largest gallivats and obliged the rest to seek for safety in  Gheriah  and  Severndroog  ABOUT the beginning of the year Sir  William  was appointed commander in chief of the  East India  Company's marine forces and hoisted his broad pendant on board the  Protector  a sine ship of guns On  April  d he was sent with the  Protector Guardian Bombay  grab and  Drake  bomb with some gallivats to attempt such of the ports belonging to  Angria  which lie to the northward of  Gheriah  his principal fortress and capital  THE chief of these fortresses was  Severndroog  where  Angria  's vessels refitted and took shelter when they could not reach  Gheriah  It was well defended by batteries along the shore and the entrance of the harbour was secured by a strong castle on which were mounted seventy pieces of cannon  Angria  's people considered  Severndroog  as their strongest hold next to  Gheriah  Sir  William  having reconnoitred the place and informed himself of its strength brought his ships with a leading wind close to the castlewalls and by a steady welldirected fire whilst the  Drake  threw in her bombs soon brought on a parley and in less than three hours the governor surrendered the castle and the vessels in the harbour from hence Sir  William  went to  Fort Victoria  which quickly followed the fate of  Severndroog  and the next day four other forts were numbered in his conquests all these falling was a severe blow to  Angria  who  had a short time before attacked a fleet of  Dutch  ships under the protection of a gun ship and a frigate The  Dutch  fleet was dispersed and the gun ship and some of the merchantmen were brought in great triumph to  Gheriah  WHEN Sir  William  returned with his victorious fleet to  Bombay  he found Admiral  Watson  there with three lineofbattle ships and some frigates c The government of  Bombay  consulted with the Admiral about means to destroy the powers of  Angria  and the  Mahratta  states joined in the confederacy for they had suffered by his depredations  SIR  William  was sent with his little squadron to reconnoitre  Gheriah  a place represented to be almost impregnable from the sea He judiciously stood close in to the walls under the cover of night and with his boat sounded and examined the channels leading to the harbour and outer road in the daytime he stood in within gunshot of the walls and having in two days made himself perfectly master of the enemy's strength he returned to  Bombay  This piece of service he performed with so much promptness and skill that he received the thanks of the Governor and Admiral and they were so well persuaded from his report of the practicability of the enterprize that no time was lost in equipping the ships and embarking the troops  THE squadron formed off  Gheriah  the th  February  Sir  William  in the  Protector  led the squadron to the attack in one division whilst another division of frigates led the bombketches in another line a heavy and tremendous sire began on our part from the ships of the line whilst the shells were thrown with great success from the bombs into the harbour where all  Angria  's ships were hawled for safety these were soon set on  fire by the bombs the fire from the castle and batteries soon slackened and before the evening set in the castle surrendered and  Gheriah  and all its dependencies fell into our hands Thus shortly ended an enterprize which for many years had been in contemplation by the  European  governments in  India  but which was never before attempted from an idea that no force sufficient could be brought against the walls of this castle Lord  Clive  at this time a lieutenantcolonel commanded the land forces  ON the  Malabar  coast soon after this he fell in with a  French  ship from  Mauritius  very much his superior in men and guns she was called  l'Indienne  after a smart action she struck and Sir  William  carried her in triumph to  Bombay  SIR  William James  in an eminent manner displayed his nautical abilities by shewing that in despight of a contrary monsoon a communication between  Bombay  and the  Coromandel  coast may be effected in cases of exigency  The tracks are laid down in Mr Arrowsinith's map of the world    THIS passage was attempted by Sir  William  in the first instance and he accomplished it in nearly as short a time as it usually was done in the favorable monsoon It was of the utmost moment that he succeeded at the time he did for by it he consirmed to Admiral  Watson  then in the  Ganges  the intelligence of the war with  France  and brought to his assistance troops by which the Admiral and Colonel  Clive  were enabled in  March  to take  Chandenagore  the chief of the  French  settlements in  Bengal  IN effecting this passage the commodore crossed the equator  in the meridian of  Bombay  and continued his course to the southward as far as the tenth degree and then was enabled to go as far to the eastward as the meridian of  Atcheen  head the N W extremity of  Sumatra  from whence with the N E monsoon which then prevaled in the bay of  Bengal  he could with ease gain the entrance of the  Ganges  or any port on the  Coromandel  coast  IN the beginning of this narrative it was mentioned Sir  William  had suffered shipwreck The uncommon hardships he and his people encountered were as followsAfter they were released from the  Spanish  prison at the  Havannah  they embarked in a small brig for  Carolina  The crew of the brig and Sir  William  and his people amounted to fifteen The second day after putting to sea a very hard gale of wind came on the vessel strained and soon became so leaky that the pumps and the people bailing could not keep her free and at length being worn out with labor seven of them with Sir  William  got into the only boat they had with a small bag of biscuit and a keg of water the vessel soon after disappeared and went down They were twenty days in this boat without a compass their biscuit soon got wet with the sea which for two days made a breach over the boat a snuffbox Sir  William  had with him served to distribute their daily allowance of water and after encountering every difficulty of famine and severe labor on the twentieth day they found themselves on the island of  Cuba  not ten miles from whence they had been embarked out of a  Spanish  prison but a prison had no horrors to them The  Spaniards  received them once more into captivity and it is remarkable  that only one out of the seven perished though after they got on shore but few of them had the use of their limbs for many days  IN the year Sir  William  returned to his native country The  East India  Company presented him with a handsome elegant goldhilted sword with a complimentary motto expressive of their sense of his gallant services Soon afterwards he was chosen a director and continued a member of that respectable body more than twenty years in which time he had filled both the chairs He was fifteen years deputy master of the corporation of  Trinity House  a governor of  Greenwich  hospital served two sessions in parliament for  West Looe  and on the th of  July  the King was pleased to create him a baronet  He planned the reduction of  Pondicherry  during the  American  war and received a rich service of plate from the  India  Company as a testimony of their sense of his skill and judgment in that affair  ON the th  December  Sir  William  died aged In the year following a handsome building was erected on his estate in  Kent  near the top of  Shooter's Hill  it is built in the style of a castle with three sides and commands a most extensive view The lowest room is adorned with weapons peculiar to the different countries of the East The room above has different views of naval actions and enterprizes painted on the ceiling in which Sir  William  had been a considerable actor The top of the building is finished with battlements about sixty feet from the base The top of the battlements are four hundred and eighty feet above the level of  Shooter's Hill  and more than a hundred and  forty feet higher than the top of St  Paul  's cupolaOn a tablet over the entrance door is this inscription  This Building was erected MDCCLXXXIV  by the Representative of the late  Sir WILLIAM JAMES Bart  to commemorate that gallant Officer's Atchievements in the  East Indies  during his Command of the Company's Marine Forces in those Seas  and in a particular Manner to record the Conquest of  the Castle of  Severndroog  on the Coast of  Malabar  which fell to his superior Valour and able Conduct  on the d Day of  April  MDCCLV  OF Sir  William  it is said by a person who knew him intimately near thirty years and was well acquainted with his professional abilities That as a thorough practical seaman he was almost without an equalAs an officer he was brave vigilant prompt and resolute patient in difficulty with a presence of mind that seemed to grow from danger  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME  INDEX  A  ABDALLA King of Candahar  Page  Abercromby M General  Page  Abingdon Major
