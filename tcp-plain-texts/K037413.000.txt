 FLORIO A TALE FOR FINE GENTLEMAN AND FINE LADIES AND THE BAS BLEU OR CONVERSATION TWO POEMS  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXVI Price Three Shillings  TO THE HON HORACE WALPOLE  SIR  IT would be very flattering to me if I might hope that the little Tale which I now take the liberty of presenting to you could amuse a few moments of your tedious indisposition It is I confess but a paltry return for the many hours of agreeable information and elegant amusement which I have received from your spirited and very entertaining writings yet  I am persuaded that you will receive it with favour as a small offering of esteem and gratitude of which the intention alone makes all the little value  The slight verses Sir which I place under your protection will not I fear impress the world with a very favourable idea of my poetical powers But I shall at least be suspected of having some taste and of keeping good company when I confes s that some of the pleasantest hours of my life have been passed in your conversation I should be unjust to your very engaging and wellbred turn of wit if I did not declare that among all the lively and brilliant things I have heard from you I do not remember ever to have heard an unkind or an ungenerous one Let me be allowed to bear my feeble testimony to your temperate use of this charming faculty so delightful in  itself but which can only be safely trusted in such hands as yours where it is guarded by politeness and directed by humanity  I have the honour to be SIR Your much obliged And most obedient Humble Servant HANNAH MORE  JANUARY  FLORIO A POETICAL TALE  FLORIO A POETICAL TALE FOR FINE GENTLEMEN AND FINE LADIES  FLORIO a youth of gay renown  Who figur'd much about the Town  Had pass'd with general approbation  The modish forms of Education  Knew what was proper to be known  Th' establislih'd jargon of Bonton  Had learnt with very moderate reading  The whole new system of good breeding  Knew to be negligent and rude  But still his feelings wou'd intrude  For FLORIO was not meant by nature  A silly or a worthless creature  He had a heart dispos'd to feel  Had sense and spirit taste and zeal  Was handsome generous but by fate  Predestin'd to a large estate  Hence all the hopes he gave were foil'd  His mind by praise and pleasure spoil'd  The Destiny who wove the thread  Of FLORIO'S being sigh'd and said  Poor youth this cumbrous twist of gold  More than my shuttle well can hold  For which thy anxious fathers toil'd  Thy white and even thread has spoil'd  This shall seduce thy pliant youth  From sense simplicity and truth  Thy erring fire by this misled  Shall scatter pleasures round thy head  When wholesome disicipline's controul  Shou'd brace the sinews of thy soul  Coldly thou'lt toil for Learning's prize  For why shou'd he that's rich be wise  The gracious Master of mankind  Who knew us vain and weak and blind  In mercy tho' in anger said  That man shou'd earn his daily bread  Who counteracts the order given  Disputes the high behest of Heaven  Forgive nor lay the fault on me  This mixture of mythology  The bard of Paradise has deign'd  With truth to mingle fables feign'd  Who cannot reach his style or thoughts  With ease may irritate his faults  Poor FLORIO at the ardent age  When youth shou'd rush on Glory's stage  When Life shou'd open fresh and fair  And Hope advance with smiling air  Of youthful gaiety bereft  Had scarce an unbroach'd pleasure left  He found already to his cost  The shining gloss of life was lost  And Pleasure was so coy a prude  She fled the more the more pursued  But FLORIO knew the WORLD that Science  Set Sense and Learning at defiance  He thought the world to him was known  Whereas he only knew the  Town  In men this blunder still you find  All think their little setMankind  Tho' high renown the youth had gain'd  No flagrant crimes his life had stain'd  No tool of falsehood slave of passion  But spoilt by CUSTOM and the FASHION  Tho' known among  a certain set  He did not like to be in debt  He shudder'd at the dicer's box  Nor thought it very heterodox  That tradesmen shou'd be sometimes paid  And promises be kept when made  His utmost credit as a sinner  Was that he sometimes spoilt a dinner  Ever by system came too late  And made his choicest parties wait  Yet 'twas a hopeful indication  On which to found a reputation  Small habits well pursued betimes  May reach the dignity of crimes  His mornings were not spent in vice  'Twas lounging sauntering eating ice  Walk up and down St James's Street  Full fifty times the youth you'd meet  He hated cards detested drinking  But stroll'd to shun the toil of thinking  'Twas doing nothing was his curse  Is there a vice can plague us worse  The wretch who digs the mine for bread  Or ploughs that others may be fed  Feels less fatigue than that decreed  To him who cannot think or read  Not all the struggle of temptation  Not all the furious war of passion  Can quench the spark of Glory's flame  Or blot out Virtue's very name  Like the true taste for genuine saunter  No rival passions can supplant her  They rule in short and quick succession  But SLOTH keeps one long fast possession  Ambition's reign is quickly clos'd  Th' usurper Rage is soon depos'd  Intemperance where there's no temptation  Makes voluntary abdication  Of other tyrants short the strife  But INDOLENCE is king for life  Yet tho' so polish'd FLORIO'S breeding  Think him not ignorant of reading  For he to keep him from the vapours  Subscrib'd at HOOKHAM'S saw the papers  Was deep in Poet'scorner wit  Knew what was in Italics writ  Explain'd fictitious names at will  Each gutted syllable cou'd fill  There oft in paragraphs his name  Gave symptom sweet of growing fame  Tho' yet they serv'd but to apprize  Of buttons' form or buckles' size  He studied while he dress'd for true 'tis  He read Compendiums Extracts Beauties  Abregés Dictionnaires Recueils  Mercures Journaux Extraits and Feuilles  No work in substance now is follow'd  The Chemic Extract only's swallow'd  He lik'd those literary cooks  Who skim the cream of others' books  And ruin half an Author's graces  By plucking bonsmots from their places  He wonders any writing sells  But these spic'd mushrooms and morells  His palate these alone can touch  Where every mouthful is  bonne bouche  Of each new Play he saw a part  And all the  Anas  had by heart  He found whatever they produce  Is fit for conversationuse  Is ever ready for display  A page would prime him for a day  They cram not with a mass of knowledge  Which smacks of toil and smells of college  Which in the memory useless lies  And only makes mengood and wise  A friend he had BELLARIO hight  A reasoning reading learned wight  At least with men of FLORIO'S breeding  He was a prodigy of reading  He knew each stale and vapid lye  In tomes of French Philosophy  And then we fairly may presume  From PYRRHO down to DAVID HUME  'Twere difficult to single out  A man more full of shallow doubt  He knew the little sceptic prattle  The sophist's paltry arts of battle  Talk'd gravely of th' atomic dance  Of moral fitness fate and chance  Quoted the nonsense of LUCRETIUS  Stripp'd of the charm which makes it specious  Dropt hints with wondrous penetration  Against the history of Creation  Then prov'd by argument circuitous  The combination was fortuitous  Swore Priests whole trade was to deceive  And prey on bigots who believe  With bitter ridicule cou'd jeer  And had the true freethinking sneer  Stale arguments he had in store  Which have been answer'd o'er and o'er  Practis'd to raise his reputation  The trite old trick of false citation  And wou'd from ancient Authors quote  A sentiment they never wrote  Upon his highest shelf there stood  The Classics neatly cut in wood  And in a more commodious station  You found them in a French translation  He swears 'tis from the Greek he quotes  But keeps the French just for the notes  He worshipp'd certain modern names  Who History write in Epigrams  In pointed periods shining phrases  And all the small poetic daisies  Which crowd the pert and florid style  Where fact is dropt to raise a smile  Arts scorn'd by History's sober Muse  Arts CLARENDON disdain'd to use  Whate'er the subject of debate  'Twas larded still with sceptic prate  The good with shame I speak it feel  Not half this proselyting zeal  Tho' FLORIO did not yet believe him  He thought why shou'd a friend deceive him  Much as he priz'd BELLARIO'S wit  He lik'd not all his notions yet  He thought him charming pleasant odd  But hop'd he might believe in God  Still tho' he tried a thousand ways  Truth's insuppressive torch wou'd blaze  Where once her flame has burnt I doubt  If ever it go fairly out  Yet under great BELLARIO'S care  He gain'd each day a better air  With many a leader of renown  Deep in the learning of the Town  Who never other science knew  But what from that prime source they drew  Pleas'd to the opera they repair  To get recruits of knowledge there  Mythology gain at a glance  And learn the Classics from a dance  For tho' they never car'd a groat  How far'd the vent'rous Argonaut  Yet pleas'd they see MEDEA rise  On fiery dragons to the skies  For DIDO tho' they never knew her  As MARO'S magic pencil drew her  Fond as she was and brokenhearted  Her pious vagabond departed  Yet for DIDONE how they roar  And  Cara Cara  loud encore  One taste BELLARIO'S soul possess'd  The master passion of his breast  Not one of those frail transient joys  Which by possession quickly cloys  This bliss was solid constant true  'Twas action and 'twas passion too  For tho' the business might be finish'd  The pleasure scarcely was diminish'd  Did he ride out or sit or walk  Still he liv'd o'er again in talk  This keen this ever new delight  His joy by day his dream by night  'Twas eating did his soul allure  In short a modish Epicure  Tho' once this word as I opine  Meant not such men as live to dine  Yet all our modern Wits assure us  That's all they know of EPICURUS  They fondly fancy that repletion  Was the  chief good  of that fam'd Grecian  To live in gardens full of flowers  And talk philosophy in bowers  Or in the covert of a wood  To descant on the  sovereign good  Might be the notion of their founder  But they have notions vastly sounder  Their bolder standards they erect  To form a more voluptuous sect  Old EPICURUS wou'd not own 'em  A dinner is their  summum bonum  You'll rather find such sparks as these  Like EPICURUS' deities  Like them they laugh at human cares  And with disdain view all affairs  BELLARIO had embrac'd with glee  This practical philosophy  Young FLORIO'S father had a friend  And ne'er did Heaven a worthier send  A cheerful knight of good estate  Whose heart was warm whose bounty great  At Christmas still his oxen bled  With which the grateful poor were fed  Resentment vanish'd where he came  And lawsuits died before his name  The old esteem'd the young caress'd him  And all the smiling village bless'd him  Within his Castle's Gothic gate  Sate Plenty and oldfashion'd State  Scarce Prudence cou'd his bounties stint  Such characters are out of print  O wou'd kind Heaven the age to mend  A new edition of them send  Before our tottering Castles fall  And swarming Nabobs seize on all  Some little whims he had 'tis true  But they were harmless and were few  He dreaded nought like alteration  Improvement still was innovation  He said when any change was brewing  Reform was a fine name for ruin  He thought 'twou'd shew a falling state  If STERNHOLD shou'd give way to TATE  This ever dwelt upon his tongue  How things were chang'd since he was young  Of moderate parts of moderate wit  But parts for life and business fit  He of no history made profession  But of the Protestant succession  On all occasions ne'er wou'd fail  At Popery and the FRENCH to rail  Of BLACKSTONE he had read a part  And all BURN'S JUSTICE knew by heart  In books that he might waste no minute  His poetry had business in it  He ne'er had heard of Bards of Greece  But had read half of "DYER'S Fleece"  To make his sphere of knowledge wider  His Georgics "PHILIPS upon cyder"  He cou'd produce in proper place  Three apt quotations from the  A Poem by Mr SOMERVILE  "Chace"  And in the hall from day to day  Old ISAAC WALTON'S angler lay  This good and venerable knight  One daughter had his soul's delight  For face no mortal cou'd resist her  She smil'd like HEBE'S youngest sister  Her life as lovely as her face  Each duty mark'd with every grace  Her native sense improv'd by reading  Her native sweetness by goodbreeding  No pretty starts of feign'd surprise  No sweet minauderies clos'd her eyes  Led by Simplicity divine  She pleas'd and never tried to shine  She gave to Chance each unschool'd feature  And left her cause to Sense and Nature  The Sire of FLORIO ere he died  Decreed fair CELIA FLORIO'S bride  Bade him his latest wish attend  And win the daughter of his friend  When the last rites to him were paid  He charg'd him to address the maid  Sir GILBERT'S heart the wish approv'd  For much his ancient friend he lov'd  Six rapid months like lightning fly  And the last grey was now thrown by  FLORIO reluctant calls to mind  The orders of a Sire too kind  Yet go he must he must fulfil  The hard conditions of the will  Go at that precious hour of prime  Go at that swarming bustling time  When the full Town to joy invites  Distracted with its own delights  When Pleasure pours from her full urn  Each tiresome transport in its turn  When Dissipation's altars blaze  And men run mad a thousand ways  When on his tablets there were found  Engagements for full six weeks round  Must leave with grief and desperation  Three packs of cards of invitation  And all the wearisome delights  Of slavish days and sleepless nights  Ye Nymphs whom tyrant Power drags down  With hand despotic from the Town  When ALMACK'S doors wide open stand  And the gay partner's offer'd hand  Courts to the dance when steaming rooms  Fetid with unguents and perfumes  Invite you to the dear delight  Of wellbred crowds and mobs polite  You may conceive what FLORIO felt  And sympathetically melt  None else can guess the hardship dire  To lawns and woodlands to retire  When freed from Winter's icy chain  Glad Nature revels on the plain  When blushing Spring leads on the hours  And May is prodigal of flow'rs  When Passion warbles thro' the grove  And all is song and all is love  When newborn breezes sweep the vale  And health adds fragrance to the gale  Six bays unconscious of their weight  Soon lodg'd him at Sir GILBERT'S gate  His trusty Swiss who flew still faster  Announc'd th' arrival of his Master  So loud the rap which shook the door  The hall reecho'd to the roar  Since first the Castle walls were rear'd  So dread a sound had ne'er been heard  The din alarm'd the frighten'd deer  Who in a corner slunk for fear  The Butler thought 'twas beat of drum  The Steward swore the French were come  It ting'd with red poor FLORIO'S face  He thought himself in Portland Place  Short joy he enter'd and the gate  Clos'd on him with its ponderous weight  Who like Sir GILBERT now was blest  With rapture he embrac'd his guest  Fair CELIA blush'd and FLORIO utter'd  Half sentences or rather mutter'd  Disjointed wordsas "honour pleasure  "Kindvastly good Ma'ambeyond measure"  Tame expletives with which dull Fashion  Fills vacancies of sense and passion  Yet tho' disciple of cold Art  FLORIO perceiv'd he had a heart  He saw and but that Admiration  Had been too active too like passion  Or had he been to Ton less true  Cupid had shot him thro' and thro  But vainly speeds the surest dart  Where FASHION'S mail defends the heart  The shaft her cold repulsion found  And fell without the pow'r to wound  For Fashion with a mother's joy  Dipp'd in her lake the darling boy  That lake whose chilling waves impart  The gift to freeze the warmest heart  Yet guarded as he was with phlegm  With such delight he ey'd the dame  The Goddess strait his peril knew  And instant to his succour flew  But all was safe she saw and smil'd  And claim'd the triumph of her child  CELIA a dinner still supplied  Which modish luxury might deride  Yet her discreet wellorder'd table  Tho' sober still was hospitable  A modest dinner best displays  The Master eats on other days  And decent Elegance was there  And Plenty with her liberal air  But vulgar plenty gave offence  And shock'd poor FLORIO'S nicer sense  One dish there was which never fail'd  CELIA with this each guest regal'd  'Twas simple mutton roast or boil'd  Sole dish French cookery has not spoil'd  Tho' rich in game and stor'd with fish  She ne'er forgot her standing dish  FLORIO in secret wou'd repine  For FLORIO now but liv'd to dine  Disgusted at the constant round  For ever at her table found  He scarce cou'd stand the slender loyn  But fainted at the ample chine  Yet still afraid to give offence  Or shock his CELIA'S grosser sense  Patient he yielded to his fate  When good Sir GILBERT pil'd his plate  He bow'd submissive made no question  But that 'twas sovereign for digestion  But such was his unlucky whim  It never wou'd agree with him  Yet feign'd to praise the vulgar treat  And if he eat not seem'd to eat  In sleep sad FLORIO hop'd to find  The pleasures he had left behind  He dreamt and lo to charm his eyes  The form of WELTJE seem'd to rise  The gracious vision wav'd his wand  And banquets sprung to FLORIO'S hand  Th' imaginary savours rose  In tempting odours to his nose  A bell not Fancy's false creation  Gives joyful "note of preparation"  He starts he wakes the bell he hears  Alas it rings for morning pray'rs  But how to spend next tedious morning  Was past his possible discerning  Unable to amuse himself  He tumbled every wellrang'd shelf  This book was dull and that was wise  And this was monstrous as to size  With eager joy he gobbled down  Whate'er related to the town  Whate'er look'd small whate'er look'd new  Halfbound or only stitch'd in blue  Old playbills ASTLEY'S last year's feats  And Opera disputes in sheets  As these dear records meet his eyes  Ghosts of departed pleasures rise  He lays the book upon the shelf  And leaves the day to spend itself  To cheat the tedious hours whene'er  He sallied forth to take the air  His sympathetic ponies knew  Which way their Lord's affections drew  And every time he went abroad  Sought of themselves the London road  He ask'd each mile of every clown  How far they reckon'd it to town  And still his nimble spirits rise  Whilst thither he directs his eyes  But when his coursers back he guides  The sinking Mercury quick subsides  A week he had resolv'd to stay  But found a week in every day  Yet if the gentle maid was by  Faint pleasure glisten'd in his eye  But when no more the room she grac'd  The slight impression was effac'd  Whene'er Sir GILBERT'S sporting guests  Retail'd old news or older jests  FLORIO quite calm and debonair  Still humm'd a new Italian air  He did not even feign to hear 'em  But plainly shew'd he cou'd not bear 'em  CELIA perceiv'd his secret thoughts  But lik'd the youth with all his faults  Yet 'twas unlike she softly said  The tales of love which she had read  Where heroes vow'd and sigh'd and knelt  Nay 'twas unlike the love she felt  Tho' to her Sire with fault'ring tongue  She oft remark'dhe was but young  Confess'd his manners wrong in part  But thenhe had so good a heart  His interest farther to secure  She prais'd his bounty to the poor  For votary as he was of art  He had a kind and melting heart  Tho' with a smile he us'd to own  He had not time to feel in town  Not that he blush'd to shew compassion  It chanc'd that year to be the fashion  At length to wake Ambition's flame  A letter from BELLARIO came  Announcing the supreme delight  Preparing for a certain night  By FLAVIA fair return'd from France  Who took him captive at a glance  The invitations all were given  Five hundred cardsa little heaven  A dinner firsthe wou'd present him  And begg'd that nothing might prevent him  Whoever wish'd a noble air  Must gain it by an  entrée  there  Of all the glories of the town  'Twas the first passport to renown  Then ridicul'd his rural schemes  His pastoral shades and purling streams  Sneer'd at his present  brilliant  life  His polish'd Sire and highbred Wife  Thus doubly to inflame he tried  His curiosity and pride  The youth with agitated heart  Prepar'd directly to depart  But bound in honour to obey  His father at no distant day  He promis'd soon to hasten down  But business call'd him now to town  Then faintly hints a cold proposal  But leaves it to the Knight's disposal  Stammer'd half words of love and duty  And mutter'd much ofworth andbeauty  Something of passion then he dropt  And hop'd his ardourHere he stopt  For some remains of native truth  Flush'd in his face and check'd the youth  Yet still the ambiguous suffusion  Might pass for artless love's confusion  The doating father thought 'twas strange  But fancied men with times might change  Yet own'd nor cou'd he check his tongue  It was not so when he was young  That was the reign of love he swore  But now those halcyon days are o'er  In that blest age for honour fam'd  Love paid the homage Beauty claim'd  Not that insipid daudling Cupid  With heart so hard and air so stupid  Who coldly courts the charms which lie  In Affectation's halfclos'd eye  Love then was honest genuine passon  And manly gallantry the fashion  Yet pure as ardent was the flame  Excited by the beauteous dame  Hope cou'd subsist on slender bounties  And Courtiers gallop'd o'er two counties  The Ball's fair partner to behold  Or humbly hopeshe caught no cold  But mark how much Love's annals mend  Shou'd Beauty's Goddess now descend  On some adventure shou'd she come  To grace a modish drawingroom  With radiant eye and heavenly air  What Beau wou'd hand her to her chair  Vain were that motion which betray'd  The goddess was no earthborn maid  If noxious FARO'S baleful spright  With rites infernal rul'd the night  The group so bent on play and pelf  VENUS might call her doves herself  As FLORIO pass'd the Castlegate  His spirits seem to lose their weight  He feasts his lately vacant mind  With all the joys he hopes to find  Yet on whate'er his fancies brood  The form of CELIA wou'd intrude  Howe'er his random thoughts might fly  Her gentle graces fill'd his eye  Nor was th' obtrusive vision o'er  E'en when he reach'd BELLARIO'S door  The friends embrac'd with warm delight  And FLAVIA'S praises crown'd the night  Soon dawn'd the day which was to shew  Glad FLORIO what was heaven below  FLAVIA admir'd wherever known  Th' acknowledg'd Empress of bonton  O'er FASHION'S wayward kingdom reigns  And holds BELLARIO in her chains  Various her powers a wit by day  By night unmatch'd for lucky play  The flattering fashionable tribe  Each stray bonmot to her ascribe  And all her "little senate" own  She made the best charade in town  Her midnight suppers always drew  Whate'er was fine whate'er was new  There oft the brightest fame you'd see  The victim of a repartee  For Slander's Priestess still supplies  The spotless for the sacrifice  Who at her polish'd table sit  The summit reach of modish wit  The  persiflage  th' unfeeling jeer  The civil grave ironic sneer  The laugh which more than censure wounds  Which more than argument confounds  Th' exalted deed which wou'd engage  The wonder of a nobler age  With unbelieving scorn is heard  Or else to selfish ends referr'd  To Vanity's light effervescence  Ascribe they Virtue's purest essence  When Malice longs to throw her dart  But finds no vulnerable part  Because the Virtues all defend  At every pass their guarded friend  Yet by one slight insinuation  One scarce perceiv'd exaggeration  Sly Ridicule with half a word  Can fix her stigma ofabsurd  Her cruel caustics deeply pain  And scars indelible remain  Supreme in wit supreme in play  Despotic FLAVIA all obey  Small were her natural charms of face  But heighten'd with each foreign grace  But what subdued BELLARIO'S soul  Beyond Philosophy's controul  Her daily table was as fine  As if ten Rajahs were to dine  She every day produc'd such fish as  Wou'd gratify the nice APICIUS  Or realize what we think fabulous  I'th' bill of fare of ELAGABALUS  Yet still the natural taste was cheated  'Twas delug'd in some sauce one hated  All that can surfeit or can cloy  Soupes Santés  which the health destroy  And ever on her sumptuous board  The savoury pye of PERIGORD  All sauce all sweetmeat all confection  All poignancy and all perfection  Rich Entremets whose name none knows  Ragouts French Tourtes and Fricandeaux  Might picque the sensuality  O' th' hogs of EPICURUS' sty  Yet all so foreign and so fine  'Twas easier to admire than dine  O if the Muse had power to tell  Each dish no Muse has power to spell  Great Goddess of the French Cuisine  Not with unhallow'd hands I mean  To violate thy secret shade  Which eyes prophane shall ne'er invade  No of thy dignity supreme  I with "mysterious reverence" deem  Or shou'd I venture with rash hand  The vulgar wou'd not understand  Th' initiated only know  The raptures keen thy rites bestow  Thus much to tell I lawful deem  Thy works are never what they seem  Thy will this general law has past  That nothing of itself shall taste  Thy word this high decree enacted  "In all be NATURE counteracted"  Conceive who can the perfect bliss  For 'tis not given to all to guess  The rapturous joy BELLARIO found  When thus his ev'ry wish was crown'd  To FLORIO as the best of friends  One dish he secretly commends  Then hinted as a special favour  What gave it that delicious flavour  A mystery he so much reveres  He never to unhallow'd ears  Wou'd trust it but to him wou'd show  How far true Friendship's power cou'd go  FLORIO at first with transport eat  And marvell'd at the sumptuous  fête  But soon his pleasure was destroy'd  Soon every craving sense was cloy'd  A little warp his taste had gain'd  Which unperceiv'd till now remain'd  For from himself he wou'd conceal  The change he did not chuse to feel  He almost wish'd he cou'd be picking  An unsophisticated chicken  And when he cast his eyes around  And not one simple morsel found  O give me was his secret wish  My charming CELIA'S Standing Dish  Now Nature struggling for her rights  Lets in some little casual lights  And Love combines to war with Fashion  Tho' yet 'twas but an infant passion  The practis'd FLAVIA tried each art  Of sly attack to steal his heart  Her forc'd civilities oppress  Insulting thro' mere graciousness  While many a gay intrepid dame  By bold assault essay'd the same  Fill'd with disgust he strove to fly  The artful glance and fearless eye  Their jargon he but faintly praises  Nor echoes back their flimsy phrases  He felt not CELIA'S powers of face  Till weigh'd against bonton grimace  Nor half her genuine beauties tasted  'Till with factitious charms contrasted  No moment's liberty he found  Th' industrious harpies hover'd round  By force and flattery circumvented  To play reluctant he consented  Each Dame her power of pleasing tried  To fix the novice by her side  Of  Pigeons  he the very best  Who wealth with ignorance possest  But FLAVIA'S rhetoric best perswades  That Sybil leads him to the shades  The fatal leaves around the room  Prophetic tell th' approaching doom  Yet different from the tale of old  'Twas  she  who pluck'd the tempting gold  Her arts the ponderous purse exhaust  A borrow'd thousand stak'd and lost  Wakes him to sense and shame again  Nor force nor fraud cou'd more obtain  He rose indignant to attend  The summons of a ruin'd friend  Whom keen BELLARIO'S arts betray  To all the depths of desperate play  The youth unconscious of deceit  Was plunder'd of his whole estate  Too late he look'd for friendship's aid  A beggar in a moment made  And now with horror FLORIO views  The wild confusion which ensues  Marks where th' infernal furies hold  Their orgies foul o'er heaps of gold  And demons dire appear to rise  Guarding the horrid mysteries  Marks how deforming passions tear  The bosoms of the losing fair  How haggard looks convulsive faces  Banish the frighten'd loves and graces  Touch'd with disdain with horror fir'd  He thought of CELIA and retir'd  That night no sleep his eyelids prest  He thought and thought's a foe to rest  Or if by chance he clos'd his eyes  What hideous spectres round him rise  Distemper'd Fancy wildly brings  The broken images of things  His ruin'd friend with eyeball fixt  Swallowing the draught Despair had mixt  The frantic wife beside him stands  With bursting heart and wringing hands  And every horror dreams bestow  Of pining Want or raving Woe  Next morn to check or cherish thought  His Library's retreat he sought  He view'd each book with cold regard  Of serious sage or lighter bard  At length among the motley band  The IDLER fell into his hand  Th' alluring title caught his eye  It promis'd cold inanity  He read with pleasure and surprise  And found 'twas charming tho' 'twas wise  His tea grew cold whilst he unheeding  Pursu'd this newdiscover'd reading  He wonder'd at the change he found  Th' elastic spirits nimbly bound  Time slipt without disgust away  While many a card unanswer'd lay  Three papers reeking from the press  Three Pamphlets thin in azure dress  Ephemeral literature well known  The lie and scandal of the town  Poison of letters morals time  Assassin of our day's fresh prime  These on his table all that day  Unthought of and neglected lay  FLORIO had now full three hours read  Hours which he us'd to waste in bed  His pulse beat Virtue's vigorous tone  The reason to himself unknown  And if he stopp'd to seek the cause  Fair CELIA'S image fill'd the pause  And now announc'd BELLARIO'S name  Had almost quench'd the newborn flame  "Admit him" was the ready word  Which first escap'd him not unheard  When sudden to his mental sight  Uprose the horrors of last night  His plunder'd friend before him stands  And"not at home" his firm commands  He felt the conquest as a joy  The first temptation wou'd destroy  He knew that next day Hymen's hand  Shou'd tack the slight and slippery band  Which in loose bondage wou'd ensnare  BELLARIO bright and FLAVIA fair  Oft had he promis'd to attend  The nuptials of his happy friend  He longs to gobut yet he fears  At length a bolder deed he dares  To CELIA he resolves to fly  And catch fresh virtue from her eye  Tho' three full weeks did yet remain  Ere he engag'd to come again  This plan he tremblingly embrac'd  With doubtful zeal and fluttering haste  Nor ventur'd he one card to read  Which might his virtuous scheme impede  Each note he dreaded might betray him  And shudder'd lest each rap shou'd stay him  Behold him seated in his chaise  With face that selfdistrust betrays  He hazards not a single glance  Nor thro' the glasses peeps by chance  Lest some old friend or haunt well known  Shou'd melt his resolution down  Fast as his foaming coursers fly  Hyde Park attracts his halfrais'd eye  He stole one fearful conscious look  Then dropt his eye upon his book  Long as he view'd AUGUSTA'S tow'rs  The sight relax'd his thinking pow'rs  In vain he better plans revolves  The softening sight his soul dissolves  The tow'rs once lost the smoke his eyes  Pursue while yet its volumes rise  Soon as he got entirely clear  From this enfeebling atmosphere  His mind was brac'd his spirits light  His heart was gay his humour bright  Thus feeling at his inmost soul  The sweet reward of selfcontroul  Impatient now and all alive  He thought he never shou'd arrive  At length he enter'd with delight  And selfannounc'd embrac'd the knight  The youth his joy unfeign'd exprest  The knight with joy receiv'd his guest  And own'd with no unwilling tongue  'Twas done like men when he was young  For CELIA not a word she said  But blush'd "celestial rosy red"  Her heighten'd charms transport the youth  Who promis'd everlasting truth  CELIA in honour of the day  Resolv'd her table to display  Such was the charm her sweetness gave  He thought her Wedgwood had been  séve  Her taste diffus'd a gracious air  And neat Simplicity was there  Whose secret power tho' silent great is  The loveliest of the sweet Penates  FLORIO had now forgot to wish  For aught besides the STANDING DISH  Sir GILBERT'S port he warmly praises  And carefully avoids French phrases  With patience hears a dissertation  On Landtax and a ruin'd nation  Listens to many a tedious tale  Of poachers who deserv'd a jail  Heard all the business of the Quorum  Of hapless damsels brought before 'em  Nor ever humm'd a single air  While good Sir GILBERT fill'd his chair  Abroad with joy and grateful pride  He walks with  CELIA  by his side  A thousand cheerful thoughts arise  Each rural scene enchants his eyes  With transport he begins to look  On Nature's allinstructive book  No objects now seem mean or low  Which point to HIM from whom they flow  A berry or a bud excites  A chain of reasoning which delights  And spite of sceptic ebullitions  Proves Atheists not the best Logicians  A tree a brook a blade of grass  Suggests reflections as they pass  'Till FLORIO with a sigh confest  The simplest pleasures are the best  BELLARIO'S systems sink in air  He feels the PERFECT GOOD and FAIR  When call'd to dress that Titus wore  A wig the alter'd FLORIO swore  Or else in estimating time  He ne'er had mark'd it as a crime  That he had lost but one day's blessing  When we so many lose by dressing  The rest suffice it now to say  Was finish'd in the usual way  Cupid impatient for his hour  Revil'd slow Themis' tedious power  Whose parchment legends signing sealing  Are cruel forms for Love to deal in  At length to FLORIO'S eager eyes  Behold the day of bliss arise  The flaming sun illumes the globe  The burning torch the saffron robe  Just as of old glad Hymen wears  And Cupid as of old appears  In Hymen's train so strange the case  They hardly knew each other's face  Yet both confess'd with glowing heart  They never were design'd to part  This selfsame sun and where's the wonder  Sees FLAVIA'S slight bands snapt asunder  BELLARIO sues for a divorce  And both pursue their separate course  Reader thy clemency to court  Tho' long the Tale the Moral's short  Yet dare I spite of Critic Satire  Suppose the Standing Dish GOOD NATURE  O gentlest blessing man can find  Sweet soother of the ruffled mind  As the soft powers of oil asswage  Of Ocean's waves the furious rage  Lull to repose the boiling tide  Whose billows charm'd to rest subside  Smooth the vext bosom of the deep  'Till every trembling motion sleep  Thy soft enchantments thus controul  The tumult of the troubled soul  By labour worn by care opprest  On THEE the weary mind shall rest  From business and distraction free  Delighted shall return to THEE  To THEE the aching heart shall cling  And find the peace it does not bring  Ye candidates for Earth's best prize  Domestic Life's sweet charities  O if your erring eye once strays  From smooth Goodnature's level ways  If e'er in evil hour betray'd  You chuse some vain fantastic maid  On such for bliss if you depend  Without the means you seek the end  A pyramid you strive to place  The point inverted for the base  You hope in spite of Reason's laws  A consequence without a cause  And you bright nymphs who bless our eyes  With all that skill that Taste supplies  Learn that accomplishments at best  Serve but for garnish in Life's feast  Yet still with these the polish'd wife  Shou'd deck the feast of human life  Wit a poor Standing Dish wou'd prove  Tho' 'tis an excellent Remove  Howe'er your transient guests may praise  Your gay parade on gala days  Yet know your husband still will wish  Goodnature for his Standing Dish  Still in Life's  Fasti  you presume  Eternal holidays will come  But in its highest happiest lot  O let it never be forgot  Life is not an Olympic game  Where sports and plays must gain the same  Each month is not the month of May  Nor is each day a holiday  Tho' wit may gild Life's atmosphere  When all is lucid calm and clear  In bleak Affliction's dreary hour  The brightest flash must lose its power  While Temper in the darkest skies  A kindly light and warmth supplies  Divine GOODNATURE 'tis decreed  The happiest still thy charm shou'd need  Sweet Architect rais'd by thy hands  Fair Concord's Temple firmly stands  Tho' Sense tho' Prudence rear the pile  Tho' each approving Virtue smile  Some sudden gust nor rare the case  May shake the building to its base  Unless to guard against surprises  On thy firm arch the structure rises  THE BAS BLEU OR CONVERSATION  ADDRESSED TO MRS VESEY  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following Trifle owes its birth and name to the mistake of a Foreigner of Distinction who gave the literal appellation of the  Basbleu  to a small party of friends who had been sometimes called by way of pleasantry the Blue Stockings The slight performance occasioned by this little circumstance was never intended to appear in print It is in general too local and too personal for publication and was only written with a wish to amuse the amiable Lady to whom it is addressed and a few partial friends But copies having been multiplied far beyond the intention of the Author she has been advised to publish it lest it should steal into the world in a state of still greater imperfection though she is almost ashamed to take refuge in so hackneyed an apology however true  THE BAS BLEU  VESEY of Verse the judge and friend  Awhile my idle strain attend  Not with the days of early Greece  I mean to ope' my slender piece  The rare Symposium to proclaim  Which crown'd th' Athenians' social name  Or how ASPASIA'S parties shone  The first  Basbleu  at Athens known  Nor need I stop my tale to shew  At least to Readers such as you  How all that Rome esteem'd polite  Supp'd with LUCULLUS every night  LUCULLUS who from Pontus come  Brought conquests and brought cherries home  Name but the suppers in th' Apollo  What classic images will follow  How wit flew round while each might take  Conchylia from the Lucrine lake  And Attic Salt and Garum Sauce  And Lettuce from the Isle of Cos  The first and last from Greece transplanted  Us'd herebecause the rhyme I wanted  How Pheasants' heads with cost collected  And Phenicopters' stood neglected  To laugh at SCIPIO'S lucky hit  POMPEY'S bonmot or CAESAR'S wit  Intemperance list'ning to the tale  Forgot the Mullet growing  Seneca says that in his time the Romans were arrived at such a pitch of luxury that the Mullet was reckoned stale which did not die in the hands of the guest  stale  And Admiration balanc'd hung  'Twixt PEACOCKS' brains and TULLY'S tongue  I shall not stop to dwell on these  But be as epic as I please  And plunge at once in medias res  To prove the privilege I plead  I'll quote some Greek I cannot read  Stunn'd by Authority you yield  And I not Reason keep the field  Long was Society e'errun  By Whist that desolating Hun  Long did Quadrille despotic sit  That Vandal of colloquial wit  And Conversation's setting light  Lay halfobscur'd in Gothic night  Till LEO'S triple crown to you  BOSCAWEN sage bright MONTAGU  Divided fellyour cares in haste  Rescued the ravag'd realms of Taste  And LYTTELTON'S accomplish'd name  And witty PULTNEY shar'd the fame  The Men not bound by pedant rules  Nor Ladies'  precieuses ridicules  For polish'd WALPOLE shew'd the way  How Wits may be both learn'd and gay  And CARTER taught the female train  The deeply wise are never vain  And she who SHAKESPEARE'S wrongs redrest  Prov'd that the brightest are the best  O how unlike the wit that fell  RAMBOUILLET  The Society at the Hotel de RAMBOUILLET though composed of polite and ingenious persons was much tainted with affectation and false taste See VOITURE MENAGE c  at thy quaint Hotel  Where point and turn and equivoque  Distorted every word they spoke  All so intolerably bright  Plain Common Sense was put to flight  Each speaker so ingenious ever  'Twas tiresome to be quite so clever  There twisted Wit forgot to please  And Mood and Figure banish'd ease  Poor exil'd Nature houseless stray'd  'Till SEVIGNE receiv'd the maid  Tho' here she comes to bless our isle  Not universal is her smile  Muse snatch the lyre which CAMBRIDGE strung  When he the  empty ballroom  sung  'Tis tun'd above thy pitch I doubt  And thou no music wou'dst draw out  Yet in a lower note presume  To sing the full dull Drawingroom  Where the dire  Circle  keeps its station  Each common phrase is an oration  And cracking fans and whisp'ring Misses  Compose their Conversation blisses  The Matron marks the goodly shew  While the tall daughter eyes the Beau  The frigid BeauAh luckless fair  'Tis not for you that studied air  Ah not for you that sidelong glance  And all that charming nonchalance  Ah not for you the three long hours  He worship'd the "Cosmetic powers"  That finish'd head which breathes perfume  And kills the nerves of half the room  And all the murders meant to lie  In that large languishing grey eye  Desistless wild th' attempt wou'd be  To warm the snows of Rhodope  Too cold to feel too proud to feign  For him you're wise and fair in vain  Chill shade of that affected Peer  Who dreaded Mirth come safely here  For here no vulgar joy effaces  Thy rage for polish ton and graces  Cold Ceremony's leaden hand  Waves o'er the room her poppy wand  Arrives the stranger every guest  Conspires to torture the distrest  At once they riseso have I seen  You guess the simile I mean  Take what comparison you please  The crowded streets the swarming bees  The pebbles on the shores that lie  The stars which form the galaxy  This serves t' embellish what is said  And shews besides that one has read  At once they riseth' astonish'd guest  Back in a corner slinks distrest  Scar'd at the many bowing round  And shock'd at her own voice's sound  Forgot the thing she meant to say  Her words halfutter'd die away  In sweet oblivion down she sinks  And of her ten appointments thinks  While her loud neighbour on the right  Boasts what she has to do tonight  So very much you'd swear her pride is  To match the labours of ALCIDES  'Tis true in hyperbolic measure  She nobly calls her labours  Pleasure  In this unlike ALCMENA'S son  She never means they shou'd be done  Her fancy of no  limits  dreams  No  ne plus ultra  bounds her schemes  Fir'd at th' idea out she flounces  And a new Martyr JOHN announces  We pass the pleasures vast and various  Of Routs not social but gregarious  And pleas'd to gentler scenes retreat  Where Conversation holds her seat  Small were that art which wou'd ensure  The Circle's boasted quadrature  See VESEY'S plastic genius make  A Circle every figure take  Nay shapes and forms which wou'd defy  All science of Geometry  Isosceles and Parallel  Names hard to speak and hard to spell  Th' enchantress wav'd her wand and spoke  Her potent wand the Circle broke  The social Spirits hover round  And bless the liberated ground  Ask you what charms this gift dispense  'Tis the strong spell of COMMON SENSE  Away fell Ceremony flew  And with her bore Detraction too  Nor only Geometric Art  Does this presiding power impart  But Chymists too who want the essence  Which makes or mars all coalescence  Of her the secret rare might get  How different kinds amalgamate  And he who wilder studies chose  Find here a new metempsychose  How forms can other forms assume  Within her Pythagoric room  Or be and stranger is th' event  The very things which Nature meant  Nor strive by art and affectation  To cross their genuine destination  Here sober Duchesses are seen  Chaste Wits and Critics void of spleen  Physicians fraught with real science  And Whigs and Tories in alliance  Poets fulfilling Christian duties  Just Lawyers reasonable Beauties  Bishops who preach and Peers who pay  And Countesses who seldom play  Learn'd Antiquaries who from college  Reject the rust and bring the knowledge  And hear it age believe it youth  Polemics really seeking truth  And Travellers of that rare tribe  Who've  seen  the countries they describe  Ladies who point nor think me partial  An Epigram as well as MARTIAL  Yet in all female worth succeed  As well as those who cannot read  Right pleasant were the task I ween  To name the groupes which fill the scene  But Rhyme's of such fastidious nature  She proudly scorns all Nomenclature  Nor grace our Northern names her lips  Like HOMER'S Catalogue of Ships  Oncefaithful Memory heave a sigh  Here ROSCIUS gladden'd every eye  Why comes not MARO Far from town  He rears the Urn to Taste and BROWN  His English garden breathes perfume  And promises perennial bloom  Here rigid CATO awful Sage  Bold Censor of a thoughtless age  Once dealt his pointed moral round  And not unheeded fell the sound  The Muse his honour'd memory weeps  For CATO now with ROSCIUS sleeps  Here once HORTENSIUS lov'd to sit  Apostate now from social Wit  Ah why in wrangling senates waste  The noblest parts the happiest taste  Why Democratic Thunders wield  And quit the Muses' calmer field  Taste thou the gentler joys they give  With HORACE and with LELIUS live  Hail Conversation soothing Power  Sweet Goddess of the social hour  Not with more heartfelt warmth at least  Does LELIUS bend thy true High Priest  Than I the lowest of thy train  These fieldflow'rs bring to deck thy fane  Who to thy shrine like him can haste  With warmer zeal or purer taste  O may thy worship long prevail  And thy true votaries never fail  Long may thy polish'd altars blaze  With waxlights' undiminish'd rays  Still be thy nightly offerings paid  Libations large of Limonade  On silver Vases loaded rise  The biscuits' ample sacrifice  Nor be the milkwhite streams forgot  Of thirstassuaging cool orgeat  Rise incense pure from fragrant Tea  Delicious incense worthy Thee  Hail Conversation heav'nly fair  Thou bliss of life and balm of care  Call forth the longforgotten knowlege  Of school of travel and of college  For thee best solace of his toil  The sage consumes his midnight oil  And keeps late vigils to produce  Materials for thy future use  If none behold ah wherefore fair  Ah wherefore wise if none must hear  Our intellectual ore must shine  Not slumber idly in the mine  Let Education's moral mint  The noblest images imprint  Let Taste her curious touchstone hold  To try if standard be the gold  But 'tis thy commerce Conversation  Must give it use by circulation  That noblest commerce of mankind  Whose precious merchandize is MIND  What stoic Traveller wou'd try  A sterile soul and parching sky  Or dare th' intemperate Northern zone  If what he saw must ne'er be known  For this he bids his home farewell  The joy of seeing is to tell  Trust me he never wou'd have stirr'd  Were he forbid to speak a word  And Curiosity wou'd sleep  If her own secrets she must keep  The bliss of telling what is past  Becomes her rich reward at last  Yet not from low desire to shine  Does Genius toil in Learning's Mine  Not to indulge in idle vision  But strike new light by strong collision  O'er books the mind inactive lies  Books the mind's food not exercise  Her vigorous wing she scarcely feels  'Till use the latest strength reveals  Her slumbering energies call'd forth  She rises conscious of her worth  And at her newfound powers elated  Thinks them not rous'd but new created  Enlighten'd spirits you who know  What charms from polish'd converse flow  Speak for you can the pure delight  When kindred sympathies unite  When correspondent tastes impart  Communion sweet from heart to heart  You ne'er the cold gradations need  Which vulgar souls to union lead  No dry discussion to unfold  The meaning caught as soon as told  But sparks electric only strike  On souls electrical alike  The flash of Intellect expires  Unless it meet congenial fires  The language to th' Elect alone  Is like the Mason's mystery known  In vain th' unerring sign is made  To him who is not of the  Trade  What lively pleasure to divine  The thought implied the hinted line  To feel Allusion's artful force  And trace the Image to its source  Quick Memory blends her scatter'd rays  'Till Fancy kindles at the blaze  The works of ages start to view  And ancient Wit elicits new  But wit and parts if thus we praise  What nobler altars shou'd we raise  Those sacrifices cou'd we see  Which Wit O Virtue makes to Thee  At once the rising thought to dash  To quench at once the bursting flash  The shining Mischief to subdue  And lose the praise and pleasure too  This is high Principle's controul  This is true continence of soul  Blush heroes at your cheap renown  A vanquish'd realm a plunder'd town  Your conquests were to gain a name  This conquest triumphs over Fame  So pure its essence 'twere destroy'd  If known and if commended void  Amidst the brightest truths believ'd  Amidst the fairest deeds atchiev'd  Shall stand recorded and admir'd  That Virtue sunk what Wit inspir'd  But let the letter'd and the fair  And chiefly let the Wit beware  You whose warm spirits never fail  Forgive the hint which ends my tale  Tho' Science nurs'd you in her bow'rs  Tho' Fancy crown your brow with flowers  Each thought tho' bright Invention fill  Tho' Attic bees each word distil  Yet if one gracious power refuse  Her gentle influence to infuse  In vain shall listening crowds approve  They'll praise you but they will not love  What is this power you're loth to mention  This charm this witchcraft 'tis ATTENTION  Mute Angel yes thy looks dispense  The silence of intelligence  Thy graceful form I well discern  In act to listen and to learn  'Tis Thou for talents shalt obtain  That pardon Wit wou'd hope in vain  Thy wond'rous power thy secret charm  Shall Envy of her sting disarm  Thy silent flattery sooths our spirit  And we forgive eclipsing merit  The sweet atonement screens the fault  And love and praise are cheaply bought  With mild complacency to hear  Tho' somewhat long the tale appear  Tis more than Wit 'tis moral Beauty  'Tis Pleasure rising out of Duty  THE END  Lately published by the same Author  SACRED
