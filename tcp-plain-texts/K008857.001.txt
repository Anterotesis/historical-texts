 THE TUTOR OF TRUTH BY THE AUTHOR OF THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE c c IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  However Hypocrisy may flourish for a time even its happiest moments are clouded and TRUTH shall at last prevail  LONDON Printed for RICHARDSON and URQUHART under the  Royal Exchange  M DCC LXXIX  TO LADY MILLER OF BATHEASTON VILLA THESE VOLUMES ARE INSCRIBED By her most obedient and Obliged humble Servant  THE AUTHOR  PREFACE  A Work which is in the world under the title of the PUPIL OF PLEASURE exemplified that part of a  late celebrated system  which led immediately to voluptuousness hypocrisy and seduction It was therefore a faint mark for literary ridicule The peculiar success of my  undertaking and the general esteem it still maintains notwithstanding the wilful or the ignorant perversions of a few individuals who affected to have their scruples concerning the character of  Sedley  convince me that I did not write in vain  But methinks something very essential yet remains to be done There is a much  better  as well as a much more  brilliant system  still to be illustrated the system of integrity and TRUTH  This is attempted in the  present  performance where the reader will see in contrast to the  Pupil of Pleasure  a character of a very different colouring figure before him One who though even more accomplished than SEDLEY with all his fire spirit and opportunity as well as every personal advantage employs each in the cause not of ruin but  sincerity  It has been endeavoured also that the scenes in which this new personage is engaged should be so disposed as to give full scope for all that is just affecting and ennobled  without departing from human nature The Hero of  this  production like that of the  other  hath many struggles and many anxieties for virtue with respect to  ordinary  successes and rewards is not always fortunate but between the two heroes there is throughout their adventures this distinguishing difference the one hath the pangs of  remorse  superadded to those of shame and despair and the sufferings of the other like the agonies of a Messiah are always for the truth and for the happiness of others All that the best men in the world can say to themselves  is comprized in this couplet of the poet  'Tis not in mortals to  command  success  But we'll do  more  Sempronius we'll  deserve  it  There have been those whether in the spirit of criticism or from principle I cannot tell who have warned the young and sober against the  warmth of character  in the  Pupil of Pleasure  surely a little thinking might reconcile to  them  as to the rest of the world the propriety of painting vice in strong colours in order to bring it into contempt That very SEDLEY who sets out with all the graces of  Chesterfield  in  his train soon loses his credit with the reader he fades towards the conclusion more and more in every page and at last he becomes a desperate detested man on whose grave even Pity herself can scarce be prevailed on to shed a tear  If however this objection in the breast of any one still subsists against me it would be a piece of justice not unworthy the  true  critic if he would take upon him to recommend the character of  Captain Carlisle  in this work as officiously as he has discommended that of Mr SEDLEY  in the other In real fact SEDLEY is the  shade  which will set CARLISLE in the proper  light  and although the  stories  through which I have conveyed the moral are utterly different yet those who are candid enough to conceive a book of this kind may be made  systematic  and who may read the two performances  together  will I flatter myself perceive a connexion with regard to system not wholly inapposite  In fine  Sedley  is a monster and  Carlisle  is a man Let them be accurately compared and read only  with this view whenever they are in the hands of the young As SEDLEY is the object of escape and abhorrence CARLISLE is that of intimacy and imitation He is much embarrassed but he has honour to bear him up he is purposely plunged in difficulty that his  truth  might be the more tried and that  being  tried it might like fine gold from the fire come forth the purer He is  Sedley  's opposite in every particular except the attractions of form which were given to SEDLEY also only to render  Chesterfieldism  more exact CARLISLE protects the innocence  that he might have destroyed he spares the chastity that he might have violated he endeavours to preserve the wife whom he might have ruined he has all the policy of prudence without deviating from  truth  he is graced with every polishing ornament of character instead of  corrupting  he  enriches  society  That the hero of the present work might have every  ultimate  advantage so as to bring the  moral  which his adventures convey more forcibly home to the business and bosom of the reader he appears at  different times in all the amiable  lights  of which his picture is susceptible Amongst these the honour of his friendships the tendernesses of his love the delicacy of his sufferings his discretion under embarrassments and his courage in exigencies will not escape the attentive reader It should be noted also that the contrast of the present with the former performance receives still greater force by the introduction of other sketches which will be found here particularly the short scenes that belong to Mr  Henry Hewson  and his brother These  characters are interwoven not so much to enliven and relieve the deepness of the pathetic in the other parts as to give greater elucidation to the  system  With the like view the characters of the fighting  Medway  and the fearful frolicksome Sir  Andrew Flight  have been admitted as have those of Mr  Lascelles  the  Marchioness of N  *** and  Lucia De Grey  It is hoped these all promote the moral as much as they contribute to the interests of the fable for example  Sedley  the Pupil of Pleasure was uniformly vicious deceitful and reprobate  and therefore  died  Captain  Carlisle  the Tutor of Truth is invariably just ingenuous and good and therefore  lives Sedley  often felt the stroke of ill success but consoled himself in the worst of times with the hope of accomplishing his wicked wishes at last  Carlisle  is sensible of disappointment too but is kept from paroxisms of despair by a silent appeal to his conscience  Lascelles  is at once rakish false dissolute and therefore meets with punishment The  Marchioness of N  *** though pitiable is also an object of terror to be held up to the female world since the same imprudence will naturally lead to the  same mifortunes The Earl and Countess of  Blessingbourne  are brought into this work to shew that  true politeness  and  the Graces  are charms independent of mere rank titles or estate the family of the  Hewsons  are here to prove that  true politeness  and the  Graces  are not to be bought as mere marketable commodities whenever a man happens to have money to spare and to prove likewise that neither rustic manners on the one hand nor bookish pedantry on the other will enable men to leave the farmhouse and the cloyster to figure more respectably in a state  of refinement In full opposition to  ll  these therefore the Hero of this work is produced He is as truly polite as he is truly generous and agreeable to the title given to him at setting outHe is A TUTOR OF TRUTH  THE TUTOR OF TRUTH  LETTER I Helter Skelter Hall Mr HENRY HEWSON to Mr GABRIEL HEWSON  Brother Gab  ACCORDING to custom I am to send you joy upon the  cassion  of grandfather's  stealing  off As you and I were  in at the death  and got such a swinging  edition  to our fortune it would  be the  most ungratefullest  thing in the world not to pray for the peace of the old fellow's soul seeing too that his body is now out of the way Our Parson says it behoves us to  direct  a bit of a monument to his memory for my part I see no matter in these same monuments none of the folk of our county need to be told what concerns old  Heidedger Hewson  and so what's the use of making a long  preachment  and flourishing away upon a marble slab about a dead man Parson prates so much about  gratitude  that I begin to think he  magines  we ought to tell it on tombstone about our fortune As 'tis a strange affair altogether I have a good mine to do thisnay I have already drawn up a piece of writing which I send you let me know in your answer by Nicholas the carrier whether 'twill do and whether you will be half the  money towards the  direction  of the monument seeing as how gold letters and church masonry and indeed all business about dead  corpsesses  comes heavy But yet I think we ought to  touch off  the old fellow with a few flourishes seeing that somebody may do the same for us one day or another Let me know how you  feel yourself  since you became a man of fortune Do you eat sleep talk walk as you didFor  my  part but I won't tell you a sillabel 'till you answer me I shall only say at present that I find I am no more the man I was since my fortune than a hare is like a handsaw Nevertheless  I am as much as ever Your loving brother to command HARRY HEWSON  PS  I  ha'n't  the gift of writing so  maybe  you  won't  easily  hit of  my letter besides my head aches with thinking  about my fortune  and then I am as stupid as a hound Wife is turn'd a madcap so I don't mention her only just to tell you she an't the woman she was  The inclosed Epitaph Intended by Mr H HEWSON for his grandfather HEIDEDGER'S Monument  Here or Hereabouts  Lies Mr Heidedger  Hewson  Who having  No Son  Nor  Daughter  To come  ater  Did when he was but bone and skin  Leave all to us his next of kin  Wherefore this marble slab  Out of respect  To shew we don't neglect  Was built by I and Gab  HENRY HEWSON  LETTER II Mr GABRIEL to Mr HENRY HEWSON  Sombre Hedges  Brother HENRY  IF any thing which relateth to that aweful period to which all human beings are precipitating and to which all that hath  vivification  must soon arrivethat period whereto every thing that is now sporting in the  jollities of sanity  must sooner or later comeI say brother were it possible for any thing so aweful so moral so moving so all thatto suffer the face to be upon the smile I could  border upon the simper  at certain turns in your epistle There are some few words in your favour misspelled for instance the words  cassion preachment magines corpsesses  c have not yet come under those eyes which have from first to last dipt into twenty thousand compositions Neither is your epitaph devoid of inaccuracies there being neither pathos in your poetry nor chastity in your rhyme all which is absolutely necessary to the present times  No son  does not echo very melodiously to  Hewson daughter  and  ater  might be improved  kin  and  skin  are so very near my dear HENRY that they absolutely seem one flesh their  sounds  are too similar  respect  and  neglect  may do but  slab  and  Gab  are the most preposterous words that ever terminated in the way of verse since rhyming began nor is a tombstone with any propriety called a marble slabNo HARRY  noyour meaning is as it ought to be but for your poetry the less you have to do with the Muses the better at least wait a little till my dictionary comes out and then if you have but a ray of Apollo it will have it out of you for I will take on me to say no work extant that  is  or that  shall  be will give a man such a knack or kindle in him such a  furor Phoebi  as I may call it as my dictionary  As to the monument I cherish your Parson's idea and will readily pay my  quota  Pray submit to your clerical friend who doubtless is a judge of these matters the following inscription 'Tis written  calamo currente  and therefore its  purities are questionable  but the idea is perhaps as competent as it should be  INSCRIPTION  The Tenderness of Consanguinity  Warmed by Benefaction  In the Bosom of two Brothers  HENRY and GABRIEL  Hath caused  To be indented upon the unconscious  Marble  These Letters of Gratitude  To the Memory  Of  HEIDEDGER HEWSON  Esq  Who tho' basking in the  Benignance  of Fortune  Was venerated by the Poor  And whose  Longevity  tho' it brought on  Imbecillity  Was not burthensome  To his Family  I will reply brother HENRY by post to the other parts of your letter NICHOLAS waits for this so that I cannot be explicit and besides which I am as little as you the man I was tho' I am always  Your affectionate brother GABRIEL HEWSON  LETTER III Mr HENRY to Mr GABRIEL  In answer  IT'S a lye GAB it's all a confounded lye you are just the man you ever was to a T or if there is any alteration 'tis ninety times nine out of a hundred for the worse You was always a  feller  who run rambling round about a story and never come to the end  on't  you know you was You always talked forty times more than needs must and the devil a word did you say to the pint  ater  all Thof you are a fine scholar I'l make five words go better to a bargain than you can ten at any  time  cuss  me if I believe you understand half you say  yourself  Don't you remember once at Skelter wake when a lady your partner fainted away with dancing and lost her handkerchief you saidI shall never forget it  "the sudorifical drops stood on azure forehead"  when the poor wench might have SWEATED for that it seems was your meaning her heart out for you for the devil an inch will you stir when that flea bites till all that is in your  cuss'd  crinkumcrankum cranium comes out And pray wise Sir who is obliged to understand your grecum latinum lingo do you think  I  was not cramb'd with such conundrums when I was young and I  ant  sorry for it now I'm turn'd of thirty  With regard to the answer you have made me 'tis no answer at all instead  of talking of your old grandfather's monument you have been plaguing yourself with my  noson  and  Hewson daughter  and  ater kin  and  skin Gab  and  slab  though if the truth were known they are as good as your  cillity  and  gevity nignance  and  guinity  and the like And as to your  dictionary  it may go for HARRY To cut the matter short brother I wrote you a very civil reasonable letter and in return you have sent me a  cussed  thing of which I can make neither head nor tail only I can see plain enough that you think yourself a very clever fellow and I no wiser than I should be for that matter GAB none of your family were conjurors and I don't believe you are the  senfiblest  o'um neither But to come to the point do you choose to answer my letter Saying I write like a fool is saying nothing I want to know whether  setting aside your Greek and Latin you are the man you was I have reasons good for  axing  this and if you don't like to make answer why you have only to say so and you never shall be troubled again by  HENRY HEWSON  LETTER IV ROBERT DE GREY  Esq  to Mr GABRIEL HEWSON  Prudence Green  Dear WARD  YOU did ill to reply so severely as you seem to have done to your brother HENRY literature you know is not his province and besides if it were you should not touch him on a part where every man upon earth is susceptible of smart A person may ever receive a wound if you aim at his understanding My dear and amiable Ward Mr  Carlisle  is so aware of this that tho' he is never guilty of a  falshood  I do not think he ever hurt a man in  his own esteem  in his life I expect you will pay so much honour to an old friend's advice as to make all  up  with HENRY directly He is a very honest odd man you have read and lived to little effect if you do not believe there are some things to pardon in yourself  Adieu  ROBERT DE GREY  LETTER V Mr GABRIEL to HENRY HEWSON  I MEANT no illnature to my dear HENRY by my lastfraternal tranquillity is the first wish of my heart and I write this hasty note to crave pardon for having unintentionally offended  him  whom the feelings of a brother as well as the sovereign laws of Nature  our imperial mistress  conjoin to render dear as "the ruddy drops" that  animate the pulse  of  GABRIEL HEWSON  P S  I will reply to your first letter sully tomorrow and deposit with you all the secrets that are in the recesses of my soul  LETTER VI Mr HENRY to Mr GABRIEL HEWSON  Dear GABBY  ENOUGH said I wish I had hold of your hand that I might shake it if it was not for those cursed fellows  Ocrates Ophacles Trully  and  Omare  who sometimes put you almost  beside yourself  I know we should never exchange a warm word I lov'd you when you was not worth a coat off and a coat on I like you neither more nor less now you are worth ten thousand pound So write me all about what I desire and I will then tell you  why  I am in good will Your loving brother HENRY HEWSON  LETTER VII Mrs HENRIETTA HEWSON to Miss DE GREY  Madam  THE pleasure I expected in your company this season at Helter Skelter Hall must of necessity be postponed till the summer following Every thing is at sixes and sevens besides which the large addition to my fortune makes it very improper I should see my friends in the  huggermugger  manner I did while I was as poor as my neighbours I have positively found out my dear DE GREY that there is not a single room in this up and down old mansion fit to sit in much less to receive  the most delicate of her sex But since I am deprived of the pleasure I expected in having you with me as usual I propose to commence a correspondence with you that I may tell you from time to time how we go on in those alterations that I am resolved immediately to make I design to fit up the sweetest retreat in the universe your father's not excepted I say  retreat  because I shall occasionally retreat to it for I certainly shall not pass my winters for the future out of PallMall  that  is I think I have heard you say the best quarter of the town besides its having the double recommendation of being the winter residence of Miss DE GREY  Just as I writ your name I happened to look at the chimneypiece and I absolutely thought it had undergone a perfect change within this week as indeed  in my opinion hath every thing about the house I cannot look at an object in the hall or the great garden that does not disgust me Heaven have mercy on me how they wanted taste in building formerly Such huge horrid outward doors studded with such monstrous nobs of non such dreadful arches to every entrance like the porches of ugly stonework before a church such corners lanes entries and alleys running like laby rinths through every room the fireplaces so large the windows so little the glass of them so diminutive the wainscotings so figured the beams so bulky and the passages so dark and dirty that they seem built rather to be the dens for beasts of prey than for such harmless little creatures as men and women Then the gardens are as hideous as the habitations only to think LUCIA of a  consumed  great mote divided only by  a nasty drawbridge running quite round the mansion most gloriously cropped with duckweed and inviting all the fowls of the air to flap their wings and feed about us to the great annoyance of sleep and every other comfort Add to this the gardens  themselves  I am now lifting up my head from the vulgar old table on which I am writing and I am takingI declare to you almost with tears in my eyesa view of our precious platform I behold in prospect about three acres of ground as completely murdered in the disposition as a modern gardener could wish eightandtwenty yewtrees interspersed with an equal number of boxes and hollies rise before me to whose flourishing shades I am to attribute half the vermin that swarm like a pestilence about us Let not the abominable walls that surround our dwelling and its environs be  forgotten high above all height brown above every thing embrownedBut I have not patience to proceed And shall I invite the lovely LUCIA to this Gothic scene No LUCIA no now that kind Fortune hath put it into my power I will level with the dust this ruinous pile of building and raise up in its stead so different a structure that the very ground shall thank me for  dressing it out  so charmingly The moment I have compleated my design you shall come and confess I have a relish for improvements I have this moment the exact image of my intentions Where there are now mountains will I make vallies where there are at present crops of nettles or vulgar flowers that are to me worse than nettles will I set rows of lillies and beds of roses roses I mean of  moss  that scarce burst forth from the bearded bud elegant small odoriferous  and not such flaring flashing oldfashioned things as figure away in our garden that look as if the seeds were sown and the trees planted immediately after the fall just when all the beautiful in Nature first felt the curse upon it As to the yewtrees I will not leave one of them alive no not even that which is cut into the form of a sugarloaf and so inveterate is my vengeance in regard to these that I will yea even after they are fell'd make the infected wretches perform quarantine at a mile's distance in open air before I will allow them the honour of being  burned  in my presence as to my old friend the  mote  with whom I have exchanged watry looks ever since I saw him I will cause all his channels to be dried up and  terra firma  as brother GAB calls it to flourish about him The drawbridge will I also remove and to  shew my dislike and ridicule of such an antique I will substitute by way of mockery and the mode an ha ha in his stead Neither shall any part of our  house furniture  fare better for there shall be a general  clearance  Stags heads shall give place to Hogarth's prints family pictures notwithstanding the large ruffs on my grandmother's neck the whiskers on my great uncle's upper lip and the profusion of chitterlin on my godpapa's bosom must all yield to politer decorationsIn short I will create a paradise about me and that without delay In the mean time I will  commence  the woman of fashion by giving orders never to be seen by any body but tradesmen till I am all  torights  not even by LUCIA DE GREY How I shall bring Mr HEWSON over to this genteel way of thinking I don't know particularly as he is not you  know the best bred man in the world However done it must bethat's flat for I cannot breathe any longer in such a place Oh Heavens how have I breath'd so long It is equally an affront to my person my understanding and my fortune If any little ornaments strike  you  that may assist my scheme of embellishing pray think of them in your next I design to call one of my new rooms  Lucia  's  Saloon  Pray therefore let LUCIA's fancy assist me in fitting it up  Adieu Adieu  HENRIETTA HEWSON  P S  Have you had any news yet of Captain CARLISLE  LETTER VIII Mr GABRIEL to Mr HENRY HEWSON  Sombre Hedges  YES brother yes thou beloved branch of the same family thou dear scyon of the same stock I again confess I am not in any degree the man I was This sudden  gale of gay Prosperity  whose beams are so burnished to the eyes of fragile mortals hath I confess a good deal interrupted the oeconomy of my former affairs which were too scanty to distract attention and too abstract  from all circumvolutions  to require much  mathematical diligence  Two days before the sudden exit of  him  to  whom I am indebted for this weight of wealth I was as still and studious a man as bachelorship and neat  l    s per annum  could make me I had a decent collection of classics I had Homer in honest sheepskin binding Horace with a little edging of gold and Cicero my dear Cicero with his name upon the back of every volume I had besides just such a houshold as suited well the  propensities of my sequestered notions  I had an old creature who prepared my beverage and was so used to my humour that she always went out to cough when I was at my studies I had a toothless dog that slept away his leisure and was too feeble to disturb me by barking and my cat was the quietest animal that ever purred at the elbow of a scholar in a cloister Sombre Hedges were exactly to my passion The two prodigious trees whose  overshadowing  ramifications  spread the  sublime of darkness visible  over my cottage gave such a  setoff  to my study that I was absolutely the hero of an hermitage I sat and read till I fancied myself in  the fervor of the intellectual feelings  a philosopher in the shades In the dim hour of evening I used to be the companion of the sootypinioned bat and walked forth to meditate on the readings I had made in the day I rejoiced in the name that the people of the village gave me and I had a secret pride in seeing them in the twilight stealing a look at the learned gentleman in the dark house i'th' midst of Sombre Hedges I was just lighting up my lamp and setting down to a chapter of Cicero with Grimalkin by my side when news of my new honours broke like too mighty a flood of light upon the serenity of my darkness I was dazzled and knew  not what to do For want of habitude wealth like a robe first put on and made  not consonant to our usual fashion  sat uneasy upon me As my soul was not fitted to my fortune neither was my fortune fitted to my soul I hit upon a passage where Tully the prince of Latian eloquence recommended an equal mind in all revolutions an hour  before  I should have given to the very printed page an holy kiss of approbation but at present it was no such matterI was now to consider myself as master of ten thousand pounds and I was taken so unawares that I trimmed my lamp in order to see the  will  clearer and when I had the misfortune to find the thing was  certain  I was much agitated and crept at length into the closet which contained the wholesome bed of a scholar upon the surface of which I laid  down with a heart that throbbed and a head that ach'd till the morning  I rose early brother but not to my accustomed satisfaction for I found my feelings were altered Those small but dear attentions which the day before belonged to an estate of  l per  year were over I could not any longer think I was the proprietor of a snug box when the load of ten thousand pounds sell abruptly upon my shoulders in the lump I never looked into a book that whole day and to say truth I hardly thought there was a  cover  in my study fit to come into the hand of a man of fortune Was it not some Demon think you that put it into my head to take down three days after the only  coxcomb  volume in my whole library and the scope of this was to recommend taste elegance fashion and commerce  with men on purpose to give a finishing to the man of speculation With an avidity for which I despise myself did I peruse this work quite through and from that moment I became a prophane excentric dissipated fellow I said unto the woodman Fell me those horrid trees that hide me from  the blooming face of Phoebus  down instantly with these children of darkness that there may be light I am ashamed to tell you that I directed my windows to be cleaned yea even the little lattice that emitted scarce half a sunbeam into my library and which was almost vegetable with the overgrowth of ivy did I order to be laid bare to all the splendors of day Why should I conceal the most  egregious  of my follies I have at this minute two artificers in my house and perhaps the passion may gain such sway in a few hours that by tomorrow the cornerstone  of the building may not be suffered to stand I am already  not  the dark gentleman of Sombre Hedges but the poor fellow who hath like a swallow in the winter emerged unseasonably from his corner to blind himself with light Upon the whole my heart like my house is totally disarranged I pray Heaven  yours  may be more composed and I hope to hear that your hopes and happiness stand just where they did before the death of our kinsman HEIDEDGER  I am dear brother Your's GABRIEL HEWSON  LETTER IX Mr HENRY HEWSON to Mr GABRIEL  In answer  I LIKE you ten times better than ever for I finds  you  are as much altered as  I  am There never was a more miserable dog than either of us I dare not say this  before  for fear you should laugh at me but now that I find you are as strange a fellow as myself I tell you without farther  permable  that I hant shot a partridge  this  three weeks and my dogs are yelping in the kennel for fresh air and their sport People now give me so much  joy  when I go about that I am quite  miserable My wife HETTY too has been  at  me about  pliteness  and bids me look in the glass to see if it is not a sin and a shame for such a  parsonable  man as I to go such a figure and shut myself up in an old timber house among hounds and horses guns and game traps She says I should be a very  sightly  man if beard was smoothed oftner and ruffles put on wristbands after the fashion of young Captain CARLISLE She says too we might now alter our course of life and live upon our wealth like Mr and Mrs Somebody in a different guess place than Helter Skelter Hall Upon this I clapt me on a clean shirt and a pair of silken stockings after I had doft leathern hunting breeches and without  shamming  I verily thought what with the powder in my hair and ribbon behind in beauknot not forgetting black crevat  which the jade tied so as to make me lookI don't know howI was one of your  bettermost  persons As I was walking along the large hall thus  quipp'd  old Dashgrove the setting bitch barked at me as if she did not known Master HENRY thro' his finery upon which I lent her a  douze  to teach her how to behave to man of  pliteness  after this Tippler the spaniel came and fawn'd on me leaving the track of her paws on my silken stockings upon which I favoured her also with such a  flick  that the poor thing howled for a quarter of an hour In short I can't help speaking  hash  and taking a little upon me more than usual and this was partly the  casion  of my writing you such a rough letter for I finds I am grown devilish  touchey  since I  came  to be a great man and SUSAN the maid says I am not like to be much the  better  for my riches  seeing that I have got  them  and lost my goodnature I am most consumedly troubled to know  what to do  and mayhap  that  makes me growl more than I otherwise should Sometimes I think of giving up my farm at Skelter sometimes of buying racing horses sometimes of making myself  cussed  gay in the  pareil  way sometimes I have a mind to  crackle  it away in a coach sometimes to put worsted of different colours on JOE JOBSON's coat and clap a  cue  to his headBut then again I can't help telling HETTY this would be damn'd nonsense for a  feller  like I who have as good a pair of legs as ever worked under a man and who has gone rough as he run  this  many  day I wish grandfather had thought fit to let us know what he meant to do for us about four or five years  agone  that we might have prepared ourselves to be gentlemen  against he died With such warning I don't doubt but I should have been scholar enough to deck myself off to strut forth with a little black bag at the end o'me and to have popp'd in and out of a carriage very decently for damn it I know how the thing should  goe  tho' I can't so neatly  do  it As to Captain CARLISLE neither you nor I can ever expect to cut the  dash he  cuts 'case why he was papp'd in  pliteness  and suck'd civility in his cradle besides which he has travelled for it far and near so that all the difference in that there matter lies only in the alteration you know But for all that if we could when he comes from  broad  which is to be soon get  into's  company now and then and take notice how he carries himself how he talks opens his lips and the like I don't doubt but we could make ourselves no small fools in the  way of  haviour  when he is not  by  At present as I can't think of doing as I did because HETTY says that would be very unnatural I am horridly  out of sorts  and know not what will be the end  on't  I think as you are the best scholard you ought to write to Mr DE GREY  bout  it cause he had once the care of us and as the world says made Captain CARLISLE what he is  To live thus is out of the question so pray think of mending the matter HETTY is airing me another ruffled shirt and says I must shift every day now I am a man of property The linen is rare and hot so I must ene put it on have only time therefore to say that  I am Your afflicted brother HAL HEWSON  LETTER X Mrs HEWSON to Miss DE GRAY  CONGRATULATE me sing songs of triumph to me my dear DE GREY I have brought Mr HEWSON over to my  politest wishes  A little flattery and a lookingglass have compleated the business All the fine things I design may be put in practice assist me therefore I beg of you that I may be  perfectly elegant  Every hint of your  taste  will be now welcome to the impatient  HENRIETTA HEWSON  LETTER XI Captain CARLISLE to ROBERT DE GREY  Esq  London  My dear Guardian  THE spirit of affection and duty made me hasten to leave the gardens of Italy that I might be in time to enjoy the pleasures of Prudence Green at this beautiful period of the year That which was Rome herself had no charms to attract me when the lure of such a society as that which your letter describes to me was thrown out for my heart And is it possible that I am so soon to return again to all those bewitching  scenes wherein I first received those admirable precepts which have hitherto enabled me to resist temptation in almost every form I am in London Nothing can seduce me to continue here beyond the time that is absolutely necessary to my journey so that I shall be at Prudence Green almost as soon as this short letter which announces me to you yet if there should be a moment's advantage on the side of the letter pray employ it to tell Miss DE GREY and the rest of your party how lingeringly I shall think the time till I salute them  I am Sir Your ever saithful servant And indulged friend CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER XII From the Same to Mr LASCELLES in London  London  Dear LASCELLES  I AM in the most distressing state of mind in the worldthe Lady of the Marquis of N with whom I was on friendly terms in Italy hath very inadvertently and under colour of an attachment which I never before discovered followed me to England To my utter astonishment she is now before me too beautiful to be denied protection and yet in a situation on all hands too sacred for me long to bestow it She  set off in a packet that sailed it seems at the same time mine did She is in the habit of a boy her husband doats upon her She looks with the brightest eyes into my face while with the most persuading voice she tells me she is in a strange land where she knows not a single friend What is to be done She came in upon me just after I had sent Mr DE GREY's letter to the post so that it cannot be recalled and truth requires my promises should be fulfilled But the Lady must be some way accommodated at least till she can be persuaded to return to the Marquis  To  your  care therefore I commit her for a little time and I shall in the evening when I have reconciled her to this mode bring the fair fugitive to your house where in the mean time you will prepare your sister to receive  her Tell her at once the  truth  and depend on it  that  will ever in the end turn out for the best  Farewell I am your's C CARLISLE  LETTER XIII From the Same to the Same  After delivering the Lady to the latter  I WRITE this to my dear LASCELLES with a hand that trembles for the situation of your fair charge She discovered methought as I delivered her to you an impatience of temper that may be fatal She talks of her husband with an ardour of resentment that I believe it is impossible so accomplished a man should have deserved I feel a compunction not very unlike reproach at being obliged to refuse her my address Do you not agree with me that strong marks of disapprobation  were painted in her countenance when I observed that all her sentiments would reach me by inclosing them either sealed or unsealed to you I did propose to have set out this day for Mr DE GREY's but I must apologize for a little delay because I judge it best to see how she settles with your family and to write to the Marquis before I venture into the country where I had flattered my imagination with enjoying the most uninterrupted happiness As she is a native of England you know it is possible you may by some means trace out her relations some of whom are as I have been informed in London and yet till we have the Marquis's answer it may perhaps be a more  delicate  piece of integrity to keep the matter out of every body's mouth but the worthy family to whom it was necessary to entrust it On second thoughts therefore I beg  matter may rest where it is in your faithful bosom and in that of Miss LASCELLES In the mean time if AUGUSTA remains prudent and composed the whole indiscretion may be done away every thing may be hushed and the Marquis be again made happy without the confusion of being congratulated by people who turn accidents into tabletalk For my  own  part I dare say it will be easy for me to convince the husband that I dealt honourably At best the dilemma is very displeasing and the only way lest is to act in it and to struggle through it as becomes a man of prudence and principle  I have the great satisfaction to be Dear LASCELLES your's C C  LETTER XIV The Marchioness of N to Signora D at Rome  I FOLLOWED him my VIOLA I practised to the very utmost my more than romantic resolutionI eluded even the vigilance of the MarquisI never lost sight of the exquisite CARLISLEI surmounted every fatigueI passed every where as a beardless youth of the Italian soil and I am now returned to those shores from whence I drew my first breath and from whence I was so early carried to that part of your country where he who is now my husband first saw me  Yes VIOLA I am hereI am in LondonI am within a short mile of the house of CARLISLEBut alas to what purpose My passion is in despair my mode of gratifying it has been irregularI blush at my weaknessbut I am still weak enough to loveto love Viola with a fervor that is equally my shame and my agony Yet I propose only to be within his viewa sight of hima touch of his handhis conversationhis smile These were my ambition violent as I am I tell you the extent of my guilt But th  ese are already denied me He has left me in charge of his friends who are brother and sisterthey treat my misfortune with tendernessthe sister speaks warmly of Mr CARLISLE's virtues I perceive that the words  honourable  attachment are favouritesConfusion VIOLA perhaps she isyet that's  not likelyI will not have it so I could not bear it At a village on the borders of Italy my speed brought me near enough to see him salute a female acquaintance and though modesty and reason all concurred to sanctify the civility yet I wanted dignity enough in my nature to restrain the execration which I uttered against her beauty No no it is some comfort yet even were I never more to behold him which would kill meit is some comfort yet that his heart is without other attachments  My condition calls for ten thousand comforts and I foresee not  one  will be allowed meI have numberless circumstances to tell you but I want ease and composure to write The Marquis has I suppose left Rome in a rage For the first time in my life although I have long despised him have I taken  advantage of his confidence but it was only to escape from the object of my aversion to that of my fondnessof my adoration  Perhaps the Marquis may suspect every thing I was so cautious to conceal If so my dear CARLISLE is in danger I am not ignorant of the Marquis's temper I have  felt  its violence He struck me VIOLA the villain in his meanness struck me I never shall either forget or forgive it  CARLISLE in dangerIn danger for whatfor his unparallelled  integrity  for his dignityfor his  truth  Ah Signora were he the most guilty instead of being the most innocent of men my romantic soul would take fire at the prospect of his peril and set life fame hope and Heaven itself at a  hazard to defend him I am interruptedLet  my  secret be  your's  Adieu for a little time to The wretched AUGUSTA N***  LETTER XV GEORGE LASCELLES  Esq  to Captain CARLISLE  ABOUT two hours ago AUGUSTA very earnestly requested the use of pen and paper which you may be sure was directly brought her She hath since had wax and a candle and I suppose will presently desire a letter to be put into the PostofficeIt may very possibly my friend be addressed to some friend of  her  's or  your  's in one case we might perhaps were we in  possession of the facts  escape danger and in the other we might it is likely get a clue to those circumstances which would bring this disagreeable affair the  sooner to an issue Either way it may serve our purposes I shall therefore instead of putting this letter into the post inclose it for you that no opportunity of assisting us may escape  Adieu I am your's GEORGE LASCELLES  LETTER XVI Captain CARLISLE  In answer  YOUR zeal to serve a friend must have thrown you from your guard my dear LASCELLES for I am certain it could not require more than a moment's recollection to convince you of the  impropriety  of breaking a seal for any private purpose whatsoever Neither you nor I have certainly any farther controul over the lady than just to entertain her as her condition may require till she is invited home by the Marquis to whom I was preparing to write just as your favor came to hand  I lay aside this business however for a minute just to intreat you will suffer your servants to obey  her  wishes as you would I know order them to obey the wishes of  Your's C CARLISLE  LETTER XVII Captain CARLISLE to the Marquis of N*** at Signor 's in Rome or elsewhere  London  SIR  WERE it not that your situation called rather for condolence than mirth I could acquaint you in very jocular language of a circumstance that carries with it the air of an adventure in the days of chivalry  The heroine or rather the ladyerrant of this enterprize is your AUGUSTA who taking advantage of your journey  about the time of my departure was resolved to be even with you for the anxieties of separation and so paid you  in kind  by taking a trip to England I dare say she intended at first only to amuse herself with a short excursion to deceive the time till your return but the spirited creature with all that ardor which you know belongs to her character laid her plan of operation in such a manner that when she was once embarked it was absolutely impossible to retreat She contrived the matter so as to pass upon every body for an Italian stripling travelling to England properly equipped for the opera house the better to support which she was provided with suitable habiliments and above all a distinguishing kind of headdress that masked her from every thing but the most critical inspection It will demand all your  best opinion of my veracity to credit me when I protest to you that she escaped  my  notice through the whole journey nor was I acquainted with any part of the circumstance till in compleating the project she discovered herself to me in my own apartments in London It was not for  me  to upbraid her upon the principle of the pain you was suffering nor was it proper she should remain with one who has not the honour to be in the married state I therefore advised her to be as easy as her reflections would allow at the house of a particular friend of mine who has a sister that will preserve her safe till she is once more in the arms of her Marquis The step she has taken was certainly carrying the joke too far and no doubt she herself thinks so but when you consider her youth her high spirits her wellknown fidelity to you and  above all the perils she has safely passed without a single soul to protect her you have I think on the whole rather more reason to laugh it off as a frolic than to chide her for it as an impropriety  Whatever mode of receiving her you propose shall be attended to and if you cannot come all the way yourself I will see that she is reconducted to the borders of Italy or even to your very house in Rome or to that in Paris if you judge it necessary Your answer will determine me in every thing that relates to the lady whom I have the honour in the mean time to have in protection Be assured Sir the trust is as safe as it is sacred and that I am with all a friend's anxiety Your  Most obedient humble servant CLEMENT CARLISLE  P S  Your lady Sir is at the house of Mr LASCELLES in Bondstreet London whither you will please to direct your reply and where should you on the present or any future occasion choose to visit London I take the liberty of friendship to say you will be cordially received  LETTER XVIII The Marchioness of N*** to Mr CARLISLE  Inclosed by Mr Lascelles  I MUST see you though it be but for five moments but since it is so very irksome to you I give you a whole week to  prepare  yourself for a visit in the mean time your repose shall not be invaded by  Your AUGUSTA N***  LETTER XIX Mr GABRIEL HEWSON to ROBERT DE GREY Esq  SIR  MY brother dear to me by affinity of blood and by the coadjoining bonds of a settled friendship my brother and I Sir have lately been much inveloped  in the deep abyss of meditation  The additions to our fortunes have as is but too generally the case brought with them additions of  carking care  and  perturbed reflection  we find it impossible to enjoy ourselves as we used to do before the benevolence of Fate distinguished us by her splendid favours My  brother is unable to take the salutary exercises of the fields and forests  crown'd with leafy honours  and I for my part can find neither gaiety in Horace nor argument in Tully We conceive something should be done to make riches  sit easy  on us We believe books will not do this for me nor hounds for him In fine we are sollicitous  even to a considerable degree of anxiety  to acquire a relish of those exterior ornamentals which so particularly mark you and Captain CARLISLE from all men of our acquaintance We understand the Captain is shortly to be at the Green and therefore as your indulging nature has very often pressed upon us an invitation we could conjointly wish it might be  agreeable to your leisure  and  consonant to your convenience  to permit us to pass a few days under the  sanctification of your hospitality  while the Captain  is with you that we may have the advantage of making ourselves very passable copies from the  reiterated imitation of so admirable an original  My brother HENRY and I Sir are very impatient for the honour of your answer to this  our consequential request  Sir  I am Your's reverentially GABRIEL HEWSON  LETTER XX Mr HENRY HEWSON to ROBERT DE GREY Esq  Hon Guardian that was  I UNDERSTANDS that GAB has  'form'd  you of our resolution to be  bettermost  persons whereof the reason's good and natural seeing that we are not the folks we  was  seeing we are richer our  ideerers  are no more the same they  was  than any thing and I  ha  ' put it  into  's head to see what hand may be made on us  supposin  we had a good sightly  moral  before us For certain the  Captain  is as fine a pattern as need to be taken for any man's  sample  and you are no  small fool at making a bow yourself You and he therefore are the men we mean to cut out by and my HETTY would have no  'jection  to make a sample of your daughter who every body must own has more the jig of a gentlewoman than any body within ten miles  o'her  I send these few lines by JOE just to clap brother GAB's letter as it were on the back and do the thing more  plitely  for certainly the more  parsons  write to a man out of one family the more respectful We understands also that you are to have visitors  go lore  over and above the Captain  That  we have no sort of  rejection  to 'case why We are sure for  sartain  none are harboured at Prudence Green but your  tiptop specie  So much the better for  we  'case why As we go on purpose to make a hand on't and get as much as we can out of every body why we can take one bit  of haviour from one another bit from another and so on till we are  up  to the whole gig of the thing HETTY is 'ene almost ready to fly over the moon upon  casion  of thisshe's a  duced  cute one at taking any thing in hand she has a mind to and I  surspect  she'll pull the feathers out of the fine ones till she's as pretty a bird as the best of them I'd lay two o' my teeth to a  teester  that she bridles and briggles to a nicety in less time than I shall want to make me doff hat with decency for to tell you the truth I have a cussed way of being  cover'd  in company and I think it's a pity you was not guardian of my manners as well as my moneyBut I have said enough to shew you what I would be at and therefore I have no  casion  to make a long affair  ont  like Master GAB who I don't doubt has muddled his brains never so long to write to you a fine long  rigmerol  and pick and choose words  out of  diksonnerry  Mayhap I may be one of your better sort as soon as he for all his scholarship not that I would have you  magine  'Squire I don't think GAB knows how to handle a pen but I think a man may talk a little  plainer  than GAB aye and  write  a little plainer too for I do  sure  you parson of our parish who put on his gown at  varsity  has sometimes enough to do to make him  out  when he writes his  flourididdles  to me and HETTY says he is no more fit for  pliteness  than my dog Dashgrove But this is  atween  ourselves 'Squire I have written my paper  all through  purpose 'case you should not be  fended  and if it had been more I would  ha'  gone to the end  on't  I  'sure  you for you are just the sort of man I like and after all I don't know when I come to set  this  over against  that  whether I sha'n't take more of the bettermost person from  you  than  from the Captain himself I am with HETTY's love to Miss DE GREY  Your dutiful friend to command HENRY HEWSON  P S  I think I would not have you say to any of the folks at the Green what  lay  GAB and I are upon for 'tis natural to think gentlemen and ladies who have bought breeding and  pliteness  dear may not choose to have as it were their pockets pickt on't by a couple of chaps who come  a purpose  to carry off the  best part of 'em  I should not like it myself  LETTER XXI Miss DE GREY to Mrs HEWSON  Dear Madam  MY father is writing billets of invitation to your husband and brother and he hath assigned to me the pleasing task of requesting you will not forget to join our society which is to meet on the th instant when it is expected the Green will be exceedingly gay Besides Captain CARLISLE there will be a Lord and Lady BLESSINGBOURNE and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT their nephew they are all persons who are able to form the taste as far as it depends on fashionable carriage At  the same time if you will take my advice it would rather recommend to you the perpetuation of your original content than any attempts at copied splendor But this is a sentiment out of the line of my commission and the letter you favoured me with will better be answered in conversation than upon paper Do not forget the th and remember in the mean time  Your most obedient servant LUCIA DE GREY  P S  Mr MEDWAY is already with us  LETTER XXII OLIVER MEDWAY  Esq  to Mr TOWNSEND  I HAD scarce set my foot on Prudence Green when DE GREY put into my hand a letter which not only mentions the arrival of CARLISLE in England but his coming post into the country This news was confirmed by the charming LUCIA with a smile upon her face In my opinion TOWNSEND a  better intentioned  smile than she ever bestowed upon me To be sure an old friend hath a claim upon one's cordiality and no man deserves so large a share as Captain CARLISLENo man better loves him and his virtues than  I  doand certainly a smile upon the subject of  expecting  him was not wrong But why so very  kind  a formation of the features why must the eyes sparkle so brilliantly on the occasion why this rapture so directly upon the very front of his arrivalI have the tenderest regard for CARLISLE in the world but if confusionI must not be sported withmy passion is too nice too noble and too near my heart for that I must look about me a little  Adieu Your's OLIVER MEDWAY  LETTER XXIII From the Same to Captain CARLISLE in London  Dear CARLISLE  AFTER having told you in a few words that you are as welcome to me as ever was friend to friend I must ask you a question which if you have time as your last billet to Mr DE GREY mentioned a short delay I intreat you will answer by the post even before you come amongst us You are not ignorant of my regard for LUCIA I have sent you from time to time fifty sheets of paper on the subject I have reason to think  you  are as great a favourite as  myself No woman should dare to divide her heart I insist upon an  entire  passion or none You know my humour I love you above all men but if you have  even in thought  supplanted me let the needful be done without noise Seconds are out of the question when combatants know each other You are as brave as Heaven I am not apt to retreat myself There was a sort of satisfaction in LUCIA's face I must absolutely have  explained  I have in DE GREY's green paddock the best and fleetest horse in England at this time grazingHe  knows  when I travel upon  life and death  you understand me  Farewell till I see you  Your sincere friend O MEDWAY  P S  The rest of DE GREY's party come to night our laughing philosopher and whimsical wag Sir ANDREW is in the groupe  LETTER XXIV Captain CARLISLE's Answer  How can you my dear MEDWAY still continue your cruel humour How few moments thinking would have been necessary to set your fluttering heart to rest on every subject that concerns LUCIA DE GREY The vehemence with which you first disclosed your passion to me and the large strides you said you had made towards gaining HER affections put an entire end to all attempts which perhaps might otherwise have been made by  me  upon the subject Neither by look nor letter have I ever since that time addressed any thing to LUCIA that aimed at her  heart and your three latest letters which came to my hands in Italy wherein you assure me your tenderness for that lady is fully  returned  put such an additional check upon my conduct that I looked upon the business as too far gone for any third person except Mr DE GREY who it seems approves the match to interfere without infamy Besides that I shall embrace you shortly I have just now such a kind of engagement to fulfill that I must apologize for having replied to your letter so hastily I am as for many years I have been  Dear MEDWAY's affectionate friend CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER XXV Captain CARLISLE to GEORGE LASCELLES Esq  WHAT is to be done now my dear LASCELLESa circumstance hath fallen out even worse than the affair of AUGUSTA Mr DE GREY forgot to inform me that the only person whom I should not meet at Prudence Green would make a distinguished member of his summer society But yet how should he imagine it was necessary to apprize me of it knowing as he does of our long friendship and  not  knowing there is any  delicate matter  on which it depends The nature of my difficulty will appear to you better when  I tell you  Medway  is of the party MEDWAY the most generous positive goodhumoured quarrelsome man in the universeMEDWAY whose sensibility of honour and jealous misconceptions expose him every hour to a hazard of his life If you have forgot my situation with this flaming hero the inclosures will revive the whole track of the story in your memory Had I not apprehended that he was to pass the summer in Oxfordshire I should by no means have accepted of an invitation even from Mr DE GREY nor indeed should I by right have left Italy till the secret cause of my going thither became Mrs MEDWAY and had retired with her husband from Prudence Green As the good of society is no way concerned in the communication of this my private bosom secret no man but Mr LASCELLES is trusted with it  As to AUGUSTA I am glad to find she is so well reconciled to our last conversation Your sister will certainly by her enchanting treatment make a thorough convert of her and at least keep her quiet without more interviews till I get the Marquis's answer Were it not therefore for MEDWAY's affair I should now go down to the Green in high spirits With regard to LUCIA I consider her so much the property of another that I could certainly meet her  unalarmed  were not that other under the same roof  The INCLOSURES Being letters received  formerly  from MEDWAY  LETTER  Dear CARLISLE  YOU know many of my secrets so now take the greatest I ever had I love your guardian's friend LUCIA DE GREY to this secret add one more  she loves  ME I have the  best of reasons  for saying so My fortune is good Pray help me in this affair with her father  Your's O MEDWAY  LETTER From Mr C  In answer  Dear MEDWAY  As the affection betwixt you and Miss DE GREY is you say  mutual  it shall never be interrupted but on the other hand  promoted  by  Your's C CARLISLE  LETTER  Dear Captain  I HAVE  more  and  more  cause to interpret LUCIA's conduct in my favour DE GREY I know leaves all these points to his daughter's prudence so that although my notion of such a transaction is to keep it  quite private 'till the day of marriage  even though that marriage should not take place for several years I desire  you  as a friend to consider LUCIA as the  contracted spouse  of  Your's O MEDWAY  The ANSWER  Dear MEDWAY  As you have doubtless the most solid foundations for speaking with such strength and certainty of the subject in question I take it for granted the lady's  heart  is wholly  set upon the match  I do not therefore see that your happiness depends upon secrecy However since you enjoin me to privacy I will humour your singularity so far as to obey you  Adieu  CLEMENT CARLISLE  LETTER XXVI Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  Prudence Green  HE comes he comesthis night he will be hereyes my dear LASCELLESCARLISLE will this  very  night be here but perhaps your brother his old friend may have already heard from him We all wish for him with the fondest impatience Even the impetuous MEDWAY acknowledges him to be a man of the finest honour in the world By the bye CAROLINE that MEDWAY is a strange being I know not what to make of himhe is always begging me to smile upon him and when I  do  smile he whispers in my  ear "hush hush my dear soul hush don't  speak  about ita smile is enough a smile is enough" He came to me yesterday evening in the garden and must needs change flowersI agreed to his humour and he cried out in a transport that almost frightened me "such a little transaction as this with those who act upon terms of honour binds the bargain as firmly as the bonds of Hymen" He may be a very gallant man my dear but he is the strangest creature I know for all that and though our acquaintance is of two years standing he is as much a riddle to me as ever The best part of him is that he is the friend of CARLISLE  I  am CARLISLE's FRIEND too but I still enjoin you not to hint this to any creature breathing A little before I first saw MEDWAY I really thought CARLISLE had an affection for me but  many things have concurred since to persuade me that I am not only indifferent but disagreeable to him His excursion to  Italy  above all other things confirms thisAh CAROLINE how can so gentle and susceptible a heart as his be insensible toBut I have done  Adieu  LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER XXVII Mr DE GREY to Captain CARLISLE  Prudence Green  WELCOME thrice welcome to your native shore welcome to those shades which are now blooming at your arrival I have this minute attended Lord and Lady BLESSINGBOURNE and their nephew the antic Sir ANDREW from their carriage MEDWAY also is with us and your old neighbours Mr and Mrs HEWSON with the studious Mr GABRIEL LUCIA says when  you  are come down we shall have quite a company of  contrasts  there may be for ought I know some truth in the  observation at least there is a pretty opposition in  some  of the characters I am sure Mr GABRIEL is no bad contrast to Mr HENRY Lord BLESSINGBOURNE and his Lady are not amiss in the same way LUCIA and Mrs HEWSON have a marking difference and I very well know  how  and  where  the distinction is to be made betwixt Mr MEDWAY and Captain CARLISLE I hope by the time this reaches you all impediments to your journey will be past and that I shall have it in my power personally to assure you with what unalterable truth I am  Your friend and servant R DE GREY  LETTER XXVIII Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr HEATHCOATE  OH joy joy give me joy without end my dear HEATHCOATE Such game such fun such a summer is before me that neither you or I can possibly want amusement Prudence Place is absolutely crammed with  the  entertainment which of all others you and I most adore even with the pleasures of  ridicule  There are no less than three originals in the house besides my uncle and aunt who even yet are not entirely out of date Here is a farmer who would be a  gentleman  his wife beautiful as Venus who would be a  lady  The farmer's brother who tho' neither fish flesh nor fowl designs to be a scholar and my dear aunt and uncle who are magnificent superb highbred  nothings at all  With such a groupe not forgetting that son of the seven Furies OLLY MEDWAY if I don't have some precious sport and send you from time to time some sheets full of  fun  why then I have lost my knack and nature tries to entertain me in vain this summer That's all I say on the subject  As to LUCIA DE GREY and her dad they are quite upon the grave order you know and a man may look at their tempers for twelve months together without finding a tittle that is ludicrous so that I fear we can scarce rank any of these amongst our sources no matter ridicule is pregnant in every mother's  child of the  others  and you may expect to have a dish of the dear dear ridiculous to  me  more palatable than ortolans at least every second postday But heightyteighty who have we here What figure comes prancing down yon avenue majestic as the oaks which shade and debonnair as the skies which encanopy it It gains upon me as I survey it from the window Those little animals called men when mounted upon the backs of those larger animals called horses are proper objects for the sportings of such spirits as our's my HEATHCOATE But in this  particular instance  in this most brilliant exception there is no hinge whereon to fasten a joke  this  object looks like a  man  even while he is bestriding a  beast  His hair is caught by the galehis proportions charm away the very genius of  burlesque  I have not a jest in my imagination to  throw at him No fun in  this  visitor neitherHe alightsZounds HEATHCOATE this fellow hath found out the art of displaying the graces in getting from his stirrup the very horse seems conscious of his burthen he gives a paw of reluctance at quitting him The family are all flocking about the strangerwhat princewhat deity is it who can thus attract universal attention and turn  my  descriptions out of their accustomed channel  I must lay down the pen to enquire  In Continuation  HEATHCOATE could you possibly believe itThe very image of one of my  oldest  acquaintances yea even of my schoolfellow who was a clever fellow when I was a dunce had quite left me yes HEATHCOATE such improvements are made in every part of  Captain Carlisle's ever  handsome person that I knew him not till another of his ornaments melting from his captivating voice brought him again into my memory One would think there could be no great matter of attraction for such a ludicrous being as I in seeing a young man pay compliments to a parcel of people who were  prepared  for such civility and yet by my soul I stood  gaping at this salutation as if I was as young a beginner as the HEWSONS I question whether the god of Breeding himself could have pulled off his hat with such an airthen his attention was so properly  distributed  Zounds HEATHCOATE his bows went through the very souls of the womenBut what have  I  to do with  such  a subjectCARLISLE is come to make us all look ugly in the eyes of the wenches and so there is an end of it  However for this disappointment  one  way I am resolved to have full measure of revenge  another  since a brighter sun appears and  I  can only be in shadow I am determined not to be disgraced without vengeance As I cannot  shine  I will  laugh  most inordinately and I here swear by the rubied lips of LUCIA DE GREY that I will enjoy every thing  that ridicule can fairly catch at throughout all the flowery regions of Prudence Place Neither man nor beast shall escape me if either leaneth yea but ever so little to the ludicrous This vow is sealed by the sanction of Jupiter I nod and knit my brows upon it  Your's ANDREW FLIGHT  LETTER XXIX Captain CARLISLE to GEORGE LASCELLES Esq  From Prudence Place  I AM arrived safe my dear friend but fresh embarrassments rise before me I was more affected at the sight of LUCIA DE GREY than I ought to be Amidst all the air of general gaiety the eyes of MEDWAY were intently fixed on me the whole evening Much of what is commonly called  fun  passed at the supper table at the expence of two or three foolish people who are out of their elementNeither MEDWAY nor LUCIA partook of this  The night however closed harmoniously and my return to  Prudence Place  was honoured by a general bumper of Burgundy But about ten minutes after the company separated for the night MEDWAY's valet tapped at my door and presented the inclosed billet  To Captain CARLISLE  I CAN'T sleep Dear CARLISLE without assuring you that I am now fully satisfied of your conduct I looked at you for more than two hours and I don't think you addressed to LUCIA  my  LUCIA any glances of  concupiscence  This is the greatest obligation in the whole world to  Your's O M  N B HushHush  If this prospect of being perpetually tormented by the vigilant jealousies of this hotheaded man continues and if I cannot so far master my own sensibilities on a certain occasion my stay in this quarter will certainly not be long It is living under a double imprisonment both of soul and body Nor till the Marchioness is gone can I with propriety repair again to your house The rule of my life hath ever been not to throw myself unnecessarily into the path of temptation It is to my  feelings  which are always poignantly wounded by the least shaft of  selfreproach  as well as to my sense of  religion  that I owe escape from many a mischief into which I otherwise might fall I pique myself a little upon the virtue of making a seasonable  retreat  My sensibility tells me  now  that I am  here  in danger I should be by no means in a road absolutely safe if I  were with  you  It will require some adroitness to disentangle myself If matters do not mend I must alter my present address although were my  heart  quite easy I could be well enough amused with this motley groupe at Prudence Place and enter into every inoffensive levity with the most serious spirit imaginable You see by the air of my letter that at present I can neither write or speak with certainty of  any thing  I can only say in general terms that the joys I anticipated like most things forestalled do not sparkle in the cup so briskly as I expected they are dashed by some bitter disappointments I have a passion fretting my heart which hath no lawful right to lie in my bosom I feel it to be the tyrannizing serpentI smart under the sharpness of its tooth and yet like the man in the fable I foster it Do you not think my LASCELLES  that LUCIA's passion for the boisterous  Medway  is a little inconsistent with that uncommon delicacy and  gentleness  which seem to mark her own mind But there is nothing so idle as an attempt to decypher the hieroglyphics of love Mr MEDWAY is the man of her choice Mr MEDWAY is therefore not to be questioned upon the subject of his  success  I am your's C CARLISLE  LETTER XXX GEORGE LASCELLES  Esq  to Captain CARLISLE  Previous to receiving the above  IT touches me very nearly to be so soon under a necessity of transmitting to you a letter from our fair lady which if I may judge from the air of anger with which it was given does not contain the sentiments of a quiet disposition Previous to your coming here the other night I saw through the little artifice of her  dressing at you  in full taste it brought to my mind that sweet line of the poet  Now aweful beauty puts on all her charms  Notwithstanding this you had fortitude of  resistance  superior even to her  beauty  How you are able to do these things is wonderful for my part I fairly confess if I knew any lady of any country half so lovely and half so longing I certainly should suffer any little  scruples  I might have to be soon overruled and were it in my power to make such a woman happy happy she should be As to the Marchioness she hath fire enough in her eyes even to talk down the continence of an anchorite Not that I blame your virtue or accuse your taste No my dear CARLISLE I admire both I look up to the one with envy to the other with despair But this is no time either for comment or compliment the Marchioness's letters to you ought instantly to be forwarded since from the peculiar  violence  of her temper a moment's delay might produce the most  disagreeable consequences My sister wishes every hour for the Marquis's letter although it is impossible he should get  your's  for some time The two ladies parted from each other yesterday in tears I am not yet master of the meaning CAROLINE's confidence is impregnable unless she thinks it  right  to disclose any matter her dearest friends would not be let into the secret  Farewell GEORGE LASCELLES  LETTER XXXI The Marchioness to Captain CARLISLE  HAVE I not sufficient cause to curse my fate that hath left me without one solid reason to sanctify my affection Have I not reason too to curse that barbarous father who sacrificed me to the most hateful man upon earthwho sold me for a title which I despise and to embraces which are bitter to me as the bonds of death The great the counterbalancing arguments Mr CARLISLE are all on your side and therefore my pleadings are all against the tide But I see all that is to happen you will never see me moreyou refuse me your directionyou will have your  London apartmentsyour friends will grow weary of me and I shall be in utter despair Ah what a foundation have I for such suspicions How cuttingly cold was the air with which you last addressed me How cautiously cruel your civilityYou took my hand but it trembled as if at the touch of infection while mine on the contrary throbbed with a violence that denoted the agitations of my heart Your whole discourse was  general  or if it ever became  particular  it turned upon my husbandthe most detested of all subjects But this was not enough you dare not trust yourself with me alone I am reduced to such infamy that it was necessary to converse with me in the presence of a third person that third person too must needs be a  woman  But you were deceived I did not in that complotted interview shew  myself so abandoned as you expected I was conscious of the deepness of the triumph and I fell before it My situation is not even yet perhaps quite erased from your memory You recollect some part of my confusion I conjure you however Mr CARLISLE by love and I charge you by what is due to distress not to insult her whom you cannot redress Pity is at least my due and when you are not disposed to bestow that for honour's sake do not substiture contempt Pray what is to become of the unfortunate  AUGUSTA N***  LETTER XXXII Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  OH my beloved CAROLINE Mr CARLISLE is at our house and yet I am more wretched than I was before his arrival He certainly detests me He speaks in form and though he can never lose his politeness which is a part of his very nature yet he has wholly lost his friendship How can I possibly have forfeited this We were bred up together you know CAROLINE always in the same house for some time in the same cradle it is to CARLISLE I owe my early relish for reading and every better ornament Nothing could possibly be more cordial or more familiar  than we were formerly Wherefore hath he robbed me of his attentionof his  brotherly  attentionBut I suppose he hath been fortunate in his  Italian attachments  the friendships of a warmer clime are doubtless more attracting and more animated I know not what to think Certainly Mr CARLISLE never gave me reason to imagine I was more in his esteem  thanthanthan  But why do I talk CAROLINE he absolutely does every thing but flatly shun me  To increase my vexation that tiresome wretch MEDWAY becomes more strange than ever Half an hour ago he put into my hand the nonsense I inclose  To the fairest and faithfullest  If it was necessary for people of honour to make speeches I could make many about your good sense cBut enough upon that subjectLet not the telltale gossips of the air talk of my whereabout silence has the most meaning I hate noise I write this to tell you that I had no objection to your laughing last night at the HEWSONS though had any  man  breathing laughed half so much at me I would have sent him upon a message to the moonbut no matterhushit is to my content that you should be as pleasant as you pleaseBurn thiswalls have ears worms have eyesYou understand me  O M  Surely the man is a fool but I am in no humour to comment on his absurdityFor Heaven's sake write CAROLINE to  Your very unhappy LUCIA DE GREY  LETTER XXXIII Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr HEATHCOATE  HA Ha Ha HaOh laugh thou divine cure for every care thou celestial convulsion let me enjoy thee and let me at the same time shew my generosity by sharing thee with my friend  I have laid a plot my friend  such  a plot as will ensure thy felicity for a month you are to have two new correspondents such as before never honoured thee and I beg thou will pay proper respect and make thy responses in due and decent form Not a word  more till thou hearest farther of this matter from another quarter In the mean time let me end as I began with one of those everdelicious  bursts of the soul  which mark the constitution of  Your ANDREW FLIGHT  LETTER XXXIV Mr GABRIEL HEWSON to Mr HEATHCOATE  SIR  I HAVE just been informed that you take a liberal delight and a generous joy in being a witness to the progress of any gentleman's instruction and the worthy Sir ANDREW with  affability ineffable  and  complaisance corresponding  has assured me that you are of opinion the talents will receive a  quicker  polish from  letterwriting  or the  art epistolary  than even by reading or conversing he adds that although my improvements have been considerable they would make double impression by  being communicated in writing to an ingenious  absent  person Now Sir it happens that I am thought to be the most enlightened man of my acquaintance which I should account unlucky was I not comforted by the idea given me by Sir ANDREW of finding in you Sir a person who will kindly receive my sentiments upon breeding as I am enabled to pick them up from time to time I shall enjoy by these means a double honour and advantage and I wait only for your kind permission to commence  I am Sir most profoundly Your obedient GABRIEL HEWSON  P S  My brother is setting pen to paper or at least  designs  so to do soon for a similar honour  LETTER XXXV Mr HENRY HEWSON to Lord BLESSINGBOURNE  My very good Lord  I HAVE a mind to try my hand at a '  pistle  nearer  home  before I venture abroad just as your Lordship may have seen a parcel of young birds fly a few yards back wards and forwards upon the neighbouring hedges before they are so bold as to lose sight of their nest This I find by your nephew is a  simularius  so that you see I have got something already But the meaning of my writing to your Lordship is as I  ha  ' got a corr  s  en  that I may  get one for my HETTY who is so much improved since she came to  Prudunce Pleace  that she'd be hang'd as soon as write to any thing under a gentlewoman of the  bettermost specie  Now I think your Lady is of this genii so I write unknown to HETT that I may get your leave for  she  to write to  she  whereof the honour would be clear as the noontide Pray put your reply to this privately into my hand when we next walk for sake of the genteel thing up and down the garden Mean time know me to be what I  am  Your's H HEWSON  LETTER XXXVI Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr HEATHCOATE  BETTER and better still the gudgeons bite this warm weather at Prudence Place most gloriously Every minute teems with ridicule I have played off that  heaviest of the Hewson lump  Mr  Henry  upon my  uncle  yea even upon the pompous muscles of Lord BLESSINGBOURNE to whom the farmer hath written in form just to  get into's fist  as he elegantly phrases it I spirited him up to this and so contrived it that the letter should be given to his Lordship exactly at the proper crisis even while he was at a magnificent têteàtête  with my Lady upon that constant subject of theirs the dignity of rank and family I took care also to enter his room by the way of morning  devoir  just as the epistle was deliveredNo coronet at the top of the sealand yet the scrawling and  genteel upanddown of the superscription  is politely illegible enough to come from  somebody  of  rank  says the Earl Dost thou know the hand my LadyNo indeed my Lord It is not in my list of handsIf it approaches towards  any  of my correspondents continues my lady it is the Countess of Cannotspell In my opinion my Lady said I it bears strong marks of the Duchess of Letterblot that copious command of capitals in the LORD looks astonishingly like the finger and thumb of her GraceWhew says my uncle there's no postmarks I can't possibly account for this my Lady Ten  to one uncle replied I the contents will unravel the mystery in a moment that is to say if the writing is not  too fashionable  His Lordship broke the seal which Mr HENRY told me he once valued much it being the exact effigy of the finest greyhound bitch that ever  nabbled the scut of a bare  None of  my  friends fasten letters nephew with the engraving of a  dog    Heaven and familyhonours exclaims my nevertobeforgotten uncle what have we here with  my very good Lord  at the top and  your H Hewson  at the bottom H HEWSON Pray who is this familiar Mr H HEWSON I suffer no freedoms from such pens as these  No indeed don't you said my Lady  Suffer  me  to read it to you my Lord said I I can't possibly conceive the meaning of it  I read it HEATHCOATE and gave it all its graces It was not without great difficulty the angry Earl  sat it out  His comments were exquisite I inclose the original on purpose that you may compare a few of thema  simularius  cried his Lordship what does the fellow mean by that  Prudunce Pleace  and pray how could Mr DE GREY at his grave time of life admit such a creature as this to  Prudunce Pleace Prudunce Pleace  rejoined my Lady oh the illiterateha ha ha  I went on but was soon stopped again A woman of  the bettermost specie  a  lady of this genii  and  for she to write to she  did you ever hear such impudence said I my Lord  Impudence replied my Lady Pray nephew order my coach this very day Does  Mr  DE GREY who though a very worthy man is only a  Mr  imagine we are to be insulted by  rifraff  whom he thinks fit to make our  equals  They may perhaps be equals for a  Mr  but they are no proper company for persons whose names move upon a  different construction  That's very true aunt said I and it's perfectly unpardonable in that little lowminded monosyllable  Mr  to behave thus rudely to names of a nobler sound and a different construction  Mr  indeed I should not have thought of it  Don't be witty ANDREW neither says my aunt  Madam your Ladyship does me wrong said I I despise  Mr  as cordially as your Ladyship and I even bought  Sir Andrew  that I might never have any thing more to do with him  Mr  quotha  Be that as it may nephew rejoined my Lord rising upon his toes and swelling out his breast as is usual with him when he feels the  might  of any sentiment be that I say as it may You very well know the  stock  from whence our family sprung You very very well know that we have not a plebeian particle about us and though it is very true you bought  Sir Andrew  with my money on account of my abhorrence of  Mr  yet you have the best  of blood in your veinsYes nephew I will take upon me to say with very little exaltation of voice you have the best blood Heaven and familyhonours here's usage indeed  Thank Heaven and my nobleblooded ancestors my Lord nobody better said I  The veins of your aunt are not less dignified  Sensible of that my Lord said I her Ladyship's fine blood shines beside her fair complexion like the violet that groweth among the lillies of the valley  Not amiss said my uncle simpering  '  Pshaw  you madcap cried my aunt patting my shoulder and looking at  the back of her hand after gently rubbing it  Hang it rejoined my uncle forgetting for a moment his dignity this poor H HEWSON means no harm after all he is a poor simple thing  An unfortunate fish out of water you may see by all his actions said I and I dare say thinks he has lived upon shore long enough since he has had the honour to write a letter to Lord and Lady BLESSINGBOURNE  Do you think so nephew cried my uncle and aunt tickled by the flattery well then let us not be offended let the affair drop  I do really think my Lord rejoined I if you were to write him an  answer  you would make the poor fellow feel as if he were in Heaven  Answer him said my Lord what can I say to such a being  Say something however said my Lady to the poor devil  My uncle ordered the writing apparatus and after as much writing as might have been necessary to lay the plot of a comedy he wrote upon a large gilt card in a hand very little better than HEWSON's the following sentiments  To H HEWSON  THE Earl and Countess of BLESSINGBOURNE received H HEWSON's letter containing a simularius and several other curiosities worthy the pen of such a genii as H HEWSON As H HEWSON'S HETT is it seems a person of the  bettermost specie  the Earl and Countess have no objection to  she writing to she  as often as  she  chooses As Sir ANDREW FLIGHT who is it appears H HEWSON'S friend conveys this card there is no occasion to watch any  slyer  opportunity to get it to H HEWSON's hand The Earl and Countess have only to desire H HEWSON will not boast of this honour received from them and to address them in  public  as little as possible at least till he and his HETT are  bettermost perso  s  This card HEATHCOATE penn'd so exactly to my wish after being sealed with a flourish of the best wax and stamped with the broad BLESSINGBOURNE arms capped with a coronet and decorated with supporters was delivered to my care  I carried it to the farmergentleman whom I found disputing the point of politeness with that beautiful piece of ignorance his wifeShe was pleased to be hugely offended by the contents of his Lordship's card and declared that Mr HEWSON writ without her knowledgeAs to acquaintances she had plentythat she wrote every night to Miss DE GREY and chose to owe her improvements to her own ingenuity  Then it's not my fault cried the husband you will bear me witness Sir  ANDREW I have done  my  duty 'tis none of my seeking that she won't  horrespond  with a Ladyship and a Countess as for  my  part I am not above getting all I can out of high and low so I shall write just as I see  cassion  either to my Lord or Maister HEATHCOATE And now you talk  o'that  I must go  scheme  out a letter for the lastnamed  borrespondent  directly  Away he went and I enjoyed the society of his HETT all alone She is absolutely a more charming woman in my eyes HEATHCOATE even than LUCIA DE GREY nor does she want sense if she was not so consumedly addicted to admire every thing which you and I despise But her beautyher lipseyesneckchestwaistarm cheekbosomancle  I am your's ANDREW FLIGHT  LETTER XXXVII Captain CARLISLE to GEORGE LASCELLES Esq  I HAVE had a very foolish accident happen to aggravate the uneasiness of the Marchioness's last letter It is in itself a trifle yet the consequence to my  peace  will make it important to you Sir ANDREW FLIGHT was playing off his witticisms and waggeries upon the ignorance of some country simpletons that are now at the  Place  when I became so weary of his vociferous amusement for where is the pleasure of sporting with inexperience that I withdrew to Mr DE GREY'S garden unobserved or at least uninterrupted by the company MEDWAY  was watching his fishingrod Lord BLESSINGBOURNE was withdrawn to his chamber for his afternoon's nap Mr DE GREY'S garden is exceedingly large and part of it is disposed into a wilderness whose zigzag is so intricate that you may sometimes have your whole prospect terminated by a yard's distance The surrounding foliage too is of the thickest growth being suffered to expand for several years receiving from the gardener from time to time only such cares and loppings as to render the beautiful confusion more agreeable Seats and bowers apparently artificial with here and there a dripping grotto are distributed irregularly and the shades are every where so abundant that the sunbeams rather cheer you by  stealth  than by permission I have for my own part an attachmenta sort of sentimental friendship and goodwill for  every bench and for every tree they were all favourites of my infancy I sat upon the benches and I caught instruction from the lips of Mr DE GREY under the trees This therefore was the first time of my hailing them since my return Believe me I felt sensations that thrilled me as I revisited the places of my accustomed contemplation I bade them welcome with as much ardour as if they were animate I walked along the green meander recognizing my old acquaintances I listened to birds whose notes I affected to be  intimate  with my ear as if they issued from the same warblers I had heard formerly I complimented the cascades upon an  improved  melody in their cadence every breeze that played upon every leaf revived the balmy pleasures of infancy Even intercourse with other countries not odorous Italy herself had not been able to  supplant the  tenderness  I bore to the vernal beauties of Prudence Place  Ah LASCELLES what could be the reason of this Presently I came to an alcove which was originally the architecture of two children who grew up together It was a whole week's labour divided betwixt Miss DE GREY and your CARLISLE our little hands twisted the twigs formed the archings and subdued the obstinate shrubs with inconceivable industry Many a time we rested from the toil and as often being delighted with our progress we renewed it When it was compleated we gave oh I shall never forget ita kiss of tenderest congratulation as at having finished a work of  infinite importance  Big with this innocent flattery we ran hand in hand to our guardian and with elated hearts bade him survey well  our workmanship The gravity with which he commended and his affected astonishment at our  ingenuity  gave the last and fullest stroke of our pride and vanity Over the entrance our guardian caused to be imprinted upon a label in golden letters this soothing intelligence to the stranger  This Bower was raised by Clement and Lucia  The robinredbreast built in it the next the  very  next year and we had then you know the best reason in the world to think that Heaven itself was pleased with our amusement The nest you may be sure was preserved for both piety and pity were concerned in its protection We trod with caution while the  sacred  bird was hatching the whole feathered family presently took wing and I do verily believe I hear one of them now whistling near my window  Oh LASCELLES how soon is the heart that wishes to be inoffensive lulled by little circumstances Smile not then if I tell you that I saw with transport the names of LUCIA and CLEMENT still legible on their bowerthe branches of sweetbriar on either side were eagerly extending as if to embraceand I beheld the initials of my name very  recently  cut in the rind of a hawthorn that formed one of the supports of our alcove  What sweet circumstances how they melt the heart cried I  At that moment the softesttuned voice in the world repeated distinctly the following verses from her favourite poet  In these deep solitudes and aweful cells  Where heav'nly pensive Contemplation dwells  And evermusing Melancholy reigns  What means this tumult in a Vestal's veins  Why rove my thoughts beyon this last retreat  Why feels my heart it's longforgotten heat  Yet yet I  love  from ABELARD it came  And ELOISA yet must kiss the name  You are not to be told it was LUCIA DE GREY In the next instant she passed within sight of me the book still in her hand Unprepared on both sides for the surprize we were inexpressibly confused Beautiful lines Miss DE GREY said I Yes indeed replied she I think Miss DE GREY in a former part of our life we used frequently to read the charming Mr POPE  together  In this very garden Mr CARLISLE do you recollect your old bower said she If I mistake not Madam said IMadam CLEMENT Madam  Mr CARLISLE replied she as if a little offended I say continued I Miss DE GREY if I remember right  this  is that bower You had almost forgot it then Mr CARLISLE had you I suppose  Italy  the garden of the universe hath put all our  English  roses quite out of countenance Prudence Place is to be sure a mere nettlebedAh no Madam said I upon the edge of an explanation but happily checking myself in time though certainly Italy hath its charms Oh no doubt of it replied LUCIA but I believe Sir the company will have lost their chief felicity by your absence I hear Mr  Medway  coming I know his rapid random step and I dare say his errand is from the deserted society to the runaway Captain CARLISLE If you please Miss DE GREY we will retire then I will just finish my poem and follow you Sir  We parted 'Tis evident she loves MEDWAY to distraction LASCELLES She  knows his step  He was then in search of her  doubtless by her appointment  I wish them happyvery very happy But my head aches my heart is not quite well and I must wish you a good night  C CARLISLE  LETTER XXXVIII Mr MEDWAY to Mr TOWNSEND  CONFUSION TOWNSEND I have discovered the plotI have got a clue to the whole matter I am I perceive a very catspaw I am made the convenient cloak to conceal the passion of  another  Yes TOWNSEND I saw CARLISLE at the very farthest end of DE GREY's garden in earnest conversation with LUCIA at my approach he turned into a different walk and went into the house I overtook the guilty fair one and caught her in the very act of reading ELOISA to ABELARD which is as much as to say if I can't talk with him I can at least  write a letter  to him  and I dare say they do correspond every body in this family scribbles and I don't at all doubt but there is fine flourishing penwork going forward between LUCIA and CARLISLE As to the first I only walked quickly  by  her without deigning to  speak  and I pulled off my hat with unusual respect as much as to sayOh oh my young lady have I caught you I shall repeat the same behaviour when I meet her again and then it is impossible she should mistake my meaning With respect to the Captain whom I honour as a friend and gentleman in every  other  matter his life is not worth sixpence for he must as surely die this night as that he insulted me this day or else he must injure me still more by taking me off I only write this to you TOWNSEND just to account for any delay in my correspondence should it be  my  fate  instead of  his  In that case I desire you will be at the breaking open my will because you are mentioned therein by  Your old friend OLIVER MEDWAY  LETTER XXXIX From the Same to Captain CARLISLE  NOT a word more than is necessary shall be used I suppose you know the little green lane at the south side of DE GREY's paddockthe  farthest  end of it is out of the report of a pistol's getting to the ear of the family six yards the distancetwelve the hour LUCIA the wordyou understand me mumgood evening Hush  O MEDWAY  LETTER XL Captain CARLISLE in Answer  I SHALL certainly give you the meeting MEDWAY in the hope of convincing you that the chance of duelling might be poor satisfaction to a man who has as you have all the reason in the world to think himself most tenderly beloved by such a woman as Miss DE GREY However if you choose to hazard the continuance of this blessing which at present you so fully enjoy why take your own way and do not blame  Your obedient servant C CARLISLE  LETTER XLI Mr MEDWAY to Captain CARLISLE  MY dear Captain I would not now die for the world nor would I have  you  die it is plain then to  you  that I am  tenderly beloved  and since you are as well as I convinced I fully enjoy this blessing what in the devil's name should I run my neck into danger for So she  told  you as much How shy all the sex to the men they love when they have a mind to it But 'tis nature pray my dear boy go to bedsleep heartilydon't come near meI won't be metI shall go to bed  myselfI am a jealous foolwhew whewThere there the fit's over Good night  O MEDWAY  LETTER XLII Miss LASCELLES to Miss DE GREY  I SYMPATHIZE most tenderly with my dearest Miss DE GREY yet surely she makes to herself more misery than is necessary it is impossible for Captain CARLISLE to be so intimately acquainted with LUCIA's charms and virtues without admiring them and as to any  Italian  attachments I think I can take upon  me  to say he is bound by none of those Perhaps some  uneasiness  may look like  disrespect  in him at present Depend upon it all will in a little time be happy in which assurance  it is that I venture to say you are much happier than some women It is with pleasure I subscribe the name of  Your affectionate CAROLINE LASCELLES  LETTER XLIII Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr HEATHCOATE  TRIUMPH more triumph HEATHCOATE I have got a treasure In a close lane as I pursued my walk I found the paper which I inclose it is evidently the property of the pretty wouldbe bred Mrs HEWSON and is so much in the true taste of that burlesque we love although so seriously  intended  that I esteem it the most invaluable essay upon the  elements of high life  in the world Read and reinclose it for it will serve a purpose now forming in the bosom of  Your ever happy ANDREW FLIGHT  The inclosed  My NoteBook of Manners To be read by me every evening going to bed  HENRIETTA HEWSON  Memorandums and Notes c  Mem  Miss DE GREY always sips her wine softly  Note  It is unlike a lady to drink  heartily  as if one were adry  Mem  Miss D G inclines the head a little  tiny bit  on one side when she returns thanks 'Tis charming  Mem  Lady BLESSINGBOURNE half closes her eyelids and does not choose to  see too plainly  Strong eyes vulgar  Note  Very like a gentlewoman to be shortsighted  Mem  Miss D G never lets her hands  drop down  Note  It makes them red so to do Hands should not sink below the bottom of the waist  Mem  Miss D G speaks low and sweet  Note  Very rude for any thing  under a Countess  to talk at the top of the voice A Dutchess may use a great bad word  Mem  Lady B takes snuffMiss D G does not Countesses may snuff  Note  Horrid for any body  under a title  or under forty years of age to indulge in snuff but they may hold it up to the nose in order to shew a pretty hand and  affect  to take it  Mem  Miss D G steps modestly and with an easy motion Lady B wriggles and tottersLovely weaknesses  Note  Inconceivably polite to totter and wriggle I can hardly hold my pen Lord how I will totter how I will wriggle  Mem  Knife and fork sweetly held by Miss D G  Note    I  attend too much to the victuals and not enough to the manner of cutting and putting it into my mouth  Mem  Lady B passed yesterday by a tradesman of her's and did not see him  Note  Highly polite to  overlook an inferior  Mem  A young person saluted her Ladyship this morning with a curtesy down to the ground The  person  had formerly been waitingwoman to her Ladyship her Ladyship had not the  faintest recollection of ever having seen her before  The words  bless me who should that thing be  very proper on such occasions  Note  Exceedingly genteel not to  recollect obscure creatures  Mem  I actually heard the Countess hawk spit into her handkerchief and  then  look at it  Mis D G never gives more than a gentle  hem  and then half turns away her head so that when you again see her face you see it tinged with a blush  Note  Very fashionable for persons of quality to do that which would ill become Misses I believe I must never venture to spit but I do more than  hem  now  Mem  Lady B's countenance always encourages certain innuendoes wellbred indecencies  Note  Charmingly polite to be above  shyness  a great defect in Miss D G who is always serious holds down her head and  won't hear  on these occasions  Mem  The Countess frequently cants one leg over the other and sits in that posture

his title and dignification as Lord BLESSINGBOURNE says therefore I begin my  horrespondunce  with you at the instigation of Sir ANDREW with calling you Esquire which is certainly your due seeing you are out of trade and do  nothing at all for your livelyhood  I am to write what I get in the way of breedin it seems to you which is a thing pleasing seeing that you must without doubt be a master of the business  But I believe I shall have a wearisome spell o'work on't before I am as I should be case why there goes more to the making an honest man a gentleman than I had at first any  ideerer  of I ha' been  i'th'way on't  only three or four days and I can see already  t'an't  to be run up as a man would run up a rick of hay Ods woundlikins Esquire HEATHCOATE there is no end on't But howsomever to shew you that I am not quite a  numscull  I'll just mention a few matters that I ha' got in memory which is as thof one were to call it a storehouse to lay by things for future use In the first place you must understand that I see plain enough that the first rule of your  bettermost  person is to make a bit of a pleasant grin come into's  phisihog  whenever he first meets any one as much as to signify that he knows how to carry his head In the next  place I find 'tis proper to make up this bit of a grin at first sight whether you like the man or not Case why a gentleman should not shew that he is cuss'd angry  cept  upon  cassion  of interest seeing that  pliteness  knows how to smile i'th' face while it puts finger in pocket dly I ha' noticed that the less a man puts  bat  on's head the better Case why it's the sooner doff'd without pinching out the corners besides which its  plite  to carry powder and  pummadum  enough to keep the cranium comfortable without it I find a strange  difculty  Esquire in getting my foot into the right slide of  pliteness  for I perceives head and foot dive together  out  goes foot  down  goes head this is a cuss'd crankum piece of business Saving your presence I can't see the fun of bowing and scraping  too  nay ifack what do I talk of that some here at  Prudunce Pleace  must needs kiss their hands and then swing 'em out at the same time The young  Captain  does this aye Esquire young CARLISLE's hands head and heels all work at once as smooth and cutely as a bird i'th' air I'd give almost more than I'm worth if I could but wriggle out the hinder part o'me just like Lord BLESSINGBOURNE when  he  first comes into room I warrant me he does nothing but  treat  and  vance  shuffle and cut and go backwards and forwards sticking out his rump and  craning  his fine thin long meagre ninehaired head which I find is the  plitest  head a man can have Yet he knows who's to have a wriggle of the bum and who not too I warrant you he is a cute one he don't gig and drop his fine  plite  head to every body alike no believe me he has the measure of what's  every man's due from the Duke to the stableboy Down goes his genteel head quite on's breast to Captain CARLISLE but when I puts in for a bit of civility I can't get his neck to move downward half so civillyCase why I am but a poor fellow just come among  plite specie  But I don't allow myself any 'vantages for though I ha' put on the best suit to my back  t'an't  at all the thing Sir ANDREW says my wig is enough to ruin me for ever if there were nothing else in the way 'Tis as good a bob as ever was bought and sits as snugly to  feace  but alas what's a bob where you shan't see any thing under a bag and that  flourididdled  with ribbons and  tossicums  Young CARLISLE indeed lets  his  hair fly to and fro just as he and the wind can settle it Case why he has so much on't and 'tis so well coloured and twirls itself off into  such ringlets that  he  is  plite  any way I ha' bespoke a bag though I know  aforehand  'twill make a devil o'me and so I told GAB who is to ha' the fellow on't Comfort tho' that I can't look worse than GAB when I'm bag'd bag me when they will For at any rate I ha' gotten flesh on my feace and a little jot of colour i'my cheeks to set it off as well as a stout pair of shoulders whereas GAB has werretted all the flesh off's bones by larning Without a word of a joke Esquire I don't believe GAB has a pound of substance on's whole  carkiss  and as  to's jaws  has no more meat upon them than upon the bill of chicken his back is quite a  skelitum  and though his hair is no bad ravencolour yet it grows so cuss'd  odd on's head  and is so  lankum rateaten'um  as a body might  say if they were mind to talk larned that I would not gee frap of a finger  for's whole growth  But now I'm upon good breeding Esquire I desire to know whether a trick I saw Lord BLESSINGBOURNE who is ever  acold do  today 'fore men women and children is the  common practise  of your bettermost specie that is standing with bumfiddle to fire with coat up and now and then popping hand  below  waistband Mayhap my Lord mayn't be quite so  well  as he would be thereabouts just at present and it may be a comfort  to'un  to feel now and then how matters go for which reason I won't venture upon this action till I know whether 'tis a general thing or not Not that I dislike it but that just yet it seems aukward to such an ignorant  feller  as I  Nothing i'th'way of breeding more at presentBut I ha' filled my paper which I take to be always the  plite  thing So I rest at the bottom of the sheet  Your HENRY HEWSON  LETTER XLV Mr DE GREY to Mr CARLISLE  Prudence Place  MY best and dearest CARLISLE must pardon the formality of receiving an old friend's letter dated written and directed from the same house that contains both the writer and reader of it The reason is Prudence Place is at this time so crouded with different sorts of people and one has so little opportunity to steal leisure for conversation of the  higher kind  that I do not imagine a subject which is at this crisis so very warm at my heart can be so well or so explicitly handled as upon  paper So much for the apology I come now to the  matter  The days the months the years of  tuition  are now pastthose seasons my CLEMENT in which I had the honour and the happiness for it was both to point out to you the paths of propriety and of virtue are over for the  Pupil  is even already at the most early age of twentyone become the  Preceptor  he is the  Tutor of Truth  he hath already got orphans and widows under his guardianship the noblest of all guardianship my CLEMENTthe guardianship of  Sensibility  I  thank  you Sir for doing me so much honour When you left this country for ITALY I did not imagine there was room for improvements you were amiable polite and prudent as free from pedantry on the one hand as from dissipation and the distracted joys of an overgrown boy on the other Yet on  my first beholding you the other day I was struck with an  additional  finishing an elegant  compleatness  which though not before seeming to be wanted was as it  now  appears absolutely necessary Forgive the garrulous vanity of an old man Sir forgive me if I lodge with all the narrative tediousness of age a little longer on this part of the subject There are circumstances which  allow  us to swell out the heart without making it ridiculous You Sir occasion in me a pride of this nature Some men's ambition in the last state of life is gratified by walking or rather hobbling into their fields and gardens to recognize those flourishing shades which are the produce of their own cultivation I have heard a veteran neighbour of mine a thousand times exclaimSee Mr DE GREY how industrious I have been that long and  lusty range of oaks extending from this pasture even to the farthermost avenue in the next did I plant with my own handI remember the day when the whole row containing perhaps two hundred sticks of timber were so many petty acorns not so big as a walnut and see only see how they have sped I could raise a little navyverily neighbour I could fit out a fleet with a wood of my own raising  Such ideas I own are not displeasing CLEMENT but they are far from being expanded enough for  my  emulation my emulation chooses a nobler object and takes a wider course My object Sir is not circumscribed by any thing within the scope of  inanimate nature  and though I could be able to look out upon whole forests of my own cultivation it would not satisfy me  No Mr CARLISLE I have a far  finer  pleasure I have it to say that the politest gentleman and the best man of his age was once the child of my instruction He was left by that Heaven which took to itself his natural parents at an age when gentle treatment makes a parent of any one I received this dear and delicate trust from the trembling arm of a dying man and I value it as a legacy given me in the moment that the soul of a friend was departing Yes at such a tender period was you bequeathed to me Mr CARLISLE my child LUCIA was exactly of the same age and you grew together The beauty of your forms like the power of your minds was similar I can only say farther that nature points out to me none of her nice distinctions or partialities In the hour of your childhood I caressed you both with the same sensibility  and now that you are mature I divide my heart  evenly  between you But this touch of transport hath seduced me into a digression Old folks are I perceive on their favourite subject as tiresome in their writing as in their talking and therefore they have as few correspondents as hearers It is time however to return to my subject  On looking back at my accountbook my dear Mr CARLISLE I find that your birthday hath gone by almost a month You seem to have forgot that it entitles you to the command and sole disposition of an immense fortune Money was I am proud to say never a disputable point with us except when coercive measures were obliged to be taken in order to force upon you a remittance This however by no means exculpates me for detaining what ought  to be in more amiable as well as more able hands I reproach myself when I consider how many cruelties my delay may have been guilty of Mr CARLISLE to those whose fortunes  you  have in trust methinks I hear the curse of the widow the languishing sigh of sickness and the murmur of merit in the darksome vale I see too the tears stream from the eyes of the fatherlessOh for Heaven's sake my friend relieve merescue me instantly from continuing the injury to that part of your family which Providence hath put under your care  I shall most readily be prepared to render up an ample account of my agency whenever and the sooner the better you will honour me with your appointment  Thus much for  fortune  I had it in my mind CLEMENT to venture a few sentiments upon  happiness  which are by no means things incompatible although they are not often inseparable But any thing I could advance on this head is unnecessary to such a  mind  as your's With respect to your  heart  I own I meditated a few words upon  that  subject also but I am in great doubt whether this is the proper point of time to speak to it yet my propensity is so warm and the prattling or rather at present scribbling old man is so strong or to speak more truly so  feeble  in me that I can scarce resist  The interest of your heart must naturally my dear CLEMENT be of more concern to me than any other that belongs to you You are exactly at the age when tenderness falls with the  fullest force upon our nature as you have a form to command love so have you feeling to return it That sensibility which makes you a parent to the poor and those accomplishments which endear you to society in general will assist and even lead to connexions of a softer kind I am afraid it would border a little upon that impertinence which I would avoid else I should ask you in the cordiality of my good wishes whether it is  possible  for so amiable a man to have passed through  Italy  and to have resided in the capital of England the very court of female beauty with an inclination unattached and passions unalarmed This is too great a paradox for me to credit even in imagination and yet I am  mightily interested  in the question and its answer Perhaps you will humour an old friend's  caprices  and for once trust  him who can be no rival with a lovesecret Suppose you were to steal an hour from the strange mixture of our present family and scribble a line or two on this matter I dispatch this by your trusty greyheaded GEOFFREY who you know may be the confident of every message that can come from such a master  I am My dear Mr CARLISLE Your most perfect friend And most obedient servant ROBERT DE GREY  P S  The HEWSONS are just what you call them honest imprudent people  who have had the great misfortune to come in for ten thousand pounds a piece at a very unlucky crisis I had the management of their affairs when their whole expectations were bounded by a small annuity and they still call me Guardian I wish I had influence enough over  se random wards to persuade each o  them to remain quiet and be happy in despite of this unseasonable win  l They are here upon a  polite  scheme I heartily wish they would go home upon a  prudent  one This may be the case by and by  LETTER XLVI The Marchioness of N to Captain CARLISLE  Cruel CARLISLE  YOU confess then that you have written to the detested Marquis you even avow the sentiments of your letter to him you own that they are to  hasten him to England  But do you think Sir I am to be thus treated like a child and threatened with being chid by that bugbear  my husband  or do you imagine I will ever allow myself to be reunited to him Preposterous expectation No Mr CARLISLE tho' I am a slave to my own passions I will  never more be a slave to those of another You argue in vain about rights and laws and dutiesin vain you urge the maxims of the world and the custom of nations I have lived so long under the Italian heavens that I have forgotutterly forgotthe colder atmophere of cloudy England I have learned to follow my feelings and to abhor chains that were forced upon me by paternal authority You direct me to the sacred circle of gold upon my fingers you call it the caestus of fidelity I grew enraged to consider a man scarce more than twenty thus coldly argue upon a tender offer of no contemptible passion My  pride  took the alarm and I tore your epistle and threw the ring from my finger at the same time I stampt upon it with indignation Miss LASCELLES appeared and as if you had preinstructed her she acted upon  the occasion as the very priestess of piety "Fie my dear Marchioness said she folding her palms together in the true conventicle manner these outrages are ever dreadful but when they arise from so bad a  cause  what strength of terms can sufficiently reprobate them Consider the reserve and decorum of your sexconsider the consequences consider your character"  Ah frigid insolent is this the mode of British hospitality Do you  lesson  those whom you protect and do you nevertheless boast of your island as an asylum for the wretched and for the stranger Where are your sanctuaries for an unhappy womanwhere is your courtesy for tenderness and the wounded heart in despair But you northern Islanders grow upon too frozen  a soil to feel the power of sentiment which glows nearer to the sun  The subject must be hateful to you and I will quit it but still Mr CARLISLE something is due to my  pride  whatever is denied to my  passion  I will not stay here to  the triumph of those who have cha  ty because they have not hearts Miss LASCELLES hath of late assumed a language of lofty advice to which I am not accustomed She pities meshe is sorryshe wishes me wellshe will do every thing warranted  by discretion  she wishes Captain CARLISLE and I had met sooner The affair is delicateshe hopes that prudence will prevail  Ah CARLISLE that my extravagance of affection should have reduced  me to this Oh that I could change Oh that I could reverse the passionI would sacrifice fifty years of my life to hate you  Ah what have I said To what violation of the truth hath my passion led me No my CARLISLE no I would not wish to hate youwretched as I am I would not even wish to love you less Though the agony is extreme there are moments of transport known only to bosoms like mine that repay me for it Hate youO heavens what a word what an idea to mix with that which dresses up the irresistible CARLISLE Pardon the blottings which are staining this part of my paper They are made by tears that shew at least some tincture of virtue In other circumstances you say it would  have been your pride to have courted the softness which is now so pressingly offered How then is it possible  my  eyes should be dry when I perceive those circumstances so unlikely ever to happen Yet I cannot lose the ideaI cannot disengage myself from the delusion though I know it to be no more Persist then in your virtue Sir but deny me not the little gale of pleasure that blows from fancy Continue to let me hopecontinue to correspond only condescend to allow me the flattery of thinking I am not hated by the loveliest of men and I will sustain any thing for his sake I will remain quiet where I am and sit composed under the frown of  virtue without temptation  I will bear the thought of even seeing again the Marquis I will do any thing you would have me if you will still  continue to say you do not utterly execrate me for a guilt occasioned by tenderness  The most unfortunate Marchioness of N  LETTER XLVII Captain CARLISLE to Mr LASCELLES  MY dilemma is even greater than before The inclosed from Mr DE GREY is even more perplexing than that which you transmitted from the Marchioness Both perplex my imagination in what manner to answer them Mr DE GREY'S reason for inquiring into the state of my affections is evidently for fear my return to Prudence Place now that his daughter is in the full bloom of her sense and beauty there should inspire me with a passion that he knows would terminate in despair apprised too as he is of her engagement to Mr MEDWAY  It is very natural for him to imagine I should fall into this charming temptation so that this is a little generous stratagem under the guise of ordinary curiosity to prevent the mortification and the misery in time Mr MEDWAY is so singular a man that if he did not constantly assure me almost every time he sees me that his passion runs before the wind I should scarce credit that a person whom I hardly ever saw speak to Miss DE GREY should have made such a progress in her affections It is plain however now from her  own  conduct that she is fervently attached for her address air manner and whole deportment to me are utterly changed I am no longer delighted by that lovely affability which though playful was ever corrected by modesty She no longer consults my taste which she was wont to flatter about her  dress her ornaments and ten thousand innocent trifles that nevertheless trifles as they are make up the chief endearment of domestic society She speaks in form her eye is averted her sentiments sound  studied  We are no longer like CLEMENT and LUCIA who employed their infant cares in rearing the  same bower  Mr DE GREY'S letter therefore joined to Mr MEDWAY'S assurances and Miss DE GREY'S behaviour point out to me pretty plainly what kind of an answer it is proper for me to make to the former I am somewhat consoled to reflect that even in my most familiar moments I never entered flatly into overtures with LUCIA so that I cannot create any uneasiness in her bosom upon my account for had that been the case her sensibility is so uncommon LASCELLES she would have felt for  my  disappointment amidst  all the gaity of her own successes Since  her  heart is happily engaged if she  thinks  it so it certainly  is  so it now becomes a duty more than ever in me to  conceal  the feelings of  mine  Whatever be the violence of my passion it has no right to be troublesome to any other bosom and I was never able to account for that cowardly conduct which induces us to embitter the joy of a rival and a mistress because they were more fortunate or happy than ourselves Beside that such complaints never awaken more than compassion which is not desirable they aggravate disappointment till it rushes upon disgrace But methinks I hear you retort upon me "Why trouble  me  with your misery then CLEMENT" Ah LASCELLES we are not such abstracted beings as to lock up our sentiments either of joy or sorrow in absolute solitude The very thoughts would stagnate  by such means On some generous breast every man must by the very gravitation of his nature lean for support in  misery Every man culls from  species his congenial counterp  and it is as necessary to have a  our confidence as a mistress  tenderness Away with those  minds which feel an avarice  their noblest feelings Plurali  of friendships may perhaps like plu  a  ity of lovers be  admissible but surely it is very possiole to be fond of one mistress and faithful to one friend at the same time Oh Mr LASCELLES what hourly occasion is there for one or other of these blessings As joys and sorrows alternately prevail how soothing is the congratulating hand and chearful voice to the one and the gentle tear or sympathizing sigh to the other Ah enchanting  communication without which even transport must lie languishing at the heart and in  misfortune  the wretch who is separated from his species and sits loose to the kindness of an individual shall like a wounded deer lament his disaster without pity and die forlorn  With respect to the Marchioness I am every way so circumstanced that I am puzzled even to reply to her It would be too much like affectation and a kind of male prudery in me to say that if matters were in another channel I should not be flattered by this overbearing tide of tenderness in so beautiful an object Heaven knows I am not  insensible  to the charms of beauty Something that at this moment presses hard upon my heart convinces me I am not But situated as I am how is it possible to receive such a letter as her last without  distress Believe me LASCELLES I feel no elation at the compliment of so distinguished a preference although I acknowledge the Marchioness to be as you say with your favourite Yorick "amongst the first order of fine forms" I acknowledge too her command over the passions her fire her eloquence the delicacy of her shape the dignity of her deportment yet I feel nothing but anxiety at her present conduct The reason you will say is my secret attachment to  another  Be it so Yet were even that barrier removed I should I am positive still be unhappy and not flattered by the attentions of the charming Marchioness You are an animated man and no doubt call me a coldblooded creature By no means My passions are as lively as they generally are in  any  bosom at my age but perhaps my  taste of voluptuousness  differs a  little from the general juvenile idea I have a great pleasure in pleasing  my own mind  nay I have a great  interest  in so doing whenever I have done wrong I have always found that the pain resulting from it is too heavy to be counterbalanced by the pleasure which produced it I have my wayward propensities as well as another a whim hath often seized me by the heart and I have at all events indulged it For  the time  it was extasy and for ought I can tell the extasy was heightened by a sense of the  venture  at which the deed was done Presently and indeed close upon the heel of it comes the  per contra  of the action if you will suffer me to borrow a term from trade My frolic being over memory is commanded by a power we cannot resist to  retrace  it and if in going through the mazes of the past I met any thing  wrong or uneven against the cause of that integrity which I profess to love the thorns are from that moment in my bosom and for so much mirth I am rewarded sevenfold in misery I am so constructed that I can no more stand against the rebuff of a blush on my own cheek than against the thunder of a cannon the sigh which my weakness may at any time have extorted from another bosom agonizes my own and a tear which I once very undesignedly drew from an innocent creature haunts me from place to place and the precious drop for it was wrung from the eyes of  Lucia  is still trembling in my imagination  I have enlarged upon this subject because my behaviour might want to your fancy an apology That people do not all act on the same principle is  because they do not all analyze the real cause of that anguish which so often treads upon pleasure There is methinks one simple law that comprizes all the wisdom of the prophets and all the sagacity of philosophers I feel it better than I can describe it but to give you some idea of it I shall just lay it down as a note that whenever a man is upon the edge of an enjoyment let it relate to whatever part of indulgence it may he has only to consider whether it will not sooner or latter be returned by  more  than an equal misery if however even the prospect of  greater pain  does not deter let him hazard the joy then while the  actual agony  is full upon him let him again compare the  actual pleasure  after this his heart must be very perverse and his head very much intoxicated if for the future his pleasures are not such as will not  burt  him after they are over Innocent pleasures are indeed  never  over they spring directly from the soul and like that they are immortal Like mercy too they are "twice blest" they delight us while they are acting and conscience makes them sacred in reflection  It is upon this principle I am proceeding with regard to AUGUSTA She is the wife of a man to whom I had the honour to tender what he reckoned an obligation This makes his property more especially sacred to me She is also the wife of a man whom notwithstanding the roughness of his manners I believe to be valuable She is  in trust  In short she is every thing that she should  not be  to make a mistress of and as I told you before my  taste of voluptuousness  must have the present  circumstances wholly inverted that is to sayshe must be unmarried and  averse  to marriage unconnected and unclaimed in the way of connexion and I unattached toobefore I could congratulate myself upon the conquest of this flower of Italy  Yet till the Marquis comes for Heaven's sake use every method to soothe and quiet her do not advise your sister to oppose her in the heat of her sentiments She is too furious for admonition Her imagination is too much in its hey dey Her passions will die of themselves and she will consolidate perhaps after all into a regular character Her situation with you is so very delicate that I know your sister is in a dilemma but still AUGUSTA has many virtues I have seen a thousand instances of her benevolence  the Italian peasants bless her door and kiss the very threshold of it because imprinted by her footsteps She is at this time under the influence of  Fancy  it is a sort of feverish fit that attacks smartly at first and will away again The handsome creature is but just touching nineteen She is a child my dear LASCELLES and this truant disposition is a trick of the leading string without parents and of a vigorous imagination she is yet as to human life in the nursery No more my friend think not of her as of one abandoned that is not the case As to her glowing language let not that displease your sister though unaccustomed to her ear The Italian women know nothing of that reserve and pathetic bashfulness which guards the expressions of the British fair They speak freely and flowinglythe Marchioness adds to the  custom even the ardours of  constitution  But indeed she is not a base characterOnce it is said the Marquis in his violence struck her Her pride was hurt She thought it beneath the dignity of the man who had figured at the front of an armyshe never forgave it'twas wrong But who hath not a fault to be forgiven Farewell I have written myself into some composure and that will plead my excuse for having so long intruded  I am your's C CARLISLE  LETTER XLVIII Miss DE GREY to Miss LASCELLES  SURELY every day is commissioned to present some new mystery and no hour decreed to unfold or explain it My father whispered as I sat at dinner yesterday that he had a little private conversation for me and would contrive an opportunity very soon to chat with me You know his method of treating his children CAROLINE Towards the close of the evening when Lord and Lady BLESSINGBOURNE were airing Mrs HEWSON at her lookingglass where she is practising breeding Mr MEDWAY at the  river with his fishingrod and Mr CARLISLE at his writingdesk we found the leisure we wanted and walked into the garden together We will settle a little while in this very bower my dear says my father 'tis as pretty and cooling as any in the garden  Oh CAROLINE it was the bower of CLEMENT and LUCIA  Yes Sir replied I it is very pretty and cooling indeed  I suppose LUCIA your fellowlabourer who helped to make it has not paid it a visit since his return Such humble shades must yield to the spices of Italy He has to be sure forgot an arbour of mere English hawthorns and woodbines  I I believe he has Sir  Apropos LUCIA do you hold in the same mind still Do you still think him the  incomparable  CARLISLE Prudence Place can boast just at present  several  brilliant men We have the laughterloving Sir ANDREW of a very agreeable person We have the manly Mr MEDWAY odd but amiable Putting these both against Mr CARLISLE is he still the  superlative  degree There are two to one LUCIA What say you  I believe they have all their merit Sir  But is their merit perfectly equal in  your  opinion my dear  As to that Sir Ishould suppose no doubtthat isin short Sir as I have not known them all the same time  as one can judge more of intimates than casual acquaintances  You prefer CLEMENT I suppose  I have known him the longest Sir  MEDWAY my dear has great connexions  Sir  Sir ANDREW has good humour and will be heir to Lord BLESSINGBOURNE  Sir  But CARLISLE is the more accomplished gentleman  Most certainly he is Sir  beyond comparison  Do you think  beyond comparison  LUCIA  Sir  I say my dear LUCIA do you really thinkthatthat  Bless me Sir how faint the air gets when the breeze falls at this season of the year  Yonder comes GEOFFRY  From Mr CARLISLE perhaps upon private businessI will if you please withdraw Sir  If the heat is troublesome pray do my dear  Very troublesome indeed SirLord bless me there is not a breath of wind  As sure as can be there is a tempest in the skies  Thus ended our dialogueWhat does it mean CAROLINE I never was more confused in my life What could old GEOFFRY be coming for The old fellow who only wishes himself young again to dispatch with more haste the commands of his master quite ran on the occasion  On my return into the house I met Mr MEDWAY with an handkerchief full of fish and in the highest degree pleased with his success By way of courtesy  en passant  I told him he must certainly carry a  charm  about him to attract so many fish out of the water in so little a time Upon which he caught hold of my wrist and after looking round the  room to see if any body was present hushhushfor God's sake child walls have eyesand worms have ears as I always told you  From this and some other strange things I have seen in this man I am convinced his head is not exactly as it should be  Not a view of CARLISLE all this morning since breakfast No sollicitation to sing to touch the guittar to walk in the garden to count the fruit to read Pope tototo  It is very barbarous he should all at once take such a dislike to me  I wish Italy had been far enough before he had seen it Pray my dear  are the ladies so  very  beautiful in that country Towards  Rome  for instance I have been looking into my father's library for a sort of  history  and  manners  of that country Not indeed that I am concerned in the matter but yet if any thing of this kind happens to fall in your way you may purchase and send it me by the first conveyance  LUCIA DE GREY  P S  Lord B sets out this evening from our  Place  to his seat in Shropshire Sir  ANDREW continues with us on purpose to teaze the silly HEWSONS MEDWAY is to be mad with us all the season  LETTER XLIX Lord BLESSINGBOURNE to Mr DE GREY  Blessingbourne Abbey  Sir  WE got without mischance to the Abbey I beg to know whether you have considered the subject we discoursed upon Sir ANDREW is no mean match Mr DE GREY He will one day be Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE for which change of his name I have a peremptory command in my Will If you send me word  you  are satisfied as to the matter I will transmit directions for him to think more  particularly  of the young Lady whose good qualities  my Lady and I have determined within ourselves to be equivalent to want of title and that is certainly saying a great deal Sir ANDREW is worthy though he is too great a laugher and he will make a good husband Your offer of forty thousand pounds with Miss DE GREY is liberal half that with a coronet would be sufficient However if there are honours on one side it reflects dignity on both If she marries Sir ANDREW she stands a chance of being a Countess to which brilliant probability I will add the fellow sum to your's down two thousand pounds worth of diamonds a thousand pounds for a wedding dinner and the handsomest set of creamcolours with silver trappings and the BLESSINGBOURNE crest engraven thereon I have the honour  to enclose for you the salutations of the Countess and to be  Sir  Your most obedient Very humble Servant BLESSINGBOURNE  LETTER L Captain CARLISLE to R DE GREY Esq  My fatherly Guardian  TO shew my esteem for your  mode  of conveying your last sentiments I  adopt  it To imitate is to admire Many parts of your favour went quite home to the seat of the tenderest sensations particularly where you discover to me in a style peculiar to your pen that regard which has ever been the most distinguished honour and blessing of my life  All your questions have a claim upon my answer and upon my sincerity  You address me on a delicate subject I see plainly how much my happiness in every state of my life is at your heart Of the conjugal connexion I think with veneration and sensibility but I am exceedingly  young  and shall in all probability gain a little more domestic knowledge and of that prudence which belongs  to family  before I change my condition Whenever there is the smallest prospect of this happening it cannot be long a secret out of Mr DE GREY's bosom  I am ever his own CLEMENT CARLISLE  P S  I had almost forgotten to mention the moneyaffair It is not possible  for the poor to want a friend or an instructor while Mr DE GREY is at Prudence Place and if the charge of my fortune is not absolutely troublesome to him there is no bank wherein it can lie with so much satisfaction to me  LETTER LI Mr LASCELLES to Captain CARLISLE  HOW pitiable it is my dear CARLISLE that you should be so circumstanced as to find it utterly impossible to return the extatic fondness of this bewitching woman She is absolutely an angel Some new dresses have lately been put on and she sets them off with such an elegance such a taste such a  naiveté  it is impossible to look at her without an ejaculation of pleasure and admiration Allowing all your arguments their full force I must still confess there is a something cold and icy about  your  heart that cannot be  melted by such a blaze of beautyespecially as the lady is so perfectly  willing  and not at all unreasonably  nice  She loves your person well enough to take it on  your own terms  she does not pretend to capitulate the citadel is your own and you may do what  you will  with it Ohsaid she the other day while the tears were streaming from her lovely eyesoh that I could see him but  one  moment in  every  day I would be content with annihilation for the rest of the twentyfour hours By Heavens CARLISLE if any woman half so beautiful had avowed such a sentiment in  my  favour I would have shewn my gratitude for it at the price of my existencebut you on the contrary though as virtuous as a saint are as frigid as a Freezelander I question whether you ever approached the  lips of this lovely one since they first declared a passion for you It requires I confess all the elaborate excuses you have made to wipe off the imputation of an insensible and even after all your pains I freely tell you that I think you are too scrupulous upon this occasion I speak frankly out of pity to the Marchioness and for  your pleasure  Admitting your passion for Miss DE GREY to be ever so great what I wonder has  that  to do with a snug convenient beauty by way of  my friend in a corner  at another quarter of the world Your notions are absolutely antediluvian I do not know another man in the world who would not  leap  at your situation In the name of pleasure then make the best of it I thought at first as you do but I speak now upon mature deliberation There is no doubt but the Marchioness would change her name  live quietly in the place you provide for her be happy as if in Heaven to get a sight of you once a fortnight and there would be an end of the thing Do then let me advise you put a period to these complaints open the cage of the beautiful prisoner and set the pretty little heart that is now beating as it were at the wires till it pants again perfectly at ease It is with great difficulty I keep her from writing to you every day The idea of the Marquis sets her already raving but I cannot by any means draw from her nor can my sister any account of her family supposed to be in town She says they would force her again to the arms of the detested Marquis But I have proposed a proper salvo for all those sores and if you have the least lively spark of the young man or of merry human  nature in you you will not neglect it Compliments to our friend Sir ANDREW  Adieu G LASCELLES  LETTER LII Captain CARLISLE to G LASCELLES Esq  YOUR letter has not been an hour in my hand and although my heart was full of  other  matter I have now neither ear nor pen for any thing but an answer to it Do you know in the first place that I looked at your seal and at your superscription and at the very  cut of your letters  before I would credit the thing to be your's In this age of  forgery  I was in good hope somebody had made free with my friend But as it appears that the letter did absolutely proceed from  you I  must proceed to an explicit reply  Make a prostitute of the poor girl Mr LASCELLES Seek out a convenient apartment and compel the charming eyes which you say  now  weep with love grow wild with the sparklings of rage and despair What Sir would you wish me to seclude her from all valuable society and to sink her from a Marchioness of the first figure and fashion to a mere mistressfrom a young elegant woman to a scorned abandoned daughter of the brothel Is this the method in which you would have me return my compliment for a long a weary an hapless and an unfortunate journey of a thousand miles However misplaced the affection she is pleased to bestow upon me and however impossible it is for me to reward it I am still bound to her even for her very misfortune It is my  fate  and not  me  that declines what in some  cases might have been my greatest blessing Surely Mr LASCELLES I owe her gratitude of a very different complexion from that blushless one you recommend My heart bleeds for her From  me  she should claim an attentive anxiety how to  recompense  the throbbings in her bosom the most industrious care to reconcile her again to her husband to contrive means of healing up any breach which my unfortunate acquaintance with that gentleman may have occasioned These are the services she should expect from me and to offer these is at once my study and my effort But I will not believe you serious or if you are your compassion has hurried you into a precipitancy that only wants shewing you to be repented of  This my dear LASCELLES is assuredly the case Besides which depend upon it you have  mistaken  the Marchioness She could not stoop to the ignominious terms you have proposed to me for her If she  really  loves there must be some degree of refinement in the partiality and believe me LASCELLES many a woman has felt a secret predilection in favour of a man who would start with horror from an act of  predetermined  perfidy If it were not for the appearance of an implied compliment to  myself  I should not at all scruple to say I believe any partiality AUGUSTA may have unluckily conceived in my favour proceeds wholly from some imaginary  virtues  which she is pleased to think I possess I dare swear she is taken by certain qualities in your friend which as  she  has enriched and magnified  them appear to  her  deserving esteem Upon  this  principle you have indeed proposed an  effectual plan  for making her  detest  me To discolour the image she has flatteringly dressed up by placing in its stead a seducer and ingrate might perhaps prove a successful remedy but this my dear LASCELLES would be purchasing aversion more fatally than any thing that can reasonably arise out of the partiality itself No no my friend  Enough however has been urged you are convinced and therefore you are dear as you ever were to  CLEMENT CARLISLE  P S  Sir ANDREW returns your devoir He is as merry as ridicule can make  him his present objects now his uncle is gone are two foolish bumpkin brothers and a handsome simpleton of a wife to one of them  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
