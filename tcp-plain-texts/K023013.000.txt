 MR POPE'S LETTERS TO A LADY  Price Two Shillings  LETTERS OF THE LATE ALEXANDER POPE Esq TO A LADY  Never before published  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY in PallMall MDCCLXIX  ADVERTISEMENT  THESE Letters besides the  naiveté  of the style the quick sallies of an ingenious mind and the graver observations of reflection and judgment discover the Writer's Heart to have had a more amiable sensibility and to be tinctured with more goodness than his other Writings of this sort do  IT may be proper just to mention that the Originals of these Letters are in Mr Dodsley's Possession  MR POPE'S LETTERS  LETTER I  MADAM  Twitenham  Oct  WE are indebted to Heaven for all things and above all for our sense and genius in whatever  degree we have it but to fancy yourself indebted to any thing else moves my anger at your modesty The regard I must bear you seriously proceeds from myself alone and I will not suffer even one I like so much as Mrs H to have a share in causing it I challenge a kind of relation to you on the  soul's  side which I take to be better than either on a father's or mother's and if you can overlook an ugly  body  that stands much in the way of any friendship when it is between different sexes I shall hope to find you a true and constant kinswoman  in Apollo Not that I would place all my pretensions upon that poetical foot much less confine them to it I am far more desirous to be admitted as yours on the more meritorious title of friendship I have ever believed this as a sacred maxim that the most ingenious natures were the most sincere and the most knowing and sensible minds made the best friends Of all those that I have thought it the felicity of my life to know I have ever found the most distinguished in capacity the most distinguished in morality and those  the most to be depended on whom one esteemed so much as to desire they should be so I beg you to make me no more compliments I could make you a great many but I know you neithe  need them nor can like them be so good as to think I do not In one word your writings are very good and very entertaining but not so good nor so entertaining as your life and conversation One is but the effect and emanation of the other It will always be a greater pleasure to me to know you are well than that you write well though every time  you tell me the one I must know the other I am willing to spare your modesty and therefore as to your writing may perhaps never say more directly to yourself than the few verses I send here which as a proof of my own modesty too I made so long ago as the day you sate for your picture and yet never till now durst confess to you  Tho' sprightly Sappho force our love and praise  A softer wonder my pleas'd soul surveys  The mild Erinna blushing in her bays  So while the sun's broad beam yet strikes the sight  All mild appears the moon's more sober light  Serene in virgin majesty she shines  And unobserved the glaring sun declines  THE brightest wit in the world without the better qualities of the heart must meet with this fate and tends only to endear such a character as I take yours to be In the better discovery and fuller conviction of which I have a strong opinion I shall grow more and more happy the longer I live your acquaintance and if you will indulge me in so much pleasure  Your faithful friend and most obliged servant A POPE  LETTER II  MADAM  Twitenham  Nov  THOUGH I am extremely obliged by your agreeable letter I will avoid all mention of the pleasure you give me that we may have no more words about compliments which I have often observed people talk themselves into while  they endeavour to talk themselves out of It is no more the diet of friendship and esteem than a few thin wafers and marmalade were of so hearty a stomach as Sancho's In a word I am very proud of my new relation and like Parnassus much the better since I found I had so good a neightbour there Mrs H  who lives at court shall teach two countryfolks sincerity and when I am so happy as to meet you she shall settle the proportions of that regard or goodnature which she can allow you to spare me from a heart which is so much her own as yours is  THAT lady is the most trusty of friends if the imitation of Shakespear be yours for she made me give my opinion of it with assurance it was none of Mrs  I honestly liked and praised it whosesoever it was there is in it a sensible melancholy and too true a picture of human life so true an one that I can scarce wish the verses yours at the expence of your thinking that way so early I rather wish you may love the town which the author of those lines cannot  immoderately  do these many years  It is time enough to like or affect to like the country when one is out of love with all but one'sself and therefore studies to become agreeable or easy to one'sself Retiring into one'sself is generally the  pisaller  of mankind Would you have me describe my solitude and grotto to you what if after a long and painted description of them in verse which the writer I have just been speaking of could better make if I can guess by that line  No noise but water ever friend to thought  what if it ended thus  What are the falling rills the pendant shades  The morning bow'rs the evening colonnades  But soft recesses for th' uneasy mind  To sigh unheard in to the passing wind  Lo the struck deer in some sequester'd part  Lies down to die the arrow in his heart  There hid in shades and wasting day by day  Inly he bleeds and pants his soul away  If these lines want poetry they do not want sense God Almighty long preserve you from a feeling of them The book you mention Bruyere's Characters will make any one know the world and I believe at the same  time despise it which is a sign it will make one know it thoroughly It is certainly the proof of a masterhand that can give such striking likenesses in such slight sketches and in so few strokes on each subject In answer to your question about Shakespear the book is about a quarter printed and the number of emendations very great I have never indulged my own conjectures but kept meerly to such amendments as are authorized by old editions in the author's lifetime but I think it will be a year at least before the whole work can be finished  In reply to your very handsome I wish it were a very true compliment upon this head I only desire you to observe by what natural gentle degrees I have sunk to the humble thing I now am first from a pretending poet to a critick then to a low translator lastly to a meer publisher I am apprehensive I shall be nothing that's of any value long except  Madam  Your most obliged and most faithful humble servant A POPE  I long for your return to town a place I am unfit for but shall not be long out of as soon as I know I may be permitted to wait on you there  LETTER III  MADAM  Thursday night  IT was an agreeable surprize to me to hear of your settlement in town I lye at my Lord Peterborow's in Boltonstreet where any commands of yours will reach me tomorrow only on Saturdayevening I am preengaged If Mrs H  be to be engaged  and if she is by any creature it is by you I hope she will join us I am with great truth  Madam  Your most faithful friend and obliged servant A POPE  LETTER IV  MADAM  I COULD not play the impertinent so far as to write to you till I was encouraged to it by a piece of news Mrs H  tells me which ought to be the most agreeable in the world to any author That you are determined to write no moreIt is now the time then not for me only  but for every body to write without fear or wit and I shall give you the first example here But for this assurance it would be every way too dangerous to correspond with a lady whose very first sight and very first writings had such an effect upon a man used to what they call fine sights and what they call fine writings Yet he has been dull enough to sleep quietly after all he has seen and all he has read till yours broke in upon his stupidity and indolence and totally destroyed it But God be thanked you will write no more so I am in  no danger of increasing my admiration of you one way and as to the other you will never I have too much reason to fear open these eyes again with one glimpse of you  I AM told you named lately in a letter a place called Twitenham with particular distinction That you may not be misconstrued and have your meaning mistaken for the future I must acquaint you Madam that the name of the place where Mrs H  is is not Twitenham but Richmond which your ignorance in the  geography of these parts has made you confound together You will unthinkingly do honour to a paltry hermitage while you speak of Twitenham where lives a creature altogether unworthy your memory or notice because he really wishes he had never beheld you nor yours You have spoiled him for a solitaire and a book all the days of his life and put him into such a condition that he thinks of nothing and enquires of nothing but after a person who has nothing to say to him and has left him for ever without hope of  ever again regarding or pleasing or entertaining him much less of seeing him He has been so mad with the idea of her as to steal her picture and passes whole days in sitting before it talking to himself and as some people imagine making verses but it is no such matter for as long as he can get any of hers he can never turn his head to his own it is so much better entertained  LETTER V  MADAM  I AM touched with shame when I look on the date of your letter I have answered it a hundred times in my own mind which I assure you has few thoughts either so frequent or so lively as those relating to you I am sensibly obliged by you in the comfort you endeavour to give me  upon the loss of a friend It is like the shower we have had this morning that just makes the drooping trees hold up their heads but they remain checked and withered at the root the benediction is but a short relief though it comes from Heaven itself The loss of a friend is the loss of life after that is gone from us it is all but a gentler decay and wasting and lingering a little longer I was the other day forming a wish for a lady's happiness upon her birthday and thinking of the greatest climax of felicity I could raise step by step to  end in thisa Friend I fancy I have succeeded in the gradation and send you the whole copy to ask your opinion or which is much the better reason to desire you to alter it to your own wish for I believe you are a woman that can wish for yourself more reasonably than I can for you Mrs H  made me promise her a copy and to the end she may value it I beg it may be transcribed and sent her by you  To a Lady on her Birthday  Oh be thou blest with all that heaven can send  Long life long youth long pleasureand a friend  Not with those toys the womanworld admire  Riches that vex and vanities that tire  Let joy or ease let affluence or content  And the gay conscience of a life wellspent  Calm every thought inspirit every grace  Glow in thy heart and smile upon thy face  Let day improve on day and year on year  Without a pain a trouble or a fear  And ah since death must that dear frame destroy  Dye by some sudden extacy of joy  In some soft dream may thy mild soul remove  And be thy latest gasp a sigh of love  PRAY Madam let me see this mended in your copy to Mrs H  and let it be an exact scheme of happiness drawn and I hope enjoyed by yourself To whom I assure you I wish it all as much as you wish it her  I am always with true respect Madam Your most faithful friend and most humble servant A POPE  LETTER VI  MADAM  Twitenham  Aug  YOUR last letter tells me that if I do not write in less than a month you will fancy the length of yours frighted me A consciousness that I had upon me of omitting too long to answer it made me look not without some fear and trembling for  the date of it but there happened to be none and I hope either that you have forgot how long it is or at least that you cannot think it so long as I do since I writ to you Indeed a multitude of things which singly seem trifles and yet altogether make a vast deal of business and wholly take up that time which we ought to value above all such things have from day to day made me wanting as well to my own greatest pleasure in this as to my own greatest concerns in other points If I seem to neglect any friend I have I do more than seem to  neglect myself as I find daily by the increasing ill constitution of my body and mind I still resolve this course shall not nay I see it cannot be long and I determine to retreat within myself to the only business I was born for and which I am only good for if I am entitled to use that phrase for any thing It is great folly to sacrifice one's self one's time one's quiet the very life of life itself to forms complaisances and amusements which do not inwardly please me and only please a sort of people who regard me no farther than a  meer instrument of their present idleness or vanity To say truth the lives of those we call great and happy are divided between those two states and in each of them we poetical fidlers make but part of their pleasure or of their equipage And the misery is we in our turns are so vain at least I have been so as to chuse to pipe without being paid and so silly to be pleased with piping to those who understand musick less than ourselves They have put me of late upon a task before I was aware which I am  sick  and  sore  of and yet engaged  in honour to some persons whom I must neither disobey nor disappoint I mean two or three in the world only to go on with it They make me do as mean a thing as the greatest man of them could do seem to depend and to solicit when I do not want and make a kind of court to those above my rank just as they do to those above theirs when we might much more wisely and agreeably live of ourselves and to ourselves You will easily find I am talking of my translating the Odyssey by subscription which looks it must needs  look to all the world as a design of mine both upon fame and money when in truth I believe I shall get neither for one I go about without any stomach and the other I shall not go about at all  THIS freedom of opening my mind upon my own situation will be a proof of trust and of an opinion your goodness of nature has made me entertain that you never profess any degree of goodwill without being pretty warm in it So I tell you my grievances I hope in God you have  none wherewith to make me any return of this kind I hope that was the only one which you communicated in your last about Mrs H  silence for which she wanted not reproaches from me and has since she says amply atoned for I saw a few lines of yours to her which are more obliging to me than I could have imagined if you put  my welfare  into the small number of things which you heartily wish for a sensible person of either sex will never wish for many I ought to be a happier man than I ever yet deserved to be  UPON a review of your papers I have repented of some of the trivial alterations I had thought of which were very few I would rather keep them till I have the satisfaction to meet you in the winter which I must beg earnestly to do for hitherto methinks you are to me like a spirit of another world a being I admire but have no commerce with I cannot tell but I am writing to a Fairy who has left me some favours which I secretly enjoy and shall think it  unlucky if not fatal to part with So pray do not expect your verses till farther acquaintance  LETTER VII  MADAM  Twitenham  Sept  NO confidence is so great as that one receives from persons one knows  may be  believed and in things one is  willing  to believe I have at last acquired this by Mrs H  repeated assurances of a thing I am  unfeignedly so desirous of as your allowing me to correspond with you In good earnest there is sometimes in men as well as in women a great deal of unaffected modesty and I was sincere all along when I told her personally and told you by my silence that I feared only to seem impertinent while perhaps I seemed negligent to you To tell Mrs  any thing like what I really thought of her would have looked so like the common traffick of compliment that pays only to receive and to have told it her in distant or bashful terms  would have appeared so like coldness in my sense of good qualities which I cannot find out in any one without feeling from my nature at the same time a great warmth for them that I was quite at a loss what to write or in what stile to you But I am resolved plainly to get over all objections and faithfully to assure you if you will help a bashful man to be past all preliminaries and forms I am ready to treat with you for your friendship I know without more ado you have a valuable soul and wit sense and worth enough to make  me reckon it provided you will permit it one of the happinesses of my life to have been made acquainted with you  I DO not know on the other hand what you can think of me but this for a beginning I will venture to engage that whoever takes me for a poet or a wit as they call it takes me for a creature of less value than I am and that whereever I profess it you shall find me a much better man that is a much better friend or at least a much less faulty one than I  am a poet That whatever zeal I may have or whatever regard I may shew for things I truly am so pleased with as your entertaining writings yet I shall still have more for your person and for your health and for your happiness I would with as much readiness play the apothecary or the nurse to mend your headakes as I would play the critick to improve your verses I have seriously looked over and over those you intrusted me with and assure you Madam I would as soon cheat in any other trust as in this I sincerely tell you  I can mend them very little and only in trifles not worth writing about but will tell you every tittle when I have the happiness to see you  I AM more concerned than you can reasonably believe for the ill state of health you are at present under but I will appeal to time to shew you how sincerely I am if I live long enough to prove myself what I truly am  Madam  Your most faithful servant A POPE  I am very sick all the while I write this letter which I hope will be an excuse for its being so scribbled  LETTER VIII  MADAM  Twitenham  Nov  IT happened that when I determined to answer yours by the post that followed my receipt of it I was prevented from the first proof I have had the happiness to give you of my warmth and readiness in returning  the epitaph with my sincere condolements with you on that melancholy subject But nevertheless I resolved to send you the one though unattended by the other I begged Mrs H  to inclose it that you might at least see I had not the power to delay a moment the doing what you bid me especially when the occasion of obeying your commands was such as must affect every admirer and wellwisher of honour and virtue in the nation  YOU had it in the very blots the better to compare the places and I can only say it was done to the best of my judgement and to the extent of my sincerity  I DO not wonder that you decline the poetical amusement I proposed to you at this time I know from what little I know of your heart enough at least to convince me it must be too deeply concerned at the loss not only of so great and so near a relation but of a good man a loss  this age can hardly ever afford to bear and not often can sustain Yet perhaps it is one of the best things that can be said of poetry that it helps us to pass over the toils and troubles of this tiresome journey our life as horses are encouraged and spirited up the better to bear their labour by the jingling of bells about their heads Indeed as to myself I have been used to this odd cordial so long that it has no effect upon me but you Madam are in your honeymoon of poetry you have seen only the smiles and enjoyed the caresses  of Apollo Nothing is so pleasant to a Muse as the first children of the imagination but when once she comes to find it meer conjugal duty and the care of her numerous progeny daily grows upon her it is all a sour tax for past pleasure As the Psalmist says on another occasion the age of a Muse is scarce above five and twenty all the rest is labour and sorrow I find by experience that his own fiddle is no great pleasure to a common fidler after once the first good conceit of himself is lost  I LONG at last to be acquainted with you and Mrs H  tells me you shall soon be in town and I blest with the vision I have so long desired Pray believe I worship you as much and send my addresses to you as often as to any female Saint in Heaven it is certain I see you as little unless it be in my sleep and that way too holy hermits are visited by the Saints themselves  I AM without figures and metaphors yours and hope you will  think I have spent all my fiction in my poetry so that I have nothing but plain truth left for my prose with which I am ever  Madam  Your faithful humble servant  LETTER IX  MADAM  Five o'clock  I THINK it a full proof of that unlucky star which upon too many occasions I have experienced that this first this only day that I should  have owned happy beyond expectation for I did not till yesterday hope to have seen you so soon I must be forced not to do it I am too sick indeed very ill to go out so far and lie on a bed at my doctor's house as a kind of force upon him to get me better with all haste  I AM scarce able to see these few lines I write to wish you health and pleasure enough not to miss me today and myself patience to bear  being absent from you as well as I can being ill  I am truly Your faithful servant A POPE  LETTER X  MADAM  Jan  AFTER a very long expectation and daily hopes of the satisfaction of seeing and conversing with you I am still deprived of it in a manner that is the most afflicting because it is occasioned by your illness  and your misfortune I can bear my own I assure you much better and thus to find you lost to me at the time that I hoped to have regained you doubles the concern I should naturally feel in being deprived of any pleasure whatever  MRS H  can best express to you the concern of a friend who esteems and pities for she has the liberty to express it in her actions and the satisfaction of attending on you in your indisposition  I WISH sincerely your condition were not such as to debar me from telling you in person how truly I am yours I wish I could do you any little offices of friendship or give you any amusements or help you to what people in your present state most want better spirits If reading to you or writing to you could contribute to entertain your hours or to raise you to a livelier relish of life how well should I think my time employed indeed I should and think it a much better end of my poor studies than  all the vanities of fame or views of a character that way which engage most men of my fraternity  IF you thoroughly knew the zeal with which I am your servant you would take some notice of the advice I would give you and suffer it to have a weight with you proportionable to the sincerity with which it is given  I BEG you to do your utmost to call to you all the succours which  your own good sense and natural reflexion can suggest to avoid a melancholy way of thinking and to throw up your spirits by intervals of moderate company not to let your distemper fix itself upon your mind at least though it will not entirely quit your body Do not indulge too much solitariness Though most company be not proper or supportable during your illness force yourself to enter into such as is good and reasonable where you may have your liberty and be under no restraint  WHY will you not come to your friend Mrs H  since you are able to go out and since motion is certainly good for your health why will you not make any little sets of such as you are easiest with to sit with you sometimes  Do not think I have any interested aim in this advice though I long to see you and to try to amuse you I would not for the world be considered as one that would ever require  for my own gratification any thing that might either be improper or hurtful to you  PRAY let me know by our friend Mrs H  if there can be any thing in my power to serve or to amuse you But use me so kindly as not to think ever of writing to me till you are so well as that I may see you and then it will be needless Do not even read this if it be the least trouble to your eyes or head  BELIEVE me with great respect and the warmest good wishes for your speedy recovery  Madam  Your most faithful and most humble servant A POPE  LETTER XI  MADAM  Twitenham  June  IT was an inexpressible pleasure to me to see your letter as I assure you it had long been a great trouble to reflect on the melancholy reason of your silence and absence It was  that only which hindered my writing not only again but often to you for fear your goodnature should have been prompted to oblige me too much at your own expence by answering Indeed I never expressed and never shall be able to express more concern and good wishes for you than I shall ever feel for one of your merit  I AM sorry the moment you grow better to have you snatcht from those who I may say deserve the pleasure of seeing you in health for  having so long lamented and felt your illness  MRS H  I hope will find it not impossible to draw you to Richmond and if not I dare say will not be long out of Hertfordshire I want nothing but the same happy pretence she has of a title through your friendship and the privilege of her sex to be there immediately I cannot but wonder you have not heard from her though I should wonder if any body else had for I am told by her family she has had  much of the headake at Bath besides the excuse of a great giddiness occasioned naturally by the waters I writ to her at the first going and have not had a word from her and now you tell me the same thing I conclude she has been worse than I imagined I hear she returns on Wednesday when I shall have the satisfaction I doubt not to talk and hear a great deal of Mrs    I WISH I could say any thing either to comfort you when ill or entertain  you when well Though nothing could in the proper proportion of friendship more affect me than your condition I have not wanted other occasions of great melancholy of which the least is the loss of part of my fortune by a late act of parliament  I AM at present in the afflicting circumstance of taking my last leave of one of the  Bishop Atterbury  truest friends I ever had and one of the greatest men in all polite learning as well as the most  agreeable companion this nation ever had  I REALLY do not love life so dearly or so weakly as to value it on any other score than for that portion of happiness which a friend only can bestow upon it or if I must want that myself for the pleasure which is next it of seeing deserving and virtuous people happy So that indeed I want comfort and the greatest I can receive from you at least unless I were so happy as to deserve what I never can will be to hear you grow better  till you grow perfectly well perfectly easy and perfectly happy which no one more sincerely wishes than  Madam  Your faithful and obliged friend and servant A POPE  LETTER XII  MADAM  Twitenham  Sept  IT would be a vanity in me to tell you why I trouble you so soon again I cannot imagine myself of the number of those correspondents whom you call favourite ones yet I  know it is thought that industry may make a man what merit cannot and if an old maxim of my Lord Oxford's be true That in England if a man resolve to be any thing and constantly stick to it he may even a Lord Treasurer if so I say it shall not be want of resolution that shall hinder me from being a favourite In good earnest I am more ambitious of being so to you Madam than I ever was or ever shall be of being one to any Prince or which is more any Prince's Minister in Christendom  I WISH I could tell you any agreeable news of what your heart is concerned in but I have a sort of quarrel to Mrs H  for not loving herself so well as she does her friends for those she makes happy but not herself  THERE is an air of sadness about her which grieves me and which I have learnt by experience will increase upon an indolent I will not say an affected resignation to it  It will do so in men and much more in women who have a natural softness that sinks them even when reason does not This I tell you in confidence and pray give our friend such hints as may put her out of humour with melancholy your censure or even your raillery may have more weight with her than mine a man cannot either so decently or so delicately take upon him to be a physician in these concealed distempers  YOU see Madam I proceed in trusting you with things that nearly concern me In my last letter I spoke but of a trifle myself in this I advance farther and speak of what touches me more a friend  THIS beautiful season will raise up so many rural images and descriptions in a poetical mind that I expect you and all such as you if there be any such at least all who are not downright dull translators like your servant  must necessarily be productive of verses  I LATELY saw a sketch this way on the bower of  The lines here alluded to are as follows  In Tempe's shades the living lyre was strung  And the first Pope immortal Phoebus sung  These happy shades where equal beauty reigns  Bold rising hills slant vales and farstretch'd plains  The grateful verdure of the waving woods  The soothing murmur of the falling floods  A nobler boast a higher glory yield  Than that which Phoebus stampt on Tempe's field  All that can charm the eye or please the ear  Says Harmony itself inhabits here  BEDINGTON I  could wish you tried something in the descriptive way on any subject you please mixed with vision and moral like pieces of the old provençal poets which abound with fancy and are the most amusing scenes in nature There are three or four of this kind in Chaucer admirable  "the Flower and the Leaf"  every body has been delighted with  I HAVE long had an inclination to tell a Fairy tale the more wild and exotic the better therefore a  vision  which is confined to no rules of probability will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of description you will provided there be an apparent moral to it I think one or two of the Persian tales would give one hints for such an invention and perhaps if the scenes were taken from real places that are known in order to compliment particular gardens and buildings of a fine taste as I believe  several of Chaucer's descriptions do though it is what nobody has observed it would add great beauty to the whole  I WISH you found such an amusement pleasing to you if you did but at leisure form descriptions from objects in nature itself which struck you most livelily I would undertake to find a tale that should bring them all together which you will think an odd undertaking but in a piece of this fanciful and imaginary nature I  am sure is practicable Excuse this long letter and think no man is more  Your faithful and obliged servant A POPE  CONTENTS  LETTER
