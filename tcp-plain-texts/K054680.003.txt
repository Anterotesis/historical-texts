Ardour strove to raise  At once their Art's and Country's Praise  PRIOR  VOL III  STRAWBERRYHILL  PRINTED in the YEAR MDCCLXV  ANECDOTES of PAINTING  c  CHAP I  Painters in the Reign of Charles II  THE arts were in a manner expelled with the Royal Family from Britain The anecdotes of a Civil War are the history of Destruction In all ages the mob have vented their hatred to Tyrants on the pomp of Tyranny The magnificence the people have envied they grow to detest and mistaking consequences for causes the first objects of their fury are the palaces of their masters If Religion is thrown into the quarrel the most innocent arts are catalogued with sins This was the case in the contests between Charles and his parliament As he had blended affection to the sciences with a lust of power nonsense and ignorance were adopted into the liberties of the subject Painting became idolatry monuments were deemed carnal pride and a venerable cathedral seemed equally contradictory to Magna Charta and the Bible Learning and wit were construed to be so heathen that one would have thought the Holy Ghost could endure nothing above a pun What the fury of Henry VIII had spared was condemned by the Puritans Ruin was their harvest and they gleaned after the Reformers Had they countenanced any of the softer arts what could those arts have represented How picturesque  was the figure of an Anabaptist But sectaries have no ostensible enjoyments their pleasures are private comfortable and gross The arts that civilize society are not calculated for men who mean to rise on the ruins of established order Jargon and austerities are the weapons that best serve the purposes of heresiarcs and innovators The sciences have been excommunicated from the Gnostics to Mr Whitfield  The restoration of royalty brought back the arts not taste Charles II had a turn to mechanics none to the politer sciences He had learned  See before vol ii p  to draw in his youth in the imperial library at Vienna is a view of the isle of Jersey designed by him but he was too indolent even to amuse himself He introduced the fashions of the court of France without it's elegance He had seen Louis XIV countenance Corneille Moliere Boileau Le Sueur who forming themselves on the models of the ancients seemed by the purity of their writings to have studied only in  It has been objected by some persons that the expression of  studying in Sparta  is improper as the Spartans were an illiterate people and produced no authors A Criticism I think very illfounded The purity of the French writers not their learning is the object of the text Many men travelled to Lacedaemon to study the laws and institutions of Lycurgus Men visit all countries under the pretence at least of studying the respective manners nor have I ever heard before that the term  studying  was restricted to meer reading When I say an author wrote as chastly as if he had studied only in Sparta is it not evident that I meaned his morals not his information were formed on the purest models  Sparta Charles found as much genius at home but how licentious how indelicate was the style he permitted or demanded Dryden's tragedies are a compound of bombast and heroic obscenity inclosed in the most beautiful numbers If Wycherley  had nature it is nature stark naked The painters of that time veiled it but little more Sir Peter Lely scarce saves appearances but by a bit of fringe or embroidery His nymphs generally reposed on the turf are too wanton and too magnificent to be taken for any thing but maids of honour Yet fantastic as his compositions seem they were pretty much in the dress of the times as is evident by a puritan tract published in and intituled "Just and reasonable Reprehensions of naked Breasts and Shoulders" The court had gone a good way beyond the fashion of the preceding reign when the galantry in vogue was to wear a lock of some favorite object and yet Prynne had thought that mode so damnable that he published an absurd piece against it called The Unloveliness of Lovelocks  At the sale of the late lady Worseley was the portrait of the duchess of Somerset daughter of Robert earl of Essex Q Elizabeth's favorite with a lock of her father's hair hanging on her neck and the lock itself was in the same auction    The sectaries in opposition to the king had run into the extreme against politeness The new court to indemnify themselves and mark aversion to their rigid adversaries took the other extreme Elegance and delicacy were the point from which both sides started different ways and taste was as little sought by the men of wit as by those who called themselves the men of God The latter thought that to demolish was to reform the others that ridicule was the only rational corrective and thus while one party destroyed all order and the other gave a loose to disorder no wonder the age produced scarce any work of art that was worthy of being preserved by posterity Yet in a history of the arts as in other histories the times of confusion and barbarism must have their place to preserve the connection and to ascertain the ebb and flow of genius One likes to see through what  clouds broke forth the age of Augustus The pages that follow will present the reader with few memorable names the number must atone for merit if that can be thought any atonement The first  Vertue was told by old Mr Laroon who saw him in Yorkshire that the celebrated Rembrandt was in England in and lived or months at Hull where he drew several gentlemen and seafaring persons Mr Dahl had one of those pictures There are two fine whole lengths at Yarmouth which might be done at the same time As there is no other evidence of Rembrandt being in England it was not necessary to make a seperate article for him especially at a time when he is so well known and his works in such repute that his scratches with the difference only of a black horse or a white one sell for thirty guineas  person who made any figure and who was properly a remnant of a better age was  ISAAC FULLER  Of his family or masters I find no account except that he studied many years in France under Perrier who engraved the antique statues Graham says "he wanted the regular improvements of travel to consider the antiques and understood the anatomic part of painting perhaps equal to Michael Angelo following it so close that he was very apt to make the muscelling too strong and prominent" But this writer was not aware that the very fault he objects to Fuller did not proceed from not having seen the antiques but from having seen them too partially and that he was only to be compared to Michael Angelo from a similitude of errors flowing from a similitude of study Each caught the robust style from ancient statuary without attaining it's graces If Graham had avoided hyperbole  ISAAC FULLER  Ipse pinx TChambars sculp  he had not fallen into a blunder In his historic compositions Fuller is a wretched painter his colouring was raw and unnatural and not compensated by disposition or invention In portraits his pencil was bold strong and masterly Men who shine in the latter and miscarry in the former want imagination They succeed only in what they see Liotard is a living instance of this sterility He cannot paint a blue ribband if a lady is dressed in purple knots If he had been in the prison at the death of Socrates and the passions were as permanent as the persons on whom they act he might have made a finer picture than Nicolò Poussin  Graham speaks of Fuller as extravagant and burlesque in his manners and says that they influenced the style of his works  Elsum in an epigram that is not one of his worst agrees with this opinion On a drunken Sot His head does on his shoulder lean His eyes are sunk and hardly seen Who sees this sot in his own colour Is apt to say 'twas done by Fuller  The former character seems more true than the latter I have a picture of Ogleby by him in which he certainly has not debased his subject but has made Ogleby appear a moonstruck bard instead of a contemptible one The composition has more of Salvator than of Brauwer His own  It is much damaged and was given to the University by Dr Clarke  portrait in the gallery at Oxford is capricious but touched with great force and character His altarpieces at  Mr Addison wrote a latin poem in praise of it  Magdalen and Allsouls colleges in Oxford are despicable At Wadham college is an altarcloth in a singular manner and of merit It is just brushed over for the lights and shades and the colours melted in with a hot iron He painted too the inside of St Mary Abchurch in Canonstreet  While Fuller was at Oxford he drew several portraits and copied Dobson's decollation of St John but varying the faces from real persons For Herodias who held the charger he painted his own mistress her mother for the old woman receiving the head in a bag and the ruffian who cut it off was a noted bruiser of that age There was besides a little boy with a torch which illuminated the whole picture Fuller received pieces for it In king James's catalogue is mentioned a picture by him representing Fame and Honour treading down Envy Colonel Seymour  Vertue bought it and from his sale I purchased it  had a head of Pierce the carver by Fuller He was much employed to paint the great taverns  Sir P Lely seeing a portrait of Norris the king's framemaker an old greyheaded man finely painted by Fuller lamented that such a genius should drown his talents in wine  in London particularly the mitre in Fenchurchstreet where he adorned all the sides of a great room in pannels as was then the fashion The figures were as large as life a Venus Satyr and sleeping Cupid a boy riding a goat and another fallen down over the chimney this was the best part of the performance says Vertue Saturn devouring a child Mercury Minerva Diana Apollo and Bacchus Venus and Ceres embracing a young Silenus fallen down and holding a goblet into which a boy was pouring wine the seasons between the windows and on the ceiling two angels supporting a mitre in a large circle this part was very bad and the colouring of the Saturn too raw and his figure too muscular He painted five very large pictures the history of the king's escape after the battle of Worcester they cost a great sum but were little esteemed  Vertue had seen two books with etchings by Fuller the first Caesar  Ripa's Emblems some of the plates by Fuller others by Henry Cooke and Tempesta The second was called Libro da Disegnare or of the plates by our painter  He died in Bloomsburysquare July and left a son an ingenious but idle man according to Vertue chiefly employed in coachpainting He led a dissolute life and died young  Fuller had one Scholar Charles Woodfield who entered under him at Oxford and served seven years He generally painted views buildings monuments and antiquities but being as idle as his master's son often wanted necessaries He died suddenly in his chair in the year at the age of  CORNELIUS BOLL  A painter of whom I find no particulars but that he made views of London before the fire which proves that he was here early in this reign if not in the last these views were at Suttonplace in Surrey and represented Arundelhouse Somersethouse and the Tower Vertue who saw them says they were in a good free taste  JOHN FREEMAN  An historic painter was a rival of Fuller which seems to have been his greatest glory He was thought to have been poisoned in the Westindies but however died in England after having been employed in painting scenes for the theatre in Coventgarden  Graham p    REMÈE or REMIGIUS VAN LEMPUT  Was born at Antwerp and arrived at some excellence by copying the works of Vandyck he imitated too with success the Flemish masters as Stone did the Italians and for the works of Lely Remèe told that master that he could copy them better than Sir Peter could himself I have already mentioned his small picture from Holbein of the two Henrys and their queens and that his purchase in king Charles's sale of the king on horseback was taken from him by a suit at law after he had demanded guineas for it at Antwerp and been bid The earl of Pomfret at Easton had a copy of Raphael's Galatea by him and at Penshurst is a small whole length of Francis earl of Bedford aet from Vandyck Mr Stevens historiographer to the king had some portraits of his family painted by Remèe The latter had a wellchosen collection of prints and drawings  Graham p  He died in Nov and was buried in the churchyard of Coventgarden as his son Charles had been in His daughter was a paintress and married to Thomas brother of  ROBERT STREATER  Who was appointed serjeant painter at the restoration He was the son of a painter and born in Coventgarden and studied under Du Moulin Streater did not confine himself to any branch of his art but succeeded best in architecture perspective landscape and still life Graham calls him the greatest and most universal painter that ever  ROBERT STREATER  ABannerman sculp ipse pinx  England bred but with about as much judgment as where he says that Streater's being a good historian contributed not a little to his perfection in that way of painting He might as well say that reading the Rape of the Lock would make one a good haircutter I should rely more on Sanderson who speaking of landscape says "of our own nation I know none more excellent but Streater who indeed is a compleat master therein as also in other arts of etching  He engraved a plate of the battle of Naseby The plates for Sir Robert Stapleton's Juvenal were designed by Streater Barlow and Danckers  graving and his work of architecture and perspective not a line but is true to the rules of art and symmetry  Graphice p  " And again comparing our own countrymen with foreigners in different branches he adds "Streater in all paintings  Ib  " But from the few works that I have seen of his hand I can by no means subscribe to these encomiums The Theatre at Oxford his principal performance is a very mean one yet Streater was as much commended for it as by the authors I have mentioned for his works in general One Robert Whitehall  V Wood's Athenae vol ii p A description in prose of that painting is in the new Oxfordguide  a poetaster of that age wrote a poem called Urania or a description of the painting at the top of the Theatre at Oxford which concluded with these lines  That future ages must confess they owe  To Streater more than Michael Angelo  At Oxford Streater painted too the chapel at Allsouls except the Resurrection which is the work of Sir James Thornhill Vertue  saw a picture which he commends of a Dr Prujean  Vertue met with a print Opinion sitting in a tree thus inscribed Viro clariss Dno Francisco Prujeano Medico omnium bonarum artium elegantiarum Fautori admiratori summo D D D H Peacham  in his gown and long hair one hand on a death's head and the other on some books with this inscription Amicitiae ergo pinxit Rob Streater And in the possession of a captain Streater the portrait of Robert by himself of his brother Thomas by Lankrink and of Thomas's wife the daughter of Remèe by herself Vertue had also seen two letters directed to serjeant Streater at his house in Longacre the first from the  This was earl Philip mentioned in the Memoires de Grammont He was very handsome and had remarkably fine hair Lord Harrington has a good head of him by Sir Peter Lely in which these circumstances are observed  earl of Chesterfield dated june mentioning a picture of Mutius Scaevola for which he had paid him  l  and offering him  l  if he would paint six small pictures with figures His lordship commends too the story of Rinaldo bought of Streater but wishes the idea of the Hero had been taken from the duke of Monmouth or some very handsome man The other letter was from the  The famous George lord Digby There is at Althrop a suit of arras with his arms which he gave to his daughter the countess of Sunderland whom I mention to rectify a common blunder It is the portrait of this lady Anne Digby who had light hair and a large square face that is among the beauties at Windsor and not her motherinlaw Sacharissa who had a round face and dark hair and who probably was no beauty in the reign of Charles II  earl of Bristol at Wimbledon about some paintings to be done for him  Graham James II had seven of his hand V his catalogue  Other works of Streater were ceilings at Whitehall the war of the giants at Sir Robert Clayton's Moses and Aaron at St Michael's  VAN SON  A Bannerman Sculp  Cornhill and all the scenes at the old playhouse He died in at the age of not long after being cut for the stone though Charles II had so much kindness for him as to send for a surgeon from Paris to perform the operation He had a good collection of Italian books prints drawings and pictures which on the death of his son in were sold by auction Among them were the following by Streater himself which at least show the universality of his talent Lacy the player a hen and chickens two heads an eagle a landscape and flowers a large pattern of the king's arms Isaac and Rebecca fruitpieces Abraham and Isaac the nativity Jacob's vision Mary Magdalen building and figures two dogs They sold says Vertue for no great price some for five pounds some for ten  HENRY ANDERTON  V Graham    Was disciple of Streater whose manner he followed in landscape and still life Afterwards he travelled to Italy and at his return took to portraitpainting and having drawn the famous Mrs Stuart duchess of Richmond he was employed by the king and court and even interfered with the business of Sir Peter Lely Anderton died soon after the year  FRANCIS VANSON or VANZOON  Was born at Antwerp and learned of his father a flower painter but he came early into England and marrying Streater's neice succeeded to much of her uncle's business Vertue and Graham commend  the freedom of his pencil but his subjects were illchosen He painted stilllife oranges and lemons plate damask curtains cloths of gold and that medley of familiar objects that strike the ignorant vulgar In Streater's sale mentioned above were near thirty of Vanson's pieces which sold well among others was the crown of England and birds in watercolours Vanson's patron was the  Charles Bodville Robartes second earl of Radnor who succeeded his grandfather in and was lord warden of the stanneries and by king George I made treasurer of the chambers He died in  earl of Radnor who at his house in St James's square had near eighteen or twenty of his works over doors and chimnies c there was one large piece loaded with fruit flowers and dead game by him and his own portrait in it painted by Laguerre with a hawk on his fist The staircase of that house was painted by Laguerre and the apartments were ornamented by the principal artists then living as Edema Wyck Roestraten Danckers old Griffier young Vandevelde and Sybrecht The collection  In this sale were some capital pictures as Rubens and his mistress I suppose it should be his wife and that it is the picture at Blenheim sold for guineas the martyrdom of St Laurence by Vandyck guineas a satyr with a woman milking a goat by Jordan of Antwerp guineas and the family piece which I have mentioned in the life of Vandyck bought by Mr Scawen for  l  was sold in Some of his pictures were eight or nine feet high and in them he proposed to introduce all the medicinal plants in the physic garden at Chelsea but grew tired of the undertaking before he had compleated it He lived chiefly in Longacre and lastly in St Alban'sstreet where he died in the year at past fifty years of age  SAMUEL VAN HOOGSTRATEN  Was another of those painters of still life a manner at that time in fashion It was not known that he had been in England till Vertue discovered it by a picture of his hand at a sale in Coventgarden The ground represented a walnuttree board with papers pens penknife and an English almanack of the year a gold medal and the portrait of the author in a supposed ebony frame long hair inclining to red and his name S V Hoogstraten The circumstance of the English almanack makes it probable that this painter was in England at least in that year and Vertue found it confirmed by Houbraken his scholar who in his lives  There is also an account of him in the second volume of Descamps which was published but a little time before the death of Vertue  of the painters says that Hoogstraten was born at Dordrecht in was first instructed by his father and then by Rembrandt That he painted in various kinds particularly small portraits and was countenanced by the emperor and king of Hungary That he travelled to Italy and came to England that he was author of a book on painting called Zichtbare Waerelt geselt worden and died at Dordrecht in  BALTHAZAR VAN LEMENS  Was among the first that came over after the restoration when a reestablished court promised the revival of arts and consequently advantage to artists but the poor man was as much disappointed as if he had been useful to the court in it's depression He was born at Antwerp  in and is said  Graham A head of Charles I by one Lemons is mentioned in that king's collection p Whether the father of this person or whether a different name as there is a slight variation in the orthography I do not know  to have succeeded in small histories but not being encouraged and having a fruitful invention and easy pencil his best profit was making sketches for others of his profession He lived to and was buried in Westminster His brother who resided at Brussels painted a head of him  ABRAHAM HONDIUS  Was born at Rotterdam in when he came to England or who was his master is not known His manner indeed seems his own it was bold and free and except Rubens and Snyder few masters have painted animals in so great a style Though he drew both figures and landscape dogs and huntings were his favorite subjects Vertue says he was a man of humour and that one of his maxims was that the goods of other men might be used as our own and that finding another man's wife of the same mind he took and kept her till she died after which he married He lived on Ludgatehill but died of a severe course of the gout in at the blackmore's head overagainst Waterlane Fleetstreet One of his first pictures was the burning of Troy and he frequently painted candlelights His best was a dogmarket sold at Mr Halsted's auction in Above on steps were men and women well executed My father had two large pieces of his hand the one a boar the other a staghunting very capital Vertue mentions besides a landscape painted in Diana returned from hunting and a bullbaiting dated  ABRAHAM HONDIUS  Ipse pinx TChambars sculp  S  r  PETER LELY  Se ipse pinx A Bannerman Sculp  Jodocus Hondius probably the grandfather of Abraham had been in England before and was an engraver of maps He executed some of Speed's and  V British Librarian  one of the voyages of Thomas Cavendish and Sir Francis Drake round the globe He also engraved a genealogic chart of the houses of York and Lancaster with the arms of the knights of the garter to the year drawn by Thomas Talbot a map of the Roman empire another of the Holyland and particularly the celestial and terrestrial globes the largest that had then ever been printed I shall say nothing more of him in this place as the catalogue of English engravers I reserve for a seperate volume but that he left a son Henry born in London whom I take for the father of Abraham Hondius and who finished several things that had been left imperfect by Jodocus  Mr WILLIAM LIGHTFOOT  Graham    An English painter of perspective landscape and architecture in which last science he practiced too having some share in the Royalexchange He died about  Sir PETER LELY  Not only the most capital painter of this reign but whose works are admitted amongst the classics of the art was born at Soest in Westphalia where his father a captain of Foot was in garrison His name was Vander Vaas but being born at the Hague in a perfumer's shop the sign of the Lilly he received the appellation of captain Du  Lys or Lely which became the proper name of the son He received his first instructions in painting from one De Grebber and began with landscape and historic figures less than life but coming to England in and seeing the works of Vandyck he quitted his former style and former subjects and gave himself wholly to portraits in emulation of that great man His success was considerable though not equal to his ambition if in nothing but simplicity he fell short of his model as Statius or Claudian did of Virgil If Vandyck's portraits are often tame and spiritless at least they are natural His laboured draperies flow with ease and not a fold but is placed with propriety Lely supplied the want of taste with clinquant his nymphs trail fringes and embroidery through meadows and purling streams Add that Vandyck's habits are those of the times Lely's a sort of fantastic nightgowns fastened with a single pin  Your nightgown fasten'd with a single pin  Fancy improv'd the wond'rous charms within  L M W Montagu  The latter was in truth the ladiespainter and whether the age was improved in beauty or in  This suspicion is authorized by Mr Dryden who says "It was objected against a late noble painter that he drew many graceful pictures but few of them were like And this happened to him because he always studied himself more than those who sat to him" Pref to second part of his miscellanies  flattery Lely's women are certainly much handsomer than those of Vandyck They please as much more as they evidently meaned to please he caught the reigning character and  on animated canvass stole  The sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul  I don't know whether even in softness of the flesh he did not

earl of Northumberland has Sir Peter's receipt for it the price  l  There is a poem by Lovelace on this very picture p R Symondes too mentions it and the portraits of the duke of York and the lady

Gloucester with a fountain by him which is wanting Symondes adds Sir Peter had  l  for a ritratto  l  if down to the knees  unlike  Sir Peter's latter manner and is stronger than his former The king

well as the setting Captain Winde told Sheffield duke of Buckingham that Oliver certainly sat to him and while sitting said to him "Mr Lely I desire you would use all your skill to paint my picture

the  Several by him and Vandyck are in the gallery at Althorp one of those enchanted scenes with a thousand circumstances of history and art endear to a pensive spectator  works of this master though

John Vallenhove Descamps vol ii  Few of his historic pieces  are known at Windsor is a Magdalen and a naked Venus asleep the duke of Devonshire has one the story of Jupiter and Europa lord Pomfret had that of Cimon and Iphigenia and at Burleigh is Susanna with the two Elders In Streater's sale was a Holy Family a a sketch in black and white which sold for five pounds and Vertue mentions and commends another a Bacchanal of four or five naked boys sitting on a tub the wine running out with his mark  Lens made a mezzotinto from a Judgment of Paris by him another was of Susanna and the Elders His designs are not more common they are in Indian ink heightened with white He sometimes painted in crayons and well I have his own head by himself Mr Methuen has Sir Peter's and his family in

the same kind from Simon Varelst patronized by the duke of Buckingham from Gascar who was brought over by the duchess of Portsmouth and from the rising merit of Kneller whom the French author I have mentioned sets with little reason far below Sir Peter Both had too little variety in airs of heads Kneller was bolder and more careless Lely more delicate in finishing The latter showed by his pains how high he could  arrive It is plain that if Sir Godfrey had painted much less and applied more he would have been the greater master This perhaps is as true a parallel as the French author's who thinks that Kneller might have disputed with Lely in the beauty of his head of hair Descamps is so weak as to impute Sir Peter's death to his jealousy of Kneller though he owns it was almost sudden an account which is almost nonsense especially as he adds that Lely's physician who knew not the cause of his malady heightened it by repetitions of Kneller's success It was an extraordinary kind of sudden death  Sir Peter Lely  The celebrated astronomer and miser Robert Hooke was first placed with Sir Peter Lely but soon quitted him from not being able to bear the smell of the oilcolours But though he gave up painting his mechanic genius turned among other studies to architecture He gave a plan for rebuilding London after the fire but though it was not accepted he got a large sum of money as one of the commissioners from the persons who claimed the several distributions of the ground and this money he locked up in an iron chest for thirty years I have heard that he designed the college of Physicians he certainly did Ask's hospital near Hoxton He was very able very sordid cynical wrongheaded and whimsical Proof enough of the last was his maintaining that Ovid's Metamorphosis was an allegoric account of earthquakes See the history of his other qualities in the Biographia Britannica vol iv  died of an apoplexy as he was drawing the duchess of Somerset and in the d year of his age

whose works he copied in great perfection and some of Vandyck's particularly the earl of Strafford which was in the possession of Watson earl of Rockingham Vertue mentions the portraits of Mr Davenant and his wife son of Sir William by Buckshorn He painted draperies for Sir Peter and dying at the age of was buried at St Martin's  JOHN GREENHILL  The French author calls him Greenfill the public is

nose flattened is taken from a painting of Greenhill His heads in crayons were much admired and that he sometimes engraved appears from a print of his brother Henry a merchant of Salisbury done by him

Lely's being jealous of him and refusing to let Greenhill see him paint till the scholar procured his master to draw his wife's picture and stood behind him while he drew it The improbability of this tale is heightened by an anecdote which Walton told Vertue or if true Sir Peter's generosity appears the greater he settling forty pounds a year on Greenhill's widow who was left with several Children

LANKRINK  V Graham    Of German extraction born about his father a soldier of fortune brought his wife and this his only son into the Netherlands and obtaining a commission there died at Antwerp The widow designed  the boy for a monk but his inclination to painting discovering itself early he was permitted to follow his genius His best lessons he obtained in the academy at Antwerp and from the collection of Mynheer Van Lyan The youth made a good choice chiefly drawing after the designs of Salvator Rosa On his mother's death from whom he inherited a small fortune he came to England and was patronized by Sir Edward Spragge and Sir William Williams whose house was filled with his works but being burned down not much remains of Lankrink's hand he having passed great part of his time in that gentleman's service His landscapes are much commended Sir Peter Lely employed him for his backgrounds A single ceiling of his was at Mr Kent's at Causham in Wiltshire near Bath He sometimes drew from the life and imitated the manner of Titian in small figures for his landscapes Some of those were in the hands of his patrons Mr Henly Mr Trevor Mr Austen and Mr Hewitt the latter of whom had a good collection of pictures So had Lankrink himself and of drawings prints and models He bought much at Lely's sale for which he borrowed Money of Mr Austen to discharge which debt Lankrink's collection was seized after his death and sold He went deep into the pleasures of that age grew idle and died in in Coventgarden and was buried at his own request under the porch of that church A limning of his head was in Streater's sale  JOHN BAPTIST GASPARS  Was born at Antwerp and studied under Thomas Willeborts Bossaert a disciple of  Graham by mistake says of Vandyck There is a fine little holy family at Houghton by Willeborts from a large one of Rubens  Rubens Baptist Gaspars who must not be confounded  M  rs  ANN KILLIGREW  Ipse pinx TChambars sculp  with Baptist Monoyer the flowerpainter came into England during the civil war and entered into the service of general Lambert upon the restoration he was employed by Sir Peter Lely to paint his postures and was known by the name of Lely's Baptist He had the same business under Riley and Sir Godfrey Kneller He drew well and made good designs for tapestry The portrait of Charles II in Painter'shall and another of the same prince with mathematical instruments in the hall of St Bartholomew's hospital were painted by this Baptist who died in and was buried at St James's  JOHN VANDER EYDEN  Graham This was not VanderEyden so famous for his neat manner of painting small views of streets and houses    A portrait painter of Brussels copied and painted draperies for Sir Peter till marrying he settled in Northamptonshire where he was much employed particularly by the earls of Rutland and Gainsborough and the lord Sherard at whose house he died about and was buried at Staplefort in Leicestershire  Mrs ANNE KILLIGREW  Daughter of Dr Henry Killigrew  See an account of him in Wood's Athenae vol ii col  master of the Savoy and one of the Prebendaries of Westminster was born in St Martin'slane London a little before the restoration Her family was remarkable for it's loyalty accomplishments and wit and this young lady promised  to be one of it's fairest ornaments Antony Wood says she was a grace for beauty and a muse for wit Dryden has celebrated her genius for painting and poetry in a very long ode in which the rich stream of his numbers has hurried along with it all that his luxuriant fancy produced in his way it is an harmonious hyperbole composed of the fall of Adam Arethusa Vestal Virgins Diana Cupid Noah'sark the Pleiades the valley of Jehosaphat and the last Assizes Yet Antony Wood assures us "there is nothing spoken of her which she was not equal to if not superior" and his proof is as wise as his assertion for says he "if there had not been more true history in her praises than compliment her father would never have suffered them to pass the press" She was maid of honour to the duchess of York and died of the smallpox in in the th year of her age  Her poems were published after her death in a thin quarto with a print of her taken from her portrait drawn by herself which with the leave of the authors I have quoted is in a much better style than her poetry and evidently in the manner of Sir Peter Lely She drew the pictures of James II and of her mistress Mary of Modena some pieces of stilllife and of history three of the latter she has recorded in her own poems St John in the wilderness Herodias with the head of that saint and two of Diana's nymphs At admiral Killigrew's sale were the following pieces by her hand Venus and Adonis a Satyr playing on a pipe Judith and Holofernes a woman's head the Graces dressing Venus and her own portrait "These pictures says Vertue I saw but can say little"  She was buried in the chapel of the Savoy where is a monument to her memory with a latin epitaph which with the translation may be  seen prefixed to her poems and in Ballard's Memoires of learned ladies p  BUSTLER  From Graham p as is the following article    A Dutch painter of history and portraits Mr Elsum of the Temple whose tracts on painting I have mentioned had a picture of three boors painted by this man the landscape behind by Lankrink and a little dog on one side by Hondius  DANIEL BOON  Of the same country a droll painter which turn he meaned to express both in his large and small pieces He lived to about the year There is a mezzotinto of him playing on a violin  ISAAC PALING  From Houbraken's Lives of the Painters    Another Dutchman Scholar of Abraham Vander Tempel was many years in England and practiced portrait painting He returned to his own country in  HENRY PAERT or PEART  Disciple of Barlow and afterwards of Henry Stone from whom he contracted a talent for copying He exerted this on most of the historic pieces of the royal collection I suppose he was an indifferent performer  for Graham says he wanted a warmth and beauty of colouring and that his copies were better than his portraits Vertue mentions a half length of James earl of Northampton copied from a head by Paert who then lived in Pallmall  There is a print from his painting of a Morocco embassador  He died in or  HENRY DANKERS  Of the Hague was bred an engraver but by the persuasion of his brother John who was a painter of history he turned to landscape and having studied some time in Italy came to England where he was countenanced by Charles II and employed in drawing views of the royal palaces and the seaports of England and Wales Of his first profession there is a head after Titian with his name Henricus Dankers Hagiensis sculpsit Of the latter were several in the royal collection James II had no fewer  V his catalogue published by Bathoe  than twentyeight  One I suppose of these the beginning of Greenwich is now in a small closet by the king's bedchamber at St James's  views and landscapes by him one of them was a sliding piece before a picture of Nell Gwynn In the publick diningroom at Windsor is the marriage of St Catherine by him In lord Radnor's sale were other views of Windsor Plymouth Penzance c and his name HDankers F He made besides several designs for Hollar Being a Roman Catholic he left England in the time of the Popish plot and died soon after at Amsterdam  Graham    THOMAS FLATMAN  Hayls pinxit AWalker sculp  t    PARREY WALTON  Graham  Though a disciple of Walker was little more than journeyman to the arts He understood hands and having the care of the royal collection repaired several pictures in it His son was continued in the same employment and had an apartment in Somersethouse The copy which is at St James's of the Cyclops by Luca Giordano at Houghton was the work of the latter The father painted stilllife and died about the year  THOMAS FLATMAN  Another instance of the union of poetry and  Flatman received a mourningring with a diamond worth  l  for his poem on the death of Lord Ossory  painting and of a profession that seldom accords with either was bred at the Innertemple but I believe neither made a figure nor staid long there yet among Vertue's MSS I find an epigram written by Mr Oldys on Flatman's three vocations as if he had shone in all though in truth he distinguished himself only in miniature  Should Flatman for his client strain the laws  The Painter gives some colour to the cause  Should Critics censure what the Poet writ  The Pleader quits him at the bar of wit  Mr Tooke schoolmaster of the Charterhouse had a head of his father by Flatman which was so well painted that Vertue took it for  Cooper's and lord Oxford had another limning of a young knight of the Bath in a rich habit dated and with the painter's initial letter F which was so masterly that Vertue pronounces Flatman equal to Hoskins and next to Cooper  Mrs Hoadley first wife of the late bishop of Winchester and a mistress of painting herself had Flatman's own head by him Another  There is a mezzotinto of Flatman holding a drawing of Charles II en medaille and a smaller head painted by Hayls and neatly engraved by R White  was finished by Mrs Beale Dec as appears by her husband's pocketbook from which I shall hereafter give several other extracts The same person says "Mr Flatman borrowed of my wife her copy of lady Northumberland's picture from Sir Peter Lely"  Flatman was born in Aldersgatestreet and educated in Wykeham's school near Winchester and in was elected fellow of Newcollege but left Oxford without taking a degree Some of his poems were published in a volume with his name others with some singular circumstances relating to them are mentioned by Antony  Athenae vol ii p  Wood Flatman had a small estate at Tishton near Dis in Norfolk and dying Dec was buried in St Bride's London where his eldest son had been interred before him his father a clerk in Chancery and then fourscore surviving him  CLAUDE LE FEVRE  A man of indigent circumstances studied first in the palace of Fontainbleau where he was born in and then at Paris under Le  CLAUDE LA FEVRE  M  r  JOHN HAYLS  TChambars sculp  Sueur and Le Brun the latter of whom advised him to adhere to portraits for which he had a particular talent The French author  Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres vol ii p  from whom I transcribe says that in that style he equalled the best masters of that country and that passing into England he was reckoned a second Vandyck If he was thought so then it is entirely forgotten Both Graham and Vertue knew so little of him that the first mentions him not and the latter confounded him with Valentine Le Fevre of Brussels who never was here yet mentions a mezzotint of Alexandre Boudan imprimeur du roi done at Paris by Sarabe the eyes of which were printed in blue and the face and hands in fleshcolour From hence I conclude that Graham made another mistake in his account of  LE FEVRE DE VENISE  Whose christian name was Roland and who he says gained the favour of prince Rupert by a secret of staining marble As that prince invented mezzotinto I conclude it was Claude who learned it of his highness during his intercourse with him and communicated it to Sarabe at Paris Le Fevre de Venise certainly was in England and died here as Claude did Vertue says that his Le Fevre painted chiefly portraits and histories in small in the manner of Vandyck the latter of which were not always very decent As I am desirous of adjusting the pretensions of the three Le Fevres and should be unwilling to attribute to either of the wrong what his modesty might make him decline I mean the last article I am inclined to bestow the nudities on Roland qui se plaisoit says  Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres vol ii p  my author à dessiner  en caricatures les characters les temperamens de ceux qu'il conoissoit imitant en cela Annibal CaracciOne knows what sort of  temperamens  Annibal painted  Claude died in at the age of fortytwo Roland died in Bearstreet near Leicesterfields in about the th year of his age and was buried at St Martin's  Mercier painter to the late prince of Wales bought at an auction the portrait of Le Fevre in a spottedfurrcap with a pallet in his hand I suppose painted by himself and at Burlingtonhouse is the picture of Rousseau the painter by Le Fevre I suppose Roland  JOHN HAYLS  So he writes his name on the portrait of Flatman In Painter'shall is a St Sebastian and a portrait of Mr Morgan by one Hayes as I find no other mention of this man it may be a mistake for Hayls so Vertue supposed    Remarkable for copying Vandyck well and for being a rival of Lely A portrait of himself in watercolours purchased by colonel Seymour at Mr Bryan's sale ill drawn but strongly coloured induced Vertue to think that Lely was not the only person whom Hayls had an ambition to rival but that this was a first essay in competition with Cooper However I find by a note in a different volume that some thought this miniature was by Hoskins At Woburn is the portrait of colonel John Russel of whom there is a better picture in the Memoires de Grammont third son of Francis earl of Bedford and another of lady Diana second daughter of William the first duke of that house both by Hayls and he drew the father of secretary Pepys He lived in Southamptonstreet Bloomsbury and dying there suddenly in was buried in St Martin's  HENRY GASCAR  Another competitor of Sir Peter was a French portraitpainter patronized by the duchess of Portsmouth and in compliment to her much encouraged Graham speaks of his tawdry style which was more the fault of the age than of the painter The pomp of Louis XIV infected Europe and Gascar whose business was to please succeeded as well in Italy as he had in England from whence he carried above  l  At Chesterton Vertue saw a head in armour of Edmund Verney with Gascar's name to it His best performance was a half length at lord Pomfret's of Philip earl of Pembroke which he drew by stealth by order of his patroness whose sister lord Pembroke had married I suppose this desire of having her brotherinlaw's picture was dated before a quarrel she had with him for illusage of her sister The duchess threatened to complain to the king the earl told her if she did he would set her upon her head at Charingcross and show the nation it's grievance  SIMON VARELST  A real ornament of Charles's reign and one of the few who have arrived at capital excellence in that branch of the art was a Dutch flowerpainter It is not certain in what year he arrived in England his works were extremely admired and his prices the greatest that had been known in this country The duke of Buckingham patronized him but having too much wit to be only beneficent and perceiving the poor man to be immoderately vain he piqued him to attempt portraits Varelst thinking nothing impossible to his pencil fell into  the snare and drew the duke himself but crouded it so much with fruits and sunflowers that the king to whom it was showed took it for a flowerpiece However as it sometimes happens to wiser buffoons than Varelst he was laughed at till he was admired and Sir Peter Lely himself became the real sacrifice to the jest he lost much of his business and retired to Kew while Varelst engrossed the fashion and for one half length was paid an hundred and ten pounds His portraits were exceedingly laboured and finished with the same delicacy as his flowers which he continued to introduce into them Lord chancellor Shaftsbury going to sit was received by him with his hat on Don't you know me said the peer Yes replied the painter you are my lord chancellor And do you know me I am Varelst The king can make any man chancellor but he can make nobody a Varelst Shaftsbury was disgusted and sat to Greenhill In Varelst his brother Harman Henny and Parmentiere all painters went to Paris but staid not long In Varelst was a witness on the divorce between the duke and duchess of Norfolk one who had married Varelst's half sister was brought to set aside his evidence and deposed his having been mad and confined He was so but not much more than others of his profession have been his lunacy was selfadmiration he called himself the  When fam'd Varelst this little wonder drew  Flora vouchsaf'd the growing work to view  Finding the painter's science at a stand  The goddess snatch'd the pencil from his hand  And finishing the piece she smiling said  Behold one work of mine that ne'er shall fade  God of Flowers and went to Whitehall saying he wanted to converse with the king for  VERRIO  ABannerman Sculp  two or three hours Being repulsed he said "He is king of England I am king of painting why should not we converse together familiarly" He showed an historic piece on which he had laboured twenty years and boasted that it contained the several manners and excellencies of Raphael Titian Rubens and Vandyck When Varelst Kneller and Jervase have been so mad with vanity to what a degree of phrenzy had Raphael pretensionsBut he was modest Varelst was shut up towards the end of his life but recovered his senses at last not his genius and lived to a great age certainly as late as and died in Suffolkstreet In king James's collection were six of his hand the king queen and duchess of Portsmouth half lengths a landscape flowers and fruit In lord Pomfret's were nine flowerpieces  His brother Harman Varelst lived some time at Vienna till the Turks beseiged it in He painted history fruit and flowers and dying about was buried in St Andrew's Holbourn He left a son of his profession called Cornelius and a very accomplished daughter who painted in oil and drew small histories portraits both in large and small understood music and spoke Latin German Italian and other languages  ANTONIO VERRIO  A Neapolitan an excellent painter for the sort of subjects on which he was employed that is without much invention and with less taste his exuberant pencil was ready at pouring our gods goddesses kings emperors and triumphs over those public surfaces on which the eye never rests long enough to criticize and where one should be sorry to place the works of a better master I mean cielings and staircases  The New Testament or the Roman History cost him nothing but ultramarine that and marble columns and marble steps he never spared He first settled in France and painted the high altar of the Carmelites at Thoulouse which is described in Du Puy's Traitè sur la Peinture p Thoul  Charles II having a mind to revive the manufacture of tapestry at Mortlack which had been interrupted by the civil war sent for Verrio to England but changing his purpose consigned over Windsor to his pencil The king was induced to this by seeing some of his painting at lord Arlington's at the end of St James'spark where at present stands Buckinghamhouse The first picture Verrio drew for the king was his majesty in naval triumph now in the public diningroom in the castle He executed most of the ceilings there one whole side of St George'shall and the chapel On the ceiling of the former he has pictured Antony earl of Shaftsbury in the character of Faction dispersing libels as in another place he revenged a private quarrel with the housekeeper Mrs Marriot by borrowing her ugly face for one of the furies With still greater impropriety he has introduced himself Sir Godfrey Kneller and Bap May surveyor of the works in long periwigs as spectators of Christ healing the sick He is recorded as operator of all these gawdy works in a large inscription over the tribune at the end of the hall  There is a description of St George'shall in the Musae Anglicanae    Antonius Verrio Neapolitanus  non ignobili stirpe natus  ad honorem Dei  Augustissimi Regis Caroli secundi  et  Sancti Georgii  Molem hanc felicissimâ manu  Decoravit  The king paid him generously Vertue met with a memorandum of monies he had received for his performances  St George'shall is not specified I suppose it was done afterwards  at Windsor As the comparison of prices in different ages may be one of the most useful parts of this work and as it is remembered what Annibal Caracci received for his glorious labour in the Farnese palace at Rome it will not perhaps be thought tedious if I set down this account  Copied says Vertue from a half sheet of paper fairly writ in a hand of the time  An account of moneys paid for painting done in Windsorcastle for his majesty by Signior Verrio since July

Woodcutt        In all        The king's bounty did not stop here Verrio had a place of mastergardiner and a lodging at the end of the park now Carletonhouse He was expensive and kept a great table and often pressed the king for money with a freedom which his majesty's own frankness indulged Once at Hamptoncourt when he had but lately received an advance of a thousand pounds he found the king in such a circle that he could not approach He called out Sire I desire the favour of speaking to your majestyWell Verrio said the king what is your request Money Sir I am so short in cash that I am not able to pay my workmen and your majesty and I have learned by experience that pedlars and painters cannot give credit long The king smiled and said he had but lately ordered him  l  Yes Sir replied he but that was soon paid away and I have no gold left At that rate said the king you would spend more than I do to maintain my family True answered Verrio but does your majesty keep an open table as I do  He gave the designs for the large equestrian picture of that monarch in the hall at Chelseacollege but it was finished by Cook and presented by lord Ranelagh  On the accession of James II Verrio was again employed at Windsor in Wolsey's Tombhouse then destined for a Romishchapel He painted that king and several of his courtiers in the hospital of Christchurch London Among other portraits there is Dr Hawes a physician Vertue saw the original head from whence he translated it into the great piece which Verrio presented to the hospital He painted too at that of St Bartholomew  The revolution was by no means agreable to Verrio's religion or principles He quitted his place and even refused to work for king  William From that time he was for some years employed at the lord Exeter's at Burleigh and afterwards at Chatsworth At the former he painted several chambers which are reckoned among his best works He has placed his own portrait in the room where he represented the history of Mars and Venus and for the Bacchus bestriding a hogshead he has according to his usual liberty  It was more excusable that when his patron obliged him to insert a pope in a procession not very honorable to the Romish religion he added the portrait of the archbishop of Canterbury then living  borrowed the countenance of a dean with whom he was at variance At Chatsworth is much of his hand The altarpiece in the chapel is the best piece I ever saw of his the subject the incredulity of St Thomas He was employed too at Lowtherhall but the house has been burnt At last by persuasion of lord Exeter he condescended to serve king William and was sent to Hamptoncourt where among other things he painted the great staircase and as ill as if he had spoiled it out of principle His eyes failing him * queen Anne gave him a pension of  l  a year for life but he did not enjoy it long dying at Hamptoncourt in  Scheffers of Utrecht was employed by Verrio for twentyfive years At his first arrival he had worked for picturesellers Lanscron was another painter in Verrio's service and assisted him seven or eight years at Windsor  It was not only this decay but his death that prevented his being employed at Blenheim as probably was intended for the author of some verses addressed to Verrio in the sixth volume of Dryden's miscellanies carried his prophetic imagination so far as to behold the duke's triumphs represented there by our painter who died before the house was built  JAMES HUYSMAN or HOUSMAN  Graham  Was born at Antwerp in and studied under Bakerel a scholar of Rubens and competitor of Vandyck Bakerel was a poet too and a satyric one and having writ an invective against the Jesuits was obliged to fly Huysman deprived of his master came to England and painted both history and portraits In the latter he rivalled Sir Peter Lely and with reason His picture of lady Byron over the chimney in the beautyroom at Windsor is at least as highly finished and coloured with as much force as Sir Peter's works in that chamber tho' the  I find in Vertue's notes that he had been told it is not lady Byron but lady Bellassis If it was the lady Bellassis who was mistress to king James it becomes more valuable and while Charles paid his brother the compliment of enrolling the latter's mistress with his own he tacitly insinuated how much better a taste he had himself I have an unfinished head by Cooper of king James's lady Bellassis which is historically plain Huysman's picture has certainly some resemblance to the mezzotinto of her from Sir Peter Lely  lady who sat for it is the least handsome of the set His Cupids were admired himself was most partial to his picture of queen Catherine There is a mezzotinto from it representing her like St Catherine King James  See his catalogue There too is mentioned the duchess of Richmond in man's apparel by Huysman It is a pretty picture now at Kensington the dress is that of a Cavalier about the time of the civil war buff with blue ribbands  had another in the dress of a shepherdess and there is a third in Painter'shall He created himself the queen's painter and to justify it made her sit for every Madonna or Venus that he drew His capital work was over the  altar of her chapel at St James's now the French church He died in and was buried in St James'schurch  Vertue mentions another painter of the same surname whom he calls Michlaer Huysman of Mecklin and says he lived at Antwerp that he studied the Italians and painted landscapes in their manner which he adorned with buildings and animals He came to England and brought two large landscapes which he kept to shew what he could do for these he had frames richly carved by Gibbons and gave the latter two pictures in exchange In a sale in Vertue saw three small landscapes and figures by him of great merit On the revolution he returned to Antwerp and died there aged near  MICHAEL WRIGHT  Was born in Scotland but came to London at the age of or and proved no bad portraitpainter In he drew for Sir Robert Vyner a whole length of prince Rupert in armour with a large wig On the back he wrote the prince's titles at length and his own name thus Jo Michael Wright Lond pictor regius pinxit The earl of Oxford had a half length by him of Sir Edward Turner son of Sir Edward speaker of the House of Commons and chief baron On that he called himself Jos Michael Wright  Anglus  but on the portraits of the judges in Guildhall he wrote  Scotus  Sir Peter Lely was to have drawn these pictures but refusing to wait on the judges at their own chambers Wright got the business and received  l  for each piece Two of his most admired works were a highland laird and an Irish tory whole lengths in their proper dresses of which several  copies were made At Windsor is his large picture of John Lacy the comedian in three different characters Parson Scruple in the Cheats Sandy in the Taming of the Shrew and Monsieur de Vice in the Country Captain It was painted in and several copies taken from it He twice drew a duke of Cambridge son of king James  V catalogue  perhaps the two children who bore that title one of them is in the king's closet at St James's He painted too a cieling in the king's bedchamber at Whitehall  Wright attended Roger Palmer earl of Castlemain as steward of his houshold on his embassy to the Pope  It is well known with what neglect and indifference this Embassy was received by the Pope The Jesuits endeavoured to compensate for the Pontiff's contempt they treated Castlemaine in a most magnificent manner and all the arts were called in to demonstrate their zeal and compliment the bigotmonarch But the good fathers were unlucky in some of their inscriptions which furnished ample matter for ridicule particularly speaking of James they said  Alas Carolo addidit  and that the former might chuse an Embassador worthy of sending to heaven  He dispatched his brother  V Hist of England in two volumes Vol ii p th edition  and at his return published a pompous account of it first in Italian then in English He had been in Italy before At his return from the embassy he was mortified to find that Sir Godfrey Kneller had engrossed most of his business In upon a vacancy of the king's painter in Scotland he sollicited to succeed but a shopkeeper was preferredand in truth Wright had not much pretensions to favour in that reignyet as good as his fellowlabourer Tate who wrote panegyrics in Wright's edition of the embassy and yet was made Poet Laureat to king William  Orlandi mentions Wright "Michaele  Mr T Pelham of Stanmore has a small threequarters of Mrs Cleypole on which is written M Ritus Fec It is an emblematic piece the allegory of which is very obscure but highly finished There is another exactly the same except that it wants the painter's name at East Horsley formerly the seat of Sir Edward Nicholas  Rita Inglese notato nel Catalogo degli Academici di Roma nel anno " Wright left a son at Rome who was master of languages and died there He had a nephew too of his own name educated at Rome but who settled in Ireland where he had so much success that he gained  l  the first year and was always paid  l  a head Pooley and Magdalen Smith were there at the same time the latter and young Wright were rivals  Wright the uncle had a fine collection of gems and coins which were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane after his death which happened about the year in Jamesstreet Coventgarden He is buried in that church  EDMUND ASHFIELD  Graham    Scholar of Wright was well descended and painted both in oil and crayons in which he made great improvements for multiplying the tints He instructed Lutterel who added the invention of using crayons on copper plates Vertue had seen a head of Sir John Bennet afterwards lord Ossulston painted neatly by Ashfield tho' not in a good manner but at Burleigh is a small portrait of a lady Herbert by him highly finished and well painted  PETER ROESTRATEN  Graham    Was born at Harlem in and learned of Francis Hals whose daughter he married and whose manner for some time he followed but afterwards taking to still life painted little else Sir Peter Lely was very kind  Descamps says that Lely growing jealous of Roestraten proposed to him a partition of the art portraits were to be monopolized by Lely all other branches were to be ceded to Roestraten whose works were to be vaunted by Lely and for which by these means he received and guineas It is very improbable that an artist should relinquish that branch of his business which such a proposal told him he was most capable of executing  to him at his arrival in England and introduced him to king Charles but it does not appear that he was encouraged at court nothing of his hand appearing in the palaces or royal catalogues he found more countenance from the nobility There is a good picture by him at Kiveton the seat of the duke of Leeds one at Chatsworth and two were at lord Pomfret's At lord Radnor's fale in were three or four of his pictures particularly one representing the crown scepter and globe He was particularly fond of drawing wrought plate At the countess of Guildford's at Waldeshare in Kent are some of his works I have one well coloured containing an ivory tankard some figures in bronze and a medal of Charles II appendent to a blue ribband It is certain that he arrived early in this reign for he hurt his hip at the fire of London and went lame for the rest of his life Graham says that having promised to show a whole length by Francis Hals to a friend and the latter growing impatient he called his wife who was his master's daughter and  PETER ROESTRATEN  A Bannerman Sculp  Gerard Zoust  A Bannerman Sculp  said "there is a whole length by Hals" These are trifling circumstances but what more important happens in sedentary and retired lives They are at least as well worth relating as the witticisms of the old philosophers Roestraten died in in the same street with Michael Wright and was buried in the same church  GERARD SOEST called ZOUST  Was born in Westphalia and came to England probably before the restoration  Printed in Describing a picture of a husband and wife he says "It must be valued an ornament to the dyningroom being besides well known to be the art of Sowst's handywork and he a master of sufficiencie Graphice p At Welbeck is Lucy lady Hollis by him  for Sanderson mentions him as then of established reputation By what I have seen of his hand particularly his own head at Houghton he was an admirable master It is animated with truth and nature round bold yet highly finished His draperies were often of sattin in which he imitated the manner of Terburgh a Dutch painter of conversations but enlarged his ideas on seeing Vandyck He was inlisted among the rivals of Sir Peter Lely the number of them is sufficient honour to the latter Emulation seldom unites a whole profession against one unless he is clearly their superior Soest is commended by Vertue and Graham for his portraits of men Both confess that his taste was too Dutch and ungraceful and his humour too rough to please the softer sex The gentle manners of Sir Peter carried them all from his competitor Soest who was capricious slovenly and covetous often went to the door himself and if he was not in a humour to draw those who came to sit  or was employed in the meaner offices of his family he would act the servant and say his master was not at home his dress made him easily mistaken Once when he lived in Cursitor'salley he admitted two ladies but quitted the house himselfHis wife was obliged to say that since he could not please the ladies he would draw no more of them Greenhill carried  Of this person I find no other account  Wildt the painter to Soest who then lived at the corner house in Holbournrow and he showed them a man and horse large as life on which he was then at work out of humour with the public and the fairer half of it In Jervase's sale was a portrait of Mr John Norris by Soest which Jervase esteemed so much that he copied it more than once and even imitated it in his first pictures On the back was written but that was a mistake Soest died in Feb I have a head by him I believe of Griffiere it has a mantle of purple sattin admirably coloured At the Royal Society is a head of Dr John Wallis at Draper'shall Sheldon

Vertue saw too a small oval painted on paper and pasted on board the portrait of a Mr Thompson Soest was not only an able master himself but formed Mr Riley  Reader  Another scholar of Soest was son of a clergyman and born at Maidstone in Kent He lived sometime at a nobleman's in the west of England and at last died poor in the Charterhouse  JOHN LOTEN  A Dutch landscapepainter lived here long and painted much chiefly glades dark oaken groves landstorms and waterfalls and in Swisserland where he resided too he drew many views of the Alps He died in London about In king James's catalogue where are mentioned three of his landscapes he is called Loaton except this little notice all the rest is taken from Graham as are the three next articles entirely  THOMAS MANBY  An English landscapepainter who had studied in Italy from whence he brought a collection of pictures that were sold in the Banquettinghouse He lived ten years after the preceding  NICHOLAS BYER  Born at Dronthem in Norway painted both history and portraits He was employed by Sir William Temple for three or four years at his house at Shene near Richmond where he died All that Graham knew remarkable relating to him was that he was the first man buried in St Clement's Danes after it was rebuilt which had been founded by his countrymen  ADAM COLONI  Of Roterdam lived many years in England and was famous for small figures countrywakes cattle firepieces c He copied many pictures of Bassan particularly those in the royal collection He died in London at the age of and was buried in St Martin's  His son Henry Adrian Coloni was instructed by his father and by his brotherinlaw Vandiest and drew well He sometimes painted in the landscapes of the latter and imitated Salvator Rosa He was buried near his father in at the age of  JOHN GRIFFIERE  An agreable painter called the gentleman of Utrecht was born at Amsterdam in and placed apprentice to a carpenter a profession not at all suiting his inclination He knew he did not like to be a carpenter but had not discovered his own bent He quitted his master and was put to school but becoming acquainted with a lad  who was learning to paint earthenware young Griffiere was struck with the science tho' in so rude a form and passed his time in assisting his friend instead of going to school yet returning regularly at night as if he had been there This deception however could not long impose on his father who prudently yielded to the force of the boy's genius but while he gratified it hoped to secure him a profession and bound him to the same master with his friend the tylepainter Griffiere improved so much even in that coarse school that he was placed with a painter of flowers and then instructed by one Roland Rogman whose landscapes were esteemed He received occasional lessons too from Adrian Vandevelde Ruisdale and Rembrant whose peculiarity of style and facility of glory acquired rather by a bold trick of extravagant chiaro scuro than by genius captivated the young painter and tempted him to pursue that manner But Rogman dissuaded him and Griffiere tho' often indulging his taste seems to have been fixed by his master to landscapes which he executed with richness and neat colouring and enlivened with small figures cattle and buildings  When he quitted Rogman and Utrecht he went to Roterdam and soon after the fire of London came to England married and settled here received some instructions from Loten but easily excelled him He drew some views of London Italian ruins and prospects on the Rhine Such mixed scenes of rivers and rich country were his favorite subjects He bought a yatch embarked with his family and his pencils and passed his whole time on the Thames between Windsor Greenwich Gravesend c Besides these views he excelled in copying Italian and Flemish masters particularly Polenburgh Teniers Hondecooter Rembrandt and Ruysdale  After staying here many years he sailed in his own yatch to Roterdam but being tempted by a pilot who was coming to England suddenly embarked again for this country but was shipwrecked and lost his whole cargo except a little gold which his daughter had wrapped in a leathern girdle He remained in Holland ten or twelve years and returning to England struck upon a sandbank where he was eight days before he could get off This new calamity cured him of his passion for living on the water He took a house in Millbank where he lived several years and died in aged above  His pictures were sold in Coventgarden after his death with a collection by Italian and Flemish masters brought from Holland by his son Robert Among the father's paintings were some in imitation of the different manners of Elsheimer Polenburg Poussin Wouverman Berghem Titian Salvator Rosa Gerard Dou Bassan Guido and Vanderwerffe In the same catalogue is mentioned a piece in watercolours by Polenburg  In lord Orford's collection are two pretty pictures by him a seaport and a landscape He etched some small plates of birds and beasts from drawings of Barlow and five large halfsheet plates of birds in a set of twelve the other seven were done by Fr Place  Robert Griffiere his son born in England was bred under his father and made good progress in the art He was in Ireland when his father was shipwrecked and going to him in Holland imitated his manner of painting and that of Sachtleven John Griffiere a good copyist of Claud Lorrain and who died in Pallmall a few years ago was I believe the younger son of old Griffiere  GERARD EDEMA  Born according to Vertue in Friesland Graham says at Amsterdam  was scholar of Everding whose manner he followed and of whom there is a small book of mountainous prospects containing some plates Edema came to England about and made voyages both to Norway and Newfoundland to collect subjects for his pictures among those wildnesses of nature he delighting in rocky views falls of water and scenes of horrour For figures and buildings he had no talent and where he wanted them was assisted by Wyck The latter Vandevelde and Edema lived some time at MountEdgcumbe with Sir Richard grandfather of the present lord Edgcumbe and painted several views of the mount in concert which are now in a manner decayed Edema's temper was not so unsociable as his genius he loved the bottle and died of it at Richmond about the year Graham says in the th year of his age which probably is a mistake if he came to England in he could not have learnt much of Everding if he quitted his school at ten years old  THOMAS STEVENSON  Scholar of Aggas  Aggas whom I have mentioned in the first volume p was little more than a scenepainter for which reason I do not give him a separate article here All the account we have of him is from Graham  who painted landscape in oil figures and architecture in distemper The latter is only a dignified expression used by Graham for scene painting even in which kind he owns Stevenson's works grew despised The designs for the pageant called Goldsmith's Jubilee on the mayoralty of Sir Robert Vyner were given by this man  PHILIP DUVAL  A French man studied under Le Brun and afterwards in Italy the Venetian school He came to England and painted several pictures One for the famous Mrs Stuart duchess of Richmond represented Venus receiving armour from Vulcan for her son The headdress of the goddess her bracelets and the Cupids had more the air of Versailles than Latium On the anvil was the painter's name and the date Notwithstanding the good breeding of his pencil Duval was unsuccessful but Mr Boyle finding in him some knowledge of chymistry in which he had hurt his small fortune generously allowed him an annuity of  l  On the death of his patron Duval fell into great indigence and at last became disordered in his senses He was buried at St Martin's about  EDWARD HAWKER  Succeeded Sir Peter Lely in his house not in his reputation He painted a whole length of the duke of Grafton from which there is a print and a head of Sir Dudley North was a poor knight of Windsor and was living in aged fourscore The reader must excuse such brief or trifling articles This work is but an essay towards the history of our arts All kind of notices are inserted to lead to farther discoveries and if a nobler compendium shall be formed I willingly resign such minutes to oblivion  Sir JOHN GAWDIE  Born in was deaf and dumb but compensated part of these  misfortunes by a talent for painting in which he was not unsuccessful He had learned of Lely intending it for his profession but on the death of his elder brother only continued it for his amusement  FLESSIERE  Another obscure painter mentioned by Vertue and a framemaker too lived in the Strand near the Fountaintavern yet probably was not a very bad performer as a large piece of fruit painted by him was thought worthy of a place in Sir Peter Lely's collection  BENEDETTO GENARO  Nephew and disciple of Guercino and if that is much merit resembling him in his works He imitated his uncle's extravagantly dark shades caught the roundness of his flesh but with a disagreable lividness and possessed at least as much grace and dignity He came to England and was one of Charles's painters In king James's catalogue are mentioned twelve of his hand most of them I believe are still in the royal palaces four are at Windsor At Chatsworth are three by him and Lot and his daughters at Coudray His Hercules and Deianira was sold at Streater's sale for  l  He was born in and died in It is said that he had a mistress of whom he was jealous and whom he would not suffer the king to see  GASPAR NETSCHER  he was disciple of Terburg who Descamps and the French author that I shall mention presently say was in England and the former adds that he received immense prices for his works and that he twice drew king William III However his stay here was certainly short and as I cannot point out any of his works it is not worth while to give him a separate article His life may be seen in the authors I quote Teniers who according to the same writers was here too came only to buy pictures and therefore belongs still less to this catalogue    painted small portraits in oil He was invited to England by Sir  William Temple and recommended to the king but  The French author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres affirms that he never was here being apprehensive of the tumult of a court and that he compounded with the king by sending him several pictures p One would think that Charles had invited Netscher to his parties of pleasure or to be a minister The solitude of a painter's life is little disturbed by working for a court If the researches of Vertue were not more to be depended on than this inaccurate writer the portraits of lord Berkeley and his lady would turn the ballance in his favour Did Netscher send them for presents to the king I don't mean in general to detract from the merits of this writer he seems to have understood the profession and is particularly valuable for having collected so many portraits of artists and for giving lists of engravers after their pictures His work consists of three volumes quarto  staid not long here Vertue mentions five of his pictures one a lady and a dog with his name to it another of a lady her hands joined oval on copper the third lord Berkeley of Stratton his lady and a servant in one piece dated The others small ovals on copper of king William and queen Mary painted just before the revolution in the collection of the duke of Portland Netscher died of the gravel and gout in  JACOB PEN  A Dutch painter of history commended by Graham There is a St Luke by him in Painter'shall He died about  SUNMAN  Of the same country with the preceding came to England in the reign of Charles II and got into good business after the death of Sir Peter Lely but having drawn the king with less applause than Riley he was disgusted and retired to Oxford where he was employed by the University and painted for them the large pictures of their founders now in the picturegallery He drew dean Fell father of the bishop and Mr William Adams son of him who published the Villare Anglicanum In termtime Sunman went constantly to Oxford the rest of the year he passed in London and died at his house in Gerardstreet about  SHEPHARD  An English artist of whom I can find no record but that he lived in this reign near the Royalexchange painted Thom Killigrew with his dog now at lord Godolphin's and retired into Yorkshire where he died  STEINER  A Swiss scholar of one Warner whose manner he imitated was  also an architect Standing on the walls at the seige of Vienna he was wounded in the knee The latter part of his time he lived in England and died at Mortlack  PETER STOOP  A Fleming was settled with his family at Lisbon from whence they followed Catherine of Portugal to England Peter painted battles huntings processions c and his brothers Roderigo and Theodore engraved them If the pictures were equal to the plates from them which are extremely in the manner of Della Bella Peter was an artist of great merit Graham says so but that his reputation declined on the arrival of Wyck Stoop was employed by one Doily a dealer in pictures stuffs c and gave some instructions in painting to Johnson that admirable old comedian the most natural and of the least gesticulation I ever knew so famous for playing the gravedigger in Hamlet Morose Noll Bluff Bishop Gardiner and a few other parts and from whom Vertue received this account Stoop lived in Durhamyard and when an aged man retired to Flanders about where he died eight years afterwards Vertue does not say directly that the other two were brothers of Stoop on the contrary he confounds Roderigo with Peter but I conclude they were his brothers or sons from the prints etched by them about the very time of Peter's arrival in England They are a set of eight plates containing the public entry of admiral Sandwich into Lisbon and all the circumstances of the queen's departure arrival and entries at Whitehall and Hamptoncourt I have never been able to meet but with two of them one the entry of the earl is dedicated to him by  Theodore Stoop ipsius regiae majestatis pictor and is the only one to which Vertue mentions the name of Theodore The other in my possession is the queen's arrival at Hamptoncourt but the name is wanting Vertue describes besides a picture seven feet wide and two high containing the king's cavalcade through the gates of the city the day before his coronation but printed in He says not where he saw it but calls the painter Roderigo Stoop as he does the engraver of the rest of the abovementioned plates It is not impossible but Peter might have assumed the Portuguese name of Roderigo at Lisbon Some of the plates among Hollar's to Ogleby's Aesop were done by the same person but very poorly  WAGGONER  Another unknown name by whom there is a view of the fire of London in Painter'shall  There was another obscure painter among others who have not come to my knowledge called Bernart who in painted the portraits of Sir Gervase and Lady Elizabeth Pierpoint now at the Hoo in Hertfordshire the seat of Thomas Brand Esq  ALEXANDER SOUVILLE  A Frenchman as little known as the preceding and discovered only by Vertue from a memorandum in the accountbooks at the Temple  "Oct The eight figures on the northend of the paperbuildings in the King'sbenchwalks in the Innertemple were painted by Monsieur Alexander Souville"  WILLIAM VANDEVELDE  Distinguished from his more famous son of the same name by the appellation of  the Old  was born at Leyden in and learned to paint ships by a previous turn to navigation It was not much to his honour that he conducted the English fleet as is said to burn Schelling Charles II had received him and his son with great marks of favour it was pushing his gratitude too far to serve the king against his own country Dr Rawlinson the Antiquarian gave Vertue a copy of the following privyseal purchased among the papers of secretary Pepy's  "Charles the second by the grace of God c to our dear cousin prince Rupert and the rest of our commissioners for executing the place of lord highadmiral of England greeting Whereas wee have thought fitt to allow the salary of one hundred pounds per annum unto William Vandevelde the elder for taking and making draughts of seafights and the like salary of one hundred pounds per annum unto William Vandevelde the younger for putting the said draughts into colours for our particular use our will and pleasure is and wee do hereby authorize and require you to issue your orders for the present and future establishment of the said salaries to the aforesaid William Vandevelde the elder and William Vandevelde the younger to be paid unto them and either of them during our pleasure and for so doing these our letters shall be your sufficient warrant and discharge Given under our privyseal at our pallace of Westminster the th day of February in the th year of our reign"  The father who was a very able master painted chiefly in black and white and latterly always put the date on his works He was buried in St James'schurch on the gravestone is this inscription  WILLIAM VANDE VELDE▪ Jun  r    Kneller pinx TChambars sculp  "Mr William Vandevelde senior late painter of seafights to their majesties king Charles II and king James dyed "  William Vandevelde the son was the greatest man that has appeared in this branch of painting the palm is not less disputed with Raphael for history than with Vandevelde for seapieces Annibal Caracci and Mr Scott have not surpassed those chieftains William was born at Amsterdam in and wanted no master but his father till the latter came to England then for a short time he was placed with Simon de Vlieger an admired shippainter of that time but whose name is only preserved now by being united to his disciple's Young William was soon demanded by his father and graciously entertained by the king to whose particular inclination his genius was adapted William I suppose lived chiefly with his father at Greenwich who had chosen that residence as suited to the subjects he wanted In king James's collection were eighteen pieces of the father and son several are at Hamptoncourt and at Hinchinbrook At Buckinghamhouse was a view of  Vandevelde by order of the Duke of York attended the engagement in a small vessel  Solebayfight by the former with a long inscription But the best chosen collection of these masters is in a chamber at Mr Skinner's in Cliffordstreet Burlingtongardens assembled at great prices by the late Mr Walker Vandevelde the son having painted the junction of English and French fleets at the Nore whither king Charles went to view them and where he was represented going on board his own yatch two commissioners of the Admiralty agreed to beg it of the king to cut it in two and each to take a part The painter in whose presence they concluded this wise treaty took away the picture and concealed it till the king's death when he offered it to  Bullfinch the printseller from whom Vertue had the story for fourscore pounds Bullfinch took time to consider and returning to the purchase found the picture sold for guineas Afterwards it was in the possession of Mr Stone a merchant retired into Oxfordshire  William the younger died in as appears by this inscription under his print Gulielmus Vanden Velde junior navium prospectuum marinarum pictor et ob singularem in illâ arte peritiam à Carolo and Jacobo do Magnae Britanniae regibus annuâ mercede donatus Obiit Apr A D aet suae  William the elder had a brother named Cornelius  The anonymous author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres mentions three other Vandeveldes Adrian who he ignorantly says was  le plus connu  was no relation of the others and John an engraver and Isaiah a battlepainter both brothers of the first William as well as this Cornelius p  who like him painted shipping in black and white was employed by king Charles and had a salary  The younger William left a son a painter too of the same style and who made good copies from his father's works but was otherwise no considerable performer He went to Holland and died there He had a sister who was first married to Simon Du Bois whom I shall mention hereafter and then to Mr Burgess She had the portraits of her grandfather and father by Sir Godfrey Kneller of her brother by Wissing and of her great uncle Cornelius  JOHN VOSTERMAN  Graham calls him F de Vosterman    Of Bommel son of a portraitpainter and disciple of Sachtleven was  WILLIAM WISSING  AWalker sculp  t    a neat and excellent painter of small landscapes in oil as may be seen by two views of Windsor still in the gallery there After the rapid conquests of the French in he removed from Utrecht to Nimeguen and pleasing the marquis de Bethune was made his majordomo employed to purchase pictures and carried by him to France from whence he passed into England and painted for king Charles a chimneypiece at Whitehall and a few other things  He painted a view of Sterlingcastle the figures by Wyck from whence we may conclude that they took a journey to Scotland  but demanding extravagant prices as and  l  for his pictures he had not many commissions from court and being as vain in his expence as of his works he grew into debt and was arrested He sued in vain to the king for delivery his countrymen freed him by a contribution Sir William Soames being sent embassador to Constantinople by James II Vosterman accompanied him intending to paint the delights of that situation but Sir William dying on the road it is not certain what became of the painter it is said that before his departure from England he had been invited to Poland by his old patron the marquis de Bethune and probably went thither on the death of the embassador  Francisco Milé a landscape painter of Antwerp was here towards the end of Charles's reign but probably staid not long    WILLIAM WISSING  Was born at Amsterdam and bred under Dodaens an historic painter of the Hague from whence Wissing passed into France contracted  the furbelowed style of that country and age and came into England where at least he learned it in it's perfection from Sir Peter Lely for whom he worked and after whose death he grew into fashion He drew all the royal family and particularly the duke of Monmouth several times which ingratiated him with the king and the ladies Sir Godfrey Kneller then the rising genius was a formidable rival but death put an end to the contest in the thirtyfirst year of Wissing's age who deceased at Burleigh the lord Exeter's in He was buried at the expence of that earl in St Martin's Stamford where against a pillar in the middle isle of the church is a monumental table to his memory the inscription may be seen in Graham There are several prints from his works particularly one of queen Catherine with a dog Prior  Prior early in his life was patronized by that noble family and by his pleasing verses has added celebrity to that venerable palace sacred by the memory of Burleigh and ornamented with a profusion of Carlo Maratti's and Luca Jordano's works  wrote a poem on the last picture he painted A mezzotinto of Wissing is thus inscribed Gulielmus Wissingus inter pictores sui saeculi celeberrimos nulli secundus artis suae non exiguum decus ornamentum immodicis brevis est aetas  ADRIAN HENNY or HENNIN  One of the last painters who arrived in the reign of Charles II little is known of him but that having been two years in France he adopted the manner of Gaspar Poussin Vertue thought he came in if so the titleplate to a history of Oxford designed by him and engraved by White in must have been done antecedent to his arrival  He painted much at Eythorp the seat of Dormer lord Carnarvon now of Sir William Stanhope and died here in  HERBERT TUER  Was second son of Theophilus Tuer by Catherine neice of Mr George Herbert the poet his grandfather and greatgrandfather were vicars the former of Elsenham in Essex the latter of Sabridgeworth in Hertfordshire towards the latter end of Elizabeth Herbert who received his name from his maternal uncle withdrew with his youngest brother Theophilus into Holland after the death of Charles st The latter followed arms Herbert applied to painting and made good progress in portraits as appears by some small ones of himself and family now in England where however they are little known A print of Sir Lionel Jenkins probably drawn at Nimeguen is from a picture by Tuer He married two wives Mary Van Gameren daughter of a procurer of Utrecht and Elizabeth Van Heymenbergh John his son by the first was resident at Nimeguen with his motherinlaw in at which time Herbert was dead It is believed that he died at Utrecht where in the Painter'shall is said to be a head finely coloured by him  TEMPESTA and TOMASO  Two painters who worked at Wilton painting cielings and pannels of rooms Tempesta was I believe son of a wellknown painter of the same name Tomaso and a brother of his who was employed at Wilton too were brought over by Sir Charles Cotterel for which reason  I have placed them here tho' I do not know exactly whether their performances were not dated a little later than this period I find no other mention of them  Lord Delawar has a picture of Apollo and the Muses evidently a copy of Rubens in one corner is the painter's name J Tomaso  or Tempesta in England There are at Wilton two pieces of tapestry after the Cartoons of Raphael with the workman's name Stephen Mayn and his arms a cross of St George probably executed long before this period and perhaps not in England  If our painters in oil were not of the first rate during the period I have been describing in watercolours that reign has the highest pretensions  SAMUEL COOPER  Owed great part of his merit to the works of Vandyck and yet may be called an original genius as he was the first who gave the strength and freedom of oil to miniature Oliver's works are touched and retouched with such careful fidelity that you cannot help perceiving they are nature in the abstract Cooper's are so bold that they seem perfect nature only of a less standard Magnify the former they are still diminutively conceived if a glass could expand Cooper's pictures to the size of Vandyck's they would appear to have been painted for that proportion If his portrait of  This fine head is in the possession of the lady Frankland widow of Sir Thomas a descendent of Cromwell The body is unfinished Vertue engraved it as he did another in profile in the collection of the duke of Devonshire  Cromwell could be so enlarged I don't know but Vandyck would appear less great by the comparison To make it fairly one must not measure the Fleming by his most admired  SAMUEL COOPER  Ipse pinx TChambars sculp  piece cardinal Bentivoglio The quick finesse of eye in a florid Italian writer was not a subject equal to the protector but it would be an amusing trial to balance Cooper's Oliver and Vandyck's lord Strafford To trace the lineaments of equal ambition equal intrepidity equal art equal presumption and to compare the skill of the masters in representing the one exalted to the height of his hopes yet perplexed with a command he could scarce hold did not dare to relinquish and yet dared to exert the other dashed in his career willing to avoid the precipice searching all the recesses of so great a soul to break his fall and yet ready to mount the scaffold with more dignity than the other ascended the throne This parallel is not a picture drawn by fancy if the artists had worked in competition they could not have approached nigher to the points of view in which I have traced the characters of their heroes  Cooper with so much merit had two defects His skill was confined to a meer head his drawing even of the neck and shoulders so incorrect and untoward that it seems to account for the numbers of his works unfinished It looks as if he was sensible how small a way his talent extended This very poverty accounts for the other his want of grace A signal deficience in a painter of portraitsyet how seldom possessed Bounded as their province is to a few tame attitudes how grace attones for want of action Cooper content like his countrymen with the good sense of truth neglected to make truth engaging Grace in painting seems peculiar to Italy The Flemings and the French run into opposite extremes The first never approach the line the latter exceed it and catch at most but a lesser species of it the genteel which if I were to define I should call familiar grace as grace seems an amiable degree of majesty Cooper's  women like his model Vandyck's are seldom very handsome It is Lely alone that excuses the galantries of Charles II He painted an apology for that Asiatic court  The anecdotes of Cooper's life are few nor does it signify his works are his history He was born in and instructed with his brother Alexander by their uncle Hoskins who says Graham was jealous of him and whom he soon surpassed The variety of tints that he introduced the clearness of his carnations and loose management of hair exceed his uncle though in the last Hoskins had great merit too The author I have just quoted mentions another capital work of Cooper the portrait of one Swingfield which recommended the artist to the court of France where he painted several pieces larger than his usual size and for which his widow received a pension during her life He lived long in France and Holland and dying in London May  Mr Willett in Thamesstreet has a head of a young man in armour of the family of Deane in Suffolk not equal to most of Cooper's works My reason for mentioning it is it's being set in an enamelled case on the outsides of which are two beautifull Madonnas each with the child freely painted in a light style within is likewise an enamelled landscape The picture is dated This collated with my enamel of general Fairfax seems to corroborate my opinion that Bordier by whom I take these enamels to be painted remained here after Petitot left England  at the age of was buried in Pancraschurch where is a monument for him The inscription is in Graham who adds that he had great skill in music and played well on the lute  His works are too many to be enumerated seven or eight are in queen Caroline's closet at Kensington one of them a head of Moncke is capital but unfinished Lord Oxford had a head of  GIBSON  M  RS  GIBSON  AWalker sculp  archbishop Sheldon and the bust of lord chancellor Shaftsbury on his monument by Rysbrach was taken from a picture of Cooper  It is an anecdote little known I believe and too trifling but for such a work as this that Pope's mother was sister of Cooper's wife Lord Carleton had a portrait of Cooper in crayons which Mrs Pope said was not very like and which descending to lord Burlington was given by his lordship to Kent It was painted by one Jackson a relation of Cooper of whom I know nothing more and who I suppose drew another head of Cooper in crayons in queen Caroline's closet said to be painted by himself but I find no account of his essays in that way He did once attempt oil as Murray the painter told Vertue and added that Hayles thereupon applied to miniature which he threatened to continue unless Cooper desisted from oil which he didbut such menaces do not frighten much unless seconded by want of success Among Orinda's poems is one to Cooper on drawing her friend Lucasia's picture in  RICHARD GIBSON  The Dwarf being page to a lady at Mortlack was placed by her with Francesco Cleyne to learn to draw in which he succeeded perfecting himself by copying the works of Sir Peter Lely who drew Gibson's picture leaning on a bust another evidence of Sir Peter being here before the restoration It was in the possession of Mr Rose  He married Gibson's daughter a paintress that will be mentioned hereafter  the jeweller who had another head of the dwarf by Dobson and his little wife in black by Lely This diminutive couple were married in the presence of Charles I and his queen who bespoke  a diamond ring for the bride but the troubles coming on she never received it Her  See notes to Fenton's Waller  name was Anne Shepherd The little pair were each three feet ten inches high Waller has celebrated their nuptials in one of his prettiest poems The husband was page to the king and had already attained such excellence that a picture of the man and lost sheep painted by him and much admired by the king was the cause of Vanderdort's death as we have seen in the preceeding volume Thomas  Gibson had been patronized by Philip earl of Pembroke and painted Cromwell's picture several times Mrs Gibson is represented by Vandyck in the picture with the duchess of Richmond at Wilton  earl of Pembroke had the portraits of the dwarfs hand in hand by Sir Peter Lely and exchanging it for another picture it fell into the possession of Cock the auctioneer who sold it to Mr Gibson the painter in It was painted in the style of Vandyck Mr  Mr W Hamilton Envoy to Naples has a drawing of Gibson by Vandyck  Rose had another small piece of the dwarf and his master Francesco Cleyne in green habits as archers with bows and arrows and he had preserved Gibson's bow who was fond of archery Gibson taught queen Anne to draw and went to Holland to instruct her sister the princess of Orange The small couple had nine children five of which lived to maturity and were of a proper size Richard the father died in the th year of his age and was buried  From the register Richard Gibson died July  at Coventgarden his little widow lived till when she was years old  WILLIAM GIBSON  Nephew of the preceding was taught by him and Sir Peter Lely and  copied the latter happily but chiefly practiced miniature He bought great part of Sir Peter's collection and added much to it Dying of a lethargy in at the age of he was buried at Richmond as was  EDWARD GIBSON  I suppose son of the dwarf This young man began with painting portraits in oil but changed that manner for crayons His own picture done by himself in this way was at Tarthall Edward died at the age of  JOHN DIXON  Scholar of Sir Peter Lely painted both in miniature and crayons but mostly the former In the latter was his own head In watercolours there are great numbers of his works above sixty were in lord Oxford's collection both portraits and histories particularly Diana and her Nymphs bathing after Polenburg and a sleeping Venus Cupids and a Satyr These were his best works He was keeper of the king's picturecloset and in was concerned in a bubble Lottery The whole sum was to be  l  divided into prizes the highest prize in money  l  the lowest  l  One prize a collection of limnings he valued so highly that the person to whom it should fall might in lieu of it receive  l  each ticket twenty shillings Queen Anne then princess was an adventurer This affair turned out ill and Dixon falling into debt removed for security from St Martin'slane where he lived to the  King'sbenchwalks in the Temple and latterly to a small estate he had at Thwaite near Bungay in Suffolk where he died about and where his widow and children were living in Dixon adds Vertue once bought a picture for a trifle at a broker's which he sold to the duke of Devonshire for  l  but does not specify the hand or subject  ALEXANDER MARSHAL  Another performer in watercolonrs who painted on velom a book of Mr Tradescant's  V Museum Tradescantianum It is a small book containing a catalogue of the rarities in that collection at Lambeth with two prints by Hollar of the father and son  choicest flowers and plants At Dr Friend's Vertue saw several pretty large pieces after Vandyck the flesh painted very carefully He mentions too one Joshua Marshall a sculptor who in executed the monument of Baptist lord Noel and his lady in Gloucestershire  WILLIAM HASSEL  Another painter known only to the industry of Mr Vertue who saw an oval miniature of a Scotch gentleman which being engraved by P Vanderbank was falsely inscribed  lord Marr  The mark on the picture was W H This says Vertue I think was William Hassel Since the first edition I am informed that Mr Hassel not only painted in miniature but in oil in which way he executed an oval head of Mr Hughes author of the seige of Damascus who joined the sister arts and painted several small pieces in watercolours for his  M  RS  BEALE her Son CHARLES  Mary Beale pinx TChambars sc  amusement That seraphic dame Mrs Rowe also painted A gentleman from whom I received these notices has a bust

SNELLING  A gentleman who painted in miniature and that being very galant seldom but for ladies In Mr Rose's sale was a head of Snelling by Cooper finely painted but the hands and drapery poor Mr Beal mentious him in one of his pocketbooks  See the next article  for sending presents of colours to his wife in and and that in Mr Snelling offered him thirty guineas for a Venus and Cupid after Rottenhamer for which he asked forty guineas and was worth fifty I do not know whether this person was related to Thomas Snelling a poet recorded in Wood's Athenae vol ii p  MARY BEALE  Was daughter of Mr Cradock minister of Walton  Where Mr Beale afterwards erected a monument for him  upon Thames and learned the rudiments of painting from Sir Peter Lely and had some instructions as Vertue thought from Walker She painted in oil watercolours and crayons and had much business her portraits were in the Italian style which she acquired by copying several pictures and drawings from Sir Peter Lely's and the royal collections  Her master was supposed to have had a tender attachment to her but as he was reserved in communicating to her all the resources of his pencil it probably was a galant passion rather than a successful one Dr Woodfall wrote several poems to her honour under the name of Belesia but the fullest history of her life and works was recorded by her own husband who in small almanacpocketbooks minuted down almost daily accounts of whatever related to himself his business and his wife's pictures Of these almanacs there were above thirty which with most of Mr Beale's papers came into the hands of Carter colourman to whom Beale bequeathed them Some were sold to Mr Brooke a clergyman His share Carter lent to a low painter whose goods being seized the pocketbooks were lost but seven of them a friend of Vertue's met with on a stall bought and lent to him Most of his extracts I shall now offer to the reader without apprehension of their being condemned as trifling or tiresome If they are so how will this whole work escape When one writes the lives of artists who in general were not very eminent their pocketbooks are as important as any part of their historyI shall use no farther apologyif even those that are lost should be regretted  "The first is April Mr Lely was here with Mr Gibson and Mr Skipwith to see us and commended very much her Mrs Beale's coppy after our Saviour praying in the garden c after Anto da Correggio her coppy in little after Endimion Porter his lady and three sons he commended extraordinarily and said to use his own words it was painted like Vandyke himself in little and that it was the best coppy he ever saw of Vandyke Also he very well liked her two coppyes in great of Mr Porter's little son Phil He  commended her other works coppyes and those from the life Both he and Mr Gibson both commended her works  "Mr Lely told me at the same time as he was most studiously looking at my bishop's picture of Vandyke's and I chanced to ask him how Sir Antony cou'd possibly divise to finish in one day a face that was so exceeding full of work and wrought up to so extraordinary a perfectionI believe said he he painted it over fourteen times And upon that he took occasion to speake of Mr Nicholas Laniere's picture of Sr Anto V D doing which said he Mr Laniere himself told me he satt seaven entire dayes for it to Sr Anto and that he painted upon it of all those seaven dayes both morning and afternoon and only intermitted the time they were at dinner And he said likewise that tho' Mr Laniere satt so often and so long for his picture that he was not permitted so much as once to see it till he had perfectly finished the face to his own satisfaction This was the picture which being show'd to king Charles the first caused him to give order that V Dyck shou'd be sent for over into England  This transcript should have preceded the former but I give them exactly as I find them in Vertue's extract  " Feb My worthy and kind Friend Dr Belk caused the excellent picture of Endimion Porter his lady and three sons altogether done by Sr Anto Vandyke to be brought to my house that my deare heart might have opportunity to study it and coppy what shee thought fitt of itt Also at the same time wee return'd Mrs Cheek's picture of Mr Lely's painting back to my lord Chamberlain  "Pink remaining in stock Sept Some parcells

Stillingfleet's Mr Crumholem's pictures  l  Mrs Beale had  l  for a head and  l  for a halflength in oil which was her most common method of painting  " Aug Dr Tillotson sat to Mr Lely about three hours for the picture he is doing for me this is the fourth time and I believe he will paint it at least touch it over again His manner in the painting of this picture this time especially seem'd strangely different both to myself and my dearest heart from his manner of painting the former pictures he did for us This wee thought was a more conceiled misterious scanty way of painting then the way he used formerly which wee both thought was a far more open and free and much more was to be observed and gain'd from seeing him paint then then my heart cou'd with her most carefull marking learn  I think it clear from this whole passage that what I have asserted in the text from Graham of Mrs Beale being scholar to Lely is a mistake of that writer Beale does not hint at iton the contrary they seem to have procured their friends to sit to Sir Peter that she might learn his method of colouringand Sir Peter seems to have been aware of the intention  from his  painting either this or Dr Cradock's picture of his doing for Dr Patrick  "Delivered to Mr Lely one ounce of Ultramarine at  l    s  one ounce towards payment for Dr Tillotson's picture for me  " Sept I carryd my two boys

Was sculptor to the crown before Gibbons and had succeeded his uncle one Philips There is a poor mezzotinto of Emmett by himself  CAIUS GABRIEL CIBBER or CIBERT  Son of a cabinetmaker to the king of Denmark was born at Flensburg in the duchy of Holstein and discovering a talent for sculpture was sent at the king's expence to Rome More of his early history is not known He came to England not long before the Restoration and worked for John Stone son of Nicholas who going to Holland and being seized with a palsey Cibber his foreman was sent to conduct him home We are as much in the dark as to the rest of his life that singularlypleasing biographer his son who has dignified so many trifling Anecdotes of players by the expressive energy of his style has recorded nothing of a father's life who had such merit in his profession I can only find that he was twice married and that by his second  CIBBER  ABannerman Sculp  wife descended from the ancient family of  By this alliance his children were kinsmen to William of Wickham and on that foundation one of them afterwards a fellow of Newcollege Oxford and remarkable for his wit was admitted of Winchestercollege in consideration of

Southamptonstreet facing Southamptonhouse Gabriel Cibber the statuary was carver to the king's closet and died about at the age of His son had a portrait of him by old Laroon with a medal in his hand I have one in watercolours with a pair of compasses by Christian Richter probably a copy from the former with a slight variation What is wanting in circumstances is more than compensated by his works The most capital are the two figures of melancholy and raving madness before the front of Bedlam The basreliefs  A description of them may be seen in the new account of London and the environs Vol v p  on two sides of the monument are by his hand too So are the fountain in Sohosquare and one of the fine vases at Hamptoncourt said to be done in competition with a foreigner who executed the other but nobody has told us which is Cibber's He carved most of the statues of kings round the Royalexchange as far as king Charles and that of Sir Thomas Gresham in the piazza beneath The first duke of Devonshire employed him much at Chatsworth where two sphinxes on large bases well executed and with ornaments in good taste are of his work and till very lately there was a statue of Neptune in a fountain still better He carved there several doorcases of alabaster with rich foliage and many ornaments in the chapel and on each side of the altar is a statue by him Faith and Hope the draperies have great  merit but the airs of the heads are not so good as that of the Neptune Cibber built the Danish church in London and was buried there himself with his second wife for whom a monument was erected in The son will be known as long as the Careless Husband and the Memoires of his own Life exist and so long the injustice of calling the figures at Bedlam  his brazen brainless brothers  and the peevish weakness of thrusting him into the Dunciad in the room of Theobald the proper hero will be notorious  FRANCIS DU SART  Of Hanau is mentioned in De Bie's Golden Cabinet who says he was employed by the king of England to adorn his palace with works in marble and models in clay and that he died in London It is uncertain whether this  king  was Charles the first or whether Du Sart came over and died soon after the Revolution  GRINLING  So he wrote his name himself and not  Grinlin  as it is on his print  GIBBONS  An original genius a citizen of nature consequently it is indifferent where she produced him When a man strikes out novelty from himself the place of his birth has little claim on his merit Some become great poets or great painters because their talents have capital models before their eyes An inventor is equally a master whether born in Italy or Lapland There is no instance of a man before Gibbons who gave to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers and  GRINLING GIBBONS  GKneller pinx TChambars sc  chained together the various productions of the elements with a free disorder natural to each species Vertue had received two different accounts of his birth from Murray the painter that he was born in Holland of English parents and came over at the age of nineteen from Stoakes relation of the Stones that his father was a Dutchman but that Gibbons himself was born in Spuralley in the Strand This is circumstantial and yet the former testimony seems most true as Gibbons is an English name and Grinling probably Dutch He afterwards lived added Stoakes in Belsavagecourt on Ludgatehill where he carved a pot of flowers which shook surprizingly with the motion of the coaches that passed by It is certain that he was employed by Betterton on the decorations of the Theatre in Dorsetgarden where he carved the capitals cornices and eagles He lived afterwards at Deptford in the same house with a musician where the beneficent and curious Mr Evelyn found and patronized them both This gentleman Sir Peter Lely and Bap May who was something of an architect himself recommended Gibbons to Charles II who though too indolent to search for genius and too indiscriminate in his bounty to confine it to merit was always pleased when it was brought home to him He gave the artist a place in the board of works and employed his hand on the ornaments of most taste in his palaces particularly at Windsor where in the chapel the simplicity of the carver's foliage at once sets off and atones for the glare of Verrio's paintings Gibbons in gratitude made a present of his own bust in wood to Mr Evelyn who kept it at his house in Doverstreet The piece that had struck so good a judge was a large carving in wood of St Stephen stoned long preserved in the sculptor's own house and afterwards purchased and placed by the duke of Chandos at Cannons  At Windsor too Gibbons whose art penetrated all materials carved that beautiful pedestal in marble for the equestrian  Under the statue is an engine for raising water contrived by Sir Samuel Morland alias Morley he was son of Sir Samuel Morland of Sulhamsted Banister in the county of Berkshire created a baronet by Charles II in consideration of services performed during the king's exile The son was a great mechanic and was presented with a gold medal and made Magister Mechanicorum by the king in He invented the drumcapstands for weighing heavy anchors and the speaking trumpet and other useful engines He died and was buried at Hammersmith in Middlesex There is a monument for the two wives of Sir Samuel Morland in Westminsterabbey His arms were sable a leopard's head jessant a fleur de lys or There is a print of the son by Lombart after Lely This Sir Samuel built a large room in his garden at

believe it of his hand There is great ease in the attitude and a classic simplicity Vertue met with an agreement signed by Gibbons himself for a statue of James II the price  l  half to be paid down on signing the agreement  l  more at the end of three months and the rest when the statue should be compleat and erected Annexed were receipts for the first  l  Aug The paymaster Tobias Rustat  One might ask whether Vertue did not in haste write James II for Charles II The statue of the latter at Chelseacollege is said to be the gift of this Rustat and one should doubt whether he paid for a statue of the king in his own gardenbut as Charles II permitted such an act of loyalty in the court at Windsor perhaps his brother was not more difficult I am the rather inclined to attribute the statue at Whitehall to Gibbons because I know no other artist of that time capable of it    Gibbons made a magnificent tomb for Baptist Noel Viscount Camden in the church of Exton in Rutlandshire it cost  l  is feet high and wide There are two figures of him and his lady and basreliefs of their children The same workman performed the wooden throne at Canterbury which cost  l  and was the donation

fowl over the chimney finely executed and over a closet door a pen not distinguishable from real feather When Gibbons had  finished his works in that palace he presented the duke with a point cravat a

the Grecian age of Cameos Selden one of his disciples and assistantsfor what one hand could execute such plenty of laborious productions lost his life in saving this carving when the seat was on fire The font in St James'schurch was the work of Gibbons  If these encomiums  Tate wrote a poem on the sight of a bust in marble of Gibbons  are exaggerated the works are extant to contradict me Let us now see how well qualified a man who vaunts his having been in England was to speak of Gibbons It is the author of the Abregè whom I have frequently mentioned "Les Anglois  Vol ii p  says he n'ont eu qu'un bon sculpteur nommè Gibbons mais il n'etoit pas excellent La figure de marbre de Charles II placêe au milieu de la bourse à Londres est de sa main" What would this author have said of him if he had wasted his art on ribbands  sand ringlets flowing in one blended stream from the laurel of Louis XIV to the tip of his horse's tail  This is litterally the case in the equestrian statue at Lyons    Gibbons died Aug d at his house in Bowstreet Coventgarden and in November of the following year his collection a very considerable one of pictures models c was sold by auction Among other things were two chimneypieces of his own work the one valued at  l  the other at his own bust in marble by himself but the wig and cravat extravagant and an original of Simon the engraver by Sir Peter Lely which had been much damaged by the fall of Gibbons's house  There are two different prints of Gibbons by Smith both fine the one with his wife after Closterman the other from a picture at Houghton by Sir Godfrey Kneller who has shown himself as great in that portrait as the man was who sat to him  Gibbons had several disciples and workmen Selden I have mentioned Watson assisted chiefly at Chatsworth where the boys and many of the ornaments in the chapel were executed by him Dievot of Brussels and Laurens of Mechlin were principal journeymen Vertue says they modelled and cast the statue I have mentioned in the Privygarden which confirms my conjecture of it's being the figure intended in the agreement If either of them  modelled  it and not Gibbons himself the true artist deserves to be known They both retired to their own country on the Revolution Laurens performed much both in statuary and in wood and grew rich Dievot lived till and died at Mechlin  LEWIS PAYNE  Engraved two fignet seals for Charles II to be used in Scotland by the duke of Lauderdale Dr Rawlinson had the original warrant for them signed by the king one was to have been in steel the other in silver At top was the

Norway and bred a silversmith He was driven by a storm on the coast of Scotland tho' intending for England He worked two years at Aberdeen for one Melvin a silversmith and arrived in London the third day of the Conflagration He had never attempted to engrave stones till settled in England He was confined in the Tower for four years on suspicion of engraving dies for coining but was released without a trial These imperfect notes are all I find relative to this Artist whom Mr Vertue calls Resin Senior whence and from it's more modern air I conclude the Mezzotinto exhibits his son who

which leaves nothing to be desired on this subject Yet in a work of such a nature as this men would be disappointed should they turn to it and receive no satisfaction They must be gratified though my province becomes little more than that of a meer transcriber  Sir Christopher Wren of an ancient family in the Bishoprick of Durham was son of a dean of Windsor and nephew of Matthew bishop successively of Hereford Norwich Ely He was born at London in and educated at Oxford His mathematical abilities unfolded themselves so early that by twenty he was elected professor of astronomy at Greshamcollege and eight years afterwards Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford His discoveries in philosophy mechanics c contributed to the reputation of the new established Royalsociety and his skill in architecture had raised his own name so high that in the first year of the Restoration he was appointed coadjutor to Sir John Denham surveyor of the works whom he succeeded in Three years before that he had visited France and unfortunately went no fartherthe great number of drawings  he made there from their buildings had but too visible influence on some of his ownbut it was so far lucky for Sir Christopher that Louis XIV had erected palaces only no churches St Paul's escaped but  I have been assured by a descendent of Sir Christopher that he gave another design for Hamptoncourt in a better taste which queen Mary wished to have had executed but was overruled  Hamptoncourt was sacrificed to the god of false taste In he was chosen president of the Royalsociety was in two parliaments was twice married had two sons and a daughter and died  Elkanah Settle published a funeral poem on him called Threnodia Apollinaris there is another in Latin in the Parentalia  in at the age of ninetyone having lived to see the completion of St Paul's a fabric and an event which one cannot wonder left such an impression of content on the mind of the good old man that being carried to see it once a year it seemed to recall a memory that was almost deadened to every other use He was buried under his own fabric with four words that comprehend his merit and his fame si quaeras monumentum circumspice  Besides from his works  He wrote a poem published in a collection at Oxford on the revival of Anne Green  in architecture which I am going to mention Wren is intitled to a place in this catalogue by his talent for design He drew a view of Windsor which was engraved by Hollar and eight or ten plates for Dr Willis's anatomy of the brain Vertue thinks they were engraved by Loggan He found out a speedy was of etching and was the inventor of drawing pictures by miscroscopic glasses and he says himself that he invented serpentinerivers  Parentalia p  His other discoveries  Among them is reckoned the invention of mezzotinto which some say he imparted to prince Rupert but the most common and cotemporary reports give the honour to the prince himself as will be seen in his article in the volume of Engravers  may be seen at large in the authors I have quoted His principal buildings were  The Library of Trinitycollege Cambridge and a piece of architecture opposite to it to disguise the irregularity of that end Over the library are four figures by Cibber  The Chapel of Pembrokehall  The Theatre at Oxford  He was consulted and advised some alterations in a plan of the Chapel at Trinitycollege Oxford This was not worth mentioning with regard to Sir Christopher but was necessary to introduce the name of Dr Aldrich who not only designed that Chapel but also the Church of Allsaints Oxford A circumstance we learn from the life of Dr Bathurst P p by the ingenious Mr Thomas Warton to whom the public has many obligations and the Editor of this work still greater  The Tower of St Dunstan'schurch attempted in the Gothic style with very poor success  The  I have been informed since the first edition of this work by Sir Christopher's descendent that the tower only of this Church as it is at present was designed by his grandfather A fire happened in the Church and the damaged parts were restored by one Francis Smith a mason in the town who had also executed the tower in which he made several mistakes  Church of St Mary at Warwick in the same manner but still worse Yet he was not always so wide of his mark  The great Campanile at Christchurch Oxford is noble and though not so light as a gothic architect would perhaps have formed it does  not disgrace the modern His want of taste in that ancient style is the best excuse for another fault the union of Grecian and Gothic The Ionic Colonade that crosses the inner quadrangle of Hamptoncourt is a glaring blemish by it's want of harmony with the rest of Wolsey's fabric Kent was on the point of repeating this incongruity in the same place in the late reign but was overruled by my father  Christchurchhospital London rebuilt and the old Cloyster repaired by him  St Marylebow The steeple is much admiredfor my part I never saw a beautiful modern steeple They are of Gothic origine and have frequently great merit either in the solid dignity of towers or in the airy form of taper spires When broken into unmeaning parts as those erected in later times are they are a pile of barbarous ugliness and deform the temples to which they are coupled Sir Christopher has shown how sensible he was of

for health and pressed  V Life of Sir Dudley North  Sir Christopher to have it  finished in a year The impropriety of the situation and the haste of the execution are some excuse for the architectbut Sir Christopher was not happy in all kind of buildings He had great abilities rather than taste When he has shewed the latter it was indeed to advantage The circular porticos and other parts of St Paul's are truly gracefull and so many great architects as were employed on St Peter's have not left it upon the whole a more perfect edifice than this work of a single mind The gawdiness of the Romish religion has given St Peter's one of it's chief advantages The excess of plainness in our cathedral disappoints the spectator after so rich an approach The late prince of Wales I have heard intended to introduce tombs into it and to begin with that of his grandfather Considering that Westminsterabbey is overstocked and that the most venerable monuments of antiquity are daily removed there to make room for modern a precedent that one should think would discourage even the moderns from dealing with the chapter St Paul's would afford a new theatre for statuaries to exert their geniusand the Abbey would still preserve it's general customers by new recruits of waxen puppets The towers of the last mentioned fabric and the proposed spire were designed by Sir Christopher  The Monument The architect's intention was to erect the statue of Charles II on the summit instead of that silly pot of flames but was overruled as he often was by very inferior judgments  The Theatre in Drurylane and the old Theatre in Salisburycourt The rest of his churches publications designs c may be seen at large in the Parentalia Among the latter was the mausoleum of Charles I It was curious piety in Charles II to erect a monument for the imaginary bones of Edward V and his brother and  to sink  l  actually given by parliament for a tomb for his father  Many drawings by Sir Christopher particularly for St Paul's were sold in his son's auction a few years ago  The medallists in this reign lie in a narrow compass but were not the worst Artists  The ROTIERS  Were a family of medallists The father a goldsmith and banker assisted Charles II with money during his exile in return for which the king promised if he was restored to employ his sons who were all gravers of seals and coins The Restoration happened and Charles discontent with the inimitable Simon who had served Cromwell and the Republic sent for Rotier's sons The two eldest John and Joseph arrived not entirely with their father's consent who wished to have them settle in France of which I suppose he was a native They were immediately placed in the mint and allowed a salary and a house where they soon grew rich being allowed  l  for each broad seal and gaining  l  a year by vending great numbers of medals abroad On their success Philip the third brother came over and worked for the government too He is the only one of the three though John was reckoned the best artist who has left his name  Unless a medal which I have mentioned in the second volume of this work p was executed by Norbert  or initials on any of our medals and he it was I believe who being in love with the fair Mrs Stuart duchess of Richmond  V Evelyn p and  represented her likeness under the form of Britannia on the reverse  of a large medal with the king's head Simon discontent with some reason at the preference of such inferior performers made the famous crownpiece which though it did not explode the others recovered his own salary and from that time he and his rivals lived amicably together It was more than they themselves did John had three sons the eldest of which he lost but James and Norbert being much employed by him their uncles grew jealous and left England Joseph going to France Philip to Flanders where each being entertained by the respective governments the three brothers were at the same time in the service of three kings of England France and Spain James Rotier being hurt by a fall from his horse and retiring to Bromley for the air caught cold and died Norbert and his father remained working for the crown till the Revolution when though offered to be continued in his post no sollicitation could prevail on John the father to work for king William This rendering him obnoxious and there being suspicions  There are many evidences that these and other suspicions were not illfounded Rotier was believed to have both coined and furnished dies for coining money I suppose with the stamp and for the service of king James Smith in his Memoirs of secret service mentions his information and discovery of the dies in the Tower being conveyed away by one Hewet and others by the help of Mr Rotier and that they were found at Mr Vernon's in January In the Journals of the House of Commons vol xi p is a report from the Committee to examine what dies were gone out of the Tower and by what means From that report it appears that Rotier wou'd not suffer captain Harris the patentofficer to enter the house where the dies were kept that one Ware made a press for White then under sentence of condemnation who told Ware he cou'd have dies from Rotier when he pleased that Rotier who was a Catholic kept an Irish papist in his house and that the lord Lucas governor of the Tower had complained that the Tower was not safe while so many papists were entertained in Rotier's house It appears too from the Journal of Henry Earl of Clarendon that when his lordship who by his own account had dealt with the most disaffected persons was committed to the Tower in he asked lord Lucas to let Rotier come to him which the governor would not suffer him to do alone because he was a papistLord Clarendon most probably had another reason for desiring Rotier's company  of his carrying on a treasonable  correspondence guards were placed round his house in the Tower and lord Lucas who commanded there made him so uneasy that he was glad to quit his habitation He was rich and very infirm labouring under the stone and gravel additional reasons for his retiring He took a house in Redlionsquare Norbert less difficult executed some things for the government particularly  He and his brother James struck a medal of king William alone in which was advertised with another by them of Charles st  as Vertue thinks the coronation medal for William and Mary and some dies for the copper money On the proofs were the king's and queen's heads on different sides with a rose a ship c but in it was resolved that the heads should be coupled and Britannia be on the reverse Hence arose new matter of complaintSome penetrating eyes thought they discovered a Satyr's head  I remember such a vision about the first halfpenny of the late king George II The knee of Britannia was thought to represent a rat a Hanoverian one gnawing into her bowels  couched in the king's This made much noise and gave rise to a report that king James was in England and lay concealed in Rotier's house in the Tower Norbert on these dissatisfactions left England and retiring into France where he had been educated in the academy was received and employed  by Louis XIV where whatever had been his inclinations here he certainly made several medals of the young chevalier  John the father survived king William A medal being ordered of the new queen Harris a player who succeeded Rotier and was incapable of the office employed workmen to do the business among whom was Mr Croker who afterwards obtained the place Sir Godfrey Kneller drew a profile of the queen and Mr Bird the statuary modelled it Her majesty did not like the essay and recollected Rotier but was told the family had left England or were dead Sir Godfrey being ordered to inspect the work and going to the Tower learned that John Rotier was still living whom he visited and acquainted with what had happened The old man in a passion began a die but died before he could finish it in and was buried in the Tower The unfinished die with others of the twelve caesars were sent to France to his relations whence two of them arrived hoping to be employed One of them modelled the face of Sir Hans Sloane and struck a silver medal of the duke of Beaufort but not meeting with success they returned This entire account Vertue received in from two surviving sisters of Norbert Rotier Their mother who had a portrait of her husband John which the daughters sent for died in Flanders about  Of the works of the Rotiers some may be seen in Evelyn John made a large milled medal of duke Lauderdale in with the graver's own name Norbert a medal of Charles I struck about the time of the Revolution and another of his queen One of them I know not which graved a large medal of a Danish admiral in the reign of king James A cornelian seal with the heads of Mars and Venus which Vertue saw was cut by John Rotier Of Joseph there  is a print while he was in the service of the French king and calling him "Cydevant graveur de la monoye de Charles II d'Angleterre"  DU FOUR  Nothing is known of his hand but a silver medal of lord Berkeley's head in a peruke reverse his arms Du

ANECDOTES of PAINTING  c  CHAP III  Artists in the Reign of James II  THE short and tempestuous reign of James though he himself seems to have had much inclination to them afforded small encouragement to the arts His religion was not of a complexion to exclude decoration but four years crouded with insurrections prosecutions innovations were not likely to make a figure in a history of painting Several performers that had resided here in the preceding reign continued through that of James such as may peculiarly be ascribed to his short period I shall recapitulate  WILLIAM FERGUSON  A Scot who lived long in Italy and France painted still life dead fowl c while in Italy he composed two pictures sold in Andrew Hay's sale representing basreliefs antique stones c on which the light was thrown says Vertue in a surprizing manner His name and the date were on them On another was the year  for which reason I have placed him between these periods He worked very cheap and died here  JACQUES ROUSSEAU  V Graham's English School    Of Paris studied first under Swanevelt who had married one of his relations and then improved himself by a journey to Italy practicing solely in perspective architecture and landscape On his return home he was employed at Marly but being a protestant he quitted his work on the persecution of his brethren and retired to Swisserland Louvois invited him back he refused but sent his designs and recommended a proper person to execute them After a short stay in Swisserland he went to Holland whence he was invited over by Ralph duke of Montagu to adorn his new house in Bloomsbury where he painted much and had the supervisal of the building and even a hand in it His work amounted to  l  in lieu of which the duke allowed him an annuity for his life of  l  a year He received it but two years dying  He was buried in St Anne's  in Sohosquare at the age of about Some of his pictures both in landscape and architecture are over doors at Hamptoncourt and he etched after some of his own designs He left a widow but bequeathed most of what he had to his fellowsufferers the Refugèes Lord Burlington had a portrait of him by Le Fevre  CHARLES DE LA FOSSE  A name little known in England but of great celebrity in France  AWalker sculp  t    The author of the Abregè calls him  Un des plus grans coloristes de l'ecole Francoise  He might be so and not very excellent colouring is the point in which their best masters have failed La Fosse was invited to England by the duke of Montagu mentioned in the preceding article and painted two cielings for him the Apotheosis of Isis and an Assembly of the Gods The French author says that king William pressed him to stay here but that he declined the offer in hopes of being appointed first painter to his own monarch Parmentiere assisted La Fosse in laying the dead colours for him in his works at Montaguhouse La Fosse who arrived in the reign of James returned at the Revolution but came again to finish what he had begun and went back when he had finished  N HEUDE  Lived about this time and painted in the manner of Verrio to whom he is said to have been assistant He painted a staircase at the lord Tyrconnel's in Arlingtonstreet now demolished and a cieling at Bulstrode in both which he placed his own portrait and name He was master of Mr Carpenter the statuary  WILLIAM DE KEISAR  Of Antwerp was bred a jeweller in which profession he became very eminent but having been well educated and taught to draw he had a strong bent towards that profession and employed all his leisure on it practicing miniature enamel and oilcolours both in small and large Vertue says he fixed at last wholly on the former Graham that he  painted in little after the manner of Elsheimer that he imitated various manners drew cattle and birds and painted tombs and basreliefs in imitation of Vergazon and that he worked some time with Loten the landscapepainter This last circumstance is not very probable for Vertue who was acquainted with his daughter gives a very different account of his commencing painter by profession Having painted some altarpieces at Antwerp his business called him to Dunkirk where he drew a picture for the altar of the English nuns They were so pleased with it that they persuaded Keisar to go to England and gave him letters of recommendation to lord Melfort then in favour with king James The enthusiastic painter could not resist the proposal he embarked on board an English vessel and without acquainting his wife or family sailed for England His reception was equal to his wishes He was introduced to the king who promised to countenance him and several persons of rank who had known him at Antwerp encouraged him in his new vocation Transported with his prospect he sent for his wife ordering her to dismiss his workmen and convert his effects into moneyWithin half a year the bubble burst the Revolution happened Keisar's friends could no longer be his protectors his business decreased and the pursuit of the Philosopher's stone to which he had recourse in his despair compleated his ruin He died at the age of in four or five years after the Revolution He left a daughter whom he had taken great pains to instruct in his favorite study and with success She painted small portraits in oil and copied well but marrying one Mr Humble a gentleman he would not permit her to follow the prosession After his death she returned to it and died in December She had several pictures by her father's hand particularly a St Catherine painted  JOHN SYBRECHT  NLargiliere pinx  for the queen dowager's chapel at Somersethouse and his own head in watercolours by himself  LARGILLIERE  A French portraitpainter was in England in this reign but went away on the Revolution He drew the king and queen Sir John Warner his daughter and granddaughter and Vander Meulen and Sybrecht the painters Vertue mentions a small piece about two feet and an half high highly finished by him representing himself his wife and two children The painter is standing and leans on a pedestal his wife is sitting one of the children stands the other sits playing with fruit and flowers there is a peacock and a landscape behind them  JOHN SYBRECHT  Vertue saw a picture at the duke of Portland's by this master on which he wrote his name J Siberechts I have writ it as it is commonly spelt to prevent confusion  Of Antwerp painted landscapes and had studied the views on the Rhine his drawings of which in watercolours are more common than his pictures The duke of Buckingham returning through Flanders from his embassy to Paris found Sybrecht at Antwerp was pleased with his works invited him to England and employed him at Cliefden In he made several views of Chatsworth At Newstedeabbey lord Byron's are two pieces by this hand the first a landscape in the style of Rubens's school the other which is better a  prospect of Longleate not unlike the manner of Wouverman Sybrecht died in aged and was buried in St James's  HENRY TILSON  Was grandson of Henry Tilson bishop of Elphin born in Yorkshire and who died in Young Henry was bred under Sir Peter Lely after whose death he went to Italy in company with Dahl and staid seven years copying the works of the best masters with great diligence He succeeded in portraits both oil and crayons and was likely to make a figure when he grew disordered in his senses and shot himself at the age of He was buried at St Dunstan's in the West He painted his own portrait two or three times once with a pencil in his hand leaning on a bust Behind it was written H Tilsona Roma He drew a large familypicture of his father mother a younger brother a sister and himself Dahl gave Tilson his own picture inscribed behind "Memoria per mio caro amico Henrico Tilson fatto Roma "  FANCATI  An Italian copied the portraits of James and his queen with a pen from the originals of Kneller They were highly laboured and came into the possession of Mr George Clarke of Oxford  THOMAS BENIERE  A young statuary who flourished in this reign was born in England of French parents in His models and small works in marble  HENRY TILSON  Ipse pinx TChambars sculp  are much commended The anatomic figure commonly seen in the shops of apothecaries was taken from his original model He carved portraits in marble from the life for two guineas He lived and died near Fleetditch in  QUELLIN  Eldest son of a good statuary of Antwerp settled here and was concerned in several works which by the only specimen Vertue mentions I should think were very indifferent for he carved Mr Thynne's monument in Westminsterabbey He lived in a large old house in Towerstreet St Giles's near the Sevendials and died at the age of His widow married Van Ost of Mechlin another statuary Quellin's younger brother who followed the same business worked at Copenhagen Dantzick and Hamburgh and in ten years made a considerable fortune and died at Antwerp  In a book called the Art of Painting by Marshall Smith second edit fol mention is made of William De Ryck a disciple of Quellin who seems to have been a painter and to have come to England for recapitulating some of this man's works the author specifies "a Magdalen or the lady of Winchelsea" and adds "his daughter Mrs Katherine comes behind none of her fair sex in the art" There is a large sheet print the condemnation of St Catherine designed painted and engraved by William De Ryck and dedicated to a bishop of Antwerp  THOMAS EAST  Was engraver of the seals to James II and had learned of Thomas Simon East was succeeded by his nephew Mr John Roos who continued in that office till the accession of George I  ANECDOTES of PAINTING  c  CHAP IV  Painters in the Reign of King William  THIS prince like most of those in our annals contributed nothing to the advancement of arts He was born in a country where taste never flourished and nature had not given it to him as an embellishment to his great qualities He courted Fame but none of her ministers Holland owed it't preservation to his heroic virtue England it's liberty to his ambition Europe it's independence to his competition with Louis the fourteenth for however unsuccessful in the contest the very struggle was salutary Being obliged to draw all his resources from himself and not content to acquire glory by proxy he had no leisure like his rival to preside over the registers of his fame He fought his own battles instead of choosing mottoes for the medals that recorded them and though my lord Halifax promised  It has been observed that I have misquoted lord Halifax who does not promise king William an immortality in tapestry for his wound but tells him the French would have flattered him in that manner It is very true I mistook quoting only by memory and happily not being very accurately read in so indifferent an author The true reading is but more applicable to my purpose Whoever delights in such piddling criticisms and is afterwards capable of reasoning from a passage when he has rectified it may amuse himself in setting this right I leave the passage wrong as it stood at first in charity to such Commentators  him that his wound in the battle of the Boyne  Should run for ever purple in our looms  His majesty certainly did not bespeak a single suit of tapestry in memory of the action In England he met with nothing but disgusts He understood little of the nation and seems to have acted too much upon a plan formed before he came over and however necessary to his early situation little adapted to so peculiar a people as the English He thought that valour and taciturnity would conquer or govern the world and vainly imagining that his new subjects loved liberty better than party he trusted to their feeling gratitude for a blessing which they could not help seeing was conferred a little for his own sake Reserved unsociable ill in his health and sowered by his situation he sought none of those amusements that make the hours of the happy much happier If we must except the palace at Hamptoncourt at least it is no monument of his taste it seems erected in emulation of what it certainly was meant to imitate the pompous edifices of the French monarch We are told that  Great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed  To fix him gracefull on the bounding steed  In general I believe his majesty patronized neither painters nor  King William had so little leisure to attend to or so little disposition to men of wit that when St Evremont was introduced to him the

Titians and Vandycks if he encourages neitherYou must address yourself to a painter if you wish to be flattereda poet brings his incense to you Mary seems to have had little more propensity to the arts than the king the good queen loved to work and talk and contented herself with praying to God that her husband might be a great hero since he did not chuse to be a fond husband A few men of genius flourished in their time of whom the chief was  Sir GODFREY KNELLER  A man lessened by his own reputation as he chose to make it subservient to his fortune  The author of the Abregè says that Kneller preferred portraitpainting for this reason "Painters of history said he make the dead live and do not begin to live themselves till they are deadI paint the living and they make me live"  Had he lived in a country where his merit had been rewarded according to the worth of his productions instead of the number he might have shone in the roll of the greatest masters but he united the highest vanity with the most consummate negligence of characterat least where he offered one picture to fame he sacrificed twenty to lucre and he met with customers of so little judgment that they were fond of being painted by a man who would gladly have disowned his works the moment they were paid for Ten  Charles II James II and his queen William and Mary Anne George I Louis XIV Peter the Great and the emperor Charles VI For the last portrait Leopold created Kneller knight of the Roman empireby Anne he was made a gentleman of the privychamber and by the University of Oxford a doctor When he had finished the picture of Louis XIV that prince asked him what mark of his esteem wou'd be most agreable to him he answered modestly and genteely that if his majesty would bestow a quarter of an hour on him that he might make a drawing of his head for himself he should think it the highest honour he could possibly receive The king complied and the painter drew him on grey paper with black and red chalk heightened with white  sovereigns sat to him not one of them discovered  S  R  GODFREY KNELLER  JOHN ZACKARY KNELLER  TChambars sc  that he was fit for more than preserving their likeness We however who see king William the Czar Peter Marlborough Newton Dryden Godolphin Somers the duchess of Grafton lady Ranelagh and so many ornaments of an illustrious age transmitted to us by Kneller's pencil must not regret that his talent was confined to portraits Perhaps the treasure is greater than if he had decorated the chambers of Hamptoncourt with the wars of Aeneas or the enchanted palace of Armida and when one considers how seldom great masters are worthily employed it is better to have real portraits than Madonnas without end My opinion of what Sir Godfrey's genius could have produced must not be judged by the historic picture of king William in the palace just mentioned it is a tame and poor performance But the original sketch of it at Houghton is struck out with a spirit and fire equal to Rubens The hero and the horse are in the heat of battle In the large piece it is the king riding in triumph with his usual phlegm Of all his works Sir Godfrey was most proud of the converted Chinese at Windsor but his portrait of Gibbons is superior to it It has the freedom and nature of Vandyck with the harmony of colouring peculiar to Andrea Sacchi and no part of it is neglected In general even where he took pains all the parts are affectedly kept down to throw the greater force into the heada trick unworthy so  great a master His draperies too are so  He sometimes in the haste of finishing left part of the primed cloath uncoloured This fault which in Kneller proceeded from haste and rapaciousness was affectedly imitated by some of the painters who succeeded him while his great reputation was still in vogue Yet with all Sir Godfrey's desire of acquiring riches he left portraits unfinishedfor his customers were not equally ready to pay as to sit There is an entertaining account of these facts in Rouquet's State of the Arts in England  carelesly finished that they resemble no silk or stuff the world ever saw His airs of heads have extreme grace the hair admirably disposed and if the locks seem unnaturally elevated it must be considered as an instance of the painter's art He painted in an age when the women erected edifices of three stories on their heads Had he represented such preposterous attire in half a century his works would have been ridiculous To lower their dress to a natural level when the eye was accustomed to pyramids would have shocked their prejudices and diminished the resemblanceHe took a middle way and weighed out ornament to them of more natural materials Still it must be owned there is too great a sameness in his airs and no imagination at all in his compositions See but a head it interests youuncover the rest of the canvass you wonder faces so expressive could be employed so insipidly In truth the age demanded nothing correct nothing compleat Capable of tasting the power of Dryden's numbers and the majesty of Kneller's heads it overlooked doggrel and daubing What pity that men of fortune are not blest with such a pen or such a pencil That a genius must write for a bookseller or paint for an alderman  Sir Godfrey Kneller was born at Lubec about the year His  V Buckeridge's edition of De Piles and of Graham's English School in which he has inserted a new life of Sir Godfrey p  grandfather had an estate near Hall in Saxony was surveyor general of the mines and inspector of count Mansfeldt's revenues By his wife of the family of Crowsen he had one son Zachary educated at Leipsic and for some time in the service of Gustavus Adolphus's widow After her death he removed to Lubec married professed architecture and was chief surveyor to his native City He left two sons John Zachary and Godfrey The latter who at first was designed for a military life was sent to Leyden where he applied to mathematics and fortification but the predominance of nature determining him to painting his father acquiesced and sent him to Amsterdam where he studied under Bol and had some instructions from Rembrandt Vertue nor any of his biographers take notice of it nor do I assert it but I have heard that one of his masters was Francis Hals It is certain that Kneller had no servility of a disciple nor imitated any of them Even in Italy whither he went in he mimicked no peculiar style nor even at Venice where he resided most and was esteemed and employed by some of the first families and where he drew cardinal Bassadonna If he caught any thing it was instructions not hints If I see the least resemblance in his works to any other master it is in some of his earliest works in England and those his best to Tintoret A portrait at Houghton of Joseph Carreras a poet and chaplain to Catherine of Lisbon has the force and simplicity of that master without owing part of it's merit to Tintoret's universal black drapery to his own afterwards neglected draperies or to his master Rembrandt's unnatural Chiaro Scuro Latterly Sir Godfrey was thought to give into the manner of Rubens  I see it no where but in the sketch of king William's equestrian figure evidently imitated from Rubens's design of the cieling for the Banquettinghouse which as I have said in the life of that painter was in Kneller's possession The latter had no more of Rubens's rich colouring than of Vandyck's delicacy in habits but he had more beauty than the latter more dignity than Sir Peter Lely The latter felt his capacity in a memorable instance Kneller and his brother came to England in without intending to reside here but to return through France to Venice They were recommended to Mr Banks a Hamburghmerchant and Godfrey drew him and his family The pictures pleased Mr Vernon secretary to the duke of Monmouth saw them and sat to the new painter and obtained his master's picture by the same hand The duke was so charmed that he engaged the king his father to sit to Kneller at a time that the duke of York had been promised the king's picture by Lely Charles unwilling to have double trouble proposed that both the artists should draw him at the same time Lely as an established master chose the light he liked the stranger was to draw the picture as he could and performed it with such facility and expedition that his piece was in a manner finished when Lely's was only deadcoloured The novelty pleasedyet Lely deserved most honour for he did justice to his new competitor confessed his abilities and the likeness This success fixed Kneller here The series of his portraits prove the continuance of his reputation  Charles II sent him to Paris to draw Louis XIV but died in his absence The successor was equally favorable to him and was sitting for his picture for secretary Pepys when he received the news that the prince of Orange was landed  King William distinguished Kneller still more for  They were painted in his reign but the thought was the queen's during one of the king's absences and contributed much to make her unpopular as I have heard from the authority of the old countess of Carlisle daughter of Arthur earl of Essex who died within these few years and remembered the event She added that the famous lady Dorchester advised the queen against it saying "Madam if the king was to ask for the portraits of all the wits in his court wou'd not the rest think he called them fools"  that prince he painted the beauties at Hamptoncourt and was knighted by him in with the additional present of a gold medal and chain weighing  l  and for him Sir Godfrey drew the portrait of the Czar as for queen Anne he painted the king of Spain afterwards Charles VI so poor a performance that one would think he felt the fall from Peter to Charles His works in the gallery of  Seven of those heads are by Kneller the rest by Dahl  Admirals were done in the same reign and several of them worthy so noble a memorial The Kitcatclub generally mentioned as a set of wits in reality the patriots that saved Britain were Kneller's last works in that reign and his last public work He lived to draw George I was made a baronet by him and continued to paint during the greater part of his reign but in Sir Godfrey was seized with a violent fever from the immediate danger of which he was rescued by Dr Meade The humour however fell on his left arm and it was opened He remained in a languishing condition and died Oct His body lay in state and was buried at Witton but a monument was erected in Westminsterabbey  His monument executed by Rysbrach was directed by himself he lest  l  for it  where his friend Mr Pope as if to gratify an extravagant vanity dead which he had ridiculed living bestowed on  him a translation of Raphael's epitaphas high a compliment as even poetry could be allowed to pay to the original a silly hyperbole when applied to the modern This was not the only instance in which the poet incensed the painter Sir Godfrey had drawn for him the statues of Apollo Venus and Hercules Pope paid for them with these lines  What god what genius did the pencil move  When Kneller painted these  'Twas friendship warm as Phaebus kind as love  And strong as Hercules  He was in the right to suppress themwhat idea does muscular friendship convey It was not the same  Pope's character of Helluo is believed to allude to Sir Godfrey  warmth of friendship that made Pope put Kneller's vanity to the strongest trial imaginable The former laid a wager that there was no flattery so gross but his friend would swallow To prove it Pope said to him as he was painting "Sir Godfrey I believe if God Almighty had had your assistance the world would have been formed more perfect" "Fore God Sir replied Kneller I believe so" This impious answer was not extraordinary in the latterHis conversation on religion was extremely freeHis  In the same strain he said to a low fellow whom he overheard cursing himself "God damn  you  God may damn the duke of Marlborough and perhaps Sir Godfrey Kneller but do you think he will take the trouble of damning such a scoundrel as you" The same vanity that cou'd think itself intitled to preeminence even in horrors alighted on a juster distinction when he told his taylor who offended him by proposing his son for an apprentice "Dost thou think man  I  can make thy son a painter No God almighty only makes painters"  paraphrase on a particular text of scripture singular "In my father's house are many mansions" which Sir Godfrey interpreted  thus "At the day of judgment said he God will examine mankind on their different professions to one he will say Of what sect was you I was a Papistgo you there What was you A Protestantgo you thereAnd youA Turkgo you thereAnd you Sir GodfreyI was of no sectthen God will say Sir Godfrey chuse your place" His wit was ready his bonmots deservedly admired In great Queenstreet  He first lived in Durhamyard then years in Coventgarden and lastly in great Queenstreet Lincoln'sinnfields  he lived next door to Dr Ratcliffe Kneller was fond of flowers and had a fine collection As there was great intimacy between him and the physician he permitted the latter to have a door into his garden but Ratcliffe's servants gathering and destroying the flowers Kneller sent him word he must shut up the door Ratcliffe replied peevishly "Tell him he may do any thing with it but paint itAnd I answered Sir Godfrey can take any thing from him but physic" Sir Godfrey at Witton acted as Justice of Peace and was so much more swayed by Equity than Law that his judgments accompanied with humour are said to have occasioned those lines by Pope  I think Sir Godfrey should decide the suit  Who sent the Thief that stole the cash away  And punish'd him that put it in his way  This alluded to his dismissing a soldier who had stolen a joint of meat and accused the butcher of having tempted him by it Whenever Sir Godfrey was applied to to determine what parish a poor man belonged to he always inquired which parish was the richer and settled the poor man there nor wou'd ever sign a warrant to distrain the goods  of a poor man who could not pay a tax These instances showed the goodness of his heart others even in his capacity of justice his peculiar turn a handsome young woman came before him to swear a rape struck with her beauty he continued examining her as he sat painting till he had taken her likeness If he disliked interruption he would not be interrupted Seeing a constable coming to him at the head of a mob he called to him without inquiring into the affair "Mr Constable you see that turning go that way and you will find an alehouse the sign of the king's headgo and make it up"  He married Susannah Cawley daughter of the minister of Henley upon Thames She outlived him and was buried at Henley where are monuments for her and her father Before his marriage Sir Godfrey had an intrigue with a Quaker's wife whom he purchased of her husband and had a daughter whose portrait he drew like St Agnes with a lamb there is a print of it by Smith Kneller had amassed a great fortune though he lived magnificently and lost  l  in the Southsea yet he had an estate of near  l  a year left Part he bequeathed to his wife and entailed the rest on Godfrey Huckle his daughter's son with orders that he should assume the name of Kneller To three neices at Hamburgh the children of his brother he left legacies and an annuity of  l  a year to Bing an old servant who with his brother had been his Assistants Of these he had many as may be concluded from the quantity of his works and the badness of so many His chief performers were Pieters Vander Roer and Bakkersometimes he employed Baptist and Vergazon His prices were fifteen guineas for a head twenty if with one hand thirty for a half and sixty for a whole length  Kneller frequently drew his own portrait my father had one a head when young and a small one of the same age very masterly it is now mine It was engraved by Becket Another in a wig by Smith A halflength sent to the Tuscan gallery A halflength in a brocaded waistcoat with his gold chain there is a mezzotinto of it accompanying the Kitcatheads Another head with a cap a halflength presented to the gallery at Oxford and a double piece of himself and his wife Great numbers of his works have been engraved particularly by Smith who has more than done justice to them the draperies are preferable to the originals The first print taken from his works was by White of Charles II He had an historic piece of his own painting before he went to Italy Tobit and the Angel At his seat at Witton were many of his own works sold some years after his death He intended that Sir James Thornhill should paint the staircase there but hearing that Sir Isaac Newton was sitting to Thornhill Kneller was offended said no portraitpainter should paint his house and employed Laguerre  Pope was not the only bard that soothed this painter's vainglory Dryden repaid him for a present of Shakespeare's picture with a copy of verses full of luxuriant but immortal touches the most beautiful of Addison's poetic works was addressed to him the singular happiness of the allusions and applications of fabulous theology to the princes drawn by Kneller is very remarkable  Great Pan who wont to chase the fair  And love the spreading oak was there  For Charles IIAnd for James  Old Saturn too with upcast eyes  Beheld his abdicated skies  And the rest on William and Mary Anne and George I are all stamped with the most just resemblance  Prior complimented Kneller on the duke of Ormond's picture Steele wrote a poem to him at Witton Tickell another and there is one in the third part of Miscellaneous Poems vo Lond on the portrait of the lady Hyde Can one wonder a man was vain who had been flattered by Dryden Addison Prior Pope and Steele Joseph Harris dedicated to him his Tragicomedy of the Mistakes or False Report in in which Dryden Tate and Mountford had assisted And John Smith I suppose the celebrated mezzotinter addressed his translation of Le Brun's Conference on the Passions to Sir Godfrey On his death was written another Poem printed in a Miscellany published by D Lewis vo in His Brother  JOHN ZACHARY KNELLER  Who was thirteen years older than Sir Godfrey came to England with him and painted in fresco architecture and stilllife small pieces in oil and lastly in watercolours in which he copied several of his brother's heads Sir Godfrey drew his portrait one of his best works Of John's was a piece of stilllife with a great tankard in the middle and a small head of Wyck almost profile in oil in the possession of Dr Barnard bishop of Derry with the names of both artists dated John Kneller died in in Coventgarden and was buried in that church  JOHN JAMES BAKKER  Painted draperies for Kneller and went to Brussels with him in  where Sir Godfrey drew the elector of Bavaria on a white horse I don't know whether Bakker ever practiced for himself He was brother of Adrian Bakker who painted history and portraits at Amsterdam and died in  JACOB VANDER ROER  Another of Kneller's assistants was scholar of J De Baan and lived many years in London died at Dort See an account of him in the third volume of Descamps  JOHN PIETERS  Was born at Antwerp and learned of Eykens a historypainter He came to England in at the age of eighteen  He was so poor that he engaged himself as a domestic in the service of cardinal Dada the pope's nuntio but quitted him before night  and was recommended to Sir Godfrey for whom he painted draperies and whom he quitted in and was employed in the same service by others but his chief business was in mending drawings and old pictures in which he was very  He excelled in copying Rubens and even passed off several prints which he had washed for original drawings of that master But this cheat is not so great a proof of Pieters's abilities as of the ignorance of our collectors who at every auction are still imposed upon by such gross frauds  skilfull Pieters and Bakker were both kind to Vertue in his youth and gave him instructions which he acknowledges with great gratitude Pieters loved his bottle and was improvident and towards the end of his life was poor and gouty He died in and was buried in the churchyard of St Martin's  JOHN BAPTIST MONOYER  V Graham and the Abregè    One of the greatest masters that has appeared for painting flowers They are not so exquisitely finished as Van Huysum's but his colouring and composition are in a bolder style He was born at Lisle in and educated at Antwerp as a painter of history which he soon changed for flowers and going to Paris in was received into the academy with applause and though his subjects were not thought elevated enough to admit him to a professorship he was in consideration of his merit made a counsellor a silly distinction as if a great painter in any branch was not sitter to profess that branch than give advice on any other He was employed at Versailles Trianon Marly and Meudon and painted in the hotel de Bretonvilliers at Paris and other houses The duke of Montagu brought him to England where much of his hand is to be seen at Montaguhouse Hamptoncourt the duke of St Albans's at Windsor Kensington lord Carlisle's Burlingtonhouse c The author of the Abregè speaking of Baptist La Fosse and Rousseau says these three French painters have extorted a sincere confession from the English "Qu'on ne peut aller plus loin en fait de peinture" Baptist is undoubtedly capital in his way but they must be ignorant Englishmen indeed who can see any thing masterly in the two others Baptist passed and repassed several times between France and England but having married his daughter to a French painter who was suffered to alter and touch upon his pictures Baptist was offended and returned to France no more He died in Pallmall in His son Antony called young Baptist painted in his father's manner and had merit There is a good print by White  JOHN BAPTIST MONOYER  GKneller pinx TChambars sculp  from a fine head of Baptist by Sir Godfrey Kneller At the same time with Baptist was here Montingo another painter of flowers but I find no account of his life or works  HENRY VERGAZON  V Graham    A Dutch painter of ruins and landscapes with which he sometimes was called to adorn the backgrounds of Kneller's pictures though his colouring was reckoned too dark He painted  a few  small portraits and died in France  PHILIP BOUL  A name of whom I find but one note Vertue says he had seen a pocketbook almost full of sketches and views of Derbyshire the Peak Chatsworth c very freely touched and in imitation of Salvator Rosa whose works this person studied Whether he executed any thing in painting I know not  EDWARD DUBOIS  Was born at Antwerp and studied under Groenwegen a landscapepainter who had been in Italy and several years in  So Graham I find no other account of this Groenwegen nor of his works here  Englanda course of travels pursued by the disciple who after a stay of eight years in the former where he studied the antique and painted for Charles Emanuel duke of Savoy came to England where he professed  landscape and historypainting He died here about at the age of and was buried at St Giles's His younger brother  SIMON DUBOIS  Was a better master He lived years at home but came to England as early as several small heads in oil being dated in that year they are commonly distinguished by the fashion of that time laced cravats Portrait however was not his excellence originally he painted battles small and in the Italian manner afterwards horses  He had received some instructions from Wouverman  and cattle with figures the faces of which were so neatly finished that a lady persuaded him to try likenesses and sat to him herself He sold many of his pieces for originals by Italian hands saying sensibly that since the world would not do him justice he would do it himself his works sold well when his name was concealed Lord Somers distinguished better he went unknown and sat to Dubois and going away gave him guineas ordered the robes of chancellor and when the picture  Elsum has an epigram on this picture  was finished gave him as much more The two brothers lived together in Coventgarden without any servant working in obscurity and heaping up money both being avaricious When Edward died Simon left without society began to work for Vandevelde and one day in a fit of generosity offered to draw the portrait of his eldest daughter This drew on a nearer acquaintance and the old man married her but died in a year leaving her his money and a fine collection of pictures and naming his patron lord Somers executor he was buried May His young widow married again and dissipated the fortune  SIMON DUBOIS  ABannerman Sculp  and collection Dubois drew a whole length of archbishop Tenison now at Lambeth and Vandervaart the painter had his own head by himself  HENRY COOKE  Was born in and was thought to have a talent for history He went to Italy and studied under Salvator Rosa On his return neither rich nor known he lived obscurely in Knave'sacre in partnership with a housepainter Lutterel introduced him to Sir Godfrey Copley who was pleased with his works and carried him into Yorkshire where he was building a new house in which Cooke painted and received  l  He then lived five years with the father of Antony Russel whom I have mentioned in the preceding volume but quarrelling with a man about a mistress whom Cooke kept by whom he had children and whom he afterwards married Cooke killed him and fled He then went to Italy and staid seven years and returning lived privately till the affair was forgot Towards the end of his life he was much employed By order of King William he repaired the  Graham says he copied the Cartoons in turpentine oil in the manner of distemper a way he invented  Cartoons and other pictures in the royal collection though Walton had the salary He finished the equestrian portrait of Charles II at Chelseacollege and painted the choir of Newcollegechapel Oxford the staircase at Ranelaghhouse the cieling of a great room at the waterworks at Islington and the staircase at lord Carlisle's in Sohosquare where the assemblies are now kept  Among Elsum's epigrams is one on a listening faun by Cooke  He had sometimes  painted portraits but was soon disgusted with that business from the caprices of those that sat to him He died Nov and was buried at St Giles's I have his own head by him touched with spirit but too dark and the colouring not natural  PETER BERCHETT  Was born in France and beginning to draw at the age of under La Fosse he improved so fast that in three years he was employed in the royal palaces He came to England in to work under Rambour a French painter of architecture who says Vertue was living in but then staid only a year and returned to Marli He came again and painted for some persons of rank in the west King William building a palace at Loo sent Berchett thither where he was engaged fifteen months and then came a third time to England where he had sufficient business He painted the cieling in the chapel of Trinitycollege Oxford the staircase at the duke of Schomberg's in Pallmall and the summerhouse at Ranelagh His drawings in the academy were much approved Towards the end of his life being troubled with a ptysic he retired to Marybone and painted only small pieces of fabulous history his last was a bacchanalian to which he put his name the day before he died it was in January at Marybone where he was buried He left a son that died soon after him at the age of seventeen  LOUIS CHERON  Born at Paris in was son of Henry Cheron an enamel painter  and brother of Elizabeth Sophia Cheron an admired paintress and who engraved many ancient gems Louis went to Italy and says the * author of his life "A toujours cherchè Raphael Jules Romain" A pursuit in which he was by no means successfull He came to England on account of his religion in and was employed at the duke of Montagu's at Boughton at Burleigh and at Chatsworth where he painted the sides of the gallery a very poor performance He had before fallen into disesteem when he painted at Montaguhouse where he was much surpassed by Baptist Rousseau and La Fosse On this illsuccess he turned to painting small histories but his best employment was designing for the painters and engravers of that time few books appeared with plates but from his drawings Vanderbank Vandergutch Simpson Kirkall c all made use of him His drawings are said to be preferable to his paintings He etched several of his own designs as the labours of Hercules which were afterwards retouched with the burin by his disciple Gerard Vandergutch and towards the end of his life Cheron etched from his own drawings a suite of twentytwo small histories for the life of David they were done for or at least afterwards purchased by P F Giffart a bookseller at Paris who applied them to a version of the Psalms in French metre published in Some time before his death Cheron sold his drawings from Raphael and his academic figures to the earl of Derby for a large sum He was a man of a fair character and dying in of an apoplexy left  l  a year to his maid and the rest of his fortune to his relations and to charitable uses He was buried from his lodgings in the piazza of Coventgarden and lies in the great porch of that church  JOHN RILEY  One of the best native painters that has flourished in England whose talents while living were obscured by the fame rather than by the merit of Kneller and depressed since by being confounded with Lely an honour unlucky to his reputation Graham too speaks of him with little justice saying he had no excellence beyond a head which is far from true I have seen both draperies and hands painted by Riley that would do honour to either Lely or Kneller The portrait of lordkeeper North at Wroxton is capital throughout Riley who was humble modest and of an amiable character had the greatest diffidence of himself and was easily disgusted with his own works the source probably of the objections made to him With a quarter of Sir Godfrey's vanity he might have persuaded the world he was as great a master  He was born  One Thomas Riley was an Actor and has a copy of verses addressed to him in Randolph's poems This might be the painter's father In the same place are some Latin verses by Riley whom I take to be our painter himself  in and received instructions from Fuller and Zoust but was little noticed till the death of Lely when Chiffinch being persuaded to sit to him the picture was shown and recommended him to the king Charles sat to him but almost discouraged the bashfull artist from pursuing a profession so proper for him Looking at the picture he cried "Is this like me then od's fish I am an ugly fellow" This discouraged Riley so much that he could not bear the picture though he sold it for a large price James and his queen sat to him So did their successors and appointed him  John Riley  Egbert Hemskirk  ABannerman Sculp  their painter But the gout put an early end to Riley's progress He died in at the age of and was buried in Bishopsgatechurch in which parish he was born Richardson married a near relation of Riley and inherited about  l  in pictures drawings and effects  JOHN CLOSTERMAN  Son of a painter was born at Osnabrugh and with his countryman one Tiburen went to Paris in where he worked for De Troye In they came to England and Closterman at first painted draperies for Riley and afterwards they painted in conjunction Riley still executing most of the heads On his death Closterman finished several of his pictures which recommended him to the duke of Somerset who had employed Riley He painted the duke's children but lost his favour on a dispute about a picture of Guercino which he had bought for his grace and which was afterwards purchased by lord Halifax and on which occasion the duke patronized Dahl Closterman however did not want business He drew Gibbons the carver and his wife in one  There is a mezzotinto from it  piece which pleased and Closterman was even set in competition with Sir Godfrey He painted the duke and duchess of Marlborough and all their children in one picture and the duke on horseback on which subject however he had so many disputes with the duchess that the duke said "It has given me more trouble to reconcile my wife and you than to fight a battle" Closterman who sought reputation went to Spain where he drew the king and queen and from whence he wrote several letters on the pictures in that country to Mr Richard Graham He also went twice  to Italy and brought over several good pictures The whole length of queen Anne at Guildhall is by him and another at Chatsworth of the first duke of Rutland and in Painter'shall a portrait of Mr Saunders Elsum has bestowed an epigram on his portrait of Dryden yet Closterman was a very moderate performer his colouring strong but heavy and his pictures without any idea of grace Latterly he married a woman who wasted his fortune and disordered his understanding He died sometime after and was buried in Coventgarden where he lived  WILLIAM DERYKE  Graham    Of Antwerp was bred a jeweller but took to painting history which he practiced in England and died here about leaving a daughter whom he had brought up to his art  DIRK MAAS or THEODORE MAAS  A Dutch painter of landscapes and battles was in England in this reign and painted the battle of the Boyne for the earl of Portland There was a print in two sheets from that picture  PETER VANDER MEULEN  Brother of the battlepainter so well known for his pictures of the military history of Louis quatorze Peter who came into England in lived to be employed in the same manner by Louis's rival king William Originally this Vander Meulen was a sculptor Largilliere  PETER VANDER MEULEN  ABannerman Sculp  See before in the reign of king James  and Peter Van Bloemen followed him into England the former drew the portrait of Peter Vander Meulen from which there is a mezzotinto by Becket  PAUL MIGNART  Another painter who overflowed to us from France was son of Nicholas Mignart of Avignon and nephew of the celebrated Mignart There is a print by  I have mentioned this person in the life of Vansomer in the preceding volume He was both painter and scraper in mezzotinto  Paul Vansomer from a picture of the countess of Meath painted by Paul Mignart and another by the same hands of the ladies Henrietta and Anne the two eldest daughters of the duke of Marlborough  EGBERT HEMSKIRK  V Graham  Of Harlem a buffoon painter was scholar of De Grebber but lived in England where he painted what were called pieces of humour that is drunken scenes Quaker'smeetings wakes c He was patronized by lord Rochester and died in London leaving a son of his profession  FREDERIC  I have been told that his true name was Casaubon and that he was descended from or allied to the learned men of that appellation  KERSEBOOM  Was born at Solingen in Germany in and went to Amsterdam  to study painting and from thence to Paris in where he worked for some years under Le Brun till he was sent to Rome at the expence of the chancellor of France who maintained him there fourteen years two of which he passed with Nicolo Poussin whose manner he imitated not so well I should suppose as Graham asserts since having been supported so long by a French minister he probably would have fixed in France if he had made any progress proportionable to that expence On the contrary he came to England to paint history in which not meeting with much encouragement he turned to portraits Graham says he was the first who brought over the art of painting on glassI suppose he means painting on lookingglass Kerseboom died in London in and was buried in St Andrew's Holbourn  SEVONYANS  A name  He is often called Schonians by which appellation he is recorded in the printed catalogue of the collection in the gallery at Dusseldorp where are three or four pieces painted by him particularly his own head with a long beard  of which I have heard but can learn nothing except that he painted a staircase in a house called little Montaguhouse the corner of Bloomsburysquare and the head of Dr Peter of St Martin'slane Yet from his own portrait in the possession of Mr Eckardt the painter he appears to have been an able master  Sir JOHN MEDINA  Was son of Medina de L'Asturias a Spanish captain who had settled at Brussels where the son was born and instructed in painting by  SEVONYANS  Herbert Tuer  Ipse pinx Bannerman Sculp  S  r  JOHN MEDINA  Ipse pinx TChambars sculp  Du Chatel He married young and came into England in where he drew portraits for several years The earl of Leven encouraged him to go to Scotland and procured him a subscription of  l  worth of business He went carrying a large number of bodies and postures to which he painted heads He came to England for a short time but returned to and died in Scotland and was buried in the churchyard of the Greyfriars at Edinburgh in aged He painted most of the Scotch nobility but was not rich having twenty children The portraits of the professors in the surgeon'shall at Edinburgh were painted by him and are commended At Wentworthcastle is a large piece containing the first duke of Argyle and his sons the two late dukes John and Archibald in Roman habits the style Italian and superior to most modern performers In Surgeon'shall are two small histories by him The duke of Gordon presented sir John Medina's head to the great duke for his collection of portraits by the painters themselves the duke of Gordon too was drawn by him with his son the marquis of Huntley and his daughter lady Jane in one piece Medina was capable both of history and landscape He was knighted by the duke of Queensberry lord high commissioner and was the last knight made in Scotland before the Union The prints in the octavo edition of Milton were designed by him and he composed another set for Ovid's Metamorphosis but they were never engraved  MARCELLUS LAROON  Was born at the Hague in and learned to paint of his father with whom he came young into England Here he was placed with  one La Zoon a portraitpainter and then with Fleshiere but owed his chief improvement to his own application He lived several years in Yorkshire and when he came to London again painted draperies for sir Godfrey Kneller in which branch he was eminent but his greatest excellence was in imitating other masters and those considerable My father had a picture by him that easily passed for Bassan's He painted history portraits conversations both in large and small Several prints were made from his works and several plates he etched and scraped himself A book of fencing the cries of London and the procession at the coronation of William and Mary were designed by him He died of a consumption March th His son captain Laroon who had a genius both for painting and music had his father's picture painted by himself  The son sold his collection of pictures among which were many painted by his father by auction Feb    THOMAS PEMBROKE  V Graham  Was disciple of Laroon and imitated his manner both in history and portraits He painted several pictures for Granville earl of Bath in conjunction with Woodfield  Schollar of Fuller See the beginning of this volume  and died at the age of  FRANCIS LE PIPER  A gentleman  His father was a Kentish gentleman of Flemish extraction  artist with whose lively conversation Graham was so struck that he has written a life of him five times longer than most  VANDIEST  LE PIPER  ABannerman Sculp  of those in his work The substance of it is that though born to an estate he could not resist his impulse to drawing which made him ramble over great part of Europe to study painting which he scarcely ever practiced drawing only in black and white and carried him to Grand Cairo where as he could see no pictures I am surprized he did not take to painting Most of his performances were produced over a bottle and took root where they were born the Mitre Tavern at Stock's market and the Bell at Westminster were adorned by this jovial artist At the former was a room called  the Amsterdam  from the variety of sects Mr Le Piper had painted in it particularly a Jesuit and a Quaker One branch of his genius that does not seem quite so good humoured as the rest of his character was a talent for caricaturas He drew landscapes etched on silver plates for the tobaccoboxes of his friends and understood perspective Towards the end of his life his circumstances were reduced enough to make him glad of turning his abilities to some accountBecket paid him for designing his mezzotintos Several heads of grand signiors in sir Paul Rycaut's history were drawn by him and engraved by Elder At last Le Piper took to modelling in wax and thought he could have made a figure in it if he had begun sooner On the death of his mother his fortune being reestablished he launched again into a course of pleasure contracted a fever and being bled by an ignorant surgeon who pricked an artery he died of it in in Aldermanbury and was buried in the church of St Mary Magdalen Bermondsey in Southwark Vertue had a large picture by Fuller containing the portraits of several painters and of one woman the person in the middle was Le Piper  SADLER  Was educated in painting at the expence of Dr Sydenham whose picture he drew for the earl of Salisbury to whom the doctor recommended him and in which family he lived as steward to his death continuing his art A print of John Bunyan after Sadler has been lately published in mezzotinto His son Mr Thomas Sadler was deputy clerk of the Pells and drew too His fine collection of agates shells drawings c were sold a few years ago on his death  GODFREY SCHALKEN  A great master if tricks in an art or the mob could decide on merit a very confined genius when rendering a single effect of light was all his excellence  Elsum has this epigram on a boy blowing a firebrand by Schalken  Striving to blow the brand into a flame  He brighten's his own face and th' author's fame  What should one think of a poet if he wrote nothing but copies of verses on a rainbow He was born at Dort in his father who was a schoolmaster wished to bring him up to the same

England but found the business too much engrossed by Kneller Closterman and others Yet he once drew king William but as the piece was to be by candlelight he gave his majesty the candle to hold till the tallow ran down upon his fingers As if to justify this illbreeding he drew his own picture in the same situation Delicacy was no part of his character having drawn a lady who was marked with the smallpox but had handsome hands she asked him when the face was finished if she must not sit for her hands"No replied Schalken I always draw them from my housemaid" Robert earl of Sunderland employed him at Althorp at Windsor is a wellknown picture in the gallery He came over twice the last time with his wife and family and staid long and got much money He returned to Holland and was made painter

ADRIAN VANDIEST  Was born at the Hague and learned of his father a painter of seapieces Adrian came to England at the age of seventeen and followed both portrait and landscapepainting but was not much encouraged except by Granville earl of Bath for whom he worked at his seat and drew several views and ruins in the west of England One cannot think him a despicable painter for seven of his landscapes were in Sir Peter Lely's collection His own portrait with a kind of ragged stuff about his head and a landscape in his hand was painted by himself  He began a set of prints after views from his own designs but the gout put an end to an unhappy life in the th year of his age and he was buried in St Martin's  Graham  He left a son who painted portraits and died a few years ago  GASPAR SMITZ

Charles II but was postponed to place him here with his son  JOHN VAN WYCK  An excellent painter of battles and huntings his small figures and his horses  The fine horse under the duke of Schomberg by Kneller was painted by Wyck  particularly have a spirit and neatness scarce inferior to Woverman's the colouring of his landscapes is warm and chearful Sometimes he painted large pieces as of the battle of the Boyne the siege of Namur  Lord Ilchester has the siege of Narden by him with king William when prince of Orange commanding at it and lord Finlater the siege of Namur with the same king and his attendants extremely like In Scotland there are many pieces by Wyck  c but the smaller his pictures the greater  his merit At Houghton is a greyhound's head by him of admirable nature in king James's collection was a battle by him He painted several views in Scotland and of the isle of Jersey and drew a book of hunting and hawking John Wyck married in England and died at Mortlack in Besides that eminent disciple Mr Wootton he had another scholar  Sir MARTIN BECKMAN  Who drew several views and pieces of shipping He was engineer to Charles II and planned Tilburyfort and the works at Sheerness  See Description of London and the Environs vol vi p    HENRY VAN STRAATEN  A Landscapepainter resided in London about the year and afterwards He got much money here but squandered it as fast One day sitting down to paint he could do nothing to please himself He made a new attempt with no better success Throwing down his pencils he stretched himself out to sleep when thrusting his hand inadvertently into his pocket he found a shilling swearing an oath he said it is always thus when I have any money Get thee gone continued he throwing the shilling out of the window and returning to his work produced one of his best pieces This story he related to the gentleman who bought the picture His drawings are in the style of Ruisdale and Berghem  J WOOLASTON  Born in London about was a portraitpainter and happy in taking likenesses but I suppose never excellent as his price was but five guineas for a ¾ cloth He married the daughter of one Green an attorney by whom he had several children of which one son followed his father's profession In the father resided in Warwicklane and afterwards near Coventgarden He died an aged man in the Charterhouse Besides painting he performed on the violin and flute and played at the concert held at the house of that extraordinary person Thomas Britton the smallcoalman whose picture he twice drew one of which portraits was purchased by Sir Hans Sloane and is now in the British Museum There is a mezzotinto from it T Britton who made much noise in his time considering his low station and trade was a collector of all sorts of curiosities particularly drawings prints books manuscripts on uncommon subjects as mystic divinity the philosopher's stone judicial astrology and magic and musical instruments both in and out of vogue Various were the opinions concerning him Some thought his musical assembly only a cover for seditious meetings others for magical purposes He was taken for an Atheist a Presbyterian a Jesuit But Woolaston the painter and the father of a gentleman from whom I received this account and who were both members of the musicclub assured him that Britton was a plain simple honest man who only meaned to amuse himself The subscription was but ten shillings a year Britton found the instruments and they had coffee at a penny a dish Sir Hans Sloane bought many of his books and MSS now in the Museum  when they were sold by auction at Tom's coffeehouse near Ludgate  JOHN SCHNELL  Of whom or of his works says Vertue I never heard except from his epitaph in St James'schurchyard at Bristol H S E John Schnell portraitpainter born at Basil April died Nov One Linton was a painter of several citizens in this reign from whose works there are prints These trifling notices as I have said are only inserted to lead to farther discoveries or to assist families in finding out the painters of their ancestors The rest of this reign must be closed with a few names not much more important  Sir RALPH COLE  Appears as the painter of a picture of Thomas Windham  esq  from which there is a mezzotinto  HEFELE  A German came over as a soldier in king William's Dutch troops obtained his discharge and remained here several years dying it is said in queen Anne's reign He painted landscapes flowers and insects neatly in watercolours but with too little knowledge of chiaro scuro He sold a few of his works to collectors and the rest being very poor to printsellers They are now very scarce Mr Willett a merchant and virtuoso in Thamesstreet has about thirty and Mr Chadd jeweller in Bondstreet about a dozen  The BISHOP of ELY  Vertue says he had seen two drawings in blacklead by the bishop of Ely the one of archbishop Dolben from Loggan the other of archbishop Tenison from White but he does not specify the name of the bishop If these portraits were done at the time of Tenison being primate it was probably Simon Patrick bishop of Ely who says his epitaph was illustrious Optimis artibus colendis promovendisque But if it was the bishop living when Vertue's MS is dated which is it was Dr Thomas Green Graham mentions another prelate  SIMON DIGBY  Consecrated Jan  Bishop of Elfin in Ireland whose limnings he much commends  There are some of his lordship's miniatures at Shirburncastle particularly a head of Kildare lord Digby greatgrandfather of the present lord The bishop's father was bishop of Dromore and a branch of the same family with lord Digby but settled in Ireland I am told that a taste for the art continues in the bishop of Elsin's descendents one of whom has a genius for landscape  SUSAN PENELOPE ROSE  Daughter of Gibson the dwarf and wife of a jeweller painted in watercolours with great freedom In Mr Rose's sale was a halflength miniature of an embassador from Morocco eight inches by six painted by her in with the embassador's names on it he sat to her and to Sir Godfrey Kneller at the same time I have the portrait  of bishop Burnet in his robes as chancellor of the garter by her She died in at the age of and was buried in Coventgarden  MARY MORE  A lady who I believe painted for her amusement was grandmother of Mr Pitfield in the family are her and her husband's portraits by herself In the Bodleian Library at Oxford is a picture that she gave to it which by a strange mistake is called Sir Thomas More though it is evidently a copy of Cromwell earl of Essex Nay Robert Whitehall a poetaster wrote verses to her in on her sending this supposed picture of Sir Thomas More  V Wood's Athenae vol ii fol  The other arts made no figure in this reign I scarce find even names of Professors  JOHN BUSHNELL  An admired statuary in his own time but only memorable to us by a capricious character He was scholar of Burman who having debauched his servantmaid obliged Bushnell to marry her The latter in disgust left England staid two years in France and from thence went to Italy He lived some time at Rome and at Venice in the last city he made a magnificent monument for a Procuratore di San Marco representing the seige of Candia and a naval engagement between the Venetians and Turks He came home through Germany by the way of Hamburgh Some of his first works after his return were the Statues of Charles I and II at the Royalexchange  and Sir Thomas Gresham there above stairs His best were the kings at Templebar He carved several marble monuments particularly one for lord Ashburnham in Sussex one for Dr Grew's wife in Christchurch London one for lord Thomond in Northamptonshire Cowley's and Sir Palmes Fairborn's in Westminsterabbey and cut a head of Mr Talman He had agreed to compleat the set of kings at the Royalexchange but hearing that another person I suppose Cibber had made interest to carve some of them Bushnell would not proceed though he had begun six or seven Some of his profession asserting that though he was skillfull in drapery he could not execute a naked figure he engaged in an Alexander the Great which served to prove that his rivals were in the right at least in what he could  not  do His next whim was to demonstrate the possibility of the Trojan horse which he had heard treated as a fable that could not have been put in execution He undertook such a wooden receptacle and had the dimensions made in timber intending to cover it with stucco The head was capable of containing twelve men sitting round a table the eyes served for windows Before it was half compleated a storm of wind overset and demolished it and though two Vintners who had contracted with him to use his horse as a drinking booth offered to be at the expence of erecting it again he was too much disappointed to recommence This project cost him  l  Another of vessels for bringing coals to London miscarried too with deeper cost These schemes with the loss of an estate that he had bought in Kent by a lawsuit quite overset his disordered brain He died in and was buried at Paddington leaving two sons and a daughter The sons of whom one had  l  a year the other  l  were as great humourists as the Father they lived in a large  house fronting Hydepark in the lane leading from Piccadilly to Tyburn which had been built by the father but was unfinished and had neither staircase nor floors Here they dwelt like hermits recluse from all mankind sordid and impracticable and saying the world had not been worthy of their father Vertue in one of his MSS dated begins thus After long expectations I saw the inside of John Bushnell's house the sons being abroad both" He describes it particularly and what fragments he saw there particularly a model in plaister of Charles II on horseback designed to have been cast in brass but almost in ruins the Alexander and the unfinished kings Against the wall a large piece of his painting a triumph almost obliterated too He was desired to take particular notice of a bar of iron thicker than a man's wrist broken by an invention of Bushnell  THOMAS STANTON  A statuary made a tomb in the church of Stratford upon Avon which Vertue says is in a good taste  D LE MARCHAND  Was a carver in ivory born at Dieppe was many years in England and cut a great number of heads in basrelief and some whole figures in ivory Mr West has his head carved by himself oval Lord Oxford had the bust of lord Somers by him He also did one of Sir Isaac Newton another was a profile of Charles Marbury set in a frame of lookingglass Mr Willet has another head of a gentleman pretty large with the initial letters D L M He died in  WILLIAM TALMAN  Born at WestLavington in Wiltshire where he had an estate was comptroller of the works in the reign of king William but of his life I find scarce any particulars though he was an architect employed in considerable works In he built Thoresbyhouse in Nottinghamshire burned a few years ago Dynhamhouse in Gloucestershire and Chatsworth the elegance and lightness of the latter front do great honour to the artist the other sides are not equally beautiful The flight of steps by which you ascend from the hall to the apartments was thought noble enough by Kent to be borrowed for Holkam His son John Talman resided much in Italy and made a large collection of prints and drawings particularly of churches and altars many of which were done by himself Mr Sadler had many altars and insides of churches at Rome washed by him in their proper colours and very well executed In the same manner he drew several of lord Oxford's curiosities A few of his drawings are in the library of the Antiquarian Society  Sir WILLIAM WILSON  Was an architect and rebuilt the steeple of Warwickchurch after it had been burned  ANECDOTES of PAINTING  c  CHAP V  Painters and other Artists in the Reign of Queen Anne  THE reign of Anne so illustrated by heroes poets and authors was not equally fortunate in artists Except Kneller scarce a painter of note Westminsterabbey testifies there were no eminent statuaries One man there was who disgraced this period by his architecture as much as he enlivened it by his wit Formed to please both Augustus and an Egyptian monarch who thought nothing preserved fame like a solid mass of stone he produced the Relapse and Blenheim Party that sharpened the genius of the age dishonoured it tooa halfpenny print of Sacheverel would have been preferred to a sketch of Raphael Lord Sunderland and lord Oxford collected books the duke of Devonshire and lord Pembroke pictures  Prince George of Denmark the queen's husband had a collection of medals which her majesty took in her share of his personal estate the whole of which amounted to  l  The queen had half the rest was divided among his nephews and neices who were so many that they did not receive above  l  each V Secret Hist of England  medals statues the performers of the time  had little pretensions to be admitted into such cabinets The period indeed was short I shall give an account of what I find in Vertue's notes  PELEGRINI  Was brought from Venice in this reign by the duke of Manchester for whom he painted a staircase in Arlingtonstreet now destroyed He performed several works of this kind for the duke of Portland and lord Burlington a salon staircase and cielings at Castle Howard the staircase at Kimbolton and a hall at Sir Andrew Fountain's at Narford in Norfolk He made several designs for painting the dome of St Paul's and was paid for them though they were not executed and was chosen one of the directors of the academy He painted besides many small pieces of history before he left England  When the famous system of Mr Lawes was set on foot in France the directors as ostentatious as their apes the Southseacompany purchased the Hotel de Nevers and began to decorate it in the most pompous manner Pelegrini was invited from England to paint the cieling of the principal gallery and wrote a description of his workall that now remains of it for the system burst and the king purchasing the visionary palace it was converted into the Royal Library and Pelegrini's labours demolished France the heathen gods the river of Mississipi religion and all the virtues and half the vices as allegoric personages with which the flatterers of the former reign had fatigued the eyes of the public were here again reassembled and avarice and prodigality and imposture were perfumed out of the same censers with which ambition and vainglory and superstition had been made drunk before Pelegrini's account of that work may be seen in L'Histoire des Premiers Peintres du Roi Vol ii p  whither he returned in but quitted it again in and entered into the service of the elector palatine With him arrived  MARCO RICCI or RIZZI  Who painted ruins in oil and better in watercolours and landstorms He and Pelegrini disagreeing Marco went to Venice and persuaded his uncle to come over Sebastian Ricci who had been Pelegrini's master and who was soon preferred to the disciple Ricci's works are still admired though there is little excellence in them his colouring is chalky and without force He painted the chapel at Bulstrode for the duke of Portland and in the last supper has introduced his own portrait in a modern habit At Burlingtonhouse the hall and some cielings are by him and a piece of ruins in the manner of Viviano Ricci and Cassini another painter here at that time  Sebastian Ricci excelled particularly in imitations of Paul Veronese many of which he sold for originals and once even deceived La Fosse When the latter was convinced of the imposition he gave this severe but just reprimand to Sebastian "For the future said he take my advice paint nothing but Paul Veroneses and no more Riccis" V Life of Mignard in L'Histoire des Premieres Peintres du Roi P  passed off several of their own compositions as the works of greater masters Sebastian painted the altarpiece in the chapel of Chelseacollege but left England on finding it was determined that Sir James Thornhill should paint the cupola of St Paul's Marco Ricci died at Venice in  BAKER  Painted insides of churches and some of those at Rome In Mr Sykes's sale was a view of St Paul's since it was rebuilt but with a more splendid altar  MARCO

Hungary his father a deputy from the states of that country to the emperor The son was not brought up to the profession but made considerable progress by the force of his natural abilities Fruit flowers and especially birds were his excellence Queen Anne bespoke several of his pieces still in the royal palaces He was a man of a gentle and fair character and lived between forty and fifty years in England known at first only by the name of the Hungarian He had raised an easy fortune but being persuaded to make it over to his son who was going to marry a reputed fortune who proved no fortune at all and other misfortunes succeeding poverty and sickness terminated his life at his house in Great Queenstreet His pictures and goods were sold by auction at his house the sign of the golden eagle in Great Queenstreet Lincoln'sinnfields His son is in the board of Ordnance and formerly painted in his father's manner  WILLIAM CLARET  Imitated Sir Peter Lely from whom he made many copies There is a print from his picture of John Egerton earl of Bridgwater done as early as Claret died at his house in Lincoln'sinnfields in and being a widower made his housekeeper his heiress  THOMAS MURRAY  Painted many portraits At the Royalsociety is a picture of Dr Halley by him and the earl of Halifax had one of Wycherley There is a mezzotinto of Murray  HUGH HOWARD  Better known by Prior's beautiful verses to him than by his own works was son of Ralph Howard doctor of physic and was born in Dublin Feb His father being driven from Ireland by the troubles that followed the Revolution brought the lad to England who discovering a disposition to the arts and Belles Lettres was sent to travel in and on his way to Italy passed through Holland in the train of Thomas earl of Pembroke one of the plenipotentiaries at the treaty of Ryswick Mr Howard proceeded as he had intended and having visited France and Italy returned home in October  Some years he passed in Dublin but the greatest and latter part of his life he spent entirely in England practicing painting at least with applause but having ingratiated himself by his fame and knowledge of hands with men of the first rank particularly the duke of Devonshire and lord Pembroke and by a parsimonious management of his good fortune and of what he received with his wife he was enabled to quit the practical part of his profession for the last twenty years of his life the former peer having obtained for him the posts of keeper of the statepapers and paymaster of his majesty's palaces In this pleasing situation he amused himself with forming a large collection of prints books and medals which at his  He died in Pallmall and was buried at Richmond  death March he bequeathed to his only brother Robert Howard bishop of Elphin who transported them to Ireland  Mr Howard's picture was drawn by Dahl very like and published in mezzotinto about a year before his death Howard himself etched from a drawing of Carlo Maratti a head of Padre Resta the collector with his spectacles on turning over a book of drawings  JAMES PARMENTIER  A Frenchman born in was nephew of Bourdon by whom he was first instructed but his uncle dying he came to England in and was employed at Montaguhouse by La Fosse to lay his dead colours King William sent Parmentier to his new palace at Loo but he quarrelled with Marot the surveyor of the buildings and returned to London where not finding much employment he went into Yorkshire and worked several years both in portrait and historic painting The altarpiece in a church at Hull and another in St Peter's at Leeds Moses receiving the law much commended by Thoresby are of his hand His best work was the staircase at Worksop To Painter's hall he gave the story of Diana and Endymion On the death of Laguerre in he returned to London in hopes of succeeding to the business of the latter He died in indifferent circumstances Dec as he was on the point of going to Amsterdam whither he had been invited by some relations He was buried in St Paul's Coventgarden  JOHN VANDER VAART  Of Harlem came to England in and learned of Wyck the father but did not confine himself to landscape For some time he painted draperies for Wissing and portraits  He twice drew his own portrait at the age of and of and one of Kerseboom  for himself and stilllife He was particularly famous for representations of partridges and dead game In old Devonshirehouse in Piccadilly he painted a  violin against a door that deceived every body When the house was burned this piece was preserved and is now at Chatsworth In he sold his collection and got more money by mending pictures than he did in the former part of his life by painting them He built a house in Coventgarden of which parish he was an inhabitant above fifty years He was a man of an amiable character and dying of a fever in at the age of seventyfour was buried in the righthand isle of the church of Coventgarden Prints were taken from several of his works some he executed in mezzotinto himself and others from Wissing in which art he gave instructions to the celebrated John Smith Vander Vaart who was a batchelor left a nephew Arnold who succeeded him in the business of repairing pictures  RHODOLPHUS SHMUTZ  Was born at Basil in Swisserland and in came into England where he painted portraits Vertue says "They were wellcoloured his draperies pleasant and his women gracefull He died in and was buried at Pancras  PREUDHOMME  Born at Berlin of French parents and educated in the academy there went for some time to Italy returned to Berlin and from thence came to England in where he was much employed in copying pictures and making drawings in chalk from Italian masters for engravers There was a design of engraving a set of prints from all the  best pictures in this country and Preudhomme went to Wilton with that view where after an irregular life he died in at the age of forty He had contracted a French style in his pictures from his master Monsieur Pesne  Colonel SEYMOUR  Nearly related to the present duke of Somerset and the earl of Hertford had some fine pictures and painted in watercolours and crayons In the latter he copied from Cooper a head of Sir John Robinson lieutenant of the Tower He also drew many historic heads and portraits with a pen He lived in the house in Hydepark at the end of Kensingtongarden  BOIT  Wellknown for his portraits in enamel in which manner he has never perhaps been surpassed but by his predecessor Petitot and his successor Zincke Before I give an account of him I must premise that I do not answer for the truth of some parts of his story which to me seem a little incredible I give them as I find them in two different MSS of Vertue who names his authors Peterson a scholar of Boit and another person Vertue was incapable of falshoodperhaps he was too credulous  Boit whose father was a Frenchman was born at Stockholm and bred a jeweller which profession he intended to follow here in England but changed for painting but was upon so low a foot that he went into the country and taught children to draw There he had engaged one of his scholars a gentleman's daughter to marry him  but the affair being discovered Boit was thrown  An act of tyranny as the affair was not compleat nor was there then a marriageact  into prison In that confinement which lasted two years he studied enamelling an art to which he fixed on his return to London and practiced with the greatest success Dahl chiefly recommended him His prices are not to be believed For a copy of colonel Seymour's picture by Kneller he had thirty guineas for a lady's head not larger double that sum and for a few plates  l  If this appears enormous what will the reader think of the following anecdote He was to paint a large plate of the queen prince George the principal officers and ladies of the court and Victory introducing the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene France and Bavaria prostrate on the ground standards arms trophies The size of the plate to be from to inches high by to inches wide Laguerre actually painted the design for it in oil Prince George who earnestly patronized the work procured an advance of  l  to Boit who took a spot of ground in Mayfair and erected a furnace and built convenient rooms adjoyning to work in He made several essays before he could even lay the enamelled ground the heat necessary being so intense that it must calcine as much in a few hours as furnaces in glasshouses do in hours In these attempts he wasted seven or eight hundred pounds In the mean time the prince who had often visited the operation died This put a stop to the work for some time Boit however began to lay colours on the plate but demanded and obtained  l  more This made considerable noise during which happened the revolution at court extending itself even to Boit's work Their graces of Marlborough were to be displaced even in the enamel and her majesty ordered Boit  to introduce Peace and Ormond instead of Victory and Churchill These alterations were made in the sketch which had not been in the fire and remained so in Peterson's hands when he related the story to Vertue Prince Eugene refused to sit The queen died Boit ran in debt his goods were seized by execution and he fled to France where he changed his religion was countenanced by the regent obtained a pension of  l  per ann and an apartment and was much admired in a country where they had seen no enameller since Petitot Boit died suddenly at Paris about Christmas Though he never executed the large piece in question there is one at Kensington of a considerable size representing queen Anne sitting and prince George standing by her At Bedfordhouse is another very large plate of the duke's father and mother I have a good copy by him of the Venus Cupid Satyr and Nymphs by Luca Jordano at Devonshirehouse and a fine head of admiral Churchill and miss Reade the paintress has a very fine head of Boit's own daughter enamelled by him from a picture of Dahl This daughter was married to Mr Graham apothecary in Polandstreet  LEWIS CROSSE  A painter in watercolours who is not to be confounded with  It is Michael Crosse of whom there is an account in Graham  Michael Crosse or De La Crux whom I have mentioned in the reign of Charles I Lewis Crosse painted several portraits in miniature in queen Anne's time many of which are in the collection of the duchess of Portland the countess of Cardigan c This Crosse repaired a little picture of the queen of Scots in the possession of duke Hamilton  and was ordered to make it as handsome as he could It seems a round face was his idea of perfect beauty but it happened not to be Mary's sort of beauty However it was believed a genuine picture and innumerable copies were made from it It is the head in black velvet trimmed with ermine Crosse had a valuable collection of miniatures the works of Peter Oliver Hoskins and Cooper Among them was a fine picture of a lady Sunderland by the latter his own wife and a head almost profile in crayons of Hoskins a great curiosity as I neither know of any other portrait of that master nor where the picture itself is now That collection was sold at his house the sign of the blue anchor in Henriettastreet Coventgarden Dec and Crosse died in October  Statuary in this reign and for some years afterwards was in a manner monopolized by  FRANCIS BIRD  The many public works by his hand which inspire nobody with a curiosity of knowing the artist are not good testimonies in his favour He was born in Piccadilly and sent at eleven years of age to Brussels where he learned the rudiments of his art from one Cozins who had been in England From Flanders he went to Rome and studied under Le Gros At nineteen scarce remembring his own language he came home and worked first for Gibbons then for Cibber He took  These two journies it is said he performed on foot  another short journey to Italy and at his return set up for himself The performance that raised his reputation was the  monument of Busby The latter had never permitted his picture to be drawn The moment he was dead his friends had a cast in plaister taken from his face and thence a drawing in crayons from which White engraved his print and Bird carved his image His other principal works which are all I find of his history were  The conversion of St Paul in the pediment of that cathedral Any statuary was good enough for an ornament of that height and a great statuary had been too good  The basreliefs under the portico  The statue of queen Anne and the four figures round the pedestal before the same church The author of the Abregè speaking of English artists says "à l'egard de la sculpture le marbre gemit pour ainsi dire sous des ciseaux aussi peu habiles que ceux qui ont executé le groupe de la reine Anne placè devant l'Eglise de St Paul les tombeaux de l'Abbaye de Westminster" This author had not seen the works of Rysbrach and Roubiliac and for the satire on the groupe of queen Anne we may pardon the sculptor who occasioned it as it gave rise to another satire those admirable lines of Dr Garth  The statue of cardinal Wolsey at Christchurch  The brazen figure of Henry VI at Etoncollegea wretched performance indeed  A magnificent monument in Fulhamchurch for the lord viscount Mordaunt Bird received  l  for his part of the sculpture  The sumptuous monument of the last duke of Newcastle in Westminsterabbey erected by the countess of Oxford his daughter The cumbent figure is not the worst of Bird's works  At lord Oxford's auction was sold his copy of the faun Bird died in aged  Sir JOHN VANBRUGH  Belongs only to this work in a light that is by no means advantageous to him He wants all the merit of his writings to protect him from the censure due to his designs What Pope said of his comedies is much more applicable to his buildings  How Van wants grace  Grace He wanted eyes he wanted all ideas of proportion convenience propriety He undertook vast designs and composed heaps of littleness The style of no age no country appears in his works he broke through all rule and compensated for it by no imagination He seems to have hollowed quarries rather than to have built houses and should his edifices as they seem formed to do outlast all record what architecture will posterity think was that of their ancestors The laughters his cotemporaries said that having been confined in the bastile he had drawn his notions of building from that fortified dungeon That a single man should have been capricious should have wanted taste is not extraordinary That he should have been selected to raise a palace  The duchess quarrelled with Sir John and went to law with him but though he proved to be in the right or rather  because  he proved to be in the right she employed Sir Christopher Wren to build the house in St James'spark  built at the public expence for the hero of his country surprises one Whose thought it was to load every avenue to that palace with inscriptions I do not know altogether they form an edition of the acts of parliament in stone However partial the court was to Vanbrugh every body was not so blind to his defects Swift ridiculed both his own diminutive house at Whitehall and the  S  r  JOHN VANBRUGH  Kneller pinx TChambars sculp  stupendous pile at Blenheim of the first he says  At length they in the rubbish spy  A thing resembling a goose pye  And of the other  That if his grace were no more skill'd in  The art of battering walls than building  We might expect to see next year  A mousetrapman chief engineer  Thus far the satyrist was well founded partyrage warped his understanding when he censured Vanbrugh's plays and left him no more judgment to see their beauties than Sir John had when he perceived not that they were the only beauties he was formed to compose Nor is any thing sillier than Swift's pun on Vanbrugh's being Clarenceuxherald which the dean supposes enabled him  to build houses  Sir John himself had not a worse reason for being an architect The faults of Blenheim did not escape the severe Dr Evans though he lays them on the master rather than on the builder  The lofty arch his vast ambition shows  The stream an emblem of his bounty flows  These invectives perhaps put a stop to Vanbrugh's being employed on any more buildings for the crown though he was surveyor of the works at Greenwich comptroller general of the works and surveyor of the gardens and waters His other designs were  St John'schurch Westminster a wonderful piece of absurdity  Castlehoward in Yorkshire  Eastberry in Dorsetshire  King'sweston near Bristol  Eastonneston in Northamptonshire  One front of Grimsthorp  Mr Duncomb's in Yorkshire  Two little castles at Greenwich  The Operahouse in the Haymarket  Durable as these edifices are the Relapse the Provoked Wife the Confederacy and Aesop will probably outlast them nor so translated is it an objection to the two last that they were translations If Vanbrugh had borrowed from Vitruvius as happily as from Dancour Inigo Jones  Inigo Jones imitated the taste of the antique but did not copy it so servilely as Palladio Lord Burlington who had exquisite taste was a little too fearful of deviating from his models Raphael Michael Angelo Vignola Bernini and the best Italian architects have dare to invent when it was in the spirit of the standard Perhaps there could not be a more beautiful work than a volume collected and engraved from the buildings and hints of buildings in the pictures of Raphael Albano Pietrò Cortona and Nicolò Poussin It is surprizing that Raphael's works in this manner have not been assembled Besides thoughts in his paintings he executed several real buildings of the truest delicacy  would not be the first architect of Britain  Sir John Vanbrugh died at Whitehall March In his character of architect Dr Evans bestowed on him this epitaph  Lie heavy on him earth for he  Laid many a heavy load on thee  ROBERTI  An architect who built the staircase at Coudray the lord Montacute's Pelegrini painted it  BAGOTTI  Is mentioned by Vertue but not with much justice for admirable execution of a cieling in stucco at Cashiobury lord Essex's seat It represents Flora and other figures and boys in altorelievo supporting festoons  JOHN CROKER  Was bred a jeweller which profession he changed for that of medallist He worked for Harris and succeeding him graved all the medals from the end of king William's reign of whom he struck one large one all those of queen Anne and George the first and those of George the second though Croker died many years before him but none of our victories in that reign were so recorded  APPENDIX
