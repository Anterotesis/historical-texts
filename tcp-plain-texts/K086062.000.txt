 HUMAN HAPPINESS OR THE SCEPTIC  Price THREE SHILLINGS  HUMAN HAPPINESS OR THE SCEPTIC  A POEM IN SIX CANTOS  By THOMAS HOLCROFT AUTHOR OF DUPLICITY A COMEDY  Non satis est risu diducere rictum

J JOHNSON St Paul's ChurchYard J SEWELL Cornhill J FIELDING PaternosterRow and J STOCKDALE Piccadilly  MDCCLXXXIII  CANTO I  ONCE on a time two certain men  No matter much for where and when  Sir Thomas one plain William t'other  A second cousin by the mother  Something between a friend and servant  Of titles and respects observant  Were got in philosophic chat  Of pro and con and this and that  Concerning man his occupations  Pursuits and pleasures plagues and passions  The first of whom this doctrine vented  NO MAN WAS EVER YET CONTENTED  The Knight who held th' affirmative  If we may babbling Fame believe  Tho' no great scholar knew your Greek A  Alpha and so forth to Omega  Had fables read of beasts and birds  Some reason spoke and many words  Saw cause and consequence combin'd  And watch'd the emotions of the mind  Was held in short for one of those  Who know their navel from their nose  And tho' he had not read Confucius  Could feel if pinch'd by old or new shoes  The other whom we William christen'd  Spoke much the loudest when he listen'd  In many cases men of sense  Know silence is good eloquence  And he who means to keep his patron  Must unmolested let him chatter on  Must patient sit and hear his quothing  And get prefer'd for saying nothing  For your dependant like your pointer  Should neither tongue nor limb nor joint stir  But all attentive crouch and watch  Obedient ev'ry signal catch  'Till you've discharg'd your Witsure token  He then may wag his tail and open  William was but a coadjutor  Sir Thomas was chief prolocutor  He half in earnest half in jest  As uppermost ideas prest  Emotions various could provoke  Read how he thought and what he spoke  I say friend William nay I swear  The world's not worth a wise man's care  Not worth though you hold life a blessing  Fatigue of dressing and undressing  Not worth believe me honest Will  The pain of swallowing a pill  Nay life is and I think the figure  Will give my argument some vigor  A dream of phantasies and lies  Which no man wakes from till he dies  Or rather still to speak profounder  From which he wakes by sleeping sounder  A nauseous draught that's never swallow'd  Or by succeeding potions follow'd  An everlasting bitter bolus  Disguis'd to cheat or to condole us  So William till you're laid in hearse  I lie not tho' I speak in verse  You'll have some loathsome pois'nous pill  That shall disgust your palate still  Pray tell me what's this boasted man  But some boy's top or vixen's fan  By passion flirted torn and hurl'd  And spun and whipt about the world  This way and that now there now here  Set up and lash'd by Hope and Fear  For some new gewgaw ever panting  Enjoying nothing all things wanting  Never content with drink and meat  Sufficient for himself to eat  But all he can monopolizes  And picks and culls and gormandizes  Then wallows in th' exhaustless slough  Yet ne'er suspects he has enough  Has something further to desire  If yeoman now he'd next be 'Squire  When 'Squire a Lord when Lord a King  When that why he'd be every thing  Would grasp the globe and for a socket  Compress and put it in his pocket  But could he all things thus command  Chang'd into stone he'd lifeless stand  By Vis Inertiae's magic wand  For only can the Puppet move  Play'd by the wire of dear selflove  When It some pleasure would obtain  Or when 'twould run away from pain  They make It caper simple Fool  Like elephant at dancingschool  Pain heats the floor and flogs like Beadle  While Madam Pleasure plays the fiddle  Shew me the man or small or great  With kingdoms or without estate  A buyer seller loser winner  Philosopher or saint or sinner  No matter for his youth or age  Whether he's simple or he's sage  Of temp'rate or of torrid region  Or what his colour or religion  Shew me the man throughout the earth  Who 'tween his burial and his birth  Could truly say he did possess  A day of perfect happiness  William observe I mean to prove  Our minds are so dispos'd to rove  So much is Fancy giv'n to gadding  For this thing or for that still madding  Impetuous after some new toy  She never gives you time t' enjoy  What God and Industry have sent  But makes your life continual Lent  So eager is she in pursuit  She plucks and throws away the fruit  Or say she should sit still awhile  For half an hour or half a mile  'Tis not her nature to be quiet  And so capricious is her diet  A gocart child or woman breeding  Is not more whimsical in feeding  Nor can your wheedling or your flogging  Keep her consistent in her progging  Quoth Will Sir Thomas how shall I  To such sound arguments reply  Your oratory is so good  I think it cannot be withstood  Yet something which your Worship said  Started a hint if 'tis not fled  Which I'll pursue under correction  And not by way of contradiction  I were an ass to think of that  Your Worship's words come in so pat  Your figures fall so very thick  Like plumbs in pudding Sir they stick  You've such abundant rhetoric  You've learnt by rote all Aristotle  I say then life is like a bottle  Which when uncork'd is full of liquor  That may be emptied slow or quicker  In gentle streams or rude inflations  Impell'd by soft or boist'rous passions  This bottle likewise may contain  Bad vinegar or good Champagne  That is to shew the figure fit  A Misanthrope or man of wit  Hungary water fine and clear  Or muddy stale and flat smallbeer  Your subtile spirits or your mighty  Your aqua fortis aqua vitae  Your fiery spirits or your placid  Your cordial or corroding acid  With many more that I can't think of  Which men and maids do daily drink of  Whence I dare undertake to trace  The likeness of all human race  And first there's bawd and brandy face  Which metaphor more meaning holds  Than the first glance perhaps unfolds  For I dare say you'll own Sir Thomas  When lust and liquor overcome us  Tho' sweet to taste as barleysugar  When slily ta'en in huggermugger  Alike the brandy and the bawd  Will man of health and fame defraud  Hold hold friend William said the Knight  Pull up your horse and take me right  Tho' drunkenness and fornication  Are vices past all disputation  Which when indulg'd deserve recision  Yet with Morality's permission  I sometimes love my thirst to quench  And sure I love a pretty wench  Better by far that niggard Fate  Should man at once annihilate  And out of Nature's reg'ment drum us  Than take that first of pleasures from us  Shall I when the kind turtle's willing  Forego the dear delight of billing  When on my breast her head reclines  And while my eager arm entwines  Around her slender yielding waist  Then when embracing and embrac'd  When I behold impatient grown  Her swelling bosom up and down  Impassion'd heave and pant and sigh  Then when ten thousand transports lie  Within her halfclos'd liquid eye  Of pleasure then shall I be flam'd  No if I am may I be dd  In such a dear delightful season  Shall I ask leave of madam Reason  A prim precise fanatic prude  That bawls out rape if you are rude  That cants and whines and prays and preaches  And hates both petticoats and breeches  That with respect to locomotions  Has such affected queasy notions  Tho' mother Church should grant commission  She'd turn her nose up at cotn  For my part I must freely own  So much have I the flesh and bone  Of father Adam in me cas'd  When th' apple's offer'd I must taste  And 'tis indeed my firm opinion  You'd do the very same my minion  For as for Joseph whom the Jews  Pretend th' Egyptian did refuse  I place it to the lies o' th' nation  Or else an error in translation  Because if you will please to look  In Matthew Chronicles or Luke  You'll find without much pains or pother  How fast these Jews begat each other  And howsoe'er 't may be revil'd  There's but one way to get a child  The seventh and tenth of Nehemiah  Will likewise prove that man a liar  Who should pretend that th' Israelites  Forbore to celebrate Love's rites  And Solomon in all his glory  Took vast delight in rory tory  On which he made so sweet a song  A man might sing it all day long  Again friend William know we not  How sons and daughters were begot  By Isaac Abraham and Lot  And  cntre nous  if I may hint  What may be each day read in print  'Twas sometimes done to make it snugger  In your said way of hugger mugger  For brother sister father daughter  Would eat a cherry if chops did water  It was by this kind of homogeny  King Priam had so vast a progeny  And have not all succeeding ages  Follow'd th' example of these sages  In short the business must be done  Or how should father come by son  And since it can't be done by proxy  Duke must have Dutchess or a doxy  Were these things held in persecution  'Twould overturn the Constitution  For how can he be call'd a free man  Who's not allow'd to have a leman  William who found he'ad trod o' th' corns  Of Letchery drew in his horns  And while Sir Thomas gave the rein  Wholly salacious half profane  To this his twittle twattle vein  Knowing his humour to a hair  Friend William took a different air▪  And often simper'd at the joke  Ere it was understood or spoke  And for he knew 'twould please the Knight  At certain places laugh'd outright  Then when the orator had spun  His wit as far as it would run  Reply'd in recantation quaint  I don't pretend Sir I'm a saint  No if you did rejoin'd the Knight  You'd be a scoundrel hypocrite  Nor are there many people fonder  Than I said Will of  double entendre  Provided it be done quite clean  And fools can't find out what you mean  Your Worship has that happy knack  You're decent yet retain a smack  You slily draw some odd allusion  Yet look as grave as a Carthusian  And then each hint so clean convey'd is  You're quite a fav'rite with the ladies  They always love a merry man  Who makes them laugh behind their fan  Those whom your implications hit  Forgive the sin for sake o' th' wit  Nor ever dream of rods in pickle  When metaphors their fancies tickle  Concerning things which all folks dote on  But yet which can't be spoke or wrote on  Except it be the way you wote on  When Will thought proper thus to knuckle  The Knight forthwith began to chuckle  It put him in a merry mood  To find his wit was understood  Then strait with jocund heart and phrase  Retorted back friend William's praise  For though he wanted not for sense  He like his neighbours could dispense  With all the flattery folks could spare  And more indeed than was his snare  I've often said both here and hence  Cousin you've more than common sense  Tho' faith I cannot chuse but smile  And well I may to think that while  After Miss Tickletail we ran  The theme on which we first began  Is so far lost in this digression  We must snuff hard to scent the question  Howe'er I'm glad our evagation  With these free hints on fecundation  Are but by way of conversation  For were they meant t' appear in print  Tho' I instead of flesh were stint  I would not feel the goosequill rod  No not for fifty pounds by  Which Critic would remorseless thwack  With iteration on my back  True Will replied but here you know Sir  These slips for little or nothing go Sir  The present error's thisyour bent  Has overturn'd your argument  You've prov'd at least while veins are sappy  We're very often very happy  Thanks for the hint return'd the Knight  Instead of wrong I find I'm right  I've no digression made my friend  For now most firmly I contend  It to the argument rejoin'd is  Because I find the case in point is  And though my fancy overheated  This as a solid blessing treated  A very little recollection  Will shew us all its imperfection  Thuswhat we call the greatest pleasure  And value so above all measure  So small a portion of our time  Employs when even in our prime  And makes one look so foolish after  Fit subject or of scorn or laughter  'Twould puzzle a Grecian orator  To prove it worthy living for  Or should you urge more than in doing  The pleasure lies in the pursuing  This I aver doth most provoke us  Because it's all meer hocus pocus  Delights may twinkle in your eye  Num'rous as candles in the sky  Which your Astronomers do hold  Strange as it seems may all be told  But people find whene'er they marry  Their Hymen's heav'n not half so starry  Ma'am Venus ever in mutation  Gives most light at her elongation  Our Venus too without a scoff  Shines brightest when she's farthest off  For Bel a wife and Bel a maid  Are opposite as light and shade  Your women when in hopes of wivery  Appear as they were carv'd of ivory  And though we see they carry noses  They surely smell to nought but roses  But when unloos'd the virgin zone is  Your alabaster flesh and bone is  Your maid of snow some short time a'ter  Melts into frothy muddy water  Will who the Knight's warm temper knew  Look'd as he thought the satire true  But heard like Disputant o'erthrown  His arguments and b'liev'd his own  Suppos'd the cap might fit a slattern  But was no universal pattern  For from most women he survey'd  Whether a widow wife or maid  He deem'd their wit and form and features  Had made them most bewitching creatures  CANTO II  QUOTH William Sir the question rests  Concerning human happiness  The which I think you would deny  That it existsI don't know why  Especially when I reflect  On all the riches and respect  The parks the tenements and manors  The titles ancestry and honours  With every other worldly blessing  All which I see you Sir possessing  Pshaw William you're a simple tony  Because you're poor you think that money  Will exorcise each human evil  And send it packing to the Devil  That nothing could excite your cares  But want or sickness or grey hairs  You'll find friend William to your cost  You've reckon'd here without your host  You little know the freaks and fancies  The ups and downs and pranks and prances  Of Miss Imagination's mare  When frisking forth to take the air  Not troops of witches or of fairies  Sailing to sup on dead man's gizzard  With Lapland or Norwegian wizard  On broomsticks e'er had such vagaries  Or winc'd and winnied cut and caper'd  Half like this Lady when she's vapor'd  This William as you may divine  Is no discovery of mine  'Tis known in every king's dominion  That happiness is but opinion  But since the subject has been started  Somewhat perhaps may be imparted  Tho' we in whifflng squalls do sail  Of whim or humour wit or tale  Of satire argument or pathos  Shall steer us clear of quicksand bathos  T' exemplify what I assert  Once more to Fancy we'll revert  To Fancy that capricious Goddess  Who plays such pranks with human bodies  You've read no doubt for who has not  Who reads not Pope Or has forgot  She once suppos'd herself a pot  In which a Lady made her tea  Or slily kept her ratafia  This arm a kimbo that stretch'd out  She call'd the handle and the spout  And most devoutly begg'd and pray'd  Not to be wash'd by careless maid  Lest she in action of ablution  Should suffer total dissolution  Deeming full sure a broken pate  Were mortal in that fragile state  Another time as authors tell ye  She call'd herself a currant jelly  And squatted crouching quivering quaking  Imploring in most piteous taking  When haunch of ven'son chanc'd to meet her  No hungry Alderman might eat her  A third strange whimwham pray Sir note  She once crept down a cobler's throat  And there the curst fantastic vixen  The simple fellow play'd her tricks on  Swearing in phrases most unhallow'd  Poor Crispin had his lapstone swallow'd  And press'd so hard upon his liver  And took such oaths good God forgive her  And told such lies all to convince  The brain of our distemper'd prince  That had he been or Turk or Jew  He must have thought the thing were true  Another time as I've heard say  She swore she was a truss of hay  And told in wailings and alasses  How she was prey'd upon by asses  Tho' here some add this piece of fun  Was but contriv'd for sake o'th' pun  But I despair to think of half  The tricks she acts to make you laugh  Sometimes she mounts into the head  Of some poor wretch before half mad  There his weak intellect abuses  And swears by G she's one o'th' Muses  And tho' before he did not know it  Himself is out of doubt a poet  Then you shall see him stamp and stare  And look as wise as Moss's mare  And beat his brow and curse his fate  And rub his eyes and scratch his pate  And beg and pray his Polyhymnia  To please to grant a rhyme to chimney  Then strait unbuttons he his doublet  To hammer out unmeaning couplet  About it and about it lingers  And counts his feet upon his fingers  But tho' his thoughts run musically  He cannot somehow make 'em tally  Tho' fifty Loves and Doves are there  Not any two of them will pair  He studies dozes twirls his thumbs  And when at last the butter comes  Enraptur'd at the lucky hit  And all amaz'd at his own wit  Without the help of toe or tarsus  He's at the top of Mount Parnassus  Thus whilst this most insiduous jade  The simple fellow would persuade  That he's the only man i' th' moon  And all the world shall know it soon  That she'll provide him better forage  And give him plumbs to put in's porridge  Likewise or else it shall be curst hard  Will send him mutton to his mustard  That woodcock ortolan and chicken  Are ready roasted for his picking  Thus while he waddles up Fame's ladder  As empty and as big as bladder  Inflated and possess'd by legion  And thinks he soon shall reach the region  Where he'll pss down while they adore him  On all that ever went before him  Instead of finding he's more glorious  Than Bantam King of fame notorious  The dd insidious sly suborner  Hath pill'ried him in poet's corner  Sometimes the wicked hussey steals  Into the head or rather heels  Of a dull cit or weak patrician  And lo behold a politician  See how he runs about the town  Cries this man up and that man down  Gives tongue and toe eternal action  The busiest loudest tool of Faction  Harangues at taverns mounts the table  With piteous phiz prognosticable  Foretels a factby way of fable  He had it from a wise Phrygian  As how an ass  may  spurn a lion  Thus makes his senseless hearers stare  In hopes next night to fill the chair  Thus having first pull'd up his breeches  Unloads most lamentable speeches  From belly warehouse where they lie  Pack'd up and stow'd all cut and dry  Then wipes his eyes and eke his nose  And weeps his bleeding country's woes  For if so be as how because  He's one o'th' guardians of her laws  And then the beetlebrain'd rebuker  Abjures all filthy lust of lucre  And swears so fervently he's honest  He almost thinks himself in earnest  Then prophesies like Jeremiah  Till he makes all his hearers cry ah  Tells how the people are abus'd  What places pensions he refus'd  Of trade declin'd supplies mispent  How farmers cannot pay their rent  How what is most to be lamented  Not one in fifty's represented  How 'tis our duty to combine  T' eradicate or countermine  Prerogative since all may see  Men who are govern'd can't be free  How 'mong a people wise and brave  The King should be the only slave  How might he carry on the farce  He'd strip him bare as a bird's ase  Of sceptres crowns and glories garish  And send him packing to his parish  Then vents he mouthfuls of big breath  Of traitors Towerhill and death  So many necks has he to stretch  You'd think th' infatuated wretch  Were Lord Chief Justiceor Jack Ketch  Not Welch itself by Welchmen utter'd  Was e'er with more vehemence sputter'd  His words so singe you as they sally  You'd swear he'd wildfire in his belly  Or that the hissing quacking gander  Maintain'd incog a salamander  But should you from these fumes of reason  Subtract hems epithets and treason  Of all this wond'rous waste of brains  You'd quickly find that nought remains  Friend William didst thou e'er behold  A flock of sheep pent in a fold  And didst thou see when thou wert gazing  The shepherd turn them out a grazing  If so thou couldst not chuse but note  How stupidly within their cote  Like wond'ring clown withoh laa  These sheep have stood and bleated Ba  And how they wanted 'mid their moping  The instinct to begin eloping  How they'd not stir a single foot  'Till crook or cur had set 'em to't  But when the first had pass'd the hurdle  A man of Gotham might as soon  Forth from a fishpond rake the moon  As keep them in their twiggen girdle  William just so your patriot sheep  Will from their torpid stupor leap  And bound o'er every proper fence  Of law of loyalty and sense  Soon as some knave adroit and knowing  Has set the stupid flock agoing  This William give me leave to say  Of all the whims in Fancy's pate  Will most to wickedness betray  Those whom it shall contaminate  And yet methinks I've heard you plead  Said Will as tho' it were your creed  With wond'rous force of elocution  In favour of the constitution  As tho' you would gain proselytes  To struggle for the people's rights  Have heard you vow with iteration  Indeed with awful imprecation  To see them violated rather  With your own hand you'd stab your father  Ay quick return'd the impetuous Knight▪  May plagues and perils infinite  May ev'ry pest Hell could supply  O'erwhelm my house and me if I  Tho' I detest the horrid fact  Would not this tragedy enact  E'er seehowe'er th' accursed crime were mourn'd  E'er seethe Constitution overturn'd  But when a Monarch fills the throne  Whom even Faction's self must own  Is anxious still in Virtue's cause  And holds inviolate those laws  Which are the comments of his pow'r  His guide his sword his shield his tow'r  A Monarch merciful and just  Who so reveres his sacred trust  That rather than o'erstep the mound  By which he's circumscrib'd and bound  He patient hears audacious grown  The traitor's speech approach the throne  Forgets to gain his people's love  Revenge which Pity would approve  Feels the black hand of Malice press  With tenfold weight nor seeks redress  But takes the noblest way to Fame  Abhorrent of the tyrant's name  When virtues such as these preside  Shall I with venom'd tongue deride  Or labour with unhallow'd hand  To sow dissension thro' the land  Shall I become a nation's scourge  With frontless damn'd ambition urge  An ignorant and headstrong rage  And every knave and fool engage  To bawl for me and spread sedition  Regardless of mankind's perdition  And for some partial private good  Plunge thus a weeping world in blood  Tear the poor peasant from his home  And send the widow to the tomb  Nations make waste and desolate  That once were happy rich and great  Oh curst oh doubly curst be he  Who thus from human pity free  Disclaiming Nature's social ties  Deaf to a suffering people's cries  Sinks millions that himself may rise  Gives War and Devastation birth  And hurls Destruction o'er the earth  My heart's appall'd My blood runs cold  Methinks affrighted I behold  Insatiate Rage by Discord led  Where Faction shakes her snaky head  The yell of Death howls in my ear  Lo brother's blood their hands besmear  Their garments dy'd in matron's gore  By children slain whom once they bore  Vain are the virgin's streaming eyes  The groans of age and orphan's cries  No help the mother's shrieks obtain  The kneeling wife implores in vain  Where Rape defil'd her sacred bed  Her husband mangled lies and dead  No tears could stay th' impending blow  Fell Discord mocks at human woe  Remorseless gives the fatal stab  And views the vital fountain ebb  Beholds the writhing infant die  Hears Nature utter her last cry  Reviews the havoc she has made  Her prowess arm and clotted blade  Exults recounts each mortal thrust  Each act of carnage and of lust  With horrid pleasure sucks the parting breath  Then flies to seek new scenes of blood and death  These are thy deeds from thee they sprung  Thy ranc'rous heart and clam'rous tongue  Oh Faction most accursed siend  War Discord Slaughter Rage conven'd  Bad'st them their hellish flags unfurl'd  Proclaim thee Mistress of the World  Oh William could a single hand  But drive that Daemon from the land  Were itbut ah the wish is vain  A tyrant's veins the steel may drain  A Demagogue is never slain  For while the fire funereal flashes  A hundred rise from forth his ashes  But let us quit the dismal theme  'Tis painful William in th' extreme  This only I intreat you'll note  Not one example I can quote  More firmly proves my first position  That is the hapless inhibition  Which Fancy lays or more or less  On what's call'd human happiness  When Passions violent as these  Once on the restless bosom seize  Labours vexations cares and fears  Increase still with encreasing years  CANTO III  NOW let us once again proceed  With Madam Fancy and her breed  Of airy visions in the brain  But this much let me first explain  I can't perhaps at all times stay  The application to convey  If with the subject I should wax warm  Take this then as a general axiom  There's not an instance I shall cite  Of Miss Imagination's flight  But tends to prove how more or less  She cheats us of our happiness  Remember this and be aware on't  For tho' it often seem apparent  That she on some delight is feeding  Or is with joy and pleasure breeding  She swells as presently you'll find  Either with water or with wind  Or else with many a strange contortion  Brings forth an embrio in abortion  The only comfort she is skill'd in  Is that fine art call'd Castlebuilding  Pursuing which sometimes she'll rise  Ten thousand leagues above the skies  And ere you'd empty Mah'met's pitcher  Find fifty thousand whims bewitch her  There will the busy brainsick fool  Among th' immortals place her stool  But on so ticklish a foundation  The slightest jog of pain or passion  Strait tumbles down my antimentor  Ten thousand leagues below the center  Should you demand the reason why  She sinks so low and soars so high  Is strong yet feeble quick yet slow  I'll tell you Williamwhen I know  Anon invited by the weather  She'll perch upon an ostrich feather  Whence she'll persuade with wheedling air  Some maid to pin it in her hair  And there to pay her thanks and duty  She sits and forms the line of beauty  Waves curtsies nods and bows to please  Each welldress'd passenger she sees  Hoping to find that man in distress  Who does not long to kiss her mistress  And should the dear bewitching maid  But take her to a Masquerade  Or jig her tail down at a Court dance  She swells to see her own importance  The posture which you put your lip in  Tells me you think you've caught me tripping  That vice versa to my plan  I'm proving now my goose a swan  But though you think you're Signior Slyboots  I'm coming with a pair of dry puts  And first friend William pray declare  Had Fancy coax'd the gentle fair  Some social duty to sustain  Instead of bidding her be vain  And ogle ev'ry petit maitre  Had not her pleasure been much greater  Againpray did you never find  From observations on your mind  When you've been dup'd into applause  By crowns and sceptres made of straws  Have ran to seize hot and impetuous  Some whizgig of an ignisfatuus  Have call'd a council on your cloaths  And plac'd a patch beside your nose  That you might rival certain beaus  To prove yourself the drunkard's match  Have clapt and chorus'd ev'ry catch  And roar'd and been damnation jolly  Lest you had been outdone in folly  When back conducted by reflection  To reason and to recollection  I say with most abundant gall  Abjur'd you not the midnight brawl  Deplor'd you not your time thus fled  At ev'ry throbbing of your head  And curst in ev'ry various shape  The fops and fools you strove to ape  While strenuous thus Sir Thomas pleads  Will smiles assentthe Knight proceeds  Sometimes our minx of grandeur vain  Is seated in a lady's train  While fops behind and fops before  Surround attend her and adore  And with a civet cat's assistance  The rabble keep at awful distance  There like our Monarch heav'n bless him  When Commoncouncilmen address him  She hears with dignity their speeches  With mildness answers each demand  Then strait presents her lady's hand  And bids them kiss and grow like leeches  Or rather like with cannon's rouse  The King proceeding to the House  For thus with mien majestical  She spreads the flowing garment round  And as it slowly sweeps the ground  Is drawn in state along the Mall  But if her reason to recall  A little rain should chance to fall  Asham'd of her fantastic feats  She shrinks and hides her in the plaits  Most cursedly chagrin'd to hear  Miss Daggletail hiss in her ear  Oft with  ad inquirendum  big  She squats down on a Judge's wig  And hears with most affected patience  Rejoinders bully replications  Thinks it behoveth her to stay  Tho' 'twere 'till resurrection day  Most solemnly to hear 'em argu' on  But tir'd at last of law and jargon  She tells my Lord its very late  Or tickling makes him scratch his pate  And shake his wellfill'd wig about her  Then skulks off in a shower of powder  In graceful shape you'll sometimes see her  Pendant at Miss or Madam's ear  Sit bragging how she has the art  To deck that unimportant part  To prove which farther still she goes  And bobs about a Banyan's nose  But if a cold should seize her vassal  And rheum should run down sewer nasal  No dog more simple phyz e'er put on  When he was bid beware of mutton  Of this see more if you desire  Cantus Secundus Matthew Prior  Who to his most harmonious lyre  Sang something like the present song  And sang so various sweet and long  I'm troubled with my notes jejune  To keep from strumming Matthew's tune  Observe my friend before my next  Remark I chuse to change my text  I chuse to call our old parole  IMAGINATION now THE SOUL  The dictionary search you'll find  SOUL is synonimous to MIND  And MIND is with IMAGINATION  The same thing held throughout the nation  And seeing Will I speak in rhyme  Of subjects vulgar and sublime  I'll wrest the word or phrase to  my  sense  That isI'll take poetic licence  I tergiverse as you shall see  But let that rest 'tween you and me  To introduce a similie  The body's an ingenious house  The soula sort of little mouse  That through some chink or cranny enters  And seldom into daylight ventures  But duly takes her midnight ramble  In zigzag motionsskimble skamble  Is found nocturnally eloping  Whene'er the door the mouth is open  And scuds and gibbers in the glades  To fright your clownish men and maids  And frisks and glides about the bed  And often makes my Lady dread  She hears a thiefor sees a sprite  And ring her bell and strike a light  When strait the cause of all her fears  Jumps down her throat and disappears  This mouse herself both day and night  Is also often in a fright  For not to mention mynheer rat  She swoons if you should name a cat  By rat and cat no doubt you ween  I Hope and Fear friend William mean  Who keep such watch o'er madam's diet  She scarce can mump a crust in quiet  But goes with divers fears and pains to't  Although she's hid behind the wainscot  And though the foe's not under arms  She's always subject to alarms  For why she oft has felt their claws  When farthest as she deem'd from paws  And when she thought to lick her chaps  Has many times been caught in traps  When least she dreamt of such mishaps  CANTO IV  MY similie is at an end  To Fancy we'll return my friend  Sometimes she'll take it in her head  To sit and muse among the dead  And then before your eye could twinkle  She'll hop to th' charnelhouse and sprinkle  Some favorite friend's unconscious bones  And hear again his dying groans  And kiss his lips and catch his sighs  And cleanse his brow and close his eyes  And wring her hands and rend her hair  In all the horrors of despair  As when she caught his parting breath  In the last agonies of death  Nor are such griefs to her ideal  With Fancy every thing is real  Which gives occasion to your sceptic  Or rather to herself to deem  From these emotions epileptic  That she exists but in a dream  That soul and body matter and spirit  With all which men think they inherit  To which they give such fond reception  Is nothing but a meer deception  I can't said William I protest  Conceive such things except in jest  Have ever enter'd mortal head  Have ever yet been sung or said  Then pray inform me by what token Sir  I shall gain certainty fair spoken Sir  Replied Sir Thomas or what sign  Shall bring conviction friend of mine  That I am now with you debating  And 'gainst the post exonerating  Or though I think I make it shake  I shall not shortly start and wake  Why Sir last night in my first sleep  I at my spigot end did weep  Observe when stomach too replete is  I'm subject to your diabetes  Which though the bed it will besmear  Is sweeter than your diarrhoea  I say I stood against the wall  And saw and heard the water fall  It could not be behind the curtain  So well convinc'd was I and certain  But more to prove it to the million  I wrangled with my own postillion  Dar'd the best man that e'er wore head  To prove that I then pt the bed  And yet for all my fending feats  Molly was forc'd to change the sheets  At least so did I after deem  For so depos'd my waking dream  But which was right or which was wrong  To your Logicians doth belong  From Mr Minor and Mr Major  By consequent or else by wager  These doubts and darkness to dispel  For I'll be dd if I can tell  AgainI dreamt one night before  As I was standing at my door  A woman camea frightful figure  And of a pistol held the trigger  Her hands were bloodyshe would enter  And as I follow'd to prevent her  From strangling my beloved Nancy  She striding forward to my fancy  Just then as I with fear was fainting  I look'd and found her head was wanting  And now my courage had forsook me  Another terror overtook me  Instead of Nancy's massacre  I found that I had murder'd her  For being headless it was plain  She had by somebody been slain  So dreading to be left i' th' lurch  I made a skip to top o' th' Church  And on the steeple sat me down  And laugh'd and look'd about the town  Here I was seiz'd anew with fright  For meditating on the height  And seeing nothing on the wall  That I could catch to save my fall  I found by calculation true  As I look'd down and took a view  E'er I could light in streets or lanes  'Twas odds that I dash'd out my brains  Now for a moment I forgot  If I had being or had not  Then found myself upon my feet  And walking up a spacious street  But ere I could proceed much further  Was taken up and hung for murder  To Sweeps and Sandmen did exhibit  A body dangling to a gibbet  And now I was not only vex'd  But somehow damnably perplex'd  To think on finding I was dead  What I should do to get my bread  But in the midst of all this thrall  I jump'd from thence to Surgeon's Hall  Where I beheld a row of fellows  That just were taken from the gallows  Illlooking ragged vile companions  And strung all round like ropes of onions  By wires hung pendant as their wont is  'Tween  os occipitis et frontis  And here instead of being dissected  I see those operations acted  My  perinaeum  shrinks to note 'em  I clap my hand upon my  scrotum  And view the while my flesh doth quiver  Now this man's heart then that man's liver  No mortal yet by day or night  Ever beheld more shocking sight  Yet they're alive nor are they screaming  But wrangling singing and blaspheming  From mouths that with most ghastly grin  Tobacco take and beg for gin  And here amidst this scene of terrors  I feel insufferable horrors  I fly oppress'd with dreadful gloom  To every corner of the room  From this man start and jerk from t'other  Then bob my back against another  Swifter than ball in Tenniscourt  'Till Nature can no more support  But shrieks with violent agitation  And waking saysits suffocation  Or swears some fiend her rest was troubling  Some Nightmare Witch or glum Hobgoblin  One other vision give me leave  Among my arguments to weave  I went one night about eleven  To bedor ratherwent to Heaven  'Twas in the latter end of spring  My heart was light as Woodlark's wing  My health was good my spirits better  My mind without a single fetter  By cares nor crosses was I teaz'd  Nor spleen nor passion on me seiz'd  I mean to say I felt just then  What happiness is call'd by men  I cannot give sufficient cause  I only know that so it was  And that such feelings as it seems  Do gen'rate most delightful dreams  I went to bed then thus dispos'd  And as I guess not long had doz'd  Before I fell by some blest chance  Into a kind of heav'nly trance  Unconscious I of sleep or bed  No pillow now supports my head  Nor bolts nor bars nor walls restrain  Nor heavy limbs my soul detain  But gliding on by swift degrees  I seem to be where'er I please  I lightly leap o'er brook or briar  And stepas far as I desire  Anon on lofty hill I stand  View the green corn and furrow'd land  See mountain valley wood and mead  And shepherd stray and cattle feed  And distant hills and waters spy  That glitter pleasure to the eye  While the sweet landscape doth unite  Innumerous objects of delight  Then quick as thought they instant take  The form of an extensive lake  In amphitheatre capacious  A flat of waters bright and spacious  Which Fancy quickly scatters o'er  With islands towns and many a shore  Where verdure smiles and men are seen  And happy Nature plays serene  Here while I view the water's gleam  I find myself amid the stream  And as the gentle current glides  My active thought my body guides  To ship or shore now there now here  Sportive and undisturb'd by fear  And as the waters we embrace  I vagrant roam from place to place  And as I lave each happy limb  And strike and dart and lightly skim  I think good God how well I swim  While thus supine I lie anon  I twinkle and the whole is gone  The scene is chang'd no more appear  Or ships or towns or islands near  No more the chrystal waves are seen  Two tow'ring mountains I'm between  Prodigious in their height and size  Their summits lie beyond the skies  Their magnitude new wonder brings  From which a pleasing grandeur springs  Such vast immensity before  The face of Nature never wore  Nor e'er in me till now did blend  Such happy pow'rs to comprehend  While down the winding vale I stray  Upon an ivory pipe I play  A various and delightful lay  My fingers touch as though they flew  Each note's so sweet and yet so new  I play and listen to the sound  From rock to rock I lightly bound  Sweet echos ev'ry cavern fill  While my agility and skill  A mixture breed of strange surmize  Of doubt of pleasure and surprize  Encourag'd by the past I try  If it be possible to fly  When strange to think with utmost ease  I sail adown the pleasant breeze  Amazement new and new demur  Again and yet again recur  Have I my former self forgot  Or is it meor is it not  Again I try again I find  My body lighter than the wind  Till wanton grown with joy and mirth  I spurn the bosom of the earth  Into the middle region mount  And cities seas and kingdoms count  Strait recollect and now behold  Whate'er I'ad read or had been told  My mind my sight my soul expand  I view the near and distant land  Each object see examine all  And understand both great and small  The freedom too with which I range  Is more extatic than 'tis strange  When as I high and higher fly  Sudden appear throughout the sky  Horses and men in glittering arms  And nought is heard but war's alarms  The warm bright sun in splendant glances  Plays quivering on their burnish'd lances  Yet as I view the shining steel  No sense of danger do I feel  To win renown I now aspire  And glow with all the hero's fire  My arm bears vict'ry I presage  But ere the armies can engage  I look again when lo the host  Is all in dancing meteors lost  Still Night appears and Luna's beams  And light shoots o'er the sky in gleams  But how shall I find words to tell  What William after this befel  Conceive me sailing still on high  That swifter than the winds I fly  That now I feel a tempest rise  In which I'm tost about the skies  Which are with clouds and gloom o'ercast  A trumpet blows a solemn blast  Then in the murky hemisphere  Myriads of seraphim appear  That all the heav'ns illuminate  And joys unfelt before create  They cry aloud"THE GENERAL DOOM  THE DAY OF RESURRECTION'S COME"  And lo as down my sight I bend  Th' inhabitants of earth ascend  In swarms they rise from latest time  From ev'ry nation ev'ry clime  The quick and dead of ev'ry coast  Now smiling meet the angelic host  All upward now their course pursue  'Till heav'n itself appears in view  'Till the fam'd music of the spheres  Salutes our ravish'd wond'ring ears  But William just as I believe  No pow'r can me of bliss bereave  Just as th' eternal gates unfold  And past conceiving I behold  The glories I must soon partake  Williamjust thenalasI wake  Suddenly thus my hopes were gone  In less time than St Paul's strikes one  And all because such was my lot  Before I went to sleep godwot  A certain duty I forgot  Thus while I had my heavenly trances  My Lady had her earthly fancies  Thus while I floated in the air  She restless tumbling here and there  With her sharp elbow spoil'd my mirth  And cast me down from heav'n to earth  Oh could I but my friend have tarried  In this blest placebut I was married  And women Will are very loath  Men should feel joys not felt by both  Just so Eurydice I've read  Brought down her spouse among the dead  On earth she would not let him dwell  While she was forc'd to live in Hell  CANTO V  CUZ' I've related all these visions  To help our logical decisions  From which I can't but draw conclusion  That all is chaos and confusion  That I'm as well convinc'd each night  As the next day that I am right  In walking can no more confide  Than when on "wings of winds I ride"  The consequence of which I take is  That whether man asleep or 'wake is  His happiness whate'er it seem  Is full as false as any dream  How often pray are we mistaken  When we conclude we're really waking  How often does each simple bustard  Firmly believe ricepudding custard  And is not ev'ry term that's us'd  Still liable to be abus'd  A relative that has no standard  That may mean  rear  when it says  van  guard  What you intend by sweet and sour  By short and long by day and hour  Are but significant and true  When felt by me as felt by you  You may affirm the ven'son sweet  I swear it is not fit to eat  Some liquorice love and others lacker  Their grinders with quid of tobacco  Your birds of passage fly with ease  From land to land across the seas  From Dover Cliff to th' church at Dieppe  Your swallows say is but a step  But ask a snail or slowworm either  How long they'd be in crawling thither  In Lapland if I'm told aright  Summer is day and Winter night  Then how can you in terms be clear  If half a day be half a year  Whatever may be said at college  SENSATION is the source of knowledge  Our tongue eyes nose and ears perceptive  Taste colour smell and sound make captive  These bring the various wares they deal in  And stock their great emporium FEELING  But then they're all so curst conceited  They everlastingly are cheated  Are so deceiving and deceiv'd  They ne'er deserve to be believ'd  So simple are and void of art  They'll take the veriest juggler's part  Wou'd Breslaw help them to trepan Sir  Then hang him for a necromancer  William whose tongue began to itch  Thought he who such attention paid  To ev'ry thing Sir Thomas said  Might be allow'd to make a speech  Then with a look a little sly  Return'd the Knight this answer dry  Men Sir may play you very odd tricks  Who have but small skill in dioptrics  Ev'n I here simple as I stand  Can make the shadow of my hand  Spread over many a rood of land  For place a candle out at night  Your trav'ler oft its twinkling light  Will fix his distant longing eyes on  While it illumes the whole horizon  But let me curve my hand around it  The light's all lost and who hath found it  Why Sir my hollow palm 'tis plain  Doth miles and miles of light contain  And most ungenerous too doth hide  The weary wand'rer's hope and guide  By which you mean to hint no doubt  I've put your farthing candle out  Or at the best my cousin comrade  What light you have I would obumbrate  But I can prove by reading Clerkly  From Leibnitz Malbranche Bayle and Berkley  Things far more strange friend Will than these  Can prove whenever you shall please  The mite is larger than the cheese  That howsoever you suppose  You do not walk behind your nose  That there's not water in the sea  Enough to make a dish of tea  That when he drinks your guzzling sot  Don't touch the handle or the pot  Nay more can prove without your candle  There's neither drink sot pot or handle  Your Philomath with philology  Quoth Will I grant doth often dodge ye  At hide and seek Sir intellectual  To make your errors more effectual  'Mong A's and B's so snug will hide him  Tho' you look near him and beside him  Tho' fifty times you've round him gallop'd  So close in mystery he's invellop'd  That tho' by hearing him you wind him  The devil a bit Sir can you find him  My understanding so obtuse is  I own I cannot find the uses  Of all these arguments to shew  We nothing are and nothing know  Were oracles by Wisdom utter'd  Still we must think our bread is butter'd  Whatever Sceptics may imagine us  When tongue and fingers are ol'aginous  And for this part o'th' argument  I quote from you Sir precedent  "These things to us are not ideal  With Fancy every thing is real"  For what to me Sir would it matter  Altho' my wine were really water  If as it trickled down my gullet  It gave me mirth and pleas'd my palate  Nay sure Sir 'twould be very rude  Or worse 'twould be ingratitude  If while I drink it at your table  I should affirm 'twere nought but fable  Your learned folks are oft such fools  And know so little of their tools  When they chop logic silly elves  They're apt to hack and hew themselves  Whence some deduce from proofs like these  That ign'rance is a blest disease  That he who after knowledge lingers  But grasps a flame and burns his fingers  And his ambitious folly shews  Like whelps that yelp and run at crows  Hark you friend Will you're last suggestion  Is quite on my side of the question  Since ignorance is despicable  And makes who has it one o'th' rabble  And learning is still something worse  You've form'd one comprehensive curse  More vast and certain to engulph us  Than that erst utter'd by Ernulphus  The more we search the more we find  We're feeble foolish vain and blind  This only certain seems to be  We're all absurd uncertainty  Our joys are false and false our tears  False are our hopes and false our fears  Our pleasure like the rainbow shews  Then only beauteous when not close  Tho' glorious in its shining birth  It seems to reach from heav'n to earth  Approach to touch it and you'll see  'Twill vanish in nonentity  I own said Will I'm at a loss  You press the point so very close  You scarely can be contradicted  Yet I don't wish to be convicted  For tho' with you I cannot cope  So much my int'rest 'tis to hope  The joys my young imagination  Foretold should follow in rotation  Each after each as life advances  Were truthsI'm loth to think them trances  But granting all as false and vain  As meteors caus'd by sun and rain  Tho'  active  pleasures should beguile 'em  Men may in  passive  find asylum  YOU Sir whose wellprovided boat  Blest Independence keeps afloat  While she thus condescends to steer  What tempests have YOU Sir to fear  She with expert and jocund crew  Weathers all winds that ever blew  Should tow'ring Pride contemptuous think her  And make her strike It could not sink her  Malice may shoot but cannot shake her  Lame Poverty can ne'er o'ertake her  While Labour Learning Genius all  Are ever ready at her call  Happy by her to be employ'd  Thrice happy if by her enjoy'd  From whence you argue Cousin Will  At least we're easy when we're still  That when kind heav'n has sent us meat  We've only to sit down and eat  But when the passions are in chace  It then may prove a silly race  Like as the  hind  legs of a hound  May run o'er many a league of ground  To catch the  fore  but they're mistaken  When they lie down they're overtaken  Whence I conjecture you profess  That apathy is happiness  That he whose wishes breed no riot  Is comfortable good and quiet  To such a one I'd grant at most  He's just as happy as a post  His goodness likewise be it said  Is like a wife's without her head  Who tho' her humours never teize you  Her kisses are not like to please you  For she 'tis held who has no mouth  Will neither kiss nor quench her drowth  For this friend William I contend  Better had man his being end  And die at once since die he must  Than with inanity to rust  Better than thus to mope and doze  Feel pangs from fingers down to toes  Better than thus to sit hum drum  Like country schoolmaster become  Who hammers at each stupid cub  To teach him ab eb ib ob ub  And midst a squawling wrangling crew  Doth everlastingly pursue  His dd dull ba be bi bo bu  CANTO VI  YET sure said Will Sir some of those  Whom Fame as Nature's wonders shews  Who high in honours high in birth  Rever'd for sacred virtue's worth  Whose deeds descent and merits are  Held equally renown'd and rare  Or those whose fortunes some blest chance  Conspir'd with Genius to advance  And gave what Genius deems his due  A seat among th' immortal few  Sure those brave spirits who when fled  Were ever call'd the mighty dead  Whose actions grace the scroll of Fame  Sure those to happiness had claim  And 'tis an axiom long in use  Like causes like effects produce  From whence friend Will you would infer  Some men  are  blest because some  were  But this wont pass my cunning stager  Imprimis  I deny your major  These mighty dead of whom you puff  And think you ne'er can brag enough  Nor your trull Fame whose cheeks are bloated  Like bladders on which boys have floated  Stuft out and cramm'd with lies enormous  About her slashing swashing Hectors  Her grim MandragonsPlusquamperfectors  Of suffering man the curst dissectors  But who's more silent than a dormouse  Concerning private worth and action  Or if she speak speaks in detraction  These bullfac'd brazenheaded Messieurs  Wholesale and retail human graziers  These manflesh butchers with their flyflops  These Anthropophaginian Cyclops  That tap who never had the Hydrops  These Cacodaemons I maintain Sir  Of whom both she and you are vain Sir  As subject were to flux or cancer  As you or I or any man Sir  As liable to puke and be sick  When they were order'd to take physic  As much would scratch and writhe and groan  At itch gripes gravel gout or stone  With screw'dup phiz would grunt and twistOh la  When they were cutting for a fistula  Would faint as soon if for a scotomy  The Doctor should prescribe phlebotomy  As much would caper curse and kick  When needle under nail did stick  As much were tortur'd by braintumours  I mean as captious in their humours  Would fret and fume and be as fractious  As drunken chymneysweeps or blackshoes  Would break the crockery spill the grey peas  And cuff their wives and whip their babies  Burn tables stools and chairs to cinders  And toss the house out at the windows  Would pinch bite scratch snarl scold or squabble  Like Billinsgate or Ragfair rabble  Methinks I hear one of these heroes  Who little better were than Neros  Wrangling with Ma'am and domineering  Bullying at this at that thing sneering  Cry"Dn your puddingdn your beef  "And dn your sobbing sniveling grief  "Damme I'd rather munch a dry crust  "Alone than live with you on piecrust  "For neither you your soup or sallad  "Are made at all to please my palate"  If Ma'am replies he lays the lash on  And with his hair erect with passion  Out issues he brimful of ire  Snorts swords breathes brimstone and spits fire  Snuffs gunpowder rips up red coats  Cuts you some fifty thousand throats  Leaves not a rat cat hog or dog an eye  But cleaves them as you'd cleave mahogany  Vineyards and fields devours in malice  And quaffs hot blood in scullscoop'd chalice  Then vaunts his most pernicious pranks  And looks dead who don't give him thanks  Annihilates Tuum and Meum  Commands the priest to chant Te Deum  And like Drawcansir bluffly swears  "All this he does because he dares"  Good Sir said Will I ne'er suppos'd  Content by such folks was engross'd  Far other men were in my guess  Whom every age and people bless  Who useful arts the nations taught  Or who for Freedom bravely fought  Who first with ploughshare broke the glebe  Or pass'd the shuttle thro' the web  He who conducted lovely Truth  And Science to the haunts of Youth  Aptly their pleasing lore convey'd  And all their wond'rous gifts display'd  Of such I spokeor he whose song  Charm'd and reform'd the listening throng  Who as the ringing harp he swung  Rais'd his sweet voice and rapid tongue  In phrase most fit and lofty verse  The deeds of heroes to rehearse  Of heroes who by Virtue claim'd  Among th' immortal Gods are nam'd  Who as along the numbers roll'd  The laws of Nature could unfold  Or with a sad and piteous tale  The man of iron could assail  Or when Oppression durst provoke  In thunder to the passions spoke  Their headlong rage would strait controul  "And freeze and harrow up the soul"  How oft friend Will reply'd the Knight  Am I oblig'd to set you right  Again repeating and again  Men ever were and will be men  Why must I tell you no man yet  That Eve and Adam could beget  This to your memory pray recall  Adam and Eve begat us all  For in their primary endeavour  World without end for ever and ever  The blacks and whites and those of copper  Were ground out of our Granny's hopper  Such is the orthodoxy dixit  And dd be he who contradicts it  No man is freed from Fate's mischances  Except in novels and romances  The brightest characters have blots  The sun itself is full of spots  Which as I guess ar'n't very young  Yet have not been discover'd long  In fact our eyes are oft so feeble  They'd overlook the parish steeple  And tho' sent forth to search and mind it  Return and say they could not find it  You see these folks thro' a dark lantern  And still most carefully your hand turn  Full on each face to throw the light  Then wonder how it came so bright  So once a painter in supposes  The radiance drew of grandsire Moses  And when he'd done so says the story  Fell down and worshipp'd his own glory  But for a Christian cuckolds scorns  He quite forgot to add the horns  Tho' Jews with reverence be it spoken  Hold horns a magisterial token  Which is the reason say the witty  Why Jews do mostly live i'th' city  But to our textI say once more  All's not divine that men adore  Your Germans bow to Jacob Behmen  Your Greeks Sir reverence Philopaemon  Saint Januarius keeps at Naple  A market where he's always staple  Your Russian is tied down to th' grindstone  Of Nicholases holy millstone  Some love th' eleven hundred virgins  Your Jews and Turks are circumsurgeons  And he who dares be het'rodox  Had better get the plague or px  For priests in all lands preach and pray  Not to convince but get the day  Or what is better still the pay  And tho' some bid each humble brother  When smote on one cheek to turn t'other  Oppos'd themselves they still incline 'em  To  Argumentum Bacculinum  And he's puff'd down who their fine flams scorns  Like Jericho at blast of ramshorns  Will star'd and cry'd Sir whither verge you  You're not a foe sure to the Clergy  That Will depends on circumstances  I'm no man's foe who peace advances  Who mild and gentle strives to win  Not  to  opinionbut  from  sin  Who like the Parson of old Dryden  Would scorn Oppression's back to ride on  Who can suppose a Turk may be  Almost as good a man as he  And that opinions with salvation  Are not allied in any nation  That tho' a man were so absurd  As not to b'lieve a single word  O'th' stuff with which some folks are cram'd  There yet are hopes he may'nt be damn'd  Or let's suppose what's still absurder  Since supposition is no murder  One who has faith in all the fictions  The fables lies and contradictions  That e'er were broach'd from Folly's mouth  Between the North pole and the South  Who'd worship MoIock God of Ammon  Or dance to Tomtom round Ramraman  Pay Mumbojumbo adoration  Hold Pawaws in vast veneration  Believe i'th' navelstring of Brama  Eat holy dung of Dalay Lama  Credit the tale of St Gelasias  As much as Creed of Athanasius  Resolving to have faith in all  Lest men him heretic should call  The Priest who'd hope my love to win  Must think e'en this no mortal sin  With points of doctrine must dispense  From who've too much or little sense  Provided they to others do  As they wish to be done unto  Must still preserve that simple plan  Which his meek Master first began  On human hearts must make invasion  By gentleness and mild persuasion  Nor think to cure the mind of maggots  By purging it with fiery faggots  Nor must pretend if me he'd please  To supernat'ral extasies  But must be as sincere as kind  This brings an anecdote to mind  Concerning an irreverend Friar  Miraclemonger therefore liar  A relic juggler most rapacious  Of life luxurious and salacious  Who watch'd a wooden virgin's shrine  And was by fools suppos'd divine  It chanc'd one Summer where he dwelt  The heavens did not that year melt  As usual in refreshing showers  To chear the thirsty languid flowers  Hence 'twas much fear'd the gasping earth  Would feel a universal dearth  Hence too did selfish Superstition  To heav'n send many a vague petition  But in the midst of this her grief  Our Friar promis'd her relief  If to his shrine she'd make procession  The clouds should likewise make emission  For so said he the holy mother  Has told me your unworthy brother  Well Sirthe farce is underta'en  When lo it strait begins to rain  A Miracle the people cry  A Miracle resounds on high  The gaping crowd run here and there  And tell of angels made of air  Trot home for off'rings not a few  To pay old scores as well as new  And as they bring their glad oblations  Recount their many obligations  And how the Virgin did inspire  With prophecy her holy Friar  While he applauds his dext'rous wit  And laughs to think how fools are bit  You ask how he could here deceive  I'll tell you if you'll give me leave  Not by his faith did he foretell  His want of faith did just as well  His lust and former fornication  Supplied the place of Revelation  For nought of Heav'n or Hell more true is  Than that the Friar had a Lues  Of ten years standing at the least  Which us'd to twinge the unclean beast  And taught him from his pangs to gather  Prognostics of a change of weather  Which cheat this reverend chaste divi e  Discover'd to his concubine  And she being tickled with the joke  Told it to all with whom she spoke  While those who heard fail'd not to scoff it  And say the px had made a prophet  You seem to wonder where I'll end  And whither all these windings tend  I'll tell you Will they form a mirror  That shews men lost in fogs of error  They tend to prove my first position  THAT HAPPINESS IS ALL A VISION  A shadow which men keep in view  That runs as fast as they pursue  Stands when they stand winds when they wind  Sometimes before sometimes behind  At all attempts to catch it mocks  And ne'er was brought t'an Equinox  At no one moment would allow  A man to say  I have thee now  They tend to shew that life at best  As saith Dan Gay is but a jest  A candle where fresh tumors sprout  Which to remove is oft snuff▪d out  By Law or Honour Rope or Sword  As Judge or General gives the word  And he has sure a lucky snuffing  Who's cropt from cradle into coffin  And should you think these doctrines vain  Hear Will the moral they contain  So short a time are mortals twirl'd  About this transitory world  For he who tarries longest in it  Can scarce be said to live a minute  So little do we truly know  What shall bring future weal or woe  Such trifles are the things we prize  In Truth and sober Reason's eyes  So futile and incompetent  To make one blessing permanent  That he who'd ignominious live  For any good this world can give  Would condescend to recollect  The loss of Worth and Worth's respect  Or to obtain some private end  To guilt or meanness could descend  And act from selfapplause exempt  What sinks him into selfcontempt  Could see how short how vague how vain  Are joys and all that joys contain  Yet seeing this could be betray'd  Doth Commonsense so much degrade  Such ample infamy deserves  If he with such conviction swerves  No epithet by man express'd  That Wit or Malice can suggest  Or scurril Rancour e'er devis'd  Can say how such a fool shou'd be despis'd  THE END  Page
