 The Days of Yore  A DRAMA IN THREE ACTS PERFORMED AT THE  THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND ESQ  DUBLIN  PRINTED FOR P WOGAN P BYRNE W JONES J RICE J MILLIKEN AND G FOLINGSBY  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr TOMS  THIS night the Muse devotes to  Days of Yore  When the fierce Dane insulted England's shore  She hapless isle in the wild tempest tost  Saw all but her inherent courage lost  Like some stout ship which sinking to her grave  Surveys what none but British hearts can brave  Death in a thousand shapes of horror drest  Night without stars and billows without rest  When some bold voice loud as the roaring sea  Cries out"All hands the port is in our lea"  Instant they rousebrace up the swelling sail  She rights she lifts she rides before the gale  Then safe in port the joyous glass goes round  And all past sorrows in that glass are drown'd  So in the night of England's deep despair  Great Alfred issuing from his secret lair  Rose like a meteorThe glad nation heard  His glorious call and this was Alfred's word  "Fight fight or perish in your country's cause  "Stand for your king your liberties your laws  "'Tis Alfred leads you onhis heart is true  "And he for whom your bleed shall bleed for you"  Sons of that gallant race to you we give  These pictur'd scenes in which your fathers live  View them with candor give the sketch some praise  Which features out the chiefs of ancient days  And recollect whatever here is shewn  Their cause their courage both are now your own  They met the fierce invader at their doors  No foes but captive foes invade your shores  Their wives their daughters fill'd the air with cries  To your kind land the helpless sufferer flies  Blest in a king mild merciful and good  Firm in allegiance to that king they stood  When they saw death disease or danger near  All all was terror for a life so dear  These are the scenes our drama sets to view  The moral of that fable rests with you  Dramatis Personae  ALFRED King of England  Mr

rugged Scene on the Western Coast of England with a distant View of the Sea  OSWENA GOTHRUN  OSWENA  WHY do you follow me I'll go no fur∣ther  Goth  I am your countryman a vanquisht Dane  Osw  Speak your necessities is it for food or rest or shelter from pursuit of the victorious foe that you wou'd importune me  Goth  I need them all yet ask for nothing but your patient hearing  Osw  Speak then and to the pointbe brief  Goth  It suits me so to be for I am spent with  toil and sorely bruis'd in fight under the walls of Exeter  Osw  'Twas a disastrous day  Goth  A fatal one for Denmarkwhat thou∣sands fell in battle how many of your wretched countrymen were slaughter'd in pursuit or pe∣rish'd in the sea to which they fled were hor∣rible to tell All all is lostAlfred invincible in arms reigns in his people's hearts for virtue and for valour worthily of force I must confess it surnam'd the Great  Osw  If this be all farewell  Goth  Nay lady hear me out  Osw  Have I not heard enough Well may our cause be lost when we have lost our courage We have lived in England till we are become fat as the soil and foggy as the climate It is our meanness that makes Alfred great There was a Dane that made that great one trembleKnew you not Hastings  Goth  I knew him well and honor those who lov'd him most of all the illustrious Oswena  Osw  Hah do you know me  Goth  I know you for the widow of my chiefa noble gem hid in a barbarous soil  Osw  Why then do you expose me to discove∣ryWho and what are you  Goth  Gothrun the Danedishonour never yet was coupled to that name  Osw  No nor defeat till now well may we say Alfred is great when he has conquer'd Goth∣run  Goth  He is unassailable by open war all Eng∣land is his garrison but tho' we cannot face him in the field we may yet foil him by surprize and stratagem'Tis not the warrior's process I con∣fess yet when all nobler means are out of reach  hope lost his soldiers spirits sunk his conqueror triumphant and his own life at risque nature will rouse him in mere selfdefence to deal the avenging stroke  Osw  Strike then and vindicate your coun∣try's causeBut what can I do living here by sufferance under the watchful eye of the Earl Oddune whose proud castle overpeers my hum∣ble cottage and keeps all around him in terror and subjection  Goth  You have a sonrevenge is his inheri∣tance  Osw  I have a sonbut such a son alas as cannot be inspir'd with any noble passion least of all with ambition or revenge His mind is like a tuneless instrument unstrung and not to be provok'd by any touch even of a master's hand  Goth  Unhappy tidings if the son of Has∣tings and Oswena so degenerates what hope is left May I not see your son  Osw  It were a spectacle to wound the heart of any loyal Dane Whether his spirit is debas'd by spells and filtres for rumor speaks of such or that his father's death has plung'd him into grief enervating his faculties I cannot say but all the noble promise of his youth like blossoms scat∣ter'd by the eastern blight is wither'd and de∣cay'd  Goth  No more we are observ'dsome one approaches whose noble carriage ill accords with the mean garb he wears  Osw  It is my son'tis Voltimar himselfOh that a shrine so rich shou'd encase nought but beggary  VOLTIMAR enters  How now whence come you  Volt  From the sea I come I have brought fish to feed you I angled for them rarely  Osw  They were but foolish things to be tre∣pann'd by such a witless angler  Volt  They are Alfred's fish land sea and air are Alfred's Good chance but I am questi∣on'd for conspiring the death of Alfred's sub∣jects  Goth  There's matter in that mind altho' de∣rang'd  Volt  This man's a Dane I know it by his locks they are yellow like my father's his were a shade betwixt the butterflower and marygold but they are paler since his death grisly and pale a sad sad spectacleThere was blood upon his beard when I saw him yesternight as I came home by moonlight from the beach He nodded to me thrice and graciously as he passed on but I was scar'd and what small wits I have wou'd not stay by meso he did not speakwas not that pitiful  Osw  Oh that I had been with you  Volt  Oh that you had your senses are entire mine arealas alas where are they  Osw  Come come be pacifiedanother night I will go with you to the spot he visits  Goth  Do you believe this vision  Osw  Three several times within these few days past he has repeated the same tale  Volt  I have I have three times you are right and eight days are gone by I notch'd them on my staff I can count ten and there my learning stops  Goth  This is most marvellous his eye is steady his demeanor grave and tho' his thoughts are wild yet are they utter'd firmly and in lan∣guage apposite I can discern no outward symp∣toms of an unfound mind  Volt  Go get you gone why do you peer at me and listen to my talk I am for Alfred I you are a naughty Dane such are not to be suf∣fer'd hence away with you  Goth  Wou'd you drive me away being a friend and countryman  Volt  I keep the seas for Alfred I pay him tribute of the spoil I take and when I flesh my hook I do pronounce his name three times for luck and then the silly fry come to the bait re∣ligiously and I catch themOh 'tis brave sportI'll go again tonight and if I meet my father on the beach so you will watch good mother I will call to youGood bye to you  Osw  Stay Voltimar I've a thing to say to you  Volt  No no no send hence that ugly man he means no goodI will not fight against the king not Ibesides the sun is up and then I sleep till he reels home to bed like a hot fleckor'd reveller as he is The moon the moon's my mistress when she's up then I come out and prowl upon the shore to plant my ozier traps un∣der the rocks or fix my baited trimmers in the sand when the ebb leaves it dry  Osw  Have you no feeling for your country's fate Stay and this warrior will describe the battle  Volt  Let him not tell me what I saw myself Twelve miles upon the stretch I ran to Haldown hill that overlooks the field the roebuck or the hart cannot outstrip me on the level plain I saw  the Danish host scattered like sheep By sea earth air and fire if I were other than the the thing I am I could have told them where to plant a blow in Alfred's battle that had made it reel  Goth  I wou'd this sword was planted in his heart  Volt  You are not wise to talk thus to a foolGo go begone Mother that yellow Dane will be your ruintrust him not Farewell  Exit  Goth  I'm cast into astonishment and can form no conjecture of his mind whether this spectre has disturb'd his reason or that he feigns infanity for purposes conceal'd and secret is not for me to say but this I boldly will aver his name alone will be a tower of strength and his import∣ant presence the sure rallying point for all our scatter'd powers if by persuasion you can draw him forth  Osw  Gothrun be sure my heart is with your cause and pants for vengeance shew me but the form and shape of any hopeful enterprize and Voltimar if words of mine can move him shall be your's Come then with merest and re∣freshment my poor cottage can still afford there we'll consult together  Exeunt  Scene changes to Kenwith Castle belonging to ODDUNE Earl of Devonshire  Earl ODDUNE and MOLLO  Oddune  Mollo  Mollo  My Lord  Oddune  Are we provided for tomorrow's festival This glorious victory of our King at Exeter together with the celebration of our daughter's nuptials will demand ample largess for our vassals I am not one that pamper the rich guest and leave the poor unfed  Mollo  Most puissant earl your careful pur∣veyor hath spar'd no pains to make provision for an entertainment worthy the princely giver on a day of so much joy and triumph If Kenwith Castle does not blaze tomorrow let Mollo bear the blame your larders do not own one idle hook your cellars not one empty cask and your slaugh∣terhouses stream with the blood of beeves that makes our river's tide run purple to the sea  Oddune  So your execution does but keep pace with your eloquence all will be well Have you bespoke the minstrels  Mollo  They are forewarn'd noble sir there will be harpers pipers and anticks from all parts with masques and interludes not void of fancy tho' I say it 'twill be a glorious wassail  Oddune  Is Voltimar amongst them If you have not secur'd that fool of noble quality the lady Adela who listens to his harp with such de∣light will think your choir imperfect  Mollo  I have retain'd the fool and that his memory might take some root I laid him under orders lustily with a good oaken cudgel  Oddune  Hah you did so 'twas an irreve∣rend cudgel that smote the son of Hastings his brave father who kept our royal Alfred pent in the neatherd's cottage would not have let even your words cudgel his ears unpunish'd  Mollo  'Tis a mere dolt my lord sluggish and only to be taught by blows  Oddune  Spare your instruction then and what his nature will not apprehend with ease forbear to enforce with cruelty when he presents him∣self as is his daily duty at the castle set him before meGo observe my ordersAdela ap∣proaches  Exit MOLLO  ADELA enters  Adela  Health and a happy morning to my fa∣ther  Oddune  Bless you my child and may to∣morrow's fun rise with peculiar lustre to bedeck the fairest bride that England's isle can boast  Adela  Ah sir tomorrow did you say to∣morrow  Oddune  Can happiness my child come out of time For whom but you my darling and your betroth'd the noble Alric of Northumber∣berland are we thus busied watching every hour nay every minute such is our impatience till those whom we have station'd in our castle's towers give signal of his coming  Adela  Call it a knell that warns me from the arms of a fond fostering parent to receive a husband perhaps a tyrant whom I cannot love  Oddune  How Adela you cannot love a man not less distinguish'd for a noble nature than for illustrious birth graceful in person courteous in his manners and which confirms his merit high in the favor of our virtuous king  Adela  I wou'd the king had favor'd him so highly as to have rais'd his thoughts to loftier objects than the poor humble Adela  Oddune  What would you mean by those cold freezing terms When my heart glows with joy why do you chill it am I not pledg'd to Alric are not you Have you forgot the sacred sense of honour Do you not reverence truth and me your father Do you not love me Adela  Adela  Oh with the truest heart I reverence you love you and obeyonly in this let me not offend my fatherif whilst I submit I tremble  MOLLO enters  Mollo  My lord the foolish Voltimar is come  Adela  Better be foolish Mollo than unmerci∣ful I hear sad tales of you is it a manly act to strike a harmless unresisting creature  Oddune  I have reprov'd him for it  Adela  I thank you sir it well becomes a hero  Oddune  Go tell the Dane that we wou'd see see him heretell it respectfully as to the son of one who aw'd this island at whose frown you wou'd have cower'd into the dust with terrorand recollect that when you call him foolish you give yourself the worst of titles for to strike a fool like insult to a woman what is it but to stamp yourself a coward  Exit MOLLO  Adela  I thank you from my soul  Oddune  Well well you have an interest in that soul sad though you have made it I will be a friend to this poor youth for your sake none shall hurt him when you are far away and he has lost his gentle patroness  Adela  Oh that is kind indeed most kind and charitable he will have need of comfort  VOLTIMAR appears ushered in by MOLLO who bows and retires  Oddune  Now Voltimar what news  Volt  Good news great sir your steward is grown courteous and forbears to scoff and strike meSave you sweet rose the dew of heaven fall on you  Oddune  Love you our gentle daughter my good fellow  Volt  I wou'd most noble sir did I know what love is if it resembles weeping I do that when she looks sad and sorrowful as now  Adela  Nay Voltimar I am not sad except to hear that Mollo is so harsh  Volt  Pray be not sad for me hereafter I will laugh when Mollo beats me as I did once to see a scurvy ass kick at the thunder the thunder did not heed the foolish insult for 'twas an ass that kick'd and the clouds were too high to be injur'd by his heels  Oddune  Talk thus and you shall no more be called the foolish Voltimar but Voltimar the phi∣losopher  Volt  If I outlive tomorrow I shall merit it  Aside  Oddune  What say you of tomorrow speak out I heard it not  Volt  I say tomorrow will be one day more than I have yet outliv'd  Oddune  Aye and the happiest you have seen we'll hope therefore array yourself in your best trim and screw your harp up to its sprightliest pitch for we shall need your minstrelsy  Volt  My harp and I have quarrel'd and are parted  Oddune  What do you mean Explain your∣self  Volt  There came your servant Mollo high in glee and warn'd me to attend the weddingday of this your beauteous daughter with Earl AlricI was to harp forsooth in his Northumbrian earsThis summons did not please meWas I Earl Alric's harper I demandedAt this your servant grew in wrath and with his staff smote me upon the head  Adela  Impudent varlet he deserves the death  Volt  The sun was then just glittering o'er the waves and I was sitting on the seabeat rock greeting his rising beams with such poor min∣strelsy and humble oraisons as my small art cou'd furnish stunn'd with the stroke and somewhat angry to be so saluted I took my harp and in a thoughtless moment dash'd it from off the rock with all my might into the waste of watersThe tuneful victim gave one dying groan and burst asunder never again will it  discourse sweet music  the ebbing tide wafted the shiver'd frag∣ments out of sight  Oddune  'Twas a rash act and had you not defect of reason for your plea you shou'd be chidden for itbut we'll provide you with ano∣ther harp  Volt  I cannot play my soul is out of tune if I shou'd touch the string it wou'd not speak  Adela  Urge him no further let his humour pass  Oddune  We do not yield to such a stubborn humour let come what will he shall perform tomorrow  Volt  I cannot harp to Alric and I will not  Oddune  What not if Adela requires it of you  Volt  She is too merciful she'll not require it  Oddune  But what if I command it  Volt  Oh then I'll play most lustily to Alric as I did once at Bamflete fight the tune has slipt me but his better recollection will bring it to my mind  Oddune  What do you mean Was you in Bamflete fight  Volt  I think I was but I know nothing right∣ly I am a fool with a most witty memory all things fall from iteven my own miseries  He retires to the back scene  Adela  Sure you forget his father fell at Bam∣flete Lo how he's rapt  Oddune  Shame on me I forgot itTrue most true 'twas there the mighty Hastings fell I was not in the battle I'm sorry at my heart to have disturb'd him I see the filial feelings are alive weak as his reason is go go and comfort him  Adela  Oh that I could  going but stops short  Bugle sounds  Oddune  Hark what is that the warden on the tower gives the alarm By all my hopes Lord Alric is arriv'd  Volt  Hah Alric  Adela  Peace are you mad thus to betray yourself  Volt  Down down my heart  One of Earl ODDUNE's Men enters  Oddune  Speak is the Earl arriv'd  Serv  My lord it is a courier from the King  Oddune  Hah say'st thou What does his dispatch import  Serv  Alfred the Great having dispers'd his foes and rais'd the siege of Exeter has put his army into march and purposes this night to be your lordship's guest at Kenwith Castle  Oddune  Alfred my guesthis kingly purpose is most kind and graciousNow Adela your king who is his people's father will be your's and join your hand to Alric'sI will forth and welcome these glad tidings  Exit attended  VOLTIMAR and ADELA  Volt  So this concludes my destinyAlric is fortune's minion I a poor beaten slave  Adela  Think what I sufFer agonize me not with your complainingsabove all things Vol∣timar I do conjure you by the love you bear me do not alarm my father Words cannot de∣scribe what terrors I endur'd whilst you spoke so unguarded  Volt  Who can be calm at such a moment To you alone the secret is confided that I have feign'd this folly I need not feign henceforthwhen you are Alric's bride I shall be nature's scorn that wretched thing whose reason grief hath wreck'd  Adela  How terrible is that thought the bride of AlricNo my heart revolts How can my father so approve and favor that cold ob∣scure impenetrable man whose mind is black as night his thoughts perplext and absent and whose conscience seems ever to upbraid him whilst he professes what he does not feel  Volt  I know Lord Alric but for my weak nature this fate had ne'er befallen youWhen my brave father drew his battle forth at Bamflete  trenches I fought beside him where it was my chance to encounter this same Alric and unhorse him I had him then at my sword's point de∣fenceless prostratePity smote my heart his youth his cries his wounded helpless state plead∣ed for life I check'd the mortal stroke and for that act of mercy am repaid with misery worse than deathAnd does your father think that I play the antick and pipe to my own prisonerwill I'll perish first  Adela  It shall not be requiredOh Volti∣mar if you cou'd see my heart  Volt  I shou'd behold the victim of obedience I shou'd then see the very shrine of virtue wit∣ness the struggles of a pure affection opprest and thwarted by paternal power I shou'd con∣template all that can inspire me with love and animate me with courage to brave all dangers even death itself rather than tamely yield you to Lord Alric  Adela  Ah Voltimar I fear my doom is seal'd Lord Alric's high nobility  Volt  The worms had fed on his nobility but for my mercy  Adela  My father's willthe king's authority  Volt  Is your father's will irrevocable is not your king compassionate In short is any thing impossible to love ardent as mine and a soul re∣solute to attempt your rescue  Adela  You terrify me what do you intend  Volt  When Hastings lived Alfred tho' now surnam'd the Great was but the second man in Englandthe son of Hastings vanquish'd and a prisoner depress'd by fortune and reduc'd to as∣sume a counterfeited weakness is not so degene∣rate as to submit tamely without a struggle to a  rival in arms less than his equal in nobility not greater  Adela  Break off we are observ'd  A Servant enters  Serv  Lady the Earl demands your instant pre∣sence  Adela  The Earl shall be obeyedI will but drop a word with this poor ignorant and follow you  Exit Servant  Hear me and make no answer or speak soft∣ly you know my window in the eastern tower underneath which you have so often harp'dbe there at eveningfall in the still hourI read your answer in your eyesBe cautious not a word moreWell if it must be so there is my handnow be content release meFarewell  Exit VOLTIMAR  END OF ACT I  ACT II  An Apartment in the House of OSWENA  OSWENA and LOTHAIRE  OSWENA  COME hither Lothaire I've a word in secret for youYou lov'd your noble mas∣ter and you will be faithful to his sad widow though times are chang'd and you no longer are the fine gay page that follow'd the Lord Hast∣ings when he held his court in splendor and gave law to England  Loth  I have been faithful ever and I will be  Osw  That's my good ladNow mark mehere are Danes scatter'd about the reliques of the fight at Exeter who wou'd do noble service if we cou'd persuade my son to be amongst them I have urg'd him to it every means I have tried to stir his stagnant spirit a cause methinks like our's might move the very stones to rise and cry for vengeance  Loth  He fought courageously at Bamflete trenches  Osw  And sometimes I incline to hope courage so natural to him will awake from sleep and reassume its energy I noted his emotions as I talk'd and tho' he answer'd not his eyes shot fire his colour came and went and I do think the senses that shou'd quicken him afresh were  in commotionYou can do much Lothaire for you are in his heart me he regards with caution and reserve  Loth  Ah Madam if I have any interest in his heart 'tis simply that of pity and benevo∣lence on matters of such moment as you hint at I dare not move him for since this malady has hung upon him he will not suffer me to speak of Denmark nay hardly will endure a Dane to approach him  Osw  'Tis true and sometimes I suspect he feigns this humor only to avoid their importu∣nities  Loth  I cannot tell but certain it is he has kept all quiet in these purlieus where none will stir but at his bidding With me altho' he passes many hours he talks but little fishing is his sport watching his baits by night upon the beach a pensive occupation sometimes indeed he touch∣es his harp and then I sing to him  Osw  Cou'd you not introduce the madrigal I late gave you which touches on his malady  Loth  I am prepar'd with it and only wait his call to sing it to himand see he comes  Osw  I'll leave youOh Lothaire rouse him redeem him save him if you can  Exit  VOLTIMAR and LOTHAIRE  Loth  Bless you my gentle master  Volt  Bless you bless you  Loth  I'm proud to see you in your best attire  Volt  'Tis a proud day Lothaire Kings are abroad The sun himself is in his best attire and so am I  Loth  It well becomes you You now shew as the son of Hastings should  Volt  The son of Hastings should be what he is not he should be braver than to take a blow from a base menial groom nobler than to beat the strings of a poor trembling harp to pleasure the proud ears of young NorthumberlandI harp to him his heartstrings shall make music with my sword or ere I'll harp to him Mark me Lothaire my folly is not constant  Loth  Wou'd Heaven that it were pass'd and gone for ever  Volt  Madmen have intervals of sober reason fools have the gleamings of a mind at times Now if you say this to my mother Lothaire you are no friend of minefor she is mad without the loss of reasonAnswer me thiswhat is the best device to remedy a sick mind  Loth  I know no other remedy but patience  Volt  You might as well say to the bedrid wretchrise and be well at once You have forgot your lesson 'twas not this that my re∣vengeful mother bade you sayshe would pre∣scribe rebellion blood and plunder those are her Danish drugs but I'll not taste themGive me the softening the assuaging powers music and meditation  Loth  Shall I fetch your harp  Volt  Not for the world I love you much too well to send you on that errand my harp is wreck'd at seabut I'll sit down and you shall sing to me  Loth  I have a song the words are new the strain familiar and by your favorite minstrel old Llewellyn I caught it from your harp  Volt  'Tis well his plaintive melody delights me most  Loth  You may suppose it address'd to some warrior who being lost to his country and bu∣ried  in profound melancholy the poet strives to rouse him by the following strain  "Where is that tow'ring spirit fled  "Which zeal heroic fir'd  "Is that creative genius dead  "Which every muse inspir'd  "Is it in grief's o'erwhelming tide  "That ardent fire was lost  "Or have those senses turn'd aside  "In love severely crost  "Come then sweet sounds for you alone  "Can bid the tumult cease  "Restore his reason to its throne  "His bosom to its peace  "The turbid passions shall retire  "Before the minstrel's art  "And the same hand that sweeps the lyre  "Shall heal the stricken heart"  Volt  Enough Lothaire If this will not ex∣ercise the foul spirit it is because he has no ear for melodyAnd now retire you have done your part and whether I redeem my mind which you think lost or perish in my folly you are clear in your allegiance and the everfaithful servant of the noble Hastings has proved himself the zealous friend of his ignoble son Leave me without more wordsI have some thoughts abroad which I wou'd fain call home  Loth  I'll not disturb your thoughtsfarewell  Exit LOTHAIRE  VOLTIMAR alone  Oh England generous but hostile country how would'st thou tremble didst thou know this arm cou'd make thee kingless ere tomorrow I have the death of Hastings at my heartbut I'll not strike so deep revenge so terrible I will not takeRest rest poor land Denmark hath drank too largely of thy bloodSpirit of my il∣lustrious father if thou it is that visitest me night∣ly foster these meditations  OSWENA and GOTHRUN enter  Osw  Lo where he sits Let us pursue our talk without regarding himIf Alfred's armies are so far advanc'd he leaves the country betwixt them and Exeter open to an attack  Volt  Aye aye more bloodshe lives upon the scent  aside  Osw  What force could you collect on an emergency and where is it dispos'd  Goth  Of those who surviv'd the slaughter a remnant sav'd themselves on board the ships then hovering on the coast These are entire and though our thousands are diminish'd to hundreds yet I cou'd disembark a force sufficient for any sudden enterprize if such presented itself if not I shall go off to them and sail for Den∣mark  Volt  Sail then and leave this island to its peace  He rises and comes forward  Osw  Peace to your folly mean degenerate Dane  Volt  Who talks of folly If I have assum'd this weakness thinking it less shame to seem the fool of nature than be the slave of man it is be∣cause I have a spirit indignant of subjection and  you who think me mean and degenerate are in an error  Osw  Convict me of that error and stand forth for Denmark  Volt  Away I have a better cause than to lay waste with fire and sword defenceless villagesAccursed warfare worthy only of savages not soldiers  Goth  Give us to know your cause and we'll support it  Volt  Gothrun you thirst for blood so do not IYou said when last we met you wish'd your sword was buried in the heart of Alfred Had I met Alfred fairly in the fight where he dealt slaughter round him I wou'd have prov'd the temper of my sword upon his mailed corslet but had I struck him down as I did Alric of Northumberland I wou'd have scorn'd to stab a fallen foe and when his valor was no longer ter∣rible I wou'd have reverenc'd his virtues and have spar'd him  Osw  Remember we are prisoners of Earl Od∣dune and chains how light soever they may be are still ingloriousRemember too that the lost standard of your country the magic Raefen the proudest trophy England has to boast floats in Earl Oddune's hall  Volt  Enough remember on your part that meekness is the woman's grace and to abide ill fortune patiently a conduct more becoming of your sex than to resent it proudly Fare you well  Exit VOLTIMAR  GOTHRUN and OSWENA  Osw  I'm wrapt in wonder how his spirit towers how awful and how stern  Goth  Let us not quit him but follow and  endeavour to obtain some insight into his myste∣rious purposes  Osw  'Tis well advis'd proceed  Exeunt  A Hall in Kenwith Castle The Warders and Servants of the Earl ranged for the Reeeption of the King The Danish Standard of the Raven is displayed Earl ODDUNE enters hastily  ODDUNE  Throw wide my gates or cast them from their hinges turn out my warders in their best attire and let my castle towers if it were possible bow down their heads in honor of our guest Sound trumpets and salute the sovereign the saviour of his country Hah fall back give large and am∣ple room shew yourselves courtly to our noble visitors  Flourish  ALFRED preceded by his Lords and Courtiers appears through the Gate  Brave Sibald and brave Egbert welcome wel∣come Redwald and Kenulph Swithun and my honor'd kinsman Roger de Malvernand Oh sight of joy the head and heart of Eng∣landmy king my father  Kneels  Alfred  Rather say your son for it was you that nurs'd my infant hopes and taught me how to conquerRise Stand up My heart bounds to embrace you  Oddune  Each drop of blood that flows from it is Alfred's  Alfred  We know your love and rate it at a price not less in value than the crown we wear you was our great forerunner you first track'd the road to victory and we have trac'd your steps at humble distances If our memory needed a  prompter we have but to cast our eyes upon that ensign of your victory and mend our recollecti∣on but our thoughts are faithful to your services and by the rights of hospitality which I now claim of you as my much honor'd host I call upon you to demand a boon and may that ban∣ner fall upon my head if I refuse it  Oddune  My gracious liege 'tis at my lips al∣ready  Alfred  Speak and 'tis granted  Oddune  Sire that you will honor with your royal presence my daughter's nuptials  Alfred  Which of our Nobles does the Lady Adela make choice of to promote to this felicity  Oddune  One whom I look'd to have found at∣tending on your highness Earl Alric of Northum∣berland  Sibald  Heaven give me patience Did you say Lord Alric  Oddune  Aye Sibald is he not a worthy lord  Alfred  Our kingdom boasts none worthierYou brave Sibald of all whom I have heard are warmest in your praises of his courage ho∣nor and accomplishments for you are Alric's nearest and most ardent friend and much it glads me when my friends and nobles ltve in such love and concord with each other  Oddune  Let me then ask under favor of your highness this noble lord why when I named Earl Alric for my daughter he started and gave signs of such astonishment  Sibald  I know my king is just and I might speak without offending him what truth and ho∣nour warrant tho' my charge glanc'd upon his heart even in the tenderest point but it is not my custom to appeal till I stand face to face be∣fore my judge with him who wrongs me till  then I humbly pray our joys may not be damp'd by any inference drawn from my incautious words  Alfred  Let it be so though I must own I'm touch'd even to the quick to think that any cause of difference shou'd arise betwixt two gallant he∣roes whom I have ever held not less incapable of doing wrong than I myself of screening the offender but we'll not shew so little courtesy to our kind host as to give way to sorrow till it meets usCome my good lord you must not think to keep your castle's richest treasure out of sight if Lady Adela will condescend to admit us as we are in the rough trim of soldiers on their march we shall be proud to pay our ho∣mage as her faithful knight  Oddune  Not so my liege but with Lord Sibald's leave her gracious sponsor  Alfred  Ah Sibald Sibald But let that grief sleepthat we may touch upon no string that jars we'll visit her aloneLead I will follow you  Exeunt ALFRED and ODDUNE  SIBALD EGBERT REDWALD SWITHUN and ROGER DE MALVERN  Egbert  The king is vext  Sibald  I'm sorry at my soul  Redwald  I know not when I have seen him so much mov'd  Roger de M  Lord Oddune too can scarce re∣strain himself  Sibald  Roger de Malvern you have known me long so have you all and if I am no com∣mon talker to let fly my words at random with∣out forecast am not noted for one that vouches rashly and after shrinks from what he has so  vouch'd I will believe you'll credit me for ma∣king good whatever I have hinted or depos'd in hearing of my sovereign and yourselves till then though I cannot recal the words improvidently wrested from me by surprize I can at least re∣frain from adding to a fault which I repent of  Roger de M  Spoken like yourself and we with the same candor will not prejudge you or your cause The king who loves his friend as we all know and no friend more deservedly than yourself is yet so pure so equal in his high seat of justice that no appellant has been heard to say why did he this  Swithan  The nation with one voice will tes∣tify to this  Roger de M  Long may he live and reign ho∣nor'd obey'd and lov'd And mark my words young lordsI'm old enough to be a prophet were I as wise withalThe character of Alfred hath not yet attain'd to half that lustre which in future times if Heaven preserves his life it will diffuse thro' the admiring world victorious as he is and great in warlike qualities the powers and energies of his capacious mind are but obscurely seen till peace shall give his meditations scope for action and display then he will shine and you who may expect to see those glorious days will call when I am dead these words to mind and say"Malvern predicted rightly"  Sibald  No my good Lord we rather hope you'll live to witness the fulfilment of these aus∣picious wordsthen we'll record them joyfully together  Roger de M  And I shall die content  Egbert  Die when you may your memory will be honor'd to all timeNow let us seek the  king and tender him our dutyCome my lords  Exeunt  Scene changes to ADELA's Apartment in the Castle  ADELA  Alfred is now arriv'd and I must face or fly the doom that threatens me Unhappy Adela seal'd down to misery if once the fatal word shall pass my lips in presence of the king What shall I do To whom shall I resort Is not the father of his people just tender of heart and pitiful to those who kneel to him for mercyI will kneelHark he approachesBenignant Heaven support me  ALFRED preceded by Earl ODDUNE  Oddune  Daughter behold your king Kneel now to him for whom so often you have knelt to Heaven  She offers to kneel  Alfred  Not so fair excellenceSaints kneel not to sinners and kings themselves will bend the knee to beauty  Adela  My humble duty waits upon your high∣ness  Alfred  My love on youwing'd with a thou∣sand wishes that Heaven may prosper what it has adorn'd and beautified so highlyI am now your guest fair Adela and if my hopes deceive me not shall be in nearer trust with you tomorrow I have requested therefore of your father admis∣sion to you private and alone  Oddune  My liege I have thrown my treasure at your feet and now resign it to you  Exit ODDUNE  Alfred  Pray be compos'd you tremble gen∣tle maid  Adela  I have cause dread Sir it is an awful thing to be in presence of him whom more than all the world I honor and revere  Alfred  It is more awful to approach the altar with a backsliding heartLet me know there∣fore if with free consent and hearty approba∣tion you espouse Lord Alric of Northumber∣land  Adela  It is my duty to obey my father  Alfred  I am to be your father in that office and how far I am warranted in conscience to ex∣ecute that office will depend on your reply  Adela  My heart is fullOh that I had dar'd to speak  Alfred  Speak I conjure you I am all atten∣tion  Adela  You are all goodness Sir the power that Heaven has put into your hands you as Heaven's almoner dispense so bounteously that misery flies to you as to a friend and every child of sorrow owns you for its father I have ven∣tur'd to lift up my eyes towards your's and I have there discover'd beams of such mild bene∣volence that I perceive where you are present fear cannot inhabit even in my woman's heart  Alfred  If purity and truth cou'd fear my pre∣sence I were a tyrant which I trust I am nottherefore proceed  Adela  I am in love and duty so fast bound to obey my father's will and yet so adverse to this marriage that I have nothing in my choice but choice of misery  Alfred  Adverse to marriage and yet on the very eve How is this Adela Do you see good cause to marry Alric and no cause to love him  Adela  'Twould be redemption for me if I cou'd  Alfred  Have you discover'd aught that con∣tradicts what fame reports of himHe may have faults errors of temper but integrity and honor are his own  Adela  It is the test of merit to be prais'd by him whose praise resounds throughout the worldGlory enough for Alric and good cause why I should honor him whom Alfred favors but judge me royal Sir am I in fault if nature which has given him grace to merit these high honours hath not endow'd me with a heart to love him  Alfred  What shall I say It is not in my hand those springs are plac'd that guide the will and govern the affections Forewarn'd as I now am I'll not approach the altar there to make a lying deposition and affront the Majesty of Hea∣ven No Adela that's past but when you know how ardently your father patronizes Alric's suit I must believe a heart so dutiful as your's wou'd not oppose his wishes nor reject a choice so worthy were it not bestow'd upon some hap∣pier lover  Adela  Ah gracious Sir my heart is in your sight I dare not stand before you and prevari∣cate  Alfred  And wherefore shou'd you for if I conjecture rightly you have plac'd your choice on one whose virtues valor and illustrious birth rank with the first in England though hard misfortune has fallen heavy on him  Adela  How glorious is such praise from Al∣fred's lips How godlike such benevolence I do perceive you have discover'd him  Alfred  I saw the secret workings of his heart his horror and surprize when your father an∣nounc'd your nuptials for tomorrow  Adela  My fatherDid my father see all this  Alfred  Assuredly he did  Adela  Oh heaven and earth then we are both undone if Voltimar has thus betrayed him∣self  Alfred  How say youVoltimarI speak not of him  Adela  SirNot of Voltimar  Alfred  I speak of SibaldVoltimar's a Dane the son of HastingsCan you love a Dane  Adela  He is a Dane but noble brave and virtuous he is the son of Hastings but merciful to Alfred's friends as Alfred is to him the very air that Alric breathes is Voltimar's at Bamflete fight he struck him from his horse and when he might have spear'd him to the earth even in the heat and madness of the battle in pity he forbore and gave him life is not such mercy lovely  Alfred  'Tis enviably noble 'tis heroic  Adela  I knew to whom it was that I appeal'd  Alfred  I've heard Lord Alric speak of this generous action in terms of rapturous gratitude and I trust it never shall be said of my country∣men that they suppress the good deeds of an enemy and only publish evil ones And now fair Adela thanks for your candor what you have imparted to me I shall commit to my most serious thoughts and in all honorable measures serve you  Adela  Ah Sir I stand in wonder at your goodness and blush to think that any thought of me should occupy a mind where a whole nati∣on's interests are repos'dBut pity ever marks the hero's character  Alfred  I shall confer with VoltimarFare∣wellExit  Exit  ADELA alone  Confer with VoltimarHark what is thisHe strikes upon the harp it is his signal call∣ing me to the windowOh well tim'd blest occasion I can now prepare him for his inter∣view with Alfred allay his fears his jealousies of Alric and by the sympathy of souls transfuse into his breast the hope that springs in mineAgain he summons meI come I come  END OF ACT II  ACT III  The Castle  ADELA speaks from the window  ADELA  HUSH hush not a word moreI hear my father's voiceAway away  Shuts the casement  ODDUNE enters  Oddune  I left you to your conference with the king tell me what pass'd  Adela  Alfred is ever gracious  Oddune  That's granted and as such that you have confided to him your whole heart I can well believe He is now gone forth alone to meet Lord Alric else I had heard from him what wou'd have made my question needless  Adela  You have been ever good to me and so tender that you have even treated my faults with gentleness therefore it is I am the more afraid to offend you  Oddune  Nay no evasion I need not to be told your heart is not accordant to my wishes in plainer words you do not love Lord Alric  Adela  If I may judge of him he has as little wish to gain my heart as I have will to give it himSullen obscure and with himself displeas'd he took no pains to recommend his suit but cold∣ly told me you had given consent and hop'd I  wou'd confirm it To this I made no answer nor did he urge me to it but taking my silence for his acquittal from an irksome penance bow'd and departed  Oddune  Truth to confess his manners have not pleas'd me there seems to be something upon his mind that presses and dispirits him time must reveal itOf this be sure I shall not be less forward to resent contempt than you are quick to feel it  Adela  Upon my knees I thank youOh my father honor'd rever'd and lov'd save your poor child from misery and destruction  Oddune  Be patient risethere needs not all this vehemence of prayer to melt a heart that is not made of marble I am not one of those ob∣durate fathers to stop my ears against the cries of natureWas you this instant with the king Did you confess yourself to him averse to this impending marriage and in like fervent terms  Adela  I did confess and he with a benignity for which may Heaven crown him with bles∣sings heard and approv'd my prayer  Oddune  Hah did he so What said he  Adela  The words indeed of Alfred may be repeated the grace that marks all that he says or does who can describe I pray you let my humble plea approach you not through my lips but Alfred's  Oddune  It shall be so you have appeal'd to Alfred let Alfred judge betwixt usRetire to peace  Adela  Kind Heaven reward and bless you for this goodness  Exeunt severally  A Grove withoutside the Castle  ALFRED and ALRIC  Alfred  Here we are private and now my Lord of Northumberland by the right I have in you as your king and friend I call on you to make answer to a few plain questions which concern not only your own honor but mine also  Alric  Sir if I were as clear in conscience to∣wards all others as I am true and faithful to your highness I shou'd not fear the closest scrutiny  Alfred  Fear nothing only give me up your heart  Alric  'Tis at my lips command and it shall forth  Alfred  How is it you have suffer'd me to be inform'd by any other than yourself of your en∣gagement with the lady Adela Is it fitting that you shou'd have so great a happiness in contem∣plation and I your friend not know of it  Alric  I cannot answer you but on my knees implore you to dismiss me as one no longer wor∣thy to approach you  Alfred  Stand up I will not hear you in that posture  Alric  Ah my too gracious master tho' you can pity errors you cannot pardon crimes I am undone for ever in your thoughts and have so deeply wrong'd the earl of Devonshire that all the atonement I can tender him is to lay bare my bosom to his sword and meet the death I merit Alas dread sir when I forbore to speak to you of what you term my happiness it was because I trembled to reveal my shame I must not can not wed the lady Adela  Alfred  You cannot why Does that impe∣diment spring from yourself or her  Alric  From myself solely for I deserv'd the cold reception she gave me  Alfred  How then are you dishonor'd with the earl if finding her repugnant to your suit you modestly withdraw it  Alric  Because to my eternal shame I own it I made proposals for earl Oddune's daughter when I was bound by solemn word and promise to another  Alfred  My lord my lord what plea have you to make for such duplicity  Alric  None royal sir but that I am unhappy in a nature which loving ardently resents too quickly In one of these rash moments on a suspected slight when my fond heart 'twixt love and jealousy was rent asunder almost bereft of reason and hurried on by an impetuous passion I took the desperate measure that has plung'd me in this disgraceful business with earl Oddune  Alfred  And not with him alone but with the lady whose appeal will bear so hard against you and whom yet you have not nam'd  Alric  There I am doubly guilty for that lady is grac'd with loveliness so charming join'd to a nature so ingenuous that nothing less than folly blind as mine cou'd have mistaken itBorn of a noble house illustrious for its loyalty whose branches death has sever'd without mercy the lady Bertha  SIBALD enters hastily  Sibald  Hath yet a brother living who will not suffer insult and perjury to escape his venge∣ance My sovereign lord I kneel to you for justice  Alfred  Rise Sibald and if we cut short your accusation it is because the justice of your appeal is known already and the Lord Alric by his own confession stands selfcondemn'd  Sibald  My wrongs dread sir cannot be put aside by an extorted penitence I once accounted this unworthy lord my honor'd valued friend he has betrayed me You have a heart my liege alive to all the feelings of a man you know the stabs that a false friend can give and by your own sensations will allow for mine  Alfred  Not to the passions Sibald but to jus∣tice make your appealProceed  Sibald  My name great sir will not be found less frequent or less honor'd in our annals than that of Alric my house can boast as many tro∣phies of a warlike ancestry a nobler father and three gallant brothers have died in arms for Al∣fred and their country the Danish sword has gash'd our line so deeply that nothing now re∣mains to me but one dear sister pure as the air she breathes and without spot save that of loving this false faithless man who has abandon'd her for earl Oddune's daughter for which act here in your royal presence I brand him for a traitor to his oath a perjur'd traitor and de∣mand the lists  Alfred  A dreadful reference you make Lord Sibald and put your cause to an uncertain issue but if when justice tenders you her sword you still prefer your own what you will do you must I cannot stay you  Alric  Nor shall I shun the lists if he demands them but I must execrate those bloody laws that subject me on the same day which wedded me to Bertha to the dire chance of being found the murderer of her brother  Sibald  Wedded to Bertha speak that word again  Alric  Yes Sibald I have ask'd and obtain'd pardon of your injur'd sister she has seal'd it with her hand before the altar and let my sove∣reign say if I who have not yet aton'd to the father of Adela am warranted to take up the gage from the brother of Bertha  Alfred  I do forbid the listsSibald I know you well no English bosom wears a braver heart as well I know Lord Alric and esteem him worthy no less praise yet herein I com∣mend him not that he should suffer a mere lover's quarrel to spread into such mischief  Sibald  Oh my rever'd and ever gracious lord permit me first to embrace him as a bro∣ther and after cast myself at your feet and sup∣plicate your influence with earl Oddune to medi∣ate for his pardon  Alfred  Rise Sibald to this task I willingly accord for much 'twould wound my heart if when your swords are wanted to repel the inva∣ders of your country feuds and dissentions be∣twixt friend and friend shou'd turn them on each otherFollow me to the castle Alric will keep his station here without till we return  Exeunt  ALRIC  Who wou'd not die for such a generous mas∣ter faultless himself he is all candor to the faults of others and lives amongst us like a de∣scended angel sent to reform our errors by the example of his own perfections  VOLTIMAR enters to ALRIC  Volt  Hah by my hopes Lord AlricDo you know me  Alric  Do I know VoltimarMy conqueror my preserver come to my arms  Volt  Forbear there is a spirit within me sunk tho' I am in misery and despair that will not suffer you tho' now a conqueror in your turn and towering far above the wretched son of Hastings to take this base advantage of your fortune and drag a trembling victim to the altar only to riot in the tears of beauty and throw your chains upon a heart that never can be your's  Alric  Pause from your rage and say in plain∣er terms on whose behalf it is that you accuse me  Volt  I do accuse you of unmanly conductaccuse you on the part of the lady Adela  Alric  My conscience does that office without the aid of other advocates to plead against me  Volt  Draw then and answer one whom no∣thing less definitive than death can satisfy or silence  Alric  She has a father him I now expect he has the prior claim upon my sword  Volt  What do you tell me of a father's claim I love her to distraction he destroys her there∣fore no more it is a poor evasion to talk of prior claims to one who boasts possession of her heart Defend yourself  Alric  I will but first explain our cause of quarrel  Volt  Away you trifle with the time what more can you desireYou are arm'd accou∣tred practis'd in the combat and flusht with conquestI a vanquisht prisoner a poor wretch∣ed thing assuming folly to conceal my shame sunk even to beggary and driven to harp for charitable scraps at great men's tablesYet by  the blood of Hastings my inheritance you shall not wed with Adela  Alric  I will not wed with Adela I cannot  Volt  Go on  Alric  I am the husband of Lord Sibald's sis∣terA broken faith I have to answer forbut that is Oddune's quarrelIf you are Oddune's champion so deputed lo I draw forth my swordset to and spare not  Volt  Return your sword into its case again till Oddune calls it forth I have no cause to mur∣mur at your choice tho' much to wonder at it  Alric  Had I no other duty for my sword than to defend the justice of my choice I were most happybut the time approaches when I expect Earl Oddune and the king that is an interview you will not court  Volt  No for if Alfred's eloquence protects you you'll want no other second in your causeFarewell assure yourself of a successful issue  Exeunt severally  Another part of the adjacent country  GOTHRUN and OSWENA  Goth  Darkness comes on the night befriends us and Heaven itself conspires with our attempt Nothing is wanting to ensure success but your son's presence Alfred and his nobles are weakly garrison'd in Kenwith Castle Oh what a glo∣rious moment will be lost if Voltimar will not come forth He

clamours Who dares to sound that horn  Dane  Son of our chief your ever faithful Danes believ'd it was your summonss and obey'd it  Volt  Send out and set that insolent before me whose cursed breath

countrymenHow Voltimar amongst usJoy to you chief we seiz'd this muffled Saxon under the castle walls  Volt  You seiz'd him youunder the castle wallsYou fled like deer under the walls of ExeterFor

Volt  I am the son of Hastings and by the immortal spirit of my father if one amongst you dares to draw a bow or rear a pike against this Saxon's breast I'll thrust my sword into that mis∣creant's heart and spurn him to the earth  Goth  If you're the son of Hastings by inhe∣ritance  you are the foe of AlfredWho can tell This may be Alfred himself  Volt  And if it be I would not like you Gothrun
