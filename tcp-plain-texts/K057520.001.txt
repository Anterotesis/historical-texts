 TIMOR DEI NOBILITAS  THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY  A NOVEL  IN LETTERS  BY MRS GRIFFITH  VOL I  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND  MDCCLXXVI  TO THE READER  TO such trisling works as novels are generally esteemed a preface may probably be deemed superfluous For which reason I shall bestow but a few lines on this and they shall only tend to obviate the remarks that may possibly be made upon the conduct of the Story  In the first essay I attempted in this species of writing I acknowledged "my deficiency in the principal article of such compositions namely invention  Preface to the Delicate Distress  " The creative powers of fancy do not increase with years being rarely to be met with but in the spring of life On facts alone then my readers must depend for the entertainment I wish them to receive from the following sheets as the utmost merit they can pretend to is that the characters as well as the narrative are drawn from the fountain of reality tho' the stream by wandering from one country to another may have acquired some adventitious  particles as well as have lost some portion of its original peculiarity  The most uncommon character in the following work is that of Mr Evelyn but I aver that I had the pleasure of being intimately acquainted with the person from whom the portrait is exactly copied when he had reached his fiftieth year and even at that period of his life his romantic passion remained unabated still tho' the object of it had been no more for several years and dead to him a considerable time before  From the favourable reception my former writings of this kind have been honoured with I presume now once more tho' with extreme timidity to solicit the indulgence of the public to this further attempt and am with the sincerest respect its much obliged and most grateful humble servant  THE AUTHOR  THE STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY  LETTER I  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  Delville  IF I was not a slave to my promise I should not write to you at present as I find myself utterly incapable of expressing the mixed sensation of my mindI have often complained of the inadequateness of language but never felt it more strongly than now the most copious that I am acquainted with could by no means afford you even an idea of  the different reflections that have progressively given place to each other in the space of eight and forty hours  I am provoked at this natural incapacity of conveying my sentiments to you words are but a cloak or rather a clog to our ideas there should be no curtain before the hearts of friends and the longing I have ever felt for an intuitive converse is to me a strong argument for a future stateWhat says my sceptical friend to this opinionDon't be alarmed I am not going to sermonizebut what is almost as dull to narrate  By the carelesness or ignorance of my postilion who drove me at least a dozen miles out of my road over Salisbury Plain it was near midnight before I reached this placeYou who are thoroughly acquainted with the natural warmth of my temper and know  how impatient I have been to embrace a favourite sister after an absence of twelve years may judge of my anxietybut there was no remedy and I strove to amuse the irksome tediousness of my journey by endeavouring to trace in my imagination the growing beauties of my Emma's features from ten years old when I last saw the little darling of our house to their meridian charms at twentytwo  At length we reached the gates of this noble edifice and had the pleasure to find the family not retired to rest by perceiving lights in the hallI enquired for Sir James Desmond as I was determined not to announce myself and I thought it rather too late for an unknown visitor to demand an interview with his ladyI was shewn into a saloon from whence the company had retired after supper and from an adjacent  apartment I heard a confused sound of voices intermixed with the detestable noise of a dicebox  In a few minutes all was hushed and a man whom I believed to be an upper servant was sent to reconnoitre my person and enquire my name and business I told him I should not reveal either but to his master He smiled as it now seems at my ignorance and withdrew In about ten minutes which seemed as many hours to me Sir James entered with an air compounded of  fierte  and timidity I presented myself with the best grace I possibly could and on mentioning my name was accosted with the utmost politeness by my brotherinlaw  On my expressing my impatience to see my sister he said he was pretty certain  that she was not gone to bed and offered to conduct me to her apartment I declined his offer till a stranger was announced to her for I wished to surprise not alarm her A servant was then sent to let her ladyship know that there was a gentleman from London who desired to pay his respects to herWe followed the servant to her dressingroom door she was sitting leaning on her elbow and seemed lost in thought the delivering of the message roused her from her reverie she started up and said who can it be at this late hour I flew and caught her in my arms crying out 'tis I 'tis Charles she pressed me to her bosom softly exclaimed my brother and almost fainted in my arms  I will not pretend to describe my sensation for the reasons given in the beginning of this letter but I am certain  I never felt such unimpassioned tenderness beforeSir James who was not much affected with our interview left us to go and order some refreshment for me tho' in truth I needed none my mind being so perfectly delighted with beholding my beloved sister whom I had ever thought on with all a father's fondness that I had no leisure to attend to the calls of appetite  I asked her a thousand questions without waiting for her answer except to one the number of her childrenshe replied I have but oneit is the image of our mother and named after herCome Charles and let me shew you my lovely FannyShe led me to the nursery where I beheld a little sleeping angel of about two years oldAs we crossed the staircase I again heard the dicebox rattleSir James is fond of play I fancy Emma said IShe affected  not to hear my question and did not answer it  A thousand disagreeable images rushed on my imagination in that instant I crushed their growth and talked of India of my other sisters Lucy and Mrs Selwyn and of you also till we were summoned to the saloon where supper was prepared for me  I there met three gentlemen with Sir James amongst whom was the person I had mistaken for a servant When he was presented to me I made my apology which he received with great good humour and congratulated Lady Desmond on my arrival with such apparent sincerity that I have taken a liking to this new acquaintance whose name is Sewell  We spent a couple of hours most agreeably my sister became quite chearful  Sir James and she sung two or three sweet duettos and we all retired to rest about three o'clock in the most perfect harmony and at this happy crisis I will leave you having run my letter into too great a length though I have a thousand things more to say to you but I have quite as many to say to Emma and so Sir you must as in duty bound give place to your betters as you have gallantry enough I hope to agree with me that all amiable women are so  Adieu  C EVELYN  LETTER II  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  Delville  YOU know what an investigator of human nature I am and yet here have I been four whole days and as many nights under the same roof with Sir James Desmond and cannot form any fixed idea of his character one hour tender and polite to his wife fond of his lovely child and easy in his manners to all around himThe next cold distrait nay peevish to my sister  insensible to the carresses of his little girl inattentive and indifferent to his guestshelp me Stanley to account for such an opposition of qualities and inconsistency of demeanour in the same individual  Too plainly I perceive that Emma is not happy yet she adores her husband and when she speaks of him her tongue grows wanton in his praise at his approach her eyes sparkle with delight but lose their lustre when his countenance changes as it sometimes does from gay to grave The variety of expression that Emma's Cameleonlike features receive from her Proteus serve but to heighten her beautyI should think that nothing could be more interesting than her sprightly glance if I had not seen her downcast eye  Why Stanley do all women affect to charm us by levity when our affections are much more liable to be attracted by an appearance of sensibility However it is not the semblance but the reality that can please as I have very lately experiencedWhere it is only assumed it is easily detected and when the paint is washed off the complexion looks the worse for having worn itaffectation in women and hypocrisy in men are equally detestable  I have very uneasy apprehensions tho' I hope they are not well founded that Sir James Desmond's ruling passion is the love of play Men addicted to this vice of all others shou'd never marry it absorbs every generous affection of the human heart The drunkard has intervals of sobriety and in those  may be capable of friendship and of fondnessThe choleric man is not always in a passion and is even proverbially good natured and humane sorry for and ready to atone the evil his short lived frenzy may have causedEven the libertine tho' he may cease to love most generally esteems a virtuous wife and if not a despicable wretch indeed endeavours to compensate for his want of fondness by generosity and politeness towards her  But let a man be once possessed with a passion for gaming he becomes incapable of honour or affection he wou'd wish to win money from his dearest friend tho' he knew that friend must be distressed by losing it and wou'd sacrifice the interest of his tenderest connection to gratify this sordid vice which  like a whirlpool swallows every virtueHis mind can never be at peace his losses are attended with a permanent regret his winnings with but a transient exultation The constant contention of his passion destroys his constitution and anticipates old age he passes his days and nights with harpies like himself he lives unloved and dies unlamented  I know not how I have been drawn into this long exclamation against a vice which you hold in as much abhorrence as I do but my mind was full of rancour against it merely on a supposition that it may interfere with the happiness of a beloved sisterI have now let out my venom and shall perhaps be able to throw off that reserve to Sir James and his associates  which this mental bile has hitherto been the cause of  I find from Emma that my brother was rather averse to her marrying Sir James Desmond but that he had suffered too much from a disappointed love to inflict such torments upon her as she then confessed to him and does now to me that she cou'd not have been happy with any other manMay her husband's gratitude reward her predilectionAnd indeed if my suspicion with regard to his love of play be groundless I doubt not but he will As I have already said he seems to love and esteem her the caprice of his temper may produce sudden changes in his manner but I think her beauty and tenderness must secure his affectionsI will think no more upon  this subject at present My mind is involuntarily occupied by more selfish reflections but in my next I shall afford you an opportunity of judging for yourself by reasoning from facts  Adieu  C EVELYN  LETTER III  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  I PROMISED in my last to give you the minute transactions of this family but how impossible not only them but every trace of my past life except thy friendship are vanished from my memory  My sentiments my passions are engrossed by one objectmy whole soul is hersnever was love so violent nor beauty so inspiring "Since the  first fair that Eden's garden graced"wou'd she were my Eve and I her Adam For in this peopled world there is no doubt but that she must have had as many lovers as beholdersPerhaps some favoured youth has already touched her gentle heart and your unhappy friend must sigh in vainjealousy is twinborn with love but so is hope and I will hope while I existdespair and death to me can be but one  I will strive to methodize my thoughts a little and attempt a description of this charming woman though I know it impossible to give you a just idea of her perfections We were at breakfast in Lady Desmond's dressingroom when a servant announced the arrival of Lady Juliana Harleymy sister's eyes sparkled with joy at her approach  She was dressed in a light grey cassimere cloth habit embroidered with black her hair was turned up under a white riding hat in which was a black band and feather some of her lovely auburn locks had broke from their confinement and wandered carelessly o'er her snowy neckshe is a little taller than the middle size her complexion dazzlingly fair the colour in her cheeks so faint so transient that you can hardly pronounce there is any except when she speaks or is addressed and then we may say with Donne  Her pure and eloquent blood  Spoke in her cheeks and so distinctly wrought  That one would almost say her body thought  This circumstance however tho' it may perhaps lessen her beauties increases  her charms for by appearing not to have been any original defect in her complexion but the casual effect of misfortune or illhealth captivate us thro' sympathy which is always stronger than the senses Her eyes dark blue adorned with long black eyelashes her brows of the same colour her nose the perfect Grecian her lips and teethbut I shall attempt no moreA statue may be described but not a living Venusshe seems to be about four and twenty and has been near two years a widow  Emma tells me that my elder brother had been proposed for her before her marriage with Mr Harley but her father the Earl of K had already entered into a treaty with her late husband and poor Harry was of course  refusedI grieve now for what he must have suffered at that time but console myself with thinking that he would have had a much severer struggle on his leaving life had he been possessed of such an object At least I strive to persuade myself that it was happy for him he was not married to Lady Juliana as I may hope at the same time that it was very fortunate for me  This charming woman has promised to stay a fortnight with my sister and then we are all to go to London togetherI will use all my interest with Emma to delay her journey and detain her lovely guest for a longer term If I do not obtain some little share in her heart whilst she remains under the same roof with me where I have a thousand opportunities of marking my attentions  without appearing to obtrude them I must despair of making any impression when she will be surrounded by crouds of admirers and hurried into all the dissipation of the gay world  The country as the poets tell us is the scene for love the pleasing objects that surround us the pureness of the air but above all its stillness harmonize the soul and render it susceptible of every soft and tender feelingNoise is an enemy to all the gentle passions I agree with Sterne that a lover who was unfortunate enough to throw down the fire shovel and tongs when he was going to prostrate himself at his mistress's feet cou'd have very little hopes of success from his flurried fair one  Silence is rendered vocal at this moment by the soft sounds of Lady Juliana's and my sister's voices under my windowThey are going to walk perhapsI fly I follow them  Adieu  CHARLES EVELYN  LETTER IV  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  SOME French writer says  That there are men who are such egotists that rather than not talk of themselves they wou'd even reveal their failings  Those men were never in love or they wou'd have experienced a much higher delight in talking of the object of their affections than of themselves  For my part I can neither think talk or write upon any other subject than the  charming JulianaIf you were not a lover I shou'd fear you wou'd soon grow tired of my correspondence but as I know you are capable of all the pleasing weaknesses necessarily attendant upon that character I trust you will indulge me on my favourite topic  In my last I gave you a faint sketch of lady Juliana's personal charms but believe me Stanley no pen or pencil can describe the winning softness and attractive grace that accompanies her every look and motionI have seen many elegant women but she is elegance personified  ipsa forma  There is a plaintive sweetness in her voice that wou'd render the most trifling expressions interesting even a blind man who did not understand her language wou'd be enamoured of the soundShe  talks but little and when she ceases I feel like our progenitor when Raphael left off speaking  The Angel ended and in Adam's ear  So charming left his voice that he awhile  Thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear  Her words upon every subject on which she converses are perfectly well chosen from whence I conclude she has read the best authors in our language she is a perfect mistress of the French and Emma says plays finely on the harpsichord but has not been prevailed on since she came here to afford us this delight I have never seen her laugh and she sighs oftener than she smilesshe seems to labour under an habitual melancholy which gives an additional softness both to her looks and manner  Do you know that notwithstanding our friendship I should not be quite easy at your seeing Lady Juliana if I was not convinced that Lucy has an unbounded power over your affections and will of course be kind enough to herself and me to prevent your becoming my rival As to the men who are in this house they are so entirely occupied by their sordid passion for gaming that I almost doubt whether the united charms of the whole sex could be able to make any impression on them Their hearts are tied up in their purses But though I despise their stupidity I am indebted to it as it occasions their retiring to a distant apartment every day after dinner to pursue their sports and pastimes and leaves me happier than an emperor in the society of two most charming women  I am sometimes permitted to read to them Milton is a favourite of Lady Juliana's and you may see by my quotation that our tastes are the same I have sometimes perceived while I have been reading that she has looked earnestly upon me but the moment I have raised my eyes in hopes of meeting hers their modest lids have veiled them from my sight and I have frequently observed a silent tear steal down her lovely cheek  What can these marks of sorrow mean I wou'd give worlds to know provided it was in my power to remove the causeEmma too whom you know to be the gentlest of the gentle kind appears absent and lost in thought frequentlyFrom this account you will not suppose that our evenings are passed in the most lively manner Yet believe me Stanley I wou'd not exchange the pleasure  I receive from this devotement of my time for  The broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears  The minutes seem to fly while our society is confined to a triumvirate but as soon as Sir James and his companions join us Lady Juliana retires and then all is what they call jollity and I call noise  I don't know whether you may not be inclined to laugh at my Sombre ideas of happiness I know Lucy will if you shew her my letter be that as it may I am certain I never was half so happy before though perhaps neither you or she wou'd be so in the same situationI therefore wish ye both all the pleasures the gay world can give and am most affectionately yours  C EVELYN  LETTER V  WILLIAM STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN  Holy St Francis what a change is here  Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear  So soon forsaken  AND now I suppose like your gallant prototype Monsieur Romeo you have totally forgotten your former mistress and are ready to hang drown or put an end to your miserable existence in any other doleful way all for the love of your fair Juliet Alas poor Charleshowever I am glad you have  been laid hold of by this charming relictLovemaking and haymaking are the two most delightful rural pastimes that I know of but it is not requisite that both should be done  while the sun shines  for the first is just as agreeable by a fireside under a roof with or without the singing of cagebirds as in a summer's evening under the shade of a beech to the soft notes of the nightingaleFor notwithstanding all that you or the poets have said in praise of the country I will venture to promise that your fond vows will be just as well received by Lady Juliana at her house in Berkeleysquare as in the mossgrown woods or floweringshrubbery at DelvilleIt is the man and not the place that must render his passion acceptable for every spot is an Eden with those we love  I will allow there is much pleasure and perhaps some little advantage too in being in the same house with the object of our affections whilst we are endeavouring to inspire a reciprocal one but that once having taken effect believe me it is much more for the interest of the lover to be placed at a little distance than too near The plesaure of expecting his approach fixes the fairone's attention to his most agreeable qualities and the flattering likeness which her fondness and selflove join to draw off the absent idol generally exceeds the merits of the original  If therefore you can flatter yourself with having made any impression on Lady Juliana's heart and are seriously  in love yourself which I know not how to believe after your seeming attachment to Miss Morton don't be afraid of her Ladyship's coming to Londonremember  That to a woman that loves there is but  one  man in the world  Some ladywriter has refined upon this sentiment of Rousseau's and says That to a woman who truly loves there is  no  man in the world the object is  more  and every other  less  I admire your ingenuity in endeavouring to persuade yourself that your brother's being unsuccessful in his addresses was a fortunate circumstance for him because it is a lucky one for youjust so do all men reason who speak from their passions Selflove is an artful sophister and I have no doubt but you cou'd easily prevail upon yourself to believe that it was a great advantage to  poor Harry to be taken off by a fever in his eightandtwentieth year as his death has put you into possession of a noble estate and recalled you from India's burning soil to the mild climate of your native land  Your serious complaint of the inadequateness of language in your first letter made me smilebelieve me you were more at a loss for ideas than words when you sat down to write or at least the former wanted pr  ision for nothing can be clearer to me than that you were then undetermined with regard to Sir James Desmond's characterthe new lights thrown upon it since in my mind do but puzzle the causeI am not personally acquainted with him but he is generally well spoken of tho' said to be remarkably fond of play and  I have heard it hinted that he has suffered by it considerably  I can't tell why I should dislike your new acquaintance Mr Sewell and yet I doyour mistaking him for a servant is against hima meanness either in manners or appearance is no favourable prognosticordon't be angry Charles but possibly my antipathy may have arisen from your too sudden sympathy Not from any spirit of contradiction but that I know you are often too liable to  impromptu  attachments both in love and friendshipAnd yet tho' you have smarted pretty severely for a firstsight connection before now I wou'd not if I cou'd restrain the openness and benevolence of your natureEvery man that is not himself a knave is liable to be duped by one till a thorough knowledge of the world has taught him caution at the cost  of one of the highest pleasures in lifethat of thinking well of human nature  I don't know whether your sisters Mrs Selwyn and  my  Lucy for I still hope to call her mine have not reason to be jealous in the friendly way of your partiality to Lady Desmondshe cannot in my mind have more excellent or amiable qualities than your eldest sister nor is it possible that she can have more charms either in mind or person than your youngest But I will not hint this unjust preference to either of them particularly as I have reason from your last letter to believe that they and all the rest of the world are quite upon a par in your present estimation your whole quota of fond affections being absolutely devoted to the transcendent beauties of your divine  JulianaI hope that last line is sublime enough to satisfy your lovership  Adieu my dear Charles I have said nothing of my own affairs because they are still in an unpleasant train  Your's W STANLEY  P S I shewed your last letter to Lucy she smiled and said some men have strange fancies  LETTER VI  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  UPON my honour you do me wrong StanleyI never loved or feigned to love Miss MortonI thought her lively elegant and sensible and still think her so but were every charm she possesses augmented beyond the power of numbers to encrease my heart could hold no sympathy with hersFor if she has a heart it is an unfeeling oneDo not mistake me now by supposing that  I complain of her coldness from having experienced itBelieve me I never proceeded so far as to meet with a repulse  When I first came to England I saw her often liked nay admired and might perhaps have loved her had not the worthlessness of her disposition broke thro' the cobweb veil of an affected sensibility and turned my admiration to disgustYou may remember that at the time of my arrival in London Miss Morton was on a visit at my sister Selwyn's this circumstance occasioned our being particularly intimate we spent almost our whole time together and whether from any little design of rendering herself agreeable to me by indulging what you call my foible or from an affectation of singular sensibility I know not she used to launch forth into such effusion of sentimental tenderness and generosity as exceeded  even our eastern ideas of humanityI have seen her ready to weep for a drowning fly and my sister Lucy used to say Miss Morton cou'd only be a fit wife for  The Man of Feeling  The title of a novel    It happened one summer's evening that we three walked in the park till near dusk as we came down ConstitutionHill a young woman in a wretched garb with a pale and emaciated countenance passed closely by us Chance and chance alone directed my eyes to glance full upon hers in a moment her face was suffused with crimson she turned her head aside quickened her pace and was almost instantly out of sight  Nothing is so swift as thought a ray of recollection beamed upon my mind and  brought back to my remembrance the once smiling countenance of Nancy Weston whose father had been one of the under masters at Winchester at whose house I boarded when I was placed at college thereHer appearance spoke distress  saas  adieu I quitted the ladies and set out with hasty strides to overtake and acknowledge my former playfellow or rather plaything for she was some years younger than myself and I had borne her in my arms a thousand times What convinced me that I was not mistaken in my conjecture with regard to the identity of the person was a pretty large mole at the bottom of her left cheek which used to give a thousand nameless graces to her mouth  I reached the top of the hill without perceiving the object of my pursuit but upon looking backwards I saw her lying  on the ground at some distance from the footpath with her face covered by her handsThe little effort which conscious shame had impelled her feebleness to make in order to pass unnoticed by me had totally exhausted her last remains of strength and perhaps she had said with Jane Shore  Why shou'd I wander stray farther on for I can die even here  I flew directly towards her and raised her almost lifeless body from the earthshe could not articulate a single word but the dumb eloquence of flowing tears too plainly spoke unutterable woeI saw a gentleman passing at some distance and called to him for help as he came near I entreated him to use the utmost expedition to fetch a chair to receive a young woman that I feared was dyinghe said he was sorry my humanity was not  bestowed upon a worthier object as he supposed her to be one of those unhappy wretches who nightlyinfest the park but she shou'd not however perish for want of his assistance and at that moment set forward to call a chair in which at his return I placed her and desired the men to carry her gently to the first apothecary's shop in Picadilly whither I attended her  Every medicinal aid that is usually given to fainting persons was administered to her and she revived a littlethe humane apothecary said she wanted food more than physic and made her eat a little bread and drink some wine and water I then desired her to direct the chairmen to her home and said I wou'd follow her thithershe raised her languid eyes and said in a low and scarcely articulate voice  I have no home  I then requested the apothecary to provide a  lodging for her near him and to attend her both as a physician and a friend promising to be answerable for any expence and trouble that might be incurred upon her account and as a counter security to which engagement left a bill for fifty pounds in his hands to be settled for at some future day  The poor unhappy girl then fell on her knees before me pouring out the strongest expressions of gratitude for my kindness I intreated her to compose her shattered spirits for the present and to rely upon my friendship not to desert her let her faults or misfortunes be of what nature soever they might So leaving my address with her that she might know where to apply I returned to Mrs Selwyn's in order to account for my abrupt manner of quitting Miss Morton and Lucy  When I had told my tale I expected to see the bewitching tear of pity stand in Miss Morton's eyewhen to my amazement a settled gloom loured on her brow and indignation sparkled from her eyesshe continued silent till I addressed myself to her and Lucy requesting them to spare me some part of their wardrobe to supply the immediate necessities of the unhappy Nancy Weston till there cou'd be some procured more suited to her humble station  No words can describe the rage with which she told me that she was astonished both at my insolence and meanness in expecting that she wou'd suffer any thing she had ever worn to be contaminated by the person of a prostitute for such she was sure I had known her to be and if I intended to restore her to  her former situation she thought it wou'd be but decent to cloath her at my own rather than at any other person's expence  It is impossible to express the sudden and forcible effect which both the manner and matter of Miss Morton's harangue produced on me Suffice it to say that they  unsexed  her even from top to toeand from that hour I have ever looked upon her mind with detestation and her person with disgust  I have entered into this long detail to acquit myself of a charge which by the generality of the world is scarcely deemed a vice but which I consider as an act of baseness that of engaging the affections of an innocent heart and then repaying its unmerited tenderness with  black ingratitudeBanished be the vile idea from every honest breast and may his couch be ever strewed with thorns that can for his sport create a pang in the bosom of unsuspecting innocence  Away with the unpleasing subject and let it prove to my Stanley of how much consequence his esteem is to my happiness when I tell him that it is now three o'clock in the morning that I have danced from eight in the evening but not with Lady Juliana she having retired with visible dejection to her chamber on the arrival of some company yet could not lay me down in peace till I had removed the unjust suspicion he has hinted tho' seemingly in jest of my being a faithless lover or in other words a scoundrelBut tho' at this moment I am very far  from being happy either on my own or Emma's account I have the consolation of thinking that I have not deserved to be wretched and of knowing that I may boldly subscribe myself your  sincere  Friend  CHARLES EVELYN  P S Lady Juliana has appeared for some days past much graver than usualshe declines any little service from me tho' of ever so trifling a nature and seems cautiously to avoid entering into any conversation with me tho' in a mixed company Ah Stanley I have no hopes of making any impression on her heart either at Delville or in Berkeleysquare  Mr Sewell has lately dropped some hints to me that Sir James Desmond's  finances are a good deal embarrassed by his ill success at play I think this person will justify my predeliction in his favour as he talks so very sensibly against both the vice and folly of gaming But that in so unaffected a manner that he acknowledges the necessity of it to those who would live in the world as at present constituted This is too sad a truthThe manners of life however corrupt must be our rule of action if we would preserve our rank in itHe who would be virtuous alone must live alone While he has been speaking upon this subject I have seen my sister steal a tender look at her husband more persuasive than all the rhetoric of DemosthenesBut if she cannot cure his disease I can prevent its effects from becoming fatal for the present at least I should be happy to  do soif I cou'd be happySend me bills for the enclosed draft by return of the postI may perhaps have occasion for more than mere travelling expences before I leave this  LETTER VII  WILLIAM STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN  IT is now very near eleven o'clock and I am but this moment returned from an excursion I made into Kent for three or four days of course I did not receive your letter till this instantI should think myself unworthy of the very delicate attention you have shewn to my good opinion were I to delay the thanks that are due for it to another postaccept them my dear Evelyn and be assured that I consider  your generous impatience of blame upon an article too lightly treated by the generality of men as the strongest proof of your friendshipThe highest compliment we can pay to those we regard is the endeavouring to appear worthy of their esteem for tho' love may friendship never did or will subsist without a mutual exertion of good qualities as well as of kind officesand he who can acquiesce in another's thinking meanly of him betrays an equal want of regard to him and of respect to himselfso much in honour of your nice feelings and I heartily wish that all men and women too were possessed of the sameparticularly the latter who like "Caesar's wife ought not to be even suspected"  I am extremely pleased at the little novel which my raillery for indeed I  meant no more extorted from youPray at your leisure let me have the remainder of Nancy Weston's story I feel myself much interested for her which is more than I ever was for Miss Morton she always appearing to me a sort of madeup Miss than which I know not a less amiable character  O Charles if women wou'd but trust to nature for their power to charm and scorn the mean the treacherous auxiliary of art how unbounded wou'd be their dominion over usBut I have not time now to expatiate on a topic that has ever been my favourite oneFor my mind is nice tho' my moral is not severe  I am glad to hear that Lady Juliana is grown cold and reserved to youIt is at least a tacit confession that she is apprized  of your passionNo woman ventures to be disagreeably distant to a man to whom she has once been civil till she is quite certain that her caprice will render him unhappyLadies are too tenacious of their sway to attempt an exertion of it where it is not likely to be felt but your true lover is the properest object in the world for tyranny and seems really designed for no other purpose but to be trampled on  Courage then CharlesThe ice at least is broken and in such a changeable latitude who knows how soon the wind may veer about to the south and breathe its soft Etesian gales upon you You will I doubt not perceive that I am not at present much inclined to write a panegyric upon  the fair sex  and will of course conclude that Lucy and I have had a  brouillerie  I always  squabble with those I lovebecause they won't let me have  my own way  for with those I care not about I have  no way at all  Yes Evelyn your sister isa dear delightful charming womangood night  W STANLEY  Your bills shall be sent by next post  LETTER VIII  LADY JULIANA HARLEY TO MISS LUCY EVELYN  I KNOW it will give my Lucy pleasure to hear that I have passed some time with her amiable friends at Delville I acknowledge a secret and irresistible charm that attaches me to every part of the Evelyn family and in the society of Lady Desmond tho' far less intimately connected with her than you I hoped I should recover my spirits so far as to enable me to indulge your request of  passing some months of the approaching winter in London  The unexpected meeting with Mr Evelyn at first a good deal disconcerted me for I am little used to seeing strangers His appearance perhaps too strongly recalled the idea of his brother but by degrees the painful suggestions of memory became less poignant and I fancied I might with safety indulge the melancholy pleasure of tracing Henry's features in his brother's face  But even this transientwhat shall I call it alas it will not bear the name of happinesscou'd not arrive to me without alloy  Not to deal longer in mystery your brother to his great misfortune as well as mine I fear has conceived an affection  for me Nay I know he hasDissembling is beneath megracious heaven why was I born to be a curse to all the Evelyn race Why am I doomed to be the source of misery to those whom I love best on earth This is beyond the common course of ills  But let me recollect myselfYour brother's passions seem to be violent and therefore may be the less permanentI will stop the growing mischief then by flying from his fight I had resolved to go to London with Lady Desmond and have sent my servants thitherno matterI will return to Yorkshire which I never more intended to visit and pass the winter there or any where rather than hazard your brother's Lady Desmond's and my Lucy's peace  You may perhaps think that I am too easily alarmed upon this subject but O my friend those who have felt the pangs of real love should dread inflicting where they cannot heal them and pity poor cold pity is all that now is left me to bestow  Your brother has not yet made any explicit declaration of his attachment towards me his pride will therefore be saved from the mortification of thinking that I fly from himTrifling as this consolation may appear I am glad he is in possession of it as any other reason that he may assign for my shunning his addresses must be less painful than the real one  If I were writing to any other person I should have some apprehension lest they might suppose my vanity had mistaken  Mr Evelyn's natural politeness for the effects of a commencing passion but his every look and action bear so striking a resemblance to those of his lamented brother who loved me but too well that it is impossible to doubt their motivebesides my Lucy is a perfect Columbus in the  terra incognita  of lovers hearts and discovered her faithful Stanley's fond attachment in his speaking eyes for many months before his tongue revealed ithappy happy Lucy whose hand and heart are free to bless the man who best deserves them whilst IHere let me stop nor pain your gentle breast with my complainings  I shall quit this house tomorrow five minutes before I set out I will acquaint Lady Desmond with my intention of returning into the NorthHow shall I be able to conceal the cause of this sudden  alteration in my purpose from her yet I will conceal it from her from all the world but you  Write to me I intreat you tho' I know I need notThe friend of my heart will continue as she has ever been attentive to its happiness  Adieu  J HARLEY  LETTER IX  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  O STANLEY she is gone fled and much I fear it is from me she flies  Last night curse on all sports and sportsmen Sir James Desmond proposed our going out a shooting this morning early the day was gloomy and it was near nine o'clock before we determined upon setting outThe ladies as I thought were not yet risenwhile our horses were getting ready I took a turn  in the garden and at some distance heard the sound of female voicesI stopped to listen from whence they came and at that instant perceived Lady Juliana and my sister coming towards me in close conferencethey seemed to be engaged upon some very important subject and I fancied I heard my name mentionedthe moment they beheld me they turned about and with a quickened pace shot down another walkI saw they wished to avoid me and therefore returned directly into the house I joined Sir James and his friends and we set out together but I was too much occupied with the scene that had just passed before me to be at all interested in their sportthey rallied me upon my inattention and wished me to return home as I interrupted their amusement without seeming to be myself amusedI readily accepted my  congé  and clapping spurs  to my horse galloped back again with an unspeakable anxiety  I found my sister alone in the drawing room and instantly enquired for Lady Julianashe replied with a melancholy accent she has left us CharlesWhither is she gone and what cou'd be the cause of such a sudden flightOn both these subjects I am as ignorant as you can be It is impossible I cried but if you ever loved me Emma tell me and tell me truly have I offended Lady Juliana and is it from my hated sight she fliesI am sure she does not hate you she replied for her nature is incapable of repaying hatred  for love  What then she knows I love herFrom her discourse I believe she  fears  you dobut be composed sit down I beg of youWherefore shou'd she  fear  it Does she think meanly of me My  brother was not thought unworthy her alliance she wou'd have given her hand to him but that her father's promise was engaged to one she never lovedbut I will know the cause of her disdain from her own lips will know it I rang the bell and ordered my chaise to be got ready instantly Emma burst into tears and said do not render me more unhappy than I am alreadymy brother do not leave me in distress  Alarmed as all my passions were her gentle accents vibrated upon my heart and calmed each throbbing pulseI sat down by her took her trembling hand and said what does my Emma meanCan I relieve her sorrowsHer tears flowed more abundantly and for some minutes stopped her utteranceat length turning her head away from me she said yes Charles thank heaven  you can but do not let the present circumstance lessen my husband in your esteem no man is perfect and Sir James has but one faulthe is too fond of playThere is an execution in our house this moment for seven hundred poundsI wou'd have joined with my husband to raise the money by relinquishing my jointurebut he wou'd not listen to the proposal declaring he wou'd perish in a gaol rather than injure me or our dear little FannyHe is indeed my brother the tenderest of husbands and of fathers  Of those particulars Emma said I you certainly are the best judge but have I not reason to resent Sir James's want of confidence in me Why did he not prevent this disgrace to himself and family by acquainting me with his  necessitiesCou'd he suppose me mean enough to suffer you to be distressed for any sum within my power to raiseAh Charles she replied catching my hand the mind that feels its own reproach dreads to expose itself to that of othersThey who have lost the fear of being contemned most generally deserve to be so  I will believe you reason justly Emma and wou'd not if I cou'd refute your argument but time now pressesIt is impossible that I can rest till my doom is pronounced by Lady Julianathis night I must leave Delville and am at present no otherways prepared to extricate you from your irksome situation than by taking the debt upon myself if your creditor will accept my security I am ready to give it but as  I am not known to him he may perhaps objectIf I cou'd stay but three days longer it might be more easily accomplished for from some hints that have been dropped in relation to Sir James's circumstances I drew upon my banker for a thousand pounds but I cannot expect the bills shou'd be returned to me till Friday at the soonest  It is no matter she replied Mr Sewell will I doubt not gladly accept of your security Is Sewell then your creditor I exclaimed Cou'd he lodge an execution in the house under whose roof he dwells I know not how it is my brother but I believe the money was originally lost at play to Mr SewellSir James gave him a bond on which he raised the money from his brother who now exacts the payment in this severe manner  I fear then Emma Sewell is a knave and joined in mean collusion with his brother to distress your husband who looks upon him as his friendYou are deceived Charles I am sure he is Sir James's friend and mine by his perpetually dissuading him from playIt may be so but tell me Emma all you know and all you think of Lady Juliana's sudden departure what can it mean  She replied I again repeat to you that I am as ignorant of Lady Juliana's motives for her conduct as yourselfthough to all appearance she has been perfectly blameless through the whole course of her life her actions have always been involved in a sort of mystery and seemingly inconsistent to my apprehensionMy sister Lucy may possibly be better acquainted with her  sentiments than I am as she was very intimate with her even before her marriage She did not continue in that state above four months and tho' I had reason to believe she was an unhappy wife she lamented her husband's untimely death with such an extravagance of sorrow as placed her very nearly on a footing with the Malabarian widows for her health was so much impaired by her grief that it was thought impossible she cou'd recover nor have I ever seen her chearful since her husband diedBut from the moment she perceived your particular attachment her melancholy was encreased and she has seemed twenty times upon the point of expressing her uneasiness at your constant assiduities For these last three days she appeared to be quite retired within herself and I have had so many disagreeable things to engross my  thoughts that I was rather pleased at her reserve and did not attempt to draw her out of it  This morning she sent her woman to let me know that she wished to speak with me and that I shou'd find her in the garden to which I instantly repaired She was seated in the temple by the river's side leaning on her arm and seemed lost in thought when I approached her she started from her reverie and saidThe ill fate that has ever attended me prevents my staying longer at Delville or accompanying you to London I was born to create misery where I wish to confer happiness but I will not voluntarily increase the baneful influence of that malignant fatality which dwells around meFor this reason only do I now take a precipitate leave of you my dear Lady Desmond intreating you not to  mention my departure till I have been gone some hours  I at first proceeded Emma endeavoured to rally her out of her resolution and told her that she seemed by her phrase to have been studying judicial astrology but that I was a greater conjuror than she took me for and assured her that I saw no baneful influence nor malignant fatality in her horoscope but on the contrary love joy and harmony proceeding from the little twinkling star that had directed her steps to Delville from which place I earnestly entreated she wou'd not depart till we all set out together  I had forced a smile into my countenance while I talked to her and did not till I had done speaking perceive that her eyes were filled with tearsShe turned her face from me and stepping  out of the temple said Lady Desmond has too much humanity to jest with the sorrows of her friend did she believe them realand I have too much tenderness for her to convince her that they are soagain I take my leave wishing every good on earth to her and all that have the happiness to belong to her once more repeating my request of concealing my departureThe reason of this request must be sufficiently obvious to a person endowed with less perspicuity than are any of  Mr Evelyn's sisters  I need not proceed to relate Emma's entreaties or Lady Juliana's refusalsit is from me she flieswhy then do I pursue her What a question Do we not all pursue whate'er eludes our wish and shun the bliss that meets it and sure if ever man was yet impelled by an irresistible impulse I am  You will perhaps smile at the seeming inconsistency of contenting myself with expressing my ardor thro' a long letter instead of indulging it by pursuing the fair fugitive but at present my impetuous passion is controuled by fraternal affectionI cannot leave my sister in distress and to relieve her from it I must wait the return of Sir James Desmond and his companions of the field  They are arrived I hear their boisterous and unmeaning mirth Sir James's voice sounds louder than the restthoughtless man  Adieu my Stanley  C EVELYN  I find it impossible to set out this nightSewell's brother is to be sent forHow cruel this delay I have this moment  received your short billet accept my thanks in return they are all I have to offer my mind is too much disturbed to think on any subject but one and I have already tired you with thatI detest hazard and yet am going to play at itThey say it interests and agitatesI deny its power except on those whose minds are tainted with the meanest of all vices avariceBut I have a purpose in it which is not quite so selfish  LETTER X  MISS EVELYN TO LADY JULIANA HARLEY  I DO really and truly begin to think that you my dear Lady Juliana and all the rest of the world are agreed in believing that I am literally hewn out of a marble block and can bear disappointments and vexations as unfeelingly as the  foresaid sturdy substance can endure the  rokes of the hammer and the chissel But ye are all mistaken for I am and  ver will be exceedingly grieved and provoked  at the absurdities of my friends when they are either weak or malicious enough to interfere with my happiness or their own  Why thou inhuman fair one what a roundeau of delights has thy caprice destroyed I could cry with vexation when I think of the dear little parties I had formed in your box at the opera your Charles and my William with the Lords A B C and so on to the end of the alphabet "Making their bends adorings"Our suppers at Almack's our private balls our masquerades but above all our  quarres  with our Corydons in Berkeleysquareand can I bear the disappointment and all for what why truly because the thing in the world which was most likely to happen and which I most wished has actually come to passthat Charles Evelyn shou'd fall  in love with Lady JulianaO cruel cruel friend thou hast almost broke my heart  But to be serious for whatever you may think I am by no means inclined to jest upon this subject what are these dreadful portents that have alarmed you and driven you at this season of the year to the very antipodes of our delights the chilling North If you really did not like my brother tho' I must say I see no reason why you should not you need not have given him any encouragement but merely suffered him to dangle after you till the beginning of next summer and by that time either he wou'd have been tired of serving without wages or you wou'd have been ashamed of acting a shabby part and so have paid the man for his pain and passion with your lovely self  For the sake of common sense my dear Juliana think better of this business away with those glooms that should have been put off with your sables and order your chaise to London  You cannot imagine how much I am distressed for a  chaperon  my sister Selwyn is within a month or six weeks of lyingin and goes no wheremy sister Desmond is not come to town and when she does will be so taken up with her domestic concerns her child and her husband to be sure that I am not to expect much comfort from herNow you are to know as a very great secret that this is the last year of my reignI feel that I must abdicate in spring if possible it shall not be till the Ranelagh season is near overbut I must not trifle longer with StanleyYou cannot conceive how I love him and yet I have now cookedup  a most delicious quarrel about Maria Morton whom I know he detests and indeed so do all the men of her acquaintance merely to prevent his teizing me into matrimony at this time of the year when one has  something else to do  I have now laid all my distresses before you and if your heart is not as much steeled to friendship as to love you will have pity on the sister tho' ever so obdurate to the brother and fly to the relief of your  LUCY EVELYN  LETTER XI  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  Delville  FATE seems to oppose my every purpose Stanley here am I still detained by drifting snows and piercing winds not that their force shou'd stop my progress on my own account  nor storms nor night should keep me here  but that fellow Sewell's brother who derives his greatness from that of his debtors and says like Cacofogo  The King of  Spain owes me money  will not set out from his cottage tho' 'tis but eighteen miles off till the weather mends forsoothand here must I wait like St Laurence on the gridiron till his usurership arrives  I sat down to hazard as I told you last night determined like our former kings on a twelfth night if possible to lose a thousand pounds to Sir James and make that sum a debt which must otherwise be deemed a courtesybut here chance unluckily opposed my puposeFortune as she is called favoured or rather disappointed me I won every thing the baronet and both his companions are my debtors  N B Sewell has again recovered some part of my esteem he lost his money  like a gentleman  one must borrow similies  when they can't frame themthe other one Simpson who they say is rich seem'd to suffer the most dreadful agonies and sometimes vented his feelings in horrid imprecations O Stanley how is it possible that a rational being shou'd ever put himself a second time into such a situation as to render him at once both unhappy and contemptible  Your letter has most agreeably interrupted my moralizingThanks to my friend for his punctuality I will this moment go and present the bills to Emma Sir James is not yet risen if I can quit Delville without seeing him it will save both him and me from an equal embarrassment yet their is something tells me that my going  sans  adieu may in his present situation perhaps offend the baronet and all impatient as I am I will stay breakfast  Beyond the fixed and  settled rules  This little business is finished and if I could describe the grateful tenderness with which Emma received the present you wou'd be charmed with the portrait StanleySir James Desmond too seemed to accept it from her hands with more sensibility and dignity than I imagined him possessed of  Does not our selflove sometimes suppose merits where we bestow our favours in order to heighten our own pleasure in the act of benevolenceI am not at leisure now to investigate the philosophy of this idea but I am persuaded that we are generally more strongly attached to those we have obliged than even to those who have obliged usIs it not usury then to expect gratitude Not that I wou'd encourage the modern philosophy which reduces all virtue to selfinterest for if I may  hazard an  unborrowed simile  the liberal mind may be compared to the  Nile  which enriches the soil from its own abundance without requiring any return  Adieu for a few hours  C EVELYN  LETTER XII  MISS EVELYN TO LADY JULIANA HARLEY  ClargesStreet  I HAVE often heard that love makes wise men fools and "turns our wits the seamy side without"Poor Charles It was almost midnight when he arrived here last night pale as ashes his eyes wild and haggard and his hair undress'd My sister Selwyn had not been well all day and was retired to restThe moment he came into the parlour where I was sitting he cried out Where is she Lucy Gone to bed said I thinking  he enquired after Mrs SelwynDo not torture me he replied but tell me where is lady Juliana  A strange question truly answered I surely you have seen her long since I didI spoke this in a miff for I thought he might have first enquired his sister's health after an absence of above a monthQuite frantic he threw himself at my feet and said he wou'd not stir from thence till I informed him where you were for that Stanley had told him he believed I knew  Mem  I shall punish Mr Stanley pretty handsomely for pretending to guess at my secrets Mr Selwyn who was in his library in the next room composing a sermon for ought I know alarmed by the noise this inamorato made peeped into the parlour with his glasses on and seeing a man at my feet seemed doubtful whether  he should retire or advance till I intreated him to come in assuring him it was not a lover but a lunatic he beheld in that situationYou are mistaken Lucy Charles exclaimed I am the tenderest fondest most unhappy lover that ever yet existed and if you have not a mind to drive me to distraction you will acquaint me where my deity resides and let me kneel before the shrine which she inhabits with purest adoration  Psha very prophane that said Mr SelwynFor Heaven's sake Charles said I rise and compose yourselfyou must be very certain that if lady Juliana had entrusted me with any thing she chose to keep a secret I would not violate the trust by revealing it to you you can therefore receive no benefit from Mr Stanley's information But whatever are her motives for retirement I hope they  will not operate long and that she will be restored to the society of her friends in a few days or weeks at farthest  Days or weeks exclaimed heyou talk of centuries I tell you Lucy I will not rest till I behold herNay then said Mr Selwyn I shall wish you a good night it will be vain for me to sit up any longer but if you chuse to pass the night without sleep I will order the servants to mend the fire bring you fresh candles and go to bed for they must rise in the morning I could not help smiling at Mr Selwyn's literal conception of my brother's expressionCharles seemed much offended with both of us and rushed out of the room without even bidding us good night  Now madam what do you think of the mischief your cruelty or caprice rather  has occasioned May I not say with Ophelia  O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown  And have I not a right in common justice to demand the restoration of my brother's senses from your ladyship or some other averdupois equivalent for the loss In short my dear Juliana if you have any friendship for me you will immediately come to London and make an end of this simple businessIf you cannot like my brother tell him so and perhaps the wound which his selflove must receive from your denial may rouse him to attempt the conquest of an hopeless passion  I am rather surprized at not having seen my poor lunatic today my sister Selwyn is quite grieved about him and sent this morning to know how he did and to invite him to dinnerbut the servant returned with a  non inventus  he had drove out of townwhither can he have taken his flight Mr Selwyn thinks he ought to be put under Doctor Monro's care but I make bold to say that you and only you can effect his cureHasten then my sweet friend to the relief both of Charles and  LUCY EVELYN  LETTER XIII  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  Bath  NO Stanley she is not here and this place though througed with numbers of the young and gay is to me a desart Yet I confess there was a probability of meeting or at least hearing of her in such a concourse of people of her own rankyet no tidings of her have yet reached me  Pardon me Stanley if I say that I can hardly forgive your LucyI will not call her my sisterShe certainly knows where Lady Juliana is and yet is so inhuman to conceal it from meSurely you must have power sufficient over her to make her reveal the secret be assured if she refuses to let you know it she is not worthy of your affection for I am certain it is impossible for a woman to deny any thing to the solicitations of the man she loves This maxim is too frequently proved to admit of its being doubted but what a wretch is he who takes advantage of its certainty to betray unsuspecting innocence or to involve the being he pretends to love in misery and guilt  I have been led into this reflection by the unsought confidence of our schoolfellow Capt Williams whom I happened  to meet with here and who is a very libertine and at present engaged in an unworthy attempt on a young lady his equal in birth though not in fortune She has a brother in the army who is expected daily from Ireland and the apprehension of his arrival hurries Williams into the most imprudent conduct so that the young lady will probably lose her reputation if her brother should even come time enough to protect her innocence  I have expressed my sentiments upon this subject very fully to him but he only laughs at what I say except when I mention the certainty of the young lady's brother calling him to account for his ill behaviour This part of the ceremony he says he does not like but has asked me to be his second in case he should be involved in such an adventure  But I have declined the honour for the punctilio should be shewn in avoiding an offence not in defending it  Is it not amazing that a man should premeditately rush on to an action that his heart must condemn even at the hazard of his life Anxious and unhappy as my mind is at present if I had the least acquaintance with the young lady I wou'd do every thing in my power to save her from destruction but he has had honour or rather prudence enough to conceal her name and it is of course impossible for me to interfere further  Once more let me entreat you to exert your utmost influence with Lucy to make her discover Lady Juliana's retreat and I here pawn my honour both to her and you that if after one interview her ladyship should persist in dooming me to  perpetual banishment I will obey the stern decree will instantly quit England and never more obtrude myself into her presence  Surely if Lucy loves her friend she will be satisfied with this proposal  Adieu  C EVELYN  LETTER XIV  WILLIAM STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN  I AM sincerely sorry for your disappointment my dear Charles though more surprized at the effect than cause as I could not possibly suppose that if Lady Juliana seriously meant to fly from you she cou'd think of retiring to so public a place as BathBut I own I flattered myself that the peculiar gaiety of a scene so entirely new to you wou'd have dissipated the chagrin you seem to  feel from her flight or that some new object wou'd have attracted your attention and engaged you in a less tiresome pursuitBut I find you are a brisk huntsman and are determined to pursue the sport though you have missed the quarry  I wou'd by all means advise you to drink the Bath water it is famous for exhilerating the spirits but if that shou'd fail drink wine I entreat youI have known many an unsuccessful passion cured by the bumpers that were filled to the obdurate fairone's health wine is the modern Lethe Charles and as Gay says  Can banish care and cure despair  If I had any better comfort to offer you I shou'd not perhaps so strongly recommend the above recipe but indeed my  friend I must beg to be excused from obeying the request you have so strenuously made to me for I never shall exert my influence over the woman I love to tempt her to an act of dishonour and such I hold a breach of confidence to beAnd were I married to your charming sisterdelightful thought I shou'd esteem her still the more for preserving the secrets of her friends inviolate even from me  Nothing but the romantic passion with which you are infected can excuse your condemning  my  Lucy gladly do I accept the term for not betraying Lady Juliana's confidence and give me leave to say that this passion has rendered your conduct both unjust and absurd towards the object of it  Lady Juliana has acted nobly and shewn herself superior to the meanness and cruelty of coquetry she has even sacrificed her own happiness to yours by depriving herself of the society of her friends to enable you to conquer an hopeless passionBelieve me Charles women speak but too plain when they decline our company and I think it is high time that you shou'd ask yourself what right you have to break in upon her retirement and compel her to receive your visits  Your only plea is that she did not reject the addresses of your brother perhaps it is for that very reason that she declines yoursAllow me to say that Harry was to the full as amiable as you arenow surely it is not impossible that Lady Juliana might have loved your brother and if so can you imagine that  her affections are to descend with the family estate to the next heir  For shame Charles rouse your reason and cease to persecute this charming womanshe has already by all accounts suffered too much the sudden and yet unaccounted for death of her husband brought her almost to the brink of the grave Though every one knew it was impossible she cou'd love him yet her conduct towards him has ever been unimpeached and what must the delicacy of her mind have suffered from living with a man whom she cou'd not avoid detesting  Women have infinitely more merit in such cases than menwe are rarely if ever compelled to marry against our inclinations but if interest too often more powerful than any other attraction  prevails on us to unite ourselves to a disagreeable object we are generally so inhuman as to make her suffer for the crime we have ourselves committed by punishing her with neglect or perhaps a worse species of ill treatmentwhilst the poor girl who has been led an unwilling victim to Hymen's altar can have no safe resource but sighs and tears no indulgence is allowed to any former or future passion she may feel her affections must be restrained by the magical ceremony of marriage within her own bosom because she cannot confer them on a wretch she detests and must not dare to bestow them elsewhere  I am sorry that Williams is a scoundrel such I think any man who lays a scheme to destroy innocence But since knight errantry is exploded and that the young ladies of our siecle are pretty  well enlightened in matters of gallantry we must e'en leave them to take care of themselvesBut as you so justly condemn his conduct I am pleased with your having refused to be his secondthe man who appears in that character is always supposed to approve the cause of his friend's quarrelbesides if you shou'd engage in any such business you well know what you must necessarily suffer from Parson Selwyn's preachments against the damnable sin of duellingThink on this and keep clear of the consequences  Your's sincerely W STANLEY  P S  Your quondam friend Maria Morton has made a runaway match with a young foreigner a Monsieur du Pont whom she has deceived by passing for a  great fortuneIn reality she is worse than a beggar as the little estate that is to come to her after her mother's death is involved for its full value by debts contracted for the indulgence of Maria's extravagance I pity Lady Morton much but the young man more  LETTER XV  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  DEAR Stanley I have received your friendly may I not rather say your chiding letter I acknowledge the unreasonableness of my pursuit but when had reason power to conquer love  Yet in behalf of my own weakness give me leave to say that acting as you think upon wrong principles by endeavouring to obtrude myself into Lady Juliana's  presence I have however shewn much moderation by limiting my pursuit to a single interviewI am not a bas  lisk Stanley the sight of me will not destroy this lovely woman and 'tis necessary I shou'd first know her will before I can obey it  'Tis true my friend she has shewn herself superior to coquetry and has voluntarily exiled herself from those gay scenes in which she ought to shine perhaps to shun my hated sightThen is it not incumbent upon me to restore her to an admiring world to the society of those she lovesO why alas am I not of that happy numberYou will answer me that passion is involuntaryI know it but too well You seem to hint that she once loved my brother is that a reason for her hating me There is no rivalship between us now his passions  are at peace and if he died possessed of her affections he was much happier than your living friend  You are a lover Stanley but a calm because an happy oneLucy repays your tenderness and nought but worldly prudence now impedes your union For this reason you treat my sufferings lightly for even the tenderest simpathy of friendship cannot feel for woes it never has experiencedThere is no Lethe for unhappy love and let me add  en philosophe  that wine enflames but never cures our passionsI shall not therefore my kind physician venture upon your  recipe  but I will save you the trouble of a father prescription by following my own regimen and ceasing to complain  I have met with a tender sympathizing friend and confidante hereI shall be angry if you smile Stanley when I tell you it is Nancy WestonI never saw joy so strongly painted in any countenance as hers when she met me our surprize was mutual but luckily this unexpected interview happened about eight o'clock in the morning and we had no spectators to restrain or comment upon the strong expressions of a grateful heart  She told me before I went to Delville that she was very capable of the millinery business having formerly lived some time with a relation of hers who had kept a shop in TavistockStreet but who was now deadI then told her that if she cou'd find out any method of establishing herself properly in business I wou'd assist her with the  means of carrying it on and left her a few guineas to clothe and support her till my return  During the few hours I spent in London before I came here my mind was so violently agitated that I never once thought of Nancy Weston and the poor girl's modesty wou'd have prevented her from ever applying to me or being farther burthensome as she expresses it had not chance thrown her in my way at this timeShe works with a very creditable chamber milliner who had known her formerly at her cousin's and who will take her into partnership with a few hundreds which she shall have with an hearty welcome into the bargain for I think I need not tell you that her happiness will contribute to mine  That puppy Williams has been witty upon hearing that an handsome milliner's doll as he calls her drank tea with me on Sunday lastHe happened to call upon me that evening and my trusty Scipio refused to admit him tho' he would not make the common excuse of saying I was not at homeHe has teized me ever since with a deal of unmeaning ribaldry and presses me most vehemently to introduce him to my favourite but that I never shall she is much too good and amiable to be the sport of such a libertine  If he may be credited which I much doubt he has been successful in his amourhe no longer conceals the lady's name 'tis Harrison he shewed her to me in the roomsI never saw a more elegant form nor a more lively countenancewhen he saluted her she  smiled and blushedCan it be possible that guilt should assume that first of female charms the joint result of senfibility and modesty  She danced a minuet with Lord March and then took out Captain Williamsshe acquitted herself in both the minuets with infinite grace and easeSurely it is impossible she cou'd be conscious of having forfeited her honour and yet still continue to wear the semblance of chearful innocence  As she did not dance country dances I joined her party and drank tea with herI talked to her a considerable time and tho' I think there is too much levity in her manner I cannot prevail upon myself to believe that she has fallen a sacrifice to such a contemptible trifler as Williams Mrs Peachurn says  How are those mothers to be pitied who have handsome daughters  I say How are those handsome girls to be pitied who have not mothers Miss Harrison has been an orphan from her birth her father was one of those gallant but unfortunate officers who lost their lives with Braddock her mother was then pregnant of this girlshe lived but a few hours after she received the account of her husband's loss and expired in the moment of her daughter's birthThere is something so affecting in the circumstances of both her parents deaths that has inspired me with a kind of additional tenderness towards herI pity and will if not too late preserve her  I have received a letter from my loved Emma by which I can discover that she is unhappySir James Desmond is again involved in difficulties  she has not particularized the circumstances nor given the least hint of expecting any assistance from meDoes she not know I am her brotherassure Mrs Selwyn and your Lucy of my affectionate regard and believe me sincerely yours  C EVELYN  LETTER XVI  WILLIAM STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN  Bravo Bravo Charles I am delighted beyond expression to find you like Hudibras profiting of Ralpho's gifts at the very time you seem to disdain them  Sly as you are I will bet an hundred guineas to five that before you sat down to indite your last epistle you had drank a couple of glasses of Bath water or double that number of Champagne  But no matter for the cause I congratulate you on the effect and will from thence take upon me to pronounce that your lovership is in a fair way of recovery  Three whole pages without the name of Juliana or the word love I shou'd have been amazed indeed at this happy change in your stile if you had not lessened my surprise by mentioning your little tender sympathizing confidanteO Charles there is nothing like true female softness 'tis the very balm of life for when pity flows from beautiful lips who wou'd not receive comfort Gratitude too must have animated her speech glow'd on her cheek and sparkled in her eyes I wou'd have given fifty guineas to have been a witness of your  accidental interview  You are a lucky man to have met with this  charming girl for such I suppose her to be so critically  I think you are too severe upon Williams it was natural enough for him to rally you a little considering the gravity of your character upon  teteatete  with a young woman especially as you make such a mystery of your connection and had refused to introduce him to her acquaintance in which however I think you perfectly right Men of his character look upon all women who are placed in a situation beneath them as lawful prey whereas I consider that part of the softer sex whom fortune has dealt unkindly by whose principles and manners are more elevated than their station as peculiarly entitled to our respect and protection and cou'd more easily forgive myself for a failure in a point of politeness towards  a duchess than to a woman who is unhappy enough to feel her present condition a degradation from her former rank  I don't much like to introduce the subject of your passion for Lady Juliana but believe me if you are as you say sufficiently reasonable to be contented with one interview a little more reason will enable you to be contented without oneI heartily wish that was the case for  my  Lucy is quite unhappy and dissatisfied at being deprived of Lady Juliana's society and now openly declares that you are the sole cause of her exileBe generous Charles and restore her to her friends without conditionstrust to chance for your meeting and to the nobleness of her sentiments when you do  The portrait you have drawn of Miss Harrison is by no means decisive with regard to her present situationGaiety or gravity are in a great measure constitutionalI consider too great an addiction to the first as a misfortune rather than a fault but am far from thinking that liveliness and innocence are incompatibleToo great freedom of speech or manner in a young woman certainly lessens the respect which is otherwise due to her it enfranchises the bounds that are placed between the sexes puts them too much on a level and tempts libertines to hazard improper freedoms which though rejected and resented necessarily sully the purity of female delicacy and leave a stain behindfor as Lady Mary Wortley Montague has justly said  He comes too near who comes to be denied  Williams is certainly a worthless wretch and I heartily wish that Capt Harrison  may treat him as he deserves but I don't see why you should take the work off his hands and thrust yourself into a scrape unless it be merely  pour passer le temps  but if I might advise I shou'd think you had better look out for some better amusement and can hardly seek amiss  Joy to you Charles Mrs Selwyn was yesterday brought to bed of a son I suppose you will be one of its sponsors and must of course appear in  propria persona  Mr Selwyn is you know a formal divine and will not admit of proxiesI was sitting with him when the glad tidings of his son's birth were announced to him he instantly rang his bell and summoned all the servants who were not immediately attending on his lady to prayersI attempted to retire but he insisted upon my joining in thanksgiving  for the birth of a male child which he said was an happy event let the parents be who they wou'd  You have made me as errant a scribbler as yourself and I cou'd go on in this sort of chitchat way for a year together but I have at present a more important though not a more pleasing occupation to pursue My lawsuit draws near a crisis I must pore over musty records and revise briefs in which I shall use the utmost dispatch as my Lucy is then to be my feeAdieu my friend till I can call you  brother  W STANLEY  LETTER XVII  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  MY dear Stanley I have seized upon the first minute's leisure I have been master of to acquaint you with an unlucky affair that has just now happened and which like all other extraordinary events will I suppose be aggravated in the repetition by a thousand falshoods To you then I commit the care of my fame upon this occasion certain that you will exert the noblest quality of friendship  in my favour that of justifying an absent friend  In order to make you thoroughly acquainted with this unfortunate business I must entreat you to read over the inclosed story of Nancy Weston which I wrote out some time ago as I received it from her own recital intending it for your perusal  THE STORY OF MISS WESTON  Her father died when she was about fourteen and left to her and her mother in money and effects about seven hundred pounds Her mother did not survive his loss above a year and when dying recommended her daughter to the care of a relation who kept a milliner's shop in TavistockstreetWith her Nancy Weston lived perfectly happy for two years till she became  acquainted with a young gentleman whom she had often seen a schoolboy at Winchester though she had never spoken to him thereHe endeavoured to persuade her that he had been in love with her from her childhood and used every art to gain her affections and seduce her virtue  In the first he succeeded but too well but she continued proof against every temptation to become his mistressThe only expedient then left to get her into his power was to propose a marriage which he accordingly offered and as they were both under age a journey to Scotland was agreed upon  They set off in the usual runaway mode but her lover had ordered the postilions to travel westward instead  of northward and when they arrived at Birmingham he told her they were then at Berwick upon Tweed and procured a person in the habit of a clergyman to perform the marriage ceremonyThe innocent girl had not the least suspicion of the deceit and returned to London perfectly happy in the firm belief of her being legally married to the man she loved  During their journey both going and coming back he had charged her whenever she was out of his sight to keep a handkerchief close to her mouth and not to utter a syllable to any of the maidservants who attended her This command she had punctually obeyed though the caution was unnecessary for as she had no doubts  she wou'd not have made any enquiries  On their return to town he took lodgings for her in a little street near Marybone and told her that she must be contented to live in the utmost privacy and retirement and by no means to assume his name or reveal herself to her relation in Tavistockstreet as his father was living and wou'd certainly disinherit him if his marriage was discoveredTo these prudent restrictions she readily agreed and spent a year almost in the closest consinement hardly ever stirring out but at a very early hour in the morning or in the dusk of the eveningDuring this period of time she lay in of a daughter which increased her happiness by affording her constant employment in suckling and attending  her and made the tedious hours of her husband's frequent absences pass with less regret away  As soon as they were married he possessed himself of the little fortune that her parents had left her Mrs Weston not having appointed any trustee and the money being placed in the fundsAs his fondness abated his supplied towards her declined and she has frequently had no other subsistence for many days than bread and tea  In this inhuman manner did the monster continue to treat the unhappy girl for near two years till at length upon her venturing gently to remonstrate against his barbarity to his child and her he informed her that she was not any longer to consider herself as his wife and  openly confessed the deceit he had practised against her  The wretched victim became senseless at the shock she received from this discovery in which state he left her and when she had recovered her reason the woman of the house informed her that the gentleman whom she had hitherto called her husband had discharged the lodgings and desired her not to give her any farther credit on his account as he had turned her off and was going abroad for three years  Think my dear Stanley what the wretched Nancy Weston must have suffered at that instant and then tell me if you think there is any punishment too severe to be inflicted upon the fiend who caused her sufferingsThe agonies of her mind drove her almost to despair  and had not her maternal tenderness prevailed over her sorrows she wou'd have terminated them and life together But her child was innocent was helpless and was dear to her and she virtuously resolved to struggle through every misery of life to  arn the means of its support  She immediately stripped herself of every little valuable she possessed in order to discharge her maid and some other trifling debts which she owed in the neighbourhood That done she determined to remove as far from her present situation as possible that she might not be reproached with the slander that her cruel husband had thrown upon her  This left her little to carry with her except her infant which she took in her arms to a twopair of stairs back room that she hired in the Borough and then  making herself as decent as her scanty wardrobe would permit she set out for Tavistockstreet to acquaint her relation with her melancholy circumstances and intreat her to furnish her with work to enable her to subsist herself and her child To compleat her miseries when she arrived at the house she found it oucupied by persons she did not know and was informed that her cousin had been dead above a year before  The elegance of her figure and dejection of her countenance interested the woman of the shop so far that she told her if the people in whose house she lodged or any other person of credit would be bound for her she would take her into the house as an assistant or furnish her with as much work as she cou'd doThe unhappy girl knowing that she had no friend that would be responsible  for her burst into tears thanked her and withdrewThe good woman's heart sympathizing with her distress she recalled her and said for once she would trust to her skill in physiognomy and require no security from her but her face which she believed an honest one then gave her a capuchin to makeAnd my poor Nancy returned home with the pleasing and virtuous prospect of independance thro' the means of honest industry  But misfortune was not inclined to relinquish its victimfor as she returned over Westminster Bridge with hasty steps to succour her child she was encompassed by a mob who had secured a pickpocket and were going to administer the supplemental discipline or common law of ducking to the culprit But as soon as she could get clear  of this riotous assembly she found to her cost that the ministers of justice are not always free from the very vices they correct for one of this selferected tribunal had cut off her pockets in which was every farthing she possessed and what was still a far greater loss the capuchin which the compassionate prepossession of a generous mind had ventured to intrust her with  On discovering her loss the fiend was instantly at her elbow tempting her to wait till the mob should be dispersed and then throw herself into the ThamesAt that moment the cries of an infant struck her ear and instantly awakened all the mother in her almost frantic with grief she turned her back upon the shocking scene and with an agonizing heart reached her wretched home  She recollected that she had a silk gown almost as good as new it originally cost about five guineas and she did not doubt but she should be able to sell it for threeBut there again she was disappointed the harpies in Monmouthstreet wou'd not give her more than one guinea and a half for it which she well knew wou'd not pay for the materials of the capuchin she had lost  At length by stripping herself of almost the whole of her wearing apparel she was enabled to raise the sum of three pounds and went with it directly to her humane employer in Tavistockstreet who listened to her tale with seeming incredulity said she was sorry for her misfortune but if she was subject to such accidents she cou'd not venture to furnish her with any more workShe then received the full price for her silk  and dismissed her giving her half a crown and a vast deal of good advice against evil company and bad ways  I will not dwell longer on the various scenes of wretchedness this poor creature passed through 'till her child fell ill of the smallpox and then all her former woes were swallowed up in her tender apprehension for its little lifeDuring its illness she parted with even the common necessaries of raiment she had left and denied herself food to administer to its sustenance Her fond maternal cares were all in vain Providence was pleased to take her little darling she submitted with resignation to its loss when she reflected on the evils that must necessarily await it  Life was now become a load that she determined to lay down but there  needed no act of violence to hasten her dissolution famine and grief had seized upon her heart and in a few hours she wou'd perhaps have resigned her gentle spirits into His hands who gave it had she been permitted to sigh it out in peace  But the woman in whose house she had lodged for a month was now perfectly convinced of her inability to pay and therefore demanded her rent in the most boisterous terms and threatened to send her immediately to a gaol upon her noncompliance The being a prisoner was the only species of calamity she had not yet experienced her mind was impressed with horror at the idea and whilst her worse than savage landlady went out to seek a constable she stole softly out of the house and fled she knew not whitherProvidence  directed her steps to the Park in that auspicious moment that I met her which I shall always consider as one of the fortunate events of my life Here ends her little historyand now for mine  In my last I told you that I meant to settle this poor friendless creature in partnership with a chamber milliner of good reputeIn consequence of this design Nancy Weston came to me yesterday morning to talk over her little plan of business and adjust all matters relative to itBe it observed that she never had once named the person to whom she had been married nor had I ever asked itdelicacy prevented my making any enquiry when she first told me her story lest my curiosity might be miscontrued into a suspicion of her veracity and my contempt for  a man whom I supposed cou'd never come across me made me decline the renewal of a subject which must give her painThis upon my honour is truth  As I said before she was sitting with me when I heard a bustle upon the stairs between Capt Williams and Scipio the former insisting in a laughing tone that he would come up She started at the sound of the voice but when he threw open the door of the room where we sat she cried out O my husbandand sunk senseless on the ground  Williams gazed upon her with a countenance where rage and contempt seemed equally mingledThen turning to me who was just then raising his unhappy  wise in my arms he said you need not Sir have made a secret to me of your connection with that infamous woman I have long cast her off and it is natural to suppose she has passed thro' many hands before she came into yoursBut beware Mr Evelyn of repeating any forged tale she may tell you of a sham marriage and such stuff for I will not have my character traduced and remember I have put you on your guard  My astonishment had almost deprived me of the power of speech but Williams's insolence quickly restored itI replied Sir this roof which I wish you to quit instantly is your present protection but whenever I speak of you I shall talk of a scoundrel and wherever I meet you I will treat you like one  His wife had by this time thrown herself at his feet from whence he spurned her and rushing into my bedchamber snatched up one of my pistols which lay upon a tableI was lucky enough to seize his arm before he could discharge it but in the struggle between us it went off and wounded himself in the left sideThe report of the pistol alarmed the family and in less than five minutes my apartment was crowded with persons of all ranks and denominations whose curiosity seemed so much more prevalent than their humanity that they neither thought of sending for a surgeon for the wounded person nor of offering any assistance to his wife who lay fainting upon the ground by his side  Scipio upon seeing that I was safe leaped for joy and then ran for Mr Lester  Williams was put into my bed I committed Mrs Williams for so I shall henceforth call her to the care of my landlady and set out in company with Mr Herbert and my quondam friend Sewell who arrived at Bath three days ago to related this accident to the mayor The usual forms were complied with these gentlemen became bail for my appearance as I could not think of asking Mrs Williams to give her testimony upon this occasion to acquit me and her husband has not uttered a single word since he received the wound However Mr Lester says he hopes he shall be able to extract the ball and he will then be in a fair way of recovery If with his health he recovers the right use of his reason and reviews his past life with contrition I shall rejoice in his restoration if not  I shall by no means lament the extinction of such a wretch from society  I have had a message from Miss Harrison desiring to see me The moment I have sealed this I shall attend herI fear it will be an unpleasant interview  I think you will give me credit for being heartily tired of writingI fear you will believe it feelingly  I sincerely wish success to your lawsuit and am with love to all you love ever yours  C EVELYN  LETTER XVIII  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  York  I HAVE seen her Stanley the arbitress of my fate and it is irrecoverably fixed that I am to be unhappySewell informed me that Lady Juliana was certainly at her late husband's seat at HarleyhillI set out on the instant but I have not now time to acquaint  you with the particulars of our interview as I have only snatched up the pen while the horses are putting to my chaise in order to retrace the horrid cross roads that I have travelled from Bath hither  An express is this moment arrived from Sewell to acquaint me that Williams is not likely to recover and expresses the most impatient desire to see meI feel that I shall be sorry for his death  though it comes not near my conscience  I have not been in bed these three nightsWhat shou'd I do there rest has forsaken my pillow I am more in love more distracted and more wretched than any mortal out of the purlieus of Bedlam  Adieu  C EVELYN  LETTER XIX  LADY JULIANA HARLEY TO MISS LUCY EVELYN  Harleyhill  THE so much dreaded interview is over I have seen your unhappy brotherDo not think me inhuman Lucy when I say that I hope never to see him moreIt is my tenderness and not my cruelty that dictates this fervent aspiration  I was just returned from taking the air with Miss Harley who has been here this fortnight and was retired to dress when a chaise drove up to the door and I was informed a gentleman desired to see me As Watson was at that time combing my hair I requested Miss Harley to step into the drawingroom and make my apologies for a few minutesShe returned almost on the instant screaming out it is the ghost of Evelyn  The likeness between your brothers immediately occurred to me at once accounted for her mistake and acquainted me with the name of my visitor I quieted her fears of an apparition and begged her to return to the drawingroomI was seized with an universal tremor and when Watson had hurried on my cloaths I found  myself unable to walk or stand and desired that Mr Evelyn might be shewn into the dressingroom  As he approached me I made a vain effort to rise and I thought we appeared like two criminals who waited a sentence which they dreaded to receiveBefore I cou'd prevent him he threw himself at my feet and entreated my pardon for having broken in on my retirement and said he had great reason to fear that he was the unhappy cause of my secluding myself from the world Ah Lucy have you betrayed me I told him with great sincerity that retirement was by no means disagreeable to me and that it was so long since I had been engaged in the gaiety of London that I feared I should make but an indifferent figure there  He said many civil things in answer which I shall not repeat and proceeded to avow his passion for me in the tenderest terms I wou'd have interrupted him but he implored me to give him a patient hearing declaring that if I persisted in declining his addresses he wou'd immediately quit England his family and friends and never more disturb the happiness he so sincerely wished me I was affected even to tears his looks his manner nay his voice pierced to my heart and recalled the kindred image of one who will ever survive thereI wou'd erase this passage were I writing to any other person breathingBut let it go I scorn disguise with thee  I then told him that I was highly sensible of the honour he did me that I  had not the least doubt of the sincerity of his regard and therefore would not trifle with his passion but candidly inform him that there was a bar an everlasting bar between us which could not be removedBut that if my promising never to enter into those engagements with any other person which I declined with him could make him happy he might depend upon my word provided he wou'd in return give up the thoughts of abandoning his country family and friends on my account but endeavour to conquer his illplaced passion and never speak to me upon the unhappy subject more  He said he had already bound himself to abide by my decision though misery shou'd be his doom but that he wou'd by no means consent  to my becoming a sacrifice to a wretch whom he was sure I detested though compassion for his sufferings might incline me to so generous a proposal and that all he cou'd do in return was with humility to reject the offer and to rid me of his hated presence for that he never cou'd subscribe to a falshood by saying he cou'd see me and cease to love  He turned his head aside to hide the manly drops that filled his eyes wiped them away gazed on me for an instant gave a deep sigh and bowing left me  I cannot describe the situation of my mind at that instant tears luckily came to my relief and when Miss Harley came into my dressingroom I appeared more like a forsaken than  a cruel mistressShe triumphed in my distress and sneering said what are you always to weep for an Evelyn  I shall conclude this tedious letter with entreating that Mrs Selwyn Lady Desmond and you will exert your utmost influence over Mr Evelyn to prevail on him not to quit England Believe me my dear Lucy I am perfectly contented to remain where I am the gay scenes you describe have no charms for me or if they had much rather would I deprive myself of them and even your loved society than rob you of your brotherAdieu my dear my chearful happy friend long may you continue so fervently wishes your affectionate  J HARLEY  LETTER XX  MISS EVELYN TO LADY JULIANA HARLEY  WHY surely since the days of Cassandra and Orondates and such other silly gentlemen and ladies of absurd memory there never was and I hope never will be such a pair of ridiculous noodles as Lady Juliana Harley and Charles Evelyn  Whilst I read your letter my face was like an April sky half cloud half sunshineI could have laughed but that I was vexed and I could have cried but that I was angry  Fye Charles I hate your weeping men yet I don't know why their tears affect one more than those of our own sex But what business have I to reason about such nonsense I am sure it will never be in my power to make Stanley cry though I think I should like mightily to see him pout first and then blubber for he has not a good crying face and I am certain I should laugh at him  And so because your ladyship for what reason I cannot tell does not happen to like my poor unfortunate brother he forsooth must transport  himself into some foreign country and you must remain locked up with that spiteful old Sybil your sisterinlaw in your impenetrable fortress at HarleyhillRidiculous as if there was not room enough for you and Charles Evelyn to dwell in this great city without ever meeting for twenty years endways and I'll warrant you by that time that if you shou'd chance to knock your heads together you will not tremble nor he weep unless the concussion should happen to be violent indeed  Thank you Lady Juliana you are vastly good indeed to confess your passion for my poor dead brother in order to excuse your cruelty to my poor living oneBut I will not accept of such cold confidence  Tell me thou little sly one who is the present possessor of your heart or I shall certainly persuade myself that it has been captivated by some Yorkshire squire that you are ashamed of your choice and therefore make a merit of  Living in shades with him and love alone  I like that idea well enough and I fancy I could be romantic if I would give myself time but I have not leisure  And shew me to the company  must serve my turn  We have had rare doings at our houseA son and heir born to the noble family of the Selwyns  and how do you think we have testi  ied our joy upon this occasion neither by dancing singing or any other act of festivity I assure you but by wearing out our knees and my poor sister's spirits in praying by her bedside twice aday at least  But to abate my spirits upon this joyful event Lady Desmond writes me word that Sir James does not chuse to come to London this winter and she like a gentle turtle as she is prefers the leasless woods of Delville with her Caro Sposo to all the delights of this gay city without himBy the way their house has been aired and ready to receive them this month pastI have a great mind to take possession of it and set up for myselfIf I don't do that I must absolutely marry Stanley that I may be able to a go a  little into the world for I am quite weary of waiting for a  chaperon  Well if I do marry I will shew you all the difference my whole time shall be spent in matronizing young ladies unmarried ones I meanPoor things they are much to be pitied for even a damsel of threescore who has never had an husband must not venture into a public place unless she can persuade some goodnatur'd married girl who might perhaps be her granddaughter to let her tag after her  Poor Charles I will beg of him when I see him not to transport himself but transportation is better than hanging and I think as a despairing lover he is bound in honour to do something of that sort  Once more I intreat you if you have either love or regard for me to leave your musty castle and come amongst us I have a very particular reason for desiring it Stanley has got a verdict in his favour he grows importunate I fear I must yield like all bullies I feel myself a coward and shall never be able to keep up my spirits on the tremendous occasion if you do not lend your assistanceThe very idea has sunk me to the centre I can no more but adieu  LUCY EVELYN  LETTER XXI  WILLIAM STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN  My dear Charles  I HAVE received both your letters and am sincerely concerned for the very disagreeable situation you are in  With regard to Williams's accident you are by no means accountable for itBut had your hand directed the bullets which were lodged in his side after reading Nancy Weston's  story I should not only have acquitted but applauded you for ridding the world of such a monsterBut as I think his blood wou'd stain any hands but those of an executioner I am glad he has done justice on himself particularly as our legislature have not assigned a punishment for crimes like his tho' to the full as fatal in their consequences as any of those for which men suffer death  My indignation and pity were both extremely moved whilst I perused your little novel such wou'd I fain think it for the honour of human natureBut facts are stubborn things and I must tho' unwillingly submit to be ranked of the same species with a villain who cou'd first rob his wife and then leave her and his child to perish  Though I wou'd by no means have advised your pursuing Lady Juliana to her retreat I congratulate you on the conclusion of your romance for surely my friend will now exert himself to conquer a passion which he must own it wou'd be the height of folly to indulge any further  My Lucy  for proudly do I now look up to a possession of that title dearer far than crowns has received a long letter from your cruel fairone as yet she keeps the contents of it secret but as I hope the day is not far off when we shall be but one I may possibly be acquainted with the particulars of your interview without putting you to the pain of relating them and believe me Charles the less you think talk or write upon this subject the betterWe all help  to engrave our misfortunes on our hearts by bearing them constantly in mind and recurring back to them daily as if we were incapable of turning our thoughts to any other subject  The report of Williams's accident has not yet made its way into Clargesstreet and you may assure yourself I shall not be the first to promulgate the intelligence for many and good reasonsHeavens how would Selwyn preach and how terrified would your sisters beThe few persons I have heard mention the affair have been candid enough to suppose that the pistol went off by accident but they all believe that jealousy of a favourite mistress was the occasion of his snatching it up  Fear not my friendship Charles upon this or any other occasion tho' I both hope and believe this is the only one I shall ever have to prove itYou know I allow but two tests of this generous affection the not hearing one's friend abused and the sharing one's purse with himYou must be a spendthrift indeed if you shou'd ever have recourse to mineYet I have some apprehensions of your exhausting your own if you continue to supply Sir James Desmond's necessities which I hear and fear to be very great The  e are no limits to a gamester's wants or a miser's wishes and prudence should restrain us from casting wealth into a bottomless pit  If you did not know my heart to be as generous as your own I would  not venture to speak thus freely but the large drafts you have lately made in favour of Sir James Desmond have alarmed my friendship so far as to make me wish to awaken your discretion  I suppose that Sewell is come to follow his laudable vocation at Bath as there was nothing left for him to prey upon at DelvilleI cannot help it Charles but I detest that man  I give you joy my friend of my success I have obtained a verdict and shall immediately be put into possession of a fortune sussicient to gratify every honest wish of the human heartMay my Lucy add value to its worth by deigning to accept the full enjoyment of it  I impatiently wish to hear of your safe return to Bath  And am most truly yours W STANLEY  LETTER XXII  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  Bath  MY spirits have been kept in so constant an agitation for some time past by the disagreeable scenes I have been engaged in that I know not whether I have recollection sufficient to describe them to youHowever I will strive to methodize my thoughts and  begin by recurring back to my interview with Miss Harrison  I found her pale trembling and in tearsAs I entered the room she cried out O Sir what is become of Captain Williams  In as few words as possible I related to her the cause of the unhappy accident that happened at my lodgings and when I mentioned his marriage with Nancy Weston she fell upon her knees and exclaimedGreat Author of all good accept my thanks and withdraw not thy protecting providence from the being thou hast saved from the complicated misery of adding guilt to the sinner's soul and sorrow to the wretched and innocent suffererThis day Sir I was to have been made his wife by such another  marriage I suppose as was his firstThe chaise now waits within an hundred yards that was to have carried my maid and me to Bristol where he was to have met us with a clergyman a friend of his who as we were both of age would have dispensed with what he called the unnecessary formality of a licence and married us in private  I most sincerely congratulated this amiable girl upon the providential escape she had met with in not being united to Captain Williams even though his intentions towards her might have been strictly honourable if that were possible in his present circumstances and which without want of charity I think I may reasonably doubt  She appeared extremely affected at Mrs Williams's distress said she hoped her husband would recover to do justice to her merit and reward her sufferings but that she never would upon any account see him more for she could not help owning that she had loved him tenderlyShe talked of quitting Bath immediatelyAs a friend I took the liberty of opposing her intention and advised her not only to remain where she was but to appear as little affected as possible at the misfortune that had befallen her worthless loverShe thanked me for my advice and promised to follow it as far as she might be able  The moment I left Miss Harrison I set off in pursuit of my destinyyou know it StanleyFear not that I shall ever attempt to describe the  scene that passed between Lady Juliana and meNo words will ever be able to express my feelings nor no time to erase them from my heartYet let me boast her tenderness and tell you that she wept for your unhappy friendtears do not flow from hatredangels tears are tears of pityWhilst I have life I will cherish the fond remembrance of her gentle sorrowDo not chide me StanleyThe only glimpse I have of happiness is the being certain that she does not hate me  At my return hither I found Williams in a very dangerous state the surgeons had extracted but one of the balls and he wou'd not suffer them to proceed any farther till I was present as he seemed to be persuaded that he should die in the operation  I went immediately to his bedside he was in a high fever but perfectly in his senses and his countenance expressive of the extremest anguishHe took me by the hand and said Can you forgive the anxiety I have cost you and look with compassion on a wretch who is now expiating his crimes by the severest torments  I assured him that I sincerely lamented the accident that had reduced him to such a situation and most truly compassionated his sufferings but that I thought they might be relieved if he wou'd suffer the surgeons to perform the necessary operation of extracting the other ballHe answered Nothey cannot ease my painsthat wretched womanBut I own myself accountable for all her crimes and they sit heavy at my  heartShe was innocent when I met with herand is so still upon my honourI replied her sufferings are all you have to answer for and they indeed have been greatBut were I now even at the point of death I wou'd attest her innocence with my latest wordsI have known all her miseries but by all that is sacred she is free from guilt of any kindHe wept aloudand with difficulty articulatedthen I am still a greater villain  I told him I rejoiced in his contrition as he yet had it in his power in some measure to atone the crimes he had committed by doing justice to his unhappy wifeHe remained silent for some time then groaned most heavilyand saidlet me see herbut can she bear the sight of  him who would have murdered her I caught the pistol up with an intent to kill herBut Providence directed the wound to my own guilty heartBut all my crimes will be atoned by deathfor never shall this bullet leave my sideI do not wish to live life wou'd be hateful to meMiss Harrison I have injured her toobelieve me she is a virtuous woman Evelyn  I replied I do believe it most sincerelyBut do not wander from your present purposeYour mind will be much easier when you have seen your wife He gazed upon me with a piercing look and said you are a man of honour and cou'd not be so base as to deceive a dying man You say my wife is guiltless free from stainThen let her come and  pardon her cruel husbandI repeated every solemn assurance that I could give him of her blameless conduct with which he seemed perfectly satisfied and I went to bring her to his bedside  I found her in the diningroom from whence she had scarcely stirred from the time I left her In her situation it was impossible her mind cou'd feel repose or her body rest She appeared to me even a more melancholy object than when I met her in the Park her eyes were swoln with tears and her face pale and emaciated When I told her that her husband desired to see her she said it was impossible she dared not cou'd not look upon the man she had murdered nor cou'd she ever more know peace or comfort  With much difficulty I reasoned down her groundless apprehensions of having caused his death and led or rather supported her trembling feeble frame to his bedside she dropped upon her knees and I retired quick from a scene that was by much too interesting for my present state of mind  In about an hour's time he sent for me he appeared much more composed than when I left him but still in extreme agonyHe begged I would consult his surgeon and let him know his real state for he had much to do and he believed but a very short space to get it doneHe promised to submit to any operation that shou'd be thought necessary to save his life and thanked me a thousand  times for the gleam of peace which I had given to his torn mind  I immediately summoned a consullation of all the physical people of eminence at Bath but they wou'd not venture to pronounce with any degree of certainty till a further experiment had been made to come at the ball  I acquainted him with their opinions and begged of him to let the trial be instantly made but he peremptorily refused to submit to it till twelve o'clock tomorrow as he said he had still more important affairs to execute than that He desired a proper person might be sent for to draw his will and entreated me to obtain a licence and get a clergyman to marry  him in due form at nine o'clock tomorrow morning to his present nominal wife He also most earnestly requested me to wait upon Miss Harrison and implore her forgiveness of an unhappy dying man who never cou'd forgive himself  Need I tell you that I have been strongly affected with Williams's contrition I most sincerely pray that he may live to enjoy the fruits of his repentance and by his future conduct obliterate his pastI have obeyed all his commands and am at present so compleatly harrassed both in mind and body that I must decline entering into the particulars of your letter till another opportunity  I shall be present at Williams's marriage and at the dressing of his  wounds tomorrow but I much fear that I shall see him in his wedding and his winding sheet at once  Adieu  C EVELYN  LETTER XXIII  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  IT is all over with poor Williams A mortification had begun some hours before the time that his surgeons were appointedHe was sensible of his situation by the perfect ease he enjoyed and intreated their humanity not to torture him in vain He bore the certainty of his approaching dissolution with the utmost calmness and  spent the few hours that were allotted him in imploring the forgiveness of heaven and his injured wifeHe has bequeathed four hundred pounds a year to Mrs Williams for now she is entitled to that name according to all the forms of lawHe has left an hundred guineas to be laid out in a ring for Miss Harrison on which is to be enamelled the word  Beware  and has appointed me his residuary legatee  I staid by him the whole day and night and about four o'clock this morning he expiredI will not pain you or myself with a description of his melancholy exitI do not think his widow will survive him longTho' he has acquitted me in the fullest and handsomest manner of his death I am advised  to take my trial at the ensuing assizes as the lawyers here inform me that if I avoid doing so I shall always be liable to a prosecution which may at some time or other be commenced against me from maliceI must desire you will consult the ablest lawyers in London upon this occasion and let me have their opinionsMy mind is oppressed with an uncommon gloomdeath is a tremendous subject of contemplation when we view it nearseen in perspective only we cast a transient glance and turn our eyes awayPerhaps it would disrobe the spectre of his terrors were we to look more frequently and steadily upon it  But these reflections are out of season to a joyful heart long may it be before one pang of sorrow shall find  entrance there May Lucy soon increase your happiness by sharing it and may it remain as uninterrupted as the sincere friendship of  C EVELYN  LETTER XXIV  LADY DESMOND TO CHARLES EVELYN  MY dearest Charles I have read in some  good  author that generosity and gratitude are twins who have never been separated but always subsist in the same heartIn yours then my brother you will find the sentiments of mine sentiments which can only be felt but never expressed or  if they could the sensation would still remain as unintelligible to the bulk of humankind as the idea of a sixth sense  You will perhaps be suprized when I tell you that I have shed more tears this last week than I have for many months before  But joy has its tears as well as grief  And mine were tears of joy  There would be no enduring the transport of conferring happiness on those we love without that kind reliefSurely my brother you must have wept yourself when you made Emma happy  I think myself much obliged to Mr Sewell for the dispatch he made  from Bath to Delville with your bills Every thing here now wears a chearful aspect and I fancy as I look upon the lawn that it has acquired a brighter verdure than it used to wear even in the springBut though this idea may be imaginary I am certain that my beloved Sir James has cast away the gloom that hung upon his brow and the soft smiles of sweet content now reign triumphant there I think he was even more oppressed with gratitude than me when I delivered your generous gift into his handsHe is gone to London to fulfil the purpose for which it was designed  We shall now have no more creditors for sure I am that he will never more involve himself by playTho' at this time I could not bring myself  to hint even the most distant desire he should relinquish it but well he knows how ardently I wish he should and as he loves me with the utmost tenderness I cannot doubt his giving me this proof of his affection  Mr Sewell is gone with Sir James to London and I am to follow in a fortnightSir James thinks our house cannot be sufficiently aired in less time and would not have me or our dear little Fanny run the hazard of catching coldI have a thousand apprehensions about his health and earnestly wish that he could have been content to pass the winter here as we had intended  Mr Sewell has informed me that you had paid a visit to Lady Juliana Harley he could not tell me what  was the result though I guess it but too well from his saying that you appeared dejected at your returnWhy will you court unhappiness by pursuing perhaps the only woman within your sphere of life that would fly from you Blest as you are with virtue health and fortune why must you add to the too numerous proofs that happiness is not attainable on earth  Forgive me Charles this little opposition to your only irrational pursuitFew are the persons even amongst the best within whose reach felicity seems placed all must deserve before they can obtain it but even then we sometimes cast it from us and like Ixion grasp a cloudMay you reverse the fable and long enjoy what you so well deserve My little Fanny's playful fondness will  not suffer me longer to indulge in expressing the ardent wishes of my heart for my loved friend and brother but from that source they shall for ever flow to the Great Fountain of all good to bless protect and guide you  Your grateful E DESMOND  LETTER XXV  CHARLES EVELYN TO LADY DESMOND  I SINCERELY wish that my dear Emma's nerves were a little stronger for though I confess myself extremely pleased with the tenderness of your letter I for your sake lament the sensibility which dictated itThis is not a world for delicate minds to be happy in  Nor peace nor ease that heart can know  That like the needle true  Turns at the touch of joy or woe  But turning trembles too  There never was a sentiment more elegantly expressedI would rather have been the author of that single stanza than of a dozen volumes of poetry nay and of good poetry too But why my Emma will you distress me by talking of gratitude Of what value is wealth if it does not enable us to purchase happiness and to diffuse is to enjoy it the greatest miser upon earth cannot confine his possessions solely to himself nor can the most luxurious man that lives appropriate to his own use the tithe of what he dissipatesHe who bestows preserves his property a gift once made cannot be lessened it is a fund established in  a grateful heart which even the great destroyer Time cannot impair  But holding riches lightly as I do I would not wish that mine should flit away on the gross pinions of  Folly  or of  Vice  I therefore intreat you to exert all the influence you have over your beloved Sir James to prevail on him to conquer a passion that must come under one or other of  those  denominationsYou must know that I mean his love of play  Yet I approve of your delicacy in not mentioning the subject at a time when it might have appeared like making conditions for what he thought a favour and indeed I should be better pleased if he were voluntarily to renounce gaming than if he sacrificed  his inclination even to your request  One of those harpies whom I saw at Delville a Mr Simpson has I hear lost large sums of money hereI am glad Sir James is not near enough to assist in repairing his lossesI think Mr Sewell a worthy and I may add a sensible man as he has had prudence enough to relinquish gamingHe professes the sincerest regard for both you and your husbandHowever I think I have a little reason to chide that he shou'd inform me of Sir James's difficultiesWas he more worthy of my Emma's confidence than I  I am very glad to hear you are going to London dissipation contrary to its usual effects will be of infinite  service to you The generality of public entertainments which are frequented by persons of rank are calculated entirely to amuse the senses the heart has nothing to do with them and of course insensibly retires within itself its feelings lie dormant its sensibility becomes obtuse and I am apt to think that persons who live in a constant circle of dissipation do not know that they have an heartBut as I am by no means apprehensive that you are likely to forget that part of your anatomy I shall be glad the little flutterer shou'd repose for a time in the  apathy  of what is so falsely stiled pleasure  I hope you will be time enough in town to be present at our dear Lucy's weddingI wish you cou'd contrive to call upon me in your journey it  will not be much out of your road and if we do not meet here it may be very long before we do  I thank you for the tender concern you express for me on account of my unhappy passion it is the only subject on which I would not listen to my Emma's adviceBut remember my sister"They never knew to love that knew to change" and be assured that no other woman can ever make the slightest impression upon the heart of your sincerely affectionate brother  C EVELYN  LETTER XXVI  GEORGE SEWELL TO JOHN SIMPSON  WHAT the devil could prevent you Jack from meeting us at Salisbury Do you know that the baronet has been very near slipping through our hands and that at the very time when he is best worth our holding Why man we have found a mine the treasures of the East lie before us  Evelyn's whole fortune may be ours Lady Desmond has got a key to his purse out of which she will certainly fill her husband's and we the galant knights of industry will as surely empty it  But to explain this mystery We were all in a doleful way when you like a false friend left us at Delville Not a shilling to be raised not a stake left unmortgaged but my lady's jointure and the baronet swore he would perish rather than rob his wife The intended journey to London was entirely laid aside and they were to pass the winter  solus cum sola  He grew grave and peevish she retained her usual gentle chearfulness upon my soul Jack she is a very amiable woman and I am really glad we did not meddle with the jointure particularly  as we can now do very well without it  It was impossible for me to think of remaining in such a dull scene where I knew there was nothing to be got so I made a few wry faces at table talked of a flying gout and set out to drink the Bath water which like the Irish usquebaugh has always a little gold floating in it which may be easily extracted by such ingenious chymists as you and I  To my great joy one of the first persons I met with there was the prudent and sensible Mr Charles EvelynI had you know ingratiated myself into his good opinion at Delville by advising Sir James Desmond against play and I resolved to strengthen his prepossession by declaring that I had  entirely left it off myselfThat was a stroke beyond you SimpsonI was fortunate enough to be able to acquaint him with the place of his Dulcinea's retreat which he considered as a real obligationThere has not been such a Quixote in England these fifty yearsBefore he set out on his wildgoose chase I took occasion to mention the distressed situation of the Desmond family but under the seal of secrecy as I told him I knew the baronet's pride would never suffer him to reveal the consequences of that misconduct he now so sincerely repented ofI talked in raptures of Lady Desmond's virtues and swore that Sir James and she would be the happiest couple on earth if their circumstances were tolerably easyThe gudgeon bit and immediately asked me what sum I thought would relieve  Sir James from his present difficulties I hesitated to pronounce but upon being pressed said I imagined four or five thousand pounds would discharge all his impatient creditors though I well knew that thrice that sum would not extricate him  The idiot Evelyn whom I suppose to be as rich as the Great Mogul sat down directly and drew drafts for six thousand pounds in favour of Sir James Desmond and as soon as they returned accepted consigned them to my  friendly  care to be delivered into the hands of his fair sisterAnd am I not a friend indeed for I don't expect above half this sum to roll into your pocket or mine  Both Sir James and Lady Desmond were strongly affected at this proof of  Evelyn's generosity and the former was very near making a vow never to play againI trembled lest his wife should have strengthened his wavering resolution by making it her request but if she had I would have laid five to three against any promise that Sir James could make for a man may as easily be cured of the hydrophobia as of an itch for gamingAll I feared was that he might get into other hands and therefore wrote to you to meet and accompany us to London for to be sure if he was not an egregious gull he must be surprized at our  constant  good luck  I contrived as I wrote you word that we should lye at SalisburyAfter supper the baronet seemed pensive I pushed about the bottle and expected he would call for cards but he yawned  and talked of going to bedOn which I stept out of the room and returned in a moment with a box and dice and proposed taking a cast or two merely to amuse the time for silverHe could not resist the dear temptation and that jilt fortune and my own negligence in not having a die in my pocket turned against me and I lost an hundred guineasBut  tant mieux  say I 'tis a good bait and will catch thousandsThe baronet exulted violently as all those fellows do that are not used to winI congratulated him on the change of his luck said Fortune was certainly weary of persecuting him and that it was highly probable he would now recover all his former lossesHe smiled at the idea and went to bed in high spirits  We did not get to town till late last night and then parted this day he dines with his brotherinlaw Selwyn and has desired me to meet him in the evening at his own houseI have accepted the invitation and shall go properly prepared In my next I hope to give you a good account of him or his money which is a much better thingI am sorry you are not here we must strike while the iron is hot and rescue his dear guineas from falling into the hands of "odious vulgar tradesmen" as Lady Townley says  I hope you are successful at Bath though there is danger there of meeting with your match and give me leave to say you are not qualified for such an encounteryou lose your  temper with your money and know not how to retire with the easy gentlemanlike  sans froid  of yours  G SEWELL  LETTER XXVII  LADY JULIANA HARLEY TO MISS EVELYN  Yes my Lucy I will hasten to your relief or rather to my ownMiss Harley's ill temper has rendered this place so hateful to me that I can no longer abide in't  Surely there is a fatality that attends the meeting of an Evelyn and an HarleyFrom the moment that your brother left this house she has  treated me with the utmost asperityShe says she is certain that the whole race of Evelyns are idiots or that I must have given them philtresBut it is they not me who have the art of fascination for this poor lady is become enamoured by a single glance of your brotherPerhaps the sudden fright she received from the strong resemblance between him and the lamented Henry has occasioned this extraordinary prepossessionthough love is by no means the offspring of fearBut no matter for the cause the effects have been dreadful to me and I am resolved to withdraw myself from them as quickly as possible  Heaven knows that this poor sinking heart of mine needs not to have its sorrows aggravated'Tis true my Lucy that your brother and I are  not under an absolute necessity of meeting yet surely unless he or I relinquish the enjoyment of your society we cannot well avoid itJustice and reason ordain that I should make the sacrifice and what a desart will London be to me deprived of your sweet converse  On the approaching I hope happy event of your changing your name  O name for ever sad for ever dear  I beg if Mr Evelyn should be in London that his presence may be considered as more essential on that occasion than mineMy Lucy does but jest when she talks of terrors at giving her hand where she has long since bestowed her heartThough I will allow that even thus happily circumstanced there is something  extremely awful in the marriage contract to a sensible and delicate mind I have often wondered where those very young ladies who elope from their families and friends have found resolution sufficient to support themselves thro' that solemn ceremony But think what she endures who is compelled to make a "joyless loveless vow"  I purpose being in London by this day fortnight but let me conjure you not to delay Mr Stanley's happiness upon my account your sister Selwyn whom I sincerely congratulate will support your spirits and to say truth my Lucy I wou'd rather be excused from being present at a ceremony where love hope and joy shou'd fill each chearful heartThese charming sensations have alas been  long banished from mine and the only pleasing one which now inhabits there is the affectionate regard with which  I am most truly yours J HARLEY  LETTER XXVIII  MISS EVELYN TO LADY JULIANA HARLEY  THANK you my good Miss Harley with all my heart for having been able to effect by the pure dint of a diabolical disposition what all the earnest entreaties of Lady Juliana's  favourite friend  had solicited in vain Old adages have always been highly esteemed by me for I firmly believe our ancestors were wiser than  the present generation and the  needs must  I shall henceforth look upon as an oracular truthI ask ten thousand pardons thou departed spirit of Chesterfield for having ventured to quote an old proverb against your injunction  I am delighted at the idea of Miss Harley's falling in love by a  coup d'oeil  and shall certainly congratulate Charles on his conquest Dry wood is more apt to take fire than when 'tis green we all know but why the deuce came Miss  Touchwood  to make such a smoke and potherI never knew but one person besides Miss Harley whose temper was not softened by love she poor dear was a middleaged Lady also and the fonder she grew of her lover the more spiteful she became to  all the rest of the worldBut various are the effects of the same disease upon the human body and as various are the effects of the selfsame passion upon the human mindI think that last a good pretty philosophical sort of a sentence'Tis poetical at least  And so my dear Lady you are pleased to say that I do but jest when I talk of terrors in regard to a certain event and in the very next line you kindly allow that there is something very awful in a marriage contract to a sensible and delicate mind  Thank you my sweet friend for this obliging inuendobut I am not in a humour to quarrel and the only revenge I desire to take for this sly hint is to insist upon your being present at my  nuptials  I think that sounds better than  wedding  and conveys a  more dignified idea of the solemn ceremony To be seriousfor I am not merry though  I do beguile the thing I am  With seeming otherwise  I feel that there is something very tremendous in uniting our fate with that of a person whose temper and sentiments it is impossible we should be thoroughly acquainted with and becoming as it were dependent upon another for our temporal and eternal happinessFor I agree with Dr Tillotson "That an unhappy marriage is a lesser Hell in passage to the greater"  I tremble whilst I write this sentenceyet wherefore shou'd I be so much alarmed Stanley is generous and humane and shou'd he even  cease to love meshocking thought I will not dwell upon the gloomy subjectNow for the other end of the perspectiveWe have got the prettiest house imaginable very near Berkeleysquare not far from my sister Selwyn's and in the same street with EmmaApropos Sir James Desmond is come to town and her ladyship is expected in a few days he seems in high spirits which I rejoice at because I know my sister's gentle nerves are always in strict unison with hisI should be glad to know if she is very happyIf she is not Lord have mercy upon me for I never shall make half so good a wife and yet I assure you I am resolved to be as good as I possibly can  I did not intend to write above six lines when I took up the pen and they were meant to tell you  That I vow and declare  And still more I swear  That while in the country you tarry  I may laugh jest or sing  Or do any odd thing  But depend on it I will not marry  There's an extempore for youWe have a great deal of company to dine and I must dress  Your ladyship's most humble LUCY EVELYN  LETTER XXIX  WILLIAM STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN  I BY no means wonder at the oppression of spirits you seemed to labour under when you last wrote to meSuch a succession of melanchcly scenes wou'd unstring the nerves of an HerculesI know not how to say I am sorry for Williams and yet I feel something like concern for his death mixed with a fear that if he had  lived he wou'd have relapsed into his former errors To conquer habitual vice is a more than Herculean labour it requires strength of mind and preseverance qualities which are seldom to be met with in a vicious personfor all kinds of baseness enervates the soul and render it averse from pain or difficultyBut peace be with his ashes and may his widow live to enjoy content if not felicity  I have consulted some of our ablest lawyers and they agree in desiring you should take your trial at the ensuing assizes but I hope neither this or any other business will prevent your being a witness and partaker of my happiness in receiving the completion of my every wish from my dear Lucy's hand  The long desired day is at length fixed for the eighteenth of next monthBy that time Lady Desmond and Lady Juliana Harley will both be in London and my Lucy says will both be present at what she calls the awful ceremony  After this hint I think I need not press your coming but let me intreat you my dear Charles upon this occasion to cast off your glooms and sables  For if looking well wo'nt move her  Looking ill will ne'er prevail  It is a general remark that grave ladies like sprightly menContrasts oftener create affection than similarityin manners only I meanfor there must be a sympathy of sentiment to form a perfect love  Her taste  was his own  is one of the very best reasons for a real attachment that I know of  I write in haste for I resent the loss of every moment which I do not enjoy in my Lucy's companyMy carriage waits to convey me to Clargesstreet you will therefore I hope forgive this abrupt adieu  W STANLEY  LETTER XXX  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  Bath  NO Stanley no my friend I will not damp your joys nor gloom nor sorrow shall obtrude on your festivityI never shall put on a wedding garment and therefore will not be a guest at yoursYet shall my heart most truly sympathize  in my friend's happiness nor can his own form any wish more ardent that it may be lasting  Lucy has many good and amiable qualities and will I am convinced exert them all to insure the happiness of the man she lovesI don't know any young woman better qualified to make a good wife she has an excellent temper and constant spirits and I am persuaded that chearsulness is a very necessary ingredient in matrimonyThe languid and dejected part of her sex seem to claim a constant exertion of their husband's tenderness they appear to be incapable of bearing their part in the difficulties or distresses of life and of course throw the whole load upon the menBut tho' 'tis natural to love the being we protect 'tis as reasonable to expect that  the companion of our journey through life should at least endeavour to enliven the dreary part of the road and make it seem less tiresomeYou know the adage  Jucunda comes in viâ pro vehiculo est  Such a one I hope you will find in my sister and may your journey be long but not tedious  Believe me my friend I am sincerely rejoiced at hearing that Lady Juliana means to return to the world and her friends againMay every happiness the world can give be hersand never never shall I interrupt itHow could you think that I would break my promise and sink myself in her esteem I scarce can pardon the idea  My gentle Emma too will grace your weddingtoo surely may I say my heart will be amongst yeThe rest of me the mere animal body will remain here till after the assizes and when they are over I shall accompany Miss Harrison and her brother to IrelandHe is a very sensible elegant man and thinks himself obliged to me for the attention I have shewn to his sister  Poor Mrs Williams continues in a very weak and languid state of health fortune cannot repair the wrongs it has already done her her physicians have hopes of her recovery from drinking the Bristol waters next summer but I can scarcely form a hope that she will remain amongst us long enough to try their efficacy  Present my sincerest congratulations to your fair bride though I shall write to her and my sister Selwyn by next post  These letters do not appear  Farewell my Stanley and be assured that even the name of brother cannot add to the unfeigned regard with which  I am unalterably yours C EVELYN  LETTER XXXI  MISS LUCY EVELYN TO CHARLES EVELYN  ClargesStreet  My dear Charles  I WILL not say with Beatrice  Against my will I am sent to bid you come to dinner  For with my whole heart that is with all that I have left of it do I intreat your company on the eighteenth instSurely  my good my generous brother will not deny to grant the only request that I have ever made to him  Should you refuse even your princely present would lose its lustre in my eyes or at least your unkindness will diminish its brilliancy for indeed I have set my heart upon your coming and one should not be crossed upon one's weddingdayLet the honeymoon at least shine unclouded to its wainSuppose Lady Juliana should be there she is no gorgonShe has the beauty indeed of the Medusa head but without its terrorsFor my life I can't find out why you and she are so horridly afraid of each otherI am certain that if you never meet you will never come together and I think that is an event that might probably  enough be brought about if you did not take so much pains to avoid itNeither women nor men I fancy should be understood  au piè du lettre  upon the article of loveboth sides generally say more than they literally meanFor my part I know have told Mr Stanley twenty times that I should never marry and heartily sorry should I now be if he had been such a dunce as to have taken me at my word  For shame then Charles take courage and don't give out on a first denial  All women should be woo'd  And not unsought be won  But let this matter be settled between you and your fair relict as you please  it has nothing to do with my request with which I again intreat your compliance and am most affectionately  Yours L EVELYN  P S  Castlefranc has executed your commission in a most elegant tasteThank you my sweet brother for the handsomest pair of earrings I ever sawI mean to surprize Mr Stanley with them and will never forgive you if you are not present to enjoy his astonishment and hear Mr Selwyn's remarks on the folly and vanity of such fopperies  The answer to this letter being to the same purport as the letter XXIX does not appearThere are also many other letters relative to Mr Stanley's wedding omitted  LETTER XXXII  LADY DESMOND TO CHARLES EVELYN  Charlesstreet Berkeleysquare  NOT all the gay and pleasing scenes in which I have been engaged since my arrival here have been able to efface the tender melancholy I felt at bidding you adieuThough we parted at the Devizes you accompanied me all the way to London not  even my little Fanny's chearful prattle and innocent curiosity could rouse me sufficiently from my reverie to make me answer her questions rationallyMy mind was totally occupied on the peculiar unhappiness of yours in not being able to conquer a passion which you acknowledge to be hopeless  My anxiety for you has rendered me unjust I could not receive Lady Juliana with the cordiality and affection I used to feel for her nor cast my eyes upon her elegant form without wishing to lessen her charmsNo woman ever took more pains to depreciate a rival's beauties to a wavering lover than I have done to find some fault with her'sBut it is in vainI cannot discover a single imperfection except her being the cause  though an innocent one of your unhappinessI think she is thinner than she was when you saw her at Delville and is almost as much spiritualized though without the appearance of ill health as your fair idea Mrs Williams for whose recovery I am much interested and intreat you to present my best wishes to her  Lady Juliana endeavoured to appear chearful at my sister's wedding but every one might see  she strove  to be soWhat cause can be assigned for such a depression of spirits in one who is surrounded with all the outward signs of happinessShe cannot surely love in vainI know not what to think of herBut this is the last time that even your intreaties shall prevail on me to mention her again  I have been involved in a continued circle or rather whirl of public and private amusements ever since I came to town yet I feel I have an heart and that it grieves for youI look back with pleasure on the three days I spent with you at Bath though there is a good deal of regret mingled with the recollection at not having had it in my power to persuade you to come up to London  Mr and Mrs Stanley are as happy as it is possible to be and with true joy I say they have a prospect of continuing so if happiness were a  perennial  flowerBut alas few are the soils in which it always bloomsIn most that I have seen 'tis but an  annual  nay sometimes blasted e'er it can take root'Tis a celestial plant  and was not meant to flourish here below  Do not from hence conclude I am unhappy if I were I should deserve to be so for I should be ungrateful to Providence and to youNo let my thankful heart acknowledge its felicity by saying that my beloved Sir James and Fanny both are well and that I am to the best of brothers an affectionate sister  E DESMOND  LETTER XXXIII  GEORGE SEWELL TO JOHN SIMPSON  DEVILISH bad indeed Jack what routed horse and foot Stephens undone as well as youNo hopes of repairing the damage but by my successLet me tell you gentlemen this will never doYou are mistaken if you fancy I have touched all the Baronet's cashNo more than a paltry  seven hundred has come to my shareI was obliged to take in a partner as Sir James objected to playing with me  têteatête  for large sumsNot from any suspicion but as I was his friend he did not chuse to win my money Scrupulous idiot he need not have feared hurting meA gamester like an historian should have neither country religion or friendsThere must be no boggling I called in Kelly and passed him for a rich West IndianWe divided fourteen hundred for as Kelly is not of our set he insisted on  the ready  He is an errant Jew and it grieved me to go snacks with such a niggardly rascal  However it was lucky that I struck the iron while 'twas hot for since my lady's arrival in town the Baronet has not touched a dieThere has been a wedding in the family and a  deal of dining and supping togetherThe new brotherinlaw Mr Stanley is I fancy a devilish keen oneI was in hopes to have touched him for a little of his wife's fortune but upon Sir James proposing play a few nights ago at his own house this same wiseacre talked of gaming and gamesters in such a stile as made me almost blush and wish myself fairly out of the companyI perceive there is nothing to be got by him  Though Lady Desmond appears the gentlest of beings I begin to fancy that her husband is a little in awe of her from his not venturing to play since she came to townIf this shou'd be the case I will take care that her reign shall be short by throwing out hints of his apparent subjection at which I am sure the  Baronet's pride will revolt and then let her ladyship look to her jointureIf I can cure his qualms about it I shall have none of my own hencesorward  There is a good clever woman in their set that I think has spirit enough for any thing a Madam du Pont she loves play and seems to understand it but I fancy she is poor Suppose we were to admit her of our society women are the best decoyducks in the worldI don't fancy she would have many scruples for I have heard that she is an infamous daughter to an indulgent mother whose circumstances she has ruined  I have some doubts about Monsieur her husband he seems to be a man of honour but if he is fond of her he will easily be converted into  What I do not like to answer the question  It is devilish hard lads that we must be confined to this piddling workIf they had not  black balled  us at the great clubs we might have rolled in our chariots long since not but that there are many of our fraternity amongst them and some not half such honest fellows as ourselves  I enclose you bills for five hundred to make a push withI desire Jack that you will be cautious how you play with foreigners they generally know as much of the matter as we do The East and West Indians are our best marksFull purses and honest hearts the true  ferae naturâ  for gentlemen gamesters  I have just received a message from Sir James Lady Desmond goes to a ball he has strained his ancle and desires to see meIt is not impossible that I may make him dance without a fiddle before the night is over Luck attend us all adieu  GEORGE SEWELL  LETTER XXXIV  CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY  Bath  MY trial is over and I stand acquitted by the laws of the land as well as my own conscienceThe process was very short Williams had taken every possible precaution to secure both my life and honourPoor fellow I wish he had taken as much pains to preserve his own  The formalities of a court of judicature even to a mind conscious of its innocence and certain of acquital have something very awful in themI am amazed how any person who stands self convicted is able to support himself on such a tremendous occasion Shakespear says  I've heard  That guilty creatures sitting at a play  Have by the very cunning of the scene  Been struck so to the soul that presently  They have proclaimed their malefactions  I should think such an effect much more likely to be produced by putting a culprit on his trial at least I am sure I should plead guilty if I was conscious of being soBut we are not judges of situations that we have not experienced and perhaps if I was capable of committing murder  I might be mean enough to deny my guilt for the poor privilege of carrying upanddown a wretched restless being  But away with these Tyburn topicks and let me talk to you of love and joyTo you I trust they are terms synonimous to me they never can or will be so But tell me Stanley how does your lively bride become that characterhas she assumed an air of dignity and put the matron on even with the wedding ring as I have seen young ladies do e're nowor is she still the same unaffected pleasant Lucy not changed in any thing but nameHow go the Selwyns and the Desmonds onAnd answer me this once has Lady Juliana ever mentioned me  There is a fister in law of her's here at present a Miss Hartley she did me the honour to address me in the rooms from having seen me for a moment at Harley Hill I had not the least recollection of herHow should II saw her not nor shou'd have seen the Grecian Venus had she stood before meI had no eyes but for one single object But I will not indulge myself with dwelling on the dear painful subject  Miss Harley has been particularly civil to the Harrisons and me I almost fancy she likes the Captain and 'tis a very probable conjecture for he is extremely agreeable both in his person and manners yet I shall be sorry if it is so for I would not have any one who bears the name of Harley wretched and I am pretty sure  that his affections are already bestowed upon Mrs Williams but I fear he will not be successful there as he has a potent rival in the grim king of terrors who lurks in ambush even beneath her smiles  I purpose setting out for Ireland in about ten days if my sisters have any commissions to execute I beg they will employ me as I am to them and you a sincerely affectionate brother  C EVELYN  LETTER XXXV  MRS STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN  Charlesstreet Berkeleysquare  I HAVE snatched the pen from my  husband  how oddly  that word  looks because I am resolved to answer for myself as I have heard it remarked that one shou'd never rely upon what a man says of his  wife  There's another queer wordand because  I have a secret to tell you that I don't chuse to trust Mr Stanley withYou see that I am already  au fait  of the mysteries of matrimony and  understand my place  Now to your queriesI have not assumed any matronly airs as yet merely because I don't think they would become meBesides the man likes me as I am at present but the moment I perceive the least alteration in his manners towards me I'll turn the tables upon him study the Graces become at once a very dignified fine lady scorn to laugh at any thing however ridiculous and be as dull and as formal as any Donna Elvira at the Court of MadridIf variety has charms such a contrast surely must delight him  Now for my secretHush let me whisper in your earIt is not Captain Harrison but Charles Evelyn that has captivated the tender heart of the young and beautiful Miss HarleyLady Juliana assures me that her sisterinlaw is very little turned of thirty but were I to judge I think we might add ten to the score and bring her almost on the road to fiftyBut were she fifteen I shou'd not like her but that is no reason for your dislike and now that I am married and settled as it were I wou'd fain have you in the same predicamentYet I wish you to look somewhere else for a wife as I am persuaded there never will be a match between a Harley and an Evelyn  They say the Irish ladies are remarkably handsome who knows but  some fair bogtrotter may lay hold of your heart and transmogrify you into a brogueneerYou ask me for commissions bring me over a sisterinlaw and I won't trouble you for any else but if you return single I desire you to bring me a great quantity of Irish stuff and every other kind of countraband commodity you can contrive to smuggle that is the manufacture of that country  I know you won't think my letter worth the postage if I don't say something of Lady JulianaSeriously Charles she gives me great uneasiness both her health and spirits decline visibly and I am certain there is a cruel something that preys upon her heartShe laments her being the cause of your absenting yourself from your family yet highly approves  your shunning herShe sometimes talks of going abroad but I don't believe she will ever have resolution enough to travel for even I cannot prevail on her to stir from her own firesideIn short she is a riddle too difficult for me to expound  The Selwyns and Desmonds all salute you as does my sposo and your affectionate sister  LUCY STANLEY  P S Madame Du Pont whom you will possibly know better by the name of Maria Morton desires her compliments to youShe is a great deal with us at present as my brother and sister Desmond seem to have taken a particular liking for herI think she is more agreeable as Madam du Pont  than she was as Miss MortonBut I hear shocking stories of her behaviour to her motherIf they are true I shall renounce herfor to me not all the charms of wit and beauty can compensate for a bad heartPray write from Ireland and tell me all about it  LETTER XXXVI  GEORGE SEWELL TO JOHN SIMPSON  SO the wheel is gone round I find and you are now pretty near the topClimb away Jack but remember to sit fast when you get on the pinnacleSuch another tumble as your last would go near to undo us  Dame Fortune has been pleased to give me a lift also yet I could not have gone on cleverly if you had not supplied me with the  ready  The baronet's cash is exhausted and I have been kind enough to furnish him with a brace of hundreds which added to the sum he has lost to me since I wrote last makes a cool thousand and all I have to shew for it is a piece of stamped paper bond and warrant my boy that's all  Give me credit Jack I am a Machiavel in politicsMadame Du Pont is the finest bait I ever had to angle with she is really a woman of sense and spirit and will very soon be as adroit as any of our fraternityHer husband is a silly fellow but he is a Frenchman and suffers her to do just what she pleasesShe coquets  with the baronet and he loses his money with the best grace imaginableFilthy dice are banished Monsieur Du Pont thinks it too masculine for ladies to play at hazard and the noise of the box gives Lady Desmond the headachI am much mistaken if the heartach is not added to her other complaints very soonSo now we only piddle at loo quinze pharo vingt et un  Lady Desmond never plays and I think she begins to look coldly on her female friend but while Sir James's warmth continues her ladyship's frigidity is of small consequenceThe only end it can answer will be to disgust her husband for she is too timid to oppose him and our fair ally is not of a humour to be easily discouraged  where either her pleasure or profit is concerned  I rejoice to hear that Evelyn is gone to Ireland I was devilishly afraid he would have come athwart usI made him believe I had left off play and I must have looked silly if he had found me at itI wish we were as fairly rid of StanleyI can't bear that manI don't know why but I shrink before him and yet I am no coward JackA man should have courage that plays all the game and yet not affect the bully eitherI have seen you much too hot upon some occasionsBut I hope that humour was pretty well  corrected  by your Irish expedition  I wish you joy of your lordly nabobhe is a prize indeedStick  to him like a leech Jack for there can be no sin in robbing those who have robbed others'Tis every honest man's duty to recover stolen goods from a thief though he had no original claim to the propertyGo on and prosper then  Yours GEORGE SEWELL  LETTER XXXVII  CHARLES EVELYN TO MRS STANLEY  Bath  I HAVE not words to express the pain I have suffered from your last letter"Her health and spirits decline visiblyA cruel something preys upon her heart"  O Lucy how could you write those words and not efface them with your tearsI thought I had already experienced every species of anguish that could be inflicted by disappointed loveFrom respect and tenderness to the dear cause of all my sufferings I had brought my humbled mind to such a state of acquiescence as to forbear complainingNay I am persuaded I could without repining have endured to see her married to the object of her choiceBut to know she is unhappy must render me so beyond a hope of cureI have been long labouring to consider this idol of my heart as misers do their hidden treasure though hopeless of enjoying it yet while I thought 'twas safe I could not look upon myself undoneNow I am robbed of my ideal wealth and am left poor indeed  O Lucy if you ever loved me strive I conjure you to assuage her gentle sorrows and pour the balm of friendship on her wounded heart Gracious heaven what can the affliction be that thus oppresses her mild spirits Would I could bear it for her and ease her troubled breast  Perhaps this place or Bristol might be of service to her health perhaps 'tis that alone which is impaired and the now coming spring may with its vernal breezes bring back health to her and happiness to meComparative happiness I mean for I have long been wretched but never was completely so till now  Let Lady Juliana know that I shall quit this place immediatelyYou  know that I intended it before but if I had not nothing on earth should now detain me here I would fly to the Antipodes to leave it free for her Surely my fate is singularly severe that thus impels me to a voluntary banishment from every place in which my happiness is centered  I cannot Lucy enter into your raillery in regard to Miss Harley I do not think her amiable but were she all that cou'd attract "Envy in woman or desire in man" her charms wou'd be intirely lost on meMy eyes are closed to beauty I only feel its power when I turn them inward and gaze upon the image in my heart  I am sorry to hear that Madam Du Pont is so intimate with Emma  tho' I am certain it will never be in her power to pervert her principles or render her heart callous yet from the hint you give and my own observation I by no means think her an eligible companion for my sisterA female mind cannot have too much delicacy provided that it does not degenerate into affectationA gross or boisterous woman is an unnatural character and were I married I had much rather my wife should converse with men than monsters  The freedom that subsists between female friends renders the conversation of such a person as I have mentioned infinitely more dangerous than that of a malelibertineA woman easily sees thro' his designs and may if she pleases be on her  guard against themWhile the insiduous companion of her private hours without alarming saps the foundation of her every virtue  But grant they should be fixed and are impregnable will not the tainted gale by often passing o'er the beauteous flower tarnish its lustre abate its fragrant scent take off its polish and fade its blooming tints As chaste as delicate believe me Lucy as the opening rose shou'd be the female heart  Not even the present anxiety of my mind can render me indifferent to the happiness of one with whom I am so tenderly connected as Lady DesmondRead the above passage  to her and I am certain she will want no further caution  I shall set out for Ireland tomorrowRemember my sister tho' sure I need not urge your friendship that the treasure of my heart is committed to your care and may your kind attention be rewarded with the restoration of Lady Juliana's health and happiness  Present my affections to our sisters to yours and my Stanley and write soon I intreat you to your unhappy and affectionate brother  C EVELYN  P S  Direct for me at Captain Harrison's Kildarestreet DublinI am all amazementHarrison is just come in and tells me that Miss Harley has offered to accompany his sister to Ireland What can she mean She shall not go if I can prevent it  End of the First Volume
