profession of an  author  would perhaps never have permitted the writer of the following pages to doubt the superiority of the  literary artist  or the propriety of the encouragement given to  his  labours above those of  others  had not an equal encouragement been obtained of the Legislature a few years ago for  Engravers etchers  and  mezzotinto scrapers  This circumstance leading to an enquiry into the respective merits of Artists in general the  practitioners  of the  useful  were found to lay so similar a claim to public encouragement with the  professors  of the  polite  arts that the distinction which the Law had made in the right of property to their different labours could not fail to appear extremely partial and inequitable  With a view to state this partiality to the publick the following tract in which the  scientific  and  useful  Arts are compared with those of  Literature  and  Curiosity  in the respect abovementioned would have earlier appeared agreeably to the notice given in the Public Advertiser of June had not the argument been thought to be affected by the then uncertain state of  Literary Property  This being since in some Measure determined and the Doctrine in question having received the sanction of very high authority the present Publication is judged expedient to promote the Design of obtaining farther encouragement for the exertions of  useful Ingenuity  and thence facilitating future Improvements in the  Produce Manufactures  and  Commerce  of these Kingdoms  Not that  Artists  in general will probably think it prudent to solicit an innovation at present so repugnant to public prejudice as that of being put  precisely on the same footing  with  Authors  and  Engravers  By displaying however the equity of their pretensions to equal consideration and encouragement it is presumed that the less objection  may be made to their application for a parliametary extension of the usual term of exercising their inventions by patent with a repeal of the clause in the monopoly act which now restrains the crown in all cases indiscriminately from granting such patents for more than fourteen years a term in many particular cases greatly inadequate to the labour pains and expence attendant on bringing useful inventions and discoveries to perfection The Moderation of such a request may possibly induce some publicspirited patron of the  useful arts  to urge more powerfully the expediency of granting to their professors privileges proportionate to their personal merit and public Utility  CONTENTS  INTRODUCTION  A property in

THE ARTISTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF GREATBRITAIN  INTRODUCTION  A Writer who has devoted his time as much to the  useful  as the  polite  Arts may take on him without impropriety to treat of that very partial distinction which the laws of his country have made between his right of property to the emoluments arising from his different pursuits  As an  Author  and an  Artist  of a  certain class  an exclusive right to profit by his compositions and inventions is secured to him by Statute for a considerable term of years as an  Artificer  or  artist  of any  other class  he is destitute of such security Let his  inventions  or  discoveries  cost him what time or expence they may let them redound ever so much to public utility or private profit the author of them is adjudged to have no exclusive right to the exercise of his invention or the use of his discovery  It is indeed whimsical that in a  scientific  age and  commercial  nation a property in  words  should be held more sacred than a property in  things  that an  Artist  who has  literature  enough to give a  verbal description  of the nature and design of any newlyinvented and useful machine should be legally entitled to the sole right of multiplying the copies of such  description  though he is denied such right of manufacturing or multiplying the copies of the  Machine  itself This is still more whimsical if we reflect that such  verbal description  may be only a matter of  mere curiosity  and the first copy of it have been composed with facility in a few hours while the  real instrument  may be a subject of  great utility  and its fabrication have cost the inventor the study application and labour of years to surmount the difficulties attending its first construction  At a time therefore when the farther indulgence of the Legislature is solicited in favour of  literary property  and even that which has been already granted by Statute is thought by many an infringement of the natural rights of genius the professors of the  useful arts  will be wanting to themselves if they neglect the opportunity of laying claim to at least an  equal  indulgence founded on a plea of at least equal validity  Not that the  Useful Artist  need rest his cause solely on  comparative  merit or found his pretensions to a like indulgence on the Statute in favour of  Literary Property  With equal claim to the natural rights of Genius it is by no means difficult to support his  superior  right to public encouragement on principles of political expediency  At the same time it is not pretended that this partial distinction between the  Author  and the  Artificer  is altogether peculiar to this island The practice of most other nations respecting the  common property  of discoveries and inventions in the useful arts affords a strong presumption that even granting a natural right of property in them to subsist it is either incapable of being ascertained and secured by Law or incompatible with the political interests of the community And it is in vain for individuals to talk of possessing a property which the law cannot ascertain and secure or to contend for such possession if it militate against the general interests of Society  How far a right of property in useful inventions and discoveries be founded in Nature be capable of being protected by Law or consistent with the general good of a commercial people becomes of course the subject of disquisition in the following pages  SECTION I  Of a  NATURAL RIGHT  of  PROPERTY  in new Inventions and Discoveries in general  IN the late contests about  Literary Property  much hath been said and written on the nature and origin of property in general The common lawyers wedded to words and forms have bandied about the technical terms of  corporeal  and  incorporeal  till they have almost forgot their simple use It hath been proved however against them that there are  incorporeal  rights as easily ascertainable by law and as justly entitled to the protection of it as others which are  corporeal  Without entering therefore into the dispute of the  jus in re  or particularly discussing the nature of the property contended for I shall enquire only how it originated and became the natural right of the claimant  The Lawyers in general have not less perplexed the question respecting the  origin  of  property  than they have puzzled that about the  nature  of it Restricted by the narrow notions which confine property to a  corpus  or body they have recurred no farther back for a right of possession than  prior occupancy  setting discoveries and inventions in literature and science on the same footing with the use and improvement of corporeal possessions But the  Author  and  Inventor  may deduce a right of property to their respective labours from a still earlier and more general source Every man whom Providence sends into the world hath a natural right to live in it and if to live in  it to the means of subsistence In the present state of society however the man who is born to no estate real or personal finds the means of subsistence by mere possession already engrossed by prior occupants he is therefore of necessity reduced to the creation of new means of livelihood a right to all  corporeal  property being already secured to others he must have recourse for subsistence to the  incorporeal  property he is endowed with by Nature in the use of his personal talents he must live by his wits or his labour  Steal  he must not and if to  beg  he be ashamed shall he be denied a right to the contrivance of his brain or the work of his hands This were to affirm that the  poor  are the naturalborn  Slaves  of the  Rich  and that the possession of corporeal property however obtained gives a right to the possession of all other an affirmation which I presume no freeborn subject of this country will venture to make  It is indeed now very generally admitted that a man can have no better natural right to any thing in the world than to the fruits of his own ingenuity and industry it were needless therefore to throw away time in confuting the casuistry by which the contrary opinion hath been maintained  SECTION II  Of the pretended difference between  AUTHORS  and  ARTIFICERS  regarding a right of property in their respective inventions  THE Advocates for  Literary Property  have laboured much to maintain as  real  an  imaginary  difference which they have set up between the  Author  and the  Artificer  in regard to an exclusive right of property in their respective compositions Not that they had any valid plea to offer in support of their argument but because the right of the  Artificer  being universally held untenable at Commonlaw if they admitted the  Author  to stand in the same predicament they could not support his claim to a  perpetuity  in his  copyright  which they modestly contended for  The futility of the arguments adduced to maintain this supposed difference between the inventors of machines and the authors of books hath been so fully displayed in several late publications and pleadings that it were superfluous to attempt to corroborate what has been delivered with so much equity and energy by the first lawyers of this and perhaps any other nation  It will be sufficient to refer the reader who is curious to peruse them at large to a pamphlet entitled An Enquiry into the Nature and Origin of Literary Property published in to the late pleadings of the Court of Sessions in Scotland the Speeches of Lord Camden and several of the Judges on the Appeal and final determination of the cause in the House of Lords  A certain celebrated writer however having since taken up the pen to urge a similar plea it may not be amiss to take some notice of it  See A modest Plea for Copyright by Catharine Macaulay  With the intention says Mrs Macaulay of depriving authors of the honest the dearbought reward of their literary labours they have been raised a little higher instead of lower than the Angels  Ibid page  and at the same time been levelled with the Inventors of a very inferior Order These  inventors  of an order  very inferior  to  authors  of  books  are the  authors  of  new inventions  and discoveries in the  useful arts  who it is asserted would be better rewarded for their ingenuity than writers even did they both stand upon the same footing in regard to time and other circumstances for the emoluments arising from their different inventive faculties  I know not how this ingenious writer will make good this assertion but I am persuaded that if the  authors  of such  new inventions  and  discoveries  did stand upon the same footing in regard to a legal security of a right of property in their respective productions as  authors  of  books  do they would not complain of injustice or contend for a  perpetuity  in such right  Every common capacity says this writer can soon find out the use of a machine which is not the case with a book I accede to the latter part of the assertion because there are many books whose use cannot be found out at all as they are totally  useless  if not hurtful the former part I deny for as good a reason Had this advocate for literary merit been  familiar with the labours of our mathematical philosophical and even mechanic artists she would have known that there are many curious and useful machines with whose use the very makers of them are totally unacquainted  It is a length of time continues this author before the value of a literary publication is discovered and acknowledged by the vulgar and even when the merits of a work of this kind in regard to the honest intentions of the writer and the execution of the composition is in general allowed the malice of partyprejudice and that leaven of selfishness which prevails in the characters of the greater number of individuals may for a long term of years keep back the sale of a book which teaches an offensive doctrine or tells disagreeable truths to the public  I hope the writer does not speak experimentally on this occasion as I am ready to go still farther in favour of deserving  authors  It is not only to the selfishness of individuals and the prejudice of party we may impute the keeping back the sale of a good book it may also be imputed to ignorance inattention or want of taste in the Public in general from which causes the more curious refined and instructive the book the longer it will be before it attract sufficient notice to obtain a general sale  If I do not mistake no less than seven and twenty years elapsed before Sir Isaac Newton's  Principia  came to a second edition and I may cite Mrs Macaulay's own authority for saying that when Lord Bacon published his Philosophical Ideas they were so little understood that they were deemed  literary lumber nay that the learned and Royal James whom the Earl of Shaftelbury terms the schoolmaster of his people compared them to the ways of God past finding out  In the same predicament may also the last book of Newton's  Principia  be said to stand even with most of our best mathematicians to this very day  This is undoubtedly a good argument for extending the term at present limited by statute in literary copyright There are certainly many laborious and expensive works whose sale during that term will by no means compensate the authors or undertakers for the intense study long labour and immense cost attending their execution  But the same argument holds equally good with respect to the authors of new inventions and discoveries in the arts and sciences many of which are effected only by amazing application tedious process and prodigious expence And yet the  author  thinks eight and twenty years too short a term in which to reap the benefit of his labours while the  artist  or  artificer  is not entitled by any law in being to a property in the effects of his ingenuity for a single day  I will not censure the impropriety with which the abovementioned writer calls the latter an inventor of a  very inseriour  order I beg leave however to remind the reader that it is not in the capacity of  writers  that either Bacon or Newton particularly the latter lays claim to public veneration The genius of Newton was not of a  literary  cast nor does he raise our admiration or command our respect so  much as an  author  as he does in the capacity of an  inventor  or  artist  The superiority of his character is not derived from his superior talents in turning periods and making  books  but in solving geometrical problems making physical experiments and manufacturing prisms and opticglasses It is Sir Isaac Newton the  mathematician  the  experimentalist  the  mechanic  and not the  writer  whose name is so highly honoured and transmitted with so much renown to posterity  It was to this great philosopher in these capacities also that the respect paid to him when living and the emoluments he reaped in consequence of it are more immediately to be attributed and shall the ingenuity of those talents which made his fortune in life and confer immortality on his name after death be held  very inferiour  to his literary abilities which were at best on a level with mediocrity  Locke hath remarked it as a circumstance affecting to a speculative mind that a rational being should be employed all day long like a mere mechanical machine in sawing a block of marble Montesquieu thought it no less so that a man of learning and ingenuity should employ himself as constantly in culling out words of the same found in order to express himself in rhime and yet we have numerous instances in which a knack at versification though almost as easily attained as the gift of counting one's fingers has raised the possessor into a degree of public estimation and hath elevated a blockhead destitute of science as of sense to an equal rank with men of invention and genius  It may be said of  Montesquieu  that he was no great poet and that  nulla ar's habet osorem nistignorantem  None despise any art but they who are ignorant of it whence the poets infer that authors who write prose do it merely because they cannot write verse It may be retorted however on the versifiers that the high opinion they conceive of their own art generally proceeds from their ignorance of most others At the same time it must be owned that as far as  writers  are concerned none can be accounted an adept in his art or fully master of the language in which he writes who has not both a taste and a talent for versification In this view the art of poetry is like that of dancing an accomplishment worth the attainment of youth though constantly neglected as wisdom and gravity are attained by age    It is hinted by the writer abovementioned that  authors  claim a greater indulgence of the legislature than other  artists  because their writings tend to the improvement of the human mind whereas the productions of inventors of an  inferivur  order serve only to promote the purposes of luxury or at best to furnish those conveniences which are not absolutely necessary to the comforts of life I shall not here enter into the discussion of the political dispute about the conveniences of life or take on me to determine how far the purposes of luxury may be rendered compatible with the interests of a commercial nation but this I may venture to declare that there is a wide difference between the encouragement politically necessary to be given to literature in the infancy of a language and uncivilized state of society and that which is either necessary or expedient when both are arrived to a degree of cultivation and refinement  Indeed I do by no means admit that the human mind is so much improved by mere  reading  as is generally imagined An application to practical science enlarges and improves it frequently much more than the study of mere theory But were it even otherwise I cannot help thinking that the literary productions of a refined and luxurious age tend less to the  farther improvement of the minds of individuals than new inventions and discoveries in the arts and sciences contribute to the farther improvement of the body politic and the political happiness of a people  Be this as it may whatever general argument affects the interest of the  author  in regard to his right of property in new literary compositions must equally affect the  artificer  in respect to a right of property in new mechanical or other useful inventions It is therefore very inconsequentially inferred that the one hath a greater or less natural right to the fruits of his industry and ingenuity than the other  If the case of ingenious  authors  or of their representatives the booksellers be then in any degree hard and deserving relief that of ingenious  artificers  is still much more so as they would be well satisfied were they only placed on the worst footing in which the former securely stand under the protection of the statute  SECTION III  On the political expediency of giving public encouragement to  INVENTIONS  and  DISCOVERIES  in the  ARTS  and  SCIENCES  in general  IT may be thought needless to urge any other argument to prove the political expediency of encouraging improvements in arts and sciences than the universal practice of enlightened and wellregulated states Among commercial nations in particular the superiority which the one acquires over the other is universally allowed to result from a superior degree of ingenuity and industry in its respective inhabitants It is these that give rise to improvements in agriculture manufactures and commerce and are the inexhaustible resources of national wealth and political happiness  While a spirit of emulation therefore prevails between states as among individuals it becomes the national interest and thence the indispensible duty of Government to promote a spirit of industry and foster the seeds of ingenuity not only among the superior class of authors and artists but also among the lower order of artisans mechanics mariners and husbandmen  The favourites of the Muses and such of the higher order of inventors whose thirst of glory or natural curiosity sufficiently animate them to exploits of genius these I say need no stimulation to urge them forward in the pursuits of  fame or knowledge It is to such however that Government has been frequently liberal as if it were laudably necessary to make a generous provision for those who devote their talents disinterestedly to the service of the public without regard to their private emolument With the generality of mankind nevertheless whatever be their inventive talents or intellectual capacity a principle of selfinterest is the ruling motive of action and the only constant stimulative to the exertion of their private abilities for the public service  Not that the greatest of our poetical geniuses have been insensible to pecuniary emoluments even Shakespeare himself as a brother bard observes  For gain not glory wing'd his tow'ring flight  And grew immortal in his own despight  Hence it is that a reward proportional to the merit of that service should ever be held forth for their encouragement  As to mere labour though it should not as Virtue is said to be left merely to its own reward it certainly should be as Virtue generally is rewarded but moderately Men possessed of no property and capable of nothing but labour are entitled to nothing but the means of daily subsistence Were they possessed of more they would remit their daily labour so that a numerous body of industrious poor is a fund of real wealth to the community But the reward of incessant labour and that of industrious ingenuity should be different the perseverance of the  labourer  providing merely for the subsistence of the individual or of a few while the industry of the  inventor  provides for the convenience of hundreds the subsistence of thousands and the support of the State The difference which Nature hath thus made among men and which  is infinitely more striking and characteristical than the gewgaw distinctions of civil society gives them a real title to preeminence The marks of superior talents are indelible proofs of their rightful claim to superior respect and consideration It is hence with the utmost injustice that the ignorant and indolent Great blend the artificer and the labourer together and confound them indiscriminately with the refuse of mankind  With the  labourer  may also be ranked the retailer of simple commodities whose profession requiring the meanest of natural talents should be as little profitable as possible consistent with the support of a family employed in domestic duties or engaged like himself in the business of his profession  Nothing it is true is more common than to see an opulent retailer live luxuriously himself and maintain his family in idleness out of profits oppressively wrung from the hard hands of the labourer or insidiously derived from the inventive brain of the artisan but where the channels of consumption are not increased by the increasing number of traders their multiplicity becomes a burthen to the state and their extravagance a political evil of the most fatal tendency These therefore merit no encouragement that may serve to increase their number which is already become a public nuisance  With venders of their own manufactures cultivators of their own or other mens' lands and with traders of a superior class by whom the Art of Commerce itself is almost improved into a Science the case is different As patrons and  promoters of the useful arts in general they merit every encouragement which the law can secure or ministerial policy bestow  Again it is necessary to distinguish not only between the merits of different classes of artists but between the  real  and  nominal  artists of the same class between the Manufacturer for instance who merely copies and vends the inventions of others and he who fabricates and vends his own Any peculiar encouragement given to the former tends to establish a monopoly injurious to traders in general but without such encouragement being given to the latter the spirit of invention is checked ingenuity droops and the want of improvement in the commodities of sale prove equally injurious to trade itself  That the Legislature have in some instances looked on the expediency of giving public encouragement to useful inventions and discoveries in the same light is obvious The parliamentary rewards that have been offered and paid for the finding out the Longitude for the method of making saltwater fresh for a nostrum for the Stone and for several other inventions and discoveries afford a sufficient proof that the encouragement of ingenuity by rewarding the authors of such inventions and discoveries is in general adjudged to be politically expedient  From the many objections therefore that have been started to almost every such particular encouragement it is presumed that exceptions must have been taken either to the nature and extent of it or to the method in which it has been  bestowed I shall for this reason proceed to take a view of the several modes in which such encouragement hath been offered and given and endeavour by obviating those objections to point out a method of bestowing it in such a manner as may be least hurtful to individuals and most conducive to the ends proposed viz the contributing to the conveniencies and embellishments of life and the facilitating future improvements in the produce manufactures and commerce of our country  SECTION IV  On the methods which have hitherto been taken to encourage improvements in the Arts  AS the first of these methods I rank  parliamentary premiums  being the most liberal and best becoming the character of an opulent and powerful people  To this method however may be made many objections as well on the part of the public whose money is thus bestowed as on the part of the  Artist  or  inventor  who is to receive it as a compensation for his labour or ingenuity The expence and difficulty of obtaining it may be grievous to the one as that of granting it may be burthensome to the other while the  quantum  of it will always run the risk of being inadequate either to the utility of which the invention may prove to the public to the merit of the discovery or to the pains which the author may have taken to bring it to perfection  whereas such premium should be ever adapted to all three  We have a remarkable instance of all these circumstances united in the affair of Mr Harrison's contrivance for finding out the Longitude There is no doubt that the ingenious contriver after the success of forty years application deserved the reward to which he was entitled It was yet with difficulty he obtained it and though it might be deemed adequate to the pains he had taken and the ingenuity of his contrivance it is indubitable that the discovery of his invention hath proved of little utility in Navigation I do not find his clock is ever likely to become of general and common use as the encouragement given by so ample a compensation seems to require  It is remarkable also that Mrs Stevens's famous medicine for dissolving the Stone for the discovery of whose composition the Legislature granted five thousand pounds however efficacious before has cured hardly any body fince it was made public  I will not call in question Mr Irwin's method of making saltwater fresh but am well assured that the discovery of as simple and speedy a process might have been purchased for less money  There is indeed no little danger that both the  quantum  and the facility of obtaining of parliamentary premiums may depend as well on personal interest as on particular ingenuity or public utility The merit of the incomparable Hogarth is universally acknowledged and yet it will hardly be denied  that an useful artist of equal ingenuity hath some right to complain that he is entitled to no property in his inventions when the widow of that ingenious engraver was indulged with an additional term of twenty years' copyright in the designs of her deceased husband over and above the fourteen years that had already been enjoyed by virtue of the Statute  The indulgence lately granted by Parliament to the proprietors of that elegant pile of building the Adelphi to dispose of their property by way of Lottery appears to have given very general disgust It is to be hoped the like favour bestowed on the ingenious Mr Cox to dispose of his Museum will give more satisfaction But whatever merit might justly recommend these Artists to parliamentary indulgence this method of giving public encouragement to the Authors of new inventions is so liable to be perverted by partiality or prejudice that it can by no means be consistent with sound policy to permit the indiscriminate application of individuals to be indulged in the use of it  Of the petty premiums presented by the Societies for the Encouragement of Arts and manufactures supported by popular subscription I shall say but little as indeed but little is to be said Instituted on publicspirited principles but perverted by private cabals the laudable purposes of their institution have been seldom attained In the mean time we hear the candidates for their premiums as clamorous in their complaints of injustice done to their merit as severe in their invectives against the want of knowledge or candour in those who are to judge of it It is with these as with all other mixed societies however unanimous and moderate in their  commencement like the parts of an heterogeneous fluid the more solid and important subside while the volatile and insignificant rise uppermost and float constantly on the surface The more sensible and judicious of the members remain silent or retire leaving the business of the association to be transacted by the empty the ignorant and the vain  From such societies therefore little good and still less permanency in the administration of it is to be expected If partiality and prejudice also may be supposed to affect the great council of the nation how much more may such an unwholesome leaven be supposed to affect the fermenting particles of so preposterous a compound  As an essential part of the criterion by which the quantity and quality of public encouragement proper to be given to artists and inventors of any kind is the public utility of their compositions and inventions it is indeed highly improper that the  quantum  at least of such encouragement should be determined before such utility be eventually decided  The most plausible and politic method of bestowing that encouragement is therefore that by which the eventual utility of such inventions is made the measure of reward This is effected either by vesting a legal right of property in the inventor as in the case of writers engravers c or by the grant of Letterspatent from the crown as in the case of mathematical artists chemical experimentalists artificers and manufacturers  SECTION V  On the similarity of predicament between the practitioners of the  SCIENTIFIC  and  MECHANIC  arts and the professors of the arts of  DESIGN  I Have already endeavoured to shew that  authors  who practise rather the  imitative  than the  inventive  arts at least all but those few writers whose productions are truly  original  have not a more natural right to the proprietary indulgence granted them by the legislature than have the  artificers  whose inventions and discoveries are really  new  and  useful  I am not a little flattered to find an opinion long since suggested by my own reading coincident with a late reflection of that great luminary in law and equity Lord Camden  I shall beg leave to expatiate here therefore somewhat more diffusely on the impropriety of that distinction which the legislature hath made between the practitioners of the  useful  and those of the  polite  arts and of the injurious partiality of the law in regard to their right of property in their respective productions  But perhaps the state of dereliction and oppression under which the  useful arts  at present labour proceeds rather from involuntary neglect than design Inventors and artificers have been wanting to their own interests in not applying like authors and booksellers for a  copyright  in their inventions and compositions Time has been when  literary artists  were  obliged as others are now to purchase a temporary property in their works with letterspatent from the Crown nay the use of the press itself was once held dependant on royal prerogative  Writers  have been emancipated from such a state of slavery the press hath been laid open and on application to the legislature authors and their assigns have been vested with an exclusive right of property in their productions Nay practitioners in the arts of design and as I conceive composers of music too are invested with a similar right Shall the authors then of chemical discoveries the inventors of mathematical instruments the contrivers of essential improvements in manufactures shall these I say hesitate to follow the example or doubt of obtaining similar redress  On principles of equity no rational objection can be made to it nor indeed on any other ground without arguing inferior merit from superior utility and hard indeed were the case of industrious ingenuity if its desert should defeat its reward  The  polite  arts it is true make a more splendid and imposing appearance they assume a dignity and importance which may seem to give them a right to property and support but it is merely on the presumptuous plea by which a reduced and beggarly  noblesse  infer from the possession of empty titles a right to the luxuries of life while they indolently eat the bread of idleness  'Tis great 'tis wonderful sublime  No doubt to build the lofty rhime  But deaf to what the  poet  sings  Though charm his muse the ear of kings  The  patriot  sees more wit and good in  Th' invention of a marrowpudding  ANON  But granting that  authors  under the auspices of the Muses and the specious pretence of improving the human mind by their writings are entitled to greater encouragement than other artists the merit of  engravers etchers  and  mezzotintoscrapers  surely places them in the same predicament in the eye of reason with that of practitioners in the other manual arts▪ It cannot be pretended that the labour of the engraver of a print or the copyist of a picture in  chiaro oscuro  is either more ingenious or useful than that of the contriver of a mathematical instrument or mechanical machine And yet the  engravers  and  mezzotintoscrapers  following the example of the  authors  obtained by degrees an equal indulgence from the Legislature to an exclusive right of property in their labours  It may not be amiss to trace the proceeding of these favoured artists in their successful attempts to obtain this desired indulgence  It appears from the Journals of the House of Commons that the petition of the  engravers  for the act which passed in their favour in the th of George II refers to the statute of Queen Anne in favour of  authors  with whom the petitioners desired to be put  on the same sooting  This desire however seems at that time to have been rather premature as they could obtain only a statutory right for the single term of  fourteen  years and that only in the copies of their own original designs The obtaining this was yet encouragement to ask more  By a subsequent act in the th of his present Majesty they were accordingly indulged in the very ample manner following  Be it enacted That all and every person and persons who shall engrave etch or work in  mezzotinto  or  chiaro oscuro  or cause to be engraved etched or worked any print taken from any picture drawing model or sculpture either ancient or modern shall have and are hereby declared to have the benefit and protection of the said act  meaning the act of the th of George II  and this act for the term herein after mentioned in like manner as if such print had been graved or drawn from the original design of such graver etcher or draftsman and if any person shall engrave print and publish or import for sale any copy of any such print contrary to the true intent and meaning of this and the said former act every such person shall be liable to the penalties contained in the said act to be recovered as therein and herein after mentioned  The term of the exclusive privilege granted by the former act was in this also extended  The sole right and liberty intended to be secured and protected by the said former act and this act shall be extended continued and be extended continued and be vested in the respective proprietors for the space of  twentyeight years  to commence from the day of the first publishing of any of the works respectively herein before and in the said former act mentioned  We see here the mere copyist or  imitator  put on a sooting with  original inventors  and even the manual excrcise of the graver scraping knife  stippling punch and needle more fully rewarded than even the labours of the writer  For it is to be observed that the  author's  right to the  second  fourteen years is conditional he cannot legally transfer it to the bookseller till the expiration of the  first  nay it may admit of a doubt whether he can do it  then  for a longer term than his own life should that fall short of eight and twenty years from the time of the first publication    But will it be pretended that the use of those tools in their operation on the surface of a copperplate is more ingenious or useful and therefore more worthy of public encouragement than is the use of the same or similar tools in their operation on any other substance or to any other purpose  It is remarkable that by the last mentioned act the partiality complained of by useful artists is extended also to the  polite  I had almost said the  useless  ones It will not be doubted that the arts of sculpture and of casting figures of plaister of Paris potter's earth c from models are equally ingenious and curious with those of etching engraving and scraping delineations of them on copper and yet the engraver who copies after any such model either ancient or modern is vested with an exclusive right to multiply such copies for his own profit whereas the artist who is at the pains to form moulds from such models and casts the very figure itself has no such right but may have his figures imitated and multiplied to the profit of others without legal redress  A singular instance of partiality respecting the right of property in this particular may be observed between the caution with which  engravers  invade the right and attempt  to pirate the works of each other and the temerity with which  modellers  copy without scruple the ingenious works of their brother artists  Nay so little idea of copyright have the latter in their respective labours that they disregard even the privilege of a patent in the hands of other artists under pretence that their manufacture is not of new invention  At least this is the plea which I have seen advanced in the public prints against the validity of the patent of those ingenious and excellent artists Messieurs Wedgwood and Bentloy for taking off the sigures of antique models in a  terracotta  peculiar to themselves  I know not how far our courts of  law  may countenance this pretext but the modellers are certainly as much entitled in  reason  to an exclusive right of copying models ancient and modern as the eagravers to copy ancient or modern drawings of them  I might indeed go farther and insist that in equity they should be admitted to claim a right under the same act which seems peculiarly intended to favour the arts dependent on the  press  for if the linenprinters paperstainers there are other  paperstainers  besides  authors  claim under it as some of them do  That is such as print and stain from engravings or scrapings on copperplates Now it might puzzle the most able casuist at the statute law to give a reason why an exclusive copyright should be granted in an impression taken from a  copperplate  and not in the same impression taken from a block of  cut wood  And yet if I am not much misinsormed in this matter such is the state of the case  an exclusive right to their respective  prints  and  patterns  the  caster  of  impressions  of models in  plaisler  of  Paris potter's clay  or  papiermacheé  has an equal right to insist on his exclusive property to the  copies  taken off his  moulds    unless indeed an essential difference be made by the surfaces sustaining the impression being  hollow  or  slat  between a seeming plane and a  bassorelievo  which I think will be hardly asserted as it would lead to a farther distinction between the  basso  and  alto  and the whole argument become ridiculous  If then linenprinters paperstainers papiermachéworkers and modellers of every kind are equally entitled in  equity  and some of them by  law  to an exclusive  copyright  in their respective labours no good reason can possibly be given why artificers of all kinds should not be equally entitled to such an exclusive privilege of fabricating any manufacture whose novelty of form or use and design are peculiar to themselves  The late Lord Hardwicke speaking of the act of Queen Anne in favour of authors and booksellers called it "a general standing patent" calculated to save them the trouble and expence from between fourscore and an hundred pounds of applying to the King for a privilege every time they printed a new book  Now the acts of the th of George II and of the th of his present Majesty are nothing but copies of the said act of Queen Anne confessedly passed to put engravers etchers mezzotintoscrapers and printsellers on the same footing With authors and booksellers  What a pity the woodcutters and letterfounders did not join in the petition that the legislature might have seen either the absurdity of passing such an act or that of not putting  artists  of all kinds on the same footing    But why are authors engravers etchers mezzotintoscrapers and by virtue of their right booksellers printsellers linenprinters paperstainers c to be so highly favoured above letterfounders woodcutters modellers in plaister chasers enamellers engravers on plate and gems and indeed all other artists and artificers employed in the embellishments and conveniencies of life  If this question be unanswerable surely that must be equally so which asks why the authors of  new inventions  in the  useful arts  the  improvers  of our  produce  and  manufactures  the  promoters  of our national  trade  and  commerce  should not be equally favoured  The  inventor  of a  machine  or  art useful  in life is now almost universally admitted to stand precisely on the same footing with the author of a book but were this still doubted it cannot be doubted that he stands upon as good a footing and has the same right to encouragement as the  engraver  of a  print  or the  practitioner  of an  art  more  ornamental  than  useful  Would it not be extremely inequitable therefore and highly derogatory to the wisdom and justice of the legislature that the  latter  should continue to enjoy the benefit to use Lord Hardwicke's words of a  general standing patent  without any expence for every new print he publishes and that the  former  shall still be put to the trouble of applying to the King for a patent and  put to the expence of eighty or a hundred pounds  I rate the expence here in the most moderate manner If the patent require to be engrossed on more than one skin of parchment and the clerks in office generally find it necessary to have at least two the  es are doubled and the expence of a patent amounts to much more  every time he  publishes a new invention    An artificer may be very ingenious and at the same time be very poor he may have bestowed his time and industry he may even have expended a moderate patrimony in bringing his invention to perfection and shall his labour time and money be after all thrown away at least with regard to himself and his family unless he can raise an hundred or an hundred and forty pounds to purchase a right of property in the fruits of his past labour Yet so it is and the consequence is that either the invention is suppressed and the public deprived of its advantages or it is sold for a trifle to some wealthier artisan whose purse enables him to profit by the other's ingenuity Well may the  useful artist  exclaim with the poet  Sic vos non vobis nidisicates aves  Sic vos non vobis vellera sertis oves  Sic vos non vobis mellisicatis apes  Sic vos non vobis sertis aratra boves  And well may these lines be thus paraphrased  So for the cuckow builds the lark her nest  For fleecing shearers sheep provide the vest  For goading plowmen oxen turn the soil  And bees make honey for the wasps to spoil  But perhaps I am unnecessarily labouring to prove what is suffciently obvious for if I rightly recollect it has been long since maintained  That the author of a machine or useful invention has as well as the author of a book an equitable right to insist that he should have the exclusive right of selling his work for such a length of time as ought to reimburse him his expence and recompence him for his trouble  See an Enquiry into the Nature and Origin of Literary Property vo  How far this argument will hold good respecting what the legislature hath already done in placing  inventors  and even mere  practitioners  of the  polite  arts on the footing of  authors  I will not pretend to say but if it hath done right with respect to the  ornamental  arts the argument will hold  a fortiori  in favour of the  useful  Either the legislature hath done too much for  engravers etchers stipplers  and  scrapers  or it hath done too little for all other artists  As it would ill become an individual therefore to impeach the wisdom and justice of the legislature I admit the propriety of what it has done for the former artists in particular and thence infer the propriety of the application for its extending the like indulgence to artists in general  SECTION VI  On the objections that may be made to placing the  USEFUL  and  POLITE  arts on the same footing  I am not insensible that in the contracted view of a narrowminded politician a thousand imaginary difficulties will attend the adoption of the expedient proposed but things are not impracticable or improper merely because they are difficult If the useful arts have this claim on the justice of the community we may rest assured that the adopting it will have a good effect on its public interests  As general reflections however tend not to convince those who can raise only particular exceptions I shall examine into the validity of a few of the most striking objections  The first difficulty that presents itself against the granting an exclusive privilege to the authors of new inventions in the useful arts is the general one of establishing  monopolies  which are supposed to have the pernicious effects of enriching a  few  and depriving a  multitude  of the means of subsistence of enhancing the price of the manufactures monopolized and thence of course proving injurious to domestic oeconomy and foreign commerce  As to  monopolies  it is an odious word without a determinate meaning In its legal sense as desined by Hawkins Blackstone and others it has no proper reference to  new inventions  in the  useful arts  Monopolies says Blackstone  are much the same offence in other branches of trade that engrossing is in provisions being a licence or privilege allowed by the King for the sole buying and selling making working or using of any thing whatsoever whereby the subject in general is restrained from that liberty of manufacturing or trading which he had before These had been carried to an enormous height during the reign of Queen Elizabeth and were heavily complained of by Sir Edward Coke in the begining of the reign of King James the first but were in a great measure remedied by statute Jac I c which declares such monopolies contrary to law and void except as to patents not exceeding the grant of fourteen years to the authors of new inventions  It was owing as that very eminent lawyer very justly observes to the  enormous height  to which those royal grants were carried in the time of Elizabeth and James that the act of parliament passed against them It was owing also to the just resentment of the two houses of parliament against the violent stretch of the prerogative by which they rose to that height that they lost sight of the real object of that resentment falling into the absurdity of inserting a clause excepting  new inventions  in an act to restrain  monopolies  with which new inventions had nothing to do  For if a monopoly be only a licence or privilege for the sole buying selling making working or using of a thing whereby the subject in general is restrained from that liberty of manufacturing or trading  he had before  it is plain that the subject is  not  so restrained by any exclusive privilege granted to  the author of a new discovery produce invention or species of manufacture which the subject in general COULD NOT  manufacture  and in which of course he DID NOT  trade  before  In respect to the effects of exclusive privileges in  enriching  a  few  persons  impoverishing  others and keeping  multitudes poor  the circumstance is inseparable from new inventions discoveries and improvements Till it be determined good policy therefore for a nation not to encourage such inventions and improvements the private interest of individuals must necessarily give way to that of the public  Let us suppose that a  scientific  or even  practical  artist should invent a machine by means of which one man might be capable of doing the work of a thousand should not his invention be encouraged because a number of labourers would be to seek for employment It is hard no doubt for poor men who are as dull and uninventive as they are poor to be obliged at an advanced period of life to turn their hands to a species of labour to which they are not accustomed But this plea might be urged against almost all useful improvements whatever most of them tending to expedite mechanical operation and render manual labour cheap Hence machines to save or expedite such labour are encouraged in allwellgoverned states What indeed would be the consequence if in any one they were not Would not the neglected inventors of such machines repair to other states where they might meet with deserved encouragement And would not the state in which labour should be cheapest and manufactures most expeditiously fabricated have  caeteris paribus  the advantage of others at all foreign markets About sixty years ago if I mistake not application was made  to parliament for encouragement to certain individuals for erecting mills for the sawing of timber It was opposed by the petition of a numerous body of sawyers compassion for whose families prevented such encouragement then taking place We have been contented since to pay to the Dutch and other nations many hundred thousand pounds for the sawing of timber which they have earned by the same kind of mills that might otherwise been erected in this kingdom  The legislature indeed have of late years seen into this impolicy but tho' they indemnified Mr Dingley for what lie suffered by the indiscretion of the populace in destroying his saw mill at Limehouse they have not as yet thought it expedient to give sufficient encouragement for the erection of more  It is certain that upon every  new  invention or essential improvement in any species of manufacture the manufacturers in the  oldway  in that branch of business will be clamorous against an exclusive privilege being granted to the improver or inventor but should this have any weight with the legislature The dullest and most uninventive artisan in the world bearing the name of the same profession or occupation may thence claim aright to equal emoluments with the most expert and ingenious of his vocation but would it be either just or politic to admit his claim I have before hinted at the difference which nature itself hath made and of consequence sound policy should make between those who have  ingenuity  to  contrive  and those who have only  strength to labour  See page  The skillful cultivator or the ingenious artificer may be compared to the bee that extracts from the flowers of the field those mellifluous sweets of which drones and wasps would gladly partake when readymade But because drones and wasps would live like bees on honey are we therefore to rob the hives of the latter to give the former an equal share of the sweets of a manufacture they are not qualified to fabricate As the mere retailers of commodities ought not to grow rich by the labour of others so mere labourers ought to be kept poor that they may continue to be labourers  That they may be capable of labour also they should not be permitted to  starve  hence on every temporary revolution which new inventions in the mechanic arts necessarily occasion among our labouring artisans their relief should be provided for by the state either by giving a public reward to the authors of such inventions and making them common or by providing a temporary subsistence for such artisans till they can turn their hands to some other employment  We have a recent instance of a numerous industrious and useful body of artisans being hurt by a new ingenious and useful invention this is the method of bending timber for carriagewheels so that the periphery or rim which used to be composed of different sellies consists of one piece  The ingenious inventor hath it seems spent a considerable time and been at prodigious expence and trouble to bring his scheme to perfection and as he has obtained a patent for the exercise of it he may probably indemnify himself  and even reap some profit by it adequate to its merit In the mean time however the superior strength and lightness of the wheels of this manufacture giving them a preference to all others the common wheelwrights for the present labour under a hardship from which tho' they have a right to ask relief of the legislature they have none to complain of the inventor or of the exclusive privilege he enjoys by his patent Many instances of a similar nature might be pointed out amongst the ingenious artificers of this kingdom  I have indeed already observed that the bestowing of parliamentary premiums for discoveries and inventions whose utility is problematical is a very improper mode of encouraging ingenuity for the reasons then assigned  See page  Those reasons do not oppose the giving such premiums for inventions whose utility is publicly experienced  As to the pretext that grants of exclusive property or privilege in the exercise of new inventions tend to enhance the price of the newlyinvented manufactures it may be answered that as such grants do not compel any one to purchase these new manufactures the public are left at liberty at the lower price to encourage the  old  and this they will certainly do neglecting the  new  if their superiority of merit be not adequate to the advance of price  But it hath been said of patentees in particular that their privileges tend to throw advantages into the hands of foreigners who not being restricted by our patents can fabricate  and carry such new and improved manufactures to market cheapèr than our countrymen the patenteesWhen they who advance this objection can bring one single instance to corroborate their affection I shall think it merits a reply Till then I hold it sufficient to say in favour of patentees in general that as it is their interest to extend the use and sale of their commodities as much us possible it becomes their interest also to vend them as cheap as they can well be afforded At the same time it may not be improper to add that the sooner their patent or exclusive privilege of property expires the higher the price will they be induced to set on them whereas the longer the term of their privilege the cheaper can they afford and will therefore be induced to sell them  It will be objected perhaps for every trifling difficulty will be made an objection that if Artists and Artificers in general were put on the same footing as Authors and Engravers claiming an exclusive property in their new productions on the same easy terms of publication or entrance of their claim in some public office the pretenders to such claims would be so numerous and the pretended inventions of many so srivolous that it would give rise to endless vexatious suits and litigations But to this it may be replied that the increasing number of pretenders to new inventions would be a proof that the encouragement offered had answered the end of it by awakening the spirit of ingenuity and industry and would give ground to hope that out of so many pretenders some might deserve encouragement  As to those whose inventions were really new or whose improvements were essentially useful the point of right  would be soon settled  For it will hardly be pretended that the claim dependant on a precise mode of specification which is now secured by patent could not be equally as well secured by act of parliament I have indeed given an instance in which the right of the Engraver secured by Statute is admitted even by those who contest a similar right secured by patent See page  Whereas with such contrivances as were futile and frivolous the point of right would be soon found not worth contending for either by the invader or defender So that this kind of litigation would soon be at an end  At the same time the curiosity of Genius would be awakened its industry roused and the spirit of enterprize revived The ingenious though indigent artificer would not then be deterred from prosecuting a favourite and useful pursuit from the consideration that he could not raise money to purchase a patent should he succeed in his endeavours and that he was only racking his brains for the emolument of others A proper distinction would be then made between the  inventive artificer  and the  uninventive artisan  those who are qualified to employ others and those who are capable only to work themselves The respect due to each would be ascertained their due degree of encouragement pointed out and every branch of the arts and sciences flourish while the trunk would be nourished by being properly watered at the root  SECTION VII  On the restraint laid on the  KING'S PREROGATIVE  from giving encouragement to  USEFUL ARTISTS  I AM not to learn that exclusive privileges whether by parliamentary grant or royal prerogative are extremely unpopular or that they are particularly obnoxious to the penurious Great who instead of grudging the artificer the reward of his ingenuity should be the first most liberally to encourage it Unhappily indeed both for ingenuity and industry the superior privilege of being born to  do nothing  induces such highlyfavoured mortals to conceit that their inferiours were born to do for nothing every thing for them Hence the situation of industrious ingenuity at present reminds one of the state of slavery under which the Egyptians held the Israelites of old whom their insolent taskmasters required to make brick without furnishing them with straw  It hath been before observed that such privileges do not compel the public to purchase new manufactures there is therefore less reason for wealthy individuals to complain against them than artificers and traders whose private interest may be materially affected At the same time if we reflect that without the encouragement of such exclusive privileges no new inventions or improvements of any considerable consequence can be expected the opposing them is not less impolitic and absurd than illiberal and unjust  And yet notwithstanding all that may be both politically and equitably urged in behalf of giving a general parliamentary encouragement to new inventions and placing ingenious artists  of all kinds  on the same footing I am not without apprehensions that the policy of the times may be sound too pusilanimous to carry so salutary a measure into execution  But though neither reason nor justice should prevail so far as they ought I flatter myself with the hope that a power of  properly  and  readily  rewarding industrious ingenuity may be lodged somewhere  In other countries as it was in  this  before the passing the act against monopolies a discretionary power is placed in the hands of Government to give such encouragement by exclusive privileges for a term of years which may be renewed or extended according to the exigencies or peculiar merits of the case In England this power held universally elsewhere to be still inherent to the dignity of the sovereign was abridged by the Statute before mentioned of the st of James I It may not be improper therefore in this place to enquire a little into the motives and propriety of this abridgment of the Royal Prerogative With this view I shall beg leave to cite the following passage from Blackstone's Commentaries  "On the accession of King James I no new degree of royal power was added to or exercised by him but such a sceptre was too weighty to be wielded by such a hand The unreasonable and imprudent exertion of what was then deemed to be prerogative upon trivial and unworthy occasions and the claim of a more absolute power inherent in the kinglyoffice than had ever been carried into practice soon awakened  the sleeping lion The people heard with astonishment doctrines preached from the throne and the pulpit subversive of liberty and property and all the natural rights of humanity They examined into the divinity of this claim and found it weakly and fallaciously supported and common reason assured them that if it were of human origin no constitution could establish it without power of revocation no precedent could sanctify on length of time could confirm it The leaders felt the pulse of the nation and found they had ability as well as inclination to resist it and accordingly resisted and opposed it whenever the pusillanimous temper of the monarch had courage to put it to the trial and they gained some little victories in the cases of concealments MONOPOLIES and the dispensing power"  It appears from the above state of the case that this restraint on the king's prerogative was laid at a time when the people alarmed for their most essential and valuable privileges were in a state of hostility with the Crown of whose encroachments they were to the highest degree jealous and whose exertions of power they were determined on every occasion to oppose Their fears excited their passions heated and their resentinent roused against real injuries it is no wonder their discretion was not suffciently on its guard to prevent their encountering imaginary ones  Not that many of the royal monopolies then established were not injurious oppressive and deserving abolishment but they might and doubtless would at any other period have been abolished without depriving the prerogative of one of the brightest jewels of the Crown For such we may  justly term the power of patronizing ingenuity and promoting the arts of civil life  But the rage of reformation as I have before observed stifled the reflection that the exercise of  new inventions  were not  monopolies  in that sense which had thrown on the word an odium continued to this day The times however are altered and though new inventions remain destitute of proper encouragement we see monopolies of the most destructive tendency established by the combination and sometimes even the separate influence of opulent individuals not only without being countenanced by the crown but even directly contrary to the most express and positive acts of the legislature  Change of times will justify change of measures So far is the nation at present from hearing any  doctrines preached from the throne or the pulpit subversive of liberty property and the natural rights of humanity  as in the time of James I that we have not the least reason to apprehend an abuse of any additional power that may be restored to the crown respecting this part of its prerogative  Should it be judged therefore at present inexpedient to grant or be found through popular prejudice impracticable to obtain the general parliamentary encouragement abovementioned it is to be hoped the legislature will have no objection to repeal the clause in the aforesaid act of the st of James restricting the grants of the crown by patent to the term of fourteen years  Certain indeed it is that there are some pretended improvements and inventions so trivial and useless that their authors do not merit an exclusive privilege to exercise or profit by them a single day but this is far from being the case with  all  The term of fourteen years however is so short that few inventors chuse to ask for less and it is not at present in the power of the crown if any deserve it to grant more It is this circumstance which eventually and in fact prevents any distinction being made between the encouragement given to the most difficult expensive and important of such inventions and the most obvious insignificant and trivial  A number of instances might be particularized in which the grant of an exclusive right for fourteen years only is greatly inadequate and disproportional to the ingenuity labour expence and utility of such inventions but the legislature itself having acknowledged it by particular grants of premiums to inventors even after the expiration of the term of their patents it is presumed needless to insist farther on what is so manifestly expedient and equitable  In justice however to a most useful invention and the ingenious contriver of it I cannot forbear instancing Mr Hartley's expedient for preventing houses taking fire by lining the cielings with thin plates of iron a method so extremely simple and efficacious that one would imagine in a case of such necessity it need only to be seen to be adopted But if we reflect on the unaccountable security of inattention and indolence which every day's experience teaches us we shall not be inclined to wonder if fourteen or even forty years elapse before it come into sufficient use to make the inventor any compensation equal to its merit This gentleman therefore certainly deserves an exclusive privilege for a much longer term than fourteen years or a present parliamentary premium adequate to the importance and utility of his invention  How far what I have written may tend to excite  useful artists  to apply for redress or  induce the legislature to grant it time will determine but be the consequences what they may I lay down the pen well satisfied with having testified my inclination to promote the cause of industrious ingenuity and in that the general interests of my country  APPENDIX  Containing strictures on certain singular consequences attending the late decision on  LITERARY PROPERTY  AFTER the copious and masterly manner in which the subject of literary property hath been lately treated as well in the Court of Sessions in Scotland as in the House of Lords it may be deemed impertinent to think any farther animadversion necessary But a circumstance or two to which it was not the immediate business of the speakers to pay attention leading to consequences that appear strangely inconsistent with modern practice I am induced to take the present opportunity of noticing them  By the solemn decisions in the courts abovementioned denying the  perpettuiy  of such property and resting copyright merely on the statute the practice of the Court of Chancery in granting injunctions against pretended pirates and invaders of such property is materially affected  If authors have no foundation for copyright at commonlaw the proceedings in equity must be founded solely and strictly on the statute by which it does by no means appear that  abstracts abridgements  and  compilations  of which the greater number of the new books now published consist are at all contrary to law  It is to little purpose to determine whether literary property be  temporary or perpetual  unless the  nature  of that property  be also precisely determined In the works of original writers such as Shakespeare Milton c this property is sufficiently ascertained but for one original writer that appears in the republic of letters there are five hundred copyists and compilers Their number also of necessity encreases as books are multiplied nor can it well be otherwise unless all improvements in literature be precluded  Nil dictum quod non dictum prius  was said near two thousand years ago With how much more propriety therefore may it be said at present In historical writings and books of science of any extent originality cannot be pretended to and if compilations abstracts and epitomes are to be no longer allowed the papermills may stop the printingpress stand still and its numerous retainers be obliged literally to starve  It hath been long the custom in the Court of Chancery to grantinjunctions against the printers and publishers of historical and other compilations under the pretence of staying waste in consequence of which an injunction  ex parte  is granted by which the publication is stopped till after every studied delay of exception to the defendant's answer the complainant's bill is on hearing dismissed and the injunction dissolved when it is frequently impracticable to resume the publication and the author or bookseller is reduced to the necessity of sitting down with the loss attending an imperfect work with that of a procrastinated and litigious lawsuit into the bargain  The practice of the Court of Chancery teems with suits of this kind in which the complainant waves his right to such  damages as he might claim under the act of parliament although he often confessedly grounds his bill on that act applying in the first instance to the Chancellor to whose hands the decision of what is or is not securable property in every book is thus transferred  Another inconvenience still less attended to and more singular than the above arises from confining the right of literary property merely to the statute and this is that in such case this right itself being conditional  viz  depending on the entry of the book or pamphlet in the hall book of the Company of Stationers an author who does not comply with this condition the statutory  sine qua non  of his copyright can have no pretensions to such right at all So that an author hath in fact no copyright in an  unentered manuscript  which any person may therefore openly or surreptitiously copy publish for his own profit at pleasure Macklin the player some time since obtained an injunction and on a hearing got damages of Richardson the bookseller for printing and publishing part of the farce of  Love AlaMode  which the latter employed Gurney to take down at the theatre in shorthand But since the late decision in the House of Lords and the reference of copyright only to the  statute  I presume no such injunction in Chancery can be granted In what a predieament then stand the authors of unpublished manuscripts particularly our English Aristophanes Mr Foote several of whose performances are unpublished and it is necessary to the emoluments of his theatre that they should remain so Will it not be expedient for him and every other professor of unpublished manuscripts to enter  them without delay in the hallbook of the Company Or will indeed such entry without the actual printing and publication of the work suffice I cannot help thinking that some difficulty attends she solution of these questions  It is for these reasons hoped that as the legislature will probably find it expedient to make some farther alteration in the laws relating to literary property some farther regulation respecting the  security  of it will be deemed consistent with it's wisdom more precisely to determine the limits of its appropriation so that both writers and booksellers may know how far they are authorized to abridge copy or make quotations from the works of their predecessors without which they cannot safely exercise their calling and all improvements in works of  history philology  and  science  must speedily have an end  THE END
