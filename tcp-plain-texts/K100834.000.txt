Aristo∣tle began to be restored and studied in Italy when the pure and uncorrupted sources of antient poesy and antient criticism were opened and literature in general seemed emerging from the depths of Gothic ignorance and barbarity it might have been expected that instead of the ro∣mantic species of poetical composition introduced by the provencal bards a new and more legitimate taste of writing would have succeeded that unnatural events the machinations of imaginary beings and adventures entertaining only as they were improba∣ble would have given place to justness of thought and design and to that decorum which nature dictat∣ed and which the example and the precept of anti∣quity had authorised But it was a long time before such a change as this was effected and we find A∣riosto many years after the revival of letters reject∣ing  truth for magic and chusing rather to follow the irregular and ridiculous excursions of Boiardo than the propriety and uniformity of the great Graecian and Roman Epic models Nor was the state of cri∣ticism less generally and effectually influenced than that of poesy by the restoration of antient learning Beni one of the most celebrated critics of the six∣teenth century was still so infatuated with a love of the old provencal vein that he ventured to write a regular dissertation in which he compares Ariosto with Homer Trissino indeed who was nearly con∣temporary with Ariosto had taste and boldness enough to publish a poem written in profest imitation of the Iliad but this attempt met with little regard or ap∣plause for that very reason on which its real merit was founded it was rejected as an insipid and unen∣tertaining performance having few devils or enchant∣ments to recommend it To Trissino succeeded Tasso who in his Gierusaleme Liberata took the antients for his guides but was at the same time too sensible of the prevailing taste for ideal beings and romantic description to omit them entirely though he was well acquainted with and fully con∣vinced of the excellencies of Homer and Virgil yet he still kept the old provencal poets in his eye like his own Rinaldo who after he had gaz'd on the dia∣mond shield of truth and while he was departing from Armida and her enchanted gardens could not help looking back upon them with some remains of fondness Nor did Tasso's poem though compos'd in some measure on a classical and uniform plan gain its author in his own country at least any high∣er  share of praise and reputation upon that account Ariosto with all his extravagancies was still pre∣ferred and the superiority of the Orlando Furioso to the Gierusaleme Liberata was at length establish'd by a formal decree of the Academicians della Crusca who held a solemn court of enquiry concerning the merit of both poems  In the midst of this bad taste Spenser began to write his FAERIE QUEENE which after the prac∣tice of Ariosto was to consist of allegories enchant∣ments and romantic adventures carried on by fairy knights giants magicians and fictitious beings It may indeed be urged as an instance of Spenser's weak and undiscerning judgment that he chose to follow Ariosto rather than Tasso the plan and conduct of whose poem was much more regular and legitimate than that of his rival To this objection it may be answered in defence of our author that he was rea∣sonably induced to follow that poem which was most celebrated and popular for tho' the French critics in general gave the preference to Tasso yet in Italy the partisans on the side of Ariosto were by far the most numerous and consequently in England for Italy in the age of queen Elizabeth gave laws to our island in all matters of taste as France has done ever since It must however be confessed at the same time that Spenser was in some measure in∣fluenced from the natural biass of his mind to pre∣fer that plan which would admit of the most exten∣sive range for his unbounded imagination What this plan is and how it is conducted we shall now proceed to examine  See Spenser's letter to Sir W Raleigh c  The poet supposes that the FAERIE QUEENE held a magnificent feast according to annual custom which lasted twelve days on each of which respec∣tively twelve several complaints are preferred before her accordingly in order to redress the injuries which were the occasion of these several complaints she sends out twelve different knights each of which in the particular adventure allotted to him proves an example of some particular virtue as of Holiness Temperance Justice Chastity c and has one com∣plete book assigned to him of which he is the hero But besides these twelve knights severally exempli∣fying twelve moral virtues there is one principal knight or general hero viz PRINCE ARTHUR who represents Magnificence a virtue which is supposed to be the perfection of all the rest who assists in eve∣ry book the end of whose actions is to find out GLO∣RIANA or Glory and in whose person the poet in∣tends to pourtray  "THE IMAGE OF A BRAVE KNIGHT PERFECTED IN THE TWELVE PRIVATE MORAL VIRTUES"  It is evident that our author in establishing one hero who seeking and attaining one grand end viz GLORIANA or Glory should exemplify one grand character viz that of a brave knight perfected in the twelve private moral virtues had the practice of Virgil and Homer in his eye But tho' he was sensible of the importance and expediency of a unity of the hero and of his design yet he does not at the same time seem convinced of the necessity of that unity of action by which this design should be properly accomplished nor sufficiently acquainted with the method of pro∣ceeding  made use of by the two great originals above∣mentioned in conducting their respective heroes to the one grand end proposed It may be asked with great propriety how does ARTHUR execute this one grand ultimate design It may be answered with no less plausibility that by assisting each patron of the twelve virtues respectively in his allotted defence or patronage of each ARTHUR approaches still nearer and nearer to Glory 'till at last he obtains it and so consummates the intended grand design But surely to assist only is not sufficient to gain this end or com∣plete the proposed character The poet ought to have made his ARTHUR the principal agent in the re∣dress of each particular wrong which arose from the various violation of Holiness Temperance Justice Chastity c If the hero had thus in his own per∣son exerted himself in the service of all the twelve virtues he might have been deservedly stiled the per∣fect pattern of them all and consequently would then have completed the proposed grand end viz the attainment of Glory At present he is only a subordinate or rather accessory character the diffi∣culties and obstacles which he should have surmount∣ed in order to gain the proposed end are done to his hand and removed by others it is not he who con∣quers the dragon in the first book to instance in no other or who quells the magician Busirane in the third these are atchievements executed by St George and by Britomart In short the twelve several knights or patrons do too much for ARTHUR to do any thing or at least what may reasonably be expected from the plan of the poet while we are attending to  the design of the hero of the book we forget that of the hero of the poem Mr Dryden remarks  "We must do Spenser that justice to observe that mag∣nanimity magnificence which is the true cha∣racter of PRINCE ARTHUR shines throughout the whole poem and succours the rest when they are in distress"  Dedication to Juvenal  If the magnanimity of PRINCE AR∣THUR did in reality shine throughout the whole poem with a steady and superior lustre our author would stand excused but at present it breaks forth but seldom in dim and interrupted flashes it is not like the pervading spirit of Virgil which    Agitat molem magno se corpore miscet  Aen vi ver  And to  "succour the rest when they are in distress"  is a circumstance of too little importance in the hero of a poem "to succour" is in fact a service to be perform'd in the cause of the hero by some dependent and inferior chief the business of a Gyas or a Cloanthus a Mnestheus or a Serestus  Upon the whole and in general it must be ob∣served that Spenser's adventures which are the sub∣ject of each single book have no mutual dependance upon each other and consequenly do not contribute to constitute one legitimate poem and Mr Hughes not considering this has advanced a remark in com∣mendation of Spenser which may most properly be turned to his censure  "If we consider the first book as an entire work of itself we shall find it to be no irregular contrivance there is one principal action which is completed in the twelfth Canto and the  several incidents are proper as they tend either to obstruct or promote it"  Remarks on the Fairy Queen Hughes's edit of Spenser's works vol  As the heroic poem is required to be one WHOLE compounded of many various parts depending upon and relative to each other so it is expedient that not one of those parts should be so regularly contriv'd and so completely finished as to become a WHOLE of itself For the mind being thus once satisfied in arriving at the completion of an orderly series of events acquiesces in that satis∣faction and its attention and curiosity are diverted from pursuing with due vigour the final and general catastrophe whereas while each part is left imperfect I mean incomplete if disjoined or separated from the rest the mind still desirous and eager of gratify∣ing its expectations is irresistibly and imperceptibly drawn on from part to part till it receives a full and ultimate satisfaction from the accomplishment of one great event which all those parts following and il∣lustrating each other contributed to produce  Our author was probably aware that by consti∣tuting twelve several adventures for twelve several knights a want of continuity and general concatena∣tion of facts would be laid to his charge and upon this account I suppose he sometimes begins a story in one book the completion of which he defers not without much interruption to some future and di∣stant book a proceeding which unavoidably occa∣sions much confusion to the reader And it seems to be for the same reason that after one of the twelve knights has fulfilled the adventure of his book he in∣troduces  him in the next book acting perhaps in an inferior light and degraded to some less dangerous adventure a conduct which destroys that repose which the mind feels after having accompanied a hero thro' various distresses and difficulties to success and victory Besides when we view the hero entering upon an in∣ferior attempt our former admiration is diminish∣ed having seen him once nobly and decisively conquer we become so warmly interested in his ho∣nour that we look upon his engagement in any po∣sterior enterprise however successfully which is less arduous than that of which we had just before hail'd him the conqueror as derogatory to that glory which he had just acquired by such a conquest Spenser per∣haps would have embarassed himself and the reader less had he made every book one entire detached poem without any the least reference to the rest Thus he would have written twelve distinct poems in all of which he might have completed the pattern of a particular virtue in twelve knights respectively at present he has remarkably failed in endeavouring to represent all the virtues completed in the character of one The poet must either have established TWELVE KNIGHTS without an ARTHUR or an ARTHUR without TWELVE KNIGHTS Upon supposition that Spenser was resolved to characterise the twelve moral virtues the former plan perhaps would have been best the latter must necessarily want simplicity as it is an action consisting of twelve actions all equally great and unconnected between themselves and not an action consisting of one uninterrupted and coherent chain of incidents tending to the accomplish∣ment of one design  It has been observ'd before that our author endea∣voured to express the character of a knight perfected in the twelve moral virtues by representing him as assisting in the service or defence of each till at last he becomes possessed of all this plan however in∣judicious he certainly was obliged to observe but in the third book which is stiled the legend of Cha∣stity PRINCE ARTHUR doth not so much as lend his assistance in the protection or vindication of that virtue he appears indeed but not as an auxiliary in the adventure of the book  It must however be confessed that there is some∣thing artificial in the poet's manner of varying from historical precision a conduct which may be best il∣lustrated from his own words  "But because the be∣ginning of the whole work seemeth abrupt and as depending upon other antecedents it needs that ye know the occasion of these three knights several adventures For the method of a poet historical is not such as of an historiographer For an histo∣riographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were done accounting as well the times as the action but a poet thrusteth into the middest even where it most concerneth him and there re∣coursing to the things forepast and divining of things to come maketh a pleasing analysis of all The beginning therefore of my history were it to be told by an historiographer should be in the twelfth book which is the last where I devise that the FAERIE QUEENE held her annual feast twelve days upon which twelve several days the occasion of twelve several adventures hap∣pened  which being undertaken by twelve several knights are in these twelve books severally hand∣led and discoursed  Letter to Sir W Raleigh  It appears from this quotation that Spenser had finished but three books when this letter was writ∣ten  "  Thus according to this plan the reader would have been agreeably surprised in the last book when he came to discover that all the adventures which he had just gone through were un∣dertaken at the command of the FAERIE QUEENE and that all the knights had severally set forward to the execution of them from her annual birthday festi∣val but Spenser in most of his books has inju∣diciously forestalled the first of these particulars which certainly should have been concealed till the last book not only to have prevented a needless repe∣tition of the same thing but that he might likewise secure an opportunity to himself of amusing the read∣er's mind with a circumstance new and unexpected  But notwithstanding the plan and conduct of our author in the poem before us is highly excep∣tionable yet I am apt to think that the FAERIE QUEENE is not upon the whole so confused and irregular as the Orlando Furioso Though there is no general unity in the former yet if we consider every book or adventure as a separate poem we shall meet with so many distinct however imperfect uni∣ties by which means the reader is less bewildered than by that general indigested medley of which the former totally consists and in which we meet with neither partial nor universal unity    Cum nec pes nec caput  UNI  Reddatur  FORMAE  Hor art poet v  The very idea of celebrating the MADNESS of an hero carries with it somewhat extravagant and absurd Or∣lando doth not make his appearance till b where he is placed in a situation not very heroic he is first discovered to us in bed desiring to sleep His ulti∣mate design is to find Angelica but his pursuit of her is broken off in b after which there are sixteen more books to come and in which Angelica disappears Other heroes are likewise engaged in the same pursuit After reading the first stanza of b one would be inclined to think that the subject of the poem was the expedition of the Moors into France under their emperor Agramante to fight against Charlemayne but this matter is the least part of the poem In fact many of the knights perform exploits equal if not superior to those of Orlando and particularly Rogero with a grand atchievement of wholn the poem is closed viz his killing Rodo∣mont but this event is not the completion of a story carried on principally through the whole work The author passes from one incident to another and from region to region whether it be from England to the Hesperides or from the earth to the moon with such incredible swiftness and rapidity that one would think he was mounted upon his own winged steed Ippogrifo He begins a tale of a knight in Europe and suddenly breaks it off to resume the unfinished catastrophe of another in Asia The imagination of the reader is not so much involv'd in as it is oppressed with the mul∣tiplicity of stories in the relation of each of which the poet is at the same time equally engaged To reme∣dy this inconvenience it was thought proper to affix  in some of the editions marginal hints informing the reader in what book and stanza the poet would recom∣mence some interrupted episode an expedient not more inartificial than that which the first painters were obliged to make use of in order to assist their want of skill who having drawn the figure of a man a bird or a quadruped found it necessary to write under∣neath the name of the kind to which the thing repre∣sented belonged However this method has been the means of giving the reader a clear comprehension of Ariosto's tales which otherwise he could not have obtained without much difficulty This poet is sel∣dom read twice in order that is by passing from the first canto to the second and from the second to the rest successively but by persuing without any regard to the order of the books or the stanzas the different stories which though all somewhere finish'd yet are at present so mutually interwoven that the incidents of one are perpetually clashing with those of another The ingenious Abbé Du Bos  Reflexions c c  observes hap∣pily enough that  "Homer is a geometrician in comparison of Ariosto"  And indeed his mis∣cellaneous matter cannot be better expressed than by the two first verses of his Exordium  Le Donne i Cavallier l'arme gli amori  Le Cortesie l'audaci imprese io canto  C i S  Of dames of knights of armes of love's delight  Of courtesies of high attempts I sing  Harrington  But to return Though the FAERIE QUEENE does not exhibit that oeconomy of plan and exact arrange∣ment  of parts which Epic severity requires yet we scarcely regret the loss of these while their place is so amply supplied by something which more powerfully attracts us as it engages the affection of the heart rather than the applause of the head and if there be any poem whose graces please be∣cause they are situated beyond the reach of art and where the faculties of creative imagination delight us because they are unassisted and unrestrained by those of deliberate judgment it is in this of which we are now speaking To sum up all in a few words tho' in the FAERIE QUEENE we are not satisfied as critics yet we are transported as readers  SECT II Of Spenser's Imitations from old Romances  ALthough Spenser formed his FAERIE QUEENE upon the fanciful plan of Ariosto as I remark∣ed in the preceding section yet it must be confessed that the adventures of Spenser's knights are a more exact and immediate copy of those which we meet with in old romances or books of chivalry than they are of those of which the Orlando Furioso consists Ariosto's knights exhibit very surprising instances of their prowess and atchieve many heroic actions but our author's knights are more particularly engaged in revenging injuries and doing justice to the distressed which was the proper business and ultimate end of the antient knighterrantry And thus though many of Spenser's incidents and expedients are to be found in Ariosto such as that of blowing a horn at the sound  of which the gates of a castle fly open of the vanish∣ing of an enchanted palace or garden after some knight has destroyed the enchanter and the like yet these are not more peculiarly the property of Ario∣sto than they are common to all antient romances in general Spenser's first book is indeed a regular and precise imitation of such a series of action as we frequently meet with in books of chivalry For in∣stance a king's daughter applies to a knight that he would relieve her father and mother who are closely confined to their castle upon account of a vast and terrible dragon that had ravaged their country and perpetually laid in wait to destroy them The knight sets forward with the lady encounters a monster in the way is plotted against by an enchanter and after surmounting a variety of difficulties and obstacles arrives at the country which is the scene of the dra∣gon's devastations kills him and is presented to the king and queen whom he has just delivered mar∣ries their daughter but is soon obliged to leave her on account of fulfilling a former vow It may be likewise observed that the circumstance of each of Spenser's twelve knights setting out from one place by a different way to perform a different adventure exactly resembles that of the seven knights proceed∣ing forwards to their several expeditions in the wellknown romance entitled the Seven Champions of Christendom In fact these miraculous books were highly fashionable and that chivalry which was the subject of them was still practiced in the age of queen Elizabeth  See Hollingshead's Chronicles vol iii p  Among others there is one romance which Spen∣ser seems more particularly to have made use of It is entitled MORTE ARTHUR  The Lyf of Kyng Arthur of his noble Knyghtes of the round table and in thende the dolorous deth of them all  This was translated into English from the French by one Sir Thomas Maleory Knight and printed by W Caxton  This Book has been reprinted twice or thrice The last Edition is dated  From this fabulous history our author has borrow'd many of his names viz Sir Tristram Placidas Pelleas Pellenore Percivall and others As to Sir Tristram he has copied from this book the circumstances of his birth and education with much exactness Spenser in∣forms us that Sir Tristram was born in Cornwall c  And Tristram is my name the only heire  Of good king Meliogras which did raigne  In Cornewaile    And afterwards  The countrie wherein I was bred    The which the fertile Lionesse is hight  ibid St  Which particulars are drawn from the romance abovemention'd  "There was a knight Meliodas Meliogras and he was lord and king of the country of Lyonesand he wedded king Markes sister of Cornewale"  The issue of which mar∣riage as we are afterwards told was Sir Tristram  Book ii chap i    Mention is then made in our romance of Sir Tri∣stram's banishment from Lyones into a distant country by the advice and under the conduct of a wise and learned counsellor named Governale A circumstance alluded to by Spenser in these verses  So taking counsel of a wise man red  She was by him adviz'd to send me quight  Out of the countrie wherein I was bred  The which the fertile Lionesse is hight    Sir Tristram's education is thus describ'd below  St  All which my dayes I have not lewdly spent  Nor spilt the blossom of my tender yeares  In ydlesse but as was convenient  Have trained bene with many noble feres  In gentle thewes and such like semely leres  'Mongst which my most delight has always beene  To hunt the savage chace among my peres  Of all that raungeth in the forest greene  Of which none is to me unknowne that e'er was seene  XXXII  Ne is there hawke that mantleth her on pearch  Whether hightowring or accoasting lowe  But I the measure of her flight do search  And all her pray and all her dyet knowe  Which is agreeable to what is said in the romance After mention being made of Tristram's having learn∣ed  the language of France courtly behaviour and skill in chivalry we have the following passage  "As he growed in might and strength he laboured ever in hunting and hawking so that we never read of no gentleman more that so used himselfe thereinAnd he began good measures of blowing of blasts of ve∣nery hunting and chase and of all manner of ver∣meins and all these termes haves we yet of hawking and hunting and therefore the booke of venery of hawking and hunting is called THE BOOKE OF SIR TRISTRAM  Book ii chap  "  And in another place King Arthur thus addresses Sir Tristram  "For of all manner of hunting thou bearest the prise and of all measures of blowing thou art the beginner and of all the termes of hunting and hawking ye are the begin∣ner  B ii c  "  From this romance our author also took the hint of his BLATANT BEAST which is there call'd the QUESTING BEAST  "Therewithall the King saw comming towards him the strangest beast that ever he saw or heard tell offAnd the noyse was in the beasts belly like unto the  Questyn  of thirtie couple of houndes"  The QUESTING BEAST is afterwards more particularly described  "That had in shap an head like a serpent's head and a body like a liberd buttocks like a lyon and footed like a hart and in his body there was such a noyse as it had been the noyse of thirtie couple of houndes  Questyn  and such a noyse that beast made where∣soever he went"  B ii c  Spenser has made him a much  more monstrous animal than he is here represented to be and in general has varied from this description though there is one circumstance in Spenser's repre∣sentation in which there is a resemblance vizspeaking of his mouth  And therein were a thousand tongues empight  Of sundry kindes and sundry qualities  Some were of dogs that barked night and day  And some c    So dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray    By what has been hitherto said perhaps the reader may not be persuaded that Spenser in his BLATANT BEAST had the QUESTING BEAST of our romance in his eye but the poet has himself taken care to in∣form us of this for we learn from the romance that certain knights of the round table were destined to pursue the QUESTING BEAST perpetually without success which Spenser hints at in these lines  Albe that long time after Calidore  The good Sir Pelleas him tooke in hand  And after him Sir Lamoracke of yore  And all his brethren borne in Britaine land  Yet none of these could ever bring him into band    Sir Lamoracke and Sir Pelleas are two very valour∣ous champions of Arthur's round table  This romance likewise supplied our author with the story of the mantle made of the beards of knights and locks of ladies which last circumstance is added by Spenser  For may no knight or ladie passe along  That way and yet they needs must passe that way  By reason of the streight and rocks among  But they that ladies lockes do shave away  And that knights berd for toll which they for passage pay    Afterwards  His name is Crudor who through high disdaine  And proud despyght of his selfepleasing mynd  Refused hath to yeald her love againe  Untill a mantle she for him do find  With berds of knights and lockes of ladies lynd    Thus in MORTE ARTHUR  "Came a messengersaying that king Ryence had discomfited and overcomen eleaven knights and everiche of them did him homage and that was this they gave him their beards cleane flayne of as much as there was wherefore the messenger came for king Ar∣thur's berd for king Ryence had purfeled a man∣tell with king's beards and there lacked for one place of the mantell Wherefore he sent for his berd or else hee would enter into his lands and brenn and sley and never leave till he have thy  head and beard"  B c  After this passage we have an  This is also printed in P Enderbury's CAM∣BRIA TRIUMPHANS p  antient ballad the subject of which is this insolent demand of king Ryence Drayton in his Poly∣olbion speaks of a coat composed of the beards of kings he is celebrating king Arthur  As how great Rithout's self he slew in his repair  And ravisht Howel's niece young Helena the fair  And for a trophie brought the giant's coat away  Made of the beards of kings  Song  But Drayton in these lines manifestly alludes to a passage in Geoffrey of Monmouth who informs us that a Spanish giant named Ritho having forcibly conveyed away from her guard Helena the niece of duke Hoel possessed himself of St Michael's Mount in Cornwall from whence he made frequent sallies and committed various outrages that at last king Arthur conquered this giant and took from him a certain coat which he had been composing of the beards of kings a vacant place being left for king Arthur's beard  Orig Gest Reg Brit B  As Spenser has copied many other fictions from MORTE ARTHUR I apprehend that he drew this from thence and not from Geoffrey of Monmouth not to mention that Spenser's circumstances tally more exactly with those in the romance  There is great reason to conclude not only from what has already been mention'd concerning Spenser's imitations from this romantic history of king Arthur and his knights but from some circum∣stances which I shall now produce that it was a favo∣rite and reigning romance about the age of queen Elizabeth or at least one very well known and much read at that time Spenser in the Shepherd's Calen∣dar has the following passage  And whither rennes this bevie of ladies bright  Raunged in a row  They been all LADIES OF THE LAKE behight  That unto her go  Aprill  Upon the words LADIES OF THE LAKE E K the old commentator on the pastorals has the follow∣ing remark  "LADIES OF THE LAKE be nymphes for it was an old opinion among the antient Hea∣thens that of every spring and fountaine was a goddesse the soveraine which opinion stucke in the minds of men not many years since by meanes of certain fine fablers or loose lyers such as were the authors of KING ARTHUR the greatWho tell many an unlawfull leesing of the LADIES OF THE LAKE"  These fine fablers or loose lyers are the authors of the romance abovemention'd viz MORTE ARTHUR where many miracles are brought about and much enchantment is carried on by the means and interposition of the LADY OF THE LAKE Now  it should be observed that the LADY OF THE LAKE was introduc'd to make part of queen Elizabeth's en∣tertainment at Kenelworth as an evidence of which I shall produce a passage from an antient book entit∣led  "A letter wherein part of the entertainment un∣too the queens majesty at Killingworthcastl in Warwicksheer in this soomers progress is signified"  The passage is this  "Her highness all along this tiltyard rode unto the inner gate next the baze coourt of the castle whear the LADIE OF THE LAKE famous in KING ARTHUR'S BOOK with too nymphes wayting upon her ar∣rayed all in sylkes attended her highnes comming from the midst of the pool whear upon a move∣able island brightblazing with torches she floting to land met her majesty with a wellpenned meter and matter after this sorte first of the auncientee of the castl who had been owners of the same e'en till this day most allways in the handes of the earles of Leycester how she had kept this lake syns king Arthur's dayes and now understand∣ing of her highnes hither comming thought it both offis and duety to discover in humble wise her and her estate offring up the same hir lake and power thearin with promis of repair to the court It pleas'd her highnes to thank this lady c"  Gascoyne  Works London  in a little narrative called the  "Prince∣ly Pleasures of Kenelworth Castle"  gives us some of the abovemention'd metre written by Ferrers  one of the contributors to the mirror of magistrates of which these may serve as a specimen  I am the lady of this pleasant lake  Who since the time of great king Arthur's reigne  That here with royall court aboade did make  Have led a lowring life in restless paine  'Till now that this your third arrival here  Doth cause me come abroad and boldly thus appeare  For after him such stormes this castle shook  By swarming Saxons first who scourgde this land  As forth of this my poole I neer durst looke c  She is afterwards introduc'd complaining to the queen that sir Bruse had insulted her for doing an injury to Merlin an incident related in MORTE ARTHUR and that he would have put her to death had not Neptune deliver'd her by concealing her in that lake from which confinement the queen is after∣wards suppos'd to deliver her c  Without expatiating upon the nature of such a royal entertainment as this I shall observe from it that the LADY OF THE LAKE and consequently the romance which supply'd this fiction was a very po∣pular character in the reign of queen Elizabeth and we may add that it is not improbable that Spenser might allude in the abovecited verses to some of the circumstances in this part of the queen's entertainment for queen Elisabeth the Fayre Elisa is the lady whom the LADIES OF LAKE are represented as repairing to  in that eclogue  Spenser's pastorals were published about four years after this entertainment  Nor is it improbable that this lady was often exhibited upon other occasions Nor is it improper to remark in this place that Ben Johnson has introduced her together with king Arthur and Mer∣lin in an entertainment before the court of James I called PRINCE HENRIES BARRIERS  The above antient letter acquaints us that the queen was entertain'd with a song from this romance which is another proof of it's popularity at that time  "A minstrall came forth with a sollem song warrant∣ed for story out of king Arthur's acts the first book whereof I gat a copy and that is this  "So it fell out on a pentecost day  "When king Arthur c"  This is the song above hinted at where mention is made of king Rience demanding the beard of king Arthur In the same letter a gentleman who shew'd some particular feats of activity before the queen is said to be  "very cunning in fens and hardy as Gawen"  Which Gawen was king Arthur's ne∣phew and whose atchievements are highly celebrat∣ed in MORTE ARTHUR  We find Spenser in another place alluding to the fable of the lady of the lake so much spoken of in this romance  A little while  Before that Merlin dyde he did intend  A brasen wall in compas to compyle  About Cairmardin and did it commend  Unto these sprights to bring to perfect end  During which time the LADIE OF THE LAKE  Whom long he lov'd for him in haste did send  Who therefore forst his workmen to forsake  Them bound till his returne their labour not to slake    X  In the meane time thro' that false ladies traine  He was surpris'd and buried under beare  Ne ever to his worke return'd againe  These verses are obscure unless we consider the fol∣lowing relation in MORTE ARTHUR  "The LADY OF THE LAKE and Merlin departed and by the way as they went Merlin shewed to her many wonders and came into Cornewaile And alwaies Merlin lay about the ladie for to have her favour and she was ever passing wery of him and faine would have been deliver'd of him for she was afraid of him because he was a divells son and she could not put him away by no meanes And so upon a time it hapned that Merlin shewed to her in a roche rock whereas was a great wonder and wrought by enchauntment which went under a stone so by her subtile craft and working she made Merlin to go under that stone to let him wit of the marvailes there But she wrought so  there for him that he came never out for all the craft that he could doe"  B i c  Our author has taken notice of a superstitious tra∣dition which is related at large in this romance  Good Lucius  That first received christianitie  The sacred pledge of Christs evangelie  Yet true it is that long before that day  Hither came Joseph of Arimathie  Who brought with him the HOLY GRAYLE they say  And preacht the truth but since it greatly did decay    The HOLY GRAYLE that is the real blood of our blessed Saviour What Spenser here writes GRALE is often written SANGREAL or  St grale  in MORTE AR∣THUR and is there said to have been brought into England by Joseph of Arimathea Many of king Arthur's knights are there represented as going in quest or in search of the SANGREAL or SANGUIS REALIS This expedition was one of the first subjects of the old romance  This romance seems to have extended its reputation beyond the reign of queen Elizabeth B Johnson besides his allusion to it in the LADY OF THE LAKE mention'd above hints at it more than once  Had I compil'd from Amadis de Gaule  Th'Esplandians ARTHURS Palmerins c  An execration upon Vulcan in the Underwood  And afterwards in the same poem  The whole summe  Of errant knighthood with the dames and dwarfes  The charmed boates and the enchanted wharfes  The TRISTRAMS LANC'LOTTS c  And Camden  REMAINS printed Artic names  refers to this history of king Arthur as to a book familiarly known to the readers of his age Speaking of the name TRISTRAM he observes  "I know not whether the first of this name was christned by king Arthur's fabler"  Again of LAUNCELOT he speaks  "Some think it to be no ancient name but forged by the writer of king Arthur's history for one of his douty knights"  and of GAWEN  "A name devised by the author of king Arthur's table"  To this we may add that Milton manifestly hints at it in the following lines  Damsels met in forrests wide  By knights of Logris or of Lyones  Lancelot Pelleas or Pellenore  Par Reg B ii v  These are Sir Lancelot or Sir Meliot of Logris Sir Tristram of Lyones and king Pellenore who are  often mention'd in MORTE ARTHUR and repre∣sented as meeting beautiful damsels in desolate for∣rests and probably he might have it in his eye when he wrote the following as the round table is express∣ly hinted at  Siquando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges  Arturumque etiam sub terris bella moventem  Aut dicam  INVICTAE  sociali faedere  MENSAE  Magnanimos Heroas    MANSUS  To which we may subjoin  What resounds  In fable or romance of Uther's son  Begirt with British and Armoric knights  Parad Lost v  Before I leave this romance I must observe that Ariosto has been indebted to it I do not mean to the old translation which Spenser made use of He has drawn his enchanter Merlin from it and in these verses refers to a particular story concerning him quoted above Bradamante is suppos'd to visit the tomb of Merlin  Questa è l'antica e memorabil grotta  Ch' edificò Merlino il savio mago  Che forse recordare odi tal'hotta  Dove inganollo la  DONNA DEL LAGO  Il sepolcro è qui giu dove corotta  Di satisfare a lei che gliel suase  Giace la carne sua dove egli vago  Vivo corcossi e morto ci rimase  C  Thus translated by Harrington  Heere is the tombe that Merlin erst did make  By force of secret skill and hidden art  In which sometimes the lady of the lake  That with her beauty had bewitcht his hart  Did force him enter fondly for her sake  And he was by a woman overreached  That unto others prophesied and preached  XII  His carkas dead within this stone is bound  This description of Merlin's tomb says Harrington in a marginal note is out of the BOOK OF KING AR∣THUR Ariosto has transferr'd the tomb from Wales into France He afterwards feigns that the prophe∣tical sculpture in Malagigi's cave was perform'd by Merlin's enchantment  Merlino il savio incantator Britanno  Fe for la fonte al tempo dil re Arturo  E di cose ch'al mondo hanno a venire  La fe da buoni artefici scolpire  C  XXXV  These whose names appear  In marble pure did never live as yet  But long time hence after six hundred yeare  To their great praise in princely throne shall sit  Merlin the English prophet plast them here  In Arthurs time  Harrington  He also mentions some of the names of the knights of our romance when Renaldo comes into GreatBri∣tain the poet celebrates that island for its atchieve∣ments in chivalry and as having produc'd many brave knights  Tristano  Lancillotto Galasso Artu e Galuano  C S  Afterwards in b Tristram makes a great figure From this romance is also borrow'd Ariosto's tale  C  of the enchanted cup which in Caxton's old transla∣tion is as follows  "By the way they met with a knight that was sent from Morgan le Faye to king Arthur and this knight had a faire horne all gar∣nished with gold and the horne had such a virtue that there might no ladie or gentlewoman drink of that horne but if shee were true to her husband and if shee were false shee should spill all the drinke and if shee were true unto her lord shee might drink peaceably c"  B c  Afterwards many tryals are made with this cup The inimitable Fon∣taine has newmoulded this story from Ariosto under the title of  La coupe enchanteé  As it is manifest from a comparison of passages that Ariosto was very con∣versant  in this romance so I think it may be granted that he drew the idea of his Orlando running mad with jealousy from it In MORTE ARTHUR Sir Lancelot out of a jealous fit is driven to madness in which state he continues for the space of two years perform∣ing a thousand ridiculous pranks no less extravagant than those of Orlando and like him at length he recovers his senses  I had forgot to remark before that our author has borrow'd the name of Materasta's castle from that of Lancelot in MORTE ARTHUR  the goodly frame  And stately port of CASTLE JOYEOUS    Lancelot's castle is styl'd JOYOUS GARD or castle  There is another antient romance for so it may be called though it is written in verse which Spenser apparently copies in prince Arthur's combat with the dragon it will be necessary to transcribe the whole passage  It fortuned as faire it then befell  Behind his back vnweeting where he stood  Of auncient time there was a springing well  From which fast trickled forth a siluer flood  Full of great vertues and for med'cine good  Whylome before that cursed dragon got  That happy land and all with innocent blood  Defil'd those sacred waves it rightly hot  The well of life ne yet his vertues had forgot  For unto life the dead it could restore  And guilt of sinful crimes cleane wash away  Those that with sicknesse were infected sore  It could recure and ages long decay  Renew as it were borne that very day  Both Silo this and Iordan did excell  And th'English bath and eke the German Spau  Ne can Cephise nor Hebrus match this well  Into the same the knight backe overthrowen fell  Now gan the golden Phoebus for to steepe  His fierie face in billowes of the west  And his faint steeds watred in Ocean deep  Whiles from their iournall labours they did rest  When that infernall monster hauing kest  His weary foe into that liuing well  Gan high advaunce his broad discoloured brest  Aboue his wonted pitch with countenance fell  And clapt his iron wings as victor he did dwell  Which when his pensiue lady saw from farre  Great woe and sorrow did her soule assay  As weening that the sad end of the warre  And gan to highest God entirely pray  That feared chance from her to turne away  With folded hands and knees full lowely bent  All night she watcht ne once adowne would lay  Her dainty limbs in her sad dreriment  But praying still did wake and waking did lament  The morrow next gan early to appeare  That Titan rose to runne his daily race  But early ere the morrow next gan reare  Out of the sea faire Titans deawy face  Vp rose the gentle virgin from her place  And looked all about if she might spy  Her loued knight to moue his manly pase  For shee had great doubt of his safety  Since late she saw him fall before his enemy  At last she saw where he vpstarted braue  Out of the well wherein he drenched lay  As Eagle fresh out of the Ocean waue  Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray  And deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay  Like eyas hauke vp mounts vnto the skies  His newlybudded pineons to assay  And marvailes at himself still as he flies  So new this newborne knight to battell new did rise  Whom when the damned fiend so fresh did spy  No wonder if he wondred at the sight  And doubted whether his late enemy  It were or other new supplied knight  He now to prove his late renewed might  High brandishing his bright deawburning blade  Vpon his crested scalpe so sore did smite  That to the scull a yawning wound it made  The deadly dint his dulled senses all dismaid  I wote not whether the reuenging steele  Were hardned with that holy water dew  Wherein he fell or sharper edge did feele  Or his baptized hands now greater grew  Or other secret vertue did ensew  Else never could the force of fleshly arme  Ne molten metall in his bloud embrew  For till that stound could never wight him harme  By subtiltie nor sleight nor might nor mighty charme    This miraculous manner of healing our author drew from an old poem entitled Sir Bevis of Southampton viz  "What for weary and what for faint  "Sir Bevis was neere attaint  "The dragon followed on Bevis so hard  "That as he would have fled backward  "There was a well as I weene  "And he stumbled right therein  "Then was Sir Bevis afraid and woe  "Lest the dragon should him sloe  "Or that he might away passe  "When that he in the well was  "Then was the well of such vertu  "Through the might of Christ Jesu  "For sometime dwelled in that land  "A virgin full of Christes sand  "That had been bathed in that well  "That ever after as men can tell  "Might no venomous worme come therein  "By the virtue of that virgin  "Nor nigh it seven foot and more  "Then Bevis was glad therefore  "When he saw the Dragon fell  "Had no power to come to the well  "Then was he glad without faile  "And rested awhile for his availe  "And drank of the water of his fill  "And then he leapt out of the well  "And with Morglay his brand  "Assailed the Dragon I understand  "On the Dragon he strucke so fast c  After which the Dragon strikes the knight with such violence that he falls into a swoon and tumbles as it were lifeless into the well by whose sovereign virtue he is reviv'd  "When Bevis was at the ground  "The water made him whole and sound  "And quenched all the venim away  "This well saved Bevis that day  And afterwards  "But ever when Bevis was hurt sore  "He went to the well and washed him thore  "He was as whole as any man  "And ever as fresh as when he began  It may be observ'd that this poem of Sir Bevis is written in that short measure which was frequently sung to the harp in queen Elizabeth's time a custom which descended from the antient bards The author of the arte of English poesie printed thus speaks of it  "So on the other side doth the overbusie and too speedy returne of one manner of tune too much annoy and as it were glut the eare unless it be in small and popular musickes song by these cantabanqui upon benches and barrels heads where they have none other audience than boyes or country fellowes that passe by them in the streete or else by blind harpers or such like taverneminstrels that give a fit of mirth for a groat and their matters being for the most part stories of old time as the tale of Sir Topas the Reportes of Bevis of Southampton Guy of Warwicke Adam Bell and Clymme of the Clough and such other old romances or historicall Rhymes made purposely for re∣creation of the common people at Christmasse diners and bri∣deales and in tavernes and alehouses and such other places of base resort also they be us'd in carols and rounds and such light or lascivious poemes which are commonly more commodiously uttered by these buffoons and VICES in plays than by any other person such were the rimes of Skelton usurping the name of a poet laureate being in deede but a rude rayling rimer and all his doings ridiculous he used both short distaunces and short measures pleasing only the popular eare in our courtly MAKER we banish them utterly"  B ii c  Hence it appears that Chaucer was at that time sung to the harp for the tale or rime of Sir Thopas is a poem of Chaucer now extant so the Italians at present sing Tasso and Ariosto Adam Bell and Clym of the Clough were two famous archers the former of which is on that account alluded to by Shakespeare  The same author in another place speaks of this kind of enter∣tainment by which one would think that it was not always confin'd to such a vulgar audience  "We ourselves who compiled this treatise have written for pleasure a little brief romance or histo∣rical ditty in the English tong of the isle of GreatBritaine in short and long meeters and by breaches or divisions to be more commodiously sung to the harpe in places of assembly where the company shall be desirous to hear of old adventures and va∣liaunces of noble knights in times past as are those of king Ar∣thur and his knights of the round table Sir Bevys of Southamp∣ton Guy of Warwicke and such other like"  B i c  The circumstance of the Dragon not being able to approach within seven feet of this well is imitated by our author St below where another water is men∣tioned which in like manner preserves the knight  "But nigh thereto the everdamned beast  "Durst not approache for he was mortal made  "And all that life preserved did detest  "Yet he it oft adventur'd to invade  Tho' we feel somewhat of an illnatur'd pride and a disingenuous triumph in having detected the latent and obscure source from whence an admired and ori∣ginal author has drawn some favorite and celebrated description yet it must be confess'd that this is soon overwhelmed by a generous and exalted pleasure which naturally flows from contemplating the chymi∣cal energy of true genius which can produce so won∣derfull a transmutation and whose virtues are not less potent efficacious and vivifying in their nature than those of the miraculous water here described  It should be mention'd in this place that Spenser in his Dragonencounters follows the incidents made use of by the romancewriters with all the punctuality of a close copyist  As to Spenser's original and genealogy of the Fairy nation I am induc'd to believe that part of it was supply'd by his own inexhaustible imagination and part by some fabulous history He tells us B ii c S that man as first made by Prometheus was called ELFE who wandring through the world at last arriv'd at the gardens of Adonis where he found a female whom he called FAY that the issue of these two were called Fairies who soon grew to be a mighty people and conquer'd all nations That their eldest son Elfin govern'd America and the next to him named Elfinan founded the city of Cleopo∣lis which was enclos'd with a golden wall by Elfiline That his son Elfine overcome the Gobbelines but that of all Fairies Elfant was most renowned who built Panthea of CrystallTo these succeeded Elfar who kill'd two brethrengiants and to him Elfinor who built a bridge of glass over the sea the sound of which was like thunder At length Elficleos rul'd the Fairy land with much wisdom and highly en∣creas'd its honour he left two sons the eldest of which fair Elferon died an immature death and whose place was supply'd by the mighty Oberon whose wide memorial continues our author still re∣mains and who dying left Tanaquil to succeed him by will who is likewise called Glorian or GLORIANA  In the circumstance of Elfinel who overcame the Gobbelines he plainly alludes to the faction of the Guelfes and Gibbelines in Italy and his friend and commentator E K remarks  Eclogue June  that our Elfes and  Goblins were deriv'd from those two parties Guelfes and Gibelines But in the latter part of this relation under the fictitious names of these ideal beings he has adumbrated some of our English princes Elficleos is king Henry VII whose eldest son Arthur died at sixteen years of age and whose youngest son Oberon that is Henry VIII succeeded to the crown marry∣ing about the same time his brother Arthur's wi∣dow the princess Katherine which is what Spenser more particularly hints at in these lines  Whose emptie place the mighty Oberon  Doubly supply'd in SPOUSALL and DOMINION  St  The same of this king was very recent in our au∣thor's age  It is remarkable that Spenser says nothing of Ed∣ward VI and queen Mary who reigned between Henry VIII and queen Elizabeth but that he passes immediately from Oberon to Tanaquill or GLORI∣ANA i e queen Elizabeth who was excluded from her right by those two intermediate reigns  He dying left the fairest Tanaquill  Him to succeed there by his last will  Fairer and nobler liveth none this howre  St  And the reader may observe that there is much ad∣dress and art in the poet's manner of making this o∣mission There is so much confusion in Spenser's  series of this fairy people that it is difficult to deter∣mine whether or no he has here allegorised any o∣ther English reign However in Elfant who laid the foundation of Cleopolis he may signify king Lud as it appears by another place that Cleopolis is London  Till now said then the knight I weened well  That great Cleopolis where I have been  In which the fairest FAERIE QUEENE doth dwell  The fairest FAERIE QUEENE is queen Elizabeth and by the lines that immediately follow it should seem that Panthea is the queen's palace  The fairest citie was that might be seene  And that bright towr all built of crystall cleene  PANTHEA    But this idea of the crystall tower and of the gold∣en wall and bridge of glass c mention'd above seem to be some romantic tradition As to his FAE∣RIE QUEENE the notion of such a personage was very common Chaucer in his Rime of Sir Thopas speaks of her together with a fairy land and Shake∣spere who was universally conversant in popular su∣perstition has introduc'd her in his Midsummer∣night's Dream She was suppos'd to have held her court in the highest magnificence in the days of king Arthur a circumstance by which the happiness of that reign was originally represented in the romantic annals of it  Thus Chaucer  In the old dayis of the king Arthure  Of which the Britons speken great honour  All was this lond fulfillid of Fayry  The ElfQUENE with her jolly company  Daunsid full oft in many a grene mede  This was the old opinion as I rede  The wife of Bath's tale  The reader is desir'd to take notice that in numbering any passage from Chaucer's Cant Tales we have follow'd Urry's scheme  Thus Spenser follow'd the popular tradition in sup∣posing his  It appears from John Marston's Satires entitled The SCOURGE OF VILLANIE  Three Bookes of Satyres  and printed in the year that our author's FAERIE QUEENE occasioned many publications in which Fairies were the principal actors viz  Go buy some ballad of the FAERY KING  In Lectores  And in another Place  At length some wonted sleepe doth crowne  His newfalne lids dreams straight tenne pound to one  Outsteps some FAERY with quick motion  And tells him wonders of some flowrie vale  Awakes straite rubs his eyes and prints his tale  B sat  And I have seen a romance which seems to have been written soon after Spenser's poem entitled The REDROSE KNIGHT where the knight after the example of prince Arthur goes in search of the Fairy Queen  The satires abovemention'd contain many welldrawn characters and several good strokes of a satirical genius but are not upon the whole so finished and classical as bishop Hall's the first part of which were publish'd about a year before these Among other passages the following struck me as being a good deal in the strain of the beginning of Milton's L'Allegro  Sleepe grim reproof my jocond muse doth sing  In other keyes to nimble fingering  Dull sprighted melancholy leave my braine  To hell Cimmerian night in lively vaine  I strive to paint then hence all darke intent  And sullen frowns come sporting merriment  Cheekedimpling laughter c  B Sat  From these satires we may learn also how popular a play Romeo and Juliet was in those days  He is speaking to a wit of the town  Luscus what's playd to dayfaith now I know  I sett thy lips abroach from whence doth flow  Nought but pure JULIET and ROMEO  Ibid  Langbaine Dram Poets pag informs us that these sa∣tires now forgotten render'd Marston more eminent than his dra∣matic poetry Two years after these viz another collecti∣on of satires appear'd written by W Rowlands which are by no means contemptible These are entitled  The Letting  of  Hu∣mours Blood in the Headvaine  So that bishop Hall was not with∣out some followers in the species of poetry which he had newly reviv'd  FAERIE QUEENE to exist in the age of  Arthur In Chaucer we find that fairy land and Fairies were us'd in a more general sense for an ideal place and people Thus in the marchants tale  Pluto that is king of FAYRIE  And above  Proserpine and all her FAYRIE  This fiction of the Fairies was undoubtedly brought with many other fantastic extravagancies of the like  nature from the Eastern nations by the European Christians who had been at the holy war and those expeditions were some of the first subjects of romance as an admirable judge of this matter observes who farther informs us  "Nor were the monstrous em∣bellishments of enchantments c the invention of the romancers but form'd upon Eastern tales brought thence by travellers from their crusades and pil∣grimages which indeed have a cast peculiar to the wild imagination of the Eastern people"  Supplement to the translator's preface before Jarvis's Don Quixote  The Persians call the Fairies Peri and the Arabs Ginn and they feign that there is a certain country inhabited by them called Ginnistian which corresponds to our Fairyland Our old romantic history sup∣poses that Arthur still reigns in Fairyland from whence he will one day return to Britain and reesta∣blish the round table c Thus Lydgate  He is a king ycrounid in Fairie  With scepter and sword and with his regally  Shall resort as lord and soveraigne  Out of Fairie and reigne in Britaine  And repaire again the old round table  By prophecy Merlin set the date c  Fall of Princes B Ch  Many other instances might be alledged from which it would be more abundantly manifested that the imagination of our author was deeply tinctur'd with that species of writing with which his age was so  intimately acquainted and so generally delighted but we have perhaps been already sufficiently prolix in a disquisition which to the lovers of Spenser cannot appear altogether unentertaining a disquisition af∣fording that kind of information which though it does not improve the judgment will gratify the cu∣riosity And if there should be any readers who disgusted with the ideas of knights dragons and en∣chanters should after perusing the FAERIE QUEENE address the author of it as cardinal d'Este did Ario∣sto after reading his Orlando  "  Dove Diavolo Mes∣ser  Lodovico  avete pigliate tante coglionerie Where the Devil and did you pick up all these lies  "  I beg those gentlemen will look upon this section as a sufficient answer to that question  SECT III Of Spenser's use and abuse of antient history and mythology  AS Spenser sought to produce surprise by extra∣vagant incidents and fantastic descriptions the mythology of the antients afforded matter no less co∣pious than suitable for such a design He has ac∣cordingly adopted some of their most romantic fic∣tions in many of which he has departed from the re∣ceived tradition as his purpose and subject required And indeed with regard to our author's misrepre∣sentation of the fables of antiquity it may be ob∣served that from those arguments which are pro∣duced  against his fidelity new ones may be drawn in favour of his fancy Spenser's native force of in∣vention would not permit him to pursue the letter of prescribed fiction with tame regularity and scru∣pulous exactness In many particulars he varies from antiquity merely that he may introduce new beauties and frequently mentions one or two circum∣stances of antient fable not so much with a design of adorning his poem with them as of taking an oppor∣tunity from them of raising a new fiction of his own He sometimes indeed misrepresents these matters through haste his allusions to antient history are likewise very frequent which in many instances he has not scrupled to violate with equal freedom and for the same reasons  B i c i S xxxvii  A bold bad man that dar'd to call by name  Great Gorgon  Mr Jortin has cited many instances by which it appears that the antients were most superstitiously fearfull of uttering the name of Gorgon or Daemo∣gorgon It may not be impertinent to remark that they were no less afraid of calling the furies by their names  Electra in Euripides says of the furies that tor∣mented her brother      Orestes v  Vereor enim nominare  Deas Eumenidas quae eum certatim perterrent  And in another scene Orestes says    Visus surn mihi videre tres puellas nocti similes  Whom Menelaus answers    Ibid v  Novi quas dixisti nominare autem nolo  Below we have the same superstition concerning Hecate for which it would be difficult perhaps to bring any antient testimony  And threatned unto him the dreaded name  Of Hecate  St  Either that her name was fear'd in general or that Morpheus was particularly afraid of uttering or of hearing it Our author with great strength of fancy has feign'd such a circumstance as this of Merlin  The fiends do quake when any him to them does name    Though perhaps this is not more expressive of Mer∣lin's diabolical power than what Olaus Magnus men∣tions of that of a Swedish enchanter viz That he could  blunt the edge of the weapons of his enemies only by looking at them and that he could make hell a light place  B i C iv S  He is describing Envy  still did chaw  Betweene his cankred teeth a venemous toad  That all the poyson ran about his jaw  Ovid  Met ii v  tells us that Envy was found eating the flesh of vipers which is not much unlike Spenser's picture But our author has heighten'd this circum∣stance to a most disgusting degree for he adds that the poyson ran about her jaw This is perhaps one of the most loathsom ideas that Spenser has given us though he paints very strongly as Jortin observes B i i  She spewd out of her filthy maw  A flood of poyson horrible and black  Full of great lumps of flesh and gobbets raw  Which stunk so vilely that it forc'd him slack  His grasping hold  As also in the discovery of Duessa He is also very indelicate where he speaks of Serena's wounds  For now her wounds corruption 'gan to breed    See also and In reality the strength of our author's imagination could not be suppress'd or kept in on any subject and in some measure it is owing to the fullness of his stanza and the frequency of his rhymes that he has describ'd these disagreeable ob∣jects so minutely But to return to his Envy This personage is again introduc'd chawing a snake of which circumstance a most beautiful use is there made St  Then from her mouth the gobbet she does take  The which whyleare she was so greedily  Devouring even that halfgnawen snake  And at him throwes it most despitefully  The cursed serpent tho' she hungrily  Earst chaw'd thereon yet was not all so dead  But that some life remained secretly  And as he past before withouten dread  Bit him behind that long the mark was to be read  It may be urg'd that Spenser drew the thought of her throwing the Snake at him from Alecto's attack upon Amata  Huic Dea caeruleis unum de crinibus anguem  Conjicit inque sinus praecordia ad intima condit  Aen viiv  But Spenser's application of this thought is surely a much greater effort of invention than the thought itself The malignity both of Envy and of her Snake  could not have been exprest is more significant strokes tho' the snake was her constant food yet she was tempted to deprive herself of sustenance that she might cast it at him and tho' the snake by being thus con∣stantly fed upon was almost dead yet it's natural ma∣lignity enabled it to bite him violently  B i C v S xxxix  His rash sire began to rend  His haire and hastie tongue that did offend  Theseus did not rend his tongue upon this occasion Mr Jortin would excuse our author for his false re∣presentation of this matter by supposing an elleipsis viz  he began to rend his hair and to blame or curse his  tongue Tho' Spenser is full of elleipses yet he seldom has been guilty of such a one as this I should therefore think this passage ought not to be refer'd to Spenser's Elleipses but to that fault which he so fre∣quently commits the fal  ication of antient story Besides the words  that did offend  join'd to  hastie tongue  seem to be given by the poet as an express reason why he rent it  B i C vi S xiv  Sylvanus is here introduced  His weake steps governing  And aged limbes on cypresse stadle stout  I do not remember that Sylvanus is any where de∣scrib'd as infirm with old age neither did he use a  cypresstree for the purpose here mentioned which was a young plant torn up by the roots and carried in his hand Virgil addresses him    Teneram ab radice ferens Sylvane cupressum  Georg iv  B i C vii S xvii  That renowned Snake  Which great Alcides in STREMONA slew  Longfostred in the filth of LERNA lake  Hercules slew the Hydra in the lake of Lerna be∣tween Mycenae and Argos Stremona is no where to be met with which probably he put for Strymon a river of Macedonia in the confines of Thrace But to read Strymon here would no more help out the sense than it would the measure  B ii C iv S xli  Sonne of Erebus and Night  Spenser is just to mythology in representing Erebus and Night as married In another place this address is made to Night  Black Erebus thy husband is    In these lines of Milton  Hence loathed melancholy  Of CERBERUS and blackest midnight born  Mr Upton would read EREBUS for Cerberus the alteration is indeed ingenious and to his defence of it he might have added that Milton in one of his juvenile Latin poems has shewn his knowledge of this mythological point viz  Nox  senis amplexus  EREBI  taciturna petivit  After all it is not improbable but that Milton might write CERBERUS full of the idea of the loath∣somness of melancholy he seems to have chosen out the most detestable parents for her that his imagination could suggest CERBERUS and MIDNIGHT and it should be observed that he does not say Midnight simply but  blackest Midnight  an epithet by which he strongly marks out his abhorrence of the offspring of so foul a pair and the consistency and propriety of her being leagu'd with Cerberus  Our author is likewise true to mythology in what he says of Night in the following verses  O thou most antient grandmother of old  More old than Jove whom thou at first didst breed    Thus Orpheus in his hymn to Night      Noctem deorum genitricem cantabo atque hominûm  Nox genetrix omnium    He afterwards says of her  Which wast begot in Daemogorgon's hall  That is in Chaos who is the parent of Night accord∣ing to Hesiod    Theog  A Chao autem Erebus atraque nox gignebantur  Spenser makes Night the mother of Falshood which is agreeable to Hesiod  Though I the mother be  Of Falshood  S below    Ibid  Nox perniciosa post illam fraudem peperit  Spenser gives Night a chariot for which he has the authority of many antient poets Theocritus      Aen  Virgil  Jam bigis subvecta polum nox atra tenebat  b  Apollonius mentions the horses of Night    Idyll  As does Tibullus  Ludite jam nox jungit Equos      I have often thought that what Spenser says of the horses of night tempted Milton to go farther and give them names  Thus Spenser  And coleblack steeds yborne of hellish broode  That on their rustie bits did champ as they were wood    And afterwards  Her twyfold teme of which two black as pitch  And two were brown yet each to each unlich    Milton's lines are these  Nox senis amplexus Erebi taciturna reliquit  Praecipitesque impellit equos stimulante flagello  Captum oculis Typhlonta Melanchaetemque ferocem  Atque Acherontaeo prognatam patre Siopem  Torpidam hirsutis horrentem Phrica capillis  In Quintum Novembris v  Tho' at the same time it is probable that he thought of the horses of the Sun which are nam'd in Ovid Milton in the same poem had an eye to another pas∣sage in our author who having describ'd the per∣sonages that sate by the highway leading to hell adds this fine image  And over them sad Horror with grim hew  Did alwaies sore beating his iron wings    Milton after describing some of the same per∣sonages adds    Exanguisque locum circumvolat horror  Ibid v  Among these personages Milton's description of Phonos or murder whom he couples with Pro∣dotes or treason is remarkably beautifull  Ipsi etiam pavidi latitant penetralibus antri  Et Phonos Prodotes nulloque sequente per antrum  Antrum horrent scopulosum atrum feralibus umbris  Diffugiunt sontes retro lumina vertunt  But I think is equall'd by Fletcher's figure of Phonos in his forgotten poem called the Purple Island  Last of this rout the savage PHONOS went  Whom his dire mother nurst with human blood  And when more age and strength more fierce∣nesse lent  She taught him in a dark and desart wood  With force and guile poore passengers to slay  And on their flesh his barking stomack stay  And with their wretched blood his fiery thirst allay  Ten thousand furies on his steps awaited  Some sear'd his hardned soul with Stygian brand  Some with black terrors his faint conscience baited  That wide he star'd and starched hair did stand  The firstborne man still in his minde he bore  Foully array'd in guiltlesse brother's gore  Which for revenge to heav'n from earth did loudly roar  Cant St  It is observable that this little poem of Milton as containing a council conspiracy and attempt of Sa∣tan may look'd upon as an early prelusion of his ge∣nius to the subject of the paradise lost  B ii C vii S  The garden of Proserpina this hight  And in the midst thereof a silver seat  With a thick arbour c  Next thereunto did growe a goodly tree  On this tree he adds grew golden apples and that from this likewise sprung the tree of the Hesperides but these circumstances as also that of Proserpina's garden c is I think not to be justified from an∣tient writers He afterwards informs us that the gold∣en apples by which Acontius won Cydippe and that which Ate threw among the Gods were gather'd from  this tree but these as we learn from many passages in the Classics were the produce of the Hesperian tree abovemention'd He then tells us that the branches of this tree overspread the river Cocytus in which Tantalus was plung'd up to the chin who was perpe∣tually catching at its fruit in which he copies Ho∣mer in some measure who acquaints us that many trees of delicious fruit wav'd over the lake in which Tantalus was plac'd but it does not appear from him that Tantalus was fix'd in Cocytus but in some lake peculiarly appropriated to his punishment    Spenser has also made another use of Cocytus viz that the shores of Cocytus perpetually resounded with the shrieks of damned ghosts who underwent an ever∣lasting punishment by being dipt in its waters Co∣cytus indeed says antient fable must be past before there is any possibility of arriving at the infernal re∣gions but we do not find that it was a punishment allotted to any of the ghosts to be thus plung'd into its waves nor that this circumstance was the cause of the cries which echoed around its banks  What he has invented of Cocytus exhibits a fine image he supposes that when Sir Guyon came to this river  He clomb up to the bank  And looking downe sawe many damned wights  In those sad waves which direfull deadly stanke  Plonged continually of cruel sprights  That with their pittious cries and yelling shrights  They made the further shore resounden wide  St  The antients tell us that the golden apple for which the goddesses strove on mount Ida was pluck'd in the garden of the Hesperides but Spenser's allego∣rising imagination feigns that it grew in hell He might probably receive the hint of this tree with the golden apples from Homer's mention of various trees which grew in hell near the lake of Tantalus hinted at above but the silver stool beneath it is en∣tirely his own which Mammon persuades the knight to seat himself upon and is A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE of TEMPTATION  Thou fearfull foole  Why takest not of that same fruit of gold  Ne sittest downe on that same silver stoole  To rest thy weary person in the shadow coole  St  After all as the mythology of the Pagans was their religion the violation of it is hardly excusable  B ii C xii S xlvii  They in that place him GENIUS do call  Not that coelestial powre to whom the care  Of life and generation over all  That

contain∣ing the legend of BRITOMARTIS or of CHASTITY  Britomartis among the Cretans was another name for Diana the goddess of Chastity and in this book Spenser's Britomartis is represented as the patroness of Chastity It is not improbable as our author has copied the greatest part of the second Canto of this book from the Ceiris of Virgil that he learn'd from the same poem that Britomartis was a name for Diana viz  Dictynnam dixere  tuo  de nomine Lunam  v  She was a Cretan nymph and the daughter of Jupi∣ter and Charme whom Virgil has introduced in his Ceiris as the nurse of Scylla and from whom our  author has copied his Glauce Britomart's nurse in the Canto mentioned above She was called Dictyn∣na because she invented nets for hunting which be∣ing also one of Diana's names Britomartis and Dia∣na were look'd upon as the same Callimachus speaks of her as one of the nymphs of Diana's train but observes that she was called by the Cydonians Dic∣tynna He has left us the history of Britomartis in his hymn to Diana            v  Praecipuè autem inter alias omnes Gortynida amasti Nympham  Cervarum Venatricem Britomartin Jaculatricem cujus olim Minos  Amore perculsus pervagatus est

desiliit Nympha  Dictaeum appellitant excitatisque ibi sacris  Sacra etiam faciunt    Upon the word  says the scholiast    And Solinus speaks to the same effect  "Cretes Dianam religiosissimè venerantur  gentiliter nominantes quod sermone nostro sonat virginem dulcem"  Polstyhi C  But tho' Spenser in Brito∣martis had some reference to Diana yet at the same time he intended to denote by that name the martial BRITONESSE  The reader is desired to take notice that the passage which Spenser has copied from the Ceiris of Virgil begins at this verse of that poem  Quam simul Ogygii Phoenicis Filia Charme  Ver  And ends at  Despue ter Virgo numero deus impare gaudet  Ver  B iii C vi S  Speaking of the garden of Adonis  In that same garden all the goodly flowres  Wherewith dame nature doth her beautifie  Are fetcht there is the first seminarie  Of all things that are born to live and die  In his description of this garden he might probably have an eye to the notion of the antients concerning Adonis that he represented the sun which quickens the growth of all things Thus Orpheus in his Hymn to Adonis        Others represent him as the seed of wheat Thus the scholiast of Theocritus after having informed us that Adonis after his death remained six months in the em∣braces of Venus and six months with Proserpine    Apud Idyll v  "Hoc re vera ita se habet scilicet quod Adonis frumentum est satium quod sex menses sub terra degit sex menses eum habet Venus nimirum Aeris tempe∣ries postea a messoribus colligitur"  Orpheus in the same hymn calls the body of Adonis      Corpus frugiferum  He has placed Cupid and Psyche in this garden where they live together in  stedfast love and happy state  St  But Apuleius represents this happy state of Cupid and Psyche to have commenced after their reception into Heaven However their offspring Pleasure is a∣greeable to what Apuleius relates  "Sic ecce Psyche venit in manum Cupidinis nascitur illis matu∣ro partu filia quam VOLUPTATEM nominamus"  Metam b  He has made Pleasure the daughter of Cupid in ano∣ther place speaking to Love  There with thy daughter Pleasure they do play  Their hurtlesse sports  Hymne of love  B iii C xi S xlvii  Of the statue of Cupid  Wings it had with sundrie colours bright  More sundry colours than the proud Pavone  Beares in his boasted fan or Iris bright  When her discolour'd bowe she spreads thro' heaven bright  Cupid was represented by the antients with parti∣colour'd wings as we learn among others from this passage quoted by Mr Jortin from an epigram ascrib'd to Virgil  Marmoreusque tibi  DIVERSICOLORIBUS  alis  In morem picta stabit Amor pharetra  But this picturesque circumstance was probably sup∣ply'd by our author's fancy In the Pastorals March he draws Cupid after the same manner  With that sprung forth a naked swaine  With spotted wings like Peacocke's traine  Thus also of love in the next Canto St  And clapt on hie his coloured winges twaine  In the comparison of the Peacock and the Rainbow as they occur together he probably imitated Tasso  Ne'l superbo  PAVON  si vago in monstra  Spiega la pompa de l'occhiute piume  Ne l'  IRIDE  si bella indora e inostra  Il curvo grembo e rugiadoso al lume  Gier Lib B S  The jolly Peacock speads not half so fair  The eyed feathers of his pompous train  Nor so bends golden Iris in the air  Her twenty colour'd bow thro' clouds of rain  Fairfax  Spenser's  proud Pavone  is literally Tasso's  superbo Pa∣von  He has again join'd these two comparisons Speaking of a Butterfly's wings  Not halfe so many sundry colours arre  In Iris bowe  Nor Juno's bird in her eyespotted traine  So many goodly colours doth containe  Muipotmos  Where eyespotted traine is plainly the  occhiute piume  of the Italian poet  Chaucer in one of his figures of Cupid supposes that his wings were adorn'd with rich plumage  And ANGELIKE his wingis saw I sprede  Leg of G Wom v  B iii C xii S vii  And every wood and every valley wide  He fill'd with Hylas name the nymphes eke Hylas cride  Most of the antient writers who relate the story of Hylas mention the circumstance of Hylas's name being often reecho'd by the hills c when it was so loudly and frequently call'd upon by Hercules but I do not recollect that any of them speak of the nymphs as repeating his name With regard to the for∣mer particular Antonius has given us an ex∣plication of it not generally known from the  of Nicander  "Hercules says he having made the hills and forrests tremble by calling so mightily on the name Hylas the nymphs who had snatch'd him away fearing lest the enraged lo∣ver should at last discover Hylas in their fountain transformed him into Echo which answer'd  Hylas  to every call of Hercules"  This solution throws a new light on the circumstance of Hylas's name being so often eccho'd back and which is particularly insisted on by Virgil Eclog v by Propertius in his E∣legy De Raptu Hylae and by Valerius Flaccus b v On account of the many invocations of his name said to be made by Hercules and of its being so often reeccho'd I suppose a custom men∣tion'd by Solinus was every year celebrated on the banks of the lake Hylas  In cujus Hylae memoriam usque adhuc solenni cursitatione lacum populus circuit Hylam Voce clamat  Polyhist cap  The distress of Hercules after he had lost Hylas is finely described by Valerius Flaccus seq and the manner by which Hylas is decoy'd to the fountain is a pretty poe∣tical fiction v Upon the whole I am in∣duced  to think that Apollonius has much more beautifully describ'd this story than Theocritus It is remarkable that Scaliger who in general prefers Flaccus to his original Apollonius should thus ex∣press himself of the comparison concerning the an∣guish felt by Hercules on the occasion of losing Hy∣las which occurs in both poets after quoting the Latin of Flaccus  Haec quidem sonora magis plus ta∣men arrident Graeca  Poet B C  B iv C x S xlvii  The poet is addressing Venus  Great GOD of men and women  Mr Jortin observes that Venus is called GOD in Virgil  Descendo ac ducente  DEO  flammam inter hostes  Expedior    Aen v  Where Servius  DEO  secundum eos qui dicunt utrius∣que sexus participationem habere numina nam ait Calvus  Pollentemque  DEUM  Venerem    To this it may be added that the poet prepares the reader for the appellation GOD apply'd to Venus St above in his description of the statue of that goddess  But for they say she hath both kinds in one  Both male and female both under one name  She sire and mother is herself alone  Begets and eke conceives ne needeth other none  He has also follow'd the same notion in Colin Clouts Come Home Again  For Venus selfe doth solely couples seeme  Both male and female thro' commixture joyn'd  B v C i S xii  But when she parted thence she left her groome  An yron man which did on her attend  Alwayes to execute her stedfast doome  And willed him with Arthegall to wend  And do whatever things he did intend  His name was TALUS made of iron mould  Immoveable resistless without end  Who in his hand an iron flail did hold  With which he thresht out falsehood and did truth unfold  The character of executing justice here attributed to Talus is exactly agreeable to that which he bears in antient story nor has Spenser greatly varied from antiquity in the make of this wonderfull man for he is there said to be form'd of brass and by our author of iron Plato gives the following account of him    In Minoe Plat Op Edit Serran pag vol  Utebatur autem Minos hoc legum suarum custode apud urbem in caeteris vero Cretae partibus Talo Et profectò Talus ter in anno vicos circuibat legibus tuen∣dis intentus in illis quas habebat in aeneis tabulis in∣scriptas unde nuncupatus est Talus  As to the cir∣cumstance of Talus's traversing the isle of Crete it exactly corresponds with what Spenser says afterwards of his iron man who did the same in Ierne  And that same yron man which could reveale  All hidden crimes thro' all that realme he sent  To search out those that us'd to rob and steale  Or did rebell 'gainst lawfull government    Plato has told us that Talus was called brazen on account of his carrying the laws about with him writ∣ten in brazen tables but Apollonius informs us that he was actually made of brass and invulnerable    B v  Sed is cum caetero corpore membris esset  Aeneus invulnerabilis tamen sub tenonte habebat  In malleolo turgentem sanguine venam quam tenuis  Continebat tunicula vitae praestabat mortisque confinium  Apollonius likewise takes notice of his circuiting Crete three times a year    Ibid v  Ter in anno Cretam aeneis obeuntem pedibus  Apollodorus will further illustrate this matter    Bibliothec b c  Exinde navi∣gantes prohibentur quò minùs Cretae

our author  His yron page who him pursew'd so light  As that it seem'd above the ground he went  For he was swift as swallow in her flight    And is alluded to by Catullus in his Ode to Camerius where he tells him that he should not be able to pur∣sue him  Non  CUSTOS  si ego fingar ille  CRETUM  Car  Orpheus or rather  Who liv'd in the time of the Pisistratic tyranny about Olymp For a proof that

Ovid reports Met that Ino threw herself with her son Melicerta from the top of a rock into the sea Others say that she murdred Melicerta and after that leapt into the sea It is difficult to fix upon Spenser's precise meaning in these verses  Ibid  Or as that madding mother 'mongst the rout  Of Bacchus' priests her own deare flesh did teare  The madding mother is Agave Her son Pentheus being of a very temperate disposition and consequent∣ly averse to the rites of Bacchus she together with the rest of the Maenades tore him in pieces in the midst of the Bacchanalia Mr Upton instead of  Her  owne  dear flesh did teare  would read her SON'S dear flesh But surely the poet and that with no great impropriety of expres∣sion might mean her  Son  's flesh by her  owne  flesh  B v C x S x  Orthrus begotten by great Typhaon  And fowle Echidna  who guarded the purple oxen of Geryon I wonder that Spenser should in this place omit the mention of a sevenheaded dragon who together with Orthrus was placed to guard these oxen and was likewise the offspring of Typhaon and Echidna  B iv C xi S xiii  He is giving a catalogue of the Sea Gods among the rest is Astraeus  that did shame  Himselfe with incest of his kin unkend  Natalis Comes thus relates the story of Astraeus  "Astraeus qui per inscitiam congressus cum Alcippe sorore sequenti die cognita affinitate ex annulo maerore captus se in

Spenser probably took his catalogue from this mythologist I think he has given us no names Albion excepted but what are found in that author and besides the account of Astraeus abovemention'd we find

choris Nereu  B vi C x S  Speaking of the Graces  They are the daughters of skyruling Jove  By him begot of faire Eurynome  Milton in his L'Allegro represents the Graces as the offspring of Venus and Bacchus This mytholo∣gy as an ingenious critic on that passage observes without doubt suits the nature of Milton's subject bet∣ter but I can hardly think that such a liberty is al∣lowable upon any occasion The mention of Eury∣nome in this stanza of our author puts me in mind of another passage in Milton where this Goddess is likewise mention'd  And fabled how the serpent whom they call'd  Ophion with Eurynome the wide  Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule  Of high Olympus c  Par L B v  Which as the learned Dr Newton and others ob∣serve is copied from these verses of Apollonius    B v  What I have to observe here is that Apollonius as well as Milton has hinted that Ophion was of the serpentrace which will appear from considering what goes before these lines  Spenser alludes to this song of Orpheus and the occasion upon which it was sung more than once  Such one was Orpheus that when strife was grown  Amongst those famous impes of Greece did take  His silver harpe in hand and shortly friends them make    And in SONNET  When those renowned noble peres of Greece  Through stubborn pride among themselves did jar  Forgetful of the famous golden fleece  Then Orpheus with his harp their strife did bar  Scaliger finds great fault with the subject of this song and prefers to it the subject of Orpheus's song in Valerius Flaccus  "Longe enim aptius Orpheus canit apud Flaccum Minyas Phryxum Athamantem quam apud Apollonium terrae caelique creatio∣nem Quid enim Viris militaribus cum Philosophorum umbris"  Poet B c  But by this piece of criticism Scaliger has great∣ly betray'd his ignorance of the nature of antient Poesy and of the character of Orpheus  "In the early ages of the Grecian state says the admirable author of the Enquiry into the life and writings of Homer the wild and barbarous inhabitants wanted the assistance of the Muses to soften and tame them They stood in need of being impressed with an awe of superior and irresistible powers and a liking to social life They wanted a mythology to lead them by fear and dread the only holds to be taken of a rude multitude into a feeling of natural causes and their influence upon our lives and actions The wise and good among the antients saw this ne∣cessity and supplied it the oldest of the inspired train were the  PII VATES  Phaebo digna locuti  They had religion for their theme and the service of mankind for their song"  Sect  And in another place the same author acquaints us that all the poems of Orpheus were  "philosophical prophetical and religious"  Sect  Thus the conduct of Apollo∣nius was highly consistent in attributing a song to Orpheus whose subject was philosophy and religion And it was for the same reason that Onomacritus in his Argonautics v many years before Apollonius represented Orpheus singing the origin of the Gods and the creation of things in his contest with Chiron  But the propriety of the subject of this song is easily to be defend∣ed without considering the character of Orpheus The occasion of this song was a quarrel among the Argonauts whom Orpheus en∣deavours to pacify with the united powers of music and verse Up∣on which account says the Scholiast    To this it may be added that a song whose subject is likewise religious and which asserts the right of Jupiter to the possession of Olympus was even expedient as one of the chiefs had but just before spoken blasphemy against him  c  v  Testor nunc penetrabilem hastam quicum lemniscatam  E bellis palmam reporto non enim Jovi rescripsero victorias  Justius quam hastae meae c  Nor were the auditors of this song of so mean a rank as Scaliger would represent them he terms them VIRI MILITARES but it should be consider'd that they were PRINCES and DEMIGODS  But whether the subject of Orpheus's song in Apollonius be good or bad there is one circumstance belonging to it which gives it a manifest superiority to that of Orpheus in Valerius Flaccus I mean the design of it which was to repress the vehemence of the passions at once so agreeable to the wellknown character of Orpheus and so expressive of the irresistible influence of music In the Latin poet Orpheus sings upon no occasion and to no end unless it be to make the night pass away more pleasantly  Thracius hic  NOCTEM  dulci testudine Vates  EXTRAHIT  I cannot close this note without remarking that Milton in these lines had a reference both to Apollonius and Onomacritus in their respective songs of Orpheus  Tunc de more sedens festa ad convivia Vates  Aesculeâ intonsos redimitus ab arbore crines  Heroumque actus imitandaque gesta canebat  Et Chaos positi late fundamina mundi  Reptantesque deos alentes numina glandes  Et nondum Aetneo quaesitum fulmen ab antro  Denique quid vocis modulamen inane juvabit

alludes to the contest of Chiron with Orpheus as related by Onomacritus and it is remarkable that in describing the miraculous power of the music of Orpheus he has plainly translated from the Greek poet particularly in this cir∣cumstance    v  Avesque circumdederunt stabula Centauri  Pennis defessis suique oblitae erant Nidi  The verses of Sil Italicus are these  Inmemor dulcis Nidi positoque volatu  Non mota volucris captiva pependit in aethra  The Latin poet has however omitted to describe the manner in which Chiron was affected at seeing the wonderful effect of Or∣pheus's music on the trees mountains rivers beasts c His asto∣nishment on that occasion is thus beautifully painted by the Greek poet    v  Sed videns haec Centaurus obstupuit manum super volam  Valde feriens terramque pulsavit unguibus  Orpheus begins his  song with the creation of things after mentioning the sun and moon mountains and rivers he speaks of the creation of serpents    Ibid  Quemadmodum exorti sint Montes resonantes fluvii  Cum ipsis Nymphis quomodo omnia reptilia con∣creverint  And in the next line from these EPITETA or Ser∣pents he passes on to Ophion  c  Thus here is a close connection and an easy transition in the context of Apollonius which doth not appear at first sight  As an instance of an imitation of Milton from A∣pollonius has been just produced I hope the reader  will excuse my taking this opportunity of producing another The English poet thus describes Adam's hair  Hyacinthin locks  Round from his parted forelock manly hung  CLUSTRING  P L  The circumstance of the hair hanging like bunches of grapes has been justly admired but it is literally  translated from this description of Apollo's hair in the Greek poet      B v    Aurei ab utraque gena  Cincinni racemantes

the parents of Hecate Orpheus calls her    v  Tartari Filia Hecate  The Titans were indeed thrown into Tartarus but it could not be said from thence that the Titans were her parents tho' this I presume was the best argument that our author had for his genealogy In this stanza Bellona is likewise feigned to be the off∣spring of the Titans but Bellona was the sister of Mars who was the son of Jupiter and Juno or as Ovid reports of Juno alone  A classical reader of the FAERIE QUEENE may dis∣cover many other examples which properly belong to this Section but those which are here omitted he

christian  SECT IV Of Spenser's Stanza Versification and Language  ALthough Spenser's favourite Chaucer had made use of the ottave Rime  Chaucer's Stanza is not STRICTLY so  or Stanza of eight lines yet it is most probable that our author was induced to make choice of it with the addition of one line from the example of Tasso and Ariosto who were the most fashionable poets of his age But Spenser in making this choice of his stanza seems not suffi∣ciently to have consider'd the genius of the English language which will not easily admit of that more frequent repetition of the same termination which  this stanza requires a circumstance not difficult in the Italian which deals largely in identical cadences  I am obliged to the admirable author of the Rambler for this observation  This constraint led our author into many absurdities For example  I It necessitated him to dilate the thing to be ex∣prest however unimportant with trifling and insipid circumlocutions viz  Now hath faire Phaebe with her silver face  Thrice seene the shadows of the nether world  Sith last I left that honorable place  In which her royal presence is enroll'd    That is  "it is three months since I left her palace"  II It obliged him when matter fail'd him to∣wards the close of his Stanza to run into a ridiculous redundancy and repetition of words viz  In which was nothing pourtrahed nor wrought  Nor wrought nor pourtrahed but easie to be thought    III It forc'd him in order to make out his com∣plement of rhymes to introduce a puerile or imperti∣nent idea viz  Not that proud towre of Troy tho' richly GILT    In this line being laid under a necessity of producing somewhat consonant to  spilt  and  built  which went be∣fore  he has given us an image at once little and im∣proper And to the difficulty of his stanza I think we may impute the great number of his Ellipses some of which will be pointed out in another place  Notwithstanding these absurdities flow from Spen∣ser's stanza yet it must be own'd that some ad∣vantages arise from it and we may venture to affirm that the fullness and significancy of Spenser's descrip∣tions is often owing to the prolixity of his stanza and the multitude of his rhymes The discerning reader is desired to consider the following stanza as an instance of what is here advanced Guyon is binding Furor  With hundred iron chaines he did him bind  And hundred knots which did him sore constraine  Yet his great iron teeth he still did grind  And grimly gnash threatening revenge in vaine  His burning eyen whom bloudie strakes did staine  Stared full wide and threw forth sparkes of fire  And more for ranke despight than for great paine  Shakt his long locks colour'd like copper wire  And bit his tawny beard to shew his raging ire    In this stanza there are some images which are per∣haps the consequence of a multiplicity of rhymes  He all that night that too long night did passe  And now the day out of the oceanmaine  Began to peep above this earthly masse  With pearly dew sprinkling the morning grasse  Then up he rose like heavy lump of leade  That in his face as in a looking glasse  The signes of anguish one might plainely reade    Dryden I think somewhere remarks that rhyme often helped him to a thought an observation which probably Spenser's experience had likewise supplied him with Spenser however must have found more

cadence or by untrue orthography to wrench his words to help his rhyme for it is a sign that such a maker is not copious is his own lan∣guage"  However he seems afterwards to allow the deviation from true spelling in some measure  "It  is somewhat more tollerable to help the rhyme by false orthographie than to leave an unpleasant dissonance to the eare by keeping trewe orthographie and losing the rime as for example it is better to rime  dore  with restore than in his true orthographie which is dooreSuch men were in effect the most part of all your old rimers and 'specially Gower who to make up his rime would for the most part write his termi∣nant syllable with false orthographie and many times not sticke to put in a plaine French word for an English and so by your leave do many of our com∣mon rymers at this day"  B c  We find in many passages of our author the orthography violated when the rhyme without such an expedient would be very exact thus BITE when made to rhyme with DELIGHT

Hughes not considering our author's custom of mis∣spelling a word for the convenience of rhyme makes him frequently guilty of some very bad rhymes for that editor among other examples of his correctness has reduced Spenser's text to modern orthography with great accuracy  It is indeed surprising upon the whole that our author should have been able to execute a poem of such a length as the FAERIE QUEENE with so much spirit laden with so many shackles and opprest with so grievous a BONDAGE OF RIMING I do not re∣member that he has been so inaccurate as to make the same word rhyme to itself in more than four or five instances a fault which if he had committed very frequently his many beauties of versification would have obliged us to overlook and which Har∣rington should more frequently have avoided to compensate in some measure for the tameness and prosaic mediocrity of his numbers  Notwithstanding our author's affectation  The author of the Arte of English poesie seems to have cen∣sur'd this practice of Spencer  "Our maker therefore at these dayes shall not follow Piers Plowman nor Gower nor Lyd∣gate nor yet Chaucer for their language is now out of use with us"  B C  The Faerie Queene was not published when this critic wrote so that this censure is levelled at the Pastorals which however in another place he has commended  "For Eglogue and pastoral poesie Sir Ph Sydney and Maister Chal∣lener and that other gentleman who wrote the late Shepherd's Kalender"  B C  Spenser had published the Pastorals about ten years before to which he did not prefix his name  of obso∣lete phrases and words yet it may be affirm'd that  his style is in general perspicuous flowing and exuberant His Pastorals are written in a profess'd imitation of the style of Chaucer of which he has taken care to acquaint us in the beginning of Colin Clouts Come Home Again  The shepherd's boy best knowen by that name  That after Tityrus first sung his lay  Milton in imitation of our author stiles Chaucer Tityrus where he hints at Chaucer's having travelled into Italy  MANSUS  Quin in has quondam pervenit  TYTIRUS  oras  And the tale of the Oak and Briar in the Pastoral of Februarie is more particularly modelled after Chau∣cer's manner and is accordingly usher'd in with this preparatory introduction  A Tale of Truth  Which I cond of Tityrus in my youth  And in another Pastoral he hints at his having copied Chaucer  That Colin hight which well could pipe and sing  For he of Tityrus his songs did lere  He even seems in the Pastorals to have attempt∣ed an imitation of the visions  The author of the Visions of PIERCE PLOWMAN is Roberte Longelande or Langelande according to Bale Script Brit Cent Wood Hist Antiq Univ Oxon B pag who likewise calls him Malverne It is plain that his poem called the VISIONS of P PLOWMAN was publish'd after the Year from this passage in it  In Date of our bryghte in a drye Apriell  A thousand and three hundred twyse twentye and ten  My wafers ther wer geisen when Chichester was Mair  Pass  So that several of Gower's and Chaucer's pieces made their appear∣ance before it It is divided into twenty parts PASSUS as he styles them and consists of many distinct visions which have no mutual dependance upon each other so that the poem is not a regular and uniform whole consisting of one action or design The author seems to have intended it as a satire on almost every occupation of life but more particularly on the clergy in censuring whom Wickliff had led the way not many years before This piece abounds with humour spirit and imagination all which are drest to great disadvantage in a very uncouth versification and obsolete language It seems to be written without rhyme an ornament which the poet has endeavour'd to supply by making every verse to consist of words beginning with the same letter This practice has contributed not a little to render his poem obscure and per∣plex'd exclusive of its obsolete style for to introduce his allitera∣tion he must have been often necessarily compell'd to depart from the natural and more obvious way of expressing himself The learned Dr Hickes observes that this alliterative versification was drawn by Langland from the practice of the Saxon poets and that these visions abound with many Saxonisms  Haec obiter ex satyrographo nostro Langelande cui AngloSaxonum poet  adeo familiares fuerunt ut non solum eorum verbis versus scripsit sed tinnitum illum consonantem initia  um apud eos literarum imitatus est nonnunquam etiam versus tantùm non Saxonice condidit  Linguar Vett Septentrien Thesaurus cap pag  And afterwards speak∣ing of the AngloSaxon poems he adds this of their alliteration  "Quorum in primis se observandum offert dictionum ab eadem ini∣tiali litera incipientium usus non infrequens"  cap pag  From this it appears that the example of Gower and Chaucer who sought to reform the roughness of their native tongue by naturaliz∣ing many new words from the Latin French and Italian and who introduced the sevenlin'd stanza from Petrarch and Dante into our poetry had little influence upon Longland who chose rather to go back to the Saxon models both for language and form of verse  The curious reader may not perhaps be displeased with a spe∣cimen of the introduction to the first vision  "The poet shadowed by the name and character of Peter or Piers a plowman re∣presents himself as weary with wandering on a Maymorning and at last laid down to sleep by the side of a brook where in a vision he sees a stately tower upon a hill with a dungeon and dark dismal ditches belonging to it and a very deep dale under the hill Before the tower a large field or plain is supposed filled with men of every rank and occupation all being respectively engag'd in their several pursuits when suddenly a beautifull lady appears to him and unravels to him the mystery of what he had seen"  As a specimen of his manner the reader is desir'd to accept some of the verses of which I have just given an analysis  In a summer season when sette was the sun  I shoupe me into the shroubes as I a shepe were  In habit as a hermet unholie of werkes  Went wide into the world wonders to hear  And on a Maymorning on Malvernehylles  Me befel a ferly a fairy methought  I was wery a wandring c  Pass v c  In these verses there is a manifest contradiction for the poet says that the SUN was SETT and that it was a MAYMORNING How∣ever it is plain that in the first line instead of SETTE  was the sun  we should read  When HOTTE was the Sun  For Bale ubi supra speaking of this work thus translates the first line of it  In aestivo tempore cum Sol  CALERET  And it should be remember'd that Bale had an opportunity of quoting from the most original editions  Before every vision the manner of circumstances of his falling asleep are distinctly describ'd before one of them in particular P Plowman is suppos'd with equal humour and satire to fall asleep while he is bidding his beads In the course of the poem the satire is carried on by means of several allegoric personages such as MEDE SIMONY CONSCIENCE SLOTH c The learned Selden notes on Polyolb S mentions this author with ho∣nour and by Hickes he is frequently styled  Celeberrimus ille saty∣rographus morum vindex acerrimus c  Leland seems to have con∣founded this poem with Chaucer's PLOWMAN'S TALE Speaking of two editions of Chaucer he adds  "Sed PETRI ARATORIS FABULA quae communi doctorum consensu Chaucero tan∣quam vero parenti attribuitur in utraque editione quia malos sacerdotum mores vehementer increpavit suppressa est"  Com∣ment de Script Brit cap  Chaucer indeed in the PLOW∣MAN'S TALE seems to have copied from our author  I shall conclude this note with a short extract from Bale  ubi supra    "Illud veruntamen liquido constat eum Langelande fuisse ex primis Joannis Vuiclefi discipulis unum atque in spiritus fervore contra apertas Papistarum blasphemias adversus Deum ejus Christum sub amaenis coloribus typis edidisse in sermone Anglico pium opus ac bonorum virorum lectione dignum quod vocabat VISIONEM PETRI ARATORISIn hoc opere erudito prater similitudines varias jucundas prophetice plura praedixit quae nostris diebus impleri vidimus Complevit suum opus A D dum Joannes Cicestrius Londini Praetor esset"  of Pierce Plow∣man  for after exhorting his muse not to contend with Chaucer he adds  Nor with the Plowman that the pilgrim playde awhile  Epilogue to SHEP KAL  And besides that his Pastorals might appear a more complete specimen of a work in old English he has given them the title of an old book called the SHEP∣HEARD'S KALENDER first printed by Wynkin a  Worde and reprinted about twenty years before our author published his Pastorals viz Hence says E K in his Epistle prefix'd  "He tearmeth it the SHEPHERD's KALENDER applying an old name to a new work"  One of Spenser's reasons for using so much antient phraseology in these Pastorals was undoubtedly with a design to stamp a Doric or rather rustic simplicity upon them but the princi∣pal one was that which is deliver'd by his friend and commentator  Ibid    "who was privie to all his designs"  E K  "In myne opinion says he it is one especiall prayse of many which are due to this poet that he hath labour'd to restore as to their rightfull heri∣tage such good and naturall English words as have been long time out of use and almost cleane disherited which is the onely cause that our mothertongue which truly of itselfe is both ful enough for prose and stately enough for verse hath long time beene counted most bare and barren of both which default when as some have endevored  to salve and recure they patched up the holes with peeces and ragges of other languages borrowing here of the French there of the Italian and every where of the Latine not weighing how ill those tongues accord with themselves but much worse with ours so now they have made our Englishe tongue a gallimaufrey or hodgepodge of all other speeches"  Thus that which induced Spenser to adopt so much obsolete language in the Pastorals induced him likewise to do the same in the FAERIE QUEENE Hence it is manifest that he was disgusted with the practice of his cotemporary writers who had adulterated according to his judgement the purity of the British tongue by various innovations from the Spanish French Latin and Italian And that this was the case in the age of Queen Elizabeth will appear from the following passages Thus Marston in his satires  I cannot quote a motte Italianate  Or brand my satires with a Spanish terme  Proem B  And Camden having given us a specimen of the Lord's Prayer in old English has these words  "Hitherto will our sparkfull youth laugh at their great grandfathers English who had more care to do well than to speak minionlike and left more glory to us by their exploiting great actes than we shall by our forging new words and un∣couth phrases"  Remains Artic Languages  A learned gentleman one  R C who has inserted a letter to Camden in his re∣mains thus speaks  "So have our Italian travellers brought us acquainted of their sweetrelished phrases even we seeke to make our good of our late Spanish enemie and fear as little the hurt of his tongue as the dint of his sword"  again  "We within these sixty years have incorporated so many Latin and French words as the third part of our tongue consisteth now in them"  And Ascham in his ScholeMaster informs us that not only the language but the manners of Italy had totally infected his countrymen where he is describing the ITALIANIZ'D ENGLISHMAN  The same author acquains us that about this time an infinite number of Italian books were translated into English among the rest were many Italian novels the translations of which Shake∣spere manifestly made use of for some of his plots Those who have undertaken to point out the books from whence Shakespere borrow'd his plots have not I think been able to discover the source from whence he drew the story of his MERCHANT of VE∣NICE which in all probability is founded upon the following antient ballad which I met with in a large collection  A SONG shewing the crueltie of Gernutus a JEWE who lending to a marchant an hundred crownes would have a pound of his fleshe because he could not pay him at the time appointed  In Venice towne not long agoe  A cruell Jewe did dwell  Which lived all on usurie  As Italian writers tell  GERNUTUS called was the Jewe c  The whole song would be too prolix for this place I shall tran∣scribe only the close of the story having premis'd that the cunning and rapacious Jew is represented in our ballad to have lent an eminent merchant of Venice an hundred crowns upon a bond in which promise of payment is made within a year and a day under the forfeiture of a pound of the merchant's flesh in case of nonpayment that the merchant on account of his ships being de∣tain'd by adverse winds was unable to perform his contract at the time appointed that the affair was referr'd to a judge that the friends of the merchant offer'd ten thousand crowns to absolve him but that the Jew obstinately persisted in his demand of the forfeited pound of flesh  Then said the judge Yet good my friend  Let me of you desire  To take the flesh from such a place  As yet you let him live  Doe so and loe an hundred crownes  To thee here I will give  No no quoth he c  * * * * * *  For I will have my pound of fleshe  From under his right side  * * * * * * *  The bloudie Jewe now readie is  With whetted blade in hand  To spoyle the bloude of innocent  By forfeit of his bond  And as he was about to strike  In him the deadlie blow  Stay quoth the judge thy crueltie  I charge thee to doe so  Sith needs thou wilt thy forfeit have  Which is of flesh a pound  See that thou shed no drop of bloud  Nor yet the man confound  For if thou doe like murderer  Thou here shall hanged bee  Likewise of fleshe see that thou cut  No more than longs to thee  For if thou take or more or lesse  To value of a mite  Thou shalt be hanged presentlie  As is both law and right  Gernutus nowe waxt franticke mad  And wote not what to say  Quoth he at last tenne thousand crownes  I will that he shall pay  And so I grant to sette him free  The judge doth answere make  You shall not have a peny given  Your forfeiture now take  At the last he doth demand  But for to have his owne  No quoth the judge doe as you li    Thy judgement shall be showne  Either take your pound of fleshe qd he  Or cancell me your bond  O cruell judge then quoth the Jewe  That doth against me stand  And so with griped grieved mind  He biddeth them farewell  All the people pray'd the Lord  That ever this heard tell  After which follows a moral exhortation resulting from the subject  It may be objected that this ballad might have been written after and copied from Shakespere's play But if that had been the case it is most likely that the author would have preserved Shakespere's name of Shylock for the Jew and nothing is more likely than that Shakespere in copying from this ballad should alter the name from Gernutus to one more Jewish and by the alteration of the name his imitation was the better disguised Another argument which would have appeared much more convincing had the whole song been transcrib'd but which perhaps will be allowed from this extract is that our ballad has the air of a narrative written before Shakespere's play I mean that if it had been written after the play it would have been much more full and circumstantial At present it has too much the nakedness of an original Besides the first stanza informs us that the story was taken from some Italian novel Thus much therefore is certain that is Shakespere either copied from that Italian novel or from this ballad Now we have no translation I presume of such a novel into English if then it be granted that Shakespere generally took his Italian stories from their English translations and that the arguments above concerning the prior antiquity of this ballad are true it will follow that Shake∣spere copied from this ballad  I shall only add that it appears from S Gosson's Schoole of Abuse printed that the character of a cruell and covetous Jewe had been exhibited with good applause before Shakespere's Shylock appear'd The author is commending some plays and among the rest  "The JEWE and Ptolome shewne at the bull the one representing the greedinesse of wordly chusers and bloudy minds of usurers the other c"  Our author's disapprobation of this practice may be made to appear more fully from his own words  where he hints that Chaucer's language which he so closely copied was the pure English  Dan Chaucer WELL of ENGLISH UNDEFILDE    A learned Lexicographer gives a very different account of the purity of Chaucer's style  "Chaucerus pessimo exemplo integris vocum plaustris ex eadem Gallia in nostram Linguam invectis eam nimis antea a Normannorum victoria adulteratam omni fere nativa gratia nitore spoliavit pro genuinis coloribus sucum illinens pro vera facie larvam induens"  Skinner Praefat ad E∣tymolog Ling Anglic pag  But tho' Spenser disapprov'd of this corrupt adul∣teration of style so fashionable in is age yet we find  him notwithstanding frequently introducing words from a foreign tongue such as visnomie amen∣ance  arret mespise sovenance afrap aguise a∣menage abase and the like but these words the frequent return of his rhyme obliged him to intro∣duce and accordingly they will generally be found at the end of his lines Thus the poverty of our tongue or rather the unfrequency of identical termi∣nations in it often compelled him for the sake of rhyme to coin new English words such as damni∣fy'd unmercify'd wonderment warriment unruli∣ment habitaunce hazardrie c c To this cause his many latinisms may likewise be attributed which like the rest are substituted to make out the necessary jingle  The censure of B Johnson upon our author's style is perhaps unreasonable  "Spenser in affecting the antients writ no language"  Discoveries  The groundwork  and substance of his style is the language of the age in which he lived this indeed is season'd with va∣rious expressions deduced from a remote age but in such a manner that the language of his age was ra∣ther strengthened and dignified than debas'd or dis∣guis'd by such a practice In truth the affectation of Spenser in this point is by no means so striking and visible as Johnson has insinuated nor is our author so obsolete in his style as he is generally thought or represented to be For many stanzas together we may frequently read him with as much facility as we can the same number of lines in Shake∣spere But tho' I cannot subscribe to the opinion of the lastquoted critic concerning our author's recourse to the antients yet I must confess that the fol∣lowing sentiments relating to the same subject are admirable  "Words borrow'd of antiquity do lend a kind of majesty to style and are not without their delight sometimes For they have the autho∣rity of yeares and out of their intermission do lend a kind of gracelike newnesse BUT THE ELDEST OF THE PRESENT AND NEWNESSE OF THE PAST LANGUAGE IS THE BEST"  Ibid  SECT V Of Spenser's Imitations from Chaucer  IT has been before observ'd in general that Spenser copied the language of Chaucer it may with equal truth be affirm'd that he has likewise in many pas∣sages  imitated the sentiment of Chaucer and I shall now proceed to give some specimens of his imitati∣on in both these particulars  B i C i S viii  Much can they praise the trees so straight and hie  The sayling pine the cedar proud and tall  The vineprop elme the poplar never dry  The builder oake sole king of forrests all  The aspine good for staves the cypresse funerall  ix  The Laurell meed of mighty conquerours  And poets sage the firre that weepeth still  The willow worne of forlorne paramours  The eugh obedient to the benders will  The birch for shafts the sallow for the mill  The myrrhe sweetbleeding in the bitter wound  The warlike beech the ash for nothing ill  The fruitfull olive and the platane round  The carver holme the maple sildom inward sound  Met  Ovid  Oedip  Seneca    Lucan  Theb  Statius and  R Proserp  The passages are alleged by Mr Jortin remarks on Spenser's poems p  Claudian have all left us a description of trees  but Spenser in this before us seems more imme∣diately to have had his favourite Chaucer in his eye he has however much improv'd upon the brevity and simplicity of our antient bard  The bilder oke and eke the hardie asshe  The piller elme the coffir unto caraine  The boxe pipetree holme to whips lasshe  The sailing firre the cipres death to plaine  The shooter ewe the aspe for shaftes plaine  The olive of peace and eke the dronken vine  The victor palme the laurer to divine  The assemble of fowles v  In Chaucer's Complaint of the blacke knight we meet with another description of trees from which Spenser seems also to have drawn one or two circumstances  The mirre also that wepith ever' of kinde  The cedris hie as upright as a line  V  Spenser perhaps in having given us this minute and particular enumeration of various trees has incurred a smaller share of censure than some of the Roman authors mentioned above In some of them indeed such a description will be found superfluous and im∣pertinent but upon this occasion it is highly con∣sistent and indeed expedient that the poet should dwell for some time on the beauty of this grove in describing its variety of trees as that circumstance tends to draw the redcross knight and his compa∣nion farther and farther into the shade 'till at length  they are imperceptibly invited to the cave of error which stood in the thickest part of it in short this description is so far from being puerile or illplaced that it serves to improve and help out the allegory But notwithstanding this may be affirm'd in com∣mendation of Spenser yet I am apt to think that the impropriety of introducing such a description would not have appear'd a sufficient reason to our poet why he should not have admitted it for his judgment was so greatly overwhelm'd by his imagination that he could never neglect the opportunity of a good de∣scription whenever it presented itself The reader will excuse my producing another passage from Chaucer in which he ridicules with no less humour than judg∣ment the particular detail of trees and of the circum∣stances which follow'd upon their being fell'd given us by one of the abovemention'd antient poets He is speaking of Arcite's funeral  But how the fire was maken up on height  And eke the names how all the trees hight  As oke firre beech aspe elder elme popelere  Willow holme plane boxe chesten and laurere  Maple thorne beech ewe hasell whipultree  How they were feld shall not be told for me  Ne how the gods runnen up and down  Disherited of her habitatioun  In which they wonned in rest and pees  Nymphes Faunies Amadriades  Ne how the beasts ne how the birds all  Fledden for feare when the trees was fall  Ne how the groun agast was of the light  That was not wont to see the sonne bright  Ne how the fire c  Knight's tale v  B i C xii S xiv  The poet is speaking of the magnificent feasting af∣ter the redcrosse knight had conquer'd the dragon  What needs me tell their feast and goodly guise  In which was nothing riotous nor vaine  What needs of dainty dishes to devise  Of comely services or courtly traine  My narrow leaves cannot in them containe  The large discourse of royal princes state  To this I shall beg leave to subjoin another passage of the same kind in which he is describing the wedding of Florimel  To tell the glory of the feast that day  The goodly service the devisefull sights  The bridegroomes state the brides most rich aray  The pride of ladies and the worth of knights  The royall banquetts and the rare delights  Were worke fit for an herauld not for me    After this indirect and comprehensive manner Chau∣cer expresses the pomp of Cambuscan's feast  Of which shall I tell all the array  Then would it occupie a sommer's day  And eke it needeth not to devise  At every course the order of service  I wol not tellen as now of her strange sewes  Ne of her swans ne of her heronsewes  Eke in that lond as tellen knights old  There is some meat that is fully dainty hold  That in this lond men retch of it but small  There is no man that may reporten all  Squire's tale v  Thus also when lady Custance is married to the Sow∣dan of Surrie  What shuld I tellen of the rialte  Of that wedding or which course goth beforn  Who blowith in a trompe or in a horne  The man of lawe's tale v  In these passages it is very evident that Chaucer in∣tended a burlesque upon the tedious and elaborate de∣scriptions of such unimportant circumstances to be met with in books of chivalry In the last verse the burlesque is very strong  B i C xii S xxiv  He is speaking of a grand assembly which is held in the hall of the palace of Una's father  With flying speed and seeming great pretence  Came running in much like a man dismaid  A messenger with letters which his message said  xxv  All in the open hall amazed stood  At suddennesse of that unwarie sight  And wondred at his breathlesse hastie mood  But he for nought would stay his passage right  Till fast before the king he did alight  Where falling flat great humblesse he did make  And kist the ground whereon his foot was pight  He seems to have copied this surprise occasion'd in the hall by the sudden and unexpected entrance of this messenger together with some of the attending circumstances from a similar but more noble surprise in Chaucer which happen'd at Cambuscan's annual birthday festival  And so befell that aftir the third course  While that the king sat thus in his noblay  Herk'ning his minstrelis their thingis play  Beforn him at his bord deliciously  In at the halle dore full sodeinly  There came a knight upon a stede of brass  And in his hond c c  * * * * * * * * * * *  And up he rideth to the hie bord  In all the hall ne was there spoke a word  For marveile of this knight him to behold  Full besily they waiten yong and old  This straunge knight c  * * * * * * *  Salved the king and quene and lordis all  By ordir as they sittin in the hall  With so hie reverence and obeisaunce  As well in speche as in countinaunce  That c c  * * * *  And aftir this beforn the hie bord  He with a manly voice saide his message  Squier's tale v  B ii C xii S li  Thereto the heavens alwaies joviall  Lookt on them lovely still in stedfast state  Ne suffred storme nor frost on them to fall  Their tender buds or leaves to violate  Nor scorching heat nor cold intemperate  T' afflict the creatures which therein did dwell  But the milde aire with season moderate  Gently attempred and dispos'd so well  That still it breathed forth sweet spirit and holesome smell  Chaucer in the Assemble of fowles  The air of the place so attempre was  That never was ther grevance of hot ne cold  There was eke every holesome spice and gras  Ne no man may there waxe sicke ne olde  V  As a proof of this imitation it may be observ'd that Spenser has not only here borrow'd some of Chaucer's thoughts but some of his words He might never∣theless have some passages from the  Claudian N Hon Mar v Lucret v Hom Odyss v Sidon Car v  classics in his eye cited by Mr Jortin  Remarks p  B iii C ii S xix  The poet among other rare qualities of Merlin's wondrous mirrour mentions the following  Whatever foe had wrought or friend had fayn'd  Therein discovered was  And afterwards St  Such was the glassie globe that Merlin made  And gave unto king Ryence for his guard  That never foes his kingdom might invade  But he it knew at home before he hard  Tidings thereof and so them still debard  It was a famous present for a prince  And worthy worke of infinite reward  That treasons could bewray and foes convince  From whence it is plain that Spenser drew the idea of this mirrour from that which is presented by the strange knight to Cambuscan in Chaucer  This mirror eke which I have in my hond  Hath soche a might that men may in it se  Whan there shall fall any adversite  Unto your reigne or to yourself also  And opin se who is your frend or fo  And ovir all if any lady bright  Hath set her hert on any manir wight  If he be false she shall the tresoun se  His newe love and all his subtilte  So opinly that there shall nothing hide  Squier's tale v  Spenser likewise feigns that his mirror was of service in the purposes of love and as such it is consulted by Britomartis but upon an occasion different from that which is here mention'd by Chaucer She looks in it to discover who was destin'd to be her husband  Whom fortune for her husband would allott  St  As the uses of this mirror were of so important a na∣ture Spenser ought not to have first mention'd it to us by that light appellation Venus' looking glass where he is speaking of Britomart's love for Arthegall  Whose image she had seen in Venus' lookingglass    B

On fame's eternall beadroll worthy to be filed  The Squiers tale of Chaucer being imperfect  Not unfinish'd for a very good reason offer'd by the judicious Mr Upton who says  "I hardly think that a story promising so fair in the beginning should be left halftold"  Letter to G West  Esq  p  our poet thus introduces his story of the battle of the three brethren for Canace which he builds upon the fol∣lowing hint of Chaucer  And after woll I speke of Camballo  That fought in listis with the brethren two  For Canace er that they might her winn  But with these lines the story breaks off  Mr Upton  Ubi supra p  calls this addition of Spenser to Chaucer's fragment a completion of the squier's tale but it is certainly nothing more than a completion of one part or division of Chaucer's poem for besides what Chaucer propos'd to speak of in the verses abovequoted concerning the contest for Canace he intended likewise to tell us  How that this Falcon got her love againe  Repentant as the story tellith us  By mediation of Camballus  Squier's tale v  Also  First woll I tell you of king Cambuscan  That in his time many a cite wan  How that he wan Thedora to his wife  And after woll I speke of Algarsife  For whom full oft in grete peril he was  Ne had ben holpin but by th' hors of bras  ibid v  It is no less amusing to the imagination to bewilder itself in various conjectures concerning the expedients  by which the particular events here hinted at were se∣verally brought about and to wander into a romantic disquisition concerning the miracles wrought by the means of this wonderful steed than it is matter of concern to reflect that Chaucer's description of them is utterly lost especially as we may reasonably con∣clude from the remaining parts of this tale that those which are perish'd must have discover'd no less striking efforts of the imagination It appears that Milton was particularly fond of this poem and that he was not a little desirous of knowing the end of a story which promis'd so many beauties in his Il Pen∣seroso he invokes Melancholy to  call up HIM that left HALFTOLD  The story of Cambuscan bold  Il Pens v  But for what reason are we to suppose that he desir'd him to be CALL'D UP Was it not for this reason that he might tell that part of the HALFTOLD tale which re∣main'd untold as before he requests that Orpheus might be rais'd to sing  Such notes as warbled to the string  Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek  Ibid v  so he does not desire that Chaucer should be called up for nothing but that this author of the imperfect tale of Cambuscan should likewise tell  Of Camball and of Algarsife  And who had Canace to wife  That own'd the virtuous ring and glass  And of the wondrous horse of brass  On which the Tartar king did ride  Ibid v  circumstances and events which are not in the halftold story which Chaucer hath left us but which are only propos'd to be told in the verses above cited and are the subject of the sequel  Lydgate in his TEMPLE OF GLAS seems to speak as if he had seen a completed copy of this Tale  And uppermore men depeinten might see  How with her RING goodly CANACE  Of everie fowle the leden and the song  Could understand as she hem walkt among  And how her brother so often holpen was  In his mischefe by the STEDE OF BRAS  That part of the story which is hinted at in the two last lines is lost which however might have been remaining in the age of Lydgate  In the Ashmolean Musaeum at Oxford there is a completion of this tale by John Lane in MS It is number'd in the catalogue and in the first leaf but on the back quarto The title of this MS is as follows  "CHAUCER'S PILLER beinge his masterpiece called the SQUIER'S TALE which hath binn given for lost for allmost theese three hundred yeares but now found out and brought to light by JOHN LANE "  I conceiv'd great expectations of this manuscript on reading the following passage in Philips  "JOHN LANE a fine old Queen Elizabeth's gentleman who was living within my remembrance and whose several poems had they not had the ill luck to remain unpub∣lish'd when much better meriting than many that are in print might possibly have gain'd him a name not inferior if not equal to Drayton and others of the next rank to SPENSER but they are all to be produced in MSS namely his POETICAL VISION his ALARM TO POETS his TWELVE MONTHS his GUY OF WARWICK an

upon perusal appear'd to be not only a very inartificial imitation of Chaucer but a very weak effort of imagination  I cannot omit this opportunity of lamenting with equal regret the loss of great part of a noble old Scottish poem entitled HARDYKNUTE which exhibits a striking representation of our antient mar∣tial manners that prevail'd before the conveniency and civilities of refin'd life had

his plaint of kindes describ'd it well  The lastquoted stanza is no obscure hint that our poet had been consulting Chaucer's Assembly of fowles for this description of NATURE But Spenser has given many new and delicate touches to Chaucer's rough sketch as will appear upon comparison  Tho was I ware where there ysate a quene  That as of light the sommer sonne shene  Passith the sterre right so

antients have left us no authority for such a representation of Cupid Our author St above gives him a green vest  And Cupidselfe about her fluttred all in greene  Which is equally unwarrantable Though Catullus has given him a yellow vest  Quam circumcursans huc illuc saepe Cupido  Fulgebat  CROCINA  candidus in tunica  Ad Manlium  Where Scaliger remarks that Sappho attributes a purple vest to this

Darraine is often used by Chaucer  The everich should an hundred knights bring  The battle to DARRAIN  Knight's tale v  Full privily two harneis had he dight  Both sufficient and mete to DARRAINE  The battail in the field betwixt them twaine  Ibid v  The word seems to be de deriv'd from the French  ar∣ranger  so that to darraine battle is to set the battle in array Our poet has used arrang'd from  arranger  and applied it to battle more than once  So both to battel fierce ARRANGED are    ARRANG'D in battle new    Chaucer in another place uses darraine in a sense not agreeable to its genuine signification  Everich of you shall bring an hundred knights  * * * * * * * * * *  Alredy to DARRAIN here by battaile  Ibid  Where it should imply TO DETERMINE This word being a Chaucerism our author has very remarkably affected the use of it viz  sad battaile to DARRAINE    to DARRAINE  A triple warre    six knights that did DARRAINE  Fierce battaile against one    new battaile to DARRAINE    new battaile to DARRAINE    And dreadfull battle 'twixt them do DARRAINE    In which they two the combat might DARRAINE    Those giants which did warre DARRAINE  Against the heavens    We have here an instance in which the word is used in a more vague sense  How best he mote DARRAINE  That enterprize    But we are told in the glossary to Chaucer Urry's edit that this word among other senses signifies  to dare to attempt  Thus by a gradual detortion and by an imperceptible progression from one kindred sense to another a word at length attains a meaning en∣tirely foreign to its original etymology  Spenser's frequent use of DARRAINE seems to have somewhat familiaris'd it in Queen Elizabeth's age We meet with it in Shakespere who probably drew it from our author  DARRAIGN your battle they are near at hand  Third Part of Hen VI Act S  B i C vii S xxix  His GLITTERAND armor shined far away  Spenser thus affectedly spells the participle glittering in imitation of Chaucer So in the Plowman's tale  That high on horse willeth ride  In GLITTERANDE gold of great array  V  And in the same poem  With GLITTERANDE gold as grene as gall  V  Glitterand is very frequently used by our author  Soone as those GLITTERAND armes he did espy    Eftsoones himselfe in GLITTERANDE arms he dight    Her glorious GLITTERAND light doth all mens eyes amaze    We meet with it likewise in the Eclogues  Ygirt with bells of GLITTERAND GOLD  July  Many of Chaucer's active participles are thus termi∣nated viz sittande smertande laughande c for sitting smarting laughing We meet with this ter∣mination of the active participle very frequently in the antient Scotch poets  B i C vii S xiv  Doe him not to die  Chaucer  doen to die  These losengeours with her flatterie  Rom Rose v  The instances of this expression are innumerable both in Chaucer and in our author  B ii C ii S xxii  And suffred not their blowes to BITE him nere  That is to pierce him to the quick The word is frequently used in the sense to pierce or wound in Chaucer  Ne short sword to stick with point BITING  No man ne draw  Knight's tale  And made his sword deep in his flesh YBITE  Ibid  The jealous strokes on their helmes BITE  Ibid  Speaking of a sword afterwards  Throughout his armure it will kerve and BITE  Also  But in his sleve he gan to thring  A rasour sharpe and wellBITING  Rom Rose v  Nor are instances of this word less frequent in Spenser viz  The cruell steele so greedily doth BITE  In tender flesh    His BYTING sword and his devouring speare    That first did teach the cursed steele to BITE  In his own flesh    The pointed steele  His harder hide would neither  pearce  nor BITE    The sharpe steele arriving forcibly  On his broad shield BIT not    A stroke  And glauncing

deadly it imprest    That glauncing on her shoulderplate it BIT  Unto the bone    But BYTING deepe therein    i e into his shield  The tempred steele did not into his brainepan BITE    And we find another instance of  biting near  for  piercing  to the quick  Much was the lady in her gentle mind  Abasht at his rebuke that BIT her neare    And in this manner we find it used by Shakespere  Freeze freeze thou bitter sky  Thou dost not BITE SO NIGH  As benefits forgot  As You Like it Act  B ii C iv S xxiv  Saying he now had boulted all the floure  That is he had search'd the matter to the bottom

Urry's edit  We find it again in our author  HARROW the flames which me consume    Again  HARROW and  wealaway  After so wicked deed c    It occurs often in Chaucer and is I think always used as an exclamation of GRIEF but there are some passages in an old MYSTERY printed at Paris where it is applied as a term of ALARM according to its original usage Lucifer is introduced summoning the devils  Dyables meschans c  * * * *  Viendrez vous point a mes cris aboys  * * * * * * *  HARO HARO  nul de vous je ne veoys  And in another place where he particularly addresses Belial  HARO HARO  approche

of Licence prefix'd to books printed in France  B iii C i S lxiv  To stir up strife and troublous CONTECK broche  Spenser here when he might have used  contest  chuses rather Chaucer's obsolete term CONTECK Thus in the Knight's tale  CONTEKE with bloody knyves and shape menace  V  Again  Of CONTEKE and of whelpis gret and light  Nonne's Priest's tale v  Our poet had us'd it before in the Eclogues

place he refers to history for a sanc∣tion to his invention  As ye may elsewhere read that ruefull history    Chaucer frequently makes use of these forms He thus begins the Knight's tale  Whylom as

straughten  Unto her heeles downe they raughten  Rom Rose v  And in the same poem  Her haire downe to her heeles went  Ibid  Our author again expresses himself in the same man∣ner speaking of a robe  When she list it raught  Down to her lowest heele    Also  Her golden lockes that were upbound  Still in a knott unto her heeles downe traced    This mention of golden hair puts me in mind of a correction which Mr Upton has made in the follow∣ing verse of Chaucer  Her GILDED heris with a GOLDEN thread  Iboundin were  Assemble of Fowles v  Mr  Letter to G West  Esq  p  Upton thinks that here is a transposition oc∣casion'd by the transcriber's haste and that we should apply  gilded  to  threde  and  goldin  to  heris  viz  Her  goldin  heris with a  gilded  threde  Iboundin were  The alteration appears at first sight to be very just But it is perhaps unnecessary if we consider that  gilte  or  gilded  is often us'd by Chaucer and applied to hair Thus  His GILT here was ycrounid with a son  Leg of G Women v  And in the same poem  Hide Absolon thy GILTE tressis clere  Ibid v  We have here  gildid  hair  Dischevilid with her bright GILDID here  Ibid v  B iii C ix S xxxi  Thus

Merchant's second tale or the History of Beryn  When it Rome was governed by the DOSEPERIS  V  And below  Then Constantyne the third after these DOSIPERIS  v  It may be doubted whether or no our author borrow'd this word DOUZEPERE from Chaucer for Chaucer's tale in which the word occurrs was first printed by Mr Urry who informs us that he could meet with only one MSS copy of it  B iii C xii S xi  With him went DANGER  Spenser seems to have personified danger after the ex∣ample of Chaucer who has made him a very signifi∣cant character in the Romaunt of the rose but I do not remember that any circumstances in Spenser's description of him are borrow'd from thence He is again introduc'd as the guardian of the gate of good desert in the temple of Venus and after∣wards as an advocate for Duessa  B iv C i S xxxii  His name was BLANDAMOUR  There was an old romance which celebrated the atchievments of Blandamour which Spenser might have seen If not he probably drew the name from this

sparke of fire that from the anvil GLODE  The compiler of the Glossary to Spenser informs us that GLODE signifies  glanc'd  or that it is written by poetical licence for  glowed  As to the latter of these explanations I do not think that  glow  had acquired so vague a sense in our author's age and where is the authority for the former Spenser un∣doubtedly borrow'd it from the following passage of Chaucer  His good steede he bestrode  And forth upon his way GLODE  As sparke out of the bronde  Ibid v  Our author has here plainly borrow'd the thought as well as the particular word in question which however he has differently applied May not GLODE be the preterimperfect tense of  glide  B v C i S xxv  This doubtfull causes right  Can hardly but by sacrament be tride  Or else by Ordele  Tr

lamb she LAD whom they LAD a wretched life they LAD life which afterwards he LAD to their purpose  LAD The virgin LAD he him LAD away was LAD  Our author seems to have used  never none  for  there never was one  from an affectation of Chaucer's manner altho' it must be confess'd that most of our old English writers frequently join two negatives when no affirmation is intended Hickes after ob∣serving that a negation is often express'd in the AngloSaxonic by two negatives has these words  Editor Chauceri nihil antiqui sapiens dicit  "It is his manner likewise imitating the Greekes by two negatives to cause a greater negation as  I ne said none ill  "  Speght's ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READERS prefix'd to his second edition of Chaucer's works London printed by Adam Islip  But the labours of this editor ought by no means to be slighted in general as he is the first that ever gave to the public a tolerably complete edition of Chaucer and though he is censur'd as one  Antiqui nihil sapiens  yet it must be confess'd that his glossary to Chaucer as being the first of that kind was a very laudable un∣dertaking and tho' it was the first that it is notwithstanding so well executed as to have supplied very valuable materials to some more modern glossographers upon our antient bard  ipsum imi∣tatum fuisse Graecos in vehementius negando per  DUO NEGATIVA  tametsi Chaucerus Literarum Graecarum ignarus more sui temporis in quo Saxonismus non peni∣cus exoleverat  DUOBUS NEGATIVIS  est usus  Linguarum Vett Septentrional Thesaurus cap pag    After which he produces some instances in the Saxon where not only two but three and four negatives are put together with a negative signification  It is not pretended that all the obsolete words and phrases to be met in our author are here set down  but those only which carry with them a more certain and undoubted evidence of their being immediately derived from Chaucer Thus here are several old old words unnoticed which appear likewise in Chau∣cer but which are no more the property of him than they are of Lidgate of Gower and of the au∣thor of Piers Plowman so that it would be difficult in some cases to ascertain and mark out the particular source from which our author drew however it is manifest that he had the most frequent recourse to and drew the largest draughts from Chaucer  The well of English undefilde  I cannot dismiss this section without a wish that this neglected author whom Spenser proposed in some mea∣sure as the pattern of his language and to whom he is not a little indebted for many noble strokes of poetry should be more universally and attentively studied Chau∣cer seems to be regarded rather as an old poet than as a good one and that he wrote English verses four hundred years ago seems more frequently to be urged in his commendation than that he wrote four hun∣dred years ago with taste and judgment We look upon his poems rather as venerable relics than as finish'd patterns as pieces calculated rather to gratify the antiquarian than the critic When I sate down to read Chaucer with the curiosity of knowing how the first English poet wrote I left him with the satisfaction of having found what later and more refin'd ages could hardly equal in true humour pathos or sublimity It must  be confest that his uncouth or rather unfamiliar lan∣guage has deterr'd many from perusing him but at the same time it must be allowed that nothing has more contributed to his being little looked into than the convenient opportunity of reading him with faci∣lity in modern imitations Thus when translation for such may imitations from Chaucer be call'd be∣comes substituted as the means of attaining the knowledge of any difficult and antient author the original not only begins to be neglected and excluded as less easy but also to be despised as less ornamental and elegant And thus tho' Mr Pope's translation of Homer is perhaps the best that ever was made of any author yet it has so far indulg'd the laziness or illi∣teracy of many readers as to tempt them to acquiesce in the knowledge of Homer acquir'd by it as suffici∣ent and thus many have preferr'd that translation to the Graecian text in proportion as the former contains more frequent and more shining metaphors more lively descriptions and in general appears to be more full elaborate and various  SECT VI Of Spenser's imitations from Ariosto  B i C i S xxix  THIS circumstance of the Redcross knight and Una meeting with Archimago disguised like a hermit who tells them a feign'd tale and after that raises two spirits with an intent to deceive the Red∣cross  Knight seems to be copied from Ariosto who introduces Angelica meeting with an hypocritical hermit who raises a false spirit with a design to de∣ceive Sacrapant and Renaldo and to exasperate them against Orlando c  Che scontro un' eremita c  C S  But Spenser has greatly improv'd the hint Archi∣mago is again introduc'd after the same manner B i C vi S xxxiv and B ii C i S viii  B i C ii  This illusion effected by Archimago who discovers a fictitious Una to the Redcross Knight in the em∣braces of a young 'squire seems to be imitated from the

price and of more gracious powre  Is this then that same water of Ardenne  The which Renaldo drunke in happy houre  Described by that famous Tuscane penne  For that had might to change the harts of men  From love to hate  That famous Tuscan pen Ariosto describes two foun∣tains in Ardenna from one of which Renaldo drinks and from the other Angelica  E questo hanno causato duo fontane  Che di diverso effetto hanno liquore  Ambe in Ardenna e non sono lontane  D' amoroso disio l' una empie il core  Che bee dell' altra senza amor rimane  E volge tutto in ghiaccio il primo ardore  Rinaldo

others vew  Who tastes the one loves dart his heart doth strike  Contrarie of the other doth ensew  Who drinke thereof their lovers shall mislike  Renaldo dranke of one and love much pained him  The other drank this damsell and disdained him  Harrington  By Spenser's account of this WATER of ARDENNE it might be concluded that Rinaldo drank of that fountain which turn'd love into hate but it appears from this  passage in Ariosto that he drank of that fountain which produc'd the contrary effect However it is manifest that our author alludes to another place in Ariosto where Renaldo drinks of that fountain which produc'd the effect here describ'd by Spenser C S  B v C ii S iv  Here beyond  A cursed cruell Sarazin doth wonne  That keepes a bridges passage by strong hand  And many errant knights hath there foredonne  Thus the pagan in Ariosto keeps a bridge which no man can pass over unless he fight with him and which occasions many combats in the water one of which sort is here describ'd between Sir Arthe∣gall and the Saracen S  In MORTE ARTHUR we find an account of a knight who kept a bridge  B C  in which a circumstance is men∣tion'd not in Ariosto which Spenser seems to have copied from thence in the passage under considera∣tion  "On the third day he rode over a long bridge and there start upon him sodainly a passing fowle chorle and he smote his horse and asked him why he rode over that bridge without his licence"  So Spenser  Who as they to the passage gan to draw  A villaine came to them with scull all raw  That passagemoney did of them require  St  B v C iii

tanta crudelta si prende  D' una  RETE c  C S c  And in this crueltie he hath great sport  To use the service of a certaine net  Harrington  B vi C xi S ii c  Like as is now befalne to this faire maid  Faire Pastorell c  The distress of Pastorella is something similar to that of Isabel who is seiz'd by certain outlaws or pirates and imprison'd in a cave in order to be sold for a slave C S c  It has been before remark'd that Spenser in his BLATANT BEAST had some reference to the story of the  questing  beast mention'd in the romance of MORTE ARTHUR Yet notwithstanding I am apt to think that Spenser in representing scandal under the shape of a monstrous and unnatural beast imitated or ra∣ther vyed with Ariosto who has represented avarice and jealousy under the picture of two hideous beasts the first of which like the BLATANT BEAST attacks all estates alike enters the palace as well the cottage but vents his rage in a more particular manner against the clergy sparing not even the pope himself She is at last supposed to be bound by Leo the tenth as Jealousy is supposed to be driven to her den by Renaldo It is not improbable that Ariosto in adumbrating these violent passions under the figure of beasts form'd of many unnatural combinations might have an eye to the beast in the REVELA∣TIONS which  "rose out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and  the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion"  Revel c v c  See F Q c and Orl Furios c S and c S c  The reader will excuse my adding in this place a passage which Spenser has drawn from his favorite Italian poet in the Mourning Muse of Thestylis  The blinded archerboy  Like Larke in showre of raine  Sate bathing of his wings  And glad the time did spend  Under those crystall drops  Which fall from her faire eyes  And at their brightest beames  Him proynd in lovely wise  Cosi a le belle lagrime le piume  Si bagna Amore e gode al chiaro lume  C S  So the blind god whose force no man can shunne  Sits in her eyes and thence his darts doth fling  Bathing his wings in her cleare crystal streames  And sunning them in her rare beauties beames  Harrington  Though it must be confess'd that Spenser's verses bear a stronger resemblance to these of Nic Archias of a Lady weeping  Tam suavi in pluvia nitens Cupido  Insidebat uti solet volucris  Ramo vere novo ad novos tepores  Post solem accipere aetheris liquores  Gestire pluviae ore blandiendo  I had almost forget to take notice that our author in his Radegunde with her city of females probably had an eye upon Ariosto's land of Amazons  But although Spenser appears to have imitated and consequently to have admir'd Ariosto from a survey of the preceding instances and to have been ambi∣tious of rivalling the Orlando Furioso in composing a poem upon a kindred and similar plan yet it may be affirmed that they were both of a genius entirely different Spenser amidst all his absurdities abounds with beautiful and sublime representations while A∣riosto's strokes of true poetry bear a very signal dis∣proportion in their number to his sallies of roman∣tic imagination he gives us the grotesque for the graceful and extravagance for majesty he frequent∣ly moves our laughter and surprise by the whimsical figures of a Callot but seldom awakens our admira∣tion by the just portraits of a Raphael To confess the truth Ariosto's vein is so far different from Spen∣ser's that it is absolutely comic and infinitely better suited to scenes of humour than to serious and so∣lemn description he so greatly excels in painting the familiar manners that what are call'd his tales are by far the most shining passages in his poem Many of  his similes are likewise the strongest indications of his turn for burlesque  Thus the magician disclosing his enchanted shield to dazzle the fight of Bradamante is compar'd to a cat wantonly playing with a mouse and at last killing it C S Rogero fighting with the orc a seamonster is compar'd to a fly attacking a mastiff and attempting to sting him in various parts of his body C S Alzirdo being slain by Orlando his soldiers are said to make a noise like that of a herd of swine when a wolf has seiz'd one of their little pigs  un tener porco  C S Zerbino hav∣ing first insulted Gabrina and afterwards addressing her in a gentle manner is compar'd to a dog who at first furiously assaults a stran∣ger but afterwards a crust being thrown to him fawns upon him C S Orlando and Mandricard fighting together their weapons being broke to pieces are compar'd to two peasants who are drubbing each other having quarrell'd about a watercourse or boundary of land C S Other examples of this sort are obvious to a reader of Ariosto  But if there should be any readers who from some of the fictions in Orlando would prove that its author was possess'd of an extensive and magnifi∣cent invention let them remember that these are commonly borrow'd from romances and adapted occasionally by the poet to the tenor of his allegory and if it should be granted that some or the greatest part of these were deriv'd from his own fancy yet these as they so enormously transgress the bounds of nature and probability ought by no means to be ad∣mitted as genuine marks of the TRUE POET  SECT VII Of Spenser's Inaccuracies  FEW poets will appear to have written with greater rapidity than Spenser Hurried on by the vehe∣mence of imagination he frequently cannot find time to attend to the niceties of construction or to stand still and revise what he has before written in order to prevent contradiction inconsistency or repetition Hence it is that he not only fails in the connection of single words but of circumstances and not only violates the rules of grammar but those of truth probability and propriety He was more sollicitous about giving bold than exact touches to his figures and was so earnestly intent of forming what was great that he forgot to produce that which was correct So that if with these inaccuracies we consider the irregu∣larity of Spenser's plan in general we may venture to conclude that no poet ever shewed more imagi∣gination with less judgement than the author of the FAERIE QUEENE It may be looked upon as a very officious piece of illnature to draw together these in∣ferior and subordinate faults and  Seek slight faults to find  Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind  But a review of them will tend to explain many pas∣sages in particular in our author and to bring us ac∣quainted with his manner in general  I shall begin with his Elleipses in which the rea∣der will find his omission of the Relative to be fre∣quent  B i C vi

 And their fair faces with salt humour  steepe  steep  for  did  steepOf this sort there is an elleipsis in these lines of Milton's EPITAPH ON THE MARCHIONESS OF WINCHESTER  Her high birth and graces sweet  Quickly  found  a lover meet  The virginquire for her  request  The God that sits at marriagefeast  The poet when he wrote  request  had forgot that his former preterimperfect tense  found  was form'd without the sign  did  It may not be impertinent to remark that the Marchioness lamented in this Epitaph of Milton is probably the same with that celebrated by B Johnson in an  Elegie on the Lady  ANNE PAWLETT  Marchio∣ness of  WINTON the Beginning of which Pope seems to have thought of when he wrote his  Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate  LADY Johnson begins his Elegie  What gentle ghost besprent with April dew  Hayles me so solemnly to yonder yew  And beck'ning wooes me c  In the Underwood  In which strain Mr Pope beautifully breaks out  What beck'ning ghost along the moonlight

re∣member'd when he wrote the following  From shelves to shelves see greedy Vulcan roll  And lick up all their physic of the soul  Dunciad B v  Thus Johnson speaking of a parcel of books  These hadst thou pleas'd either to dine or sup  Had made a meale for VULCAN TO LICK UP  An execration upon Vulcane In the Underwood  I shall now produce some instances of his con∣fused construction  B i C iii S xii  Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand  With sudden fearee her pitcher downe she threw  And fled away for never in that land  Face of faire lady did she ever view  And that dread Lyons looke her cast in deadly hew  After having told us that seeing the Lyon stand by her she fled away for fear he adds that this was because he never had seen a lady before which cer∣tainly was no reason why she should fly from the lyon What our author intended to express here was that  "at seeing the lyon and so beautiful a lady an object never seen before in that country she was affrighted and fled"  B i C vi S v  He gan the fort assaile  Whereof he weend possessed soone to bee  And with rich spoile of ransackt chastitie  Of which he weend soone to bee possessed  is not improper but to be possessed  with rich spoile  c is very inac∣curate Here seems to be likewise somewhat of an elleipsis and I think he should have said  rich spoile of  ITS  ransackt chastitie  B i C x S xl  The fourth appointed by his office was  Poor prisoners to relieve with gracious ayde  And captives to redeeme with price of brass  From Turks and Sarazins which them had staid  And though they faultie were yet well he waid  That God to us forgiveth everie howre  Much more than that why they in bands were layd  The poet says that his office was to relieve PRI∣SONERS and to redeem CAPTIVES with money from Turkish slavery who though guilty of crimes yet he consider'd that God every hour pardons crimes much greater than those for which they were impri∣son'dBy this it should seem that those enslav'd by the Turks were guilty of crimes c but the poet would signify by  they faultie were  the prisoners first mention'd who were deservedly imprison'd on account of their crimes  Another instance of our author's inaccuracy is his tautology or repetition of the same circumstances  B iv C xii S i  For much more eath to tell the starres on hy  Albe they endlesse seeme c  Then to recount the seas posteritie  The difficulty of numbering the deities present at the marriage of Thames and Medway he expresses in the same manner in the stanza immediately preceding  The which more eath it were for mortall wight  To

a few lines before  And soothly it was said by common fame  So long as age enabled him thereto  That he had been a man of mickle name  Renouned much in arms and derring doe  But being aged now and weary too  Of warres delights and worlds contentious toyle  The name of knighthood he did disavow  And hanging up his arms and warlike spoile  From all the worlds incumbrance did himself assoile  C v

her heavenly house  SHE is unnecessary in the last line as FAIRE VENUS is the nominative case Other instances of this fault might be produced  I shall now cite some instances in which he contra∣dicts himself and runs into other absurdities on ac∣count of his forgetting or not reviewing what he had before written and in general from an hasty manner of composition  B i C iv S viii  Speaking of Pride he says she  shone as Titan's ray  And in the following stanza he compares her to Phae∣ton where he says she  Exceeding shone like Phoebus fairest child  S  This is a very striking Anticlimax  B i C

been hitherto represented as entire strangers to each other and it does not appear how Una became acquainted with the name of this new knight  B i C viii S xliii c  It is unnatural that the redcrosse knight should be so suddenly reconcil'd to Una after he had forsaken her for her supposed infidelity and impurity The poet should certainly have express'd an eclaircisse∣ment between them  B vi C xi S li  It was an instance of Sir Calidore's courage to re∣store to Coridon his flocks but not of his courtesie to carry away his love Pastorella The poet should have manag'd the character of his PATRON OF COUR∣TESIE with more art  As Spenser has drawn the character of his hero prince Arthur from history he has limited himself to a particular period of time in which all the events of his poem however fictitious or imaginary are sup∣posed to have happen'd upon this account all disco∣veries made since that particular period of time are  improperly specified and the mention of them may be justly term'd an anachronism Our author has been guilty of one or two faults of this kind which we shall lay before the reader  And evermore their hideous ordinance  Upon the bulwarkes cruelly did play    Spenser should have spar'd this circumstance of firearms Ariosto was more cautious in this matter for tho' he has suppos'd the use of them upon a par∣ticular occasion in the age of Charlemagne yet not∣withstanding he hints that they were soon after∣wards destroy'd and that the use of them was not re∣viv'd till many years after and as the invention so the revival of them is attributed to the devil C S It has been observ'd that Milton copied the invention of firearms from Ariosto and it may fur∣ther be observ'd that Milton in the speech which one of the evil angels makes upon them  They shall fear we have disarm'd  The thunderer of his only dreaded bolt  Par L  has copied from himself in one of his latin epigrams  There are other strokes likewise in Milton's lesser poems which he has transferr'd into his GREAT WORK Thus in SAMSON Agonistes  THRICE SHE ASSAY'D with flatt'ring pray'rs and sighs  And amorous reproaches to win from me  My capital secret c  THRICE I deluded her  v

influence on two most implacable objects which the SITUATION of the Musi∣cian in both cases suggested  The fable of the garden of the Hesperides seems to have affected the imagination of Milton in a very particular manner as his allu∣sions to it are most remarkably frequent viz  And LADIES of th' HESPERIDES  PAR REG  But Beauty like the fair HESPERIAN TREE  Laden with blooming gold  COMUS  All

 CANTUS  ubi choreisque furit lyra mista beatis  Epitaphium  DAMONIS  I shall conclude this tedious note with observing that Milton's genius for describing DIVINE things which shines with so distin∣guished a lustre in the PARADISE LOST discover'd itself in some of his most early productions In the juvenile poems we meet with frequent descriptions of the bliss and splendor of heaven of the glory of celestial beings of angelic music and of other objects placed  Beyond the visible diurnal sphere  of this a passage cited above as is the ode on the NATIVITY on the CIRCUMCISION at a SOLEMN MUSIC c c are testimonies Even at the age of seventeen we find that a disposition to conceive images of this sort began to dawn in his imagination  Donec  NITENTES  ad  FORES  Ventum est olympi

Lincolne greene  It would be difficult to prove that a manufacture of green cloth subsisted at Lincoln in the age of king Arthur and indeed if it could we should not readily dispense with the poet's

MUNIFICENCE our author signifies  defence  or  for∣tification  from  munio  and  facio  This is a word very injudiciously coin'd by Spenser as the same word in our language signifies quite another

of less taste than learning of less judgment than ostentation have taken infinite pains to point out those passages which their respective authors have imitated from others  The curious reader is more particularly referr'd to that exten∣sive and elaborate series of quotation entitled  "VIRGILIUS COL∣LATIONE SCRIPTORUM GRAECORUM ILLUSTRATUS OPERA IN∣DUSTRIA FULVII URSINI  This enquiry is executed with a modest reserve and extended no far∣ther than to those passages which are distinguish'd with more indubitable evidences of transcription or imitation might it should seem prove equally instructive and entertaining as it would the better enable us to regu∣late our idea of the merit and character of an author by ascertaining what degree of genuine invention is to be allow'd him and by shewing how far he has im∣prov'd the materials of another by his own art and man∣ner of application at the same time that it must ne∣cessarily gratify the inquisitive disposition of every reader But where there are even the most apparent traces of likeness how very seldom can it be affirm'd with any truth as a late very sagacious critic  See A DISCOURSE on POETICAL IMITATION  has amply prov'd that an imitation was intended and how few of the commentators abovemention'd are there who do not to use his own words mistake RESEM∣BLANCES  for THEFTS  It is true in general that parallellists mistake resemblances for thefts but this assertion by no means affects the instances which I have given in two former sections of Spenser's imitations from Chaucer and Ariosto Spenser is universally acknowledg'd to have been an attentive reader and profess'd admirer of both those poets his imitations from the former are most commonly LITERAL and what he has copied from the latter are ARTIFICIAL FICTIONS which consisting of UNNATURAL COMBINATIONS could not on account of their SINGULARITY be fallen upon by both poets  accidentally  as NATURAL APPEARANCES might be which lie  expos'd  and  obvious  to all at all times so that we may safely pro∣nounce the resemblances produc'd in the sections abovemention'd to have been INTENDED  As this then is a business which proceeds upon an uncertain foundation afford∣ing the amusement of conjecture rather than the satis∣faction of truth it may perhaps be a more serviceable undertaking to produce an author's IMITATIONS OF HIMSELF and this will be more particularly useful in the three following respects viz It will discover the FAVORITE IMAGES of an author it will teach us how VARIOUSLY he expresses the same thought and it will often EXPLAIN DIFFICULT passages and words  B i Introduct S  Faire Venus sonne that with thy cruell dart  At that good knight so cunningly didst rove  * * * * * * * * * *  Lay now thy deadly heben

the pointing seems to be wrong  There entertain him all the saints above  In solemn troops and sweet societies  Who sing and singing in their glory move  According to the present pointing the sense is  "The saints who are in solemn troops and sweet societies entertain him"  or entertain him in among their solemn troops and sweet societies but if the comma was struck off after  Societies  another and more beautiful meaning would be introduced viz  "The saints who SING IN solemn troops and sweet societies entertain him c"  B ii C iii S xxiv  Of Belphaebe speaking  And twixt the pearles and

also in those pageauntes were paynted the thynges that the verses over them dyd in effecte declare which verses here folowe  In the first pageaunt was painted a boy playing at the top and squyrge and over this pageaunt was written as followeth  CHILDHODE  I am called CHILDHODE in play  all my mynde  To cast a coyte a cokstele and a ball  A toppe can I sett and dryve it in his kynde  But would to

Spenser's females both in the FAERIE QUEENE and in his other poems are all describ'd with yellow hair And in his general de∣scription of the influence of beauty over the strongest men he particularizes golden tresses  And mighty hands forgett their manlinesse  Drawn with the power of an hartrobbing eye  And wrapt in fetters of a GOLDEN TRESSE    Whether this was done in compliment to Q Elizabeth who had yellow hair or in imitation of the Italian poets who give most of their women tresses of this colour I leave to the determination of the reader  B iii C i S xxxvi  Speaking of Venus while Adonis was bathing  And throwe into the well sweet rosemaries  And fragrant violets and pancies trim  And ever with sweet nectar she did sprinkle him  Thus in the Prothalamion  Then forth they all out of their baskets drew  Great store of flowers the honour of the field  That to the sense did fragrant odours yield  All which upon those goodly birds they threw  And all the waves did strew  That like old Peneus waters they did seeme  When downe along by pleasant Tempes shore  Scattred with flowers thro' Thessaly they streeme  To these we may add  And ever as the crew  About her daunct sweet flowres that far did smell  And fragrant odours they upon her threw    The circumstance of throwing flowers into the water is not unlike what Milton says of Sabrina's stream  The shepherds at their festivals  Carol her goodness lowd in rustic layes  And throw sweet garlandwreaths into her streame  Of pancies pinks and gaudy daffadils  Comus v  Statius introduces Love and the Graces sprinkling Stella and Violantilla on their weddingnight with flowers and odours    Nec blandus Amor nec Gratia cessat  Amplexum virides optatae conjugis artus  Floribus innumeris olenti spargere thymbra  Epithalam Sylv B v  And in another place he speaks of Venus pouring the fragrance of Amomum over Earinus in great abundance a circumstance not much unlike that just mention'd

dight sometimes the squirrel wild  He brought to her in bands c  Such presents as these are made by Coridon to Pastorell  And oft when Coridon unto her brought  Or little sparrows stolen from their nest  Or wanton squirrels in the woods farre sought    B i C ix S  staring wide  With stony eyes and hartless hollow hewe  Astonisht stood as one that had espide  Infernall furies with their chaines untide  Spenser often expresses fear or surprize in this manner  As one affright  With hellish fiends or furies mad uprore    The stony feare  Ran to his heart and all his sense dismay'd  Ne thenceforth life ne courage did appeare  But as a man whom hellish fiends have frayd  Trembling long time he stood    Oft out of her bed she did astart  As one with vew of gastly fiends affright    Ne wist he what to thinke or to devise  But like as one whom fiends have made afraid  He long astonisht stood ne ought he said  Ne ought he did but with fastfixed eyes  He gazed still upon that snowy maid    From the passages already alleged and from some some others which I shall produce it will appear that Spenser particularly excells in painting affright confusion and astonishment  Abessa's affright at seeing the Lion and Una    Full fast she fled ne ever lookt behind  * * * * * * *  And home she came where as her mother blind  Sate in eternall night nought could shee say  But suddaine catching hold did her dismay  With quaking hands and other signs of feare  Who full of gastly fright and cold dismay  Gan shut the dore    The behaviour of Abessa and Corecca when Kirkra∣pine was torn in pieces by the Lion  His feareful friends weare out the wofull night  Ne dare to weepe nor seeme to understande  The heavy hap which on them is alight  Afraid lest to themselves the like mishappen might    DESPAIRE has just persuaded the redcrosse knight to kill himself    The knight was much enmoved with his speach  That as a swords point thro' his hart did pearce  And in his conscience made a secret breach  Wellknowing true all that he did reherse  And to his fresh remembrance did reverse  The uglie hue of his deformed crimes  That all his manly powres it did disperse  As he were charmed with inchanted rimes  That oftentimes he quakt and fainted oftentimes  xlix  In which amazement when the miscreant  Perceived him to waver weake and fraile  Whiles trembling horror did his conscience dart  And hellish anguish did his soule assaile  To drive him to despaire and quite to quaile  He shewed him painted in a table plaine  The damned ghosts that do in torments waile  And thousand fiends that do them endlesse paine  With fire and brimstone which for ever shall remaine  l  The sight whereof so throughly him dismaid  That nought but death before his eyes he saw  And everburning wrath before him laid  By righteous sentence of th' Almighties law  Then 'gan the villaine him to overawe  And brought unto him swords ropes poyson fire  And all that might him to perdition draw  And bade him chuse what death he would desire  For death was due to him that had provokt Gods ire  li  But when as none of them he saw him take  He to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene  And gave it him in hand his hand did quake  And tremble like a leaf of aspine greene  And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene  To come and goe with tydings from the hart  As it a running messenger had beene  At last resolv'd to work his final smart  He lifted up his hand that backe againe did start  It is a trite observation that we paint that best which we have felt most Spenser's whole life seems to have consisted of disappointments and distress so that he probably was not unacquainted with the bitter agonies of a despairing mind which the warmth of his imagina∣tion and what was its consequence his sensibility of temper contributed to render doubly severe Unmerit∣ed and unpitied indigence ever struggles hardest with  true genius and a good taste for the same reasons that it enhances the pleasures of life sustains with uncom∣mon torture the miseries of that state  "in which says an incomparable moralist every virtue is obscured and in which no conduct can avoid reproach a state in which chearfulness is insensibility and dejection fullenness of which the hardships are without ho∣nour and the labours without reward"  To these may be added his personage FEAR  Next him was FEAR all arm'd from top to toe  Yet thought himselfe not safe enough thereby  But fear'd each shadow moving to and fro  And his owne armes when glittering he did spy  Or clashing heard he fast away did fly  As ashes pale of hew and wingyheel'd  And evermore on Danger fix'd his eye  'Gainst whom he alwaies bent a brazen shield  Which his right hand unarmed fearfully did wield    Again  When Scudamour those heavy tidings heard  His hart was thrild with point of deadly feare  Ne in his face or blood or life appear'd  But senselesse stood like to amazed steare  That yet of mortal stroke the stound doth beare    A priest of Isis after having heard the dream of Britomart  Like to a weake faintharted man he fared  Thro' great astonishment of that strange sight  And with long locks upstanding stiffly stared  Like one adawed with some dreadfull spright    Other instances of this sort might be cited but these are the most striking  It is proper to remark in this place that Spenser has given three large descriptions much of the same nature viz The Bower of Bliss The Gardens of Adonis And the Gardens of the Temple of Venus all which though in general the same his invention has diversified with many new circumstances as it has likewise his Mornings and perhaps we meet with no poet who has more re∣quently or more minutely at the same time de∣lineated the Morning than Spenser He has intro∣duced two historical genealogies of future kings and princes of England and beside two or three other shorter sketches of English history He often repeatedly introduces his allegorical figures which he sometimes describes with very little variation from his first representation particularly DISDAIN FEAR ENVY and DANGER In this poem we like∣wise meet with two hells and  It may not be foreign to the purpose of this Section to lay before the reader some uncommon words and expressions of which Spenser by his frequent use seems particularly fond  B ii C v S xxxii  That round about him dissolute did PLAY  Their wanton follies and light merriment  Spenser often uses the verb PLAY in this sense with an accusative case  A multitude of babes about her hong  PLAYING their sports    The fry of children young  Their wanton sports and childish mirth did PLAY    Then do the salvage beasts begin to PLAY  Their pleasant friskes    But like to angels PLAYING heavenly toyes    PLAYING his childish sport    How Mutability in them doth PLAY  Her cruel sports    And in an Hymne of Love  There with thy daughter Pleasure they do PLAY  Their hurtlesse sports  To these we may add  did SPORT  Their spotlesse pleasure and sweet love's content    We find PLAY used after this manner in Milton  For Nature here  Wanton'd as in her prime and PLAY'D at will  Her virgin fancies  Par Lost v  B i C

 without which it will be difficult to make sense of a passage in our author viz  Some like to hounds some like to apes DISMAYD    Mr Jortin proposes to read MISMADE i e  illshaped  an alteration which we cannot reject when we consi∣der the liberties Spenser took in adding MIS to a word He probably sent it to the press  mismayd  that it might rhyme more exactly and that Spenser was very exact in this point I have before endeavour'd to prove with  assayd  and  arrayd  but the compositors were better acquainted with  dismayd  which they according∣ly adopted  B ii C iv S xliv  When Rancour

convey'd the idea of somewhat very loathsome and horrible to our au∣thor In Virgil's Gnat he applies it to  horror  Nor those same mournfull kingdoms compassed  With RUSTIE horror  I will hence take occasion to correct a passage in Chaucer in the character of the Reve  And by his side he bare a RUSTIE blade  Prolog v  I do not perceive the consistency of the Reves wear∣ing a  rustie  sword I should rather be inclin'd to think that the poet wrote  trustie  blade  And by his side he bare a TRUSTIE blade  B iii C i S lxii  And to her weapon ran in mind to GRIDE  The loathed leachour  Spenser frequently uses GRIDE which signifies to  pierce  This word as E K remarks in the Pastoral of Fe∣bruarie is often used by Lidgate but never once by Chaucer Spenser was very well versed in all our an∣tient English bards but I do not remember that he pays a compliment to any of them Chaucer excepted  Passim  and the  Epilogue to the Aeglogues  author of Pierce Plowman GRIDE is found in the following passages  Whose love hath GRYDE  My feeble breast    An arrow  Secretly did glide  Into his heart which it did sorely GRIDE    Such was the wound that Scudamour did GRIDE    All as I were through the body GRIDE  Februarie  Therewith my soul was sharpely GRIDE  August  A serpent  With brandisht tongue the emptie ayre did GRIDE  Virg Gnat  And again in F Q  Through his thigh the mortall steele did GRIDE    Milton probably adopted this old word from our author  The GRIDING sword with discontinuous wound  Pass'd through him  Par Lost    B ii C iii S xxv  That was ambition rash desire to STIE  To the earl of Essex  Mr Jortin informs us that STIE signifies to  soar  to  ascend  so that the sense of the verse before us is  "that was ambition which is a rash desire of still ascending

It is plainly the old French word  Preste quick  or  nimble  which sometimes is used adverbially Mr Jortin de∣rives it from  praesto adesse  For what art thou  That makst thyself his dayesman to prolong  The vengeance PREST    That is instant or present vengeance  Who him affronting soone to fight was readie PREST    That is readie quickly  In which his work he had sixe servants PREST    That

Ibid v  To speke us harm  That is so ready to speak c  Neither was fowle that commeth of engendrure  That there ne was PREST in her presence  Assemble of fowles  That is that was not present before

much superior learning and pene∣tration by one who intends shortly to oblige his coun∣try with a dictionary of its language a work for which its author is admirably qualified as he has al∣ready given us a specimen of his abilities regarding such a subject if we may judge from a series of essays in which not only criticism and morality have ap∣pear'd with new lustre but from which the English language has receiv'd new grace and dignity  SECT IX Mr Upton's opinion concerning several passages in Spenser examined  AS that part of criticism which consists in rectify∣ing the doubtful readings and explaining the more obscure passages of an antient author necessarily  deals much in conjecture and from its nature can sel∣dom afford demonstration and as those who are em∣ploy'd in this province are too frequently compell'd to deduce their positions not from what is but from that which seems to be the truth no science perhaps pro∣duces a greater diversity of opinions concerning the same point than this That which appears a lucky cor∣rection or alteration to one commentator is rejected by another as absolutely improbable and absurd and indeed the difference of sentiment in this case is dictated by the different manner of conceiving things which nature has implanted in the minds of different persons At the same time it must be acknowledg'd that the pride of appearing more sagacious than our predecessors often occasions the variation here insisted upon and sometimes mere caprice and obstinacy Though in examining some of the ensuing passages I may be deceiv'd as the rest of my brethren have been by the appearance of truth which I have as∣sign'd above as one of the causes of difference of opi∣nion among the critics I can promise the reader that I will not suffer myself to be voluntarily misled by any of the lastmention'd corrupt principles and pre∣judices and upon this account I shall be ready to give up any point which in this Section I shall be proved to have mistaken hoping to find Mr Upton a no less candid man than an ingenious critic  B i C i S xliii  A fit false dream that can delude the sleepers SENT  Mr Upton proposes to read sleepers SHENT i e sleepers illtreated or abus'd But I rather think that we should preserve the common reading SENT which is the proper and original spelling of  scent Sent  says Skinner which we falsely write  scent  is deriv'd  a sentiendo  Thus the meaning of this verse is  "A false dream that could deceive or impose upon the sleeper's perception"  So that  sent  if we consider its  radix sentio  is here plainly made to sig∣nify perception in general  Scent  is often thus spelt in our author  At SENT of strangerguest    Through his perfect SENT    Of sundry SENT and hewe    Scent  is often thus written by Milton and as Dr Newton observes with great propriety  The season prime for sweetest SENTS and airs    the SENT  Of that alluring fruit    such a SENT I drew  Of carnage    With SENT of living carcasses    I confess that SENT is somewhat harsh in this sense but what will not rhyme oblige the poet to say  B i C ii S xix  And at his haughtie helmet making mark  So hugely strooke that it the steele did rive  And rent his head he tumbling downe ALIVE  With bloody mouth his mother earth did kiss  Greeting his grave his grudging ghost did strive  With the fraile flesh at last it flitted is  Whither the soules c  Mr Upton would alter  alive  in the third verse to  bilive  i e  immediately  For says he did he tumble down  alive  after his head was cleft asunder  Such a disquisition would remind one of Burmannus's note on the GEMITU of the dying Turnus in the last verse of the Aeneid  "  Illustrat hunc  GEMITUM  R Titius de illo sono  RAUCO MUR∣MURE  quod ex occlusa vocali arteria editur explicat  "  With∣out entering into an anatomical disquisition concern∣ing the possibility of living after such a blow we may remark that the poet himself intimates to us that he fell down  alive  and did not die till after his fall in these lines  His grudging ghost did strive  With the fraile flesh at last it flitted is  Mr Upton would enforce and confirm the justness of his correction by remarking that the poet in these verses copied from Virgil  Procubuit  MORIENS    HUMUM  semel ore  MOMORDIT  Where the word  moriens  doth not imply that the man who fell down was dead I must confess that  alive  is superfluous but Spenser has run into many other superfluities on account of the frequency of his rhyme Mr Upton proposes likewise to write Earth  His Mother Earth  with an initial capital supposing it a PERSON however we had perhaps better suppose it a THING for if we understand it to be a Person what an absurd mixture arises  His Mother EARTH did kiss  Greeting his GRAVE  Grave cannot be referr'd to Earth as a Person but it may be to Earth as a Thing However it must be confess'd that this is such an absurd mixture as Spen∣ser was very likely to have fallen into and we have numberless instances of this fault in his account of the rivers which attended the marriage of Thames and Medway Where God and River that is Person and Thing are often indiscriminately put the one for the other  B xxiii C iv S i  And a DRY DROPSIE through his flesh did flow  How can a Dropsy  flow  says Mr Upton if it be  dry  He proposes to remove this contradiction by reading  dire  Dropsy the  dirus Hydrops  of Horace But it is plain that  dry Dropsie  is the species of the Dropsy so call'd the  dry Dropsy  or  Tympanites  which Spenser has inaccurately confounded with the other species of the Dropsy which may not improperly be  said to  flow through the flesh  not considering the in∣consistency of making a  dry  thing  flow  As to Mr Upton's correction  dire  I cannot perceive how DIRE could ever be mistaken by the printers for DRY Mr Upton might with equal propriety have objected to the following words DRY  Drops  And with DRY DROPS congealed in her eye    By the way it will be difficult also to determine what Spenser means by  congealed  which occurs again in the same sense and on the same occasion  In whose faire eye  The crystal humour stood congealed round    But upon supposition that the tears were actually frozen in her eye we should think  dry  a very odd epithet for ice  To return By DRY  Dropsie  may not the poet also mean a  Dropsie  which is  the  CAUSE  of thirst  B i C iv S xlii  Him little answer'd th' angry Elfin knight  Mr Upton reads  Him angry  Him angry says Mr Upton means the Paynim who is said to be  enraged  above  Pardon the error of  enraged  wight  S  But because the Paynim is angry doth it necessarily follow that the Elfin knight should not be so too He certainly has reason to be enraged and angry after  that bitter taunt which provokes him to throw down his gauntlet as a challenge It is surely wrong to alter the text when there is neither necessity to re∣quire nor authority to support the correction  B i C v S v  On th' other side in all mens open view  Duessa placed is and on a tree  Sans foy his shield is hang'd with bloody hew  Both those the lawrell garlands to the victor dew  Mr Upton thus reads the last line  Both those AND TH' lawrel garlands to the victor due  But surely Duessa and Sans foy his shield are the lau∣rel garlands that is the rewards to be given to the conqueror Laurel garlands are metaphorically used and put in apposition with Duessa and Sans foy his shield It may be urg'd as another objection to Mr Upton's alteration that Spenser never cuts off the vowel in THE before a consonant upon which ac∣count I would reject Hughes's reading of the follow∣ing line  The Nemaean forest 'till th' Amphitryonide    That editor reads  TH' Nemaean  Hughes's reading indeed restores the true accent to Nemaean but Spenser frequently violates the accent of names of ancient places c  B ii C v S xxii  a flaming fierbrond  Which she in Stygian lake AYE BURNING bright  Had kindled  Mr Upton upon supposition that we refer  aye burn∣ing  to  Fierbrond  does not approve of reading  ayeburning  but  yburning  He is unwilling to join  ay  or  y burning  to  Stygian Lake  for says he the lake of brimstone burnt not  bright  but only serv'd to make darkness visible I allow that Milton's idea of this lake was that it serv'd to make  darkness visible  Par Lost v  But might not Spenser's idea of the Stygian lake be different from Milton's Besides why was the wea∣pon carried to this Lake to be  kindled  unless the Lake was BURNING  The poet has given us the same image and allego∣ry in another place  Firebrand of hell first tind in Phlegethon  By thousand furies    B iii C ii S iii  But ah my rimes too rude and rugged are  When in so high an object they doe lighte  And striving fit to MAKE I feare do MARRE  Mr Upton remarks that MAKE in this passage signifies to  verfify  ΠΟΙΕΙΝ  versus facere  But there is reason to think that  make  is here oppos'd to  marre  in the same sense as it is in the following lines  Likewise unequal were her handes twaine  That one did reach the other pusht away  That one did  make  the other  mard  again    Make  and  Marr  were thus us'd together as it were  proverbially in our author's age Thus Harrington in his Ariosto  In vaine I seeke my Duke's love to expound  The more I seeke to  make  the more I  mard    Yes answer'd Guidon be I  made  or  mard    Ten years will hardly  make  that he would  marr    Thus also G Tuberville to the Countess of War∣wick Ann  Should  make  or  marre  as she saw cause  And in these lines from an old translation of Ovid quoted by the author of the Arte of English Poesie Medea of her children  Was I able to  make  them I pray you tell  And am I not able to  marre  them as well  c  Again in an old bombast play ridicul'd by Shakespere  "And  make  and  marre  the foolish fates"  Midn Dr  Thus then the meaning of the lines before us is  "My verses are quite unpolish'd for so sublime a subject so that I spoil or destroy instead of producing or executing any thing good or perfect"  In the pastoral JUNE  make  is manifestly us'd in the sense  versify  and for this we have moreover the testi∣mony of E K  The god of shepheards Tityrus is dead  Who taught me homely as I can to MAKE  Again in Colin Clouts come home again  Besides her peerlesse skill in MAKING well  And all the ornaments of wondrous wit  That is Q Elizabeth whom in another place he calls  Colin Clout c  a PEERLESSE POETESSE Again  And hath he skill to MAKE so excellent  Yet hath so little skill to bridle Love  Aprill  The author of the Art of English poesie generally uses MAKER for POET ΠΟΙΗΤΗΣ and if we believe Sir J Harrington it was that author who first brought this expression the significancy of which is much com∣mended by Sir P Sydney and B Johnson into fashion about the age of Q Elizabeth  "Nor to dispute how high and supernatural the name of a MAKER is so christned in English by that unknowne godfather that this last year save one viz set forth a booke called the Arte of English Poesie"  Apology for Poesie before Ariosto  B i C vii S xxxiii  But all of diamond perfect pure and  cleene  Mr Upton proposes to read  sheene  instead of CLEENE But if this alteration is necessary here is it not like∣wise equally so in the following verses  And that bright towre all built of crystall CLEENE    Again in sonnet  Leave lady in your glasse of crystall CLEENE  Harrington in a translation of an epigram of James I on Sir Philip Sidney's death uses CLEAN as an epithet to Venus's  carknet  i e a necklace  She threw away her rings and carknet CLEENE  Notes on B of Orl Fur  B v C vii S xiv  And swearing faith to eyther on his blade  Mr Upton observes that we have here an instance of Spenser's learning and that he makes his knights swear by their swords agreeable to that custom among the Goths and Hunns as related by Jornandes and Amm Marcellinus But I am inclin'd to believe that our author drew this circumstance from books that he was probably much better acquainted with old romances In MORTE ARTHUR we have frequent in∣stances of knights swearing in this manner The same ceremony occurs again  He made him sweare  By his own sword    In another place one of the knights swears by his knighthood an oath which we likewise frequently meet with in Romance  As he did on his knighthood sweare    B ii C vi S v  More swift than swallow SHERES the liquid sky  Mr Upton * produces the expression of  sheres the liquid sky  as one of Spenser's Latinisms from RADIT  iter liquidum  and adds that Milton has likewise us'd  the same Latin metaphor I suppose the passage hin∣ted at by Mr Upton is where Satan  SHAVES with level wings the deep  Par Lost B  But  shave  and  shear  are perhaps as different as  rado  and  tondeo  And TONDET  iter liquidum  would I believe be hardly allowed as synonymous to RADIT  iter liquidum  My opinion is therefore that Spenser here intended no metaphor but that he us'd SHERE for  share  to  cut  or  divide  as he has manifestly in these instances  Cymochles sword on Guyons shield yglaunst  And thereof nigh one quarter SHEARD away    "cut away nigh one quarter"  In the following instances for the reason above assign'd we ought to interpret SHEARE shere to  cut  or  divide  Which with their finny oars the swelling sea did SHEARE    And thro' the brackish waves their passage SHEARE    i e cut their way or passage Thus likewise  An eagle that with plumy wings doth SHEARE  The subtile ayre    In another place we have  share  of Arthegall's sword  But wheresoever it did light it throughly SHARD    So Milton of Michael's sword  Deepentring SHAR'D  All his right side  Par Lost    SECT X Of Spenser's Allegorical Character  IN reading the works of an author who lived in a remote age it is necessary that we should look back upon the customs and manners which prevailed in his age that we should place ourselves in his si∣tuation and circumstances that so we may be the bet∣ter enabled to judge and discern how his turn of thinking and manner of composing were biass'd in∣fluenc'd and as it were tinctur'd by very familiar and reigning appearances which are utterly different from those with which we are at present surrounded For want of this caution too many readers view the knights and damsels the turnaments and enchant∣ments of Spenser with modern eyes never consider∣ing that the encounters of Chivalry subsisted in our author's age as has been before hinted  Sect ii  that ro∣mances were then most eagerly and universally read and that thus Spenser from the fashion of his age was naturally dispos'd to undertake a recital of chivalrous atchievements and to become in short a ROMANTIC POET  Nor is it sufficiently consider'd that a prevalent practice of Spenser's age contributed in a very consi∣derable  degree to make him an ALLEGORICAL POET It should be remember'd that in the age of which we are speaking allegory was the subject and foun∣dation of public shews and spectacles which were then exhibited with a magnificence superior to that of former times that the vices and virtues personify'd and represented by living actors distinguish'd with their respective emblematical types were generally in∣troduc'd to constitute PAGEANTRIES which were then the principal entertainments and shewn not only in private and upon the stage but very frequently in the open streets for solemnising any public occasion As a proof of what is here advanc'd I would refer the reader to Hollinshed's  "And to keep that shew companie but yet farre off stoode the SHEWE OF MANHOODE and DESART as first to be pre∣sented and that shewe was as well furnished as the other men all saving one boy called BEAUTIE for the which MANHOOD FAVOUR and DESART did strive or should have contended but GOOD FORTUNE as victor of all conquests was to come in and overthrow MANHOOD c"  Hollingshed's Chron v p  description of the SHEW OF MANHOOD AND DESERT exhibited at Norwich before queen Elizabeth and more particularly to his account of a  Exhibited before the queen at Westminster ibid pag seq See also many other descriptions of this sort in the same author  It is not improbable that Milton in IL PENSEROSO took his thought of hearing music from the earth produc'd by some SPIRIT or GENIUS  And as I wake sweet music BREATH  Above about or UNDERNEATH  From some machinery of Inigo Jones in his Masques Hollinshed mentions something like this in a very curious DEVISE presented before Queen Elizabeth speaking of the music of some fictitious nymphs he adds  "which sure had been a noble hearing and the more melodious for the variety thereof because it should come secretlie and strangelie out of the earth"  Ubi supr p  It may perhaps be readily admitted that Milton drew the whole from what had been represented in a masque  TURNEY performed by Fulke Gre∣vile the lords Arundell and Windsor and sir Philip Sydney who are feign'd to be the children of DESIRE attempting to win the fortresse of BEAUTY in which last spectacle much poetical invention is discover'd  In the mean time I do not deny that our author was in great measure induc'd from the practice of Ariosto to write a poem partaking much of allegory yet it must still be granted that Spenser's manner of allegorizing seems to have rather resulted from some of the spectacles just mention'd than from what he had red in Ariosto In fact Ariosto's allegory does not so much consist in personifying the virtues vices and affections of the mind as it does in adumbrat∣ing moral doctrine  It is affirmed by Plutarch that  "Allegory is that in which one thing is related and another understood"  Thus Ariosto RELATES the adventures of Orlando Rogero Bradamante c by which is UNDERSTOOD the conquest of the passions the excel∣lence of virtue and other moral doctrines on which account we may term the ORLANDO a MORAL poem but can we term the FAERIE QUEEN upon the whole a MORAL POEM is it not e∣qually an HISTORICAL or POLITICAL poem for tho' it be accord∣ing to its author's words an ALLEGORY or DARK CONCEIT yet that which is couched or understood under this allegory is the history and intrigues of Queen Elizabeth's courtiers which how∣ever are introduc'd with a moral design  under the actions of men and  women In such an adumbration Spenser's allegory sometimes consists as in the first book where The Redcrosse Knight or a TRUE CHRISTIAN attended by Una or TRUTH defeats the wiles of Archimago or the DEVIL c c yet he has shewn himself a much more ingenious allegorist where his IMAGINA∣TION BODIES forth unsubstantial things TURNS THEM TO SHAPE and marks out the nature powers and effects of that which is ideal and abstracted by visible and external symbols as in his delineations of FEAR ENVY FANCY DESPAIR and the like Ariosto gives us but few of these symbolical beings in comparison of Spenser and those which he has given us are by no means drawn with that fullness and distinctness with which they are painted by the latter And that Spenser painted these figures so fully and distinctly may we not reasonably attribute it to his being frequently ha∣bituated to the sight of these symbolical beings distin∣guish'd with their proper emblems and actually en∣dued with speech motion and life  As a more convincing argument in confirmation of what has been asserted upon this head it may be re∣mark'd that Spenser denominates his most exquisite groupe of allegorical figures the MASKE OF CUPID thus without recurring to conjecture his own words indubitably demonstrate that he had sometimes repre∣sentations of this sort in his eye he tells us that these figures were  a jolly company  In MANNER of a MASKE enranged orderly    And in his introduction to this groupe it is manifest that he drew from another allegoric spectacle of age called the DUMB SHEW  This consisted of dumb actors who by their dress and action prepar'd the spectators for the matter and substance of each ensuing act respectively as also of much hieroglyphical scenery calculated for the same purpose See GORDOBUCKE a tragedy written by T Sackville lately reprinted by Mr Spence JOCASTA a tragedie written by G Gascoyne and F Kinwelmarshe and acted at Graies Inn and the introduction to S Act of Shakespere's HAMLET  which was wont to be ex∣hibited before

afterwards styles these figures MASKERS  St  The whiles the MASKERS marched forth in trim array  VII  The first was FANCY like a lovely boy  Of rare aspect c  From what has been said I would not have it ob∣jected that I have intended to arraign the natural fertility of our author's invention and to prove that he minutely copied after these representations all that I have endeavoured to inculcate is that Spenser was not only better qualified to delineate fictions of this sort because they were  OCULIS  subjecta fidelibus    Hor Art Poet  Because they were the real objects of his sight but that as all men are influenced by what they see he was prompted and induced to delineate them because he saw them especially as they were so much the de∣light of his age  Instead of entering into an examination of Spenser's manner of allegorising and of the conduct of his allegories in particular which has been done with an equally judicious and ingenious discernment by Mr Spense  Polymet B D  To Mr Spense's examination it may be added that our author frequently introduces an allegory under which no meaning is couch'd viz ALMA is the mind and her CASTLE the body The tongue is the porter of this castle the nose the Portcullis and the mouth the porch about the inside of which are placed twice sixteen warders clad in white which are the teeth these ALMA passes by who rise up and do obeysance to her St But how can the teeth be said to rise up and bow to the mind Spenser here forgot that he was allegorising and speaks as if he was describing without any latent meaning a real queen with twice sixteen real warders who as such might with no improprie∣ty be said to rise and bow to their queen Many instances of his confounding allegory with reality occur through this whole Canto and the two next particularly where he is describing the kitchen of this castle which is the belly he gives us a formal description of such a kitchen as was to be seen in his time in castles and great houses by no means expressive of the thing intended Again the occult meaning of his bringing Scudamore to the house of CARE clashes with what he had before told us By this allego∣ry of Scudamore coming to CARE's house it should be UNDER∣STOOD that  "Scudamore from a happy pass'd into a miserable state"  For we may reasonable suppose that before he came to CARE's house he was unacquainted with CARE whereas the poet had before represented him as involv'd in extreme misery It would be tedious by an allegation of particular examples to de∣monstrate how frequently his allegories are mere descriptions and that taken in their literal sense they have an improper or no sig∣nification veil'd under them I shall however mention one The BLATANT BEAST is said to break into the monasteries to rob their chancels cast down the desks of the monks deface the altars and destroy the images found in their churches By the BLATANT BEAST is understood Scandal and by the havock just mentioned as effected by it is implied the suppression of religious houses and popish superstition But how can this be properly said to have been brought about by scandal and how could Spenser in parti∣lar say this who was as it appears by his pastorals a friend to the reformation as was his heroine Queen Elizabeth  I shall mention one capital fault committed by the poet in this point which does not immediately fall under the rules of criticism  "Painters says a French writer ought to employ their allegories in religious pictures with much greater reserve than in profane pieces They may indeed in such subjects as do not represent the mysteries and miracles of our religion make use of  an allegorical composition the action whereof shall be expressive of some truth that cannot be repre∣sented otherwise either in painting or sculpture I agree therefore to let them draw FAITH and HOPE supporting a dying person and RELIGION in deep affliction at the feet of a deceased prelate But I am of opinion that artists who treat of the mira∣cles and dogmas of our religion are allowed no kind of allegorical compositionThe facts whereon our religion is built and the doctrine it delivers us are subjects in which the painter's imagination has no liberty to sport  Abbe du Bos  Reflexions  c Tom i c xxiv  "  The conduct which this author condemns is practised by Spenser with this difference only that the painters here condemned are supposed to adapt human allegory to divine mystery whereas Spenser has adopted divine mystery to human allegory Such a practice as this is not only to con∣found sacred and profane matters but to place the li∣centious sallies of imagination upon a level with the dictates of divine inspiration to debase the truth and dignity of heavenly things by making Christian alle∣gory subservient to the purposes of Romantic fiction  This fault our author has most glaringly committed throughout his whole first book where the imaginary instruments and expedients of romance are perpetually interwoven with the mysteries contained in the BOOK of REVELATIONS Duessa who is formed upon the idea of a romantic enchantress is gorgeously array'd in gold and purple and presented with a  By the triple crown he plainly glances at popery  triple crown  by the giant Orgoglio and seated by him on a mon∣strous sevenheaded dragon i whose tail reaches to the skies and throws down the stars St she bearing a golden cup in her hand This is the SCARLET WHORE and the RED DRAGON in the REVELATIONS  "Behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to earth  C V  "  Again  "I saw a woman sit upon a scarletcolour'd beast full of names of blas∣phemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet co∣lour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hands full of abomination and filthiness of her fornication  C V  "  In Orgoglio's castle which is describ'd as very magnificent Prince Arthur discovers  An altar carv'd with cunning imagery  On which true Christians blood was often spilt  And holy martyrs often doen to die  With cruel malice and strong tyranny  Whose blessed sprites from underneath the stone  To God for vengeance cride continually    The inspir'd author of the abovenam'd sacred book mentions the same of what he saw in heaven  "I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain  for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on earth  C V  "  A hermit points out to the REDCROSSE knight the New Jerusalem which an angel discovers to St John c c This prospect is taken says the poet from a mountain more lofty then either the mount of Olives or Parnassus these two compa∣risons thus impertinently linked together strongly re∣mind us of the absurdity we are now speaking of the mixture of divine truth with profane invention and naturally lead us to reflect on the difference be∣tween the oracles frequently utter'd from the former and the fictions of those who dreamt on the latter  Spenser in the visionary dominions of Una's father has planted the TREE of LIFE and KNOWLEDGE from the first of the trees he says a well flow'd whose waters contain'd a most salutary virtue and which the dragon could not approach Thus in the same scripture  "He shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb In the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the TREE of LIFE  C V  "  The circumstance in par∣ticular of the dragon not being able to approach this water is literally adopted from Romance as has been before observ'd  Sect ii  Thus also by the steps and expe∣dients  of romance we are led to the death of the dra∣gon who besieged the parents of Una by which is figur'd the destruction of the old serpent mention'd in the Apocalypse  The extravagancies of Pagan Mythology are not improperly introduced into a poem of this sort as they are acknowledged falsities or at best if expres∣sive of any moral truth no more than the inventions of men But he that applies the VISIONS OF GOD in such a manner is guilty of an impropriety which I fear amounts to an impiety  If we look back from Spenser's age thro' the state of poesy in this kingdom we shall find that it prin∣cipally consisted in the allegoric species but that this species never received its absolute consummation till it appear'd with new lustre in the FAERIE QUEENE There are indeed the works of some English poets now remaining who wrote before Gower and Chau∣cer but these are chiefly chroniclers in rhyme and seem to have left us the last dregs of that kind of composition which was practic'd by the British bards as for instance the  That laborious Antiquary Thomas Hearne first printed this author at Oxford In his preface he tells us p how he was first tempted to publish this rare piece  "When I first saw a MS of this author which was even when I was a young un∣dergraduate in the Bodleian Library being one of the first MSS I had ever perused there I was WONDERFULLY DELIGHT∣ED with it"  He afterwards informs us with no small degree of triumph p  "As the Acts of the Apostles that I publish'd from Archbishop Laud's MSS is the first entire book that was ever printed in England in capital Letters so this Chronicle of Robert of Glocester is the first entire book that was ever printed in this kingdom it may be in the whole world in the manner I have done it that is in the black letter with a mixture of some Saxon characters"  In the next page he pro∣ceeds to enter into a warm defence of the old black letter  "As it is a reproach to us that the Saxon language should be so for∣got as to have but few comparatively speaking that are able to read it so 'tis a greater reproach that the black letter which was the character so much in use in our grandfather's days should be now as it were disus'd and rejected especially when we know the best editions of our English bibles and common prayer to say nothing of other books are printed in it"  I shall cite one more instance of our Antiquary's extreme thirst after anci∣ent things p  "But tho' I have taken so much pleasure in perusing the English bible of the year yet 'tis nothing e∣qual to that I should take in turning over that of the year "  chronicle of Robert of Glocester who wrote according to his own account about the year And hence we may observe  that Gower and Chaucer were reputed the first Eng∣lish poets because they first introduc'd INVENTION into our poetry they MORALIZED THEIR SONG and strove to render virtue more amiable by cloathing her in the veil of fiction Chaucer it must be ac∣knowledged deserves to be rank'd as one of the first English poets on another account his admirable ar∣tifice in painting the manners which none before him had ever attempted even in the most imperfect de∣gree and it should be remember'd to his honour that he was the first who gave the English nation in its own language an idea of HUMOUR With these flou∣rish'd the author of PIERCE PLOWMAN'S VISIONS of which I have given an occasional sketch above To these succeeded Lydgate who from his principal performances the FALL OF PRINCES and STORY of  Thebes might more properly be styled a legendary than allegorical poet although the first of these is in great measure a series of visions  The book on which it is founded viz Boccace de CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM is a plain historical narrative  and the latter contains a groupe of imaginary personages which his master Chaucer cannot surpass He is describing the company present at the marriage of Oedipus and Jocasta  But at this wedding plainly for to tell  Was CERBERUS chief

Innocent's cloister at Pa∣ris called the DANCE OF DEATH This piece was translated by Lydgate who tells us in the Prologue St  The which Daunce at St Innocent's  Portraied is  Stow mentions this DANCE OF DEATH in his Survey of London speaking of the cloisters which antiently belonged to St Paul's church  "About this cloister was artificially and richly painted the Dance of Machabray or DANCE of DEATH commonly called the Dance of Paul's the like whereof was painted about St Innocent's cloyster at Paris the metres or poesie of this Daunce were translated out of French into English by John Lidgate Monk of Bury and with the picture of Death leading all estates painted round the cloyster"  pag This picture is a wood∣cut and prefixed to the poem we are speaking of in Tottell's edi∣tion of Lydgate and is I suppose an exact representation of what was painted in St Paul's cloisters It was afterwards en∣graved by Hollar in Dugdale's Monast vol p In all probability this painting at St Paul's or that which was the same at St Innocent's gave Hans Holbein the hint for composing his famous piece call'd the DANCE OF DEATH now to be seen in the townhouse at Basil  It is commonly supposed that the woodcuts from whence Hol∣lar engraved his exquisite sett of prints entitled the DANCE OF DEATH were executed by Holbein but I am apt to think this a mistake which arose from confounding Holbein's picture above∣mentioned with these woodcuts For it will appear that Hol∣bein's manner of cutting in wood is entirely different from that in which these are finished by comparing them with Holbein's scrip∣tural woodcuts in one of which his name is engraved at full length inserted in archbishop Cranmer's catechism an In the cuts of this catechism there is a delicacy of handling by no means to be found in those of the DANCE OF DEATH which however have an inimitable expression and are most probably the work of Albert Durer I am not ignorant that Rubens who had copied this DANCE OF DEATH recommended them to Sandrart as the performance of Holbein of which Sandrart himself informs us  "  Sic memini  cI also well remember that in the year when Paul Rubens came to Utrecht to visit Handorst being escorted both coming from and returning to Amsterdam by several artists as we were in the boat the conversation fell upon Holbein's book of cuts representing the DANCE OF DEATH that Rubens gave them the highest encomiums ad∣vising me who was then a young man to set the highest value upon them informing me at the same time that he in his youth had copied them"  Joach Sandrart  Academ Pict part    lib    cap    p    But if Rubens stiled these prints Holbein's in familiar conversation it was but calling them by the name which the world had given them and which they generally went by In another place Sandrart evidently confounds these woodcuts with Holbein's picture at Basil  "  Sed in foro c  But in the fishmar∣ket there at Basil may be seen his Holbein's admirable DANCE OF PEASANTS where also in the same public manner is shewn his DANCE OF DEATH where by a variety of figures it is demonstrated that Death spares neither popes emperors princes c as may be seen in his most elegant woodencuts of the same work"  ibid  pag  Now the cuts of which at present I am treating are fiftythree in number every one of which has an unity and is entirely detach'd from the rest so that how could they be representations of one picture But if it be grant∣ed that they were engrav'd from this picture which moreover from their dissimilitude they could not be how does it follow they were done by Holbein  The book from which Hollar copied these cuts is printed at Ba∣sil and is thus entitled  "ICONES MORTIS  duodecim imagi∣nibus praeter priores totidemque inscriptionibus praeter epigrammata e gallicis a Georgio Aemylio in latinum versa cumulatae  "  The ear∣liest edition I could meet with is one in which the inscriptions c are in Italian printed at Lyons with this title  "  Simolachri Historie e Figure de la Morte  c"  In this there are not so many cuts by twelve as in the lastmention'd edition and in the preface of this it is said that this book had been before printed with French and Latin inscriptions c and from the French edition I suppose Aemylius spoken of before translated Spurious edi∣tions of these cuts soon afterwards appear'd particularly one at Cologn dated in which the forgery is pretty discernible It may not be improper to take leave of this subject by remarking that Spenser alludes to some of these representations which in his age were fashionable and familiar  All Musicke sleepes where DEATH DOTH LEAD THE DAUNCE  NOVEMBER  which are both pro∣fessedly written in the species of which I am at  present speaking Lidgate has received numberless encomiums from our old English poets to which  his language entitled him rather than his ima∣gination for though he is a very unaminated writer yet he made very considerable improvements in the original state of our English versification by writing in so polite a style and it ought not to be denied that Lydgate is the first English poet who can be red without hesitation and difficulty To Lydgate succeeded John Harding who wrote a Chro∣nicle in verse of all our English kings from Brutus to the reign of king Edward IV in which he liv'd This piece is often commended and quoted by some of our best antiquaries But his merit as an histo∣rian naturally excludes him from that which he should arrogate as a poet accuracy in collecting and fideli∣ty in relating events may be perhaps justly allow'd him but not the least effort of invention So that from the specimen produced by Harding at this time there was some reason to presage that poesy was re∣lapsing into its primaeval barbarism and that the rudeness of Robert of Gloucester would be reinstated  in the place of Chaucer's taste judgement and imagination  However in the reign of Henry VII ample amends were made for this interval of darkness by Stephen Hawes a name generally unknown and not menti∣oned by any English compiler of the lives of English poets but by the accurate Wood  Fast Oxon  This author I look upon to be the restorer of invention in our poetry whose streams had flow'd in a current still more polluted and sluggish ever since the time of Chaucer He not only reviv'd but highly improved the an∣tient allegoric vein which the rhyming chronicle of the last mentioned poet had as I before hinted now totally expelled Instead of that dryness and harsh∣ness of description which are so remarkably disgusting in his predecessors we are by this author often enter∣tained with the fullness and luxuriancy of SpenserHawes refin'd Lydgate's versification and gave it what it wanted sentiment and invention added new graces to the sevenlined stanza which Gower and Chaucer first introduced into our tongue from the Italian and to sum up all was the first of our poets who taught fertile fancy and highwrought fiction to wear the garb of perspicuous and harmonious numbers The title of his poem is almost as universally un∣known as his name and is as follows  "The history of GRAUNDE AMOURE and LA BEL PUCEL called the PASTIME OF PLEASURE contayning the know∣ledge of the seven sciences and the course of man's lyfe in this worlde Invented by Stephen Hawes  grome of Kyng Henry the seventh his chamber"  In a note after the contents it is said to be written in the twentyfirst year of Henry VII which is in the year  In the reign of king Henry VIII learning appear'd with new lustre in this island and this age is perhaps the first which England ever saw that may with pro∣priety be styled classical as it was dignify'd with the great names of Sir Thomas More Colet dean of St Paul's Cheke Ascham together with many more illustrious rivals in genius and erudition Nor is it the most inconsiderable honour of this age that Eras∣mus was now entertained and patronized in England and that the Greek language in which are reposited the treasures of true learning now began to be taught and admir'd In this age flourish'd John Skelton who notwithstanding the great and new lights with which he was surrounded contributed not the least share of improvement to what his ancestors had left him nor do I perceive that his versification is in any degree more polish'd than that of his immediate predecessor Hawes His best pieces are written in the allegorical manner and are his CROWNE of LAU∣RELL and BOWGE OF COURT But the genius of this author seems little better qualify'd for pic∣turesque than for satyrical poetry in the former he wants invention grace and dignity in the lat∣ter wit and good manners  I should be guilty of injustice to merit in particu∣lar and to a nation in general which amidst a variety  of disadvantages has kept a constant pace with Eng∣land in the progress of literature were I here to omit the mention of two Scottish poets who flourish'd a∣bout this time Sir David Lyndesay and William Dunbar the former of which in his DREAM and other pieces and the latter in his GOLDEN TERCE or SHIELD and in THE THISTLE AND ROSE has discover'd a genuine spirit of allegorising Soon af∣terwards appear'd a series of poems entitled the MIRROR OF MAGISTRATES form'd upon a  Every person is introduc'd speaking Richard II is thus in∣troduced  "Suppose you see the corpse of this Prince all to be mangled with blewe wounds lying pale and wan all naked upon the stones in St Paules Church the people standing round about him and making his complaynt in manner as follows c"  Lydgates's FALL of PRINCES gave rise to the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES In the year R Baldwin was requested to continue Lydgate's series of the great Unfortunate but he chose rather to confine himself entirely to our English story and began with Robert Tresilian and ended with Lord Hastings In this work he was assisted by others and particularly by John Sackville who wrote the life of the Duke of Buckingham toge∣ther with this INDUCTION intending at the same time to write all those remarkable lives which occurr'd from the Conquest to Tresi∣lian with whom Baldwin originally began and to have printed his additional part together with all that Baldwine and his friends had already done in one volume and to have prefix'd this INDUC∣TION as a general preface to the whole But this was never exe∣cuted Afterwards another collection was published under the same title by W Higgins  dra∣matic plan and capable of admitting some of the most affecting pathetical strokes but these however honour'd with the commendation of Sir Philip Syd∣ney are little better than a biographical detail There is one piece indeed among the rest which exhibits a train of imaginary personages so beautifully drawn  that in all probability they contributed to stimulate and awaken the imagination of Spenser in forming the like descriptions This however may be affirm'd from demonstration that SACKVILLE'S INDUCTION ap∣proaches nearer to the FAERIE QUEENE in allegoric representation than any previous or succeeding poem  After the FAERIE QUEENE allegory began to de∣cline and by degrees gave place to a  See Donne's works and Davies on the IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL Lord Brooke's TREATISE OF HUMAN LEARNING c c  species of com∣position in which the perplex'd subtilities of metaphy∣sical disquisition strongly

Allegory notwithstanding abruptly discover'd itself once more with somewhat of it native splendor in the  Printed in the year The principal fault of this poem is that the author has discover'd too much of the anatomist The  Purple Island  is the Isle of Man whose parts and construction the poet has describ'd in an allegori∣cal manner viz the bones are the foundation of it the veins it's brooks c Afterwards the intellectual faculties are represented as persons but he principally shines where he personifies the passions or evil concupiscencies of the heart who attack the good qualities of the heart alike personified which under the conduct of their leader INTELLECT rout the former In this poem there is too somewhat of a metaphysical turn As the whole is supposed to be sung by two shepherds the poet has found an opportunity of adorn∣ing the beginnings and endings of his cantos with some very plea∣sing pastoral touches  PURPLE ISLAND of Fletcher with whom it al∣most as soon disappear'd when a poetry succeeded in  which imagination gave way to correctness sublimity of description to delicacy of sentiment and striking imagery to conceit and epigram Poets began now to be more attentive to words than things and objects and a manner of expressing a thought prettily was more regarded than that of conceiving one nobly The Muses  This seems to have been the the case in France when Voltaire read his HENRIADE to M Malezieux that learned man assured him his work would not be tasted for says he  "  Les Francois n' ont pas la tete epique  "  That is in a more extensive interpretation the present age is too fond of MANNER'D poetry to relish FICTION and FABLE The satires of Boileau will be preferr'd to an epic poem May we not say the same of the taste of the present age and that it is too much the consequence of that which began to pre∣vail in the reign of Charles II That we now sacrifice to reason more frequently than to fancy On this occasion another question put by Brumoy might not improperly be ask'd  "SI LA RAISON A DEAUCOUP GAGNE NE PEUTON PAS DIRE QUE LE GOUT A UN PEU PERDU"  Tom  were debauch'd at court and life and man∣ners became their themes insomuch that the simpli∣city and true Sublime of the PARADISE LOST was by these triflers either totally disregarded or else mistaken for insipidity and bombast  Even Dryden blinded by the beauties of versification only seems not to have had a just idea of Milton's greatness It is odd that in praising Milton he should insist on these circumstances  "No man has so copiously translated Homer's Graecisms and the latin elegancies of Virgil"  By what follows it appears that he had no notion of Milton's simple dignity  "He runs into a FLAT THOUGHT sometimes for a hundred lines together but tis when he is got into a TRACK OF SCRIPTURE"  He afterwards strangely misrepresents Milton's reason for writing in blankverse  "Nei∣ther will I justifie Milton for his writing in blankverse for what∣ever causes he alledges for the abolishing of rhime which I have not now the leisure to examine his own particular reason is plainly this that RHIME WAS NOT HIS TALENT"  Whether or no rhime was Milton's talent or not I shall not determine but shall infer from this reason assigned by Dryden that had Dryden compos'd the PARADISE LOST he would have written it in rhyme and that consequently he judged the want of it an imperfection in Milton's Poem See dedication to Dryden's Juvenal    Without conducting the reader any farther thro' the succeeding stages and revolutions of the poetical re∣public in this kingdom I shall beg his pardon for having proceeded thus far in an enquiry that may seem a deviation from the subject of this section which I shall conclude with the sentiments of the Abbe Du Bos on allegorical action which tho' applied by him to dramatic poets are equally appli∣cable to the action of the FAERIE QUEENE  "It is impossible for a piece whose subject is an allegorical action to interest us very much Those which writers of approved wit and talents have hazarded in this kind have not succeeded so well as others where they have been dispos'd to be less ingenious and to treat historically their subjectOur heart requires truth even in fiction itself and when it is presented with an allegorical action it cannot deter∣mine itself if I may be allowed the expression to enter into the sentiments of those chimerical person∣ages It considers them as enigmas and symbols that envelop some precepts of morality or satyrical strokes which properly belong to the jurisdiction of the mind Now a theatrical piece were it to speak only to the mind would never be capable of engag∣ing  our attention thro' the whole performance We may therefore apply the words of Lactantius upon this occasion  Reflexions  Tom C  Poetic licence has its bounds be∣yond which you are not permitted to carry your fiction A poet's art consists in making a good re∣presentation of things that might have really hap∣pened and embellishing them with elegant images TOTUM AUTEM QUOD REFERAS FINGERE ID EST INEPTUM ESSE ET MENDACEM POTIUS QUAM POETAM"  SECT XI Containing Miscellaneous Remarks  IN reading the FAERIE QUEENE some observations necessarily occured which could not be conveniently referr'd to the general heads of the foregoing sections which in this are thrown together without connection as they occasionally and successively offered themselves  Bi Introduct Si  Fierce warres and faithfull loves shall MORALIZE my song  By the word  moralize  Spenser declares his design of writing an allegorical poem tho' my subject says he consists of fierce wars and faithfull loves yet under these shall be couch'd moral doctrine and the pre∣cepts of virtue Our author in another place styles his FAERIE QUEENE A MORALL LAY where the shepherd addresses Colin Clout who represents Spenser  Whether it were some Hymne or MORALL LAY  Or caroll made to please thy loved laste  And bishop Hall in his prologue to his satires where he alludes to this poem hints at the preceptive na∣ture of it in these words speaking of the swords of Elfish Knights  Or sheath them new  In misty MORAL types  And Drayton calls our author with reference to the morality contained in the FAERIE QUEENE  Grave MORALL Spenser  To my most dearely loved friend Henry Reinolds of poets and poesie    B i C i S

S xlv  Made a lady of that other spright  And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender parts  Thus a false Florimel is made of snow animated with a spright Mr Pope thinks that our author drew the idea of his false Florimel from that passage in Homer where Apollo raises a phantom in the shape of Aeneas B Iliad and from the fictitious Turnus of Virgil Aen But he probably borrow'd it more immediately from romance where magicians are often feigned to dress up some wicked spirit with a counterfeit likeness in order to carry on their pur∣poses of deception  B i C ii S xi  In mighty arms he was yclad anon  And silver shield upon his coward brest  A bloudie cross  Thus Archimago disguises himself in the accoutre∣ments of the RedCross Knight who as we were be∣fore told was  Yclad in mightie armes and

Came dauncing forth shaking his dewy hair  Spenser as Mr Jortin observes plainly alluded to this text in the Psalms  Psal  "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber and rejoyceth as a giant to run his course"  But our author has strangely inverted the circumstances The psalmist alludes to the Jewish custom of the bridegroom being conducted from his chamber at midnight with great pomp and preceded by a great number of torches This is the illustration of the admirable Dr Jackson and without it the comparison is of no force or pro∣priety The idea which our author would convey is that Phoebus came forth fresh and vigorous as a bridegroom when he goes to his bride The cir∣cumstance of Phoebus  "came dauncing forth"  seems to have been copied by Milton in his elegant song on May morning  Now the bright morningstar dayes harbinger  Comes dancing from the east  But probably Milton drew it from an old poem cal∣led the CUCKOW by R Niccols who speak∣ing of the east says  From whence the daies bright king came dancing out  especially as Milton has two thoughts in that song which are likewise in the CUCKOW Milton calls the morning star  Day's harbinger  Niccols calls the cock  Daies harbinger  Milton says of May  Who from her green lap throwes  The yellow cowslip c  Niccols of May  And from her fruitfull lap eche day she threw  The choicest flowres  Milton I suppose had been reading this poem of the CUCKOW just before he wrote his song and so im∣perceptibly adopted some of its thoughts and expres∣sions And here it may be observ'd that in critici∣sing upon Milton Johnson Spenser and some other of our elder poets not only a competent knowledge of all antient classical learning is requisite but also an acquaintance with those books which though now forgotten and lost were yet in repute about the time in which each author respectively wrote and which it is most likely he had red  B i C iii S v  A

with and often in∣dulg'd the pensive pleasure which the awful solemnity of a Gothic church conveys to the mind and which is here so feelingly describ'd while he was a school∣boy at St Paul's The church was then in its origi∣nal Gothic state and one of the noblest patterns of that kind of architecture  B i C x S lxiv  Sith to thee is unknowne the cradle of thy brood  Thus again  Even from the

our Liturgy  "Deliver me from BLOUDGUILTI∣NESSE O God"  Psal v  The same may be said of BLOUDTHIRSTIE  And high advancing his BLOUDTHIRSTIE BLADE  B i C viii S xvi  As doth a hidden moth  The inner

flat∣tering and deceitful Comus and the supposition that she was the goddess or genius of the wood resulting from the situation of the persons is new as well as pro∣per  There is another passage in Comus whose sub∣ject is not much unlike that of the verses just pro∣duc'd which probably Milton copied from Euripides  Their port was more than human as they stood  I took it for a faery vision  Of some gay creatures of the element  That in the colors of the rainbow live  And play i' th' plighted clouds I was awestrook  And as I past I worship'd  Comus thus describes to the Lady her brothers And

Gemini  I shall take this opportunity of pointing out one or two more of Milton's imitations by which it will farther appear how well he knew to make a bor∣row'd thought or description his own by the pro∣priety of the application Michael thus speaks of what would happen to Paradise in the universal De∣luge  then shall this mount  Of Paradise by might of waves be mov'd  Out of his place push'd by

describ'd by the antient poets I think the following in Apollonius has never been alledged Jason crushes the growing warriors with a vast stone        B  Arripit e campo magnum rotundum saxum  Mirum Martis Gradivi discum non ipsum viri  Juvenes quatuor ne paulum quidem terra elevassent  Id sumptum in manibus valde procul in medios abjecit  Insiliens    But Jason was assisted in this miraculous effort by the enchantments of Medea  B ii C xii S lx  And in the midst of all a fountaine stood  Hardly any thing is describ'd with greater pomp and magnificence than artificial fountains in Romance See a glorious one in Ariosto  B ii C xii S lxxxi  But one above the rest in speciall  That had an hog been late hight Grill by name  Repined greatly and did him miscall  That had from human shape him brought to naturall  Mr Jortin  Remarks pag  observes that this is taken from a Dia∣logue in Plutarch inscrib'd    where Gryllus one of the compa∣nions of Ulysses transform'd into a hog by Circe holds a discourse with Ulysses and refuses to be re∣stor'd to his human shape  Not many years before the FAERIE QUEENE was written viz Gelli published his Circe which is declar'd in the Preface to be founded upon the Dia∣logue of Plutarch mention'd by Mr Jortin Circe soon became a very popular book and was translated into English as likewise into other languages in the Year by one Henry Iden so that probably Spenser had red it and might be induc'd to consult that Dialogue from its mention in the preface  B iii C i S xiv  Save Beares Lyons and Buls which romed them around  This verse would be improv'd in its harmony by reading  Save Lyons Beares and Buls c  As would the following also  Yet was admired much of fooles  women  and boyes    If we were to read  Yet was admired much of  women  fooles and boyes  But these corrections are made by the critic upon a supposition that his author must infallibly have writ∣ten what was best It may be laid down as a general rule that an Alexandrine cannot be harmonious with∣out a full pause after the third foot Thus  That spear enchanted  was  which laid thee on the green  Consequently the sixth syllable must necessarily be a monosyllable or the last syllable of a word for we cannot make a full pause in the middle of a word upon which account such Alexandrines as these are necessarily inharmonious  So in his angry  courage  fairly pacify'd  That bore a Lyon  passant  in a golden field  But that he must do  battel  with the seanymph's son  And to her watry  chamber  swiftly carry him  And because a full pause must be made on the last syllable of the third foot the third foot should never consist of a Trochee for then we should be oblig'd to lay the greater stress upon the short syllable as if the third foot was to be Beāuty̆ Coūrăge grēedy̆ flōwry̆ or the like  And it may be further remark'd that an Iambus for the third foot will make the verse more musical as the pause will be more strong after a short syllable Thus  Fit to adorn  thĕ dēad  and deck the dreary tomb  That art thus  foully̆ flēd  from famous enemy  For the same reason an Iambic foot at the end of any English verse has a good effect  An Alexandrine entirely consisting of Iambic feet answers precisely to a pure Iambic verse of the antients Thus  Thĕ gēntlĕ Evē ăwākes rĕfrēshfŭll āirs ăroūnd  Equēs sŏnāntĕ vērbĕrābĭt ūngŭlā  In reading this kind of measure the antients did not probably huddle the syllables together as we do but it would be difficult to point out the places at which they made their pauses Why should the fol∣lowing pure Iambic of Sophocles  Elect v  Be red like mere prose without any certain pause or division and this verse of Anacreon  Od v  Be red with these rests  May we not suppose that the Iambic of Sophocles was red with some such divisions as these    Which are not very unlike those which we make use of in reading the above English Alexandrine or Iambic verse  The gentle Eveawakesrefreshfull airsaround  It may be observ'd that a Latin Hexameter is essen∣tially distinguish'd from a prose sentence only by being ended with a Dactyle preceding a Spondee upon which account our manner of reading the end∣ings of such Hexameters as these  procumbit Humi Bos Oceano Nox amica Luto Sus c  is probably wrong According to our present manner of reading them the whole verse doth not differ in sound from an  Ora∣tio prosaica  contrary therefore to our present prac∣tice we should take care to express the Dactyle and Spondee thus  Oceano Nox  and so of the rest And that this was the practice of the antients may be farther infer'd from these words of Quintilian on reading verses  "SIT LECTIO VIRILIS ET CUM SEVERITATE QUADAM GRAVIS ET NON QUIDEM PROSAE SIMILIS QUIA CARMEN EST"  Instit Orat l c  B iii C i S xvi  All as a blazing starre doth farre outcast  His hairie beames and flaming lockes disspred  Hairie  seems to be an odd epithet for  Beames  I once thought that Spenser might have wrote  airie beames  i e  beams streaming through the air  But  hairie  is undoubtedly the genuine reading as the ad∣jective and substantive  hairie  and  beames  are alternate∣ly inverted and oppos'd to  flaming  and  locks  B iii C i S lvi  And every knight and every gentle squire  Gan chuse his dame with  bascio mani  gay  With  bascio mani  Ital with kissing her hands a phrase perhaps common in our author's age

Lost  That is  "The milky way which every night ap∣pears to you like a circling zone  besprinkled  or  em∣broider'd  with stars"  To the majority of readers I dare say  powdred with stars  has ever appear'd a very mean or rather ridiculous metaphor It oc∣currs in Sackville's Induction to the MIRROR OF MAGISTRATES  Then looking upwards to the heaven's leames  With night's bright STARRES thick

the  holy  HERSAL which is us'd after∣wards  sad HERSAL of his heavy strife    So that  holy herse  is here the rehearsal of the prayers in the churchservice at which Britomart is now de∣scrib'd as present HERSE occurs in the Pastoral of November as the burden of Colin's song "O heavie HERSE" and "O happie HERSE" where E K interprets HERSE The solemne Obsequie in Funerals  B iii C iii S xxvi  But sooth he is the sonne of Gorlois  This is the Gorlois of whom Milton speaks  Epitaph Damonis  Tum gravidam Arturo fatali fraude Iogernen  Mendaces vultus assumptaque Gorlois arma  Merlini dolus  Geoffrey of Monmouth informs us that Uther Pendragon fell in love with Igerne or Iogerne the wife of Gorlois prince of Cornwall In the absence of Gorlois Merlin by his magic transform'd Uther into the likeness of Gorlois and one Ulfin into the likeness of Jordan a familiar friend of Gorlois him∣self assuming the figure of one Bricel by means of  which artifice Uther enjoy'd Iogerne and begot king Arthur  B c  Spenser in his Epistle to Sir W Raleigh calls Iogerne or Igerne the Lady IGRAYNE  B iii C iii S liii  Bardes tell of many women valorous  Which have full many feates adventurous  Perform'd in paragone of proudest men  The bold Bonduca whose victorious  Exploits made Rome to quake stout Guendolen  Renowned Martia and redoubted Emmelen  Glauce with the greatest propriety is here made to allude to the bards whose  Leland de Script Brit cap  business it was to sing to the harp the warlike atchievements of their countrymen and who flourished in high perfection at the time in which our author has suppos'd the events of the FAERIE QUEENE to have fallen out They are in∣troduc'd with no less consistency playing upon their harps in the hall of the House of PRIDE  Many bards that to the trembling chord  Can tune their timely voices cunningly    The bards were usually employ'd upon such public occasions  in bower or hall  as Milton terms it  B iii C v S xxxii  There whether it divine Tobacco were  Or Panacea or Polygony  Tobacco was at this time but newly discover'd to the English and not an ordinary herb as it is at pre∣sent Probably Tobacco is here mention'd with so much honour by way of paying a compliment to Sir Walter Raleigh our author's friend and patron who first introduc'd and us'd Tobacco in England  B iii C vii S vi  There in a gloomy hollowe glen she found  A little cottage built of stickes and reedes  In homely wise and wall'd with sods around  In which a witch did dwell in loathely weedes  And wilfull want all carelesse of her needes  Witches were thought really to exist in the age of Queen Elizabeth and our author had probably been struck with seeing such a cottage as this in which a witch was suppos'd to live Those who have perus'd Mr Blackwall's Enquiry into the life and writings of Homer will be best qualified to judge how much better enabled that poet is to describe who copies from living objects than he who describes in a later age from tradition  B iii C vii S ix  Wiping the tears from her SUFFUSED eyes  So Virgil  Tristior atque oculos lacrymis  SUFFUSA  nitentes  Aen v  B iii C vii S lii  Her well beseemes that

xxxix  Sometimes he boasted that a God he hight  But she a mortal creature loved best  Then he would make himself a mortal wight  But then she said she lov'd none but a Faerie knight  xl  Then like a Faerie knight himself he drest  The use which the poet here makes of Proteus's power of changing his shape is artful enough  B iii C x S viii  Ballads  As the name of G GASCOINE has been frequently mention'd in the course of this work it may not be perhaps improper to give the reader some further knowledge of him His works were print∣ed An with this title  "A hundreth sundrie flowres bounde up in one small poesie gather'd partly by translation in the fyne and outlandish gardens of Euripides Ovid Petrarke Ariosto and others and partely by invention out of our own fruitefull orchardes in Englande yielding sundrie sweet savours of tragi∣call comicall and morall discourses both pleasaunt and profita∣ble to the wellsmellyng noses of learned readers"  This was follow'd by another edition An This author was well esteem'd by his cotemporary writers as appears by their testimo∣nies of him and it must be confess'd that he has much exceeded all the poets of his age in smoothness and harmony of versification Would it not extend this note too far as a specimen of his talent for loveverses I would produce his Ode  "In praise of Lady Bridges now Ladie Sandes on a scar on her forehead"  in which the reader would be surpriz'd to discover a delicacy rarely if ever to be found in that early state of our poetry  But the reader will probably be still more entertain'd with some passages in JOCASTA a Tragedie before mention'd written ten years before the Poem just quoted and acted at Gray's Inn in which he will not only perceive the strength and harmony but likewise the poetical spirit of Spenser who did not publish any one of his pieces till fourteen years afterwards The story is taken and in some measure translated from the PHOENISSAE of Euripides it is written in blank verse with chorusses none of which are copied from those in the PHOENISSAE and before each Act according to the practice of that age the Dumb Shew is introduc'd In Act combat is likely to ensue between Eteocles and Polynices on which occasion the Chorus consisting of four Theban dames sing an Ode which thus begins  O fierce and furious God whose harmefull harte  Rejoyceth most to shed the giltlesse blood  Whose headie will doth all the world subvert  And doth envy the pleasaunt merry moode  Of our estate that erst in quiet stoode  Why dost thou thus our harmelesse towne annoy  Which mightie Bacchus governed in joye  Father of warre and death that dost remove  With wrathfull wrecke from wofull mothers breast  The trustie pledges of her tender love  So graunt the Gods that for our finall rest  Dame Venus' pleasaunt lookes may charm thee best  Whereby when thou shall all amazed stand  The sword may fall out of thy trembling hand  And thou maist prove some other way full well  The bloudie prowesse of thy mightie speare  Wherewith thou raisest from the depths of hell  The wrathfull sprites of all the furies there  Who when they wake doe wander everie where  And never rest to raunge about the coastes  T' enrich their pit with spoile of damned ghostes  And when thou hast our fields forsaken thus  Let cruell DISCORDE beare thee companie  Engirt with snakes and serpents venemous  Ev'n she that can with red vermilion dye  The gladsome greene that florish'd pleasantly  And make the greedie ground a drinking cup  To sup the bloud of murder'd bodies up  Yet thou return O joye c c  There are other passages equally striking which it would be no less tedious than impertinent to transcribe  VIRELAYES and verses vaine  Virelayes are often mention'd by Chaucer and our old poets G Gascoigne in his Defence of rhyme gives  this account of Virelayes  "There is an old kinde of rhyme called VERLAYES deriv'd as I have redde of the worde  verde  which betokeneth  greene  and  laye  which betokeneth a  song  as if you would say GREENE SONGES But I must tell you by the way that I never redde any verse which I saw by autho∣ritie called VERLAY but one and that was a long discourse in verses of tenne sillabeles whereof the four first did rhyme across and the fyfth did an∣swere to the fyrst and thyrde breaking off there and so going on to another termination Of this I could shew example of imitation in myne owne verses written to the right honourable the Lorde Grey of Wilton"  E G  A strange conceit a vaine of new delight  Twixt weale and woe 'twixt weale and bitter griefe  Hath pricked foorth my hastie pen to write  This worthlesse verse in hazard of reproofe  And to mine alderlievest Lord I must indice  B iii C x S xii  As Hellene when she sawe aloft

eversa ob Pergama Teucros  Et paenas Danaum deserti conjugis iras  Permetuens Trojae patriae communis erynnis  Abdiderat sese atque aris invisa sedebat  Aen  Spenser's lines put me in mind of a thought in one of Daniel's sonnets which seems to be copied by Waller  Who whilst I burne she sings at my soules wracke  Looking aloft from turret of her pride  There my soules tyrant joyes her in the sacke  Of her owne seat    Daniel here alludes to a circumstance related of Nero and Waller seems to have imitated Daniel's applica∣tion of it  Thus Nero with his harp in hand survey'd  His burning Rome and as it burnt he play'd  On my L Isabella playing on the lute  B iii C x S xxxv  For having filcht her bells her up he cast  To the wide world and let her fly alone  Here is a metaphor taken from hawking a diver∣sion highly fashionable in our author's age to which he frequently alludes and from whence he has drawn a very great number of comparisons The hawk's bells are mention'd afterwards  Like as an hawke that feeling herself freed  From bells and jesses which did let her flight    B iii C xii S xli  He bound that piteous lady prisoner now releast  Mr Jortin observes that Spenser to the best of his knowledge never uses verses of six feet except in the last line of the stanza and in this place But he had forgot these instances  But whilst his stony heart was toucht with tender truth    Again  Sad death revived with her sweet inspection    We meet with an Alexandrine in the Samson Ago∣nistes which I believe was not left so by the author  But I God's counsel have not

CONCENT  Probably in the Epithalamion where Spenser is speaking of many birds singing together  So goodly all agree with sweet  consent  Instead of  consent  we should read CONCENT Milton uses the

in his INDUCTION to THE MIRROR OF MA∣GISTRATES concerning the figure of OLD AGE  His witherd fist still knocking at death's dore  which perhaps is not more expressive than Chaucer's representation of ELDE or old age After telling us that Distress Sickness c always abide in her court and are her senators he adds  The day and night her to torment  With cruell death they her present  And tellen her

bridale day which is not long  i e  "Approaching near at hand"  B iv C viii S xxix  More hard for hungry steed t' abstaine from pleasant  lare  LARE is a Saxon word for bed It is us'd by Milton  Out

pit where she him heares complaine  An hundred times about the pitside fares  Right sorrowfully mourning her beareaved cares  This comparison has great propriety There is one not much unlike it in Lucretius  At mater virides saltus orbata peragrans  Linquit humi pedibus vestigia pressa bisulcis  Omnia convisens late loca si queat unquam  Conspicere amissum faetum completque querelis  Frondiferum nemus adsistens crebra revisit  Ad stabulum desiderio perfixa juvenci    The circumstance of the calf fallen into the pit from whence the mother can only hear him complain finely heightens this parental distress and that of her walking round the pit so often I think exceeds the  crebra revisit ad stabulum  and it may be observ'd upon the whole that the tenderness of Spenser's tem∣per remarkably betrays itself on this occasion  B v C i S ix  Chrysaor is the name of Sir Arthegall's sword Swords are often nam'd in Romance and in Arios∣to's Orlando Furioso as Orlando's Durindana

difficult cause was to be gotten ei∣ther by HOOKE or by CROOKE But here is a proof that this proverb is much older than that time  B v C iii S xxiv xxv  When the false Florimel is plac'd by the side of the true Florimel the former vanishes into nothing and as suddenly says the poet as all the glorious colours of the rainbow fade and perish With regard to the circumstance of the sudden evanescence

only which the poet insists upon so that a partial correspondence only is expected  B v C iii S xxxiv  Of Brigadore  And louted low on knee  This is related of Alexander's horse Bucephalus  B v C iv S

qualified for  A semely man our hoste was withal  To ben a MARSHALL IN A LORDIS HALL  Prol  As the guests at these pompous and public festivals were very numerous and of various conditions I suppose the business of this office was to place every one according to his rank and to keep peace and order  B v C ix S xxix  Whilst KINGS and KESARS at her feet did them prostrate  Spenser frequently uses the expression  Kings and Kesars  The captive hearts  Of KINGS and KESARS    This is the state of KESARS and of KINGS    Mighty KINGS and KESARS into thraldom brought    Ne KESAR spared he awhit nor KINGS    It is a very antient form of speaking and is found in the Visions of Pierce Plowman  Death came driving after and all to dust pashed  KYNGES and KAYSERS knights and popes  Passus  It was not

knowledge and apprehension Thus a cave is said to be  A dreadfull depth how deepe no man can tell    If the poet had limited the depth of this cave to a very great but to a certain number of fathom the imagi∣nation  could still have suppos'd and added more but now as no determinate measure of its depth is assign'd our imagination is left at liberty to exert its utmost arbitrary stretch to add fathom to fathom and depth to depth till it is lost in it's own attempt to grasp the idea of that which is unbounded or infinite  B v C x S xxxiii  His corse  Which tumbling downe upon the SENSELESSE

bowres adorne with painted imagery  In the age of the poet tapestry was the most fashionable furniture of halls and staterooms as it was when Milton wrote his Comus who mentions tapestry as a circumstance of grandeur  Courtesie  Which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds  With smoaky rafters than in TAP'STRY HALLS  And courts of princes  As the general fashion of furnishing halls c is at present entirely different from this the reader passes over the expression TAPESTRYHALLS without feel∣ing any idea convey'd to him by it because the ob∣ject from whence it is drawn does not at present exist and we may observe from this passage how much of their force and propriety both expressions and descriptions must necessarily lose when the ob∣jects or customs or manners to which they allude are out of use and forgotten There is another re∣ference to tapestry in Milton which is equally un∣meaning to a modern reader  Auditurque chelys  SUSPENSA TAPETIA  circum  Virgineos tremulâ quae regat

age of Queen Elizabeth and indeed our au∣thor from his profession had some reason to declare himself their enemy as poetry was what they parti∣cularly stigmatiz'd and bitterly inveigh'd against In the year one Stephen Gosson wrote a pamphlet with this title  "The Schoole of Abuse containing a pleasaunt invective against poets pipers plaiers jesters and suchlike caterpillers of a common∣wealth"  This was soon follow'd by many others of the same kind  But the most ridiculous treatise of this sort was that written many years afterwards by W Prynne as a specimen of which I shall beg leave to entertain the reader with its titlepage  "HISTRIOMASTIX the Players Scourge or Actors Tragedie divided into two parts wherein it is largely evidenced by divers arguments by the concurring authorities

other particulars concerning dancing dicing healthdrinking c London  This extravagant and absurd spirit of puritanical enthusiasm proved at last in its effects as perni∣cious to polite learning and the fine arts as to the liberties and constitution of our country while every species of elegance was represented by these austere and melancholy zealots as damnable luxury and every degree of decent adoration as popish idolatry In short it is not sufficiently consider'd what a rapid and national progress we were at that time making in knowledge and how sudden a stop was put to it by the inundation of presbyterianism and ignorance which circumstance alone exclusive of its other at∣tendant  evils gives us ample cause to detest the pro∣moters of that malignant I wish I could add un∣provok'd rebellion which no good man can remem∣ber without horror  It may not perhaps be impertinent to remark here that Milton who was inclin'd to puritanism had good reason to think that the publication of his Samson Agonistes would be very offensive to his brethren who held poetry and particularly that of the dramatic kind in such abhorrence And upon this account it is probable that in order to excuse him∣self for having engag'd in this proscrib'd and forbid∣den species of writing he thought it expedient to pre∣fix to his play a formal DEFENCE OF TRAGEDY in which he endeavours to prove that some of the gravest writers did not scruple to illustrate their dis∣courses from the works of tragic poets and that many of the wisest philosophers and of the primitive fathers were not asham'd to write Tragedies  The subsequent remarks are thrown together with∣out order which the reader is desir'd to look upon as a SUPPLEMENT to this concluding SECTION  B i C vi S xvi  Farre off he

the passage is this  "He wonders what makes them so glad he  doubts with himself whether or no their mirth was not occasion'd by wine which they had disco∣ver'd or whether or no they might not be

that on the top of the moun∣tain Kindaberg near the castle of the same name there was a beautiful garden the most delicious spot of ground in all the Northern climate Into this gar∣den none but old men were permitted to enter The admission of young men to a survey of so delightfull a scene it was fear'd might prove too great a relaxa∣tion from their unintermitted daily discipline and make such impressions on their susceptible disposi∣tions as might be the beginnings of an effeminate and luxurious life  B vi C vi S xx  To whom the prince HIM faining to embase  HIM for HIMSELF is the language of poetry at pre∣sent The elder poets took greater liberties in this point so that sometimes it is difficult to determine whether HIM is us'd for  se  or  illum  Of this the verse before us is an instance  Thus again  Scudamore coming to CARE's house  Doth sleep from HIM expell  Arg  That is  "expells sleep from HIMSELF"  Thus in Sydney's VISION upon the conceit of the FAERIE QUEENE the most elegant of his works  At whose approache the soule of Petrarcke wept  And from thenceforth those graces were not seen  For they this queene attended in whose stead  OBLIVION laid HIM down on Lauras' herse  We are apt at first to refer HIM  down  c to Petarcke  "OBLIVION  laid  PETRARKE  down  "  While the meaning is  "OBLIVION LAID HIMSELF DOWNE c"  The initial line of this sonnet seems to have

beasts do rest  And every river eke his course forbeares  Then doth this wicked evill thee infest  These verses which at first sight seem to be drawn rom Dido's  I cannot forbear taking this opportunity of checking the petu∣lance and confuting the weakness of the redoubted Mr Rymer's criticism on the NIGHT of MEDEA in Apollonius      B V  "Night drew her shade over the earth The mariners contem∣plated from their ships Helice and Orion the traveller and door∣keeper were drowsy the sleeping mother forgott her dead chil∣dren there was no barking of dogs heard through the city nor any loud sound and silence attended upon the black darknessBut sweet sleep did not seize Medea"  Upon the propriety of these images Mr Rymer thus expatiates  "He would say that all the world is fast asleep but only Medea and then his mariners who are gazing from their ships on Helice and Orion can serve but little for his purpose unless they may be supposed to sleep with their eyes open Neither dares he say that the porter and traveller are yet taking a nap but only that they have a good mind to't And after all we find none but the good woman who had lost her child and she indeed is fast asleep unless the dogs may likewise be supposed so because they had left off barking And these methinks were scarce worthy to be taken notice of in an heroic poem except we may believe that in the old time or that in Greek they bark heroically"  Our critic here unfortunately sets on upon a sup∣position absolutely false viz that  "the poet is representing all the world as fast asleep"  so that every argument which he draws from this supposition must necessarily fall to the ground Apol∣lonius ushers in his nightpiece by telling us  "night cover'd the earth with her shade"  and afterwards selects such objects and circumstances the repose and tranquillity of which produce the most striking contrast to and consequently most strongly exaggerate the distraction and inquietude of Medea Hence he tells us that the mariner was contemplating with calm attention the constellations of Helice and Orion or that now it was the time according to Virgil's translation  cum medio volvuntur sydera lapsu  or that it was a still and consequently a silent night that even the traveller and doorkeeper whom he singles out as their employment implies watching and wakefullness were now about to fall asleep that even the mother whom we might expect to find awake had now forgot her dead babes in slumber that the dogs had ceased barking thro' the city a circumstance highly natural and picturesque of a still night that every sound c but that amidst this situation of things Medea could not sleep But what can we expect from a critic who confesses himself to be struck with this choice represen∣tation of the night in Dryden's conquest of Mexico  All things are husht as Nature's self lay dead  The mountains seem to nod their drowsy head  The little birds in dreams their songs repeat  And sleeping flowers beneath the nightdew sweat  Ev'n Lust and Envy sleep  These lines are no bad burlesque but it is their misfortune that they are written without the least intention of producing a smile Nor are Mr Rymer's sentiments upon them a worse specimen of burlesque criticism which however are dictated with the most serious and unaffected gravity  In this description four lines yield greater variety of matter and more choice thoughts than twice the number of any other language Here is something more fortunate than the boldest fancy has yet reached and something more just than the severest reason has ob∣served Here are the flights of Statius and Marino temper'd with a more discerning judgment and the judgment of Virgil and Tasso animated with a more sprightly wit Nothing has been said so ex∣pressive and so home in any other language as the first verse in this description The second is Statius improv'd  Et simulant fessos curvata cacumina somnos  Saith Statius where  simulant  is a bold word in comparison of our English word  seem  being of an active signification and  ca∣cumina  may as well be taken for the tops of Trees as the tops of Mountains which doubtful meaning does not so well content the reader as the certainty  In the third verse 'tis not said that the birds sleep but what is more new and more poetical their sleep is imply'd by their dreams Somewhat like to the fourth we have in Marino    E languidetti i fiori  Giaceano a l'herba genitrice in seno  Adonis Cant  Which is a pretty image but has not so near a resemblance with truth nor can so generally be apply'd to all flowers Our author here dares not say directly that the flowers sleep which might sound a little harsh but slurs it over in the  participle  as taken for granted and affirms only that they sweat which the nightdew makes very easie  In the last halfverse we may see how far our author has out∣done Apollonius 'Twas no such strange thing in the sorrowful woman when she had spent her tears for sleep to close her eyes but here we have the most raging and watchful passions lust and envy And these too instead of the lustful and the envious for the greater force and emphasis in the abstract  Some may object That the third verse does contradict the first How can all things be hush'd if birds in dreams repeat their songs Is not this like the indiscretion of Marino who says That the winds and all things are husht and the seas so fast asleep that they snore Cant  It may be answer'd That in this place 'tis not the poet that speaks but another person and that the poet here truly represents the nature of man whose first thoughts break out in bold and more general terms which by the second thoughts are more correct and limited As if one should say all things are silent or asleep how∣ever if there is any noise 'tis still but the effect of sleep as the dreams of birds c This comparison might be much further im∣prov'd to our advantage and more observations made which are left to the readers ingenuity  Pref to Aristot POET  night in the fourth Aeneid are translated from the Ceiris attributed to Virgil as it has been be∣fore in general hinted Sect  Tempore quo fessas

 That is  "in  strange  disguise"  In this sense the word QUEINT is us'd in COMUS  Lest the place  And this QUEINT habit breed astonishment  Somewhat in this signification it is likewise applied by the shepherd Cuddy in our author's OCTOBER  With QUEINT Bellona  Where E K in explaining it has discover'd more learning than penetration Skinner seems to have wrongly interpreted QUAINT  elegans  If it ever signifies  elegant  or  beautifull  it implies a fantastic kind of beauty arising from an odd variety Thus Milton in LYCIDAS of flowers  Throw hither all your QUEINT enamel'd eyes  And in ARCADES where it expresses an elegance re∣sulting from affectation rather than nature  And CURL the grove  In ringlets QUAINT  Where Milton copies Johnson in a MASKE at Wel∣beck  When was old Sherwoods head more QUEINTLY CURLD  The same poet has likewise drawn one or two more strokes in the ARCADES from a mask of Johnson In song he thus breaks forth  This this is she  To whom our vows and wishes c  So Johnson in an Entertainment at Althrope  This is shee  This is shee  Milton in Song pays this compliment to the countess of Derby  Tho' Syrinx your Pan's mistress were  Yet Syrinx well might wait on her  Thus Johnson in the same Entertainment  And the dame has Syrinx' grace  These little traits of likeness just lead us to con∣clude that Milton before he sate down to write his ARCADES had recourse to Johnson who was the most eminent masquewriter then extant for the form and manner proper to this species of composition and that in the course of writing it he naturally fell upon some of Johnson's expressions  B vi C ix S xxix  In vaine said then old Melibee doe men  The heavens of their fortunes fault accuse  Sith they know best what is the best for them  For they to

iii C i S xxxv  To crowne his golden locks with honor dew  Honor dew  frequently occurs in Spenser from whom Milton perhaps adopted it in L'Allegro  If I give thee HONOUR DUE  It has been conjectur'd that Milton took the hint in some measure for writing on MIRTH and ME∣LANCHOLY from the Ode prefix'd to Burton's ME∣LANCHOLY In support of this supposition I shall add that Milton had certainly been consulting that treatise before he wrote his two poems as this line in L'Allegro  Nods and becks and wreathed smiles  occurs almost literally in Burton  Not in the poem prefix'd but in the Book itself pag edit  With becks and nods and smiles again  Before I close this series of Observations I will hope for the reader's pardon once more while I lengthen out this digression in order to illustrate another passage in Milton  Leviathan  * * * *  Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam  The pilot of some small nightfounder'd skiff  Deeming some iland oft as seamen tell  With fixed anchor in his scaly rind  Moors in his side under the lee c  Par Lost  On the words  as Seamen tell  says Hume  "Words well added to obviate the incredibility of casting anchor in this manner"  It is likely that Milton never heard this improba∣ble circumstance of mistaking the Whale for an Iland from the seamen but that he drew it from that pas∣sage in his favorite Ariosto where Astolpho Dudon and Renaldo are said to have seen so large a Whale in the sea near Aclyna's castle that they took it for an island  Veggiamo una Balena la maggiore  Che mai per tutto il mar veduta fosse  Undeci passi e piu dimostra

The description in this simile was probably suggested to our author's imagination by this remarkable accident  POSTSCRIPT  IN the close of this work it may not be perhaps im∣proper to subjoin an apology for the manner in which I have conducted it  And first it may be objected in general that these observations would have been rendered more useful and  convenient had they been printed together with Spenser's text arrang'd in their respective places at least it may be urged that such a plan would have prevented much unnecessary transcription But I was dissuaded from such a procedure by two reasons the first is The observations the last section excepted as they now stand reduced to general heads appear to be so many distinct essays on Spenser and thus methodized are intended to form a kind of systematical critcism on the FAERIE QUEENE The second is that a formal edition of this poem with notes would have been impertinent as such a work is at present expected from the hands of two learned and ingenious critics  As to particular ejections too many I am sensi∣ble must occur one of which will probably be that I have been more diligent in pointing out the faults than the beauties of this author That I have been deficient in encomiums on particular passages did not proceed from a want of perceiving or acknowledging beauties but from a persuasion that nothing is more absurd or useless than the panegyrical comments of those who criticise from the imagination rather than from the judgement who exert their admiration instead of their reason and discover more of enthusiasm than discernment And this must necessarily it will however most commonly be the case of those who undertake to point out beauties which as they will naturally approve themselves to the reader by their own force so no reason can often be given why they please The same cannot always be said of faults which I have  frequently displayed without palliation  See more particularly Sect  it being my chief aim together with that of particular illustration to give an impartial estimate of the merit of this origi∣nal genius  I cannot take my final leave of the reader without acknowledging that this task has been peculiarly de∣lightful to me tho' the business of criticism is gene∣rally laborious and dry yet it has here more frequently amused than fatigu'd my attention in it's exercises upon an author who makes such perpetual and power∣ful appeals to the fancy The pleasure which Spenser received in composing the FAERIE QUEENE must necessarily be shared by it's commentator and the critic on this occasion may venture to exclaim with the poet  The waies thro' which my weary steppes I guide  In this DELIGHTFULL LAND OF FAERY  Are so exceeding spacious and wide  And sprinkled with such sweet
