 SPANISH MEMOIRS IN A SERIES OF ORIGINAL LETTERS VOL I  SPANISH MEMOIRS IN A SERIES OF ORIGINAL LETTERS CONTAINING THE HISTORY OF DONNA ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA NIECE TO DON JOHN TWENTIETH AND LAST DUKE OF ARANDINA  Published by the  AUTHOR  of  MARIA OR THE GENEROUS RUSTIC IN TWO VOLUMES VOL I  Sad mournful presage of her future years  The child of misery baptiz'd in tears  LANGHORNE  LONDON Printed for C ELLIOT T KAY and Co No opposite SomersetHouse Strand London And C ELLIOT Edinburgh M DCC LXXXVII  TO THE LADY L***M OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND ARE THESE MEMOIRS INSCRIBED BY HER LADYSHIP'S VERY FAITHFUL AND OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT THE EDITOR  ADVERTISEMENT  DURING my residence on the Continent I was so fortunate as to contract an acquaintance with the present  Bishop of Mo who was for many years superior of the Scots College at Seville To that amiable man I am indebted for the following letters which were discovered by him during his residence in Seville at the bottom of an old chest which stood in a deserted and traditionally haunted room in the attic story of the College  THE letters were transcribed into a book that was bound in vellum and in good condition  From the date of the Preface which is prefixed to them they appear to have been  collected  at the close of the last century At what time they were  written  it is impos sible now to determine though probably about the year as about that time the dukedom of Arandina became extinct by the death of Don John twentieth and last Duke  THE author of the Preface which is prefixed to these letters seems to have been well  acquainted with the history of the house of Arandina and it is by no means improbable that Father Alberto who makes so important a figure through the whole of the history was the person who thus preserved it  HAD these pages been the production of a later period I should have been led to suppose that the character of Alberto had been copied from that of the Bishop of M whose many amiable qualities  and distinguished talents have insured to him the respect and esteem of all who are so fortunate as to rank in the number of his acquaintance Nor can I lay down my pen without expressing the satisfaction with which I embrace this opportunity of testifying my respect for that truly amiable man whose virtues would reflect honour on the highest station and whose piety would adorn any communion  How far the Editor has acted with propriety in availing himself of the permission to print these letters will be determined by the public to whose inspection they are now respectfully submitted  MEMOIRS PREFIXED TO THE LETTERS BY THE PERSON WHO COLLECTED THEM  DONNA Isabella della Villarea was the only fruit of an unfortunate marriage Her father was the younger brother of Don John twentieth and last Duke of Arandina and grandee of the first order Don Frederick the father of Isabella at  an early period of his life became strongly attached to Donna Eliza daughter of Don Carlos de Ulloa a grandee of the second class  THE narrowness of Don Frederick's fortune retarded for a long time his union with Donna Eliza At length wearied with the frequent disappointments he experienced and not seeing any appearances in his favour he determined no longer to defer the completion of his happiness He had indeed repeatedly applied to his brother for assistance but the only answer which he obtained from the Duke was that younger brothers had better not marry Don Frederick now stated his case to Donna  Eliza who heroically preferred a  cottage  with Don Frederick to a palace with the Duke of Castillo Neuovo who at that time paid his addresses to her  DON FREDERICK was soon blessed with the hand of Donna Eliza whilst the family of Ulloa incensed to the last degree at the step she had taken determined never more to see her  MEANTIME Frederick and Eliza retired to a small farm he had purchased in the province of Andalusia where for some months they experienced a state of uninterrupted felicity to which however a period  was at length put by the villany of the Duke of Castillo Neuovo for one night as Don Frederick was returning home totally unattended the Duke aided by a party of  bravos  attacked him Don Frederick defended himself with the utmost valour and after dispatching the Duke and two of the villains sunk covered with wounds and expired The remainder of the party instantly retired with the body of the Duke whilst that of Don Frederick was soon after found by some peasants and carried home The first person who encountered the mournful procession was Donna Eliza The scene that ensued is too horrible for description Suffice it to say  that in a few hours Isabella was born and her mother recovered by slow degrees from that phrensy into which the death of Don Frederick had driven her Donna Eliza continued in her retirement in Andalusia where she indulged her melancholy by spending great part of each day at the monument which she had reared over the dust of her beloved Lord In this manner had five years elapsed when Donna Eliza found herself seized with a fever which she was assured would prove mortal No sooner did she receive the awful intelligence than she addressed the following letter to the Duke of Arandina to be  delivered by Isabella after her death  DON JOHN  IT is in acts of mercy only that man can resemble Heaven Remember  that  whilst you read this letter which will not be delivered to you till the trembling hand that writes and the bleeding heart that dictates are no more  I ACKNOWLEDGE that by marrying your tooamiable brother I injured him irreparably I reduced him to unmerited poverty I deprived him of your friendship and your protection and yet could only recompence all these losses by bestowing  on him my unworthy self A reward highly inadequate to his deserts but the unfortunate Eliza had no other to conser and the toogenerous Don Frederick was satisfied  GREAT as is the pleasure with which I behold my approaching dissolution when I consider that a few hours will certainly reunite me to my muchbeloved Frederick yet my pleasure is far from unalloyed when I reflect that the only fruit of our fatal shortlived union the hapless Isabella whose misfortunes were coeval with her birth will if you withhold your protection be exposed to innumerable dangers  Have pity then on the helpless orphan who will deliver this to your hands and who if you desert her will be left to the wide world without one friendly hand to guide her infant steps Reflect Don John on the ills to which the continuation of your resentment must expose her Do not punish Isabella for the errors of her unhappy parents They have drunk deep of the bitter cup of afflicttion do not oblige her to swallow the dregs By kindness to my Isabella you will atone for all the sufferings you have caused me I with my dying breath forgive you and righteous Heaven will also pardon you if you are a protector to my dear insant A tremor that now  pervades my whole frame obliges me to conclude with once more assuring you of the pardon nay of the esteem of  The unfortunate ELIZA  SCARCELY had Eliza finished this letter when clasping Isabella in her arms she ceased to sigh and sought her Frederick in the realms of bliss No sooner was Eliza entombed with her Frederick than Isabella was sent to the Castle of Villarea where Don John then resided On her arrival she delivered to him her mother's letter which he read with considerable attention and after pausing upon it for some time he ordered his  niece to be placed in the convent of Ventina where she remained till the age of sixteen The Duke then determined to place her in his own Castle a determination with which she was by no means pleased as from the specimens which she had seen of her uncle's behaviour during two or three short visits at the convent she had no great prospect of happiness under his roof or in his society Added to this she could not bid an eternal adieu to those walls where she had passed so many happy hours without feeling some pangs especially as she was then to be for ever separated from the friends of her youth of whom the most distinguished was Donna Laura de  Cassildina The parting of these ladies was highly affecting to  both  but especially to Donna Isabella who looked with horror on a world which she had been ever taught to consider as worse than it really is  OF her reception at Villarea a full account is to be seen in her first letter to Donna Laura with whom she constantly corresponded and to whom she communicated every event that befel her during their separation  THUS then I have collected all the facts relating to the life of Donna Isabella della Villarea a woman distinguished by every amiable quality  in whom even the prying eye of envy could not discover a flaw whilst malice Itself paid her virtue the tribute of silence  SPANISH MEMOIRS IN A SERIES OF ORIGINAL LETTERS  LETTER I  DONNA ISABELLA VILLAREA to DONNA LAURA DE CASSILDINA  From the Castle of Villarea  IN obedience to the sacred injunctions of my Laura I shall not fail to inform her of every event however trivial that may occur in this  dreary solitude A solitude which alone can be banished by the presence of her to whom I now write For her presence however I have no reason to hope I am almost tempted to say I do not entertain a wish My uncle's behaviour could not fail to render this place truly disagreeable to my dearest friend and great as the happiness of her society must always be to the wretched Isabella it would suffer an alloy which in the end would prove its destruction when I reflected that I was a source of pain to her who has been the friend of my youth who so kindly soothed my woes and to whom I am indebted for the small portion of selicity which I once enjoyedbut  of which I am now for ever deprived  MY Laura will not be a little anxious to hear what was the reception I met with from the Duke on my arrival He received me at the gate surrounded by a numerous train of domestics in rich dresses who appeared to me the finest people I had ever seen and though I have been here some days I cannot yet reconcile myself to giving them my orders  MY uncle's reception of me was formal and polite He told the servants that they must henceforth consider me as their mistress and must  pay an implicit obedience to my commands He then introduced me to his fatherconfessor who resides in the house with him and who appears to be about fifty has a pleasing countenance an air strongly tinctured with melancholy and manners highly polished From what I have seen of him I have reason to hope he will prove an agreeable companion A summons to attend the Duke leaves me only time to subscribe myself  The unalterably Affectionate friend of my Laura  LETTER II  From the same to the same  TEN thousand thanks for my Laura's letter it has scarce ever been out of my hands since its arrival The affectionate regard which you so kindly express for me serves only to increase my reget when I reflect that I am for  ever banished from so amiable a friend But as you have often observed it is our duty to submit without repining to the dispensations of Providence whose conduct to shortsighted mortals seems sometimes severe when it is directed to their good and when a different conduct would involve them in misery But my business at present is not to moralize but to describe the Castle and its environs The house is ancient and the building has an air of melancholy grandeur well suited to my disposition The orange groves that surround it and which are now in full blossom add greatly to the beauty of the place and would Heaven grant me the presence of my Laura  I should esteem it a perfect paradise A poor compliment this to Villarea as earth contains not the spot however barren or however horrid that would not appear to me a paradise if that spot contained my Laura  THE peasantry are poor and lazy but as my uncle's allowance to me is liberal I can remedy the former though not the latter evil Indeed I greatly fear all attempts on that head will prove ineffectual as every writer who has mentioned the peasantry of Spain speaks of them as indolent in the extreme The most industrious peasantry of whom I have ever read any account are those of England though having only seen  them represented by writers of their own country I know not what credit is to be given to the representations  IN your letter you express a wish to become more acquainted with my uncle Of him however I know nothing more than at my first arrival as he lives chiesty alone and wherever he appears preserves so much state as renders unsuccessful all attempts to become acquainted with him  FATHER ALBERTO is a widely different character His pleasing manners and melancholy air deeply interest you in every thing that concerns  him He is so good as to join me in my walks and exerts himself on all occasions to render my residence here pleasant You would like him much If all men resembled him what a world would this be My Laura perhaps would then quit the peaceful cloister and adorn some high station in active life But I must bid you adieu as the letters are called for and my paper is nearly exhausted I will however always leave room enough to admit of my subscribbing myself  Yours unalterably And ever affectionately ISABELLA  LETTER III  From the same to the same  MY Laura is too grateful for my letters as were I debarred the privilege of addressing her I should not know how to employ those hours of my life which I do not consecrate to heaven But so great is the pleasure of writing to my  friend that whilst I have my pen in my hand I almost forget that I am unfortunate The Duke is going to Madrid on business How happy is it for me that his excessive  hauteur  induces him to live entirely in the country instead of spending his whole life in Madrid as do all men of his rank But at Court he finds what he will never brook  superior  He leaves me here to guard the Castle in his absence I am rejoiced that I am not of the party as then I should have scarcely found time to tell my Laura how I love her But as I remain at Villarea I shall have little else to do except to offer up prayers for her happiness an employment highly grateful and of which I shall  never be weary No Laura never will I cease entreating Heaven to shower down its choicest blessings on your head May your days flow gently on may tranquil pleasure gild your future years and never may the misfortunes of Isabella extend their baneful influence over the fate of her friendThe Duke is just about to depart and has ordered me to his apartment to receive his commands The Duke is gone attended by a numerous train The Castle really seems like a desert Were you to see it you would suppose some fatal catastrophe had happened in the family so great an effect can the absence even of the most insignificant people produce  FATHER ALBERTO has just been here He advises me to fly to you for a few days How good how amiable he is He undertakes to settle it with the Duke and I shall be with you almost as soon as this letter O with what ecstacy do I look forward to our meeting When I shall embrace you and assure you in person how sincerely I am  Your unalterably affectionate ISABELLA  LETTER IV  From the same to the same  HERE I am at length returned to Villarea and to misery O Laura what did I not feel when forced to tear myself from your armsto leave those muchloved walls within which we have spent  so many happy hours when free from care and free from danger our time was devoted to Heaven and to our own improvement On those hours and on that employment I reflect with pleasure mingled with regret for though they still are yours to me they never will return How painful is that thoughtAnd shall we never meet again I trust we shall and be assured that no event however gloomy its appearance will by me be deemed unfortunate which restores Isabella to Ventina and to you  THE Duke is just returned and approves of my having visited you  Father Alberto has invited me to walk I shall therefore defer the conclusion of my letter till my return from my ramble which will not fail to be pleasant as he is of the party So adieu for the present On my return I shall resume my pen  AFTER a long walk I am returned home and with pleasure sit down to address my Laura My pleasure indeed is the greater as my amiable friend Alberto has begun the relation of his own memoirs so that now I shall be at no loss for materials of which to compose my letters I shall however defer entering on his story  till my next and I shall conclude with assuring my Laura that I am  Hers unalterably ISABELLA  LETTER V  From the same to the same  YOU are no doubt my dear Laura anxious to become acquainted with the memoirs of Alberto I shall therefore proceed to relate them in his own words as nearly as I can  Your goodness said he having often led you to express  a wish that you were acquainted with my history I will without reserve communicate to you all the particulars of it with which I myself am acquainted  FORTY years ago the master of a Spanish merchantman being on a voyage to England whither he was bound to dispose of his cargo it happened that one night there arose a violent storm Just as it began he descried an English ship making signals of distress but the violence of the hurricane prevented him from rendering her any assistance and she perished in the storm The next morning the winds being now calmed he discovered me then not apparently  above a year old floating on a piece of the wreck He instantly took me on board and some signs of life appearing all attempts were made for my recovery and these at last proving successful my preserver when all inquiries after my original proved ineffectual adopted me as his son No fewer than three English ships had perished in that storm nor could he find any one who knew that any of them had a child on board Thus was I precluded for ever from discovering to whom I owed my birthand whether or not both my parents perished in that fatal nightfatal to  me  because it deprived me of my natural protectors and yet did not rob  me of a life that has been perpetually overcast with the gloomy clouds of misfortune But the ways of Providence are unsearchable and it is our duty to submit to its will without repining Nor have I any doubt but that for wise and good reasons my life was preserved from the merciless waves Under the roof of my second father whose name I bear the first sixteen years of my life were passed in ease and tranquillity when the good man proposed that I should accompany him on a voyage to Italy As was natural at my age I embraced with pleasure an offer of seeing foreign countries and a few days brought us in sight of the Italian coast On our arrival at port I hastened  on shore that I might gratify my curiosity and make observations on the inhabitants of a country which had so often given lords to the world It happened that one night as I was walking alone on a retired part of the beach I heard the shrieks of some person in distress and they appeared to be those of a female I followed the sound and soon discovered two ruffians dragging a most beautiful woman towards a boat that waited for them I flew with the utmost speed to rescue the distressed fair one and was happy enough to prove successful in the enterprise for having dispatched one of the villains the other made a precipitate retreat leaving me master of the field  Here however Laura I must stop as here Father Alberto was summoned to attend the Duke The next post shall give you more information concerning the fair unknown in the mean time believe me  Yours affectionately ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  LETTER VI  From the same to the same  FATHER ALBERTO'S goodness having furnished me with ample matter for another letter it is with the greatest pleasure that I now address my Laura I would indeed write oftener than I do were it not that the deep solitude in which I  dwell furnishes nothing worthy of notice When I take up my pen to address you I relinquish it for want of matter Were I to say I love you sincerely  that  you know already so that when I have nothing new to communicate you must not blame me for being silent Thus much for myself in answer to your last We will now proceed to the memoirs of our friend  "AFTER continued he the villains were defeated I was left at full leisure to contemplate the fair unknown who soon recovered such a degree of recollection as to thank me for the service which I had rendered her After gazing with ecstacy  on the most perfect form that I had ever beheld I requested permission to attend her home To this she consented and we proceeded to a very high wall through which by an iron gate we entered a most beautiful garden As we proceeded toward the house which terminated the view she informed me that her name was Estafania that she was the only daughter of a considerable merchant of the name of Altino and heiress to all his fortunes  To that indeed said she I attribute the calamity from which your valour has rescued me The  fame of my wealth  rather than the  lustre of my charms  procured me many suitors Amongst them was Alcanzar for  whom I conceived an insuperable aversion which his subsequent conduct has fully justified He became much exasperated at my behaviour and determined to carry me off by force in which attempt he would have succeeded had not your sword rid me for ever of such a dangerous enemy The service which you have done to me is such as I never can repay I will however now introduce you to the presence of those who will endeavour to testify the gratitude they must entertain for your conduct towards their daughter  Saying this the conducted me into a saloon in the midst of which there played a fountain surrounded by  orangetrees in large vases"But here Laura I must stop as the time will only admit of my subscribbing myself  Yours unalterably  LETTER VII  From the same to the same  YOU are no doubt Laura very anxious for the sequel of Alberto's narrative I shall therefore proceed in his own words as nearly as I can recollect them  "IN the saloon I was introduced to the father and mother of Estafania who on hearing the story of her escape returned their most grateful thanks to her deliverer After remaining some time I proposed to return to the ship and having requested permission to make personal inquiry after the health of Estafania was with difficulty permitted to retire They assured me how happy I should make them by a frequent repetition of my visit and the next day I accordingly returned and was received with every possible demonstration of gratitude Her parents now expressed a wish to know to whom they were endebted for the deliverance of their daughter I informed  them with the utmost frankness of my situation and gave them a short sketch of my memoirs When I concluded they expressed their hopes that fortune would now prove propitious and would cease to persecute me here however they were alas mistaken They presented me with a ring of considerable value and desired me during my residence there to consider their house as my home A request with which I most readily complied as the charms of Estafania had made me her slave For several weeks I enjoyed the most exquisite happiness but it was too great to last Our business being concluded we prepared to visit Spain I quitted Italy  with the utmost reluctance but I was a dependent and could not therefore think of remaining with Estafania although my vanity led me to believe that I was not disagreeable to her When the dreaded hour of departure arrived I repaired to the house of Altino and found Estafania sitting alone in the saloon As it was the last opportunity I should have of seeing her I determined to reveal the sentiments with which she had inspired me She received my declaration with emotion but devoid of surprise assured me that time should never efface from her memory the essential service which I had rendered her that if ever she saw me more she should  think herself too happy that as I proposed returning to Italy the next summer she would in the mean time endeavour to obtain her parents consent that she might bestow her  hand  on one who she said had well deserved her  heart  "Here however Laura I shall stop as here Father Alberto was again summoned to attend the Duke Adieu dearest friend believe me  Ever yours I D VILLAREA  LETTER VIII  From the same to the same  DONNA ISABELLA in continuation  FROM this morning's walk I have learned the rest of Alberto's tale"After continued he I had taken leave of her father and mother I embarked for Spain and  a short voyage landed us at Cadiz But ah how altered was I since I sailed thence I had sustained a loss we never can suffer but once The change it had effected was so striking as to be observed by every one who saw me I now played none but plaintive airs and seldom touched my guitar without bedewing it with my tears I was become the victim of melancholy and the image of Estafania was never absent from my mind At night when fancy was permitted to rove unfettered by the chains of reason I was perpetually wafted to those scenes of former joys the shores of Italy where indeed I enjoyed a bliss supreme the society of my Estafania But alas the blissful  phantoms vanished at the approach of day and each new sun beheld my griefs increase In this manner near a year had elapsed when my kind friend the shipmaster informed me that he was soon to revisit Italy You will easily conceive with what readiness I embraced the proposal and with what anxiety I embarked but when the shores of Italy appeared my anxiety became unutterable Sometimes my fancy represented Estafania welcoming me with joy sometimes her  monument  rose to my view and at other times methought I saw her blessing the arms of some happy rival At length however the wishedfor dreaded hour of debarkation arrived and I  hastened to land"Here a flood of tears relieved my worthy friend and here I shall for the present conclued my narrative Adieu dearest Laura Believe me  Ever yours ISABELLA  LETTER IX  From the same to the same  DONNA ISABELLA in continuation  "SCARCE continued he had I reached the shore before my attention was arrested by the sight of a marble monument erected beneath the shade of a large willow  which seemed to weep over the urn it shadowed I approached with prophetic horror as if I had known that it contained the ashes of the too amiable woman in whose cause I was once so happy as to draw a successful sword What did I not feel when on a nearer approach I discovered that it was inscribed with the name of ESTAFANIA Chilled with horror at the sight I remained motionless till recalled to myself by the approach of a man who had long served the family of her whom I adored From him I learned that some months had elapsed since Heaven had claimed its own A consumption which attacked my amiable mistress soon terminated her sublunary  existence and snatched her from the arms of two worthy and affectionate parents who unable to behold without agony the scenes of former bliss had removed to a distant territory leaving their mansion to the care of servants having determined never to revisit scenes that must necessarily call to remembrance the virtues and the fate of an only child with whom perished all their hopes of earthly happiness  HAVING indulged my grief for some time I returned to the vessel and after passing a sortnight in a state too horrible to be described I returned to Spain Previous to my departure I once more ventured to  visit the urn that contained all the happiness I ever possessed and with an aching heart bid a last adieu to the shores of Italy"Here we were interrupted and here I shall stop as I am too much affected by the sad tale I have just heard to admit of my doing more than subscribing myself  Yours unalterably ISABELLA  LETTER X  From the same to the same  DONNA ISABELLA in continuation  "AFTER my return to Spain continued he I determined to enter into the priesthood and was soon nominated by your uncle to be his chaplain and though happiness  on this side the grave can never be mine yet here I enjoy a quiet life well suited to my disposition In all my distresses I have looked to Heaven for support and have never been disappointed In the practice of religious duties I have a pleasure which is totally independent of worldly circumstances and had much happiness of another fort been my lot I should probably not have experienced that pleasure That every happiness continued he which this world can bestow may be yours is my sincerest wish but if you like me are doomed to live to grief may you like me seek comfort in religion and remember that however melancholy  our prospects may appear the rays of piety and virtue will dispel or at least greatly dissipate the surrounding gloom The mind that is  truly virtuous  can never be  wholly wretched  "Here he ceased and I retired to my chamber to communicate to Laura the conclusion of the wofraught tale It is the property of misfortune to soften the manners and ennoble the mind Those who themselves have suffered are ever prone to pity the sufferings of others But why should I weary my Laura with remarks Nothing that I can advance on the subject will enrich her accomplished mind with one new idea That every happiness  may through life attend her is the sincerest wish of  Her unalterably affectionate ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  LETTER XI  DONNA LAURA to DONNA ISABELLA on her having assumed the Veil  YESTERDAY my Isabella I pronounced the solemn vow by which I am bound to consecrate solely to religion the remainder of my days Many have considered this seclusion from the world as an act  highly meritorious though to me it appears in a light widely different By retiring from the world at the early dawn of life we in a manner quit the station assigned us by Providence and however we may employ ourselves can at best be deemed but deserters Some there are indeed whose weak virtue is ill qualified to resist the powerful attacks it must daily experience from vice and folly these do wisely to fly rater than by a feeble and unsuccessful resistance to increase the triumph of a wicked world Conscious that the small portion of virtue which I possess would scarcely be sufficient to support me in the hour of trial I have determined to shun a foe I am  not able to encounter I am however well aware with what approbation Heaven beholds the conduct of those who though surrounded by the strongest temptations and allured by all the incitements of pleasure continue with unshaken perseverance to tread the paths of virtue and by their bright example reflect honour on their nature and their God For an undertaking so arduous Heaven has fully qualified my Isabella Each noble each heavenly virtue finds an asylum in her breast where they all unite to direct her thoughts and her actions The reward of a life so employed will no doubt be proportionally splendid That it may be long before you claim  that reward is however the sincerest wish of one to whom were heaven to claim its own this world would be a vale of tears  ADIEU my dearest Isabella Believe me  Yours most affectionately And unalterably LAURA DE CASSILDINA  Here I ought to have inserted a letter of Isabella's in reply to the above but an accident that befel it after it came into my possession unhappily rendered the characters totally illegible    LETTER XII  DONNA ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA to DONNA LAURA DE CASSILDINA  OH my Laura how can I paint my present feelings The Duke being suddenly called from home for a few days I determined to gratify an inclination I had long felt and to indulge my feelings by  visiting the hallowed spot where the honoured ashes of my parents moulder Accompanied by Alberto I set out for the village where my infant years were spent At the close of day we reached the hamlet and having secured a lodging at the house of the Curè I repaired with a throbbing heart to the tomb of my parents A grove of cypress appeared I entered with cautious steps as if I feared to waken those who slept It is a covered monument in the form of an altar composed of black and white marble I would have advanced but the scene was too much for my weak spirits I fainted in the arms of Alberto and Marianne When their attention restored me I  approached the tomb and by the pale moon's uncertain light read the inscription which mentioned their names and the dates of their respective deaths O Heaven Laura what were my feelings I fell on my kneesI bedewed the hallowed marble with my tearscalled on each dear departed shadethen turned to heaven my streaming eyes and begged a blessing  IN vain Alberto tried to remove me from the monument for me it bad resistless attractions and whilst memory is mine shall be for ever dear At length I was persuaded to retire but it was with the greatest difficulty I could ever prevail on myself  to quit the awful scene The stream that flowed with melancholy murmurs through the grove seemed to reproach me for quitting the sacred spot but half the night was spent and Alberto feared a longer stay might injure my health I complied with his wish On my arrival at the Curè's I instantly retired to my apartment and notwithstanding the dejection of my spirits I fell asleep Fancy fleeting fancy transported me back to the tomb of Frederic and Eliza It appeared to me after I had remained some time kneeling at their shrine that the monument opened and that I instantly entered the massive portals then closed and I waked to lament an  existence that is indeed painful At the first dawn of the day I revisited the grove and after shedding some tributary tears returned with Alberto to Villarea Adieu dearest Laura  Pity your ISABELLA  LETTER XIII  DONNA ISABELLA to DONNA LAURA  A SEVERE illness has for some time prevented my addressing my Laura but I shall with the greatest pleasure consecrate these first hours of returning health to friendship and to her My illness was indeed of so serious and alarming a nature  that my uncle condescended to make personal inquiries after my health though that wonderful event took place but once during the course of a long illness  I CANNOT say I was very grateful for that one instance of his condescension as though it was not then probable that we should ever meet till time should have destroyed even the remembrance of the illustrious house of Arandina he preserved as much state as if he had been visiting a dying galleyslave rather than a niece who however her unhappy parents may have injured his pride has never by any action of her life derogated from his dignity The  good Alberto was seldom absent from my chamber and endeavoured as much as possible to alleviate my sufferings He offered to inform you of my situation but I chose you should remain in ignorance of those sorrows you could not alleviate I am however so well recovered at present as to walk out in the cool of the evening In the faces of my faithful Marianne and Alberto I can discover the strongest marks of pleasure at my recovery Adieu I am just going to walk The evening is sodivine that if Laura were to accompany me I could easily be persuaded that my connection with this world had ceased and that I had really entered into the bright  regions of eternal day but if that were the case I should see those dear parents who are now no longer the victims of fate  Adieu dearest friend  LETTER XIV  From the same to the same  OH Laura what a scene have I just witnessed We went to walk that we might enjoy the delightful evening Scarcely had we entered the grove that terminates  the lawn when we were alarmed by the clashing of swords and in a moment my terror was increased to the highest at seeing a man with a sword in his hand and covered with blood spring over the sence No sooner did I behold this horrid spectacle than I sunk into the arms of the faithful Marianne Meanwhile the stranger who had thus alarmed us requested our protection informing us that he had just escaped from assassins with whom he had long maintained an unequal combat Father Alberto having assured him of protection directed all his endeavours towards effecting my recovery in which he at length succeeded  and the first object that I beheld was the bleeding stranger kneeling at my feet A sight so horrible occasioned an instantaneous relapse and it was with difficulty my wavering spirit was ever recalled How happy if it then had sought another world and united me to my dear dear parents of whom I am for ever talking with my good old nurse On my recovery I learned what I have just communicated to you We sent the stranger to the gardener's lodge and ordered all possible care and attention to be shown him We would indeed have placed him in the Castle but that we dreaded the Duke's temper which you know is rather  warm The sequel of this strange tale shall be the subject of another letter from  Yours unalterably ISABELLA DONNA VILLAREA  LETTER XV  DONNA ISABELLA in continuation  I AM just returned from a visit to the lodge in company with Alberto We had an interview with the unfortunate stranger who is now so much recovered from his wounds as to sit in the garden on a bench for some hours every day At our approach  he attempted to rise but from loss of blood was too feeble After recovering himself a little and returning his thanks in the most pleasing manner he thus addressed us  I am the only son of Albino de Castina a merchant in Cadiz who has a small house in this neighbourhood whither I was going when attacked by the ruffians from whom you so kindly protected me They were hired to assassinate me by a woman of considerable wealth who has done me the honour to entertain sentiments in my favour To these I made not a suitable return which has so exasperated her that she determined on having a bloody revenge On that revenge  I shall ever reflect with pleasure since to it I am indebted for the honour of being known to the present company My humble situation in life precludes me from testifying my gratitude in any way but by words yet you will I trust do me the justice to believe me when I assure you that the  power  alone is wanting on my part and that my  life  my only possession will for ever be at the devotion of those to whom I am indebted for its prolongation  HE was by this time so much exhausted that Father Alberto interrupted his grateful effusions and after repeating our injunctions to the  servants we retired We have sent to inform his father of the misfortune that had befallen him and his arrival is hourly expected Thus much of our poor  protegé  Of myself I have nothing to say but that I am as usual  Yours unalterably And ever affectionately ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  LETTER XVI  From the same to the same  MY  protegé  is now so well recovered as to think of returning to Cadiz There is something in his manner that interests me much in his behalf You cannot conceive how I pity him the more as he has no prospect of being able to pacify  the enraged fair one unless he were to consecrate to her service the remainder of a life which she has so basely attempted to shorten He seems much engrossed with his own reflections and is I fancy the slave of some less willing damsel than his  intended murderess  If this be the case he has my best wishes for his success He is an unfortunate man and 'twere pity he should suffer more He has returned thanks for the favours which he has received and is preparing to depart He goes next week He is really an amiable man I wish he were known to Laura But why should I wish him to contemplate charms which he never could possess Why should  I add despair to the catalogue of his misfortunes  THE Duke sets off tomorrow for Madrid I wish my Laura were to supply his place at the Castle But Laura has vowed eternal solitude she consecrates to religion alone those hours which if sometimes devoted to friendship would make me happy beyond conception Oh that my poor rhetoric could have prevailed on her not to pronounce the fatal vow How wish I that it were in my power to visit you in the absence of the Duke but I fear he would not approve of my always running away the moment he left the Castle though this might be construed  into a great compliment to him as it would imply that the Castle is intolerable when he is not here to enliven the scene I will sot however devote all my paper to complimenting the Duke but will reserve room enough to admit of my subscribing myself  Yours unalterably  LETTER XVII  From the same to the same  WHY does my Laura reproach me with want of affection Why say that my letters are less friendly than before What proof can I give her of that friendship which I now do and ever shall entertain for my amiable nun What  will convince her that I am as much hers now as when we first joined in choral praises to the Deity Oh Laura how have I wept over your cruel page If ever I cease to value your friendship may I then cease my trembling hand with reluctance writes the dire sentence to enjoy it but that fatal period can never arrive till your deserted Isabella seeks the peaceful abodes of death Do not by cruel accusations embitter the already wretched life of your poor Isabella Do not add the loss of your esteem to the sad catalogue of her woes at the recital of which you have so often wept so bitterly lamented I can say no more my tears obliterate faster than I write  O pity a wretch whom Providence has so severely visited and do not deprive her of her only friendher only earthly comfort Adieu Tho' deprived of your friendship I will still be yours and yours alone  LETTER XVIII  From ALONZO DE CASTINA to DONNA ISABELLA  NOTHING but my having already experienced your goodness could lead me to hope your pardon for the liberty I am going to take but I cannot bid adieu to my kind benefactress without earnestly  soliciting an interview of five minutes at which no third person shall be present I trust the will have the goodness to add this favour to the many she has already conferred on him who is with gratitude and respect her devoted slave If you will not grant at least pardon the request of  ALONZO DE CASTINA  LETTER XIX  DONNA ISABELLA  in answer  I HAVE this instant received your billet containing a request with which it is totally impossible that I should comply The service which I rendered you merits few thanks Alleviating the sufferings of my fellowcreatures is to me at once a duty and  a pleasure I conduced myself toward you as I should toward any other person whom I had seen in your state By not repeating your request you may obtain the pardon of  ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  LETTER XX  ALONZO DE CASTINA to DONNA ISABELLA  I LIKE a coward fled from death and now life is decreed to be my punishment doomed as I am to worship those charms I must never more behold How much more enviable had been my lot if covered  with wounds I had expired at the feet of Isabella My fate might then have obtained her pity I should at least have escaped her scorn But since my pardon can be obtained only by never repeating my request I will retire to some solitude where I will continue to regret the interposition of Providence that preserved my life merely that I might experience the scorn of that woman at whose feet I should have with pleasure breathed my last But I must submit What can the wretched do They can only lament and to that employment will Alonzo consecrate the remainder of a life which was once preserved and is now embittered by the too amiable Isabella  whilst that every happiness may attend her shall be the constant prayer of one who must for ever regret the distance which fortune has placed between him and happiness  LETTER XXI  DONNA ISABELLA to DONNA LAURA  I HAVE this day received from Alonzo two letters which I send you inclosed together with my answer I hope you will approve of it though perhaps it was cruel to refuse him one five minutes interview  he is so much hurt by the refusal However he is gone so I shall dismiss the subject But do tell me whether or not you would have granted the request I wish you had been here to advise me Was it wrong to refuse him Do write me word My head achs so much that I shall go and walk a little At my return I will finish my letter  OH Laura I am undone I have seen Alonzo I went alone to walk in the grove I had not been long there when Alonzo rushing from amongst the trees threw himself at my feet He earnestly begged a moment's audience I weakly complied listened to the most eloquent  of beings He sighed knelt vowed eternal love and has ruined the peace of Isabella I fear I love him but I will conquer myself Am I not right How do you advise me to act Do tell me I am half distracted What must I do I have exiled him What more can I do Do tell me and believe me  Ever yours ISABELLA  LETTER XXII  DON ALONZO to DONNA ISABELLA  IN obedience to the commands of her I adore I am now at Cadiz where I propose to remain till once more permitted to urge my suit in person I trust however that your  correspondence  is a blessing I shall be  permitted to enjoy as if  that  be withheld my exile will be insupportable Prudence indeed may dictate a refusal but prudence is not sufficiently powerful to render Isabella cruel yet such she must be esteemed were she to answer this petition by a denial as that would render the life she preserved for ever wretched Whatever be the result of this letter Isabella will be ever adored by  ALONZO  LETTER XXIII  DONNA ISABELLA  in reply  I HAVE just received your letter containing a requestthe compliance with which would certainly be highly inconsistent with prudence But alas prudence deserted me where most I needed her support My conduct in the grove has already  convinced you that I am not insensible of your merit Do not however wish to form a connection with one who has through life been unfortunate and who were she to bestow that hand you so earnestly solicit would bring as a portion miseries of which she trusts you will be for ever ignorant By corresponding with you I should only encourage hopes which I can never gratify and were the Duke to become acquainted with our correspondence I should immediately forfeit his protection You would then receive to your arms a poor deserted orphan whose only inheritance is misfortune and whose sole possession is an aching heart Do not suffer your reason to  be blinded by a violent and consequently shortlived passion Before the circling year shall restore that day on which you first beheld me you will almost have forgotten that the wretched writer of these lines exists Do not in the mean time by your importunities increase the afflictions of  ISABELLA  LETTER XXIV  DONNA ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  to  DONNA LAURA DE CASSILDINA  OH Laura that fatal interview has destroyed my repose I insisted on Alonzo's instantly quitting the neighbourhood and forbade him my presence for ever He retired in silence but since his departure  he has written to me requesting my correspondence This of course I refused and have urged such reasons as will I hope be deemed sufficient even by Alonzo Righteous heaven to know Isabella is to be unfortunate I have not the power of conferring happiness on any one All I wish is to render no one miserable  INCLOSED you will receive his letter and my reply From that reply you will learn that he has made some impression on a heart that was that must be ever yours O that when Providence determined to prolong Alonzo's days it had not chosen the wretched Isabella as its instrument  I should not then have known that he existed My years would probably have elapsed undisturbed by those feelings which now distract my soul Grant Heaven I be not numbered amongst the crowds of victims that have fallen before its shrine If ever the remembrance of my sad tale should be perpetuated I perhaps like Heloise may experience the pity of posterity When my aching heart shall have long ceased to beat perhaps some kindred spirit may drop one tributary tear on my cold relics But whither is my fancy roving How far beyond the bounds of reason Do dear Laura write to Alonzo Endeavour to convince him  of his own imprudence If you succeed you will eternally oblige  Your ISABELLA  LETTER XXV  DONNA LAURA  to  DON ALONZO  YOU will no doubt be much surprised at the receipt of a letter from one who is totally unknown to you Your surprise will probably receive no small addition  when you discover that your correspondent is one whose life is devoted to religious retirement Not who has retired from the world in disgust but who has never experienced either its pains or its pleasures one whom nothing but the interest she takes in the misfortunes of an amiable friend could have induced to address a person to whom she is an entire stranger But at the request of that Isabella for whom you profess so serious a regard I shall endeavour to convince you that by continuing to solicit a hand you never can obtain you will only inflict misery on her whom you profess to adore without in any degree advancing your own wishes You have not to learn that  your rank in life leaves you no room to hope for the approbation of her uncle one of the proudest grandees of Spain  YOu are not ignorant of the misfortunes of her parents and can you wish that by your means Isabella should experience a similar fate The only manner in which you can testify the sincerity of your attachment is by desisting from your present pursuit By this conduct and by this  alone  will you ever convince her that your gratitude is lasting Should the arguments I have advanced prove sufficient to effect the purpose for which they are intended I shall esteem you a truly  grateful man but if you persist in soliciting the hand of Isabella such conduct will plainly evince that your  own  happiness and not that of Isabella is the object of your pursuit  I remain your wellwisher LAURA DE CASILDINA  LETTER XXVI  DON ALONZO to DONNA ISABELLA  NOT satisfied with blasting all my hopes yourself you invite others to join you in the cruel employment Your friend Donna Laura has written to me a long expostulatory letter in which she calmly advises me to desist from my present  pursuit as by that conduct and by that  alone  she says I can ever convince you that my gratitude is lasting Gratitudewhat a word is that If I am permitted to be only grateful the preservation of my life I must consider as a misfortune for I love you I adore you and feel that without a return of love I must for ever be wretched That I am not worthy of such a return I am more sensible than your friend can be but if you be determined to listen to no addresses but those which are worthy of you to the exquisite happiness resulting from a mutual attachment you must for ever remain a stranger for the man has not yet been born whose accomplishments  entitle him to the heart and hand of Isabella That in me it is presumption to pretend to either I needed not the information of Donna Laura to convince me but from her alone have I learned that my birth is the great obstacle in my way to happiness Of the inferiority of my rank in life to that of the Duke of Arandina I am not ignorant but can Isabellacan the daughter of Donna Eliza put wealth or titles or a long line of ancestry in the balance against the purest and most refined attachment that ever inhabited a human breast Your friend says that you canthat you deem my addresses disgraceful and that they inflict misery upon you If this be  indeed the case I will cease to urge them That I should ever cease to love you till I cease to exist is impossible but my love shall not be your torment may you be happy though I must be wretched But surely a mind angelic as yours cannot delight in the wretchedness of others And since your correspondence as a friend would afford much relief to my aching heart  that  I hope you will not refuse to one who will receive with ecstacy and remember with gratitude the inestimable gift If even this favour be denied me I will instantly bid an eternal adieu to Spain and wander over the world till death shall kindly put a period to my sufferings Whilst an  aged parent and an only sister will join with me in lamenting the distance of rank which fortune has placed between the too lovely Isabella and the exile who adores her In anxious expectation of you're answer  I remain Your devoted slave ALONZO  LETTER XXVII  DONNA ISABELLA  in reply  MY friendship you have had from the moment I first saw you and sooner than drive you to the extremities you threaten I will not even refuse you my correspondence provided that no references to that unhappy passion which now  reigns in your breast shall ever occur in any of your letters On these terms I consent occasionally to correspond with you Moved indeed by pity for those to whom the execution of your rash threats must occasion so much pain If in any instance you transgress this rule you will hear no more from  ISABELLA  LETTER XXVIII  DONNA ISABELLA  to  DONNA LAURA  I BLUSH to inform you that Alonzo has obtained my permission to correspond with me Of the terms on which and the reasons why I have granted this request you will see a full account in the inclosed letter I fear I have acted imprudently  yet what could I do Had I obstinately refused my consent he might have been driven to despair and might have embittered the evening of an aged parent's life whilst his innocent sister would have been reduced to a situation truly forlorn and I when it was too late should have regretted the step which I had taken However this affair may terminate I shall have the comfort of knowing that I acted in that manner which to my weak judgement appeared the best Do write to me immediately and if you cannot approve the conduct at least pity the situation of your  ISABELLA  LETTER XXIX  DONNA LAURA  to  DONNA ISABELLA  LOVE frequently on its first appearance assumes the mask of friendship Even then the disguise is easily penetrated But when love has once appeared in its proper colours and only assumes the mask of friendship  in the hour when its hopes are on the point of destruction then the deception  may  nay  must  be visible to every observer however superficial Friendship has often brightened into love but love hás seldom if ever sunk into friendship O Isabella what could tempt you to sign the rash promise You regret the want of advisers Where was your faithful Alberto when you took the precipitate step You cannot in this instance obtain the approbation but you will always possess the pity and the friendship of  LAURA  LFTTERR XXX  DONNA ISABELLA  to  DONNA LAURA  YOUR letter has this instant reached me You cannot conceive how it has hurt me as I am sure my conduct must have been highly culpable to have occasioned so severe a letter from my Laura  You blame me for not consulting Alberto He alas good man is gone to Madrid But my state of mind has for some time been so agitated as to banish every idea I could wish to have retained Had he been here rest assured I had never taken even a step of much less importance than that alluded to without his sanction I am so dejected that I can scarcely refrain from tears Adieu dear Laura Believe me  Ever yours ISABELLA  LETTER XXXI  DONNA LUCINDA DE GONZARA  to  DON ALONZO  KNOW detested man vengeance is now within my reach and if I neglect the bright opportunity may Heaven curse me I prepare you for the blow only to increase your punishment by the horrors of  anticipationFeel them and tremble  THAT affection with which unworthy as you are I once honoured you is now changed into a hatred that shall pursue you if possible beyond the graveit shall at least conduct you thither Nothing but your death can satiate the revenge of a slighted woman  LETTER XXXII  DONNA LUCINDA to DON JOHN DUKE OF ARANDINA  DON JOHN  SOME time ago as a young man of the name of Castina was travelling near the Castle of Villarea being attacked by robbers he escaped though not unhurt into  the groves of Villarea There he found your niece who conducted him to the gardener's lodge where he remained till healed of his wounds During his confinement he was constantly visited by your niece Donna Isabella who the day of his departure favoured him with a private interviewwhen they exchanged the most solemn vows of perpetual attachment These facts I had from your gardener who was himself working in the grove at the time Now Don Alonzo is under an engagement to marry me and I am sure you would not wish your niece should wrong any woman so as to rob her of a contracted husband I therefore hope you will forbid him  to continue his addresses You will easily procure some other husband for your niece and will render a great service to your wellwisher  LUCINDA DE GONZARA  LETTER XXXIII  DUKE OF ARANDINA in reply  WOMAN  IF he be not sent to the  mines  as a reward due to his uncommon presumption you may enjoy your fellow unrivalled by the niece of  DON JOHN DUKE OF ARANDINA  LETTER XXXIV  DON ALONZO  to  DONNA ISABELLA  SURE Hell contains no fiend equal to a slighted female The truth of this assertion is fully proved by the inclosed letter but as her malice cannot deprive me of Isabella I have little to dread from  her threats Her former attempt has made me cautious how I venture abroad alone or unarmedTomorrow I set out for Corseyda where I shall have the happiness of being within a league of Villarea and where with all impatience I shall expect the blessing of a line from my Isabella  ALONZO DE CASTINA  LETTER XXXV  DONNA ISABELLA  to  DON ALONZO  I HAVE just received your letter and own that the contents have occasioned some painful sensations in my breast Our sex however amiable they often are however tender their feelings yet when slighted seldom fail to revenge themselves  and that in the most cruel manner You will do well to keep within your own territories as there alone you will be in safety  THE Duke and Father Alberto return tomorrow I expect the arrival of the good Alberto my kind counsellor with much anxiety Had he not been absent you would probably never have prevailed on me to subscribe myself  Yours c ISABELLA  LETTER XXXVI  DONNA ISABELLA  to  DONNA LAURA  TOMORROW the Duke and good Alberto return I have now remained here in solitude a whole month Oh that that month had been passed at the dear convent of  Ventina for then Alonzo would never have triumphed over my prudence He it is true at present corresponds solely as a friend but I fear he will embrace the first opportunity to lay aside the disguise which he has been forced to assume and will appear once more as my lover I have I fear gone too far to retreat Do direct me How I long for the arrival of good Alberto I will tell him all and then let him direct my future conduct O how I long for tomorrowAdieu Believe me  Ever yours ISABELLA  LETTER XXXVII  FATHER ALBERTO  to  DONNA LAURA  AT the request of your Isabella I have taken up my pen to communicate to you every circumstance relating to her present misfortune Last night the Duke returned and retired to his apartment  without any thing remarkable in his conduct But this morning he ordered all the servants to attend him in the great hall when producing a letter from a woman of the name of Gonzara the woman who endeavored to procure the assassination of Alonzo he obliged the gardener to read it aloud It contained a full account of Alonzo's rencounter with Isabella in the grove as well as of the parting scene which took place in my absence This account she said was communicated to her by the gardener who now threw himself on his knees and implored the Duke's pardon for having concealed the affair from his knowledge No sooner was the Duke convinced that  his information was well founded than his appearance ceased to be human The man was instantly dismissed for having concealed from the Duke what for a few dollars he had communicated to Gonzara Poor Isabella during this scene had swooned Happily every attempt to recover her proved ineffectual so that she was insensible of the abuse with which she was loaded by the Duke I intreated the Duke to be less violent assuring him that I had been the adviser of Isabella through the whole of the affair at least as far as related to receiving Alonzo when wounded and to procuring a proper attendance to be paid to him during his illness Adding at  the same time that illustrious as was the house of Arandina it must ever receive additional lustre from acts of mercy and benevolence and that no station however exalted could exempt us from the duties which we owe to our fellowpilgrims in the vale of tears To this the Duke replied that I was the first person who had ever proposed to convert his gardener's lodge into an infirmary for all rogues who happened to quarrel on his estate and that both his niece and I were very much to blame for the part we had acted I said Whatever might be the errors of Isabella I was sure they would on inquiry prove to be those of the head and not of the heart and that  the former were very excusable in people of her age and who like her were totally unacquainted with the customs of the world He at length became a little pacified permitted Isabella to be removed and postponed any farther inquiry till tomorrow when you shall hear more from  Madam  Your very obedient servant ALBERTO  LETTER XXXVIII  FATHER ALBERTO  to the same  THE illness of your friend is this day considerably increased she is now very feverish and I fear in great danger she is not yet delirious but weeps incessantly and sighs out the name of Laura Her  love for you is indeed very great and she is well worthy of that affecttion which we both entertain for her she is certainly an angel in flesh and blood Much as she now suffers from his treachery she has insisted on my carrying the gardener thirty dollars that he and his family may not suffer want an their dismission from the Duke's service For said she though he has greatly injured me and betrayed the trust I reposed in him yet perhaps he was in want of money and could not withstand the proffered bribe At any rate his  family  are innocent and  they  will be greatly distressed till he is able to procure some employment Thus does she practice that important  duty so inculcated by the great Author of our faith How bright is the example she affords and how few will endeavour to imitate such an original She has sent for me I must therefore cease to descant on a subject so truly pleasing to him  Who is Madam with respect Your obedient servant ALBERTO  LETTER XXXIX  From the same to the same  I HAVE the pleasure to inform you that our amiable friend is somewhat better She this day gave me an account of her whole conduct She has preserved the copies of all Alonzo's letters and her answers  The original letters of Alonzo are she says in your possession as well as her answers Had Isabella been more versed in the ways of the world she would certainly not have permitted Alonzo to Correspond with her But how few are there whose lives are marked with a single imprudence and that of no very serious nature  AT her request I communicated her letters and those of Alonzo to the Duke who raved like a madman He recounted all his ancestors for thirty generations called on them to pour down vengeance on the head of their disgraceful descendant the amiable Isabella vowed  eternal vengeance to Alonzo for whom he sent a messenger requiring his immediate attendance In vain did I endeavour to place the conduct of Isabella in the most favourable point of view in vain did I observe that she discouraged all hopes in the breast of Alonzo He still continued to rave at Isabella till on the arrival of Alonzo his fury took another course No sooner did this unfortunate youth appear than he loaded him with every possible insult and at last struck him On this Alonzo drew his sword but happily was disarmed by the attendants The Duke now ordered his hands to be tied and producing his patent of creation read it aloud to Alonzo In it were  enumerated thirty titles of honour and amongst others the Earldom of Joppa Viscount Mount Sinai and Baron Capernaum granted to his ancestor by Godfrey de Boulogne King of Jerusalem  He now asked Alonzo how the son of a merchant could  presume  to offer himself to a daughter of the house of Arandina in any higher capacity than that of a lackey Told him that if ever he was found within his territories he would secure him an appointment in the mines and then dismissed him Alonzo retired vowing vengeance whilst I used all my art to dissuade the Duke  from visiting the poor Isabella and happily I succeeded He is now gone to vent is fury in the grove That he may there recover his reason is the sincerest wish of  Madam  Yours cALBERTO  LETTER XL  From the same to the same  ISABELLA has at length been pardoned by the Duke after having received a great deal of what he calls wholesome advice The terms on which he has consented to pardon her and to which she has  acceded are these That she shall never more see or correspond with Alonzo that she shall in two months retire to Ventina and at the end of her probationary year shall assume the veil  Poor girl I pity her sincerely for she is really attached to Alonzo and he seems equally partial to her I hope to prevail with the Duke to mitigate her sentence and that he will not drive an amiable woman to a perpetual seclusion from a world which she would adorn by her splendid virtues Heaven never hears with approbation the vows of involuntary victims In that class I must rank  Isabella as love possesses too great a portion of her heart to admit of her becoming a good nun She may like Heloise retire to a cloister but love will erect an altar in her cell whilst her sighs will ever fan the destructive flame  To your prayers Madam I shall now recommend her whilst I remain With respect  Yours c ALBERTO  LETTER XLI  DONNA ISABELLA  to  DONNA LAURA  SINCE Heaven has for wise and good reasons prolonged my life I hope there is yet some mercy in store for your Isabella The good  Alberto has by this time informed you of all that has befallen me within these few days The obligations I owe him are unspeakable Heaven reward him I never can You know the terms on which I have procured my pardon and you pity me Adieu dearest Laura I am too feeble to write more  Good God how wretched is your ISABELLA THIS letter is languid as my wasted frame  LETTER XLIII  DON ALONZO  to  DONNA ISABELLA  O ISABELLA that for one moment I could forget that I adore youBut stop he is the uncle of my Isabellahe shall live  Just Heaven what did I not suffer on that evertoberemembered day The bare recollection distracts me I hear you are not well For pity's sake write to me Tell me how you do tell me who betrayed the secret of our correspondence How I pant for vengeance But Isabella still shall direct the conduct of  ALONZO  P S When my sword was levelled at his breast why was I disappointed of my revenge Curse on the hated tyrantBut whither am I hurrying I write nonsense I am mad with rageIf he presume to insult my Isabella  by Heaven he dies Oh Isabella I can write no more It is my  sword  and not my  pen  I wish to wield  LETTER XLIII  DONNA ISABELLA  to  DON ALONZO  I HAVE just received your letter which to me was totally unintelligible I was ignorant of your ever having seen the Duke The  kind Alberto unwilling to increase my pain had concealed from me that fatal interview to which your letter alludes I do not wonder that you were exasperated such treatment no one could bear It was unmerited it was unjust in the last extreme But yet my Alonzo when vengeance lifts her sword and points it at the breast of Don John let the tears of Isabella avert the blowOh Alonzo you can give me no proof of that affection you prosess for meso real so pleasing so generousas by pardoning Don John O ever bear in mind that he is the sole earthly protector of that Isabella whom you profess to adore  I am poorNever till now did I wish for wealthyet if I possessed it I would not injure thy generous soul by the offer No the only bribe I will ever propose as the reward of your forbearanceis my friendship  that  is the sole offering I can make at the shrine of your injured honour Oh may it be deemed sufficient so shall you ever possess the esteem of  ISABELLA  LETTER XLIV  DON ALONZO in reply  MY present bliss is too great to last Offered the friendship of IsabellaIs that  valued  that envied treasure to be mine at last  Vengeance no by Heaven he shall experience none from me he shall live but to you he is indebted for the prolongation of his daysdetested tyrant Oh Isabella my gratitude shall be lasting as my life I can write no more I am drunk with joy Believe me to be with sincerest gratitude  Your devoted slave ALONZO  LETTER XLIV  DONNA ISABELLA to DONNA LAURA  ALL my apprehensions for the safety of the Duke being removed by the promise Alonzo has given me not to take vengeance on  him for his conduct at the Castle I shall now express to my Laura the fears I entertain concerning my future happiness Oh my Laura how little do we shortsighted mortals know what will be conducive to our happiness The time was when I thought that no event however gloomy in its appearance could be deemed unfortunate if it was the occasion of my returning to Ventina and to you But ah how changed are all my sentiments How often have I wearied Heaven with prayers that I might return to Ventina  now  the mention of those walls fills my mind with horror Why this wonderful change Is Laura  less beloved than before No  that  is impossibleIs Isabella less enamoured of virtue than she once was She hopes notIs her heart a stranger to love Ah no  that  is the sad truthAlonzo is beloved Within Ventina's walls he never must appear yet Villarea is not more  propitious  to his wishes than Ventina But the solemn vow I so soon must make chills my blood with horror Have mercy on me Heaven Oh How my heart throbs Adieu dear Laura Sympathise with  Your ISABELLA  LETTER XLV  DONNA LAURA  to  DONNA ISABELLA  LAURA cannot relieve but she sincerely sympathises with her dear Isabella How cruel how  truly detestable is her uncle What says the good Alberto  to  these proceedings He cannot approve them No one can refrain from pouring the severest censures on such horrid conduct Heavens how I detest that tyrant  OH Isabella that I could but mitigate your pains Your apartments here are bespoke The Lady Abbess speaks of you in the kindest manner but sincerely regrets your present returnas it is so contrary to your wishes  MAY you my dear friend when you revisit these walls regain your longlost peace Adieu Believe me ever  Yours unalterably LAURA  END OF VOLUME FIRST
