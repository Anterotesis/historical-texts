LUDGATESTREET MDCCLXXXVI  TO THE SURVIVING MEMBERS OF THAT TRULY AMIABLE FAMILY OF WHICH MISS M  s WAS ONCE A BRIGHT A DISTINGUISHED AND A JUSTLY VALUED ORNAMENT ARE THE FOLLOWING LINES INSCRIBED BY THEIR SYMPATHIZING FRIEND THE AUTHOR  ADVERTISEMENT  THESE lines are sacred to the memory of ONE who not satisfied with the attainment of every female excellence and every human virtue soared on adventurous wing into the regions of science and philosophy She successfully rivalled those who have long been accustomed to behold with  indifference  if not  with  contempt  the efforts of feminine genius when either classical learning or philosophical disquisition have been the objects of pursuit  ALIKE distinguished by elegance of manners by brilliancy of imagination and soundness of judgment it is almost needless to observe that whilst living she commanded the esteem and admiration of all who were so fortunate as to rank in the number of her friends and who now join in sincerely regretting that Heaven has for ever veiled from their eyes ONE whose  beauty wit and virtue adorned a sex that has seldom if ever produced her superior  IT is with just diffidence that these lines are now submitted to the public inspection The Author had withheld them from the press in expectation that some abler bard would tune the lyre to the memory of his lamented friend Encouraged however by the reception of a former work he once more ventures himself as a candidate for public approbation convinced that if it be merited it will not be withheld  IN the Elegy he has expressed his hopes that the poetical powers of Mr Graves  The ingenious author of Euphrosyne c c  the elegant panegyrist of Miss M  s in her infancy will once more be exerted in paying a worthy tribute to her memory Should the perusal of these lines suggest to that accomplished scholar the idea of favouring the world with a fresh specimen of his poetical talents the Author will have the satisfaction of knowing that however little his own performance may have merited the  indulgence  of the public it will have given birth to one  that will challenge universal  applause  and perpetuate the virtues of his amiable and accomplished friendto whom alas he now bids a reluctant adieu in the words of Milton  "Since to part  "Go heavenly guest aetherial messenger  "Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore  "Gentle to me and affable hath been  "Thy condescension and shall be honoured ever  "With grateful memory"  PAR LOST Book viii  INNER TEMPLE London  January    AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH of MISS M  s  AS yet 'twas  fancied  woes alone I sung  But now by  real  grief my lyre is strung  'Tis HARRIET's gentle shade demands the lay  Do thou MELPOMENE the tribute pay  Dear to the Muses to the Graces dear  They all shall weep o'er HARRIET's honour'd bier  HARRIET who from wisdom's hallowed page  Had snatch'd the spoil of every distant age  Pardon thou honour'd shade these untaught lays  In which I vainly 'tempt to sing thy praise  Alas no rude no untaught verse like mine  Is incense worthy of a HARRIET's shrine  An  abler  bard thy many virtues claim  An abler bard  shall  celebrate thy name  Now shall the lyre  again  by him be strung  Who in the down of life  Vide a Collection of Poems entitled Euphrosyne vol i p written by Mr Graves the classical author of the Spiritual Quixote Columella and Anecdotes of the Golden Vale  thy praises sung  GRAVES shall the sad the mournful tribute pay  And hail thy spirit in the realms of day  Each female charm each human virtue thine  By MANLIUS by me by all esteem'd divine  Long may we gaze on beauty's varied throng  And give to them the gently flowing song  But when ah when shall we  thy  equal see  When look on her we may compare with thee  IN yonder shade whilst Harriet's urn we place  That shade which once her charms were wont to grace  Behold you lovely weeping woeworn train  The boasted pride of this our village plain  Who at this awful hour by sorrow led  Seek the drear mansions of the silent dead  And at a much lov'd sister's hallow'd bier  Pay the sad tribute of a hopeless tear  Whilst MANLIUS whose generous breast is fraught  With all the virtue Grecian sages taught  Midst midnight horror and funereal gloom  Resign'd beholds a much lov'd daughter's tomb  Yet deem not ye that he no sorrow feels  'Tis true philosophy his grief conceals  Know on his peace this dire misfortune preys  And will we dread cut short his valu'd days  BUT mark yon aged venerable band  Who round their HARRIET's grave in sorrow stand  Those are the sons of poverty and woe  Whose tears at her command had ceas'd to flow  But by her death alas their woes revive  Again with penury they're doom'd to strive  Ah say who now shall all their grief assuage  Ah say who now shall cheer their drooping age  MANLIUS in whose breast each virtue reigns  'Tis HE shall  now  support these aged swains  Shall bid their cruel fears' their sorrows cease  And smooth their passage to the realms of peace  BUT say what form majestic now appears  Oppress'd by sorrow and dissolv'd  tears  Her sighs her groans her wild distracted air  All all proclaim a wretched MOTHER's care  Now o'er the yawning grave she wildly bends  And now to heaven unnumber'd sighs she sends  Whilst both her sons sad partners of her woe  In silent grief their heartfelt sorrow shew  IN slow procession o'er the gloomy plain  See the sad father lead the wretched train  Who now in solemn silence homeward turn  And quit reluctant quit their HARRIET's urn  But mark tho' chang'd the spot not chang'd the scene  Nor yet their bosoms know a grief serene  For lo the sight of yonder dreary walls  Her  lov'd idea and  their  grief recals  Their grief may heaven in pity soon bid cease  Soon may their tortur'd souls be hush'd to peace  May heavenborn hope direct their streaming eyes  To those bless'd realms beyond the azure skies  Where HARRIET's virtues meet a bright reward  From HEAVEN's ALMIGHTY AND ETERNAL LORD  THE EPITAPH  TRAV'LER who e'er thou art that seek'st this tomb  And view'st with pleasure the surrounding gloom  Stay nor to beauty's urn thy tears refuse  But let them fall like summer's sweetest dews  O long uninjur'd may this willow wave  And long protect this ever honour'd grave  For  know  beneath its sadly drooping shade  There rest the ashes of  a lovely maid    If virtuous worth be heaven's peculiar care  She does its brightest noblest pleasures share  Do thou by Harriet's bright example led  The unfrequented paths of virtue tread  So shalt thou dauntless meet the power of death  And so shall hope receive thy latest breath  FINIS
