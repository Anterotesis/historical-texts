 She Stoops to Conquer OR The Mistakes of a Night  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  She Stoops to Conquer OR The Mistakes of a Night A COMEDY AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN WRITTEN BY Doctor GOLDSMITH  LONDON Printed for F NEWBERY in St Paul's ChurchYard MDCCLXXIII  To  SAMUEL JOHNSON L L D  Dear Sir  BY inscribing this slight performance to you I do not mean so much to compliment you as myself It may do me some honour to inform the public that I have lived many years in intimacy with you It may serve the interests of mankind also to inform them that the greatest wit may be found in a character without impairing the most unaffected piety  I have particularly reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance The undertaking a comedy not merely sentimental was very dangerous and Mr Colman who saw this piece in its various stages always thought it so However I ventured to trust it to the public and though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season I have every reason to be grateful  I am Dear Sir Your most sincere friend And admirer OLIVER GOLDSMITH  PROLOGUE  By DAVID GARRICK Esq  Enter Mr  WOODWARD  Dressed in Black and holding a Handkerchief to his Eyes  EXCUSE  me Sirs I prayI can't yet speak  I'm crying nowand have been all the week  'Tis not alone this mourning suit  good masters  I've that within  for which there are no plaisters  Pray wou'd you know the reason why I'm crying  The Comic muse long sick is now a dying  And if she goes my tears will never stop  For as a play'r I can't squeeze out one drop  I am undone that's allshall lose my bread  I'd rather but that's nothinglose my head  When the sweet maid is laid upon the bier  Shuter  and  I  shall be chief mourners here  To her a mawkish  of spurious breed  Who deals in s  t  tals will succeed  Poor  Ned  and  I  are dead to all intents  We can as soon speak  Greek  as  sentiments  Both nervous grown to keep our spirits up  We now and then take down a hearty cup  What shall we doIf Comedy forsake us  They'll turn us out and no one else will take us  But why can't I be moralLet me try  My heart thus pressingfix'd my face and eye  With a sententious look that nothing means  Faces are blocks in sentimental scenes  Thus I begin  All is not gold that glitters  Pleasure seems sweet but proves a glass of bitters  When ign'rance enters folly is at hand  Learning is better far than house and land  Let not your virtue trip who trips may stumble  And virtue is not virtue if she tumble  I give it upmorals won't do for me  To make you laugh I must play tragedy  One hope remainshearing the maid was ill  A  doctor  comes this night to shew his skill  To cheer her heart and give your muscles motion  He in  five draughts  prepar'd presents a potion  A kind of magic charmfor be assur'd  If y  swallow it the maid is cur'd  But d  p  te the Doctor and her case is  If you reject the d  se and make wry faces  This truth he boasts will beast it while he lives  No  pois'nous drugs  are mix'd in what he gives  Should he succeed you'll give him his degree  If not within he will receive no fee  The college  you  must his pretensions back  Pronounce him  regular  or dub him  quack  EPILOGUE  By Dr GOLDSMITH  WELL  having stoop'd to conquer with success  And gain'd a husband without aid from dress  Still as a Barmaid I could wish it too  As I have conquer'd him to conquer you  And let me say for all your resolution  That pretty Barmaids have done execution  Our life is all a play compos'd to please  "We have our exits and our entrances"  The first act shews the simple country maid  Harmless and young of ev'ry thing asraid  Blushes when hir'd and with unmeaning action  I hopes as how to give you satisfaction  Her second act displays a livelier scene  Th' unblushing Barmaid of a country inn  Who whisks about the house at market caters  Talks loud coquets the guests and scolds the waiters  Next the scene shifts to town and there she soars  The chop house toast of ogling connoissieurs  On 'Squires and Cits she there displays her arts  And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts  And as she smiles her triumphs to compleat  Even Common Councilmen forget to eat  The fourth act shews her wedded to the 'Squire  And Madam now begins to hold it higher  Pretends to taste at Operas cries  caro  And quits her Nancy Dawson for  Che Faro  Doats upon dancing and in all her pride  Swims round the room the  Heinel  of Cheapside  Ogles and leers with artificial skill  Till having lost in age the power to kill  She sits all night at cards and ogles at spadille  Such thro' our lives the eventful history  The fifth and last act still remains for me  The Barmaid now for your protection prays  Turns Female Barrister and leads for

in an old fashioned  HOUSE  Enter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  and  Mr HARDCASTLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I Vow Mr Hardcastle you're very particular Is there a creature in the whole country but ourselves that does not take a trip to town now and then to rub off the rust a little There's the two Miss Hoggs and our neighbour Mrs Grigsby go to take a month's polishing every winter  HARDCASTLE  Ay and bring back vanity and affectation to last them the whole year I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home In my time the follies of the town crept slowly among us but now they travel faster than a stagecoach Its fopperies come down not only as inside passengers but in the very basket  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Ay  your  times were fine times indeed you have been telling us of  them  for many a long year Here we live in an old rumbling mansion that looks for all the world like an inn but that we never see company Our best visitors are old Mrs Oddfish the curate's wife and little Cripplegate the lame dancingmaster And all our entertainment your old stories of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough I hate such oldfashioned trumpery  HARDCASTLE  And I love it I love every thing that's old old friends old times old manners old books old wine and I believe Dorothy  taking her hand  you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Lord Mr Hardcastle you're for ever at your Dorothy's and your old wife's You may be a Darby but I'll be no Joan I promise you I'm not so old as you'd make me by more than one good year Add twenty to twenty and make money of that  HARDCASTLE  Let me see twenty added to twenty makes just fifty and seven  Mrs HARDCASTLE  It's false Mr Hardcastle I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony that I had by Mr Lumpkin my first husband and he's not come to years of discretion yet  HARDCASTLE  Nor ever will I dare answer for him Ay you have taught  him  finely  Mrs HARDCASTLE  No matter Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune My son is not to live by his learning I don't think a boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year  HARDCASTLE  Learning quotha A mere composition of tricks and mischief  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Humour my dear nothing but humour Come Mr Hardcastle you must allow the boy a little humour  HARDCASTLE  I'd sooner allow him an horsepond If burning the footmens shoes frighting the maids and worrying the kittens be humour he has it It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair and when I went to make a bow I popt my bald head in Mrs Frizzle's face  Mrs HARDCASTLE  And am I to blame The poor boy was always too sickly to do any good A school would be his death When he comes to be a little stronger who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him  HARDCASTLE  Latin for him A cat and fiddle No no the alehouse and the stable are the only schools he'll ever go to  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well we must not snub the poor boy now for I believe we shan't have him long among us Any body that looks in his face may see he's consumptive  HARDCASTLE  Ay if growing too fat be one of the symptoms  Mrs HARDCASTLE  He coughs sometimes  HARDCASTLE  Yes when his liquor goes the wrong way  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I'm actually afraid of his lungs  HARDCASTLE  And truly so am I for he sometimes whoops like  a speaking trumpet  Tony hallooing behind the Scenes  O there he goesA very consumptive figure truly  Enter  TONY  crossing the Stage  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Tony where are you going my charmer Won't you give papa and I a little of your company lovee  TONY  I'm in haste mother I cannot stay  Mrs HARDCASTLE  You shan't venture out this raw evening my dear You look most shockingly  TONY  I can't stay I tell you The Three Pigeons expects me down every moment There's some fun going forward  HARDCASTLE  Ay the alehouse the old place I thought so  Mrs HARDCASTLE  A low paltry set of fellows  TONY  Not so low neither There's Dick Muggins the exciseman Jack Slang the horse doctor Little Aminadab that grinds the music box and Tom Twist that spins the pewter platter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Pray my dear disappoint them for one night at least  TONY  As for disappointing  them  I should not so much mind but I can't abide to disappoint  myself  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Detaining him  You shan't go  TONY  I will I tell you  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I say you shan't  TONY  We'll see which is strongest you or I  Exit hawling her out  HARDCASTLE  Solus  HARDCASTLE  Ay there goes a pair that only spoil each other But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out of doors There's my pretty darling Kate the fashions of the times have almost infected her too By living a year or two in town she is as fond of gauze and French frippery as the best of them  Enter  MISS HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Blessings on my pretty innocence Drest out as usual my Kate Goodness What a quantity of superfluous silk has thou got about thee girl I could never teach the fools of this age that the indigent world could be cloathed out of the trimmings of the vain  Miss HARDCASTLE  You know our agreement Sir You allow me the morning to receive and pay visits and to dress in my own manner and in the evening I put on my housewife's dress to please you  HARDCASTLE  Well remember I insist on the terms of our agreement and by the bye I believe I shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening  Miss HARDCASTLE  I protest Sir I don't comprehend your meaning  HARDCASTLE  Then to be plain with you Kate I expect the  young gentleman I have chosen to be your husband from town this very day I have his father's letter in which he informs me his son is set out and that he intends to follow himself shortly after  Miss HARDCASTLE  Indeed I wish I had known something of this before Bless me how shall I behave It's a thousand to one I shan't like him our meeting will be so formal and so like a thing of business that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem  HARDCASTLE  Depend upon it child I'll never controul your choice but Mr Marlow whom I have pitched upon is the son of my old friend Sir Charles Marlow of whom you have heard me talk so often The young gentleman has been bred a scholar and is designed for an employment in the service of his country I am told he's a man of an excellent understanding  Miss HARDCASTLE  Is he  HARDCASTLE  Very generous  Miss HARDCASTLE  I believe I shall like him  HARDCASTLE  Young and brave  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm sure I shall like him  HARDCASTLE  And very handsome  Miss HARDCASTLE  My dear Papa say no more  kissing his hand  he's mine I'll have him  HARDCASTLE  And to crown all Kate he's one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world  Miss HARDCASTLE  Eh you have frozen me to death again That word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments A reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband  HARDCASTLE  On the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues It was the very feature in his character that first struck me  Miss HARDCASTLE  He must have more striking features to catch me I promise you However if he be so young so handsome and so every thing as you mention I believe he'll do still I think I'll have him  HARDCASTLE  Ay Kate but there is still an obstacle Its more than an even wager he may not have  you  Miss HARDCASTLE  My dear Papa why will you mortify one soWell if he refuses instead of breaking my heart at his indifference I'll only break my glass for its flattery Set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer  HARDCASTLE  Bravely resolved In the mean time I'll go prepare the servants for his reception as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits the first day's muster  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sola  Miss HARDCASTLE  Lud this news of Papa's puts me all in a slutter Young handsome these he put last but I put them foremost Sensible goodnatured I like all that But then reserved and sheepish that's much against him Yet can't he be cured of his timidity by being taught to be proud of his wife Yes and can't IBut I vow I'm disposing of the husband before I have secured the lover  Enter  Miss NEVILLE  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm glad you're come Neville my dear Tell me Constance how do I look this evening Is there any thing whimsical about me Is it one of my well looking days child Am I in face to day  Miss NEVILLE  Perfectly my dear Yet now I look againbless mesure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes Has your brother or the cat been meddling Or has the last novel been too moving  Miss HARDCASTLE  No nothing of all this I have been threatenedI can scarce get it outI have been threatened with a lover  Miss NEVILLE  And his name  Miss HARDCASTLE  Is Marlow  Miss NEVILLE  Indeed  Miss HARDCASTLE  The son of Sir Charles Marlow  Miss NEVILLE  As I live the most intimate friend of Mr Hastings  my  admirer They are never asunder I believe you must have seen him when we lived in town  Miss HARDCASTLE  Never  Miss NEVILLE  He's a very singular character I assure you Among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me  Miss HARDCASTLE  An odd character indeed I shall never be able  to manage him What shall I do Pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success But how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony as usual  Miss NEVILLE  I have just come from one of our agreeable tête atêtes She has been saying a hundred tender things and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection  Miss HARDCASTLE  And her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so A fortune like your's is no small temptation Besides as she has the sole management of it I'm not surprized to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family  Miss NEVILLE  A fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation But at any rate if my dear Hastings be but constant I make no doubt to be too hard for her at last However I let her suppose that I am in love with her son and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another  Miss HARDCASTLE  My good brother holds out stoutly I could almost love him for hating you so  Miss NEVILLE  It is a good natured creature at bottom and I'm sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself But my aunt's bell rings for our afternoon's walk round the improvements Allons Courage is necessary as our affairs are critical  Miss HARDCASTLE  Would it were bed time and all were well  Exeunt  SCENE  An Alehouse Room Several shabby fellows with Punch and Tobacco  TONY  at the head of t  e Table a little higher than the rest A mallet in his hand  OMNES  Hurrea hurrea hurrea bravo  First FELLOW  Now gentlemen silence for a song The 'Squire is

grammar and nonsense and learning  Good liquor I stoutly maintain  Gives  genus  a better discerning  Let them brag of their Heathenish Gods  Their Lethes their Styxes and Stygians  Their Quis and their Quaes and their Quods  They're all but a parcel of Pigeons  Toroddle toroddle toroll  When Methodist preachers come down  A preaching that drinking is sinful  I'll wager the rascals a crown  They always preach best with a skinful  But when you come down with your pence  For a slice of their scurvy religion  I'll leave it to all men of sense  But you my good friend are the pigeon  Toroddle

spunk in him  Second FELLOW  I loves to hear him sing bekeays he never gives us nothing that's  low  Third FELLOW  O damn any thing that's  low  I cannot bear it  Fourth FELLOW  The genteel thing is the genteel thing at any time If so be that a gentleman bees in a concatenation accordingly  Third FELLOW  I like the maxum of it Master Muggins What tho' I am obligated to dance a bear a man may be a gentleman for all that May this be my poison if my bear ever dances but to the very genteelest of tunes Water Parted or the minuet in Ariadne  Second FELLOW  What a pity it is the 'Squire is not come to his own It would be well for all the publicans within ten miles round of him  TONY  Ecod and so it would Master Slang I'd then shew what it was to keep choice of company  Second FELLOW  O he takes after his own father for that To be sure old 'Squire Lumpkin was the finest gentleman I ever set my eyes on For winding the streight horn or beating a thicket for a hare or a wench he never had his fellow It was a saying in  the place that he kept the best horses dogs and girls in the whole county  TONY  Ecod and when I'm of age I'll be no bastard I promise you I have been thinking of Bett Bouncer and the miller's grey mare to begin with But come my boys drink about and be merry for you pay no reckoning Well Stingo what's the matter  Enter  LANDLORD  LANDLORD  There be two gentlemen in a postchaise at the door They have lost their way upo' the forest and they are talking something about Mr Hardcastle  TONY  As sure as can be one of them must be the gentleman that's coming down to court my sister Do they seem to be Londoners  LANDLORD  I believe they may They look woundily like Frenchmen  TONY  Then desire them to step this way and I'll set them right in a twinkling  Exit Landlord  Gentlemen as they mayn't be good enough company for you step down for a moment and I'll be with you in the squeezing of a lemon  Exeunt Mob  TONY  solus  TONY  Fatherinlaw has been calling

me out of  that  if he can  Enter  LANDLORD  conducting Marlow and Hastings  MARLOW  What a tedious uncomfortable day have we had of  it We were told it was but forty miles across the country and we have come above threescore  HASTINGS  And all Marlow from that unaccountable reserve of yours that would not let us enquire more frequently on the way  MARLOW  I own Hastings I am unwilling to lay myself under an obligation to every one I meet and often stand the chance of an unmannerly answer  HASTINGS  At present however we are not likely to receive any answer  TONY  No offence gentlemen But I'm told you have been enquiring for one Mr Hardcastle in those parts Do you know what part of the country you are in  HASTINGS  Not in the least Sir but should thank you for information  TONY  Nor the way you came  HASTINGS  No Sir but if you can inform us  TONY  Why gentlemen if you know neither the road you are going nor where you are nor the road you came the first thing I have to inform you is thatYou have lost your way  MARLOW  We wanted no ghost to tell us that  TONY  Pray gentlemen may I be so bold as to ask the place from whence you came  MARLOW  That's not necessary towards directing us where we are to go  TONY  No offence but question for question is all fair  you know Pray gentlemen is not this same Hardcastle a crossgrain'd oldfashion'd whimsical fellow with an ugly face a daughter and a pretty son  HASTINGS  We have not seen the gentleman but he has the family you mention  TONY  The daughter a tall trapesing trolloping talkative maypoleThe son a pretty wellbred agreeable youth that every body is fond of  MARLOW  Our information differs in this The daughter is said to be wellbred and beautiful the son an aukward booby reared up and spoiled at his mother's apronstring  TONY  HehehemThen gentlemen all I have to tell you is that you won't reach Mr Hardcastle's house this night I believe  HASTINGS  Unfortunate  TONY  It's a damn'd long dark boggy dirty dangerous way Stingo tell the gentlemen the way to Mr Hardcastle's  winking upon the Landlord  Mr Hardcastle's of Quagmire Marsh you understand me  LANDLORD  Master Hardcastle's Lockadaisy my masters you're come a deadly deal wrong When you came to the bottom of the hill you should have cross'd down Squashlane  MARLOW  Cross down Squashlane  LANDLORD  Then you were to keep streight forward 'till you came to four roads  MARLOW  Come to where four roads meet  TONY  Ay but you must be sure to take only one of them  MARLOW  O Sir you're facetious  TONY  Then keeping to the right you are to go sideways till you come upon Crackskull common there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel and go forward 'till you come to farmer Murrain's barn Coming to the farmer's barn you are to turn to the right and then to the left and then to the right about again till you find out the old mill  MARLOW  Zounds man we could as soon find out the longitude  HASTINGS  What's to be done Marlow  MARLOW  This house promises but a poor reception though perhaps the Landlord can accommodate us  LANDLORD  Alack master we have but one spare bed in the whole house  TONY  And to my knowledge that's taken up by three lodgers already  after a pause in which the rest seem disconcerted  I have hit it Don't you think Stingo our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen by the fireside withthree chairs and a bolster  HASTINGS  I hate sleeping by the fireside  MARLOW  And I detest your three chairs and a bolster  TONY  You do do youthen let me seewhatif you go on a mile further to the Buck's Head the old

Mum  LANDLORD  Ah bless your heart for a sweet pleasantdamn'd mischievous son of a whore  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  An oldfashioned  HOUSE  Enter  HARDCASTLE  followed by three or four aukward Servants  HARDCASTLE  WELL I hope you're perfect in the table exercise I have been teaching you these three days You all know your posts and your places and can shew that you have been used to good company without ever stirring from home  OMNES  Ay ay  HARDCASTLE  When company comes you are not to pop out and stare and then run in again like frighted rabbits in a warren  OMNES  No no  HARDCASTLE  You Diggory whom I have taken from the barn are to make a shew at the sidetable and you Roger whom I have advanced from the plough are to place yourself behind  my  chair But you're not to stand so with your hands in your pockets Take your hands from your pockets Roger and from your head you blockhead you See how Diggory carries his hands They're a little too stiff indeed but that's no great matter  DIGGORY  Ay mind how I hold them I learned to hold my hands this way when I was upon drill for the militia And so being upon drill  HARDCASTLE  You must not be so talkative Diggory You must be all attention to the guests You must hear us talk  and not think of talking you must see us drink and not think of drinking you must see us eat and not think of eating  DIGGORY  By the laws your worship that's parfectly unpossible Whenever Diggory sees yeating going forward ecod he's always wishing for a mouthful himself  HARDCASTLE  Blockhead Is not a bellyfull in the kitchen as good as a bellyfull in the parlour Stay your stomach with that reflection  DIGGORY  Ecod I thank your worship I'll make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry  HARDCASTLE  Diggory you are too talkative Then if I happen to say a good thing or tell a good story at table you must not all burst out alaughing as if you made part of the company  DIGGORY  Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of Ould Grouse in the gunroom I can't help laughing at thathe he hefor the soul of me We have laughed at that these twenty yearsha ha ha  HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha The story is a good one Well honest Diggory you may laugh at thatbut still remember to be attentive Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine how will you behave A glass of wine Sir if you please  to Diggory  Eh why don't you move  DIGGORY  Ecod your worship I never have courage till I see the eatables and drinkables brought upo' the table and then I'm as bauld as a lion  HARDCASTLE  What will no body move  FIRST SERVANT  I'm not to leave this pleace  SECOND SERVANT  I'm sure it's no pleace of mine  THIRD SERVANT  Nor mine for sartain  DIGGORY  Wauns and I'm sure it canna be mine  HARDCASTLE  You numbskulls and so while like your betters you are quarrelling for places the guests must be starved O you dunces I find I must begin all over againBut don't I hear a coach drive into the yard To your posts you blockheads I'll go in the mean time and give my old friend's son a hearty reception at the gate  Exit  Hardcastle  DIGGORY  By the elevens my pleace is gone quite out of my head  ROGER  I know that my pleace is to be every where  FIRST SERVANT  Where the devil is mine  SECOND SERVANT  My pleace is to be no where at all and so Ize go about my business  Exeunt Servants running about as if frighted different ways  Enter  SERVANT  with Candles shewing in  MARLOW  and  HASTINGS  SERVANT  Welcome gentlemen very welcome This way  HASTINGS  After the disappointments of the day welcome once more Charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire Upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable  MARLOW  The usual fate of a large mansion Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn  HASTINGS  As you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries I have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece tho' not actually put in the bill enflame a reckoning confoundedly  MARLOW  Travellers George must pay in all places The only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved  HASTINGS  You have lived pretty much among them In truth I have been often surprized that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance  MARLOW  The Englishman's malady But tell me George where could I have learned that assurance you talk of My life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence I don't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest womanexcept my motherBut among females of another class you know  HASTINGS  Ay among them you are impudent enough of all conscience  MARLOW  They are of  us  you know  HASTINGS  But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such an ideot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room  MARLOW  Why man that's because I  do  want to steal out of the room Faith I have often formed  a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate But I don't know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence  HASTINGS  If you could but say half the fine things to them that I have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bed maker  MARLOW  Why George I can't say fine things to them They freeze they petrify me They may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle But to me a modest woman drest out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation  HASTINGS  Ha ha ha At this rate man how can you ever expect to marry  MARLOW  Never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy If indeed like an Eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured But to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of  madam will you marry me  No no that's strain much above me I assure you  HASTINGS  I pity you But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father  MARLOW  As I behave to all other ladies Bow very low Answer yes or no to all her demandsBut for  the rest I don't think I shall venture to look in her face till I see my father's again  HASTINGS  I'm surprized that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover  MARLOW  To be explicit my dear Hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own Miss Neville loves you the family don't know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honour do the rest  HASTINGS  My dear Marlow But I'll suppress the emotion Were I a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance But Miss Neville's person is all I ask and that is mine both from her deceased father's consent and her own inclination  MARLOW  Happy man You have talents and art to captivate any woman I'm doom'd to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it I despise This stammer in my address and this aukward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's 'prentice or one of the dutchesses of Drurylane Pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us  Enter  HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome Which is Mr Marlow Sir you're heartily welcome It's not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire I like to give them a hearty reception in the old stile at my gate I like to see their horses and trunks taken care of  MARLOW  aside  He has got our names from the servants already  To Him  We approve your caution and hospitality Sir  To Hastings  I have been thinking George of changing our travelling dresses in the morning I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine  HARDCASTLE  I beg Mr Marlow you'll use no ceremony in this house  HASTINGS  I fancy George you're right the first blow is half the battle I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold  Mr HARDCASTLE  Mr MarlowMr Hastingsgentlemenpray be under no constraint in this house This is Libertyhall gentlemen You may do just as you please here  MARLOW  Yet George if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it is over I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat  HARDCASTLE  Your talking of a retreat Mr Marlow puts me in mind of the Duke of Marlborough when we went to besiege Denain He first summoned the garrison  MARLOW  Don't you think the  ventre dor  waistcoat will do with the plain brown  HARDCASTLE  He first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men  HASTINGS  I think not Brown and yellow mix but very poorly  HARDCASTLE  I say gentlemen as I was telling you he summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men  MARLOW  The girls like finery  HARDCASTLE  Which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war Now says the Duke of Marlborough to George Brooks that stood next to himYou must have heard of George Brooks I'll pawn my Dukedom says he but I take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood So  MARLOW  What my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour  HARDCASTLE  Punch Sir  aside  This is the most unaccountable kind of modesty I ever met with  MARLOW  Yes Sir Punch A glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable This is LibertyHall you know  HARDCASTLE  Here's Cup Sir  MARLOW  Aside  So this fellow in his Libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases  HARDCASTLE  Taking the Cup  I hope you'll find it to your mind I have prepared it with my own hands and I believe you'll own the ingredients are tolerable Will you be so good as to pledge me Sir Here Mr Marlow here is to our better acquaintance  drinks  MARLOW  Aside  A very impudent fellow this but he's a character and I'll humour him a little Sir my service to you  drinks  HASTINGS  Aside  I see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that he's an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman  MARLOW  From the excellence of your cup my old friend I suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country Warm work now and then at elections I suppose  HARDCASTLE  No Sir I have long given that work over Since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there's no business  for us that sell ale  HASTINGS  So then you have no turn for politics I find  HARDCASTLE  Not in the least There was a time indeed I fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better I left it to mend itself Since that I no more trouble my head about  Heyder Ally  or  Ally Cawn  than about  Ally Croaker  Sir my service to you  HASTINGS  So that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it  HARDCASTLE  I do stir about a great deal that's certain Half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour  MARLOW  After drinking  And you have an argument in your cup old gentleman better than any in Westminsterhall  HARDCASTE  Ay young gentleman that and a little philosophy  MARLOW  Aside  Well this is the first time I ever heard of an innkeeper's philosophy  HASTINGS  So then like an experienced general you attack them on every quarter If you find their reason manageable you attack it with your philosophy if you find they have no reason you attack them with this Here's your health my philosopher  drinks  HARDCASTLE  Good very good thank you ha ha Your Generalship puts me in mind of Prince Eugene when he fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade You shall hear  MARLOW  Instead of the battle of Belgrade I believe it's almost time to talk about supper What has your philosophy got in the house for fupper  HARDCASTLE  For Supper Sir  aside  Was ever such a request to a man in his own house  MARLOW  Yes Sir supper Sir I begin to feel an appetite I shall make devilish work tonight in the larder I promise you  HARDCASTLE  Aside  Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld  to him  Why really Sir as for supper I can't well tell My Dorothy and the cook maid settle these things between them I leave these kind of things entirely to them  MARLOW  You do do you  HARDCASTLE  Entirely Bythebye I believe they are in actual consultation upon what's for supper this moment in the kitchen  MARLOW  Then I beg they'll admit  me  as one of their privy  council It's a way I have got When I travel I always chuse to regulate my own supper Let the cook be called No offence I hope Sir  HARDCASTLE  O no Sir none in the least yet I don't know how our Bridget the cook maid is not very communicative upon these occasions Should we send for her she might scold us all out of the house  HASTINGS  Let's see your list of the larder then I ask it as a favour I always match my appetite to my bill of fare  MARLOW  To Hardcastle who looks at them with surprize  Sir he's very right and it's my way too  HARDCASTLE  Sir you have a right to command here Here Roger bring us the bill of fare for to night's supper I believe it's drawn out Your manner Mr Hastings puts me in mind of my uncle Colonel Wallop It was a saying of his that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it  HASTINGS  Aside  All upon the high ropes His uncle a Colonel We shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of peace But let's hear the bill of fare  MARLOW  Perusing  What's here For the first course for the second course for the desert The devil Sir do you think we have brought down the whole Joiners Company or the Corporation of Bedford to eat up such a supper Two or three little things clean and comfortable will do  HASTINGS  But let's hear it  MARLOW  Reading  For the first course at the top a pig and pruin sauce  HASTINGS  Damn your pig I say  MARLOW  And damn your pruin sauce say I  HARDCASTLE  And yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with pruin sauce is very good eating  MARLOW  At the bottom a calve's tongue and brains  HASTINGS  Let your brains be knock'd out my good Sir I don't like them  MARLOW  Or you may clap them on a plate by themselves I do  HARDCASTLE  Aside  Their impudence confounds me  to them  Gentlemen you are my guests make what alterations you please Is there any thing else you wish to retrench or alter gentlemen  MARLOW  Item A pork pie a boiled rabbet and saufages a florentine a shaking pudding and a dish of tifftafftaffety cream  HASTINGS  Confound your made dishes I shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner at the French ambassador's table I'm for plain eating  HARDCASTLE  I'm sorry gentlemen that I have nothing you like but if there be any thing you have a particular fancy to  MARLOW  Why really Sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another Send us what you please So much for supper And now to see that our beds are air'd and properly taken care of  HARDCASTLE  I entreat you'll leave all that to me You shall not stir a step  MARLOW  Leave that to you I protest Sir you must excuse me I always look to these things myself  HARDCASTLE  I must insist Sir you'll make yourself easy on that head  MARLOW  You see I'm resolved on it  aside  A very troublesome fellow this as ever I met with  HARDCASTLE  Well Sir I'm resolved at least to attend you  aside  This may be modern modesty but I never saw any thing look so like oldfashioned impudence  Exeunt  Marlow and Hardcastle  HASTINGS solus  HASTINGS  So I find this fellow's civilities begin to grow troublesome But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him Ha what do I see Miss Neville by all that's happy  Enter Miss NEVILLE  Miss NEVILLE  My dear Hastings To what unexpected good fortune to what accident am I to ascribe this happy meeting  HASTINGS  Rather let me ask the same question as I could never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn  Miss NEVILLE  An inn sure you mistake my aunt my guardian lives here What could induce you to think this house an inn  HASTINGS  My friend Mr Marlow with whom I came down and I have been sent here as to an inn I assure you A young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither  Miss NEVILLE  Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha ha  HASTINGS  He whom your aunt intends for you He of whom I have such just apprehensions  Miss NEVILLE  You have nothing to fear from him I assure you You'd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me My aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest  HASTINGS  Thou dear dissembler You must know my Constance I have just seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the family The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but they'll soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings we shall soon be landed in France where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected  Miss NEVILLE  I have often told you that though ready to obey you I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the India Director and chiefly consists in jewels I have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them I fancy I'm very near succeeding The instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours  HASTINGS  Perish the baubles Your person is all I desire In the meantime my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake I know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution  Miss NEVILLE  But how shall we keep him in the deception Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive himThis this way  They confer  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  The assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back They talk of coming to sup with us too and then I suppose we are to run the gauntlet thro' all the rest of the familyWhat have we got here  HASTINGS  My dear Charles Let me congratulate youThe most fortunate accidentWho do you think is just alighted  MARLOW  Cannot guess  HASTINGS  Our mistresses boy Miss Hardcastle and Miss Neville Give me leave to introduce Miss Constance Neville to your acquaintance Happening to dine in the neighbourhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here Miss Hardcastle has just stept into the next room and will be back in an instant Wasn't it lucky eh  MARLOW  Aside  I have just been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment  HASTINGS  Well but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world  MARLOW  Oh yes Very fortunatea most joyful encounterBut our dresses George you know  are in disorderWhat if we should postpone the happiness 'till tomorrowTomorrow at her own houseIt will be every bit as convenientAnd rather more respectfulTomorrow let it be  offering to go  Miss NEVILLE  By no means Sir Your ceremony will displease her The disorder of your dress will shew the ardour of your impatience Besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her  MARLOW  O the devil how shall I support it Hem hem Hastings you must not go You are to assist me you know I shall be confoundedly ridiculous Yet hang it I'll take courage Hem  HASTINGS  Pshaw man it's but the first plunge and all's over She's but a woman you know  MARLOW  And of all women she that I dread most to encounter  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE as returned from walking a Bonnet c  HASTINGS  introducing them  Miss Hardcastle Mr Marlow I'm proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other  Miss HARDCASTLE  aside  Now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner  After a pause in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted  I'm glad of your safe arrival SirI'm told you had some accidents by the way  MARLOW  Only a few madam Yes we had some Yes Madam a good many accidents but should be sorryMadamor rather glad of any accidentsthat are so agreeably concluded Hem  HASTINGS  To him  You never spoke better in your whole life Keep it up and I'll insure you the victory  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm afraid you flatter Sir You that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country  MARLOW  Gathering courage  I have lived indeed in the world Madam but I have kept very little company I have been but an observer upon life Madam while others were enjoying it  Miss NEVILLE  But that I am told is the way to enjoy it at last  HASTINGS  To him  Cicero never spoke better Once more and you are confirm'd in assurance for ever  MARLOW  To him  Hem Stand by me then and when I'm down throw in a word or two to set me up again  Miss HARDCASTLE  An observer like you upon life were I fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve  MARLOW  Pardon me Madam I was always willing to be amused The folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness  HASTINGS  To him  Bravo Bravo Never spoke so well in your whole life Well Miss Hardcastle I see that you and Mr Marlow are going to be very good company I believe our being here will but embarrass the interview  MARLOW  Not in the least Mr Hastings We like your company of all things  To him  Zounds George sure you won't go How can you leave us  HASTINGS  Our presence will but spoil conversation so we'll retire to the next room  To him  You don't consider man that we are to manage a little têteàtête of our own  Exeunt  Miss HARDCASTLE  After a pause  But you have not been wholly an observer I presume Sir The ladies I should hope have employed some part of your addresses  MARLOW  Relapsing into timidity  Pardon me Madam IIIas yet have studiedonlytodeserve them  Miss HARDCASTLE  And that some say is the very worst way to obtain them  MARLOW  Perhaps so madam But I love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sexBut I'm afraid I grow tiresome  Miss HARDCASTLE  Not at all Sir there is nothing I like so much as grave conversation myself I could hear it for ever Indeed I have often been surprized how a  man of  sentiment  could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart  MARLOW  It'sa diseaseof the mind madam In the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relishforumaum  Miss HARDCASTLE  I understand you Sir There must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting  MARLOW  My meaning madam but infinitely better expressed And I can't help observinga  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aside  Who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon some occasions  To him  You were going to observe Sir  MARLOW  I was observing madamI protest madam I forget what I was going to observe  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aside  I vow and so do I  To him  You were observing Sir that in this age of hypocrisy something about hypocrisy Sir  MARLOW  Yes madam In this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict enquiry do notaaa  Miss HARDCASTLE  I understand you perfectly Sir  MARLOW  Aside  Egad and that's more than I do myself  Miss HARDCASTLE  You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise  in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it  MARLOW  True madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms But I'm sure I tire you madam  Miss HARDCASTLE  Not in the least Sir there's something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and forcepray Sir go on  MARLOW  Yes madam I was sayingthat there are some occasionswhen a total want of courage madam destroys all theand puts usupon aaa  Miss HARDCASTLE  I agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance and betrays us when we most want to excel I beg you'll proceed  MARLOW  Yes madam Morally speaking madamBut I see Miss Neville expecting us in the next room I would not intrude for the world  Miss HARDCASTLE  I protest Sir I never was more agreeably entertained in all my life Pray go on  MARLOW  Yes madam I wasBut she beckons us to join her Madam shall I do myself the honour to attend you  Miss HARDCASTLE  Well then I'll follow  MARLOW  aside  This pretty smooth dialogue has done for me  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE sola  Miss HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha Was there ever such a sober sentimental interview I'm certain he scarce look'd in my face the whole time Yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too He has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance If I could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that I know of a piece of service But who is that somebodythat faith is a question I can scarce answer  Exit  Enter TONY and Miss NEVILLE followed by Mrs HARDCASTLE and HASTINGS  TONY  What do you follow me for cousin Con I wonder you're not ashamed to be so very engaging  Miss NEVILLE  I hope cousin one may speak to one's own relations and not be to blame  TONY  Ay but I know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it won't do I tell you cousin Con it won't do so I beg you'll keep your distance I want no nearer relationship  She follows coqueting him to the back scene  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well I vow Mr Hastings you are very entertaining There's nothing in the world I love to talk of so much as London and the fashions though I was never there myself  HASTINGS  Never there You amaze me From your air and manner I concluded you had been bred all your life either at Ranelagh St James's or Tower Wharf  Mrs HARDCASTLE  O Sir you're only pleased to say so We Country persons can have no manner at all I'm in love with the town and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the Pantheon the Grotto Gardens the Borough and such places where the Nobility chiefly resort All I can do is to enjoy London at secondhand I take care to know every têteàtête from the Scandalous Magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two Miss Rickets of Crookedlane Pray how do you like this head Mr Hastings  HASTINGS  Extremely elegant and degagée upon my word Madam Your Friseur is a Frenchman I suppose  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I protest I dressed it myself from a print in the Ladies Memorandumbook for the last year  HASTINGS  Indeed Such a head in a sidebox at the Playhouse would draw as many gazers as my Lady May'ress at a City Ball  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd  HASTINGS  But that can never be your case Madam in any dress  bowing  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Yet what signifies  my  dressing when I have such a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr Hardcastle all I can say will never argue down a single button from his cloaths I have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaister it over like my Lord Pately with powder  HASTINGS  You are right Madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old  Mrs HARDCASTLE  But what do you think his answer was Why with his usual Gothic vivacity he said I only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tête for my own wearing  HASTINGS  Intolerable At your age you may wear what you please and it must become you  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Pray Mr Hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town  HASTINGS  Some time ago forty was all the mode but I'm told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Seriously Then I shall be too young for the fashion  HASTINGS  No lady begins now to put on jewels 'till she's past forty For instance Miss there in a polite circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers  Mrs HARDCASTLE  And yet Mrs Niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all  HASTINGS  Your niece is she And that young gentleman a brother of yours I should presume  Mrs HARDCASTLE  My son Sir They are contracted to each other Observe their little sports They fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already  To them  Well Tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin Constance this evening  TONY  I have been saying no soft things but that it's very hard to be followed about so Ecod I've not a place in the house now that's left to myself but the stable  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Never mind him Con my dear He's in another story behind your back  Miss NEVILLE  There's something generous in my cousin's manner He falls out before faces to be forgiven in private  TONY  That's a damned confoundedcrack  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Ah he's a sly one Don't you think they're like each other about the mouth Mr Hastings The Blenkinsop mouth to a T They're of a size too Back to back my pretties that Mr Hastings may see you Come Tony  TONY  You had as good not make me I tell you  measuring  Miss NEVILLE  O lud he has almost cracked my head  Mrs

I'm to get for the pains I have taken in your education I that have rock'd you in your cradle and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel Did not I prescribe for you every day and weep while the receipt was operating  TONY  Ecod you had reason to weep for you have been dosing me ever since I was born I have gone through every receipt in the complete huswife ten times over and you have thoughts of coursing me through  Quincy  next spring But Ecod I tell you I'll not be made a fool of no longer  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Wasn't it all for your good viper Wasn't it all for your good  TONY  I wish you'd let me and my good alone then Snubbing this way when I'm in spirits If I'm to have any good let it come of itself not to keep dinging it dinging it into one so  Mrs HARDCASTLE  That's false I never see you when you're in spirits No Tony you then go to the alehouse or kennel I'm never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster  TONY  Ecod Mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Was ever the like But I see he wants to break my heart I see he does  HASTINGS  Dear Madam permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little I'm certain I can persuade him to his duty  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well I must retire Come Constance my love You see Mr Hastings the wretchedness of my situation Was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy  Exeunt  Mrs Hardcastle and Miss Neville  HASTINGS TONY  TONY  singing  There was a young man riding by and fain would have his will Rang do didlo dee  Don't mind her  Let her cry It's the comfort of her heart I have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry  HASTINGS  Then you're no friend to the ladies I find my pretty young gentleman  TONY  That's as I find 'um  HASTINGS  Not to her of your mother's chusing I dare answer And yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl  TONY  That's because you don't know her as well as I Ecod I know every inch about her and there's not a more bitter cantanckerous toad in all Christendom  HASTINGS  Aside  Pretty encouragement this for a lover  TONY  I have seen her since the height of that She has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first day's breaking  HASTINGS  To me she appears sensible and silent  TONY  Ay before company But when she's with her playmates she's as loud as a hog in a gate  HASTINGS  But there is a meek modesty about her that charms me  TONY  Yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and you're flung in a ditch  HASTINGS  Well but you must allow her a little beautyYes you must allow her some beauty  TONY  Bandbox She's all a made up thing mun Ah could you but see Bet Bouncer of these parts you might then talk of beauty Ecod she has two eyes as black as sloes and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion She'd make two of she  HASTINGS  Well what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands  TONY  Anon  HASTINGS  Would you thank him that would take Miss Neville and leave you to happiness and your dear Betsy  TONY  Ay but where is there such a friend for who would take  her  HASTINGS  I am he If you but assist me I'll engage to whip her off to France and you shall never hear more of her  TONY  Assist you Ecod I will to the last drop of my blood I'll clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling and may be get you a part of her fortin beside in jewels that you little dream of  HASTINGS  My dear squire this looks like a lad of spirit  TONY  Come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me  singing  We are the boys that fears no noise where the thundering cannons roar  Exeunt  END OF SECOND ACT  ACT III  Enter HARDCASTLE solus  HARDCASTLE  WHAT could my old friend Sir Charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town To me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fireside already He took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of I'm desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughterShe will certainly be shocked at it  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE plainly dress'd  HARDCASTLE  Well my Kate I see you have changed your dress as I bid you and yet I believe there was no great occasion  Miss HARDCASTLE  I find such a pleasure Sir in obeying your commands that I take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety  HARDCASTLE  And yet Kate I sometimes give you some cause particularly when I recommended my  modest  gentleman to you as a lover today  Miss HARDCASTLE  You taught me to expect something extraordinary and I find the original exceeds the description  HARDCASTLE  I was never so surprized in my life He has quite confounded all my faculties  Miss HARDCASTLE  I never saw any thing like it And a man of the world too  HARDCASTLE  Ay he learned it all abroadwhat a fool was I to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling He might as soon learn wit at a masquerade  Miss HARDCASTLE  It seems all natural to him  HARDCASTLE  A good deal assisted by bad company and a French dancingmaster  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sure you mistake papa a French dancingmaster could never have taught him that timid lookthat aukward addressthat bashful manner  HARDCASTLE  Whose look whose manner child  Miss HARDCASTLE  Mr Marlow's his meanvaise Loute his timidity struck me at the first sight  HARDCASTLE  Then your first sight deceived you for I think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sure Sir you rally I never saw any one so modest  HARDCASTLE  And can you be serious I never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since I was born Bully Dawson was but a fool to him  Miss HARDCASTLE  Surprizing He met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground  HARDCASTLE  He met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again  Miss HARDCASTLE  He treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and madam I would not for the world detain you  HARDCASTLE  He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before Asked twenty questions and never waited for an answer Interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun and when I was in my best story of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch Yes Kate he ask'd your father if he was a maker of punch  Miss HARDCASTLE  One of us must certainly be mistaken  HARDCASTLE  If he be what he has shewn himself I'm determined he shall never have my consent  Miss HARDCASTLE  And if he be the sullen thing I take him he shall never have mine  HARDCASTLE  In one thing then we are agreedto reject him  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes But upon conditions For if you should find him less impudent and I more presuming if you find him more respectful and I more importunateI don't knowthe fellow is well enough for a manCertainly we don't meet many such at a horse race in the country  HARDCASTLE  If we should find him soBut that's impossible The first appearance has done my business I'm seldom deceived in that  Miss HARDCASTLE  And yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance  HARDCASTLE  Ay when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture With her a smooth face stands for good sense and a genteel figure for every virtue  Miss HARDCASTLE  I hope Sir a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense won't end with a sneer at my understanding  HARDCASTLE  Pardon me Kate But if young Mr Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions he may please us both perhaps  Miss HARDCASTLE  And as one of us must be mistaken what if we go to make further discoveries  HARDCASTLE  Agreed But depend on't I'm in the right  Miss HARDCASTLE  And depend on't I'm not much in the wrong  Exeunt  Enter TONY running in with a Casket  TONY  Ecod I have got them Here they are My Cousin Con's necklaces bobs and all My mother shan't cheat the poor souls out of their fortune neither O my genus is that you  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  My dear friend how have you managed wit your mother I hope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin and that you are willing to be reconciled at last Our horses will be refreshed in a short time and we shall soon be ready to set off  TONY  And here's something to bear your charges by the way  giving the casket  Your sweetheart's jewels Keep them and hang those I say that would rob you of one of them  HASTINGS  But how have you procured them from your mother  TONY  Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no fibs I procured them by the rule of thumb If I had not a key to every drawer in mother's bureau how could I go to the alehouse so often as I do An honest man may rob himself of his own at any time  HASTINGS  Thousands do it every day But to be plain with you Miss Neville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very instant If she succeeds it will be the most delicate way at least of obtaining them  TONY  Well keep them till you know how it will be But I know how it will be well enough she'd as soon part with the only sound tooth in her head  HASTINGS  But I dread the effects of her resentment when she finds she has lost them  TONY  Never you mind her resentment leave  me  to manage that I don't value her resentment the bounce of a cracker Zounds here they are Morrice Prance  Exit  Hastings  TONY Mrs HARDCASTLE Miss NEVILLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Indeed Constance you amaze me Such a girl as you want jewels It will be time enough for jewels my dear twenty years hence when your beauty begins to want repairs  Miss NEVILLE  But what will repair beauty at forty will certainly improve it at twenty Madam  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Yours my dear can admit of none That natural blush is beyond a thousand ornaments Besides child jewels are quite out at present Don't you see half the ladies of our acquaintance my lady Kill day light and Mrs Crump and the rest of them  carry their jewels to town and bring nothing but Paste and Marcasites back  Miss NEVILLE  But who knows Madam but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Consult your glass my dear and then see if with such a pair of eyes you want any better sparklers What do you think Tony my dear does your cousin Con want any jewels in your eyes to set off her beauty  TONY  That's as thereafter may be  Miss NEVILLE  My dear aunt if you knew how it would oblige me  Mrs HARDCASTLE  A parcel of oldfashioned rose and tablecut things They would make you look like the court of king Solomon at a puppetshew Besides I believe I can't readily come at them They may be missing for aught I know to the contrary  TONY  Apart to Mrs Hardcastle  Then why don't you tell her so at once as she's so longing for them Tell her they're lost It's the only way to quiet her Say they're lost and call me to bear witness  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Apart to Tony  You know my dear I'm only keeping them for you So if I say they're gone you'll bear me witness will you He he he  TONY  Never fear me Ecod I'll say I saw them taken out with my own eyes  Miss NEVILLE  I desire them but for a day Madam Just to be permitted to shew them as relicks and then they may be lock'd up again  Mrs HARDCASTLE  To be plain with you my dear Constance if I could find them you should have them They're missing I assure you Lost for aught I know but we must have patience wherever they are  Miss NEVILLE  I'll not believe it this is but a shallow pretence to deny me I know they're too valuable to be so slightly kept and as you are to answer for the loss  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Don't be alarm'd Constance If they be lost I must restore an equivalent But my son knows they are missing and not to be found  TONY  That I can bear witness to They are missing and not to be found I'll take my oath on't  Mrs HARDCASTLE  You must learn resignation my dear for tho' we lose our fortune yet we should not lose our patience See me how calm I am  Miss NEVILLE  Ay people are generally calm at the misfortunes of others  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Now I wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a thought upon such trumpery We shall soon find them and in the mean time you shall make use of my garnets till your jewels be found  Miss NEVILLE  I detest garnets  Mrs HARDCASTLE  The most becoming things in the world to set off a clear complexion You have often seen how well they look upon me You  shall  have them  Exit  Miss NEVILLE  I dislike them of all things You shan't stirWas ever any thing so provoking to mislay my own jewels and force me to wear her trumpery  TONY  Don't be a fool If she gives you the garnets take what you can get The jewels are your own already I have stolen them out of her bureau and she does not know it Fly to your spark he'll tell you more of the matter Leave me to manage  her  Miss NEVILLE  My dear cousin  TONY  Vanish She's here and has missed them already Zounds how she fidgets and spits about like a Catharine wheel  Enter Mrs HARDCASTLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Confusion thieves robbers We are cheated plundered broke open undone  TONY  What's the matter

taken away  TONY  Stick to that ha ha ha stick to that I'll bear witness you know call me to bear witness  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I tell you Tony by all that's precious the jewels are gone and I shall be ruin'd for ever  TONY  Sure I know they're gone and I am to say so  Mrs HARDCASTLE  My dearest Tony but hear me They're gone I say  TONY  By the laws mamma you make me for to laugh ha ha I know who took them well enough ha ha ha  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Was there ever such a blockhead that can't tell the difference between jest and earnest I tell you I'm not in jest booby  TONY  That's right that's right You must be in a bitter passion and then nobody will suspect either of us I'll bear witness that they are gone  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Was there ever such a crossgrain'd brute that won't hear me Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool Was ever poor woman so beset with fools on one hand and thieves on the other  TONY  I can bear witness to that  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Bear witness again you blockhead you and I'll turn you out of the room directly My poor niece what will become of  her  Do you laugh you unfeeling brute as if you enjoy'd my distress  TONY  I can bear witness to that  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Do you insult me monster I'll teach you to vex your mother I will  TONY  I can bear witness to that  He runs off she follows him  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE and Maid  Miss HARDCASTLE  What an unaccountable creature is that brother of mine to send them to the house as an inn ha ha I don't wonder at his impudence  MAID  But what is more madam the young gentleman as you passed by in your present dress ask'd me if you were the bar maid He mistook you for the bar maid madam  Miss HARDCASTLE  Did he Then as I live I'm resolved to keep up the delusion Tell me Pimple how do you like my present dress Don't you think I look something like Cherry in the Beaux Stratagem  MAID  It's the dress madam that every lady wears in the country but when she visits or receives company  Miss HARDCASTLE  And are you sure he does not remember my face or person  MAID  Certain of it  Miss HARDCASTLE  I vow I thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview Indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me  MAID  But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake  Miss HARDCASTLE  In the first place I shall be  seen  and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market Then I shall perhaps make an acquaintance and that's no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex But my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giant's force before I offer to combat  MAID  But are you sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person  Miss HARDCASTLE  Never fear me I think I have got the true bar cantDid your honour callAttend the Lion therePipes and tobacco for the AngelThe Lamb has been outrageous this half hour  MAID  It will do madam But he's here  Exit  Maid  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  What a bawling in every part of the house I have scarce a moment's repose If I go to the best  room there I find my host and his story If I fly to the gallery there we have my hostess with her curtesy down to the ground I have at last got a moment to myself and now for recollection  Walks and muses  Miss HARDCASTLE  Did you call Sir did your honour call  MARLOW  Musing  As for Miss Hardcastle she's too grave and sentimental for me  Miss HARDCASTLE  Did your honour call  She still places herself before him he turning away  MARLOW  No child  musing  Besides from the glimpse I had of her I think she squints  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm sure Sir I heard the bell ring  MARLOW  No No  musing  I have pleased my father however by coming down and I'll tomorrow please myself by returning  Taking out his tablets and perusing  Miss HARDCASTLE  Perhaps the other gentleman called Sir  MARLOW  I tell you no  Miss HARDCASTLE  I should be glad to know Sir We have such a parcel of servants  MARLOW  No no I tell you  Looks full in her face  Yes child I think I did call I wantedI wantedI vow child you are vastly handsome  Miss HARDCASTLE  O la Sir you'll make one asham'd  MARLOW  Never saw a more sprightly malicious eye Yes yes my dear I did call Have you got any of yourawhat d'ye call it in the house  Miss HARDCASTLE  No Sir we have been out of that these ten days  MARLOW  One may call in this house I find to very little purpose Suppose I should call for a taste just by way of trial of the nectar of your lips perhaps I might be disappointed in that too  Miss HARDCASTLE  Nectar nectar that's liquor there's no call for in these parts French I suppose We keep no French wines here Sir  MARLOW  Of true English growth I assure you  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then it's odd I should not know it We brew all sorts of wines in this house and I have lived here these eighteen years  MARLOW  Eighteen years Why one would think child you kept the bar before you were born How old are you  Miss HARDCASTLE  O Sir I must not tell my age They say women and music should never be dated  MARLOW  To guess at this distance you can't be much above forty  approaching  Yet nearer I don't think so much  approaching  By coming close to some women they look younger still but when we come very close indeed  attempting to kiss her  Miss HARDCASTLE  Pray Sir keep your distance One would think you wanted to know one's age as they do horses by mark of mouth  MARLOW  I protest child you use me extremely ill If you keep me at this distance how is it possible you and I can be ever acquainted  Miss HARDCASTLE  And who wants to be acquainted with you I want no such acquaintance not I I'm sure you did not treat Miss Hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner I'll warrant me before her you look'd dash'd and kept bowing to the ground and talk'd for all the world as if you was before a justice of peace  MARLOW  Aside  Egad she has hit it sure enough  To her  In awe of her child Ha ha ha A mere aukward squinting thing no no I find you don't know me I laugh'd and rallied her a little but I was unwilling to be too severe No I could not be too severe  curse me  Miss HARDCASTLE  O then Sir you are a favourite I find among the ladies  MARLOW  Yes my dear a great favourite And yet hang me I don't see what they find in me to follow At the Ladies Club in town I'm called their agreeable Rattle Rattle child is not my real name but one I'm known by My name is Solomons Mr Solomons my dear at your service  Offering to salute her  Miss HARDCASTLE  Hold Sir you were introducing me to your club not to yourself And you're so great a favourite there you say  MARLOW  Yes my dear There's Mrs Mantrap Lady Betty Blackleg the Countess of Sligo Mrs Langhorns old Miss Biddy Buckskin and your humble servant keep up the spirit of the place  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then it's a very merry place I suppose  MARLOW  Yes as merry as cards suppers wine and old women can make us  Miss HARDCASTLE  And their agreeable Rattle ha ha ha  MARLOW  Aside  Egad I don't quite like this chit She looks knowing methinks You laugh child  Miss HARDCASTLE  I can't but laugh to think what time they all have for minding their work or their family  MARLOW  Aside  All's well she don't laugh at me  To her  Do  you  ever work child  Miss HARDCASTLE  Ay sure There's not a screen or a quilt in the whole house but what can bear witness to that  MARLOW  Odso Then you must shew me your embroidery I embroider and draw patterns myself a little If you want a judge of your work you must apply to me  Seizing her hand  Miss HARDCASTLE  Ay but the colours don't look well by candle light You shall see all in the morning  Struggling  MARLOW  And why not now my angel Such beauty fires beyond the power of resistancePshaw the father here My old luck I never nick'd seven that I did not throw ames ace three times following  Exit  Marlow  Enter HARDCASTLE who stands in surprize  HARDCASTLE  So madam So I find  this  is your  modest  lover This is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground and only ador'd at humble distance Kate Kate art thou not asham'd to deceive your father so  Miss HARDCASTLE  Never trust me dear papa but he's still the modest man I first took him for you'll be convinced of it as well as I  HARDCASTLE  By the hand of my body I believe his impudence is infectious Didn't I see him seize your hand Didn't I see him hawl you about like a milk maid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth  Miss HARDCASTLE  But if I shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age I hope you'll forgive him  HARDCASTLE  The girl would actually make one run mad I tell you I'll not be convinced I am convinced He has scarcely been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives You may like his impudence and call it modesty  But my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sir I ask but this night to convince you  HARDCASTLE  You shall not have half the time for I have thoughts of turning him out this very hour  Miss HARDCASTLE  Give me that hour then and I hope to satisfy you  HARDCASTLE  Well an hour let it be then But I'll have no trifling with your father All fair and open do you mind me  Miss HARDCASTLE  I hope Sir you have ever found that I considered your commands as my pride for your kindness is such that my duty as yet has been inclination  Exeunt  END OF THIRD ACT  ACT IV  Enter HASTINGS and Miss NEVILLE  HASTINGS  YOU surprise me Sir Charles Marlow expected here this night Where have you had your information  Miss NEVILLE  You may depend upon it I just saw his letter to Mr Hardcastle in which he tells him he intends setting out a few hours after his son  HASTINGS  Then my Constance all must be completed before he arrives He knows me and should he find me here would discover my name and perhaps my designs to the rest of the family  Miss NEVILLE  The jewels I hope are safe  HASTINGS  Yes yes I have sent them to Marlow who keeps the keys of our baggage In the meantime I'll go to prepare matters for our elopement I have had the Squire's promise of a fresh pair of horses and if I should not see him again will write him further directions  Exit  Miss NEVILLE  Well success attend you In the meantime I'll go amuse my aunt with the old pretence of a violent passion for my cousin  Exit  Enter MARLOW followed by a Servant  MARLOW  I wonder what Hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him when he knows the only place I have is the seat of a postcoach at an Inndoor Have you deposited the casket with the landlady as I ordered you Have you put it into her own hands  SERVANT  Yes your honour  MARLOW  She said she'd keep it safe did she  SERVANT  Yes she said she'd keep it safe enough she ask'd me how I came by it and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself  Exit  Servant  MARLOW  Ha ha ha They're safe however What an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst This little barmaid though runs in my head most strangely and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family She's mine she must be mine or I'm greatly mistaken  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  Bless me I quite forgot to tell her that I intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden Marlow here and in spirits too  MARLOW  Give me joy George Crown me shadow me with laurels Well George after all we modest fellows don't want for success among the women  HASTINGS  Some women you mean But what success has your honour's modesty been crowned with now that it grows so insolent upon us  MARLOW  Didn't you see the tempting brisk lovely little thing that runs about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle  HASTINGS  Well and what then  MARLOW  She's mine you rogue you Such fire such motion such eyes such lipsbut egad she would not let me kiss them though  HASTINGS  But are you so sure so very sure of her  MARLOW  Why man she talk'd of shewing me her work abovestairs and I am to improve the pattern  HASTINGS  But how can  you  Charles go about to rob a woman of her honour  MARLOW  Pshaw pshaw we all know the honour of the barmaid of an inn I don't intend to  rob  her take my word for it there's nothing in this house I shan't honestly  pay  for  HASTINGS  I believe the girl has virtue  MARLOW  And if she has I should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it  HASTINGS  You have taken care I hope of the casket I sent you to lock up It's in safety  MARLOW  Yes yes It's safe enough I have taken care of it But how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an Inndoor a place of safety Ah numbskull I have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourselfI have  HASTINGS  What  MARLOW  I have sent it to the landlady to keep for you  HASTINGS  To the landlady  MARLOW  The landlady  HASTINGS  You did  MARLOW  I did She's to be answerable for its forthcoming you know  HASTINGS  Yes she'll bring it forth with a witness  MARLOW  Wasn't I right I believe you'll allow that I acted prudently upon this occasion  HASTINGS  Aside  He must not see my uneasiness  MARLOW  You seem a little disconcerted though methinks Sure nothing has happened  HASTINGS  No nothing Never was in better spirits in all my life And so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge  MARLOW  Rather too readily For she not only kept the casket but thro' her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too Ha ha ha  HASTINGS  He he he They're safe however  MARLOW  As a guinea in a miser's purse  HASTINGS  Aside  So now all hopes of fortune are at an end and we must set off without it  To him  Well Charles I'll leave you to your meditations on the pretty barmaid and he he he may you be as successful for yourself as you have been for me  Exit  MARLOW  Thank ye George I ask no more Ha ha ha  Enter HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  I no longer know my own house It's turned all topseyturvey His servants have got drunk already I'll bear it no longer and yet from my respect for his father I'll be calm  To him  Mr Marlow your servant I'm your very humble servant  bowing low  MARLOW  Sir your humble servant  Aside  What's to be the wonder now  HARDCASTLE  I believe Sir you must be sensible Sir that no man alive ought to be more welcome than your father's son Sir I hope you think so  MARLOW  I do from my soul Sir I don't want much intreaty I generally make my father's son welcome wherever he goes  HARDCASTLE  I believe you do from my soul Sir But tho' I say nothing to your own conduct that of your Servants is insufferable Their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house I assure you  MARLOW  I protest my very good Sir that's no fault of mine If they don't drink as they ought  they  are to blame I ordered them not to spare the cellar I did I assure you  To the side scene  Here let one of my servants come up  To him  My positive directions were that as I did not drink myself they should make up for my deficiencies below  HARDCASTLE  Then they had your orders for what they do I'm satisfied  MARLOW  They had I assure You shall hear from one of themselves  Enter SERVANT drunk  MARLOW  You Jeremy Come forward sirrah What were my orders Were you not told to drink freely and call for what you thought fit for the good of the house  HARDCASTLE  Aside  I begin to lose my patience  JEREMY  Please your honour liberty and Fleetstreet for ever Tho' I'm but a servant I'm as good as another  man I'll drink for no man before supper Sir dammy Good liquor will sit upon a good supper but a good supper will not sit uponhiccupupon my conscience Sir  MARLOW  You see my old friend the fellow is as drunk as he can possibly be I don't know what you'd have more unless you'd have the poor devil soused in a beerbarrel  HARDCASTLE  Zounds He'll drive me distracted if I contain myself any longer Mr Marlow Sir I have submitted to your insolence for more than four hours and I see no likelihood of its coming to an end I'm now resolved to be master here Sir and I desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly  MARLOW  Leave your houseSure you jest my good friend What when I'm doing what I can to please you  HARDCASTLE  I tell you Sir you don't please me so I desire you'll leave my house  MARLOW  Sure you cannot be serious At this time o'night and such a night You only mean to banter me  HARDCASTLE  I tell you Sir I'm serious and now that my passions are rouzed I say this house is mine Sir this house is mine and I command you to leave it directly  MARLOW  Ha ha ha A puddle in a storm I shan't stir a step I assure you  In a serious tone  This your house fellow It's my house This is my  house Mine while I chuse to stay What right have you to bid me leave this house Sir I never met with such impudence curse me never in my whole life before  HARDCASTLE  Nor I confound me if ever I did To come to my house to call for what he likes to turn me out of my own chair to insult the family to order his servants to get drunk and then to tell me  This house is mine Sir  By all that's impudent it makes me laugh Ha ha ha Pray Sir  bantering  as you take the house what think you of taking the rest of the furniture There's a pair of silver candlesticks and there's a firescreen and here's a pair of brazen nosed bellows perhaps you may take a fancy to them  MARLOW  Bring me your bill Sir bring me your bill and let's make no more words about it  HARDCASTLE  There are a set of prints too What think you of the rake's progress for your own apartment  MARLOW  Bring me your bill I say and I'll leave you and your infernal house directly  HARDCASTLE  Then there's a mahogony table that you may see your own face in  MARLOW  My bill I say  HARDCASTLE  I had forgot the great chair for your own particular slumbers after a hearty meal  MARLOW  Zounds bring me my bill I say and let's hear no more on't  HARDCASTLE  Young man young man from your father's letter to me I was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now I find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it  Exit  MARLOW  How's this Sure I have not mistaken the house Every thing looks like an inn The servants cry coming The attendance is aukward the barmaid too to attend us But she's here and will further inform me Whither so fast child A word with you  Enter  Miss HARDCASTLE  Miss HARDCASTLE  Let it be short then I'm in a hurry  Aside  I believe he begins to find out his mistake but its too soon quite to undeceive him  MARLOW  Pray child answer me one question What are you and what may your business in this house be  Miss HARDCASTLE  A relation of the family Sir  MARLOW  What A poor relation  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir A poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them  MARLOW  That is you act as the barmaid of this inn  Miss HARDCASTLE  Inn O lawWhat brought that in your head One of the best families in the county keep an inn Ha ha ha old Mr Hardcastle's house an inn  MARLOW  Mr Hardcastle's house Is this house Mr Hardcastle's house child  Miss HARDCASTLE  Ay sure Whose else should it be  MARLOW  So then all's out and I have been damnably imposed on O confound my stupid head I shall be laugh'd at over the whole town I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops The Dullissimo Maccaroni To mistake this house of all others for an inn and my father's old friend for an innkeeper What a swaggering puppy must he take me for What a silly puppy do I find myself There again may I be hang'd my dear but I mistook you for the barmaid  Miss HARDCASTLE  Dear me dear me I'm sure there's nothing in my  behavour  to put me upon a level with one of that stamp  MARLOW  Nothing my dear nothing But I was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber My stupidity saw every thing the wrong way I mistook your assiduity for assurance and your simplicity for allurement But its overThis house I no more shew  my  face in  Miss HARDCASTLE  I hope Sir I have done nothing to disoblige you I'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many  civil things to me I'm sure I should be sorry  pretending to cry  if he left the family upon my account I'm sure I should be sorry people said any thing amiss since I have no fortune but my character  MARLOW  Aside  By heaven she weeps This is the first mark of tenderness I ever had from a modest woman and it touches me  to her  Excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family I leave with reluctance But to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education make an honourable connexion impossible and I can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour or bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aside  Generous man I now begin to admire him  to him  But I'm sure my family is as good as miss Hardcastle's and though I'm poor that's no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment I never thought that it was bad to want fortune  MARLOW  And why now my pretty simplicity  Miss HARDCASTLE  Because it puts me at a distance from one that if I had a thousand pound I would give it all to  MARLOW  Aside  This simplicity bewitches me so that if I stay I'm undone I must make one bold effort and leave her  to her  Your partiality in my favour my dear touches me most sensibly and  were I to live for myself alone I could easily fix my choice But I owe too much to the opinion of the world too much to the authority of a father so thatI can scarcely speak itit affects me Farewell  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE  I never knew half his merit till now He shall not go if I have power or art to detain him I'll still preserve the character in which I stoop'd to conquer but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution  Exit  Enter  TONY Miss NEVILLE  TONY  Ay you may steal for yourselves the next time I have done my duty She has got the jewels again that's a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants  Miss NEVILLE  But my dear cousin sure you won't forsake us in this distress If she in the least suspects that I am going off I shall certainly be locked up or sent to my aunt Pedigree's which is ten times worse  TONY  To be sure aunts of all kinds are damn'd bad things But what can I do I have got you a pair of horses that will fly like Whistlejacket and I'm sure you can't say but I have courted you nicely before her face Here she comes we must court a bit or two more for fear she should suspect us  They retire and seem to fondle  Enter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well I was greatly fluttered to be sure But my son tells me it was all a mistake of the servants I shan't be easy however till they are fairly married and then let her keep her own fortune But what do I see Fondling together as I'm alive I never saw Tony so sprightly before Ah have I caught you my pretty doves What billing exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs Ah  TONY  As for murmurs mother we grumble a little now and then to be sure But there's no love lost between us  Mrs HARDCASTLE  A mere sprinkling Tony upon the flame only to make it burn brighter  Miss NEVILLE  Cousin Tony promises to give us more of his company at home Indeed he shan't leave us any more It won't leave us cousin Tony will it  TONY  O it's a pretty creature No I'd sooner leave my horse in a pound than leave you when you smile upon one so Your laugh makes you so becoming  Miss NEVILLE  Agreeable cousin Who can help admiring that natural humour that pleasant broad red thoughtless  patting his cheek  ah it's a bold face  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Pretty innocence  TONY  I'm sure I always lov'd cousin Con's hazle eyes and her pretty long fingers that she twists this way and that over the haspicholls like a parcel of bobbins  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Ah he would charm the bird from the tree I was never so happy before My boy takes after his father poor Mr Lumpkin exactly The jewels my dear Con shall be your's incontinently You shall have them Isn't he a sweet boy my dear You shall be married tomorrow and we'll put off the rest of his education like Dr Drowsy's sermons to a fitter opportunity  Enter  DIGGORY  DIGGORY  Where's the 'Squire I have got a letter for your worship  TONY  Give it to my mamma She reads all my letters first  DIGGORY  I had o  ders to deliver it into your own hands  TONY  Who does it come from  DIGGORY  Your worship mun ask that o' the letter itself  TONY  I could wish to know tho'  turning the letter and gazing on it  Miss NEVILLE  Aside  Undone undone A letter to him from Hastings I know the hand If my aunt sees it we are ruined for ever I'll keep her employ'd  a little if I can  To Mrs Hardcastle  But I have not told you Madam of my cousin's smart answer just now to Mr Marlow We so laugh'dYou must know Madamthis way a little for he must not hear us  They confer  TONY  Still gazing  A damn'd cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life I can read your printhand very well But here there are such handles and shanks and dashes that one can scarce tell the head from the tail  To Anthony Lumpkin Esquire  It's very odd I can read the outside of my letters where my own name is well enough But when I come to open it it's allbuzz That's hard very hard for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha Very well very well And so my son was too hard for the philosopher  Miss NEVILLE  Yes Madam but you must hear the rest Madam A little more this way or he may hear us You'll hear how he puzzled him again  Mrs HARDCASTLE  He seems strangely puzzled now himself methinks  TONY  Still gazing  A damn'd up and down hand as if it was disguised in liquor  Reading  Dear Sir  Ay that's that Then there's an  M  and  a T  and an  S  but whether the next be an  izzard  or an  R  confound me I cannot tell  Mrs HARDCASTLE  What's that my dear Can I give you any assistance  Miss NEVILLE  Pray aunt let me read it No body reads a cramp hand better than I  twitching the letter from her  Do you know who it is from  TONY  Can't tell except from Dick Ginger the feeder  Miss NEVILLE  Ay so it is  pretending to read  Dear 'Squire Hoping that you're in health as I am at this present The gentlemen of the Shake bag club has cut the gentlemen of goosegreen quite out of feather The oddsumodd battleumlong fightingum here here it's all about cocks and fighting it's of no consequence here put it up put it up  thrusting the crumpled letter upon him  TONY  But I tell you Miss it's of all the consequence in the world I would not lose the rest of it for a guinea Here mother do you make it out Of no consequence  giving Mrs Hardcastle the letter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  How's this  reads  Dear 'Squire I'm now waiting for Miss Neville with a postchaise and pair at the bottom of the garden but I find my horses yet unable to perform the journey I expect you'll assist us with a pair of fresh horses as you promised Dispatch is necessary as the  hag  ay the hag your mother will otherwise suspect us Your's Hastings Grant me patience I shall run distracted My rage choaks me  Miss NEVILLE  I hope Madam you'll suspend your resentment for a few moments and not impute to me any impertinence or sinister design that belongs to another  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Curtesying very low  Fine spoken Madam you are most miraculously polite and engaging and quite the very pink of curtesy and circumspection Madam  Changing her tone  And you you great illfashioned oaf with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth shut Were you too join'd against me But I'll defeat all your plots in a moment As for you Madam since you have got a pair of fresh horses ready it would be cruel to disappoint them So if you please instead of running away with your spark prepare this very moment to run off with  me  Your old aunt Pedigree will keep you secure I'll warrant me You too Sir may mount your horse and guard us upon the way Here Thomas Roger Diggory I'll shew you that I wish you better than you do yourselves  Exit  Miss NEVILLE  So now I'm completely ruined  TONY  Ay that's a sure thing  Miss NEVILLE  What better could be expected from being connected with such a stupid fool and after all the nods and signs I made him  TONY  By the laws Miss it was your own cleverness and not my stupidity that did your business You were so nice and so busy with your

and the Old Gentleman of the house have been laughing at Mr Marlow's mistake this half hour They are coming this way  HASTINGS  Then I must not be seen So now to my fruitless appointment at the bottom of the garden This is about the time  Exit  Enter  SIR CHARLES  and  HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha The peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands  Sir CHARLES  And the reserve with which I suppose he treated all your advances  HARDCASTLE  And yet he might have seen something in me above a common innkeeper too  Sir CHARLES  Yes Dick but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper ha ha ha  HARDCASTLE  Well I'm in too good spirits to think of any thing but joy Yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and tho' my daughter's fortune is but small  Sir CHARLES  Why Dick will you talk of fortune to  me  My son is possessed of more than a competence already and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and encrease it If they like each other as you say they do  HARDCASTLE  If  man I tell you they  do  like each other My daughter as good as told me so  Sir CHARLES  But girls are apt to flatter themselves you know  HARDCASTLE  I saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your  iffs  I warrant him  Enter  MARLOW  MARLOW  I come Sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct I can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion  HARDCASTLE  Tut boy a trifle You take it too gravely An hour or two's laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again She'll never like you the worse for it  MARLOW  Sir I shall be always proud of her approbation  HARDCASTLE  Approbation is but a cold word Mr Marlow if I am not deceived you have something more than approbation thereabouts You take me  MARLOW  Really Sir I have not that happiness  HARDCASTLE  Come boy I'm an old fellow and know what's what as well as you that are younger I know what has past between you but mum  MARLOW  Sure Sir nothing has past between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on her's You don't think Sir that my impudence has been past upon all the rest of the family  Miss HARDCASTLE  Impudence No I don't say thatNot quite impudenceThough girls like to be play'd with and rumpled a little too sometimes But she has told no tales I assure you  MARLOW  I never gave her the slightest cause  HARDCASTLE  Well well I like modesty in its place well enough But this is overacting young gentleman You  may  be open Your father and I will like you the better for it  MARLOW  May I die Sir if I ever  HARDCASTLE  I tell you she don't dislike you and as I'm sure you like her  MARLOW  Dear SirI protest Sir  HARDCASTLE  I see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you  MARLOW  But hear me Sir  HARDCASTLE  Your father approves the match I admire it every moment's delay will be doing mischief so  MARLOW  But why won't you hear me By all that's just and true I never gave miss Hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection We had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting  HARDCASTLE  Aside  This fellow's formal modest impudence is beyond bearing  Sir CHARLES  And you never grasp'd her hand or made any protestations  MARLOW  As heaven is my witness I came down in obedience to your commands I saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance I hope you'll exact no further proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which I suffer so many mortifications  Exit  Sir CHARLES  I'm astonish'd at the air of sincerity with which he parted  HARDCASTLE  And I'm astonish'd at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance  Sir CHARLES  I dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth  HARDCASTLE  Here comes my daughter and I would stake my happiness upon her veracity  Enter  Miss HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Kate come hither child Answer us sincerely and without reserve has Mr Marlow made you any professions of love and affection  Miss HARDCASTLE  The question is very abrupt Sir But since you require unreserved sincerity I think he has  HARDCASTLE  To Sir Charles  You see  Sir CHARLES  And pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir several  HARDCASTLE  To Sir Charles  You see  Sir CHARLES  But did he profess any attachment  Miss HARDCASTLE  A lasting one  Sir CHARLES  Did he talk of love  Miss HARDCASTLE  Much Sir  Sir CHARLES  Amazing And all this formally  Miss HARDCASTLE  Formally  HARDCASTLE  Now my friend I hope you are satisfied  Sir CHARLES  And how did he behave madam  Miss HARDCASTLE  As most profest admirers do Said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture  Sir CHARLES  Now I'm perfectly convinced indeed I know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive This forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him and I am confident he never sate for the picture  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then what Sir if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity If you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person  Sir CHARLES  Agreed And if I find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE  And if you don't find him what I describeI fear my happiness must never have a beginning  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to the Back of the Garden  Enter  HASTINGS  HASTINGS  What an ideot am I to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying me He never intended to be punctual and I'll wait no longer What do I see It is he and perhaps with news of my Constance  Enter  TONY  bocted and spattered  HASTINGS  My honest 'Squire I now find you a man of your word This looks like friendship  TONY  Ay I'm your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all This riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome It has shook me worse than the basket of a stagecoach  HASTINGS  But how Where did you leave your fellow travellers Are they in safety Are they housed  TONY  Five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad driving The poor beasts have smoaked for it Rabbet me but I'd rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such  varment  HASTINGS  Well but where have you left the ladies I die with impatience  TONY  Left them Why where should I leave them but where I found them  HASTINGS  This is a riddle  TONY  Riddle me this then What's that goes round the house and round the house and never touches the house  HASTINGS  I'm still astray  TONY  Why that's it mon I have led them astray By jingo there's not a pond or slough within five miles of the place but they can tell the taste of  HASTINGS  Ha ha ha I understand you took them in a round while they supposed themselves going forward And so you have at last brought them home again  TONY  You shall hear I first took them down Featherbedlane where we stuck fast in the mud I then rattled them crack over the stones of Upanddown HillI then introduc'd them to the gibbet on Heavytree Heath and from that with a circumbendibus I fairly lodged them in the horsepond at the bottom of the garden  HASTINGS  But no accident I hope  TONY  No no Only mother is confoundedly frightened She thinks herself forty miles off She's sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl So if your own horses be ready you may whip off with cousin and I'll be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you  HASTINGS  My dear friend how can I be grateful  TONY  Ay now its dear friend noble 'Squire Just now it was all ideot cub and run me through the guts Damn  your  way of fighting I say After we take a knock in this part of the country we kiss and be friends But if you had run me through the guts then I should be dead and you might go kiss the hangman  HASTINGS  The rebuke is just But I must hasten to relieve miss Neville if you keep the old lady employed I promise to take care of the young one  Exit Hastings  TONY  Never fear me Here she comes Vanish She's got from the pond and draggled up to the waist like a mermaid  Enter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Oh Tony I'm killed Shook Battered to death I shall never survive it That last jolt that laid us against the quickset hedge has done my business  TONY  Alack mama it was all your own fault You would be for running away by night without knowing one inch of the way  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I wish we were at home again I never met so many accidents in so short a journey Drench'd in the mud overturn'd in a ditch stuck fast in a slough jolted to a jelly and at last to lose our way Whereabouts do you think we are Tony  TONY  By my guess we should be upon Crackskull common about forty miles from home  Mrs HARDCASTLE  O lud O lud the most notorious spot in all the country We only want a robbery to make a complete night on't  TONY  Don't be afraid mama don't be afraid Two of the five that kept here are hanged and the other three may not find us Don't be afraid Is that a man that's galloping behind us No its only a tree Don't be afraid  Mrs HARDCASTLE  The fright will certainly kill me  TONY  Do you see any thing like a black hat moving behind the thicket  Mrs HARDCASTLE  O death  TONY  No it's only a cow Don't be afraid mama don't be afraid  Mrs HARDCASTLE  As I'm alive Tony I see a man coming towards us Ah I'm sure on't If he perceives us we are undone  TONY  Aside  Fatherinlaw by all that's unlucky come to take one of his night walks  To her  Ah it's a highwayman with pistils as long as my arm A damn'd illlooking fellow  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Good heaven defend us He approaches  TONY  Do you hide yourself in that thicket and leave me to manage him If there be any danger I'll  cough and cry hem When I cough be sure to keep close  Mrs Hardcastle hides behind a tree in the back scene  Enter  HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  I'm mistaken or I heard voices of people in want of help Oh Tony is that you I did not expect you so soon back Are your mother and her charge in safety  TONY  Very safe Sir at my aunt Pedigree's Hem  Mrs HARDCASTLE  From behind  Ah death I find there's danger  HARDCASTLE  Forty miles in three hours sure that's too much my youngster  TONY  Stout horses and willing minds make short journies as they say Hem  Mrs HARDCASTLE  From behind  Sure he'll do the dear boy no harm  HARDCASTLE  But I heard a voice here I should be glad to know from whence it came  TONY  It was I Sir talking to myself Sir I was saying that forty miles in four hours was very good going Hem As to be sure it was Hem I have got a sort of cold by being out in the air We'll go in if you please Hem  HARDCASTLE  But if you talk'd to yourself you did not answer yourself I am certain I heard two voices and am resolved  raising his voice  to find the other out  Mrs HARDCASTLE  From behind  Oh he's coming to find me out Oh  TONY  What need you go Sir if I tell you Hem I'll lay down my life for the truthhemI'll tell you all Sir  detaining him  HARDCASTLE  I tell you I will not be detained I insist on seeing It's in vain to expect I'll believe you  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Running forward from behind  O lud he'll murder my poor boy my darling Here good gentleman whet your rage upon me Take my money my life but spare that young gentleman spare my child if you have any mercy  HARDCASTLE  My

will never bring you to justice indeed we won't good Mr Highwayman  HARDCASTLE  I believe the woman's out of her senses What Dorothy don't you know  me  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Mr Hardcastle as I'm alive My fears blinded me But who my dear could have expected to meet you here in this frightful place so far from home What has brought you to follow us  HARDCASTLE  Sure Dorothy you have not lost your wits So far from home when you are within forty  yards of your own door  To him  This is one of your old tricks you graceless rogue you  To her  Don't you know the gate and the mulberrytree and don't you remember the horsepond my dear  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Yes I shall remember the horsepond as long as I live I have caught my death in it  To  Tony  And is it to you you graceless varlet I owe all this I'll teach you to abuse your mother I will  TONY  Ecod mother all the parish says you have spoil'd me and so you may take the fruits on't  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I'll spoil you I will  Follows him off the stage Exit  HARDCASTLE  There's morality however in his reply  Exit  Enter  HASTINGS  and Miss  NEVILLE  HASTINGS  My dear Constance why will you deliberate thus If we delay a moment all is lost for ever Pluck up a little resolution and we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity  Miss NEVILLE  I find it impossible My spirits are so sunk with the agitations I have suffered that I am unable to face any new danger Two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness  HASTINGS  Such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy Let us fly my charmer Let us date our happiness from this very moment Perish fortune Love and content will encrease what we possess beyond a monarch's revenue Let me prevail  Miss NEVILLE  No Mr Hastings no Prudence once more comes to my relief and I will obey its dictates In the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance I'm resolved to apply to Mr Hardcastle's compassion and justice for redress  HASTINGS  But tho' he had the will he has not the power to relieve you  Miss NEVILLE  But he has influence and upon that I am resolved to rely  HASTINGS  I have no hopes But since you persist I must reluctantly obey you  Exeunt  SCENE  Changes  Enter Sir  CHARLES  and Miss  HARDCASTLE  Sir CHARLES  What a situation am I in If what you say appears I shall then find a guilty son If what he says be true I shall then lose one that of all others I most wish'd for a daughter  Miss HARDCASTLE  I am proud of your approbation and to shew I merit it if you place yourselves as I directed you shall hear his explicit declaration But he comes  Sir CHARLES  I'll to your father and keep him to the appointment  Exit Sir Charles  Enter  MARLOW  MARLOW  Tho' prepar'd for setting out I come once more to take leave nor did I till this moment know the pain I feel in the separation  Miss HARDCASTLE  In her own natural manner  I believe these sufferings cannot be very great Sir which you can so easily remove A day or two longer perhaps might lessen your uneasiness by shewing the little value of what you now think proper to regret  MARLOW  Aside  This girl every moment improves upon me  To her  It must not be Madam I have already trifled too long with my heart My very pride begins to submit to my passion The disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painful effort of resolution  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then go Sir I'll urge nothing more to detain you Tho' my family be as good as her's you came down to visit and my education I hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence I must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit I must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fix'd on fortune  Enter  HARDCASTLE  and Sir  CHARLES  from behind  Sir CHARLES  Here behind this screen  HARDCASTLE  Ay Ay make no noise I'll engage my Kate covers him with confusion at last  MARLOW  By heavens Madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration Your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion But every moment that I converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression What at first seem'd rustic plainness now appears refin'd simplicity What seem'd forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue  Sir CHARLES  What can it mean He amazes me  HARDCASTLE  I told you how it would be Hush  MARLOW  I am now determined to stay Madam and I have too good an opinion of my father's discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation  Miss HARDCASTLE  No Mr Marlow I will not cannot detain you Do you think I could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest room for repentance Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion Do you think I could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening your's  MARLOW  By all that's good I can have no happiness but what's in your power to grant me Nor shall I ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before I will stay even contrary to your wishes and tho' you should persist to shun me I  will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sir I must entreat you'll desist As our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference I might have given an hour or two to levity but feriously Mr Marlow do you think I could ever submit to a connexion where  I  must appear mercenary and  you  imprudent Do you think I could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer  MARLOW  Kneeling  Does this look like security Does this look like confidence No Madam every moment that shews me your merit only serves to encrease my diffidence and confusion Here let me continue  Sir CHARLES  I can hold it no longer Charles Charles how hast thou deceived me Is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation  HARDCASTLE  Your cold contempt your formal interview What have you to say now  MARLOW  That I'm all amazement What can it mean  HARDCASTLE  It means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure That you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter  MARLOW  Daughterthis lady your daughter  HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir my only daughter My Kate whose else should she be  MARLOW  Oh the devil  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for  curtesying  She that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha  MARLOW  Zounds there's no bearing this it's worse than death  Miss HARDCASTLE  In which of your characters Sir will you give us leave to address you As the faultering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with Mrs Mantrap and old Miss Biddy Buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha  MARLOW  O curse on my noisy head I never attempted to be impudent yet that I was not taken down I must be gone  HARDCASTLE  By the hand of my body but you shall not I see it was all a mistake and I am rejoiced to find it You shall not Sir I tell you I know she'll forgive you Won't you forgive him Kate We'll all forgive you Take courage man  They retire she tormenting him to the back Scene  Enter  Mrs HARDCASTLE TONY  Mrs HARDCASTLE  So so they're gone off Let them go I care not  HARDCASTLE  Who gone  Mrs HARDCASTLE  My dutiful niece and her gentleman Mr Hastings from Town He who came down with our modest visitor here  Sir CHARLES  Who my honest George Hastings As worthy a fellow as lives and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice  HARDCASTLE  Then by the hand of my body I'm proud of the connexion  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss  HARDCASTLE  Sure Dorothy you would not be so mercenary  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Ay that's my affair not your's But you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal  HARDCASTLE  Ay but he's not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal  Enter  HASTINGS  and  Miss NEVILLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Aside  What returned so soon I begin not to like it  HASTINGS  To Hardcastle  For my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be  my punishment We are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity By her father's consent I first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty  Miss NEVILLE  Since his death I have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression In an hour of levity I was ready even to give up my fortune to secure my choice But I'm now recover'd from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel  HARDCASTLE  Be it what it will I'm glad they're come back to reclaim their due Come hither Tony boy Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you  TONY  What signifies my refusing You know I can't refuse her till I'm of age father  HARDCASTLE  While I thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement I concurred with your mother's desire to keep it secret But since I find she turns it to a wrong use I must now declare you have been of age these three months  TONY  Of age Am I of age father  HARDCASTLE  Above three months  TONY  Then you'll see the first use I'll make of my liberty  taking miss Neville's hand  Witness all men by these presents that I Anthony Lumpkin  Esquire of BLANK place refuse you Constantia Neville spinster of no place at all for my true and lawful wife So Constance Neville may marry whom she pleases and Tony Lumpkin is his own man again  Sir CHARLES  O brave 'Squire  HASTINGS  My worthy friend  Mrs HARDCASTLE  My undutiful offspring  MARLOW  Joy my dear George I give you joy sincerely And could I prevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary I should be the happiest man alive if you would return me the favour  HASTINGS  To miss Hardcastle  Come madam you are now driven to the very last scene of all your contrivances I know you like him I'm sure he loves you and you must and shall have him  HARDCASTLE  Joining their hands  And I say so too And Mr Marlow if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter I don't believe you'll ever repent your bargain So now to supper tomorrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us and the Mistakes of the Night shall be crowned with a merry morning so boy take her and as you have been mistakenn in the mistress my wish is that you may never be mistaken in the wife  FINIS  EPILOGUE  To be Spoken in the Character of  TONY LUMPKIN  BY J CRADDOCK Esq  WELL  now all's endedand my comrades gone  Pray what becomes of  mother's nonly son  A hopeful bladein town I'll fix my station  And try to make a bluster in the nation  As for my cousin Neville I renounce her  Offin a crackI'll carry big Bett Bouncer  Why should not I in the great world appear  I soon shall have a thousand pounds a year  No matter what a man may here inherit  In London'gad they've some regard to spirit  I see the horses prancing up the streets  And big Bet Bouncer bobs to all she meets  Then hoikes to jiggs and pastimes ev'ry night  Not to the playsthey say it a'n't polite  To Sadler'sWells perhaps or Operas go  And once by chance to the roratorio  Thus here and there for ever up and down  We'll set the fashions too to half the town  And then at auctionsmoney ne'er regard  Buy pictures like the great ten pounds a yard  Zounds we shall make these London gentry say  We know what's damn'd genteel as well as they  * This came too late to be Spoken
