 A COLLECTION OF THE Most esteemed PIECES of POETRY That have appeared for several YEARS  WITH VARIETY OF ORIGINALS By the Late MOSES MENDEZ  Esq  And other Contributors to DODSLEY's COLLECTION  To which this is intended as a SUPPLEMENT  LONDON Printed for Richardson and Urquhart under the Royal Exchange MDCCLXVII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Editor's chief intention in making the following Collection was to bring into one point of view the best pieces which have appeared since the conclusion of Dodsley's collection and he will venture to affirm that whatever be the merit of that entertaining miscellany this does not fall short any ways of it as some of the volumes in that are made up from the publications of a few years whereas this contains whatever has been most applauded in a course of twenty But he has not confined himself to that period only but inserted many pieces in his opinion of great merit which the inattention of the public or the obscurity of the publication had long suffered to remain unnoticed To these are added many originals by writers of acknowledged merit among which those of Mr Mendez author of the Chaplet and several admired poems in Dodsley's Miscellany make no mean figure Mr Mendez was reckoned among the most agreeable poets of his time and perhaps he was the only one that was ever worth one hundred thousand pounds  CONTENTS  AN Elegy on the Death

ELEGY On the DEATH of a LADY  Written in  By WILLIAM MASON MA  THE midnight clock has toll'd and hark the bell  Of Death beats slow heard ye the note profound  It pauses now and now with rising knell  Flings to the hollow gale its sullen sound  Yes *** is dead Attend the strain  Daughters of Albion Ye that light as air  So oft have tript in her fantastic train  With hearts as gay and faces half as fair  For she was fair beyond your brightest bloom  This Envy owns since now her bloom is fled  Fair as the Forms that wove in Fancy's loom  Float in light vision round the Poet's head  Whene'er with soft serenity she smil'd  Or caught the orient blush of quick surprize  How sweetly mutable how brightly wild  The liquid lustre darted from her eyes  Each look each motion wak'd a newborn grace  That o'er her form its transient glory cast  Some lovelier wonder soon usurp'd the place  Chas'd by a charm still lovelier than the last  That bell again It tells us what she is  On what she was no more the strain prolong  Luxuriant Fancy pause an hour like this  Demands the tribute of a serious Song  MARIA claims it from that sable bier  Where cold and wan the slumberer rests her head  In still small whispers to reflection's ear  She breathes the solemn dictates of the Dead  O catch the awful notes and lift them loud  Proclaim the theme by Sage by Fool rever'd  Hear it ye Young ye Vain ye Great ye Proud  'Tis Nature speaks and Nature will be heard  Yes ye shall hear and tremble as you hear  While high with health your hearts exulting leap  Ev'n in the midst of pleasure's mad career  The mental Monitor shall wake and weep  For say than ***'s propitious star  What brighter planet on your births arose  Or gave of Fortune's gifts an ampler share  In life to lavish or by death to lose  Early to lose while born on busy wing  Ye sip the nectar of each varying bloom  Nor fear while basking in the beams of spring  The wintry storm that sweeps you to the tomb  Think of her Fate revere the heav'nly hand  That led her hence though soon by steps so slow  Long at her couch Death took his patient stand  And menac'd oft and oft withheld the blow  To give Reflection time with lenient art  Each fond delusion from her soul to steal  Teach her from Folly peaceably to part  And wean her from a world she lov'd so well  Say are ye sure his Mercy shall extend  To you so long a span Alas ye sigh  Make then while yet ye may your God your friend  And learn with equal ease to sleep or die  Nor think the Muse whose sober voice ye hear  Contracts with bigot frown her sullen brow  Casts round Religion's orb the mists of fear  Or shades with horrors what with smiles should glow  No she would warm you with seraphic fire  Heirs as ye are of heav'n's eternal day  Would bid you boldly to that heav'n aspire  Not sink and slumber in your cells of clay  Know ye were form'd to range yon azure field  In yon aethereal founts of bliss to lave  Force then secure in Faith's protecting shield  The Sting from Death the Vict'ry from the Grave  Is this the bigot's rant Away ye Vain  Your hopes your fears in doubt in dulness steep  Go sooth your souls in sickness grief or pain  With the sad solace of eternal sleep  Yet will I praise you triflers as ye are  More than those Preachers of your fav'rite creed  Who proudly swell the brazen throat of War  Who form the Phalanx bid the battle bleed  Nor wish for more who conquer but to die  Hear Folly hear and triumph in the tale  Like you they reason not like you enjoy  The breeze of bliss that fills your silken sail  On Pleasure's glitt'ring stream ye gayly steer  Your little course to cold oblivion's shore  They dare the storm and through th'inclement year  Stem the rough surge and brave the torrent's roar  NOTE In a book of  French  verses entitled  Oeuvres du Philosophe de sans Souci  and lately reprinted at  Berlin  by authority under the title of  Poesies Diverses  may be found an epistle to marshal KEITH written professedly against the immortality of the Soul By way of specimen of the whole take the following lines  De l'avenir cher KEITH jugeons par le passé  Comme avant que je fusse il n'avoit point pensé  De meme apres ma mort quand toutes mes parties  Par le corruption seront aneanties  Par un meme destin il ne pensera plus  Non rien n'est plus certain soyonsen convaincu c  It is to this epistle that the rest of the Elegy alludes  Is it for Glory that just Fate denies  Long must the warrior moulder in his shroud  E'er from her trump the heav'nbreath'd accents rise  That lift the Hero from the fighting croud  Is it his grasp of Empire to extend  To curb the fury of insulting foes  Ambition cease the idle contest end  'Tis but a Kingdom thou canst win or lose  And why must murder'd myriads lose their all  If Life be all why desolation lour  With famish'd frown on this affrighted ball  That thou may'st flame the meteor of an hour  Go wiser ye that flutter Life away  Crown with the mantling Juice the goblet high  Weave the light dance with festive freedom gay  And live your moment since the next ye die  Yet know vain Scepticks know th'Almighty mind  Who breath'd on Man a portion of his fire  Bad his free Soul by earth nor time confin'd  To Heav'n to Immortality aspire  Nor shall the Pile of Hope his Mercy rear'd  By vain Philosophy be e'er destroy'd  Eternity by all or wish'd or fear'd  Shall be by all or suffer'd or enjoy'd  ORIENTAL ECLOGUES  By Mr WILLIAM COLLINS  ECLOGUE I  SELIM OR THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL  SCENE A VALLEY NEAR BAGDAT  TIME THE MORNING  YE Persian maids attend your poet's lays  And hear how shepherds pass their golden days  Not all are blest whom fortune's hand sustains  With wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains  Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell  'Tis virtue makes the bliss where'er we dwell  Thus Selim sung by sacred Truth inspir'd  Nor praise but such as Truth bestow'd desir'd  Wise in himself his meaning songs convey'd  Informing morals to the shepherd maid  Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find  What groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind  When sweet and blushing like a virgin bride  The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride  When wanton gales along the valleys play  Breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away  By Tigris' wandering waves he sat and sung  This useful lesson for the fair and young  Ye Persian dames he said to you belong  Well may they please the morals of my song  No fairer maids I trust than you are found  Grac'd with soft arts the peopled world around  The morn that lights you to your loves supplies  Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes  For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow  And yours the love that kings delight to know  Yet think not these all beauteous as they are  The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair  Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray  Boast but the worth Bassora's pearls display  Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright  But dark within they drink no lustrous light  Such are the maids and such the charms they boast  By sense unaided or to virtue lost  Selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain  That love shall blind when once he fires the swain  Or hope a lover by your faults to win  As spots on ermin beautify the skin  Who seeks secure to rule be first her care  Each softer virtue that adorns the fair  Each tender passion man delights to find  The lov'd perfections of a female mind  Blest were the days when wisdom held her reign  And shepherds sought her on the silent plain  With Truth she wedded in the secret grove  Immortal Truth and daughters bless'd their love  O haste fair maids ye Virtues come away  Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way  The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore  By Ind excell'd or Araby no more  Lost to our fields for so the fates ordain  The dear deserters shall return again  Come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear  To lead the train sweet modesty appear  Here make thy court amidst our rural scene  And shepherd girls shall own thee for their queen  With thee be Chastity of all afraid  Distrusting all a wise suspicious maid  But man the mostnot more the mountain doe  Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe  Cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew  A silken veil conceals her from the view  No wild desires amidst thy train be known  But Faith whose heart is fix'd on one alone  Desponding Meekness with her downcast eyes  And friendly Pity full of tender sighs  And love the last by these your hearts approve  These are the virtues that must lead to love  Thus sung the swain and ancient legends say  The maids of Bagdat verified the lay  Dear to the plains the Virtues came along  The shepherds lov'd and Selim bless'd his song  ECLOGUE II  HASSAN OR THE CAMELDRIVER  SCENE THE DESERT  TIME MIDDAY  IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste  The driver Hassan with his camels past  One cruise of water on his back he bore  And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store  A fan of painted feathers in his hand  To guard his shaded face from scorching sand  The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky  And not a tree and not an herb was nigh  The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue  Shrill roar'd the winds and dreary was the view  With desperate sorrow wild th' affrighted man  Thrice sigh'd thrice struck his breast and thus began  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Ah little thought I of the blasting wind  The thirst or pinching hunger that I find  Bethink thee Hassan where shall Thirst asswage  When fails this cruise his unrelenting rage  Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign  Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine  Ye mute companions of my toils that bear  In all my griefs a more than equal share  Here where no springs in murmurs break away  Or mosscrown'd fountains mitigate the day  In vain ye hope the green delights to know  Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow  Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found  And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Curst be the gold and silver which persuade  Weak men to follow farfatiguing trade  The lilly peace outshines the silver store  And life is dearer than the golden ore  Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown  To every distant mart and wealthy town  Full oft we tempt the land and oft the sea  And are we only yet repay'd by thee  Ah why was ruin so attractive made  Or why fond man so easily betray'd  Why heed we not while mad we haste along  The gentle voice of peace or pleasure's song  Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side  The mountain's murmurs and the valley's pride  Why think we these less pleasing to behold  Than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O cease my fearsall frantic as I go  When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe  What if the lion in his rage I meet  Oft in the dust I view his printed feet  And fearful oft when day's declining light  Yields her pale empire to the mourner night  By hunger rous'd he scours the groaning plain  Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train  Before them death with shrieks directs their way  Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep  If aught of rest I find upon my sleep  Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around  And wake to anguish with a burning wound  Thrice happy they the wise contented poor  From lust of wealth and dread of death secure  They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find  Peace rules the day where reason rules the mind  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O hapless youth for she thy love hath won  The tender Zara will be most undone  Big swell'd my heart and own'd the powerful maid  When fast she dropt her tears as thus she said  " Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  " Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain  " Yet as thou go'st may every blast arise  " Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  " Safe o'er the wild no perils may'st thou see  " No griefs endure nor weep false youth like me"  O let me safely to the fair return  Say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn  O let me teach my heart to lose its fears  Recall'd by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears  He said and call'd on heaven to bless the day  When back to Schiraz' walls he bent his way  ECLOGUE III  ABRA OR THE GEORGIAN SULTANA  SCENE A FOREST  TIME THE EVENING  IN Georgia's land where Tefflis' towers are seen  In distant view along the level green  While evening dews enrich the glittering glade  And the tall forests cast a longer shade  What time 'tis sweet o'er fields of rice to stray  Or scent the breathing maize at setting day  Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove  Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love  Of Abra first began the tender strain  Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain  At morn she came those willing flocks to lead  Where lilliesrear them in the watery mead  From early dawn the livelong hours she told  'Till late at silent eve she penn'd the fold  Deep in the grove beneath the secret shade  A various wreath of odorous flowers she made  Gaymotley'd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose  The violet blue that on the mossbank grows  Allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there  The finish'd chaplet welladorn'd her hair  Great Abbas chanc'd that fated morn to stray  By love conducted from the chace away  Among the vocal vales he heard her song  And sought the vales and echoing groves among  At length he found and woo'd the rural maid  She knew the monarch and with fear obey'd  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  The royal lover bore her from the plain  Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain  Oft as she went she backward turn'd her view  And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu  Fair happy maid to  her scenes remove  To richer scenes of  den power and love  Go leave the simple p  and shepherd's strain  With love delight thee and with Abbas reign  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Yet midst the blaze of courts she fix'd her love  On the cool fountain or the shady grove  Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind  To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclin'd  And oft as spring renew'd the plains with flowers  Breath'd his soft gales and led the fragrant hours  With sure return she sought the sylvan scene  The breezy mountains and the forests green  Her maids around her mov'd a duteous band  Each bore a crook allrural in her hand  Some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung  With joy the mountain and the forest rung  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  And oft the royal lover left the care  And thorns of state attendant on the fair  Oft to the shades and lowroof'd cots retir'd  Or sought the vale where first his heart was fir'd  A russet mantle like a swain he wore  And thought of crowns and busy courts no more  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Blest was the life that royal Abbas led  Sweet was his love and innocent his bed  What if in wealth the noble maid excel  The simple shepherd girl can love as well  Let those who rule on Persia's jewell'd throne  Be fam'd for love and gentlest love alone  Or wreathe like Abbas full of fair renown  The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown  O happy days the maids around her say  O haste profuse of blessings haste away  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  ECLOGUE IV  AGIB AND SECANDER OR THE FUGITIVES  SCENE A MOUNTAIN IN CIRCASSIA  TIME MIDNIGHT  IN fair Circassia where to love inclin'd  Each swain was blest for every maid was kind  At that still hour when awful midnight reigns  And none but wretches haunt the twilight plains  What time the moon had hung her lamp on high  And past in radiance thro' the cloudless sky  Sad o'er the dews two brother shepherds fled  Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led  Fast as they prest their flight behind them lay  Wide ravag'd plains and vallies stole away  Along the mountain's bending sides they ran  'Till faint and weak Secander thus began  SECANDER  O stay thee Agib for my feet deny  No longer friendly to my life to fly  Friend of my heart O turn thee and survey  Trace our said flight thro' all its length of way  And first review that longextended plain  And yon wide groves already past with pain  Yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried  And last this lofty mountain's weary side  AGIB  Weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know  The toils of flight or some severer woe  Still as I haste the Tartar shouts behind  And shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind  In rage of heart with ruin in his hand  He blasts our harvests and deforms our land  Yon citron grove whence first in fear we came  Droops its fair honours to the conquering flame  Far fly the swains like us in deep despair  And leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  SECANDER  Unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword  In vain unheard thou call'st thy Persian lord  In vain thou court'st him helpless to thine aid  To shield the shepherd and protect the maid  Far off in thoughtless indolence resign'd  Soft dreams of love and pleasure sooth his mind  'Midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy  No wars alarm him and no fears annoy  AGIB  Yet these green hills in summer's sultry heat  Have lent the monarch oft a cool retreat  Sweet to the sight is Zabran's flowery plain  And once by maids and shepherds lov'd in vain  No more the virgins shall delight to rove  By Sargis' banks or Irwan's shady grove  On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale  Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale  Fair scenes but ah no more with peace possest  With ease alluring and with plenty blest  No more the shepherd's whitening tents appear  Nor the kind products of a bounteous year  No more the date with snowy blossoms crown'd  But ruin spreads her baleful fires around  SECANDER  In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves  For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves  In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair  Their eye's blue languish and their golden hair  Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send  Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend  AGIB  Ye Georgian swains that piteous learn from far  Circassia's ruin and the waste of war  Some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare  To shield your harvests and defend your fair  The Turk and Tartar like designs pursue  Fix'd to destroy and stedfast to undo  Wild as his land in native deserts bred  By lust incited or by malice led  The villain Arab as he prowls for prey  Oft marks with blood and wasting flames the way  Yet none so cruel as the Tartar foe  To death inur'd and nurst in scenes of woe  He said when loud along the vale was heard  A shriller shriek and nearer fires appear'd  Th' affrighted shepherds thro' the dews of night  Wide o'er the moonlight hills renew'd their flight  AN ODE TO FEAR  BY THE SAME  THOU to whom the world unknown  With all its shadowy shapes is shewn  Who seest appall'd th' unreal scene  While Fancy lifts the veil between  Ah Fear ah frantic Fear  I see I see thee near  I know thy hurried step thy haggard eye  Like thee I start like thee disorder'd fly  For lo what monsters in thy train appear  Danger whose limbs of giant mold  What mortal eye can fix'd behold  Who stalks his round an hideous form  Howling amidst the midnight storm  Or throws him on the ridgy steep  Of some loose hanging rock to sleep  And with him thousand phantoms join'd  Who prompt to deeds accurs'd the mind  And those the fiends who near allied  O'er Nature's wounds and wrecks preside  While Vengeance in the lurid air  Lifts her red arm expos'd and bare  On whom that ravening Brood of fate  Who lap the blood of Sorrow wait  Who Fear this ghastly train can see  And look not madly wild like thee  EPODE  In earliest Greece to thee with partial choice  The grieffull Muse addrest her infant tongue  The maids and matrons on her awful voice  Silent and pale in wild amazement hung  Yet he the Bard  Aeschylus  who first invok'd thy name  Disdain'd in Marathon its power to feel  For not alone he nurs'd the poet's flame  But reach'd from Virtue's hand the patriot's steel  But who is he whom later garlands grace  Who left a while o'er Hybla's dews to rove  With trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace  Where thou and Furies shar'd the baleful grove  Wrapt in thy cloudy veil th' incestuous Queen  Jocasta  Sigh'd the sad call her son and husband heard  When once alone it broke the silent scene  And he the wretch of Thebes no more appear'd  O Fear I know thee by my throbbing heart  Thy withering power inspir'd each mournful line  Tho' gentle Pity claim her mingled part  Yet all the thunders of the scene are thine  ANTISTROPHE  Thou who such weary lengths hast past  Where wilt thou rest mad Nymph at last  Say wilt thou shroud in haunted cell  Where gloomy Rape and Murder dwell  Or in some hollow'd seat  'Gainst which the big waves beat  Hear drowning seamen's cries in tempests brought  Dark power with shuddering meek submitted thought  Be mine to read the visions old  Which thy awakening bards have told  And lest thou meet my blasted view  Hold each strange tale devoutly true  Ne'er be I found by thee o'eraw'd  In that thricehallow'd eve abroad  When ghosts as cottagemaids believe  Their pebbled beds permitted leave  And goblins haunt from fire or fen  Or mine or flood the walks of men  O thou whose spirit most possest  The sacred seat of Shakespear's breast  By all that from thy prophet broke  In thy divine emotions spoke  Hither again thy fury deal  Teach me but once like him to feel  His cypress wreath my meed decree  And I O Fear will dwell with thee  THE PASSIONS AN ODE FOR MUSIC  BY THE SAME  WHEN Music heavenly maid was young  While yet in early Greece she sung  The Passions oft to hear her shell  Throng'd around her magic cell  Exulting trembling raging fainting  Possest beyond the Muse's painting  By turns they felt the glowing mind  Disturb'd delighted rais'd refin'd  Till once 'tis said when all were fir'd  Fill'd with fury rapt inspir'd  From the supporting myrtles round  They snatch'd her instruments of sound  And as they oft had heard apart  Sweet lessons of her forceful art  Each for madness rul'd the hour  Would prove his own expressive power  First Fear his hand its skill to try  Amid the chords bewilder'd laid  And back recoil'd he knew not why  Even at the sound himself had made  Next Anger rush'd his eyes on fire  In lightnings own'd his secret stings  In one rude clash he struck the lyre  And swept with hurried hand the strings  With woeful measures wan Despair  Low sullen sounds his grief beguil'd  A solemn strange and mingled air  'Twas sad by fits by starts 'twas wild  But thou O Hope with eyes so fair  What was thy delighted measure  Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure  And bad the lovely scenes at distance hail  Still would her touch the strain prolong  And from the rocks the woods the vale  She call'd on Echo still thro' all the song  And where her sweetest theme she chose  A soft responsive voice was heard at every close  And Hope enchanted smil'd and wav'd her golden hair  And longer had she sungbut with a frown  Revenge impatient rose  He threw his bloodstain'd sword in thunder down  And with a withering look  The wardenouncing trumpet took  And blew a blast so loud and dread  Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe  And ever and anon he beat  The doubling drum with furious heat  And tho' sometimes each dreary pause between  Dejected Pity at his side  Her soulsubduing voice applied  Yet still he kept his wild unalter'd mien  While each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his head  Thy numbers Jealousy to nought were fix'd  Sad proof of thy distressful state  Of differing themes the veering song was mix'd  And now it courted Love now raving call'd on Hate  With eyes uprais'd as one inspir'd  Pale Melancholy sat retir'd  And from her wild sequester'd seat  In notes by distance made more sweet  Pour'd thro' the mellow horn her pensive soul  And dashing soft from rocks around  Bubbling runnels join'd the sound  Thro' glades and glooms the mingled measure stole  Or o'er some haunted streams with fond delay  Round an holy calm diffusing  Love of peace and lonely musing  In hollow murmurs died away  But O how alter'd was its sprightlier tone  When Chearfulness a nymph of healthiest hue  Her bow across her shoulder flung  Her buskins gemm'd with morning dew  Blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung  The hunter's call to Faun and Dryad known  The oakcrown'd Sisters and their chasteeyed queen  Satyrs and sylvan boys were seen  Peeping from forth their alleys green  Brown Exercise rejoic'd to hear  And Sport leapt up and seiz'd his beechen spear  Last came Joy's ecstatic trial  He with viny crown advancing  First to the lively pipe his hand addrest  But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol  Whose sweet entrancing voice he lov'd the best  They would have thought who heard the strain  They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids  Amidst the festal sounding shades  To some unwearied minstrel dancing  While as his flying fingers kiss'd the strings  Love fram'd with Mirth a gay fantastic round  Loose were her tresses seen her zone unbound  And he amidst his frolic play  As if he would the charming air repay  Shook thousand odours from his dewy wings  O Music spheredescended maid  Friend of pleasure wisdom's aid  Why Goddess why to us denied  Lay'st thou thy antient lyre aside  As in that lov'd Athenian bower  You learn'd an allcommanding power  Thy mimic soul O nymph endear'd  Can well recall what then it heard  Where is thy native simple heart  Devote to virtue fancy art  Arise as in that elder time  Warm energic chaste sublime  Thy wonders in that godlike age  Fill thy recording Sister's page  'Tis said and I believe the tale  Thy humblest reed could more prevail  Had more of strength diviner rage  Than all which charms this laggard age  Even all at once together found  Caecilia's mingled world of sound  O bid our vain endeavours cease  Revive the just designs of Greece  Return in all thy simple state  Confirm the tales her sons relate  EVERY MAN THE ARCHITECT of his own FORTUNE OR THE ART OF RISING IN THE CHURCH  A SATYRE  By Mr SCOTT of TrinityCollege Cambridge  A DIALOGUE betwixt a POET and his FRIEND  F  GOOD friend forbearthe world will say 'tis spite  Or disappointment goads you thus to write  Some lord hath frown'd some bishop past dispute  At surly distance spurn'd your eager suit  Prefer'd a dull vile clod of noble earth  And left neglected genius wit and worth  P  Regards it me what snarling critics say  'Tis honest indignation points the way  Thanks to my stars my

Sabean sweets and all the gums  The spicy desarts of Arabia yield  I  When the Attic bird complains  From the still attentive grove  Or the linnet breathes his strains  Taught by nature and by love  Do thou approve the dulcet airs  And Harmony's soft silken chain  In willing bondage leads our cares  And binds the giantsense of pain  Untun'd by thee how coarse the longdrawn note  Spun from the lab'ring eunuch's tortur'd throat  Harsh are the sounds tho' FARINELLI sings  Harsh are the sounds tho' HANDEL wakes the strings  Untouch'd by thee see senseless FLORIO sits  And stares and gapes and nods and yawns by fits  II  Oh Pleasure comeand far far hence  Expel that nun Indifference  Where'er she waves her Ebon wand  Drencht in the dull Lethaean deep  Behold the marble passions stand  Absorb'd in everlasting sleep  Then from the waste and barren mind  The muse's fairyphantoms fly  They fly nor leave a wreck behind  Of heav'ndescended poesy  Love's thrilling tumults then are felt no

strung the lyre  Aloft in air the cherubs play'd  What time in Cypria's myrtleshade  Young Adonis slumb'ring lay  On a bed of blushing flow'rs  Call'd to life by early May  And the rosybosom'd hours  The queen of love beheld her darling boy  In am'rous mood she nestled to his side  And thus to melt his frozen breast to joy  Her wanton art she gaylysmiling try'd  II  From the muskrose wet with dew  And the lily's op'ning bell  From fresh eglantine she drew  Sweets of aromatic smell  Part of that honey next she took  Which Cupid too advent'rous stole  When stung his throbbing hand he shook  And felt the anguish to his soul  His mother laught to hear the elf complain  Yet still she pity'd and reliev'd his pain  She drest the wound with balm of sov'reign might  And bath'd him in the well of dear delight  Ah who would fear to be so bath'd in bliss  More agonizing smart and deeper wounds than this  III  Her magic zone she next unbound  And wav'd it in the air around  Then cull'd from everfrolic smiles  That live in Beauty's dimpled cheek  Such sweetness as the heart beguiles  And turns the mighty strong to weak  To these ambrosial dew she join'd  And o'er the flame of warm desire  Fan'd by soft sighs love's gentlest wind  Dissolv'd and made the charm entire  O'er her moist lips that blush'd with heav'nly red  The graces' friendly hand the blest ingredients spread  III  Adonis

dares to tell  She crowns the silent leads the blabbing swain  To doubts desires and fears the fev'rish lover's hell  III  Change then sweetest nymph of nine  Change the song and fraught with pleasures  String anew thy silver twine  To the softest Lydian measures  My Cynthia calls whose natal hour  Th' assistant graces saw and smil'd  Then deign'd his Cyprian charms to pour  With lavish bounty o'er the child  Sithence where'er the siren moves along  In pleasing wonder chain'd is ev'ry tongue  Love's soft suffusion dims the aching eyes  Love's subtlest flame thro' ev'ry art'ry flies  Our trembling limbs th' unequal pulse betray  We gaze in transport lostthen faint and die away  ALBIN and the DAUGHTER of MEY  An old tale translated from the Irish  By the late Mr JEROM STONE  WHence come these dismal sounds that fill our ears  Why do the groves such lamentations send  Why sit the virgins on the hill of tears  While heavy sighs their tender bosoms rend  They weep for ALBIN with the flowing hair  Who perish'd by the cruelty of MEY  A blameless hero blooming young and fair  Because he scorn'd her passion to obey  See on you western hill the heap of stones  Which mourning friends have raised o'er his bones  O woman bloody bloody was thy deed  The blackness of thy crime exceeds belief  The story makes each heart but thine to bleed  And fills both men and maids with keenest grief  Behold thy daughter beauteous as the sky  When early morn transcends yon eastern hills  She lov'd the youth who by thy guile did die  And now our ears with lamentations fills  'Tis she who sad and grov'ling on the ground  Weeps o'er his grave and makes the woods resound  A thousand graces did the maid adorn  Her looks were charming and her heart was kind  Her eyes were like the windows of the morn  And Wisdom's habitation was her mind  A hundred heroes try'd her love to gain  She pity'd them yet did their suits deny  Young ALBIN only courted not in vain  ALBIN alone was lovely in her eye  Love fill'd their bosoms with a mutual flame  Their birth was equal and their age the same  Her mother MEY a woman void of truth  In practice of deceit and guile grown old  Conceiv'd a guilty passion for the youth  And in his ear the shameful story told  But o'er his mind she never could prevail  For in his life no wickedness was found  With shame and rage he heard the horrid tale  And shook with indignation at the sound  He fled to shun her while with burning wrath  The monster in revenge decreed his death  Amidst Lochmey at distance from the shore  On a green island grew a stately tree  With precious fruit each season cover'd o'er  Delightful to the taste and fair to see  This fruit more sweet than virgin honey found  Serv'd both alike for physic and for food  It cur'd diseases heal'd the bleeding wound  And hunger's rage for three long days withstood  But precious things are purchas'd still with pain  And thousands try'd to pluck it but in vain  For at the root of this delightful tree  A venomous and awful dragon lay  With watchful eyes all horrible to see  Who drove th' affrighted passengers away  Worse than the viper's sting its teeth did wound  The wretch who felt it soon behov'd to die  Nor could physician ever yet be found  Who might a certain antidote apply  Ev'n they whose skill had sav'd a mighty host  Against its bite no remedy could boast  Revengeful MEY her fury to appease  And him destroy who durst her passion slight  Feign'd to be stricken with a dire disease  And call'd the hapless ALBIN to her sight  " Arise young hero skill'd in feats of war  On yonder lake your dauntless courage prove  To pull me of the fruit now bravely dare  And save the mother of the maid you love  I die without its influence divine  Nor will I taste it from a hand but thine"  With downcastlook the lovely youth reply'd  " Though yet my feats of valour have been few  My might in this adventure shall be try'd  I go to pull the healing fruit for you"  With stately steps approaching to the deep  The hardy hero swims the liquid tide  With joy he finds the dragon fast asleep  Then pulls the fruit and comes in safety back  Then with a chearful countenance and gay  He gives the present to the hands of MEY  " Well have you done to bring me of this fruit  But greater signs of prowess must you give  Go pull the tree entirely by the root  And bring it hither or I cease to live"  Though hard the task like lightning fast he flew  And nimbly glided o'er the yielding tide  Then to the tree with manly steps he drew  And pull'd and tugg'd it hard from side to side  Its bursting roots his strength could not withstand  He tears it up and bears it in his hand  But long alas ere he could reach the shore  Or fix his footsteps on the solid sand  The monster follow'd with a hideous roar  And like a fury grasp'd him by the hand  Then gracious God what dreadful struggling rose  He grasps the dragon by th' invenom'd jaws  In vain for round the bloody current flows  While its fierce teeth his tender body gnaws  He groans through anguish of the grievous wound  And cries for help but ah no help was found  At length the maid now wond'ring at his stay  And rack'd with dread of some impending ill  Swift to the lake to meet him bends her way  And there beheld what might a virgin kill  She saw her lover struggling on the flood  The dreadful monster gnawing at his side  She saw young ALBIN fainting while his blood  With purple tincture dy'd the liquid tide  Though pale with fear she plunges in the wave  And to the hero's hand a dagger gave  Alas too late yet gath'ring all his force  He drags at last his hissing foe to land  Yet there the battle still grew worse and worse  And long the conflict lasted on the strand  At length he happily descry'd a part  Just where the scaly neck and breast did meet  Through this he drove a welldirected dart  And laid the monster breathless at his feet  The lovers shouted when they saw him dead  While from his trunk they cut the bleeding head  But soon the venom of his mortal bite  Within the hero's bosom spreads like flame  His face grew pale his strength forsook him quite  And o'er his trembling limbs a numbness came  Then fainting on the slimy shore he fell  And utter'd with a heavy dying groan  These tender words "My lovely maid farewel  Remember ALBIN for his life is gone"  These sounds like thunder all her sense oppress'd  And swooning down she fell upon his breast  At last the maid awak'ning as from sleep  Felt all her soul o'erwhelm'd in deep despair  Her eyes star'd wild she rav'd she could not weep  She beat her bosom and she tore her hair  She look'd now on the ground now on the skies  Now gaz'd around like one imploring aid  But none was near in pity to her cries  No comfort came to sooth the hapless maid  Then grasping in her palm that shone like snow  The youth's dead hand she thus express'd her wo  Burst burst my heart the lovely youth is dead  Who like the dawn was wont to bring me joy  Now birds of prey will hover round his head  And wild beasts seek his carcase to destroy  While I who lov'd him and was lov'd again  With sighs and lamentable strains must tell  How by no hero's valour he was slain  But struggling with a beast inglorious fell  This makes my tears with double anguish flow  This adds affliction to my bitter woe  Yet fame and dauntless valour he could boast  With matchless strength his manly limbs were bound  That force would have dismay'd a mighty host  He show'd before the dragon could him wound  His curling locks that wanton'd in the breeze  Were blacker than the raven's ebon wing  His teeth were whiter than the fragrant trees  When blossoms clothe them in the days of spring  A brighter red his glowing cheeks did stain  Than blood of tender heifer newly slain  A purer azure sparkled in his eye  Than that of icy shoal in mountain found  Whene'er he spoke his voice was melody  And sweeter far than instrumental sound  O he was lovely fair as purest snow  Whose wreaths the tops of highest mountains crown  His lips were radiant as the heav'nly bow  His skin was softer than the softest down  More sweet his breath than fragrant bloom or rose  Or gale that cross a flow'ry garden blows  But when in battle with our foes he join'd  And sought the hottest dangers of the fight  The stoutest chiefs stood wond'ring far behind  And none durst try to rival him in might  His ample shield then seem'd a gate of brass  His awful sword did like the lightning shine  No force of steel could through his armour pass  His spear was like a mast or mountainpine  Ev'n kings and heroes trembled at his name  And conquest smil'd where'er the warrior came  Great was the strength of his unconquer'd hand  Great was his swiftness in the rapid race  None could the valour of his arm withstand  None could outstrip him in the days of chace  Yet he was tender merciful and kind  His vanquish'd foes his clemency confess'd  No cruel purpose labour'd in his mind  No thought of envy harbour'd in his breast  He was all gracious bounteous and benign  And in his soul superior to a king  But now he's gone and nought remains but wo  For wretched me with him my joys are fled  Around his tomb my tears shall ever flow  The rock my dwelling and the clay my bed  Ye maids and matrons from your hills descend  To join my moan and answer tear for tear  With me the hero to his grave attend  And sing the songs of mourning round his bier  Through his own grove his praise we will proclaim  And bid the place for ever bear his name  EDWIN AND ANGELINA  A BALLAD  By DR GOLDSMITH  ' TURN gentle hermit of the dale  ' And guide my lonely way  ' To where yon taper cheers the vale  ' With hospitable ray  ' For here forlorn and lost I tread  ' With fainting steps and slow  ' Where wilds immeasurably spread  ' Seem lengthening as I go'  ' Forbear my son' the hermit cries  ' To tempt the dangerous gloom  ' For yonder faithless phantom flies  ' To lure thee to thy doom  ' Here to the houseless child of want  ' My door is open still  ' And tho' my portion is but scant  ' I give it with good will  ' Then turn to night and freely share  ' Whate'er my cell bestows  ' My rushy couch and frugal fare  ' My blessing and repose  ' No flocks that range the valley free  ' To slaughter I condemn  ' Taught by that power that pities me  ' I learn to pity them  ' But from the mountain's grassy side  ' A guiltless feast I bring  ' A scrip with herbs and fruits supply'd  ' And water from the spring  ' Then pilgrim turn thy cares forego  ' All earthborn cares are wrong  ' Man wants but little here below  ' Nor wants that little long'  Soft as the dew from heav'n descends  His gentle accents fell  The modest stranger lowly bends  And follows to the cell  Far in a wilderness obscure  The lonely mansion lay  A refuge to the neighbouring poor  And strangers led astray  No stores beneath its humble thatch  Requir'd a master's care  The wicket opening with a latch  Receiv'd the harmless pair  And now when busy crowds retire  To take their evening rest  The hermit trimm'd his little fire  And cheer'd his pensive guest  And spread his vegetable store  And gayly prest and smil'd  And skill'd in legendary lore  The lingering hours beguil'd  Around in sympathetic mirth  Its tricks the kitten tries  The cricket chirrups in the hearth  The crackling faggot flies  But nothing could a charm impart  To sooth the stranger's woe  For grief was heavy at his heart  And tears began to flow  His rising cares the hermit spy'd  With answering care opprest  ' And whence unhappy youth' he cry'd  ' The sorrows of thy breast  ' From better habitations spurn'd  ' Reluctant dost thou rove  ' Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd  ' Or unregarded love  ' Alas the joys that fortune brings  ' Are trifling and decay  ' And those who prize the paltry things  ' More trifling still than they  ' And what is friendship but a name  ' A charm that lulls to sleep  ' A shade that follows wealth or fame  ' But leaves the wretch to weep  ' And love is still an emptier sound  ' The modern fair one's jest  ' On earth unseen or only found  ' To warm the turtle's nest  ' For shame fond youth thy sorrows hush  ' And spurn the sex' he said  But while he spoke a rising blush  His lovelorn guest betray'd  Surpriz'd he sees new beauties rise  Swift mantling to the view  Like colours o'er the morning skies  As bright as transient too  The bashful look the rising breast  Alternate spread alarms  The lovely stranger stands confest  A maid in all her charms  ' And ah forgive a stranger rude  ' A wretch forlorn' she cry'd  ' Whose feet unhallowed thus intrude  ' Where heaven and you reside  ' But let a maid thy pity share  ' Whom love has taught to stray  ' Who seeks for rest but finds despair  ' Companion of her way  ' My father liv'd beside the Tyne  ' A wealthy lord was he  ' And all his wealth was mark'd as mine  ' He had but only me  ' To win me from his tender arms  ' Unnumber'd suitors came  ' Who prais'd me for imputed charms  ' And felt or feign'd a flame  ' Each hour a mercenary crowd  ' With richest proffers strove  ' Among the rest young Edwin bow'd  ' But never talk'd of love  ' In humble simplest habit clad  ' No wealth nor power had he  ' Wisdom and worth were all he had  ' But these were all to me  ' The blossom opening to the day  ' The dews of heaven refin'd  ' Could nought of purity display  ' To emulate his mind  ' The dew the blossom on the tree  ' With charms inconstant shine  ' Their charms were his but woe to me  ' Their constancy was mine  ' For still I try'd each fickle art  ' Importunate and vain  ' And while his passion touch'd my heart  ' I triumph'd in his pain  ' Till quite dejected with my scorn  ' He left me to my pride  ' And sought a solitude forlorn  ' In secret where he died  ' But mine the sorrow mine the fault  ' And well my life shall pay  ' I'll seek the solitude he sought  ' And stretch me where he lay  ' And there forlorn despairing hid  ' I'll lay me down and die  ' 'Twas so for me that Edwin did  ' And so for him will I'  ' Forbid it heaven' the hermit cry'd  And clasp'd her to his breast  The wondering fair one turn'd to chide  'Twas Edwin's self that prest  ' Turn Angelina ever dear  ' My charmer turn to see  ' Thy own thy long lost Edwin here  ' Restor'd to love and thee  ' Thus let me hold thee to my heart  ' And ev'ry care resign  ' And shall we never never part  ' My lifemy all that's mine  ' No never from this hour to part  ' We'll live and love so true  ' The sigh that rends thy constant heart  ' Shall break thy Edwin's too'  THE CIT's COUNTRYBOX  By ROBERT LLOYD AM  Vos sapere solos aio bene vivere quorum  Conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis  HOR  THE wealthy cit grown old in trade  Now wishes for the rural shade  And buckles to his onehorse chair  Old Dobbin or the founder'd mare  While wedg'd in closely by his side  Sits madam his unweildly bride  With Jacky on a stool before 'em  And out they jog in due decorum  Scarce past the turnpike half a mile  How all the country seems to smile  And as they slowly jog together  The cit commends the road and weather  While madam doats upon the trees  And longs for ev'ry house she sees  Admires its views its situation  And thus she opens her oration  What signify the loads of wealth  Without that richest jewel health  Excuse the fondness of a wife  Who doats upon your precious life  Such easeless toil such constant care  Is more than human strength can bear  One may observe it in your face  Indeed my dear you break apace  And nothing can your health repair  But exercise and country air  Sir Traffic has a house you know  About a mile from CheneyRow  He's a good man indeed 'tis true  But not so warm my dear as you  And folks are always apt to sneer  One would not be outdone my dear  Sir Traffic's name so well apply'd  Awak'd his brother merchant's pride  And Thrifty who had all his life  Paid utmost deference to his wife  Confess'd her arguments had reason  And by th' approaching summer season  Draws a few hundreds from the stocks  And purchases his country box  Some three or four mile out of town  An hour's ride will bring you down  He fixes on his choice abode  Not half a furlong from the road  And so convenient does it lay  The stages pass it ev'ry day  And then so snug so mighty pretty  To have an house so near the city  Take but your places at the Boar  You're set down at the very door  Well then suppose them fix'd at last  Whitewashing painting scrubbing past  Hugging themselves in ease and clover  With all the fuss of moving over  Lo a new heap of whims are bred  And wanton in my lady's head  Well to be sure it must be own'd  It is a charming spot of ground  So sweet a distance for a ride  And all about so countrified  'Twould come to but a trifling price  To make it quite a paradise  I cannot bear those nasty rails  Those ugly broken mouldy pales  Suppose my dear instead of these  We build a railing all Chinese  Although one hates to be expos'd  'Tis dismal to be thus inclos'd  One hardly any object sees  I wish you'd fell those odious trees  Objects continual passing by  Were something to amuse the eye  But to be pent within the walls  One might as well be at St Paul's  Our house beholders would adore  Was there a level lawn before  Nothing its views to incommode  But quite laid open to the road  While ev'ry trav'ler in amaze  Should on our little mansion gaze  And pointing to the choice retreat  Cry that's Sir Thrifty's country seat  No doubt her arguments prevail  For madam's TASTE can never fail  Blest age when all men may procure  The title of a connoisseur  When noble and ignoble herd  Are govern'd by a single word  Though like the royal German dames  It bears an hundred Christian names  As Genius Fancy Judgment Goût  Whim Caprice Jene scaiquoi Virtù  Which appellations all describe  TASTE and the modern tasteful tribe  Now bricklay'rs carpenters and joiners  With Chinese artists and designers  Produce their schemes of alteration  To work this wond'rous reformation  The useful dome which secret stood  Embosom'd in the yewtree's wood  The trav'ler with amazement sees  A temple Gothic or Chinese  With many a bell and tawdry rag on  And crested with a sprawling dragon  A wooden arch is bent astride  A ditch of water four foot wide  With angles curves and zigzag lines  From Halfpenny's exact designs  In front a level lawn is seen  Without a shrub upon the green  Where Taste would want its first great law  But for the skulking sly haha  By whose miraculous assistance  You gain a prospect two fields distance  And now from HydePark Corner come  The gods of Athens and of Rome  Here squabby Cupids take their places  With Venus and the clumsy graces  Apollo there with aim so clever  Stretches his leaden bow for ever  And there without the pow'r to fly  Stands fix'd a tiptoe Mercury  The villa thus completely grac'd  All own that Thrifty has a taste  And madam's female friends and cousins  With commoncouncilmen by dozens  Flock ev'ry Sunday to the feat  To stare about them and to eat  THE ACTOR  ADDRESSED TO BONNELL THORNTON  Esq  BY THE SAME  ACTING dear Thornton its perfection draws  From no observance of mechanic laws  No settled maxims of a fav'rite stage  No rules deliver'd down from age to age  Let players nicely mark them as they will  Can e'er entail hereditary skill  If 'mongst the humble hearers of the pit  Some curious vet'ran critic chance to sit  Is he pleas'd more because 'twas acted so  By Booth and Cibber thirty years ago  The mind recals an object held more dear  And hates the copy that it comes so near  Why lov'd we Wilks's air Booth's nervous tone  In them 'twas natural 'twas all their own  A Garrick's genius must our wonder raise  But gives his mimic no reflected praise  Thrice happy Genius whose unrival'd name  Shall live for ever in the voice of Fame  'Tis thine to lead with more than magic skill  The train of captive passions at thy will  To bid the bursting tear spontaneous flow  In the sweet sense of sympathetic woe  Through ev'ry vein I feel a chilness creep  When horrors such as thine have murder'd sleep  And at the old man's look and frantic stare  'Tis Lear alarms me for I see him there  Nor yet confin'd to tragic walks alone  The comic muse too claims thee for her own  With each delightful requisite to please  Taste spirit judgment elegance and ease  Familiar nature forms thy only rule  From Ranger's rake to Drugger's vacant fool  With powers so pliant and so various blest  That what we see the last we like the best  Not idly pleas'd at judgment's dear expence  But burst outrageous with the laugh of sense  Perfection's top with weary toil and pain  'Tis genius only that can hope to gain  The play'r's profession tho' I hate the phrase  'Tis so mechanie in these modern days  Lies not in trick or attitude or start  Nature's true knowledge is his only art  The strongfelt passion bolts into the face  The mind untouch'd what is it but grimace  To this one standard make your just appeal  Here lies the golden secret learn to FEEL  Or fool or monarch happy or distrest  No actor pleases that is not possess'd  Once on the stage in Rome's declining days  When Christians were the subject of their plays  E'er persecution dropp'd her iron rod  And men still wag'd an impious war with God  An actor flourish'd of no vulgar fame  Nature's disciple and Genest his name  A noble object for his skill he chose  A martyr dying 'midst insulting foes  Resign'd with patience to religion's laws  Yet braving monarchs in his Saviour's cause  Fill'd with th' idea of the secret part  He felt a zeal beyond the reach of art  While look and voice and gesture all exprest  A kindred ardour in the player's breast  Till as the flame thro' all his bosom ran  He lost the actor and commenc'd the man  Profest the faith his pagan gods denied  And what he acted then he after died  The player's province they but vainly try  Who want these pow'rs deportment voice and eye  The critic sight 'tis only grace can please  No figure charms us if it has not ease  There are who think the stature all in all  Nor like the hero if he is not tall  The feeling sense all other want supplies  I rate no actor's merit from his size  Superior height requires superior grace  And what's a giant with a vacant face  Theatric monarchs in their tragic gait  Affect to mark the solemn pace of state  One foot put forward in position strong  The other like its vassal dragg'd along  So grave each motion so exact and slow  Like wooden monarchs at a puppetshow  The mien delights us that has native grace  But affectation ill supplies its place  Unskilful actors like your mimic apes  Will writhe their bodies in a thousand shapes  However foreign from the poet's art  No tragic hero but admires a start  What though unfeeling of the nervous line  Who but allows his attitude is fine  While a whole minute equipois'd he stands  Till praise dismiss him with her echoing hands  Resolv'd though nature hate the tedious pause  By perseverance to extort applause  When Romeo sorrowing at his Juliet's doom  With eager madness bursts the canvas tomb  The sudden whirl stretch'd leg and lifted staff  Which please the vulgar make the critic laugh  To paint the passion's force and mark it well  The proper action nature's self will tell  No pleasing pow'rs distortions e'er express  And nicer judgment always loaths excess  In sock or buskin who o'erleaps the bounds  Disgusts our reason and the taste confounds  Of all the evils which the stage molest  I hate your fool who overacts his jest  Who murders what the poet finely writ  And like a bungler haggles all his wit  With shrug and grin and gesture out of place  And writes a foolish comment with his face  Old Johnson once tho' Cibber's perter vein  But meanly groupes him with a num'rous train  With steady face and sober hum'rous mien  Fill'd the strong outlines of the comic scene  What was writ down with decent utt'rance spoke  Betray'd no symptom of the conscious joke  The very man in look in voice in air  And tho' upon the stage appear'd no play'r  The word and action should conjointly suit  But acting words is labour too minute  Grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong  While sober humour marks th' impression strong  Her proper traits the fixt attention hit  And bring me closer to the poet's wit  With her delighted o'er each scene I go  Wellpleas'd and not asham'd of being so  But let the generous actor still forbear  To copy features with a mimic's care  'Tis a poor skill which ev'ry fool can reach  A vile stagecustom honour'd in the breach  Worse as more close the disingenuous art  But shews the wanton looseness of the heart  When I behold a wretch of talents mean  Drag private foibles on the public scene  Forsaking nature's fair and open road  To mark some whim some strange peculiar mode  Fir'd with disgust I loath his servile plan  Despise the mimic and abhor the man  Go to the lame to hospitals repair  And hunt for humour in distortions there  Fill up the measure of the motley whim  With shrug wink snuffle and convulsive limb  Then shame at once to please a trifling age  Good sense good manners virtue and the stage  'Tis not enough the voice be sound and clear  'Tis modulation that must charm the ear  When desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan  And whine their sorrows in a seesaw tone  The same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes  Can only make the yawning hearers doze  The voice all modes of passion can express  That marks the proper word with proper stress  But none emphatic can that actor call  Who lays an equal emphasis on all  Some o'er the tongue the labour'd measures roll  Slow and delib'rate as the parting toll  Point ev'ry stop mark ev'ry pause so strong  Their words like stageprocessions stalk along  All affectation but creates disgust  And e'en in speaking we may seem too just  Nor proper Thornton can those sounds appear  Which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear  In vain for them the pleasing measure flows  Whose recitation runs it all to prose  Repeating what the poet sets not down  The verb disjointing from its friendly noun  While pause and break and repetition join  To make a discord in each tuneful line  Some placid natures fill th' allotted scene  With lifeless drone insipid and serene  While others thunder ev'ry couplet o'er  And almost crack your ears with rant and roar  More nature oft and finer strokes are shown  In the low whisper than tempestuous tone  And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixt amaze  More powerful terror to the mind conveys  Than he who swol'n with big impetuous rage  Bullies the bulky phantom off the stage  He who in earnest studies o'er his part  Will find true nature cling about his heart  The modes of grief are not included all  In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl  A single look more marks th' internal woe  Than all the windings of the lengthen'd oh  Up to the face the quick sensation flies  And darts its meaning from the speaking eyes  Love transport madness anger scorn despair  And all the passions all the soul is there  In vain Ophelia gives her flowrets round  And with her straws fantastic strews the ground  In vain now sings now heaves the desp'rate sigh  If phrenzy sit not in the troubled eye  In Cibber's look commanding sorrows speak  And call the tear fast trickling down my cheek  There is a fault which stirs the critic's rage  A want of due attention on the stage  I have seen actors and admir'd ones too  Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue  In their own speech who whine or roar away  Yet seem unmov'd at what the rest may say  Whose eyes and thoughts on diff'rent objects roam  Until the prompter's voice recal them home  Divest yourself of hearers if you can  And strive to speak and be the very man  Why should the wellbred actor wish to know  Who fits above tonight or who below  So 'mid th' harmonious tones of grief or rage  Italian squallers oft disgrace the stage  When with a simp'ring leer and bow profound  The squeaking Cyrus greets the boxes round  Or proud Mandane of imperial race  Familiar drops a curt'sie to her grace  To suit the dress demands the actor's art  Yet there are those who overdress the part  To some prescriptive right gives settled things  Black wigs to murd'rers feather'd hats to kings  But Michael Cassio might be drunk enough  Tho' all his features were not grim'd with snuff  Why shou'd Pol Peachum shine in satin cloaths  Why ev'ry devil dance in scarlet hose  But in stagecustoms what offends me most  Is the slipdoor and slowlyrising ghost  Tell me nor count the question too severe  Why need the dismal powder'd forms appear  When chilling horrors shake th' affrighted king  And guilt torments him with her scorpion sting  When keenest feelings at his bosom pull  And fancy tells him that the seat is full  Why need the ghost usurp the monarch's place  To frighten children with his mealy face  The king alone shou'd form the phantom there  And talk and tremble at the vacant chair  If Belvidera her lov'd loss deplore  Why for twin spectres bursts the yawning floor  When with disorder'd starts and horrid cries  She paints the murder'd forms before her eyes  And still pursues them with a frantic stare  'Tis pregnant madness brings the visions there  More instant horror would enforce the scene  If all her shudd'rings were at shapes unseen  Poet and actor thus with blended skill  Mould all our passions to their instant will  'Tis thus when feeling Garrick treads the stage  The speaking comment of his Shakespear's page  Oft as I drink the words with greedy ears  I shake with horror or dissolve with tears  O ne'er may folly seize the throne of taste  Nor dulness lay the realms of genius waste  No bouncing crackers ape the thund'rer's fire  No tumbler float upon the bending wire  More natural uses to the stage belong  Than tumblers monsters pantomime or song  For other purpose was that spot design'd  To purge the passions and reform the mind  To give to nature all the force of art  And while it charms the ear to mend the heart  Thornton to thee I dare with truth commend  The decent stage as virtue's natural friend  Tho' oft debas'd with scenes profane and loose  No reason weighs against it's proper use  Tho' the lewd priest his sacred function shame  Religion's perfect law is still the same  Shall they who trace the passions from their rise  Shew scorn her features her own image vice  Who teach the mind it's proper force to scan  And hold the faithful mirror up to man  Shall their profession e'er provoke disdain  Who stand the foremost in the mortal train  Who lend reflection all the grace of art  And strike the precept home upon the heart  Yet hapless artist tho' thy skill can raise  The bursting peal of universal praise  Tho' at thy beck applause delighted stands  And lifts Briareus' like her hundred hands  Know fame awards thee but a partial breath  Not all thy talents brave the stroke of death  Poets to ages yet unborn appeal  And latest times th' eternal nature feel  Tho' blended here the praise of bard and play'r  While more than half becomes the actor's share  Relentless death untwists the mingled fame  And sinks the player in the poet's name  The pliant muscles of the various face  The mien that gave each sentence strength and grace  The tuneful voice the eye that spoke the mind  Are gone nor leave a single trace behind  WILLIAM AND MARGARET  By DAVID MALLET  Esq  I  'TWAS at the silent solemn hour  When night and morning meet  In glided MARGARET's grimly ghost  And stood at WILLIAM's feet  II  Her face was like an Aprilmorn  Clad in a wintry cloud  And claycold was her lillyhand  That held her sable shroud  III  So shall the fairest face appear  When youth and years are flown  Such is the robe that kings must wear  When death has rest their crown  IV  Her bloom was like the springing flower  That sips the silver dew  The rose was budded in her cheek  Just opening to the view  V  But love had like the cankerworm  Consum'd her early prime  The rose grew pale and left her cheek  She dy'd before her time  VI  Awake she cry'd thy true love calls  Come from her midnightgrave  Now let thy pity hear the maid  Thy love refus'd to save  VII  This is the dumb and dreary hour  When injur'd ghosts complain  When yawning graves give up their dead  To haunt the faithless swain  VIII  Bethink thee WILLIAM of thy fault  Thy pledge and broken oath  And give me back my maidenvow  And give me back my troth  IX  Why did you promise love to me  And not that promise keep  Why did you swear my eyes were bright  Yet leave those eyes to weep  X  How could you say my face was fair  And yet that face forsake  How could you win my virgin heart  Yet leave that heart to break  XI  Why did you say my lip my sweet  And made the scarlet pale  And why did I young witless maid  Believe the flattering tale  XII  That face alas no more is fair  Those lips no longer red  Dark are my eyes now clos'd in death  And every charm is fled  XIII  The hungry worm my sister is  This winding sheet I wear  And cold and weary lasts our night  Till that last morn appear  XIV  But hark the cock has warn'd me hence  A long and late adieu  Come see false man how low she lies  Who dy'd for love of you  XV  The lark sung loud the morning smil'd  With beams of rosy red  Pale WILLIAM quak'd in every limb  And raving left his bed  XVI  He hy'd him to the fatal place  Where MARGARET's body lay  And stretch'd him on the grassgreen turf  That wrap'd her breathless clay  XVII  And thrice he call'd on MARGARET's name  And thrice he wept full sore  Then laid his cheek to her cold grave  And word spoke never more  NB  In a comedy of FLETCHER called  The Knight of the burning Pefile  old MERRY THOUGHT enters repeating the following verses  When it was grown to dark midnight  And all were fast asleep  In came MARGARET's grimly ghost  And stood at WILLIAM's feet  This was probably the beginning of some ballad commonly known at the time when that author wrote and is all of it I believe that is any where to be met with These lines naked of ornament and simple as they are struck my fancy and bringing fresh into my mind an unhappy adventure much talked of formerly gave birth to the foregoing poem which was written many years ago  A FRAGMENT  BY THE SAME  FAIR morn ascends soft zephir's wing  O'er hill and vale renews the spring  Where sown profusely herb and flower  Of balmy smell of healing power  Their souls in fragrant dews exhale  And breathe fresh life in every gale  Here spreads a green expanse of plains  Where sweetlypensive Silence reigns  And there at utmost stretch of eye  A mountain fades into the sky  While winding round diffus'd and deep  A river rowls with sounding sweep  Of human art no traces near  I seem alone with Nature here  Here are thy walks O sacred HEALTH  The monarch's bliss the beggar's wealth  The seasoning of all good below  The sovereign friend in joy or woe  O thou most courted most despis'd  And but in absence duly priz'd  Power of the soft and rosy face  The vivid pulse the vermil grace  The spirits when they gayest shine  Youth beauty pleasure all are thine  O sun of life whose heavenly ray  Lights up and chears our various day  The turbulence of hopes and fears  The storm of fate the cloud of years  Till Nature with thy parting light  Reposes late in Death's calm night  Fled from the trophy'd roofs of state  Abodes of splendid pain and hate  Fled from the couch where in sweet sleep  Hot Riot would his anguish steep  But tosses thro' the midnightshade  Of death of life alike afraid  For ever fled to shady cell  Where Temperance where the muses dwell  Thou oft art seen at early dawn  Slowpacing o'er the breezy lawn  Or on the brow of mountain high  In silence feasting ear and eye  With song and prospect which abound  From birds and woods and waters round  But when the sun with noontide ray  Flames forth intolerable day  While Heat sits fervent on the plain  With Thirst and Languor in his train  All nature sickening in the blaze  Thou in the wild and woody maze  That clouds the vale with umbrage deep  Impendent from the neighbouring steep  Wilt find betimes a calm retreat  Where breathing Coolness has her seat  There plung'd amid the shadows brown  Imagination lays him down  Attentive in his airy mood  To every murmur of the wood  The bee in yonder flowery nook  The chidings of the headlong brook  The green leaf shivering in the gale  The warbling hill the lowing vale  The distant woodman's echoing stroke  The thunder of the falling oak  From thought to thought in vision led  He holds high converse with the dead  Sages or Poets See they rise  And shadowy skim before his eyes  Hark ORPHEUS strikes the lyre again  That soften'd savages to men  Lo SOCRATES the sent of heaven  To whom it's moral will was given  Fathers and friends of human kind  They form'd the nations or refin'd  With all that mends the head and heart  Enlightening truth adorning art  While thus I mus'd beneath the shade  At once the sounding breeze was laid

with the innocence of love  Like the old age  SHAKES TWELFTH NIGHT  I  FAR in the windings of a vale  Fast by a sheltering wood  The safe retreat of health and peace  An humble cottage stood  II  There beauteous EMMA flourish'd fair  Beneath a mother's eye  Whose only wish on earth was now  To see her blest and die  III  The softest blush that Nature spreads  Gave colour to her cheek  Such orient colour smiles thro' heaven  When vernal mornings break  IV  Nor let the pride of great ones scorn  This charmer of the plains  That sun who bids their diamond blaze  To paint our lilly deigns  V  Long had she fill'd each youth with love  Each maiden with despair  And tho' by all a wonder own'd  Yet knew not she was fair  VI  Till EDWIN came the pride of swains  A soul devoid of art  And from whose eye serenely mild  Shone forth the feeling heart  VII  A mutual flame was quickly caught  Was quickly too reveal'd  For neither bosom lodg'd a wish  That virtue keeps conceal'd  VIII  What happy hours of homefelt bliss  Did love on both bestow  But bliss too mighty long to last  Where fortune proves a foe  IX  His sister who like ENVY form'd  Like her in mischief joy'd  To work them harm with wicked skill  Each darker art employ'd  X  The father too a sordid man  Who love nor pity knew  Was allunfeeling as the clod  From whence his riches grew  XI  Long had he seen their secret flame  And seen it long unmov'd  Then with a father's frown at last  Had sternly disapprov'd  XII  In EDWIN's gentle heart a war  Of differing passions strove  His heart that durst not disobey  Yet could not cease to love  XIII  Deny'd her sight he oft behind  The spreading hawthorn crept  To snatch a glance to mark the spot  Where EMMA walk'd and wept  XIV  Oft too on STANEMORE's wintry waste  Beneath the moonlightshade  In sighs to pour his soften'd soul  The midnightmourner stray'd  XV  His cheek where health with beauty glow'd  A deadly pale o'ercast  So fades the fresh rose in its prime  Before the northern blast  XVI  The parents now with late remorse  Hung o'er his dying bed  And weary'd heaven with fruitless vows  And fruitless sorrow shed  XVII  'Tis past he cry'dbut if your souls  Sweet mercy yet can move  Let these dim eyes once more behold  What they must ever love  XVIII  She came his cold hand softly touch'd  And bath'd with many a tear  Fastfalling o'er the primrose pale  So morning dews appear  XIX  But oh his sister's jealous care  A cruel sister she  Forbade what EMMA came to say  " My EDWIN live for me"  XX  Now homeward as she hopeless wept  The churchyard path along  The blast blew cold the dark owl scream'd  Her lover's funeral song  XXI  Amid the falling gloom of night  Her startling fancy found  In every bush his hovering shade  His groan in every sound  XXII  Alone appall'd thus had she pass'd  The visionary vale  When lo the deathbell smote her ear  Sadsounding in the gale  XXIII  Just then she reach'd with trembling step  Her aged mother's door  He's gone she cry'd and I shall see  That angelface no more  XXIV  I feel I feel this breaking heart  Beat high against my side  From her white arm down sunk her head  She shivering sigh'd and died  A PRAYER FOR INDIFFERENCE  By MRS GREVILLE  OFT I've implor'd the Gods in vain  And pray'd till I've been weary  For once I'll try my wish to gain  Of Oberon the fairy  Sweet airy being wanton sprite  That lurk'st in woods unseen  And oft by Cynthia's silver light  Tripst gaily o'er the green  If e'er thy pitying heart was mov'd  As ancient stories tell  And for th' Athenian maid who lov'd  Thou sought'st a wondrous spell  Oh deign once more t' exert thy power  Haply some herb or tree  Sov'reign as juice of western flower  Conceals a balm for me  I ask no kind return of love  No tempting charm to please  Far from the heart those gifts remove  That sighs for peace and ease  Nor peace nor ease the heart can know  Which like the needle true  Turns at the touch of joy or woe  But turning trembles too  Far as distress the soul can wound  'Tis pain in each degree  'Tis bliss but to a certain bound  Beyond is agony  Take then this treacherous sense of mine  Which dooms me still to smart  Which pleasure can to pain refine  To pain new pangs impart  Oh haste to shed the sacred balm  My shatter'd nerves newstring  And for my guest serenely calm  The nymph Indifference bring  At her approach see Hope see Fear  See Expectation fly  And Disappointment in the rear  That blasts the promis'd joy  The tear which pity taught to flow  The eye shall then disown  The heart that melts for other's woe  Shall then scarce feel its own  The wounds which now each moment bleed  Each moment then shall close  And tranquil days shall still succeed  To nights of calm repose  O fairy elf but grant me this  This one kind comfort send  And so may neverfading bliss  Thy flow'ry paths attend  So may the glowworm's glimm'ring light  Thy tiny footsteps lead  To some new region of delight  Unknown to mortal tread  And be thy acorn goblet fill'd  With heav'ns ambrosial dew  From sweetest freshest flow'rs distill'd  That shed fresh sweets for you  And what of life remains for me  I'll pass in sober ease  Halfpleas'd contented will I be  Content but half to please  ODE on the Duke of YORK's second Departure from England as REAR ADMIRAL  By the Author of the SHIPWRECK  AGAIN the royal streamers play  To glory Edward hastes away  Adieu ye happy sylvan bowers  Where Pleasure's sprightly throng await  Ye domes where regal grandeur towers  In purple ornaments of state  Ye scenes where virtue's sacred strain  Bids the tragic Muse complain  Where Satire treads the comic stage  To scourge and mend a venal age  Where Music pours the soft melodious lay  And melting symphonies congenial play  Ye silken sons of ease who dwell  In flowery vales of peace farewel  In vain the Goddess of the myrtle grove  Her charms ineffable displays  In vain she calls to happier realms of love  Which Spring's unfading bloom arrays  In vain her living roses blow  And eververnal pleasures grow  The gentle sports of youth no more  Allure him to the peaceful shore  Arcadian ease no longer charms  For war and fame alone can please  His glowing bosom beats to arms  To war the hero moves thro' storms and wint'ry seas  Tho' danger's hostile train appears  To thwart the course that honor steers  Despising peril and dismay  Our royal sailor hastes away  His country calls to guard her laws  Lo ev'ry joy the gallant youth resigns  Th' avenging naval sword he draws  And o'er the waves conducts her martial lines  Hark his sprightly clarions play  Follow where he leads the way  The shrillton'd fife the thundering drum  Tell the deeps their master's come  Thus Alcmena's warlike son  The thorny course of virtue run  When taught by her unerring voice  He made the glorious choice  Severe indeed th' attempt he knew  Youth's genial ardors to subdue  For Pleasure Cytherea's form assum'd  Her glowing charms divinely bright  In all the pride of beauty bloom'd  And struck his ravish'd sight  Transfix'd amaz'd  Alcides gaz'd  O'er every angelgrace  Of that alllovely face  While deepening blushes soon confest  The alternate passions in his breast  Her lips of coral hue  Young Spring embalm'd with nectardew  That swelling bosom halfreveal'd  Those eyes that sparkle heavenly light  His breast with tender tumults fill'd  And wak'd his soul to soft delight  Her limbs that amorous silks enfold  Were cast in nature's finest mould  Persuasion's sweetest language hung  In melting accents on her tongue  Deep in his heart th' inchanting tale  Imprest her pleasing power  She points along the daisied vale  And shews th' Elysian bower  Her hand that trembling ardors move  Conducts him blushing to the blest alcove  That sweet recess of dying love  Ah see o'erpower'd by beauty's arms  And won by love's resistless charms  The captive youth obeys the strong alarms  And will no guardian power above  From ruin save the son of Jove  Ah shall that soft delicious chain  The godlike victim thus enslave  Kind heaven his sinking soul sustain  And from perdition snatch the brave  By heavenly mandate Virtue came  To wake the slumbering sparks of fame  To kindle and arouse the dying flame  Swift as the quivering needle wheels  Whose point the magnet's influence feels  Imprest with filial awe  The wondering hero saw  Her form transcendent shine  With majesty divine  And while he view'd the holy maid  His heart a sacred impulse sway'd  His eyes with eager tumult roll  As on each rivalnymph they bend  Whilst love regret and hope divide his soul  By turns and with conflicting anguish rend  But soon he felt fair Virtue's voice compose  The painful struggle of intestine woes  He felt her balm each pang destroy  And all the numbers of his heart  Retun'd by her celestial art  Now swell'd to strains of nobler joy  Thus tutor'd by her magic lore  His happy steps the realms explore  Where guilt and error are no more  The clouds that veil'd his intellectual ray  Before her breath dispelling melt away  Broke loose from Pleasure's glittering chain  He scorn'd the soft inglorious reign  Convinc'd resolv'd to Virtue then he turn'd  And in his breast paternal glory burn'd  So when on Britain's other hope she shone  Like him the royal youth she won  Thus taught he flies the peaceful shore  And bids our warlike fleet advance  The hostile squadrons to explore  To curb the powers of Spain and France  Alost his martial ensigns flow  And hark his brazen trumpets blow  The watry profound  Awak'd by the sound  All trembles around  While Edward o'er the azure fields  Fraternal thunder wields  High on the deck behold he stands  And views around his floating bands  In awful order join  They while the warlike trumpet's strain  Deepsounding swells along the main  Extend th' embattled line  Now with shouting peals of joy  The ships their horrid tubes display  Tier over tier in terrible array  And wait the signal to destroy  The sailors all burn to engage  Hark hark their shouts arise  And shake the vaulted skies  Exulting with Bacchanal rage  While Britain in thunder array'd  Her standard of battle display'd  Then Neptune that standard revere  Whose power is superior to thine  And when her proud squadrons appear  The trident and chariot risign  Albion wake thy grateful voice  Let thy hills and vales rejoice  O'er remotest hostile regions  Thy victorious flags are known  Thy resistless martial legions  Dreadful stride from zone to zone  Thy flaming bolts unerring roll  And all the trembling globe controul  Thy seamen invincibly true  No menace no fraud can subdue  All dissonant strife they disclaim  And only are rivals in fame  For Edward tune your harps ye Nine  Triumphant strike each living string  For him in extacy divine  Your choral Io Paeans sing  For him your festal concerts breathe  For him your flowery garlands wreathe  Wake O wake the joyful song  Ye Fauns of the woods  Ye Nymphs of the floods  The musical current prolong  Ye Sylvans that dance on the plain  To swell the grand chorus accord  Ye Tritons that sport on the main  Exulting acknowledge your Lord  Till all the wild numbers combin'd  That floating proclaim  Our admiral's name  In symphony roll on the wind  O while consenting Britons praise  These votive measures deign to hear  For thee the Muse awakes her artless lays  For thee her harp spontaneous plays  The tribute of a soul sincere  Nor thou illustrious chief refuse  The incense of a naval Muse  No happy son of wealth or fame  To court a royal patron came  A hapless youth whose vital page  Was one sad lengthen'd tale of woe  Where ruthless fate impelling tides of rage  Bade wave on wave in dire succession flow  To glittering stars and titled names unknown  Prefer'd his suit to thee alone  The tragic tale your pity mov'd  You felt consented and approv'd  Then touch my strings ye blest Pierian quire  Exalt to rapture every happy line  My bosom kindle with Promethean fire  And swell each note with energy divine  No more to plaintive sounds of woe  Let the vocal numbers flow  But tune to war the nervous strain  Where Horror strides triumphant o'er the main  Where the fell lightning of the battle pours  Along the blasted wave in flaming showers  Perhaps some future patriotlay  With this important theme may glow  Where Albion's squadrons crowd in black array  To roll her thunders on th' insulting foe  My bosom feels the strong alarms  My swelling pulses beat to arms  While warm'd to life by Fancy's genial ray  Some great event seems kindling into day  But Time the veil of silence draws between  While Thought behind portrays th' ideal scene  To SICKNESS AN

thy tremendous power  Ah must the transient tenant of a day  Bear the rough blast of each tempestuous hour  Say shall the terrors thy pale flag unfolds  Too rigid queen unnerve the soul's bright

lifted 'bove th' unletter'd throng  Read the few books the learned few compose  And suffer when thy aweful pleasure calls  The soul to share her frail companion's smart  Yet suffer me to taste the

Thy hand shall lead me to thy sober train  Who here retir'd with pensive pleasure tread  The silent windings of thy dark domain  Hither the cherub Charity shall fly  From her bright orb and brooding

emptiness  Reas'nings which no facts produce  Eloquence that murders use  Illtim'd Humour that beguiles  Weeping idiots of their smiles  Wit that knows but to defame  And Satire that profanes the name

the Sambre meets the Maese  Or Danube rolls her watry train  Or the yellowtressed Mayne  Thro' Dettingen's immortal vale  Even Fontenoy could tell a tale  Might modest worth ingenuous speak  To raise

AND VINE  A FABLE  Inscribed to a LADY who expressed a great aversion to MARRIAGE  IN Aesop's days when trees cou'd speak  And talk in Hebrew Latin Greek  An elm and vine by chance near neighbours  Tho' separate each pursu'd their labours  The vine with native sweetness fraught  For man prepar'd the chearing draught  Her tendrils curl'd along the plain  And ruddy clusters swell'd amain  The tow'ring elm could little boast  But leavesa barren shade at most  Save when by woodman's sturdy stroke  Cut down to make a chair or spoke  Yet tho' but small his claim to merit  Not wholly void of sense or spirit  His neighbour's worth he view'd with smiles  And long'd to share her useful toils  For "O said he were we but one  " Sure bliss would enter here alone  " For I by you encircled high  " Should scorn the oak's proud majesty  " While your rich fruit time might mature  " From storms and savage beasts secure  " Our mutual help would soothe our care  " And heav'n approve the happy pair"  " Forbear sir elm the vine reply'd  " Nor wonder if your suit's deny'd  " Shall I give up my independence  " On your caprice to dance attendance  " Must I or nod or bend or twine  " Just as your worship shall incline  " Or shall my charms which all admire  " Become a barren tree's attire  " Noseek more suitable alliance  " I to all danger bid defiance  " Here unconfin'd I range my fill  " And bounteous nature waits my will"  At this the modest elm struck mute  Forbore to urge his friendly suit  But sorely griev'd to meet disdain  A tender sigh express'd his pain  When lo thick darkness veils the pole  Dread lightnings flash loud thunders roll  Impetuous rains in floods descend  And trembling nature fears an end  The vine faint spiritless forlorn  Now seeks the succour late her scorn  Creeps feebly to the elm's embrace  And in his arms finds sweet solace  United thus they storms defy  And mutual grace and aid supply  PROLOGUE TO THE ENGLISHMAN AT BOURDEAUX  Performed since the conclusion of the peace with universal applause at PARIS  TOO long by some fatality misled  From pride resulting or from folly bred  Each clime to all the virtues lays a claim  And soars selfflatter'd to the top of fame  Confines each merit to itself alone  Or thinks no other equal to its own  E'en the pale Russian shiv'ring as he lies  Beneath the horror of his bitterest skies  While the loud tempest rattles o'er his head  Or bursts all dreadful on his tott'ring shed  Hugs a soft something closely to his soul  That soothes the cutting sharpness of the pole  Elates his bosom with a conscious pride  And smiles contempt on all the world beside  'Tis your's O France the earliest to unbind  This more than Gordian manacle of mind  Tonight we bid your justice may be shewn  To foreign virtues equal with your own  Think nobly think when nature first was born  And fair creation kindled into morn  The world was but one family one band  Which glow'd all grateful to the heavenly hand  Thro' ev'ry breast a social impulse ran  Link'd beast to beast and fasten'd man to man  And the sole diff'rence which he heard or had  Dwelt in the simple phrases "good or bad"  Then scorn to give such partial feelings birth  As claim but one poor competence of earth  Be more than French on ev'ry country call  And rise exalted citizens of all  EPILOGUE  THE anxious struggle happily o'erpast  And ev'ry party satisfy'd at last  It now remains to make one short essay  And urge the moral lesson in the play  In arts long since has Britain been renown'd  In arms high honour'd and in letters crown'd  The same great goddess who so nobly sung  In Shakespear's strains and honey'd o'er his tongue  Their deathless Marlbro' to the triumph led  And wreath'd eternal laurels round his head  Yet tho' the trump of neverdying fame  Strikes heav'n's high arches with the British name  Tho' on the sands of Africa it glows  Or casts a daylight on the Zemblian snows  Still there are faults in Britain to be found  Which spring as freely as in common ground  We are too gaythey frequently too sad  We run stark wildthey melancholy mad  Extremes of either reason will condemn  Nor join with us nor vindicate with them  The human genius like revolving suns  An equal circuit in the bosom runs  And thro' the various climates where 'tis plac'd  Must strike out new diversities of taste  To one grand point eternally it leans  Howe'er it warps or differs in the means  Hence on no nation let us turn our eyes  And idly raise it spotless to the skies  Nor still more idly let our censures fall  Since knaves and madmen may be found in all  Here then we rest nor further can contend  For since the best will find some fault to mend  Let us where'er the virtues shed their fire  With fervor reverence and with zeal admire  Exert our care the gath'ring blaze to trace  And mark the progress only not the place  Confess alike the peasant's and the king's  Nor once consider in what soil it springs  AN ODE ON ST CAECILIA'S DAY  Adapted to the antient British music viz the saltbox the Jew's harp the marrowbones and cleavers the humstrum or hurdygurdy c as it was performed on June at

matchless strains Caecilia knew  When audience from their heav'nly sphere  By harmony's strong pow'r she drew  Whilst list'ning angels gladly stoop'd to hear  ADVICE to the Marquis of ROCKINGHAM upon a late Occasion  Written in by an OLD COURTIER  WELL may they Wentworth call thee young  What hear and feel sift right from wrong  And to a wretch be kind  Old statesmen would reverse your plan  Sink in the minister the man  And be both deaf and blind  If thus my lord your heart o'erflows  Know you how many mighty foes  Such weakness will create you  Regard not what Fitzherbert says  For tho' you gain each good man's praise  We older folks shall hate you  You should have sent the other day  Gk the player with frowns away  Your smiles but made him bolder  Why would you hear his strange appeal  Which dar'd to make a statesman feel  I would that you were older  You should be proud and seem displeas'd  Or you for ever will be teaz'd  Your house with beggars haunted  What ev'ry suitor kindly us'd  If wrong their folly is excus'd  If right their suit is granted  From pressing crowds of great and small  To free yourself give hopes to all  And fail nineteen in twenty  What wound my honour break my word  You're young againYou may my lord  Have precedents in plenty  Indeed young statesman 'twill not do  Some other ways and means pursue  More fitted to your station  What from your boyish freeks can spring  Mere toysThe favour of your king  And love of all the nation  LIBERTY LA LIBERTA  Newly translated from METASTASIO  THANKS Nicè to thy treacherous art  At length I breathe again  The pitying gods have ta'en my part  And eas'd a wretch's pain  I feel I feel that from its chain  My rescued soul is free  Nor is it now I idly dream  Of fancied liberty  Extinguish'd is my ancient flame  All calm my thoughts remain  And artful love in vain shall strive  To lurk beneath disdain  No longer when thy name I hear  My conscious colour flies  No longer when thy face I see  My heart's emotions rise  I sleep yet not in every dream  Thy image pictur'd see  I wake nor does my alter'd mind  Fix its first thought on thee  From thee far distant when I roam  No fond concern I know  With thee I stay nor yet from thence  Does pain or pleasure flow  Oft of my Nicè's charms I speak  Nor thrills my stedfast heart  Oft I review the wrongs I bore  Yet feel no inward smart  No quick alarms confound my sense  When Nicè near I see  Even with my rival I can smile  And calmly talk of thee  Speak to me with a placid mien  Or treat me with disdain  Vain is to me the look severe  The gentle smile as vain  Lost is the empire o'er my soul  Which once those lips possest  Those eyes no longer can divine  Each secret of my breast  What pleases now or grieves my mind  What makes me sad or gay  It is not in thy power to give  Nor canst thou take away  Each pleasant spot without thee charms  The wood the mead the hill  And scenes of dullness even with thee  Are scenes of dullness still  Judge if I speak with tongue sincere  Thou still art wond'rous fair  Great are the beauties of thy form  But not beyond compare  And let not truth offend thine ear  My eyes at length incline  To spy some faults in that lov'd face  Which once appear'd divine  When from its secret deep recess  I tore the painful dart  My shameful weakness I confess  It seem'd to split my heart  But to relieve a tortur'd mind  To triumph o'er disdain  To gain my captive self once more  I'd suffer every pain  Caught by the birdlime's treacherous twigs  To which he chanc'd to stray  The bird his fasten'd feathers leaves  Then gladly flies away  His shorten'd wings he soon renews  Of snares no more afraid  Then grows by past experience wise  Nor is again betray'd  I know thy pride can ne'er believe  My passion's fully o'er  Because I oft repeat the tale  And still add something more  'Tis natural instinct prompts my tongue  And makes the story last  As all mankind are fond to boast  Of dangers they have past  The warrior thus the combat o'er  Recounts his bloody wars  Tells all the hardships which he bore  And shews his ancient scars  Thus the glad slave by prosperous fate  Freed from the servile chain  Shews to each friend the galling weight  Which once he dragg'd with pain  I speak yet speaking all my aim  Is but to ease my mind  I speak yet care not if my words  With thee can credit find  I speak nor ask if my discourse  Is e'er approv'd by thee  Or whether thou with equal ease  Dost talk again of me  I leave a light inconstant maid  Thou'st lost a heart sincere  I know not which wants comfort most  Or which has most to fear  I'm sure a swain so fond and true  Nicè can never find  A nymph like her is quickly found  False faithless and unkind  BRYAN AND PEREENE  A WEST INDIAN BALLAD  Founded on a real Fact that happened a few Years ago in the Island of ST CHRISTOPHER  THE northeast wind did briskly blow  The ship was safely moor'd  Young Bryan thought the boat's crew slow  And so leapt overboard  Pereene the pride of Indian dames  His heart long held in thrall  And whoso his impatience blames  I wot ne'er lov'd at all  A long long year one month and day  He dwelt on English land  Nor once in thought would ever stray  Though ladies sought his hand  For Bryan he was tall and strong  Right blythsome roll'd his een  Sweet was his voice whene'er he sung  He scant had twenty seen  But who the countless charms can draw  That grac'd his mistress true  Such charms the old world never saw  Nor oft I ween the new  Her raven hair plays round her neck  Like tendrils of the vine  Her cheeks red dewy rose buds deck  Her eyes like diamonds shine  Soon as his well known ship she spied  She cast her weeds away  And to the palmy shore she hied  All in her best array  In seagreen silk so neatly clad  She there impatient stood  The crew with wonder saw the lad  Repel the foaming flood  Her hands a handkerchief display'd  Which he at parting gave  Well pleas'd the token he survey'd  And manlier beat the wave  Her fair companions one and all  Rejoicing crowd the strand  For now her lover swam in call  And almost touch'd the land  Then through the white surf did she haste  To clasp her lovely swain  When ah a shark bit through his waist  His heart's blood dy'd the main  He shriek'd his half sprang from the wave  Streaming with purple gore  And soon it found a living grave  And ah was seen no more  Now haste now haste ye maids I pray  Fetch water from the spring  She falls she falls she dyes away  And soon her knell they ring  Now each Maymorning round her tomb  Ye fair fresh flowrets strew  So may your lovers scape his doom  Her hapless fate scape you  THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD TO HIS LOVE  AN OLD BALLAD  COME live with me and be my love  And we will all the pleasures prove  That hills and vallies dale and field  And all the craggy mountains yield  There will we sit upon the rocks  And see the shepherds feed their flocks  By shallow rivers to whose falls  Melodious birds sing madrigals  There will I make thee beds of roses  With a thousand fragrant posies  A cap of flowers and a kirtle  Imbroidered all with leaves of mirtle  A gown made of the finest wool  Which from our pretty lambs we pull  Slippers lin'd choicely for the cold  With buckles of the purest gold  A belt of straw and ivy buds  With coral clasps and amber studs  And if these pleasures may thee move  Then live with me and be my love  The shepherdswains shall dance and sing  For thy delight each Maymorning  If these delights thy mind may move  Then live with me and be my love  MY MIND TO ME A KINGDOM IS  AN OLD BALLAD  MY minde to me a kingdome is  Such perfect joy therein I finde  As farre exceeds all earthly blisse  That God or Nature hath assignde  Though much I want that most would have  Yet still my mind forbids to crave  Content I live this is my stay  I seek no more than may suffice  I presse to beare no haughtie sway  Look what I lack my mind supplies  Loe thus I triumph like a king  Content with that my mind doth bring  I see how plentie surfets oft  And hastie clymbers soonest fall  I see that such as sit aloft  Mishap doth threaten most of all  These get with toile and keep with feare  Such cares my mind could never beare  No princely pompe nor welthie store  No force to winne a victorie  No wylie wit to salve a sore  No shape to winne a lovers eye  To none of these I yeeld as thrall  For why my mind dispiseth all  Some have too much yet still they crave  I little have yet seek no more  They are but poore tho' much they have  And I am rich with litle store  They poor I rich they beg I give  They lacke I lend they pine I give  I laugh not at anothers losse  I grudge not at anothers gaine  No worldly wave my mind can tosse  I brooke that is another's bane  I feare no foe nor fawne on friend  I loth not life nor dread mine end  My welth is health and perfect ease  My conscience clere my chiefe defence  I never seeke by brybes to please  Nor by desert to give offence  Thus do I live thus will I die  Would all did so as well as I  CUPID's PASTIME  AN OLD SONNET  IT chanc'd of late a shepherd swain  That went to seek his straying sheep  Within a thicket on a plain  Espied a dainty nymph asleep  Her golden hair o'erspread her face  Her careless arms abroad were cast  Her quiver had her pillows place  Her breast lay bare to every blast  The snepherd stood and gaz'd his fill  Nought durst he do nought durst he say  Whilst chance or else perhaps his will  Did guide the god of love that way  The crafty boy thus sees her sleep  Whom if she wak'd he durst not see  Behind her closely seeks to creep  Before her nap should ended be  There come he steals her shafts away  And puts his own into their place  Nor dares he any longer stay  But ere she wakes hies thence apace  Scarce was he gone but she awakes  And spies the shepherd standing by  Her bended bow in haste she takes  And at the simple swain lets flye  Forth flew the shaft and pierc'd his heart  That to the ground he fell with pain  Yet up again forthwith he start  And to the nymph he ran amain  Amazed to see so strange a sight  She shot and shot but all in vain  The more his wounds the more his might  Love yielded strength amidst his pain  Her angry eyes were great with tears  She blames her hand she blames her skill  The bluntness of her shafts she fears  And try them on herself she will  Take heed sweet nymph trye not thy shaft  Each little touch will pierce thy heart  Alas thou know'st not Cupid's craft  Revenge is joy the end is smart  Yet try she will and pierce some bare  Her hands were glov'd but next to hand  Was that fair breast that breast so rare  That made the shepherd senseless stand  That breast she pierc'd and through that breast  Love found an entry to her heart  At seeling of this newcome guest  Lord how this gentle nymph did start  She runs not now she shoots no more  Away she throws both shaft and bow  She seeks for what she shunn'd before  She thinks the shepherd's haste too slow  Though mountains meet not lovers may  What other lovers do did they  The god of love sate on a tree  And laught that pleasant sight to see  WINIFREDA  AWAY let nought to love displeasing  My Winifreda move your care  Let nought delay the heavenly blessing  Nor squeamish pride nor gloomy fear  What tho' no grants of royal donors  With pompous titles grace our blood  We'll shine in more substantial honors  And to be noble we'll be good  Our name while virtue thus we tender  Will sweetly sound wheree'er 'tis spoke  And all the great ones they shall wonder  How they respect such little folk  What though from fortune's lavish bounty  No mighty treasures we possess  We'll find within our pittance plenty  And be content without excess  Still shall each returning season  Sufficient for our wishes give  For we will live a life of reason  And that's the only life to live  Through youth and age in love excelling  We'll hand in hand together tread  Sweet smiling peace shall crown our dwelling  And babes sweetsmiling babes our bed  How should I love the pretty creatures  While round my knees they fondly clung  To see them look their mothers features  To hear them lisp their mothers tongue  And when with envy time transported  Shall think to rob us of our joys  You'll in your girls again be courted  And I'll go a wooing in my boys  ADMIRAL HOSIER's GHOST  By Mr GLOVER Author of LEONIDES  AS near PortoBello lying  On the gently swelling flood  At midnight with streamers flying  Our triumphant navy rode  There while Vernon sate allglorious  From the Spaniards' late defeat  And his crews with shouts victorious  Drank success to England's fleet  On a sudden shrilly sounding  Hideous yells and skrieks were heard  Then each heart with fear confounding  A sad troop of ghosts appear'd  All in dreary hammocks shrouded  Which for windingsheets they wore  And with looks by sorrow clouded  Frowning on that hostile shore  On them gleam'd the moon's wan lustre  When the shade of Hosier brave  His pale bands was seen to muster  Rising from their watry grave  O'er the glimmering wave he hy'd him  Where the Burford rear'd her sail  With three thousand ghosts besides him  And in groans did Vernon hail  Heed oh heed our fatal story  I am Hosier's injur'd ghost  You who now have purchas'd glory  At this place where I was lost  Tho' in PortoBello's ruin  You now triumph free from fears  When you think on our undoing  You will mix your joy with tears  See these mournful spectres sweeping  Ghastly o'er this hated wave  Whose wan cheeks are stain'd with weeping  These were English captains brave  Mark those numbers pale and horrid  Those were once my failors bold  Lo each hangs his drooping forehead  While his dismal tale is told  I by twenty sail attended  Did this Spanish town affright  Nothing then its wealth defended  But my orders not to fight  Oh that in this rolling ocean  I had cast them with disdain  And obey'd my heart's warm motion  To have quell'd the pride of Spain  For resistance I could fear none  But with twenty ships had done  What thou brave and happy Vernon  Hast atchiev'd with six alone  Then the Bastimentos never  Had our foul dishonour seen  Nor the sea the sad receiver  Of this gallant train had been  Thus like thee proud Spain dismaying  And her galleons leading home  Though condemn'd for disobeying  I had met a traitor's doom  To have fallen my country crying  He has play'd an English part  Had been better far than dying  Of a griev'd and broken heart  Unrepining at thy glory  Thy successful arms we hail  But remember our sad story  And let Hosier's wrongs prevail  Sent in this foul clime to languish  Think what thousands fell in vain  Wasted with disease and anguish  Not in glorious battle slain  Hence with all my train attending  From their oozy tombs below  Thro' the hoary foam ascending  Here I feed my constant woe  Here the Bastimentos viewing  We recal our shameful doom  And our plaintive cries renewing  Wander thro' the midnight gloom  O'er these waves for ever mourning  Shall we roam depriv'd of rest  If to Britain's shores returning  You neglect my just request  After this proud foe subduing  When your patriot friends you see  Think on vengeance for my ruin  And for England sham'd in me  THE SHEPHERD'S RESOLUTION  An OLD BALLAD  By GEORGE WITHER

or pelican  If shee be not so to me  What care I how kind shee be  Shall a woman's virtues move  Me to perish for her love  Or her welldeservings knowne  Make me quite forget my owne  Be shee with that goodnesse blest  Which may merit name of Best  If she be not such to me  What care I how good shee be  'Cause her fortune seems too high  Shall I play the foole and dye  Those that beare a noble minde  Where they want of riches find  Thinke what with them they would doe  That without them dare to woe  And unlesse that minde I see  What care I though great shee be  Great or good or kind or faire  I will ne'er the more dispaire  If she love me this beleeve  I will die ere she shall grieve  If she slight me when I wooe  I can scorne and let her goe  For if shee be not for me  What care I

Affoords that blisse  For which I would refuse no paine  But such as you  Fond fooles adieu  You seeke to captive me in vaine  Leave me then you Syrens leave me  Seeke no more to worke my harmes  Craftie wiles cannot deceive me  Who am proofe against your charmes  You labour may  To lead astray  The heart that constant shall remaine  And I the while  Will sit and smile  To see you spend your time in vaine  AUTUMN  BY MR BREREWOOD  THO' the seasons must alter ah yet let me find  What all must confess to be rare  A female still cheerful and faithful and kind  The blessings of autumn to share  Let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine  Overspread with its branches and shade  Whose clusters appear more transparent and fine  As its leaves are beginning to fade  When the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load  In our orchard surrounded with pales  In a bed of clean straw let our apples be stow'd  For a tart that in winter regales  When the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn  Seem to hang on its surface like smoke  'Till dispers'd by the sun that gilds over the corn  Within doors let us prattle and joke  But when we see clear all the hues of the leaves  And at work in the fields are all hands  Some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves  Let us carelesly strole o'er the lands  How pleasing the sight of the toiling they make  To collect what kind Nature has sent  Heaven grant we may not of their labour partake  But oh give us their happy content  And sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook  Let us silently sit at our ease  And there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook  Struggles hard to procure its release  And now when the husbandman sings harvest home  And the corn's all got into the house  When the long wish'd for time of their meeting is come  To frolic and feast and carouse  When the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed  And are leaving the branches all bare  Either strew'd at the roots shrivell'd wither'd and dead  Or else blown to and fro in the air  When the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem  And the axletree's ready to break  While the waggoner whistles in stopping his team  And then claps the poor jades on the neck  In the morning let's follow the cry of the hounds  Or the fearful young covey beset  Which tho' skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds  Are becoming a prey to the net  Let's enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords  Still amus'd with these innocent sports  Nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords  With their grand entertainments in courts  In the evening when lovers are leaning on stiles  Deep engag'd in some amorous chat  And 'tis very well known by his grin and her smiles  What they both have a mind to be at  To our dwelling tho' homely wellpleas'd to repair  Let our mutual endearments revive  And let no single action or look but declare  How contented and happy we live  Should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul  Let soft music the phantoms remove  For 'tis harmony only has force to controul  And unite all the passions in love  With her eyes but half open her cap all awry  When the lass is preparing for bed  And the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by  Sometimes rouzes and scratches his head  In the night when 'tis cloudy and rainy and dark  And the labourers snore as they lie  Not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark  In the farm or the village hard by  At the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this  Ere our eyes are clos'd up in their lids  Let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss  Which the sunshine and daylight forbids  THE PIN  BY MR WOTY  FOR once ye critics let the sportive Muse  Her fool's cap wear spite of the shaking head  Of sterneyed Gravityfor tho' the Muse  To frolic be dispos'd no song she chants  Immoral nor one picture will she hold  But Virtue may approve it with a smile  Ye sylvan deities awhile adieu  Ye curling streams whose banks are fring'd with flowers  Violet and harebell or the kingcup bright  Farewell for I must leave your rich perfumes  To sing the Pin in ever sounding lays  But not that Pin at whose circumference  Rotund the strongnerv'd rustic hurls the bowl  Ponderous and vast nor that which window bars  From thief nocturnal nor that other call'd  A skittle chiefly found where alehouse snug  Invites mechanic to the flowing cup  Of Calvert's mild o'ercanopied with froth  No'tis the Pin so much by ladies us'd  Without whose aid the nymph of nicest taste  Of neatest mould a slattern would appear  Hail then thou little useful instrument  Tho' small yet consequential For by thee  Beauty sets off her charms as at the glass  Lucy or Phillis best adapts thy point  Without thy service would the ribband flaunt  Loose to the fanning gale nor on the head  Of belle would stand her whimsical attire  The kerchief from her neck of snow would fall  With freedom bold and leave her bosom bare  How would the sempstress trim thy want regret  As she her apron forms And how the man  Of law sagacious with his spectacles  On nose reverted frequent does he want  Thy prompt assistance to connect his scraps  And notes obliterated o'er Thee oft  In alley path wide square and open street  The miser picks as conscious of thy use  With frugal hand accompanied with brow  Of corrugated bent he sticks thee safe  Interior on his coat then creeps along  Well judging thy proportion to a groat  Thro' all thy different storehouses to trace  Thy presence either in the sculptur'd dome  Or tenement claybuilt would ask a pen  With points almost as various as thy heads  Wheree'er thou art or in whatever form  Magnificent in silver or in brass  Or wire more humble nightly may'st thou lie  Safe on thy cushion'd bed or kiss the locks  Of Chloe sleeping on the pillow's down  A PRESENT TO A YOUNG LADY WITH A PAIR OF STOCKINGS  BY FELLOW OF CAMBRIDGE  TO please the Fair what different ways  Each lover acts his part  One tenders snuff another praise  A toothpick or a heart  Alike they all to gain their end  Peculiar arts disclose  While I submissive only send  An humble pair of hose  Long may they guard from cold and harm  The snowy limbs that wear 'em  And kindly lend their influence warm  To ev'ry thing that's near 'em  But let it not be faulty deem'd  Nor move your indignation  If I a little partial seem'd  In gifts or commendation  Each fair perfection to display  Would far exceed my charter  My humble Muse must never stray  Above the knee or garter  And who did e'er a subject view  So worthy to be prais'd  Or from so fair foundation knew  So fine a structure rais'd  Thou learned leach sage Kember say  In spite of drugs and plaisters  You who can talk the livelong day  Of buildings and pilasters  You who for hours have rov'd about  Thro' halls and colonades  And scarce would deign to tread on aught  But arches and arcades  Did you in all your mazy rounds  Two nobler pillars view  What yielding marble ere was found  So exquisitely true  The swelling dome with stately show  May many fancies please  I view content what lies below  The cornice of the frieze  The lovely twins so white so round  That bear the noble pile  Must soon proceed from Venus' mound  Or from Cythera's isle  Propitious Fates preserve them safe  And keep them close together  And grant they may the malice brave  Of man as well as weather  From luckless love or rancour base  May never harm attend 'em  And grant whatever be the case  That I may still defend 'em  By gentle generous love 'tis true  They never can miscarry  No ill can come no loss ensue  From honest harmless Harry  But should a knight of greater heat  Precipitate invade  Believe me Bell they then may need  Some seasonable aid  O may I ready be at hand  From every harm to screen 'em  Then Samsonlike I'll take my stand  And live or die between 'em  A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A POET AND HIS SERVANT  BY THE LATE Mr CHRIST PITT  To enter into the beauties of this satire it must be remembered that slaves among the Romans during the feasts of Saturn wore their masters habits and were allowed to say what they pleased  SERVANT  SIRI've long waited in my turn to have  A word with youbut I'm your humble slave  P  What knave is that my rascal  S  Sir 'tis I  No knave nor rascal but your trusty Guy  P  Well as your wages still are due I'll bear  Your rude impertinence this time of year  S  Some folks are drunk one day and some for ever  And some like Wharton but twelve years together  Old Evremond renown'd for wit and dirt  Would change his living oftener than his shirt  Roar with the rakes of state a month and come  To starve another in his hole at home  So rov'd wild Buckingham the public jest  Now some innholder's now a monarch's guest  His life and politics of every shape  This hour a Roman and the next an ape  The gout in every limb from every vice  Poor Clodio hir'd a boy to throw the dice  Some wench for ever and their sins on those  By custom sit as easy as their cloaths  Some fly like pendulums from good to evil  And in that point are madder than the devil  For they  P  To what will these vile maxims tend  And where sweet sir will your reflections end  S  In you  P  In me you knave make out your charge  S  You praise lowliving but you live at large  Perhaps you scarce believe the rules you teach  Or find it hard to practise what you preach  Scarce have you paid one idle journey down  But without business you're again in town  If none invite you sir abroad to roam  ThenLord what pleasure 'tis to read at home  And sip your two halfpints with great delight  Of beer at noon and muddled port at night  From  The seat of John Pitt esq in Dorsetshire  Encombe John comes thundering at the door  With "Sir my master begs you to come o'er  " To pass these tedious hours these winter nights  " Not that he dreads invasions rogues or sprites"  Strait for your two best wigs aloud you call  This stiff in buckle that not curl'd at all  " And where you rascal are the spurs" you cry  " And O what blockhead laid the buskins by"  On your old batter'd mare you'll needs be gone  No matter whether on four legs or none  Splash plunge and stumble as you scour the heath  All swear at Morden 'tis on life or death  Wildly thro' Wareham streets you scamper on  Raise all the dogs and voters in the town  Then fly for six long dirty miles as bad  That Corfe and Kingston gentry think you mad  And all this furious riding is to prove  Your high respect it seems and eager love  And yet that mighty honour to obtain  Banks Shaftesbury Doddington may send in vain  Before you go we curse the noise you make  And bless the moment that you turn your back  As for myself I own it to your face  I love good eating and I take my glass  But sure 'tis strange dear sir that this should be  In you amusement but a fault in me  All this is bare refining on a name  To make a difference where the fault's the same  My father sold me to your service here  For this fine livery and four pounds a year  A livery you should wear as well as I  And this I'll provebut lay your cudgel by  You serve your passionsThus without a jest

and only he  All else are slaves alike the world around  Kings on the throne and beggars on the ground  He sir is proof to grandeur pride or pelf  And greater still is master of himself  Not toandfro by fears and factions hurl'd  But loose to all the interests of the world  And while that world turns round entire and whole  He keeps the sacred tenor of his soul  In every turn of fortune still the same  As gold unchang'd or brighter from the flame  Collected in himself with godlike pride  He sees the darts of envy glance aside  And fix'd like Atlas while the tempests blow  Smiles at the idle storms that roar below  One such you know a layman to your shame  And yet the honour of your blood and name  If you can such a character maintain  You too are free and I'm your slave again  But when in Hemskirk's pictures you delight  More than myself to see two drunkards fight  " Fool rogue sot blockhead" or such names are mine  " Your's are "a Connoisseur" or "Deep Divine"  I'm chid for loving a luxurious bit  The sacred prize of learning worth and wit  And yet some sell their lands these bits to buy  Then pray who suffers most from luxury  I'm chid 'tis true but then I pawn no plate  I seal no bonds I mortgage no estate  Besides high living sir must wear you out  With surfeits qualms a fever or the gout  By some new pleasures are you still engross'd  And when you save an hour you think it lost  To sports plays races from your books you run  And like all company except your own  You hunt drink sleep or idler still you rhyme  Whybut to banish thought and murder time  And yet that thought which you discharge in vain  Like a foulloaded piece recoils again  P  Tom fetch a cane a whip a club a stone  S  For what  P  A sword a pistol or a gun  I'll shoot the dog  S  Lord who would be a wit  He's in a mad or in a rhyming fit  P  Fly fly you rascal for your spade and fork  For once I'll set your lazy bones to work  Fly or I'll send you back without a groat  To the bleak mountains where you first were caught  PARODY ON THE CITY AND COUNTRY MOUSE  A Country vicar in his homely house  Pleas'd with his lot and happy in his spouse  With simple diet at his humble board  Once entertain'd the chaplain of a lord  He gave him all he could a little fish  With sauce of oysters in no silver dish  And for the craving stomach's sure relief  The glory of Old England rare Roastbeef  Horseradish and potatoes Ireland's pride  A pudding too the prudent dame supply'd  Their cheering beverage was a pint of port  Tho' small the quantum of the better sort  But plenty of good beer both small and stout  With wine of elder to prevent the gout  The vicar hop'd by such a various treat  To tempt his scarfembellish'd friend to eat  With nicest bits provok'd his guest to dine  He carv'd the haddock and he serv'd the wine  Content his own sharp stomach to regale  With plain substantial roastmeat and mild ale  Our courtly chaplain as we may suppose  At such oldfashion'd commons curl'd his nose  He tried in vain to piddle and in brief  Pish'd at the pudding and declin'd the beef  At length their homely dinner finish'd quite  Thus to the vicar spoke the priest polite  ' How can my brother in this paltry town  ' Live undistinguish'd to the world unknown  ' And not exalt your towering genius higher  ' Than here to herd with country clownor squire  ' Stunn'd with the discord of hoarse cawing rooks  ' The roar of winds the dissonance of brooks  ' Which discontented thro' the valley stray  ' Plaintive and murmuring at their long delay  ' Come come with me nor longer here abide  ' You've friends in town and I will be your guide  ' Soon great preferment to your share will fall  ' A good fat living or perhapsa stall'  These weighty reasons sway'd the vicar's mind  To town he hied but left his wife behind  Next levee day he waited on his Grace  With hundreds more who bow'd to get a place  Shov'd in the croud he stood amaz'd to see  Lords who to Baal bent the supple knee  And doctors sage he could not but admire  Who stoop'd profoundly lowto rise the higher  So much of ermine lace beaus bishops young and old  'Twas like a cloud of sable edg'd with gold  By turns his Grace the servile train addrest  Pleas'd with a smile or in a whisper blest  Sick of the scene the vicar sought the door  Determin'd never to see London more  But as his friend had pleas'd the hour to fix  First went to dinner to my Lord's at six  He knock'dwas usher'd to the room of state  My Lord abroad and dinner serv'd in plate  Which tho' it seem'd but common soup and hash  Was really callipee and callipash  The relicks of the gaudy day before  What Indians eat and Englishmen adore  With bright champaign the courtier crown'd the feast  Sooth'd his own pride and gratify'd his guest  All this conspir'd our Stoic to controul  And warpt the steady purpose of his soul  When lo the cry of fire creates amaze  " The next house Lady Riot's in a blaze"  Aghast the vicar stood in wild affright  Then briefly thus address'd the priest polite  " Adieu my friendyour state I envy not  " Beef liberty and safety be my lot"  THE RECANTATION  AN ODE  BY love too long depriv'd of rest  Fell tyrant of the human breast  His vassal long and worn with pain  Indignant late I spurn'd the chain  In verse in prose I sung and swore  No charms should e'er enslave me more  Nor neck nor hair nor lip nor eye  Again should force one tender sigh  As taught by heaven's informing power  From every fruit and every flower  That nature opens to the view  The bee extracts the nectardew  A vagrant thus and free to change  From fair to fair I vow'd to range  And part from each without regret  As pleas'd and happy as I met  Then Freedom's praise inspir'd my tongue  With Freedom's praise the vallies rung  And every night and every day  My heart thus pour'd th' enraptur'd lay  " My cares are gone my sorrows cease  " My breast regains its wonted peace  " And joy and hope returning prove  " That Reason is too strong for Love"  Such was my boastbut ah how vain  How short was Reason's vaunted reign  The firm resolve I form'd erewhile  How weak oppos'd to Clara's smile  Chang'd is the strainThe vallies round  With Freedom's praise no more resound  But every night and every day  My full heart pours the alter'd lay  Offended deity whose power  My rebel tongue but now forswore  Accept my penitence sincere  My crime forgive and grant my prayer  Let not thy slave condemn'd to mourn  With unrequited passion burn  With Love's soft thoughts her breast inspire  And kindle there an equal fire  It is not beauty's gaudy flower  The empty triumph of an hour  Nor practis'd wiles of female art  That now subdue my destin'd heart  O no'Tis heav'n whose wondrous hand  A transcript of itself hath plann'd  And to each outward grace hath join'd  Each lovelier feature of the mind  These charms shall last when others fly  When roses fade and lillies die  When that dear eye's declining beam  Its living fire no more shall stream  Blest then and happy in my chain  The song of Freedom flows in vain  Nor Reason's harsh reproof I fear  For Reason's self is Passion here  O dearer far than wealth or fame  My daily thought my nightly dream  If yet no youth's successful art  Sweet hope hath touch'd thy gentle heart  If yet no swain hath bless'd thy choice  Indulgent hear thy Damon's voice  From doubts from fears his bosom free  And bid him livefor love and thee  VERSE  WRITTEN UPON A PEDESTAL BENEATH A ROW OF ELMS IN A MEADOW NEAR RICHMOND FERRY BELONGING TO RICHARD OWEN CAMBRIDGE ESQ SEPT MDCCLX  A line of Mr Mason's  YE greenhair'd nymphs whom Pan allows  To guard from harm these favour'd boughs  Ye blueeyed Naiads of the stream  That sooth the warm poetic dream  Ye elves and sprights that thronging round  When midnight darkens all the ground  In antic measures uncontroul'd  Your fairy sports and revels hold  And up and down wheree'er ye pass  With many a ringlet print the grass  If e'er the bard hath hail'd your power  At morn's grey dawn or evening hour  If e'er by moonlight on the plain  Your ears have caught th' enraptur'd strain  From every floweret's velvet head  From reverend Thames's oozy bed  From these moss'd elms where prison'd deep  Conceal'd from human eyes ye sleep  If these your haunts be worth your care  Awake arise and hear my prayer  O banish from this peaceful plain  The perjur'd nymph the faithless swain  The stubborn heart that scorns to bow  And harsh rejects the honest vow  The fop who wounds the virgin's ear  With aught that sense would blush to hear  Or false to honour mean and vain  Defames the worth he cannot stain  The light coquet with various art  Who casts her net for every heart  And smiling flatters to the chace  Alike the worthy and the base  The dame who proud of virtue's praise  Is happy if a sister strays  And conscious of unclouded fame  Delighted spreads the tale of shame  But far O banish'd far be they  Who hear unmov'd the orphan's cry  Who see nor wish to wipe away  The tear that swells the widow's eye  Th' unloving man whose narrow mind  Disdains to feel for humankind  At others bliss whose cheek ne'er glows  Whose breast ne'er throbs with others woes  Whose hoarded sum of private joys  His private care alone destroys  Ye fairies cast your spells around  And guard from such this hallow'd ground  But welcome all who figh with truth  Each constant maid and faithful youth  Whom mutual love alone hath join'd  Sweet union of the willing mind  Hearts pair'd in heaven not meanly sold  Lawlicens'd prostitutes for gold  And welcome thrice and thrice again  The chosen few the worthy train  Whose steady feet untaught to stray  Still tread where virtue marks the way  Whose souls no thought whose hands have known  No deed which honour might not own  Who torn with pain or stung with care  In others bliss can claim a part  And in life's brightest hour can share  Each pang that wrings another's heart  Ye guardian sprights when such ye see  Sweet peace be theirs and welcome free  Clear be the sky from clouds or showers  Green be the turf and fresh the flowers  And that the youth whose pious care  Lays on your shrine this honest prayer  May with the rest admittance gain  And visit oft this pleasant scene  Let all who love the Muse attend  Who loves the Muse is Virtue's friend  Such then alone may venture here  Who free from guilt are free from fear  Whose wide affections can embrace  The whole extent of human race  Whom Virtue and her friends approve  Whom Cambridge and the Muses love  SONG  SWEET are the banks when Spring perfumes  The verdant plants and laughing flowers  Fragrant the violet as it blooms  And sweet the blossoms after showers  Sweet is the soft the sunny breeze  That fans the golden orangegrove  But oh how sweeter far than these  The kisses are of her I love  Ye roses blushing in your beds  That with your odours scent the air  Ye lillies chaste with silver heads  As my Cleora's bosom fair  No more I court your balmy sweets  For I and I alone can prove  How sweeter when each other meets  The kisses are of her I love  Her tempting eyes my gaze inclin'd  Their pleasing lesson first I caught  Her sense her friendship next confin'd  The willing pupil she had taught  Should fortune stooping from her sky  Conduct me to her bright alcove  Yet like the turtle I should die  Denied the kiss of her love  THE LADY AND THE LINNET  A TALE  ADDRESSED TO A FRIEND  Sumit Myrrha novos veteres ut ponit amictus  Mutat amatores miseros sic mutat amicos  FRAGM INCERT AUTH  TO lift the low the proud depress  And succour weakness in distress  A foe forgive and yet contend  With generous ardour for a friend  Are virtues tho' but thinly sown  Not circumscrib'd to you alone  Since hourly observation finds  They spring in some inferior minds  Which tho' we justly pass our praise on  Are not the sound effects of reason  But often flow from whim or fashion  From pride or some impurer passion  But you whom heaven at first design'd  The boast and envy of your kind  Above your sex's censure plac'd  In beauty breeding temper taste  Who only show regard to merit  Unconscious what yourself inherit  While other ladies fume and rail  In indignation at my tale  With each reflection pick a quarrel  And find a satire in each moral  May safely every page peruse  Nor be offended with the Muse  Where not a single line appears  Which honour dreads or virtue fears  A hungry hawk in quest of prey  Wide o'er the forest wing'd his way  Whence every bird that haunts the glade  Or warbles in the rural shade  Dispers'd in wild disorder flies  Before the tyrant of the skies  A linnet feebler than the rest  With weary wings and panting breast  Sought Sylvia's window in despair  And fluttering crav'd protection there  Compassion touch'd the fair one's mind  For female hearts are always kind  Upward the gliding sash she threw  And in the little stranger flew  There in her fragrant bosom prest  The nymph revives her drooping guest  Then danger o'er and all serene  Restores him to his fields again  What wondrous joy what grateful love  Inspir'd the wanderer of the grove  In unexpected life elate  When now he recollects his fate  And sets the friendly fair in view  Who gave him life and freedom too  For gratitude to courts unknown  And unreturn'd by man alone  Wide thro' the wing'd creation reigns  And dwells amidst the humble plains  In every verdant field and shade  The just the generous debt is paid  Back from the Sylvan bower he hies  To thank his dear deliverer flies  And at her window chaunting stood  Her praise with all the zeal he could  There Lin his morning visits pays  And there he tunes his evening lays  There oft the noonday hour prolongs  And pours his little soul in songs  His heavenly airs attention drew  And Sylvia soon the warbler knew  Then uses every charm to win  And draw the wild musician in  He enters fearless of a snare  For how should fraud inhabit there  And now by frequent visits free  At first he perches on her knee  Then grown by long acquaintance bolder  Familiarly ascends her shoulder  And wholly now devoid of fear  Plays with the pendant in her ear  O'er all her neck and bosom strays  And like a lover learns to teaze  Pecks on her hand and fondly sips  Delicious nectar from her lips  Thrice happy bird how wert thou bless'd  Of such superior love possess'd  Couldst thou but make the tenure sure  And those unrivall'd hours endure  But love a light fantastic thing  Like thee is always on the wing  And sacred friendship oft a jest  When center'd in a female breast  Thus Lin the circling moments past  In raptures too refin'd to last  When as his constant court he paid  Some envious songsters of the shade  Observ'd his motions to and fro  For merit's ne'er without a foe  They mark'd the transports of his eye  His sprightly air and glossy dye  And all agreed to know ere night  What gave the vagrant such delight  Strait to the beauteous bower they throng  Nor for admittance waited long  The nymph whom every charm attends  Receives her new aerial friends  With crumbled cake and fruitage feeds  And feasts them on her choicest seeds  Did all that kindness could inspire  To bring her coy acquaintance nigh her  And Linny now returns to pay  The due devotions of the day  When to his wondering eyes arose  A numerous circle of his foes  Grief touch'd his soul to see them there  But with a seeming easy air  He took his place among the rest  And sat an undistinguish'd guest  Alas how soon can time destroy  The surest pledge of earthly joy  A favourite's flattering hopes defeat  And tumble tyrants from their state  For time indulgent but to few  Deposes kingsand linnets too  He who was once the nymph's delight  Sits now neglected in her sight  In vain to charm her ear he tries  New forms engag'd her ears and eyes  The goldfinch spreads his gaudy coat  And all were ravish'd with his note  While none attends to Linny's strain  For ah poor Linny's plumes were plain  And now the mournful warbler flown  The nymph and friendly bower their own  O'er all reserve their spleen prevails  And every tongue in concert rails  All wonder'd what her eyes could see  In such a worthless thing as he  Who still pursues his private ends  Ungrateful to his kindest friends  One instance sure might serve to show him  Alas how little did they know him  Some then recounted all the arts  He us'd to vanquish little hearts  Affirm'd he still was making love  And kept a miss in every grove  Could trifle with the meanest fowl  Nay offer courtship to an owl  Scandal tho' pointed in the dark  Is seldom known to miss its mark  While few will interrupt its aim  Regardless of another's fame  Even they by whom we once were lov'd  Thro' life for several years approv'd  When spleen and envy rail aloud  Are often carried with the crowd  Preferring rather than contend  To sacrifice their nearest friend  Thus Sylvia yielded to the birds  Too complaisant to doubt their words  Nor thought that creatures so polite  Could deal in calumny and spite  The injur'd Linnet with their leaves  For decency she still receives  Who tho' he sees his foes carest  Like some fond lover hopes the best  And doubts his own discerning eyes  But ah how obvious is disguise  At length of hope itself bereft  When now no friendly look was left  And every mark of fondness fled  He hung his wings and droop'd his head  And am I then resign'd he says  To such ungenerous foes as these  By these defrauded of my bliss  Is all her kindness come to this  Yet ah my tongue forbear to blame  That lov'd that everhonour'd name  This heart howe'er misus'd at last  Must own unnumber'd favours past  And shall tho' ne'er to meet again  The dear remembrance still retain  He spokeand to the window flew  There sat and sung his last adieu  THE GENIUS OF BRITAIN  AN IAMBIC ODE  WRITTEN IN MDCCLVI  AS late o'er Britain's chalky coasts  The Genius of the island flew  The venal swarm of foreign hosts  Inglorious basking in his view  Deep in his breast he felt the new disgrace  And honest blushes warm'd his godlike face  Quick flash'd the lightning of his spear  Which blasted France on Cressy's field  He wheel'd the blazing sword in air  And on his shoulders spread the shield  As when o'er Agincourt's bloodpurpled lands  Pale Terror stalk'd thro' all the Gallic bands  Soon as he cast his eyes below  Deep heav'd the sympathetic sigh  Sudden the tears of anguish flow  For sore he felt th' indignity  Discordant passions shook his heavenly frame  Now Horror's damp now indignation's flame  Ah what avails he cried the blood  Shed by each patriot band of yore  When Freedom's unpaid legions stood  Protectors of this seagirt shore  When antient Wisdom deem'd each British sword  From hostile power could guard its valiant lord  What tho' the Danish raven spread  Awhile his wings o'er English ground  The bird of prey funereal fled  When Alfred call'd his peers around  Whose fleets triumphant riding on the flood  Deep stain'd each chalky cliff with Denmark's blood  Alfred on natives could depend  And scorn'd a foreign force t'employ  He thought who dar'd not to defend  Were never worthy to enjoy  The realm's and monarch's interest deem'd but one  And arm'd his subjects to maintain their own  What tho' weak John's divided reign  The Gallic legions tempted o'er  When Henry's barons join'd again  Those feather'd warriors left the shore  Learn Britons hence you want no foreign friends  The Lion's safety on himself depends  Reflect on Edward's glorious name  On my fifth Henry's martial deeds  Think on those peers of deathless fame  Who met their king on Thames's meads  When sovereign might acknowledg'd reason's plea  That heaven created man for liberty  Tho' Rome's fell star malignant shone  When good Eliza rul'd this state  On English hearts she plac'd her throne  And in their happiness her fate  While blacker than the tempests of the North  The papal tyrant sent his curses forth  Lo where my Thames's waters glide  At great Augusta's regal feet  Bearing on each returning tide  From distant realms a golden fleet  Which homeward wafts the fruits of every zone  And makes the wealth of all the world your own  Shall on his silver waves be borne  Of armed slaves a venal crew  Lo the old God denotes his scorn  And shudders at th' unusual view  Down to his deepest cave retires to mourn  And tears indignant bathe his crystal urn  O how can vassals born to bear  The galling weight of Slavery's chain  A patriot's noble ardor share  Or Freedom's sacred cause maintain  Britons exert your own unconquer'd might  A Freeman best defends a Freeman's right  Look back on every deathless deed  For which your sires recorded stand  To battle let your nobles lead  The sons of toil and hardy band  The sword on each rough peasant's thigh be worn  And war's green wreaths the shepherd's front adorn  But see upon his utmost shores  America's sad Genius lies  Each wasted province he deplores  And casts on me his languid eyes  Bless'd with heav'n's favourite ordinance I fly  To raise the oppress'd and humble tyranny  This said the Vision westward fled  His wrinkled brow denouncing war  The way firemantled Vengeance led  And Justice drove his airy car  Behind firmfooted Peace her olive bore  And Plenty's horn pour'd blessings on the shore  HOPE A PASTORAL BALLAD  MY pipe sounds a cheerfuller note  My crook is new garnish'd with flowers  This day to sweet thoughts I devote  Where blossom the eglantine bowers  My sheep unattended may stray  Where clover impurples the plain  My dog unregarded may play  Till morning rise on him again  'Tis fit that they too should partake  Of the joy that enlivens my soul  At night I'll repair to the wake  And merrily quaff the full bowl  Just now as I walk'd thro' the grove  I met my dear Delia there  And told her a tale of my love  Which she seem'd with soft pleasure to hear  A blush like the blush of the dawn  Stole over her beautiful cheek  Smiles sweeter than infants newborn  Told more than I wish'd her to speak  I stole from her hand a sweet kiss  Nor tried she to draw it away  No description comes up to the bliss  That reigns in my bosom to day  Methinks every Zephyr that blows  Soft music conveys to my ear  Methinks every floweret that grows  More blooming and fresh does appear  The birds tune their musical throats  And sing most delightfully sweet  In soft and more delicate notes  Sweet Echo my sighs does repeat  ODE TO SENSIBILITY  THanks to thee Nymph whose powerful hand  From dulness set me free  Thy praises I'll for ever sing  Sweet Sensibility  Thy touch so gentle and benign  Revives the torpid heart  Thou pleasure canst from pain refine  To joys new joy impart  By thee the gaudy rainbow shows  More beauteous to the eye  By thee more sweetly smells the rose  And boasts a brighter dye  By thee I taste the luscious sweets  Of Cloe's nectar'd kiss  By thee I laugh or cheerful sing  And seize each transient bliss  When Cloe tunes her liquid voice  Or tries soft music's art  By thee the sounds melodious pierce  Like lightning to the heart  By thee the poet's charming lays  Our various passions move  Now fire the soul with rage or melt  To pity or to love  By thee the scientific page  The scholar's eye delights  By thee he shares the feast of wit  Or wit himself indites  With thee we taste the joys of wine  Of friendship and of love  When thou art gone we lonely pine  Or melancholic rove  PETRARCH AND LAURA  AN EPIGRAMMATIC TALE  DAN Petrarch of old it has often been said  By some Cardinal urg'd his fair Laura to wed  With an offer of fortune and welltim'd it was  For poets have seldom much rent from Parnass'  Cried my lord you'll excuse me but I have a reason  Why even this offer becomes out of season  I've a new book of sonnets just ripe for the press  Upon the same plan as the last you may guess  I have there all along made my Laura a goddess  And Venus to please me has lent her the boddice  While Hebe Minerva and twenty to boot  With gifts all celestial have trick'd me her out  Now marriage my lord the whole charm would destroy  And hurl her divinity quite from the sky  To my cost I should find her no more than a woman  And my sonnets alas would gain credit with no man  TO WINTER  BY MR WOTY  WHAT tho' thou com'st in sable mantle clad  Yet Winter art thou welcome to my eye  Thee here I hail tho' terrors round thee wait  And winds tempestuous howl along the sky  But shall I then so soon forget the days  When Ceres led me thro' her wheaten mines  When autumn pluck'd me with his tawny hand  Empurpled clusters from ambrosial vines  So soon forget when up the yielding pole  I saw ascend the silverbearded hop  When Summer waving high her crown of hay  Pour'd o'er the mead her odoriferous crop  I must forget themand thee too O Spring  Tho' many a chaplet thou hast weav'd for me  For now prepar'd to quit th' enchanting scenes  Cold weeping Winter I come all to thee  Hail to thy rolling clouds and rapid storms  Tho' they deform fair Nature's lovely face  Hail to thy winds that sweep along the earth  Tho' trees they root up from their solid base  How sicklied over is the face of things  Where is the spice kiss of the southern gale  Where the wild rose that smil'd upon the thorn  The mountain flower and lilly of the vale  How gloomy 'tis to cast the eye around  And view the trees disrob'd of every leaf  The velvet path grown rough with clotting showers  And every field depriv'd of every sheaf  How far more gloomy o'er the rainbeat heath  Alone to travel in the dead of night  No twinkling star to gild the arch of heaven  No moon to lend her temporary light  To see the lightning spread its ample sheet  Discern the wild waste thro' its liquid fire  To hear the thunder rend the troubled air  As time itself and nature would expire  And yet O Winter has thy poet seen  Thy face as smooth and placid as the Spring  Has felt with comfort felt the beam of heaven  And heard thy vallies and thy woodlands ring  What time the sun with burnish'd locks arose  The long lost charms of nature to renew  When pearls of ice bedeck'd the grassy turf  And treetops floated in the silver dew  Father of heaven and earth this change is thine  By thee the Seasons in gradation roll  Thou great omniscient Ruler of the world  Thou Alpha and Omega of the whole  Here humbly bow we down our heads to thee  'Tis ours the voice of gratitude to raise  Thine to diffuse thy blessings o'er the land  Thine to receive the incense of our praise  Pure if it rises from the conscious heart  With thee for ever does the symbol live  Tho' small for all thy love is man's return  Thou ask'st no more than he has power to give  AN EPISTLE OF M DE VOLTAIRE  UPON HIS ARRIVAL AT HIS ESTATE NEAR THE LAKE OF GENEVA IN MARCH MDCCLV  FROM THE

AMIDST the more important toils of state  The counsels lab'ring in thy patriot soul  Tho' Europe from thy voice expect her fate  And thy keen glance extends from pole to pole  O Chatham nurs'd in antient virtue's lore  To these sad strains incline a fav'ring ear  Think on the God whom thou and I adore  Nor turn unpitying from  the Poor Man's Prayer  Ah me how blest was once a peasant's life  No lawless passion swell'd my even breast  Far from the stormy waves of civil strife  Sound were my slumbers and my heart at rest  I ne'er for guilty painful pleasures rov'd  But taught by nature and by choice to wed  From all the hamlet cull'd whom best I lov'd  With her I staid my heart with her my bed  To gild her worth I ask'd no wealthy power  My toil could feed her and my arm defend  In youth or age in pain or pleasure's hour  The same fond husband father brother friend  And she the faithful partner of my care  When ruddy evening streak'd the western sky  Look'd towards the uplands if her mate was there  Or thro' the beechwood cast an anxious eye  The careful matron heap'd the maple board  With favoury herbs and pick'd the nicer part  From such plain food as nature could afford  Ere simple nature was debauch'd by art  While I contented with my homely chear  Saw round my knees my prattling children play  And oft with pleas'd attention sat to hear  The little history of their idle day  But ah how chang'd the scene on the cold stones  Where wont at night to blaze the cheerful fire  Pale Famine sits and counts her naked bones  Still sighs for food still pines with vain desire  My faithful wife with everstreaming eyes  Hangs on my bosom her dejected head  My helpless infants raise their feeble cries  And from their father claim their daily bread  Dear tender pledges of my honest love  On that bare bed behold your brother lie  Three tedious days with pinching want he strove  The fourth I saw the helpless cherub die  Nor long shall ye remain with visage sour  Our tyrant lord commands us from our home  And arm'd with cruel law's coercive power  Bids me and mine o'er barren mountains roam  Yet never Chatham have I pass'd a day  In riot's orgies or in idle ease  Ne'er have I sacrific'd to sport and play  Or wish'd a pamper'd appetite to please  Hard was my fate and constant was my toil  Still with the morning's orient light I rose  Fell'd the stout oak or rais'd the lofty pile  Parch'd in the sun in dark December froze  Is it that Nature with a niggard hand  Witholds her gifts from these once favour'd plains  Has God in vengeance to a guilty land  Sent dearth and famine to her lab'ring swains  Ah no yon hill where daily sweats my brow  A thousand flocks a thousand herds adorn  Yon field where late I drove the painful plough  Feels all her acres crown'd with wavy corn  But what avails that o'er the furrow'd soil  In autumn's heat the yellow harvests rise  If artificial want elude my toil  Untasted plenty wound my craving eyes  What profits if at distance I behold  My wealthy neighbour's fragrant smoke ascend  If still the griping cormorants withold  The fruits which rain and genial seasons send  If those fell vipers of the public weal  Yet unrelenting on our bowels prey  If still the curse of penury we feel  And in the midst of plenty pine away  In every port the vessels ride secure  That wafts our harvest to a foreign shore  While we the pangs of pressing want endure  The sons of strangers riot on our store  O generous Chatham stop those fatal sails  Once more with outstrech'd arm thy Britons save  Th' unheeding crew but waits for fav'ring gales  O stop them ere they stem Italia's wave  From thee alone I hope for instant aid  'Tis thou alone canst save my children's breath  O deem not little of our cruel need  O haste to help us for delay is death  So may nor spleen nor envy blast thy name  Nor voice profane thy patriot acts deride  Still may'st thou stand the first in honest fame  Unstung by folly vanity or pride  So may thy languid limbs with strength be brac'd  And glowing health support thy active soul  With fair renown thy public virtue grac'd  Far as thou bad'st Britannia's thunder roll  Then joy to thee and to thy children peace  The grateful hind shall drink from Plenty's horn  And while they share the cultur'd land's increase  The poor shall bless the day when  Pitt  was born  AN EPITAPH  WRITTEN BY MR

several hands in which an Ode called The Regions of Terror and Pity wrote by Mr DODSLEY was not inserted  YOU ask why in that garland fair  Where various sweets abound  A  certain  flow'r of merit rare  Is no where to be found  Why the same florist thought not meet  To give that bloom its due  Since none can odours yield more sweet  Or boast a brighter hue  Then know the modest swain my friend

so near  To rank with men of letters  Aim not in that selected wreath  Where buds of sweetest odours breath  To mix thy fainter blooms  Nor dare to place with flow'rs so bright  Pale hemlock and cold

near me of equal degree  As like me in all things as pea is to pea  On a pudding and joint who contented can dine  With a glass of old Port and October divine  May my flock c  III  May my offerings

joke  May my flock c  V  With no mystical learning I'd trouble my head  Relying on faith which will do in its stead  With knowledge enough heaven's gates to unlock  And to take the strait road there along with my flock  May my flock c  VI  With a bottle or two of prime wine on my shelf  To recur to whene'er I am tir'd of myself  And a good natur'd muse to retire to at leisure  Who will wrap me in rhimes and inspire me with measure  May my flock c  VII  To enjoy what I have without wishing for more  For contentment with little is doubling one's store  And when I am gone may my successor say  He's gone and I wish I could live the same way  For his flock ne'er embroil'd him in quarrels or strife  In good humour he liv'd all the days of his life  And died before tir'd of himself or his wife

HOUSE AT STRAWBERRY HILL  BY MISS M  WHEN Envy saw yon Gothic structure rise  She view'd the fabric with malignant eyes  With grief she gazes on the antique wall  The pictur'd windows and the trophy'd hall  Thro' wellranged chambers next she bends her way  Gloomy not dark and chearful tho' not gay  Where to the whole each part proportion bears  And all around a pleasing aspect wears  Towards the study then her footsteps tend  Where columns rise and sculptur'd arches bend  Here soothing Melancholy holds her seat  And Contemplation seeks the lov'd retreat  The garden next displays a magic scene  Of fragrant plants and neverfading green  Each various season various gifts bestows  The lilac woodbine and the blooming rose  Hence in clear prospect to the gazer's eye  Woods hills and streams in sweet confusion lie  The silver Thames as he pursues his way  Seems here to loiter and prolong his stay  These matchless charms her indignation move  She weeps to find she cannot but approve  Then sorely sighing from her canker'd breast  Thus the curst fiend her impious woes exprest  Am I in vain the foe to all thy race  'Twas I that wrought thy patriot sire's disgrace  In vain I strove to blot his honour'd name  Brighter it shines restor'd by endless fame  And must another Walpole break my rest  And must thy praises my repose molest  'Tis thine by various talents still to please  To plan with judgment execute with ease  With equal skill to build converse and write  To charm the mind and gratify the sight  Ah could I but these battlements o'erthrow  And lay this monument of genius low  But vain the wish for art and nature join  To add perfection to the fair design  It must proceed for so the fates decree  Yet mark the sentence that's pronounc'd by me  Thousands that view it shall the work despise  And thousands more shall view it with my eyes  Th' applause which thou so gladly wouldst receive  The candid and the wise alone shall give  Taste tho' much talk'd of is confin'd to few  They best can prize it who are most like you  To the AUTHORESS of some Lines on STRAWBERRYHILL  By the Hon HORACE WALPOLE  MISTAKEN fair one check thy fancy's flight  Nor let fond poetry misguide thy sight  The sweet creation by thy pencil drawn  Nor real in the fabric nor the lawn  Less in the master is the picture true  Unlike the portrait and improv'd the view  A trifling careless shortliv'd writer he  Nor Envy's topic can nor object be  Nor pasteboard walls nor mimic towers are fit  To exercise her tooth or Delia's wit  No 'twas Parnassus did her fancy fill  Which the kind maid mistook for Strawb'ryhill  While Modesty persuaded her to place  Another on that mount she ought to grace  TO APOLLO MAKING LOVE  FROM MONSIEUR FONTENELLE  BY THOMAS TICKELL ESQ  I Am cry'd Apollo when Daphne he woo'd  And panting for breath the coy virgin pursu'd  When his wisdom in manner most ample exprest  The long list of the graces his godship possest  I'm the god of sweet song and inspirer of lays  Nor for lays nor sweet song the fair fugitive stays  I'm the god of the harpstop my fairestin vain  Nor the harp nor the harper could fetch her again  Every plant every flower and their virtues I know  God of light I'm above and of physic below  At the dreadful word physic the nymph fled more fast  At the fatal word physic she doubled her haste  Thou fond god of wisdom then alter thy phrase  Bid her view thy young bloom and thy ravishing rays  Tell her less of thy knowledge and more of thy charms  And my life for't the damsel shall fly to thy arms  THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF VIRGIL  WRITTEN BY MAPHOEUS VEGIUS  Translated into ENGLISH VERSE By MOSES MENDES Esq  ADVERTISEMENT  THE great character Maphaeus Vegius bore among the learned may be a sufficient reason for me to have attempted the following translation in which I was the more encouraged as I do not know of any other version but one by Thomas Twine doctor of physic printed in the year and he I am sure is no powerful antagonist I shall not pretend to criticise upon my author but shall only observe by the way that I think him too fond of repetitions some of which I have hurried over and others I have entirely struck out  Maphaeus Vegius was born at Lodi in the Milaneze in the year and was secretary of the briefs to pope Martin the Fifth and afterwards datary He was likewise endowed with a canonry of St Peter's with which he was so well contented that he refused a rich bishoprick Pope Eugenius the Fourth and Nicholas the Fifth out of their regard for his learning and affection to his person continued him in his office of datary  He died at Rome in the year  THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF VIRGIL  THE ARGUMENT  Turnus being slain by Eneas the Rutuli submit to the conqueror and are suffered to carry off their dead leader with all his armour except the belt of Pallas which īs to be sent back to Evander Eneas sacrifices to the gods Latinus deplores the death of Turnus So does Daunus his father who likewise laments a great conflagration that lays his city in ashes and is miraculously transformed into a bird called a heron Latinus sends messengers to Eneas with proposals of peace and a treaty of marriage with his daughter Lavinia which are both accepted He comes to Laurentum marries the daughter of the king and at his death succeeds him in the kingdom having first founded a city of his own which he names Lavinium Venus interceeds with Jupiter to make her son a god which he consents to She flies with him to heaven and he is afterwards worshipped by the Romans  DEform'd in dust now Turnus press'd the ground  The soul indignant rushing from the wound  While eminent amid the gazing bands  Like Mars himself the Trojan victor stands  Groans thick in consort from the Latians rise  And ev'ry heart in every bosom dies  As the tall wood bewails in hollow sound  By storms impell'd her honours on the ground  Now fix'd in earth their spears the humbled foe  Rest on their swords and targets from them throw  Condemn the thirst of battle and abhor  The dreaded fury of destructive war  Submit to all the conqu'ror shall impose  And pardon crave and end of all their woes  As when two bulls inflam'd with martial rage  Impetuous in the bloody fight engage  To each his herd inclines who anxious wait  The dubious conflict and their champion's fate  But one victorious t'others dames in awe  From their foil'd chief their former faith withdraw  They grieve indeed but join with one accord  To share the fortunes of an happier lord  So the Rutulians struck with mighty dread  Tho' deep their sorrow for their leader dead  Yet now the Phrygians glorious arms would join  Conducted by a leader so divine  And a firm league of lasting peace implore  That cruel war might vex their lives no more  Then striding o'er the foe the ghastly dead  The Trojan chief expostulating said  " What madness seiz'd thee Daunian in the thought  That we by Heaven's appointment hither brought  Here planted by the thunderer's decree  Could from our mansions be expell'd by thee  Oh rash the will celestial to oppose  To anger Jove and make the gods thy foes  At length the utmost of thy rage is done  'Gainst Teucer's race with breach of league begun  Lo future times from this instructive day  Almighty Jove shall fear to disobey  And learn from dread example to abhor  The crime of kindling without cause a war  Now boast thy arms a noble corse thou'rt laid  Since such a price thou for Lavinia paid  Nor yet shall fame to thy dishonour tell  That thou defeated by Eneas fell  But oh Rutulians bear away your chief  Funereal rites perform indulge your grief  With all his arms your hero I restore  Except the belt which erst young Pallas wore  That to his hoary sire I mean to send  Perhaps some comfort may the gift attend  The sullen joy that slak'd revenge bestows  May sooth his soul and mollify his woes  And ye Ausonians under better stars  Shall lead your legions to successful wars  If justice wield the sword I never sought  To harm your friends but selfdefending fought  To save my own the hostile steel I drew  Fate crown'd my honest aim and frown'd on you"  Eneas said and sought with inward joy  The walls that hold the poor remains of Troy  Mean while his troops their welllov'd chief attend  And with reproach the conquer'd hosts offend  Their shouts triumphant eccho to the sky  The mettl'd coursers neigh and seem to fly  The pious Trojan ere he light the fire  Due to his friends upon the sacred pyre  By other flames begins his just returns  And to the gods each holy altar burns  Observant ever of his country's rites  The mitred priest devoted heifers smites  The clam'rous swine increase the heaps of slain  And milkwhite lambkins plead for life in vain  Forth from each victim are the entrails torn  And piecemeal cut in sacred chargers borne  They strip the fleecy mother of her pride  And roasting fires th' attendant throngs provide  From deepmouth'd urns they pour upon the shrine  Their due libations to the god of wine  With grateful incense they the pow'rs invoke  And from each altar curls the fragrant smoke  The choral bands the hymns appointed sing  To thee O Venus and to Heav'ns Great King  Saturnian Juno heard her praise with joy  Her rage abated tow'rd the sons of Troy  Mars too was sung and then the num'rous host  Of minor gods who seats aetherial boast  Eneas with his hands to Heaven address'd  And folding young Iülus to his breast  Bespoke the boy "At length my only son  Our toils are o'er the task of war is done  At length approaches the long wish'dfor hour  To clasp soft quiet now within our pow'r  Soon as the morn shall ope the gates of day  To yon proud walls O wing thy speedy way"  Next to his friends he turn'd him graceful round  " Ye sons of Ilion everfaithful found  Too long alas we've strangers been to ease  The brunt of battle and the rage of seas  Have been our lot a scene of endless pain  Involv'd us all but better days remain  Our pangs are past our suff'rings all are o'er  Peace doveey'd Peace salutes us on this shore  For know Lavinia shall be firmly mine  And Trojan shall with Latian blood combine  From whose great mixture shall a nation spring  To give the world one universal king  Whose wide domain shall stretch from pole to pole  Where earth is seen or mighty oceans roll  Then dear companions with th'Ausonian band  In peace and concord share this happy land  The good Latinus as your king obey  For who more just more fit for regal sway  This have I fix'd by me be taught to dare  The rough approaches of invasive war  By me instructed suffer as you ought  Nor on the gods cast one unhallow'd thought  By heav'n I swear my friends so often try'd  Now wanton Fortune combats on my side  The toils you've suffered and the dangers past  Shall meet with ample usury at last"  So spoke the chief revolving in his mind  The various fortunes that attend mankind  Rejoic'd to see the objects of his care  Safe thro' his means from tempests rage and war  As when a kite in many a whirling ring  Intent on blood comes stooping on the wing  The anxious hen for her young brood in dread  The fell destroyer hov'ring o'er their head  Whets her sharp bill th' invader to engage  And urg'd by fondness conquers lawless rage  The tyrant flies nor yet her fears suppress'd  She calls each feather'd wand'rer to her breast  There shields them close and counts them o'er and o'er  And dangers overpast regards no more  Anchises son thus to his bands of Troy  By former woe enhances present joy  The perils past of battle land and seas  Are sweet rememb'rance to an heart at ease  For which the hero grateful homage pays  To ev'ry god and hymns the thund'rer's praise  The sad Rutulians their dead leader bear  And the last office for the chief prepare  The clam'rous sorrow catches all around  Latinus heard the melancholy sound  Presaging fears his anxious breast divide  But when he saw the wound in Turnus side  He quickly caught the epidemic woe  His bosom heav'd his eyes in torrents flow  In graceful guise he wav'd his scepter'd hand  And order'd silence to th' intruding band  Who came in clusters thronging to the plain  To view the features of the mighty slain  As when the foaming boar whom dogs surround  Rips up their gen'rous chief with mortal wound  The howling pack about the hunter throng  And seem to call him to avenge the wrong  The well known signals of his hand and voice  Reduce their tumult and compose the noise  Latinus silenc'd thus the clam'rous train  And a dumb sorrow dwelt on all the plain  The solemn pause the good old monarch broke  And the big drops fell from him as he spoke  " What scenes of various ills of care and strife  Await poor mortals on this sea of life  Pride finds in crowns her pleasures all compleat  Deluded wretch to call a poison sweet  Ambition hastens to the dusty field  Can death can dangers soft contentment yield  Th' example now is recent to your eyes  Young Turnus fate shou'd teach you to be wise  Beneath the glitt'ring throne that bears a king  Are poniards hid and aspies dart their sting  Few few alas a monarch's cares behold  He sighs in purple and repines in gold  Control'd to act against his own intent  And when he sighs for peace to war consent  " Ah what avail'd mistaken Turnus say  To urge my people to the lawless fray  To break that knot which sacred faith had ty'd  And war 'gainst those with whom th' immortals side  'Twas with regret the sword of rage I drew  For ah too well the consequence I knew  Oft have I seen thee on thy bounding steed  In burnish'd arms the willing nations lead  As oft my prayers have sooth'd thee from the plain  But sober prudence counsels rage in vain  " My cities thinn'd are nodding to their fall  Each useless fortress weeps her ruin'd wall  A sanguine dye once happier rivers yield  And Latian coursers whiten ev'ry field  Ah me what scenes attend Latinus' age  Grief devastation war despair and rage  " Farewel once more Ah Turnus where is now  That warmth for glory and that awful brow  That pleasing face by youth more pleasing dress'd  Now shocks the sight that once charm'd ev'ry breast  Ah me what horrors shall on Daunus wait  When he shall hear his Turnus' rigid fate  What stings of sorrow shall his bosom tear  And Ardea's sons their monarch's grief shall share  Yet soil'd with dust and grim with clotted blood  Cleanse the pale corse in yonder silver flood  Perhaps some ease his father's heart may feel  To know he sunk beneath an hero's steel"  He spake and wept and turning to the train  They raise the body off the dusty plain  Plac'd on a bier to Ardea's walls they tend  A horrid present to a sire to send  Shields horses swords the prizes of the war  Are borne aloft next moves the rattling car  Still wet with Phrygian blood Metiscus now  Moves slowly on and sorrow clouds his brow  Metiscus born to tame the gen'rous steed  Doth in procession Turnus' courser lead  The noble beast who ne'er before knew fear  Now shakes and drops the sympathizing tear  Full oft had he his daring master led  Where the war thunder'd and the nations bled  To death to danger never known to yield  The pride the fear the glory of the field  Inverted arms the foll'wing legions bear  And stuieks of sorrow pierce the yielding air  Thro' night's dull shade they march while Latium's king  Deep in his palace feels keen sorrow's sting  Foresees strange horrors widows maids and wives  Young men and old all anxious for their lives  Join in one shrill complaint thus surges roar  When press'd by winds they break upon the shore  Nor yet had Daunus heard his son no more  Should cheer his age or what his army bore  In sullen pomp approaching Ardea's walls  Another grief the pensive monarch calls  For while the Latins had engag'd in fight  And warlike Turnus glory'd in his might  Involving flames had seiz'd his native land  And Ardea's town was level'd to the sand  Beyond the stars ascending sparkles fly  And gleamy horror blazes thro' the sky  So will'd the gods perhaps the crumb'ling wall  In omen dread predicted Turnus fall  Th' affrighted citizens in dread array  Thro' flames and death pursue their dubious way  The shrieks of matrons witness their despair  And clouds of smoak involve the dark'ning air  As careful ants for future wants provide  Where an old oak presents her riven side  But if the ax the shelt'ring timber wound  Or bring its leafy honours to the ground  Among the croud what cares tumultuous rise  This way and that the sable cohort flies  Or as the tortoise broiling on the fire  When on her back unable to retire  With head with feet with tail declares her pain  And tries all strength and stratagem in vain  Thus Ardea's sons beset with perils round  And wild confusion no deliv'rance found  When from amid the flames was seen to rise  With clapping wings a fowl that cuts the skies  'Twas Ardea  Ardea the Latin name for a heron or hern  but transform'd and she e'er while  With turrets crown'd and many a stately pile  Now giv'n the city's name and mark to bear  On ample pinions flits around in air  Fix'd with dismay th' astonish'd vulgar gaze  Nor further fly to shun the dreadful blaze  But who a monarch's sorrows can relate  A monarch trembling for his country's fate  Doom'd tales of fresh affliction soon to know  Doom'd to a sad variety of woe  The solemn train approaches now too near  And Turnus corse beheld upon the bier  Black torches so their country's rites demand  Each sad attendant carries in his hand  A gen'ral sorrow seizes all the croud  The tim'rous matrons in afflictions loud  Pierce heav'ns blue arch their flowing garments tear  Beat their soft breasts and rend their flowing hair  But when the father heard his Turnus slain  He seem'd a statue fix'd upon the plain  But soon his sorrows found a diff'rent way  He flies like light'ning where the body lay  The breathless corse he held in grapples fast  And tonguety'd long by grief found words at last  " My son my son my age's last relief  Thy fire's late glory now his cause of grief  Prop of my age and guardian of my throne  Which totters to its fall now thou art gone  Comfort no more her healing balm will shed  My Turnus falls and Daunus peace is fled  Are these the trophies of thy vast renown  Are these the glories of an added crown  Are these the honours of extended pow'r  O Fortune giddy as the whirling hour  Man builds up schemes for her to overturn  We grasp at sceptres and possess an urn  And thou who lately a whole nation's joy  Didst drive thy thunders on the sons of Troy  Now ly'st an empty form of lifeless clay  Our hope no longer nor the foe's dismay  No more that tongue shall list'ning crouds persuade  No more that face shall charm each gazing maid  No more that form shall catch th' admiring view  Those eyes no more their lustre shall renew  Thy port majestic no one now shall prize  In arts of peace ah Turnus vainly wise  Mars crop'd thy honours in their vernal bloom  And ev'ry virtue withers on thy tomb  Urg'd on to war too eager in thy hate  Thou rush'd to sight and halfway met thy fate  O Death relentless thy unerring blow  Strikes down the great and lays the haughty low  Kings princes people his dread rigor fear  And shrink to dust when he approaches near  Insatiate pow'r among the old and young  Each day o'er whom thy sable stole is flung  Could not thy hand arrestone single dart  That thro' a son's has riv'd a parent's heart  Amata happy now at endless rest  Thy slaughter'd son moves not thy quiet breast  Say say ye pow'rs have I yet more to dread  What drive ye next on this devoted head  Ye crop'd my blossom in his earliest spring  And blazing Ardea flutters on the wing  Yet what is Ardea for my child I moan  The loss of him is ev'ry loss in one  Some woe superior was for me decreed  I have it now and am a wretch indeed  When once the Fates have mark'd their destin'd prey  Each various ill pursues him on his way  This way and that the fainting wretch is hurl'd  The sport of heav'n and pity of the world"  No more he said but down his rev'rend cheeks  In scalding streams the briny torrent breaks  Thick groans distend his breast his eyeballs stare  And all his looks are horror and despair  So when a fawn is from th'embow'ring grove  Truss'd by the bird of thunderbearing Jove  The hapless mother shakes with deadly fear  And gives what aid she can a fruitless tear  Now from the portals of the rosy sky  The morn arising earth born vapours fly  When good Latinus finding that 'twas vain  To try the fortunes of the warlike plain  For his pale legions shudder'd at the word  And almost wish'd to call Eneas lord  He much revolv'd of former breach of vows  The truce infring'd and longdisputed spouse  At length a solemn embassy is sent  A thousand men select for that intent  Commission'd these the virtuous chief t'implore  To waste Laurentum with his arms no more  To quiet hostile rage amongst the bands  And visit friendly old Latinus' lands  With these went sages vers'd in Wisdom's lore  Well skill'd to plead and princes stand before  Instructed to declare their king's desire  To accomplish what the awful gods require  And as they will'd that Troy and Latium's blood  Should flow commingl'd in one common flood  He yielded gladly to their wise decree  And wish'd the Dardans and their chief to see  Mean while Latinus cheers the anxious crew  Relates his measures and his pious view  Hope swells their bosoms and expels their fears  The news in transport all Ausonia hears  Now the glad city rings with peals of joy  And all prepare to meet the sons of Troy  Not in the plain in warfare to contend  But as to meet a brother or a friend  The royal court is deck'd with double care  Worthy the chief who shall be shortly there  The appointed envoys reach the camp design'd  Their reverend heads fair olivebranches bind  Of peace the token and their tongues no less  Of friendly talk the full intent profess  Within his palace Venus' godlike son  With kind demeanor welcomes ev'ry one  To whom thus Drances Drances first in age  And who 'gainst Turnus nourish'd endless rage  " O Trojan chief thy Phrygia's chiefest boast  In virtue first and mightiest of the host  Our royal master swears by all the pow'rs  Hear me immortals in your heav'nly bow'rs  That 'gainst his will the treaties sworn he broke  Or did to fight your valiant bands provoke  But inly wish'd to gratify the choice  The gods had made by his assenting voice  To give his daughter to thy longing arms  Lavinia fam'd for virtue as for charms  But if stern rage has turn'd his view aside  If seas of blood have flow'd on either side  If madding fury reason over came  O powerful chief let Turnus bear the blame  His busy mind disdain'd all peace and rest  And floods of gall o'erflow'd his ranc'rous breast  Long our Latinus stedfastly deny'd  To lend his troops and 'gainst his will comply'd  Ev'n then our armies wish'd the frantic boy  Would yield obedience to the chief of Troy  Our monarch too requesting nations join'd  But say can Reason bend the stubborn mind  Can human reason hope for weight or force  When not the gods could turn his impious course  In dire portents they spoke their will in vain  His rage renews he hurries to the plain  Where his reward the daring caitiff found  O'erborn by thee he bites the bloody ground  Ah wicked youth in Tartarus' black shade  Contract new nuptials with some Stygian maid  If rage and fury still be thy delight  In Acheron display thy skill in fight  But thou the happy heir of Latium's throne  Whom all our people their protector own  Whose ample praises are with rapture sung  Whose glorious deeds untie the infant's tongue  Our youth our sages and each sober dame  With one accord all celebrate thy name  That Turnus fell by thee we all rejoice  Believe not me but hear a nation's voice  On thee the Latians turn an eye of joy  Latinus waits thee O thou son of Troy  Forbear a while to seek the shades of night  In full expectance of the nuptial rite  So shall th' Italian and the Phrygian race  Join in one stock which time shall ne'er efface  Then haste great chief thy conduct be our care  To gain those honours thou wast born to wear"  He said the shouting bands his sense approve  And former hate gives way to newborn love  To which the pious hero smiling kind  Thus spoke the gentle dictates of his mind  " The rage of combats and past scenes of woe  Ye and your king are guiltless of I know  Turnus alone provok'd the martial strife  Lavish of blood and prodigal of life  A raging passion for delusive fame  Too oft we find the youthful breast inflame  Then tell your king his will shall be obey'd  With rapture I embrace the Latian maid  And peace eternal swear Nor till the pow'rs  Have stopp'd the course of good Latinus' hours  Shall his imperial sceptres grace these hands  But born a king he still shall rule these lands  Another city shall my Trojans found  Where added houshold gods shall bless the ground  Lavinia's name shall grace the rising town  And equal laws united bands shall own  May love and friendship spread thro' all the host  And Troy and Latium in one name be lost  What now remains but with a pious care  To burn those corses that infect the air  Sad victims of the war whose rav'nous hand  Smites mighty heroes and destroys a land  That bus'ness done tomorrow's sun shall guide  The happy lover to his blooming bride"  He said th' attentive people round him gaze  His virtues charm them and they shout his praise  Now see the busy legions all around  Trees crack'ling fall and axes loud resound  With holy zeal they shape the diff'rent pyres  And high to heav'n ascend the curling fires  Thick clouds of smoke mount slowly to the sky  A thousand sheep appointed victims die  The blood of swine impurples all the plain  And in the flames they cast the heifers slain  No more the field is loaded with the dead  And noisy shouts around the plain are spread  At length the sun diffus'd his golden ray  And all prepar'd to hasten on their way  Eneas first his fiery steed bestrode  And at his side the rev'rend Drances rode  Who much bespoke the chief the next to sight  Ascanius came in youthful honours bright  The good Aletes deeply worn with age  Ilioneus and Mnestheus worthy sage  Serestus and Sergestus pass'd along  And valiant Gyas and Cloanthus strong  In bands commix'd the foll'wing troops succeed  For so the friendly leaders had decreed  Now on Laurentum's wall a gaping train  View'd the procession moving o'er the plain  Each citizen exults with inward joy  To think the sword no longer shall destroy  Latinus from the town a certain way  With chosen friends to meet the Trojan lay  Nor could the croud the godlike chief conceal  The mighty prince his actions all reveal  High o'er the rest in graceful pomp he trod  Each action spoke the offspring of a god  Thus met the leader of the Latian band  Address'd the chief and press'd his friendly hand  " At length thou glory of the Trojan race  My hope's compleat for I behold thy face  To me at length the happy hour is giv'n  To clasp the choicest fav'rite of heav'n  With joy to yield to the divine decree  That here hath fix'd a resting place for thee  Long toss'd thro' perils here thy rigors cease  These lands these happy lands enjoy in peace  Tho' furious rage that knows not e'er to yield  Tho' Jove should frown has drench'd with blood the field  Tho' lawless licence arm'd her harpy claws  And wildly boasted violated laws  Yet I alas unwillingly comply'd  With tears not blood Latinus' steel was dy'd  Deceiv'd my legions fought and he who most  In Jove's despight attack'd thy pious host  Now lies a carcass on the barren sand  Victim of heav'n and of thy mighty hand  No more the trumpet shall awake to arms  Thy martial soul that bends to Hymen's charms  Some realms I have and towns my own I call  Fit for defence and girdl'd with a wall  Yet of all objects that my soul engage  Lavinia's chief the comfort of my age  She and her charms O mighty son be thine  In this embrace I the sweet maid resign  Dear to my soul thy virtues I adore  Sprung from my loins I could not love thee more"  To whom Eneas "When that rev'rend head  Meets my glad sight by hoary Time o'erspread  I soon conclude that battle's stubborn rage  Was ne'er the option of thy prudent age  If thou hast fears oh give them to the wind  In thee oh monarch I a father find  Believe thy son when'er that form I view  The thoughts of good Anchises rise anew  Again his figure in full sight appears  And filial duty melts me into tears"  Now to the palace hastes the royal pair  The Latian crowd confess the strangers fair  Maids women boys and hoary sires combine  To praise the beauties of their guests divine  But chief Eneas struck their wond'rous eyes  His fair demeanour and superior size  Caught ev'ry gazer and sincere their praise  Attends the chief who bless with peace their days  As when long rains have drench'd the genial plain  In gloomy sadness sits each pensive swain  With arms infolded and dejected brow  The farmer weeps his unavailing plow  But clad in splendor should the sun arise  And pour his golden glories thro' the skies  They haste exulting to their honest care  And wound earth's bosom with the crooked share  So the Ausonians lull'd their mind to ease  And shout and revel at the approach of peace  Latinus now had reach'd the palace gate  Eneas joins Iülus swells the state  Trojans Italians march in pomp along  And the court brightens with a noble throng  By matrons circled and by virgins led  Appear'd the partner of Eneas bed  Her eyes like stars diffus'd a lustre round  Her modest eyes she rivets to the ground  Soon as the Trojan saw the beauteous maid  He gaz'd he lov'd and thus in secret said  " I blame not Turnus thy ambitious rage  For such a prize who'd not in war engage  To taste such beauties such transcendent charms  Kings rouse the nations and the world's in arms"  The sacred priest fast by the altar stands  And joins in marriagebond their plighted hands  With peals of joy the vaulted roofs resound  And Hymeneal songs are wafted all around  And now Achates by his prince foretaught  From out the camp the various presents brought  Vests work'd with gold which Hector's consort gave  Ere yet the Greeks had cross'd the briny wave  A collar too whose gems emitted flame  And once the honour of the princely dame  Nor was forgot a bowl insculptur'd high  Pond'ious to bear and beauteous to the eye  Which on Anchises' board did whilom blaze  The gift of Priam in his happier days  This for Latinus good Achates brings  Such royal presents kings may send to kings  But the gay robes and collar's radiant pride  Are justly destin'd for the blooming bride  Now converse sweet and joy without allay  Deceives the winged hours and closes day  The genial feast is serv'd in sumptuous state  For luxury at times becomes the great  On purple couches all the nobles lie  The taught attendants wait attentive by  From chrystal urns are living waters pour'd  And every dainty loads the regal board  Bright Ceres here provides her gifts divine  And the red god bestows his choicest wine  With eye attentive ev'ry waiter stands  And flies to execute each guest's commands  This serves the chargers that the mantling bowl  And crowds in billows seem to wave and roll  Latinus near Iülus at the board  Heard him with transport and devour'd each word  For in the godlike youth at once combin'd  The grace of feature with the worth of mind  His manly talk his observations sage  Bespoke a judgment riper than his age  Nor could the king withhold his honest praise  " Take this embrace thou wonder of thy days  Thrice bless'd Eneas sure the gods conspire  To make each son add lustre to the sire"  The banquet ended some their talk employ  On Grecian battles and the fall of Troy  Now of Laurentum's broils what shrinking bands  Fled from the foe or dar'd opposers hands  Who first broke thro' the ranks with furious force  And thro' the slaughter urg'd his foaming horse  But much Eneas and Latinus told  Of Latium's ancient deeds and hero's old  How Saturn flying from his offspring's rage  In fair Hesperia hid his hoary age  Hence Latium call'd he taught to raise the vine  And the forc'd earth her bounties to resign  A wand'ring race and mountainbred he tam'd  By arts improv'd them and with laws reclaim'd  Again Jove seeks his father's realms to taste  Electra's beauties and the dame embrac'd  Whence Dardanus was born his brothers slain  By his own hand he fled across the main  From Corythus he fled with num'rous bands  And safely settled on the Phrygian lands  Proud of his birth he in his banner bore  The bird of Jove which after Hector wore  Much fame he won which time shall ne'er destroy  Th' immortal founder of imperial Troy  To choral airs the highroof'd palace rings  The torches blaze the minstrel sweeps the strings  Trojan and Latians to the sound advance  And mingle friendly in the mazy dance  For thrice three days in revelry and joy  They drown'd their cares at length the chief of Troy  To other tasks directs his curious eyes  Mark'd out by plows shall destin'd cities rise  Here form they trenches there dig ditches wide  When strange to say the Phrygian leader spy'd  A blazing glory round Lavinia's head  Which to the sky its flamy honours spread  He stood aghast nor knew what meant the sign  But thus his pray'r address'd "O king divine  Of men and gods if e'er my Trojan bands  Have unrepining follow'd thy commands  Still thro' all perils or by land or sea  To thee have pray'd have sacrific'd to thee  If I have led them to these pious deeds  Explain this omen that belief exceeds  Ah may no dire portent our peace oppose  Be ended here O Jove our various woes"  While thus he pray'd his mother lay conceal'd  Behind a cloud but soon to sight reveal'd  Thus sooths her son "Thy doubts and cares give o'er  Interpret right the happiness in store  The gods predict Peace spreads her olive wand  And buxom plenty crowns the laughing land  The lambient glories round Lavinia seen  Portend the godlike issue of the queen  From her a mighty race of chiefs shall rise  Whose fame immortal shall ascend the skies  The vanquish'd world with pride shall wear their chain  Realms far divided by the seas in vain  This flame great Jove from high Olympus sent  Fame yet reserv'd is mark'd by this portent  Her share of honours let Lavinia claim  Call thy new city by her happy name  Thy houshold gods escap'd from burning Troy  Shall in these walls a double peace enjoy  With pious awe their kindly love revere  For know they ever shall inhabit here  With such affection for these realms they burn  That forc'd from hence again they shall return  No other climes their godheads deign to bless  Then my best son thy happiness confess  O'er Trojan bands thy legal sway maintain  'Till good Latinus seeks the Elysian plain  Then double scepters shall my offspring grace  Ruler of Troy and Latium's hardy race  One common law shall bind them all in one  No fell division and distinction none  Yet mark O mark what still remains for thee  The gods consenting fix'd the kind decree  Thy days spun out thou shalt not mix with earth  More honours claim thy virtues and thy birth  'Tis thine to enter in the bless'd abodes  Vanquish proud Fate and mingle with the gods"  She spoke and quickly darting from the sight  Streak'd the thin ether with a trail of light  The hero stood revolving in his mind  The various bounties which the pow'rs design'd  Peace crown'd his days Latinus yields to Fate  The pious Trojan rules the happy state  Full wide extends his undisputed sway  And all alike one common king obey  Their rites their customs and their will the same  As citizens they share one gen'ral name  And now the mother of each smiling love  Prostrate and trembling at the throne of Jove  Bespoke the god "Almighty sire of Heav'n  To whom the ruling of the world is giv'n  Who read'st mankind and seest the heart's intent  Ere yet the lips have giv'n the secret vent  Thy sacred promise let a goddess claim  A goddess pleading for the Trojan name  Didst thou not vow in pity of their woes  To ease their suff'rings by a blest repose  Nor can I tax thy promise made in vain  Three years hath peace beheld this happy plain  Yet think O Jove to sooth a mother's care  There yet remains a seat in heav'n to spare  For great Eneas who transcends all praise  Speak thy decree thine humbler suppliant raise  Past mortal strength his growing virtues rise  Too great for earth he ripens for the skies"  To whom the mighty pow'r with looks serene  But first he rais'd and kiss'd the Cyprian queen  " Thy mighty son and all his pow'rful bands  That much I love bear witness sea and lands  My arm hath snatch'd them from each peril near  And at their suff'rings Jove has shed a tear  For thy fair sake My Juno now relents  And to my grant o'ercome at length consents  Then 'tisdecreed his virtues shall prevail  Purge off each part that makes the mortal frail  Then add him to the stars should others rise  Of equal merit they shall share the skies"  The gods assent and Juno vex'd no more  Requests the boon she often cross'd before  Quick from the starry pole fair Venus glides  And where Numicus rolls thro' reeds his tides  She dips her son and washes well away  Each grosser particle of mortal clay  The part divine to heav'n the goddess bears  And the just prince aetherial honours shares  Him as their god the Julian race invoke  For him do temples rise and sacred altars smoke  THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT of his JOURNEY to IRELAND  To Mr JOHN ELLIS  By the late MOSES MENDES Esq  Dublin  July  DEAR SIR  BY the lyre of Apollo the locks

damnably dear  For  A parliament was held here in the reign of Henry IV called  Parliamentum Indoctorum  another in Henry VI called  Diabo    two parliaments fam'd which intail a disgrace  And have left their foul manners to poison the place  Next morning the fun with a face of red hue  Had clear'd up th' expanse and array'd it in blue  When I left the vile town 'gainst which ever I'll rail  While  Meriden is famous for ale  Meriden offers no humble regale  But near Mixal Park din'd at house of mean fame  And at night to the  Campus Cadaverum  was the ancient name for Litchfield on

Gothic cathedral new homage still claims  Nor refuse I thy due tho' repair'd by king James  King James II  I forgot to advise you the sky being clear  'Twas at Coventry first I ascended my chair  But alas on the morrow how dismal the sight  For the day had assum'd all the horrors of night  The clouds their gay visage had chang'd to a frown  And in a white mantle cloath'd Litchfield's old town  But at noon all was o'er when intrepid and bold  As a trainband commander or Falstaff of old  And proudly defying the wind and the snow  When the danger was pass'd I determin'd to go  At Stone I repos'd but at Ousley I din'd  When our reck'ning was cheap and the landlord was kind  Next morning we sally'd and Staffordshire lost  But not ill entertain'd by a Cestrian host  On the banks of the Wever at Namptwich renown'd  For an excellent brine pit our dinner we found  The wine was not bad tho' the ale did displease  And an unctuous desert was serv'd up of old cheese  But as time will not tarry our course we resume  And  General St George's dragoons were marching up to London and a party of them just came in when we were leaving it  St George's dragoons take their seats in our room  So travelling onwards with pleasure we see  Old Caerleon so famous o'er looking the Dee  Four days there we rested and blithsome and gay  Forgot the bad weather we met on the way  Then old Chester farewel till I see thee again  And can stroll thro' thy streets  The streets of Chester have shops on each side covered over which if not beautiful to the eye at least preserve one from the rain  without dreading the rain  May thy river  People are now employed to make the river Dee navigable up to the town  still swell better pleas'd with his charge  Than when Edgar was row'd by eight kings in his barge  Be the maidens all virtuous who drink of thy tide  And each virgin in bloom be affianc'd a bride  May the heart and the hand at the altar be join'd  And no matron complain that a husband's unkind  Let their bounty to strangers refound in each song  Be  Robert Barnstone  Esq  who used me with the utmost hospitality  Barnstone their copy they cannot go wrong  O'er the cuts of the river our tract we pursue  And old Flint in the prospect now rises to view  How strange to behold here our language is fled  To converse with these people's to talk to the dead  And a Turk or Chinese is as well understood  By these Roisters who boast of Cadwalladar's blood  As an Englishman here who is certainly undone  If he thinks to make use of the language of London  From Flint we depart with our landlord and guide  Who show'd us that kindness which courts never try'd  The castle where  It was at this place that Richard was prevailed upon to resign the crown  Richard his grandeur laid down  And betray'd his own life by surrend'ring the crown  Now the  Holywell  well we survey where  St Winifred patroness of Wales  a virgin of old  To all flame but religion's was lifeless and cold  When in vain princely Cradoc had offer'd his bed  The merciless heathen e'en chopp'd off her head  Hence the stones are distain'd with the colour of blood  And each cripple is cur'd who will bathe in the flood  Thus the rankest absurdity brain can conceive  Superstition imposes and crowds will believe  Turn from legends and nonsense to see a gay sight  Where the  The vale of Clewyn  meadows of Clewyn the senses delight  And excuse that I aim not to point out the place  Lest my numbers too lowly the landscape disgrace  At Rhydland we dine and a castle we view  Whose founder I'd name if the founder I knew  But our host gives the word and we hurry away  Lest the length of the journey outrun the short day  Now ascend Penmenrose oh beware as you rise  What a prospect of horror what dreadful surprize  See that height more sublime which no footsteps e'er try'd  There the ocean roars loudly how awful his pride  How narrow the path observe where you tread  Nor stumble the feet nor grow dizzy the head  If you slip not mankind can avert your sad doom  Dash'd against the rough rocks and the sea for your tomb  The danger is past and now Conway's broad beech  Fatigu'd and dismay'd with great gladness we reach  In a leaky old boat we were wafted safe o'er  Tho' two drunkards our steersmen to th' opposite shore  Here the town and the river are both of a name  And boast the first Edward who rais'd her to fame  There a supper was order'd which no one could touch  This too little was boil'd and that roasted too much  To his chamber full hungry each pilgrim retreats  And forgets his lost meal 'twixt a pair of Welch sheets  A castle hard by I with pleasure behold  Which Kings had long dwelt in or giants of old  But the daw and each nightbird now builds up her nest  And with clamours and shrieks the old mansion infest  We waken'd at four and our host left us here  As the worst ways were past so but small was our fear  We follow'd our route and cross'd Penmenmaur'sside  Where the prudent will walk but the bolder will ride  Still above us old rocks seem to threaten a fall  And present to spectators the form of a wall  Now Bangor we reach oh if e'er thou hadst fame  Tho' lawn sleeves thou bestow'st on my life 'tis a shame  There we cross o'er an arm of the sea and carouse  On the opposite shore at an excellent house  Thro' Anglesea's island we rattle our chaise  While the goats all in wonder seem on us to gaze  For be pleas'd to observe and with diligence note  That 'twas here first in Wales that I met with a goat  O'er roads rough and craggy our journey we sped  Nor baited again 'till we reach'd Holyhead  The next day at noon in the Wyndham we sail  And the packet danc'd brisk with a prosperous gale  We at ten past the  Dublin Bar  Bar in the wherry confin'd  Which swims on no water and sails with no wind  'Till near two we sate cursing in vain they may row  Not a snail is so sluggish nor tortoise so slow  'Till a boat took us in and at length set us down  At the quay of St George in St Patrick's chief town  Thence I wrote to my friend nor believe what those say  Or too fond to find fault or too wantonly gay  Who with taunts contumelious this island o'erload  As with bogs and with blunders and nonsense full stow'd  For believe me they live not unbless'd with good air  And their daughters are beauteous and sons debonair  Here tho' Bacchus too often displays his red face  Yet Minerva he holds in the strictest embrace  Nor the maiden is coy ev'ry charm to resign  And the ivy and laurel peep forth from the vine

While like Ulysses far you roam  Note manners and bring wisdom home  Your journey you depict so strong  Methinks I with you go along  Each town and city curious view  Famous for story false or true  If either 'tis all one for that  Because it furnishes with chat  And chat you know with wit's support  The tedious journey renders short  Yet sometimes proves toolong the way  When you're oblig'd to fast and pray  For dinner which perhaps you find  Not cook'd according to your mind  So trust to supper proving worse  Like Pistol then you eat and curse  Or else content with viands light  In study

his dear carnation rise  And wonders who can doat on Flavia's eyes  The lover sees unmov'd each gaudy streak  And knows no bloom but that on Daphne's cheek  While some grow pale o'er Newton Locke or Boyle  Miss reads romances and my lady Hoyle  Thus inclination binds her fetters strong  And just as judgment marks we're right or wrong  Fair are those hills where sacred laurels grow  Rul'd by the pow'r who draws the golden bow  But see how few attain the dang'rous road  How few are born to feel th' inspiring god  Yet all to reach the arduous summit try  From soaring Pope to reptile Ogleby  Among the rest your friend attempts to climb  But ah how diff'rent poesy and rhyme  The midnight bard reciting to his bell  Who breaks our rest and tolls the muses knell  Is just a poet matchless and

swell  Write off the raging fit and all is well  And yet perhaps to lose my time this way  Is better far than some misspend the day  The fatal dicebox never fill'd my hand  By me no orphan weeps his ravish'd land  What ward can tax me with a deed unjust  What friend upbraids me with a broken trust  Some few except whom pride and folly blind  I found them chaff and give them to the wind  Like a poor bird and one of meanest wing  Around my cage I flutter hop and sing  Unlike in this my brethren of the bays  I sue for pardon and they hope for praise  And when for verse I find my genius warm  Like infants sent to school I keep from harm  What time the dogstar with unbating flames  Cleaves the parch'd earth and sinks the silver Thames  While the shrill tenant  The grasshopper  of the sunburnt blade  A poet he and singing all his trade  Tears his small throat I brave the sultry ray  And deepembower'd escape the rage of day  Thrice bless'd the man who shielded from the beam  Sings lays melodious to the sacred stream  Thrice bless'd the stream who views his banks of flow'rs  Crown'd with the Muse's or imperial tow'rs  Whose limpid waters as they onwards glide  See humble oziers

 The passing bell the foul nightraven rung  No village cur here bay'd the cloudless moon  No golden sunshine chear'd the hazy noon  But ghosts of men by love of gold betray'd  In silence glided thro' the dreary shade  There sat pale Grief in melancholy state  And brooding Care was trusted with the gate  Within extended on the cheerless ground  An old man lay in golden fillet bound  Rough was his beard and matted was his hair  His eyes were fiery red his shoulders bare  Down furrow'd cheeks hot tears had worn their way  And his broad scalp was thinly strew'd with grey  A weighty ingot in his hand he prest  Nor seem'd to feel the viper at his breast  Around the caitiff glorious to behold  Lay minted coinage and historic gold  Medals  High sculptur'd urns in bright confusion stood  And streams of silver form'd a precious flood  On nails suspended rows of pearls were seen  Not such the pendants of th' Aegyptian queen  Who joy luxurious swelling all her soul  Quaff'd the vast price of

radiant ruler of the year  At length his wint'ry goal attains  Soon to reverse the long career  And northward bend his golden reins  Prone on Potosi's haughty brow  His fiery streams incessant flow  Ripening the silver's ductile stores  While in the cavern's horrid shade  The panting Indian hides his head  And oft th' approach of eve explores  But lo on this deserted coast  How faint the light how thick the air  Lo arm'd with whirlwind hail and frost  Fierce winter desolates the year  The fields resign their chearful bloom  No more the breezes waft perfume  No more the warbling waters roll  Deserts of snow fatigue the eye  Black storms involve the louring sky  And gloomy damps oppress the soul  Now thro' the town promiscuous throngs  Urge the warm bowl and ruddy fire  Harmonious dances festive songs  To charm the midnight hours conspire  While mute and shrinking with her fears  Each blast the cottagematron hears  As o'er the hearth she sits alone  At morn her bridegroom went abroad  The night is dark and deep the road  She sighs and wishes him at home  But thou my lyre awake arise  And hail the sun's remotest ray  Now now he climbs the northern skies  Tomorrow nearer than today  Then louder howl the stormy waste  Be land and ocean worse defac'd  Yet brighter hours are on the wing  And fancy thro' the wintry glooms  All fresh with dews and opening blooms  Already hails th' emerging spring  O fountain of the golden day  Could mortal vows but urge thy speed  How soon before thy vernal ray  Should each unkindly damp recede  How soon each hovering tempest fly  That now fermenting loads the sky  Prompt on our heads to burst amain  To rend the forest from the steep  Or thundering o'er the Baltic deep  To whelm the merchant's hopes of gain  But let not man's unequal views  Presume on nature and her laws  'Tis his with grateful joy to use  Th' indulgence of the sovereign cause  Secure that health and beauty springs  Thro' this majestic frame of things  Beyond what he can reach to know  And that heav'n's allsubduing will  With good the progeny of ill  Attempers every state below  How pleasing wears the wint'ry night  Spent with the old illustrious dead  While by the taper's trembling light  I seem those awful courts to tread  Where chiefs and legislators lie  Whose triumphs move before my eye  With every laurel fresh display'd  While charm'd I taste th' Ionian song  Or bend to Plato's godlike tongue  Resounding thro' the olive shade  But if the gay wellnatur'd friend  Bids leave the studious page awhile  Then easier joys the soul unbend  And teach the brow a softer smile  Then while the genial glass is paid  By each to her that fairest maid  Whose radiant eyes his hopes obey  What lucky vows his bosom warm  While absence heightens every charm  And love invokes returning May  May thou delight of heav'n and earth  When will thy happy morn arise  When the dear place which gave her birth  Restore Lucinda to my eyes  There while she walks the wonted grove  The seat of music and of love  Bright as the one primaeval fair  Thither ye silversounding lyres  Thither gay smiles and young desires  Chaste hope and mutual faith repair  And if believing love can read  The wonted softness in her eye  Then shall my fears O charming maid  And every pain of absence die  Then oftner to thy name attun'd  And rising to diviner sound  I'll wake the free Horatian song  Old Tyne shall listen to my tale  And echo down the bordering vale  The liquid melody prolong  THE POET AND HIS PATRON  BY MR MOORE  WHY Celia is your spreading waist  So loose so negligently lac'd  Why must the wrapping bedgown hide  Your snowy bosom's swelling pride  How ill that dress adorns your head  Distain'd and rumpled from the bed  Those clouds that shade your blooming face  A little water might displace  As Nature ev'ry morn bestows  The crystal dew to cleanse the rose  Those tresses as the raven black  That wav'd in ringlets down your back  Uncomb'd and injur'd by neglect  Destroy the face which once they deckt  Whence this forgetfulness of dress  Pray madam are you married Yes  Nay then indeed the wonder ceases  No matter then how loose your dress is  The end is won your fortune's made  Your sister now may take the trade  Alas what pity 'tis to find  This fault in half the female kind  From hence proceed aversion strife  And all that sours the wedded life  Beauty can only point the dart  'Tis neatness guides it to the heart  Let neatness then and beauty strive  To keep a wav'ring flame alive  'Tis harder far you'll find it true  To keep the conquest than subdue  Admit us once behind the screen  What is there farther to be seen  A newer face may raise the flame  But ev'ry woman is the same  Then study chiefly to improve  The charm that fix'd your husband's love  Weigh well his humour Was it dress  That gave your beauty power to bless  Pursue it still be neater seen  'Tis always frugal to be clean  So shall you keep alive desire  And Time's swift wing shall fan the fire  In garret high as stories say  A Poet sung his tuneful lay  So soft so smooth his verse you'd swear  Apollo and the Muses there  Thro' all the town his praises rung  His sonnets at the playhouse sung  High waving o'er his lab'ring head  The goddess Want her pinions spread  And with poetic fury fir'd  What Phoebus faintly had inspir'd  A noble youth of taste and wit  Approv'd the sprightly things he writ  And sought him in his cobweb dome  Discharg'd his rent and brought him home  Behold him at the stately board  Who but the Poet and my Lord  Each day deliciously he dines  And greedy quaffs the gen'rous wines  His sides were plump his skin was sleek  And plenty wanton'd on his cheek  Astonish'd at the change so new  Away th' inspiring goddess flew  Now dropt for politics and news  Neglected lay the drooping muse  Unmindful whence his fortune came  He stifled the poetic flame  Nor tale nor sonnet for my lady  Lampoon nor epigram was ready  With just contempt his patron saw  Resolv'd his bounty to withdraw  And thus with anger in his look  The laterepenting fool bespoke  Blind to the good that courts thee grown  Whence has the sun of favour shone  Delighted with thy tuneful art  Esteem was growing in my heart  But idly thou reject'st the charm  That gave it birth and kept it warm  Unthinking fools alone despise  The arts that taught them first

humbly his alliance sought  But cold by age or else too nice  None found acceptance in his eyes  It happen'd as at early dawn  He solitary cross'd the lawn  Stray'd from the fold a sportive lamb

neighbouring meadow carry'd  A formal ass the couple marry'd  Torn from the tyrant mother's side  The trembler goes a victimbride  Reluctant meets the rude embrace  And bleats among the howling race  With horror oft her eyes behold  Her murder'd kindred of the fold  Each day a sister lamb is serv'd  And at the glutton's table carv'd  The crashing bones he grinds for food  And slakes his thirst with streaming blood  Love who the cruel mind detests  And lodges but in gentle breasts  Was now no more Enjoyment past  The savage hunger'd for the feast  But as we find in human race  A mask conceals the villain's face  Justice must authorize the treat  Till then he long'd but durst not eat  As forth he walk'd in quest of prey  The hunters met him on the way  Fear wings his flight the marsh he sought  The snuffing dogs are set at fault  His stomach baulk'd now hunger gnaws  Howling he grinds his empty jaws  Food must be hadand lamb is nigh  His maw invokes the fraudful lye  Is this dissembling rage he cry'd  The gentle virtue of a bride  That leagu'd with man's destroying race  She sets her husband for the chace  By treach'ry prompts the noisy hound  To scent his footsteps on the ground  Thou trait'ress vile for this thy blood  Shall glut my rage and dye the wood  So saying on the lamb he flies  Beneath his jaws the victim dies  THE TEARS OF SCOTLAND  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR

scarcebeheld embattled nations fall  The fierce Sicambrian and the faithless Gaul  Tir'd Freedom leads her savage sons no more  But flies subdu'd to Albion's utmost shore  'Twas then while stillness grasp'd the sleeping air  And dewy slumbers seal'd the eye of care  Divine AMBITION to her votary came  Her left hand waving bore the trump of fame  Her right a regal sceptre seem'd to hold  With gems farblazing from the burnish'd gold  And thus "My Son" the Queen of Glory said  " Immortal Caesar raise thy languid head  " Shall Night's dull chains the man of counsels bind  " Or MORPHEUS rule the monarch of mankind  " See worlds unvanquish'd yet await thy sword  " Barbaric lands that scorn a Latian lord  " See yon proud isle whose mountains meet the sky  " Thy foes encourage and thy power defy  " What tho' by Nature's firmest bars secur'd  " By seas encircled and with rocks immur'd  " Shall Caesar shrink the greatest toils to brave  " Scale the high rock or beat the maddening wave"  She spokeher words the warrior's breast inflame  With rage indignant and with conscious shame  Already beat the swelling floods give way  And the fell genii of the rocks obey  Already shouts of triumph rend the skies  And the thin rear of barbarous nations flies  Quick round their chief his active legions stand  Dwell on his eye and wait the waving hand  The Hero rose majestically slow  And look'd attention to the crowds below  ' ROMANS and Friends is there who seeks for rest  ' By labours vanquish'd and with wounds opprest  ' That respite Caesar shall with pleasure yield  ' Due to the toils of many a wellfought field  ' Is there who shrinks at thought of dangers past  ' The ragged mountain or the pathless waste  ' While savage hosts or savage floods oppose  ' Or shivering fancy pines in Alpine snows  ' Let him retire to Latium's peaceful shore  ' He once has toil'd and Caesar asks no more  ' Is there a Roman whose unskaken breast  ' No pains have conquer'd and no fears deprest  ' Who doom'd thro' death's dread ministers to go  ' Dares to chastise the insults of a foe  ' Let him his country's glory and her stay  ' With reverence hear her and with pride obey  ' A form divine in heavenly splendor bright  ' Whose look threw radiance round the pall of night  ' With calm severity approach'd and said  " Wake thy dull ear and lift thy languid head  " What shall a Roman sink in soft repose  " And tamely see the Britons aid his foes  " See them secure the rebel Gaul supply  " Spurn his vain eagles and his power defy  " Go burst their barriers obstinately brave  " Scale the wild rock and beat the maddening wave"  Here paus'd the chief but waited no reply  The voice assenting spoke from every eye  Nor as the kindness that reproach'd with fear  Were dangers dreadful or were toils severe  THE EAGLE and ROBIN REDBREAST  A FABLE  Written before the year  BY MR ARCHIBALD SCOTT  THE prince of all the feather'd kind  That with spread wings outflies the wind  And tow'rs far out of human sight  To view the shining orb of light  This Royal Bird tho' brave and great  And armed strong for stern debate  No tyrant is but condescends  Ofttimes to treat inferior friends  One day at his command did flock  To his high palace on a rock  The courtiers of ilk various size  That swiftly swim in chrystal skies  Thither the valiant tarsels doup  And here rapacious corbies croup  With greedy gleads and sly gormahs  And dimson pyes and chattering dawes  Proud peacocks and a hundred mae  Brush'd up their pens that solemn day  Bow'd first submissive to my lord  Then took their places at his board  Meantime while feasting on a fawn  And drinking blood from lamies drawn  A tuneful robin trig and young  Hardby upon a burrtree sung  He sang the eagle's royal line  His piercing eye and right divine  To sway outowre the feather'd thrang  Who dread his martial bill and fang  His flight sublime and eild renew'd  His mind with clemency endu'd  In softer notes he sang his love  More high his bearing bolts for Jove  The monarch bird with blitheness heard  The chaunting little silvan bard  Call'd up a buzzard who was then  His favourite and chamberlain  Swith to my treasury quoth he  And to yon canty robin gie  As muckle of our current gear  As may maintain him thro' the year  We can well spar't and its his due  He bade and forth the Judas flew  Straight to the branch where robin sung  And with a wicked lying tongue  Said ah ye sing so dull and rough  Ye've deaf'd our lugs more than enough  His Majesty has a nice ear  And no more of your stuff can bear  Poke up your pipes be no more seen  At court I warn you as a frien  He spake while robin's swelling breast  And drooping wings his grief exprest  The tears ran hopping down his cheek  Great grew his heart he could not speak  No for the tinsel of reward  But that his notes met no regard  Strait to the shaw he spread his wing  Resolv'd again no more to sing  Where princely bounty is supprest  By such with whom They are opprest  Who cannot bear because they want it  That ought should be to merit granted  ISIS An ELEGY  WRITTEN BY MR MASON OF CAMBRIDGE  FAR from her hallow'd grot where mildly bright  The pointed crystals shot their trembling light  From dripping moss where sparkling dewdrops fell  Where coral glow'd where twin'd the wreathed shell  Pale ISIS lay a willow's lowly shade  Spread its thin foliage o'er the sleeping maid  Clos'd was her eye and from her heaving breast  In careless folds loose flow'd her zoneless vest  While down her neck her vagrant tresses flow  In all the awful negligence of woe  Her urn sustain'd her arm that sculptur'd vase  Where Vulcan's art had lavish'd all its grace  Here full with life was heav'ntaught Science seen  Known by the laurel wreath and musing mein  There cloudcrown'd Fame here Peace sedate and bland  Swell'd the loud trump and wav'd the olive wand  While solemn domes arch'd shades and vistas green  At well mark'd distance close the sacred scene  On this the goddess cast an anxious look  Then dropt a tender tear and thus she spoke  Yes I could once with pleas'd attention trace  The mimic charms of this prophetic vase  Then lift my head and with enraptur'd eyes  View on yon plain the real glories rise  Yes ISIS oft hast thou rejoic'd to lead  Thy liquid treasures o'er yon fav'rite mead  Oft hast thou stopt thy pearly car to gaze  While ev'ry Science nurs'd it's growing bays  While ev'ry Youth with fame's strong impulse fir'd  Prest to the goal and at the goal untir'd  Snatch'd each celestial wreath to bind his brow  The Muses Graces Virtues could bestow  E'en now fond Fancy leads th' ideal train  And ranks her troops on Mem'ry's ample plain  See the firm leaders of my patriot line  See Sidney Raleigh Hamden Somers shine  See Hough superior to a tyrant's doom  Smile at the menace of the slave of Rome  Each soul whom truth could fire or virtue move  Each breast strong panting with its country's love  All that to Albion gave the heart or head  That wisely counsel'd or that bravely bled  All all appear on me they grateful smile  The wellearn'd prize of every virtuous toil  To me with fillial reverence they bring  And hang fresh trophies o'er my honour'd spring  Ah I remember well yon beachen spray  There Addison first tun'd his polish'd lay  'Twas there great Cato's form first met his eye  In all the pomp of freeborn majesty  " My son he cry'd observe this mien with awe  " In solemn lines the strong resemblance draw  " The piercing notes shall strike each British ear  " Each British eye shall drop the patriot tear  " And rous'd to glory by the nervous strain  " Each youth shall spurn at slav'ry's abject reign  " Shall guard with Cato's zeal Britannia's laws  " And speak and act and bleed in freedom's caus  The hero spoke the bard assenting bow'd  The lay to liberty and Cato flow'd  While Echo as she rov'd the vale along  Join'd the strong cadence of his Roman song  But ah how stillness slept upon the ground  How mute attention check'd each rising sound  Scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray  Scarce trill'd sweet Philomel her softest lay  When Locke walk'd musing forth e'en now I view  Majestic wisdom thron'd upon his brow  View Candor smile upon his modest cheek  And from his eye all judgment's radiance break  'Twas here the sage his manly zeal exprest  Here stript vain falshood of her gaudy vest  Here truth's collected beams first fill'd his mind  Ere long to burst in blessings on mankind  Ere long to shew to reason's purged eye  That "Nature's first best gift was liberty"  Proud of this wond'rous son sublime I stood  While louder surges swell'd my rapid flood  Then vain as Niobe exulting cry'd  Ilissus roll thy fam'd Athenian tide  Tho' Plato's steps oft mark'd thy neighb'ring glade  Tho' fair Lycaeum lent its awful shade  Tho' ev'ry academic green imprest  It's image full on thy reflecting breast  Yet my pure stream shall boast as proud a name  And Britain's Isis flow with Attic fame  Alas how chang'd where now that Attic boast  See Gothic licence rage o'er all my coast  See Hydra faction spread it's impious reign  Poison each breast and madden ev'ry brain  Hence frontless crouds that not content to fright  The blushing Cynthia from her throne of night  Blast the fair face of day and madly bold  To freedom's foes infernal orgies hold  To freedom's foes ah see the goblet crown'd  Hear plausive shouts to freedom's foes resound  The horrid notes my refluent waters daunt  The echoes groan the Dryads quit their haunt  Learning that once to all diffus'd her beam  Now sheds by stealth a partial private gleam  In some lone cloister's melancholy shade  Where a firm few support her sickly head  Despis'd insulted by the barb'rous train  Who scour like Thracia's moonstruck rout the plain  Sworn foes like them to all the Muse approves  All Phoebus favours or Minerva loves  Are these the sons my soft'ring breast must rear  Grac'd with my name and nurtur'd by my care  Must these go forth from my maternal hand  To deal their insults thro' a peaceful land  And boast while Freedom bleeds and virtue groans  That "Isis taught rebellion to her sons"  Forbid it heaven and let my rising waves  Indignant swell and whelm the recreant slaves  In England's cause their patriot floods employ  As Xanthus delug'd in the cause of Troy  Is this deny'd then point some secret way  Where far far hence these guiltless streams may stray  Some unknown channel lend where nature spreads  Inglorious vales and unfrequented meads  There where a hind scarce tunes his rustic strain  Where scarce a pilgrim treads the pathless plain  Content I'll flow forget that e'er my tide  Saw yon majestic structures crown its side  Forget that e'er my rapt attention hung  Or on the sage's or the poet's tongue  Calm and resign'd my humbler lot embrace  And pleas'd prefer oblivion to disgrace  THE NUN  AN ELEGY  WITH each perfection dawning on her mind  All beauty's treasure opening on her cheek  Each flatt'ring hope subdu'd each wish resign'd  Does gay Ophelia this lone mansion seek  Say gentle maid what prompts thee to forsake  The paths thy birth and fortune strew with flow'rs  Through nature's kind endearing ties to break  And waste in cloyster'd walls thy pensive hours  Let sober thought restrain thine erring zeal  That guides thy footsteps to the vestal gate  Lest thy soft heart this friendship bids reveal  Like mine unblest shou'd mourn like mine too late  Does some angelic lonelywhisp'ring voice  Some sacred impulse or some dream divine  Approve the dictates of thy early choice  Approach with confidence the awful shrine  There kneeling at yon altar's marble base  While streams of rapture from thine eyelid steal  And smiling heav'n illumes thy soul with grace  Pronounce the vow thou never can'st repeal  Yet if misled by falseentitled friends  Who say"That peace with all her comely train  " From starry regions to this clime descends  " Smooths ev'ry frown and softens ev'ry pain  " That vestals tread contentment's flow'ry lawn  " Approv'd of innocence by health carest  " That rob'd in colours bright by fancy drawn  " Celestial hope sits smiling at their breast"  Suspect their syren song and artful style  Their pleasing sounds some treach'rous thought conceal  Full oft does pride with sainted voice beguile  And sordid int'rest wear the mask of zeal  A tyrant abbess here perchance may reign  Who fond of pow'r affects the imperial nod  Looks down disdainful on her female train  And rules the cloyster with an iron rod  Reflection sickens at the lifelong tie  Backglancing mem'ry acts her busy part  Its charms the world unfolds to fancy's eye  And sheds allurement on the wishful heart  Lo Discord enters at the sacred porch  Rage in her frown and terror on her crest  Ev'n at the hallow'd lamps she lights her torch  And holds it flaming to each virgin breast  But since the legends of monastic bliss  By fraud are fabled and by youth believ'd  Unbought experience learn from my distress  Oh mark my lot and be no more deceiv'd  Three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled  When I was torn from ev'ry weeping friend  A thoughtless victim to the temple led  And blush ye parents by a father's hand  Yet then what solemn scenes deceiv'd my choice  The pealing organ's animating sound  The choral virgins' captivating voice  The blazing altar and the priests around  The train of youths array'd in purest white  Who scatter'd myrtles as I pass'd along  The thousand lamps that pour'd a flood of light  The kiss of peace from all the vestal throng  The golden censers toss'd with graceful hand  Whose fragrant breath Arabian odor shed  Of meekey'd novices the circling band  With blooming chaplets wove around their head  My willing soul was caught in rapture's flame  While sacred ardor glow'd in ev'ry vein  Methought applauding angels sung my name  And heaven's unsullied glories gilt the fane  This temporary transport soon expir'd  My drooping heart confess'd a dreadful void  E'er since alas abandon'd uninspir'd  I tread this dome to misery allied  No wakening joy informs my sullen breast  Thro' opening skies no radiant seraph smiles  No saint descends to sooth my soul to rest  No dream of bliss the dreary night beguiles  Here haggard discontent still haunts my view  The sombre genius reigns in ev'ry place  Arrays each virtue in the darkest hue  Chills ev'ry prayer and cancels ev'ry grace  I meet her ever in the chearless cell  The gloomy grotto and unsocial wood  I hear her ever in the midnight bell  The hollow gale and hoarse resounding flood  This caus'd a mother's tender tears to flow  The sad remembrance time shall ne'er erase  When having seal'd th' irrevocable vow  I hasten'd to receive her last embrace  Fullwell she then presag'd my wretched fate  Th' unhappy moments of each future day  When lock'd within this terrorshedding grate  My joydeserted soul would pine away  Yet ne'er did her maternal voice unfold  This cloyster'd scene in all its horror drest  Nor did she then my trembling steps withold  When here I enter'd a reluctant guest  Ah could she view her only child betray'd  And let submission o'er her love prevail  Th' unfeeling priest why did she not upbraid  Forbid the vow and rend the hov'ring veil  Alas she might nother relentless lord  Had seal'd her lips and chid her streaming tear  So anguish in her breast conceal'd its hoard  And all the mother sunk in dumb despair  But thou who own'st a father's sacred name  What act impell'd thee to this ruthless deed  What crime had forfeited my filial claim  And giv'n oh blasting thought thy heart to bleed  If then thine injur'd child deserve thy care  Oh haste and bear her from this lonesome gloom  In vainno words can sooth his rigid ear  And Gallia's laws have riveted my doom  Ye cloister'd fairye censurebreathing saints  Suppress your taunts and learn at length to spare  Tho' mid these holy walls I vent my plaints  And give to sorrow what is due to pray'r  I fled not to this mansion's deep recess  To veil the blushes of a guilty shame  The tenor of an illspent life redress  And snatch from infamy a sinking name  Yet let me to my fate submissive bow  From fatal symptoms if I right conceive  This stream Ophelia has not long to flow  This voice to murmur and this breast to heave  Ah when extended on th' untimely bier  To yonder vault this form shall be convey'd  Thou'lt not refuse to shed one grateful tear  And breathe the requiem to my fleeting shade  With pious footstep join the sable train  As thro' the lengthening ile they take their way  A glimmering taper let thy hand sustain  Thy soothing voice attune the funeral lay  Behold the minister who lately gave  The sacred veil in garb of mournful hue  More friendly office bending o'er my grave  And sprinkling my remains with hallow'd dew  As o'er the corse he strews the rattling dust  The sternest heart will raise compassion's sigh  Ev'n then no longer to his child unjust  The tears may trickle from a father's eye  THE GIFT TO IRIS  By Dr GOLDSMITH  SAY cruel Iris pretty rake  Dear mercenary beauty  What annual offering shall I make  Expressive of my duty  My heart a victim to thine eyes  Should I at once deliver  Say would the angry fair one prize  The gift who slights the giver  A bill a jewel watch or toy  My rivals giveand let 'em  If gems or gold impart a joy  I'll give them when I get 'em  I'll givebut not the fullblown rose  Or rosebud more in fashion  Such shortliv'd offerings but disclose  A transitory passion  I'll give thee something yet unpaid  Not less sincere than civil  I'll give theeAh too charming maid  I'll give theeto the devil  THE ROOKERY  OH thou who dwell'st upon the bough  Whose tree does wave its verdant brow  And spreading shades the distant brook  Accept these lines dear sister rook  And when thou'st read my mournful lay  Extend thy wing and fly away  Lest pinionmaim'd by fiery shot  Thou should'st like me bewail thy lot  Lest in thy rook'ry be renew'd  The tragic scene which here I view'd  The day declin'd the evening breeze  Gently rock'd the silent trees  While spreading o'er my people nest  I hush'd my callow young to rest  When suddenly an hostile sound  Explosion dire was heard around  And level'd by the hand of fate  The angry bullets pierc'd my mate  I saw him fall from spray to spray  Till on the distant ground he lay  With tortur'd wing he beat the plain  And never caw'd to me again  Many a neighbour many a friend  Deform'd with wounds invok'd their end  All screaming omen'd notes of woe  'Gainst man our unelenting foe  These eyes beheld my pretty brood  Flutt'ring in their guiltless blood  While trembling on the shatter'd tree  At length the gun invaded me  But wayward fate severely kind  Refus'd the death I wish'd to find  Oh farewel pleasure peace farewel  And with the gory raven dwell  Was it for this I shun'd retreat  And fix'd near man my social seat  For this destroy'd the insect train  That eat unseen the infant grain  For this with many an honest note  Issuing from my artless throat  I chear'd my lady list'ning near  Working in her elbow chair  A RECEIPT how to make L'EAU DE VIE  By the late Mr CHARLES KING  WRITTEN AT THE DESIRE OF A LADY  GROWN old and grown stupid you just think me fit  To transcribe from my grandmother's book a receipt  And a comfort it is to a wight in distress  He's of some little usebut he can't be of less  Were greater his talentsyou might ever command  His head"that's worth nought"then his heart and his hand  So your mandate obeying he sends you d'ye see  The genuine receipt to make L'eau de la vie  Take seven large lemons and pare them as thin  As a wafer or what is yet thinner your skin  A quart of French brandy or rum is still better  For you ne'er in receipts should stick close to the letter  Six ounces of sugar next take and pray mind  The sugar must be the best doublerefin'd  Boil the sugar in near half a pint of spring water  In the neat silver saucepan you bought for your daughter  But be sure that the syrup you carefully skim  While the scum as 'tis call'd rises up to the brim  The fourth part of a pint you next must allow  Of new milk made as warm as it comes from the cow  Put the rinds of the lemons the milk and the syrup  With the rum in a jar and give 'em a stir up  And if you approve it you may add some perfume  Goastone or whatever you like in its room  Let it stand thus three daysbut remember to shake it  And the closer you stop it the richer you make it  Then filter'd thro' paper 'twill sparkle and rise  Be as soft as your lips and as bright as your eyes  Last bottle it up and believe me the vicar  Of E himself ne'er drank better liquor  In a word it excels by a million of odds  The nectar your sister presents to the Gods  DAY A PASTORAL  Carpe diem  HOR  BY MR CUNNINGHAM  MORNING  I  IN the barn the tenant cock  Close to partlet perch'd on high  Briskly crows the shepherd's clock  Jocund that the morning's nigh  II  Swiftly from the mountain's brow  Shadows nurs'd by night retire  And the peeping sunbeam now  Paints with gold the village spire  III  Philomel forsakes the thorn  Plaintive where she prates at night  And the lark to meet the morn  So ars beyond the shepherd's sight  IV  From the lowroof'd cottage ridge  See the chatt'ring swallow spring  Darting through the onearch'd bridge  Quick she dips her dappled wing  V  Now the pinetree's waving top  Gently greets the morning gale  Kidlings now begin to crop  Daisies on the dewy dale  VI  From the balmy sweets uncloy'd  Restless till her task be done  Now the busy bee's employ'd  Sipping dew before the sun  VII  Trickling through the crevic'd rock  Where the limpid stream distils  Sweet refreshment waits the flock  When 'tis sundrove from the hills  VIII  Colin's for the promis'd corn  Ere the harvest hopes are ripe  Anxiouswhilst the huntsman's horn  Boldly sounding drowns his pipe  IX  SweetO sweet warbling throng  On the white emblossom'd spray  Nature's universal song  Echos to the rising day  NOON  X  FERVID on the glitt'ring flood  Now the noontide radiance glows  Drooping o'er its infant bud  Not a dewdrop's left the rose  XI  By the brook the shepherd dines  From the fierce meridian heat  Shelter'd by the branching pines  Pendant o'er his grassy seat  XII  Now the flock forsakes the glade  Where uncheck'd the sunbeams fall  Sure to find a pleasing shade  By the ivy'd abbey wall  XIII  Echo in her airy round  O'er the river rock and hill  Cannot catch a single sound  Save the clack of yonder mill  XIV  Cattle court the zephyrs bland  Where the streamlet wanders cool  Or with languid silence stand  Midway in the marshy pool  XV  But from mountain dell or stream  Not a flutt'ring zephyr springs  Fearful lest the noontide beam  Scorch its soft its silken wings  XVI  Not a leaf has leave to stir  Nature's lull'dsereneand still  Quiet e'en the shepherd's cur  Sleeping on the heathclad hill  XVII  Languid is the landscape round  Till the fresh descending shower  Grateful to the thirsty ground  Raises ev'ry fainting flower  XVIII  Now the hillthe hedgeis green  Now the warblers' throats in tune  Blithsome is the verdant scene  Brighten'd by the beams of Noon  EVENING  XIX  O'ER the heath the heifer strays  Freethe surrow'd task is done  Now the village windows blaze  Burnish'd by the setting sun  XX  Now he sets behind the hill  Sinking from a golden sky  Can the pencil's mimic skill  Copy the refulgent dye  XXI  Trudging as the plowmen go  To the smoaking hamlet bound  Giantlike their shadows grow  Lengthen'd o'er the level ground  XXII  Where the rising forest spreads  Shelter for the lordly dome  To their high built airy beds  See the rooks returning home  XXIII  As the lark with vary'd tune  Carols to the evening loud  Mark the mild resplendent moon  Breaking through a parted cloud  XXIV  Now the hermit howlet peeps  From the barn or twisted brake  And the blue mist slowly creeps  Curling on the silver lake  XXV  As the trout in speckled pride  Playful from its bosom springs  To the banks a ruffled tide  Verges im successive rings  XXVI  Tripping through the silken grass  O'er the pathdivided dale  Mark the rosecomplexion'd lass  With her wellpois'd milken pail  XXVII  Linnets with unnumber'd notes  And the cuckow bird with two  Tuning sweet their mellow throats  Bid the setting sun adieu  CONTENT  A PASTORAL  BY THE SAME  I  O'ER moorlands and mountains rude barren and bare  As wilder'd and weary'd I roam  A gentle young shepherdess sees my despair  And leads meo'er lawnsto her home  Yellow sheafs from rich Ceres her cottage had crown'd  Green rushes were strew'd on her floor  Her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round  And deck'd the sod seats at her door  II  We sate ourselves down to a cooling repast  Fresh fruits and she cull'd me the best  While thrown from my guard by some glances she cast  Love slily stole into my breast  I told my soft wishes she sweetly reply'd  Ye virgins her voice was divine  I've rich ones rejected and great ones deny'd  But take me fond shepherdI'm thine  III  Her air was so modest her aspect so meek  So simple yet sweet were her charms  I kiss'd the ripe roses that glow'd on her cheek  And lock'd the lov'd maid in my arms  Now jocund together we tend a few sheep  And if by yon prattler the stream  Reclin'd on her bosom I sink into sleep  Her image still  oftens my dream  IV  Together we range o'er the slow rising hills  Delighted with pastoral views  Or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distils  And point out new themes for my muse  To pomp or proud titles she ne'er did aspire  The damsel's of humble descent  The cottager Peace is well known for her sire  And shepherds have nam'd her CONTENT  CORYDON A PASTORAL  To the Memory of WILLIAM SHENSTONE  Esq  BY THE SAME  I  COME shepherds we'll follow the hearse  We'll see our lov'd Corydon laid  Tho' sorrow may blemish the verse  Yet let a sad tribute be paid  They call'd him the pride of the plain  In sooth he was gentle and kind  He mark'd on his elegant strain  The graces that glow'd in his mind  II  On purpose he planted yon trees  That birds in the covert might dwell  He cultur'd his thyme for the bees  But never wou'd rifle their cell  Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet  Go bleatand your master bemoan  His music was artless and sweet  His manners as mild as your own  III  No verdure shall cover the vale  No bloom on the blossoms appear  The sweets of the forest shall fail  And winter discolour the year  No birds in our hedges shall sing  Our hedges so vocal before  Since he that should welcome the spring  Can greet the gay season no more  IV  His Phillis was fond of his praise  And poets came round in a throng  They listen'dthey envy'd his lays  But which of them equal'd his song  Ye shepherds henceforward be mute  For lost is the pastoral strain  So give me my Corydon's flute  And thuslet me break it in twain  MELODY  BY THE SAME  I  LIGHTSOME as convey'd by sparrows  Love and beauty cross'd the plains  Flights of little pointed arrows  Love dispatch'd among the swains  But so much our shepherds dread him  Spoiler of their peace profound  Swift as scudding fawns they fled him  Frighted tho' they felt no wound  II  Now the wanton God grown slier  And for each fond mischief ripe  Comes disguis'd in Pan's attire  Tuning sweet an oaten pipe  Echo by the winding river  Doubles his deluding strains  While the boy conceals his quiver  From the slow returning swains  III  As Palemon unsuspecting  Prais'd the sly musician's art  Love his light disguise rejecting  Lodg'd an arrow in his heart  Cupid will enforce your duty  Shepherds and would have you taught  Those that timid fly from beauty  May by MELODY be caught
