 An Enquiry into the Disposal of the Equivalent  IT has been the Subject of Debate for sometime now whether we should have an Equivalent in  Scotland  for such Payments as are to be made on a Coalition of the Nations but whether what was Proposed was Equal was really an Equivalent or no And the World has been long hurried with these Enquities  But now here arises a new Cloud and tho' 'tis not only no bigger than a Mans Hand but is never like to be bigger yet as it is drest up it threatens mighty things and this is what you shall do with the Equivalent when you have it  'Tis a little hard People that cry up your National Sagacity in their Arguments against an Equivalent in general should question your Sagacity in knowing what to do with the Money when you have it  To Answer therefore the Doubts of some and prevent the Objections of others I shall enter a little briefly on an Enquiry into the manner of disposing the Equivalent you are to have or in short Enquire how you shall employ the Money when it comes  And in general as to this Head I think the nature of the Payment it self and the very words of the Treaty direct Us to the use to which this Money is to be employ'd viz  An Equivalent  The Property here will have no alteration in its Denomination it remains an Equivalent to its last Circulation into the Chaos of the current Cash of  Britain  you receive it as an  Equivalent and you pay it as an Equivalent 'tis an Equivalent pay'd you for Money which by your Customs and Excises will of course be appropriated to the uses of another Nation after the Union which Nation therefore advances you the Sum  in specie  that you may not be out of Purse on their Account  When you have it you dispose of it  As an Equivalent to the  AfricanCompany  for the demise and dissolution of their Society there being Companies in  England  already embark'd in those Trades and double Companies having prov'd incompatible as in the two  EastIndiaCompanies  who if they had remain'd ununited to this time had been both ruin'd And the Members of this Company having by the Union full leave to come in to the said  English  Company as freely and on the same Conditions as  Englishmen  may It is agreed the  Scots  Company shall cease and for a Satisfaction the first part of the Equivalent is appropriated to be an Equivalent for the said Company by paying the Subscribers their Principal and Interest and so  ompany expiring sets them down just where it took them up and I think they ought to esteem it a very happy Landing and what without the Assistance of  England  they could not have obtain'd by Trade in Years  Another Head for the disposing this Money is as an Equivalent for the Coin which by the Treaty is to be reduced to the Standard of the  English  Money  I shall say very little to a Gentlemans Paper who is for having this Equivalent made good before that to the  African Company  as a thing of vast Moment to the Nation  If I understand the Dispute  one previous Question well discuss'd  will effectually Answer all his Objections and that is Whether there is not enough in the Equivalent that  Englond  is to Pay to Discharge both and if that be true the mighty Dispute drops of course and it is not one Farthing matter which of these two go first  I cannot but think the Gentleman that wrote that Sheet went on a Calcul of the Coin as false as he has done of the Equivalent it self where he mistakes Ninety Thousand Pound atone Clap and no wonder he is in such concern since he has lost such a Sum out of the whole just at his first setting out for he says 'tis  l    s  and the several Times whereas if I think right 'tis just  l    sh  I shall therefore attempt here two things Examine what the  species  of Coin are that are to be reduced And ly To make a probable conjecture at the Deficiency  For the  species I  shall observe the words of the Treaty say not the current Money in  Scotland  but the  current Coin of  Scotland and this distinction will immediatly lead me to this Negative  That you are not to imagine as some have very grosly done that the Forreign Coins which the Error of Custom the Disaster of Trade and the Searcity of Bullion have made current here at an extravagant rate should be brought into your Mint and be recoin'd and the Owner of such Money be allow'd the difference from the Rate of their present Valuation to the Price of that new Standard let no Men flatter themselves with such a Notion if this were true it would not only expose  Scotland  to innumerable Incoveniencies but might indeed soon eat up the whole Equivalent since as there must be a certain stated time given for bringing in the Money into the Mint all the Rix Dollars in  Europe  might be brought into  Scotland  the difference between their real and imaginary Value be paid in  specie  by the Publick and the Owner receive the new Money for the Remainder which difference would make it very well worth while to bring the Dollars from Abroad and carry back the  British  Crowns in their Room or may lay out the Money in any part of  Britain  in Manufactures Corn or Lead and carry them cheaper to Market than any Native of  Britain  can do it his Money costing him less than theirs does  This was exactly the Case in  England  when Guineas rose from  s    d  each to The Merchants in  Holland    Hamburgh  immediatly fall to buying of Gold and send it to  England  by all possible Conveyance so much as by the very Post and such was the hurry that had it held much longer all the Gold in  Europe  would have flow'd into  England  The Consequence of this was that the  English  Merchants were struck out of their own Trade A  Dutch  Merchant could buy Bayes at  Colchester  or Sarges at  Exeter  and send them to  Spain  and sell  per Cent  cheaper than the  English  Merchants that liv'd at the same Town The Case was plain the Gold which in  Holland  stood them in  l  to  l    s    d  and tho' at last it rise up to  l per  Ounce yet in  England  went for above Pound and so their Money cost them  per Cent  less than the  English  Merchant could buy for  From this Example I think 'tis evident that the Forreign Coin has no concern in this Reduction  If it had been answered that this then will be an immediate Loss to the Nation and to private Persons also I Answer  To the Nation it can be no Loss because when ever such Pieces came into  Scotland  the imaginary Value was an Addition to its real Value and so raised its Currency to the Credit of the general Stock And when ever it goes away again the Difference is only an imaginary Diminution and stands to the Debit of the publick Stock in the same manner and the general Value of  Scotland  receives no real Alteration  Money is a real intrinsick Species appointed by Custom as the Medium of Trade to bring Commerce in all its particular States to a BallanceSo much as its real Value amounts to so much real Wealth is in that Nation and this real Value is every where the same But its  Received Value  differs in the several Nations according to the particular Circumstances of those Nations as to Coin Standards Plenty or Scarcity of Money  These Differences are again reconcil'd among Merchants and all is brought to PAR in their Negotiating by adding or diminishing as the imaginary Differences in Value require between Nation and Nation or Port and Port and this is called Exchange a thing full of Nicety and which I take to be the best Accomplishment of a compleat Merchant  'Tis true the Rates of Exchange differ rise and fall according to the Quantities of Money that lye to Draw or to Remitt But this is a thing that depends so much on the Artifice of the Merchant or Exchanger that it has little regard to the real Differences of the Species and therefore it is not to my purpose  The next Negative relates to the Coin of  England  which is now current here such as Guineas of Gold and Silver Pieces of the Crown Half Crown Shilling and Sixpence These I presume shall find no Alteration here and being the same to which the Coin of  Brittain  is to be reduced there can be no melting them down for that would be to do nothing at all but melt the Half Crown into Half a Crown and a Shilling into a Shilling and so on  As to the Loss upon this Money it is impossible to have it Rectified by any Law or any just Equivalent given for it Since should any time be given for that it would make a wild Trade to fetch a Million or two of it from  England  carry it into the Mint demand  d per  Shilling and immediately carry back the very same Species again  I confess I should have thought these Negatives of no Use had I not seen abundance of People weak enough to imagine they should receive Satisfaction here from the Publick for all the Deficiency of the imaginary Value of Forreign Money  I could spend some time to shew Examples but I think it needless  England  made three Essays about Money and these are Examples enough in two of them they made no Equivalent for Loss and in the third they did and they exactly hit the Case  First  They reform'd the Guineas and gave no Equivalent for the Loss they sunk them from to  shil  each at one Blow and some rich Engrossers of those pleasant Manufactories lost great Sums of Money by itThe Reason was plain it was a Distemper in Trade and wanted a Cure every Man had a Share in the Benefit at first and every Body ought to bear their Share of the Burden and take their Chance for their Particulars  Another time the Parliament finding Trade opprest by a Flux of  French  Pistoles reduc'd them to  shil  each and for this there was no Equivalent offered for the Evil was of the same Original  And here by the way I must Note That it was not a Mischief to  England  to have a Flux of Gold either Guineas or Pistoles Nor can it be to  Scotland  if SHE had ten Millions of Dollars among her current Money But the Evil is these several Coins going There or HERE at an Advance in Price by which Your Neighbours always have this Advantage That They draw Your Goods away at the Price of all that imaginary Value  At last the Parliament of  England  fell to work with their own Coin Reduc'd it all to the Standard and Recoin'd it And then they allow'd an Equivalent to the ProprietorBecause now they did not Reduce advanc'd Value but took in the very Species At which time Clipping Counterfeiting and such like Abuses had made it really Deficient in the Species This the Government was obliged to and so in  Scotland  it will be of Course  Now the Gentleman that Quarrels at this argues this is a mighty Concern and is angry 'tis put off to the last or Excrescence as he calls it of the Equivalent since 'twill  Ʋndoubtedly be an Ʋnknown and Insupportable Loss and Hazard to the Nation  Now not to spend time to be merry upon the blunder of the Loss being insupportable first and then unknown I would be glad this insupportable Burden might be examined and I'll go the nearest way to it that I can  It is plain none but the Coin is to be reduced and when all the present Coin is call'd in I believe no Man will say it is likely it should amount to  lib Sterling  in Silver  Of this a great part is in the new Coin  d    d    d    d  Pieces and of these there can be no Loss if the Gentlemen who have carried so great a Quantity Abroad lately in  specie  should be pleased to carry away a few more there would be so few left as would effectually take off the Loss on that Head  As to the old  sh  Pieces and  d  and  d  and  d  Half Penny the Quantity is very small and all the rest is CopperMoney the deficiency of which cannot be much And upon the whole if this Gentleman will please to procure a Tack or Farm upon this Casuality I shall at any time bring him People that giving unquestionable Security to the Government shall undertake all the Loss and Deficiency and make it good to  Scotland  the Coinage excepted on the whole Coin of  Scotland  for  lib Sterling  If this be so then the mighty weight of insupportable Loss is at an end  I know it is enquir'd here Whether on reducing the Coin to the Standard the Prices of Goods Labour  c  shall not fall in all places and so  Scotland  suffer a Loss here which may be indeed insupportable and tho' I know a long Answer is expected to this mine will be very short  I Answer This is no Loss at all for this only Reason  There is a sinking the imaginary Value indeed but no sinking the real Value  The  Species  is not debased nor your Standard allayed and therefore tho' your Goods Manufactories and Labour seem to sink they really do not sink  'Tis true you shall buy as much for  d  then as you do for  d  now but that you buy for  d  now shall sell for as much Abroad as that you bought for  d  before and you shall remit Home at the same Price too  The Poor Man shall Labour as much now for  d  as he did before for  d  but then his  d  shall now buy as much Provision for his Family as his  d  would do before  The Landlord shall receive but  d  for his Farm that before pay'd him but he shall buy as many Horses or Houses Lands or Goods for his  d  as he could before for his  d  so that every way the Intrinsick remains the same and the Nation has no Loss  In Forreign Exchanges it is the same your Value is all over the World the same from  England  you shall draw without Gain but then you remit without Loss and which way soever you turn as to Ballance of Exchange 'tis the same thing because the intrinsick Value of the  species  remains the same  All the imaginary Inconveniencies about the Coin with respect to the time of Coinage may as effectually be Answered as this And the Practice in  England  is a Precedent to go by if the Currency of the Mint be supported by a small Sum of new Money before Hand there can be no inconvenience of time or stop of  species  therefore the sad Complaint the Author of that Sheet makes of Forreign Bills being Protested or Landlords ruining the poor Tennent for want of  species  of current Money is at an end  Indeed if the old Money was to be call'd in before the new Money was to be given out there might be some stop and for want of Money Trade might suffer some Inconvenience Bills be Protested and the like  But 'tis but keeping the old Money current till the gross of the new Money be delivered out it will circulate insensibly and not the least sensible hesitation be felt  FINIS
