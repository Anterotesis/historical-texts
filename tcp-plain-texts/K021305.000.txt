Price Two Shillings and Sixpence  TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE NORBORNE Lord BOTTETOURT The following  Poem  is humbly inscribed by  His Lordship's Obliged and Obedient Servant  HENRY JONES  CLIFTON  CANTO I  CLIFTON rich source of  Heliconian  stream  Thou teeming topic and thou lofty theme  Where art where nature leads the soul along  And taste and commerce crown the copious song  Where vast variety the heart expands  And giving grandeur opens wide her hands  With nature's noblest gifts regales the soul  Each part a paradisea heaven the whole  Where health where vigour quaffs the winnow'd air  And drives far off the ugly fiend  Despair  MY muse O CLIFTON would thy summits climb  And hand thy beauties down to latest time  To ages yet unborn thy charms display  In numbers lasting as the lamp of day  Would  Inspiration  prompt my proud desire  The song and subject should at once expire  How epic wonders here the soul delight  There distant beauties strain th' impassion'd sight  See rocks coeval with the world arise  Whose cloudswept groves seem waving in the skies  By ages furrow'd deep with timeplow'd mien  With adverse frowns with fractur'd foreheads seen  Whilst  Neptune  rolls his rapid tides between  See  Wealth  quick flying in the freighted gale  See East see West expand th' impatient sail  Here earth here ocean mountains rocks unite  And in harmonious discord give delight  There princely piles in classic taste express'd  In  Grecian  garb in  Roman  grandeur dress'd  A line of palaces o'erlook the town  That with a jealous pride the prospect crown  On different heights they stand in stately strife  Like rank and dignity in moral life  In various climax court th' attracted eyes  The objects changing as the structures rise  From pile to pile a prospect new appears  And now the hills and now the river cheers  See num'rous ships with sudden glance shoot by  The sails and streamers only strike the eye  Between th' embracing banks for ever green  They seem to move on land their bulk unseen  By glad propitious gales impatient blown  With rapid speed and motion not their own  See next a  Dundry  steeple on yon hill appear  Yon distant hill the  Proteus  of the year  From whose oftchanging look the watchful swain  Foretells the weather and avoids the rain  The blue aetherial hills see last uprise  In azure robe to meet the bending skies  Here pendent gardens with rich fruits appear  The rip'ning bounty of the lavish year  The temple rais'd above the group see sway  And all th' extended various view survey  Divine ambition in the choice is found  Nay taste itself mark'd out the sacred ground  With holy pride the lofty seat to shew  And reign exulting o'er the world below  Where some on others look with scornful phlegm  Whilst others look with equal scorn on them  With molehill malice dash the cup of life  An inch in difference makes the mountain strife  From proud comparison we quaff our all  That source of human sweets or human gall  At which the restless soul impatient pants  Begets her anguish and creates her wants  Oh frantic fallacy oh brainsick need  Shall thy sleek beaver make my bosom bleed  Thy better buckled belt make me repine  Or if thy nails be closer cut than mine  Shall I my lips with inward anguish bite  If thy black kitten's tail be tipt with white  Or if thy leeks than mine should greener grow  And make thy fancied bliss my REAL woe  Envy in courts and cottages will dwell  Nay climb to heaven itself tho' born in hell  In every living bosom lurks this pest  But reigns unrival'd in the human breast  On reason's throne usurps a thorny part  And plants a thousand daggers in the heart  THE moral here and natural world we see  In wise gradation and in just degree  Where all constructed for one system's sake  A happy heterogeneous prospect make  Where reason's scale from class to class can fall  And measure equal bounty dealt to all  Each lot can justly prize in fortune's wheel  But not from what we have but what we feel  FROM moral strains let my glad numbers soar  And yon coincidence with speed explore  Where strong extremes produce a striking taste  A  Gothic  building by a  Greek  embrac'd  In contrast kind the feasted eye to fill  And mark the summit of the social hill  Where  Goldney  acts the meek the moral part  And daily works new miracles of art  Where he like  Moses  makes the water flow  His gold the rock obeys but not his blow  His gold that conquers nature's hardest laws  And fountains from the rocky center draws  His well spent gold a twofold transport gives  The garden gladdens and the labourer lives  Such toils refresh at once the heart and head  Give taste a banquet and the rustic bread  Make nature wonder at her thinwove mask  And truth survey her own transparent task  The master's pleasure with th' improvement grows  In all the rapture that a parent knows  When wise discretion weighs th' unerring coin  And makes his pleasure with his prudence join  Then sweet ambition bids the heart begin  For genius feels a paradise within  And tho' at first her task may seem too hard  The accomplish'd wonder is its own reward  Then fancy triumphs when by judgment led  And wears the wellearn'd wreath around her head  Without a blush her own bright work surveys  Improves the rapture and enjoys the praise  A new creation lifts the admiring lid  Here nature looks abroad here art lies hid  O'er the grand form her mantle meek she flings  But ornaments are arbitrary things  Yet even there should fancy never stray  From nature's path or seek a wiser way  Art is but nature in her best array  With simple elegance she smiling stands  In blameless garb put on by  Goldney  's hands  Him genius taught the tasteful eye to cheer  With sober judgment whispering in his ear  As wise discretion rules the realms of wit  The happy medium here he happy hit  Where each bright incident performs its part  With inward rapture melts the master's heart  And each congenial guest with joy invades  The fountains grottos and the clear cascades  The tall parterres that lift the comely face  And yield at once such majesty and grace  With ev'ry growing beauty in its place  A minor  Stow  on  Clifton  's crown we find  In  Epic  meekness like its master's mind  HERE buildings boast a robe tho' rich yet chaste  The robe of judgment and of ripen'd taste  Convenience here is mix'd with manly grace  Yet ornament but holds the second place  To human frames these structures seem akin  With aspect fair while reason rules within  These domes discretion decks and fancy cheers  Palladio  's stile in  Patty  's plans appears  Himself a master with the first to stand  For  Clifton  owes her beauties to his hand  HENCE to the vale by mountain rocks secur'd  By nature's own immortal hand immur'd  The vale where skreen'd  Avona  sinks and swells  That warping leads me to the hallow'd  Wells  I wander joyful with unbounded glee  From all I raptur'd hear and raptured see  To where sweet health her farsought balm bestows  And beauty with rekindled fervor glows  Above this fountain of supreme delight  Two ponderous rocks surprize and please the sight  With bending brows of nearer terms they treat  Thro' countless ages essay'd oft to meet  With grey address the tedious courtship con  And wish the aerial arch would make them one  The nuptial bridge sublime their brows would join  Whilst  Europe  wonder'd at the work divine  Blenheim  should blush tho' high her concave swells  Nay  Venice  veil her bonnet to the  Wells    Her proud  Rialto  should no more appear  But  France  and  Italy  come crowding here  Can then ambition sleep when GLORY calls  The MUSE herself shall help to raise the walls  With  Orphean  sounds the work divine advance  And make the willing stones in order dance  Expand the joytouch'd heart enlarge the mind  And  James Lacy  Esq  the Designer of RanelaghHouse was consulted on the project of building a Bridge from Rock to Rock  Lacy  leave one wonder more behind  The groves on high their frequent nod bestow  And earth and water give consent below  Whilst ART stands ready with impatient hands  But gold demurring gold forbids the bands  That scrupulous wight whom lock'dup souls adore  He listens not alas to amorous lore  Who many a noble match hath marr'd before  THE walks see full see health disclose her hive  Whilst all the neighbouring objects seem alive  See bounty there her healing store unlocks  Breathes all her vital veins her genial rocks  Distill'd by nature in her richest cell  Where health sits brooding and her offspring dwell  With heaven in council deep for mortal weal  Where angels blend the balm and bid it heal  There love and beauty revel in the tide  There grace and vigour wanton at their side  That with more lustre make glad beauty glow  Than all the diamonds orient realms bestow  The cheek to vermil and relume the eye  And make disease that pallid fantom fly  From all his windings in the nerves and limbs  When thro' the laxed tubes he lazy swims  The sizy creeping tardy torpid flood  That long in hesitating lakes hath stood  With loaded bane to blast the balmy blood  With pining atrophy and spitting gore  And all the wastings of the vital store  With diabetes and its irksome train  And lifeconsuming dews and mental pain  Here health expels disease that deephid mole  Winds up the body and lets loose the soul  Calls virtue home with health in exile still  Revives th' affections and awakes the will  Bids love and friendship in the bosom play  And drives each dark dissocial cloud away  HERE art and nature lift the patient up  When learned ** guides the healing cup  The lenient friend can smiling health restore  When leeches frown and cordials cure no more  Would his lov'd  Bath  permit him oft to roam  And make the wishing  Wells  his happy home  With **'s balm his healing stores to blend  And be to virtue health and each a friend  Then virtue health their own glad growth should see  And like their friendships and their art agree  HAIL health thou harmony of parts and whole  Thou sweet consent of body and of soul  Who makes thy citadel the central heart  And sends rich succours thence to every part  Thro' aiding arteries and vivid veins  Thy virtue quickens and thy vigour reigns  The smallest parts remote they glad console  The smallest parts return thee to the whole  Thee goddess thee the grateful muse would sing  And dip her deep in thy  Castalian  spring  Hail thou fountain fair inspiring health  Thou soul of rapture and of reason's wealth  Thou purest bliss with least of life's alloy  Content and thee the crown of ev'ry joy  If thou art absent gold but grieves the more  And kings look up with envy at the poor  The scepter sickens at the healthful spade  And God maintains the equal law he made  At  Clifton  long the languid spirit cheer  And send thy vital cordials far and near  And call from either pole the patient here  THE festive rooms their aiding balm bestow  When music mingles with thy vital glow  And dancing kindles up the lamp of joy  Where care must never peep nor pain annoy  The ecchoing rooms to grand proportion true  The selfbegetting sounds the charming view  The converse glowing and the melting glance  Thro' all the mazes of th' inspiring dance  Bid joy and vigour in the visage blend  And love and friendship in the soul contend  THEE  Lysaght  lovely as the summer rose  On whom in vain the breath of envy blows  Thee  Lysaght  thee the muse would justly praise  On that high theme would fain exalt her lays  Thy beauty rises like the rising day  And drives the clouds of malice far away  The shafts of rancour at thy feet see fall  Thy beauty blunts thy virtue spurns them all  Victorious in thy march triumphant move  Arm'd by each grace each virtue and each love  These inmates firm these bright these strong allies  Reign in thy soul and conquer in thy eyes  The muse ambitious would exalt her fame  And graft her lawrel on thy envy'd name  THERE  Murray  shines that  Caledonian  star  In her illustrious sphere belov'd from far  She glads the glowing heart she charms the eye  Like  Venus  winding in her orb on high  Laroche  distinguish'd in th' inchanting maze  With ease with beauty born to melt and raise  The gazer's transport and the poet's praise  Bristol  in her may boast a nymph divine  And lot the offer'd incense now he mine  SWEET  Mosely  there adorns the brilliant hand  By graces molded and by beauty's hand  The finish'd frame a faultless shape can shew  A face unhurt by beauty's greatest foe  With tender hand he touch'd her radiant cheek  Aw'd by her air divine her presence meek  His visit scarce the lovely virgin felt  Her virtues made the tyrant's rage to melt  He durst not hurt the shrine where angels dwelt  Such  beauties  health are here thy sweet allies  They charm at once the heart the ears the eyes  TH' adjacent squares bestow their sheltering state  With proud urbanity they willing wait  Like city sheriffs at St  James  's gate  ASCEND my muse on eagle pinions rise  Wheel round the broad expanse the joyful skies  Survey th' enormous rocks that high hang o'er  The frighted billows and the sounding shore  And all the prospect on the wing explore  Let all the landskip in my fancy live  And numbers equal to the subject give  On proud excursion wider stretch the wing  And gather graces that at distance spring  With richest fragrance make the wreath complete  And lay it breathing down at  Berkley  's feet  Will he adopt the wellintended lays  To  Berkley  sacred and to virtue's praise  Will  Berkley  lend the muse his powerful aid  And graft her lays beneath his sheltering shade  With fostering influence lift her laurel high  From that illustrious stem to reach the sky  WHAT lofty mansion sudden strikes the sight  With awful grandeur and serene delight  With princely air that lifts the head on high  And reigns unrival'd o'er the heart and eye  Whose candid mien with manly welcome chears  Whilst all the  Mihi Vobisque  motto in the pile appears  Another  Windsor  crowns th' exalted hill  O'erwhelms the fancy and absorbs the will  With true magnificence elates the mind  By time made awful and by taste refin'd  THEE  Stoke  th' ambitious muse sincere would sing  To  Berkley  's high domain her tribute bring  His  titled name  for numbers is too hard  The  patriot  not the  peer  excites the bard  True  British  worth the honest muse would praise  True  British  worth not rank deserves her lays  Tho' honour's stamp first minted for the best  Is oft on dross as well as gold impress'd  In him the rank and sterling worth accord  Intrinsic worth  for once hath made a  lord  The  insignia  there let sharpest malice scan  The  title  owes its value to the  man    True worth and long roll'd down his claim makes good  Ennobled by his own and  Beaufort  's blood  SEE see what sense what taste with truth abound  In every stately groupe and grove around  With unaffected air and casual glance  That look like nature led by happy chance  Where  art  seems vanish'd from the  Epic  space  But leaves behind her simple robe her grace  In meek disguise so rich and yet so plain  O'erlook'd and lost in nature's nobler train  To dress her mistress out is all her part  With pure simplicity and sparing art  To give not hide her from the head and heart  BEHOLD the goddess stretch her lawful reign  With polish'd scepter o'er the hills and plain  O'er the tall terrace and the vales preside  Her scope magnificence goodsense her guide  With easy grandeur and untechnic mien  In form a woodnymph but in state a queen  How graceful there the gradual slopes incline  Like bowing kings or beauty's bending line  There  Phoebus  self from hill to hill might rove  Might wake with heav'nly harp the vocal grove  And  Juno  make the vale her rich alcove  Such keeping there such contrast bold we see  There beauties differ most there most agree  With thee lov'd  Stoke  what rival can compare  A country not a garden strikes us there  With native charms thy continent regales  With more true grandeur than at proud  Versailles    Where  fiction  nature's loaded face belies  With arbitrary masks and false disguise  Where simple  truth  the child of guided chance  Is lost in marvellous and vain romance  There magic miracles obedient stand  As when some wizard waves his potent wand  With stroke astonishing makes wonder stare  For  Truth  and  Nature  have no business there  AT  Stoke  correct see symbols list you like  True classic epithets that strongly strike  A manly character and meaning round  That mark and sanctify the story'd ground  An awful vestige reverend made by years  A ruin there its shatter'd head uprears  By taste imagin'd with a moral eye  Lo there the  Pyramid  invades the sky  Whilst heartfelt ornaments regale above  The fragrant greenhouse and the genial grove  By nature helmed with a gothic roof  To ward the sun in beauty's bright behoof  And hold the rude insulting storms aloof  SEE prudence here and pleasure hand in hand  Walk o'er the living lawns and fertile land  The vallies rich see stock'd with stately steers  Who look at distance like incamped deers  Who grouping gaze among the vales and wood  As erst the speckled longneck'd nations stood  For private ornament and public good  WOULD gold and grandeur lift the lordly mind  To wed with wealth the  love of humankind    Would  Britain  copy  Berkley  's noble plan  That friend to  genius  and that friend to  man    Then  title  should unenvied honours spread  Around th' applauded patriot's sacred head  The  arts  should flourish and the poor have bread  End of the first Canto  CLIFTON  CANTO II  AGAIN the muse attempts her towering flight  To virtue sacred and to pure delight  Where wide variety the soul expands  Exalts the fancy and the heart commands  From scene to scene on raptur'd wing would rove  Like  Maia  's offspring or the bird of  Jove    Enjoy the beauties that serene abound  With graceful forms above below around  The whole horizon fill'd through every part  With nature's wonders and thy wonders art  Where both excel where both ambitious vie  To charm the fancy and to feast the eye  King'sweston  there delightful various scene  The muse enjoys and reigns a raptur'd queen  With throbbing bosom and extatic eye  O'er all the subject ocean hills and sky  The saint perspective and the dying view  The boundless plan to just proportion true  Where each bright beauty spreads its tints abroad  In all the splendors of thy pencil  Claude    Where parts on parts reflect a lucid ray  That all the lustre of the whole display  Where harmony her happy order shews  In all the art that on the canvass glows  The plastic picture strikes th' astonish'd mind  The ships in prospect and the hills behind  The woods the mountains at due distance rise  In perfect unison with sea and skies  There light and shade their wond'rous strength impart  There nature seems to take the hint from art  THE vale incult by random robe see grac'd  With  Southwell  soaring to the mark of taste  Whose classic eye each erring stroke shall scan  Reform the model and improve the plan  To simple majesty reduce the pile  And bid discretion through the garden smile  Make truth and unity in all combine  And taste and judgment crown the clear design  Unnumber'd beauties thence attract the soul  That seem expanded to the distant pole  The outline endless charms th' insatiate eyes  Within that trait ten thousand beauties rise  With incidents above  Salvator  's hand  Of ocean air of forest sky and land  THEE  Blazwood  next shalt in my verse appear  In all the mantles of the various year  At once invelop'd and forever drest  Her winter vernal and autumnal vest  Thee proud assemblage of great nature's skill  Where rock and cave and wood and vale and hill  In congregated awful groupes unite  That yield at once both terror and delight  A lovely lawn that spreads both far and wide  Where thinsprung trees expand their stately pride  Invites the eye with hospitable air  There spring exults and summer loiters there  Thence to a sounding gloomy vale we walk  Where ecchos to responsive ecchos talk  A deephid gurgling noise the car invades  From craggy falls and murmuring cascades  With vocal streams invisible that glide  Where jealous shades the hoarse musicians hide  By nature taught to pour her notes along  In sounds sonorous and in lofty song  That all th' aspiring theatre can sill  The sounds sonorous toss from hill to hill  Now up the walk we tread with slow ascent  The rocky walk from nature's bowels rent  With story'd climax through the vale ascends  And here and there the visual ray extends  Lets in the object that at distance grows  And now a wood and now a villa shews  In contrast strong and high opposing pride  The theatre still travels by its side  With hoary verdure o'er the vocal brooks  And on the naked rock disdainful looks  From stage to stage we pausing win our way  The twilight brightens and discloses day  By just degrees revealing wood and lawn  And rises radiant like the rising dawn  A shining vision stretching far and nigh  With sudden blaze devellops earth and sky  Relieves the fancy and inchants the eye  Here  Farr  with inbred rapture may resort  And see his ships glad sailing into port  With  Indian  treasures on the current ride  To crown the prospect and enrich the tide  What nameless raptures must his joys renew  With growing taste at once and wealth in view  The harbour ships the sea the mountains shine  With instant lustre and with ray divine  Lo  Southwell  's landskip happy  Farr  is thine  There on the right a  Roman  camp we find  Lest by the lords and masters of mankind  Where coins and medals narrative are found  Those story'd registers from under ground  A moral lecture to the mind convey  The  Latian  glories in their last decay  May mad ambition's frantic boast deride  And human vanity and human pride  From hence kind nature opens wide her arms  Her pictures ravish and her prospect charms  From hence the sated soul forbids the sight  O'ercome and fill'd with surfeits of delight  Where erst the  Roman  eagles wav'd in air  Behold a peaceful growing pile appear  For friendly banquet in a  Gothic  guise  From forth the center of the camp arise  Which shall each sense with each regale supply  But feast for ever the insatiate eye  Thence down a vegetable arch we stray  A growing gallery with winding way  Where lovely labyrinths in mazes run  To the sweet rustic lawn where we begun  There  Farr  with willing heart can frequent blend  The connoisseur the merchant and the friend  At the rich genial board in each can shine  And make his converse lively as his wine  His three years toil with happy eye may view  And joyful guess what three years more can do  His lov'd  Lucinda  in her orb can charm  Her smile can gladden and her music warm  From forth the answering keys her fingers call  The soul of harmony that joy of all  Her measures like her mind are fill'd with grace  In sounds you hear you see it in her face  To  Tyndall  next the muse her lyre shall sound  To  Draper  brave by both  Minervas  crown'd  Athwart the down she waves once more the wing  Her muchlov'd  Clifton  's praise once more would sing  It's various beauties and it's lofty state  With all the villas that it's levee wait  Where  Tyndall  's stands above th' alternate flood  In peaceful pomp array'd belov'd and good  Was once the mark of discord and of blood  Of civil blood when bold rebellion reign'd  And nature's bosom with her vitals stain'd  A royal fort upon that spot uprose  Which thunder'd strong on freedom's fatal foes  When sell fanatic fury tore the land  And wrench'd the scepter  Charles  from thy just hand  Oh days accurs'd may they return no more  With crimes all spotted and with kindred gore  Let loyalty long flourish peace prevail  And  George  and justice poize th' unerring scale  Let commerce roll let  Britain  's trident grow  Her matchless thunder blast the foreign foe  Whilst each firm heart shall firmest aid afford  Like  Tyndall  's treasures and like  Draper  's sword  Who here high blest with retrospect serene  Enjoys his twosold wreath forever green  SEE  Redland  rising in harmonious scale  There order taste there truth and grace prevail  A plan so pure might  Stanhope  's eye delight  Where genius art where  Greece  and  Rome  unite  Correct and finish'd in proportion true  To feast the judgment and to charm the view  The fair domain the garden and the grove  Are made for wisdom's walk are made for love  A beauteous pile see built for soul sent pray'r  There saints might kneel and angels offer there  Lo  Kingsdown  next I view with heart elate  And  Reeve  's at distance on the city wait  With beauties different as their different place  Like courtly dames their awful queen they grace  There  Rake  supplies with ready hand the bowl  Who gives the banquet when he gives his soul  Unnumber'd charms the city sides surround  Lo  Bristol  shines by art and nature crown'd  Thee  Bristol  thee th' elated muse shall praise  And bind thy sorehead with unsading bays  Thee mart of commerce and of rip'ning taste  By manners polish'd and by wealth increas'd  Extended nobly with becoming pride  With streets with palaces both far and wide  Supreme adorn'd with fanes that lofty swell  Where sanctity may soar and seraphs dwell  Where holiness in beauty's ray may shine  And purity proclaim the space divine  Thy rich  Cathedral  fills th' expanded mind  With  Redcliff  fairest of the  Gothic  kind  To  Mary  's fane the muse would frequent climb  The station lofty as the form sublime  See both magnificent with reverend mien  See both imbellish'd with a graceful green  With copious courts and porticos of state  With awful air and ever opening gate  Frequent and full where fervor lifts the voice  And high hosannahs make the heart rejoice  Where piety on angel pinion springs  With faith to heaven with loyalty to kings  From pile to pile the raptur'd muse would range  And pitch triumphant on the proud  Exchange    Important dome that traffic's eye consoles  That grasps with wide embrace th' extended poles  Thou vital ventricle whence commerce slows  Where strength and wealth and warmest friendship glows  Thy gushing bounty  Britain  's monarch greets  His dreaded armies and his matchless fleets  Thy circulating swelling streams sustain  His strength on land his empire on the main  Thou second source of  George  's spreading same  Avona  next to  Thames  supports his claim  Next to  Augusta  shall thy column rise  That noblest aggregate beneath the skies  Thou source of public and of private joys  That all the monarch and the man employs  Each rank each order must thy influence own  From toiling slaves to kings upon the throne  Hail commerce hail thou gate of ev'ry good  Who swells triumphant like thy trading flood  Thy precious stores in countless value rise  They make us virtuous and they make us wise  They stretch out friendship's facil hand divine  To where new stars and constellations shine  On t'other side the globe exchange the soul  And form salubrious leagues beneath the pole  Thy means still equal to the glorious end  Make life a comfort and make man a friend  Bring home each cordial to the heart and head  By goodness guided and by wisdom led  The soul to soften and enlarge the mind  Make man to man in social office kind  M  sweet compassion with the toils of gain  And all the wants of sinking life sustain  List up infirmity with potent hand  And draw down blessings on a grateful land  Bright angel charity whom heaven loves most  Thou crown of man and  Bristol  's glorious boast  In her rich bosom rest thy radiant head  Her sick have solace and her poor have bread  In her rich heart thy vivid virtue glows  To sooth affliction and to soften woes  The almshouse here the lame the blind supplies  And there the hospitals propitious rise  The sick the wounded there forget their smart  Thy hand auxiliar to the hand of art  Removes each malady makes anguish smile  Whilst gracious heaven well pleas'd looks down the while  In showers of blessings thy oblation pays  Whilst soaring seraphs sound thy sacred praise  Here festive mirth at thy glad shrine we see  Here public banquets are but boons to thee  Devotion here invites the ardent guest  Thy fervors working in his feeling breast  With kind compassion and with christian pride  He makes his pleasures for the poor provide  Th' apprentic'd orphan rises on thy plan  The future citizen the useful man  IN the calm regions of the righteous rest  Oh  Colston  sacred name forever blest  Thou virtuous chief that mightier deeds hast done  Than  Pompey Julius  or than  Philip  's son  What breathing statues should thy worth relate  Or muse immortal snatch thy deeds from fate  Oh man belov'd oh parent of the poor  Thy matchless bounty shall thy name secure  That sacred legacy with time shall last  Nay shine above the stars when time is past  On thankful hearts engrav'd what thou hast done  Shall still descend from father down to son  That oral tale shall unmix'd truth proclaim  And let my verse bear witness to thy name  If worthy thee my numbers ought can give  If worthy thee my verse may hope to live  By thee long nourish'd let my laurel bloom  With vivid verdure near thy hallow'd tomb  WHAT grand magnificence on virtue grows  What squares what palaces have late arose  How wealth how taste in every pile appear  With still improving grace from year to year  Lo  Queen  's enrich'd by  Rysbrack  's  Roman  hand  See  William  's finish'd form majestic stand  His martial form express'd with  Attic  force  Erect like  Antonine  's his warlike horse  With lofty elegance and  Grecian  Air  To feast the classic eye and fill the square  NEXT lofty  Somerset  the muse demands  That high secreted near St  Mary  's stands  A laughing lawn in  Flora  's flowery gown  So distant from and yet so near the Town  Whom beauteous buildings regular embrace  A central bason see those buildings grace  A prospect pour abroad its wide delight  With  Dundry  ever in the gazer's sight  Officious  Dundry  waits you where you will  'Tis here 'tis there and with it waits the hill  Like  Paul  's high dome this tower attracts the eye  Is ever first in view is ever nigh  Behold a sweet expanse of hill and dale  A windmill whirling o'er the various vale  With silver malls that serpentine between  The waving margents of the flowery green  See beauty's line alternate sink and swell  See sweet variety each care dispel  There health and ease and elegance should dwell  THEE  Brandonhill Eliza  's royal boon  The muse shall mount at night's serenest noon  To spell the stars and meet the soaring moon  Or mourn the ruins where a chapel rose  That boast of reason and religion's foes  Or wrapt in visionary trances view  Cromwell  's grim shade and his rebellious crew  Reacting there with shadowy cannon's roar  The dreadful part they play'd an age before  When death set out with each destructive ball  Bid  Bristol  tremble and her temples fall  From that black battery on  Brandon  brow  The mark of mischief then and horror now  Or wak'd by soaring larks from that sad dream  The mariner's glad voice the dawning gleam  Shake off the spectres of delusive night  Enjoy the breeze and quaff the morning bright  And call no more that retrospect to sight  But follow fancy to the lunar sphere  Or mix with fairies that inhabit here  Deep in the bosom of the hill they hide  Or on the rainbow's radiant circle ride  Or mount on gossomers in troops to play  Or bask like butterflies the morning ray  Oft with their shapes they shift their insect sport  In  Brandon  's deep alcove they keep their court  With concert masquerade and rout and ball  Like human fantoms in th' aerial hall  The gliding shapes at music's soft command  In measures move whilst echo forms the band  In sounds remote from dull made mortal ears  Reflected from the music of the spheres  Assemblies drums and even cards are there  With  Tunbridge  toys with tea and chinaware  With eyebrow pruners dentists those that dance  The curlcomposing hand the finger'd lance  With fifty operators more from  France  Are here employ'd by these light mimics meek  They patch the forehead and they paint the cheek  The nice nicknack the love the toyshop trade  And who so merry at a masquerade  'Till wearied out with folly's whims they rest  Or laugh like reason at the toilsome jest  A wardrobe of each fashion there hath stood  In long array of mantle hoop and hood  And all the changing modes since  Noah  's flood  Which  Time  with moving finger oft hath told  And made them like his seasons new and old  Kind visits too they oft exchange at will  And slide from  Brandon  o'er to  Dundry  hill  Their airy coach the calmest gale that swells  They often swarm like bees about the  Wells    The balmy breath of beauty there they sip  Like atoms fall on  Lysaght  's fragrant lip  From cheek to cheek from chin to dimple fly  Now on the pendant perch and now the eye  Now on the shape divine and air they gaze  Now clap their little wings and joyful praise  In the gay dance they mingle with the throng  And on the streams of music float along  Our stormy notes their filmy fabrics shake  But bodies of condensed air they make  They rob the rainbow and th' etherial lawn  The plaited clouds that deck the crimson dawn  These to sharp fairy eyes appear from far  Like the first blushes of the morning star  With all the tints that vernal breezes bring  When nature wakes and  Flora  leads the spring  To houshold cares their thoughts they oft apply  But still on mortals keep a watchful eye  The ways of men their wiser thoughts engage  In registers laid up from age to age  These records deep in adamant are cast  As long as  Brandon  nay the world shall last  They still compare the present with the past  To faithful lovers they still lend an ear  The fairies love and have their loveplots here  The pleasing pangs they oft by turns endure  Like us they feel 'em and like us they cure  Round beauty still with viewless wing they fly  Weigh the young wish and watch the wand'ring eye  O'erhear the frangil vow the whisper'd league  With all the movements of the soft intrigue  To virtue still a faithful shield they prove  And in the sunbeam oft like motes they move  Unseen unheeded by the yielding fair  As honour's lifeguard they do duty there  When felon  Cupid  and the foe draw nigh  In fearful ambush when his arrows fly  And honour's on the very point to die  Their guardian task perform'd they silent glide  To  Brandon  back their subtle shapes they hide  On folds of lillies and of roses lay  Their little heads to rest and dream till day  Or rushing rapid like a whirlwind forth  They drive the dazzling dancers of the north  Those radiant bands their breath about can blow  And puff the bright battalions to and fro  These atmospherial files they quick can raise  And fill the welkin with a warlike blaze  Round  Saturn  's ring in frolic dance they play  Bestride the comet's tail and sweep the milky way  Through yonder vault the lightnings flash they guide  Then on the thunder's rapid vollies ride  They shoot the stars that glance athwart the night  Sup in the moon and safe on  Brandon  light  A THOUSAND rich improvements round me rise  And  Bristol  's newborn beauties charm my eyes  There embryon plans to ripe perfection swell  Which time shall foster and which fame shall tell  How letter'd taste its progress here improves  Which sense inculcates and which wisdom loves  The dawning mind would drink each classic ray  And pants impatient for a brighter day  Here science like the sun see radiant rise  With intellectual beam through mental skies  To gild to gladden all th' improving space  With taste with candor learning sense and grace  To light up all the mind's remotest cells  Where fancy fledges and where genius dwells  To bid the soul her own rich funds employ  Incrodse her treasures and her wealth enjoy  On talents and on taste propitious smile  To the proud muses rear a pompous pile  A theatre that erst at  Rome  might rise  When  Rome  was valiant and when  Rome  was wise  Where tragic scenes shall all their pow'r display  And comedy shall laugh our cares away  Where wit and beauty shall with rival rays  Provoke our wonder and divide our praise  There  Bristol  proud her daughters' charms shall see  Their polish'd charms the muses theme shall be  Her florid sons shall stand in next degree  In bright assemblies see them winding move  In all the measur'd modes of grace and love  In labyrinths reciprocal they roam  Whilst breathing beauties deck the beauteous dome  Th' accomplish'd pile invites with polish'd air  The wellbred letter'd youth the lovely fair  With chaste delight to meet and mingle there  The youth in every step new talents show  Whilst beauty brightens as the graces grow  HERE health and plenty crown th' adjacent plains  Whilst ev'ry human bliss at  Bristol  reigns  Here health and plenty in her presence stand  Here hospitality oft waves the hand  With social beckon to the genial board  Where mirth and friendship all their joys afford  And converse rises o'er the technic kind  By wit exalted and by sense resin'd  Here music painting gain alternate ground  With magic light and shade with magic sound  Where manners soften and where humour glows  Where virtue kindles and where friendship grows  Here wealth and wisdom with each other blend  And sense and taste in social strife contend  Here time leads up the rich improving band  On gradual step to ripe perfection's hand  Whilst ruddy commerce crowns her fragrant stores  With spicey treasures from ten thousand shores  Thy floodgate's wealth from both the  Indies  flow  Avona  richer than the  Rhine  or  Po  The world's vast tribute to thy threshold brings  On groaning bottoms and on golden wings  Each tide comes pregnant with a precious load  And wealth at  Bristol  makes its wise abode  'Till thence sent rushing through  Britannia  's veins  She warms  Europa  's vitals with her gains  Augusta  shakes with her the trading hand  They scatter blessings o'er a happy land  They bid  Britannia  break the tyrant's chain  Bid freedom flourish through the land and main  And o'er the earth extend great GEORGE's reign  HAIL happy fountains hailoh rich run o'er  With wealth and strength 'till time shall be no more  Bid  Britain  soar her matchless trident rear  Her glory circle with the circling year  Bid her high flag o'er nations yet unknown  Triumphant wave and make the globe her own  Her freedom laws from pole to pole prevail  And justice weigh the world in  Britain  's scale  Let faction fall let redey'd rancour end  Let discord to her native hell descend  And with her drag her black her bloated train  Her bosom scorpions and her inbred bane  With all the stings that in the soul abide  With meek hypocrisy and holy pride  Let fell corruption lift no more the head  But trampled freedom at thy feet lie dead  Let peace let truth advancing hand in hand  Let love let loyalty o'erspread the land  The olive high let  England  's angel bear  And time bring on her millenary year  Let seraphs in her councils oft preside  Her monarch whisper and her senates guide  Let Heav'n's own hand be  Britain  's strong ally  Let  Europe  tremble when her thunders fly  'Till nature sink and time himself shall die  FINIS
