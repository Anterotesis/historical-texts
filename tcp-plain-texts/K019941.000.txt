 AN EPISTLE TO  C CHURCHILL  AUTHOR of the  ROSCIAD  Telumque imbelle sine ictu Conjecit  VIRG  By R LLOYD M A  LONDON  Printed for WILLIAM FLEXNEY near  GraysInn Gate Holborn  MDCCLXI  ADVERTISEMENT  AS in Parts of the following Poem there is an Allusion to a late  delicate  Production it may not be improper to let the Reader into some Secrets concerning its Origin that He may know the Progress of Wit and how dangerous it is for young Adventurers to attack  Veterans  in the Service and teach them to pay a due Deference to all  distinguish'd Writers  An Author possessed of those happy Qualities which appear so  notoriously  in that Publication  viz  MODESTY DECENCY and GOOD NATURE has an indisputable Right to be believed upon his  own  Assertion and therefore it would be illiberal to doubt but that he is as he ought to be DISTINGUISHED This Ode then was  perform'd  by the  Maker  as a Coffin to hold the dead Bodies of those unfortunate Heroes slain by his redoubtable Pen A Gentleman it seems  unhappily differ'd in Opinion with our Champion and express'd his Sentiments in a Paper call'd the  Craftsman  Outsallies the vindictive Knight I should say Squire to use his own Language  does him  slaps him into the Coffin where he laid quietly for some Months till a second  Paroxysm  of Indignation produced a second Murder and the former Body was obliged to give Place to the latter The Coffin is nailed down the Plate alter'd and the brazen Inscription informs us C CHURCHILL died the  th  of  June    HAPPY is the Man that is always prepared for his Enemy and has "his NAIADS by him  ready made"  It must be allowed that this Gentleman has made huge Strides towards Parnassus and hath strangely walk'd over all our Heads I wish him Joy of having exalted himself to the Pinnacle of this aery Mountain but beg Leave to remind him that People sometimes  tolluntur in altum  Ut lapsu graviore cadant  An EPISTLE to  C CHURCHILL  _IF at a Tavern where you'd wish to dine  They cheat your Palate with adulterate Wine  Would you resolve me Critics for you can  Send for the Master up or chide the Man  The Man no doubt a knavish Business drives  But tell me what's the Master who connives  Hence you'll infer and sure the Doctrine's true  Which says no Quarter to a foul Review  It matters not who vends the nauseous slop  Master or Prentice we detest the Shop  CRITICS of old a manly liberal Race  Approv'd or censur'd with an open Face  Boldly persu'd the free decisive Task  Nor stabb'd conceal'd beneath a Ruffian's Mask  To Works not Men with honest Warmth severe  Th'impartial Judges laugh'd at Hope or Fear  Theirs was the noble Skill with gen'rous Aim  To fan true Genius to an active Flame  To bring forth Merit in its strongest Light  Or damn the Blockhead to his native Night  BUT as all States are subject to Decay  The State of Letters too will melt away  Smit with the Harlot Charms of trilling Sound  Softness now wantons e'en on  Roman  Ground  Where  Thebans Spartans  sought their honour'd Graves  Behold a weak enervate Race of Slaves  In Classic Lore deep Science Language dead  Tho' modern Witlings are but scantly read  Professors  The Author takes this Opportunity notwithstanding all Insinuations to the contrary to declare that he has no particular Aim at a Gentleman whose Abilities he sufficiently acknowledges  fail not who will loudly bawl  In Praise of either with the Want of all  Hail'd mighty Critics to this present Hour  The Tribune's Name surviv'd the Tribune's Pow'r  Now Quack and Critic differ but in Name  Empirics frontless both they mean the same  This raw in Physic that in Letters fresh  Both spring like Warts Excrescence from the Flesh  Half form'd half bred in Printers' hireling Schools  For all Professions have their Rogues and Fools  Tho' the pert Witling or the coward Knave  Casts no Reflection on the Wise or Brave  YET in these leaden Times this idle Age  When blind with Dulness or as blind with Rage  Author 'gainst Author rails with Venom curst  And happy He who calls out Blockhead first  From the low Earth aspiring Genius springs  And sails triumphant born on Eagle Wings  No toothless Spleen no venom'd Critic's aim  Shall rob thee CHURCHILL of thy proper Fame  While hitch'd for ever in thy nervous Rime  Fool lives and shines out Fool to latest Time  PITY perhaps might with a harmless Fool  To scape the Observance of the Critic School  But if low Malice leagu'd with Folly rise  Arm'd with Invectives and hedg'd round with Lies  Should wakeful Dulness if she ever wake  Write sleepy Nonsense but for Writing Sake  And stung with Rage and piously severe  Wish bitter Comforts to your dying Ear  If some small Wit some sixlin'd Verseman rakes  For quaint Reflections in the putrid Jakes  Talents usurp'd demand a Censor's Rage  A Dunce is Dunce proscrib'd in ev'ry Age  COURTIER Physician Lawyer Parson Cit  All all are Objects of Theatric Wit  Are ye then Actors priviledg'd alone  To make that Weapon Ridicule your own  Professions bleed not from his just Attack  Who laughs at Pedant Coxcomb Knave or Quack  Fools on and off the Stage are Fools the same  And every Dunce is Satire's lawful Game  Freely you thought where Thought has free'st Room  Why then apologize for what to whom  THOUGH  GraysInn  Wits with Author  Squire  's unite  And selfmade Giants club their labour'd Mite  Though pointless Satire make its weak Escape  In the dull Babble of a mimic Ape  Boldly persue where Genius points the Way  Nor heed what monthly puny Critics say  Firm in thyself with calm Indifference smile  When the wise  Vet'ran  knows you by your Stile  With critic Scales weighs out the partial Wit  What I or You or He or no one writ  Denying thee thy just and proper Worth  But to give Falshood's spurious Issue Birth  And all selfwill'd with lawless Hand to raise  Malicious Slander on the Base of Praise  DISGRACE eternal wait the Wretch's Name  Who lives on Credit of a borrow'd Fame  Who wears the Trappings of another's Wit  Or fathers Bantlings which he cou'd not get  But shrewd Suspicion with her squinting Eye  To Truth declar'd prefers a whisper'd Lye  With greedy Mind the proffer'd Tale believes  Relates her Wishes and with Joy deceives  THE World a pompous Name by Custom due  To the small Circle of a talking few  With heartfelt Glee th'injurious Tale repeats  And sends the Whisper buzzing through the Streets  The Prude demure with sober saintlike Air  Pities her Neighbour for she's wondrous fair  And when Temptations lie before our Feet  Beauty is frail and Females indiscreet  She hopes the Nymph will every Danger shun  Yet prays devoutlythat the Deed were done  Mean Time sits watching for the daily Lie  As Spiders lurk to catch a simple Fly  YET is not Scandal to one Sex confin'd  Though Men would fix it on the weaker Kind  Yes this great Lord Creation's Master Man  Will vent his Malice where the Blockhead can  Imputing Crimes of which e'en Thought is free  For Instance now your ROSCIAD all to me  IF partial Friendship in thy sterling Lays  Grows all too wanton in another's Praise  Critics who judge by Ways themselves have known  Shall swear the Praise the Poem is my own  For 'tis the Method in these learned Days  For Wits to scribble first and after praise  Critics and Co thus vend their wretched Stuff  And help out Nonsense by a monthly Puff  Exalt to Giant's Forms weak puny Elves  And descant sweetly on their own dear selves  For Works per Month by Learning's Midwives paid  Demand a Puffing in the Way of Trade  RESERV'D and cautious with no partial Aim  My Muse e'er sought to blast another's Fame  With willing Hand cou'd twine a Rival's Bays  From Candour silent where she cou'd not praise  But if vile Rancour from no Matter who  Actor or Mimic Printer or Review  Lies oft o'erthrown with ceaseless Venom spread  Still hiss out Scandal from their Hydra Head  If the dull Malice boldly walk the Town  Patience herself wou'd wrinkle to a Frown  Come then with Justice draw the ready Pen  Give me the Works I wou'd not know the Men  All in their Turns might make Reprisals too  Had all the Patience but to read them through  Come to the utmost probe the desperate Wound  Nor spare the Knife where'er Infection's found  BUT Prudence CHURCHILL or her Sister Fear  Whispers Forbearance to my fright'ned Ear  Oh then with me forsake the thorny Road  Lest we should flounder in some  FleetDitch  Ode  And sunk for ever in the lazy Flood  Weep with the NAIADS heavy Drops of Mud  HAIL mighty Ode which like a Picture Frame  Hold any Portrait and with any Name  Or like your Nitches planted thick and thin  Will serve to cram the Random Hero in  HAIL mighty Bard toowhatsoe'er thy Name  or DURFY for it's all the same  To Brother Bards shall equal Praise belong  For Wit for Genius Comedy and Song  No costive Muse is thine which freely rakes  With ease familiar in the well known Jakes  Happy in Skill to souse through foul and fair  And toss the Dung out with a  lordly  Air  So have I seen amidst the grinning Throng  The Sledge Procession slowly dragg'd along  Where the mock Female Shrew and henpeck'd Male  Scoop'd rich Contents from either copious Pail  Call'd Bursts of Laughter from the roaring Rout  And dash'd and splash'd the filthy Grains about  QUIT then my Friend the Muses lov'd Abode  Alas they lead not to Preferment's Road  Be solemn sad put on the priestly Frown  Be dull 'tis sacred and becomes the Gown  Leave Wit to others do a Christian Deed  Your Foes shall thank you for they know their Need  BROAD is the Path by Learning's Sons possess'd  A thousand modern Wits might walk abreast  Did not each Poet mourn his luckless Doom  Jostled by Pedants out of Elbow Room  I who nor court their Love nor fear their Hate  Must mourn in Silence o'er the Muses Fate  No Right of Common now on  Pindus'  Hill  While all our Tenures are by Critics Will  Where watchful Guardians of the Lady Muse  Dwell monstrous Giants dreadful tall REVIEWS  Who as we read in fam'd Romance of Yore  Sound but a Horn press forward to the Door  But let some Chief some bold advent'rous Knight  Provoke these Champions to an equal Fight  Strait into Air to spaceless nothing fall  The Castle Lions Giants Dwarf and all  ILL it befits with undiscerning Rage  To censure  Giants  in this polish'd Age  No lack of Genius stains these happy Times  No Want of Learning and no Dearth of Rimes  The seesaw Muse that flows by  measur'd  Laws  In tuneful Numbers and affected Pause  With Sound alone Sound's happy Virtue fraught  Which hates the Trouble and Expence of Thought  Once every Moon throughout the circling Year  With Even Cadence charms the critic Ear  While dire Promoter of Poetic Sin  A  Magazine  must hand the Lady in  HOW  Moderns  write how nervous strong and well  The ANTIROSCIAD'S decent Muse  does  tell  Which while she strives to cleanse each Actor hurt  Daubs with her Praise and rubs him into Dirt  SURE never yet was happy Aera known  So gay so wise so  tasteful  as our own  Our curious Histories rise at once COMPLETE  Yet still  continued  as they're paid per Sheet  SEE every Science which the World wou'd know  Your Magazines shall every Month bestow  Whose very Titles fill the Mind with Awe  Imperial Christian Royal British Law  Their rich Contents will every Reader fit  Statesman Divine Philosopher  and  Wit  Compendious Schemes which teach all Things at once  And make a pedant Coxcomb of a Dunce  BUT let not Anger to such Frenzy grow  Drawcansir like to strike down Friend and Foe  To real Worth be Homage duly paid  But no Allowance to the paltry Trade  My Friends I name not though I boast a few  To Me an Honour and to Letters too  Fain would I praise but when such  Things  oppose  My  Praise of Course must make them's Foes  IF manly JOHNSON with satyric Rage  Lash the dull Follies of a trifling Age  If his strong Muse with genuine Strength aspire  Glows not the Reader with the Poet's Fire  HIS the true Fire where creep the witling Fry  To warm themselves and light their Rushlights by  WHAT Muse like GRAY'S shall pleasing pensive flow  Attemper'd sweetly to the rustic Woe  Or who like him shall sweep the Theban Lyre  And as his Master pour forth Thoughts of Fire  E'EN now to guard afflicted Learning's Cause  To judge by Reason's Rules and Nature's Laws  Boast we true Critics in their proper Right  While LOWTH and Learning HURD and Taste unite  HAIL sacred NamesOh arm'd with honest Rage  Save your lov'd Mistress from a Ruffian's Rage  See how she gasps and struggles hard for Life  Her Wounds all bleeding from the Butcher's Knife  Critics like Surgeons blest with curious Art  Shou'd mark each Passage to the human Heart  But not unskilful yet with lordly Air  Read Surgeon's Lectures while they scalp and tear  To Names like these I pay the hearty Vow  Proud of their Worth and not asham'd to bow  To these inscribe my rude but honest Lays  And feel the Pleasures of my conscious Praise  Not that I mean to court each letter'd Name  And poorly glimmer from reflected Fame  But that the Muse which owns no servile Fear  Is proud to pay her willing Tribute here  FINIS
