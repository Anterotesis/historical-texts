 MEDEA A TRAGEDY  Aestuat ingens  Imo in corde pudor mixtoque insania luctu  Et furiis agitatus amor et conscia virtus  AENEID  LONDON Printed by H WOODFALL And Sold by J MORGAN  Paternosterrow  MDCCLXI  Price TWO SHILLINGS and SIXPENCE  TO THE KING THIS TRAGEDY OF MEDEA IS MOST HUMBLY INSCRIB'D BY HIS MAJESTY's  MOST DUTIFUL MOST FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED SUBJECT AND SERVANT R GLOVER  PROLOGUE  THOUGH wild our theme the grave historian's page  Hath sanctify'd the tale through ev'ry age  Who hath not heard of Argo sent from Greece  Of Jason's labours for the golden fleece  And fond Medea's illrequited aid  To that false hero who his vows betray'd  In ev'ry clime where learned Muses reign  The stage hath known Medea's mournful strain  Hath giv'n the flying car and magic rod  To her th' avow'd descendant of a god  The storms of trouble which afflict the great  Teach private life to prise its tranquil state  That truth the moral of our fable shows  Too well in scenes of unexampled woes  Which here will ravage an exalted breast  Of merit conscious and with shame opprest  Where love and fury grief and madness join'd  O'erturn the structure of a godlike mind  Pow'r wisdom science and her birth divine  In vain to shield her from distress combine  Nor wisdom pow'r nor science yield relief  Her potent wand can vanquish all but grief  In vain her winged chariot sweeps the air  To shun that mightier sorceress despair  The characters and passions hence exprest  Are all submitted to the feeling breast  Let ancient story justify the rest  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  JASON  AESON  CREON  LYCANDER  FIRST COLCHIAN  FIRST CORINTHIAN  MEDEA  THEANO  HECATÉ  FIRST PHAEACIAN  COLCHIANS PHAEACIANS THESSALIANS and CORINTHIANS  The scene is in the citadel of Corinth between a grove sacred to Juno and the royal palace with a distant prospect of the sea  MEDEA A TRAGEDY  ACT THE FIRST  SCENE THE FIRST  LYCANDER  seeing THEANO advance from the temple of JUNO  THAT form divine by all rever'd and lov'd  Moves from the temple On her pensive brow  Sits holy care with gentleness and grace  Whose placid beams humanity reveal  She stops contemplating the sea Theano  Why with that musing aspect tow'rd the main  Stand'st thou regardless of thy brother's voice  THEANO  Imperial Juno in an awful vision  This morn presented to my wondring sight  The shapes of strangers by distress pursu'd  Whom to the refuge of this holy place  I must receive obedient to her charge  And lo a vessel turns her hast'ning prow  To Corinth's harbour  LYCANDER  Ten wellmeasur'd strokes  Of her swift oars will reach the shore below  But hear my errand Creon knows thy altar  Unclad with garlands still proclaims thy firmness  Against his daughter's marriage then prepare  Thy hallow'd eye to meet his threat'ning brow  Fence thy chaste ear against his impious vaunts  Which urge th' example of Almighty Jove  For his own thirst of empire  THEANO  Say to Creon  Kings should aspire to imitate the Gods  Not in their pow'r but goodness human virtues  More nigh to Heav'n's perfection may be rais'd  Than human grandeur Jove derides the toil  Of mortal pow'r but smiles on righteous deeds  LYCANDER  Thus would I speak Theano could my words  And thoughts be tun'd in harmony like thine  But danger breaks that union in a palace  And strains the tongue to discord with the heart  Then pacify thy goddess when the king  Exacts my service if discretion wears  A mask of duty kindly thou impute  Blame to my station and absolve Lycander  But look yon vessel hath discharg'd its train  Who climb the hill with aged steps and slow  Nay turn thy eyes a second troop of strangers  March through the city Sable is their garb  Their mien dejected This demands my care  Farewel  SCENE THE SECOND  THEANO and COLCHIANS  THEANO  What forms are these Allpotent goddess  I feel thee now my vision is accomplish'd  FIRST COLCHIAN  O thou who seem'st the guardian of these shades  Which from the isthmus shew their tow'ring growth  The sailor's guide through Corinth's double main  Permit an humble stranger to enquire  What pow'r is worshipp'd here  THEANO  aside  The very garb  The figures painted in my recent vision  Thy feet O stranger stand on sacred earth  These shades enclose the venerable fane  Erected there to hymeneal Juno  Whose presence guards the citadel of Corinth  FIRST COLCHIAN  Then let us lift our suppliant voice unblam'd  That in the refuge of this hallow'd grove  Our exil'd feet may rest  THEANO  Your suit is granted  So wills the pow'r inhabiting that temple  And say ye favour'd of connubial Juno  What are your names and country  FIRST COLCHIAN  From the banks  Of distant Phasis and the Euxin wave  Lost to our native mansions are we come  Illguided Colchians to the walls of Corinth  On king Aeetes' daughter we attend  That boast of Asia to the Sun ally'd  To Hecaté and Circé more illustrious  In her own virtues for her wisdom known  Through ev'ry clime the allendow'd Medea  THEANO  Where is your princess  FIRST COLCHIAN  In that anchor'd bark  Which to your haven from Iolcos sail'd  Where on his specious ambassy to Creon  Her husband left her on a lonely pillow  At length impatient of his tedious absence  She and her sons have brav'd th' unsparing deep  THEANO  Yet more unsparing than the deep is man  So will this daughter of affliction find  When her sad feet are planted on this shore  FIRST COLCHIAN  How swift are evil tidings While our keel  But lightly touch'd that wellfrequented strand  We heard th' ungrateful Jason would divorce her  This day to wed the daughter of your monarch  THEANO  If heav'n prevent not Through the solemn shade  Direct thy view That highrais'd altar note  Close by the fountain Thither lead your princess  This is a refuge which no regal pride  Highswoln with pow'r nor multitude inflam'd  By madding discord nor invader's rapine  Have e'er profan'd Return Yon palace opens  No friend of yours approaches It is Creon  Thou too be present goddess and illumine  The earthborn darkness of thy servant's mind  SCENE THE THIRD  THEANO and CREON  CREON  entring  Why do they paint Medea's woes to me  A king should lift his steady front on high  And while he gazes on the radiant throne  Where bright ambition sits amid the stars  The hopes the fears the miseries of others  Pass by unheeded in his contemplation  Art thou come forth with those illomen'd looks  To blast the public festival  THEANO  Howl howl  Deluded city banish from thy dwellings  The genial banquet fill thy streets with mourners  To celebrate in notes of lamentation  A nuptial day offensive to the gods  CREON  Thinkst thou thy priestly office can avail  To counteract the high designs of kings  Go and with bridal chaplets deck thy altar  Left thou provoke me to confound thy pride  Elate with wreaths of sanctity in vain  THEANO  Not that the holy fillet binds my temples  Not that before the altar I present  The public victim or a nation's vows  By me are usher'd to th' eternal thrones  Misjudging monarch is my heart elate  It is that virtue owns me for her servant  Benevolence and pity guide my will  Beneficence and charity my deeds  Ev'n now though deem'd importunate and proud  My soul bows down in heaviness for Creon  And at his danger sighs in mournful warnings  CREON  Repeat thy warnings to the coward's ear  My danger  THEANO  From that goddess who inspir'd  The Colchian princess to desert her father  To aid the Grecian heroes and restore  Our lost possession of the golden fleece  The voice of loud complaint from yonder beach  Already strikes her ear Medea  CREON  Ha  What of Medea  THEANO  Is arriv'd in Corinth  CREON  Arriv'd  THEANO  She and her children to reclaim  A husband and a father in that prince  Whom thou hast destin'd to Creüsa's bed  CREON  Thou who obtain'st infinity of pow'r  Lord of Olympus king of gods and men  Dost thou regard thy scepter'd sons below  Say shall a female hand o'erturn the basis  Which I am founding to enlarge my sway  If so resume the diadem I wear  Its scanty circle I reject with scorn  THEANO  Ye winds disperse impieties like these  Nor let their sound profane the heav'nly threshold  CREON  Hence to thy temple  THEANO  Thou defy'st not me  But her whose awful presence fills that temple  Imperfect victims inauspicious off'rings  And sounds portentous have foreboded long  Her high displeasure Her apparent form  Stood near my pillow at the op'ning dawn  And strictly charg'd me to receive this stranger  Think too what lofty science arms Medea  With more than nature's force  CREON  I think it false  And all the fabled wonders of her charms  Thy legends too of inauspicious off'rings  Imperfect victims and portentous sounds  What priests may publish and a king despise  THEANO  Farewel rash prince My duty is discharg'd  CREON  Stay Dost thou mean to give this Colchian refuge  THEANO  Can I dispute a deity's injunction  CREON  Go dream again procure some wiser vision  Which may instruct thee to avoid my wrath  SCENE THE FOURTH  CREON and LYCANDER  CREON  Where hast thou loiter'd to conceal th' arrival  Of this accurst enchantress and the purpose  Of thy rebellious sister to protect her  LYCANDER  My lord these tydings are to me unknown  But further news of high import I bear  Iolchian Aeson Jason's royal sire  Advancing now anticipates this notice  SCENE THE FIFTH  CREON LYCANDER and AESON with THESSALIANS in mourning garments  CREON  Thrice hail my double brother Do I owe  Thy timely presence to our ancient friendship  Or to th' alarm Medea's flight might raise  Who scarce precedes thy fortunate appearance  My sudden joy o'erlook'd that dusky robe  AESON  It suits my fortune Heavy with affliction  My weary feet are banish'd from Iolcos  How my fell brother Pelias that usurper  Of my paternal sway was foil'd and slain  Thou know'st His son retreated into Thrace  Whence he hath pour'd a savage host of ruffians  With unexpected inroad and so rapid  That instant flight alone preserv'd thy friend  Thy suppliant now for aid  CREON  Dismiss thy cares  Soon shall thy warlike son display his banners  Extend my frontier and recover thine  More of thy fortunes shalt thou tell hereafter  But give to gladness this selected day  Of Jason's nuptials  AESON  Nobly thou reliev'st  A king's distress Now satisfy the parent  Lead me to Jason  CREON  Follow to my palace  LYCANDER  He is not there  CREON  What say'st thou  LYCANDER  On the sands  Alone with melancholy pace he treads  As I but now descry'd him from this rock  AESON  With melancholy pace  CREON  His promise binds him  This very morning to espouse Creüsa  AESON  Perhaps with fresh calamity o'erworn  I doubt too much yet hear me  CREON  Thy appearance  Removes all doubts Lycander find the prince  Say who is come to celebrate his nuptials  AESON to LYCANDER  Is he a stranger to Medea's landing  LYCANDER  I trust he is  AESON  They must not meet  CREON  Lycander  See thou prevent it Send Theano to us  And let her bring obedience else her fault  Shall on thy head be punish'd  SCENE THE SIXTH  CREON and AESON  AESON  Should my son  Once see Medea  CREON  Can her looks annul  A league like ours  AESON  Alas thou little know'st her  Her eye surpasses that refulgent star  Which first adorns the evening and her talents  Exceed her beauty Like the forked thunder  She wields resistless arguments her words  With more than lightning's subtlety are wing'd  CREON  Why art thou startled  AESON  She is thereascending  My sight acquainted with her haughty steps  Shrinks ere they touch the summit of this hill  CREON  Which is the farfam'd sorceress of Colchis  AESON  Too well distinguish'd by her stately port  And elevation o'er that weeping train  She tow'rs a genuin offspring of the gods  Rage on her brow and anguish in her eye  Denounce the growing tempest of her mind  CREON  Now god of waters since thy partial hand  Thrusts this barbarian outcast on my shores  Back to thy floods the fugitive I spurn  AESON  What means my royal friend Retire Avoid  This formidable woman who may wound  Our dignity I know her soaring mind  Which all enlighten'd with sublimest knowledge  Disdains the state and majesty of kings  Nor ranks with less than deity itself  CREON  Curse on her beauty and majestic mien  But let the rumor of her pow'r be true  The Sun her boasted ancestor may arm  Her hand with fire let Hecaté and Circé  The goddesses of spells and black enchantments  Attend her steps and cloath her feet in terror  We have our fiends the sorceress shall find  That grief despair distraction wait our nod  To wring her heart through all her magic guards  SCENE THE SEVENTH  MEDEA her two CHILDREN COLCHIANS and PHAEACIANS  MEDEA  No more I charge you Noble minds oppress'd  By injuries disdain the sound of comfort  Ye fiends and furies wont to leave your flames  At my command and tremble at my charms  Now now ascend and aid Medea's rage  Give me the voice of thunder to resound  My indignation o'er the earth and heav'ns  That I who draw my lineage from the Sun  Am fall'n below the basest lot of slaves  That anguish want despair contempt and shame  Are heap'd together by the hands of fate  Whelm'd in one mass of ruin on my head  And dash my struggling virtue to the ground  FIRST COLCHIAN  Why to our faithful counsels art thou deaf  MEDEA  Canst thou by counsel wast my exil'd feet  To my lost parents my forsaken friends  And native palaceOh I gave him all  To him my virgin bosom I resign'd  For him the regal mansion of my father  The lov'd companions of my youth deserted  From foul defeat from shame from death I sav'd him  What more could womanYet he weds another  Me he abandons and these helpless infants  Forlorn unshelter'd in a foreign clime  To ev'ry outrage ev'ry want expos'd  Blast his perfidious head vindictive lightnings  Unhappy woman canst thou in the height  Of thy despair thy rage and indignation  Canst thou pursue him with a heavier curse  Than to be plung'd in woes which equal thine  FIRST COLCHIAN  Though stung with just resentment due regard  Pay to my age fidelity and service  A long and painful traverse from Iolcos  Hast thou endur'd nor since thy landing here  The needful succour known of rest or food  MEDEA  Talk not to me of nourishment and rest  Food to these lips and slumber to these eyes  Must ever now be strangers  FIRST COLCHIAN  By the beams  Of thy forefather never will I see  Thy wisdom bound in vassalage to passion  Once more I warn thee princess to thy refuge  This is the consecrated bow'r of Juno  Thou underneath the hospitable shade  Sit suppliant down  MEDEA  Improvident Medea  To raise another from destruction's depths  To wealth to glory raise him yet thyself  Leave destitute and suppliant Oh what art thou  Whom blinded men unerring wisdom call  Thou couldst not pierce the thin the airy veils  Which from my eyes conceal'd the paths of danger  Nor canst thou now repel th' increasing storm  Of rapid anguish which o'erturns my peace  Down to the endless gloom of dreary night  Hence let me drive thee from my inmost soul  That nothing calm may hover nigh my heart  To cool its pain and save me from distraction  SCENE THE EIGHTH  COLCHIANS and PHAEACIANS  A COLCHIAN  Come on ye soft companions in affliction  Melodious daughters of Phaeacia's isle  In strains alternate let us chaunt our grief  Perhaps our mistress we may charm to rest  A PHAEACIAN  O Music sweet artificer of pleasure  Why is thy science exercis'd alone  In festivals on hymeneal days  And in the full assemblies of the happy  Ah how much rather should we court thy skill  In sorrow's gloomy season to diffuse  Thy smooth allurements through the languid ear  Of selfdevour'd affliction and delude  The wretched from their sadness  A COLCHIAN  Let us melt  In tuneful accents flowing to our woes  That so Medea may at least reflect  She is not singly wretched Let her hear  Our elegies whose measur'd moan records  Our friends forsaken and our country lost  That she no longer to her sole distress  Her deeprevolving spirit may confine  But by our sorrows may relieve her own  FIRST PART OF THE MUSIC  A COLCHIAN  IAMBICS  Ye stately battlements and tow'rs  Imperial Corinth's proud defence  Thou citadel whose dewy top  The clouds in fleecy mantles fold  Projecting o'er the briny foam  An awful shadow where the might  Of Neptune urges either shore  And this contracted isthmus forms  Ah why your glories to admire  Do we repining Colchians stand  Illfated strangers on the banks  Of silverwater'd Phasis born  A PHAEACIAN  TROCHAICS  Pride of art majestic columns  Which beneath the sacred weight  Of that god's refulgent mansion  Lift your flow'rinsculptur'd heads  Oh ye marblechannell'd fountains  Which the swarming city cool  And as art directs your murmurs  Warble your obedient rills  You our eyes obscur'd by sorrow  View unconscious of your grace  Mourning still our lost Phaeacia  Longremember'd native isle  A PHAEACIAN  IAMBICS  O that on fam'd Peneus' banks  The nymphs of Pelion had bemoan'd  Their shady haunts to ashes turn'd  By heav'n's red anger hateful pines  Which form'd thy wellcompacted sides  O Argo fatal to our peace  Thou never then through Adria's wave  Hadst reach'd Phaeacia's blissful shore  Nor good Alcinoüs the hand  Of Jason with Medea join'd  Nor sent us weeping from our homes  Her luckless train to share her grief  SECOND PART  A PHAEACIAN  TROCHAICS  Known recesses where the echoes  Through the hollowwinding vale  And the hill's retentive caverns  Tun'd their voices from our songs  Shadeencircled verdant levels  Where the downy turf might charm  Weary feet to joyous dances  Mix'd with madrigals and pipes  O ye unforgotten pleasures  Pleasures of our tender youth  You we never shall revisit  Illexchang'd for scenes of woe  A COLCHIAN  From the polish'd realms of Greece  Where the arts and muses reign  Truth and justice are expell'd  Here from palaces and tow'rs  Snowyvested faith is fled  While beneath the shining roofs  Falshood stalks in golden robes  Dreary Caucasus again  Take us to thy frozen breast  Let us shiver on thy ridge  Everduring pile of ice  Gather'd from the birth of time  A PHAEACIAN  Cheering breeze with sportive pinion  Gliding o'er the crisped main  With our tresses thou shalt wanton  On our native sands no more  Fountains whose melodious waters  Cooling our Phaeacian grots  Oft our eyes to sweetest slumber  With their lulling falls beguil'd  We have chang'd your soothing warble  For the doleful moan of woe  And our peaceful moss deserting  Found a pillow thorn'd with care  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE THE FIRST  JASON advancing from the end of the stage THEANO on one side MEDEA in the grove  THEANO  THE princely steps of Jason are in sight  He scarce conjectures that th' indignant breast  Of her he injures pours from yonder shades  Its highton'd anguish Yet illustrious false one  What stinging thoughts distort thy manly frame  How have thy gestures lost their wonted grace  In this keen struggle with upbraiding conscience  Thou soon before that inward judge arraign'd  Shalt hear me plead thy wrong'd Medea's cause  This is the crisis Too complacent hero  By pride untutor'd though misled by error  Thou wilt be calm and gentle to rebuke  JASON  Press'd by a father's absolute decree  Solicited by Corinth's potent lord  Aw'd with the specious sound of public good  I have consented and the hour is nigh  Oh in some future hour of sad reflection  May not my heart with selfreproach confess  This plea of public welfare was ambition  And filial duty was a feeble tie  To authorise the breach of sacred vows  MEDEA  in the grove  Ungrateful Jason  JASON  Whence proceeds this voice  MEDEA  in the grove  O fire of light thou seest my wrongs  JASON  Again  Imagination pregnant with remorse  In sounds unreal yields its birth of terror  MEDEA  in the grove  Ye arbiters of oaths and plighted faith  O Jove and Themis hear  JASON  It is a voice  Resembling hers when she alas is far  No mockery of fancy  Leans against the scene  THEANO  advancing  On his cheek  Health seems to wither O'er his shaded sight  The shiv'ring eyelids close A creeping tremor  O'erspreads his fading lips and dewy limbs  Bless'd be these signals of returning virtue  Hail prince Why stand'st thou listning What alarms thee  JASON  An awful murmur from offended heav'n  Through yonder branches issu'd in a voice  Which chill'd my spirit and unnerv'd my strength  THEANO  What didst thou hear  JASON  Medea's wellknown accents  Thrice did the vocal prodigy repeat  Though seas divide her from these faithless arms  THEANO  There is no need of prodigy Meer nature  In thy own breast will startle when thou know'st  It was Medea's self who call'd on Jason  JASON  Herself  THEANO  The injur'd daughter of Aeetes  But newlywafted from Thessalia's shore  Thou may'st discover through those parting boughs  Where she is seated near the fountain's brink  With her pale cheek reclining on the altar  JASON  looking on the grove  Stern deities of vengeance and of justice  Now pass your sentence Nemesis and Themis  My illwrought web of hated life unravel  Which was not wove for happiness  THEANO  Be patient  JASON  Peculiar woes through ev'ry stage of being  Were Jason's portion Early I beheld  My father's crown usurp'd My youth subjected  To an insidious tyrant was devoted  A sacrifice in ColchisSo he hop'd  And I wish nowI triumph'dGlory follow'd  The source of new calamity to me  Where is that glory Serving selfish kings  Abetting falshood perjury and fraud  THEANO  Turn thy attention from thy own distress  To feel what others suffer by thy frailty  Thy wife and offspring Listen  JASON  I obey  THEANO  How could'st thou lead this allexcelling princess  From clime to clime th' associate in thy toils  To fall the victim in a foreign land  Of those unrighteous statutes which appoint  Imperious husbands masters of divorce  How think th' establish'd practice of the Greeks  Or all which varnish'd policy might plead  Could e'er absolve thee from a solemn tie  With such uncommon obligations bound  By those superior those unwritten laws  Which honour whispers to the conscious heart  JASON  O venerable woman lend thy aid  THEANO  Attone thy fault Repentance is heroic  And holds its rank among the manly virtues  JASON  Yes I renounce Creüsa and her kingdom  Yet see this breast with newborn terror beat  Not all my trials through unnumber'd dangers  From monsters famine from the raging deep  And darkbrow'd care have so confirm'd my courage  But that I tremble at th' impending conflict  I dread that scorn and fury whose excess  May kill repentance and provoke destruction  SCENE THE SECOND  THEANO JASON and LYCANDER  LYCANDER  The king Theano summons thee before him  THEANO  What time  LYCANDER  This instant  THEANO  I obey his pleasure  JASON  Thou wilt not leave me  THEANO  Thou hast heard this summons  Heed my last words Maintain thy just resolves  Lycander let thy conduct leave no room  For my reproaches and the wrath of Juno  LYCANDER  Fear not thy counsels shall be treasur'd here  SCENE THE THIRD  JASON and LYCANDER  LYCANDER  I see a sudden change My single charge  I will deliver and forbear enquiry  Long have I sought thee prince The royal Aeson  Is now in Corinth and will soon accost thee  JASON  My father here Why multiply distress  Accumulate perplexity and shame  On my devoted head ye righteous pow'rs  LYCANDER  Prince he is near and I return to Creon  SCENE THE FOURTH  JASON and AESON  JASON  Amaz'd distracted tortur'd I retain  My veneration here O sacred head  What from thy peaceful habitation calls  Thy silver hairs to these abodes of woe  Or com'st thou wrapt in sable to lament  Our mutual errors and dishonour'd names  AESON  Why I am here why bearing this apparel  Too soon will Jason know But first reply  Why on the sea's waste margin was my son  Observ'd to trace his solitary path  When Corinth pauses in her gen'ral gladness  Her choral songs and minstrelsy suspending  For Jason's absence  JASON  Better she should wait  Whole ages wait than justice be suspended  And the return of honour be unwelcom'd  AESON  Can I interpret these mysterious words  JASON  Hast thou not heard my father that Medea  Weeps in that bow'r invoking Jove and Themis  To witness what returns she meets from Jason  AESON  What most I dreaded Then my aged limbs  Must wear these garments still unchang'd thy country  Thy friends thy father's house unceasing mourn  The woes of exile more severe than time  Indent the surrows deeper on these brows▪  JASON  The woes of exile  AESON  Yes the race of Pelias  Force me to Corinth Young Acastus reigns  The gen'rous Creon promises his aid  That aid will Jason cruelly prohibit  JASON  Then we begin to reap the bitter harvest  From seeds which selfish policy had sown  When I was hurry'd to these fatal walls  And gall'd with jealous fear Medea left thee  Heav'n in that period from the roll of fortune  Eras'd our titles and the with'ring scepter  Shrunk from thy grasp  AESON  Nay look not thus entranc'd  What draws thy eye  JASON  She rises from the grove  A Sun disfigur'd by a mist of sorrow  Rais'd from our crime Awake theeWhat remains  But that we fall before our known protectress  Confessing both in Jove's offended sight  How much of weak inconstancy hath stain'd  My name of hero what ignoble guile  Disgrac'd thy regal head  AESON  And who must save  Iolcos  JASON  She Medea's gen'rous wisdom  Which in itself contains the strength of armies  And quell'd old Pelias can dethrone the son  AESON  What frenzy guides thee Follow me to Creon  JASON  Rest thou with me  AESON  Inhuman dost thou covet  To see my age and dignity revil'd  I charge thee follow  JASON  Riveted I wait  As if congenial with this rock I grew  From its foundations till Medea come  AESON  Revolter she is coming But my eye  Shall not be far Remember thou dost hazard  Thy country's love perhaps thy father's too  SCENE THE FIFTH  JASON apart MEDEA COLCHIANS and PHAEACIANS  JASON  How shall I face her injur'd worth how chuse  The most auspicious moment to accost her  MEDEA  Why have I science to command the moon  To draw the spirits from the realms of night  And trace the hidden pow'rs of baneful nature  Why am I wise unless to feel my sorrows  With sharper sensibility and prove  How weak is wisdom struggling with despair  FIRST COLCHIAN  Its succour yet solicit Wisdom smooths  Each thorny path and Virtue is her sister  MEDEA  Old man be silent Hath Medea's grief  The leisure now to hear thy moral tale  No let me loath my being curse the sun  My bright forefather and upbraid the heav'ns  That I was ever born I will exclaim  I will demand ye unrelenting pow'rs  Why your injustice terrifies the earth  With such an image of distress as mine  JASON  This interview I see in all its terrors  But further pause will turn suspence to madness  MedeaI am come  MEDEA  And dar'st thou come  With that unmatch'd ingratitude and falshood  To face the constant worth thou now betray'st  JASON  I come to lay my errors in thy view  MEDEA  No to my view display Creüsa's beauty  Dwell on her merit who excels Medea  JASON  The deity presiding o'er that temple  I call to witness that my father's pleasure  MEDEA  And dost thou urge thy father thou perfidious  Thy fatherOh that I had been thus wise  And ne'er forgot the duty of a child  Thy father gave thee a precarious being  In its first flight of glory doom'd to fall  Fresh in its prime a victim to oblivion  Had not I sav'd and borne thee to renown  JASON  Yes Jason's life and glory are thy gifts  MEDEA  I gave thee too my love my virgin love  My friends my country my unspotted fame  My joy my peace all all on thee bestow'd  What could a father more Him too my pow'r  Snatch'd from oppression and his trech'rous brother  Usurping Pelias slew that cruel Pelias  Who on thy youth impos'd the dang'rous toil  Whence I preserv'd thee But my wrath be still  Inconstant base alike both son and sire  Deserve my scorn  JASON  Shall contumelious harshness  Blot those perfections from the sun deriv'd  And not one moment to thy wisdom yield  That thou may'st hear me  MEDEA  No thou most ingrate  Of all who e'er forgot their benefactors  When the fam'd Argo fraught with Grecian princes  Pierc'd with its beak the sandy verge of Phasis  What daring hand but mine their trophies rais'd  The golden fleece amid th' enchanted grove  Had hung untouch'd beside its scaly guardian  Wild dogs and vultures had devour'd your limbs  Your bones had whiten'd on the Colchian strand  I fearless stept between the narrow bounds  Which parted your devoted lives from fate  With mystic spels entranc'd the sleepless dragon  Bent to the yoke the brazenfooted bulls  And gave you safety victory and fame  JASON  I own thy merits and the deep remembrance  MEDEA  Forever be detested that remembrance  Curs'd be the skill which fram'd your fatal bark  Accurs'd the gale which fill'd her spreading canvas  But doubly curs'd the hour the hour of ruin  When first I view'd that smiling trech'rous form  And fondly trusted to the fair delusion  O that amid the terrors of enchantment  When for thy sake profoundest hell was open'd  Some fiend had whirl'd me to the desart pole  Or that the earth dividing with my charms  Low as her central cavern had entomb'd me  JASON  I feel thy anguish daughter of Aeetes  Which would o'erwhelm me had I less to offer  Than my repentant heart  MEDEA  Thy perjur'd heart  Foul with ingratitude and guilt Avaunt  And give it thy Creüsa I despise thee  JASON  Think who I am Though criminal I stand  And mourn my fault forget not I am Jason  By fame in brightest characters recorded  Deserving thy reproaches I endur'd them  But sure the lustre of my name is proof  Against contempt  MEDEA  The recompence of falshood  JASON  Hold I conjure thee Nay I will be heard  When first I sail'd for Corinth all my purpose  Was to establish by a league with Creon  Th' unstable throne of Thessaly since crush'd  By fierce Acastus Aeson's strict injunction  To wed Creüsa follow'd my arrival  When thou wert distant from my sight and Creon  Would grant his friendship  MEDEA  But by thy disgrace  JASON  Impatient woman  MEDEA  Could a king's protection  Be rank'd with mine thou weaklyperjur'd man  JASON  Thou shalt not stop me by th' immortal gods  I will proceed Intemp'rate passion stifles  Her breathless voice Oh majesty Oh wisdom  Oh features once divine how long shall rage  Despoil your grace No other form of beauty  No qualities or talents to thy own  Have I preferr'd By empire's glaring bubble  By policy's ensnaring voice misled  Or by mistaken duty to a parent  I swerv'd from sacred faith At thy approach  Light flashes through my error to thy feet  Contrition brings me no ignoble suppliant  The scourge of tyrants vanquisher of monsters  Thy instrument of glory now most glorious  That he subdues himself implores thy pardon  Oh unadvis'd Obdurate While I sue  Thy unforgiving brow returns disdain  Think of thy children  MEDEA  Traitor dar'st thou name them  JASON  Beware destruction with a hunter's speed  Pursues us both Inextricable snares  Are spreading round us Ha be calm Provoke  Ill fate no further Weigh in wisdom's balance  The pow'rful obligations which assail'd me  MEDEA  Can they be weigh'd with conquest life and fame  The vast profusion of my bounty on thee  Thou weak thou blind insensible and base  No my superior soul shall stoop no more  Though once from foul defeat and death I sav'd thee  I will not raise thee from thy grov'ling falshood  Let fortune's whole malignity pursue me  I and my children wretched as we may be  Outcast derided by the barb'rous herd  Spurn'd by th' unpitying proud with grim despair  With beggary and famine our companions  Will wander through th' inhospitable world  Nor ev'n amidst our complicated woes  E'er think of thee perfidious but with scorn  SCENE THE SIXTH  JASON and AESON  JASON  Then let the tempest roar tyrannic woman  The billows rise in mountains o'er thy head  AESON  Well thou hast seen her while thy father's eye  Ak'd at the low submission of a hero  Who with unmollify'd disdain was spurn'd  Say will my gentle son persist to court  The fellowship of fury and abide  The acrimonious taunt the settled frown  The stillrenew'd upbraiding Will my Jason  For this to deathless obloquy abandon  His name of hero while his arm rejects  A proffer'd aid to reinstate his father  Redeem his country and refresh his laurels  With want of action fading  JASON  There O Mars  Thou dost provide a banquet for despair  AESON  No for thy valour son a feast of glory  Come leave this melancholy spot Return  With me to joy  JASON  I go but never more  Speak to thy son of joy My soul foregoes  All gentle thoughts Its sad relief is horror  From the grim pow'r of homicide and ravage  O that this ev'ning lighted by the stars  And glimpse of armour I might turn my back  On Corinth's bulwarks that the trumpet's clangor  The shrillmouth'd clarion and the deepton'd horn  The groans of slaughter and the crash of spears  Might blend their discord for my nuptial song  SCENE THE SEVENTH  COLCHIANS and PHAEACIANS from the grove and looking on JASON as he quits the stage  A COLCHIAN  Solemn RECITATIVE  Thou who didst yoke the brazenfooted bulls  And fearless guide the adamantine plough  Which Vulcan labour'd o'er the direful soil  Sown with the serpent's teeth whence crested helms  And spears highbrandish'd by the earthborn race  For thy encounter pierc'd the crumbling mold  Thou conqueror beware more dang'rous foes  Doom'd to subdue thee in that palace wait  A PHAEACIAN  TROCHAICS  Soft alluring wiles are there  To seduce thee from the paths  Trod by godlike steps alone  Paths of virtue paths of praise  Colchian monsters Syren's songs  Might thy mortal frame destroy  These will kill thy glorious name  Matchless Jason then beware  A COLCHIAN  Solemn RECITATIVE  Thou yet untainted hero Ah reflect  That keenest sorrow poverty or pain  Are light and gentle to the bitter darts  Thrice steep'd in gall which Nemesis directs  Against his bosom who by merit pass'd  Once drew th' enchanting melody of praise  Then forfeiting the sweet report of fame  O'er his irrevocable loss repines  A PHAEACIAN  TROCHAICS  Shall the nymphs of Tempe's vale  Who in rural lays record  Thy persuasive love that won  Kind Medea to thy aid  Shall they change th' applauding strain  Shall the discord of reproach  Wound thy ear accustom'd long  To the music of renown  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT THE THIRD  SCENE THE FIRST  THEANO and the FIRST COLCHIAN  FIRST COLCHIAN  HOPE in its bud was blasted by her anger  THEANO  Unhappy anger but her

parent or to me a husband  ELDEST CHILD  Alas thou weep'st  MEDEA  You too must learn to weep  Ye destin'd wand'rers in the vale of mourning  Why do you lift your infant eyes to me  Your helpless mother cannot guard your childhood  Nor bid neglect and sorrow stand aloof  I once had parents Ye endearing names  How my torn heart with recollection bleeds  You too perhaps o'erflow your aged cheeks  Rend from your heads the venerable snow  Oft as your lost Medea is recall'd  And for a hapless offspring mourn like me  FIRST COLCHIAN  Heartbreaking sorrow now succeeds to rage  Turn royal mistress

bosom we had comfort still  Wilt thou forsake us  MEDEA  We will meet again  Remove them from me I can bear no longer  To view those mirrors which reflect the image  Of my distress and multiply my pains  THEANO  Weep not my children  MEDEA  Hide their melting softness  Lest they dissolve the vigor which must save them  MEDEA continues weeping  THEANO  Come lovely mourners rest awhile with me  Come and be practis'd to repeat your vows  For this most wrong'd of mothers You shall lift  Your blameless hands sweet supplicants shall kneel  To nuptial Juno and to rev'rend Themis  The arbitress of oaths and plighted faith  The dovelike voice of your untainted age  Thus visited by undeserv'd affliction  May win their guardian mercy when the pray'rs  Of man false man grown reprobate by time  With

mine  Be seen no longer in the bounds of Corinth  MEDEA  And who art thou dost give Medea law  And circumscribe the slend'rest spot on earth  Against her passage Unconfin'd as winds  I range with nature to her utmost bounds  While as I tread mankind reveres my steps  Its hidden pow'rs each element unfolds  And mightiest heroes anxious for renown  Implore Medea's favour What is Creon  Who from the sun's descendant dares withold  The right to hospitality and justice  CREON  Not of the number who revere thy steps  Or supplicate thy favour one whose scepter  Forbids thy residence in Greece Away  Range through the snows of Caucasus return  To Pontic desarts to thy native wilds  Among barbarians magnify thy deeds  This land admits no wand'rer like Medea  Who with a stranger from her father fled  Fled from her country and betray'd them both  MEDEA  With him I fled whom thou wouldst foully draw  Through blackest treason to thy daughter's bed  And for the rest if equity or wisdom  Were Creon's portion I would plead before him  But vindicate my actions to a robber  Who basely watch'd my absence to purloin  My only wealth my lofty soul disdains it  CREON  Hence while thou may'st rash woman ere thou prove  How strong the awful image of the gods  Is stampt on monarchs and thou feel my wrath  Swift in destruction like the bolt of Jove  MEDEA  Dost thou recount thy fables to Medea  The ideot tale which cheats the gaping vulgar  To her who knows the secret source of things  Behold this comely image of the gods  This violator of the holiest ties  Whom the dull hand of undiscerning chance  Hath deck'd in purple robes and pageant gold  Resembles much the majesty of heav'n  CREON  Thy bare expulsion shall not now attone  I will stand forth th' avenger of Aeetes  On his false daughter for thy crimes in Colchis  Vindictive furies in this distant region  Shame chastisement and insult shall o'ertake thee  Spoil that fair body humble that fell heart  Till as with bitt'rest agony it breaks  Thou curse its wild temerity which brav'd  The pond'rous hand of majesty incens'd  MEDEA  Ha thou vainboaster hast thou yet to learn  That I can rock the iron throne of Pluto  Can waft thee struggling to Rhiphaean crags  Where thou shalt rave and foam and gnash thy teeth  Where frost shall parch thee where the clouds shall scatter  Their storms around thee whirl in sportive air  Thy gorgeous robe thy diadem and scepter  While I Oh fruitless unsubstantial pow'r  Must still continue wretched Oh vain threat  Hath he not torn my Jason from these arms  What then avails the knowledge of my mind  Stretch'd on the rack of anguish is my heart  What spark of wisdom in my breast remains  All is extinguish'd there Oh Jason Jason  Is supported by her women  CREON  to

already  Begins to murmur were this holy place  Defil'd by force their zeal would swell to madness  Perhaps this princess for her wisdom fam'd  May be persuaded to abandon Corinth  And she revives with milder looks  MEDEA  aside  Pride pride  For once be wise in lowliness disguise thee  That thou may'st rise to vengeance King of Corinth  I only crave three hours to quit thy borders  CREON  to LYCANDER  If she exceed that slender space of time  Force shall remove her from my loathing sight  LYCANDER  to MEDEA while CREON is going  This contest princess thou hast wisely clos'd  Three hours

breath could dissipate like clouds  Which for awhile some hideous form assume  Then pass away dissolv'd to fleeting vapor  I too will aid thee By thy father's sister  I was held dear by Circé pow'rful queen  Who taught me various spels and incantations  MEDEA  Go then and bring my wand that potent rod  Which grew a branch of ebony o'ershading  The throne of Pluto sever'd thence and dipt  Thrice in the cold of Lethe's sleeping lake  By Hecaté on Circé was bestow'd  By her on me to still the winds and floods  Night's drowsy curtains o'er the sky to draw  And all its active fires entrance to rest

Charms from its orb th' unwilling moon  Controlls the rapid planet's speed  And dims the constellation's fires  While sounding torrents stop and sleep  While fountainnymphs in dread withold  Their mazy tribute from the meads  And stiff'ning serpents hear and die  Terrific deity whose name  And altar stain'd with human blood  On Tauric cliffs the Scythian wild  And fell Sarmatian tribes adore  TROCHAICS  Wreath'd in snakes and twining boughs  Gather'd from infernal oaks  Which o'er Pluto's portal hung  Shed a second night on hell  In thy raventinctur'd stole  Grasping thy tremendous brand

o'er the mangled slain  Dost tinge thy feet in sanguin dew  Ah leave awhile the vultures shriek  The raven croaking o'er the dead  The midnight wolf's insatiate howl  And hither turn thy solemn pace  The winds in magic horror bound  Shall at thy presence cease to breathe  No thunderteeming cloud approach  The hoarse and restless surge be dumb  MEDEA  No more The strongconstraining spell hath tam'd  The restif blast the pliant leaves are fix'd  The fountains rest th' oblivious birds are hush'd  And dead the billows on the silent beach  Begone She comes I feel the rocking ground  Its entrails groan Its shiv'ring surface parts  Scarce can Aeetes' child the sight endure  SCENE THE SEVENTH  MEDEA and HECATÉ rising in long black garments with a wreath of snakes and oaken boughs on her head and a torch in her hand  MEDEA  O my propitious and congenial goddess  Who thy mysterious science hast diffus'd  Of potent herbs and necromantic songs  Through my capacious bosom who so long  Hast been assistant to Medea's triumphs  Now thou behold'st me vanquish'd by despair  HECATÉ  I know thy suff'rings daughter but to close  The wounds of anguish and asswage despair  Is not the task of hell

heart  Must ask Will Jason ever more be kind  HECATÉ  Search not thy fate  MEDEA  Unfold it I enjoin thee  By him thou dread'st by Demogorgon's name  HECATÉ  Against thyself unhappy thou prevail'st  Ere night's black wheels begin their gloomy course  What thou dost love shall perish by thy rage  Nor thou be conscious when the stroke is giv'n  Then a despairing wand'rer must thou trace  The paths of sorrow in remotest climes  SCENE THE EIGHTH  MEDEA  Destroy my love By me shall Jason die  Oh insupportable O pitying Juno  Assist me sinking to the ground with anguish  SCENE THE NINTH  MEDEA on

stronger should my bosom heave  And sound its agonies in bitter groans  To the remorseless gods Destroy my Jason  Starting up  The dear false hero Perish first my art  FIRST PHAEACIAN  How oft have perjur'd lovers been recall'd  By strong enchantment Check these vain complaints  Hast thou not magic to constrain this wand'rer  Back to thy arms  MEDEA  I have but scorn the arts  Which may command his person not his love  No fly to Jason Let the only charm  Be soft persuasion to attract him hither  O he is gentle as the summer's breeze  With looks and gestures fashion'd by the graces  The messenger be thou discreet and good  Medea's pride shall stoop  FIRST COLCHIAN  I go though hopeless  Aside  MEDEA  Mean time will I to yonder wood return  And some deepshaded receptacle chuse  There

restore the wretched  Shall thy distress'd Medea be the first  Thou dost refuse to aid  JASON  It is too late  She cast me from her and we now are strangers  FIRST COLCHIAN  I have been long a traveller with time  And through unnumber'd evils have I noted  Those born of anger to be most deplor'd  Thou look'st no longer on that mutual care  Your children's welfare In the wrathful Jason  Benignity is lost ev'n nature dead  In the fond father  JASON  When I nam'd our children  Her ear was deafen'd and her scornful tongue  Was sharpen'd into outrage  FIRST COLCHIAN  See them here  The lively patterns of their mother's graces  And sharers in misfortune  SCENE THE SECOND  JASON the FIRST COLCHIAN and the CHILDREN  ELDEST CHILD  Art thou found  At last my father In thy search we pass'd  Through frightful waters and in roaring winds  Come to our mother who of thee complains  And with a promise never more to leave us  Speak comfort to her  JASON  Comfort  FIRST COLCHIAN  Dost thou shrink  To see these pledges of a love like hers  Oh thou obdurate who hast thrown the beauties  Of virtue from thee in thy youthful season  When ev'ry soft sensation is most warm  To clasp the cold deformity of guilt  I have no offspring Must an old man's eyes  Teach thine their tender lesson Must a heart  Which time and ills and care might well have fear'd  Teach thee affection and a parent's feeling  JASON  Support me rather than depress me Colchian  I sink My soul dissolving in affection  Hath quite unmann'd me  ELDEST CHILD  Dost thou grieve to see us  JASON  No my poor boys My spirit bows before you  In love and rev'rence These indeed subsist  A common care exacting all regard  What shall I say Not cruel would I seem  Not ev'n severe Yet Colchian let me ask  Will she  FIRST

just  JASON  aside  Oh that this morning she had thus address'd me  MEDEA  Not love alone not Hymen's common ties  But fame and conquest mutual toils and hardships  All which is marvellous and great

dragon hither points his course  See his huge pinions beat the tortur'd air  His monstrous body rolls the blast before him  And sails amidst a whirlwind Dost thou droop  Be not dismay'd my hero Stand behind  Attend ye demons whose contagious breath  Defiles the sun who chill the fiercest heart  And lock in drowsy sloth the nerves of strength  JASON  Assume thy terrors Moulder me to dust  Now call thy demons whose infernal grasp  May snatch and hurl me to my destin'd pains  Let me be stretch'd on torn Ixion's wheel  Or chain'd in burning adamant endure  The tooth of vipers and the scorpion's sting  Oh rather rather than behold thy suff'rings  MEDEA  Why art thou pale and languid Thou art safe  The slumb'ring monster drops his scaly wings  Thine is the fleece Medea too is thine  Jason

craggy sides  No shelter nigh my tempestbeaten head  And lo two infants clinging to my knees  Who join my grief and call Medea mother  O thou false hero whither art thou fled  Hark The wind only answers my complaint  It is the sea which murmurs to my groans  Ha what art thou grim shape embru'd with gore  Why dost thou wave that Stygian torch around  Art thou Revenge from Tartarus enlarg'd  To aid Medea Come then shake thy brand  Before my steps To perpetrate thy mischief  The winds shall lend their swiftness hell its fiends  The sea its fury and the Sun his flames  SCENE THE FOURTH  JASON

may roll on years ere we again  Shall meet in peace  SCENE THE TENTH  LYCANDER THEANO and JASON  JASON  Medea to thy temple  Is fled from all her virgins who entreat  Thy kind permission to pursue her steps  Where'er her frenzy leads  THEANO  My help is ready  And to thy guardian care I trust my brother  Whom Creon threatens with immediate death  Yet something whispers something sure divine  That other clouds of black events will break  Ere a new morning rise on troubled Corinth  And we surviving each portentous storm  Derive a sad security from horror  SCENE THE ELEVENTH  LYCANDER and JASON  LYCANDER  Whate'er this mystic language may import  Prince give attention  JASON  Speak  LYCANDER  Thy only course  Is to embark from Corinth with Medea  JASON  It was my secret and determin'd purpose  LYCANDER  Nor yet a secret Our suspicious tyrant  If he could rule his discontented subjects  Would stop thy passage But thy just design  The public shall befriend by me alarm'd  At Creon's threat to violate the grove  JASON  Can I requite thee  LYCANDER  Let me serve thee first  Requite me after as my wants may dictate  Is not thy father yonder  JASON  Let him come  Go and expect me shortly on the beach  SCENE THE TWELFTH  JASON and AESON  AESON  What have I heard Th' exasperated king  JASON  Hath told thee truth His daughter I relinquish  AESON  Off with this bridal pageantry which mocks  With gay delusion my disastrous age  Reach me again my sable from thy hand  I will receive it from thy barb'rous hand  Let dust be sprinkled on my joyless head  Nay rather turn invincible against me  Lock in that nervous gripe these snowy hairs  And to the hov'ring eagles on the beach  Cast my disfigur'd reliques Dost thou pause  Think'st thou that Jason's father will be seen  Decrepit tott'ring with distress and years  A vagabond a suppliant for protection  Among the happier princes No my son  Though not like thee the faulchion I can weild  And mow my foes before me I can die  JASON  Com'st thou with threat'nings That tremendous goddess  Whose piercing eye from yonder fane discerns  Guile in its naked shape through ev'ry garb  And marks ingratitude for signal vengeance  Knows that we merit both to die yet dying  We could not expiate our unmatch'd offence  AESON  What unaccustom'd terrifying sterness  Frowns on that aspect Gentle have I known thee  From infancy to manhood ne'er before  Have felt thee dreadful  JASON  Ever from thy fears  Wilt thou take counsel Can the voice of pity  Benevolence and equity convey  No admonition O exalt thy thoughts  From this base earth the mansion of deceit  Of perjuries and crimes Erect thy visage  To Themis heav'nthron'd patroness of justice  Invoke her aid that strengthen'd thou may'st hear  Nor be confounded at thy son's resolves  By no persuasion artifice or menace  My nowreviving dignity of mind  From its own summit shall again descend  AESON  What would my Jason  JASON  Take the holy priestess  Repair to Creon with united counsels  Him first from impious violence dissuade  And then  AESON  To whose protection must I fly  JASON  To mine Abandon Corinth and at Thebes  Not three day's march from these detested gates  Expect my presence Hercules is there  My friend my soldier He with ev'ry hero  Who once obey'd my standard will again  League their auxiliar swords and save Iolcos  Let this suffice If not Persist no more  Thy son is fix'd immoveable as fate  AESON  Thunder  Thy mightier genius awes me I submit  We all are guilty Juno so proclaims  But Oh amid these prodigies my Jason  Not one alarms me like the rude commotion  Which shakes thy placid bosom Be compos'd  I will conduct Theano to the king  SCENE THE THIRTEENTH  JASON  turning towards the temple  Look down connubial goddess and with hope  Let thy appeas'd divinity indulge  A hero off'ring at thy holy shrine  His spirit humbled with repentant sighs  You too attend ye favourable gales  And swiftly waft us to the kind embrace  Of our companion Orpheus who shall breathe  His tuneful consolation in a strain  Of griefcomposing energy to charm  Distraction's rage till newborn reason smile  Then with her children lovely as the mother  Shall blooming Tempé on its flow'ry lap  Again receive her while Peneus' stream  Blends with the flitting warblers on his banks  His murm'ring cadence to delight her ear  And I once more along th' accustom'd vale  Shall by the lustre of the silent moon  Walk by her side attentive while her tongue  Unfolds the pow'rs of heav'n's resplendent train  Of magic numbers and mysterious spels  And feasts with knowledge my enraptur'd soul  SCENE THE FOURTEENTH  COLCHIANS  IAMBICS  Sire of Aeetes god rever'd  By our forefathers on their sands  Bleach'd by the Euxin's restless foam  Effulgent origin of day  Who with illimitable view  As from the amberportal'd east  Thy coursers fieryman'd proceed  See'st the deepbosom'd woes of men  TROCHAICS  Whether plac'd in mildest climes  Or beneath thy sultry wheels  Whether freezing near the pole  All the various race of care  IAMBICS  Yet to thy sad paternal eye  Can this diversity of grief  Not one present through all thy course  To match thy own Medea's pain  Lo ev'ry flow'r of wisdom fades  Within her large and fertile breast  A desart now by tempests rang'd  The seat of wild discordant thoughts  TROCHAICS  God of wisdom and of light  O relume her darken'd soul  Let her though begirt with ills  Still thy progeny be known  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT THE FIFTH  SCENE THE FIRST  THEANO descending from the temple AESON and COLCHIANS  AESON  WHERE is the priestess Colchian  FIRST COLCHIAN  There descending  Pale consternation overcasts her visage  THEANO  O most portentous execrable sight  I led the virgins to rejoin your princess  Who had escap'd their care Mysterious heav'n  Where was thy pow'r to check a mother's rage  Where was thy mercy when her savage hand  Unclos'd the jaws of slaughter on her children  AESON  Oh allsurpassing evil  FIRST COLCHIAN  When and how  Oh speak  THEANO  A knife of sacrifice she seiz'd  And in their tender bosoms plung'd its point  We found her planted near their welt'ring limbs  Her fiery eyeballs on their wounds were fix'd  A ghastly triumph swell'd her wild revenge  And madness mingled smiles with horror  AESON  Horror  Is my companion now The race of Jason  One common crime hath swallow'd in its gulph  THEANO  The goddess bow'd in pity from her shrine  When straight a voice oracular in thunder  Whose awful clamour must have reach'd your ears  Peal'd o'er the rocking temple "Impious Creon"  The voice proclaim'd "thy guilt hath fill'd its measure  "Then fall thou victim to the gods of hell"  AESON  Tremendous sentence  THEANO  I with fearful steps  Haste to the palace  AESON  Make me thy associate  And I to calm his violence will join  SCENE THE SECOND  COLCHIANS MEDEA rushing from the temple PHAEACIANS following  FIRST COLCHIAN  Behold where dropping with her children's blood  The lost Medea comes  MEDEA  It is begun  Now to complete my vengeance will I mount  The burning chariot of my bright forefather  The rapid steeds o'er Corinth will I drive  And with the scatter'd lightnings from their manes  Consume its walls its battlements and tow'rs  Its princes people palaces and temples  Then as the flames embrace the purple clouds  And the proud city crumbles from its base  The demon of my rage and indignation  All grim and wrapt in terror shall bestride  The mountainous embers and denounce abroad  To gods and men my wrongs and my revenge  FIRST COLCHIAN  How is thy wisdom exil'd from thy breast  Its native seat nor leaves one trace behind  To shew it once was there  MEDEA  Weep'st thou old man  Ha speak thou venerable mourner speak  Thy cause of anguish Hadst thou not a daughter  Wise like Minerva like the morning fair  And once thy dearest comfort Hath she left thee  Left thy decrepit head for grief to seize  And dash against the tomb Weep weep old man  The slight remainder of thy days exhaust  In lamentation she is lost for ever  Lost to herself and thee and never more  Shalt thou the beauty of her face contemplate  Nor hear again the wisdom of her tongue  FIRST COLCHIAN  Thou dost mistake me for the stern Aeetes  I am but one among th' unnumber'd Colchians  Who mourn in thee their nation's glory fall'n  MEDEA  I well deserve this pity yours and yours  Who kindly weep around me As I pass  I wade through seas of tears I hear no sound  But sighs and groans from sorrowbeaten breasts  Dishevell'd fragments of uprooted hairs  From the wild head of anguish fly about me  Is it not fitting When Medea mourns  Shall not the skies assume their blackest robes  And scowl upon mankind Medea sighs  Shall not hell groan and heav'n reply in thunder  It is the offspring of the Sun who wrings  Her helpless hands who rends her scatter'd locks  My heart is cold The thread of life unwinds  Now triumph death Thy conquest is Medea  She sinks into the lap of a Phaeacian  FIRST COLCHIAN  Repose her harrass'd limbs with tend'rest care  If this delirious transport be no more  Than some short tumult of the heated brain  Refreshing sleep may cool that seat of thought  And wand'ring reason sojourn there again  Essay your vocal pow'r harmonious maids  Some new and soothing modulation chuse  Dress in persuasive melody your numbers  Whose artful cadence from the breaking heart  May steal its cares and fold them in oblivion  A PHAEACIAN  turning towards the sea  TROCHAICS  Azure god whose active waters  Beat with endless toil below  Calm the ruder blasts to slumber  While to yonder grove which bends  Stately o'er thy shaded bosom  Softlysighing gales aspire  And ye zephyrs which ascending  Fan the plumy verdure there  Lulling whispers drowsy murmurs  Through the trembling foliage breathe  O'er the wakeful brow of sorrow  Carebeguiling sleep to spread  Or my gentlysoothing measure  On your downy pinions bear  Through the griefdistemper'd spirit  With delusion sweet to steal  Till on music's lap dissolving  Madness lull its weary'd head  FIRST COLCHIAN  Your queen recovers and her look serene  Shews the mild beam of reason shines anew  MEDEA  Grief as o'erlabour'd with its cruel office  Awhile is pausing till its strength returns  I will at least possess the short relief  To see my infants Sure my faithful friends  From my sad heart no evils can erase  Maternal gladness at my children's sight  Go lead them from the temple They will smile  And lift my thoughts to momentary joy  Not gone my virgins Wherefore this delay  Why all aghast Why tremble thus your limbs  Ha whence this blood My hands are dipt in slaughter  Speak ye dumb oracles of terror speak  Rising  Where are my children My distracted brain  A thousand dreadful images recals  Imperfectly remember'd Speak I charge you  Where are my children Silent still and pale  Enough Fell pow'rs your purpose is accomplish'd  Medea's suff'rings are complete and full  FIRST COLCHIAN  The swelling passions struggle in her breast  And find no vent My everhonour'd mistress  This is the time for tears and exclamations  MEDEA  Can exclamations down the wind convey  From these retentive ears my children's groans  Or can this murd'rous hand by tears be whiten'd  Hear Neptune o'er this citadel emerge  To reach my crime or send the pow'r of whirlwinds  To sweep my footsteps from the stable earth  In rapid flight to Caucasus transport  And fix me shiv'ring on the pointed rock  Let Nemesis revive the breathless clay  Of my slain infants to the rav'nous beak  Their lips disfigure and their tender fingers  Arm with the vulture's talons that their wounds  May be imprinted on their mother's breast  With Promethean torture and her heart  In blood bewail the error of her hand  FIRST COLCHIAN  It was the act of ignorance and madness  Just Themis knows thy purity of mind  And will with pity cleanse that erring hand  MEDEA  Not the disburthen'd sluices of the skies  The wat'ry Nereids with the ocean's store  Nor all the tears which misery hath shed  Can from the mother wash her children's blood  Where shall I hide me from the piercing day  What man will grant protection to my guilt  What god afford me safeguard at his altar  Thou must alone receive me thou O earth  Then while I crush my bosom on thy surface  And grasp the dust within my struggling hands  Distain my limbs and strike my head against thee  At length in pity of my suff'rings sue  The loit'ring gods to rear the friendly bolt  And close my sorrows on thy peaceful breast  FIRST COLCHIAN  See Jason too unconscious of his loss  SCENE THE THIRD  COLCHIANS MEDEA PHAEACIANS and JASON  JASON  Is she restor'd  FIRST COLCHIAN  Restor'd to full sensation  Of her increas'd afflictions there she lies  JASON  They shall be soon diminish'd Fate at last  Hath folded up its inauspicious scroll  And fairer volumes open to our eyes  I see you doubt me all That pale dejection  Reveals distrust and fear I tell you Colchians  Prophetic Themis from her spotless shrine  When she unfolds the oracle of justice  Fills not her priest with more enraptur'd fervor  Than now her present deity supplies  To my stability of soul which marks  Success in prospect and will shew me still  Not less than Jason in the brightest hour  Yourselves can witness of his pass'd atchievements  Perhaps she sleeps  Looking attentively on Medea  FIRST COLCHIAN  Ah no  JASON  Then dearest woman  Look on me hear me trust me once again  I have resign'd Creüsa and her kingdom  I have appeas'd my father Creon's wrath  Is ineffectual now then deign to cast  One glance on Jason on thy suppliant husband  Return'd in tears of penitence and shame  But with redoubled tenderness and truth  MEDEA  Oh Jason Thou and I have once been happy  What are we now  JASON  Let thy forgiving breath  Revive my courage fetter'd yet and tame  With thy displeasure and my active love  Shall soon transport thee from this seat of woe  Then as we bound before the fav'ring gale  Shall fondly whisper we may still be happy  MEDEA  starting up  Survey these hands  JASON  What blood is this  MEDEA  Thy children's  JASON  Inhuman Creon Could thy malice chuse  No other victims than my blameless boys  I come incens'd Corinthians to divulge  This profanation through your madding streets  Myself will guide your torrent of revolt  And whelm its billows on this royal savage  MEDEA  If heav'n had once meant kindly to Medea  Some tyrant had been found some other hand▪  Than hers alone to spill her children's blood  The season for upbraiding is no more  But know thou wretched like myself that madness  Arm'd my blind rage against them and the deed  Now weighs me down to everlasting night  JASON  falling on his knees  O thou whose equal balance to mankind  Distributes justice and restoring mercy  If pray'rs from this polluted breast may reach  Thy pure abode exert thy righteous pow'r  Drop thy asswaging pity on her heart  On me exhaust the quiver of thy vengeance  MEDEA  Was not my portion of distresses large  Ye pow'rs obdurate Hath this heart refus'd  To sigh these eyes been sparing of their streams  Impell'd by indignation still my spirit  Would challenge your injustice which requir'd  My children's blood to mingle with my tears  Take back the mighty mind you fram'd to break  First rent by anguish then by guilt deform'd  Draws a poniard  A VOICE from the temple  Hold offspring of the Sun arise repair  To Juno's shrine reply not but obey  SCENE THE FOURTH  JASON COLCHIANS and PHAEACIANS  JASON  Celestial presence I adore thy greatness  Yet thy tremendous voice which rocks these bulwarks  Appals not me who bid destruction welcome  Hope which cements the structure of the heart  From mine is moulder'd and despair is lodg'd  Within the ruins  SCENE THE FIFTH  JASON COLCHIANS PHAEACIANS and LYCANDER  LYCANDER  Gods what new reverse  Hath cast the first of heroes to the earth  Thy mariners expect thee haste away  Too high the ferment rises Oh recall  Theano's last presage of black events  The wild impatience of religious rage  Stings ev'ry bosom Our Corinthian dames  Range through the streets with torches in their hands  Invoking Juno hymeneal Juno  An impulse more than natural directs  Those armed numbers to some hideous act  They breathe demoniac fury on the palace  Should Creon meet them he must fall Rise prince  I must attend thy flight Our timely absence  Will save our streets from homicide  JASON  No death  May reach me too  LYCANDER  For pity Ha the skies  Share in our tumult and a bloody veil  Hangs o'er the sick'ning sun The air wheels round us  Grim Neptune yonder shakes his stormy trident  Why heaves the loosen'd rock Why drop these clouds  In threat'ning murmurs from their dusky folds  Streak'd with sulphureous gleams  Thunder lightning and the stage darken'd  JASON  rising  This suits my soul  For its infernal journey all prepar'd  A pale attendant on my children's ghosts  In Tartarus to dwel while they repose  In blest Elysium  FIRST COLCHIAN  Look the holy priestess  Breaks from the palace in disorder'd haste  And to her temple flies In consternation  Old Aeson too is nigh  SCENE THE SIXTH  JASON COLCHIANS PHAEACIANS LYCANDER AESON and THESSALIANS  AESON  My son my son  JASON  If thou dost bring fresh evils thou art welcome  AESON  We found the harden'd king My words were vain  So were Theano's With a desp'rate band  Of life regardless and contemning Juno  Against her grove he sallies  CREON  behind the scenes  Since no longer  You dread my scepter you shall feel my sword  Which o'er your mangled carcasses shall hew  Its purple passage to chastise the author  Of this revolt and chace barbarians hence  LYCANDER  The king's rash voice He charges  A shout within  AESON  Hideous roar  Thunder and lightning  O Jove be merciful  LYCANDER  He gives the signal  And shews the tumult through those livid flames  JASON  I hear the clang of arms Unmov'd and cold  My heart rejects that onceenliv'ning sound  And sighs for dissolution Pause awhile  Sad spirit till Medea's fate is known  Then prompt my sword to justice on myself  AESON  That shout denounces triumph  LYCANDER  Yes and safety  To all but Creon Give the torrent way  SCENE THE SEVENTH  JASON COLCHIANS PHAEACIANS LYCANDER AESON THESSALIANS and CORINTHIANS  FIRST CORINTHIAN  Where is the honour'd priestess We will bring  If she so wills the sacrilegious head  Of our slain tyrant to her sacred feet  SCENE THE LAST  JASON COLCHIANS PHAEACIANS LYCANDER AESON THESSALIANS and CORINTHIANS falling back on each side of the stage as THEANO descends from the temple  LYCANDER  Be silent all Theano from the goddess  To this assembly moves Night flies before her  Earth seas and heav'ns are calm'd  THEANO  Ye sons of Corinth  Old men of Colchis and Thessalians hear  At length the gods restrain their vengeful rod  The dreadful scene is clos'd Iolchian prince  Thou from Aeetes' daughter art disjoin'd  Look where the goddess through th' aerial champain  Sends in a chariot drawn by winged dragons  That alltranscending woman into climes  Remote but whither is from thee conceal'd  JASON  Heav'n guide her fortunes This shall govern mine  Offers to fall on his sword and is prevented  THEANO  Unmanly desperation Will the grave  Hide thy disgrace or illtongu'd rumor die  When thou art ashes No Recall thy manhood  Thou hast a father's kingdom to redeem  Go save a nation These afflicted maids  These aged Colchians to their homes restore  Thus shall the censure which thy frailty merits  Be chang'd to blessings on thy gen'rous deeds  And time's light finger loosen from thy breast  Its root of care till peace of mind return  END OF THE LAST ACT
