a country life to all the bustle and danger of a campaign  Sturmwald  It may be so to you Signor Thomaso who slumber in the inglorious lap of peacebut war is my element glory is my mistress and I have courted her amid the cannon's thunder  Thomaso  Many men of many minds Captain for my part I always prefered a more quiet kind of courtship but i'faith you are a man of true gallantry to remain so partial to your mistress after having lost the use of a leg and an eye in her service  Sturmwald  A leg and an eye Pshatrifles while my honour a soldier's vital spark  has escap'd unhurt  You may be a very good apothecary Signor Thomaso and may understand lotions and potionsbut as to a soldier's honor  Theresa  Ah very true Captain He is a most provoking man tho' he is my husband For shame after

you smile upon your husband that is to be  Anna  Do not my dear father persist in this cruel solicitation  Thomaso  aside to her  Psha how can you be so obstinatethough the Captain is not very handsome he is very rich 'Tis true he is rather old but then you know you have the better chance of being a widow soon and as to his having but one eye it ought to be his recommendation for you'll have no trouble in discovering his blind side  Theresa  Lookee Annayou know my way of arguing and so does your father It is my pleasure that you marry Captain Sturmwald▪ and have him you shall  Guzman

inspires  Da Capo  Exeunt Anna Isabella and Guzman into the house  Theresa  Anna's reluctance is certainly owing to that impertinent slut her cousin I'm sure she doet not inherit her obstinacy from me When my mother proposed a husband to me I gave my consent without a moment's hesitation Didn't I my dear  Thomaso  True my love but then I had not lost any of my limbs in pursuit of glory like the Captain  Aside to her  Sturmwald  I was thinking whether I had not better talk to the young lady myself  Theresa  To be surehow the deuce else are you to gain her consent  Sturmwald  I'faith I will

while fancy hung  Of vows so sweet yet broken  They deeply sighing sung  " At every sound they hear  " With fond alarm they start  " Alternate hope and fear  " Now joy now pain impart"  But by each sound misguided  Alas they only find  Their tears their sighs derided  By mocking rain and wind  On every former token  Of love c  Anna  Isabella 'tis a whole week since I saw my Carlos how can he say he loves me and yet suffer them to marry me to this hateful German officer  Theresa  Within  Anna why don't you go to your chamber child  Isabella  Heavens your mother is not gone to bed yet  Anna

me seize this moment to elope with him  Carlos  To Isabella  And do you know Madam this unreasonable creature hesitates though she promised me long ago to elope whenever I could find an opportunity

pleasure of seeing a meagre bilious  gentlemanlike man within ten miles of the place  How comfortable it would be to live at Constantinople where the plague rages all the year  And then people laugh

lastsno chance of another influenzaI who am the physician am the only sick man in the parish  Perez  Yes your worship seems stuck up here by way of a medical scarecrow to frighten away sickness  Dr Bilioso  Or rather like an electrical conductorI save the neighbourhood from danger by attracting it to myselfAh I lost the only good patient I had in my friend Alvarezas fine a corpulentinactive subject as a physician would wish for What with repletion and want of exercise the good soul was always ailing I had great expectations from himbut he grew stingy as he grew richavarice produced abstinence and he starved away the only hopes I had left  Perez  There's the traveller who was taken ill at the next inn  Dr Bilioso  Aye the only person I have at present under my care and he is a foreignerno native would have behaved so civilly as to be taken illNot got well I hope  Perez  Yes so they saythe apothecary Thomaso was sent for to him last night  Dr Bilioso  What send for my enemymy antagonist Thomaso the apothecary A man of honour wou'd have sooner died under his physician's hands than have played him such a trick  Perez  And he took some of Thomaso's quack medicine  Dr Bilioso  O curse his quack medicineI hate all violent remediesthey make an end of a business so soonthey either kill or cure and then either way one loses the patient  Perez  And so Thomaso  Dr Bilioso  Oh rot himI'll go to the rascally quack directly my patients are my propertyand shall I tamely suffer my property to be taken from me I'll trounce the dog No no if a Doctor's patients are

 Yes  AIR ISABELLA  How mistaken is the lover  Who on words builds hopes of bliss  And fondly thinks we love discover  If perchance we answer  Yes  Prompted often by discretion  Is the seeming kind

fault'ring tongue comply  What avails the cold confession  If th' averted eyes deny  Happier far the experienc'd swain  Knows he triumph must attain  When in vain successless trial  Language gives the
