Virtues of TarWater furnish new Discoveries and Reflexions some of these I have thrown together and offer to the Public in hopes they may prove useful  It is a frequent Complaint that TarWater is made of bad Tar being of a reddish Colour sweetish or disagreeably insipid But though the Dregs of Tar are often foul and make foul TarWater and though Tar already used is often made use of by unfair Dealers a second if not a third Time which produceth a vile Potion void of the genuine Flavour and Virtue of TarWater Yet I apprehend these Defects may sometimes be ascribed rather to the Vessel wherein the TarWater is made than to the Tar itself  TarWater being made in an earthen Vessel unglazed or that hath lost Part of its Glazing may extract as it is a strong Menstruum from the Clay a fade Sweetishness offensive to the Palate It should seem therefore that the best Way of making TarWater is in a Stone Jug or earthen Vessel throughout  well glazed and as it will not fail to extract a Tincture from any metallic Vessel it should be warmed in a well glazed Pipkin rather than a Saucepan  By increasing the Proportion of Tar to the Water and by stirring it longer TarWater may be made strong enough for a Spoonful to impregnate a large Glass a Thing very useful on a Road  Those who in chronical Disorders or as a Preservative have for a long time drunk TarWater must in acute Cases drink the more  TarWater must be drunk warm in Agues Smallpox Measles and Fevers in Colics and Disorders of the Bowels in Gout also and Rheumatism in most other Ailments cold or warm at the Choice of the Patient  In Fevers the Patient cannot begin too soon or drink too much By undoubted Experience it is found to cool the hot and warm the cold and to be a most successful Medicine in Fevers notwithstanding its great Virtue in Palsies and Dropsies  When not long since an Inflammation attacked the Throat Breast and Lungs of Children and became general in my Neighbourhood Numbers were recovered by the Use of TarWater nor did I hear that any miscarried who used it though many perished who did not  Nor is it a Medicine less proper and efficacious in old Age At the same time that this inflammatory Distemper raged among the Children a Woman in her sixtyeighth Year from violent Cold was seized at once with Ague Colic and Jaundice of all which Maladies she was cured in a Fortnight by drinking three Pints of warm Tarwater every Day Numberless such Instances daily occur which shew it to be a safe and efficacious Medicine both for old and young  Evacuations by Sweat which usually render Patients very weak and dispirited have not the same bad Effects when produced by TarWater which I have frequently known to give high Spirits in all the Stages of a Fever and under the lowest Regimen therefore old People and weak Persons who cannot well bear common Evacuations are best cured by TarWater which in some Sort seemeth to renew those who are worn out with Age and Infirmities  TarWater is of singular Use in strengthening the Stomach and Bowels and agrees particularly well with Infants taken either by themselves or by the Nurse and best by both Though as it throws the ill Humours out into the Surface of the Skin it may render them for a Time perhaps unseemly with Eruptions but withal healthy and lively And I will venture to say that it lays in them the Principles of a good Constitution for the rest of their Lives  Nor is it only useful to the Bodies of Infants it hath also a good Effect on their Minds as those who drink it are observed to be remarkably forward and sprightly Even the most heavy lumpish and unpromising Infants appear to be much improved by it A Child there is in my Neighbourhood of fine Parts who at first seemed stupid and an Idiot but by constant Use of TarWater grew lively and observing and is now noted for Understanding beyond others of the same Age  Infants are easily brought to take it by Spoon and even grow to a Liking of it and as their Disorders arise chiefly from Indigestion they receive the greatest Benefit from a Medicine so well calculated to strengthen the Intestines and preserve them from Fits In a word if it were the common Practice to accustom Infants from the Beginning to take TarWater  this would greatly conduce to the Health both of their Minds and Bodies There is I am verily persuaded no one Thing in the power of Art or Nature that would so generally and effectually contribute to repair the Constitutions of our Gentry and Nobility by strengthning the Children and casting off in their Infancy those Impurities and Taints which they often bring into the World  An Infant may take one Quarter of a Pint in the Day warm by Spoonfuls less may do good and there is no fear of Excess When I consider the private Woe of Families as well as the public Loss occasioned by the Death of such an incredible Number of Infants under two Years of Age I cannot but insist on recommending TarWater both as a Remedy and Preservative in that tender Age which cannot bear the common Treatment and Methods of Physic or with safety take those Drugs which are fitter for grown Persons  Another Reason which recommends TarWater particularly to Infants and Children is the great Security it brings against the Smallpox to those that drink it who are observed either never to take that Distemper or to have it in the gentlest Manner  There is no Distemper more contagious and destructive than the Smallpox or more generally dreaded attended with worse Symptoms or that leaves behind it worse Effects I observe at the same time that TarWater is in no other Case a more safe and sure Remedy than in this of which Captain  Drape  's Certificate sworn to before the Mayor of  Liverpool  in the presence of several principal Persons of that Town is a most evident Proof  That one hundred and seventy Persons seized at once with the Smallpox deprived of all Conveniencies  and in the worst Circumstances of a narrow Ship and hot Climate should all recover by the single Medicine of TarWater except one who would not drink it is a matter of Fact so plain and convincing and so well attested as to leave no Doubt in Minds free from Prepossession about the Usefulness and Efficacy of TarWater in the Smallpox a Point I had been before sufficiently convinced of by many Instances in my own Neighbourhood  It hath been surmised by some celebrated Physicians that one Day a Specific may be discovered for the peculiar Venom of the Smallpox There seems to be some Reason for thinking that TarWater is such a Specific I say this on good Grounds having by many Experiments observed its Virtue in curing as well as in preventing that cruel Distemper during the whole Course of which it is to be drank warm a moderate Glass about Half a Pint every Hour in common Cases may suffice in bad Cases more may be given there is no Fear of Excess  Those who endeavour to discredit this cooling Cordial and salutary Medicine as an Inflamer of the Blood do very consistently decry its Use in the Smallpox but there can be nothing more clear full and satisfactory than Captain  Drape  's Affidavit to convince reasonable People of the great and surprising Efficacy of TarWater in the Cure of the Smallpox and consequently of the groundlesness of that Report which ascribes a heating or inflaming Quality to it And yet that groundless Report hath hindred many from reaping the Benefit they might otherwise have done from the Use of this Water which is of excellent Virtue in all kinds of inflammatory Disorders Fevers Quinsies Pleurisies and such like of the hot and inflamed Kind  whereof the Public as well as myself have known a Multitude of Examples  I ask whether the Fact sworn before the Magistrates of  Liverpool  be not a sufficient Answer to all that is objected from an inflaming Quality to TarWater Can any Instance be produced in the whole  Materia Medica  or History of Physic of the Virtue of a Medicine tried on greater Numbers or under greater Disadvantages or with greater Success or more credibly attested I wish for the common Good of Mankind that the same Experiment was tried in our Hospitals Probably the World would soon be relieved from that great and general Terror of the Smallpox  When I hear of the Devastations made by this Distemper in great Cities and populous Towns how many Lives are lost or as may be said thrown away which might have been in all likelihood easily preserved by the Use of a Medicine so cheap and obvious and in eyery one's power it seems Matter of great Concern and Astonishment and leaves one at a loss to guess at the Motives that govern human Actions in Affairs of the greatest moment The Experiment may be easily made if an equal Number of poor Patients in the Smallpox were put into two Hospitals at the same Time of the Year and provided with the same Necessaries of Diet and Lodging and for further Care let the one have a Tub of TarWater and an old Woman the other Hospital what Attendance and Drugs you please  In all obstinate Sores and Ulcers I very much recommend the drinking of TarWater and washing them with a strong Lotion of it will hasten the Cure  One of the most painful and dangerous Cases is that of a Woman's fore Breast How many poor  Creatures after long languishing in Misery are obliged to suffer the most severe chirurgical Operations often the cutting off the entire Breast The Use of TarWater in those Cases hath been attended with such Success that I do earnestly recommend the drinking thereof both as a Cure and Preservative as a most effectual Medicine to remove the shooting Pains that precede a Cancer and also to cure the Cancer itself without Amputation Cancerous and sore Breasts are such cruel Cases occasioned by so many internal Causes as well as outward Accidents that it is a necessary Piece of Humanity to contribute all we can to the Prevention and Cure thereof  In the King's Evil Leprosy and foulest Cases TarWater cannot be too much recommended The poor Vagabonds of  Ireland  are many of them infected and eaten up with the foul Disease which with them passeth for a Canker as they call it Several Instances of extraordinary Cures have been performed on such Persons by drinking TarWater copiously for some Weeks or Months together without Confinement or other Restraint than that of a regular cool Diet It is indeed a Specific both for this and all other Taints and Impurities of the Blood  An Extract of  Siris  was made and Accounts of the Effects of TarWater were reprinted in  America  in which Continent as well as in the Islands much Use hath been made thereof particularly by those who possess great Numbers of Slaves Of this I have been informed by Letters and by Word of Mouth from Persons belonging to those Parts who have assured me of the extensive and successful Use of this Medicine in many Cases and more especially in the most inveterate Kinds of the soul Disease  I need not say how dearly they purchase Health who obtain it by Salivation and yet long and severe as that Course is it is often unsuccessful There are Instances of such as having passed through it with much Misery and Patience have been afterwards cured by the simple Use of TarWater  The King's Evil so lothsom in its Symptoms and Effects and withal so difficult if at all possible to cure by any other Method is most surely and easily cured by the TarWater even when the Patient is far gone even when he derives it from his Ancestors A Quart  per diem  for a few Months I have known to cure the most deplorable and abandoned Cases  How many wealthy Families otherwise at their Ease are corrupted with this Taint in their Blood How many want Heirs and Husbands through this odious Malady A Specific for this Disease alone would be justly esteemed a most valuable Secret and the plenty and cheapness of the Medicine ought not in Reason to make it less esteemed  Salivating Bleeding and Purging are attended with great Hardships and Inconveniencies even where the Patient recovers reducing the Strength and Spirits of those who use them whereas TarWater greatly adds to both  In Fractures and Wounds a Quart or two drank daily while the Patient is under Cure doth very much assuage the Pain and promote his Recovery both as by its balsamic Nature it disposeth the Parts to heal and also as it lessens if not totally prevents the Fever  A poor Boy in  Cloyne  having fallen from a Tree broke both Arm and Wrist This Accident was concealed or neglected for two or three Weeks he was then put under the Care of a skilful Bonesetter  who finding the Bones knit and grown crooked and that it would be necessary to break them again in order to set them right and withal considering the hot Season of the Year in  July  he apprehended his Patient's being thrown into a Fever that might prove fatal But the Boy being made to drink copiously of TarWater this prevented or lessened the Fever in such sort that the Bones were broke and set again and the Cure proceded as easily and speedily as Could be wished  I have known several Instances of Bruises and Wounds cured by TarWater A Person in my Neighbourhood ran over by a Horse was much bruised and cured only by drinking TarWater Another knocked down with a Mallet thereupon thrown into a violent Fever and given for dead another wounded with an Axe so that his Life was thought in danger were both recovered by the Use of TarWater which as it is sovereign against Gangrenes and Fevers hath great Success in all Sorts of Wounds Contusions and Fractures being taken throughout the whole chirurgical Process along with whatsoever other Methods or Remedies are applied  TarWater operates variously In Dropsies and Bruises it hath been known to work by purging The stronger Kind being used as a Wash is good against ulcerous Eruptions But in all Cases where the Lotion is used I believe the drinking of TarWater might alone suffice albeit the Sores may be longer withering and drying away  There is a certain Age or Time of Life when the female Sex runs no small Risk from the ceasing of their natural Evacuations In this Case TarWater is a good Preservative purifying the Blood and clearing it from that cancerous Tendency which it is sometimes subject to about that time I take it  to be a Specific in all cancerous Cases even the bleeding Cancer esteemed incurable by Physicians hath been cured by TarWater  In Diseases peculiar to Women it is of no small Use Several who had suffered much by Accidents in Childbearing have found themselves relieved by TarWater In all Sorts of Tumours Wens and praeternatural Excrescences it hath been found an excellent Remedy  Many dangerous Symptoms and even sudden Death are often owing to a Polypus in some or other of the Vessels through which the Blood circulates than which it seems there is no inward Cause of Death or Disease more to be dreaded and guarded against how many drop down dead in our Streets or at Table or in the midst of Business or Diversions how many are found dead in their Beds  Tremors Palpitations of the Heart irregular Pulses Apoplexies sudden Deaths often proceed from a slow stagnating interrupted Motion or stoppage of the Blood in its Circulation through the Body and there seemeth to be no Cause so certainly productive of obstructed Circulation as the Polypus a Case perhaps much more frequent than is commonly imagined  Morgagni  the celebrated Professor at  Padua  and most eminent Anatomist who was supposed to have dissected more human Bodies than any Man living assured me above thirty Years ago that in the far greater Part of such Bodies he found Polypuses if not in the Ventricles of the Heart or larger Vessels yet in some other Vessel or Cavity to which he attributes many Disorders and which he supposed to be formed by the obstructed Motion of the Blood To prevent this he dissuaded from all tight Ligatures especially in Sleep unbuttoning the Neck and Wristbands of his Shirt every Night a Practice he  had learned as he said from his Master the famous  Malpighi  When the Circulation is once quite stopped nothing can restore it which would be the same thing as restoring a dead Man to Life and in Proportion as the Circulation of the Blood is obstructed the Body is disordered Total Obstruction is Death partial Obstruction is Disease The Polypus therefore is always hurtful if not mortal It is indeed matter of serious Reflexion that we may probably carry about with us a Principle of Death always at work within and of a Nature so violent and sudden in its Effects so hard to come at and so difficult to subdue  It may well be thought at first View a vain Undertaking to attempt to dissolve a fleshy or membranous Substance so latent and inaccessible by common Means or Medicines But as TarWater hath been undoubtedly known to dissolve and disperse Wens and other fleshy or membranous Tumours in the outward Parts of the Body  See the Effects of Tar Water Sect and  having been drank and circulated with the Blood it should seem by a Parity of Reason that it may also dissolve and put an End to those Concretions that are formed in the Ventricles of the Heart or Blood Vessels and so remove one great Cause of Apoplexies and sudden Death and what cures may prevent I have been the longer on this Subject for the sake of many who lead sickly Lives as well as several who are snatched away by untimely Death  Universally in all Cases where other Methods fail I could wish this of TarWater was tried It hath been sometimes known that the most inveterate Headaches and other nervous Disorders  that would yield to no other Medicine have been cured by a Course of TarWater regularly and constantly pursued  Wheresoever pure Blood or Plenty of Spirits are wanting it may be concluded from manifold Experience that TarWater is of singular Benefit Several Persons have acknowledged themselves to be much fitter to go through Business or Study from the Use of it  Nor is it only medicinal to human Kind it is also of no small use in the Curing of brute Animals It hath been tried on several Kinds particularly with great Success in the late epidemical Distemper of our Horses And I have been credibly informed that being drank in plenty it hath recovered even a glandered Horse that was thought incurable  And as it is of such extensive use both to Man and Beast it should seem that a Tub of TarWater constantly supplied in a MarketTown would serve in some sort for an Hospital Many other Drugs are not easily got this is every where plenty and cheap many are of a doubtful Nature this of known Innocence others soon perish this lasts for Years and is not the worse for keeping This in short is a Medicine for the common People being a safe and cheap Remedy for such as cannot afford to be long sick or to make use of costly Medicines  A Patient who drinks TarWater must not be alarmed at Pustules or Eruptions in the Skin these are good Symptoms and shew the Impurities of the Blood to be cast out It is also not amiss to observe that as TarWater by its active Qualities doth stir the Humours entering the minutest Capillaries and dislodging Obstructions it may happen that this working shall sometimes be felt in the Limbs  or discharge itself in a Fit of the Gout which however disagreeable proves salutary  I am credibly informed of several strange Conveyances which TarWater hath found out whereby to discharge Impurities from the human Constitution A Person who had been in a bad state of Health above twenty Years upon a Course of TarWater was thrown into a most extraordinary Fit of an Ague and from that time recovered a good State of Health An old Gentleman in the County of  Cork  who for a long time had been a Valetudinarian afflicted with many Infirmities being advised to drink TarWater found himself relieved but it produced and soon cured a Pthiriasis or lousy Distemper in which the putrid Humours having discharged themselves left him quite sound and healthy  In a Course of TarWater if any Disorder happens from some other Cause as from Cold from the use of strong Liquors from a Surfeit or such like Accident it would not be fair to impute it to TarWater and yet this hath been sometimes done  The Effects of Vomiting occasioned by TarWater are not to be apprehended Some are discouraged from drinking because their Stomachs cannot bear it But when it takes a turn towards working upwards Nature by that very way hath been often known to carry on the Cure A worthy Gentleman Member of Parliament came into my Neighbourhood in the Autumn of the Year he was cachectic and extremely reduced so that his Friends thought him near his End Upon his entering into a Course of TarWater it produced a prodigious Vomiting which weakened him much for the present but persisting to continue the Use  thereof for about two Months he was restored to his Health Strength and Spirits  TarWater is very diuretic thereby preventing Stone and Gravel and carrying off by Urine those Salts that might otherwise occasion Fevers Rheumatisms Dropsies Headaches and many other Disorders if retained in the Blood Hence some have apprehended a Diabetes from the continued Use thereof but it is so far from causing a Diabetes that it hath been known to cure that Disorder  The Constitution of a Patient sometimes requireth during a Course of TarWater that he take Water and Honey also rosted Apples stewed Prunes and other Diet of an opening Kind A Hint of this is sufficient If the Reader now and then meets with some Remarks contained in my former Writings on this Subject he may be pleased to consider I had rather repeat than forget what I think useful to be known  Some endeavouring to discourage the Use of TarWater in  England  have given out that it may indeed be serviceable in  Ireland  where People live on such low Diet as sour Milk and Potatoes but it cannot be of the same Service in  England  where Men are accustomed to a more liberal and hearty Food and indeed it must be owned that the Peasants in this Island live but poorly but no People in  Europe  live better in the Sense of Eating and Drinking than our Gentry and Citizens and from these the Instances of Cures by TarWater have been chiefly taken Those who would confine its Use to the moist Air and poor Diet of  Ireland  may be assured that all over  Europe  in  France  and  Germany Italy Portugal  and  Holland  TarWater works the same Effect In both  North  and  South  in  West  and  EastIndies  it hath been  used and continues to be used with great Success It hath reached all our Colonies both on the Continent and the Islands and many Barrels of TarWater have been sent from  Amsterdam  to  Batavia  of all which I have had authentic Accounts But its Use is no where more conspicuous than at Sea in curing that Plague of seafaring Persons the Scurvy as was found in the late Attempt to discover a northwest Passage and as I doubt not will be found as oft as it is tried Every Ship in his Majesty's Navy should always have a Vessel of TarWater upon Deck for the Use of the Sailors both in the Scurvy and other Maladies  It is indeed a Medicine equally calculated for all Climates for Sea and Land for rich and poor high and low Livers being as hath been elsewhere mentioned a Cordial which doth not heat a peculiar Privilege this and of excellent Use That it is a Cordial is manifest from its cheering and enlivening Quality and that it is not heating is as manifest from its singular Use in all Cases where the Blood is inflamed As this Medicine imparts a genial friendly Warmth suited to the human Constitution those who pass through a Course of TarWater would do well not to increase such friendly Warmth to an inflaming Heat by a wrong Regimen of highseasoned Food and strong Liquors which are not wanted by the Drinkers of TarWater There is a certain Degree of Heat necessary to the Wellbeing and Life of Man More than this will be uneasy and this Uneasiness indicates a proper Choice of Diet  I have myself drank above a Gallon of TarWater in a few Hours and been cooled and recovered from a Fever by it So many Instances of the same Nature I have known as would make it evident to any unprejudiced Person that TarWater  is a cooling Medicine of which Truth I am as thoroughly convinced as it is possible to be of any Theorem in Physic or natural Science  The Unsuccessfulness of other Methods should rather be an Encouragement than a Bar to the Trial of TarWater A young Lady Daughter to a worthy Gentleman near  Cork  had been long afflicted with a grievous Pain in her Side and having had the best Advice that could be got was not relieved until she drank TarWater which quite removed her Pain Some time after she was again seized with the same Disorder but returning to the Use of TarWater she grew well and still continues so  A Woman turned out of the Infirmary at  Cork  as incurable because she would not submit to the cutting off her Leg came to  Cloyne  where she continued half a Year drinking TarWater and living upon Bread and Milk by which Course she recovered and went to Service  There is at present while I am writing a most remarkable Case here at  Cloyne  of a poor Soldier in a Dropsy whose Belly was swoln to a most immoderate Size He said he had been five Months in an Hospital at  Dublin  and having tried other Methods in vain left it to avoid being tapped It is a Fortnight since he came to  Cloyne  during which Time he hath drunk two Quarts of TarWater every Day His Belly is now quite reduced his Appetite and Sleep which were gone are restored he gathers Strength every Moment and he who was despaired of seems to be quite out of Danger both to himself and to all who see him It is remarkable that upon drinking the TarWater he voided several Worms of a very extraordinary Size This Medicine which is observed to make some Persons costive is to hydropic Patients a strong  Purge The present is but one of several Instances wherein the Dropsy hath been cured by TarWater which I never knew to fail in any Species of that Malady  I am very credibly informed that an aged Clergyman of  Maidstone  in  Kent  being reduced to the last Extremity by the Gout in his Stomach after having tried strong Liquors and the Methods usual in that Case without Success betook himself to drink a vast Quantity of warm TarWater still replenishing and letting it take its Course by which it pleased God to deliver him from the Jaws of Death  A Gentleman in the County of  Clare  near  Ennis  had a Fever and Pleurisy and Inflammation of the Lungs being at the last Extremity and given over by two Physicians he was advised to drink TarWater which he did eight Quarts Next Morning one of the Doctors asking at what Hour his Patient died to his great Surprise found he was recovered This I had from a ParliamentMan his Neighbour  When the yellow Fever as it was called raged in the  WestIndies  the Negroes with a Tub of TarWater in their Quarters did well but some of the better Sort miscarried among whom the Physician himself lay at the Point of Death but his Brother recovered him by pouring down his Throat in Spoonfuls some of the same Liquor that recovered the Negroes The Fact was related to me by a Gentleman who was then in the Island of  St Christopher's  and knew it to be true  A Physician himself not long since assured me he had cured an Ulcer in the Bladder by ordering his Patient to drink TarWater when he had tried all other Methods in vain and thought the Case incurable  But it would be endless to relate the Effects of TarWater in desperate Cases The Recovery of Mrs  Wilson  Daughter to the late Bishop of  London  from a lingering hopeless Disorder was a noted Case and attested to by his Lordship I have even been informed upon good Authority of two or three Instances wherein Persons have been recovered by TarWater after they had Rattles in the Throat  In certain Cases a smaller Quantity of TarWater hath proved ineffectual when a larger hath perfected the Cure A Woman of  Cloyne  got cold after Childbearing which occasioned a great Pain in her Thigh Swelling also and Redness she continued in great Torment above three Weeks She then began to drink TarWater but not drinking much she did not perceive much good and when there was not any Hopes of her Life she was persuaded to try what a Gallon a Day might do upon this she grew better the Swelling broke and ran no Dressing was used but Tar and no Washing but TarWater until she was quite recovered  In Ailments of an odd and untried Nature it may be worth while to try TarWater In Proof of this many Instances might be given A Gentleman with a wither'd Arm had it restored by drinking TarWater Another who by running his Head against a Post had a Concussion of the Brain attended with very bad Symptoms recovered by drinking TarWater after other Medicines had failed In my own Neighbourhood one had lost the use of his Limbs by Poison another had been bitten by a mad Ass these Persons drank TarWater and their Cure was attributed to it  When TarWater is copiously drank in Fevers the great Danger to be guarded against is an excessive Flow of Spirits which excites the Patient to  talk and divert himself with Company which may produce a Relapse of this I have known fatal Effects  If in a Course of Tar Water the Patient should find himself heated let him abstain from or lessen his Dose of spirituous and fermented Liquors for TarWater alone never heats  In chronical Disorders it is not adviseable to break off a Course of TarWater at once but rather to diminish the Quantity by Degrees  The Acid alone hath not the medicinal Virtues of TarWater This is agreeable to Reason and Experience as well as the Opinion of the ablest Judges Doctor  Linden  justly observes  "that when the empyreumatic Oil is entirely separated from the Acid it is not in any Shape superior to any other distilled Acids or Vinegars whatsoever"  Treatise on Selter Water  p  Something of this Nature hath been long expected and hoped for if we may credit that learned Chymist Dr  Linden  "at last saith he the long delayed Wishes of the most eminent Men of the Faculty are fulfilled in the B of  Cyne  's Discovery"  See  Treatise on Selter Water  p  Again speaking of empyreumatic Oils of Plants he hath these Words  "There has always prevailed a Notion among the Chymists and particularly with  Paracelsus  and his Followers that in those Oils there lay a great Secret undiscovered This Notion was occasioned by the strange Effects which a small Quantity thereof hath upon the human Machine Several have been very diligent to discover this Secret and to find out a Method to administer these Oils with Safety yet nothing was performed salutary until the B of  C  discovered to us the TarWater to him alone we are indebted for rendering the empyreumatic Oils a safe Medicine in every respect"  Ibid  p  That extraordinary Virtues should be contained in TarWater will not seem strange if we consider that Pitch is nothing else but hardened Tar or Tar  drained of its Moisture and that an extraordinary Quantity of Light is retained in the Substance of Pitch as appears from certain Electrical Experiments which having been made since seem not a little to confirm what had before been suggested in  Siris  AN ESSAY Towards preventing the RUIN of GREATBRITAIN  Avaritia fidem probitatem caeterasque artes bonas subvertit pro his superbiam

CICERO  Omnes aut de honoribus suis aut de praemiis pecuniae aut de persequendis inimicis agebant  CAESAR  First Printed in  London  A D MDCCXXI  AN ESSAY c  WHETHER the Prosperity that preceded or the Calamities that succeed the South Sea Project have most contributed to our undoing is not so clear a Point as it is that we are actually undone and lost to all Sense of our true Interest nothing less than this could render it pardonable to have Recourse to those old fashioned trite Maxims concerning Religion Industry Frugality and public Spirit which are now forgotten but if revived and put in practice may not only prevent our final Ruin but also render us a more happy and flourishing People than ever  Religion hath in former Days been cherished and reverenced by wise Patriots and Lawgivers as knowing it to be impossible that a Nation should thrive and flourish without Virtue or that Virtue should subsist without Conscience or Conscience without Religion insomuch that an Atheist or Infidel was looked on with Abhorrence and treated as an Enemy to his Country But in these wiser Times a cold Indifference for the national Religion and indeed for all Matters of Faith and divine Worship is thought good Sense It is even become fashionable to decry Religion and that little Talent of Ridicule is applied to such wrong Purposes that  a good Christian can hardly keep himself in Countenance  Liberty is the greatest human Blessing that a virtuous Man can possess and is very consistent with the Duties of a good Subject and a good Christian but the present Age aboundeth with injudicious Patrons of Liberty who not distinguishing between that and Licentiousness take the surest Method to discredit what they would seem to propagate for in effect can there be a greater Affront offered to that just Freedom of Thought and Action which is the Prerogative of a rational Creature or can any Thing recommend it less to honest Minds than under Colour thereof to obtrude Scurrility and Profaneness on the World But it hath been always observed of weak Men that they know not how to avoid one Extreme without running into another  Too many of this Sort pass upon vulgar Readers for great Authors and Men of profound Thought not on account of any Superiority either in Sense or Stile both which they possess in a very moderate Degree nor of any Discoveries they have made in Arts and Sciences which they seem to be little acquainted with but purely because they flatter the Passions of corrupt Men who are pleased to have the Clamours of Conscience silenced and those great Points of the Christian Religion made suspected which withheld them from many Vices of Pleasure and Interest or made them uneasy in the Commission of them  In order to promote that laudable Design of effacing all Sense of Religion from among us they form themselves into Assemblies and proceed with united Counsels and Endeavours with what Success and with what Merit towards the Public the Effect too plainly shews I will not say these  Gentlemen have formed a direct Design to ruin their Country or that they have the Sense to see half the ill Consequences which must necessarily flow from the spreading of their Opinions but the Nation feels them and it is high time the Legislature put a stop to them  I am not for placing an invidious Power in the Hands of the Clergy or complying with the narrowness of any mistaken Zealots who should incline to persecute Dissenters but whatever Conduct common Sense as well as Christian Charity obligeth us to use towards those who differ from us in some Points of Religion yet the public Safety requireth that the avowed Contemners of all Religion should be severely chastised and perhaps it may be no easy matter to assign a good Reason why Blasphemy against God should not be inquired into and punished with the same Rigour as Treason against the King  For though we may attempt to patch up our Affairs yet it will be to no Purpose the Finger of God will unravel all our vain Projects and make them Snares to draw us into greater Calamities if we do not reform that scandalous Libertinism which whatever some shallow Men may think is our worst Symptom and the surest Prognostic of our Ruin  Industry is the natural sure Way to Wealth this is so true that it is impossible an industrious free People should want the Necessaries and Comforts of Life or an idle enjoy them under any Form of Government Money is so far useful to the Public as it promoteth Industry and Credit having the same Effect is of the same Value with Money but Money or Credit circulating through a Nation from hand to hand without producing Labour and Industry in the Inhabitants is direct Gaming  It is not impossible for cunning Men to make such plausible Schemes as may draw those who are less skilful into their own and the public Ruin But surely there is no Man of Sense and Honesty but must see and own whether he understands the Game or not that it is an evident Folly for any People instead of prosecuting the old honest Methods of Industry and Frugality to sit down to a public Gamingtable and play off their Money one to another  The more Methods there are in a State for acquiring Riches without Industry or Merit the less there will be of either in that State this is as evident as the Ruin that attends it Besides when Money is shifted from hand to hand in such a blind fortuitous Manner that some Men shall from nothing in an instant acquire vast Estates without the least Desert while others are as suddenly stript of plentiful Fortunes and left on the Parish by their own Avarice and Credulity what can be hoped for on the one hand but abandoned Luxury and Wantonness or on the other but extreme Madness and Despair  In short all Project for growing rich by sudden and extraordinary Methods as they operate violently on the Passions of Men and encourage them to despise the slow moderate Gains that are to be made by an honest Industry must be ruinous to the Public and even the Winners themselves will at length be involved in the public Ruin  It is an easy matter to contrive Projects for the Encouragement of Industry I wish it were as easy to persuade Men to put them in Practice There is no Country in Europe where there is so much Charity collected for the Poor and none where it is so ill managed If the Poortax was fixed at a Medium in every Parish taken from a Calculation  of the last ten Years and raised for seven Years by Act of Parliament that Sum if the common Estimate be not very wrong frugally and prudently laid out in Workhouses would for ever free the Nation from the Care of providing for the Poor and at the same time considerably improve our Manufactures We might by these means rid our Streets of Beggars even the Children the maimed and the blind might be put in a way of doing something for their Livelihood As for the small Number of those who by Age or Infirmities are utterly incapable of all Employment they might be maintained by the Labour of others and the Public would receive no small Advantage from the Industry of those who are now so great a Burden and Expence to it  The same Tax continued three Years longer might be very usefully employed in making high Roads and rendering Rivers navigable two Things of so much Profit and Ornament to a Nation that we seem the only People in  Europe  Who have neglected them  This was published before Turnpikes were erected  So that in the space of ten Years the Public may be for ever freed from a heavy Tax Industry encouraged Commerce facilitated and the whole Country improved and all this only by a frugal honest Management without raising one Peny extraordinary  The Number of People is both Means and Motives to Industry it should therefore be of great use to encourage Propagation by allowing some Reward or Privilege to those who have a certain Number of Children and on the other hand enacting that the Public shall inherit half the unintailed Estates of all who die unmarried of either Sex  Besides the immediate End proposed by the foregoing Methods they furnish Taxes upon Passengers and dead Bachelors which are in no sort grievous to the Subject and may be applied towards clearing the public Debt which all Mankind agree highly concerneth the Nation in general both Court and Country  Caesar  indeed mentions it as a Piece of Policy that he borrowed Money from his Officers to bestow it on the Soldiers which fixed both to his Interest and though something like this may pass for Skill at certain Junctures in civil Government yet if carried too far it will prove a dangerous Experiment  There is still Room for Invention or Improvement in most Trades and Manufactures and it is probable that Praemiums given on that Account to ingenious Artists would soon be repaid an hundredfold to the Public No Colour is so much wore in  Italy Spain  and  Portugal  as Black but our black Cloth is neither so lasting nor of so good a Dye as the  Dutch  which is the Reason of their ingrossing the Profit of that Trade this is so true that I have known  English  Merchants abroad wear black Cloth of  Holland  themselves and sell and recommend it as better than that of their own Country It is commonly said the Water of  Leyden  hath a peculiar Property for colouring Black but it hath been also said and passed current that good Glasses may be made no where but at  Venice  and there only in the Island of  Murano  which was attributed to some peculiar Property in the Air and we may possibly find other Opinions of that sort to be as groundless should the Legislature think it worth while to propose Praemiums in the foregoing or in the like Cases of general Benefit to the Public but I remember to have seen about seven Years ago a Man pointed at in a CoffeeHouse who they said  had first introduced the right scarlet Dye among us by which the Nation in general as well as many private Persons have since been great Gainers though he was himself a Beggar who if this be true deserved an honourable Maintenance from the Public  There are also several Manufactures which we have from abroad that may be carried on to as great Perfection here as elsewhere If it be considered that more fine Linen is wore in  GreatBritain  than in any other Country of  Europe  it will be difficult to assign a Reason why Paper may not be made here as good and in the same Quantity as in  Holland  or  France  or  Genoa  This is a Manufacture of great Consumption and would save much to the Public The like may be said of Tapestry Lace and other Manufactures which is set on foot in cheap Parts of the Country would employ many Hands and save Money to the Nation as well as bring it from abroad Projects for improving old Manufactures or setting up new ones should not be despised in a trading Country but the making them Pretences for Stockjobbing hath been a fatal Imposition  As Industry dependeth upon Trade and this as well as the public Security upon our Navigation it concerneth the Legislature to provide that the Number of our Sailors do not decrease to which it would very much conduce if a Law were made prohibiting the Payment of Sailors in foreign Parts for it is usual with those on board MerchantMen as soon as they set foot on Shore to receive their Pay which is soon spent in riotous Living and when they have emptied their Pockets the Temptation of a Pistole present Money never faileth to draw them into any foreign Service To this if I may credit the Information I have had from some  English  Factors abroad it is chiefly owing that the  Venetians Spaniards  and others have so many  English  on board their Ships some Merchants indeed and Masters of Vessels may make a Profit in defrauding those poor Wretches when they pay them in strange Coin which I have been assured often amounts to twelve Pence in the Crown as well as in ridding themselves of the Charge of keeping them when they sell their Ships or stay long in Port but the Public lose both the Money and the Men who if their Arrears were to be cleared at home would be sure to return and spend them in their own Country It is a Shame this Abuse should not be remedied  Frugality of Manners is the Nourishment and Strength of Bodies politic It is that by which they grow and subsist until they are corrupted by Luxury the natural Cause of their Decay and Ruin Of this we have Examples in the  Persians Lacedaemonians  and  Romans  not to mention many later Governments which have sprung up continued a while and then perished by the same natural Causes But these are it seems of no use to us and in spite of them we are in a fair Way of becoming ourselves another useless Example to future Ages  Men are apt to measure national Prosperity by Riches it would be righter to measure it by the Use that is made of them Where they promote an honest Commerce among Men and are Motives to Industry and Virtue they are without doubt of great Advantage but where they are made as too often happens an Instrument to Luxury they enervate and dispirit the bravest People So just is that Remark of  Machiavel  that there is no Truth in the common Saying Money is the Nerves of War and though we may subsist tolerably for a Time among corrupt Neighbours yet if ever we  have to do with a hardy temperate religious Sort of Men we shall find to our Cost that all our Riches are but a poor Exchange for that Simplicity of Manners which we despise in our Ancestors This sole Advantage hath been the main Support of all the Republics that have made a Figure in the World and perhaps it might be no ill Policy in a Kingdom to form itself upon the Manners of a Republic  Simplicity of Manners may be more easily preserved in a Republic than a Monarchy but if once lost may be sooner recovered in a Monarchy the Example of a Court being of great Efficacy either to reform or to corrupt a People that alone were sufficient to discountenance the wearing of Gold or Silver either in Cloaths or Equipage and it the same were prohibited by Law the saving so much Bullion would be the smallest Benefit of such an Institution there being nothing more apt to debase the Virtue and good Sense of our Gentry of both Sexes than the trifling Vanity of Apparel which we have learned from  France  and which hath had such visible ill Consequences on the Genius of that People Wiser Nations have made it their Care to shut out this Folly by severe Laws and Penalties and its spreading among us can forbode no good if there be any Truth in the Observation of one of the Ancients that the direct Way to ruin a Man is to dress him up in fine Cloaths  It cannot be denied that Luxury of Dress giveth a light Behaviour to our Women which may pass for a small Offence because it is a common one but is in truth the Source of great Corruptions For this very Offence the Prophet  Isaiah  denounced a severe Judgment against the Ladies of his Time I shall give the Passage at length  'Moreover the LORD saith because the Daughters of  Zion  are  haughty and walk with stretched forth Necks and wanton Eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a Tinkling with their Feet therefore the LORD will smite with a Scab the Crown of the Head of the Daughters of  Zion  and the LORD will discover their secret Parts In that Day the Lord will take away the Bravery of their tinkling Ornaments about their Feet and their Cauls and their round Tires like the Moon the Chains and the Bracelets and the Mufflers the Bonnets and the Ornaments of the Legs and the Headbands and the Tablets and the Earrings the Rings and Nose jewels the changeable Suits of Apparel and the Mantles and the Wimples and the crisping Pins the Glasses and the fine Linen and the Hoods and the Vails And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet Smell there shall be a Stink and instead of a Girdle a Rent and instead of wellset Hair Baldness and instead of a Stomacher a Girding of Sackcloth and Burning instead of Beauty'  The Scab the Stench and the Burning are terrible pestilential Symptoms and our Ladies would do well to consider they may chance to resemble those of  Zion  in their Punishment as well as their Offence  But Dress is not the only Thing to be reformed sumptuary Laws are useful in many other Points In former Times the natural Plainness and good Sense of the  English  made them less necessary But ever since the luxurious Reign of King  Charles  the second we have been doing violence to our Natures and are by this time so much altered for the worse that it is to be feared the very same Dispositions that make them necessary will for ever hinder them from being enacted or put in Execution  A private Family in difficult Circumstances all Men agree ought to melt down their Plate walk on Foot retrench the Number of their Servants wear neither Jewels nor rich Cloaths and deny themselves expensive Diversions and why not the Public had any Thing like this been done our Taxes had been less or which is the same thing we should have felt them less But it is very remarkable that Luxury was never at so great a Height nor spread so generally through the Nation as during the Expence of the late Wars and the heavy Debt that still lieth upon us  This Vice draweth after it a Train of Evils which cruelly infest the Public Faction Ambition Envy Avarice and that of the worst kind being much more hurtful in its Consequences though not so infamous as Penury It was the great Art of Cardinal  Richelieu  by encouraging Luxury and Expence to impoverish the  French  Nobility and render them altogether dependent on the Crown which hath been since very successfully effected These and many more Considerations shew the Necessity there is for sumptuary Laws nor can any thing be said against them in this Island which might not with equal Force be objected in other Countries which have nevertheless judged the public Benefit of such Institutions to be of far greater Importance than the short Sufferings of a few who subsist by the Luxury of others  It is evident that old Taxes may be better born as well as new ones raised by sumptuary Laws judiciously framed not to damage our Trade but retrench our Luxury It is evident that for want of these Luxury which like the other Fashions never faileth to descend hath infected all Ranks of People and that this enableth the  Dutch  and  French  to undersell us to the great Prejudice of our  Traffic We cannot but know that in our present Circumstances it should be our Care as it is our Interest to make Poverty tolerable in short we have the Experience of many Ages to convince us that a corrupt luxurious People must of themselves fall into Slavery although no Attempt be made upon them These and the like obvious Reflections should one would think have forced any People in their Senses upon frugal Measures  But we are doomed to be undone Neither the plain Reason of the Thing nor the Experience of past Ages nor the Examples we have before our Eyes can restrain us from imitating not to say surpassing the most corrupt and ruined People in those very Points of Luxury that ruined them Our Gaming our Operas our Maskerades are in spite of our Debts and Poverty become the Wonder of our Neighbours If there be any Man so void of all Thought and common Sense as not to see where this must end let him but compare what  Venice  was at the League of  Cambray  with what it is at present and he will be convinced how truly those fashionable Pastimes are calculated to depress and ruin a Nation  But neither  Venice  nor  Paris  nor any other Town in any Part of the World ever knew such an expensive ruinous Folly as our Maskerade This alone is sufficient to inflame and satisfy the several Appetites for Gaming Dressing Intriguing luxurious Eating and Drinking It is a most skilful Abridgment the very Quintessence the abstract of all those senseless Vanities that have ever been the Ruin of Fools and Detestation of wise Men And all this under the Notion of an elegant Entertainment hath been admitted among us though it be in truth a Contagion of the worst Kind The Plague dreadful as it is is an Evil of short  duration Cities have often recovered and flourished after it but when was it known that a People broken and corrupt by Luxury recovered themselves not to say that general Corruption of Manners never faileth to draw after it some heavy Judgment of War Famine or Pestilence Of this we have a fresh Instance in one of the most debauched Towns of  Europe  Marseilles  and no Body knows how soon it may be our own Case This elegant Entertainment is indeed suspended for the present but there remains so strong a Propension towards it that if the Wisdom of the Legislature does not interpose it will soon return with the additional Temptation of having been forbid for a Time It were stupid and barbarous to declaim against keeping up the Spirit of the People by proper Diversions but then they should be proper such as polish and improve their Mind or increase the Strength and Activity of their Bodies none of which Ends are answered by the Maskerade no more than by those  French  and  Italian  Follies which to our Shame are imported and encouraged at a Time when the Nation ought to be too grave for such Trifles  It is not to be believed what Influence public Diversions have on the Spirit and Manners of a People The  Greeks  wisely saw this and made a very serious Affair of their public Sports For the same Reason it will perhaps seem worthy the Care of our Legislature to regulate the public Diversions by an absolute Prohibition of those which have a direct Tendency to corrupt our Morals as well as by a Reformation of the Drama which when rightly managed is such a noble Entertainment and gave those fine Lessons of Morality and good  Sense to the  Athenians  of old and to our  British  Gentry above a Century ago but for these last ninety Years hath entertained us for the most part with such wretched Things as spoil instead of improving the Taste and Manners of the Audience Those who are attentive to such Propositions only as may fill their Pockets will probably slight these Things as Trifles below the Care of the Legislature But I am sure all honest thinking Men must lament to see their Country run headlong into all those luxurious Follies which it is evident have been fatal to other Nations and will undoubtedly prove fatal to us also if a timely Stop be not put to them  Public Spirit that glorious Principle of all that is great and good is so far from being cherished or encouraged that it is become ridiculous in this enlightened Age which is taught to laugh at every Thing that is serious as well as sacred The same atheistical narrow Spirit centring all our Cares upon private Interest and contracting all our Hopes within the Enjoyment of this present Life equally produceth a Neglect of what we owe to God and our Country  Tully  hath long since observed  "that it is impossible for those who have no Belief of the Immortality of the Soul or a future State of Rewards and Punishments to sacrifice their particular Interests and Passions to the public Good or have a generous Concern for Posterity"  and our own Experience confirmeth the Truth of this Observation  In order therefore to recover a Sense of public Spirit it is to be wished that Men were first affected with a true Sense of Religion  pro aris focis  having ever been the great Motive to Courage and Perseverance in a public Cause  It would likewise be a very useful Policy and warranted by the Example of the wisest Governments to make the natural Love of Fame and Reputation subservient to promoting that noble Principle Triumphal Arches Columns Statues Inscriptions and the like Monuments of public Services have in former Times been found great Incentives to Virtue and Magnanimity and would probably have the same Effects on  Englishmen  which they have had on  Greeks  and  Romans  And perhaps a Pillar of Infamy would be found a proper and exemplary Punishment in Cases of signal public Villany where the Loss of Fortune Liberty or Life are not proportioned to the Crime or where the Skill of the Offender or the Nature of his Offence may skreen him from the Letter of the Law  Several of these are to be seen at  Genoa Milan  and other Towns of  Italy  where it is the Custom to demolish the House of a Citizen who hath conspired the Ruin of his Country or been guilty of any enormous Crime towards the Public and in place thereof to erect a Monument of the Crime and Criminal described in the blackest manner We have nothing of this sort that I know but that which is commonly called the Monument which in the last Age was erected for an Affair no way more atrocious than the modern unexampled Attempt  The  SouthSea  Project  of Men easy in their Fortunes and unprovoked by Hardships of any sort in cool Blood and with open Eyes to ruin their native Country This Fact will never be forgotten and it were to be wished that with it the public Detestation thereof may be transmitted to Posterity which would in some measure vindicate the Honour  of the present and be a useful Lesson to future Ages  Those noble Arts of Architecture Sculpture and Paintings do not only adorn the Public but have also an Influence on the Minds and Manners of Men filling them with great Ideas and spiriting them up to an Emulation of worthy Actions For this Cause they were cultivated and encouraged by the  Greek  Cities who vied with each other in building and adorning their Temples Theatres Porticos and the like public Works at the same Time that they discouraged private Luxury the very Reverse of our Conduct  To propose the building a Parliament House Courts of Justice Royal Palace and other public Edifices suitable to the Dignity of the Nation and adorning them with Paintings and Statues which may transmit memorable Things and Persons to Posterity would probably be laughed at as a vain Affair of great Expence and little Use to the Public and it must be owned we have reduced ourselves to such Straits that any Proposition of Expencesuiteth ill with our present Circumstances But how proper soever this Proposal may be for the Times yet it comes so properly into a Discourse of public Spirit that I could not but say something of it And at another Time it will not seem unreasonable if we consider that it is no more than the wisest Nations have done before us that it would spirit up new Arts employ many Hands keep the Money circulating at home and lastly that it would be a notable Instance of public Spirit as well as a Motive to it  The same noble Principle may be also encouraged by erecting an Academy of ingenious Men whose Employment it would be to compile the History of  GreatBritain  to make Discourses proper  to inspire Men with a Zeal for the Public and celebrate the Memory of those who have been Ornaments to the Nation or done it eminent Service Not to mention that this would improve our Language and amuse some busy Spirits of the Age which perhaps would be no ill Policy  This is not without Example for to say nothing of the  French  Academy which is prostituted to meaner Purposes it hath been the Custom of the  Venetian  Senate to appoint one of their Order to continue the History of the Republic This was introduced in the flourishing State of that People and is still in force We fall short of other Nations in the Number of good Historians though no Nation in Christendom hath produced greater Events or more worthy to be recorded The  Athenian  Senate appointed Orators to commemorate annually those who died in Defence of their Country which Solemnity was performed at the Monuments erected in Honour of them by the Public and the Panegyrics composed by  Isocrates  and  Pericles  as well as many Passages in  Tully  inform us with what Pleasure the ancient Orators used to expatiate in Praise of their Country  Concord and Union among ourselves is rather to be hoped for as an Effect of public Spirit than proposed as a Means to promote it Candid generous Men who are true Lovers of their Country can never be Enemies to one half of their Countrymen or carry their Resentment so far as to ruin the Public for the sake of a Party Now I have fallen upon the mention of our Parties I shall beg leave to insert a Remark or two for the Service both of Whig and Tory without entering into their respective Merits First it is impossible for either Party to ruin the other without involving themselves and their Posterity in the same Ruin  Secondly it is very feasible for either Paty to get the better of the other if they could first get the better of themselves and instead of indulging the little womanish Passions of Obstinacy Resentment and Revenge steadily promote the true Interest of their Country in those great clear Points of Piety Industry Sobriety of Manners and an honest Regard for Posterity which all Men of Sense agree are essential to public Happiness There would be something so great and good in this Conduct as must necessarily overbear all Calumny and Opposition But that Men should act reasonably is rather to be wished than hoped  I am well aware that to talk of public Spirit and the Means of retrieving it must to narrow sordid Minds be matter of Jest and Ridicule how conformable soever it be to right Reason and the Maxims of Antiquity Though one would think the most selfish Man might see it was their Interest to encourage a Spirit in others by which they to be sure must be Gainers Yet such is the Corruption and Folly of the present Age that a public Spirit is treated like Ignorance of the World and want of Sense and all the Respect is paid to cunning Men who bend and wrest the public Interest to their own private Ends that in other Times hath been thought due to those who were generous enough to sacrifice their private Interest to that of their Country  Such Practices and such Maxims as these must necessarily ruin a State But if the contrary should prevail we may hope to see Men in Power prefer the public Wealth and Security to their own and Men of Money make free Gifts or lend it without Interest to their Country This how strange and incredible soever it may seem to us hath been often done in other States And the  natural  English  Temper considered together with the Force of Example no one can tell how far a Proposal for a free Gift may go among the moneyed Men when set on foot by the Legislature and encouraged by the Example of two or three Men of Figure who have the Spirit to do a generous Thing and the Understanding to see it is every private Man's Interest to support that of the Public  If they who have their Fortunes in Money should make a voluntary Gift the Public would be eased and at the same time maintain its Credit Nor is a generous Love of their Country the only Motive that should induce them to this Common Equity requires that all Subjects should equally share the public Burden And common Sense shews that those who are foremost in the Danger should not be the most backward in contributing to prevent it  Before I leave this Subject I cannot but take notice of that most infamous Practice of Bribery than which nothing can be more opposite to public Spirit since every one who takes a Bribe plainly owns that he prefers his private Interest to that of his Country This Corruption is become a national Crime having infected the lowest as well as the highest among us and is so general and notorious that as it cannot be matched in former Ages so it is to be hoped it will not be imitated by Posterity  This calls to mind another national Guilt which we possess in a very eminent Degree there being no Nation under the Sun where solemn Perjury is so common or where there are such Temptations to it The making Men swear so often in their own Cases and where they have an Interest to conceal the Truth hath gradually wore off that awful Respect which was once thought due to an Appeal to Almighty God insomuch that Men now a Days break their Fast and a CustomHouse Oath  with the same Peace of Mind It is a Policy peculiar to us the obliging Men to perjure or betray themselves and hath had no one good Effect but many very ill ones Sure I am that other Nations without the hundredth Part of our Swearing contrive to do their Business at least as well as we do And perhaps our Legislature will think it proper to follow their Example For whatever Measures are taken so long as we lie under such a Load of Guilt as national Perjury and national Bribery it is impossible we can prosper  This poor Nation hath sorely smarted of late and to ease the present Smart a sudden Remedy as is usual in such Cases hath been thought of But we must beware not to mistake an Anodyne for a Cure Where the Vitals are touched and the whole Mass of Humours vitiated it is not enough to ease the Part pained we must look further and apply general Correctives otherwise the ill Humour may soon shew itself in some other Part  The  SouthSea  Affair how sensible soever is not the original Evil or the great Source of our Misfortunes it is but the natural Effect of those Principles which for many Years have been propagated with great Industry And as a sharp Distemper by reclaiming a Man from Intemperance may prolong his Life so it is not impossible but this public Calamity that lies so heavy on the Nation may prevent its Ruin It would certainly prove the greatest of Blessings if it should make all honest Men of one Party if it should put Religion and Virtue in Countenance restore a Sense of public Spirit and convince Men it is a dangerous Folly to pursue private Aims in Opposition to the Good of their Country if it should turn our Thoughts from Cozenage and Stockjobbing to Industry and frugal Methods of Life in fine if it should revive  and inflame that native Spark of  British  Worth and Honour which hath too long lain smothered and oppressed  With this View I have among so many Projects for remedying the ill State of our Affairs in a particular Instance ventured to publish the foregoing general Hints which as they have been thrown together from a Zeal for the public Good so I heartily wish they may be regarded neither more nor less than as they are fitted to promote that End  Though it must be owned that little can be hoped if we consider the corrupt degenerate Age we live in I know it is an old Folly to make peevish Complaints of the Times and charge the common Failures of human Nature on a particular Age One may nevertheless venture to affirm that the present hath brought forth new and portentous Villanies not to be paralleled in our own or any other History We have been long preparing for some great Catastrophe Vice and Villany have by degrees grown reputable among us our Infidels have passed for fine Gentlemen and our venal Traitors for Men of Sense who knew the World We have made a Jest of public Spirit and cancelled all Respect for whatever our Laws and Religion repute sacred The old  English  Modesty is quite worn off and instead of blushing for our Crimes we are ashamed only of Piety and Virtue In short other Nations have been wicked but we are the first who have been wicked upon Principle  The Truth is our Symptoms are so bad that notwithstanding all the Care and Vigilance of the Legislature it is to be feared the final Period of our State approaches Strong Constitutions whether politic or natural do not feel light Disorders But when they are sensibly affected the Distemper is for the most part violent and of an ill Prognostic  Free Governments like our own were planted by the  Goths  in most Parts of  Europe  and though we all know what they are come to yet we seem disposed rather to follow their Example than to profit by it  Whether it be in the Order of Things that civil States should have like natural Products their several Periods of Growth Perfection and Decay or whether it be an Effect as seems more probable of human Folly that as Industry produces Wealth so Wealth should produce Vice and Vice Ruin  God grant the Time be not near when Men shall say  'This Island was once inhabited by a religious brave sincere People of plain uncorrupt Manners respecting inbred Worth rather than Titles and Appearances Assertors of Liberty Lovers of their Country jealous of their own Rights and unwilling to infringe the Rights of others Improvers of Learning and useful Arts Enemies to Luxury tender of other Mens Lives and prodigal of their own inferior in nothing to the old  Greeks  or  Romans  and superior to each of those People in the Perfections of the other Such were our Ancestors during their Rise and Greatness but they degenerated grew servile Flatterers of Men in Power adopted Epicurean Notions became venal▪ corrupt injurious which drew upon them the Hatred of God and Man and occasioned their final Ruin'  A DISCOURSE ADDRESSED TO MAGISTRATES AND MEN in AUTHORITY OCCASIONED By the enormous Licence and Irreligion of the Times  GALLIO  cared for none of those Things  Acts Ch xviii Ver  First Printed A D MDCCXXXVI  A DISCOURSE ADDRESSED TO MAGISTRATES c  THE Pretensions and Discourse of Men throughout these Kingdoms would at first View lead one to think the Inhabitants were all Politicians and yet perhaps political Wisdom hath in no Age or Country been more talked of and less understood Licence is taken for the End of Government and popular Humour for its Origin No Reverence for the Law no Attachment to the Constitution little Attention to Matters of Consequence and great Altercation upon Trifles such idle Projects about Religion and Government as if the Public had both to choose a general Contempt of all Authority divine and human an Indifference about the prevailing Opinions whether they tend to produce Order or Disorder to promote the Empire of God or the Devil These are the Symptoms that strongly mark the present Age and this could never have been the Case if a Neglect of Religion had not made Way for it  When the  Jews  accused  Paul  upon religious Matters and Points of their Law before  Gallio  the  Roman  Magistrate it is said that GALLIO  cared for none of those Things  And it is to be feared there are not a few Magistrates in this Christian Country who think with the same Indifference on the subject of Religion Herein nevertheless they judge amiss and are much wanting to their Duty For although it be admitted that the Magistrate's peculiar Object is the temporal Welfare of the State yet this will by no Means exclude a proper Care about the prevailing Notions and Opinions of Religion which influence the Lives and Actions of Men and have therefore a mighty Effect on the Public Mens Behaviour is the Consequence on their Principles Hence it follows that in order to make a State thrive and flourish Care must be taken that good Principles be propagated in the Minds of those who compose it  It would be vain to depend on the outward Form the Constitution and Structure of a State while the Majority are ever governed by their inward Ways of thinking which at Times will break out and shew themselves paramount to all Laws and Institutions whatsoever It must be great Folly therefore to overlook Notion as Matters of small Moment to the State while Experience shews there is nothing more important and that a prevailing Disorder in the Principles and Opinions of its Members is ever dangerous to Society and capable of producing the greatest public Evils  Man is an Animal formidable both from his Passions and his Reason his Passions often urging him to great Evils and his Reason furnishing Means to atchieve them To tame this Animal and make him amenable to Order to inure him to a Sense of Justice and Virtue to withhold him  from ill Courses by Fear and encourage him in his Duty by Hopes in short to fashion and model him for Society hath been the Aim of civil and religious Institutions and in all Times the Endeavour of good and wise Men The aptest Method for attaining this End hath been always judged a proper Education  If Mens Actions are an Effect of their Principles that is of their Notions their Belief their Persuasions it must be admitted that Principles early sown in the Mind are the Seeds which produce Fruit and Harvest in the ripe State of Manhood How lightly soever some Men may speak of Notions yet so long as the Soul governs the Body Mens Notions must influence their Actions more or less as they are stronger or weaker and to Good or Evil as they are better or worse  Our Notions and Opinions are a constant Check on our Appetites and Balance to our Passions and although they may not in every Instance control and rule yet they will never fail strongly to affect both the one and the other What is it that bridles the impetuous Desires of Men That restrains them when they are driven by the most violent Passions In a word what is it that renders this World habitable but the prevailing Notions of Order Virtue Duty and Providence Some perhaps may imagine that the Eye of the Magistrate alone is sufficient to keep Mankind in Awe But if every Man's Heart was set to do all the Mischief his Appetite should prompt him to as often as Opportunity and Secrecy presented themselves there could be no Living in the World  And although too many of those intrusted with civil Power in these our Days may be said with GALLIO to  care for none of those Things  and many more who would pass for Men of Judgment  and Knowledge may look on Notions early imbibed before their Grounds▪ and Reasons are apprehended or understood to be but mere Prejudices yet this will detract nothing from their Truth and Usefulness To place this Matter in a due Light I propose to shew that a System of salutary Notions is absolutely necessary to the Support of every civil Constitution I shall enforce this Point by the Testimony of those who are esteemed the wisest Men and I shall make some Remarks on the modern prevailing Spirit and the Tendency of the Maxims of our Times  Order is necessary not only to the WellBeing but to the very Being of a State Now Order and Regularity in the Actions of Men is not an Effect of Appetite or Passion but of Judgment and the Judgment is governed by Notions or Opinions There must therefore of Necessity in every State be a certain System of salutary Notions a prevailing Set of Opinions acquired either by private Reason and Reflexion or taught and instilled by the general Reason of the Public that is by the Law of the Land True it is that where Men either cannot or will not use their own Reason think and examine for themselves in such Case the Notions taught or instilled into their Minds are embraced rather by the Memory than the Judgment Nor will it be any Objection to say that these are Prejudices inasmuch as they are therefore neither the less useful nor the less true although their Proofs may not be understood by all Men  Prejudices are Notions or Opinions which the Mind entertains without knowing the Grounds and Reasons of them and which are assented to without Examination The first Notions which take possession of the Minds of Men with regard to  Duties social moral and civil may therefore be justly stiled Prejudices The Mind of a young Creature cannot remain empty if you do not put into it that which is good it will be sure to receive that which is bad  Do what you can there will still be a Bias from Education and if so is it not better this Bias should lie towards Things laudable and useful to Society This Bias still operates although it may not always prevail The Notions first instilled have the earliest Influence take the deepest Root and generally are found to give a Colour and Complexion to the subsequent Lives of Men inasmuch as they are in Truth the great Source of human Actions It is not Gold or Honour or Power that move Men to act but the Opinions they entertain of those Things Hence it follows that if a Magistrate should say No Matter what Notions Men embrace I will take heed to their Actions therein he shews his Weakness for such as are Mens Notions such will be their Deeds  For a Man to do as he would be done by to love his Neighbour as himself to honour his Superiors to believe that God scans all his Actions and will reward or punish them and to think that he who is guilty of Falshood or Injustice hurts himself more than any one else Are not these such Notions and Principles as every wife Governor or Legislator would covet above all Things to have firmly rooted in the Mind of every Individual under his Care This is allowed even by the Enemies of Religion who would fain have it thought the Offspring of State Policy honouring its Usefulness at the same Time that they disparage its Truth What therefore cannot be acquired by every Man's Reasoning must be introduced by Precept and riveted by Custom that is to say the  Bulk of Mankind must in all civilized Societies have their Minds by timely Instruction well seasoned and furnished with proper Notions which although the Grounds or Proofs thereof be unknown to them will nevertheless influence their Conduct and so far render them useful Members of the State But if you strip Men of these their Notions or if you will Prejudices with regard to Modesty Decency Justice Charity and the like you will soon find them so many Monsters utterly unfit for human Society  I desire it may be considered that most Men want Leisure Opportunity or Faculties to derive Conclusions from their Principles and establish Morality on a Foundation of human Science True it is as St  Paul  observes that  The invisible Things of God from the Creation of the World are clearly seen  ROM Ch i Ver  And from thence the Duties of natural Religion may be discovered But these Things are seen and discovered by those alone who open their Eyes and look narrowly for them Now if you look throughout the World you shall find but few of these narrow Inspectors and Inquirers very few who make it their Business to analyse Opinions and pursue them to their rational Source to examine whence Truths spring and how they are inferred In short you shall find all Men full of Opinions but Knowledge only in a few  It is impossible from the Nature and Circumstances of human Kind that the Multitude should be Philosophers or that they should know Things in their Causes We see every Day that the Rules or Conclusions alone are sufficient for the Shopkeeper to state his Account the Sailor to navigate his Ship or the Carpenter to measure his Timber  none of which understand the Theory that is to say the Grounds and Reasons either of Arithmetic or Geometry Even so in moral political and religious Matters it is manifest that the Rules and Opinions early imbibed at the first Dawn of Understanding and without the least Glimpse of Science may yet produce excellent Effects and be very useful to the World And that in Fact they are so will be very visible to every one who shall observe what passeth round about him  It may not be amiss to inculcate that the Difference between Prejudices and other Opinions doth not consist in this that the former are false and the latter true but in this that the former are taken upon Trust and the latter acquired by Reasoning He who hath been taught to believe the Immortality of the Soul may be as right in his Notion as he who hath reasoned himself into that Opinion It will then by no means follow that because this or that Notion is a Prejudice it must be therefore false The not distinguishing between Prejudices and Errors is a prevailing Oversight among our modern Freethinkers  There may be indeed certain mere Prejudices or Opinions which having no Reasons either assigned or assignable to support them are neverthess entertained by the Mind because they intruded betimes into it Such may be supposed false not because they were early learned or learned without their Reasons but because there are in truth no Reasons to be given for them  Certainly if a Notion may be concluded false because it was early imbibed or because it is with most Men an Object of Belief rather than of Knowledge one may by the same Reasoning conclude several Propositions of  Euclid  to be false A simple Apprehension of Conclusions as taken in  themselves without the Deductions of Science is what falls to the Share of Mankind in general Religious Awe the Precepts of Parents and Masters the Wisdom of Legislators and the accumulated Experience of Ages supply the Place of Proofs and Reasonings with the Vulgar of all Ranks I would say that Discipline national Constitution and Laws human or divine are so many plain Land Marks which guide them into the Paths wherein it is presumed they ought to tread  From what hath been premised it plainly appears that in the Bulk of Mankind there are and must be Prejudices that is Opinions taken upon Trust or in other Words that there are Points of Faith among all Men whatsoever as well as among Christians  And as it is evident that the unthinking Part of every Age Sex and Condition among us must necessarily receive Notions with the Submission of Faith so it is very reasonable that they should submit their Faith to the greatest Authorities human and divine the Law and the Gospel But if once all Reverence for these be destroyed our Pretenders to moral Knowledge will have no Authority to imbue the Multitude with such Notions as may control their Appetites From all which it follows that the modern Schemes of our Freethinkers who pretend to separate Morality from Religion how rational soever they may seem to their Admirers are in Truth and Effect most irrational and pernicious to civil Society  Let any one who thinks at all consider the savage State of undisciplined Men whose Minds are nurtured to no Doctrine broke by no Instruction governed by no Principle Let him at the same Time reflect on a Society of Persons educated in the Principles of our Church formed betimes to  fear God to reverence their Superiors to be grateful to their Benefactors forgiving to their Enemies just and charitable to all Men and he will then be able to judge of the Merits of those who are so active to weed out the Prejudices of Education  Among the many wild Notions broached in these giddy Times it must be owned that some of our Declaimers against Prejudice have wrought themselves into a Sort of Esteem for Savages as a virtuous and unprejudiced People In Proof of which they alledge their being free from many Vices practised in civilized Nations Now it is very true among Savages there are few Instances to be found of Luxury Avarice or Ambition not that the contrary Virtues take place but because the Opportunities and Faculties for such Vices are wanting For the same Reason you do not see them in Brutes  What they esteem and admire in those Creatures is not Innocence but Ignorance it is not Virtue but Necessity Give them but the Means of transgressing and they know no Bounds For Example Supply the Waterdrinking Savage with strong Liquor and he shall be drunk for several Days and Nights together Again we admit an uneducated Savage knows not how to supplant a Rival with the refined Treachery of a Courtier yet if you put his Foe once in his Power you shall soon see what a horrible Relish and Delight the Monster hath in Cruelty  Above all others religious Notions or if you will Prejudices since this as hath been already observed detracts nothing from their Truth and Usefulness have the most Influence they are the strongest Curb from Vice and the most effectual  Spur to worthy Conduct And indeed whether we consider the Reason of Things or the Practice of Men in all Times we shall be satisfied that nothing truly great and good can enter into the Heart of one attached to no Principles of Religion who believes no Providence who neither fears Hell nor hopes for Heaven  Punishments and Rewards have always had and always will have the greatest Weight with Men and the most considerable of both Kinds are proposed by Religion the Duties whereof fall in with the Views of the civil Magistrate it undeniably follows that nothing can add more Strength to a good and righteous Government than Religion Therefore it mainly concerns Governors to keep an attentive Eye on the Religion of their Subjects And indeed it is one Lesson to Magistrate and People Prince and Subject  Keep my Commandments and live and my Law as the Apple of thine Eye  PROV Ch vii Ver  Although it is no Consequence from what hath been said that Men should be debarred the free Use of Reason and Inquiry yet surely it will follow that without good Reason a Man should not reject those Notions which have been instilled by the Laws and Education of his Country And even they who think they have such Reason have nevertheless no Right of dictating  Though a Man's private Judgment be a Rule to himself it will not thence follow that he hath any Right to set up for a Rule to others  to others It is true divine Authority is superior to all human Prejudices Institutions and Regards whatsoever And it is wise although at the Risk of Liberty or Life to obey God rather than Man But our  modern Reformers of Prejudice have nothing to plead  No Man can say he is obliged in Conscience Honour or Prudence to insult the public Wisdom or to ridicule the Laws under whose Protection he lives  of that kind  There is no Magistrate so ignorant as not to know that Power physical Power resides in the People but Authority is from Opinion which Authority is necessary to restrain and direct the People's Power and therefore Religion is the great Stay and Support of a State Every Religion that inculcates Virtue and discourageth Vice is so far of public Benefit The Christian Religion doth noth only this but further makes every legal Constitution sacred by commanding our Submission thereto  Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers  saith St PAUL  for the Powers that be are ordained of God  ROM Ch xiii Ver  And in effect for several Years past while the Reverence for our Church and Religion hath been decaying and wearing off from the Minds of Men it may be observed that Loyalty hath in Proportion lost ground and now the very Word seems quite forgotten Submission for Conscience as well as for Wrath was once reckoned an useful Lesson but now with other good Lessons is laid aside as an obsolete Prejudice  That Prince or Magistrate however great or powerful who thinks his own Authority sufficient to make him respected and obeyed lies under a woful Mistake and never fails to feel it sooner or later Obedience to all civil Power is rooted in the religious Fear of God it is propagated preserved and nourished by Religion This makes Men obey not with EyeService but in Sincerity of Heart Human Regards may restrain Men  from open and penal Offences but the Fear of God is a Restraint from all Degrees of all Crimes however circumstanced Take away this Stay and Prop of Duty this Root of civil Authority and all that was sustained by it or grew from it shall soon languish The Authority the very Being of the Magistrate will prove a poor and precarious Thing  An inward Sense of the supreme Majesty of the King of Kings is the only Thing that can beget and preserve a true Respect for subordinate Majesty in all the Degrees of Power the first Link of Authority being fixed at the Throne of God But in these our Days that  Majestas imperii  that Sacredness of Character which rooted in a religious Principle was the great Guard and Security of the State is through Want thereof become the public Scorn And indeed what Hold can the Prince or Magistrate have on the Conscience of those who have no Conscience How can he build on the Principles of such as have no Principles Or how can he hope for Respect where God himself is neglected  It is manifest that no Prince upon Earth can hope to govern well or even to live easy and secure much less respected by his People if he do not contribute by his Example and Authority to keep up in their Minds an awful Sense of Religion As for a moral Sense and moral Fitness or eternal Relations how insufficient those Things are for establishing general and just Notions of Morality or for keeping Men within due Bounds is so evident from Fact and Experience that I need not now enter into a particular Disquisition about them  See  ALCIPHRON Dial III and IV  It must be owned that the Claws of Rapine and Violence may in some Degree be pared and blunted by the outward Polity of a State But should we not rather try if possible to pull them quite out The evil Effects of Wickedness may be often redressed by public Justice But would it not be better to heal the Source and by an inward Principle extirpate Wickedness from the Heart rather than depend altogether on human Laws for preventing or redressing the bad Effects thereof  'I might said the  Chinese  Doctor  Confucius  hear and decide Controversies as well as another but what I would have is that Men should be brought to abstain from Controversies out of an inward Love and Regard for each other'  Scientia SIN Lib I Fol  Too many in this Age of free Remarks and Projects are delighted with republican Schemes and imagine they might remedy whatever was amiss and render a People great and happy meerly by a new Plan or Form of Government This dangerous Way of Thinking and Talking is grown familiar through the foolish  Men forget that Liberty consists in a Mean or that there is any other Extreme beside Tyranny  Freedom of the Times But alas Those Men do not seem to have touched either the true Cause or Cure of public Evils Be the Plan ever so excellent or the Architects ever so able yet no Man in his Wits would undertake to build a Palace with meer Mud or Dirt There must be fit Materials and without a religious Principle Men can never be fit Materials for any Society much less for a Republic Religion is the Centre which unites and the Cement which connects the several Parts or Members of the political Body Such it hath been held by all wise  Men from the remotest Times down to our ingenious Contemporaries who if they are in the Right it must be admitted that all the rest of the World have been in the Wrong  From the Knowledge of its being absolutely necessary to the Government of a State that the Hearts and Minds of the People be inwardly imbued with good Principles  Plato  In PROTAGORA  tells that  '  Jupiter  to preserve the Race of Men from perishing sent  Mercury  with Orders to introduce Modesty and Justice among them as the firmest Ties of human Society and without which it could not subsist"  And elsewhere the same Author gives it plainly as his Sense that  De legibus Lib VIII  'Concerning those great Duties which Mens Appetites and Passions render difficult it should seem rather the Work of God to provide than of human Legislators if it were possible to hope for a System of Laws framed and promulgated by God himself'  You see how agreeable the  Mosaic  and Christian Institutions are to the Wishes of the wisest Heathen  Moses  indeed doth not insist on a future State the common Basis of all political Institutions Nor do other Lawgivers make a particular mention of all Things necessary but suppose some Things as generally known or believed The Belief of a future State which it is manifest the  Jews  were possessed of long before the Coming of CHRIST seems to have obtained among the  Hebrews  from primaeval Tradition which might render it unnecessary for  Moses  to insist on that Article But the  Sadducee  and  Epicureans  had in Progress of Time gone so far towards rooting out this ancient and origina  Sentiment that it was in Danger of being lost had it not been taught and promulgated in a new Light by our blessed SAVIOUR  But many among us who would pass for Assertors of Truth and Liberty are accustomed to rail at this and all other established Opinions as Prejudices which People are taught whether they will or no and before they are able to distinguish whether they are right or wrong These Lovers of Truth would do well to consider that in political moral and religious Matters the Opinions of the Vulgar whether they go in Coaches or walk on Foot are for the most part Prejudices and are so like to be whatever Side of the Question they embrace whether they follow the old Maxims of the Religion of their Country or the modern Instructions of their new Masters I have already observed that a Point's being useful and inculcated betimes can be no Argument of its Falshood even although it should be a Prejudice far otherwise Unity and Truth are not to be divided the general Good of Mankind being the Rule or Measure of moral Truth  See  ALCIPHRON Dial I Sect  I shall now add that it is to be apprehended many of those who are the most forward to banish Prejudices would be the first to feel the Want of them It is even pitiful to think what would be come of certain moderate Declaimers on that Article were Prejudice really set aside and were all Men to be weighed in the exact Scale of Merit and considered in Proportion only to their intrinsic Worth Some Prejudices are grounded in Truth Reason and Nature Such are the Respects which are paid to Knowledge Learning Age Honesty and Courage in all civilized Countries Others are purely  the Effect of particular Constitutions such are the Respects Rights and Preeminences ascribed to some Men by their FellowSubjects on account of their Birth and Quality which in the great Empires of  Turkey  and  China  pass for nothing and will pass for nothing elsewhere as soon as Men have got rid of their Prejudices and learned to despise the Constitutions of their Country It may behove those who are concerned to reflect on this betimes  GOD comprehending within himself the Beginning End and Middle of all Things and Times exerts his Energy throughout the whole Creation He never ceaseth to influence by Instinct by the Light of Nature by his declared Will And it is the duty of Magistrates and Lawgivers to cultivate and encourage those divine Impressions in the Minds of all Men under their Care We are not to think it is the Work of God and therefore not to be seconded by human Care Far otherwise for that very reason it claims our utmost Care and Diligence it being the indispensible Duty of all good Men throughout the whole Course of their Lives to cooperate with the Designs of Providence In Religion as in Nature God doth somewhat and somewhat is to be done on the Part of Man He causes the Earth to bring forth Materials for Food and Raiment but human Industry must improve prepare and properly apply both the one and the other or Mankind may perish with Cold and Hunger And according to this fame Analogy  It will be sufficient if such Analogy appears between the Dispensations of Grace and Nature as may make it probable to suppose them derived from the same Author  ALCIPHRON Dial VI Sect  the Principles of Piety and Religion the Things that belong to our Salvation although originally and  primarily the Work of God yet require the Protection of human Government as well as the Furtherance and Aid of all wise and good Men  And if Religion in all Governments be necessary yet it seems to be so more especially in Monarchies Forasmuch as the frugal Manners and more equal Fortunes in Republics do not so much inflame Mens Appetites or afford such Power or Temptation to Mischief as the high Estate and great Wealth of Nobles under a King Therefore although the Magistrate as was already observed hath for his peculiar Object the temporal Wellbeing of the State yet this will by no means exempt him from a due Concern for the Religion of his Country  What was the Sense of our Ancestors on this Point appears throughout the whole Constitution of these Kingdoms and in order to justify this Constitution and the Wisdom of those who framed it I shall crave leave to make use of some unsuspected Testimonies ancient and modern which will shew that the public Care of a national Religion hath been always a most principal Point in the Esteem of wise Men however run down by the prevailing Licence of our Times  The first Testimnny I shall produce is that of  Zaleucus  the famous Lawgiver of the  Locrians  who in his Preamble to his Laws  STOBAEUS de leg consuet Ser  begins with Religion laying it down as the Cornerstone or Foundation of his whole Superstructure  'That every Inhabitant Subject of the State should be persuaded that there is a God and divine Providence That the only Way of becoming dear to God is by endeavouring above all Things to be good both in Deed and in Will That a worthy  Citizen is one that prefers Integrity to Wealth'  He further admonishes those who are difficult to persuade  'To bethink themselves of God's Providence and the Punishments that await Evildoers and in all their Actions to be ever mindful of the last Day as if it were present or in case the    Devil should tempt a Man to Sin He exhorts such a one to frequent the Temples and Altars worshipping and imploring the divine Assistance'  Aristotle  De Republ Lib V  discoursing of the Means to preserve a Monarchy admonishes the supreme Magistrate above all things to shew himself zealous in religious Matters and this particularly for two Reasons  ' Because the Subjects will have less to fear from one who fears God Because they will be less apt to rebel against him whom they take to be the Favourite of Heaven'  And elsewhere this same Philosopher recommends the Worship of the Gods as the first Care of the State  Ibid Lib VII Cap Lib VI  Plato  likewise begins his Laws with the Care of religious Rites He even maintains Religion or divine Worship to be the chief Aim and Scope of human Life  De leg Lib IV  Hippodamus  the  Milesian  ARIST de Republ Lib II Cap  in his Scheme of a Republic allotted a third Part of the Land for maintaining divine Worship  The abolishing of the Christian Religion upon a frugal Principle must be bad Policy if we may judge what will be by what hath been in the great  Pagan  States of Antiquity whose Religions upon a fair Estimate will be found to have been more expensive  The  Roman  Historians and Poets do so abound with Passages ascribing the Successes of their Government  to Religion and its Declension to the Want or Neglect thereof that it may seem impertinent to enter into a Detail of what every SchoolBoy knows  To come from ancient to modern Authority  Machiavel  himself represents Religion as absolutely necessary to maintain civil Order and Government He observes that for many Years there was a most awful Sense of Religion in the old  Romans  and that this did much facilitate their great Undertakings He likewise observes and shews by divers Instances that the  Romans  were more afraid to break an Oath than to transgress the Laws and that those Things which even the Love of their Country and Constitution could not bring them to they were brought to through a Sense of Religion Upon the whole he concludes that old  Rome  was more obliged to  Numa  who established a national Religion than to  Romulus  himself the Founder of that State  DISCORSI Lib I Cap  And here by the by I shall take notice that some may imagine the various Forms and Institutions of Religion ought to unsettle Mens Minds with regard to the Truth and Certainty of any But this Matter rightly considered will I think produce a contrary Effect It sheweth indeed that Men groping out their Way by the dim Twilight of Nature did only approach some nearer some farther off while all were short of the Truth But then sheweth likewise upon the whole and in general that Religion is so natural to our Minds so useful to Society and of so necessary Importance to the World as might well prove its Truth and render it worthy of the divine Care to propagate by  Prophecies Miracles and the Mission of the Son of God  Philip de Comines  Hist B  a wise Statesman and honest Writer who had great Experience in Affairs declares it to be his Opinion  'That Want of religious Faith is the only Foundation of all Mischiefs'  And that able Minister the famous Monsieur  Colbert  Test Pol C  makes it his Observation  'That if once the Ecclesiastical Character as such is vilified the civil Magistrate even the Crown itself will in Consequence thereof lose all Authority  It would be no hard Matter to produce a Cloud of Testimonies in behalf of a national Religion from the most eminent of our own Writers but I shall content myself with adding one only and that from a very unsuspected Writer Mr  Harrington  Author of the  Oceana  who shews that to be just and fair which others have shewed to be expedient  '  P First Edit  A Man saith he that pleading for Liberty of Conscience refuseth Liberty to the national Conscience must be most absurd  And again  If the Conviction of a Man's private Conscience produce his private Religion the Conviction of the national Conscience must produce a national Religion  Ibid  '  All these Authorities are taken from thinking Men and able Politicians none of which can be supposed to say what he did not really think and it had been very easy to have increased the Number But I am sorry I was obliged to mention any at all in proof of so plain and fundamental a Point as that of a national Religion It is indeed a  shameful Necessity we lie under of proving at this Time of Day the first Elements I will not say of Christianity but even of natural Light from Reasons and from Authorities The Spirit of the Times hath rendered this unavoidable  If it should be asked after all how comes it then to pass that the fashionable and prevailing Maxims among our Betters in a neighbouring Nation should run directly counter to all such Reasons and Authorities I will answer this Question by asking when were our Neighbours known to abound to that Degree in Highwaymen Murderers Housebreakers Incendiaries When did such Numbers lay violent Hands on themselves When was there such a general and indecent Contempt of whatever is esteemed sacred in the State as well as the Church When were there known among them such public Frauds such open Confederacies in Villany as the present Age hath produced When were they lower in Esteem of Mankind more divided at home or more insulted abroad  We of this Land have a fatal Tendency to overlook the good Qualities and imitate whatever is amiss in those whom we respect This leads me to make some Remarks on the modern Spirit of Reformation that works so strongly in both these Kingdoms  Freedom of Thought is the general Plea and Cry of the Age and we all grant that thinking is the Way to know and the more real Knowledge there is in the Land the more likely it will be to thrive We are not therefore against Freedom of Thought but we are against those unthinking overbearing People  It is not Reason candidly proposed that offends but the Reviling Insulting Ridiculing of the national Laws and Religion all this profiteth for Freethinking and must needs be offensive to all reasonable Men  who in these odd Times under that Pretence  set up for Reformers and new Molders of the Constitution We declare against those who would seduce ignorant and unexperinced Persons from the Reverence they owe to the Laws and Religion of their Country and under the Notion of extirpating Prejudices would erase from their Minds all Impressions of Piety and Virtue in order to introduce Prejudices of another Kind destructive of Society  We esteem it a horrible Thing to laugh at the Apprehensions of a future State with the Author of the  Charasterictics  Vol III Miscel III C  or with him who wrote the  Fable of the Bees  to maintain that  moral Virtues are the political Offspring which Flattery begot upon Pride  Inquiry into the Origin of moral Virtue Ed p  that  in Morals there is no greater Certainty than in Fashions of Dress  The Author's Remarks on his Fable of the Bees p    that  indeed  the Doctrine of good Manners teacheth Men to speak well of all Virtues but requires no more of them in any Age or Country than the outward Appearance of those in Fashion  Remarks Part II p  Two Authors of Infidel Systems these who setting out upon opposite Principles are calculated to draw all Mankind by flattering either their Vanity or their Passions into one or other System And yet the People among whom such Books are published wonder how it comes to pass that the civil Magistrate daily loseth his Authority that the Laws are trampled upon and the Subject in constant Fear of being robbed or murdered or having his House burnt over his Head  It may be presumed that the Science of finding Fault which above all others is easiest to learn suits best with a modern Education Too many there are of better Fortunes than Understandings who have made the Inquiry after Truth a very small Part of their Care These see somewhat but not enough It were to be wished they knew either less or more One Thing it is evident they do not know to wit that while they rail at Prejudice they are undoing themselves They do not comprehend what hath been before hinted that their whole Figure their political Existence is owing to certain vulgar Prejudices in Favour of Birth Title or Fortune which add nothing of real Worth either to Mind or Body and yet cause the most worthless Person to be respected  Feedom of Thought is the Prerogative of human Kind it is a Quality inherent in the very Nature of a thinking Being Nothing is more evident than that every one can think his own Way in spite of any outward Force or Power whatsoever It is therefore ridiculous for any Man to declaim in Defence of a Privilege which cannot be denied or taken from him But this will not infer a boundless Freedom of Speech  Is there no Difference between indulging scrupulous Consciences and tolerating public Deriders of all Conscience and Religion  an open Contempt of Laws and a prescribing from private Judgment  A Man who is himself permitted to follow his own private Judgment cannot well complain although he may not set it up as a public Rule  against public Authority Things never borne in any wellordered State and which make the crying Distemper of our Times  The Constitution of these Kingdoms hath been one while overheated by the indiscreet Zeal of one Set of Men Again it hath been cold and lifeless  through the Indifference of another  There is a Medium in Things which wise Men find out while the unwise are always blundering in Extremes  We have alternately felt the furious Effects of Superstition and Fanaticism and our present impending Danger is from the setting up of private Judgment or an inward Light in Opposition to human and divine Laws Such an inward conceited Principle always at work and proceeding gradually and steadily may be sufficient to dissolve any human Fabric of Polity or civil Government To pretend to be wiser than the Laws hath never been suffered in any wise State saith  Aristotle  Rhet Lib I Cap  And indeed what wise State would encourage or endure a Spirit of Opposition  Reason modestly pleading from a conscientious Principle hath nothing cruel to apprehend from our Laws and I hope it never will At the same time it must be allowed that every Plea against Law ought to be very meek and modest  publicly to operate against its own Decrees who can say to such a Spirit  Thus far shalt thou come and no farther  The Magistrate perhaps may not be sufficiently aware that those pretended Advocates for private Light and free Thought are in reality seditious Men who set up themselves against national Laws and Constitutions And yet one would think all Mankind might see that the Spirit which prevails against the Church and Religion proceeds from an Opposition rather to the Laws of the Land than to the Gospel Men quarrel not so vehemently against Articles of Faith themselves as against the establishing of such Matters which is the sole Effect of Law and the supreme Power It clearly follows the Freedom pleaded for is not so much Freedom of Thought against the Doctrines of the Gospel as Freedom of Speech and Action against  the Laws of the Land It is strange that those who are not blind in other Matters should yet not see this or that seeing it they should not discern the Consequences thereof  I am sensible that whatever looks like a Restraint on Freedom of Inquiry must be very disagreeable to all reasoning and inquisitive Men But against this I have said nothing  The profane and lawless Scorner is one Thing and the modest Inquirer after Truth another  On the contrary I will freely own a judicious and impartial Search after Truth is the most valuable Employment of the Mind Those who have the Talents and will be at the Pains cannot do better than engage in that noble Pursuit But those who are not qualified by Age or Education those who have neither Disposition nor Leisure nor Faculties to dig in the Mine of Truth themselves must take it as retailed out by others I see no Remedy GOD who knows the Opportunities of every Man requires Impossibilities from no Man And where there is a sincere Love of Truth and Virtue the Grace of GOD can easily supply the Defect of human Means  It hath been before observed and shewed at large that the Bulk of Mankind must have their Minds betimes imbued with good and wholsom Notions or Principles by their Parents Pastors and Tutors or else bad Notions hurtful to themselves and others will undoubtedly take possession thereof Such bad Notions have for several Years past been propagated with uncommon Industry in these Kingdoms They now bring forth Fruit every Day more and more abundant It is to be feared that what hath been long ripening is now near ripe Many are the Signs and Tokens He that runs may read  But there cannot be a higher or more flagrant Symptom of the Madness of our Times than that execrable Fraternity of Blasphemers lately set up within this City of  Dublin  Blasphemy against GOD is a great Crime against the State But that a Set of Men should in open Contempt of the Laws make this very Crime their Profession distinguish themselves by a peculiar Name  Blasters  and form a distinct Society whereof the proper and avowed Business shall be to shock all serious Christians by the most impious and horrid Blasphemies uttered in the most public Manner This surely must alarm all thinking Men It is a new Thing under the Sun reserved for our worthy Times and Country  It is no common Blasphemy I speak of It is not simple Cursing and Swearing It is not the Effect either of Habit or Surprise but a Train of studied deliberate Indignities against the divine Majesty and those of so black and hellish a Kind as the Tongues alone which uttered them can duly characterize and express This is no speculative Heresy no remote or doubtful Inference from an Author's Tenets It is a direct and open Attack on GOD himself It is such a calm premeditated Insult upon Religion Law and the very Light of Nature that there is no Sect or Nation of Men whether Christians Jews Mahometans or even civilized Heathens that would not be struck with Horror and Amazement at the Thought of it and that would not animadvert  They if there be any such who think to serve the Reformation by joining with Blasters and Devilworshippers in a Plea for Licence are in truth a Scandal and Reproach to the Protestant Cause  on its Authors with the utmost Severity  Deliberate atheistical Blasphemy is of all Crimes most dangerous to the Public inasmuch as it opens the Door to all other Crimes and virtually contains them all A religious Awe and Fear of GOD being as we have already observed the Centre that unites and the Cement that connects all human Society He who makes it his Business to lessen or root out from the Minds of Men this Principle doth in effect endeavour to fill his Country with Highwaymen Housebreakers Murderers fraudulent Dealers perjured Witnesses and every other Pest of Society Therefore it would be the greatest Cruelty to our Children Neighbours and Country to connive at such a Crime a Crime which hath no natural Passion or Temptation to plead for it but is the pure Effect of an abandoned Impudence in Wickedness and perhaps of a mistaken Hope that the Laws and Magistrates are asleep  The Question is not now whether Religion shall be established by Law The Thing is already done and done with good Reason as appeareth from the Premises but whether a Reverence  They who plead a Right to contradict the Laws can pretend none for doing it with Insolence or Disrespect  for the Laws shall be preserved Religion considered as a System of saving Truths hath its Sanction from Heaven its Rewards and Penalties are divine But Religion as useful and necessary to Society hath been wisely established by Law and so established and wrought into the very Frame and Principles of our Government is become a main Part of the civil Constitution Our Laws are the Laws of a Christian Country Our Government hath been constituted and modelled by Christians and is still administered and maintained by Men professing Belief in CHRIST Can it then be supposed that impious  Men shall with Impunity invent and  To make the Cause of such Men the Cause of Liberty or Toleration would be monstrous A Man is not suffered publicly to blaspheme therefore he may not think freely A profane Miscreant is not indulged in the public Worship of the Devil therefore a conscientious Person may not serve God his own Way Is not this absurd  publicly utter the most horrid Blasphemies and at the same Time the whole Constitution not be endangered Or can it be supposed that Magistrates or Men invested with Power should look on and see the most sacred Part of our Constitution trampled under foot and yet imagine their own Dignity and Authority to be secure which rest intirely thereupon I will venture to say that whoever is a wise Man and a Lover of his Country will not only be solicitous to preserve the Honour of GOD sacred and intire he will even discourage that prevailing Prejudice against the Dispensers of GOD'S Word the Teachers of those salutary Doctrines without which the Public cannot thrive or subsist He will be no Contemner not even of those Rites and Ordinances enjoined by Law as necessary to imprint and retain a Sense of Religion in the Minds of Men He will extend his Care to the Outworks as knowing that when these are gone it may be difficult to preserve the rest  Notwithstanding the vain Assertion of those Men who would justify the present by saying  All Times are alike  it is most evident that the Magistrates the Laws the very Constitution of these Realms have lost no small Share of their Authority and Reverence since this great growth and spreading of impious Principles Whatever be the Cause the Effect is apparent Whether we ascribe it to the natural Course of Things or to a just Judgment upon those who having been careless  to preserve a due Sense of the divine Authority have seen and shall see their own despised  Darius  a Heathen Prince made a Decree that in every Dominion of his Kingdom Men should tremble and fear before GOD  DAN Ch VI Ver  Nebuchadnezzar  likewise another Heathen made a Decree that every People Nation and Language which spoke any Thing amiss against GOD should be cut in Pieces and their Houses made a Dunghill  DAN Ch III Ver  And if these Things were done in  Persia  and  Babylon  surely it may be expected that impious Blasphemers against GOD and his Worship should at least be discouraged and put out of Countenance in these Christian Countries Now a constant Course of Disfavour from Men in Authority would prove a most effectual Check to all such Miscreants When therefore they are public and bold in their Blasphemies this is no small Reflexion on those who might check them if they would  It is not so much the Execution of the Laws as the Countenance of those in Authority that is wanting to the Maintenance of Religion If Men of Rank and Power who have a Share in distributing Justice and a Voice in the public Councils shall be observed to neglect divine Worship themselves it must needs be a great Temptation for others to do the same But if they and their Families should set a good Example it may be presumed that Men of less Figure would be disposed to follow it Fashions are always observed to descend and People are generally fond of being in the Fashion Whence one would be apt to suspect the prevailing Contempt of GOD'S Word and Estrangement from his House to a Degree that  was never known in any Christian Country must take its Rise from the Irreligion and bad Example of those who are stiled  the better Sort  Offences must come but Woe be to him by whom the Offence cometh A Man who is intrusted with Power and Influence in his Country hath much to answer for if Religion and Virtue suffer through Want of his Authority and Countenance But in Case he should by the Vanity of his Discourse his Favour to wicked Men or his own apparent Neglect of all religious Duties countenance what he ought to condemn and authorize by his own Example what he ought to punish such a one whatever he may pretend is in Fact a bad Patriot a bad Citizen and a bad Subject as well as a bad Christian  Our Prospect is very terrible and the Symptoms grow stronger every Day The Morals of a People are in this like their Fortunes when they feel a national Shock the worst doth not shew itself immediately Things make a Shift to subsist for a Time on the Credit of old Notions and dying Opinions But the Youth born and brought up in wicked Times without any Bias to Good from early Principle or instilled Opinion when they grow ripe must be Monsters indeed And it is to be feared that Age of Monsters is not far off  Whence this Impietysprings by what means it gains ground among us and how it may be remedied are Matters that deserve the Attention of all those who have the Power and the Will to serve their Country And although many Things look like a Prelude to some general Ruin although it is much to be apprehended we shall be worse before we are better yet who knows what may ensue if all Persons in Power from the supreme Executor of the Law down to a petty Constable  would in their several Stations behave themselves like Men truly conscious and mindful that the Authority they are clothed with is but a derivative Ray from the supreme Authority of Heaven This may not a little contribute to stem that Torrent which from small Beginnings and under specious Pretences hath grown to such a Head and daily gathers Force more and more to that Degree as threatens a general Inundation and Destruction of these Realms  A Word to the Wise OR AN EXHORTATION TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC Clergy OF  IRELAND  Homo sum humani nihil à me alienum puto  First Printed in the YEAR MDCCXLIX  A Word to the Wise  BE not startled  Reverend Sirs  to find yourselves addressed to by one of a different Communion We are indeed to our Shame be it spoken more inclined to hate for those Articles wherein we differ than to love one another for those wherein we agree But if we cannot extinguish let us at least suspend our Animosities and forgetting our religious Feuds consider ourselves in the amiable Light of Countrymen and Neighbours Let us for once turn our Eyes on those Things in which we have one common Interest Why should Disputes about Faith interrupt the Duties of civil Life or the different Roads we take to Heaven prevent our taking the same Steps on Earth Do we not inhabit the same Spot of Ground breathe the same Air and live under the same Government why then should we not conspire in one and the same Design to promote the common Good of our Country  We are all agreed about the Usefulness of Meat Drink and Clothes and without Doubt we all sincerely wish our poor Neighbours were better supplied with them Providence and Nature have  done their Part no Country is better qualified to furnish the Necessaries of Life and yet no People are worse provided In vain is the Earth fertile and the Climate benign if human Labour be wanting Nature supplies the Materials which Art and Industry improve to the Use of Man and it is the Want of this Industry that occasions all our other Wants  The Public hath endeavoured to excite and encourage this useful Virtue Much hath been done but whether it be from the Heaviness of the Climate or from the  Spanish  or  Scythian  Blood that runs in their Veins or whatever else may be the Cause there still remains in the Natives of this Island a remarkable Antipathy to Labour You  Gentlemen  can alone conquer their innate hereditary Sloth Do you then as you love your Country exert yourselves  You are known to have great Influence on the Minds of your People be so good as to use this Influence for their Benefit Since other Methods fail try what  you  can do  Be instant in Season out of Season reprove rebuke exhort  Tim ch iv ver  Make them thoroughly sensible of the Sin and Folly of Sloth Shew your Charity in clothing the naked and feeding the hungry which you may do by the mere Breath of your Mouths Give me leave to tell you that no Set of Men upon Earth have it in their Power to do Good on easier Terms with more Advantage to others and less Pains or Loss to themselves Your Flocks are of all others most disposed to follow Directions and of all others want them most and indeed what do they not want  The House of an  Irish Peasant  is the Cave of Poverty within you see a Pot and a little Straw  without a Heap of Children tumbling on the Dunghill Their Fields and Gardens are a lively Counterpart of  Solomon  's Description in the Proverbs  I went  saith that wise King  by the Field of the slothful and by the Vineyard of the Man void of Understanding and lo it was all grown over with Thorns and Nettles had covered the Face thereof and the Stone Wall thereof was broken down  Prov ch xxiv ver  In every Road the ragged Ensigns of Poverty are displayed you often meet Caravans of Poor whole Families in a Drove without Clothes to cover or Bread to feed them both which might be easily procured by moderate Labour They are encouraged in this vagabond Life by the miserable Hospitality they meet with in every Cottage whose Inhabitants expect the same kind Reception in their Turn when they become Beggars themselves Beggary being the last Refuge of these improvident Creatures  If I seem to go out of my Province or to prescribe to those who must be supposed to know their own Business or to paint the lower Inhabitants of this Land in no very pleasing Colours you will candidly forgive a well meant Zeal which obligeth me to say Things rather useful than agreeable and to lay open the Sore in order to heal it  But whatever is said must be so taken as not to reflect on Persons of Rank and Education who are no way inferior to their Neighbours nor yet to include all even of the lowest Sort though it may well extend to the Generality of those especially in the  Western  and  Southern  Parts of the Kingdom where the  British  Manners have less prevailed We take our Notions from what we see mine are a faithful Transcript from Originals about me  The  Scythians  were noted for Wandering and the  Spaniards  for Sloth and Pride our  Irish  are behind neither of these Nations from which they descend in their respective Characteristics  Better is he that laboureth and aboundeth in all Things than he that boasteth himself and wanteth Bread  saith the Son of  Sirach  Ch x Ver  but so saith not the  Irishman  In my own Family a Kitchenwench refused to carry out Cinders because she was descended from an old  Irish Stock  Never was there a more monstrous Conjunction than that of Pride with Beggary and yet this Prodigy is seen every Day in almost every Part of this Kingdom At the same time these proud People are more destitute than  Savages  and more abject than  Negroes  The  Negroes  in our Plantations have a Saying  If Negro was not Negro Irishman would be Negro  And it may be affirmed with truth that the very  Savages  of  America  are better clad and better lodged than the  Irish Cottagers  throughout the fine fertile Counties of  Limerick  and  Tipperary  Having long observed and bewailed this wretched State of my Countrymen and the Insufficiency of several Methods set on foot to reclaim them I have recourse to  your Reverences  as the  dernier Resort  Make them to understand that you have their Interest at heart that you persuade them to work for their own Sakes and that GOD hath ordered Matters so as that they who will not work for themselves must work for others The Terrors of Debt Slavery and Famine should one would think drive the most slothful to Labour Make them sensible of these Things and that the Ends of Providence and Order of the World require Industry in human Creatures  Man goeth forth to  his Work and to his Labour until the Evening  saith the  Psalmist  when he is describing the Beauty Order and Perfection of the Works of GOD  Psal civ ver  But what saith the slothful Person  Yet a little Sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the Hands to sleep  Prov ch vi ver  But what saith the  Wiseman so shall thy Poverty come as one that travelleth and thy Want as an armed Man  Prov ch vi ver    All Nature will furnish you with Arguments and Examples against Sloth  Go to the Ant thou Sluggard  cries  Solomon  The Ant the Bee the Beetle and every Insect but the Drone reads a Lesson of Industry to Man But the shortest and most effectual Lesson is that of  Saint Paul If any Man will not work neither should he eat  Thess ch iii ver  This Command was injoined the  Thessalonians  and equally respects all  Christians  and indeed all  Mankind  it being evident by the Light of Nature that the whole Creation works together for Good and that no Part was designed to be useless as therefore the  Idle Man  is of no use it follows that he hath no Right to a Subsistence  Let them work  saith the  Apostle and eat their own Bread  Thess ch iii ver  not Bread got by Begging not Bread earn'd by the Sweat of other Men but their own Bread that which is got by their own Labour  Then shalt thou eat the Labour of thine Hands  saith the  Psalmist  to which he adds  Happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee  Psal cxxxviii ver  intimating that to work and enjoy the Fruits thereof is a great Blessing  A slothful Man's Imagination is apt to dress up Labour in a horrible Mask but horrible as it is Idleness is more to be dreaded and a Life of  Poverty its necessary Consequence is far more painful It was the Advice of  Pythagoras To choose the best kind of Life  for that Use would render it agreeable reconciling Men even to the roughest Exercise By Practice Pains become at first easy and in the Progress pleasant and this is so true that whoever examines Things will find there can be no such Thing as a happy Life without Labour and that whoever doth not labour with his Hands must in his own Defence labour with his Brains  Certainly planting and tilling the Earth is an Exercise not less pleasing than useful it takes the Peasant from his smoky Cabin into the fresh Air and the open Field rendering his Lot far more desirable than that of the Sluggard who lies in the Straw or sits whole Days by the Fire  Convince your People that not only Pleasure invites but Necessity also drives them to labour If you have any Compassion for these poor Creatures put them in mind how many of them perished in a late memorable Distress through want of that provident Care against a hard Season observable not only in all other Men but even in irrational Animals Set before their Eyes in lively Colours their own indigent and sordid Lives compared with those of other People whose Industry hath procured them hearty Food warm Clothes and decent Dwellings Make them sensible what a Reproach it is that a Nation which makes so great Pretensions to Antiquity and is said to have flourished many Ages ago in Arts and Learning should in these our Days turn out a lazy destitute and degenerate Race  Raise your Voices  Reverend Sirs  exert your Influence shew your Authority over the Multitude by engaging them to the Practice of an honest Industry a Duty necessary to all and required in all  whether  Protestants  or  Roman Catholics  whether  Christians Jews  or  Pagans  Be so good among other Points to find room for  This  than which none is of more Concern to the Souls and Bodies of your Hearers nor consequently deserves to be more amply or frequently insisted on  Many and obvious are the Motives that recommend this Duty Upon a Subject so copious you can never be at a loss for something to say And while by these Means you rescue your Countrymen from Want and Misery you will have the Satisfaction to behold your Country itself improved What Pleasure must it give you to see these waste and wild Scenes these naked Ditches and miserable Hovels exchanged for fine Plantations rich Meadows welltilled Fields and neat Dwellings to see People well fed and well clad instead of famished ragged Scarecrows and those very Persons tilling the Fields that used to beg in the Streets  Neither ought the Difficulty of the Enterprise to frighten you from attempting it It must be confessed a Habit of Industry is not at once introduced Neighbour nevertheless will emulate Neighbour and the Contagion of good Example will spread as surely as of bad though perhaps not so speedily It may be hoped there are many that would be allured by a plentiful and decent Manner of Life to take Pains especially when they observe it to be attained by the Industry of their Neighbours in no Sort better qualified than themselves  If the same gentle Spirit of Sloth did not sooth our Squires as well as Peasants one would imagine there should be no idle Hands among us Alas how many Incentives to Industry offer themselves in this Island crying aloud to the Inhabitants for Work Roads to be repaired Rivers made navigable Fisheries on the Coasts Mines to be wrought  Plantations to be raised Manufactures improved and above all Lands to be tilled and sowed with all Sorts of Grain  When so many Circumstances provoke and animate your People to Labour when their private Wants and the Necessities of the Public when the Laws the Magistrates and the very Country calls upon them you cannot think it becomes you alone to be silent or hindmost in every Project for promoting the public Good Why should you whose Influence is greatest be least active why should you whose Words are most likely to prevail say least in the common Cause  Perhaps it will be said the Discouragements attending those of your Communion are a Bar against all Endeavours for exciting them to a laudable Industry Men are stirred up to labour by the Prospect of bettering their Fortunes by getting Estates or Employments but those who are limited in the Purchase of Estates and excluded from all civil Employments are deprived of those Spurs to Industry  To this it may be answered that admitting these Considerations do in some measure damp Industry and Ambition in Persons of a certain Rank yet they can be no Let to the Industry of poor People or supply an Argument against endeavouring to procure Meat Drink and Clothes It is not proposed that you sould persuade the better Sort to acquire Estates or qualify themselves for becoming Magistrates but only that you should set the lowest of the People at Work to provide themselves with Necessaries and supply the Wants of Nature  It will be alledged in Excuse of their Idleness that the Country People want Encouragement to labour as not having a Property in the Lands There is small Encouragement say you for them  to build or plant upon another's Land wherein they have only a temporary Interest To which I answer that Life itself is but temporary that all Tenures are not of the same Kind that the Case of our  English  and the original  Irish  is equal in this Respect and that the true  Aborigines  or natural  Irish  are noted for Want of Industry in improving even on their own Lands whereof they have both Possession and Property  How many industrious Persons are there in all civilized Countries without any Property in Lands or any Prospect of Estates or Employments Industry never fails to reward her Votaries There is no one but can earn a little and little added to little makes a Heap In this fertile and plentiful Island none can perish for Want but the Idle and Improvident None who have Industry Frugality and Foresight but may get into tolerable if not wealthy Circumstances Are not all Trades and Manufactures open to those of your Communion have you not the same free Use and may you not make the same Advantage of Fairs and Markets as other Men do you pay higher Duties or are you liable to greater Impositions than your fellow Subjects and are not the public Praemiums and Encouragements given indifferently to Artists of all Communions have not in Fact those of your Communion a very great Share of the Commerce of this Kingdom in their Hands and is not more to be got by this than by purchasing Estates or possessing civil Employments whose Incomes are often attended with large Expences  A tight House warm Apparel and wholsom Food are sufficient Motives to labour If all had them we should be a flourishing Nation And if those who take pains may have them those who will not take pains are not to be pitied they are to  be looked on and treated as Drones the Pest and Disgrace of Society  It will be said the Hardness of the Landlord cramps the Industry of the Tenant But if Rent be high and the Landlord rigorous there is more need of Industry in the Tenant It is well known that in  Holland  Taxes are much higher and Rent both of Land and Houses far dearer than in  Ireland  But this is no Objection or Impediment to the Industry of the People who are rather animated and spurred on to earn a Livelihood by Labour that is not to be got without it  You will say it is an easy Matter to make a plausible Discourle on Industry and its Advantages but what can be expected from poor Creatures who are destitute of all Conveniencies for exerting their Industry who have nothing to improve upon nothing to begin the World with I answer they have their four Quarters and five Senses Is it nothing to possess the bodily Organs found and entire That wonderful Machine the Hand was it formed to be idle  Was there but Will to work there are not wanting in this Island either Opportunities or Encouragements Spinning alone might employ all idle Hands Children as well as Parents being soon learned easily performed and never failing of a Market requiring neither Wit nor Strength but suited to all Ages and Capacities The Public provides Utensils and Persons for teaching the Use of them but the Public cannot provide a Heart and Will to be industrious These I will not deny may be found in several Persons in some other Parts of the Kingdom and whereever they are found the comfortable Effects shew themselves But seldom very seldom are they found in these  Southern  Peeple whose Indolence figureth a Lion  in the Way and is Proof against all Encouargement  But you will insist how can a poor Man whose daily Labour goes for the Payment of his Rent be able to provide present Necessaries for his Family much less to lay up a Store for the future It must be owned a considerable Share of the poor Man's Time and Labour goes towards paying his Rent But how are his Wife and Children employed or how doth he employ himself the rest of his Time The same Work tires but different Works relieve Where there is a true Spirit of Industry there will never be wanting something to do without Doors or within by Candlelight if not by Daylight  Labor ipse Voluptas  saith the Poet and this is verified in Fact  In  England  when the Labour of the Field is over it is usual for Men to betake themselves to some other Labour of a different kind In the  Northern  Parts of that industrious Land the Inhabitants meet a jolly Crew at one another's Houses where they merrily and frugally pass the long and dark Winter Evenings several Families by the same Light and the same Fire working at their different Manufactures of Wooll Flax or Hemp Company mean while mutually cheering and provoking to labour In certain other  e g  NewportPagnel  in  Buckinghamshire  Parts you may see on a Summer's Evening the common Labourers sitting along the Street of a Town or Village each at his own Door with a Cushion before him making Bonelace and earning more in an Evening's Pastime than an  Irish Family  would in a whole Day Those People instead of closing the Day with a Game on greasy Cards or lying stretched before the Fire pass their Time much more chearfully  in some useful Employment which Custom hath rendered light and agreeable  But admitting for the various Reasons above alledged that it is impossible for our Cottagers to be rich yet it is certain they may be clean Now bring them to be cleanly and your Work is half done A little Washing scrubbing and rubbing bestowed on their Persons and Houses would introduce a sort of Industry and Industry in any one kind is apt to beget it in another  Indolence in Dirt is a terrible Symptom which shews itself in our lower  lrish  more perhaps than in any People on this Side  The Cape of Good Hope  I will venture to add that look throughout the Kingdom and you shall not find a clean House inhabited by clean People and yet wanting Necessaries the same Spirit of Industry that keeps Folk clean being sufficient to keep them also in Food and Raiment  But alas our poor  Irish  are wedded to Dirt upon Principle It is with some them a Maxim that the Way to make Children thrive is to keep them dirty And I do verily believe that the Familiarity with Dirt contracted and nourished from their Infancy is one great Cause of that Sloth which attends them in every Stage of Life Were Children but brought up in an Abhorrence of Dirt and obliged to keep themselves clean they would have something to do whereas now they do nothing  It is past all doubt that those who are educated in a supine Neglect of all Things either profitable or decent must needs contract a Sleepiness and Indolence which doth necessarily lead to Poverty and every other Distress that attends it  Love not Sleep  cries  Solomon lest thou come to Poverty open  thine Eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with Bread  Prov ch xx ver  It is therefore greatly to be wished that you would persuade Parents to inure their Children betimes to a Habit of Industry as the surest Way to shun the Miseries that must otherwise befal them  An early Habit whether of Sloth or Diligence will not fail to shew itself throughout the whole Course of a Man's Life  Train up a Child  saith the  Wiseman in the Way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it  Prov ch xxii ver  The first Tincture often leaves so deep a Stain as no Afterthought or Endeavour can wash out Hence Sloth in some Minds is Proof against all Arguments and Examples whatsoever all Motives of Interest and Duty all Impressions even of Cold and Hunger This Habit rooted in the Child grows up and adheres to the Man producing a general Listlessness and Aversion from Labour This I take to be our great Calamity  For admitting that some of our Squires and Landlords are Vultures with Iron Bowels and that their Hardness and Severity is a great Discouragement to the Tenant who will naturally prefer Want and Ease before Want and Toil it must at the same time be admitted that neither is the Landlord generally speaking so hard nor the Climate so severe nor the Soil so ungrateful as not to answer the Husbandman's Labour where there is a Spirit of Industry the Want of which is the true Cause of our national Distress Of this there are many evident Proofs  I have myself known a Man from the lowest Condition of Life without Friends or Education not knowing so much as to write or read bred to no Trade or Calling by pure Dint of Daylabour  Frugality and Foresight to have grown wealthy even in this Island and under all the abovementioned Disadvantages And what is done by one is possible to another  In  Holland  a Child five Years old is maintained by its own Labour In  Ireland  many Children of twice that Age do nothing but steal or incumber the Hearth and Dunghill This shameful Neglect of Education shews itself through the whole Course of their Lives in a matchless Sloth bred in the very Bone and not to be accounted for by any outward Hardship or Discouragement whatever It is the native Colour if we may so speak and Complexion of the People  Dutch English French  or  Flemish  cannot match them  Mark an  Irishman  at Work in the Field if a Coach or Horseman go by he is sure to suspend his Labour and stand staring until they are out of Sight A Neighbour of mine made it his Remark in a Journey from  London  to  Bristol  that all the Labourers of whom he enquired the Road constantly answered without looking up or interrupting their Work except one who stood staring and leaning on his Spade and him he found to be an  Irishman  It is a shameful Thing and peculiar to this Nation to see lusty Vagabonds strolling about the Country and begging without any Pretence to beg Ask them why they do not labour to earn their own Livelihood they will tell you They want Employment offer to employ them and they shall refuse your Offer or if you get them to work one Day you may be sure not to see them the next I have known them tdecline even the lighrest Labour that of Haymaking having at the same time neither Clothes for their Backs nor Food for their Bellies  A sore Leg is an Estate to such a Fellow and this may be easily got and continued with small Trouble Such is their Laziness that rather than work they will cherish a Distemper This I know to be true having seen more than one Instance wherein the second Nature so far prevailed over the first that Sloth was preferred to Health To these Beggars who make much of their Sores and prolong their Diseases you cannot do a more thankless Office than cure them except it be to shave their Beards which conciliate a sort of Reverence to that Order of Men  It is indeed a difficult Task to reclaim such Fellows from their slothful and brutal Manner of Life to which they seem wedded with an Attachment that no temporal Motives can conquer nor is there humanly speaking any Hopes they will mend except their Respect for your Lessons and Fear of something beyond the Grave be able to work a Change in them  Certainly if I may advise you should in Return for the Lenity and Indulgence of the Government endeavour to make yourselves useful to the Public and this will best be performed by rousing your poor Countrymen from their beloved Sloth I shall not now dispute the Truth or Importance of other Points but will venture to say that you may still find Time to inculcate this Doctrine of an  honest Industry  and that this would by no means be Time thrown away if promoting your Country's Interest and rescuing so many unhappy Wretches of your Communion from Beggary or the Gallows be thought worth your Pains  It should seem you cannot in your Sermons do better than inveigh against Idleness that extensive Parent of many Miseries and many Sins Idleness the Mother of Hunger and Sister of Theft  Idleness  which  the  Son  of  Sirach  assures us  teacheth many Vices  The same Doctrine is often preached from the Gallows And indeed the Poverty Nakedness and Famine which Idleness entaileth on her Votaries do make Men so wretched that they may well think it better to die than to live such Lives Hence a Courage for all villanous Undertakings which bringing Men to a shameful Death do then open their Eyes when they are going to be closed for ever  If you have any Regard as it is not to be doubted either for the Souls or Bodies of your People or even for your own Interest and Credit you cannot fail to inveigh against this crying Sin of your Country Seeing you are obnoxious to the Laws should you not in Prudence try to reconcile yourselves to the Favour of the Public and can you do this more effectually than by cooperating with the public Spirit of the Legislature and Men in Power  Were this but done heartily would you but  be instant in Season and out of Season reprove rebuke exhort  Tim ch iv ver  such is the Ascendent you have gained over the People that we might soon expect to see the good Effects thereof We might hope  that our Garners would be soon full affording all manner of Store that our Sheep would bring forth thousands that our Oxen would be strong to labour that there would be no breaking in nor going out  no Robbery nor Migration nor Bread  and that there would be no Complaining in our Streets  Psal cxliv ver  It stands you upon to act with Vigour in this Cause and shake off the Shackles of Sloth from your Countrymen the rather because there be  some who surmise that yourselves have put them on Right or wrong Men will be apt to judge of your Doctrines by their Fruits It will reflect small Honour on their Teachers if instead of Honesty and Industry those of your Communion are peculiarly distinguished by the contrary Qualities or if the Nation converted by the great and glorious  Saint Patrick  should above ail other Nations be stigmatised and marked out as good for nothing  I can never suppose you so much your own Enemies as to be Friends to this odious Sloth But were this once abolished and a laudable Industry introduced in its Stead it may perhaps be asked who are to be Gainers I answer  your Reverences  are like to be great Gainers for every Peny you now gain you will gain a Shilling you would gain also in your Credit and your Lives would be more comfortable  You need not be told how hard it is to take from Rags and Penury a tolerable Subsistence or how offensive to perform the Duties of your Function amidst Stench and Nastiness or how much Things would change for the better in Proportion to the Industry and Wealth of your Flocks Duty as well as Interest calls upon you to clothe the Naked and feed the Hungry by persuading them to  eat  in the Apostle's Phrase  their own Bread  or as the  Psalmist  expresseth it  the Labour of their own Hands  By inspiring your Flocks with a Love of Industry you will at once strike at the Root of many Vices and dispose them to practise many Virtues This therefore is the readiest Way to improve them  Consult your Superiors They shall tell you the Doctrine here delivered is a sound Catholic Doctrine not limited to  Protestants  but extending to all and  admitted by all whether  Protestants  or  Roman Catholics Christians  or  Mahometans Jews  or  Gentiles  And as it is of the greatest Extent so it is also of the highest Importance  Saint Paul  expresly saith  That if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own House he hath denied the Faith and is worse than an Infidel  Tim ch v ver    In vain then do you endeavour to make Men Orthodox in Points of Faith if at the same time in the Eyes of  Christ  and his Apostles you suffer them to be worse than Infidels than those who have no Faith at all There is something it seems worse than even Infidelity and to incite and stimulate you to put away that cursed Thing from among you is the Design and Aim of this  Address  The Doctrine we recommend is an evident Branch of the Law of Nature it was taught by Prophets inculcated by Apostles encouraged and inforced by Philosophers Legislators and all wise States in all Ages and in all Parts of the World Let me therefore intreat you to exert yourselves  To be Instant in Season and out of Season rebuke reprove exhort  Take all Opportunities to drive the Lion out of the Way raise your Voices omit no Occasion public or private of awakening your wretched Countrymen from their sweet Dream of Sloth  Many suspect your Religion to be the Cause of that notorious Idleness which prevails so generally among the Natives of this Island as if the  Roman Catholic  Faith was inconsistent with an honest Diligence in a Man's Calling But whoever considers the great Spirit of Industry that reigns in  Flanders  and  France  and even beyond the  Alps  must acknowledge this to be a groundless Suspicion In  Piedmont  and  Genoa  in the  Milanese  and the  Venetian State  and indeed throughout all  Lombardy  how well is the Soil cultivated and what Manufactures of Silk Velvet Paper and other Commodities flourish The King of  Sardinia  will suffer no idle Hands in his Territories no Beggar to live by the Sweat of another's Brow it has even been made penal at  Turin  to relieve a strolling Beggar To which I might add that the Person whose Authority will be of the greatest Weight with you even the  Pope  himself is at this Day endeavouring to put new Life into the Trade and Manufactures of his Country  Though I am in no Secret of the Court of  Rome  yet I will venture to affirm that neither  Pope  nor  Cardinals  will be pleased to hear that those of their Communion are distinguished above all others by Sloth Dirt and Beggary or be displeased at your endeavouring to rescue them from the Reproach of such an infamous Distinction  The Case is as clear as the Sun what we urge is inforced by every Motive that can work on a reasonable Mind The Good of your Country your own private Interest the Duty of your Function the Cries and Distresses of the Poor do with one Voice call for your Assistance And if it is on all hands allowed to be right and just if agreeable both to Reason and Religion if coincident with the Views both of your temporal and spiritual Superiors it is to be hoped  this Address  may find a favourable Reception and that a Zeal for disputed Points will not hinder your concurring to propagate so plain and useful a Doctrine wherein we are all agreed  When a Leak is to be stopped or a Fire extinguished do not all Hands cooperate without Distinction of Sect or Party Or if I am fallen into a  Ditch shall I not suffer a Man to help me out until I have first examined his Creed Or when I am sick shall I refuse the Physic because my Physician doth or doth not believe the  Pope  's Supremacy  Fas est et ab Hoste doceri  But in truth I am no Enemy to your Persons whatever I may think of your Tenets On the contrary I am your sincere Wellwisher I consider you as my Countrymen as FellowSubjects as professing Belief in the same  Christ  And I do most sincerely wish there was no other Contest between us but  Who shall most compleatly practise the Precepts of Him by whose Name we are called and whose Disciples we all profess to be  Soon after the preceding ADDRESS was published the Printer hereof received the following LETTER from the Roman Catholic Clergy of the Diocese of Dublin desiring it to be inserted in the Dublin Journal of November  YOU will very much oblige many of your constant Readers if you acquaint the Public that the ADDRESS you lately published intitled  A Word to the Wise or An Exhortation to the Roman Catholic Clergy of Ireland  was received by the  Roman  Catholic Clergy of  Dublin  with the highest Sense of Gratitude and they take the Liberty in this public Manner to return their sincere and hearty Thanks to the worthy Author assuring him that they are determined to comply with every Particular recommended in it to the utmost of their Power In every Page it contains a Proof of the Author's  extensive Charity His Views are only towards the public Good The Means he prescribeth are easily complied with and his Manner of treating Persons in their Circumstances so very singular that they plainly shew the Good Man the polite Gentleman and the true Patriot All this hath so great an Effect upon them that they have already directed circular Letters to the Parish Priests of this Diocese recommending in the most earnest Manner the Perusal and zealous Execution of what is contained in the said Address and it is hoped that by publishing this in your Journal the  Roman  Catholic Clergy of the other Parts of this Kingdom will be induced to follow their Example which must promote the laudable Views of that great and good Man At the same Time he may be assured that the  Roman  Catholic Clergy of this City have frequently taken considerable Pains to recommend to their respective Flocks Industry and a due Application to their different Trades and Callings as an indispensible Duty and the Means of avoiding the many Vices and bad Consequences which generally attend criminal Poverty and Want But the more effectually to prevent these Evils and remove all Excuses for Sloth and Idleness they have several Months ago pursuant to the Example of many Bishopricks in  Lombardy Spain Naples  c taken the Steps most proper and expedient in their Opinion to lessen considerably the Number of Holidays in this Kingdom and they make no Doubt but their Expectations will in a short time be fully answered to the great Advantage of the Public  We are  c  A LETTER TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICS of the Diocese of Cloyne  Published in the late Rebellion A D MDCIXLV  My Countrymen and Fellow Subjects  NOtwithstanding the Differences of our religious Opinions I should be sorry to be wanting in any Instance of Humanity or good Neighbourhood to any of you For which Reason I find myself strongly inclined at this critical Juncture to put you in mind that you have been treated with a truly Christian Lenity under the present Government that your Persons have been protected and your Properties secured by equal Laws and that it would be highly imprudent as well as ungrateful to forfeit these Advantages by making yourselves Tools to the Ambition of foreign Princes who fancy it expedient to raise Disturbances among us at present but as soon as their own Ends are served will not fail to abandon you as they have always done  Is it not evident that your true Interest consists in lying still and waiting the Event since  Ireland  must necessarily follow the Fate of  England  and that therefore Prudence and Policy prescribe Quiet to the Roman Catholics of this Kingdom who in case a Change of Hands should not succeed after your attempting to bring it about must then expect to be on a worse Foot than ever  But we will suppose it succeeds to your Wish What then Would not this undermine even your own Interests and Fortune which are often interwoven with those of your Neighbours Would not all those who have Debts or Money or other Effects in the Hands of Protestants be fellow Sufferers with them Would not all those who hold under the Acts of Settlement be as liable as Protestants themselves to be dispossessed by the old Proprietors Or can even those who are stiled Proprietors flatter themselves with Hopes of possessing the Estates which they claim which in all likelihood would be given to Favourites perhaps to Foreigners who are near the Person or who fought the Battles of their Master  Under Protestant Governments those of your Communion have formerly enjoyed a greater Share of the Lands of this Kingdom and more ample Privileges You bore your Part in the Magistracy and the Legislature and could complain of no Hardships on the Score of your Religion If these Advantages have been since impaired or lost was it not by the wrong Measures yourselves took to enlarge them in several successive Attempts each of which left you weaker and in a worse Condition than you were before And this notwithstanding the vaunted Succours of  France  and  Spain  whose vain Efforts in Conjunction with yours constantly recoiled on your own Heads even when  your Numbers and Circumstances were far more considerable than they now are  You all know these Things to be true I appeal to your own Breasts Dear bought Experience hath taught you and past Times instruct the present But perhaps you follow Conscience rather than Interest Will any Men amongst you pretend to plead Conscience against being quiet or against paying Allegiance and peaceable Submission to a Protestant Prince which the first Christians paid even to Heathen and which those of your Communion at this Day pay to Mahometan and to Idolatrous Princes in  Turky  and  China  and which you yourselves have so often professed to pay to our present gracious Sovereign Conscience is quite out of the Case And what Man in his Senses would engage in a dangerous Course to which neither Interest doth invite nor Conscience oblige him  I heartily wish that this Advice may be as well taken as it is meant and that you may maturely consider your true Interest rather than rashly repeat the same Errors which you have so often repented of So recommending you to the merciful Guidance of Almighty God I subscribe myself  Your real Wellwisher GEORGE CLOYNE  MAXIMS CONCERNING PATRIOTISM  First Published A D MDCCL  EVERY Man by consulting his own Heart may easily know whether he is or is not a Patriot But it is not so easy for the Bystanders  Being loud and vehement either against a Court or for a Court is no Proof of Patriotism  A Man whose Passion for Money runs high bids fair for being no Patriot And he likewise whose Appetite is keen for Power  A Native than a Foreigner a married Man than a Bachelor a Believer than an Infidel have a better Chance for being Patriots  It is impossible an Epicure should be a Patriot  It is impossible a Man who cheats at Cards or cogs the Dice should be a Patriot  It is impossible a Man who is false to his Friends and Neighbours should be true to the Public  Every Knave is a thorough Knave And a thorough Knave is a Knave throughout  A Man who hath no Sense of God or Conscience would you make such a one Guardian to your Child if not why Guardian to the State  A Sot a Beast benummed and stupified by Excess is good for nothing much less to make a Patriot of  A Fop or Man of Pleasure makes but a scurvy Patriot  A sullen churlish Man who loves no Body will hardly love his Country  The Love of Praise and Esteem may do something but to make a true Patriot there must be an inward Sense of Duty and Conscience  Honesty like other Things grows from its proper Seed good Principles early laid in the Mind  To be a real Patriot a Man must consider his Countrymen as God's Creatures and himself as accountable for his acting towards them  If  pro Aris et Focis  be the Life of Patriotism he who hath no Religion or no Home makes a suspected Patriot  No Man perjures himself for the sake of Conscience  There is an easy Way of reconciling Malecontents  Sunt verba voces quibus hunc lenire dolorem  c  A good Groom will rather stroke than strike  He who saith there is no such Thing as an honest Man you may be sure is himself a Knave  I have no Opinion of your bumper Patriots Some eat some drink some quarrel for their Country MODERN PATRIOTISM    Ibycus  is a carking griping closefisted Fellow It is odds that  Ibycus  is not a Patriot  We are not to think every clamorous Haranguer or every splenetic Repiner against a Court is therefore a Patriot  A Patriot is one who heartily wisheth the public Prosperity and doth not only wish but also study and endeavour to promote it  Gamesters Fops Rakes Bullies Stockjobbers alas what Patriots  Some Writers have thought it impossible that Men should be brought to laugh at public Spirit Yet this hath been done in the present Age  The Patriot aims at his private Good in the Public The Knave makes the Public subservient to his private Interest The former considers himself as Part of a Whole the latter considers himself as the Whole  There is and ever will be a natural Strife between Court and Country The one will get as much and the other give as little as it can How must the Patriot behave himself  He gives the necessary If he gives more it is with a View of gaining more to his Country  A Patriot will never barter the public Money for his private Gain  Moral Evil is never to be committed physical Evil may be incurred either to avoid a greater Evil or to procure a good  Where the Heart is right there is true Patriotism  In your Man of Business it is easier to meet with a good Head than a good Heart  A Patriot will admit there may be honest Men and that honest Men may differ  He that always blames or always praises is no Patriot  Were all sweet and sneaking Courtiers or were all four Malecontents in either Case the Public would thrive but ill  A Patriot would hardly wish there was no Contrast in the State  Ferments of the worst Kind succeed to perfect Inaction  A Man rages rails and raves I suspect his Patriotism  The fawning Courtier and the surly 'Squire often mean the same Thing each his own Interest  A Patriot will esteem no Man for being of his Party  The factious Man is apt to mistake himself for a Patriot  THE QUERIST CONTAINING Several  QUERIES  Proposed to the CONSIDERATION OF THE PUBLIC  I the Lord have brought down the high Tree have exalted the low Tree have dried up the green Tree and have made the dry Tree to flourish  Ezek xvii  First Printed A D MDCCXXXV  Advertisement by the AUTHOR  THE QUERIST was first printed in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirtyfive since which Time the Face of Things is somewhat changed In this Edition some Alterations have been made The three Parts are published in one some Few Queries are added and many omitted particularly of those relating to the Sketch or Plan of a national Bank which it may be time enough to take again in hand when the Public shall seem disposed to make use of such an Expedient I had determined with myself never to prefix my Name to the Querist but in the last Edition was overruled by a Friend who was remarkable for pursuing the publics Interest with as much Diligence as others do their own I apprehend the same Censure on this that I incurred upon another Occasion for meddling out of my profession Though to feed the Hungry and clothe the Naked by promoting an honest Industry will perhaps be deemed no improper Employment for a Clergyman who still thinks himself a Member of the Commonwealth As the Sum of human Happiness is supposed to consist in the Goods of Mind Body and Fortune I would fain make my Studies of some Use to Mankind with regard to each of these three Particulars and hope it will not be thought faulty or indecent in any Man of what Profession soever to offer his Mite towards improving the Manners Health and Prosperity of his Fellowcreatures  THE QUERIST  Qu  WHETHER there ever was is or will be an industrious Nation poor or an idle rich  Whether a People can be called poor where the common Sort are well fed clothed and lodged  Whether the Drift and Aim of every wise State should not be to encourage Industry in its Members And whether those who employ neither Heads nor Hands for the common Benefit deserve not to be expelled like Drones out of a well governed State  Whether the four Elements and Man's Labour therein be not the true Source of Wealth  Whether Money be not only so far useful as it stirreth up Industry enabling Men mutually to participate the Fruits of each others Labour  Whether any other Means equally conducing to excite and circulate the Industry of Mankind may not be as useful as Money  Whether the real End and Aim of Men be not Power And whether he who could have every Thing else at his Wish or Will would value Money  Whether the public Aim in every well governed State be not that each Member according to his just Pretensions and Industry should have Power  Whether Power be not referred to Action and whether Action doth not follow Appetite or Will  Whether Fashion doth not create Appetites and whether the prevailing Will of a Nation is not the Fashion  Whether the Current of Industry and Commerce be not determined by this prevailing Will  Whether it be not owing to Custom that the Fashions are agreeable  Whether it may not concern the Wisdom of the Legislature to interpose in the making of Fashions and not leave an Affair of so great Influence to the Management of Women and Fops Taylors and Vintners  Whether reasonable Fashions are a greater Restraint on Freedom than those which are unreasonable  Whether a general good Taste in a People would not greatly conduce to their thriving And whether an uneducated Gentry be not the greatest of national Evils  Whether Customs and Fashions do not supply the Place of Reason in the Vulgar of all Ranks Whether therefore it doth not very much import that they should be wisely framed  Whether the imitating those Neighbours in our Fashions to whom we bear no Likeness in our Circumstances be not one Cause of Distress to this Nation  Whether frugal Fashions in the upper Rank and comfortable Living in the lower be not the Means to multiply Inhabitants  Whether the Bulk of our  Irish  Natives are not kept from thriving by that Cynical Content in Dirt and Beggary which they possess to a Degree beyond any other People in Christendom  Whether the creating of Wants be not the likeliest Way to produce Industry in a People And whether if our Peasants were accustomed to eat Beef and wear Shoes they would not be more industrious  Whether other Things being given as Climate Soil  c  the Wealth be not proportioned to the Industry and this to the Circulation of Credit be the Credit circulated or transferred by what Marks or Tokens soever  Whether therefore less Money swiftly circulating be not in effect equivalent to more Money slowly circulating Or whether if the Circulation be reciprocally as the Quantity of Coin the Nation can be a Loser  Whether Money is to be considered as having an intrinsic Value or as being a Commodity a Standard a Measure or a Pledge as is variously suggested by Writers And whether the true Idea of Money as such be not altogether that of a Ticket or Counter  Whether the Value or Price of Things be not a compounded Proportion directly as the Demand and reciprocally as the Plenty  Whether the Terms Crown Livre Pound Sterling  c  are not to be considered as Exponents or Denominations of such Proportion And whether Gold Silver and Paper are not Tickets or Counters for Reckoning Recording and Transferring thereof  Whether the Denominations being retained although the Bullion were gone Things might not nevertheless be rated bought and sold Industry  promoted and a Circulation of Commerce maintained  Whether an equal raising of all Sorts of Gold Silver and Copper Coin can have any Effect in bringing Money into the Kingdom And whether altering the Proportions between the several Sorts can have any other Effect but multiplying one Kind and lessening another without any Increase of the Sum total  Whether arbitrary changing the Denomination of Coin be not a public Cheat  What makes a wealthy People Whether Mines of Gold and Silver are capable of doing this And whether the Negroes amidst the Gold Sands of  Afric  are not poor and destitute  Whether there be any Virtue in Gold or Silver other than as they set People at Work or create Industry  Whether it be not the Opinion or Will of the People exciting them to Industry that truly enricheth a Nation And whether this doth not principally depend on the Means for counting transferring and preserving Power that is Property of all Kinds  Whether if there was no Silver or Gold in the Kingdom our Trade might not nevertheless supply Bills of Exchange sufficient to answer the Demands of Absentees in  England  or elsewhere  Whether current BankNotes may not be deemed Money And whether they are not actually the greater Part of the Money of this Kingdom  Provided the Wheels move whether it is not the same Thing as to the Effect of the Machine be this done by the Force of Wind or Water or Animals  Whether Power to command the Industry of others be not real Wealth And whether Money  be not in truth Tickets or Tokens for conveying and recording such Power and whether it be of great Consequence what Materials the Tickets are made of  Whether Trade either foreign or domestic be in truth any more than this Commerce of Industry  Whether to promote transfer and secure this Commerce and this Property in human Labour or in other words this Power be not the sole Means of enriching a People and how far this may be done independently of Gold and Silver  Whether it were not wrong to suppose Land itself to be Wealth And whether the Industry of the People is not first to be considered as that which constitutes Wealth which makes even Land and Silver to be Wealth neither of which would have any Value but as Means and Motives to Industry  Whether in the Wastes of  America  a Man might not possess twenty Miles square of Land and yet want his Dinner or a Coat to his Back  Whether a fertile Land and the Industry of its Inhabitants would not prove inexhaustible Funds of real Wealth be the Counters for conveying and recording thereof what you will Paper Gold or Silver  Whether a single Hint be sufficient to overcome a Prejudice And whether even obvious Truths will not sometimes bear repeating  Whether if human Labour be the true Source of Wealth it doth not follow that Idleness should of all Things be discouraged in a wise State  Whether even Gold or Silver if they should lessen the Industry of its Inhabitants would not be ruinous to a Country And whether  Spain  be not an Instance of this  Whether the Opinion of Men and their Industry consequent thereupon be not the true Wealth of  Holland  and not the Silver supposed to be deposited in the Bank at  Amsterdam  Whether there is in truth any such Treasure lying dead And whether it be of great Consequence to the Public that it should be real rather than notional  Whether in order to understand the true Nature of Wealth and Commerce it would not be right to consider a Ship's Crew cast upon a desert Island and by degrees forming themselves to Business and civil Life while Industry begot Credit and Credit moved to Industry  Whether such Men would not all set themselves to Work Whether they would not subsist by the mutual Participation of each other's Industry Whether when one Man had in his Way procured more than he could consume he would not exchange his Superfluities to supply his Wants Whether this must not produce Credit Whether to facilitate these Conveyances to record and circulate this Credit they would not soon agree on certain Tallies Tokens Tickets or Counters  Whether Reflexion in the better Sort might not soon remedy our Evils And whether our real Defect be not in a wrong Way of Thinking  Whether it would not be an unhappy Turn in our Gentlemen if they should take more Thought to create an Interest to themselves in this or that County or Borough than to promote the real Interest of their Country  Whether if a Man builds a House he doth not in the first Place provide a Plan which governs his Work And shall the Public act without an End a View a Plan  Whether by how much the less particular Folk think for themselves the Public be not so much the more obliged to think for them  Whether small Gains be not the Way to great Profit And if our Tradesmen are Beggars whether they may not thank themselves for it  Whether some Way might not be found for making Criminals useful in public Works instead of sending them either to  America  or to the other World  Whether we may not as well as other Nations contrive Employment for them And whether Servitude Chains and hard Labour for a Term of Years would not be a more discouraging as well as a more adequate Punishment for Felons than even Death itself  Whether there are not such Things in  Holland  as bettering Houses for bringing young Gentlemen to Order And whether such an Institution would be useless among us  Whether it be true that the Poor in  Holland  have no Resource but their own Labour and yet there are no Beggars in their Streets  Whether he whose Luxury consumeth foreign Products and whose Industry produceth nothing domestic to exchange for them is not so far forth injurious to his Country  Whether Necessity is not to be hearkened to before Convenience and Convenience before Luxury  Whether to provide plentifully for the Poor be not feeding the Root the Substance whereof will shoot upwards into the Branches and cause the Top to flourish  Whether there be any Instance of a State wherein the People living neatly and plentifully did not aspire to Wealth  Whether Nastiness and Beggary do not on the contrary extinguish all such Ambition making Men listless hopeless and slothful  Whether a Country inhabited by People well fed clothed and lodged would not become every Day more populous And whether a numerous Stock of People in such Circumstances would not constitute a flourishing Nation and how far the Product of our own Country may suffice for the compassing of this End  Whether a People who had provided themselves with the Necessaries of Life in good Plenty would not soon extend their Industry to new Arts and new Branches of Commerce  Whether those same Manufactures which  England  imports from other Countries may not be admitted from  Ireland  And if so whether Lace Carpets and Tapestry three considerable Articles of  English  Importation might not find Encouragement in  Ireland  And whether an Academy for Design might not greatly conduce to the perfecting those Manufactures among us  Whether  France  and  Flanders  could have drawn so much Money from  England  for figured Silks Lice and Tapestry if they had not had Academies for Designing  Whether when a Room was once prepared and Models in Plaister of  Paris  the Annual Expence of such an Academy need stand the Public in above two hundred Pounds a Year  Whether our LinenManufacture would not find the Benefit of this Institution and whether there be any Thing that makes us fall short of the  Dutch  in Damasks Diapers and printed Linen but our Ignorance in Design  Whether those who may slight this Affair as notional have sufficiently considered the extensive  Use of the Art of Design and its Influence in most Trades and Manufactures wherein the Forms of Things are often more regarded than the Materials  Since the first Publication of this Query the Art of Design seems to be more considered and countenanced among us    Whether there be any Art sooner learned than that of making Carpets And whether our Women with little Time and Pains may not make more beautiful Carpets than those imported from  Turkey  And whether this Branch of the WoollenManufacture be not open to us  Whether human Industry can produce from such cheap Materials a Manufacture of so great Value by any other Art as by those of Sculpture and Painting  Whether Pictures and Statues are not in Fact so much Treasure And whether  Rome  and  Florence  would not be poor Towns without them  Whether they do not bring ready Money as well as Jewels Whether in  Italy  Debts are not paid and Children portioned with them as with Gold and Silver  Whether it would not be more prudent to strike out and exert ourselves in permitted Branches of Trade than to fold our Hands and repine that we are not allowed the Woollen  Whether it be true that two Millions are yearly expended by  England  by foreign Lace and Linen  Whether immense Sums are not drawn yearly into the  Northern  Countries for supplying the  British  Navy with Hempen Manufactures  Whether there be any Thing more profitable than Hemp And whether there should not be great Praemiums for encouraging our Hempen Trade  What Advantages may not  GreatBritain  make of a Country where Land and Labour are so cheap  Whether  Ireland  alone might not raise Hemp sufficient for the  British  Navy And whether it would not be vain to expect this from the  British  Colonies in  America  where Hands are so scarce and Labour so excessively dear  Whether if our our own People want Will or Capacity for such an Attempt it might not be worth while for some undertaking Spirits in  England  to make Settlements and raise Hemp in the Counties of  Clare  and  Limerick  than which perhaps there is not fitter Land in the World for that Purpose And whether both Nations would not find their Advantage therein  Whether if all the idle Hands in this Kingdom were employed on Hemp and Flax we might not find sufficient Vent for these Manufactures  How far it may be in our own Power to better our Affairs without interfering with our Neighbours  Whether the Prohibition of our WoollenTrade ought not naturally to put us on other Methods which give no Jealousy  Whether Paper be not a valuable Article of Commerce And whether it be not true that one single Bookseller in  London  yearly expended above four thousand Pounds in that foreign Commodity  How it comes to pass that the  Venetians  and  Genoese  who wear so much less Linen and so much worse than we do should yet make very good Paper and in great Quantity while we make very little  How long it will be before my Countrymen find out that it is worth while to spend a Peny in order to get a Groat  If all the Land were tilled that is fit for Tillage and all that sowed with Hemp and Flax that is fit for raising them whether we should have much Sheepwalk beyond what was sufficient to supply the Necessities of the Kingdom  Whether other Countries have not flourished without the WoollenTrade  Whether it be not a sure Sign or Effect of a Country's thriving to see it well cultivated and full of Inhabitants And if so whether a great Quantity of Sheepwalk be not ruinous to a Country rendering it waste and thinly inhabited  Whether the employing so much of our Land under Sheep be not in fact an  Irish  Blunder  Whether our hankering after our WoollenTrade be not the true and only Reason which hath created a Jealousy in  England  towards  Ireland  And whether any Thing can hurt us more than such Jealousy  Whether it be not the true Interest of both Nations to become one People And whether either be sufficiently apprized of this  Whether the upper Part of this People are not truly  English  by Blood Language Religion Manners Inclination and Interest  Whether we are not as much  Englishmen  as the Children of old  Romans  born in  Britain  were still  Romans  Whether it be not our true Interest not to interfere with them and in every other Case whether it be not their true interest to befriend us  Whether a Mint in  Ireland  might not be of great Convenience to the Kingdom and whether it could be attended with any possible Inconvenience to  GreatBritain  And whether there were not Mints in  Naples  and in  Sicily  when those Kingdoms were Provinces to  Spain  or the House of  Austria  Whether any Thing can be more ridiculous than for the  North  of  Ireland  to be jealous of a LinenManufacture in the  South  Whether the County of  Tipperary  be not much better Land than the County of  Armagh  and yet whether the latter is not much better improved and inhabited than the former  Whether every Landlord in the Kingdom doth not know the Cause of this And yet how few are the better for such their Knowledge  Whether large Farms under few Hands or small ones under many are likely to be made most of And whether Flax and Tillage do not naturally multiply Hands and divide Land into small Holdings and wellimproved  Whether as our Exports are lessened we ought not to lessen our Imports And whether these will not be lessened as our Demands and these as our Wants and these as our Customs or Fashions Of how great Consequence therefore are Fashions to the Public  Whether it would not be more reasonable to mend our State than to complain of it and how far this may be in our own Power  What the Nation gains by those who live in  Ireland  upon the Produce of foreign Countries  How far the Vanity of our Ladies in dressing and of our Gentlemen in drinking contributes to the general Misery of the People  Whether Nations as wife and opulent as ours have not made sumptuary Laws and what hinders us from doing the same  Whether those who drink foreign Liquors and deck themselves and their Families with foreign Ornaments are not so far forth to be reckoned Absentees  Whether as our Trade is limited we ought not to limit our Expences and whether this be not the natural and obvious Remedy  Whether the Dirt and Famine and Nakedness of the Bulk of our People might not be remedied even although we had no foreign Trade And whether this should not be our first Care and whether if this were once provided for the Conveniencies of the Rich would not soon follow  Whether comfortable Living doth not produce Wants and Wants Industry and Industry Wealth  Whether there is not a great Difference between  Holland  and  Ireland  And whether foreign Commerce without which the one could not subsist be so necessary for the other  Might we not put a Hand to the Plough or the Spade although we had no foreign Commerce  Whether the Exigencies of Nature are not to be answered by Industry on our own Soil And how far the Conveniences and Comforts of Life may be procured by a domestic Commerce between the several Parts of this Kingdom  Whether the Women may not few spin weave embroider sufficiently for the Embellishment of their Persons and even enough to raise Envy in each other without being beholden to foreign Countries  Suppose the Bulk of our Inhabitants had Shoes to their Feet Clothes to their Backs and Beef in their Bellies Might not such a State be eligible for the Public even though the 'Squires were condemned to drink Ale and Cider  Whether if Drunkenness be a necessary Evil Men may not as well drink the Growth of their own Country  Whether a Nation within itself might not have real Wealth sufficient to give its Inhabitants Power and Distinction without the Help of Gold and Silver  Whether if the Arts of Sculpture and Painting were encouraged among us we might not furnish our Houses in a much nobler Manner with our own Manufactures  Whether we have not or may not have all the necessary Materials for Building at home  Whether Tiles and Plaister may not supply the Place of  Norway  Fir for Flooring and Wainscot  Whether Plaister be not warmer as well as more secure than Deal And whether a modern fashionable House lined with Fir daubed over with Oil and Paint be not like a Fireship ready to be lighted up by all Accidents  Whether larger Houses better built and furnished a greater Train of Servants the Difference with regard to Equipage and Table between finer and coarser more and less elegant may not be sufficient to feed a reasonable Share of Vanity or support all proper Distinctions And whether all these may not be procured by domestic Industry out of the four Elements without ransacking the four Quarters of the Globe  Whether any Thing is a nobler Ornament in the Eye of the World than an  Italian  Palace that is Stone and Morter skilfully put together and adorned with Sculpture and Painting and whether this may not be compassed without foreign Trade  Whether an Expence in Gardens and Plantations would not be an elegant Distinction for the Rich a domestic Magnificence employing many Hands within and drawing nothing from abroad  Whether the Apology which is made for foreign Luxury in  England  to wit that they could  not carry on their Trade without Imports as well as Exports will hold in  Ireland  Whether one may not be allowed to conceive and suppose a Society or Nation of human Creatures clad in Woollen Cloths and Stuffs eating good Bread Beef and Mutton Poultry and Fish in great Plenty drinking Ale Mead and Cider inhabiting decent Houses built of brick and Marble taking their Pleasure in fair Parks and Gardens depending on no foreign Imports either for Food or Raiment And whether such People ought much to be pitied  Whether  Ireland  be not as well qualified for such a State as any Nation under the Sun  Whether in such a State the Inhabitants may not contrive to pass the twentyfour Hours with tolerable Ease and Chearfulness And whether any People upon Earth can do more  Whether they may not eat drink play dress visit sleep in good Beds fit by good Fires build plant raise a Name make Estates and spend them  Whether upon the whole a domestic Trade may not suffice in such a Country as  Ireland  to nourish and clothe its Inhabitants and provide them with the reasonable Conveniencies and even Comforts of Life  Whether a general Habit of living well would not produce Numbers and Industry and whether considering the Tendency of human Kind the Consequence thereof would not be foreign Trade and Riches how unnecessary soever  Whether nevertheless it be a Crime to enquire how far we may do without foreign Trade and what would follow on such a Supposition  Whether the Number and Welfare of the Subjects be not the true Strength of the Crown  Whether in all public Institutions there should not be an End proposed which is to be the Rule and Limit of the Means Whether this End should not be the Wellbeing of the Whole And whether in order to this the first Step should not be to clothe and feed our People  Whether there be upon Earth any Christian or civilized People so beggarly wretched and destitute as the common  Irish  Whether nevertheless there is any other People whose Wants may be more easily supplied from home  Whether if there was a Wall of Brass a thousand Cubits high round this Kingdom our Natives might not nevertheless live cleanly and comfortably till the Land and reap the Fruits of it  What should hinder us from exerting ourselves using our Hands and Brains doing something or other Man Woman and Child like the other Inhabitants of God's Earth  Be the restraining our Trade well or ill advised in our Neighbours with respect to their own Interest yet whether it be not plainly ours to accommodate ourselves to it  Whether it be not vain to think of persuading other People to see their Interest while we continue blind to our own  Whether there be any other Nation possessed of so much good Land and so many able Hands to work it which yet is beholden for Bread to foreign Countries  Whether it be true that we import Corn to the Value of two hundred thousand Pounds in some Years  Things are now better in respect of this Particular and some others than they were when the  Querist  was first published  Whether we are not undone by Fashions made for other People And whether it be not Madness in a poor Nation to imitate a rich one  Whether a Woman of Fashion ought not to be declared a public Enemy  Whether it be not certain that from the single Town of  Cork  were exported in one Year no less than one hundred and seven thousand one hundred sixtyone Barrels of Beef seven thousand three hundred and seventynine Barrels of Pork thirteen thousand four hundred and sixtyone Casks and eightyfive thousand seven hundred and twentyseven Firkins of Butter And what Hands were employed in this Manufacture  Whether a Foreigner could imagine that one half of the People were starving in a Country which sent out such Plenty of Provisions  Whether an  Irish  Lady set out with  French  Silks and  Flanders  Lace may not be said to consume more Beef and Butter than a hundred of our labouring Peasants  Whether nine Tenths of our foreign Trade be not carried on singly to support the Article of Vanity  Whether it can be hoped that private Persons will not indulge this Folly unless restrained by the Public  How Vanity is maintained in other Countries Whether in  Hungary  for Instance a proud Nobility are not subsisted with small Imports from abroad  Whether there be a prouder People upon Earth than the noble  Venetians  although they all wear plain black Clothes  Whether a People are to be pitied that will not sacrifice their little particular Vanities to the public Good And yet whether each Part would  not except their own Foible from this public Sacrifice the 'Squire his Bottle the Lady her Lace  Whether Claret be not often drank rather for Vanity than for Health or Pleasure  Whether it be true that Men of nice Palates have been imposed on by Elder Wine for  French  Claret and by Mead for Palm Sack  Do not  Englishmen  abroad purchase Beer and Cider at ten Times the Price of Wine  How many Gentlemen are there in  England  of a thousand Pounds  per Annum  who never drink Wine in their own Houses Whether the same may be said of any in  Ireland  who have even one hundred Pounds  per Annum  What Reason have our Neighbours in  England  for discouraging  French  Wines which may not hold with respect to us also  How much of the necessary Sustenance of our People is yearly exported for Brandy  Whether if People must poison themselves they had not better do it with their own Growth  If we imported neither Claret from  France  nor Fir from  Norway  what the Nation would save by it  When the Root yieldeth insufficient Nourishment whether Men do not top the Tree to make the lower Branches thrive  Whether if our Ladies drank Sage or Baum Tea out of  Irish  Ware it would be an insupportable national Calamity  Whether it be really true that such Wine is best as most encourages drinking  i e  that must be given in the largest Dose to produce its Effect And whether this holds with regard to any other Medicine  Whether that Trade should not be accounted most pernicious wherein the Balance is most against us And whether this be not the Trade with  France  Whether it be not even Madness to encourage Trade with a Nation that takes nothing of our Manufacture  Whether  Ireland  can hope to thrive if the major Part of her Patriots should be found in the  French  Interest  Whether great Plenty and Variety of excellent Wines are not to be had on the Coasts of  Italy  and  Sicily  And whether those Countries would not take our Commodities of Linen Leather Butter  c  in exchange for them  Particularly whether the  Vinum Mamertinum  which grows on the Mountains about  Messina  a red generous Wine highly esteemed if we may credit  Pliny  by the ancient  Romans  would not come cheap and please the Palates of our Islanders  Why if a Bribe by the Palate or the Purse be in effect the same Thing they should not be alike infamous  Whether the Vanity and Luxury of a few ought to stand in Competition with the Interest of a Nation  Whether national Wants ought not to be the Rule of Trade And whether the most pressing Wants of the Majority ought not to be first considered  Whether it is possible the Country should be well improved while our Beef is exported and our Labourers live upon Potatoes  If it be resolved that we cannot do without foreign Trade whether at least it may not be worth while to consider what Branches thereof deserve  to be entertained and how far we may be able to carry it on under our present Limitations  What foreign Imports may be necessary for clothing and feeding the Families of Persons not worth above one hundred Pounds a Year And how many wealthier there are in the Kingdom and what Proportion they bear to the other Inhabitants  Whether Trade be not then on a right Foot when foreign Commodities are imported in Exchange only for domestic Superfluities  Whether the Quantities of Beef Butter Wooll and Leather exported from this Island can be reckoned the Superfluities of a Country where there are so many Natives naked and famished  Whether it would not be wise so to order our Trade as to export Manufactures rather than Provisions and of those such as employ most Hands  Whether she would not be a very vile Matron and justly thought either mad or foolish that should give away the Necessaries of Life from her naked and famished Children in Exchange for Pearls to stick in her Hair and sweet Meats to please her own Palate  Whether a Nation might not be considered as a Family  Whether the Remark made by a  Venetian  Ambassador to Cardinal  Richlieu    That  France  needed nothing to be rich and easy but to know how to spend what she dissipates  may not be of use also to other People  Whether hungry Cattle will not leap over Bounds And whether most Men are not hungry in a Country where expensive Fashions obtain  Whether there should not be published yearly Schedules of our Trade containing an Account of the Imports and Exports of the foregoing Year  Whether other Methods may not be found for supplying the Funds besides the Custom on Things imported  Whether any Art or Manufacture be so difficult as the making of good Laws  Whether our Peers and Gentlemen are born Legislators Or whether that Faculty be acquired by Study and Reflexion  Whether to comprehend the real Interest of a People and the Means to procure it doth not imply some Fund of Knowledge historical moral and political with a Faculty of Reason improved by Learning  Whether every Enemy to Learning be not a  Goth  And whether every such  Goth  among us be not an Enemy to the Country  Whether therefore it would not be an Omen of ill Presage a dreadful Phaenomenon in the Land if our great Men should take it in their Heads to deride Learning and Education  Whether on the contrary it should not seem worth while to erect a Mart of Literature in this Kingdom under wiser Regulations and better Discipline than in any other Part of  Europe  And whether this would not be an infallible Means of drawing Men and Money into the Kingdom  Whether the governed be not too numerous for the governing Part of our College And whether it might not be expedient to convert thirty NativesPlaces into twenty Fellowships  Whether if we had two Colleges there might not spring an useful Emulation between them And whether it might not be contrived so to divide the Fellows Scholars and Revenues between both as that no Member should be a Loser thereby  Whether ten thousand Pounds well laid out might not build a decent College fit to contain two  hundred Persons and whether the PurchaseMoney of the Chambers would not go a good Way towards defraying the Expence  Where this College should be situated  Whether in Imitation of the Jesuits at  Paris  who admit Protestants to study in their Colleges it may not be right for us also to admit RomanCatholics into our College without obliging them to attend ChapelDuties or Catechisms or DivinityLectures And whether this might not keep Money in the Kingdom and prevent the Prejudices of a foreign Education  Whether it is possible a State should not thrive whereof the lower part were industrious and the upper wise  Whether the collected Wisdom of Ages and Nations be not found in Books  Whether  Themistocles  his Art of making a little City or a little People become a great one be learned any where so well as in the Writings of the Ancients  Whether a wise State hath any Interest nearer Heart than the Education of Youth  Whether the Mind like Soil doth not by Disuse grow stiff and whether Reasoning and Study be not like stirring and dividing the Glebe  Whether an early Habit of Reflexion although obtained by speculative Sciences may not have its Use in practical Affairs  Whether even those Parts of Academical Learning which are quite forgotten may not have improved and enriched the Soil like those Vegetables which are raised not for themselves but plowed in for a Dressing of Land  Whether it was not an  Irish  Professor who first opened the public Schools at  Oxford  Whether  this Island hath not been anciently famous for Learning And whether at this Day it hath any better Chance for being considerable  Whether we may not with better Grace sit down and complain when we have done all that lies in our Power to help

Youth And whether half the Learning and Study of these Kingdoms is not useless for want of a proper Delivery and Pronunciation being taught in our Schools and Colleges  Whether in any Order a good Building can be made of bad Materials Or whether any Form of Government can make a happy State out of bad Individuals  What was it that  Solomon  compared to a Jewel of Gold in a Swine's Snout  Whether the Public is more concerned in any Thing than in the Procreation of able Citizens  Whether to the Multiplying of HumanKind it would not much conduce if Marriages were made with goodliking  Whether if Women had no Portions we should then see so many unhappy and unfruitful Marriages  Whether the Laws be not according to  Aristotle  a Mind without Appetite or Passion And consequently without Respect of Persons  Suppose a rich Man's Son marries a poor Man's Daughter suppose also that a poor Man's Daughter is deluded and debauched by the Son of a rich Man which is most to be pitied  Whether the Punishment should be placed on the Seduced or the Seducer  Whether a Promise made before God and Man in the most solemn Manner ought to be violated  Whether it was  Plato  's Opinion that  for the Good of the Community rich should marry with rich de Leg  l  Whether as Seed equally scattered produceth a goodly Harvest even so an equal Distribution of Wealth doth not cause a Nation to flourish  Whence is it that  Barbs  and  Arabs  are so good Horses And whether in those Countries they are not exactly nice in admitting none but Males of a good Kind to their Mares  What Effects would the same Care produce in Families  Whether the real Foundation for Wealth must not be laid in the Numbers the Frugality and the Industry of the People And whether all Attempts to enrich a Nation by other Means as raising the Coin StockJobbing and such Arts are not vain  Whether a Door ought not to be shut against all other Methods of growing rich save only by Industry and Merit And whether Wealth got otherwise would not be ruinous to the Public  Whether the Abuse of Banks and PaperMoney is a just Objection against the use thereof And whether such Abuse might not easily be prevented  Whether national Banks are not found useful in  Venice Holland  and  Hamburgh  And whether it is not possible to contrive one that may be useful also in  Ireland  Whether the Banks of  Venice  and  Amsterdam  are not in the Hands of the Public  Whether it may not be worth while to inform ourselves in the Nature of those Banks And what Reason can be assigned why  Ireland  should not reap the Benefit of such public Banks as well as other Countries  Whether a Bank of national Credit supported by public Funds and secured by Parliament be a Chimera or impossible Thing and if not what would follow from the Supposal of such a Bank  Whether the Currency of a Credit so well secured would not be of great Advantage to our Trade and Manufactures  Whether the Notes of such public Bank would not have a more general Circulation than those of private Banks as being less subject to Frauds and Hazards  Whether it be not agreed that Paper hath in many Respects the Advantage above Coin as being of more Dispatch in Payments more easily transferred preserved and recovered when lost  Whether besides these Advantages there be not an evident Necessity for circulating Credit by Paper from the Defect of Coin in this Kingdom  Whether it be rightly remarked by some that as Banking brings no Treasure into the Kingdom like Trade private Wealth must sink as the Bank riseth And whether whatever causeth Industry to flourish and circulate may not be said to increase our Treasure  Whether the ruinous Effects of  Mississippi SouthSea  and such Schemes were not owing to an abuse of PaperMoney or Credit in making it a Means for Idleness and Gaming instead of a Motive and Help to Industry  Whether the Rise of the Bank of  Amsterdam  was not purely casual for the Security and Dispatch of Payments And whether the good Effects thereof in supplying the Place of Coin and promoting a ready Circulation of Industry and Commerce may not be a Lesson to us to do that by Design which others fell upon by Chance  Whether plenty of small Cash be not absolutely necessary for keeping up a Circulation among the People that is whether Copper be not more necessary than Gold  Whether that which increaseth the Stock of a Nation be not a Means of increasing its Trade And whether that which increaseth the current Credit of a Nation may not be said to increase its Stock  Whether the Credit of the public Funds be not a Mine of Gold to  England  And whether any Step that should lessen this Credit ought not to be dreaded  Whether such Credit be not the principal Advantage that  England  hath over  France  I may add over every other Country in  Europe  Whether by this the Public is not become possessed of the Wealth of Foreigners as well as Natives And whether  England  be not in some sort the Treasury of  Christendom  Whether as our current domestic Credit grew Industry would not grow likewise and if Industry our Manufactures and if these our foreign Credit  Whether foreign Demands may not be answered by our Exports without drawing Cash out of the Kingdom  Whether as Industry increased our Manufactures would not flourish and as these flourished whether better Returns would not be made from Estates to their Landlords both within and without the Kingdom  Whether the sure Way to supply People with Tools and Materials and to set them at Work be not a free Circulation of Money whether Silver of Paper  Whether in  New England  all Trade and Business is not as much at a Stand upon a Scarcity of PaperMoney as with us from the Want of Specie  Whether it be certain that the Quantity of Silver in the Bank of  Amsterdam  be greater now than at first but whether it be not certain that there is a greater Circulation of Industry and Extent of Trade more People Ships Houses and Commodities of all Sorts more Power by Sea and Land  Whether Money lying dead in the Bank of  Amsterdam  would not be as useless as in the Mine  Whether our visible Security in Land could be doubted And whether there be any Thing like this in the Bank of  Amsterdam  Whether it be just to apprehend Danger from trusting a national Bank with Power to extend its Credit to circulate Notes which it shall be Felony to counterfeit to receive Goods on Loans to purchase Lands to sell also or alienate them and to deal in Bills of Exchange when these Powers are no other than have been trusted for many Years  with the Bank of  England  although in Truth but a private Bank  Whether the Objection from Monopolies and an OverGrowth of Power which are made against private Banks can possibly hold against a national one  Whether the evil Effects which of late Years have attended PaperMoney and Credit in  Europe  did not spring from Subscriptions Shares Dividends and StockJobbing  Whether the great Evils attending PaperMoney in the  British  Plantations of  America  have not sprung from the overrating their Lands and issuing Paper without Discretion and from the Legislators breaking their own Rules in Favour of themselves thus sacrificing the Public to their private Benefit And whether a little Sense and Honesty might not easily prevent all such Inconveniencies  Whether the Subject of Freethinking in Religion be not exhausted And whether it be not high Time for our FreeThinkers to turn their Thoughts to the Improvement of their Country  Whether it must not be ruinous for a Nation to sit down to game be it with Silver or with Paper  Whether therefore the circulating Paper in the late ruinous Schemes of  France  and  England  was the true Evil and not rather the circulating thereof without Industry And whether the Bank of  Amsterdam  where Industry had been for so many Years subsisted and circulated by Transfers on Paper doth not clearly decide this Point  Whether there are not to be seen in  America  fair Towns wherein the People are well lodged fed and clothed without a Beggar in their  Streets although there be not one Grain of Gold or Silver current among them  Whether these People do not exercise all Arts and Trades build Ships and navigate them to all Parts of the World purchase Lands till and reap the Fruits of them buy and sell educate and provide for their Children Whether they do not even indulge themselves in foreign Vanities  Whether whatever Inconveniencies those People may have incurred from not observing either Rules or Bounds in their PaperMoney yet it be not certain that they are in a more flourishing Condition have larger and better built Towns more Plenty more Industry more Arts and Civility and a more extensive Commerce than when they had Gold and Silver current among them  Whether a View of the ruinous Effects of absurd Schemes and Credit mismanaged so as to produce Gaming and Madness instead of Industry can be any just Objection against a national Bank calculated purely to promote Industry  Whether a Scheme for the Welfare of this Nation should not take in the whole Inhabitants And whether it be not a vain Attempt to project the flourishing of our Protestant Gentry exclusive of the Bulk of the Natives  Whether an Oath testifying Allegiance to the King and disclaiming the Pope's Authority in Temporals may not be justly required of the RomanCatholics And whether in common Prudence or Policy any Priest should be tolerated who refuseth to take it  Whether there is any such Thing as a Body of Inhabitants in any RomanCatholic Country under the Sun that profess an absolute Submission to the Pope's Orders in Matters of an indifferent  Nature or that in such Points do not think it their Duty to obey the civil Government  Whether since the Peace of  Utrecht  Mass was not celebrated and the Sacraments administred in divers Dioceses of  Sicily  notwithstanding the  Pope  's Interdict  Whether a Sum which would go but a little Way towards erecting Hospitals for maintaining and educating the Children of the native  Irish  might not go far in binding them out Apprentices to Protestant Masters for Husbandry useful Trades and the Service of Families  Whether there be any Instance of a People's being converted in a Christian Sense otherwise than by preaching to them and instructing them in their own Language  Whether Catechists in the  Irish  Tongue may not easily be procured and subsisted And whether this would not be the most practicable Means for converting the Natives  Whether it be not of great Advantage to the Church of  Rome  that she hath Clergy suited to all Ranks of Men in gradual Subordination from Cardinals down to Mendicants  Whether her numerous poor Clergy are not very useful in Missions and of much Influence with the People  Whether in Defect of able Missionaries Persons conversant in low Life and speaking the  Irish  Tongue if well instructed in the first Principles of Religion and in the popish Controversy though for the rest on a Level with the Parish Clerks or the Schoolmasters of CharitySchools may not be fit to mix with and bring over our poor illiterate Natives to the established Church Whether it is not to be wished that some Parts of our  Liturgy and Homilies were publicly read in the  Irish  Language And whether in these Views it may not be right to breed up some of the better Sort of Children in the CharitySchools and qualify them for Missionaries Catechists and Readers  Whether a 'Squire possessed of Land to the Value of a thousand Pounds  per Annum  or a Merchant worth twenty thousand Pounds in Cash would have most Power to do good or evil upon any Emergency And whether the suffering Roman Catholics to purchase forfeited Lands would not be good Policy as tending to unite their Interest with that of the Government  Whether the Seaports of  Galway Limerick Cork  and  Waterford  are not to be looked on as Keys of this Kingdom And whether the Merchants are not possessed of these Keys and who are the most numerous Merchants in those Cities  Whether a Merchant cannot more speedily raise a Sum more easily conceal or transfer his Effects and engage in any desperate Design with more safety than a landed Man whose Estate is a Pledge for his Behaviour  Whether a wealthy Merchant bears not great Sway among the Populace of a trading City And whether Power be not ultimately lodged in the People  Whether as others have supposed an  Atlantis  or  Eutopia  we also may not suppose an  Hyperborean  Island inhabited by reasonable Creatures  Whether an indifferent Person who looks into all Hands may not be a better Judge of the Game than a Party who sees only his own  Whether there be any Country in Christendom more capable of Improvement than  Ireland  Whether we are not as far before other Nations with respect to natural Advantages as  we are behind them with respect to Arts and Industry  Whether we do not live in a most fertile Soil and temperate Climate and yet whether our People in general do not feel great Want and Misery  Whether my Countrymen are not readier at finding Excuses than Remedies  Whether the Wealth and Prosperity of our Country do not hang by a Hair the Probity of one Banker the Caution of another and the Lives of all  Whether we have not been sufficiently admonished of this by some late Events  Whether a national Bank would not at once secure our Properties put an End to Usury facilitate Commerce supply the Want of Coin and produce ready Payments in all Parts of the Kingdom  Whether the Use or Nature of Money which all Men so eagerly pursue be yet sufficiently understood or considered by all  What doth  Aristotle  mean by saying    de Repub l  ix  Whether Mankind are not governed by Imitation rather than by Reason  Whether there be not a Measure or Limit within which Gold and Silver are useful and beyond which they may be hurtful  Whether that Measure be not the circulating of Industry  Whether a Discovery of the richest Gold Mine that ever was in the Heart of this Kingdom would be a real Advantage to us  Whether it would not tempt Foreigners to prey upon us  Whether it would not render us a lazy proud and dastardly People  Whether every Man who had Money enough would not be a Gentleman And whether a Nation of Gentlemen would not be a wretched Nation  Whether all Things would not bear a high Price And whether Men would not increase their Fortunes without being the better for it  Whether the same Evils would be apprehended from PaperMoney under an honest and thrifty Regulation  Whether therefore a national Bank would not be more beneficial than even a Mine of Gold  Whether without private Banks what little Business and Industry there is would not stagnate But whether it be not a mighty Privilege for a private Person to be able to create an hundred Pounds with a Dash of his Pen  Whether the wise State of  Venice  was not the first that conceived the Advantage of a national Bank  Whether the great Exactness and Integrity with which this Bank is managed be not the chief Support of that Republic  Whether the Bank of  Amsterdam  was not begun about one hundred and thirty Years ago and whether at this Day its Stock be not conceived to amount to three thousand Tons of Gold or thirty Millions Sterling  Whether all Payments of Contracts for Goods in gross and Letters of Exchange must not be made by Transfers in the Bank Books provided the Sum exceed three hundred Florins  Whether it be not owing to this Bank that the City of  Amsterdam  without the least Confusion Hazard or Trouble maintains and every Day promotes so general and quick a Circulation of Industry  Whether it be not the greatest Help and Spur to Commerce that Property can be so readily conveyed and so well secured by a  Compte en Banc  that is by only writing one Man's Name for another's in the BankBook  Whether at the beginning of the last Century those who had lent Money to the Public during the War with  Spain  were not satisfied by the sole Expedient of placing their Names in a  Compte en Banc  with Liberty to transfer their Claims  Whether the Example of those easy Transfers in the  Compte en Banc  thus casually erected did not tempt other Men to become Creditors to the Public in order to profit by the same secure and expeditious Method of keeping and transferring their Wealth  Whether this  Compte en Banc  hath not proved better than a Mine of Gold to  Amsterdam  Whether that City may not be said to owe her Greatness to the unpromising Accident of her having been in Debt more than she was able to pay  Whether it be known that any State from such small Beginnings in so short a time ever grew to so great Wealth and Power as the Province of  Holland  hath done and whether the Bank of  Amsterdam  hath not been the real Cause of such extraordinary Growth  Whether the Success of those public Banks in  Venice Amsterdam  and  Hamburgh  would not naturally produce in other States an Inclination to the same Methods  Whether it be possible for a national Bank to subsist and maintain its Credit under a  French  Government  Whether our natural Appetites as well as Powers are not limited to their respective Ends  and Uses But whether artificial Appetites may not be infinite  Whether the simple getting of Money or passing it from Hand to Hand without Industry be an Object worthy of a wise Government  Whether if Money be considered as an End the Appetite thereof be not infinite But whether the Ends of Money itself be not bounded  Whether the total Sum of all other Powers be it of Enjoyment or Action which belong to Man or to all Mankind together is not in truth a very narrow and limited Quantity But whether Fancy is not boundless  Whether this capricious Tyrant which usurps the Place of Reason doth not most cruelly torment and delude those poor Men the Usurers StockJobbers and Projectors of Content to themselves from heaping up Riches that is from gathering Counters from multiplying Figures from enlarging Denominations without knowing what they would be at and without having a proper Regard to the Use or End or Nature of Things  Whether the  Ignisfatuus  of Fancy doth not kindle immoderate Desires and lead Men into endless Pursuits and wild Labyrinths  Whether Counters be not referred to other Things which so long as they keep Pace and Proportion with the Counters it must be owned the Counters are useful but whether beyond that to value or covet Counters be not direct Folly  Whether the public Aim ought not to be that Mens Industry should supply their present Wants and the Overplus be converted into a Stock of Power  Whether the better this Power is secured and the more easily it is transferred Industry be not so much the more encouraged  Whether Money more than is expedient for those Purposes be not upon the whole hurtful rather than beneficial to a State  Whether the promoting of Industry should not be always in View as the true and sole End the Rule and Measure of a national Bank And whether all Deviations from that Object should not be carefully avoided  Whether it may not be useful for supplying Manufactures and Trade with Stock for regulating Exchange for quickening Commerce for putting Spirit into the People  Whether we are sufficiently sensible of the peculiar Security there is in having a Bank that consists of Land and Paper one of which cannot be exported and the other is in no Danger of being exported  Whether it be not delightful to complain And whether there be not many who had rather utter their Complaints than redress their Evils  Whether if  the Crown of the Wise be their Riches  Prov xiv  we are not the foolishest People in  Christendom  Whether we have not all the while great civil as well as natural Advantages  Whether there be any People who have more Leisure to cultivate the Arts of Peace and study the public Weal  Whether other Nations who enjoy any Share of Freedom and have great Objects in View be not unavoidably embarassed and distracted by Factions But whether we do not divide upon Trifles and whether our Parties are not a Burlesk upon Politics  Whether it be not an Advantage that we are not embroiled in foreign Affairs that we hold  not the Balance of  Europe  that we are protected by other Fleets and Armies that it is the true Interest of a powerful People from whom we are descended to guard us on all Sides  Whether  England  doth not really love us and wish well to us as  Bone  of her  Bone  and  Flesh  of her  Flesh  And whether it be not our Part to cultivate this Love and Affection all manner of Ways  What SeaPorts or foreign Trade have the  Swisses  and yet how warm are those People and how well provided  Whether there may not be found a People who so contrive as to be impoverished by their Trade And whether we are not that People  Whether it would not be better for this Island if all our fine Folk of both Sexes were shipped off to remain in foreign Countries rather than that they should spend their Estates at home in foreign Luxury and spread the Contagion thereof through their native Land  Whether our Gentry understand or have a Notion of Magnificence and whether for Want thereof they do not affect very wretched Distinctions  Whether there be not an Art or Skill in governing human Pride so as to render it subservient to the public Aim  Whether the great and general Aim of the Public should not be to employ the People  What right an eldest Son hath to the worst Education  Whether Mens Counsels are not the Result of their Knowledge and their Principles  Whether there be not Labour of the Brains as well as of the Hands and whether the former is beneath a Gentleman  Whether the Public be more interested to protect the Property acquired by mere Birth than that which is the immediate Fruit of Learning and Virtue  Whether it would not be a poor and illjudged Project to attempt to promote the Good of the Community by invading the Rights of one Part thereof or of one particular Order of Men  Whether there be a more wretched and at the same time a more unpitied Case than for Men to make Precedents for their own Undoing  Whether to determine about the Rights and Properties of Men by other Rules than the Law be not dangerous  Whether those Men who move the CornerStones of a Constitution may not pull an old House on their own Heads  Whether there be not two general Methods whereby Men become Sharers in the national Stock of Wealth or Power Industry and Inheritance And whether it would be wise in a civil Society to lessen that Share which is allotted to Merit and Industry  Whether all Ways of spending a Fortune be of equal Benefit to the Public and what Sort of Men are aptest to run into an improper Expence  If the Revenues allotted for the Encouragement of Religion and Learning were made hereditary in the Hands of a dozen LayLords and as many overgrown Commoners whether the Public would be much the better for it  Whether the Church's Patrimony belongs to one Tribe alone and whether every Man's Son Brother or himself may not if he please be qualified to share therein  What is there in the Clergy to create a Jealousy in the Public Or what would the Public  lose by it if every 'Squire in the Land wore a black Coat said his Prayers and was obliged to reside  Whether there be any Thing perfect under the Sun And whether it be not with the World as with a particular State and with a State or BodyPolitic as with the human Body which lives and moves under various Indispositions perfect Health being seldom or never to be found  Whether nevertheless Men should not in all Things aim at Perfection And therefore whether any wise and good Man would be against applying Remedies But whether it is not natural to wish for a benevolent Physician  Whether the public Happiness be not proposed by the Legislature and whether such Happiness doth not contain that of the Individuals  Whether therefore a Legislator should be content with a vulgar Share of Knowledge Whether he should not be a Person of Reflexion and Thought who hath made it his Study to understand the true Nature and Interest of Mankind how to guide Mens Humours and Passions how to incite their active Powers how to make their several Talents cooperate to the mutual Benefit of each other and the general Good of the whole  Whether it doth not follow that above all Things a Gentleman's Care should be to keep his own Faculties

grave by fifty  Whether all Men have not Faculties of Mind or Body which may be employed for the public Benefit  Whether the main Point be not to multiply and employ our People  Whether hearty Food and warm Clothing would not enable and encourage the lower Sort to labour  Whether in such a Soil as ours if there was Industry there could be Want  Whether the Way to make Men industrious be not to let them taste the Fruits of their Industry And whether the labouring Ox should be muzzled  Whether our Landlords are to be told that Industry and Numbers would raise the Value of their Lands or that

whether their Habitations and Furniture are not more sordid than those of the Savage  Americans  Whether it be not a sad Circumstance to live among lazy Beggars And whether on the other hand it would not be delightful to live in a Country swarming like  China  with busy People  Whether we should not cast about by all Manner of Means to excite Industry and to remove whatever hinders it And whether

increased the Number of the Poor  Whether WorkHouses should not be made at the least Expence with ClayFloors and Walls of rough Stone without plaistering cieling or glazing  Whether it be an impossible Attempt to set our People at work or whether Industry be a Habit which like other Habits may by Time and Skill be introduced among any People  Whether all manner of Means should not be

not be a Preferment to such a Fellow  Whether Criminals in the freest Country may not forfeit their Liberty and repair the Damage they have done the Public by hard Labour  What the Word Servant signifies in the NewTestament  Whether the View of Criminals chained in Pairs and kept at hard Labour would not be very edifying to the Multitude  Whether the Want of such an Institution be not plainly seen in  England  where the Disbelief of a future State hardeneth Rogues against the Fear of Death and where through the great Growth of Robbers and Housebreakers it becomes every Day more necessary  Whether it be not easier to prevent than to remedy and whether we should not profit by the Example of others  Whether Felons are not often spared and therefore encouraged by the Compassion

twenty do not ruin themselves by foreign Luxury  Whether in proportion as  Ireland  was improved and beautified by fine Seats the Number of Absentees would not decrease  Whether he who employs Men in Buildings and Manufactures doth not put Life in the Country and whether the Neighbourhood round him be not observed to thrive  Whether Money circulated on the Landlords own Lands and among his own Tenants doth not return into his own Pocket  Whether every 'Squire that made his Domain swarm with busy Hands like a BeeHive or AntHill would not serve his own Interest as well as that of his Country  Whether a Gentleman who hath seen a little of the World and observed how Men live elsewhere can contentedly sit down in a cold damp sordid Habitation in the midst of a bleak Country inhabited by Thieves and Beggars  Whether on the other hand a handsom Seat amidst wellimproved Lands fair Villages and a thriving Neighbourhood may not invite a Man to dwell on his own Estate and quit the Life of an insignificant Santerer about Town for that of an useful CountryGentleman  Whether it would not be of Use and Ornament if the Towns throughout this Kingdom were provided with decent Churches TownHouses  WorkHouses MarketPlaces and paved Streets with some Order taken for Cleanliness  Whether if each of these Towns were addicted to some peculiar Manufacture we should not find that the employing many Hands together on the same Work was the Way to perfect our Workmen And whether all these Things might not soon be provided by a domestic Industry if Money were not wanting  Whether Money could ever be wanting to the Demands of Industry if we had a national Bank  Whether the Fable of  Hercules  and the Carter ever suited any Nation like this Nation of  Ireland  Whether it be not a new Spectacle under the Sun to behold in such a Climate and such a Soil and under such a gentle Government so many Roads untroden Fields untilled Houses desolate and Hands unemployed  Whether there is any Country in  Christendom  either Kingdom or Republic depending or independent free or inslaved which may not afford us an useful Lesson  Whether the frugal  Swisses  have any other Commodities but their Butter and Cheese and a few Cattle for Exportation whether nevertheless the single Canton of  Bern  hath not in her public Treasury two Millions Sterling  Whether that small Town of  Bern  with its scanty barren Territory in a mountainous Corner without SeaPorts without Manufactures without Mines be not rich by mere Dint of Frugality  Whether the  Swisses  in general have not sumptuary Laws prohibiting the use of Gold Jewels Silver Silk and Lace in their Apparel and indulging  the Women only to wear Silk on Festivals Weddings and public Solemnities  Whether there be not two Ways of growing Rich sparing and getting But whether the lazy Spendthrift must not be doubly poor  Whether Money circulating be not the Life of Industry and whether the Want thereof doth not render a State gouty and inactive  But whether if we had a national Bank and our present Cash small as it is were put into the most convenient Shape Men should hear any public Complaints for want of Money  Whether all Circulation be not alike a Circulation of Credit whatsoever Medium Metal or Paper is employed and whether Gold be any more than Credit for so much Power  Whether the Wealth of the richest Nations in  Christendom  doth not consist in Paper vastly more than in Gold and Silver  Whether Lord  Clarendon  doth not aver of his own Knowledge that the Prince of  Orange  with the best Credit and the Assistance of the richest Men in  Amsterdam  was above ten Days endeavouring to raise twenty thousand Pounds in Specie without being able to raise half the Sum in all that Time  See  Clarendon'  s History  B  Supposing there had been hitherto no such Thing as a Bank and the Question were now first proposed whether it would be safer to circulate unlimited Bills in a private Credit or Bills to a limited Value on the public Credit of the Community what would Men think  Whether the Maxim  What is every Body's Business is no Body's  prevails in any Country under the Sun more than in  Ireland  Whether the united Stock of a Nation be not the best Security And whether any Thing  but the Ruin of the State can produce a national Bankruptcy  Whether the total Sum of the public Treasure Power and Wisdom all cooperating be not most likely to establish a Bank of Credit sufficient to answer the Ends relieve the Wants and satisfy the Scruples of all People  Whether  London  is not to be considered as the Metropolis of  Ireland  And whether our Wealth such as it is doth not circulate through  London  and throughout all  England  as freely as that of any Part of his Majesty's Dominions  Whether therefore it be not evidently the Interest of the People of  England  to encourage rather than to oppose a national Bank in this Kingdom as well as every other Means for advancing our Wealth which shall not impair their own  Whether it is not our Interest to be useful to them rather than rival them and whether in that Case we may not be sure of their good Offices  Whether we can propose to thrive so long as we entertain a wrongheaded Distrust of  England  Whether as a national Bank would increase our Industry and that our Wealth  England  may not be a proportionable Gainer and whether we should not consider the Gains of our MotherCountry as some Accession to our own  Whether there be any Difficulty in comprehending that the whole Wealth of the Nation is in truth the Stock of a national Bank And whether any more than the right Comprehension of this be necessary to make all Men easy with regard to its Credit  Whether the Prejudices about Gold and Silver are not strong but whether they are not still Prejudices  Whether Paper doth not by its Stamp and Signature acquire a local Value and become as precious and as scarce as Gold And whether it be not much fitter to circulate large Sums and therefore preferable to Gold  Whether it doth not much import to have a right Conception of Money And whether its true and just Idea be not that of a Ticket intitling to Power and fitted to record and transfer such Power  Though the Bank of  Amsterdam  doth very rarely if at all pay out Money yet whether every Man possessed of Specie be not ready to convert it into Paper and act as Cashier to the Bank And whether from the same Motive every monied Man throughout this Kingdom would not be Cashier to our national Bank  Whether we may not obtain that as Friends which it is in vain to hope for as Rivals  Whether in every Instance by which we prejudice  England  we do not in a greater Degree prejudice ourselves  Whether in the rude Original of Society the first Step was not the exchanging of Commodities the next a substituting of Metals by Weight as the common Medium of Circulation after this the making use of Coin lastly a further Refinement by the use of Paper with proper Marks and Signatures And whether this as it is the last so it be not the greatest Improvement  Whether we are not in Fact the only People who may be said to starve in the midst of Plenty  Whether there can be a worse Sign than that People should quit their Country for a Livelihood Though Men often leave their Country for Health or Pleasure or Riches yet to leave it  merely for a Livelihood Whether this be not exceeding bad and sheweth some peculiar Mismanagement  Whether in Order to redress our Evils artificial Helps are not most wanted in a Land where Indusiry is most against the natural Grain of the People  Whether although the Prepossessions about Gold and Silver have taken deep Root yet the Example of our Colonies in  America  doth not make it as plain as DayLight that they are not so necessary to the Wealth of a Natiion as the Vulgar of all Ranks imagine  Whether it be not evident that we may maintain a much greater inward and outward Commerce and be five Times richer than we are nay and our Bills abroad be of far greater Credit though we had not one Ounce of Gold or Silver in the whole Island  Whether wrongheaded Maxims Customs and Fashions are not sufficient to destroy any People which hath so few Resources as the Inhabitants of  Ireland  Whether it would not be an horrible Thing to see our Matrons make Dress and Play their chief Concern

free Trade whatever she remits for foreign Luxury with one hand doth not with the other receive much more from abroad Whether nevertheless this Nation would not be a Gainer if our Women would content themselves with the same Moderation in point of Expence as the  English  Ladies  But whether it be not a notorious Truth that our  Irish  Ladies are on a Foot as to dr  s with those of five times their Fortune in  England  Whether it be not even certain that the Matrons of this forlorn Country send out a greater Proportion of its Wealth for fine Apparel than any other Females on the whole

not to be respected  Whether a national Bank be not the true Philosopher's Stone in a State  Whether all Regulations of Coin should not be made with a View to encourage Industry and a Circulation of Commerce throughout the Kingdom  Whether to oil the Wheels of Commerce be not a common Benefit And whether this be not done by avoiding Fractions and multiplying small Silver  Whether all Things considered a general raising the Value of Gold and Silver be not so far from bringing greater Quantities thereof into the Kingdom that it would produce a direct contrary Effect inasmuch as less in that Case would serve and therefore less be wanted And whether Men do not import a Commodity in Proportion to the Demand or Want of it  Whether the lowering of our Gold would not create a Fever in the State And whether a Fever be not sometimes a Cure but whether it be not the last Cure a Man would choose  Whether raising the Value of a particular Species will not tend to multiply such Species and

not true that the Prices of Things increase as the Quantity of Money increaseth and are diminished as that is diminished And whether by the Quantity of Money is not to be understood the Amount of the Denominations all Contracts being nominal for Pounds Shillings and Pence and not for Weights of Gold or Silver  Whether our Exports do not consist of such Necessaries as other Countries cannot well be without  Whether upon the Circulation of a national Bank more Land would not be tilled more Hands employed and consequently more Commodities exported  Whether Silver and small Money be not that which circulates the quickest and passeth through all Hands on the Road in the Market at the Shop  Whether all Things considered it would not be better for a Kingdom that its Cash consisted of half a Million in small Silver than of five Times that Sum in Gold  Whether there be not every Day five hundred lesser Payments made for one that requires Gold  Whether  Spain  where Gold bears the highest Value be not the laziest and  China  where it bears the lowest be not the most industrious Country in the known World  Whether it be not evidently the Interest of every State that its Money should rather circulate than stagnate  Whether the principal Use of Cash be not its ready passing from hand to hand to answer common Occasions of the common People and whether common Occasions of all Sorts of People are not small ones  Whether Business at Fairs and Markets is not often at a Stand and often hindred even though the Seller hath his Commodities at hand and the Purchaser his Gold yet for Want of Change  As Wealth is really Power and Coin a Ticket conveying Power whether those Tickets which are the fittest for that Use ought not to be preferred  Whether those Tickets which singly transfer small Shares of Power and being multiplied large Shares are not fitter for common Use than those which singly transfer large Shares  Whether the Public is not more benefited by a Shilling that circulates than a Pound that lies dead  Whether Sixpence twice paid be not as good as a Shilling once paid  Whether the same Shilling circulating in a Village may not supply one Man with Bread another with Stockings a third with a Knife a fourth with Paper a fifth with Nails and so answer many Wants which must otherwise have remained unsatisfied  Whether facilitating and quickening the Circulation of Power to supply Wants be not the  promoting of Wealth and Industry among the lower People And whether upon this the Wealth of the Great doth not depend  Whether without the proper Means of Circulation it be not vain to hope for thriving Manufacturers and a busy People  Whether four Pounds in small Cash may not circulate and enliven an  Irish  Market which many Fourpound Pieces would permit to stagnate  In the Year this Country abounded with the large Gold Coins of  Portugal  which being overrated flowed in from all Parts But that Evil is since remedied  Whether a Man that could move nothing less than an hundred Pound Weight would not be much at a loss to supply his Wants and whether it would not be better for him to be less strong and more active  Whether the natural Body can be in a State of Health and Vigour without a due Circulation of the Extremities even in the Fingers and Toes And whether the political Body any more than the natural can thrive without a proportionable Circulation through the minutest and most inconsiderable Parts thereof  If we had a Mint for coining only Shillings Sixpences and Copper Money whether the Nation would not soon feel the good Effects thereof  Whether the greater Waste by wearing of small Coins would not be abundantly overbalanced by their Usefulness  Whether it be not the Industry of common People that feeds the State and whether it be possible to keep this Industry alive without small Money  Whether the Want of this be not a great Bar to our employing the People in these Manufactures which are open to us and do not interfere with  Great Britain  Whether therefore such Want doth not drive Men into the lazy Way of employing Land under SheepWalk  Whether the running of Wooll from  Ireland  can so effectually be prevented as by encouraging other Business and Manufactures among our People  Whatever Commodities  Great Britain  importeth which we might supply whether it be not her real Interest to import them from us rather than from any other People  Whether the Apprehension of many among us who for that very Reason stick to their Wooll that  England  may hereaster prohibit limit or discourage our LinenTrade when it hath been once with great Pains and Expence thoroughly introduced and settled in this Land be not altogether groundless and unjust  Whether it is possible for this Country which hath neither Mines of Gold nor a free Trade to support for any time the sending out of Specie  Whether in Fact our Payments are not made by Bills And whether our foreign Credit doth not depend on our domestic Industry and our Bills on that Credit  Whether in order to mend it we ought not first to know the peculiar Wretchedness of our State And whether there be any knowing of this but by Comparison  Whether there are not single MarketTowns in  England  that turn more Money in buying  and selling than whole Counties perhaps Provinces with us  Whether the small Town of  Birmingham  alone doth not upon an Average circulate every Week one Way or other to the Value of fifty thousand Pounds But whether the same Crown may not be often paid  Whether any Kingdom in  Europe  be so good a Customer at  Bourdeaux  as  Ireland  Whether the Police and OEconomy of  France  be not governed by wise Councils And whether any one from this Country who sees their Towns and Manufactures and Commerce will not wonder what our Senators have been doing  What Variety and Number of excellent Manufactures are to be met with throughout the whole Kingdom of  France  Whether there are not every where some or other Mills for many Uses Forges and Furnaces for Iron Work Looms for Tapestry GlassHouses  and so forth  What Quantities of Paper Stockings Hats what Manufactures of Wooll Silk Linen Hemp Leather Wax EarthenWare Brass Lead Tin  c  Whether the Manufactures and Commerce of the single Town of  Lions  do not amount to a greater Value than all the Manufactures and all the Trade of this Kingdom taken together  Whether in the Anniversary Fair at the small Town of  Beaucair  upon the  Rhone  there be not as much Money laid out as the current Cash of this Kingdom amounts to  Whether the very Shreds shorn from WoollenCloth which are thrown away in  Ireland  do not make a beautiful Tapestry in  France  Whether there be not  French  Towns subsisted merely by making Pins  Whether the coarse Fingers of those very Women those same Peasants who one Part of the Year till the Ground and dress the Vineyards are not another employed in making the finest  French  Point  Whether there is not a great Number of idle Fingers among the Wives and Daughters of our Peasants  Whether the  French  do not raise a Trade from Saffron dying Drugs and the like Products which may do with us as well as with them  Whether we may not have Materials of our own Growth to supply all Manufactures as well as  France  except Silk and whether the Bulk of what Silk even France manufactures be not imported  Whether it be possible for this Country to grow rich so long as what is made by domestic Industry is spent in foreign Luxury  Whether our natural  Irish  are not partly  Spaniards  and partly  Tartars  and whether they do not bear Signatures of their Descent from both these Nations which is also confirmed by all their Histories  Whether the  Tartar  Progeny is not numerous in this Land And whether there is an idler Occupation under the Sun than to attend Flocks and Herds of Cattle  Whether the Wisdom of the State should not wrestle with this hereditary Disposition of our  Tartars  and with a high hand introduce Agriculture  Whether once upon a Time  France  did not by her Linen alone draw yearly from  Spain  about eight Millions of Livres  Whether the  French  have not suffered in their LinenTrade with  Spain  by not making their Cloth of due Breadth and whether any other People have suffered and are still likely to suffer through the same Prevarication  Things we hear are in a Way of being mended with us in this Respect  Whether the  Spaniards  are not rich and lazy and whether they have not a particular Inclination and Favour for the Inhabitants of this Island But whether a punctual People do not love punctual Dealers  Whether about fourteen Years ago we had not come into a considerable Share of the LinenTrade with  Spain  and what put a Stop to this  Whether if the LinenManufacture were carried on in the other Provinces as well as in the  North  the Merchants of  Cork Limerick  and  Galway  would not soon find the Way to  Spain  Whether the WoollenManufacture of  England  is not divided into several Parts or Branches appropriated to particular Places where they are only or principally manufactured fine Cloths in  Somersetshire  coarse in  Yorkshire  long Ells at  Exeter  Saies at  Sudbury  Crapes at  Norwich  Linseys at  Kendal  Blankets at  Whitney  and so forth  Whether the united Skill Industry and Emulation of many together on the same Work be not the Way to advance it And whether it had been otherwise possible for  England  to have carried on her WoollenManufacture to so great Perfection  Whether it would not on many Accounts be right if we observed the same Course with respect to our LinenManufacture and that Diapers  were made in one Town or District Damasks in another Sheeting in a third fine wearing Linen in a fourth coarse in a fifth in another Cambricks in another Thread and Stockings in others stamped Linen or striped Linen or Tickings or dyed Linen of which last Kinds there is so great a Consumption among the Seafaring Men of all Nations  Whether it may not be worth while to inform ourselves of the different sorts of Linen which are in Request among different People  Whether we do not yearly consume of  French  Wines about a thousand Tuns more than either  Sweden  or  Denmark  and yet whether those Nations pay ready Money as we do  Whether it be not a Custom for some thousands of  Frenchmen  to go about the Beginning of  March  into  Spain  and having tilled the Lands and gathered the Harvest of  Spain  to return home with Money in their Pockets about the End of  November  Whether of late Years our  Irish  Labourers do not carry on the same Business in  England  to the great Discontent of many there But whether we have not much more Reason than the People of  England  to be displeased at this Commerce  Whether notwithstanding the Cash supposed to be brought into it any Nation is in truth a Gainer by such Traffic  Whether the Industry of our People employed in foreign Lands while our own are left uncultivated be not a great Loss to the Country  Whether it would not be much better for us if instead of sending our Men abroad we could draw Men from the neighbouring Countries to cultivate our own  Whether nevertheless we are not apt to think the Money imported by our Labourers to be so much clear Gains to this Country but whether a little Reflexion and a little political Arithmetic may not shew us our Mistake  Whether our Prejudices about Gold and Silver are not very apt to infect or misguide our Judgments and Reasonings about the public Weal  Whether it be not a good Rule whereby to judge of the Trade of any City and its Usefulness to observe whether there is a Circulation through the Extremities and whether the People round about are busy and warm  Whether we had not some Years since a Manufacture of Hats at  Athlone  and of EarthenWare at  Arklow  and what became of those Manufacures  Why do we not make Tiles of our own for Flooring and Roofing rather than bring them from  Holland  What Manufactures are there in  France  and  Venice  of gilt Leather how cheap and how splendid a Furniture  Whether we may not for the same Use manufacture divers Things at home of more Beauty and Variety than Wainscot which is imported at such Expence from  Norway  Whether the Use and the Fashion will not soon make a Manufacture  Whether if our Gentry used to drink Mead and Cider we should not soon have those Liquors in the utmost Perfection and Plenty  Whether it be not wonderful that with such Pastures and so many black Cattle we do not find ourselves in Cheese  Whether great Profits may not be made by Fisheries but whether those of our  Irish  who live  by that Business do not contrive to be drunk and unemployed one half of the Year  Whether it be not Folly to think an inward Commerce cannot enrich a State because it doth not increase its Quantity of Gold and Silver And whether it is possible a Country should not thrive while Wants are supplied and Business goes on  Whether Plenty of all the Necessaries and Comforts of Life be not real Wealth  Whether  Lions  by the Advantage of her midland Situation and the Rivers  Rhone  and  Sone  be not a great Magazine or Mart for inward Commerce And whether she doth not maintain a constant Trade with most Parts of  France  with  Provence  for Oils and dried Fruits for Wines and Cloth I with  Languedoc  for Stuffs with  Champaign  for Linen with  Picardy Normandy  and  Bretagny  for Corn with  Burgundy  Whether she doth not receive and utter all those Commodities and raise a Profit from the Distribution thereof as well as of her own Manufactures throughout the Kingdom of  France  Whether the Charge of making good Roads and navigable Rivers across the Country would not be really repaid by an inward Commerce  Whether as our Trade and Manufactures increased Magazines should not be established in proper Places fitted by their Situation near great Roads and navigable Rivers Lakes or Canals for the ready Reception and Distribution of all Sorts of Commodities from and to the several Parts of the Kingdom and whether the Town of  Athlone  for Instance may not be fitly situated for such a Magazine or Centre of domestic Commerce  Whether an inward Trade would not cause Industry to flourish and multiply the Circulation of our Coin and whether this may not do as well as multiplying the Coin itself  Whether the Benefits of a domestic Commerce are sufficiently understood and attended to and whether the Cause thereof be not the prejudiced and narrow Way of thinking about Gold and Silver  Whether there be any other more easy and unenvied Method of increasing the Wealth of a People  Whether we of this Island are not from our peculiar Circumstances determined to this very Commerce above any other from the Number of Necessaries and good Things that we possess within ourselves from the Extent and Variety of our Soil from the navigable Rivers and good Roads which we have or may have at a less Expence than any People in  Europe  from our great Plenty of Materials for Manufactures and particularly from the Restraints we lie under with regard to our foreign Trade

CardTables of  Dublin  than at all the Fairs of  Ireland  Whether the Wealth of a Country will not bear Proportion to the Skill and Industry of its Inhabitants  Whether foreign Imports that tend to promote Industry should not be encouraged and such as have a Tendency to promote Luxury should not be discouraged  Whether the annual Balance of Trade between  Italy  and  Lions  be not about four Millions in Favour of the former and yet whether  Lions  be not a Gainer by this Trade  Whether the general Rule of determining the Profit of a Commerce by its Balance doth not like other general Rules admit of Exceptions  Whether it would not be a monstrous Folly to import nothing but Gold and Silver supposing we might do it from every foreign Part to which we trade And yet whether some Men may not think this foolish Circumstance a very happy one  But whether we do not all see the Ridicule of the  Mogul  's Subjects who take from us nothing but our Silver and bury it under Ground in order to make sure thereof against the Resurrection  Whether he must not be a wrongheaded Patriot or Politician whose ultimate View was drawing Money into a Country and keeping it there  Whether it be not evident that not Gold but Industry causeth a Country to flourish  Whether it would not be a silly Project in any Nation to hope to grow rich by prohibiting the Exportation of Gold and Silver  Whether there can be a greater Mistake in Politics than to measure the Wealth of the Nation by its Gold and Silver  Whether Gold and Silver be not a Drug where they do not promote Industry Whether they be not even the Bane and undoing of an idle People  Whether Gold will not cause either Industry or Vice to flourish And whether a Country where it flowed in without Labour must not be  wretched and dissolute like an Island inhabited by Buccaneers  Whether Arts and Virtue are not likely to thrive where Money is made a Means to Industry But whether Money without this would be a Blessing to any People  Whether keeping Cash at home or sending it abroad just as it most serves to promote Industry be not the real Interest of every Nation  Whether Commodities of all Kinds do not naturally flow where there is the greatest Demand Whether the greatest Demand for a Thing be not where it is of most Use Whether Money like other Things hath not its proper Use Whether this Use be not to circulate Whether therefore there must not of course be Money where there is a Circulation of Industry  Whether it is not a great Point to know what we would be at And whether whole States as well as private Persons do not often fluctuate for want of this Knowledge  Whether Gold may not be compared to  Sejanus  's Horse if we consider its Passage through the World and the Fate of those Nations which have been successively possessed thereof  Whether Means are not so far useful as they answer the End And whether in different Circumstances the same Ends are not obtained by different Means  If we are a poor Nation abounding with very poor People will it not follow that a far greater Proportion of our Stock should be in the smallest and lowest Species than would suit with  England  Whether therefore it would not be highly expedient if our Money were coined of peculiar Values best fitted to the Circumstances and  Uses of our own Country and whether any other People could take Umbrage at our consulting our own Convenience in an Affair entirely domestic and that lies within ourselves  Whether every Man doth not know and hath not long known that the Want of a Mint causech many other Wants in this Kingdom  What Harm did  England  sustain about three Centuries ago when Silver was coined in this Kingdom  What Harm was it to  Spain  that her Provinces of  Naples  and  Sicily  had all along Mints of their own  Whether it may not be presumed that our not haying a Privilege which every other Kingdom in the World enjoys be not owing to our own want of Diligence and Unanimity in soliciting for it  Whether it be not the Interest of  England  that we should cultivate a domestic Commerce among ourselves And whether it could give them any possible Jealousy if our small Sum of Cash was contrived to go a little further if there was a little more Life in our Markets a little more buying and selling in our Shops a little better Provision for the Backs and Bellies of so many forlorn

the Faculties put into Act or in other Words the united Action of a whole People doth not constitute the  Momentum  of a State  Whether such  Momentum  be not the real Stock or Wealth of a State and whether its Credit be not proportionable thereunto  Whether in every wise State the Faculties of the Mind are not most considered  Whether the  Momentum  of a State doth not imply the whole Exertion of its Faculties intellectual and corporeal and whether the latter without the former could act in concert  Whether the divided Force of Men acting singly would not be a Rope of Sand  Whether the particular Motions of the Members of a State in opposite Directions will not destroy each other and lessen the  Momentum  of the whole but whether they must not conspire to produce a great Effect  Whether the ready Means to put Spirit into this State to fortify and increase its  Momentum  would not be a national Bank and Plenty of small Cash  Whether that which employs and exerts the Force of a Community deserves not to be well considered and well understood  Whether the immediate Mover the Blood and Spirits be not Money Paper or Metal and whether the Soul or Will of the Community which is

Summer Islands  otherwise called  The Isles of Bermuda  The Harvest truly is great but the Labourers are few  Luke x  First Printed in LONDON A D MDCCXXV  A PROPOSAL FOR The better Supplying of Churches in our foreign Plantations c  ALTHOUGH there are several excellent Persons of the Church of  England  whose good Intentions and Endeavours have not been wanting to propagate the Gospel in foreign Parts who have even combined into Societies for that very Purpose and given great Encouragement not only for  English  Missionaries in the  WestIndies  but also for the Reformed of other Nations led by their Example to propagate Christianity in the  East  It is nevertheless acknowledged that there is at this Day but little Sense of Religion and a most notorious Corruption of Manners in the  English  Colonies settled on the Continent of  America  and the Islands It is also acknowledged that the Gospel hath hitherto made but a very inconsiderable Progress among the neighbouring  Americans  who still continue in much the same Ignorance and Barbarism  in which we found them above a hundred Years ago  I shall therefore venture to submit my Thoughts upon a Point that I have long considered to better Judgments in Hopes that any Expedient will be favourably hearkened to which is proposed for the Remedy of these Evils Now in order to effect this it should seem the natural proper Method to provide in the first Place a constant Supply of worthy Clergymen for the  English  Churches in those Parts and in the second Place a like constant Supply of zealous Missionaries well fitted for propagating Christianity among the Savages  For though the surest Means to reform the Morals and soften the Behaviour of Men be to preach to them the pure uncorrupt Doctrine of the Gospel yet it cannot be denied that the Success of preaching dependeth in good measure on the Character and Skill of the Preacher Forasmuch as Mankind are more apt to copy Characters than to practise Precepts and forasmuch as Argument to attain its full Strength doth not less require the Life of Zeal than the Weight of Reason and the same Doctrine which maketh great Impression when delivered with Decency and Address loseth very much of its Force by passing through aukward or unskilful Hands  Now the Clergy sent over to  America  have proved too many of them very meanly qualified both in Learning and Morals for the Discharge of their Office And indeed little can be expected from the Example or Instruction of those who quit their native Country on no other Motive than that they are not able to procure a Livelihood in it which is known to be often the Case  To this may be imputed the small Care that hath been taken to convert the Negroes of our Plantations  who to the Infamy of  England  and Scandal of the World continue Heathen under Christian Masters and in Christian Countries Which could never be if our Planters were rightly instructed and made sensible that they disappointed their own Baptism by denying it to those who belong to them That it would be of Advantage to their Affairs to have Slaves who should  obey in all Things their Masters according to the Flesh not with Eyeservice as Menpleasers but in Singleness of Heart as fearing God  That Gospel Liberty consists with temporal Servitude and that their Slaves would only become better Slaves by being Christians  And though it be allowed that some of the Clergy in our Colonies have approved themselves Men of Merit it will at the same time be allowed that the most zealous and able Missionary from  England  must find himself but ill qualified for converting the  American  Heathen if we consider the Difference of Language their wild Way of Living and above all the great Jealousy and Prejudice which savage Nations have towards Foreigners or Innovations introduced by them  These Considerations make it evident that a College or Seminary in those Parts is very much wanted and therefore the providing such a Seminary is earnestly proposed and recommended to all those who have it in their Power to contribute to so good a Work By this two Ends would be obtained  First the Youth of our  English  Plantations might be themselves fitted for the Ministry and Men of Merit would be then glad to fill the Churches of their native Country which are now a Drain for the very Dregs and Refuse of ours  At present there are I am told many Churches vacant in our Plantations and many very ill supplied  nor can all the Vigilance and Wisdom of that great Prelate whose peculiar Care it is prevent this so long as the aforesaid Churches are supplied from  England  And supplied they must be with such as can be picked up in  England  or  Ireland  until a Nursery of Learning for the Education of the Natives is founded This indeed might provide a constant Succession of learned and exemplary Pastors and what Effect this must be supposed to have on their Flocks I need not say  Secondly the Children of savage  Americans  brought up in such a Seminary and well instructed in Religion and Learning might make the ablest and properest Missionaries for spreading the Gospel among their Countrymen who would be less apt to suspect and readier to embrace a Doctrine recommended by Neighbours or Relations Men of their own Blood and Language than if it were proposed by Foreigners who would not improbably be thought to have Designs on the Liberty or Property of their Converts  The young  Americans  necessary for this Purpose may in the Beginning be procured either by peaceable Methods from those savage Nations which border on our Colonies and are in Friendship with us or by taking captive the Children of our Enemies  It is proposed to admit into the aforesaid College only such Savages as are under ten Years of Age before evil Habits have taken a deep root and yet not so early as to prevent retaining their Mother Tongue which should be preserved by Intercourse among themselves  It is further proposed to ground these young  Americans  thoroughly in Religion and Morality and to give them a good Tincture of other Learning  particularly of Eloquence History and practical Mathematicks to which it may not be improper to add some Skill in Physic  If there were a yearly Supply of ten or a dozen such Missionaries sent abroad into their respective Countries after they had received the Degree of Master of Arts in the aforesaid College and Holy Orders in  England  till such Time as Episcopacy be established in those Parts it is hardly to be doubted but in a little time the World would see good and great Effects thereof  For to any considering Man the employing  American  Missionaries for the Conversion of  America  will of all others appear the most likely Method to succeed especially if care be taken that during the whole Course of their Education an Eye should be had to their Mission that they should be taught betimes to consider themselves as trained up in that sole View without any other Prospect of Provision or Employment that a Zeal for Religion and Love of their Country should be early and constantly instilled into their Minds by repeated Lectures and Admonitions that they should not only be incited by the common Topics of Religion and Nature but farther animated and inflamed by the great Examples in past Ages of public Spirit and Virtue to rescue their Countrymen from their savage Manners to a Life of Civility and Religion  If his Majesty would graciously please to grant a Charter for a College to be erected in a proper Place for these Uses it is to be hoped a Fund may be soon raised by the Contribution of well disposed Persons sufficient for building and endowing the same For as the necessary Expence would be small so there are Men of Religion and Humanity in  England  who would be pleased to see any Design  set forward for the Glory of God and the Good of Mankind  A small Expence would suffice to subsist and educate the  American  Missionaries in a plain simple Manner such as might make it easy for them to return to the coarse and poor Methods of Life in use among their Countrymen and nothing can contribute more to lessen this Expence than a judicious Choice of the Situation where the Seminary is to stand  Many Things ought to be considered in the Choice of a Situation It should be in a good Air in a Place where Provisions are cheap and plenty where an Intercourse might easily be kept up with all Parts of  America  and the Islands in a Place of Security not exposed to the Insults of Pirates Savages or other Enemies where there is no great Trade which might tempt the Readers or Fellows of the College to become Merchants to the Neglect of their proper Business where there are neither Riches nor Luxury to divert or lessen their Application or to make them uneasy and dissatisfied with a homely frugal Subsistence lastly where the Inhabitants if such a Place may be found are noted for Innocence and Simplicity of Manners I need not say of how great Importance this Point would be toward forming the Morals of young Students and what mighty Influence it must have on the Mission  It is evident the College long since projected in  Barbadoes  would be defective in many of these Particulars for though it may have its Use among the Inhabitants yet a Place of so high Trade so much Wealth and Luxury and such dissolute Morals not to mention the great Price and Scarcity of Provisions must at first Sight seem a very improper Situation for a general Seminary intended  for the forming Missionaries and educating Youth in Religion and Sobriety of Manners The same Objections lie against the neighbouring Islands  And if we consider the Accounts given of their Avarice and Licentiousness their Coldness in the Practice of Religion and their Aversion from propagating it which appears in the withholding their Slaves from Baptism it is to be feared that the Inhabitants in the populous Parts of our Plantations on the Continent are not much fitter than those in the Islands abovementioned to influence or assist such a Design And as to the more remote and less frequented Parts the Difficulty of being supplied with Necessaries the Danger of being exposed to the Inroads of Savages and above all the Want of Intercourse with other Places render them improper Situations for a Seminary of Religion and Learning  It will not be amiss to insert here an Observation I remember to have seen in an Abstract of the Proceedings  c  annexed to the Dean of  Canterbury  's Sermon before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in foreign Parts that the savage  Indians  who live on the Continent will not suffer their Children to learn  English  or  Dutch  lest they should be debauched by conversing with their  European  Neighbours which is a melancholy but strong Confirmation of the Truth of what hath been now advanced  A general Intercourse and Correspondence with all the  English  Colonies both on the Islands and the Continent and with other Parts of  America  hath been before laid down as a necessary Circumstance the Reason whereof is very evident But this Circumstance is hardly to be found For on the Continent where there are neither Inns nor Carriages nor Bridges over the Rivers there is  no travelling by Land between distant Places And the  English  Settlements are reputed to extend along the Seacoast for the Space of fifteen hundred Miles It is therefore plain there can be no convenient Communication between them otherwise than by Sea no Advantage therefore in this Point can be gained by settling on the Continent  There is another Consideration which equally regards the Continent and Islands that the general Course of Trade and Correspondence lies from all those Colonies to  GreatBritain  alone Whereas for our present Purpose it would be necessary to pitch upon a Place if such could be found which maintains a constant Intercourse with all the other Colonies and whose Commerce lies chiefly or altogether not in  Europe  but in  America  There is but one Spot that I can find to which this Circumstance agrees and that is the Isles of  Bermuda  otherwise called  The Summer Islands  These having no rich Commodity or Manufacture such as Sugar Tobacco or the like wherewithal to trade to  England  are obliged to become Carriers for  America  as the  Dutch  are for  Europe  The  Bermudans  are excellent Shipwrights and Sailors and have a great Number of very good Sloops which are always passing and repassing from all Parts of  America  They drive a constant Trade to the Islands of  Jamaica Barbadoes Antego  c with Butter Onions Cabbages and other Roots and Vegetables which they have in great Plenty and Perfection They have also some small Manufactures of Joiners Work and Matting which they export to the Plantations on the Continent Hence  Bermudan  Sloops are oftner seen in the Ports of  America  than any other And indeed by the best Information I could get it appears they are the  only People of all the  British  Plantations who hold a general Correspondence with the rest  And as the Commerce of  Bermuda  renders it a very fit Place wherein to erect a Seminary so likewise doth its Situation it being placed between our Plantations on the Continent and those in the Isles so as equally to respect both To which may be added that it lies in the Way of Vessels passing from  America  to  GreatBritain  all which makes it plain that the Youth to be educated in a Seminary placed in the  Summer Islands  would have frequent Opportunities of going thither and corresponding with their Friends It must indeed be owned that some will be obliged to go a long Way to any one Place which we suppose resorted to from all Parts of our Plantations but if we were to look out a Spot the nearest approaching to an equal Distance from all the rest I believe it would be found to be  Bermuda  It remains that we see whether it enjoys the other Qualities or Conditions laid down as well as this  The Summer Islands  are situated near the Latitude of thirty three Degrees no Part of the World enjoys a purer Air or a more temperate Climate the great Ocean which environs them at once moderating the Heat of the South Winds and the Severity of the NorthWest Such a Latitude on the Continent might be thought too hot but the Air in  Bermuda  is perpetually fanned and kept cool by Seabreezes which render the Weather the most healthy and delightful that could be wished being as is affirmed by Persons who have long lived there of one equal Tenour almost throughout the whole Year like the latter End of a fine  May  insomuch that it is resorted to as the  Montpellier  of  America  Nor are these Isles if we may believe the Accounts given of them less remarkable for Plenty  than for Health there being besides Beef Mutton and Fowl great Abundance of Fruits and Gardenstuff of all Kinds in Perfection To this if we add the great Plenty and Variety of Fish which is every Day taken on their Coasts it would seem that a Seminary could no where be supplied with better Provisions or cheaper than here  About forty Years ago upon cutting down many tall Cedars that sheltered their Orangetrees from the NorthWest Wind which sometimes blows even there so as to affect that delicate Plant great Part of their Orange Plantations suffered but other Cedars are since grown up and no doubt a little Industry would again produce as great Plenty of Oranges as ever was there heretofore I mention this because some have inferred from the present Scarcity of that Fruit for which  Bermuda  was once so famous that there hath been a change in the Soil and Climate for the worse But this as hath been observed proceeded from another Cause which is now in great measure taken away  Bermuda  is a Cluster of small Islands which lie in a very narrow Compass containing in all not quite twenty thousand Acres This Groupe of Isles is to use Mr  Waller  's Expression walled round with Rocks which render them inaccessible to Pirates or Enemies there being but two narrow Entrances both well guarded by Forts It would therefore be impossible to find any where a more secure Retreat for Students  The Trade of  Bermuda  consists only in Gardenstuff and some poor Manufactures principally of Cedar and the Palmettoleaf  Bermuda  Hats are worn by our Ladies They are made of a Sort of Mat or as they call it Platting made of the Palmettoleaf which is the only Commodity that I can find exported from  Bermuda  to  GreatBritain  and as there is no Prospect of making a Fortune by this small Trade so it cannot be supposed to tempt the Fellows of the College to engage in it to the Neglect of their peculiar Business which might possibly be the Case elsewhere  Such as their Trade is such is their Wealth the Inhabitants being much poorer than the other Colonies who do not fail to despise them upon that Account But if they have less Wealth they have withal less Vice and expensive Folly than their Neighbours They are represented as a contented plain innocent Sort of People free from Avarice and Luxury as well as the other Corruptions that attend those Vices  I am also informed that they are more constant Attendants on divine Service more kind and respectful to their Pastor when they have one and shew much more Humanity to their Slaves and Charity to one another than is observed among the  English  in the other Plantations One Reason of this may be that condemned Criminals being employed in the Manufactures of Sugar and Tobacco were never transported thither But whatever be the Cause the Facts are attested by a Clergyman of good Credit who lived long among them  Among a People of this Character and in a Situation thus circumstantiated it would seem that a Seminary of Religion and Learning might very fitly be placed The Correspondence with other Parts of  America  the Goodness of the Air the Plenty and Security of the Place the Frugality and Innocence of the Inhabitants all conspiring to favour such a Design Thus much at least is evident that young Students would be there less liable to be corrupted in their Morals and the governing Part would be easier and better contented with a  small Stipend and a retired academical Life in a Corner from whence Avarice and Luxury are excluded than they can be supposed to be in the midst of a full Trade and great Riches attended with all that high Living and Parade which our Planters affect and which as well as all fashionable Vices should be far removed from the Eyes of the young  American  Missionaries who are to lead a Life of Poverty and Selfdenial among their Countrymen  After all it must be acknowledged that though every Thing else should concur with our Wishes yet if a Set of good Governors and Teachers be wanting who are acquainted with the Methods of Education and have the Zeal and Ability requisite for carrying on a Design of this Nature it would certainly come to nothing  An Institution of this Kind should be set on Foot by Men of Prudence Spirit and Zeal as well as competent Learning who should be led to it by other Motives than the Necessity of picking up a Maintenance For upon this View what Man of Merit can be supposed to quit his native Country and take up with a poor College Subsistence in another Part of the World where there are so many considerable Parishes actually void and so many others ill supplied for want of fitting Incumbents Is it likely that Fellowships of fifty or sixty Pounds a Year should tempt abler or worthier Men than Benefices of many Times their Value  And except able and worthy Men do first engage in this Affair with a Resolution to exert themselves in forming the Manners of the Youth and giving them a proper Education it is evident the Mission and the College will be but in a very bad Way This Inconvenience seems the most difficult to provide  against and if not provided against it will be the most likely to obstruct any Design of this Nature So true it is that where Ignorance or ill Manners once take place in a Seminary they are sure to be handed down in a Succession of illiterate or worthless Men  But this Apprehension which seems so well grounded that a College in any Part of  America  would either lie unprovided or be worse provided than their Churches are hath no Place in  Bermuda  there being at this Time several Gentlemen in all Respects very well qualified and in Possession of good Preferments and fair Prospects at home who having seriously considered the great Benefit that may arise to the Church and to Mankind from such an Undertaking are ready to engage in it and to dedicate the Remainder of their Lives to the instructing the Youth of  America  and prosecuting their own Studies upon a very moderate Subsistence in a Retirement so sweet and so secure and every way so well fitted for a Place of Education and Study as  Bermuda  Thus much the Writer hereof thought himself obliged to say of his Associates For himself he can only say that as he values no Preferment upon Earth so much as that of being employed in the Execution of this Design so he hopes to make up for other Defects by the Sincerity of his Endeavours  In  Europe  the Protestant Religion hath of late Years considerably lost ground and  America  seems the likeliest Place wherein to make up for what hath been lost in  Europe  provided the proper Methods are taken Otherwise the  Spanish  Missionaries in the South and the  French  in the North are making such a Progress as may one Day spread the Religion of  Rome  and with it the usual  Hatred to Protestants throughout all the savage Nations in  America  which would probably end in the utter Extirpation of our Colonies on the Safety whereof depends so much of the Nation's Wealth and so considerable a Branch of his Majesty's Revenue  But if this Scheme were pursued it would in all probability have much greater Influence on the  Americans  than the utmost Endeavours of Popish Emissaries can possibly have who from the Difference of Country Language and Interest must lie under far greater Difficulties and Discouragements than those whom we suppose yearly sent out from  Bermuda  to preach among their Countrymen  It cannot indeed be denied that the great Number of poor Regulars inured to hard Living and brought up in an implicit Obedience to their Superiors hath hitherto given the Church of  Rome  in regard to her Missions great Advantage over the Reformed Churches But from what hath been said it is I think evident that this Advantage may be overbalanced by our employing  American  Missionaries  Nor is the Honour of the Crown Nation and Church of  England  unconcerned in this Scheme which it is to be hoped will remove the Reproach we have so long lain under that we fall as far short of our Neighbours of the  Romish  Communion in Zeal for propagating Religion as we surpass them in the Soundness and Purity of it And at the same time that the doing what may be so easily done takes away our Reproach it will cast no small Lustre on his Majesty's Reign and derive a Blessing from Heaven on his Administration and those who live under the Influence thereof  Men of narrow Minds have a peculiar Talent at Objection being never at a loss for something to say against whatsoever is not of their own proposing And perhaps it will be said in Opposition to this Proposal that if we thought ourselves capable of gaining Converts to the Church we ought to begin with Infidels Papists and Dissenters of all Denominations at home and to make Proselytes of these before we think of Foreigners and that therefore our Scheme is against Duty And further that considering the great Opposition which is found on the Part of those who differ from us at home no Success can be expected among Savages abroad and that therefore it is against Reason and Experience  In answer to this I say that Religion like Light is imparted without being diminished That whatever is done abroad can be no Hindrance or Lett to the Conversion of Infidels or others at home That those who engage in this Affair imagine they will not be missed where there is no want of Schools or Clergy but that they may be of singular Service in Countries but thinly supplied with either or altogether deprived of both That our Colonies being of the same Blood Language and Religion with ourselves are in effect our Countrymen But that Christian Charity not being limited by those Regards doth extend to all Mankind And this may serve for an Answer to the first Point that our Design is against Duty  To the second Point I answer That Ignorance is not so incurable as Error that you must pull down as well as build erase as well as imprint in order to make Proselytes at home Whereas the savage  Americans  if they are in a State purely natural and unimproved by Education they are also unincumbred with all that Rubbish of Superstition  and Prejudice which is the Effect of a wrong one As they are less instructed they are withal less conceited and more teachable And not being violently attached to any false System of their own are so much the fitter to receive that which is true Hence it is evident that Success abroad ought not to be measured by that which we observe at home and that the Inference which was made from the Difficulty of the one to the Impossibility of the other is altogether groundless  It hath more the Appearance of Reason to object what will possibly be objected by some that this Scheme hath been already tried to no Purpose several  Indians  having returned to their savage Manners after they had been taught to write and read and instructed in the Christian Religion a clear Proof that their natural Stupidity is not to be overcome by Education  In answer to this I say that the Scheme now proposed hath never been tried forasmuch as a thorough Education in Religion and Morality in divine and human Learning doth not appear to have been ever given to any savage  American  That much is to be hoped from a Man ripe in Years and well grounded in Religion and useful Knowledge while little or nothing can be expected from a Youth but slightly instructed in the Elements of either That from the Miscarriage or gross Stupidity of some a general Incapacity of all  Americans  cannot be fairly inferred That they shew as much natural Sense as other uncultivated Nations That the Empires of  Mexico  and  Peru  were evident Proofs of their Capacity in which there appeared a Reach of Politics and a Degree of Art and Politeness which no  European  People were ever known to have arrived at without the Use of Letters or of  Iron and which some perhaps have fallen short of with both those Advantages  To what hath been said it may not be improper to add that young  Americans  educated in an Island at some Distance from their own Country will more easily be kept under Discipline till they have attained a compleat Education than on the Continent where they might find Opportunities of running away to their Countrymen and returning to their brutal Customs before they were thoroughly imbued with good Principles and Habits  It must nevertheless be acknowledged a difficult Attempt to plant Religion among the  Americans  so long as they continue their wild and roving Life He who is obliged to hunt for his daily Food will have little Curiosity or Leisure to receive Instruction It would seem therefore the right Way to introduce Religion and civil Life at the same Time into that Part of the World either Attempt will assist and promote the other Those therefore of the young Savages who upon Trial are found less likely to improve by academical Studies may be taught Agriculture or the most necessary Trades And when Husbandmen Weavers Carpenters and the like have planted those useful Arts among their savage Countrymen and taught them to live in settled Habitations to canton out their Land and till it to provide vegetable Food of all Kinds to preserve Flocks and Herds of Cattle to make convenient Houses and to clothe themselves decently This will assist the spreading the Gospel among them this will dispose them to social Virtues and enable them to see and to feel the Advantages of a religious and civil Education  And that this View of propagating the Gospel and civil Life among the savage Nations of  America  was a principal Motive which induced the Crown to send the first  English  Colonies thither doth appear from the Charter granted by King  James  I to the Adventurers in  Virginia See  Purchas'  s Pilgrims Vol b  I  c  And it is now but just what might then seem charitable that these poor Creatures should receive some Advantage with respect to their spiritual Interests from those who have so much improved their temporal by settling among them  It is most true notwithstanding our present Corruptions that there are to be found in no Country under the Sun Men of better Inclinations or greater Abilities for doing Good than in  England  But it is as true that Success in many Cases depends not upon Zeal Industry Wealth Learning or the like Faculties so much as on the Method wherein these are applied We often see a small Proportion of Labour and Expence in one Way bring that about which in others a much greater Share of both could never effect It hath been my Endeavour to discover this Way or Method in the present Case What hath been done I submit to the Judgment of all good and reasonable Men who I am persuaded will never reject or discourage a Proposal of this Nature on the Score of slight Objections Surmises or Difficulties and thereby render themselves chargeable with the having prevented those good Effects which might otherwise have been produced by it  For it is after all possible that unforeseen Difficulties may arise in the Prosecution of this Design many Things may retard and many Things may threaten to obstruct it but there is hardly any Enterprise or Scheme whatsoever for the public Good in which Difficulties are not often shewing themselves and as often overcome by the  Blessing of God upon the Prudence and Resolution of the Undertakers though for ought that appears the present Scheme is as likely to succeed and attended with as few Difficulties as any of this Kind can possibly be  For to any Man who considers the divine Power of Religion the innate Force of Reason and Virtue and the mighty Effects often wrought by the constant regular Operation even of a weak and small Cause it will seem natural and reasonable to suppose that Rivulets perpetually issuing forth from a Fountain or Reservoir of Learning and Religion and streaming through all Parts of  America  must in due time have a great Effect in purging away the ill Manners and Irreligion of our Colonies as well as the Blindness and Barbarity of the Nations round them Especially if the Reservoir be in a clean and private Place where its Waters out of the Way of any Thing that may corrupt them remain clear and pure otherwise they are more likely to pollute than purify the Places through which they flow  The Greatness of a Benefaction is rather in Proportion to the Number and Want of the Receivers than to the Liberality of the Giver A wise and good Man would therefore be frugal in the Management of his Charity that is contrive it so as that it might extend to the greatest Wants of the greatest Number of his Fellowcreatures Now the greatest Wants are spiritual Wants and by all Accounts these are no where greater than in our western Plantations in many Parts whereof divine Service is never performed for want of Clergymen in others after such a Manner and by such Hands as scandalize even the worst of their own Parishioners where many  English  instead of gaining Converts are themselves degenerated into Heathens being  Members of no Church without Morals without Faith without Baptism There can be therefore in no Part of the Christian World a greater Want of spiritual Things than in our Plantations  And on the other hand no Part of the Gentile World are so inhuman and barbarous as the savage  Americans  whose chief Employment and Delight consisting in Cruelty and Revenge their Lives must of all others be most opposite as well to the Light of Nature as to the Spirit of the Gospel Now to reclaim these poor Wretches to prevent the many Torments and cruel Deaths which they daily inflict on each other to contribute in any sort to put a Stop to the numberless horrid Crimes which they commit without Remorse and instead thereof to introduce the Practice of Virtue and Piety must surely be a Work in the highest Degree becoming every sincere and charitable Christian  Those who wish well to Religion and Mankind will need no other Motive to forward an Undertaking calculated for the Service of both I shall nevertheless beg leave to observe that whoever would be glad to cover a Multitude of Sins by an extensive and welljudged Charity or whoever from an excellent and Godlike Temper of Mind seeks Opportunities of doing Good in his Generation will be pleased to meet with a Scheme that so peculiarly puts it in his Power with small Trouble or Expence to procure a great and lasting Benefit to the World  Ten Pounds a Year would if I mistake not be sufficient to defray the Expence of a young  American  in the College of  Bermuda  as to Diet Lodging Clothes Books and Education And if so the Interest of two hundred Pounds may be a perpetual  Fund for maintaining one Missionary at the College for ever and in this Succession many it is to be hoped may become powerful Instruments for converting to Christianity and civil Life whole Nations who now sit in Darkness and the Shadow of Death and whose cruel brutal Manners are a Disgrace to human Nature  A Benefaction of this Kind seems to enlarge the very Being of a Man extending it to distant Places and to future Times inasmuch as unseen Countries and after Ages may feel the Effects of his Bounty while he himself reaps the Reward in the blessed Society of all those who  having turned many to Righteousness shine as the Stars for ever end ever  P S  SINCE the foregoing Proposal was first made public His MAJESTY hath been graciously pleased to grant a Charter for erecting a College by the Name of St PAUL'S College in  Bermuda  for the Uses abovementioned Which College is to contain a President and nine Fellows The first President appointed by Charter is GEORGE BERKELEY D D and Dean of  Derry  The three Fellows named in the Charter are WILLIAM THOMPSON JONATHAN ROGERS and JAMES KING Masters of Arts and Fellows of  Trinity  College near  Dublin  The Nomination of a President is reserved to the Crown The Election of

MAJESTY'S Principal Secretaries of State for the Time Being as hath  America  in his Province is appointed Chancellor of the said College The President and Fellows have the Power of making Statutes to be approved by the Visitor They have also the Power of conferring Degrees in all Faculties They are obliged to maintain and educate  Indian  Scholars at the rate of ten Pound  per Annum  for each They are obliged to transmit annual Accounts of the State of the College Number of Students their Progress  c  to the Chancellor and Visitor The aforesaid President and Fellows are licensed to hold their Preferments in these Kingdoms till one Year and a half be expired after their Arrival in  Bermuda  This Society is incorporated with the usual Clauses hath Power to receive Benefactions purchase Lands

THE  Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts  AT THEIR ANNIVERSARY MEETING IN THE ParishChurch of St  MaryleBow  On FRIDAY  February    First Printed in  London  A D MDCCXXXII  February  At the Anniversary Meeting of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts  AGREED That the Thanks of the SOCIETY be given to the Reverend Mr Dean  Berkeley  for his Sermon preached this Day before the SOCIETY and that He be desired to print the same  David Humphreys  Secretary  JOHN xvii  This is Life Eternal that they may know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent  THAT human Kind were not designed meerly to sojourn a few Days upon this Earth that a Being of such Excellence as the Soul of Man so capable of a nobler Life and having such a high Sense of Things moral and intellectual was not created in the sole View of being imprisoned in an earthly Tabernacle and partaking a few Pains and Pleasures which checker this mortal Life without aspiring to any Thing either above or beyond it is a fundamental Doctrine as well of natural Religion as of the Christian It comes at once recommended by the Authority of Philosophers and Evangelists And that there actually is in the Mind of Man a strong Instinct and Desire an Appetite and Tendency towards another and a better State incomparably superior to the present both in point of Happiness and Duration is no more than every one's Experience and inward Feeling may inform him The Satiety and Disrelish attending sensual Enjoyments the Relish for Things of a more pure and spiritual Kind the restless Motion of the Mind from one terrene Object or Pursuit to another and often a Flight or Endeavour above them all towards something unknown and perfective of its Nature are so many Signs and Tokens of this better State which in the Stile of the Gospel is termed Life Eternal  And as this is the greatest Good that can befal us the very End of our Being and that alone which can crown and satisfy our Wishes and without which we shall be ever restless and uneasy so every Man who knows and acts up to his true Interest must make it his principal Care and Study to obtain it And in order to this he must endeavour to live suitably to his Calling and of consequence endeavour to make others obtain it too For how can a Christian shew himself worthy of his Calling otherwise than by performing the Duties of it And what Christian Duty is more essentially so than that of Charity And what Object can be found upon Earth more deserving our Charity than the Souls of Men Or how is it possible for the most beneficent Spirit to do them better Service than by promoting their best and most lasting Interest that is by putting them in the Way that leads to eternal Life  What this eternal Life was or how to come at it were Points unknown to the Heathen World It must be owned the wise Men of old who followed the Light of Nature saw even by that Light that the Soul of Man was debased and borne downwards contrary to its natural Bent by carnal and terrene Objects and that on the other hand it was exalted purged and in some sort assimulated to the Deity by the Contemplation of Truth and Practice of Virtue Thus much in general they saw or surmised But then about the Way and Means to know the one or perform the other they were much at a loss They were not agreed concerning the true End of Mankind which as they saw was mistaken in the vulgar Pursuits of Men so they found it much more eafy to consute the Errors of others than to ascertain the Truth themselves Hence so many Divisions and Disputes  about a Point which it most imported them to know insomuch as it was to give the Bias to human Life and govern the whole Tenor of their Actions and Conduct  But when Life and Immortality were brought to Light by the Gospel there could remain no Dispute about the chief End and Felicity of Man no more than there could about the Means of obtaining it after the express Declaration of our blessed Lord in the Words of my Text  This is Life eternal that they may know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent  For the right Understanding of which Words we must observe that by the Knowledge of God is not meant a barren Speculation either of Philosophers or Scholastic Divines nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce Disputes and Dissensions among Men but on the contrary an holy practical Knowledge which is the Source the Root or Principle of Peace and Union of Faith Hope Charity and universal Obedience A Man may frame the most accurate Notions and in one Sense attain the exactest Knowledge of God and Christ that human Faculties can reach and yet notwithstanding all this be far from knowing them in that saving Sense For St  John  tells us that  John iii  whosoever sinneth hath not seen Christ nor known him  And again  John iv  He that loveth not knoweth not God  To know God as we ought we must love him and love him so as withal to love our Brethren his Creatures and his Children I say that Knowledge of God and Christ which is Life eternal implies universal Charity with all the Duties ingrafted thereon or ensuing from thence that is to say the Love of God and Man And our Lord expresly saith  John xiv  He that hath my Commandments  and keepeth them he it is that loveth me  From all which it is evident that this saving Knowledge of God is inseparable from the Knowledge and Practice of his Will the explicit Declaration whereof and of the Means to perform it are contained in the Gospel that divine Instrument of Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men The Metaphysical Knowledge of God considered in his absolute Nature or Essence is one Thing and to know him as he stands related to us as Creator Redeemer and Sanctifier is another The former Kind of Knowledge whatever it amounts to hath been and may be in Gentiles as well as Christians but not the latter which is Life eternal  From what has been said it is a plain Consequence that whoever is a sincere Christian cannot be indifferent about bringing over other Men to the Knowledge of God and Christ but that every one of us who hath any Claim to that Title is indispensably obliged in Duty to God and in Charity to his Neighbour to desire and promote so far as there is Opportunity the Conversion of Heathens and Infidels that so they may become Partakers of Life and Immortality For  this is Life eternal to know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent  In my present Discourse upon which Words I shall  First consider in general the Obligation that Christians lie under of bringing other Men to the Knowledge of the only true God and of Jesus Christ And  Secondly I shall consider it in reference to this laudable Society instituted for the Propagation of the Gospel And under each Head I propose to obviate such Difficulties as may seem to retard and intermix such Remarks  as shall appear proper to forward so good a Work  Now although it be very evident that we can really have neither a just Zeal for the Glory of God nor a beneficent Love of Man without wishing and endeavouring as occasion serves to spread the glad Tidings of Salvation and bring those who are benighted in the Shadow of Death to Life eternal by the Knowledge of the only true God and of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent Yet this Duty plain and undoubted as it seems happens to be too often overlooked even by those whose Attention to other Points would make one think their Neglect of this not an Effect of lukewarm Indifference so much as of certain mistaken Notions and Suppositions Two principal Considerations occur which in this particular seem to have slackened the Industry of some otherwise zealous and serious Christians  One I apprehend to be this that it is surmised the Christian Religion is in a declining State which by many Symptoms seems likely to end either in Popery or a general Infidelity And that of course a prudent Person has nothing to do but to make sure of his own Salvation and to acquiesce in the general Tendency of Things without being at any fruitless Pains to oppose what cannot be prevented to steer against the Stream or resist a Torrent which as it flows gathers Strength and Rapidity and in the End will be sure to overflow and carry before it When a Man of a desponding and foreboding Spirit hath been led by his Observation of the Ways of the World and the prevailing Humour of our Times to think after this Manner he will be inclined to strengthen this his preconceived Opinion as is usual in other the like Cases by Misapplication of holy Scripture For Instance by  those Words of our blessed Saviour  Luke xviii  When the Son of Man cometh shall he find Faith on the Earth  which have been applied to this very Purpose as importing that before the final Judgment Christian Faith should be extinguished upon Earth although these Words do from the Context seem plainly to refer to the Destruction of  Jerusalem  and the obstinate Blindness of the  Jews  who even then when they felt the Hand of God should not acknowledge it or believe the  Roman  Army to be the Instrument of divine Vengeance in the Day of their Visitation by him whom they had injuriously treated rejected and put to Death  But granting the former Sense might be supported by no absurd Hypothesis or no improbable Guess yet shall the Endeavours of Christian Men for propagating the Gospel of Christ be forestalled by any Suppositions or Conjectures whatsoever Admitting I say those Words regard the future Advent of Jesus Christ yet can any one tell how near or how far off that Advent may be Are not the Times and Seasons foreknown only to God And shall we neglect a certain Duty to Day upon an uncertain Surmise of what is to come hereafter This Way of thinking might furnish as strong Reasons against Preaching at home as abroad within as without the Pale of the Church It would be as specious an Argument against the one as the other but in reality can conclude against neither For as we know not when that supposed Time of general Infidelity is to be or whether it will be at all so if it were ever so sure and ever so near it would nevertheless become us to take care that it may not be an Effect of our own particular Indifference and Neglect  But if we take our Notions not from the uncertain Interpretation of a particular Text but from the whole Tenor of the divine Oracles from the express Promise and reiterated Predictions of our blessed Lord and his Apostles we shall believe that  Phil ii  Jesus Christ is highly exalted of God to the End that at his Name every Knee shall bow and every Tongue confess that he is the Lord to the Glory of God the Father  That  Cor xv  he must reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet  That  Mat xxviii  he is with us alway even unto the End of the World  And that the Church of the living God the Pillar and Ground of Truth is so far from being destroyed by human Means  Mat xvi  that the Gates of Hell  all the infernal Powers  shall not prevail against it  Let us therefore banish all such Conceits as may seem to justify our Indolence as may reason us out of all Courage and Vigour in the Race that is set before us let us not I say slacken our own Hands nor enfeeble our own Knees by preconceived Fancies and Suppositions considering that as the Success of all Enterprises in great measure depends on the Spirit of the Undertakers so nothing is more apt to raise a Spirit than Hope nor to depress it than Despondency We ought therefore to shake off every vain Fear in our spiritual Warfare The Number the Presumption and the Abilities of those who take Counsel together against the Lord and against his Anointed should not dishearten but rather excite and encourage us to stand in the Gap  Another Consideration that may possibly withhold divers sincere Believers from contributing their Endeavours for bringing Men to the Knowledge of God and Christ and thereby to eternal Life is the want of Miracles in the present Age Men naturally  cast about for Reasons to countenance the Part they take And as the Gift of Miracles was of mighty Influence and Help to those who were commissioned to spread abroad the Light of the Gospel in its first Promulgation so no Pretence offers itself more naturally to excuse a Man from executing any Purpose than the Want of Authority which in the Opinion of Men cannot be without a just Commission nor this unless distinguished by those proper Means and Powers that have been known to attend it Now with regard to this Defect of Miracles I shall beg leave to make two Observations  First  It is to be observed that if we have not Miracles we have other Advantages which make them less necessary now than in the first spreading of the Gospel Whole Nations have found the Benefit of Christ's Religion it is protected by Princes established and encouraged by Laws supported by Learning and Arts recommended by the Experience of many Ages as well as by the Authority and Example of the wisest it and most knowing Men Certainly if the greatest Part of Mankind are Gentiles or Mahometans it cannot be denied that the most knowing most learned and most improved Nations profess Christianity and that even the Mahometans themselves bear Testimony to the divine Mission of Jesus Christ Whereas therefore in the Beginning a few illiterate Wanderers of the meanest of the People had the Prejudices the Learning and the Power of their own as well as other Nations in one World the whole World to oppose and overcome Those who at this Day engage in the Propagation of the Gospel do it upon Terms in many Respects far more easy and advantageous It is Power against Weakness Civility against Barbarism Knowledge against Ignorance  some or other if not all these Advantages in the present Times attending the Progress of the Christian Religion in whatever Part of the World Men shall attempt to plant it  In the second Place we may reflect that if we have not the Gift of Miracles this is a good Reason why we should exert more strongly those human Means which God hath put in our Power and make our ordinary Faculties whether of the Head or the Hand or the Tongue our Interest our Credit or our Fortune subservient to the great Giver of them and chearfully contribute our humble Mite towards hastening that Time wherein  Psal lxxxvi  all Nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee O Lord and shall glorify thy Name  It is at least a plain Case that the Want of Apostolical Gifts should not be pleaded as a Bar to our doing that which in no Respect either of Difficulty or Danger equals or approaches the Apostolical Office What Pretence can this supply for Mens being quite unconcerned about the Spreading of the Gospel or the Salvation of Souls for Mens forgetting that they are Christians and related to human Kind How can this justify their overlooking Opportunities which lie in their Way their not contributing a small Part of their Fortune towards forwarding a Design wherein they share neither Pains nor Peril the not bestowing on it even the cheap Assistance of their Speech Attention Counsel or Countenance as Occasion offers How unlike is this worldly selfish Indifference to that Account which St  Paul  gives of himself that  Cor x  he sought not his own Profit but the Profit of many that they may be saved  And yet herein he expected the  Corinthians  and the same Reason will hold for us  should be like him for he subjoins  Be ye Followers of me as I also am of Christ  Having considered the Duty in general I come now to treat of it with reference to  America  the peculiar Province of this venerable Society which I suppose well informed of the State and Progress of Religion in that Part of the World by their Correspondencies with the Clergy upon their Mission It may nevertheless be expected that one who had been engaged in a Design upon this very View who hath been upon the Place and resided a considerable Time in one of our Colonies sould have observed somewhat worth reporting It is to be hoped therefore that one Part of my Audience will pardon what the other may perhaps expect while I detain them with the Narrative of a few Things I have observed and such Reflexions as thereupon suggested themselves some Part of which may possibly be found to extend to ether Colonies  RhodeIsland  with a Portion of the adjacent Continent under the same Government is inhabited by an  English  Colony consisting chiefly of Sectaries of many different Denominations who seem to have worn off part of that Prejudice which they inherited from their Ancestors against the national Church of this Land though it must be acknowledged at the same Time that too many of them have worn off a serious Sense of all Religion Several indeed of the better Sort are accustomed to assemble themselves regularly on the Lord's Day for the Performance of divine Worship But most of those who are dispersed throughout this Colony seem to rival some wellbred People of other Countries in a thorough Indifference for all that is sacred being equally careless of outward Worship and of inward Principles whether of Faith or Practice Of the Bulk of them it may certainly  be said that they live without the Sacraments not being so much as baptized And as for their Morals I apprehend there is nothing to be found in them that should tempt others to make an Experiment of their Principles either in Religion or Government But it must be owned the general Behaviour of the Inhabitants in those Towns where Churches and Meetings have been long settled and regularly attended seems so much better as sufficiently to shew the Difference which a solemn regular Worship of God makes between Persons of the same Blood Temper and natural Faculties  The native  Indians  who are said to have been formerly many Thousands within the Compass of this Colony do not at present amount to one Thousand including every Age and Sex And these are either all Servants or Labourers for the  English  who have contributed more to destroy their Bodies by the Use of strong Liquors than by any means to improve their Minds or save their Souls This slow Poison jointly operating with the SmallPox and their Wars but much more destructive than both hath consumed the  Indians  not only in our Colonies but also far and wide upon our Consines And having made Havock of them is now doing the same thing by those who taught them that odious Vice  The Negroes in the Government of  RhodeIsland  are about half as many more than the  Indians  and both together scarce amount to a seventh Part of the whole Colony The Religion of these People as is natural to suppose takes after that of their Masters Some few are baptized several frequent the different Assemblies and far the greater Part none at all An ancient Antipathy to the  Indians  whom it seems our first Planters therein as in certain other Particulars affecting to imitate  Jews  rather  than  Christians  imagined they had a Right to treat on the Foot of  Canaanites  or  Amalekites  together with an irrational Contempt of the Blacks as Creatures of another Species who had no Right to be instruced or admitted to the Sacraments have proved a main Obstacle to the Conversion of these poor People  To this may be added an erroneous Notion that the being baptized is inconsistent with a State of Slavery To undeceive them in this Particular which had too much Weight it seemed a proper Step if the Opinion of his Majesty's Attorney and SolicitorGeneral could be procured This Opinion they charitably sent over signed with their own Hands which was accordingly printed in  RhodeIsland  and dispersed throughout the Plantations I heartily wish it may produce the intended Effect It must be owned our reformed Planters with respect to the Natives and the Slaves might learn from those of the Church of  Rome  how it is their Interest and Duty to behave Both  French  and  Spaniards  have intermarried with  Indians  to the great Strength Security and Increase of their Colonies They take care to instruct both them and their Negroes in the  Popish  Religion to the Reproach of those who profess a better They have also Bishops and Seminaries for Clergy and it is not found that their Colonies are worse Subjects or depend less on their Mother Country on that Account  It should seem that the likeliest Step towards converting the Heathen would be to begin with the  English  Planters whose Influence will for ever be an Obstacle to propagating the Gospel till they have a right Sense of it themselves which would shew them how much it is their Duty to impart it to others The Missionaries employed by this  venerable Society have done and continue to do good Service in bringing those Planters to a serious Sense of Religion which it is hoped will in Time extend to others I speak it knowingly that the Ministers of the Gospel in those Provinces which go by the Name of  NewEngland  sent and supported at the Expence of this Society have by their Sobriety of Manners discreet Behaviour and a competent Degree of useful Knowledge shewn themselves worthy the Choice of those who sent them and particularly in living on a more friendly Foot with their Brethren of the Separation who on their Part were also very much come off from that Narrowness of Spirit which formerly kept them at such an unamicable Distance from us And as there is Reason to apprehend that Part of  America  could not have been thus distinguished and provided with such a Number of proper Persons if one half of them had not been supplied out of the dissenting Seminaries of the Country who in Proportion as they attain to more liberal Improvements of Learning are observed to quit their Prejudice towards an episcopal Church so I verily think it might increase the Number of such useful Men if Provision were made to defray their Charges in coming hither to receive Holy Orders passing and repassing the Ocean and tarrying the necessary Time in  London  requiring an Expence that many are not able to bear It would also be an Encouragement to the Missionaries in general and probably produce good Effects if the Allowance of certain Missionaries were augmented in proportion to the Services they had done and the Time they had spent in their Million These Hints I venture to suggest as not unuseful in an Age wherein all human Encouragements are found more necessary than at the first Propagation of the Gospel But  they are with all due Deference and Respect submitted to the Judgment of this venerable Audience  After all it is hardly to be expected that so long as Infidelity prevails at home the Christian Religion should thrive and flourish in our Colonies abroad Mankind it must be owned left to themselves are so much bewildered and benighted with respect to the Origin of that Evil which they feel and from which they are at a loss about the Means of being freed that the Doctrines of the lapsed State of Man his Reconciliation by Christ and Regeneration by the Spirit may reasonably be hoped to find an easy Admission as bringing with them Light and Comfort into a Mind not hardened by Impenitency nor foreclosed by Pride nor biased by Prejudice But such is the Vanity of Man that no Prejudice operates more powerfully than that in Favour of Fashion and no Fashions are so much followed by our Colonies as those of the Mother Country which they often adopt in their Modes of living to their great Inconvenience without allowing for the Disparity of Circumstance or Climate This same Humour hath made Infidelity as I find it too credibly reported spread in some of our wealthy Plantations uneducated Men being more apt to tread in the Steps of Libertines and Men of Fashion than to model themselves by the Laws and Institutions of their Mother Country or the Lives and Professions of the virtuous and religious Part of it  But this is not all While those abroad are less disposed to receive some at home are perhaps less disposed to propagate the Gospel from the same Cause It is to be feared I say that the prevailing Torrent of Infidelity which staggers the Faith of some may cool the Zeal and damp the  Spirit of others who judging from the Event and Success of those who impugn the Church of Christ may possibly entertain some Scruple or Surmise whether it may not be for the present at least abandoned by Providence and that human Care must ineffectually interpose till it shall please God  yet once more to shake not the Earth only but also the Heavens  This Point hath been touched before but deserves farther Consideration to the End that the peculiar Impiety of a profane Age may not be a Bar to those very Endeavours which itself renders more necessary and calls for more loudly now than ever  Whatever Men may think the Arm of the Lord is not shortened In all this Prevalency of Atheism and Irreligion there is no Advantage gained by the Powers of Darkness either against God or godly Men but only against their own wretched Partisans The Christian Dispensation is a Dispensation of Grace and Favour The Christian Church a Society of Men intitled to this Grace on performing certain Conditions If this Society is diminished as those who remain true Members of it suffer no Loss to themselves so God loseth no Right suffereth no Detriment forgoeth no Good his Grace resisted or unfruitful being no more lost to him than the Light of the Sun shining on desert Places or among People who shut their Eyes  Besides this Excess this unstemmed Torrent of Profaneness may possibly in the Conclusion defeat itself confirm what it meant to extirpate and instead of destroying prove a Means of preserving our Religion the evil Fruits and Effects thereof being so notorious and flagrant and so sensibly felt as in all likelihood to be able to open the Eyes and rouse the Attention of those who may be blind  and deaf to every other Argument and Consideration Or who knows but the Christian Church corrupted by Prosperity is to be restored and purified by Adversity which may prove for ought we can tell as salutary in future as it hath been in past Ages Many insolent and presumptuous Foes have set themselves against the Church of God whole Hook nevertheless may be in their Nostrils and his Bridle in their Lips managing and governing even their Rage and Folly to the fulfilling of his own wise Purposes and who may not fail in the End to deal by them as he did by the King of  Assyria  when he had  Isa x  performed his Work upon  Sion  and upon  Jerusalem  punishing their stout Heart and high Looks  This presumptuous Conqueror was without knowing it a Tool or Instrument in the Hands of that God whom he blasphemed  Isa x  O  Assyrian  the Rod of mine Anger I will send him against an hypocritical Nation and against the People of my Wrath will I give him a Charge to take the Spoil and to take the Prey and to tread them down like the Mire of the Streets Howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his Heart think so but it is in his Heart to destroy and cut off Nations not a few  Thus much at least is evident It is no new Thing that great Enormities should produce great Humiliations and these again noble Virtues which have often recovered both single Men and whole States even in a natural and civil Sense And if the Captivities Distresses and Desolations of the Jewish Church have occasioned their Return to God and reinstated them in his Favour nay if it was actually foretold whenever they lay under the Curse of God at the Mercy of their Enemies  peeled and scattered in a foreign Land that nevertheless upon their calling his Covenant to Mind and returning to him  Deut xxx  The Lord their God would turn their Captivity and have Compassion upon them  I say if Things were so why may we not in Reason hope for something analogous thereto in behalf of the Christian Church It cannot be denied that there was a great Analogy between the Jewish Institutions and the Doctrines of the Gospel for Instance between the Paschal Lamb and the Lamb of God slain from the Foundation of the World between the  Egyptian  Bondage and that of Sin the earthly  Canaan  and the heavenly the fleshly Circumcision and the spiritual In these and many other Particulars the Analogy seems so plain that it can hardly be disputed To be convinced that the Law of  Moses  and the Jewish Oeconomy were Figures and Shadows of the Evangelical we need only look into the Epistle to the  Hebrews  May we not therefore in pursuance of this same Analogy suppose a similar Treatment of the  Jewish  and  Christian  Church  Let us then see on what Terms the former flood with God in order to discover what the latter may reasonably expect The solemn Denunciation to the  Jews  was  Deut xxviii  If thou shall hearken diligently unto the Voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this Day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the Nations of the Earth  But in case of Disobedience it is added among many other Threats and Maledictions  Ver  The Lord shall smite thee with Blasting and with Mildew and thy Heaven that is over thy Head shall be Brass and the Earth that is under thee shall be Iron  And again  Ver  The  Lord shall smite thee with Madness and Blindness and Astonishment of Heart  Have not the People of this Land drawn down upon it by more Ways than one the just Judgments of Heaven Surely we have felt in a Metaphor the first of the forementioned Judgments and the last hath been literally fulfilled upon us Is it not visible that we are less knowing less virtuous less reasonable in Proportion as we are less religious Are we not grown drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity and Presumption and Freethinking and Extravagance of every Kind to a Degree that we may truly be said to be  smitten with Madness and Blindness and Astonishment of Heart  As anciently most unchristian Schisms and Disputes joined with great Corruption of Manners made way for the  Mahometan  in the East and the Papal Dominion in the West even so here at home in the last Century a weak Reliance upon human Politics and Power on the one hand and enthusiastic Rage on the other together with Carnalmindedness on both gave occasion to introduce Atheism and Infidelity If the temporal State and outward Form of the  Jewish  Church was upon their Defection overturned by Invaders in like manner when Christians are no longer governed by the Light of Evangelical Truth when we resist the Spirit of God are we not to expect that  the Heaven above will be as Brass  that the divine Grace will no longer shower down on our obdurate Hearts that our Church and Profession will be blasted by licentious Scorners those Madmen who in Sport  scatter Firebrands Arrows and Death  As all this is no more than we may reasonably suppose will ensue upon our Backsliding so we may with equal Reason hope it will be remedied upon our Return to God  From what hath been said it follows that in order to propagate the Gospel abroad it is necessary we do it at home and extend our Charity to domestic Infidels if we would convert or prevent foreign ones So that a View of the declining State of Religion here at home of those Things that produced this Declension and of the proper Methods to repair it is naturally connected with the Subject of this Discourse I shall therefore beg your Patience while I just mention a few Remarks or Hints too obvious perhaps in themselves to be new or unknown to any present but too little visible in their Effects to make one think they are by all much attended to  Some preferring Points notional or ritual to the Love of God and Man consider the national Church only as it stands opposed to other Christian Societies These generally have a Zeal without Knowledge and the Effects are suitable to the Cause they really hurt what they seem to espouse Others more solicitous about the Discovery of Truth than the Practice of Holiness employ themselves rather to spy out Errors in the Church than enforce its Precepts These it is to be feared postpone the great Interests of Religion to Points of less Concern in any Eyes but their own But surely they would do well to consider that an humble though confused or indistinct Faith in the Bond of Charity and productive of good Works is much more Evangelical than any accurate disputing and conceited Knowledge  A Church which contains the Fundamentals and nothing subversive of those Fundamentals is not to be set at naught by any particular Member because it may not in every Point perhaps correspond with his Ideas no not though he is sure of being in the right Probably there never was  or will be an established Church in this World without visible Marks of Humanity upon it Saint  Paul  supposeth that  Cor iii  on the Foundation of Jesus Christ there will be human Superstructures of Hay and Stubble  Things light and trivial wrong or superstitious which indeed is a natural Consequence of the Weakness and Ignorance of Man But where that living Foundation is rightly laid in the Mind there will not fail to grow and spring from thence those Virtues and Graces which are the genuine Effects and Tokens of true Faith and which are by no means inconsistent with every Error in Theory or every needless Rite in Worship  The Christian Religion was calculated for the Bulk of Mankind and therefore cannot reasonably be supposed to consist in subtle and nice Notions From the Time that Divinity was considered as a Science and human Reason inthroned in the Sanctuary of God the Hearts of its Professors seem to have been less under the Influence of Grace From that Time have grown many unchristian Dissensions and Controversies of Men  Tim vi  knowing nothing but doting about Questions and Strifes of Words whereof cometh Envy Strife Railings evil Surmises perverse Disputings of Men of corrupt Minds and destitute of Truth  Doubtless the making Religion a notional Thing hath been of infinite Disservice And whereas its holy Mysteries are rather to be received with Humility of Faith than defined and measured by the Accuracy of human Reason all Attempts of this Kind however well intended have visibly failed in the Event and instead of reconciling Infidels have by creating Disputes and Heats among the Professors of Christianity given no small Advantage to its Enemies  To conclude if we proportioned our Zeal to the Importance of Things If we could love Men whose Opinions we do not approve If we knew the World more and liked it less If we had a due Sense of the divine Perfection and our own Defects If our chief Study was the Wisdom from above described by St  Paul  And if in order to all this that were done in Places of Education which cannot so well be done out of them I say if these Steps were taken at home while proper Measures are carrying on abroad the one would very much forward or facilitate the other As it is not meant so it must not be understood that foreign Attempts should wait for domestic Success but only that it is to be wished they may cooperate Certainly if a just and rational a genuine and sincere a warm and vigorous Piety animated the MotherCountry the Influence thereof would soon reach our foreign Plantations and extend throughout their Borders We should soon see Religion shine forth with new Lustre and Force to the Conversion of Infidels both at home and abroad and to  Cor x  the casting down Imaginations and every high Thing that exalteth itself against the Knowledge of God and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Christ  To whom with the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST be ascribed all Praise Might Majesty and Dominion now and for ever  DE MOTU SIVE DE Motus Principio Natura ET DE Causa Communicationis Motuum  Diatriba primùm Typis mandata  LONDINI  A

actio diceretur Perseverantia nihil aliud est quam continuatio in eodem modo existendi quae propriè dici actio non potest Caeterùm resistentiam quam experimur in sistendo corpore moto ejus actionem esse fingimus vana specie delusi Revera enim ista resistentia quam sentimus passio est in nobis neque arguit corpus agere sed nos pati constat utique nos idem passuros fuisse sive corpus illud à se moveatur sive ab alio principio impellatur  Actio reactio dicuntur esse in corporibus nee incommodè ad demonstrationes mechanicas Sed cavendum ne propterea supponamus virtutem aliquam realem quae motûs causa sive principium sit esse in iis Etenim voces illae eodem modo intelligendae sunt ac vox  attractio  quemadmodum haec est hypothesis solummodo mathematica non autem qualitas physica idem etiam de illis intelligi debet ob eandem rationem Nam sicut  veritas usus theorematum de mutua corporum attractione in philosophia mechanica stabiles manent utpote unicè fundati in motu corporum sive motus iste causari supponatur per actionem corporum se mutuo attrahentium sive per actionem agentis alicujus à corporibus diversi impellentis moderantis corpora pari ratione quaecunque tradita sunt de

quod motus principium dici possit Hoc ex ipsis ideis nostris perspicuum est Si igitur voce  corpus  significatur id quod concipimus planè constat inde non peti posse principium motus pars scilicet nulla aut attributum illius causa efficiens vera est quae motum producat Vocem autem proferre nihil concipere id demùm indignum esset philosopho  Datur res cogitans activa quam principium motûs esse in nobis experimur Hanc  animam mentem spiritum  dicimus datur etiam res extensa iners impenetrabilis mobilis quae à priori toto coelo differt novumque genus constituit Quantum intersit inter res cogitantes extensas primus omnium deprehendens Anaxagoras vir longè sapientissimus asserebat mentem nihil habere cum corporibus commune id quod constat ex primo libro Aristotelis de anima Ex neotericis idem optimè animadvertit Cartesius Ab eo alii rem satis claram vocibus obscuris impeditam ac difficilem reddiderunt  Ex dictis manifestum est eos qui vim activam actionem motus principium in corporibus revera inesse affirmant sententiam nulla experientia fundatam amplecti eamque terminis obscuris generalibus adstruere nec quid sibi velint satis intelligere E contrario qui mentem esse principium motus volunt sententiam propria experientia munitam proferent hominumque omni aevo doctissimorum suffragiis comprobatam  Primus Anaxagoras  introduxit qui motum inerti materiae imprimeret quam quidem sententiam probat etiam Aristoteles pluribusque confirmat apertè pronuncians primum movens esse immobile indivisibile nullam habens magnitudinem Dicere autem omne motivum esse mobile rectè animadvertit idem esse ac siquis diceret omne aedificativum esse aedificabile physic l Plato insuper in Timaeo tradit machinam hanc corpoream seu mundum visibilem agitari animari à mente quae sensum omnem fugiat Quinetiam hodie philosophi Cartesiani principium motuum naturalium Deum agnoscunt Et Newtonus passim nec obscurè innuit non solummodo motum ab initio à numine profectum esse verum adhuc systema mundanum ab eodem actu moveri Hoc sacris literis consonum est hoc scholasticorum calculo comprobatur Nam etsi peripatetici naturam tradant esse principium motûs quietis interpretantur tamen naturam naturantem esse Deum Intelligunt nimirum corpora omnia systematis hujusce mundani à mente praepotenti juxta certam constantem rationem moveri  Caeterùm qui principium vitale corporibus tribuunt obscurum aliquid rebus parùm conveniens fingunt Quid enim aliud est vitali principio praeditum esse quam vivere aut vivere quam se movere sistere statum suum mutare Philosophi  autem hujus saeculi doctissimi pro principio indubitato ponunt omne corpus perseverare in statu suo vel quietis vel motûs uniformis in directum nisi quatenus aliunde cogitur statum illum mutare è contrario in anima sentimus esse facultatem tam statum suum quam aliarum rerum mutandi id quod propriè dicitur vitale animamque à corporibus longe discriminat  Motum quietem in corporibus recertiores considerant velut duos status existendi in quorum utrovis corpus omne sua natura iners permaneret nulla vi externa urgente Unde colligere licet eandem esse causam motûs quietis quae est existentiae corporum Neque enim quaerenda videtur alia causa existentiae corporis successivae in diversis partibus spatii quam illa unde derivatur existentia ejusdem corporis successiva in diversis partibus temporis De Deo autem optimo maximo rerum omnium conditore conservatore tractare qua ratione res cunctae à summo vero ente pendeant demonstrare quamvis pars sit scientiae humanae praecellentissima spectat tamen potius ad philosophiam primam seu metaphysicam theologiam quam ad philosophiam naturalem quae hodie fere omnis continetur in experimentis mechanicâ Itaque cognitionem de Deo vel supponit philosophia naturalis vel mutuatur ab aliqua scientia superiori Quanquam verissimum sit naturae investigationem scientiis altioribus argumenta egregia ad sapientiam bonitatem potentiam Dei illustrandam probandam undequaque subministrare  Quod haec minus intelligantur in causa est cur nonnulli immerito repudient physicae principia mathematica eo scilicet nomine quod illa causas rerum efficientes non assignant Quum tamen revera ad physicam aut mechanicam spectet regulas solummodo non causas efficientes impulsionum  attractionumve ut verbo dicam motuum leges tradere ex iis vero positis phaenomenôn particularium solutionem non autem causam efficientem assignare  Multum intererit considerasse quid propriè sit principium quo sensu intelligenda sit vox illa apud philosophos Causa quidem vera efficiens conservatrix rerum omnium jure optimo appellatur fons principium earundem Principia vero philosophiae experimentalis propriè dicenda sunt fundamenta quibus illa innititur seu fontes unde derivatur non dico existentia sed cognitio rerum corporearum sensus utique experientia Similiter in philosophia mechanica principia dicenda sunt in quibus fundatur continetur universa disciplina leges illae motuum primariae quae experimentis comprobatae ratiocinio etiam excultae sunt redditae universales Hae motuum leges commodè dicuntur principia quoniam ab iis tam theoremata mechanica generalia quam particulares  explicationes derivantur  Tum nimirum dici potest quidpiam explicari mechanicè cum reducitur ad ista principia simplicissima universalissima per accuratum ratiocinium cum iis consentaneum connexum esse ostenditur Nam inventis semel naturae legibus deinceps monstrandum est philosopho ex constanti harum legum observatione hoc est ex iis principiis phaenomena quodvis necessario consequi id quod est phaenomena explicate solvere causamque id est rationem cur fiant assignare  Mens humana gaudet scientiam suam extendere dilatare Ad hoc autem notiones propositiones generales efformandae sunt in quibus quodam modo continentur propositiones cognitiones particulares quae tum demùm intelligi  reduntur Hoc geometris notissimum est In  mechanica etiam praemittuntur notiones hoc est definitiones et enunciationes de motu primae generales ex quibus postmodùm methodo mathematica conclusiones magis remotae minus generales colliguntur Et sicut per applicationem theorematum geometricorum corporum particularium magnitudines mensurantur ita etiam per applicationem theorematum mechanices universalium systematis mundani partium quarumvis motus phaenomena inde pendentia innotescunt determinantur ad quem scopum unicè collineandum physico  Et quemadmodum geometrae disciplinae causa multa comminiscuntur quae nec ipsi describere possunt nec in rerum natura

Quid quid ultra fingitur id ejusdem generis esse cum aliis hypothesibus abstractionibus mathematicis existimandum quod penitus animo infigere oporter Hoc ni fiat facilè in obscuram scholasticorum subtilitatem quae per tot saecula tanquam dira quaedam pestis philosophiam corrupit relabi possumus  Principia mechanica legesque motuum aut naturae universales saeculo ultimo feliciter inventae  subsidio geometriae tractatae applicatae miram lucem in philosophiam intulerunt Principia vero metaphysica causaeque reales efficientes motus existentiae corporum attributorumve corporeorum nullo modo ad mechanicam aut experimenta pertinent neque eis lucem dare possunt nisi quatenus velut praecognita inserviant ad limites physicae praefiniendos eaque ratione ad tollendas difficultates quaestionesque peregrinas  Qui à spiritibus motus principium petunt ii vel rem corpoream vel incorpoream voce  spirilus  intelligunt si rem corpoream quantumvis tenuem tamen redit difficultas si incorpoream quantumvis id verum sit attamen ad physicam non propriè pertinet Quod si quis philosophiam naturalem ultra limites experimentorum mechanicae extenderit ita ut rerum etiam incorporearum inextensarum cognitionem complectatur latior quidem illa vocis acceptio tractationem de anima mente seu principio vitali admittit Caeterùm commodius erit juxta usum jam ferè receptum ita distinguere inter scientias ut singulae propriis circumscribantur cancellis philosophus naturalis totus sit in experimentis legibusque motuum principiis mechanicis indeque depromptis ratiociniis quidquid autem de aliis rebus protulerit id superiori alicui scientiae acceptum referat Etenim ex cognitis naturae legibus pulcherrimae theoriae praxes etiam mechanicae ad vitam utiles consequuntur Ex cognitione autem ipsius naturae auctoris considerationes longe praestantissimae quidem illae sed metaphysicae theologiae morales oriuntur  De principiis hactenus nunc dicendum de natura motus atque is quidem cum sensibus clare percipiatur non tam natura sua quam doctis philosophorum commentis obscuratus est Motus  nunquam in sensus nostros incurrit sine mole corporea spatio tempore Sunt tamen qui motum tanquam ideam quandam simplicem abstractam atque ab omnibus aliis rebus sejunctam contemplari student Verùm idea illa tenuissima subtilissima intellectûs aciem eludit id quod quilibet secum meditando experiri potest Hinc nascuntur magnae difficultates de natura motus definitiones ipsa re quam illustrare debent longe obscuriores Hujusmodi sunt definitiones illae Aristotelis Scholasticorum qui motum dicunt esse actum  mobilis quatenus est mobile vel actum entis in potentia quatenus in potentia  Hujusmodi etiam est illud viri inter recentiores celebris qui asserit  nihil in motu esse reale praeter momentaneum illud quod in vi ad mutationem nitente constitui debet  Porro constat horum similium definitionum auctores in animo habuisse abstractam motus naturam seclusa omni temporis spatii consideratione explicare sed qua ratione abstracta illa motus quintessentia ut ita dicam intelligi possit non video  Neque hoc contenti ulterius pergunt partesque ipsius motus à se invicem dividunt secernunt quarum ideas distinctas tanquam entium revera distinctorum efformare conantur Etenim sunt qui motionem à motu distinguant illam velut instantaneum motus elementum spectantes Velocitatem insuper conatum vim impetum totidem res essentia diversas esse volunt quarum quaeque per propriam atque ab aliis omnibus segregatam abstractam ideam intellectui objiciatur Sed in hisce rebus discutiendis stantibus iis quae supra disseruimus non est cur diutius immoremur  Multi etiam per  transitum  motu desiniunt obliti scilicet transitum ipsum sine motu intelligi non posse per motum definiri oportere Verissimum adeo est definitiones sicut nonnullis rebus  lucem ita vicissim aliis tenebras afferre Et profecto quascumque res sensu percipimus eas clariores aut notiores definiendo efficere vix quisquam potuerit Cujus rei vana spe allecti res faciles difficillimas reddiderunt philosophi mentesque suas difficultatibus quas ut plurmum ipsi peperissent implicavere Ex hocce definiendi simulac abstrahendi studio maltae tam de motu quam de aliis rebus natae subtilissimae quaestiones eaedemque nullius utilitatis hominum ingenia frustra torserunt adeo ut Aristoteles ultro saepius fateatur motum esse  actum quendam cognitu difficilem  nonnulli ex veteribus usque eo nugis exercitati deveniebant ut motum omnino esse negarent  Sed hujusmodi minutiis distineri piget Satis sit fontes solutionum indicasse ad quos etiam illud adjungere libet quod ea quae de infinita divisione temporis spatii in mathesi traduntur ob congenitam rerum naturam paradoxa theorias spinosas quales sunt illae omnes in quibus agitur de infinito in speculationes de motu intulerunt Quidquid autem hujus generis sit id omne motus commune habet cum spatio tempore vel potius ad ea refert acceptum  Et quemadmodum ex una parte nimia abstractio seu divisio rerum verè inseparabilium ita ab altera parte compositio seu potius confusio rerum diversissimarum motus naturam perplexam reddidit Usitatum enim est motum cum causa motus efficiente confundere Unde accidit ut motus sit quasi biformis unam faciem sensibus obviam alteram caliginosa nocte obvolutam habens Inde obscuritas confusio varia de motu paradoxa originem trahunt dum effectui perperam tribuitur id quod revera causae solummodo competit  Hinc oritur opinio illa eandem semper motus quantitatem conservari quod nisi intelligatur de vi potentia causae sive causa illa dicatur natura sive  vel quodcunque tandem agens sit falsum esse cuivis facile constabit Aristoteles quidem l physicorum ubi quaerit  utrum motus factus sit corruptus an vero ab aeterno tanquam vita immortalis insit rebus omnibus  vitale principium po  ius quam effectum externum sive mutationem loci intellexisse videtur  Hinc etiam est quod multi suspicantur motum non esse meram passionem in corporibus Quod si intelligamus id quod in motu corporis sensibus objicitur quin omnino passivum sit nemo dubitare potest Ecquid enim in se habet successiva corporis existentia in diversis locis quod actionem referat aut aliud sit quam nudus iners effectus  Peripatetici qui dicunt motum esse actum unum utriusque moventis moti non satis discriminant causam ab effectu Similiter qui nisum aut conatum in motu fingunt aut idem corpus simul in contrarias partes ferri putant eâdem idearum confusione eâdem vocum ambiguitate ludificari videntur  Juvat multum sicut in aliis omnibus ita in scientia de motu accuratam diligentiam adhibere tam ad aliorum conceptus intelligendos quam ad suos enunciandos in qua re nisi peccatum esset vix credo in disputationem trahi potuisse utrùm corpus indifferens sit ad motum ad quietem necne Quoniam enim experientia constat esse legem naturae primariam ut corpus perinde perseveret in  statu motus ac quietis quamdiu aliunde nihil accidat ad statum istum mutandum  Et propterea vim inertiae sub diverso respectu esse vel resistentiam vel impetum colligitur Hoc sensu profecto  corpus dici potest sua natura indifferens ad motum vel quietem Nimirum tam difficile est quietem in corpus motum quam motum in quiescens inducere cum vero corpus pariter conservet statum utrumvis quid ni dicatur ad utrumvis se habere indifferenter  Peripatetici pro varietate mutationum quas res aliqua tubire potest varia motus genera distinguebant Hodie de motu agentes intelligunt solummodo motum localem Motus autem localis intelligi nequit nisi simul intelligatur quid sit  locus  is vero à neotericis definitur  pars spatii quam corpus occupat  unde dividitur in relativum absolutum pro ratione spatii Distinguunt enim inter spatium absolutum sive verum ac relativum sive apparens Volunt scilicet dari spatium undequaque immensum immobile insensibile corpora universa permeans continens quod vocant spatium absolutum Spatium autem à corporibus comprehensum vel definitum sensibusque adeo subjectum dicitur spatium relativum apparens vulgare  Fingamus itaque corpora cuncta destrui in nihilum redigi Quod reliquum est vocant spatium absolutum omni relatione quae à situ distantiis corporum oriebatur simul cum ipsis corporibus sublatâ Porro spatium illud est infinitum immobile indivisible insensibile sine relatione sine distinctione Hoc est omnia ejus attributa sunt privativa vel negativa videtur igitur esse merum nihil Parit solummodo difficultatem aliquam quod extensum sit Extensio autem est qualitas positiva Verùm qualis tandem extensio est illa quae nec dividi potest nec mensurari cujus nullam partem nec sensu percipere nec imaginatione depingere possumus Etenim nihil in imaginationem cadit quod ex natura rei non  possibile est ut sensu percipiatur siquidem imaginatio nihil aliud est quam facultas representatrix rerum sensibilium vel actu existentium vel saltem possibilium Fugit insuper intellectum purum quum facultas illa versetur tantum circa res spirituales inextensas cujusmodi sunt mentes nostrae earumque habitus passiones virtutes similia Ex spatio igitur absoluto auferamus modò vocabula nihil remanebit in sensu imaginatione aut intellectu nihil aliud ergo iis designatur quam pura privatio aut negatio hoc est merum nihil  Confitendum omnino est nos circa hanc rem gravissimis praejudiciis teneri à quibus ut liberemur omnis animi vis exerenda Etenim multi tantum abest quod spatium absolutum pro nihilo ducant ut rem esse ex omnibus Deo excepto unicam existiment quae annihilari non possit statuantque illud suapte natura necessariò existere aeternumque esse increatum atque adeo attributorum divinorum particeps Verum enimvero quum certissimum sit res omnes quas nominibus designamus per qualitates aut relationes vel aliqua saltem ex parte cognosci ineptum enim foret vocabulis uti quibus cogniti nihil nihil notionis ideae vel conceptus subjiceretur Inquiramus diligenter utrum formare liceat ideam ullam spatii illius puri realis absoluti post omnium corporum annihilationem perseverantis existere Ideam porro talem paulo acrius intuens reperio ideam esse nihili purissimam si modo idea appellanda sit Hoc ipse summa adhibita diligentia expertus sum hoc alios pari adhibita diligentia experturos reor  Decipere nos nonnunquam solet quod aliis omnibus corporibus imaginatione sublatis nostrum tamen manere supponimus Quo supposito motum membrorum ab omni parte liberrimum imaginamur  Motus autem sine spatio concipi non potest Nihilominus si rem attento animo recolamus constabit primo concipi spatium relativum partibus nostri corporis definitum  o  movendi membra potestatem liberrimam nullo obstaculo retusam praeter haec duo nihil Falso tamen credimus tertium aliquod spatium videlicet immensum realiter existere quod liberam potestatem nobis faciat movendi corpus nostrum ad hoc enim requiritur absentia solummodo aliorum corporum Quam absentiam sive privationem corporum nihil esse positivum fateamur necesse est  Vide quae contra spatium absolutum disseruntur in libro de principiis cognitionis humanae idiomate anglicano decem a  hinc annis edito  Caeterum hasce res nisi quis libero acri examine perspexerit verba voces parum valent Meditanti vero rationes secum reputanti ni fallor manifestum erit quaecunque de spatio puro absoluto praedicantur ea omnia de nihilo praedicari posse Qua ratione mens humana facillimè liberatur à magnis difficultatibus simulque ab ea absurditate tribuendi existentiam necessariam ulli rei praeterquam soli Deo optimo maximo  In proclivi esset sententiam nostram argumentis à posteriori ut loquuntur ductis confirmare quaestiones de spatio absoluto proponendo exempli gratia utrum sit substantia vel accidens Utrum creatum vel increatum absurditates ex utravis parte consequentes demonstrando Sed brevitati consulendum Illud tamen omitti non debet quod sententiam hancce Democritus olim calculo suo comprobavit uti auctor est Aristoteles l phys ubi haec habet  Democritus solidum inane ponit principia quarum aliud quidem ut quod est aliud ut quod non est esse dicit  Scrupulum si forte injiciat quod distinctio illa inter spatium absolutum relativum  à magni nominis philosophis usurpetur eique quasi fundamento inaedificentur multa praeclara theoremata scrupulum istum vanum esse ex iis quae secutura sunt apparebit  Ex praemissis patet non convenire ut definiamus locum verum corporis esse partem spatii absoluti quam occupat corpus motumque verum seu absolutum esse mutationem loci veri absoluti Siquidem omnis locus est relativus ut et omnis motus Veruntamen ut hoc clarius appareat animadvertendum est motum nullum intelligi posse sine determinatione aliqua seu directione quae quidem intelligi nequit nisi praeter corpus motum nostrum etiam corpus aut aliud aliquod simul intelligatur existere Nam sursum deorsum sinistrorsum dextrorsum omnesque plagae regiones in relatione aliqua fundantur necessario corpus à moto diversum connotant supponunt Adeo ut si reliquis corporibus in nihilum redactis globus exempli gratia unicus existere supponatur in illo motus nullus concipi possit usque adeo necesse est ut detur aliud corpus cujus situ motus determinari intelligatur Hujus sententiae veritas clarissime elucebit modo corporum omnium tam nostri quam aliorum praeter globum istum unicum annihilationem recte supposuerimus  Concipiantur porro  globi praeterea nil corporeum existere Concipiantur deinde vires quomodocunque applicari quicquid tandem per applicationem virium intelligamus motus circularis duorum globorum circa commune centrum nequit per imaginationem concipi Supponamus deinde coelum fixarum creari subito ex concepto appullu globorum ad diversas coeli istius partes motus concipietur Scilicet cum motus natura sua sit relativus concipi non potuit priusquam darentur corpora correlata Quemadmodum  nec ulla alia relatio sine correlatis concipi potest  Ad motum circularem quod attinet putant multi crescente motu vero circulari corpus necessario magis semper magisque ab axe niti Hoc antem ex eo provenit quod cum motus circularis spectari possit tanquam in omni momento à duabus directionibus ortum trahens una secundum radium altera secundum tangentem si in hac ultima tantùm directione impetus augeatur tum à centro recedet corpus motum orbita vero desinet esse circularis Quod si aequaliter augeantur vires in utraque directione manebit motus circularis sed acceleratus conatu qui non magis arguet vires recedendi ab axe quam accedendi ad eundem auctas esse Dicendum igitur aquam in situla circumactam ascendere ad latera vasis propterea quod applicatis novis viribus in directione tangentis ad quamvis particulam aquae eodem instanti non applicentur novae vires aequales centripetae Ex quo experimento nullo modo sequitur motum absolutum circularem per vires recedendi ab axe motus necessariò dignosci Porrò qua ratione intelligendae sunt voces istae  vires corporum conatus  ex praemissis satis superque innotescit  Quo modo curva considerari potest tanquam constans ex rectis infinitis etiamsi revera ex illis non constet sed quòd ea hypothesis ad geometriam utilis sit eodem motus circularis spectari potest tanquam à directionibus rectilineis infinitis ortum ducens quae suppositio utilis est in philosophia mechanica Non tamen ideo affirmandum impossibile esie ut centrum gravitatis corporis cujusvis successive existat in singulis punctis peripheriae circularis nulla ratione habita directionis ullius rectilineae sive in tangente sive in radio  Haud omittendum est motum lapidis in fundâ aut aquae in situlâ circumactâ dici non posse motum vere circularem juxta mentem eorum qui per partes spatii absoluti definiunt loca vera corporum cum sit mirè compositus ex motibus non solum situlae vel fundae sed etiam telluris diurno circa proprium axem menstruo circa commune centrum gravitatis terrae lunae annuo circa solem Et propterea particula quaevis lapidis vel aquae describat lineam à circulari longe abhorrentem Neque revera est qui creditur conatus axifugus quoniam non respicit unum aliquem axem ratione spatii absoluti supposito quod detur tale spatium proinde non video quomodo appellari possit conatus unicus cui motus vere circularis tanquam proprio adaequato effectui respondet  Motus nullus dignosci potest aut mensurari nisi per res sensibiles Cum ergo spatium absolutum nullo modo in sensus incurrat necesse est ut inutile prorlus sit ad distinctionem motuum Praeterea determinatio sive directio motui essentialis est ilia vero in relatione consistit Ergo impossibile est ut motus absolutus concipiatur  Poriò quoniam pro diversitate loci relativi varius sit motus ejusdem corporis quinimò uno respectu moveri altero quiescere dici quidpiam possit ad determinandum motum verum quietem veram quo scilicet tollatur ambiguitas consulatur mechanicae philosophorum qui systema rerum latius contemplantur satis fuerit spatium relativum fixarum coelo tanquam quiescente spectato conclusum adhibere loco spatii absoluti Motus autem quies tali spatio relativo definiti commodè adhiberi possunt loco absolutorum qui ab illis nullo symptomate discerni possunt Etenim imprimantur utcunque vires sint quicunque conatus concedamus motum distingui per actiones in  corpora exercitas nunquam tamen inde sequetur dari spatium illud locum absolutum ejusque mutationem esse locum verum  Leges motuum effectusque theoremata eorundem proportiones calculos continentia pro diversis viarum figuris accelerationibus itidem directionibus diversis mediisque plus minusve resistentibus haec omnia constant sine calculatione motus absoluti Uti vel ex eo patet quod quum secundum illorum principia qui motum absolutum inducunt nullo symptomate scire liceat utrum integra rerum compages quiescat an moveatur uniformiter in directum perspicuum sit motum absolutum nullius corporis cognosci psse  Ex dictis patet ad veram motus naturam perspiciendam summopere juvaturum  o  Distinguere inter hypotheses mathematicas naturas rerum  o  Cavere ab abstractionibus  o  Confiderare motum tanquam aliquid sensible vel saltem imaginabile mensurisque relativis esse contentos Quae si fecerimus simul clarissima quaeque philosophiae mechanicae theoremata quibus referantur naturae recessus mundique systema calculis humanis subjicitur manebunt intemerata et motus contemplatio à mille minutiis subtilitatibus ideisque abstractis libera evadet Atque haec de natura motûs dicta sufficiant  Restat ut disseramus de causa communicationis motuum Esse autem vim impressam in corpus mobile causam motus in eo plerique existimant Veruntamen illos non assignare causam motus cognitam à corpore motuque distinctam ex praemissis constat Patet insuper vim non esse rem certam determinatam ex eo quod viri summi de illa multùm diversa immo contraria proferant salva tamen in consequentiis veritate Siquidem Newtonus ait vim impressam consistere in  actione sola esseque actionem exercitam in corpus ad statum ejus mutandum nec post actionem manere Torricellius cumulum quendam sive aggregatum virium impressarum per percussionem in corpus mobile recipi ibidemque manere atque impetum constituere contendit Idem fere Borellus aliique praedicant At vero tametsi inter se pugnare videantur Newtonus Torricellius nihilominus quum dum singuli sibi consentanea proferunt res satis commodè ab utrisque explicatur Quippe vires omnes corporibus attributae tam sunt hypotheses mathematicae quam vires atrtactivae in planetis sole Caeterùm entia mathematica in rerum natura stabilem essentiam non habent pendent autem à notione definientis unde eadem res diversimodè explicari potest  Statuamus motum novum in corpore percusso conservari sive per vim insitam qua corpus quodlibet perseverat in statu suo vel motus vel quietis uniformis in directum sive per vim impressam durante percussione in corpus percussum receptam ibidemque permanentem idem erit quoad rem differentia existente in nominibus tantùm Similiter ubi mobile percutiens perdit percussum acquirit motum parum refert disputate utrum motus acquisitus sit idem numero cum motu perdito ducit enim in minutias metaphysicas prorsus nominales de identitate Itaque sive dicamus motum transire à percutiente in percussum sive in percusso motum de novo generari destrui autem in percutiente res eodem recidit Utrobique intelligitur unum corpus motum perdere alterum acquirere praeterea nihil  Mentem quae agitat continet universam hancce molem corpoream estque causa vera efficiens motus eandem esse propriè strictè loquendo causam communicationis ejusdem haud  negaverim In philosophiâ tamen physicâ causas solutiones phaenomenôn à principiis mechanicis petere oportet Physicè igitur res explicatur non assignando ejus causam verè agentem incorpoream sed demonstrando ejus connexionem cum principiis mechanicis cujusmodi est illud  actionem reactionem esse semper contrarias aequales  à quo tanquam fonte principio primario eruuntur regulae de motuum communicatione quae à neotericis magno scientiarum bono jam ante repertae sunt demonstratae  Nobis satis fuerit si innuamus principium illud alio modo declarari potuisse Nam si vera rerum natura potius quam abstracta mathesis spectetur videbitur rectius dici in attractione vel percussione passionem corporum quam actionem esse utrobique aequalem Exempli gratia lapis fune equo alligatus tantum trahitur versus equum quantum equus versus lapidem corpus etiam motum in aliud quiescens impactum patitur eandem mutationem cum corpore quiescente Et quoad effectum realem percutiens est item percussum percussumque percutiens Mutatio autem illa est utrobique tam in corpore equi quam in lapide tam in moto quam in quiescente passio mera Esse autem vim virtutem aut actionem corpoream talium effectuum verè propriè causatricem non constat Corpus motum in quiescens impingitur loquimur tamen activè dicentes illud hoc impellere nec absurdè in mechanicis ubi ideae mathematicae potius quam verae rerum naturae spectantur  In physica sensus experientia quae ad effectus apparentes solummodo pertingunt locum habent in mechanica notiones abstractae mathematicorum admittuntur In philosophia prima seu metaphysica agitur de rebus incorporeis de causis veritate existentia rerum Physicus series sive  successiones rerum sensibilium contemplatur quibus legibus connectuntur quo ordine quid praecedit tanquam causa quid sequitur tanquam effectus animadvertens Atque hac ratione dicimus corpus motum esse causam motûs in altero vel ei motum imprimere trahere etiam aut impellere Quo sensu causae secundae corporeae intelligi debent nullâ ratione habità verae sedis virium vel potentiarum actricum aut causae realis cui insunt Porro dici possunt causae vel principia mechanica ultra corpus figuram motum etiam axiomata scientiae mechanicae primaria tanquam causae consequentium spectata  Causae verè activae meditatione tantum ratiocinio è tenebris erui quibus involvuntur possunt aliquatenus cognosci Spectat autem ad philosophiam primam seu metaphysicam de iis agere Quod si cuique scientiae provincia sua tribuatur limites assignentur principia objecta accuratè distinguantur quae ad singulas pertinent tractare licuerit majore cum facilitate tum perspicuitate
