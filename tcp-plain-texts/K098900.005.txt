 THE LUCUBRATIONS OF  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  By  W Hn  Esq  Dr  St A Hy  Esq  deceased and several other Hands  VOL V  LONDON  Printed for  John Morphew  near  StationersHall  MDCCXII  TO THE READER  THE following Papers were publish'd and se∣veral of 'em written by a Gentleman now Abroad Many of 'em came from the same Hands which contributed to the other Volumes several of which I fancy will easily distinguish themselves to have been the Pro∣ductions of a Gentleman lately dead one who to the Advan∣tages of a large Estate and good Education had acquir'd Learn∣ing and an exact Knowledge of the best Sort of Men both at  Home and Abroad and with∣al was Master of so much Wit and Humour that there are few People whose Conversations could be more desirable His Friends and the Publick equal∣ly regret his Loss since he was serviceable and agreeable to 'em both in a very eminent De∣gree The rest of these Papers are to live upon what Commen∣dations they can give them∣selves and perhaps may be thought not altogether unwor∣thy of the Honour of serving as a Supplement to the former Volumes  THE N  o  TATLER  BY  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  VOL V  Quis ergo sum Saltem si non sum Sofia Te interrogo  Plaut Amphitruo  Saturday January  'TIS impossible perhaps for the best and wisest amongst us to keep so constant a Guard upon our Temper but that we may at one Time or other lie open to the Strokes of Fortune and such Incidents as we cannot foresee With Sentiments of this Kind I came Home to my Lodgings last Night much fatigued with a long and sudden Journey from the Country and full of the ungrateful Occa∣sion of it 'Twas natural for me to have im∣mediate Recourse to my Pen and Ink but be∣fore I would offer to make Use of them I re∣solv'd deliberately to tell over a Hundred and when I came to the End of that Sum I found it more advisable to defer drawing up my in∣tended Remonstrance till I had slept soundly on my Resentments Without any other Pre∣face  than this I shall give the World a fair Account of the Treatment I have lately met with and leave them to judge whether the Uneasiness I have suffer'd be inconsistent with the Character I have generally pretended to About Three Weeks since I receiv'd an Invita∣tion from a Kinsman in  Staffordshire  to spend my  Christmas  in those Parts Upon taking Leave of Mr  Morphew  I put as many Papers into his Hands as would serve till my Return and charg'd him at parting to be very punctual with the Town In what Manner he and Mr  Lillie  have been tamper'd with since I can∣not say they have given me my Revenge if I desired any by allowing their Names to an idle Paper that in all humane Probability cannot live a Fortnight to an End My self and the Family I was with were in the Midst of Gaie∣ty and a plentiful Entertainment when I re∣ceiv'd a Letter from my Sister  Jenny  who af∣ter mentioning some little Affairs I had intru∣sted to her goes on thus  "The inclos'd I be∣lieve will give you some Surprize as it has al∣ready astonish'd every Body here Who Mr  Steele  is that subscribes it I don't know any more than I can comprehend what could induce him to it  Morphew  and  Lillie  I am told are both in the Secret I shall not presume to instruct you but hope you will use some Means to dis∣appoint the ill Nature of those who are taking Pains to deprive the World of one of its most reasonable Entertainments I am  c  "  I am to thank my Sister for her Compli¦ment but be that as it will I shall not easily be discourag'd from my former Undertaking  In Pursuance of it I was obliged upon this Notice to take Places in the Coach for my self and my Maid with the utmost Expedition lest I should in a short Time be rallied out of my Existence as some People will needs fancy  Mr  Partridge  has been and the real  Isaac Bic∣kerstaff  have passed for a Creature of Mr  Steele  's Imagination This Illusion might have hoped for some tolerable Success if I had not more than once produced my Person in a crowded Theatre and such a Person as Mr  Steele  if I am not misinformed in the Gentleman would hardly think it an Advantage to own though I should throw him in all the little Honour I have gained by my  Lucubrations  I may be al∣lowed perhaps to understand Pleasantry as well as other Men and can in the usual Phrase take a Jest without being angry but I appeal to the World whether the Gentleman has not carried it too far and whether he ought not to make a publick Recantation if the Cre∣dulity of some unthinking People should force me to insist upon it The following Letter is just come to Hand and I think it not improper to be inserted in this Paper  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SIR  I Am extreamly glad to hear you are come to Town for in your Absence we were all mightily surprized with an unaccountable Pa∣per Sign'd  Richard Steele  who is esteem'd by those that know him to be a Man of Wit and Honour and therefore we took it either to be a Counterseit or a perfect  Christmas  Frolick of that ingenious Gentleman But then your Paper ceasing immediately after we were at a Loss what to think If you were weary of the Work you had so long carried on and had given this Mr  Steele  Orders to sig∣nify so to the Publick he should have said it in plain Terms but as that Paper is worded one would be apt to judge that he had a Mind to perswade the Town that there was some Analogy between  Isaac Bickerstaff  and himPossibly  Possibly there may be a Secret in this which I cannot enter into but I flatter my self that you never had any Thoughts of giving over your Labours for the Benefit of Mankind when you cannot but know how many Subjects are yet unexhausted and how many others as being less obvious are wholly untouch'd I dare promise not only for my self but many other abler Friends that we shall still continue to furnish you with Hints on all proper Occa∣sions which is all your Genius requires I think by the Way you cannot in Honour have any more to do with  Morphew  and  Lillie  who have gone beyond the ordinary Pitch of Assu∣rance and transgress'd the very Letter of the Proverb by endeavouring to cheat you of your Christian and Sirname too Wishing you Sir long to live for our Instruction and Diversion and to the defeating of all Impostors I re∣main  Your most obedient humble Servant and affectionate Kinsman  Humphry Wagstaff  ADVERTISEMENT  Whereas the  TATLER  hath been omitted for some Time by the Neglect of those who had the Care of it in the Absence of  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  And whereas a Gentleman was pleased to publish a Paper insinuating himself to have been Author of the  TATLER  and to have now laid it down And lastly Whereas several spurious Papers have since come out under the said Title The said  Isaac Bickerstaff  declares he is a perfect Stranger to the said Gentleman and does hereby give Notice That he had no Intention to discontinue the said Paper which shall be publish'd every  Tuesday  and  Satur∣day  Only as a Mark of his Displeasure he has thought fit to change his Printer and Publisher It  is therefore desired that all Letters be from hence∣forward directed to  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  at Mrs  Baldwin  's at the  OxfordArms  in  WarwickLane  The TATLER N  o    Alios Viri Reverentia vultusque ad continendum populum mire formatus Alios etiam quibus ipse interesse non potuit Vis scribendi tamen Magni Nominis autoritas pervicers  Tull Epist  From  Saturd Jan  to  Tuesd Jan    I Remember  Menage  tells a Story of Monsieur  Racan  who had appointed a Day and Hour to meet a certain Lady of great Wit whom he had never seen in order to make an Acquaintance between them  'Two of  Racan  's Friends who had heard of the Appointment resolved to play him a Trick The first went to the Lady two Hours before the Time said his Name was  Racan  and talk'd with her an Hour they were both mightily pleased began a great Friendship and parted with much Satisfaction A few Minutes after comes the Second and sends up the same Name the Lady wonders at the Meaning and tells him Mr  Racan  had just left her The Gentleman says it was some ras∣cally Impostor and that he had been frequent∣ly us'd in that Manner The Lady is convinc'd and they laugh at the Oddness of the Adven∣tures She now calls to Mind several Passages which confirms her that the former was a Cheat He appoints a Second Meeting and takes his Leave He was no sooner gone but the true  Racan  comes to the Door and desires under that Name to see the Lady She was  out of all Patience sends for him up rates him for an Impostor and after a Thousand Inju∣ries flings a Slipper at his Head It was im∣possible to pacify or disabuse her he was for∣ced to retire and it was not without some Time and the Intervention of Friends that they could come to an Eclaircisement"  This as I take it is exactly the Case with Mr  Sle  the pretended TATLER from  Morphew  and my self only I presume the World will be sooner undeceiv'd than the Lady in  M  nage  The very Day my last Paper came out my Printer brought me another of the same Date call'd the TAT∣LER by  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  and which was still more pleasant with an Advertisement at the End calling me the  Female  TATLER It is not enough to rob me of my Name but now they must impose a Sex on me when my Years have long since determin'd me to be of none at all There is only one Thing wanting in the Opera∣tion that they would renew my Age and then I will heartily forgive them all the rest In the mean Time whatever Uneasiness I have suffer'd from the little Malice of these Men and my Re∣tirement in the Country the Pleasures I have re∣ceiv'd from the same Occasion will fairly bal∣lance the Account On the one Hand I have been highly delighted to see my Name and Character assumed by the Scribblers of the Age in order to recommend themselves to it and on the other to observe the good Taste of the Town in di∣stinguishing and exploding them through every Disguise and sacrificing their Trifles to the sup∣posed  Manes  of  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esquire But the greatest Merit of my Journey into  Staffordshire  is that it has open'd to me a new Fund of unre∣prov'd Follies and Errors that have hitherto lain out of my View and by their Situation escap'd my Censure For as I have liv'd generally in Town the Images I had of the Country were  such only as my Senses receiv'd very early and my Memory has since preserv'd with all the Ad∣vantages they first appear'd in  Hence it was that I thought our ParishChurch the noblest Structure in  England  and the 'Squire's PlaceHouse as we call'd it a most magnificent Palace I had the same Opinion of the AlmsHouse in the Churchyard and of a Bridge over the Brook that parts our Parish from the next 'Twas the common Vogue of our School That the Master was the best Scholar in  Europe  and the Usher the Second Not happening to correct these Notions by comparing them with what I saw when I came into the World upon return∣ing back I began to resume my former Imagi∣nations and expected all Things should appear in the same View as I left them when I was a Boy But to my utter Disappointment I found them wonderfully shrunk and lessen'd almost out of my Knowledge I look'd with Contempt on the Tribes painted on the Church Walls which I once so much admired and on the carv'd ChimneyPiece in the 'Squire's Hall I found my old Master to be a poor ignorant Pedant and in short the whole Scene to be extreamly chang'd for the worse This I could not help mention∣ing because though it be of no Consequence in it self yet 'tis certain that most Prejudices are contracted and retained by this narrow Way of Thinking which in Matters of the greatest Mo∣ment are hardly shook off and which we only think true because we were made to believe so before we were capable to distinguish between Truth and Falshood But there was one Prepos∣session which I confess to have parted with much to my Regret I mean the Opinion of that na∣tive Honesty and Simplicity of Manners which I had always imagin'd to be inherent in Country People I soon observ'd it was with them and us as they say of Animals That every Species  at Land has one to resemble it at Sea for 'twas easy to discover the Seeds and Principles of every Vice and Folly that one meets with in the more known World though shooting up in different Forms I took a Fancy out of the several Inha∣bitants round to furnish the Camp the Bar and the Exchange and some certain Chocolate and Coffeehouses with exact Parallels to what in many Instances they already produce There was a drunken quarrelsome  Smith  whom I have a hundred Times fancied at the Head of a Troop of Dragoons A Weaver within two Doors of my Kinsman was perpetually setting Neighbours together by the Ears I lamented to see how his Talents were misplac'd and imagin'd what a Fi∣gure he might make in  Westminsterhall  Good∣man  Crop  of  ComptonFarm  wants nothing but a Plumb and a GoldChain to qualify him for the Government of the City My Kinsman's StableBoy was a gibbing Companion that would always have his Jest He would often put Cowitch in the Maids Bed pull Stools from under Folks and lay a Coal upon their Shoes when they were a∣sleep He was at last turn'd off for some notable Piece of Roguery and when I came away was loitering among the Alehouses Bless me thought I what a prodigious Wit would this have been with us I could have match'd all the Sharpers between St  James  's and  CoventGarden  with a notable Fellow in the same Neighbour∣hood since hang'd for picking Pockets at Fairs could he have had the Advantages of their Edu∣cation So nearly are the Corruptions of the Country ally'd to those of the Town with no further Difference than what is made by another Turn of Thought and Method of Living  Many more Grievances though not of equal Importance have been laid before me from seve∣ral Parts of this Kingdom which as they fall not under any ones Cognizance so properly as  my own oblige me to a speedy and effectual Re∣gulation of them When I was prevail'd upon to act as Censor of  Great Britain  I did not enough consider the Extent of that Province nor how difficult it would be to make my Authority un∣derstood in the remoter Parts of this Island for most of the Natives being Strangers to Litera∣ture I cannot hope my Lucubrations should meet with a general Reception amongst them and therefore I have now resolved on an Expe∣dient which I shall explain by the following Or∣der  Saturday January  To all and every one of the Churchwardens and Sidesmen in their respective Parishes throughout the Kingdom of  Great Britain Isaac Bicker∣staff  Esq  Censor of the said Kingdom wishes Health and many happy New Years  Gentlemen  WHereas I have from many Parts of the Kingdom as well Villages as Country Towns receiv'd credible Information of several Innovations Abuses and Offences lately crept into them much derogating from their Ho∣nour nor less pernicious to the Quiet of So∣ciety and at the same Time not punishable by any Law Common or Municipal as yet in Force and whereas my Age growing Infir∣mities and necessary Residence in this Place will not give me Leave to come in Person and put a Stop to these Evils I do hereby charge and require you and every one of you within Five Days after Receipt of this to repair forth∣with to the Vestry or what other Place shall to your Wisdom seem most proper there to chuse elect and nominate some candid so∣ber and understanding Person being not a∣bove the Dignity of a Squire nor under that of Clerk of the Parish aged Fifty Years at  least whom so chosen elected and nomina∣ted I do hereby authorize and depute under the Title of a Rural Censor to remark exa∣mine and take Cognizance of all such Offen∣ces provided always that he does not presume to pronounce Sentence or make any final De∣termination not having first communicated to me by Letter the Persons Quality Circum∣stances  c  or not having receiv'd my Instru∣ctions therein  In Witness whereof I have set my Hand the Day and Date above  Isaac Bickerstaff  Sign'd  KIDNEY  Clerk of the Court during the incapacity of  Charles Lillie  whose Petition relating to his Suspension is referr'd to the next Courtday In the mean Time all Letters and Advices are to be directed to Mrs  Baldwins  This Day the Case of  John Morphew  came on He was indicted for having made many scanda∣lous Reflections on the Censor as likewise for Breach of Trust and being found guilty of the same was sentenc'd to continue printing ShamTatlers and one or two more such Papers Six other Causes were heard afterwards which 'tis not thought proper to make publick many noble Persons yet alive being concern'd therein  The TATLER N  o    Sie teneros animos aliena opprobria sape Absterrent vitris  Hor  From  Tuesd Jan  to  Saturday Jan    WHen I left the Town as I said before I did not only make a sufficient Provision for the Continuance of my Lucubrations till the Time I had fix'd for my Return but took Care to substitute one who in case my Stay should happen to be longer than I design'd would much better have furnished out the usual Entertain∣ment the Publick expected from me  Sam Trusty  of whom I made Mention in a former Paper was the Person I pitched upon to execute that Of∣fice Fifty Years and upwards we have liv'd in so strict an Intimacy in so perfect an Union that neither Times Interest Passions nor Opinions have ever been able to make the least Flaw in our Friendship I am not ashamed to own I have received more Advantage from his Conver∣sation than from all the Academick Exercises 'tis to his Instructions I owe the Improvement of my Understanding to his Precepts and Example the forming of my Manners and to his Obser∣vations the principal Remarks I have made up∣on the several States and Conditions of Mankind As his Genius at our first setting out in the World was much above mine so he has ever since maintained the same Superiority His Words were always few his Arguments weighty his Reflections just his Intentions sincere and his Connexions were mixed with such an agreeable Mirth that I have often taken Pleasure in put∣ting my self in the Wrong on purpose to excite him to so delightful a Reproof A' sudden Indis∣position  defeated me of his Assistance and has exposed me to the Difficulties I have been under in reinstating my self in my former Authority However that he designed to serve me effectual∣ly will appear by the ensuing Discourse which he intended to publish the Day after my Depar∣ture where in his ludicrous Way he has pursued the Directions I left him as he takes Notice himself in his Introduction I was unwilling the World should be deprived of one Line of his Writing and consequently could not well omit what the Excess of his Affection prompted him to say in my Favour and which is perhaps the only Instance that can be given of his Partia∣lity  My very good Friend  Isaac Bickerstaff  being indispensably obliged to visit some Relations in the Country these HolyDays That there may be no Interruption of Justice in his Absence has deputed me to officiate for him till his Return and his last Instructions were to have a particu∣lar Regard to the Interest of the Fair Sex of which he has all along shewn himself a profess'd and constant Admirer I am sensible how un∣equal my Talents are for so important a Task nor are our different Sentiments upon that Sub∣ject a less Obstruction to the Performance of what he has enjoin'd me than my Want of Abi∣lities to fill the Place of so worthy and great a Person But to proceed to the Business in Hand  If we were to  ake Mankind's Character from one another there never could have been so seasonable a Time to exercise the Office of Censor with the utmost Severity because there never was a Time by universal Consent when the Iniquities of the Age were so full blown and consequently the World stood so much in Need of Correction It has ever been thought natural to People advanced in Years as I am  to declaim upon the Vices of the Age they live in but I am far from believing we are half so wicked as we say we are and being a pretty strict Enquirer into Humane Nature and endea∣vouring to trace all Things up to their original Causes I am fully perswaded that a malignant Love of Detraction is the reigning Vice of our Times and could we but eradicate the perni∣cious Practice of Railing and Defamation we should appear to be much upon the Level with our Predecessors and not worse than the Na∣tions round about us  Zeno  the Founder of the Stoick Philosophy had so little Indulgence for the Frailties and Infirmities of Mankind that he esteemed the minutest Deviation from the Rules of Reason and Justice to be of equal Weight with the most horrid Crimes and gros∣sest Impieties so stealing an Apple by his Ac∣count was as great a Sin as committing Sacri∣lege and the throwing at Cocks on  ShroveTuesday  would have been reckoned as heinous an Offence as murthering ones Father in cold Blood We seem to pursue his Principles in the Judgments we make of other Peoples Actions Every little Error the most harmless Irregula∣rities are subject to have Names of Infamy af∣fixed to them and ranked among Deeds of the blackest Complexion  Jenny Filch  is a lamentable Instance of this barbarous Custom They have lately set upon her Reputation at my Lady  Swaddles  the ge∣neral Rendezvous of reverend Female Elders consisting of Antiquated Prudes Superannuated Belles and Coquets of Fifty Five Her Lady∣ship stroaking the downy Honours of her Chin with a hoarse masculine Voice pronounced her guilty of Incontinency cheating at Play Theft and drinking to Excess What an Accumula∣tion of Enormities How severe are these Re∣flections upon the Reputation of a young Lady  And had she not a Greatness of Mind superior to their Malice which some no doubt will a∣scribe to Impudence I cannot see how she could dare shew her Face But I who have known her from her Infancy think it incumbent on me to vindicate her Character and make no Question in very few Words of convincing all impartial Judges how innocent she is of what they lay to her Charge  Jenny Filch  was brought up at a BoardingSchool where Chil∣dren of both Sexes were promiscuously receiv'd From a Girl she hated a Sedentary Life so little Progress was made in the Sampler Her Humour was brisk and jovial her Constitution sanguine and vigorous which led her to delight in robust Diversions such as Trapball Jug∣glecat Britishhoppers Ninepins and Whip∣ping Tops To share in their Sports she was fain to be much among the Boys she grew from thence to love their Company extreamly and has gradually continued the Affection ever since I am forced to explain this Matter very particularly because she has been often twitted by the Ladies for liking to be with the Fellows rather than with them As she is a very little Observer of Forms she seldom could endure to be under the Restraint of a set Dress but rather chuse with some one Friend to go in a Mob and a Mask into the Pit at a Play than to sit in a Box The Vivacity of her Wit and the Smart∣ness of her Repartees drew constantly all the young Beaux about her This Humour of hers it seems took mightily and she would often prevail upon those Ladies of her Acquain∣tance whose Husbands were beyond Sea pure∣ly out of Compassion rather than to sit moping and melancholy at Home to go along with her and in short did all she could to procure them such Diversions as might make them less sen∣sible of their 'Spouse's Absence When the Play  was near done no Body was more nice in chu∣sing some of the most civil and harmless Men to lead them to a Coach and because Hack∣neyCoachmen are often very rude and impo∣sing they would now and then for Protection permit them to step in and perhaps drive to  Phillips  's just to refresh their Spirits Some∣times if they were very well assured of the Gentlemen's Behaviour they would in a Fro∣lick venture to ear a Frigasee at  Pontacks  but never failed to be back by Twelve I remem∣ber there was a great Pother about Two or Three of her Companions who at their Hus∣band's Return were very near encreasing their Family But how she is to blame all this while no Body can say 'twas her doing let every one answer for their own Follies And this is all I ever heard alledged against her upon the first Article  Now as to cheating at Play I suppose what mislead them into that Opinion was her great Skill and Dexterity in all Tricks at Cards For having very fine Fingers she took a great deal of Pleasure in learning whatever the famous  High German  could teach her in that Art wherein she grew so great a Proficient that in a short Time she outdid her Master Twice or Thrice a Week meerly for Amusement she would pass the Evening at  Langteral    and truly 'twas very entertaining for any Standers by to ob∣serve what a superior Genius she had in hand∣ling the Cards above the People she play'd with She would make nothing of shewing Three Loo's in Five Deals to the great Wonder and Surprize of all the Company But as this was only done for Diversion she chose to play so low that she seldom carried off above Four or Five Pounds just to pay her Chair and buy clean Gloves what they mean by Theft I can't imagine unless 'twas slipping now and then a  China Cup into her Pocket at an  Indian House  to adorn her Cabinet This it seems is a here∣ditary Piece of Furniture she is very fond of it came from  Italy  long ago the Inside is curious∣ly painted wherein are represented the Loves of  Endymion  and the  M  Cupid  and  Psyche Ve∣nus  and  Adonis  with several other fabulous Stories She ever loved to have Things neat a∣bout her and only wanted some few Pieces of China to place upon the Top of this Cabinet but being a notable Housewife she could not endure to squander away her Money upon such Baubles so when she went with any of her Ac∣quaintance to Shops that deal in th  se Things she would pick up in one Place a Cup in the next a Saucer in a Third something of another Sort either China or Japan just as it came to Hand and by Degrees got as compleat a Col∣lection together as any Body In short there ne∣ver was a more agreeable Variety for no Two Pieces were alike in the whole Parcel 'Tis ten to one some scrupulous People will be apt to call this Pilfering but let them consider no Body ever more exactly observed the Rules of Justice in all the Measures she took to supply her self with those Conveniencies Every Shop contributed but barely its Share and the Bur∣then being equally laid so far from giving Oc∣casion of Complaint the Loss was scarce felt by any Body besides she made them ample A∣mends by commending their Goods and bring∣ing them Custom I may add in her Behalf that what she did was meerly in Conformity of the Fashion Every Lady's Cabinet was cover'd with China she could not well afford to buy it What should she do It has been a receiv'd Saying  One had as good be out of the World as out of the Fashion  from whence we may con∣clude those Things are as necessary as Meat and Drink and no Body was ever accounted a Cri∣minal  for taking as much as would suffice Na∣ture let it be at whose Expence it would In∣deed had this been done in any b  e View for filthy Lucre and to sell again I readily grant she were to blame but in her Case 'tis no more than stealing the Custom of Wine for ones own Table and we all know how commonly that's practised by People of very tender Con∣sciences  What remains to be spoken of is  Her immode∣rate Love of Wine  nor will she be less clear in this than in all the rest  Jenny  has a voluble Tongue and loves to exercise it that I cannot but own she often talks her self into a Heat and that causes Thirst sometimes by an Ab∣sence of Mind pretty incident to her she will call for Glass after Glass without remembring she drank but the Minute before Now this may prove she has a short Memory indeed but how to infer the  Love of Wine  from hence I cannot see The Mistake however is easy to be accounted for The Negligence of her Dress her fluster'd Complexion her great Loquacity sometimes and her incoherent Answers to o∣thers when her Thoughts are wandering often concur to make her look as if she were actually in Drink But is this an equitable Way of Judg∣ing If once we suffer our selves to be imposed on by Appearances farewel all Hopes of having Truth established among us in our Generation  Before I dismiss this Subject I cannot but ex∣press a sincere Concern for a Multitude of injur'd Women who have suffered in their Characters for want of a Champion to defend their Cause and I will take upon me to affirm as much might have been said for a Hundred about this Town who have been basely abused as I have done for  Jenny Filch  But I refer their Justification to my Friend  Isaac  to whom that Province does most properly belong  The TATLER N  o    Tibi luditur effluis amens  Contemnere  Per  From  Saturday Jan  to  Tuesday Jan    ChannelRow  January  LEaning out of my Window this Morning I observ'd a Young Gentleman pass under it whose Face I was sure to have seen but could not presently recollect his Name The Oddness of his Figure help'd to disguise him for though otherwise decent enough he had a NapkinCap on his Head and at the same Time by the Neg∣ligence of his Air gave one to understand that he thought himself dress'd for the whole Day In this Manner he walk'd on to the End of our Lane then turn'd short upon his Heel and hurry'd back again with the utmost Precipitation By this Time I had made a shift to remember that this was the same Young Gentleman whom I formerly made Mention of in order to recommend a Play of his to the World There was Merit enough in that Performance to make me a Wellwisher to the Author and as much Wit as might make him ca∣pable of an odd Turn in his Understanding  I was sorry to see him thus expos'd and bec∣kon'd him up to me he came in great Confusion and without giving me Time to ask any Que∣stions told me  he was particularly asham'd to be seen by a Man of my Character in so heedless a Way that indeed he had come out in some hast and forg  t his Hat and Perriwig  By his aukward Man∣ner of excusing himself I soon found the Cause of his Disorder that it was purely Artificial and  lay rather in his Heart than his Head 'Twas with great Indignation I heard his Apology and had not I been strongly prejudic'd in the young Man's behalf I should hardly have afforded him the Fa∣vour of a Rebuke After some Enquiry I found by him that this Inadvertency had cost him much Pains and Industry to acquire and that by long Use it was now improv'd into a Habit  He freely own'd that this was a Method he had often took to distinguish and recommend himself as a Wit and that he had hitherto met with good Success I was a little pacify'd with the Frankness of this Confession and encourag'd him to proceed in it  'To tell you the Truth Sir  says he  I was led into this Error ve∣ry young and the Occasion of it perhaps may give you Diversion 'Twas a Custom at the Great School where I was bred frequently to call over the Names of the Boys in the Presence of the Master This happen'd one Day just af∣ter the Publick Prayers were over and when it came to my Turn to say  Adsum  through Mi∣stake I answer'd  Amen  Would you believe Sir that from this very Moment I came imme∣diately into Vogue I was cry'd up for a Boy of great Parts and of a wild but extraordinary Ge∣nius As I grew more careless I was still more admir'd and by a Thousand little premeditated Blunders I at last establish'd a Reputation When I came to the University I expected to be laugh'd out of my Fooleries but instead of that I was every Day more confirm'd in them There was hardly a Man of Distinction but was as they call it in the University Cant a  Sh  t  and a  Rattle  To be a very great Sloven in Dress was some Degree of Merit and I par∣ticularly remember one of the  Beaux Esprits  that valued himself upon being the dirtiest Fel∣low that ever writ a good Line 'Twas a Mat∣ter of Emulation amongst us whose Rooms  should be worst furnish'd and lie in the greatest Disorder so that with a little wresting of the Sense we might have writ over our Doors  Hic vivimus ambitiosa  Paupertate  Harry Heedless  whose Works you may have heard of has lately taken an Allegorical Inven∣tory of his Goods in Heroic Verse suffer me Sir to put it into your Hands and to beg a Place for it in your next  Lucubrations  "  Here the young Gentleman took his Leave and thank'd me for my Friendship with an Air of Sincerity that could not be dissembled His Readiness to understand his Error and his Resolution to re∣form it have indeed convinc'd me that in Mat∣ters of this Kind a Man of great Parts may re∣peat more in half an Hour than one of ordinary Capacity can in many Years But I must not omit the Verses  Where C C Towers in pompous Pride are drest  Sublime and far Superior to the rest  O'er distant Piles presides a Garret high  That braves the Gods and borders on the Sky  Within whose jutting Walls and vaulted Roof  DISORDER Frantick Goddess dwells aloof  Banish'd the Court despairing to be Great  The wretched Exile flies to this Retreat  Pensive and sad she sits with ragged Grace  On tottering Chair the  Tripos  of the Place  In muddy Ale there wasts the lingring Day  Or in  Mundungus  Clouds whiffs Care away  At Night's Approach on Bed unmade she lies  Whose Softness with the polish'd Marble vies  Not stuff'd from Fowls at Lordly Banquets drest  They made for Luxury their Plumes for Rest  But from those Flocks that feed by harmless Swains  On  Hampshire  Downs or  Wiltshire  's spreading Plains  Mean while the Winds a dreadful Consort keep  And with h  rse Musick lull her fast asleep  I cannot help adding a Word or Two upon this Humour of setting up for a Wit by personating a different Conduct from others in the Common Actions of Life The rather because within the Compass of my own Observation it has depriv'd the World of many useful Persons and eclips'd many valuable Qualifications It has certainly been the Misfortune of several Great Men to have had something singular in their Gate their Diet and even in their Conversation it self They who have follow'd the profounder Studies appear of∣ten to have their thoughts distracted as 'tis par∣ticularly observ'd of Mathematicians their Minds being so steddily fix'd that they cannot easily un∣bend them  Hence it is that others imagining the Merit lies in the Singularity are glad to find it so easie a Matter to distinguish themselves the Desire of doing which I take to be the Root of all Affecta∣tion To say Truth the Men of Wit have na∣turally their Share in these Imperfections For as more severe Studies require a very close Appli∣cation theirs perhaps ingage it too little and their Spirits are too volatile to give a long and constant Attention This Absence of theirs if I may so speak my Cousin  Humphry  calls a Tax upon great Genius's and says he thinks it a Happiness when a Man of eminent Parts has nothing Particular to be known by ei∣ther when he walks the Street or appears in Company For which Reason in talking over the Characters of Ingenious Men I am frequently offended to hear People dwell upon some odd Circumstances in their Behaviour A certain Au∣thor about Town is much celebrated for writing all his Works upon Backs of Letters and Scraps of Paper Another writ the best Part of his Poem upon old Cards and had like to have lost Ten of the finest Lines in it upon an Ace of Dia∣monds which he had unluckily misplac'd A  Third of Immortal Memory was wont to lie in his Perriwig and caught a Cold that destroy'd him by washing his Hands These and many other Singularities observable in Men of extraor∣dinary Talents might for ought one knows be natural to them But when  Papilio  studies for In∣coherent Answers to every Question that is ask'd him and makes Appointments on purpose to for∣get them 'tis a Question amongst the Curious Whether the Humour be natural or affected I think it the most favourable Opinion that there is a Mixture of both I have often with great Pleasure considered the Character of my Friend  Urbanus  whose great Wit and Learning are in∣deed accompanied with Singularities such as are altogether Natural but will I doubt meet with few Imitators I mean his excessive Candor Mo∣desty and good Nature The Affectation of these Qualities would sufficiently distinguish any one that would be at the Pains to transcribe them and the Consequences of it would be of Service to the World But to copy the Infirmities only of Great Men and to quote their Example in our Defence is making Precedents of them where they least desire to be so and perverting their Authority to give a Sanction to Folly  The TATLER N  o    Laceratque trahitque  Molle pecus  Vir  From  Tuesday Jan  to  Saturday Jan    AMongst other Severities I have met with from some Criticks the cruelest for an Old Man is that they will not let me be at quiet in my Bed but pursue me to my very Dreams I  must not dream but when they please nor upon long continued Subjects however Visionary in their own Natures because there is a manifest Moral quite thro' them which to produce as a Dream is improbable and unnatural The Pain I might have had from this Objection is prevented by considering they have missed another against which I should have been at a Loss to defend my self They should have ask'd me whether the Dreams I publish can properly be call'd  Lucubra∣tions  which is the Name I have given to all my Papers whether in Volumes or Halfsheets So manifest a Contradiction  in Terminis  that I won∣der no Sophister ever thought of it But the o∣ther is a Cavil I remember when I was a Boy at School I have often dream'd out the whole Passages of a Day that I rode a Journey bai∣ted supp'd went to Bed and rose the next Morning and I have known young Ladies who would dream a whole Contexture of Adventures in one Night large enough to make a Novel In Youth the Imagination is strong not mix'd with Cares nor tinged with those Passions that most disturb and confound it such as Avarice Ambi∣tion and many others Now as old Men are said to grow Children again so in this Article of Dreaming I am returned to my Childhood My Imagination is at full Ease without Care Ava∣rice or Ambition to clog it by which among ma∣ny others I have this Advantage of doubling the small Remainder of my Time and living Four and Twenty Hours in the Day However the Dream I am now going to relate is as wild as can well be imagined and to please these Re∣finers upon Sleep without any Moral that I can discover  It happen'd that my Maid left on the Table in my BedChamber one of her StoryBooks as she calls them which I took up and found full of strange Impertinences fitted to her Tast and  Condition of Poor Servants that came to be Ladies and ServingMen of low Degree who married Kings Daughters Among other Things I met this Sage Observation that a Lion would never hurt a true Virgin With this Medly of Nonsense in my Fancy I went to Bed and dream'd that a Friend waked me in the Mor∣ning and proposed for Pastime to spend a few Hours in seeing the ParishLions which he had not done since he came to Town and because they show'd but once a Week he would not miss the Opportunity I said I would humour him tho' to speak the Truth I was not fond of those cruel Spectacles and if it were not so ancient a Custom founded as I had heard upon the wisest Maxims I should be apt to cen∣sure the Inhumanity of those who introduced it All this will be a Riddle to the waking Reader till I discover the Scene my Imagination had formed upon the Maxim that a Lion would ne∣ver hurt a true Virgin I dream'd that by a Law of Immemorial Time a HeLion was kept in every Parish at the common Charge and in a Place provided adjoining to the Churchyard That before any one of the Fair Sex was married if she affirmed her self to be a Virgin she must on her Wed∣dingDay and in her WeddingCloaths per∣form the Ceremony of going alone into the Den and stay an Hour with the Lion let loose and kept fasting Four and Twenty Hours on purpose At a proper Height above the Den were convenient Galleries for the Relations and Friends of the Young Couple and open to all Spectators No Maiden was forced to offer her self to the Lion but if she refused it was a Disgrace to marry her and every one might have Liberty of calling her a Whore And me∣thought it was as usual a Diversion to see the ParishLions as with us to go to a Play or an  Opera And it was reckoned convenient to be near the Church either for marrying the Vir∣gin if she escaped the Trial or for burying the Bones when the Lion had devoured the rest as he constantly did  To go on therefore with the Dream  We call'd first as I remember to see St  Dunstan  's Lion but we were told they did not shew to Day From thence we went to that of  CoventGarden  which to my great Surprize we found as lean as a Skeleton when I expected quite the contrary but the Keeper said 'twas no Wonder at all because the poor Beast had not got an Ounce of Woman's Flesh since he came into the Parish This amaz'd me more than the other and I was forming to my self a mighty Vene∣ration for the Ladies in that Quarter of the Town when the Keeper went on and said He wonder'd the Parish would be at the Charge of maintaining a Lion for nothing Friend said I do you call it Nothing to justify the Virtue of so many Ladies or has your Lion lost his distinguishing Faculty Can there be any Thing more for the Honour of your Parish than that all the Ladies married in your Church were pure Virgins That is true said he and the Doctor knows it to his Sorrow for there has not been a Couple married in our Church since his Worship has been amongst us The Virgins hereabouts are too wise to venture the Claws of the Lion and because no Body will marry them have all entered into Vows of Vir∣ginity So that in Proportion we have much the largest Nunnery in the whole Town This Manner of Ladies entring into a Vow of Vir∣ginity because they were not Virgins I easily conceiv'd and my Dream told me that the whole Kingdom was full of Nunneries plenti∣fully stock'd from the same Reason  We went to see another Lion where we found much Company met in the Gallery the Keeper told us we should see Sport enough as he call'd it and in a little Time we saw a young beautiful Lady put into the Den who walk'd up towards the Lion with all imaginable Security in her Countenance and look'd smi∣ling upon her Lover and Friends in the Gallery which I thought nothing extraordinary because it was never known that any Lion had been mistaken But however we were all Disap∣pointed for the Lion lifted up his Right Paw which was the fatal Sign and advancing for∣ward seized her by the Arm and began to tear it The poor Lady gave a terrible shriek and cry'd out  The Lion is just I am no true Virgin  Oh  Sappho Sappho  She could say no more for the Lion gave her the  Coup de Grace  by a squeeze in the Throat and she expir'd at his Feet The Keeper dragg'd away her Body to feed the Animal when the Company was gone for the Parish Lions never used to eat in Pub∣lick After a little Pause another Lady came on towards the Lion in the same Manner as the former we observ'd the Beast smell her with great Diligence he scratch'd both her Hands with lifting them to his Nose and clapping a Claw on her Bosom drew Blood however he let her go and at the same Time turned from her with a So  t of Contempt at which she was not a little mortify'd and retired with some Confusion to her Friends in the Gallery Me∣thought the whole Company immediately un∣derstood the Meaning of this that the Easiness of the Lady had suffered her to admit certain impudent and dangerous Familiarities border∣ing too much upon what is Criminal neither was it sure whether the Lover then present had not some Sharers with him in those Free∣doms  of which a Lady can never be too spa∣ring  This happened to be an extraordinary Day for a Third Lady came into the Den laughing loud playing with her Fan tossing her Head and smiling round on the young Fellows in the Gallery However the Lion leap'd on her with great Fury and we gave her for gone but on a sudden he let go his Hold turned from her as if he were nauseated then gave her a Lash with his Tail after which she returned to the Gal∣lery not the least out of Countenance And this it seems was the usual Treatment of Co∣quets  I thought we had now seen enough but my Friend would needs have us go and visit One or Two Lions in the City We call'd at Two or Three Dens where they happen'd not to shew but we generally found half a Score young Girls between Eight and Eleven Years Old playing with each Lion sitting on his Back and putting their Heads into his Mouth some of them would now and then get a Scratch but we always discover'd upon examining that they had been hoydening with the young Ap∣prentices One of them was calling to a pretty Girl of about Twelve Years that stood by us in the Gallery to come down to the Lion and upon her Refusal said  Ah Miss  Betty  we could never get you to come near the Lion since you play'd at Hoop and Hide with my Brother in the Garret  We followed a Couple with the Wedding Folks goint to the Church of St  Ma∣ryAx  's The Lady though well stricken in Years extremely crooked and deform'd was dress'd out beyond the Gaiety of Fifteen ha∣ving jumbled together as I imagin'd all the Tawd'ry Remains of Aunts Godmothers and Grandmothers for some Generations past  One of the Neighbours whisper'd me that she was an Old Maid and had the clearest Repu∣tation of any in the Parish There is nothing strange in that thought I but was much sur∣pris'd when I observ'd afterwards that she went towards the Lion with Distrust and Concern The Beast was lying down but upon Sight of her snuff'd up his Nose Two or Three Times and then giving the Sign of Death proceeded instantly to Execution In the midst of her A∣gonies she was heard to name the Words  Italy  and  Artifices  with the utmost Horror and several repeated Execrations And at last concluded  Feel that I was to put so much Con∣fidence in the Toughness of my Skin  The Keeper immediately set all in order a∣gain for another Customer which happened to be a famous Prude whom her Parents after long Threatnings and much Perswasion had with the extreamest Difficulty prevailed on to accept a young handsome Goldsmith that might have pretended to five Times her Fortune The Fathers and Mothers in the Neighbourhood used to quote her for an Ex∣ample to their Daughters Her Elbows were rivetted to her Sides and her whole Person so order'd as to inform every Body that she was afraid they should touch her She only drea∣ded to approach the Lion because it was a He one and abhorr'd to think an Animal of that Sex should presume to breathe on her The Sight of a Man at Twenty Yards Distance made her draw back her Head She always sate upon the far∣ther Corner of the Chair tho' there were Six Chairs between her and her Lover and with the Door wide open and her little Sister in the Room She was never saluted but at the Tip of her Ear and her Father had much ado to make her dine without her Gloves when there  was a Man at Table She enter'd the Den with some Fear which we took to proceed from the Height of her Modesty offended at the Sight of so many Men in the Gallery The Lion beholding her at a Distance immediately gave the deadly Sign at which the poor Crea∣ture methinks I see her still miscarried in a Fright before us all The Lion seem'd to be surpris'd as much as we and gave her Time to make her Confession  That she was Four Months gone by the Foreman of her Father's Shop that this was her Third big Belly  and when her Friends ask'd why she would venture the Trial She said  her Nurse assured her that a Lion would never hurt a Woman with Child  " Upon this I immediately wak'd and could not help wishing that the DeputyCensors of my late Institution were indu'd with the same In∣stinct as these Parish Lions were  The TATLER N  o    Juvenumque prodis  Publica

receiv'd the following Letter  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  SIR  I Have just now read your  Tatler  of this Day in which let me tell you you have highly disoblig'd great Numbers of Ladies and Gentle∣men by endeavouring to debar them of many Freedoms with each other before thought al∣lowable  For my own Part if I were a Man or a Woman I would either cut your Throat or get you poison'd for it As I am neither I judge impartially and write this without Passion  Castraccio Bellechantini  I am to understand by this that both Sexes are up in Arms against me and that the Sig∣nior is inclin'd strictly to observe a  Venetian  Neu∣trality  To comfort me under this Misfortune the same Post brought me the Appearance of a Com∣pliment tho' to say Truth I don't know how far to depend upon it  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  The humble Address of as many Virgins as could be conveniently assem∣bled to that Purpose from all Parts of the City of  London  May it please your Honour  'WE whose Names are underwritten being honest Maids and true and not fea∣ring upon a good Occasion to look the hun∣griest of your Lions in the Face though all of us as appears by the

just Satyr on themselves and undeserv'd Scandal on others It were to be wish'd in∣deed that the Expedient your Honour was pleas'd to dream of could actually and imme∣diately be put in force throughout every Parish in this Kingdom to the Confusion of all such Offenders and the Justification of those who abhor their Practices In the mean Time pla∣cing  a great Confidence in the Truth of the an∣cient Tradition by you mention'd as well as in our own Innocency we humbly beg Leave to propose to your Honour that as many of them and us as to your Wisdom shall seem proper may forthwith be order'd to the

for the Service and true Interest of the Fair Many sleepless Nights and Days of Anxiety they have cost me Yet for all this I do not find that I have any Degree of Interest in their Persons or any

De∣fiance  Bellaria  is a provoking Instance of this Kind it has in good Earnest stood me in ThreePence to reform her and I do not find that she is One Farthing the better for it She is young 'tis true and may live to be wiser As her Beau∣ty goes off Prudence perhaps will grow upon her but to be discreet in the Height of her Charms would be a much greater Merit She knows the Faults I have charged her with and must thank her self if she should hereafter  oblige me to be more open and particular  Sempro∣nia  with the same Aggravation continues to be haughty insolent and unnatural She is the Mo∣ther of Five beautiful Children the eldest not above Seven Years Old whom she never speaks to but with a Design to teize them and uses worse than any Animals that belong to her Go∣ing to her Coach the other Day she observ'd Two or Three of them diverting themselves in the Hall and turning to her People asked the Rea∣son why those Brats lay litt'ring about the House Miss  Molly  was severely whip'd within this Week for calling her Mother behind her back and Ma∣ster  Neddy  taken from Table for seeming only to want his Dinner before the  Italian  Greyhound had been fed  I have met with a Case yet more extraordinary and which has given me much Uneasiness Tho' I cannot say of so Criminal a Nature as the latter Taking a Turn in the  Park  about a Month since I saw a Paper lie upon the Ground which I had the Curiosity to stoop for and found to be a  Re∣cipe  For  Clorinda  Vineagar of Squills  Verjuice Of each Five Ounces  Oyl of Vitriol as much as is sufficient  Six Spoonfuls of this Mixture to be taken every Morning Plain Coffee or Watergruel for common Drink  R B  A C  I was very much surpris'd at so odd a Prescrip∣tion and having formerly had the Honour to know the Lady for whose Use it was intended cou'd not help inquiring into the Occasion of it  With some Difficulty I inform'd my self that  Clo¦rinda  whom all the World admir'd was very lately displeas'd with her own Person Some good natur'd Friend it seems had put it in her Head that she was growing too fat and in a little Time wou'd be out of all Shape This sufficiently a∣larm'd her and from a Gaiety of Temper that was peculiar to her she fell into Spleen Vapours and a Thousand imaginary Disquiets There was no Absurdity so gross that her Fears did not im∣pose upon her As she pass'd the Streets in her Chair she expected every Moment that the Fel∣lows wou'd sink under their Burden and wou'd often say to her self  Bless me how the poor Crea∣tures blow  My Lady  KillChairman  's Shape was become the Object of her Envy as it had former∣ly been the Subject of her Ridicule In short a Consultation of the most eminent Physicians was resolv'd on and a Course of Acids  Cum Regimi∣ne  was it seems the Result of it As soon as this came to my Knowledge I sent  Clorinda  a Letter full of such pressing Remonstrances as the Occasion suggested to me I conjur'd her with all the Tenderness of a Gallant not to suffer so much Beauty to be lost to the World by being overcurious to preserve it nor that Bloom to wi∣ther thro' an irreligious Mortification of her self  After taking so much Pains to see my Advice neglected and other Measures pursu'd has I own sensibly touch'd me both as an old Man and a graduate Physician However it is yet in the Power of  Clorinda  to retrieve what is pass'd She has nothing more to do than to eat drink and sleep to make her self again the Joy of her Friends the Desire of Mankind and what is yet greater without Vanity be it said to be heartily forgiven by the

very ill Consequence that many Failings and In∣firmities are too closely woven into our Constitu∣tions ever to be removed by any Pains or Appli∣cation of our own Had I suffer'd my self to be∣lieve this I had been now one of the peevishest old Fellows as I was formerly one of the most passionate Youths in the World Till the Age of Sixteen I was never in good Humour two Hours together I thought my self affronted by every one I met and grew into a Proverb for the Violence of my Resentments I no sooner came to the Use of my Reason but I began to cool a∣pace and have ever since preserved such an Even∣ness of Temper as is not easily ruffled and which under the greatest Difficulties and Distresses has made me superior to them all  I remember one Thing of my self in the Days of my Minority that was pleasant enough When∣ever any Body had done me an ill Office I used in the Bitterness of my Heart to wish my self Parson of the Parish for their Sake He I ob∣served had once a Week the Privilege of speak∣ing  his Mind in publick and of telling his Pa∣rishioners their own This I thought was a mighty Relief to his Spleen and indeed the Doctor made Use of it as if he had been of the same Opinion He had a particular Felicity in finding out Texts to his Purpose and no one Of∣fence could be committed against him that did not appear the next  Sunday  to be literally forbid∣den in Scripture The Top Gentleman in the Parish having one Day made him a Visit in a striped NightGown he looked upon this  Disha∣bilee  as a Mark of Contempt and the very next Time the Pulpit was his own

a pub∣lick Capacity to particular Resentments is what I have industriously avoided throughout the whole Course of my Lucubrations After the many Observations I have made upon humane Nature it is I confess some Pleasure to com∣municate them to the Publick in the Manner I have chose to do it But unless in Cases where my Reputation has been openly attacked I have never once interested the World in any Disputes relating to my self Every Body knows what Provocations Mr  Powell  gave me and in how crowded a Theatre before I would descend to take any Notice of him When I did it was in such a Manner I thought as all Controversy ought to be managed between Scholars and Gen∣tlemen Mr  Morphew  and Mr  Lillie  obliged me to draw my Pen against them by a Piece of Ingra∣titude  that is hardly to be matched in History I had always treated those Persons with a Respect due to their Characters and as our Interests were mutual I flattered my self that our Affections were so too I know I shall suffer in the Opinion of some unforgiving People when I make it known that after such repeated Indignities I have again taken them into Favour But as the following Petition was introduced to me by some of the first Quality in this Kingdom I can deny nothing to their Commands nor indeed to the Dictates of my own Humanity  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  undoubted Censor of the Kingdom of  Great Britain  The

something which is natural to almost every Body does when rightly appli∣ed give Birth to many great and noble Enter∣prizes but when it falls under the Direction of a fantastical Judgment it becomes troublesome and ridiculous to all the World On one Side it con∣tributes to the Characters of the greatest Gene∣rals and the wisest Statesmen and on the other it furnishes publick Conversations with Busy Bo∣dies and Buffoons I have observed  Will Worth∣less  for a long Time about this Town labouring under a prodigious Impatience of being distin∣guish'd as a Man of some Sort of Figure or other At his first coming from the University he set up for a great Unbeliever for which Reason as likewise because he was afraid to be in a Room by himself he spent most of his Time at the  Graecian  But not arriving to any great Eminence in Infidelity he turned himself with great Appli∣cation to the Calling of a Virtuoso To equip himself for this he travel'd twice into  Italy  from  whence at great Expence he brought back a so∣lemn Face with the Reputation of knowing as much as he did when he went out Being now greatly accomplish'd for the Service of his Coun∣try he thought it was high Time to take Care of the Constitution and to that End without Fear or Wit leap'd at once over Head and Ears into publick Business From that Time to this he has liv'd in a profess'd Course of Gravity I have had more frequent Opportunities of conversing with him than I could have wish'd For taking me by my Age to be a Man for his Purpose he has in a Manner forced himself upon my Acquaintance He has told me with great Frankness That he thinks it below a reasonable Man either to laugh or drink Wine and that he has laid down some Rules to himself as essential to the Character he affects  "To preserve a stedfast Countenance to whisper in Coffeehouses to shave but twice a Week and to wear but one Loop to his Hat to read nothing but the Votes and to keep Company with his Father He has sometimes said with as much Pleasure as his Face is capa∣ble of Well Mr  Bickerstaff  nothing sure is so solid a Satisfaction as BusinessFor my Part I love it so well that I can't like a Proposal the worse for having been rejected"  and to do him Justice he has been a true Friend to di∣stressed Projects and as good as a Father to Bills in Disgrace He receives more Petitions than a First Minister and

Paul Marmalade  Upon my coming in Mr  Worthless  who sate next the Fire rose up and forced me into his Chair The Justice with an innocent Smile in his Face and his Cane at his Mouth said  "Mr  Bicker∣staff  you can tell us Pray Sir what are all these Insurances upon Births and Marriages will they come to any Thing or no Before I could answer he went on Why really Sir I would be glad Gentlemen would consider eve∣ry Nation consists chiefly of Men and Women How says Sir  Paul  do you make nothing of Children"  The Justice shaking his Head said  "My good Friend Sir  Paul  you don't take me but what I would offer is this If Mar∣riages are hindered Procreation in a legal Way will cease and the Consequence of that every one knows However if no Body else takes Notice of it I am sure I shan't'Tis not my Business to find Faults'  Mr  Worthless  stopping him short cried  "Pray take me along with you for unless the Persons marrying be equal to the Persons married where is your Ballance For I take it a Nation may be over as well as under married"  "Well says Sir  Paul  I don't love disputing in Company but you would have a hard Matter to make that out"  This weighty Conversation was interrupted by Captain  Mystery  who came in from his Round of Levees with a Face of great Hurry and Impor∣tance  "Gentlemen says he you little think where I have been this MorningHark you Mr  Worthless  a Word in your Ear All outShipsCommandA Blockhead and a Coward and all their Hands to it'Tis a little hard tho' that neither Side should take any Notice of one'  This was all I overheard of his Whisper when a Servant came and told Mr  Worthless  there were several People at the Door who desired to speak with his Honour Leave of Audience be∣ing given the first that entered was Don  Cava∣liero de Tristo Figure  The Solemnity of his Air joined with the miserable Habit he was in was a  most exquisite Burlesque upon the Humour of his Country He had in his Hand a Bundle of Pa∣pers much obscured with Filth and of a Fra∣grancy not to be endured These he presented to the Patriot who gave me to understand that they contained a short and easy Expedient to settle the House of  Austria  on the Throne of  Spain  whispering at the same Time that he ve∣rily believed this Gentleman to be of the Blood Royal  The next as I understood from him was one Mrs  James  a little ancient Gentlewoman in a Pair of very high Pattins who with much Anxiety and Hunger in her Countenance desired his Honour with a low Voice and in a Language that I hardly understood  "To attend her Busi∣ness in the House for that it was now just rea∣dy to come on"  and it seems it has been in the same Forwardness for these Thirty Years past She withdrew with great Humility and repeat∣ed Courtesies to make Room for a Third Mr  Worthless  took me aside and told me  "That this was a Gentleman who in his younger Days studied the Law but having failed in that had now put himself into the fantastical Habit I saw and under it was one of the deepest Heads in the World He has attended me says he these Three Years with a Project to save  England  and I know not yet whether I shall bring it to bear"  I was by this Time heartily tired and in proper Form took Leave of the Company not knowing whether I ought most to commiserate the Misfortunes of these poor Wretches or contemn and expose

Oxon  Febr  SIR  THough I happen to be descended from a Melancholy Father and a Hypochondrix Mother I was not till my Fortieth Year made sensible that Infirmities of this Kind are commu∣nicated from Parents to their Children 'Twas about that Time that the College Clock run∣ning mightily in my Head I could not help fancying my self to be so nearly related to it that I was obliged not to speak but when that strook My Cousin the Clock happening soon after to be down with a Disorder I heard no∣thing of him for a Week together during which Time I could not be prevailed upon to speak one Syllable and it being my Turn to read a publick Lecture I was forced to send my Ex∣cuse in Writing  This Fit going off I was my self for Half a Year afterwards but sitting much by the Com∣monRoom Fire I had a strange Fancy that I was a Poker and if any Body talked of filling a Pipe I immediately moved off for fear they should make Use of me to light it Upon the least Indisposition I had no Notion of going to any Body but the Smith to be mended After this I took my self for the College Gate and lay under a constant Apprehension of being se∣verely thumped at all Hours of the Night  Would you think it Sir At last this Whim went so far that I verily believed my self to be your Paper the  Tatler  Then though I had sometimes the Pleasure of thinking that I was mightily commended at others I had inexpres∣sible Fears I fancied that a Friend of mine who had taken Physick was looking for me high and low on a very unworthy Occasion and was wonderfully delighted when my Bro∣ther the  Gazette  was made Use of in my Stead I was often vexed at my Heart to be hung al∣most all over with Advertisements of Insuran∣ces MorningGowns LapDogs and Lottery Tickets and now and then had terrible Unea∣siness for having made bold with my Betters Being at length pretty well recovered of this Fit I thought it advisable to come to  London  and take Care of my Health But as I was go∣ing to the Coach to my great Surprize I found my self turned into a Football and at the Mercy of a Pack of Scoundrels who without any Re∣gard to the Dignity of my former Characters kicked me from one End of the  Highstreet  to the other During this last Misfortune I have been made the unwilling Instrument of break∣ing many Windows and once of flying in the Face of a Civil Magistrate For this Reason I am as you may very well imagine ashamed to shew my Head and being from my Spherical Figure incapable of Writing my self I have begged a Friend to consult you in my Name up∣on this my deplorable Condition and to tell you that I hope in some Time I shall be able to assure you of my being my own Man and  Your most obliged And most humble Servant  Peter Proteus  Recipe Caballum Anglice  take Horse  This Day about Twelve

Febr  to  Saturd Febr    From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  February  ONE or two of my last Papers having made it known that I am removed from by old Lodgings in  SheerLane  I have on that Occasion received Letters from two Correspon∣  ents of very different Sentiments One of  hem wishes me Joy of a clearer Air and more  leasing Situation the other is so free as to  all me a restless unquiet old Fellow and a  ain Pretender to Philosophy Hard Fate of  hose who happen to have distinguished them∣  elves in the World that their minutest Actions  ust be discanted on and every little Motion  hey

filled with such a  ariety of Entertainments that I am almost  mpted in my old Age to turn Poet for the  ke of it As a Lover of my Country it is a  nsible Pleasure to me from the Nobleness of  the River and Magnificence of the Structures to measure the Wealth and Grandeur of the  British  Nation In the Capacity of Censor I consider this huge Mass of Buildings as my own Province and am in a Manner directed by my Eye to the Execution of my Office as I appre∣hend this or that Part of the Metropolis to stand in Need of Correction But these alas  were not the principal Inducements that brought me hither Old Age and an unhealthy Win∣ter have taken from me most of my Friends in the other Part of the Town whom Time  a long Acquaintance had rivetted into my E∣steem and made almost necessary to my Way of Living  They were not Men indeed whom I ever ad∣mired for a ready Turn of Wit or the Vivari∣ty of their Conversation which to say Truck are but the Embellishments of a good Under∣standing and serve rather to divert and  than to indear us to one another It is for this Reason that in the large Commerce I have had with Mankind it has been my Way to prefer Men of steady Judgment even Tem∣pers cool and indolent Complexions to those of excessive Smartness Humour and Repar¦tee there being something in the constant So¦ciety of the latter that loosens and unhing  the Mind from the more serious Offices of Life and at the same Time keeps it upon  Stretch in idle and unprofitable Pursuits  Trusty  on this as well as many other Accou  has ever preserved the first Place in my Af¦fections Living himself in this Neighbour¦hood be in a great Measure determined  to the Choice of it and to him I have left th  Naming of Two or Three Companions wi  whom I may in an innocent Chearfulness  the Remainder of my Time Th  first he introduced to me is a Clergyman of a∣bout Sixty who it seems has passed Thirty Years of his Life on a moderate Preferment in the Country without ever solliciting or desiring a Removal His Children are grown up and by his good Management provided for He has been for some Time a Widower and being very much worn with the constant Duties of his Function was with Difficulty prevailed on to leave a Curate on his Benefice and come up to Town where his eldest Daughter is settled and with whom he now lives My Friend tells me That he was never known to have a Law Suit or Difference with any of his Parishioners That he was ever making up Quarrels and doing good Offices in the Neighbourhood That he had been often left sole Guardian to Orphans and discharged his Trust with the utmost Fidelity That he constantly visited the Sick and ha∣ving some Knowledge in Physick and the Composition of Medicines had assigned Part of his Income to that Use When he came first to the Place there was a Conventicle hard by which had drawn away most of the Peo∣ple from the Church but by the Exemplari∣  ess of his Life his great Hospitality for so  lender a Fortune and the Gentleness of his Nature joined with the Force of his Perswa∣  ons the People returned by Degrees the Dissenting Minister went off and the Barn  hey met in was applied to its proper Use  I was pleased with the Figure of the Man as  e came into my Room somewhat tall incli∣  ing to be lean his Hair grey of a fair but flo∣  d Complexion with a certain Sweetness and  mplicity in his Countenance  In our Conversation he seemed to shew that Sort of Diffidence which usually attends Men of the best Sense after having passed their Lives in Retirement Upon all Occasions he sub∣mitted with great Deference to me as one who had studied Humane Nature and atta  ∣ed to a perfect Knowledge of the World Af∣ter an Hour's Talk having industriously led him through several Subjects I found him to be of an excellent Understanding cultiva∣ted by the Knowledge of the best Author of Antiquity and of a perfect good Taste to point out their Beauties Amongst the rest he shewed me many Instances of the Sublime in the Holy Writings which I had not heard any one before observe so that upon the Whole all the Difference I could find be∣tween us both in Point of knowing the World was that he had been chiefly conver∣sant with the best Part of it and I with the worst  This Day Sevennight in the Morning Mr  Trusty  presented me another new Acquain∣tance  "Mr  Bickerstaff  says he this is Dr I know you will be pleased with one another"  Having never heard the Name before I concluded him not very emi∣nent in his Profession He had no Haste in his Countenance and sate with me above two Hours without any visible Impatience to be going He appeared to have Abundance of good Nature without the sneaking mercenary Affectation of it and mentioned with Honour as many of his own Profession as are allowed to deserve it He received no Message all the while we were together and I observed par∣ticularly that he discoursed often as if he be∣lieved Revealed Religion We dined toge∣ther and he carved up a Pullet without read∣ing  a Lecture of Anatomy upon it He seem∣ed to be of a facetious Wit and after a few Glasses of Wine would now and then let off a Quibble without thinking it any Disparage∣ment to his Understanding I took the first Opportunity to enquire of my Friend into the Character of this Gentleman whose Account was That he had many Years belonged to the Faculty that he was an admirable Scholar and very knowing in his Profession but be∣ing born a Gentleman and to a competent Fortune of his own he disdained the servile Ways of making Court to Nurses and Apothe∣caries and therefore his chief Practice lay a∣mong the Poor He never valued his Reputa∣tion equal to the Life of a Patient and often preserved the latter though by transgressing a∣gainst Form and Method He was once com∣ing into Business but lost it by perswading his Patients they were not sick and refusing their Fees  The other Mr  Trusty  has recommended to me is a young Gentleman under Twenty and a Nephew of his own His Person is graceful his Eyes quick and lively the Tone of his Voice agreeable his Look open affable and serene his Constitution vigorous and sanguine his Air Dress and Behaviour easy modest and unaffected He has been bred under the Care and Direction of his Uncle who I remember often used to say to me  "I will undertake  Isaac  to make this Boy have as much useful Knowledge at Nineteen as you or I have at Fifty"  This he has effected beyond what I could possibly have conceived and the Methods he has taken to do it shall hereafter in one or more of these Papers be communicated to the Publick In the mean Time it is an infinite Delight to me to find this young Man fre∣quently  making such just Observations as are in others the Result of long Experience to hear him reason closely without Prejudice Passion or Conceit at other Times to see him gay chearful and entertaining without run∣ning into indecent Liberty or straining for the Character of a Wit and upon all Occasions to observe in him a generous Detestation of every Thing that is base and unworthy an Integrity founded on good Sense and superior to every Temptation What inexpressible Pleasure must arise from the Reflection of having furnished the World with so extraordinary a Person who if his Merit does not hinder him may for half a Century in the highest Stations and most honourable Employments be of publick Im∣portance to the World  The Letter from  Drumstick  and  Trencher  of  Edenburgh  is received and shall shortly be ta∣ken into Consideration  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Febr  to  Tuesd Febr    From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  February  SItting last Night over a chearful Fire and a Glass of  Spanish  Wine with my Friend  Sa∣muel Trusty  I happened to say with a Free∣dom peculiar to our Manner of Conversing that I could not but admire our mutual Con∣stancy in the Friendship that had so long been between us  "Why 'tis right  Isaac  says he and I hope we may look upon it as an Argu∣ment of Virtue on both Sides For my own Part I do not remember that I ever wished my self from you when our Affairs would give us Leave to be together"  But this A∣greement says I is so far from being com∣mon in the World that if the Institution at  Dunmowe  were in Favour of Friendship as it is of Matrimony I am confident there are few besides our selves would have any Right to the  Pramium  "No says he and I remember a Story of two pretty remarkable Friends of our own Time that you remind me of on this Occasion They had lived some time about Town and being weary of mixed Company Noise and Impertinence agreed to retire where they might without Interruption en∣joy one another  Nottingham  was the Place resolved on but they had not continued  there a Week in close and constant Conversa∣tion before they grew insufferably sick of each other Some Third Person must be en∣gaged into their Relief and being acciden∣tally lodged in a House next the Gaol where a Cup of good Liquor was to be had they sent a Message to the Gaoler to tell him if he was at Leisure there were two Gentlemen that were alone would come and smoak a Pipe with him Being otherwise employed he sent his Excuse Upon which they went in Person and asked him If there was never an honest Highwayman in the House that would be glad of Company He told them he was quite out at present and that if it was to save their Lives he had no Body but an old Woman that was under Sentence of Death for exercising the Black Art and he was sure they would not take up with her He happened to be mistaken for they im∣mediately obtained Leave to go down into the Dungeon and there solaced themselves with Ale Brandy and the Society of this poor unfortunate Creature till within two Hours of her Execution'  What a Levity of Mind is this that will not suffer us to acquiesce in the most reasonable Enjoyments of Life What a Want of Princi∣ple Reflection and ordinary Resolution As one every Day sees the wretched Effects of this viciated Taste in Conversation Dress and Be∣haviour I for my own Part am made more particularly sensible of them in the Prosecution of this Work To say as much as is proper on the same Subject is wearing it out as they call it and a Half Sheet without Four or Five Breaks has a dull heavy Look and is offensive to the Eyes of curious Readers so that for  their Relief more than my own I am forced sometimes to diversify my Paper by dating it from several Parts of the Town or else which is my present Case to call in the As∣sistance of such Correspondents as come first to Hand  To Mr  Isaac Bickerstaff  alias  Saturday  Two of the Clock  SIR  I Think it not of much Consequence whe∣ther your  Isaacship  be real or assumed much less whether the Papers you publish are your own or chiefly raised by Contribu∣tion from able Hands As to the first of these Objections I confess for my own Part that I am not the less diverted or instructed by a Fable for knowing that it is such but have often found my self bettered and entertained by the imaginary Conversations of  Chanti∣cleer  and  Reynard  the Fox For the other if you are as little fond of Praise as a good and wise Man ought to be you will content your self with being in any Sort the Instrument of doing a Service to Mankind without ex∣pecting or desiring their Applause for it Though perhaps it may hereafter reflect some Honour on your Name that in an Age when Wit and Learning were at a great Height in this Kingdom you were admitted to a De∣gree of Intimacy with the Top Genius's of it and at the same Time had so much Regard to the Publick as always to prefer their Wri∣tings to your own To tell you the Truth I am at present more sollicitous about the Existence of another Person than that of Mr  Bickerstaff  and would enquire very seri∣ously of you Whether there be really any  such young Gentleman in the World as is described in the  Tatler  of this Day I confess my self very much enamour'd with the Copy if I may so speak and will venture to offer my eldest Daughter who is young beautiful and virtuous with Eight thousand Pounds Sterling for the Original Rather than fail I would stretch hard for the other Two but I conjure you Sir not to make this Letter publick which if you answer privately and to my Satisfaction by the PennyPost I will afterwards meet either your self or wh  you shall depute to talk further on this Af∣fair My true Name shall be a Secret till I hear from you In the mean Time give me Leave to be  Your most humble Servant Under that of  W Wealthy  Please to direct to me at  Lindert  's Choco∣latehouse in  KingStreet  near  BloomsburySquare  The  Alias  on the Cover of this Letter the Omission of my Title on the same as well as some Passages in the said Letter leave me at full Liberty to treat both that and the Writer of it in what Manner I please And I do here∣by give Notice That I will hereafter neither answer read open nor receive nor suffer to be answered read opened nor received any Letter or Pacquet otherwise directed than to  Isaac Bic∣kerstaff  Esq  c  according to the Order by me formerly issued on that Behalf  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  CharingCross  Febr  SIR  I Am a Gentleman of the Broad Sword and desire to be heard before your Honour touching a Point that nearly concerns mine which is this Being in Company this Even∣ing with a Youth of more than ordinary Fire he observed my Nose to be somewhat larger than his upon which he took a Dislike to my Face and towards the End of the Night could not forbear telling me that he thought it an Affront to thrust the said Nose into civil Com∣pany Without giving me Leave to answer for so inoffensive a Member he instantly drew and took off a Piece of it at once that reduced it to the Size of his own This I re∣turned with so sound a Blow that swelled his to the Bigness of mine before its Amputation Now Sir the Question is Whether I may not in  Honour  cut off his Nose in its present Cir∣cumstances for the same Reason he did mine before A speedy Decision whereof will oblige me to be for ever  Your most obedient Servant  Tho Huff  Ordered That a Caustick be forthwith ap∣plied to the Nose of the Defendant there to remain for the Space of Four Hours and that the Plaintiff do attend the Operation three Days after which he the said Defendant is hereby summoned to appear in Court there further to answer for the Offence by him com∣mitted before his Peers of the HorseGuards  The TATLER N  o    Praetextatos referunt Artaxata Mores  Juv  From  Tuesday Febr  to  Thursd Febr    From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  February  IT is now something more than three Weeks since I issued forth my Order for the Ele∣ction of Rural Censors throughout every Parish in the Kingdom of  Great Britain  This in most Places has been punctually observed and with great Regularity and Order but in others it has produced Discord Division and Tumult The last Post brought me an Ac∣count from  Smallworth Wiltshire  That there were actually Two Censors chosen for the  me Parish who upon all Occasions una∣voidably clash and interfere with each other At  Bri  ewell  in  Hampshire  very indirect Pra∣ctices have been made Use of and a Person elected that had not lived Two Days in the Place A bad Effect this of a most useful In∣stitution If Churchwardens and Sidesmen are thus open to Corruption where is Justice and Integrity to be found The Love of Power is without Doubt very natural to us all and there are many Temptations in the Office of a Censor to justifie the Desire of at∣taining  to it But to pursue this Ambition through unwarrantable Means is in my O∣pinion no less absurd than criminal because it defeats the very Purpose we have in View and at once disqualifies us for the Employ∣ment we affect It is a Violence to my Na∣ture to act any Thing that is rigid and se∣vere but I very much question whether I shall not be shortly obliged to do exem∣plary Justice on the aforementioned Ac∣count I have now under Consideration a great Number of Complaints from several Parts of the Kingdom which in due Time shall be laid before the Publick As for those Gentlemen who have been duly elected to so weighty a Post I shall always treat them with a Regard due to their Character and as the following Remonstrance came first to my Hands it does of Course claim Precedency of all others  Fatland  Febr  Honoured Sir  YOur Order dated the th of  Janua∣ry  came to Hand the th of the same Month and within the Time by you limited the Churchwardens and Sides∣men of this our Parish of  Fatland  repair∣ed to the Vestry thereunto belonging and having debated for the Space of Three Quarters of an Hour without Eating or Drinking all that Time they did then and there chuse elect and nominate me  John Hart  Gent to act in full Power and Au∣thority as Rural Censor of the said Pa∣rish and did notify the same to me by  Jeremiah Solfa  Clerk of the said Parish who by Order of the said Church war∣dens and Sidesmen having first washed  his Hands and Face attended me to the Vestry in Form and Manner by them pre∣scribed where being introduced and the Door shut they did unanimously vote pronounce and declare me the said  John Hart  to be from and after the Time then being Rural Censor for the said Parish of  Fat∣land  and accordingly entered this their Act and Deed in a Book provided for that Purpose  I am very sensible Honoured Sir how unworthy I am to represent so great a Man as your self in so high a Station having little more to brag of than the Honesty of my Intentions and a hearty Desire to be serviceable to my Country I will be bold to say that no Body shall outdo me in those Points whatever they may in some others Since I have come into Employment it has been my whole Business to observe and remark careful∣ly the Behaviour of my Fellow Parishio∣ners which is for the most Part as I could wish I was always well esteemed among them but upon this Preferment I am in a Manner worshipped I have already been invited to Two Christenings and several Junketings which I hope will be no Re∣flection upon my Character having heard that you your self Sir will take a chir∣ping Cup upon Occasion I shall endea∣vour to imitate you in all Things though I am apt to think I shall hardly ever write so well as you do not but I have had some Education and might by this Time have been a pretty Scholar if my Father had not wanted me in the Sta∣bles and for that Reason taken me from School As I was saying Sir I am migh∣tily  respected at present and very often dine with the best Gentleman in the Pa∣rish in whose Family I have observed some Matters which I think it my Duty to acquaint you with His eldest Daughter Mrs  Susan  and his second Son Mr  B  ∣naby  who had before lived altogether in the Country have been up at  London  Three Weeks of this Winter and by the Improvements they have made there are become a Trouble to the whole Neigh∣bourhood The young Lady takes upon her to laugh at every Thing and every Body that comes in her Way and is ever and anon twitting the good Lady her Mo∣ther with having never seen any Thing of the World I believe if the Truth were known she has invented Fifty Foole∣ries in her Dress on Purpose to bring 'em into Fashion and in Process of Time make the whole County ridiculous The very Heels of her Shoes are laced her Head not above an Inch high she has Stuff enough in her Petticoat to cloath all her Brothers and Sisters and at the same Time is naked her self half Way down her Back I observed t'other Day a little Spoon in her SnuffBox and could not help ask∣ing her Whether she hid it there upon a Report we had lately about calling in the Plate  The young Gentleman is to the full as bad in his Way His Cloaths are intole∣rably apish and fantastical and he will face us down that a Thousand of the same Make were seen on Her Majesty's BirthDay He has brought down a Set of new Words to the great Confusion of common  Conversation and pretends that he had them from the Top Wits of the Age He talks of Plays Opera's and Assemblies as he calls 'em to every Farmer he meets and instead of the Queen and Church makes all his Father's Tenants toast the charming Dutchess of upon their Knees These and many other Grievances of the same Kind are in these young Gen∣tlefolks the Effects of having seen the World which as in Duty bound I hum∣bly offer to your Consideration and remain  Honoured Sir  Your most Obedient And most Dutiful Deputy and Servant  John Hart  The TATLER N  o    Non possum ferre Quirites  Graecam Urbem  Juv  From  Thursd Febr  to  Saturd Febr    From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  February  IT is certain that most of our Errors whe∣ther in Conversation or Conduct are ow∣ing to Want of Reflection and a right Way of Thinking The Privilege of applying our Fa∣culties that Way is the noblest Distinction of our Nature and of the last Consequence to the Regulation of our Lives This I do not offer as a new Observation but only as the general Neglect of it and at the same Time the Impor∣tance of its being rightly understood make it necessary to be put often in our Way What∣ever Improvements or Acquisitions we make without this Foundation are but superficial and Ornamental at best and will never support us through any Figure or Character in the World For which Reason when the Business of the Day and the innocent Entertainments of the Evening are at an End I constantly set apart an Hour at least to descend into my self to weigh and examine my past Behaviour and the Principles I have acted upon The little Lei∣sure  I thus steal from the Publick is returned to them by endeavouring to become more perfect in the several Relations I bear to Mankind  In this Manner I was employing my Thoughts some Nights ago when going towards my Window I heard a Watchman in the Street cry  Past Twelve of the Clock and a Moonlight Morning  Another who came just after him called the same Hour  and a cloudy Morning  He who had declared himself first thinking his Veracity in Question turned round in some Anger and in a low sullen Voice gave the o∣ther the Lie Words were multiplied upon it and Blows followed I immediately threw up my Sash and had Authority enough to part them For my own Part I looked upon it to be a very bright Sky and therefore gave the Fellow a Reprimand that had pronounced it otherwise But when he assured me that at the very Instant he did so a Cloud was just co∣ming over the Moon the Cause was puzzled and I did not know justly where to lay the Blame However having made up the Mat∣ter I pulled down my Window and retired to Bed Before I fell asleep I could not help re∣flecting on the Oddness of this Dispute and to make it of some Use to my self resolved I would never more engage in Controversy with Mr  Powell  or any other Person  Soon after I happened to have some Tryal of my Temper for amongst other Letters I re∣ceived that which follows from my old Adver∣sary Mr  Powell  SIR  I Presume you will be convinced by this that in attacking me you have ventured upon one who is something more than your Match having lately had the Honour to fur∣nish the House in the  Haymarkes  with half a Dozen of my Seas tack'd together and a Sail of weatherbeaten Ships for the Opera of Et  This I had never mentioned but that the Persons concerned therein have had the Assurance to make frequent Use of Four hun∣dred Yards and upwards of my old Waves without so much as quoting me in the Mar∣gin  Your humble Servant  Powell  I could not but be much surprized at so ex∣traordinary an Account and doubting the Truth of it went  incognito  the next Night to the House where I found my Correspondent had but too good Grounds for triumphing over me in the Manner he had done  After being heartily tired with the First Act I had Leisure to consider the extraordinary Re∣ception of these Foreign Entertainments and the Discouragement of our own Musick I could no otherwise account for it than by ha∣ving Recourse to a certain Journal that had a little before fallen into my Hands in which I find that on the First of  November  last the House of Ladies came to this Resolution  Resolved That Mr  Waller  never writ a good Song That Mr  Clayton  cannot set one no  Mrs  Tofts  sing one  In this Debate I am told they all spoke and all at once so it being impossible for them to know what each other said I could never learn the Reasons that induced that honourable House to pass so cruel a Vote Two are chiefly al∣ledged without Doors to justify this Severity The First is That our Language is so uncooth as not to be endured and calculated only for Acts of Parliament The Gentleman that made this Objection appeared at my Court Yester∣day where being tried for Slander after ha∣ving made a smooth Defence in the  English  Tongue he was found guilty and sentenced to speak no other Words than  Otway  and  Waller  for the  Space  of Nine Days as likewise to tran∣slate the  Mira  of Mr  G  into  HighDutch  The Second Reason which is the Want of Performers has been pressed to me with all As∣surance of Success But the Persons who pre∣sumed so far upon a very solemn Trial were found guilty also by a very fair Jury sentenced to beg Mrs  Tofts  's and Mr  Leveridge  's Pardon upon their Knees and fined One thousand Pound each for the Use of the Queen of  Cyprus  whose Treasures are exhausted and her Terri∣tories invaded I who am advanced in Years and have neither Leisure nor Application for the Attainment of a Language I as yet know little of have more than ordinary Reason to be apprehensive of its encroaching too far up∣on us Should it universally prevail I am in a Manner debarred the Commerce of Mankind and my Lucubrations of Course fall to the Ground I could wish it were further conside∣red how great Sufferers a considerable Part of my FellowSubjects would be if we took away only the Use of a few Words and whether any that can be substituted in their Stead  would make Amends for the Loss As for In∣stance you deprive the Lover of  Angel Goddess Cupid Charms Darts Flames Fire

the Politician of  Ballance of Power Limited Monarchy Hereditary Right Church State Ministry  Most of the Coffeehouses would break and even that of St  James  's be very thin  After all I am credibly informed by some of the Royal Society that there is something in the Formation of a Tramontane Ear that will not suffer it to relish the Softness of  Italian  Airs and further that Sound it self at so ma∣ny Degrees Northward was never known to come to perfect Maturity Only that of Drums Trumpets Hautboys and here and there as much of the Vocal as will serve to keep a pri∣vate Family in Order being of our own Growth and agreeing tolerably well with the Climate  For my Sentiments of Musick in General fitly introduced and in its proper Circumstan∣ces I leave them to be expressed by  Shake∣speare  wanting Words of my own for that Oc∣casion  Antonio  in the  Jew of Venice  speaks thus to  Bassanio  O Bassanio  There sits a Heaviness upon my Heart  Which Wine cannot remove I know not  But Musick ever makes me thus  Bass  The Reason is your Spirits are attenti    For do but note a wild and wanton Herd  Or Race of skittish and unhandled Colts  Fetching mad Bounds bellowing and neighing loud  If

observable of Men of base Extraction and low Education that when they have any Thing in them of what the World calls good Sense they turn it wholly to the getting of Money They have but that one Point in View and consequently overlook all either difficult or indirect Ways which lead to it  If they attain their End and become rich toward their middle Age before they decline in Years and decay in Strength and that their Appetite of Getting is not yet turned into an Avarice of Hoarding if they have any Fire re∣maining they commonly feel themselves war∣med with a Kind of Ambition of being Some∣body as well as Something They find a Want of that Respect which they observe to be paid to such who are called Gentlemen and Persons of Condition though of small Fortunes They would give any Consideration to be of an honourable Descent and alter the Spelling of their Names to bring them on as near as pos∣sible  to some Name or Seat of Antiquity If that cannot be brought about they push for a Knighthood or an Alliance with some Family of Name or Title whose Follies or Misfortunes have reduced them to match themselves or Children to Money however basely lodged or infamously obtained  I fell into this Reflection after a Visit made me some Days since by one whom I remember to have known a LinkBoy and who has often lighted me formerly from the  GreenDragon  in  Fleetstreet  to my Lodgings in  Sheerlane  We used to call him  Foundling  a Name given him by his Godfather the Parish and which he has not yet been able to part with or vary though he has found the Secret to be worth very near what they call a Plumb and upon  'Change  has obtained the Appellation of a good Man He came to me with much Frankness owning both his past and present Circumstances but what made me smile was the Request he made me to accompany him to a House in our Row where lives one  Randall  as he called him  a Creature Merchant  This Person is a great Vir∣tuoso and deals in Birds and Beasts though not either as a Butcher or Poulterer for he nourishes nothing that is eatable nor ever ut∣ters any Commodity but while it is alive  As we walked towards this Virtuoso's Habi∣tation which I may call an Abridgment of the Ark my Friend  Foundling  told me  "He had purchased a fair Seat in the Country That he had a Mind to appear well in the World and since he had a Gentleman's Estate he would endeavour to have every Thing sui∣table to it That he had bargained already with the Herald's College for a Coat of Arms and that his present Errand to  Ran∣dall  's was from among his Variety of Ani∣mals  to fancy himself a Crest in which he mightily desired my Assistance and Approba∣tion"  I was delighted with the Folly and Frankness of the Man but it happened he saw nothing that pleased him As we returned I advised him to an honest homebred Crest out of his own Farmers Yard which was a Cock's Head untrim'd with the Gills and Comb en∣tire This he approved and took his Leave I was about to reflect on what had pass'd when suddenly returning he called to me and co∣ming nearer told me he would let me into all his Project and desired I would step with him to a Waterman's House hard by where he had lodged a Set of Ancestors which were to go up next Tide to his Seat upon the River He desired my Judgment of the Choice he had made of Three Generations to furnish his Par∣lor I went with him not readily compre∣hending what he meant till we enter'd the House where he explained to me that at  FleetDitch  he had bought the Pictures of Three Men and Three Women which were suited well enough to each other and were to personate his Family up to his GreatGrand∣father and GreatGrandmother which he thought was pretending far enough for one who was in Truth related to no Body that he knew of in the World As I was extremely diverted with the Oddness and Extravagance of the Man's Fancy I was no less satisfied with his Judgment in the Choice of the Pictures the Habits and Dispositions of the Figures be∣ing suited to Three different Periods and Fa∣shions of Time and concluding or rather be∣ginning in the GreatGrandfather and GreatGrandmother with a Pair of TrunkHose a Ruff and a Farthingale I pleased him with my Approbation and took Leave of him en∣tertaining  my self often since with the Re¦flections which naturally arise from the Con¦templation of Vanity Wealth and titular

upon our Climate but I question whether there be n  t  ome Affectation at the Bottom I know not  short how it happens but whilst we give a  oose to all our other Passions that of Love in  he proper Sense of it is made the Subject of Ridicule and in a great Measure laughed out of Countenance by the Gentlemen of Wit and Pleasure about Town  Bellaria  in vain is  oung beautiful and Genteel  Cleora  of an  dmirable Temper an easy modest Behaviour and a Person perfectly agreeable The Success of their Charms is no more than to be ogled at the  Opera  toasted at the Tavern and forgot∣ten the next

never s  ¦fered himself to be tainted with the Bitterne  of a Party he preserves an universal Cand  and a Profusion of Benevolence for Mankind  general  This Gentleness of Nature has sometim  put him

give me Leave in Behalf of a poor despairing Creature to beg your most seri∣ous and tender Consideration My Sister  the unfortunate  Fidelia  the best the softest and the fairest of her Sex is even now on the Brink of Distraction Her Perplexity is beyond all Example and indeed the Occasion of it very extraordinary It is now Three Years and upwards since Two young Gen∣tlemen of Birth and Fortune who had lived together in the strictest Friendship became Rivals on her Account Both so equally me∣rited her Esteem that for some Time she knew not on which to bestow her Love The one was of an open Behaviour warm in his Pretensions but not over constant in his Application the other close assiduous and importunate However it happened she was at last determined in Favour of the lat∣ter and with a Heart never before engaged in an Affair of this Kind gave at once into all the Softnesses and Indearments of it  Po∣lydor  if I may so call the neglected Lover now found himself but coldly received yet with an unexpected Evenness of Temper con∣tinued still to visit my Sister upon the Foot of a Friend a Platonick or what else she would please to call him In the mean Time the Father of  Castalio  his Rival had some Intimation given him of his Intrigue and that he intended to marry  Fidelia  whose Fortune tho' better than Six thousand Pounds was by no Means answerable to what he proposed for his Son Without taking any further Notice he sent for him and having a considerable Estate at  Fort St George  in the  EastIndies  made the Care of that a Pre∣tence for dispatching him thither In short  Fidelia  and he were forced to part with a Flood of Tears and the usual Vows to each other Two Years almost past before any Thing was heard of him then came the  News of his Death confirmed by so many Hands and such particular Circumstances that there was no Room to doubt the Truth of it  Polydor  all this while had gone on in the same Road of an innocent Acquaintance with my Sister and as she ever preserved a good Respect for him now under her Af∣fliction she found the Use of his Friendship Who could so properly condole with her the Loss of  Castalio  as the Man who had loved him beyond his own Quiet and Happiness To whom could she so freely communicate her Grief as to one who knew her Weakness and had long since forgiven her the cruelest Effects of it Thus Sir by mingling their Sorrows they fell insensibly into a Tender∣ness for each other His Flame revived with greater Violence than ever and she on a sud∣den wonder'd at the Progress she had made before she well knew where she was Con∣sidering her self as a Kind of Widow she re∣solved to continue such till a Twelvemonth was expired She did so and having appoin∣ted  Thursday  last for her Wedding Day just as she was going out she was met by  Casta∣lio  at the Door In the midst of Joy and Confusion she flew to him and fainted in his Arms What Measures good Mr  Bicker∣staff  can be taken in this Affair  Polydor  raves like a Madman walks the Streets with his Sword drawn and in case he is disap∣pointed threatens Destruction to all about him  Castalio  bewails  Fidelia  and himself commiserates his Friend and upbraids his Father that had intercepted his Letters and purchased of several  Irish  Men the Report of his Death But my Sistershe alas is lost to all Reason and if she were not the Truth is I have none to offer upon this  Emergency Instruct me dear Sir but to mitigate her Afflictions and you shall find me from that Moment a more chearful Cor∣respondent and upon all Occasions  Your most Obedient Most Humble Servant  Fidelio  The Case of  Fidelia  as well as that of the Pretenders to her is indeed very deplorable and the more so because having carefully per∣used the Records belonging to the  Court of Ho∣nour  I cannot from thence inform my self how to proceed or in whom to vest the Right of her Person However if necessary a Special Verdict may be had without much Trouble or Expence In the mean Time to speak upon it in an extrajudicial Way if the Lady happens to be of the  Romish  Persuasion I advise her to a Nunnery if not and she be qualified as her Brother has represented I know a certain old Gentleman who will be well enough pleased to take her off with all her Misfortunes and Infir∣mities about her By having frequent Oppor∣tunities of instilling the Precepts of Philosophy he

Temper and excellent Judgment in it is not to be forgotten which was  "That if he who re∣proach'd him had once been a Carrier he would have been a Carrier still"  To descend yet to a more modern Instance my Friend  U∣riah Pattern  by Profession a Salesman in the  Strand  who sold me my last Purple Bays Gown has a Son whom he bound to himself that he might learn to make Clothes but he it seems was only born to wear 'em I cannot say that he appears addicted by Nature either to Arts or Arms being of the Beau Species and giving daily Indications of a Smart Fellow The Symptoms broke out early

Callicoes with a particular Air of Scorn Re∣gret and Indignation What the Catastrophe of this Character will be I am loth to deter∣mine but there seems to be some present Ma∣lignancy in his Stars His

advise him to entertain humble Thoughts to aim at being introduced into the Presence and by Degrees into the Favour of her  Abigail  the Possession of whom though not as a principal Remedy may yet as a  Suc∣cedaneum  prove effectual to his Recovery a Method very familiar to us in our Practice of Physick And who knows but the old Clothes and tarnished Habiliments together with the cast Airs and Secondhand Simagreex of the original Beauty may have a Virtue in them like that said to have been in  Achilles  Spear the Rust of which never failed to heal the Wounds it had made  This is what I

he was gone and young Master and my self had resumed our Entertainment having a King to finish who wanted only his Crown and a Pair of Hands I have since reflected with some Contempt on those who think that Wisdom consists in a constant Tenor of Gra∣vity and that they can never put off their Se∣riousness without breaking into their Cha∣racter How ill Judges such People are of hu∣mane Nature

from it fall insensibly asleep or doze over a Pint Men of great Ge∣nius naturally fall into these Trifles which at the same Time that they give Ease and Re∣spite to the Faculties serve to enliven in some  Degree and keep them in a gentle Motion This I take to have been the Ease of those great Men whose Examples I have produced and I am so far gone in this Opinion that I be∣lieve every Person understands the Art of Tri∣fling agreeably in Proportion to his Share of Wit and good Sense those who are defective in either being as incapable of doing it them∣selves as of relishing it in others The only In∣convenience is when Men in great or grave Stations are not cautious enough to distinguish before whom they give themselves a Liberty this Way  Will Moody  amongst many others has fur∣nished me with this Observation After much formal Advice against doing Things unsuitable to my Age and telling me how much it would have reflected upon me if any but a Friend had come in he added That he was mightily shocked some Time ago by a Person of Repu∣tation for Learning and Virtue that had enter∣tained him for half an Hour together with the Particularities of a PuppetShow which he carried his little Grandson to see the Night be∣fore The Truth is such sow and groveling Spirits as these have some Reason for their Censure who possessing no good Qualities able to gain or to raise Esteem should not presume to act a Part that would serve only to make 'em ridiculous A Man who hopes to establish his Character and Fortune by the Solemnity of his Countenance would be in the Wrong to part with it upon every slight Occasion Should he once deviate from the Road he is in he knows not where it might end nor how to recover his Mistake Even a Smile might be of dan∣gerous Consequence and therefore he arms himself with an impregnable Gravity against all the Fooleries and Gaieties that may happen in his Way  Democritulus  is equally a Coxcomb though of a very different Mould He laughs for Laughing's Sake in the wrong Place and is a Trifler upon all Occasions In Pursuit of this Humour he regards neither Time Person nor Circumstance but lays about him without Distinction and is a Kind of  Drawcansir  in Conversation His nearest Acquaintance and their tenderest Concerns are the Subjects of his Wit and Ridicule and he seems to value himself for nothing more than for having got the better of Modesty good Manners and Humanity How an Inclination to Raillery may betray one into Offences of this Kind I must produce my self as an Instance and as the following Letter has awakened

Remissness fall short of it But nothing  effectually defeats us in this Pursuit than  wrong Estimate of our selves either in Point  f the good Qualities we pretend to or of the  tuation in Life that Fortune has assign'd us  Want of due Attention to either of these Circumstances will unavoidably betray us into  requent Miscarriages in our Conduct some∣  es lay us open to Envy at others to Con∣  empt and in the End eclipse even that Merit  are really Masters of From this Conside∣  tion when I was a very young Fellow how∣  er desirous I might be of being distinguished  the World I kept a strict Guard upon my  anity resolved to content my self with pas∣  ng through the ordinary Forms and Methods  f rising into Repute and at due Distance of  Time took my several Degrees in Conversa∣tion At first setting out it was my constant Rule to pay a Deference to as many as had any Pretence to it to smile modestly when they were pleased to be facetious and often stand their Raillery without offering to return it It was not without some Difficulty that I got this Mastery of my self in Spight of which towards the latter End of an Evening I now and then made an imprudent Sally and endea∣voured to be as sprightly as my Betters but as it happened I never said a good Thing over Night that was invidiously remember'd the next Morning The Truth is the Smallness of my Fortune laid some Restraint upon my Ge∣nius I seldom rightly enjoyed my self till the Reckoning was paid and by this Means my Gaiety begun when that of other People was at an End At length by an habitual Dulness and other innocent Arts in my Behaviour I worked my self into the Esteem of my Ac∣quaintance and in something more than four Years was allowed to be one of the Company Then it was that I began to exert my Talents and by assuming every Day more and more at length established an indisputable Authority in the World Though the Impatience and Fire of Youth may suggest otherwise these are certainly the Steps that lead safely to consum∣mate Greatness in whatever Form or Profession we aspire after it  I am indeed of Opinion that some Years of our Lives are in a Manner thrown away and lost by Means of a wrong Education which nothing has more effectually convinced me of than the great and early Improvements that my Friend  Sam Trusty  's Nephew mentioned in one of my former Papers has made under the particular Care and Direction of his Uncle  But till the same Method can be brought into general Practice we must e'en take the World as we find it we must submit to the Rules universally received and instead of weighing our own Merits abstractedly consider them as they are placed in Relation to and Dependance upon those about us Amongst other Grada∣tions necessary to be observed in Life there is one which for the Benefit of those who come Strangers to this City I cannot but take No∣tice of that of Coffeehouses I mean the Violation of which may otherwise lead them into many Inconveniencies and Indecorums The following Letter which came to Hand this Evening has partly occasioned this Re∣  ection  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Friday Morning  SIR  I Came to Town with my Sister last Night by the  Reading  Coach and having both of us a great Longing to see Colonel who quarter'd formerly at my Father's House we prevailed upon the Coachman to drive directly to  White  's ChocolateHouse in St  James  's  street  which was the Place he told us to enquire at for him if ever we came to  London  We both alighted and went in 'tis true I was somewhat ashamed to see so much fine Company and the more so be∣cause my Sister who is always sick in a Coach had but a little before pewk'd upon my Clothes However the Place I suppose is free for any Body and for all their Silver and Gold Lace perhaps I had as much Mo∣ney in my Pocket as the best of 'em They were civil enough to her that's true but  they all laughed out at me and an ugly lame Rogue there was ready to shove me out at the Door and told me I was mistaken in the House If you think this to be good Manners I have no more to say if not I don't see why you should not take Notice of it You have put foolisher Things in your Paper but whether you do or no I am resolved I'll go thither every Day whilst I am in Town and shew 'em that I am not so much a Put but that I can say bo to a Goose  W L  There seems to be a true  English  Spirit in the Resentment of my Correspondent but if I might advise he should let this Matter rest for the present In less than three Winters I will un∣dertake he shall be able to look the Enemy in the Face provided he lives regular and takes the Measures I prescribe There is scarce any Part of the Town so destitute where he may not find out a little Coffeehouse to drink a Cup of Sage in every Morning and peruse the  Tatler  as often as it comes out Here I confine him for Two Months If in that Time he can compass to have a Place kept for him by the Fire to talk without being contradicted and to read my Paper to the Company he shall then by Vertue of a Pass from  Charles Lillie  be allowed the Liberty of the  Rainbow  near  TempleBar  there to continue till the Booksel∣lers thereabouts have found him out for a Wit and employed him in some Libel against the late or present Ministry He will of Course pass afterwards to the  Grecian  and may if he thinks fit call in at  Tom  's in  DevereuxCourt  It will by this Time be proper that he should make himself a new Suit of Clothes I could  wish they might not be too gay which will by no Means become a Person whom I am con∣ducting through the World According to the best Calculation I can make he will by  De∣cember  the th  Anno Domini  arrive at  Will  's where if he is capable of further Im∣provement he may soon furnish himself with good Sense Politicks and good Manners e∣nough to carry him through the rest of his Journey and set him upon an equal Foot with the  Inhabitants  of St  James  's Coffeehouse  White  's or the  CocoaTree  N B  If Mr  W L  will please to acquaint the Censor where he may be spoken with  Charles Lillie  to prevent his being imposed on shall be ordered to wait on him with a Table containing

THose inferior Duties of Life which the  French  call  les petite Morale  or the smal∣ler Morals are with us distinguished by the Name of good Manners or Breeding This I look upon in the general Notion of it to be a Sort of artificial good Sense adapted to the meanest Capacities and introduced to make Mankind easy in their Commerce with each o∣ther Low and little Understandings without some Rules of this Kind would be perpetually wandring into a Thousand Indecencies and Ir∣regularities in Behaviour and in their ordinary Conversation fall into the same boisterous Fa∣miliarities that one observes amongst them when a Debauch has quite taken away the Use of their Reason In other Instances it is odd to consider that for Want of common Discre∣tion the very End of good Breeding is wholly perverted and Civility intended to make us easy is employed in laying Chains and Fet∣ters upon us in debarring us of our Wishes  and in crossing our most reasonable Desires and Inclinations This Abuse reigns chiefly in the Country as I found to my Vexation when I was last there in a Visit I made to a Neigh∣bour about Two Miles from my Cousin As soon as I enter'd the Parlour they forced me into the great Chair that stood close by a huge Fire and kept me there by Force till I was al∣most stifled Then a Boy came in great Hurry to pull off my Boots which I in vain opposed urging that I must return soon after Dinner In the mean Time the good Lady whispered her eldest Daughter and slipped a Key into her Hand She returned instantly with a Beer Glass half full of  Aqua Mirabilis  and Syrrup of Gillyflowers I took as much as I had a Mind for but Madam vowed I should drink it off for she was sure it would do me Good after coming out of the cold Air and I was forced to obey which absolutely took away my Sto∣mach When Dinner came in I had a Mind to sit at a Distance from the Fire but they told me it was as much as my Life was worth and set me with my Back just against it Tho' my Appetite was quite gone I resolved to force down as much as I could and desired the Leg of a Pullet Indeed Mr  Bickerstaff  says the Lady you must eat a Wing to oblige me and so put a Couple upon my Plate I was persecuted at this Rate during the whole Meal As often as I called for Small Beer the Master tipped the Wink and the Servant brought me a Brimmer of  October  Some Time after Din∣ner I ordered my Cousin's Man who came with me to get ready the Horses but it was resol∣ved I should not stir that Night and when I seemed pretty much bent upon going they or∣dered the Stable Door to be locked and the Children hid away my Cloak and Boots The  next Question was what I would have  Supper I said I never eat any Thing at Nigh  but was at last in my own Defence obliged t  name the first Thing that came into my Head  After Three Hours spent chiefly in Apology fo  my Entertainment insinuating to me  "Tha  this was the worst Time of the Year for Pro∣visions that they were at a great Distance from any Market that they were afraid I should be starved and they knew they kept me to my Loss"  the Lady went and left me to her Husband for they took special Care I should never be alone As soon as her Back was turned the little Misses ran backwards and forwards every Moment and constantly as they came in or went out made a Courtefie directly at me which in good Manners I was forced to return with a Bow and  Your humble Servant pretty Miss  Exactly at Eight the Mo∣ther came up and discovered by the Redness of her Face that Supper was not far off It was twice as large as the Dinner and my Per∣secution doubled in Proportion I desired at my usual Hour to go to my Repose and was conducted to my Chamber by the Gentleman his Lady and the whole Train of Children They importuned me to drink something be∣fore I went to Bed and upon my refusing at last left a Bottle of  Stingo  as they called it for Fear I should wake and be thirsty in the Night I was forced in the Morning to rise and dress my self in the Dark because they would not suffer my Kinsman's Servant to disturb me at the Hour I had desired to be called I was now resolved to break through all Measures to get away and after sitting down to a mon∣strous Breakfast of cold Beef Mutton Neats Tongues Venison Pasty and Stale Beer took Leave of the Family but the Gentleman would  needs see me Part of my Way and carry me a short Cut through his own Grounds which he told me would save half a Mile's Riding This last Piece of Civility had like to have cost me dear being once or twice in Danger of my Neck by leaping over his Ditches and at last forced to alight in the Dirt when my Horse having slip'd his Bridle ran away and took us up more than an Hour to recover him a∣gain  It is evident that none of the Absurdities I met with in this Visit proceeded from an ill Intention but from a wrong Judgment of Complaisance and a Misapplication of the Rules of it I cannot so easily excuse the more refined Criticks upon Behaviour who having professed no other Study are yet infinitely de∣fective in the most material Parts of it  Ne  Fashion  has been bred all his Life about Court and understands to a Tittle all the Punctilio's of a DrawingRoom He visits most of the fine Women near St  James  's and upon all Oc∣casions says the civilest and softest Things to them of any Man breathing To Mr  Isaac  he owes an easie Slide in his Bow and a graceful Manner of coming into a Room But in some other Cases he is very far from being a well∣bred Person He laughs at Men of far superior Understanding to his own for not being as well dressed as himself despises all his Ac∣quaintance that are not Quality and in publick Places has on that Account often avoided ta∣king Notice of some of the best Speakers in the House of Commons He rails strenuously at both Universities before the Members of either and never is heard to swear an Oath or break in upon Morality or Religion but in the Com∣pany of Divines On the other Hand a Man of right Sense has all the Essentials of good  Breeding though he may be wanting in the Forms of it  Horatio  has spent most of his Time at  Oxford  He has a great deal of Learning an agreeable Wit and as much Modesty as serves to adorn without concealing his other good Qualities In that retired Way of Living he seems to have formed a Notion of humane Na∣ture as he has found it described in the Wri∣tings of the greatest Men not as he is like to meet with it in the common Course of Life Hence it is that he gives no Offence that he converses with great Deference Candor and Humanity His Bow I must confess is some∣what aukward but then he has an extensive universal and unaffected Knowledge which makes some Amends for it He would make no extraordinary Figure at a Ball but I can as∣sure the Ladies in his Behalf and for their own Consolation that he has writ better Verses on the Sex than any Man now living and is pre∣paring such a Poem for the Press as will trans∣mit their Praises and his own to many Genera∣tions  The TATLER N  o    Dii Majorum Umbris tenuem sine Pondere Ter∣ram  Spirantesque Crocos in Urna perpetuum Ver  Qui Praeceptorem sancti voluere Parentis  Esse Loco  Juv  From  Tuesday Mar  to  Thursday Mar    From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  March  THE Concern I have for the Errors of Mankind in general does sensibly abate or increase in Proportion to the Rank and Quality of those who fall under my Observation For this Reason I can never suffer a Coronet to pass me without enquiring whom it belongs to and whether it be worn in a Manner suitable to so honourable a Distinction I can say with a great deal of Truth that I am commonly an∣swered to my Satisfaction When it happens otherwise I carry my Enquiry yet further and inform my self with the greatest Exactness ima∣ginable whether the Misfortune of Complexion or that of Education has chiefly contributed to eclipse the Lustre and defeat the Advantages of a high and noble Descent Many Failures I find chargeable on the former but they are not so numerous nor of so dangerous a Nature as  those which result from the latter being only such Tendencies of the Mind as by early Care and proper Application might have been culti∣vated and improved into useful and generous Qualifications It is therefore of the last Impor∣tance as well to the future Happiness of our young Nobility as to that of a Nation in great Measure depending on them that their Genius should be nicely observed their Capacity im∣proved and a right Turn given to their Under∣standing To effect this I have sometimes had it in my Head to write a Treatise with Dire∣ctions to Tutors or Governors in the Discharge of so weighty an Employment but being cre∣dibly informed that they were a Sort of People who had little Opinion of any Body's Wisdom but their own I was discouraged from that Undertaking and obliged to pursue other Measures I have within this Twelvemonth made a Coffeehouse Acquaintance with as ma∣ny of them as I could and now and then over a Dish of Tea enquired into the Schemes and Methods they have laid down for the Manage∣ment of their Pupils The first I happened up∣on is a grave sober and discreet Person turn∣ed of Fifty his Countenance somewhat formi∣dable and his Conversation extremely rigid and severe He has by some Means or other seen the Outsides of most of the Courts in  Eu∣rope  and got a Smattering in the Languages but having no Taste of polite Learning nor a∣ny Insight into humane Nature he is much better qualified to wait in an Anteroom or keep the Accounts of the Family he belongs to than to conduct the Hopes of it into the World He has often told me with great Pride and Sa∣tisfaction  "That he has his young Lord in as much Subjection as a Footboy That he of  Course denies him every Thing he has a Mind to and that in the Midst of his Diver∣sion he can make him tremble with a Frown"  Such is the Love of Tyranny in mean and nar∣row Spirits even in the lowest Circumstance of Power Another of them sets up for a fine Gentleman and is a Pedant in taking Pains to be otherwise He has a Notion that Letters are but a poor Accomplishment for a Man of Quality that a good Air and being furiously of a Party are sufficient Distinctions for one that is born to many others and therefore in∣dulges the Youth under his Care in an immo∣derate Love of Dogs Horses Plays Gallantry and all Manner of Entertainments At Lei∣sure Hours he flatters him with an Opinion of his Superiority to the common Level of Mankind and strictly cautions him against entertaining the least Regard for the Scum and Dregs of the People What a Patriot Hero and Counsellor may we hope for from so extraordinary an Education A Third whom I suffer indeed to visit me now and then seems to have a better Sense of his Duty in this Station than either of the others Knowing that I am a great Lover of Chil∣dren he one Day brought his Pupil who is very young to my Lodgings He had long promised him I found that he would carry him to wait upon Mr  Bickerstaff  and I do not remember that I was ever so well pleased with being pointed at in Publick as I was with the particular Survey this little Boy took of me After this Curiosity was pretty well over he seemed willing to enter into Conversation in which he acquitted himself with the utmost good Manners and a manly Turn of Wit very disproportioned to his Years I could perceive  he had a great Mind to be talking of the  Tat∣lers  and I on Purpose led him into it He made some very surprising Remarks upon several of them and with an agreeable Freedom ask'd me the Meaning of others that he did not under∣stand I begged his little Lordship to accept of the Volumes I had by me and in Return he desired my Leave to be a Subscriber for the next Ever now and then I had my Eye upon his Tutor and could perceive in him an inex∣pressible Pleasure for the good Behaviour of his Charge  I could not help taking him aside soon after and telling him that I almost envy'd him the Happiness of having so fine a Genius in his Hands  "Go on Sir says I to cultivate and improve it and by that Means be an Instru∣ment of publick Good to your Country You will never perhaps have it in your Power to act in a more meritorious Capacity Think only what a Pleasure it will be to you to see this young Gentleman hereafter at the Head of an Army or managing a Debate in the most illustrious Assembly in the World Be∣lieve me you will in a great Measure partake his Glory and act as it were by Proxy in whatever Station his Merit shall advance him to If I can form any Judgment of him at these Years you will from his future Grati∣tude and Esteem receive the Fruits of the ut∣most Pains you can bestow upon him He will consider you almost in the highest Rela∣tion and next to the

Physician who was engaged to be of the Party staying somewhat beyond the Time  Sam Trusty  would needs have me go with him into the Kitchen and see how Mat∣ters went there I would have excused my self fearing lest the Heat of the Place and the Steam of the several Dishes should have taken away my Stomach but he assured me that Mr  Brawn  had an Art beyond other Cooks of making his Customers more hungry by the Sight of his Kitchen I was indeed very much pleased and surprised with the extraordinary Splendor and Oeconomy I observed there but above all with the great Readiness and Dex∣terity of the Man himself His Motions were quick but not preeipitate He in an Instant applied himself from one Stove to another without the least Appearance of a Hurry and in the Midst of Smoak and Fire preserved an  incredible Serenity of Countenance By thi  Time the Doctor was come and made a Thou¦sand Apologies for being so late He assure  us by the great Powers above that nothin  should have kept him but the extreme Dange  of Two or Three of his Patients We easil  believed him knowing his uncommon Te  ¦derness for those under his Care and  the same Time the Multiplicity of his Pr  ¦ctice without the least Affectation to make  Shew of it This Gentleman after we h  dined was obliged to give Audience to severa  Apothecaries that came to him with differen  Cases from all Parts of the Town Havin  some Knowledge of Physick I took the Libert  of looking over his Bills as he writ them  which he did with wonderful Quickness an  seeming Inadvertency entertaining us all th  while with an incoherent but agreeable Co  ¦versation Notwithstanding the great Numbe  of Distempers the infinite Variety of thei  Symptoms and the Ignorance of those who re¦presented them he enter'd into them all

but this excellent Comedy was tolerably well performed but I shall be very cautious for the future how I bestow any Commendations on this or that particular Player since I find by Experience they have

He looks very ill indeed and I fear  t will be next to impossible to effect a perfect Cure since by the Account he gives me it has run in the Family for some Time His Father had this Misfortune so

to the Observa¦tion of the most ingenious Author of the Plai¦ster for Corns I told the Doctor if he woul  apply himself to the famous  Aesculapius  should be very glad of joining with him in or∣der to reestablish his Health Accordingly he went Yesterday to wait upon him But I was very much surprized when upon his coming to me again in the Evening I found he had not received the Satisfaction we both expected from the Assistance of so celebrated a Physician  '  Mr  Bickerstaff said he to me with a deject∣ed Countenance I have been to see my old Friend  Aesculapius  I found with him a young Man whom I took at first to have been a Pa∣tient for he looked sadly At his going out I heard the Doctor say  Either forbear to use those Powders or see my Face no more Ah old Friend said he upon Sight of me this ex∣travagant Boy will certainly undo me Have I walked up so many Pair of Stairs to get a little Money together to have this young Fellow spend it at Twopence a Day for Powder for his Hair Come sit down let me know what it is brings you to Town  I told him my Case in as few Words as I could to which he answered with a melancholy Look  That he was not at all surprised at it since he was but too sensible of his having formerly been a Football himself  and to let me know what strange Impressions the Mind of Man is capable of he assured me  That a certain Gentleman in this Town me long ago took his Face for a Spitting Pot  I was no less startled at what he said than at what I afterwards observed We were no sooner seated but looking on his Watch he started up again and cried  Adso we must think of Dinner  Then stepping into the next Room he fetched from thence a String Ha∣ving  fasten'd one End of it to a Nail over his Chimney he tied a Leg of Mutton to the o∣ther and giving it a Twirl began a long Complaint of the melancholy Circumstances he found himself in He told me  Every Body thought him vastly rich but they did not know what the Expences of Life were  Then giving his Mutton another Twirl  'Tis true  says he  I have Fourscore Thousand Pounds in the Funds but if a Man did not take Care to dress hit  Dinner he might be poisoned for all that  So desiring me to reach him the FlowerBox  Doctor  says he  What do you think gilding a Chariot might stand me in  Sir said I What need you trouble your self about that All the World knows  All the World may know what they please  replied he  but you will see me want before I die However  says he  I think it would do no Harm if we had a Drippingpan now Pray give the Box a shake Doctor whilst I step and fetch it You must not take it ill that I put you upon these Offices there are but few Friends I can trust to do them for me  He went on  Do you love  French  Wine I believe you may I did once my self But let me tell

considered either by themselves or others their own Behaviour and the Usage they meet with being generally very much of a Piece I have at this Time in my Hands an Alphabetical List of the  Beaux Esprits  about this Town Four or Five of whom have made the proper Use of their Genius by gaining the Esteem of the best and greatest Men and by turning it to their own Advantage in some Establishment of their Fortunes how∣ever unequal to their Merit others satisfying themselves with the Honour of having Access to great Tables and of being subject to the Call of every Man of Quality who upon Occasion wants one to say witty Things for the Diver∣sion of the Company This Treatment never moves my Indignation so much as when it is practised by a Person who though he owes his  own Rise purely to the Reputation of his Part  yet appears to be as much ashamed of it as  rich City Knight to be denominated from t  Trade he was first apprenticed to and affec  the Air of a Man born to his Titles and conse¦quently above the Character of a Wit or  Scholar If those who possess great Endow¦ments of the Mind would set a just Value upo  themselves they would think no Man's Ac¦quaintance whatsoever a Condescention no  accept it from the greatest upon unworthy o  ignominious Terms I know a certain Lord that has often invited a Set of People and pro∣posed for their Diversion a Buffoon Player and an eminent Poet to be of the Party and which was yet worse thought them both sufficiently recompenced by the Dinner and the Honour of his Company This Kind of Insolence is risen to such a Height that I my self was the other Day sent to by a Man with a Title whom I had never seen desiring the Fa∣vour that I would dine with him and half a Dozen of his select Friends I found after∣wards the Footman had told my Maid below Stairs that my Lord having a Mind to be mer∣ry had resolved right or wrong to send for ho∣nest  Isaac  I was sufficiently provoked with the Message however I gave the Fellow no o∣ther Answer than that  I believed he had mi∣staken the Person for I did not remember that his Lord had ever been introduced to me  I have Reason to apprehend that this Abuse hath been owing rather to a Meanness of Spirit in Men of Parts than to the natural Pride or Ignorance of their Patrons Young Students coming up to Town from the Places of their Education are dazzled with the Grandeur they every where meet and making too much Haste to distin∣guish their Parts instead of waiting to be desi∣red  and caressed are ready to pay their Court at any Rate to a great Man whose Name they have seen in a publick Paper or the Frontis∣piece of a Dedication It has not always been thus Wit in polite Ages has ever begot either Esteem or Fear The Hopes of being celebra∣ted or the Dread of being stigmatized pro∣cured an universal Respect and Awe for the Persons of such as were allowed to have the Power of distributing Fame or Infamy where they pleased  Aretine  had all the Princes of  Europe  his Tributaries and when any of them had committed a Folly that laid them open to his Censure they were forced by some Present extraordinary to compound for his Silence of which there is a famous Instance on Record When  Charles  the Fifth had miscarried in his  African  Expedition which was looked upon as the weakest Undertaking of that great Empe∣ror he sent  Aretine  a Gold Chain who made some Difficulty of accepting it saying  It was too small a Present in all Reason for so great a Folly  For my own Part in this Point I differ from him and never could be prevailed upon by any valuable Consideration to conceal a Fault or a Folly since I first took the Censor∣ship upon me  Having long considered with my self the ill Application that some make of their Talents I have this Day erected a Court of  Alienation  by the Statutes of which the next a Kin is im∣powered to  beg  the Parts and Understanding of any such Person as can be proved either by imbezelling making a wrong Use or no Use at all of the said Parts and Understanding not to know the true Value thereof Who shall immediately be put out of Possession and dis∣qualified for ever the said Kinsman giving sufficient Security that he will employ them as  the Court shall direct I have set down under certain Heads the several Ways by which M  prostitute and abuse their Parts and from thence have framed a Table of Rules whereby the Maintiff may be informed when he has a good Title to eject the Defendant I may in a following Paper give the World some Account of the Proceedings of this Court I have al∣ready got Two able Criticks for my Assessors upon the Bench who though they have al∣ways exercised their Pens in taking off from the Wit of others have never pretended to challenge any themselves and consequently are in no Danger of being engaged in making Claims or of having any Suits commence a∣gainst them Every Writer shall be tried by his Peers throughly vers'd in that Point where∣in he pretends to excel for which Reason the Jury can never consist of above half the ordi∣nary Number I shall in general be very tender how I put any Person out of his Wits but as the Management of such Possessions is of great Consequence to the World I shall hold my self obliged to vest the Right in such Hands as will answer the great Purposes they were intended for and leave the former Proprietors to see their Fortune in some other Way  Will's Coffeehouse  Wednesday Night  I am informed here that upon what I said in my Paper of  Saturday  last relating to the late Performance of a Play called  Love for Love

Partibus  Hor  From  Thursd Mar  to  Saturd Mar    From the Court of  Alienation  holden in  Channel Row  before Mr Critick  Snap  and Mr Critick  Wordy  Assessors  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Judge of the said Court being absent by Reason of a sudden Indispo∣sition  March  the th Nine in the Morning  THE Court being seated Silence made  c  Mr Critick  Wordy  rising slowly from the Bench spoke in the following Manner  Gentlemen I am commissioned by the Censor whose Place and Authority my Bro∣ther and my self however unworthy are at present obliged to represent and supply I am commissioned I say to speak a few Words as well in Relation to the Institu∣tion of this Court as to apprize all such who shall be concerned therein what they  are to expect and in what Methods to pro∣ceed As to the first of these Heads I shall have Occasion to speak the less upon it the Censor himself having lately in Wri∣ting communicated the Motives that indu∣ced him to erect so wise and necessary an Institution No one sure can be so entirely a Stranger to the World of Literature as not to be sensible of the many Abuses that have lately crept into it which unless a speedy and effectual Remedy were applied would in Process of Time bring no small Scandal on the most refined Part of Man∣kind and end perhaps which I tremble to think of in the utter Extirpation of Let∣ters amongst us Poetry it self the Attain∣ment of which with Submission be it spo∣ken I look upon to be one of the great Ends of our Creation would in an Age or Two it may be sooner faint languish and die away  Ex illo ruere retro sublapsa referri  I am in the next Place to acquaint you as briefly as possible and as near as the Varie∣ty of contingent Circumstances will permit what the general Issue will be of Causes de∣pending before us As for Instance  Si quis condiderit in quem mala Carmina Jus est  Judiciumque  That is to say in this Case  Qu  the Plain∣tiff laying an Indictment against  Quis  the Defendant  Here Mr Critick  Snap  in∣terrupted him and said  In short Brother let us proceed to Business Every Body that comes here knows what he has to do  Then an Indictment was read against  Jere  Wrangle  Batchelor of Arts for that he the sa  Jeremy  did some Nights ago take upon him in the Company of several Officers of Her Maje¦sty's FootGuards to deny many plain and un¦deniable Consequences under Pretence that the Arguments were not brought in Mood and Fi∣gure and that he could not find in them either  Major Minor  or  Conclusion  The Plaintiff said  'He had brought the Business into that Court as having no other Way of doing himself Right on one that professed to be a meer Scholar As for  Majors  or  Minors  why the Gentleman should twit him with them he could not imagine that he had served and at that Time had his Commission for Lieute∣nantColonel in his Pocket"  The Court up∣on a fair Hearing ordered Mr  Wrangle  to be divested of his Logick which was bestowed on one Mr  Smart  an Ensign nearly related to the Defendant and then appearing in Court to put in his Claim There was in an Instant a visible Alteration in each of their Faces  Jere∣my  's Pedantick Gravity disappeared and his Cousin the Soldier walked out of Court with a becoming Seriousness in his Gate and Air  Tobias Sternhold  was next produced in Court by his Relations who had obtained a Writ of  Captias  against him They alledged That ha∣ving a Wife and large Family which he might have maintained comfortably by his Industry he being a very good Clerk he had neverthe∣less given himself up wholly to the making of Things with Rhimes at the End of them which he called Verses and that he was come to that Pass at last that he frequently writ his Orders and Warrants in that Way insomuch that the Commissioners had threatned to turn him out which if it should happen would  e to the utter Ruin of himself and poor Fami∣  y Therefore they prayed the Assistance of the Court He pretended to justify himself by saying That one  Genius  by Name had drawn him into it and quoted the Examples of  Ovid  and  Spencer  that could not resist the Instiga∣tion of Poetry producing likewise some In∣stances of Rich Poets still living Mr  Snap  took him up short and bad him not trifle with the Bench telling him  "If they writ Verses it was in their own Coaches or when they had nothing else to do"  Then Sentence was passed upon him  "That he should be  Huska∣naw'd  and his Penmanship put into the Hands of his Wife'  She immediately took down the Proceedings of the Court in Writing upon which he fell into a violent Passion and such a Torrent of Words followed as plainly shewed they had exchanged Faculties with each other  Then the Court was adjourn'd till the First of  April  next which falling on  Easter  Day will be kept the  Monday  following  From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  March  When this last Sentence was brought to me for my Confirmation I very readily approved of it and though I was aware that the Term of  Huskanawing  being a Word unknown in any of the Courts of  Westminster  it might seem an Hardship upon a People jealous of their Rights and Liberties to impose a new Sort of Punish∣ment upon what has hitherto been scarce ac∣counted a Crime Nevertheless out of the Plenitude of my Power and of my own meer Motion and certain Science I do ratify and confirm the said Sentence But as I shall ne∣ver  extend the Prerogative of Censor of  Great Britain  to any unreasonable Bounds nor use it at all but for the Good of the People so for the Quieting of their Minds from any Doubts which might arise concerning this new Word I have thought it convenient to explain to them what it means  It is a Custom amongst the  WestIndians  that border upon  Virginia  for the Priests of the Country to elect a certain Number of the hope∣fulest young Men and of the best Families to make the Operation of  Huskanawing  upon When they have gather'd together Thirty or Forty of 'em they retire with them into the most inaccessible Parts of the Woods where they build a large Stove in which they sweat the young Men They keep 'em to a very strange Diet and their Drink is an odd Com∣position of  Indian  Corn and Juices of poiso∣nous Herbs which has such an Effect upon them that they lose their Hair their Nails their Skins and half of them their Lives be∣fore the Process be half over They that have Strength enough to hold out till Thirty Days are brought Home in great Triumph and these are looked on as the Top Patriots of that Coun∣try This seems to me to be a very wise Insti∣tution and fit to be introduced in my own Country for the Sweatings Diet Drugs and Drink which they have been used to quite re∣novate the Men so that they come out without any Remembrance of their Parents Country Loves Language or even of their own Names These are their Heroes these their Counsellors these their Ambassadors these have the Ma∣nagement of all their Publick Affairs and are maintained at the Publick Charge I must not omit that 'tis almost impossible they should after this Operation retain any Regard for  their former Studies or in the least desire to return to them If they should they durst not own it for Fear of being taken and  Re∣huskanaw'd  The TATLER N  o    En quo Discordia Cives  Perduxit miseros  Virg  From  Saturd Mar  to  Tuesday Mar    From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  March  A Writer who has the World under his Di∣rection cannot better employ his Interest and Authority than in cultivating a good Cor∣respondence between Men and endeavouring to make them agreeable to each other Not∣withstanding the Pains I have taken this Way I have Reason from an Accident I met with to believe I have not yet throughly effected so great and necessary a Work Walking the Streets this Morning I met a Gentleman of my Acquaintance who has the Honour to serve his Country in a very useful Capacity  Oh Mr  Bi  ∣kerstaff says he  you are luckily met I w  your Advice upon a very extraordinary Occasion You may command me  answered I  to the best of my Understanding but 'tis a Rule with me nei∣ther to talk nor look wisely in the Street Please  only to walk into the next CoffeehouseBy no Means Sir  replied he  starting back  don't you know that some of the rankestin  Great Britain  come thitherNot I in good Truth Sir but if they do I suppose there may be Room for usAy marry  says he  and so there may be in the Dens at the  Tower  for my Part I would as soon venture into one as the other  I immediately laughed out in his Face upon which he turned away in great Indignation and left me to reflect on so extra∣ordinary a Behaviour  I went on and having a Curiosity to see these strange Creatures my Friend had spoke of called in at the Place beforementioned I was indeed surprized at my Entrance to ob∣serve the Eyes of the whole Herd turned upon me a full Stop put to their Conversation and their Dishes for some Time suspended in MidAir at a little Distance from their Lips Turn∣ing to the Gentleman at the Bar I asked in a soft Tone for a Dish of Tea  There is none made  said he in a very surly Man∣ner  Pray then will you help me to a Dish of your CoffeeYou must stay till it is settled  re∣plied he  if you will have any  I did so and called for the  Tatler  A pert Boy looked in my Face and told me  They did not take it in since it had left off lashing the Party I might have the  Review Observator  or the  Spectator  if I pleased  In the mean Time the grave People round the Fire had a  ittle recovered their Confusion and by their  hispering to each other and then staring at me gave me to understand that I was looked upon as a Spy or at least an In∣truder into select Company One of them more bold than the rest seemed prepared to speak to me and collected himself in a reso∣lute  Posture in order to it but his Courage  iling he sunk down into his Chair again  d suffered me to pass unmolested to a Seat  ext the Chimney A surlylooking Fellow who seemed to be one of those who do not care a Farthing for any Body sate opposite to me and fixing his Eyes stedfastly upon me threw out Three or Four of his main Principles in a Breath expecting as I suppo∣sed either my Dislike or Approbation of them A young Gentleman next him who I observed filled his Pipe and reached the TobaccoTongs for him assented with a Smile to what he said and could not but wonder  that any Person should be so proposterous as to think otherwise or so insipid as to conceal his Thoughts if he did  The Calmness and invincible Silence with which I received all this Raillery had like to have brought me into some Peril for in less than a Quarter of an Hour the whole Fireside was up in a Passion Upon which I rose deli∣berately from my Chair laid a Couple of Pence without Noise upon the Bar and stole out in the same State of Neutrality that I came in I take it for granted if I had fol∣lowed my Friend to a Coffeehouse of his chu∣sing I should have met with the same Treat∣ment only softened a little perhaps by the lucky Circumstance of being introduced by one of the same Society  A Humour so absurd needs not any Anim∣adversions Follies of this Stamp are too glaring in their own Nature to suffer any Sa∣tyr or Illustration upon them to which with some Alteration may be applied those excel∣lent Lines  When Actions unadorn'd are faint and weak  Cities and Countries must be taught to speak  Gods may descend in Factions from the Skies  And Rivers from their ouzy Beds arise  Marlbro  's Exploits appear divinely bright  And proudly shine in their own native Light  Rais'd of themselves their genuine Charms they boast  And they who paint them truest praise them most  In like Manner the Embellishments of Ridi∣cule are thrown away in Cases where a plain Narration does more effectually serve the Ends proposed by it  I must not omit mentioning a good whim∣fical Business that I accidentally met with in this Adventure The Boy of the Coffeehouse having put one or two of his politick Papers into my Hand the Title of the  Spectator  which I had never before seen or heard of in∣duced me to read it over in such a cursory Manner as that Kind of Writing requires To∣wards the End of the Paper I found a Letter subscribed  C L  After perusing it I could not without Tears in my Eyes con∣sider the deplorable Condition of this poor Man The Case of  Ned Prattin  Salesman and that of this unfortunate Perfumer bear some Resemblance and I have but too much Reason to fear will both terminate in the wretch∣ed Circumstances of  Straw and a dark Room  Whether it be owing to the great Quantities of Snuff he has taken or to Pride of Heart from the Encouragement I formerly gave him it is certain that the latter has not for some Time been right in his Mind His unaccount∣able Usage of me when I went last into the Country was the first Sally of his Distemper  which is now broke out into manifest Phrenzy However unwilling I am to expose him in so publick a Manner I must hereby warn all Persons whatsoever concerned about him not to trust a Penknife in his Hands nor any In∣strument wherewith he may do himself or o∣thers a Mischief that his Maid do every Night take off his Garters and remove them far out of his Reach that he be not permitted to drink out of a Glass lest he should eat it nor to feed on Fish although it be  Lent  lest he should industriously choak himself with the Bones  I would by no Means be misunderstood as if what I here say were meant as any Reflection on Mr  Buckley  's Paper Any Gentleman in his Way may insert such Letters as come first to Hand and I verily believe That I speak of to be  Charles  's own Writing Only I cannot help cautioning Mr  Buckley  against suffering his Correspondents to direct any of their Ad∣vices to the said Mr  Lillie  for who knows but in his mad Fit he may set up a Daily Paper up∣on that Foot and by giving it out in his Bills that he sells Three Thousand a Day come into as much Reputation as the  Spectator  him∣self For my own Part as I observe some little Glimmering of a Genius in that Writer I shall be very willing to encourage him in

exalted Satisfaction on themselves Amongst the many Refinements upon Pleasure which this polite Age has produced it is a Wonder to me that so few have hit upon that of Relieving the Poor This may sound very harsh in the Ears of a fine Gentleman but most certain it is that the least Reflection would furnish him with the same Observation Were it possible for such a one to enter into all the

keep me at Home Soon after my Arrival the Taylor Semp∣stress and Periwigmaker equipped me for my intended Visit In  Channel Row  I enqui∣red for the Censor of  Great Britain  The good People thought I banter'd them and at best gave me but an uncertain Account I then went to  White  's and  Will  's where my Information was no Way satisfactoryBut at length after I had spent several Eve∣nings at the

For∣mality put off his Cloak and hung it up with his Sword and Hat filled his Pipe stir∣red the Fire and called for the last Mail These were the Appearances that had sedu∣ced me into some Hopes that this Person was the Gentleman I had been in search after but to my greater Surprize I soon found him to be a perfect Stranger to you Lucubrations and your Art and Power of Silence for his Blood he could not hold his TongueHe conti∣nued his Chat even in Despight of your Chair so I left him As I went by the Ba  I asked who this honest Gentleman was and they told me Sir  Thomas Lalos  Being now

March  IT is certainly very unreasonable that a Man because he has some Wit should set up for having more than all the rest of the World Be∣sides the Folly of such a Presumption there is an Inconvenience which naturally attends it When one Man seems to grow into a great Estate in Fame from Nothing other People are apt to enquire into his Title The discerning Part of Mankind will be allowed upon such an Occasion to take from him what is not his Due without the Imputation of Detraction Let  Hilario  be pleasant and let some of his Friends have Wit But does it naturally follow from thence that he is a Philosopher And that it is the Effect of Envy not to allow him all those Excellencies he and they think he has  Envy is a Vice of such a detestable and per∣nicious Nature that I would have it not only  rooted out of our Breasts in  Speculation  b  which would be much more for the real Goo  of Society I could wish that our Behaviou  one towards another might be actually and en¦tirely freed from those Ma  ks of it which a  every Day too visible For my self I can safe¦ly say I am contented with that Condition Pro¦vidence has placed me in My own little For¦tune is sufficient for my Necessities my Friend  are as many as supply all my Conversations  and that small Portion of Fame I have got wil  give me as much Distinction in my Lifetime  and as much Reputation with Posterity as I desire For this Reason I was never an Enemy to any Man's growing into the good Opinion of the World I could with all the Indifference of an  Idle Spectator  sit still and see my own old Wit every Day put to new Uses by other People One dumb Man retails my judicial Astrology in  Drurylane  and another of the same Sort who owns he lives somewhere or other new vamps my cast Lucubrations and cries my old Morals about the Street every Day in the Week This is what some People may think a pretty fai  Way of turning the Penny let it be so I allow it them But when honest  Dumb  forgets his Name and his Nature so far as to set up for a Dictator when he assumes the Magistrate and prescribes Laws so Manners in short wh n he arrogates to himself the Authority of Censor of  Great Britain  I think it Time to as∣sert my self and put a Stop to Encroachments of such a Nature For this Reason I think fit to admonish that Pe son whoever he may be not to interfere with my Jurisdiction unless he can prove himself to be me an Enterprize of so vain and ridiculous a Nature that I hope I need not go about to convince my Readers of  the Folly it would be to attempt it From my first Considerations upon Envy I am naturally led to reflect upon some little ill Offices which have been lately done me My Maid who takes the Privilege of an old Servant to talk to me in an Evening while she is warming my Cap setting my Slippers and turning down my Bed as she was in her usual Employment last Night I believe Sir said she I should make your Worship laugh if I should tell

should know herSo she comes up to meLaud says I Mrs  Ann  I profess I did not know youAnd who should this be but the Wi∣dow Gentlewoman's Daughter that lived at the next Door to where we lived beforeHow do you do Mrs  Mary  says she Very well says I Mrs  Ann  How do you And how does your Master do says sheVery well saysLaud says she we heard at our End of the Town how an as if he should have given over his BusinessLaud says I to her again Who should tell you so Nay says she 'twas one told me so whereupon thought I to my self says she if it be so and if Mr  Bic∣kerstaff  should leave off his Business and go in∣to the Country why perhaps Mrs  Mary  may be to seek for a Place and so truly I was re∣solved to come and see whether 'twere so or noThank you for your Love said I Mrs  Ann  my Master is a good Master to me and I don't think of parting with him yetWell says she as brisk as could be up again to me if your Master be a good Master a better  will do you no Harm You'd find another guess Sort of a Man if you were to live with our GentlemanPray says I and who is your Gentleman Laud says she how strange you make it As if you did not know our Gentleman that lodges at my Mother'sWell but says I has your Gentleman no Name No matter for that says she that argues nei∣ther here nor there but if you have a Mind to have your Wages raised I can tell you some∣thing more of the MatterAy thought I to my self is that your Business so Sir I was resolved to take no NoticeSo says the to me but Mrs  Mary  What makes you like to live so with an old Man I am sure if your Place had been so good a Place as you talk of Mr  Lillie  would have hardly come away from your MasterMr  Lillie  said I Laud help your Head as if my Master could not do without Mr  Lillie  Mr  Lillie  is no Rule for me my Master was but too kind to him and if I had a Mind to have served Mr  Lillie  a dirty TrickMy Master knows him well enough and if he had not gone away as he did my Master had turned him away the  Thursday  afterNay Mrs  Mary  says she if you are in a Passion and indeed I was as red as the Fire good Night to you Good Night to you says I and clap'd the Door after me  Tho' I was tired with the Wench's Story I could not help being pleased with this uncom∣mon Mark of her Fidelity And at the same Time it was with some Indignation that I re∣flected upon the little mean Arts that were made Use of to entice away my Servant I could hardly have believed another Instance of be same Nature if I had not been assured by  e whole Neighbourhood that they had ob∣  rved Two famous known Dogstealers watch∣  g about my Door for several Days together  rom all these Things put together I can't but  magine that the Person who has a Mind to  ome into my Place before I am willing to go  ut of it thinks he cannot absolutely qualify  imself for it unless he robs me of my Do∣mesticks To endeavour at being witty and moral is a laudable Design and the better Part of the World will always approve and encou∣rage it But if a Man can't be witty without Mr  Lillie  nor moral without stealing my Dog I believe he had better be contented with a common Portion of Fame and submit to be thought neither wiser nor better than his Neigh∣bours  The TATLER N  o    Secernite Sacra Profanis  Hor  From  Thursd Mar  to  Saturd Mar    From my own Apartment  March  IT is in my Opinion no small Reflection on the Theatrical Entertainments of this Town that the intermission of them should be looked upon as a Kind of negative Preparation to Du∣ties of the last Importance This amounts to a tacit Acknowledgment that they are in ge∣neral calculated for our Diversion without Re∣gard to our Improvement that they amuse on∣ly and unbend the Minds of an Audience in∣stead of filling them with great and noble I∣dea's and serve rather to sink the Dignity of humane Nature than to raise in us any just Sentiments about it Were it otherwise the Stage would have good Reason to remonstrate against so peculiar a Mark of Infamy as that of being denied to the World at the Approach of any Religious Solemnity and forced by that Means to confess an irreconcilable Enmity be∣tween the Pleasures of the one and the Obli∣gations of the other Notwithstanding all this I confess for my own Part that I receive ma∣ny Advantages from going to the Playhouse sometimes There is besides the Play it self  something in the Circumstances of such an As∣sembly that gives me a new Turn of Think∣ing and furnishes me with Observations out of the common Road I have a Pleasure more than I ever observed in any one else on that Occasion in seeing so great a Variety of Faces as well beautiful as others and in tracing their several Tempers Humours and Opinions in their Looks Air and Behaviour To sit Three Hours in a Crowd is in my Opinion a severe Trial of a Man's Understanding and from his Deportment there I can generally form a Judg∣ment on his whole Life and Conversation Amongst others I have ever avoided making an Acquaintance with any Person of either Sex who talked loud or laboured by any Means to be distinguished from the rest of the Audience My Friend  Sam Trusty  exceeds me in Penetra∣tion He and I commonly sit together and be∣tween the Acts entertain our selves with read∣ing over as many People as lie within our Kens He enters not only into their Dispositions but the minutest Circumstances of their Fortunes can cast up their Monthly Accounts knows how their Rooms are furnished what they eat and drink and in short is at first Sight of their Persons let into the Secrets of their re∣spective Families In taking a Survey of the Front Boxes we are from thence furnished with many serious Speculations whilst the more youthful Part of the Company are enter∣taining themselves on the same Subject after a very different Manner We examine coolly and without Danger the Symmetry and Pro∣portion of a fine Face and from the Bloom of a Complexion are led perhaps into Reflections upon Light and Colours We were engaged in a Conversation of this Sort some Evenings ago at the Opera when  Sam Trusty  breaking  abruptly  "Well  Isaac  said he I could find in my Heart to weep as  Xerxes  did over

Capacity produces it self in an Affectation of Tyranny and arbitrary Power In private Conversation the Effects of it are equally disa∣greeable tho' less extensive and serve to give one a Taste of Slavery in Cases of a higher Concern A Man who has taken this Ambi∣tion in his Head sets up for a Kind of Dictator amongst his nearest Acquaintance and will suf∣fer them to give into no other Sentiments or In∣clinations than what are entirely consonant with his own  It is worth observing that every Set of Com∣pany does naturally and without designing it fall into a Form of Monarchical Government and pay such a Deference to one amongst them as se ves to keep the rest in good Order The Abuse of this Power is indeed very frequent but without some such Regulation many great

April  THE Letter which immediately follows I make publick for my own Sake that which concludes this Paper for the Entertain∣ment of others  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  HAving a great Honour for your Perfor∣mances I think it my Duty to acquaint you with the unworthy Treatment many of your Papers have lately met with It is my Custom in an Afternoon to saunter from one Coffeehouse to another and as I was the other Day thus rambling about a Couple of odd Fellows enter'd the Room where I was one of them in his own short black Hair with an uncommon Smartness in his Face the other a thin meagre Person having much Hunger and Discontent in his Countenance Whilst the former of these engaged the Man of the House in a brisk Conversation the latter I observed slip'd the  Tatler  into his  Pocket and drop'd two  Spectators  in the Place of it in order as I suppose to stifle the one and introduce the other They immediately afterwards went out and upon following them in a careless Manner to three or four o∣ther Houses I found them putting the same Stratagem in Practice At last I laid hold of one of them and resolved to bring him be∣fore you when giving a sudden Spring he broke loose from me and with his Accom∣plice made the best of his Way up the next Alley I leave it to your Wisdom to take some effectual Measures for the Defeat of these and all other your Enemies who am for my own Part  Your most faithful humble Servant  F Y  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Longa est Injuria longae  Ambages sed summa sequar Fastigia Rerum  Virg  April  SIR  THE Extent of your Lucubrations being such as to take in whatever may be seriously instructive or innocently diverting I presume the following Relation may come within the Compass of them and therefore venture to lay it before you as it accidentally occurred  Happening to visit last Night an old Ac∣quaintance whose Hours of Retirement have been spent in uncommon Contemplations and Experiments he shewed me under a large Glass Hermetically sealed up a spreading Plant in its full Verdure strong and lively to  the Eye which he assured me he had raised from its own Ashes in a few Moments This naturally led him to a Rational Discourse on the Refurrection which though succinct was managed with that Perspicuity as to an∣swer to Demonstration all the Objections brought against it by its most formidable Op∣ponents those perfect Masters of Reason's and of Nature's Laws though very imperfect Christians Moralists or Men But to return to the Plant It bore the Figure of that  In∣dian  Weed if it be lawful to call it one that more than half the World hold in so great Esteem and my Friend growing less serious desired that while I smoaked my Pipe he might take  Aesop  's Liberty and let the admi∣red Vegetable give its own History in the fol∣lowing Words  Our Extract is of ancienter Date than that of Mankind flourishing in the World before the Days of  Adam  Our Parents tho' wide∣ly distant from each other as Heaven and Earth yet always kindly concurred in our Generation and Production raising us higher in their Favour than any of our Sister Plants As our Birth was for many Ages spontaneous so was our Life uncontrouled and while we saw our Neighbours devoured all by Rep∣tiles Brutes or Men our selves securely ranged the  American  Woods unexposed to their voracious Appetites for as we were Objects of their Love so neither were they of our Fears How did the Sun each Morn smile on us with Paternal Rays and deck us with its clearest Gems while the Gignatick Trees around as our LifeGuards protected us from the Fury of insulting Winds and only suffered the Fans of gentle  Zephyrs  to  refresh us Thus for long Tracts of Time did each reviving Spring cherish our Infant Days and Summer's Heat mature us dis∣closing all their various Beauties to us and e'er illboding Winter that mortal Foe of an∣nual Plants frowned on us we in a good old Age retired to endless Rest within our Mo∣ther's Bosom  But alas those happy Times are now no more For a malicious  Indian  for what Cause we know not committed some Ages since a grave Ancestor of ours to the de∣vouring Flames the Odors of whose Death procured us all the Injuries we have since received for we no longer lived or died in Peace but fell an easy and defenceless Prey to numberless Tortures invented by the barbarous Nations round to ravish from us all our new discovered Sweets and Vir∣tues  This was not long our Case before the In∣habitants of an unknown World came and inflicted on them as many Deaths as they on us a just Return for their inhumance Treat∣ment of us poor Innocents But these too proved alas as merciless as those and have ever since forced us into Life by their mali∣cious Art and cruel Care to be untimely torn from our Mother's Breast then left to scorch with Thirst and pine away and in∣stead of a kind Burial in our Native Soil transported us to far distant Regions where our withered Flesh stripped from our shrivel'd Bones was cut in a Thousand Pieces by En∣gines of a dire Invention  Nor are these last Complaints unjust for though when plucked from Earth our Vegetation ceases yet do we still retain our Spirits in full Strength and so are never  released from Pain till totally consumed in Flames  To enumerate the Qualities I have been famed for the Usage I have met with and the various and sometimes contrary Effects ascribed to my powerful Operations would be an endless Task I shall instance there∣fore only in some few  At first I was the Prisoner of the meanest Sort confined in greazy Pouches and visi∣ted with them my native Fields and Hedges But I soon got the Esteem of those who kept me in a nearer though a stronger Prison and so was introduced to Shops and Taverns Then the learned Faculty began their curious Searches into my hidden Virtues and could not long conceal their good Opinion of me which quickly exalted me to the sublimest Heads so that the Statesman Lawyer and Divine admitted me to their Closets and their Studies and I have often since been the obstetrical Assistant of many a teeming Brain How often have I created a keen Appetite to him that before had none and which is stranger as often filled a hungry Belly Many a Time have I received the Thanks of the Scholar at his Books the Trader at his Accounts and the Soldier in the Camp for the Thoughts I have inspired the Composedness I have occasioned and the Refreshment I have administred The Sick have praised my Cures the Healthy my Preventions the Solitary my Amusements and thus have I gratified the greatest Part of the Male World but generally been the Aver∣sion of the Fair  I was once indeed the private Favourite of a Maiden Lady but unfortunately discovered by her Admirer by being forgotten to be  thrust behind the Hangings and he not a∣ble to brook so disgustful a Rival immediate∣ly dismiss'd his Suit which produced a Shy∣ness between the whole Sex and me in my ancient  orm ever since  But since I have been refined by the new Mode of crushing me to smallest Atoms in∣stead of being kept Prisoner as before to ex∣pire in Flames I have had all the Riches of the  East  bestowed in fitting up Apartments for me and am become the constant and be∣loved Companion of the most celebrated Wits and Beauties I freely visit now the Church the Court the Mansions of the Great the TeaTable and the Closet and every Re∣sort of highest Quality  Nay I'm not refused the Virgin Bed but often dwell at Midnight on the sweetest Lips and wake the chastest Fair with Longings to embrace me By this new Art I gain a free Admission to the Brain too and am as it were immortalized by being almost mixed with Thought it self But what I value more than all is that I am the richest Jewel in the  British  Diadem  So concluded my Friend and Pipe and so concludes  Your most Obedient Most Humble Servant  Pixidicula  This is to certify whom it may concern That Mr  Dighton  Perfumer in  Fleetstreet  upon the Misfortune of Mr  Lillie  having amongst many other Candidates made humble Application to the Censor to succeed him in his Employment the  said Mr  Dighton  is appointed First Secretary to  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  and is now preparing and drawing up a Proclamation for the apprehending and taking of those Persons mentioned in the for∣mer of the foregoing Letters together with such as shall hereafter be found making Use of the same indirect and clandestine Practices as likewise for removing all Persons disaffected to the Power and Authority of the Censor Ten Miles distant from the Cities of  London  and  Westminster  The TATLER N  o    Dulcis inexpertis Cultura potentis Amici  Expertus metuet  Hor  From  Saturday April  to  Tuesd April    From my own Apartment  April  HAving as I formerly observed passed through an infinite Variety of Scenes in humane Life I cannot better employ the Re∣flections I have made upon them than by in∣structing those in the Paths they ought to pur∣sue whose Youth and Unexperience would o∣therwise betray them into a Thousand Mi∣stakes Of all others I have a tender Regard for such as apply themselves to those Arts and Sciences which gave me some Reputation in the Days of the Emperor  Trajan  I was esteem∣ed the greatest Wit of that Age but by a  Misapplication of my Parts and Learning came to an ignoble End This is a reigning Misfortune amongst the Genius's of the present Age but has indeed prevailed much more in some foregoing Reigns It is with the utmost Indignation that I see many great Capacities prostituted to the most unworthy Purposes and the World in a Manner corrupted and de∣bauched by Persons whose Talents seem in∣tended for the Ornament and Reformation of it Next to the Want of Morality I bewail the Narrowness of Fortune which too often presses Men of a liberal Education and which perhaps is one Step towards leading them into the former A young Fellow who is uneasy in his Circumstances is naturally betrayed into those Follies which recommend him to Compa∣ny and give him Hopes of making an Ac∣quaintance that may one Time or other turn to his Advantage With this View he gives into many Fooleries that he secretly despises and at last is harden'd into Vices which he former∣ly abhorred The Students of both Universi∣ties are on this Account in a peculiar Manner the Objects of my Care and Concern As of∣ten as I see a new Face about Town that pro∣mises much good Understanding and a lively Imagination I conclude it came up by the last Coach from  Oxford  or  Cambridge  I am im∣mediately upon the Rack to consider the many Difficulties such a one must encounter the At∣tendance he must pay to insolent Greatness the frequent Shocks he will receive from the Promotion of inferior Merit from the Dissimu∣lation of some and the Envy of others and at last from the mean Reward he is likely to meet with for a long Course of Slavery and Dependance  The following Letter has partly suggested to me this Way of Thinking which seems to be written rather in Confidence than with a Design to have it published but that the Post∣script does more fully explain the Intention of it  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SheerLane  April  SIR  IF the Distresses of Mankind do really fit so near you as we are given to understand by your Paper of the th of the last Month I have but too just a Right to your Compas∣sion and the most tender Advice you can bestow upon me  It was not long since my good Fortune to be a Member of College in  Oxford  where I spent Four Years in a Manner per∣fectly innocent and agreeable to my Temper Good Part of my Time was spent in Reading the rest in such Amusements as the Place af∣forded I was generally well esteemed by the few I was known to and being not much turned to Gallantry made a Shift to be easy without the Company of Ladies which eve∣ry Body knows are scarce in those Parts During this Retirement I happened to write a Copy of Verses which alarmed Two or Three of the Top Booksellers in this Town and gave them Hopes of me for a future Author of some more considerable Work Whether they employed my Acquaintance to flatter me on that Occasion I know not but to my utter Ruin I received incredible Ap∣plause for my Performance Soon after I took it in my Head that the University was too narrow a Sphere for me to act in I  formed to my self great Notions of my Re∣putation at  London  and thought it would be taken amiss if I did not go and visit my Friends and Admirers there I made a Jour∣ney accordingly and had the Honour to be introduced to some Persons of a considerable Figure Now thought I my Fortune is made I have seen the greatest General and the best Poet in  Europe  My old Friends in the mean Time whom I had left behind me sent frequent Letters of Congratulation upon the Prospect I had of coming into the Mini∣stry which I received and answered with the Air and Style of one that was already in Em∣ployment I affected for Instance a new Way of writing my Name of making up my Paper and of subscribing my self according to the Forms received in the Offices about  Whitehall  The great Civility and good Man∣ners of many whom I was presented to had like to have led me into some Mistake Through my great Ignorance and Want of Breeding I believed every Word they said to me and when they assured me  they would do me any Service that lay in their Power that they had a great Opinion of my Merit and only wanted an Opportunity to shew it  I had no more Complaisance than to take them at their Words and look out for Occasions of trying their Friendship In the mean while my slender Fortune run out a∣pace the Spleen succeeded and I am now in every Essential as errant a Wit as any about Town Words cannot express the Shame Scorn and Regret I have for my past Indiscretion which I can no other∣wise atone for than by laying it open in this Way for the Good of others and applying at the same Time for Advice to Mr  Bicker∣staff  with Regard to my future Conduct I am  SIR  With great Respect Your most Obedient Most humble Servant  W H  P S  I shall hope to see this in your next Paper  This Case shall be taken into Consideration and the Censor's Opinion delivered upon the same  The Verses subscribed  H G  are received and many Thanks returned for them as likewise for the Letter from  Philanthropos  Mr  Twining  at  Tom  's Coffeehouse in  Deve∣reuxCourt  a Man eminent for his great Probity and indefatigable Industry is appointed UnderSecretary to Mr  Dighton  and will wait at the Bar of his own House this present  Tuesday  in the Evening to receive the Compliments of his Friends upon the same  The TATLER N  o    Nescio quod certe est quod me tibi temperat Astrum  Pers  From  Tuesd April  to  Thursd April    From my own Apartment  April  IN taking a Survey of Mankind one cannot but observe an universal Pursuit of what they call Pleasure and at the same Time the grossest Mistakes about the Notion of it Not to enter into more Particulars let it suffice that in the Catalogue of Things conducing to this End Friendship is generally omitted and either not at all considered or else exploded and laughed out of Countenance The Truth is our Vanity seems to have got the better of our Reason and choose rather to appear happy than be so Hence it is that instead of cultivating an Intimacy with a few we make a superficial Acquaintance with all that offer and are more desirous of being seen by a Multi∣tude than rightly known and understood by any The Want of Virtue is at the Bottom of all this Having no true Principles of Honour Generosity or good Nature we naturally a∣void being too strictly enquired into and there∣fore are cautious that those about us should not take any Freedom beyond what a mixed  Kind of Conversation will allow It is suf  ¦cient that a Set of unthinking young Fello  can meet over a Bottle and make a Shift  pass the Time with trifling and indifferent T  ¦picks without ever entertaining the least m  ¦tual Regard or examining into the Merits  one another It will be difficult to perswad  such Men that they have not yet tasted one  the most exquisite Enjoyments that the Soul  capable of or that they have it in their Powe  to open to themselves a more delightful Wa  of Living than they have hitherto been ac¦quainted with Talking the other Day with  very young Gentleman on this Subject I could not help asking him  "Whether amongst the many Affairs he had made with the Ladies he had never yet happened to have one of an honourable Nature upon his Hands"  He frankly confessed he had and upon being fur∣ther pressed  "That he found more Satisfaction in the Pursuit of That than from all the Successes he ever met with in those of ano∣ther Kind"  "Believe me then said I there is no less Difference between the idle Amusement of a common Acquaintance and the refined Endearments of an intimate Friendship"  I insisted the more on this Point with a Person who was as yet in a great Measure a Stranger to the World because it is very certain that the sooner this Notion is re∣ceived the more advantageous it proves and is a Means of preventing many Miscarriages in our Behaviour For my own Part amongst a Thousand other Obligations which I owe to my Parents I must particularly acknowledge that of instilling an early Benevolence to Man∣kind in general and a Desire of fixing my self in the Affections of one or more who should appear best qualified for so near an Alliance  Sam Trusty  whom I have often mentioned in these Papers was almost my first Choice and has preserved me from many Errors which Youth and Indiscretion would otherwise have led me into I am infinitely obliged to my Cousin  Humphry Wagstaff  on the same Account as well as for the great Assistance he has given me in the Prosecution of this Work My Con∣versation with each of these Gentlemen is a Kind of elegant Retirement from the World as it furnishes me with the justest Remarks upon the several Occurrences in it Our Sen∣timents are communicated without Reserve insomuch that our ordinary Discourse is by the latter stiled Thinking aloud In this happy Situation of Life we stand less exposed than others commonly are either to the Strokes of Fortune the Illnature of our Enemies or any Calamity that can befal us In the mean Time all our Enjoyments by being shared amongst us are heightened and improved in Propor∣tion to the Pleasure that every Individual re∣ceives from them  In order to make Mankind happy in the Relish of so refined a Commerce with each other I could wish our present Writers of Plays instead of filling their Works of that Sort with the Business of Love would some∣times diversify them with the Distress of Friends their Heroick Behaviour under it with all the beautiful Incidents that History can furnish or a warm and noble Imagina∣tion suggest upon that Model I am sensible how great a Genius is required to this Task but whenever the Prudence of our Superiors shall think fit to deliver the Stage from the State of Slavery and Mismanagement it now labours under I shall not despair of seeing  this and many other excellent Designs happil  put in Execution  An humble Retainer to the Theatre havin  made the following Application to me I t  this Occasion of making it publick and of a  ¦suring the Person concerned as well as others who may hereafter fall into the same Misfor∣tune that neither the corrupt Dealing o  Charles Lillie  tho' a Lunatick nor the Inso¦lence of those who support him in it sha  pass unnoted or unpunished by the

Libertine  sends his Footman out for a Whore by which Means I believe I may venture to say I have modestly speaking been ravished upwards of Five hundred Times By this Employment and that of Lightner to the Opera's I have made a Shift to get a com∣fortable Livelihood But since there is a worthy Gentleman who has taken upon him to regulate our Stage and that if I should be turned out I am too old to turn my Hands to any other Business I must humbly im∣plore your Honour's Protection and that you would be pleased to do therein as to your great Wisdom shall seem fit  And your Petitioner shall ever pray  E G  SIR  All the Women of our Stage have made a Party against me upon the Account of this Accident in the  Libertine  and say that ano∣ther such Instance of Chastity might ruin them for which Reason and because I have no Money to make an Interest with Mr  Lillie  t'other Gentleman's Agent I shall be undone unless your Honour will pity my Case  The TATLER N  o    Cuncti adsint merit aeque expectent Praemia Pàlma  Virg  From  Thursd April  to  Saturd April    From my own Apartment  April  I Know not how it happens whether through a Misrepresentation from my Enemies or a Misunderstanding in some of my Readers an Opinion has lately obtained that I allow no Body to have any Share of Wit or Humour but my self that I industriously suppress the Attempts of others in that Way and will not so much as suffer a young Writer to thrive un∣der my Shade These and a Thousand Calum∣nies of the same Nature have by some Means or other though with the utmost Injustice  been spread amongst Persons well affected  my Interests who have thought themselv  obliged by Letters and other Ways to gi  me repeated Notice of such unhandsome Pr  ¦ceedings If I can promise any Thing for  ¦self it is that I have no greater Ambition tha  to improve cultivate and encourage a promi¦sing Genius wherever I meet with it and no  only to refine the Morals of Mankind but t  make even their Studies and Productions mo  entertaining and agreeable to one another I must confess indeed that ever since my fir  entring upon the Censorship I have been very tender of suffering any Incroachments to be made upon the Dignity of that Office I have now and then shewn the Error of those who offered to invade a Province so peculiarly my own and by a seasonable Rebuke put a Stop to many growing Inconveniencies At a Time when we are engaged in a just and necessary War Abroad of what fatal Consequence might it have proved to make a new Division at Home Which must unavoidably have risen had I suffered any further Competition for so great an Employment A Man must have lit∣tle Regard for the Interest of  Europe  who can be tempted by any Consideration to embroil his Country in Quarrels and Disputes at so critical a Juncture What I have said there∣fore in any of my Papers upon this Occasion will by all Persons of Candor and Discern∣ment be considered rather as an Instance of my Care for the Publick than of any View to my own Authority and Advantage If others have been unhappily provoked by it to make rash and indiscreet Reflections upon me I am hear∣tily sorry for their Misfortune and wish that their Passion had not made them incapable of receiving Advice from their truest Friend up∣on  that Subject I shall only say at present  t as it is evident they have imbarked in a  ong Bottom they will do well to give off as  on as possible for next to the Honour of a  ccessful Engagement is that of a handsome  treat  To vindicate my self yet further from t  putation I before

Generosity of Great Men extends even  Opera's and PuppetShows I cannot but  lieve they will be easily perswaded to en∣  urage such Entertainments as tend to the  egulation of Manners and the

forced from  London  where I spent the Winter by the Commands of my Mother who took it in her Head that I grew too fond of that Place and was in Danger of throwing my self away upon some idle young Fellow or other It is not to be ex∣pressed how melancholy I am here My Heart akes at this Instant as if it would break I look upon no one Object with Pleasure The Fellows whom I liked well enough Half a Year ago appear silly and aukward and even the Cathedral Church of a  Sunday  affords me no Entertainment  What shall I do dear Mr  Bickerstaff  to re∣move the Heaviness that sits upon my Heart How shall I divert my self in this wild and solitary Retreat Formerly indeed I could spend whole Days and Nights in turning over my Romances I could with infinite Pleasure rove about the Wilderness in our Garden and charm the Rival Nightingales with the Musick of my Flute How often have I there unbound my Silver Locks and given them to be the Sport of wanton  Ze∣phyrs  Young ruddy Damsels waited round me and decking me forth with all the Pride and Beauty of the Spring proclaimed me Goddess of the PlaceOh cursed  Damon  That dear dissembling Youth He alas has robbed me of my Innocence and with it of all the pleasing Errors that made Soli∣tude delightful and gilded over these Silvan Scenes  He in short Sir has turned my Notions another Way and given me a new Set of Desires and Inclinations If you will bestow some Advice upon me I will endeavour to follow it and give you a constant Account of the Success it has with me If I at all understand my own Case I am by my pre∣sent Circumstances very well qualified for a Rural Censor and can see no Reason why Women should be excluded that Office I promise you to have a very strict Eye upon my own Sex and may perhaps let you into some Secrets relating to them that have hi∣therto escaped your Censure The faithful Execution of this Employment will be a Means to divert my own Spleen and may perhaps conduce to the Gratification of yours and that of many Thousands more I will in all Things act as becomes the Substitute of  so great a Person and one who has a Desire to approve her self  Your most humble Servant  Belinda  The Case of  Belinda  is in my Opinion very deplorable and would if fully considered give Occasion to many useful Reflections At present I shall only observe upon it that the Blemish she has received in her own Character is by no Means a Step towards a Power and Jurisdiction over the Conduct of others I am not unwilling to admit some of the Fair Sex into the Employment she sollicits for having in general a great Opinion of their Capacities as well as of their earnest Desire to reform the Manners of those about them It may not however be amiss to give the Electors in this Point a short Abstract of the Qualifications re∣quisite to a Female Censor lest any Mistakes should happen upon so weighty an Affair As first That she is indeed with an habitual Si∣lence Secondly That she has a known Ha∣tred to Scandal and Detraction Thirdly That she neither pays nor receives any impertinent Visits Fourthly That she is a constant Rea∣der of the  Tatler  And Fifthly and Lastly That she has besides other Books a huge  of Receipts  The following Billet is of no less Conse∣quence than the former  SIR  I Have a great Quarrel to Mr  Jervoise  and at your Hands demand immediate Justice upon him He has lately

 next between the Hours of Nine and Ten in the Morning  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Honoured Sir  I Have examined your Lucubrations with the utmost Care and Diligence but can find nothing relating to my present Case Whether your Thoughts have been employed on more useful Subjects or whether Circum∣stances so entirely alter the Nature of Things that it is impossible to define them but if so it happens that the Importunity which a Man should use in the Recovery of his Own has wholly escaped you I could read a Dis∣sertation of yours upon Dunning with more Pleasure than I ever looked at a newfashio∣ned  Toy You only can direct us how far a Gentleman may be decently pressed and whether Personally or by Billet is the more proper Method  If you knew how much I was interested in this Affair I perswade my self your Concern for the Sex would hasten your Resolution I cannot look at poor  Charles  's Face without bathing it with a Flood of Tears Had he sold Cast Work for Hammer'd or Horn for TortoiseShell I could moderate my Resent∣ments but to be kick'd disabled and caned like a Stockfish for only demanding his Due is an Indignity not to be suffered in a free Country  Good Mr  Bickerstaff  take a distressed Wo∣man into your Protection and give me such Redress as you in your great Wisdom shall judge suitable to the Offence and believe my Application to the Censor of  Great Bri∣tain  to proceed only from the Equity  I have observed in all your Determinations I am  Your most Devoted Humble Servant  Sarah Bubbleboy  Ordered  That Mr  Dighton  and Mr  Twining  do enquire whether the Kicks and Blows given were by  Neats  or  Calves  Leather  Jambees  or  Dragons  after which Mr  Bickerstaff  will pro∣ceed accordingly  The TATLER N  o    Torva Leaena Lupum sequitur

Design of this Paper is to re∣concile Men to their several Stations in Life and to remove that Uneasiness which commonly arises from the supposed Advantages of those about them Unless this be in some Measure effected it is in vain to expect any great Success from Precepts of another Kind a Person who is out of Humour being as in∣capable of receiving Advice as bestowing it on others The Stake chiefly contended for is Power and this if I mistake not is more equally divided than we commonly imagine The executive Part of it seems indeed to be pretty much engross'd by Men of great For∣tunes and large Possessions They 'tis true carry about them all the Distinctions of Gran∣deur and Superiority they are attended by Maces adorned with Ribands and crowded by a numerous Train of Dependants In the  mean Time it must be no small Satisfaction for a Man who is inclined to envy them such pom∣pous Appearances to make a strict Enquiry in∣to some other Circumstances which are not al∣together so much exposed to the publick View He will by this Means discover that these great Machines are informed turned and directed by the most minute Springs and Movements that in many Instances a menial Servant has the Management of their highest Concerns and disposes of their Actions as he in his great Wisdom shall judge most convenient for them  As my Cousin  Humphrey  and my self were taking a Walk in the  Park  the other Day a Person of Note passed by us with an Air of Inso∣lence and Contempt attended by a very mag∣nificent Equipage He with his usual Free∣dom taking me aside desired me to observe that fine Thing and to give my Opinion of him Observing me a little reserved upon the Matter  "  Isaac  says he with some Indigna∣tion You are the greatest Coward in the World Had I put the same Question to you upon Fifty others of Five hundred Times the Worth of inferior Rank you would have made no Scruple of speaking your Sentiments I will tell you then That Gentleman you see there is one Way or other in Subjection to every one of those Fellows that dangle after him I happen continued he to be well ac∣quainted in his Family in which there is a Chain of Interests carried on after the fol∣lowing Manner The Steward who is an old Servant and has cheated his Master Time out of Mind has the entire Government of him The Housekeeper has a Hank as they call it over the Steward and makes sin∣gular Use of him in all impertinent Affairs  The Page has no less Interest in the House∣keeper at the same Time that he is himself in Love with the Chambermaid  Rose  for that is her Name professes a Passion for  T  the Footman who is deeply smitten with dirty  Moll  the Kitchen Wench The latter of these has in Conclusion a great Sway in what∣ever Cases she thinks fit to exert her Inte∣rest which if she were made sensible of it would undoubtedly afford her no small Com∣fort under the constant Hurry and Fatigue of her painful Occupation'  Having but little Knowledge of great Fami∣lies I was not before aware that this Scheme of Government was received amongst them but in the Compass of my own Acquaintance I have seldom seen it otherwise Old Major  Matchlock  I remember was a very blustering Fellow over a Bottle and withal made a good terrible Figure at the Head of a Company but within his own Doors he behaved himself with great Pusillanimity and paid the utmost Subjection to an ancient Maid whom in less than Forty Years he had raised from raking in a Heap of Cinders to the Superintendancy over all his domestick Affairs I am not in my own Nature much addicted to Fear yet I can∣not but confess that I stand in Awe of my old Servant  Mary  She happens to be of a mild Disposition which makes her Authority fit the more easy upon me but if it were otherwise I do not presume that I should have Courage enough to make Head against her As she has few other Favourites or Companions than my Dog and tabby Cat there is no Danger of her leading me into any Absurdities on their Behalf  I am very much obliged to the Person who sends me the following Letter and shall com∣ply with the Instances made therein to the ut∣most of my Power  From the West  April  SIR  AT this Distance from other Entertain∣ments I am not a little beholden to that which your Paper affords me insomuch that I drink your Health in a Bumper of Ma∣nufacture every Day of my Life and next in Order

their Gover∣nante who stickled hard for the  Primmer  I have had Two or Three Quarrels with my Wife's Woman for putting Thread in your Paper and had like to have turned away my Butler for setting up Candles in it In a Word Sir I pay all imaginable Respect to your Works and would be glad to have Opportunity of shewing it to your Person I flatter my self therefore that you will give me Leave after

Multiplicity of NewsPapers that we know not which to consult first nor at last which of them to give any Credit to The  Tatler  was formerly wont to determine our Choice in this Matter by giving us a Summary of the most material Occurrences in a clear and in∣telligible Style which except in the  Gazette  is now not to be had for Love nor Money  It is therefore our humble Petition that you would renew this so laudable a Practice which if you please to comply with I ven∣ture to assure you in the Name of the whole Neighbourhood that we will at our next Meeting hold a Day of Thanksgiving on that

Labours ren∣dered vain and fruitless I once flattered my self with the happy Effects of my Censorship and thought the Influence of  Isaac Bickerstaff  had so generally obtain'd through the United Kingdoms of  Great Britain  that there was no∣thing remaining but the Fruits and Glory of the Conquest But such is the Misfortune of a publick Character I have no sooner routed and disarmed the Enemy in one Quarter of my Dominions exposed the Vice and Folly of Mankind in one Particular but I find my self engaged in a fresh Dispute as if my Authori∣ty was not so universally received as I imagin'd as if the People of this Island thought me only  de Facto  and not  de Jure  Censor By my Age and Experience I have hitherto put a Stop to the growing Evil But there is a Race of Creatures sprung up by their Frame and Com∣plexion resembling Men which are as far above my Understanding as they are real Objects of my Concern It grieves me to see the Bull  the Bear the Lion stalking in a humane Form I am in Pain to find something so like my self sending forth nothing but  Brutal  Ac∣cents as if all Joy and Grief consisted in the Quantity of Sound and there was no Way to express the Dictates and Sentiments of Nature but by being tumultuous These Men if I may be allowed to call them so seem weary of being at the FagEnd of the Rational Species and think they shall make tolerable good Fi∣gures under another Character I will refer the Examination of this Particular to another Paper and insert the Letter which gave Occa∣sion to the Reflection  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SIR  AMong the many Benefits which Mankind has received from your Lucubrations that of improving and polishing our Conver∣sation has been none of the least Your di∣stinguishing the different Characters of Men by the Instruments of Harmony has given most an Inclination to be musical each pre∣paring and hoping to appear in a better Class This innocent Ambition has had an Effect even on the lowest Kind and I have known some Drums despairing of ever getting a fi∣ner Note content to be silent a great Ne∣gative Blessing to those unhappy Gentlemen who were sometimes condemned to be Part of their Audience But Sir there is Need of a farther Reformation there are some People who have formed to themselves a Sound that comes under no Denomination you have yet imparted to the World indeed there are not many of this Sect nor should I  take any Notice of them but that I have ve∣ry lately observed they begin to get Con∣verts These noisy Men have their Fits come upon them very constantly and with very little Intermission yet they can be sometimes articulate but then I don't observe those Tokens of Mirth which they show at the End of the Paroxism I have seen one of them jump out of his Chair and suddenly getting his Legs from the Ground five or six Times make such a Noise as Nature gave us not Ears to receive which has ended in about Seven Minutes in a strong loud Laugh ac∣companied with the rest of the Sect if there be any present for the Fit often takes 'em a∣mong Strangers who join in the Chorus I have seen your great Masters of Noise Fox∣hunters Bombardiers Gunners of all Kinds Sailers who are Judges of Storms amazed at their prodigious Vociferation I should take them to be something Enthusiastical but there is no Shew of Religion among them The  Hottentotts  a  Free People  as the  Dutch  Travellers tell us come near them in Sound but with less Impetuosity From their Agi∣tation they may pass for  French  Prophets but I think they deserve neither  Toleration  nor  Indulgence  There have been Arguments us'd by Men of Wit and God knows of Probity to support all the Follies that have appeared in the World Mr  Herbert an old solemn Bard of our own  a Defender of Joking to the last Extent has observed  That every Thing is big with Jest and has Wit in it if you can find it out  I neither doubt your Power Phy∣sically Astrologically or Mathematically yet if you can reduce these Sounds into any Compass if you can form any Figure to ex∣press something inarticulate though the Dis∣quisition  may not entertain the Multitude do the fair Thing and forgive a Friend who begs of

Saturd April  to  Tuesd April    From my own Apartment  April  I AM oblig'd to visit my old Friend  Hortensius  every  April  when his  Auricula  's are in Blos∣som He tells me he should be as much dis∣appointed if his Friends did not come and see him while his Garden is in its Pride as a fine Lady would be on her Day if no Body came to admire how well she was lighted up  I went down on  Monday  last to his House It was almost dark when I arrived and I found my Friend watering his Pots with his own Hand and covering the choicest of them with Glasses lest the Inclemency of one Frosty Night in so uncertain a Climate as ours is should shorten the Duration of a Pleasure which is but too Transitory even in its longest Continuance He bid me welcome to his Her∣mitage and conducted me with  Aude Hospes contemnere Opes  to an elegant little Supper a good Part of which was the Product of his Garden After the Cloth was taken away  'Mr  Bickerstaff  said he I fancy you look with a good deal of Contempt upon our Country Amusements Is it not very odd to find me doing the same Thing to Night that  I did Forty Years ago Not at all replied I I don't think Individuals either grow better or worse after One and Twenty and I am no more surprized to find you diverted with an agree∣able innocent Employment Forty Years toge∣ther than I should be Forty Years hence if it were possible I could live so long to find those who are now young Fops to be grown old ones or those that are young Knaves to be grown more experienc'd For since People don't grow weary of their Faults I see no Reason why they should grow weary of their Pleasures at least of such Pleasures as don't grow weary of them Ah dear  Isaac  said my Friend there's the Point to find out some Entertainment that will not find out that we grow old and such a one I believe I have made Choice of By that Means I converse daily with the g  wdiest Part of the Creation for since there is no Body here to tell it again to the Toasts I must own to you that I think Nature has been no where so la∣vish of her Beauties as amongst the Birds and Flowers Harmonious Voices sweet Breaths fine Complexions blooming Youth and then for Constancy one of my poor Turtles is dying of a Widowhood Where will you match me these in the rest of the World You durst not talk at that Rate re∣ply'd I nor I hear you but at the Age of Se∣venty though it is natural for every one to give as much Dignity as he can to whatever he is fond of Dignity interrupted  Horten∣sius  a little warmly we want no Dignity or at least we need not strain a Point for it Pray Friend  Isaac  when Man was made lit∣tle lower than the Angels what was he A Prince a General or a Great Minister Nei∣ther He was a Gardiner Pray what is it  that distinguishes Man from Beasts Why all Philosophers say Reason Philosophers are Puppies if Man were distinguished from the rest of the Creation by Reason would he not be distinguish'd by the noblest Operation of Reason the cultivating a virtuous Mind But how is that Ask any of these Philoso∣phers for Examples of Cruelty Lust of Avarice of Disobedience to Parents of Ra∣pine of Ambition of Treachery of Cow∣ardice of any Vice they shall bring you Instances of all these from Kings Queens Generals Popes and even Philosophers them∣selves But talk to them of Fidelity they quote you the Dog of Piety to Parents the Stork of Industry the Ant and the Bee of Meekness the Lamb of Courage the Lion and of Constancy there my poor Turtle comes in again Oh Reason is a dainty Thing I love that noble Distinction mightily 'Tis almost as good as Risibility Hold dear  Hortensius  said I pray let us be distinguished some Way or other or let us go naked as they do and save Taylors Bills or rather let us get Hair and Feathers on our Skins for I doubt I should not like to walk about pull'd neither"  He smiled upon me and went on  "I design to distinguish for you too The true Distinction between Man and Beast and which  soli Homini convenit  is Gar∣dening  Homo est Animal Horticolum  Upon that Condition you may differ from Beasts as much as you please and be as distinct a Spe∣cies as you can But if you design to take the Advantage of this Proposal you must be∣gin by going to Bed early that we may be up to Morrow to enjoy the Sweets of the Mor∣ning and therefore I'll wait on you to your Chamber"  The next Morning was so like  one in a Romance that if it would not make this Paper too long I could be content to de∣scribe it About Seven a Clock my Friend came into my Chamber and told me I was going to be very Happy as soon as I had drank my Cho∣colate for every Thing conspired to make our Walk so pleasant that what with the Perfume of the Flowers and the Harmony of the Birds he questioned whether I would regret either the Smoak or the Noises of  London  There were Two Parterres on either Side of the House which were separated by a neat Espa∣lier from the rest of the Garden These were destined for the Reception of the Flowers of Quality such as  Auricula's Tulips Anemonies Ranunculus's  and  Carnations  who lived here removed from the Commerce of the People of Flowers which inhabit the Remainder of this vegetable Kingdom My Friend was pleased to see me surprized with the Beauties of his Benches of  Auricula's  He made me take par∣ticular Notice of Number I which he told me was honoured with the Name of a Great Prin∣cess and the rest of the Confederacy stood in their proper Places after her The next Series my Friend enlarged more upon finding I be∣gun to tast the Entertainment and made me remark a Flower which was a little overblown but he told me it had been wonderfully fine in its Time and whispered me in the Ear the La∣dy's Name it went by  "And what I value it for exceedingly said he is That I have rai∣sed those Four Seedlings which stand next her from this Flower There was a Fifth but I could not preserve it If we had not such Losses we should be too happy"  In short he went on with above Fifty fine Ladies one after another and I believe would never have given off if I had not interrupted him  by asking him how his Flowers came to be all of a Party and saying that I did not think to have seen that Matter carried so far  "Why said he I don't know how that comes about but we endeavour to fit our Flowers to our Faces and Characters and this is done in a Manner by Election But no Body need be without their Flower for the  Daffodil  and  Piony  Kind stand empty for any Ladies that please to take them and as any new ones come out a∣mongst our better Flowers if they will stand Candidates for them I shall be very im∣partial But we can't do so well by the Ge∣nerals they must have a Campagne in their Bellies and can't be provided for till next Spring and then they'll stand as fair as o∣thers"  We took our Walk on through the rest of the Garden at the lower End of which there was a little Trout Stream with Benches by the Side of it Here we sate down and  Hortensius  asked me if I was not tired with such a sauntering Country Life I assured him no and wished I had it in my Power to invite him to such another Place  "Why really my Friend said he I passed a good Part of my Time in what the World calls Pursuit of Plea∣sure and Honour and have found at last that all those Things are nothing more than what I have in this little Brook  Noise and Motion'  The TATLER N  o    Tua Res agitur Paries cum proximus ardet  From  Tuesd April  to  Thursd April    From my own Apartment in ChannelRow  April  I WENT Two or Three Nights ago to  Brown  's Coffeehouse to smoak a Pipe and talk of the Affairs of  Germany  with my old Friend Mr  Solomon Million  As we were dis∣coursing of Funds and Politicks I observed a tall genteel Man come in who made a very re∣spectful Bow to  Million  and stood at a Distance but looked as if he had something to say to him I made him take Notice of it He tweer'd at him a little and said  "Friend would you speak with me Fray what's your Business"  He approached and whispered him and then  Million  cry'd  "Why ay and so I did but we could not carry it for you And so look'ee you must be contented You lost it in good Company that I must needs say but it is not always'  Here he coughed and I who had not recollected the Gentleman till then perceived it was  Don Diego  He had a Paper in his Hand which he delivered  Million  who looking upon it shook his Head and said  "This is not in our Way  but my worthy Friend Muster  Bickerstaff    may be allowed to name him on this Occa¦sion may do you a Kindness if so be he'll recommend it to the World which I hope he will for my Sake"  The Paper was as follows  To all Lovers and others within the Cities of  London  and  Westminster  and the Liberties thereof  WHereas there have been great Com∣plaints at all Times of the Inconstan∣cies Indiscretions Inabilities and Exorbi∣tances of the several Lovers within the Bills of Mortality and whereas the same do still continue notwithstanding the several Statutes in those Cases had made and provided so that often those who have gone to Bed in a substantial happy and reputable Condition have perhaps the next Morning by some sud∣den unforeseen Accident found themselves stripped of all that was near and dear to them their Pleasure and Reputation For the preventing of which fatal Misfortunes for the future it is humbly proposed That as  Office of Insurance for Lovers  be erected after the Manner of the  Amicable Society  where all Persons subscribing the Policies which will be ready by the First of  May  next at which Time the Books will likewise be open∣ed at the Sign of the  United Hearts  in St  Martin'sLane  may be entitled to the following Advantages  I Any Lover may be insured  ad Val  rem  for any Term of Years or for Life if re∣quired for a reasonable  Praemium  to be set∣tled by the Majority of the Subscribers at their First General Court which is to be held as soon as One hundred thousand of ei∣ther Sex have entered themselves of this So∣ciety which it is humbly presumed may be in less than Twenty four Hours after the Books are opened  II After such Subscription and the Name entered in the Company's Books the Per∣sons who take a Policy will be insured by the Sum of  That their Lover shall neither deceive forsake nor be∣tray them and in case of Decay in Af∣fection which 'tis hoped will seldom hap∣pen such Losses shall be made good by all the Members of this Society who upon due Notice are to pay in their Quota to any such Claim within Eight Days at far∣thest  III The Society will stand to all Repairs of the Persons subscribing they having in Pay the best Artists of all Kinds for that Purpose some of whom have been bred up at the Court of  France  and procured the most valuable Cosmeticks there at a vast Expence by which Means they will be able at a Minute's Warning and in Two Hours Time to scaffold up and new Point any La∣dy that apprehends falling to sudden Decay and make her tenantable without Loss of Time or Hindrance of Business  IV Young Men of Quality and Offi∣cers of the Army must be insured at pret∣ty high Rates they being liable to Brag∣ging and Inconstancy but Citizens Sea∣men and Country Gentlemen will come at little or nothing  V The Pleasures and Profits of this So∣ciety to be equally divided betwixt the Ad∣venturers  VI Any married Woman shall in this Of∣fice be deemed and taken as a Femme Sole and may subscribe and enjoy to her own Use and Behoof such Policy or Policies not∣withstanding her Coverture and in case of any Trouble from her Husband or if any Divorce should be attempted the whole So∣ciety are obliged to use their Interest against it either in the Commons or otherwise  VII Any Adventurers in this Society may by mutual Agreement with the Consent of the Governor and Governess and the Majo∣rity of the Four and twenty Directors trans∣fer their Right and Title in any Policy to any other Member of this Society  VIII All Persons at their Admission to take an Oath to stand by and mutually assist each other against all malicious and censo∣rious Tongues who are always raising ill Reports and misconstruing the most inno∣cent Looks to the great Disquiet of civil Families  IX There are to be SwornAppraisers of both Sexes who are to take a Survey and certify upon Oath the true Values of the Persons subscribing  Though I am far from taking this for a per∣fect Scheme yet I think it does not deserve to be rejected at the first Reading for perhaps something may be added in a Committee to make it of great Use  I do therefore refer it to a Committee of the whole Town who are to examine the Allega∣tions and report their Opinion for I cannot but think that if something of this Kind could be done it would be of universal Advantage and might go a great Way towards extinguish∣ing those Heats and Animosities which are amongst us and put an affectual Stop to those wicked Emissaries that are continually busied in stirring up Jealousies and evil Reports among Her Majesty's loving Subjects  The TATLER N  o    Prisca redit Venus  Hor  From  Thursd April  to  Saturd April    From my own Apartment in ChannelRow  April  ONE great Inducement to me in removing to this End of the Town was for the Benefit of the Air in St  James  's  Park  where I usually take one Turn in the Morning and  it be any Thing like Weather another as soon as my Pipe is done after Dinner In my Walk the other Day I met with so odd an Adventure that I can't help being particular in the Relation of it especially since in Regard to Posterity it may serve to clear up one of the most impor∣tant Passages of my Life Just by the  CockPit  at the  PrivyGarden  Door there step'd up gently to me an ancientish Woman in a little black Hood a Whisk Band and a Crape Gown and in a soft low Voice calls to me "  Sir  I could never think it Charity to relieve your StreetBeggars What little I do in that Kind is chiefly to CharitySchools and decayed House∣keepers So on I walk'd and she after me  'But Sir says she again with a respectful Whisper I am a Gentlewoman Gentle or Simple said I that's nothing to me Prithee  Woman be gone about thy Business This is not a Place for you"  When she had got me to answer her she proceeds  "Sir you look like a Gentleman and my Case is really such that if you knew but HalfI don't de∣sire to know a Quarter"  said I But the Wo∣man was so very civil and withal so very im∣portunate that I could not help turning about to her and with that she pulls Two or Three dirty torn Papers out of her Stays and offers them me to read  "Pray Mistress said I what is it you would have of me This is not a Place to read Papers in But my Name is so I live in such a Place and if you think it worth your while to come to me when I have more Leisure I'll hear what you have to say'  I observed she changed Colour upon hearing my Name and coming up closer to me told me  "Nothing but the greatest Necessity could have brought her to this Her Education it was well known had been above any such Thing till the Frowns of Fortune had redu∣ced her to this Condition Why it is a strange Thing said I Mistress that you won't take an Answer I tell you again that I have not for you and let that suffice Ah dear Sir said she there was a Time when one of your Name would have given me a kinder Answer"  This brought a Thousand confu∣sed Imaginations into my Head and I felt something awakening within me that I could not account for I stole a Look over my Shoul∣der and saw her wiping a Pair of Eyes that I thought I should not be a Stranger to with a greasy Glove and the Lappet of her Hood  'I have no small Money about me said I but I'm just at Home and made what Haste I could to my House"  As I was going into my Parlour I heard my Maid disputing the Door  with her  "  Mary  said I let the Gentlewo¦man come in"  As soon as we were alone  fix'd my Eye upon her and ask'd her  "Pray what may your Name be Ah Mr  Bicker∣staff  she replied Is it possible you should have forgot me But indeed the Troubles I have gone thro' since you and I danced toge∣ther at the Mayor's Feast at  Litchfield  would have altered a better Face than I could ever pretend to Whatever Changes Time and Trouble may have made in you said I I'm sure it has not made so much in me but that I am mightily concerned to know what has happened to you since I am now assured you can be no other than Mrs  Olivia Darkin  for whom once I pass'd so many uneasy Mi∣nutes Well Mr  Bickerstaff  I must ownBut pray sit down said IAnd  Mary  D'ye hear Bring me a Pint of that Sack in the Corner and bake a Toast Well pray go on Why truly Sir as I was saying I did perceive you had a Kindness for me but alas What could you expect of a giddy∣headed young Thing as I was in those Days For you must know Sir that Mr  MacCarrot  that you saw at our House had engaged my Affections before I came from the BoardingSchool but I am sure I have lived to repent it every Vein of my Heart that ever I cross'd the Seas with him In short Sir we were no sooner married but he carried me over with him to the County of  Kerry  where he had Relations who were well enough to pass and what with their Assistance and that little we had of our own we made a pretty good Shift for some Years 'till the War breaking out in  Ireland  my Husband was too zealous for the Popish Interest and entered into the Service of the late K  Js  I told him  over and over what would come of it He gave me no Answer but that it was his Opi∣nion and he would stand and fall by it and Child said he you are a Fool if you don't turn Catholick Never talk on it said I I'll die a Thousand Deaths before I'll change my Religion and so he never press'd me any more about it But as I had foretold so it happened he was killed at the Siege of  Li∣merick  and our House plundered I may safely say they did not leave me the Value of this Rag to wind about my Finger"  And  en she burst out a Crying  "Ha said I this is a melancholy Story indeed come here's to you I'll promise you 'tis a Glass of good Sack But pray did his Relations do nothing for you Relations Ah Lord said she they were his Relations not mine and when he went all went with him You must think Sir I went to 'em but they looked as coldly upon me as if I came to take the Bread out of their Mouths At last they agreed among 'em to take one of my Girls off my Hands and gave me Five Pounds to carry me over to  England  But when I came there I was never the near for I had anger'd all my Friends in Marrying and I dare say some of 'em were glad to see me in such Necessity At last an Aunt of mine sent me Word I should be welcome to her in  Staf∣fordshire  where being a Widow and old and infirm I was serviceable to her in the Nature of her Housekeeper It pleased God she died in about Two Years after and left me in Money and Goods to the Value of Four hundred Pounds Upon this I pluck'd up a good Heart again and had several Of∣fers made me from substantial Farmers of good Repute in the Neighbourhood but it  was a Sort of Life I did not care for and having no Thoughts of altering my Condi∣tion nothing would serve me but I must come up to Town here and having a Stock of Linen and other good Things that my Aunt left me I hired a handsome House and took Lodgers Well why this put you in a good Way again said I interrupting her Yes indeed Sir said she I had several Par∣liamentMen and other very good Gentlemen in my House and lived as creditably as any Body in my Employ so that in a few Years I thought I should be able to do very well for my Children Pray what Children might you have said I besides the  Girl  you were mentioning in  Ireland  I had a Son and Daughter said she and as hopeful they were though I say it as any Woman would wish to be Mother of But there was a Gen∣tleman in my House who belonged to the Army a civil Man to my thinking as ever came under any Body's Roof I never heard an Oath come out of his Mouth he paid me punctually every  Monday  Morning and was so easy and contented that I thought I could never do enough for him It seems as I found afterwards he took a Liking to m  Betty  and I believe there was no Love lo  for I observed the Girl would go mopin  about the House and I would often s  to her What's come to you Child Methin  you take no Pleasure in any Thing you do  She would make me no Answer but on  Day as we were alone I put it Home  her and then she up and told me th  whole Story that she had been overpe  ¦suaded by the Captain and was so far gon  that it was in vain to conceal it any long  Soon after she was delivered of a fine Bo  and as soon as she was up Well Mother says she I will not live here to be a Disgrace to you I'll try my Fortune in the  Indies  So I agreed with a  WestIndia  Captain of my Acquaintance since the Girl had such a Mind to travel into foreign Parts but the first News I had by the Return of the Ships was that she died of the Distemper of the Coun∣try Still I was in Hopes my Son  Joseph  would do well but he was got in with an idle Gang who would send for him at all Hours in the Night I was fond of him and sed him with Money till I was almost redu∣ced again in Hopes to reclaim him by fair Means At other Times I would talk to him seriously and tell him he had had another Sort of an Education But nothing would do I found I was but a Woman he would give me the Hearing and then away to his Comrades But one Day above the rest there was a great Noise of a Robbery and Murder that had been committed upon  BagshotHeath  and my Son among others was taken up and carried to  Newgate  Upon his Tryal he confessed he was among them and was found guilty but he declared with his last Breath he was not concerned in the Murder I was with him every Day after his Condem∣nation He told me all along he was willing to die but I did what I could with Money and Friends till I had nothing left to get his Pardon and a Gentleman who belonged to the Court and had formerly been my Lodger gave me Hopes to the last and bid me fear nothing  o that my Son should not suffer To keep him in Heart I told him we should get a Reprieve But when he found he must go into the Cart he fixed his Eyes stedfastly upon me and only said Mo∣ther  is it come to this I repented afterwards that I had deluded my poor Child with vain Promises for he relied so much upon them that I am afraid he did not make so good an End as he should have done It was a bad End indeed said I for an only Son but Children you know are certain Troubles and uncertain Comforts However what's past can't be recalled I am sorry for your Misfortunes but pray tell me Do you want any little Assistance that I can give you Sir said she I'll conceal nothing from you I want for nothing I have between Six and Seven Hundred Pounds by me which I have pick'd up in this Way and hope that will put me above Dependance for the rest of my Life"  I drank again to her to renew our old Acquaintance and so we parted She left me so full of Reflections upon the Escape I had had when I would have married her that I could not sleep a Wink that Night

From my own Apartment in ChannelRow  April  EVER since I have taken upon me the Of∣fice of Censor of  Great Britain  it has been my principal Care to guard my self against all Manner of just Reproaches which might depretiate those wholesome Maxims which I every Day distribute to the Publick and to fence against all those Vices which render old Age contemptible And 'tis wholly owing to this that I have never fallen into that common Weakness of finding Fault with the present only for an Excuse to cry up the last Age I must own I have had a great Itch to do it but as I weigh every Thing before I attempt doing it I find upon mature Deliberation that ge∣nerally  speaking the Age is virtuously inclined and that what Faults it has proceed chiefly from excellent Principles and might be made Virtues with a very little Trouble For in the first Place I observe that Part of Mankind where one would least expect it to be wonder∣fully inclined to Oeconomy I mean the Young and the Fair of Quality No Frost Snow no  East Wind can hinder a large Set of People from going to the Park in  February  no Dust nor Heat in  June  And this is come to such an intrepid Regularity that those a∣greeable Creatures that would shriek at an hind Wheel in a deep Gutter are not afraid in their proper Sphere of the Disorder and Danger of Seven Rings But as the City does generally value it self upon outdoing t'other End of the Town in these Matters so I have long observed with infinite Satisfaction a certain Coach which I esteem particularly It belongs to a worthy Trader in or near  WellClose  and no Disparagement to  Charles  's  Wain  it keeps its Course as regularly as any Fix'd Star of 'em all The Family to which this wondrous Automaton belongs goes to Dinner as soon as Morning Service is over they set out in the Cool of the Noon about Half an Hour after Twelve and according to the Rule of discreet Travellers make the Coachman drive slowly at first by which they have Two Ad∣vantages one that they see all the Company go to Church in the City and the other that their Horses have Time to empty themselves At  CharingCross  they stop and give the Cattel a Mouthful of Hay have a cool Tankard or the like and any of the Gentlewomen that have Occasion step out of the Coach By the End of  Suffolkstreet  they mend their Pace and  get into a tolerable Trot which brings them so happily to the farthest Part of their Journey and in such good Time that they are there as soon as the best of 'em I remember last Year I was overagainst  Northumberland  House when this Caravan reposed there they were Five of the Fair Sex Three pretty fat ones one very fat and a lean one They were all sure of the Thousand Pounds a Year in the Lottery and almost fell out about their several Ways of Dis∣posing of it The fattest of them said  "If it should please God to take away her Master she would not change her Condition tho' she should get the Thousand Pounds a Year but would lay it up to make her Children love her but if they should prove undutiful she could not tell how far she might be prevailed upon but an't please God she'd never mar∣ry a Seaman again she'd have no more Frights and Twitters at every puff of Wind"  The next in Size to her Ladiship said  "Laud Mother Why to be sure Forsooth you won't have it you'll have enough without it Child said her Mother Will you never leave off that ugly Trick Can't you call a Body Madam I wou'd to God I had sent you to  Chelsey  instead of  Stepney  but 'twas such a great Way off Prithee Sister don't fright your self says another I shall have it mun for I was adreamed and so methought there came a fine Gentleman to me in a Cinnamoncolour'd Coat and Gold Buttons and a long Wig and a Gold Chain about his Neck and so he ax'd me to go with him to his CountryHouse at  Grinitch  and methought he had my Lord Mayor's Bage and Tisdale and the City Musick and he said as how 'twas because I had a great Forti    The Third said she was sure she should have it because she had a Mind to it and if she got it she'd come away immediately to that very Coffeehouse yonder and send for one of those young Officers out and marry him immediately and then Madam I'll come and wait upon you in my Glass Chariot and pass my Time like a little Queen Ah  Mal  said the old one thou art a mad Girl thou'dst think on't twiceAy so I shall Forty Times said she till the Lottery is drawn I shall do nothing but think on't But Sister  Rachel  says nothing Why says the lean one I'm satisfied none of you will have it for 'tis come into my Head just now that I shall have it my self and I'll take a House in  DevonshireSquare  and get a Set to play all Day long at  Lue  and never marry but despise Mankind though now I think on't if any of you have a Girl to my Mind per∣haps I may breed her up and when I die leave her all I have and then she may be married to a Lord Look'ee there now"  It grieved me mightily to see the Coach drive a∣way at this Period and I could not but make this Reflection How Five People could be sanguine enough to expect the great Lot which was One hundred and fifty thousand to One whether either of them had it and of the many Thousand Owners of Coaches in and about this great City not one of them was afraid of having their Necks broke at the  Park  where the Odds are not above Two hundred at most nay Folks are glad to borrow a Chance for being crippled I concluded with my self that those who come from the wary Part of the Town had perhaps had the Precau∣tion to insure in  ExchangeAlley  without which  I thought it impossible Ladies should venture to travel so far to run such Dangers for we may perceive by the Number of Offices now in Town that it is no longer in Fashion to ride Post to Sieges But the Mystery was soon explained as to these  WellClose  Pilgrims for that very Evening my honest Friend  Faber  would needs take me from St  James  's  Park  with him to eat a cold Chicken and Sallad and drink a Flask of  Flurrence  as he calls it and as we were looking out at Window in the  PallMall  and seeing the Coaches going to the  Park  I saw my Lady and her Daughters re∣turn I had an Inclination to smile at first but upon Reflection I could not but admire the Sagacity of those People who having a great Way to go come out of the  Park  when others are going in for by that Means they see all the Company and avoid all the Danger  The TATLER N  o    Potanda ferens Infantibus Ubera magnis  Juv  From  Tuesd May  to  Thursd May    From my own Apartment in ChannelRow  May  I Cannot

the Persons who are possessed with it for they are generally shortliv'd and give Occasion to their Mothers to say The poor Child had too much Sense to live long It is therefore my Opinion That this great Vice takes its Beginning entirely from taking Chil∣dren too soon f om the Breast and admitting them so early to the Use of a luxurious Variety in their Food which forces an Understanding before its due Time I have therefore from a  long Observation amongst young Fellows as I find them in their Conversation and according to the Subjects which they handle been able to tell the very Day when the Nurse applied the bitter Drug to the Nipple to give them an Aversion to Sucking There was a Law among that wise People the  Romans  That no Man should kill above Thirty Asses at a Time for a Banquet and the Reason was that they being a Creature then esteemed a great Dainty and a vast Consumption of them there was found at length a great Defect of their Milk for the Education of the Offspring of the Common∣wealth to the unspeakable Pain and Labour of the good Women who were otherwise obli∣ged to suckle their Children till they should be fit to carry Arms in Defence of their Coun∣try I have therefore out of a due Respect to such an excellent Example and to prevent the Inconveniencies of these too early Essays in Things of sublime Science ordered the inge∣nious Mr  Charles Bubbleboy  to get made for the Use of the Publick from Time to Time a sufficient Number of SuckingBottles which all young Fellows under the Age of Twenty are to hang with a Chain about their Necks And I likewise ordain That when any Person under the Age above written shall presume to launch out of his Depth in Theoretical Learn∣ing it shall be in the Power of any Bystander to apply the Bottle to his Mouth and make him suck  I hope by this Simplicity of Diet in some reasonable Time so far to reform the Manners of Youth in Conversation that no one under the Age aforementioned shall presume to ex∣ceed the Limits of Grammatical Learning in Discourse and likewise to augment the  Strength and Stature of my Countrymen a  well as their Understandings  It has ever been the Custom of our Family to bring up their Children without endeavou∣ring to improve their Minds till their Bodies were grown to a full Maturity and we were suffered as it were to lie fallow without any Cultivation till the Soil was rich enough to give a full Vigour and Extension to the Seed that should be sown in it For this Reason I was looked upon as a meer Idiot all the Time of my Childhood and lived in a State of Ad∣miration to an Age wherein others are wont to exert egregious Signs of Wisdom I remember very well that I sucked my Mother till I was able to carry my Cradle on my Back and could not speak a Word

politer Parts of Grammatical Learning and are the promising Preludes of future Perfections in the sublime Sciences Those little Epigram∣matical Flowers in which you behold Poetry in her Spring very

entered the School I was struck with a becoming Awe and Veneration to so sa∣cred a Place and the Dignity of the Person presiding in it not without a due Regard to the  Fasces  which are the Symbol of his Au∣thority I could not then forbear taking the Person and Office of a Schoolmaster into a nearer Consideration and to propose him to my Mind in the Abstract with a View of what he teaches  A Schoolmaster is a compleat Treasury of chosen Words from Classick Authors the very Composition of whose Body does not seem to owe it self so much to the Four Physicical Ele∣ments as to the Four and

amusing my self with these Thoughts which to some may seem too ludi∣crous on so grave a Subject though I profess  t is far from my Intention to lessen the Idea of  o excellent a Function I was

both Sides and decide according to Justice But as my Business at present will not permit me to enter into so large a Field as that Disqui∣sition I have sent you up some Heads  which I would be obliged

to be of very mean Extract but of more despicable Parts lay his extraor∣dinary Chin over a Duke's Shoulder and as familiarly ask him impertinent Questions as if his Equality or Intimacy entitled him

the Box into the Pit that he might have that Opportunity of exposing to Sight his Pearlcoloured Stockings and redtop'd Shoes Another who had a very fine Wig and a Feather in his Hat was forced to sit covered all the Time and spoil the Wig to shew the Feather A Third lest his fring'd Gloves should not be seen underwent the Pain of leaning forwards for a whole Play together upon the fore Part of the Box setting his Arms upright upon his Elbows A Fourth who was in low Circumstances of Stature every now and then with great Labour heaved into Sight a rich SwordKnot And many others were variously hamper'd and perplex'd in displaying their several Fineries To remedy which In∣conveniences I at first thought it might be pro∣per to advise the Owners of the Playhouse to appropriate each Division of the SideBoxes to a several Dress and to distinguish them by In∣scriptions over them in large Letters in these and the like Words  Redtop'd Shoes  SwordKnots  Feathers  Fring'd Gloves  Gold SnuffBoxes  Dress'd at all Points  By which Means the whole Audience would at one Glance be appriz'd of the particular Or∣nament of every Person in that Division  But reflecting since that this Invention would be of too narrow an Use it being likely to ex∣tend only to the Playhouse and perhaps a Ca∣thedral or two I have applied my self to find out something that may be of general Ease to the Beau Monde proceeding in this Manner I considered what might be the Rise or Cause of all that vast Variety of Fashions which we Yearly see This I found to be solely the Oftentation of Riches for upon this Accoun  it is that People have no sooner one Sui  brought Home from the Taylor's but to shew that their Purse is not exhausted they bespeak another which that it may appear to the most careless Eye to be a late Purchase must differ from the former not only in Matter but in Form This in the present Course of Things will be an eternal Occasion of the Mutability of Fashions and as a Man has but one Way of being in the Right and Ten thousand of be∣ing in the Wrong so there can be but one Dress commodious and as soon as we deviate from that we shall find all the rest trouble∣some I therefore thought that if a Medium could be invented by me whereby both the Fair and the Foul Sex might at once be rid of the Incumbrances of the Mode and be conti∣nued in the Reputation of Profuseness I should do an acceptable Piece of Service to my Country and procure to my self Peace of Mind in a Consciousness that I had not lived in vain This I hope I have at last happily ef∣fected by the following Project  An Office shall be  ed by the Name of  The Equivalent Office  In this Office any Person shall be admitted to pay down such Sum or Sums of Money as he or she shall be desirous to expend in any particular  Orna∣ment or Ornaments Upon the Payment of such Sum or Sums and Intimation given what Piece of Finery it is designed for there shall be made out a neat Ticket or Creden∣tial in the Language of the Office to be worn in the most conspicuous Part of the Bo∣dy certifying to all Men that the Wearer thereof has actually laid out so much Money as would have purchased such an Ornament therein described and requiring them to deem esteem and repute the said Wearer as  ipso facto  wearing the said Ornament any Thing in outward Appearance to the contrary notwithstanding  The Advantages that will arise from this Of∣fice are innumerable I shall only hint at a few which will put the Reader into a Way of discovering many more  By Vertue of proper Credentials Gentlemen may wear Wigs of such Size and Colour as shall best suit with their Features and Complexions and yet have the Credit of Light FullBottoms Thick Legs may be diminished by black Stock∣ings and SpindleShanks enlarged by white yet both be reputed as Scarlet Silk Corns may be avoided by keeping the Feet in easy old Shoes and yet the Owner maintain the Reputation of having a new Pair every Day Ladies by these Credentials may yet farther enlarge their Petticoats which in their present Method is impossible to be done They may make their HeadDresses proportionable to their Petticoats and they may patch their Faces with Diamonds without Disparagement to their Eyes  I am not insensible how highly beneficial this Scheme might be in raising Money for the  Publick but a former Project of mine ha∣ving been rejected with Scorn when I offer∣ed it and Two Years after made Use of with good Success but without any Acknow∣ledgment of or to the Inventor I am dis∣gusted from making any more Proposals of that Nature I had once a Mind to apply the Profits to Charitable Uses but then I thought again that doing Good with the Money would be so prodigious an Altera∣tion in the Application of it that it would create an insuperable Objection against the whole Undertaking in those who were likely to be my Contributors so that I have at last resolved to apply it wholly to my own Benefit  The TATLER N  o    Hae Nuga Seria ducunt  In Mala derisum simul exceptumque sinistri  Hor  From  Tuesday May  to  Thursd May    From my own Apartment in  ChannelRow  May  IT is impossible to describe Wit by Generals We must descend to Particulars and trace it Part by Part For Wit is like Beauty We may admire the Air the Symmetry the whole Collection of Charms but we cannot express it without running over the Lip the Neck the Eye the Breasts and every individual Fea∣ture At present I shall examine that Sort of Wit we call  Turns  These appear to Advan∣tage in some Parts of Poetry which make their proper Province but lose their Lustre when misplaced and have nothing to excuse them but an unbounded irregular Fancy The Ornaments of Poetry like those of Dress owe their  Ecclat  in a great Measure to their Situa∣tion A Turn that would have given Life to an  Epigram  will make an Image in  Heroicks  particoloured and ridiculous as the same Jew∣el which adorned the Ear or the Neck would in the Nose look monstrous and rueful This  Misapplication then is a Species of False Wi  and has a large Share in the Degeneracy  our modern Writers I should be apt to di¦stinguish the  Muse  that inspired this Sort  Wit from the Divine  Calliope  as I would a  C  ¦quet  from a  Fine Woman  One is all Air an  Affectation the other refines upon good Sense  yet converses in proper Words and Sentiments A Turn is the Creature of Fancy that after it is born is put under the Tuition of the Judg∣ment which is to assign it a proper Station and to stint its Extravagancies When it de∣pends upon the Words or Style great Care is to be used that it may not dwindle into  P  and  Jingle  and when it consists chiefly in the Thought the same Diligence is required that it may not sink into any of those  Flowers  of the School or  CommonPlaces  of Youth by which they gradually ascend to this Attainment Both the  Real  and  Verbal Turn  owe their Beau∣ty to Novelty for there is no greater Per∣fection in these Witticisms than what arises from that sudden Surprize they make upon the Imagination They seem to take their Name from their Nature for they consist mostly in advancing a Thought or Expression and then making what follows play upon it in an agreeable Way either by retracting what went before or wittily perverting it or comparing it with something that hits the same Fact or Idea to any Degree of Exactness or giving some surprizing Reason for it when it seemed a Paradox Indeed the Variety of Turns is so great and their Beauty so entirely owing to this Variety that it is almost impossible to fix them to any stated Rules A  Turn  being the Product of Fancy it is unnatural to use it but in those gayer and more airy Parts of Poetry where the Fancy is at Liberty to wanton and  gambol In the  Epick  in  Tragedy  or in that Sort of  Elegy  which has Distress for its Subject it would be ridiculous and trifling for here the chief Business belongs to the Judgment and the Fancy is only concerned in ranging for Images and Ideas equal to the Grandeur of the Subject A Hero in a Passion might as well express the high Sentiments of his Soul by laughing at one of the Plumes out of his Hel∣met as by playing with a Turn or a Double Entendre A Lover lamenting the Rigour of his Mistress or a Poet the Loss of his Friend in this sportive Way would make as aukward a Figure as the resigned  Ardelia  when she laughs at the Mischiefs committed by her Monkey though the Loss of her  China  wrings her very Soul or an  Irishman  in his Country Way singing at a Funeral The Ancients had Abundance of this Sort of Wit and used it more discreetly than the Moderns The  Greeks  indeed appear perfect Strangers to it They had other Ways to improve that Mirth which was so natural to them  Anacreon  and  Aristo∣phanes  write in a Way where  Turns  are a Beau∣ty and yet it is very difficult to find so much as one Expression of that Sort in their Works  Homer Hesiod Theocritus  and  Musaeus  have no∣thing like it in their Poems It seems to have begun at  Rome  when  Epigrams  became the common Entertainment of their best People After Supper or over a Bottle in a cool Re∣treat it was their Custom to divert one ano∣ther with reciting or composing three or four  Distichs  that were usually pointed with one of these Turns in which they were smart upon some of the reigning Coxcombs Coquets or Humours of that Age Modern Lampoons were introduced as a  Third  Course at the Ta∣bles of great Men in Imitation of this Custom  A good Part of  Martial  's Epigrams seem  have been made at some of those Conversa¦tions whence we may account for the grea  Inequality in his Works which himself ac¦knowledges  Sunt bona sunt quaedam mediocria sunt mal  plura  For we may imagine that the  Grave  Pieces were made just upon the Whet the  Bright  after the first Bottle and the  Smutty  after a full Dose The Applause that followed up∣on these smart Things tempted the Fraternity to mingle them with their most Serious and Pathetick Works  Ovid  whose great Fault was  Redundante  ran early into a palpable Ex∣travagance this Way In his Exile amidst Cold Hunger Solitude and Distress he indulges this aukward  B  dinery  very feelingly Imagine a generous Fellow touched with the Loss of a Fine Woman and could he find Leisure for so egregious a Turn as  Tu non Inventa Reperta es  Narcissus  is turned into a Flower and well deserved it for playing with his own Misery and making  Flowers  of his Misfortunes When he bursts forth in the most wanton Merriment with  Inopem me Copia fecit  Vellem quod amamus abesset  Roger Anne Rogem Quid deinde rogabo  You would think he were  varying  at  Wert∣minster  and not preparing himself for a real Transformation  Virgil  the most judicious and correct Writer in the World has studiously avoided every Temptation to this Error His  Ignoscenda quidem scirent si agnoscere Manes  Is the only Thing that looks like a  Turn  How carefully does he avoid it in that fine Complaint of  Gallus    Tu procul a Patria nee sit mihi credere tantum  Alpinas Ah Dura Nives  There is all the Beauty of the Analagy in two Words which  Ovid  would have wire∣drawn into two Lines at least For a Professor of  Turns  can never forbear exerting himself when he happens to bring a Scornful Mistress into the Company of Cold and Frost till he has made the Lady a perfect Winterpiece and 'tis all one if Fire had made a Third Per∣son in the Conversation I remember a very celebrated Epigram which begins thus  Me Nive candenti petiit modo  Julia    Where the Author submits to be pelted with Snowballs by his Mistress for Eight Lines to∣gether on Purpose to take the Benefit of this Melting Allegory It would set up an ordina∣ry Critick to take the Moderns to Task upon this single Article the  Misapplication  of  Turns  The Time may perhaps come when I may in Person summon our great  Alexander Theodosius Brutus Anthony Caesar T  Appius  and  Osmyn  to answer their Extravagancies this Way and out of their own Mouths shall condemn them I do not mean for little harm∣less  Turns  made in their Res  eries their cool  Soliloquies or in snipsnap Dialogue with a Priest or a GentlemanUsher but for  Turus  i  Fits of Love and of Madness for  Turus  spoke  in the very Face of Death and of the Gods themselves nay in the very Face of their Mistresses And I am not mistaken if they have not sometimes raised the inordinate Ap∣petite of Wit to the horrid Outrage of a down∣right  Quibble  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursday May  to  Saturd May    A Lover's Meditation on his Mistress  MADAM  THE Hours to me are Ages of Misery they must be insupportable to a Wretch who can never know what Joy is but in her Presence Love may well be defined a restless Impatience to be with those we adore What a miserable Constraint then must I live under who make it my Business to avoid the Mistress of my Soul Where my Heart my Wishes my Thoughts are eternally there I must never be Did she but know what I suffer and how much a Discretion as exact as mine makes one miserable but alas they must love like me that are to guess at my Torments I hardly know I live but by what I endure for her O Nothing can touch my Soul there is no Har∣mony  in Words unless she speaksthem there is no Bliss but in her Smile no Terror but in her Frown nothing worth living for but her Esteem There is this Comfort in an Af∣fliction like mine no other Thing can give me a Moment's Uneasiness She prevents all other Grief she prevents all other Pleasure If the whole World should change its Place and she not concerned I should hardly perceive it Whether Peace or War what Party prevails whose Ruin is near all these Things are now indifferent they employ not my Thoughts My only Impatience is to increase her good Opinion my only Care not to forfeit her Esteem This Thought brings me into one of those terrible Fits of Fear which often seize them that adore her I know I am not in positive Disobedience and a little Equivocation if so much practised in Religion may be indulged in Love I nei∣ther write nor send to her I dare not disobey Sure if there be any Thing like a Fault in this I am safe Who is it is to accuse Who is guilty And I hope I may say What is the Crime This Letter is sent to you meant to her and it came from him but Who are these In this Dress it is to every Body it is to no Body How will you draw up my In∣dictment However let me not be condemn'd unaccus'd unheard save me from being cri∣minal if you can think me so Burn this and there can be but a single Evidence against me your self and there never shall be another This is the plotting Way of your Servant who with less Fear would engage in Treason than in what might offend her too scrupulous Nice∣ness I confess I tremble tho' I can say if this be one it is a new Kind of Sin against which there is no Law  Her Eyes were not more fatal to me the first Time that I saw them than my own have been  false to my Heart ever since if they have  told her a Thousand Times that I die for  Alas How many Tears will that Happin  cost them They have gaz'd upon her th  have confess'd a Passion and should not  Hand declare my Tongue endeavour to de¦scribe it that she might know my Love  as it ought to be The Adoration that I  her is such and no other but what we shou  all pay the Gods were their charming Attri∣butes so visible I was prepared for their  ∣tal Influence before I saw her Eyes I was be∣witch'd by her Syren Tongue before I heard it I lov'd the Spring from whence she came and my Soul follows the enticing Stream with Plea∣sure I knew there must be Wit and Fire be∣fore I heard so and I found more than was spoken of Thus I was struck by Prepossession and the Poison first instilled into my Heart be∣fore I saw or knew her can never be removed from thence by all that I shall ever see or know I would not profane a Confession as sincere as ever was a dying Man's with the least Aug∣mentation of Truth I will not pretend that I have not endeavoured to remove by any other Object a Stroke of Fate as I may call it that has given and will give me such Uneasiness Were I to make a Wish for a Friend he should have many HalfPassions but none such as I have felt for her  O This would content me alone that she might know how long I have struggled against her Charms in vain  As the Beginning of my Fate was extraordi∣nary I think all the Steps of it have been and will be out of the common Road The Foun∣dation of a common Passion is a Desire to please ones self but the Aim of mine is only to please her I adore  Could it be more Satisfaction to her to have  e wretched than happy I should chuse the  rst and find some Satisfaction in Misery But what I cannot endure is to be indifferent to  er to be eternally thinking of her and never  hought of by her Heavens preserve me from  his and I willingly in every Thing else sub∣  it to Fate  O how I fear her Wit her Judgment that Distinction that lets no Folly escape I fear her  ut upon this Score for sure I am all her Pe∣  etration can never discover the least Contra∣  iction the least Deceit in any Word the least Want of Respect in any Action Sure I am no Time can ever discover the least Diminution in  y Zeal and must I nevertheless fear this most  dored Lady should employ that OverStock of Wit she hath to ridicule the Sufferings of a  reaking Heart so faithful so submissive so  incere O How shall I express my self What  hall I say Or is it possible to be silent There  a distracted Language she does not under∣  tand the Dialect is particular to them that  ove and the cruel Lady will find no Sense in  because she is insensible She must not then play the Critick too severely if she should chance to hear my Complaints She must ex∣cuse my accusing her of Ignorance What is it she does not understand but Love Vows Curses Melancholy Madness Hopes Despair Shunning Pursuing Passion Discretion Im∣patience Resignation all these in one Letter she would call a romantick Heap of Contra∣dictions shuffled together yet they do all a∣gree in me and work at once in my distracted Mind If the greatest Wit had put them toge∣ther with the utmost Art and Passion they would express less than I feel The Thoughts would be below my Love and not above the Truth  Who can teach me to write to this terri  Lady that ignorant of the Fatality of  Charms might suspect the Effects of the  and when they are but faintly painted wo  think the Colours fierce What can I have  course to but Plainness and Sincerity S  then without Offence I may tell this Tr  What can the Admiration of her Wit the  ¦dence of her Generosity and Truth added  these that charming Agreeableness in eve  Word in every Look in every Action W  can all these produce but Love with the ut  Passion O there the Criminal Word is  and yet she cannot be displeased though  without Virtue without Wit with little  ¦putation might pretend to be angry  Were it too much for a Man she hath broug  to the Brink of Despair for a Man that wo  die a Thousand Deaths to serve her to who  Life is a Burthen unless she make it easier  him O were it too much to beg Leave wh  he scarce ever sees her when he dare ne  speak that he might sometimes ease his So  in a respectful Line Has not every Body ete  ¦nal Opportunities of speaking to her And  I that suffer more than ever Man did not da  almost to come near her I cannot doubt b  you will judge impartially upon this Occasio  Is it possible after having gazed upon tho  searching Eyes to escape their Power Is i  possible to hear her Words and cease adorin  her Is it possible to love to the Distractio  that they do who know her and not langui  eternally after the Sight of her Is it possible when there is no Hopes of seeing her to sup¦port the cruel Absence without writing to her I know what you would say for you  self Think then what is the miserable Condi∣tion of him who struggles with all these seem∣ing Impossibilities but to live near her and  be as far from her as the  Antipodes  And if I never see her only for some hasty Moments in an Age and in these Separations not permitted to give the least Ease to my distracted Soul O were not Dying preferable to this restless Life For I fright my self if I write what I never in∣tend to send and I awake in Terrors if I but dream of her My hard Fa  e condemns me to adore her in all the opposite and most torment∣  ng Circumstances of Love with a Distraction  eading to Madness yet with a Reservedness that would shame Philosophy and with a Re∣spect might suffice a Deity with an Impatience that gives an eternal Rack to my Soul yet could I wait Hours Days and Weeks for one Moment's Sight of her O the false Fires with which the persecuting Fops afflict your Sex Every Way false They are not such as warm my Breast Though I could leap through Flames to come to her and not feel more Heat though I could swim through Seas and not quench the Flame yet I love with that Cool∣ness and Temper with that Command over my Passion that rather than bring her to the least Inconveniency I would renounce the ut∣most Happiness if it were in my Reach One would think this were enough to be allowed the most passionate the most miserable of Men Misery beyond this is hardly to be conceived This seems Torment enough in Love to drag an afflicted Heart through so many distracted Fears for such an Eternity But to have lived accused of having deserved her Anger to think I was accounted Criminal that knew the ten∣der faithful Passion of my Soul to live thus for Ages for many Months without obtaining one happy to be justified without doing any Thing rash or indiscreet to show my Innocence This you will sure allow to have been Torment and Discretion beyond any Example  But I eternally find Fault with the faint D  ¦scriptions I make of what I suffer and shou  have an eternal Task indeed were I to begi  again till I could satisfy my self in what I say  her I love This and this alone justifies  forbidding the Attempt since she only forbi  what Impossibility prevents for were my Pa  ¦sion to be described it would not be unfit  her to hear Not to complain and endure  much is impossible but to hope for C  without being able to describe the Disea  seems Madness therefore alas I ask I see  I hope for none Let her but give me Opi  to allay my Grief and only help me langui  out Life in less painful Love What Word  what Language can express my passionate R  ¦spect or give the least Idea of the Distracti  of my Soul She methinks and she alone th  is capable of creating it might conceive i  O were it but conceived I should not wholl  be left unpitied in the wretched Impossibility  one Moment's Happiness or Quiet She wou  think with some Conscience that from the fir  Moment I saw I heard her speak I have la  ¦guished out my Life in neverceasing Uneas  ¦ness Racks are forbidden for our Bodies b  our Laws and is it lawful for her to torme  and crueify my Soul Against the happy M  ¦ment that I see her next may some genero  Friend advise her to consult that Heart of her  which would shew more Compassion where i  were less necessary Let her
