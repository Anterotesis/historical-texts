 THE JOURNEY A FRAGMENT PRICE ONE SHILLING  THE JOURNEY A FRAGMENT BY C CHURCHILL  LONDON PRINTED FOR JOHN CHURCHILL Executor to the late C CHURCHILL and Sold by W FLEXNEY near Gray'sInnGate Holborn MDCCLXV  THE JOURNEY  SOME of my  Friends  for  Friends  I must suppose  All who not daring to appear my foes  Feign great good will and not more full of spite  Than full of craft under false colours fight  Some of my  Friends  so lavishly I print  As more in sorrow than in anger hint  Tho' that indeed will scarce admit a doubt  That I shall run my stock of Genius out  My no great stock and publishing so fast  Must needs become a Bankrupt at the last  "The Husbandman to spare a thankful soil  "Which rich in disposition pays his toil  "More than a hundred fold which swells his store  "E'en to his wish and makes his barns run o'er  "By long Experience taught who teaches best  "Foregoes his hopes awhile and gives it rest  "The Land allow'd its losses to repair  "Refresh'd and full in strength delights to wear  "A second Youth and to the Farmer's eyes  "Bids richer crops and double harvests rise  "Nor think this practice to the earth confin'd  "It reaches to the culture of the Mind  "The Mind of Man craves rest and cannot bear  "Tho' next in pow'r to Gods continual care  "Genius himself nor here let Genius frown  "Must to ensure his vigour be laid down  "And fallow'd well had CHURCHILL known but this  "Which the most slight observer scarce could miss  "He might have flourish'd twenty years or more  "Tho' now  alas  poor Man worn out in four  Recover'd from the vanity of youth  I feel  alas  this melancholly truth  Thanks to each cordial each advising Friend  And am if not too late resolv'd to mend  Resolv'd to give some respite to my pen  Apply myself once more to Books and Men  View what is present what is past review  And my old stock exhausted lay in new  For twice six moons let winds turn'd Porters bear  This oath to Heav'n for twice six moons I swear  No Muse shall tempt me with her Siren lay  Nor draw me from improvement's thorny way  Verse I abjure nor will forgive that Friend  Who in my hearing shall a Rime commend  It cannot beWhether I will or no  Such as they are my thoughts in measure flow  Convinc'd determin'd I in prose begin  But e're I write one sentence Verse creeps in  And taints me thro' and thro' by this good light  In Verse I talk by day I dream by night  If now and then I curse my curses chime  Nor can I pray unless I pray in rime  E'en now I err in spite of Common Sense  And my Confession doubles my offence  Rest then my  Friends  spare spare your precious breath  And be your slumbers not less sound than death  Perturbed Spirits rest nor thus appear  To waste your counsels in a spendthrift's ear  On your grave lessons I cannot subsist  Nor e'en in verse become  Oeconomist    Rest then my  Friends  nor hateful to my eyes  Let Envy in the shape of Pity rise  To blast me e'er my time with patience wait  'Tis no long interval propitious Fate  Shall glut your pride and ev'ry Son of phlegm  Find ample room to censure and condemn  Read some three hundred lines no easy task  But probably the last that I shall ask  And give me up for ever wait one hour  Nay not so much Revenge is in your pow'r  And Ye may cry e'er Time hath turn'd his glass  Lo what  We  prophecied is come to pass  Let Those who Poetry in Poems claim  Or not read this or only read to blame  Let Those who are by fiction's charms enslav'd  Return me thanks for half a crown wellsav'd  Let Those who love a little gall in rime  Postpone their purchase now and call next time  Let Those who void of Nature look for art  Take up their money and in peace depart  Let Those who energy of diction prize  For BILLINGSGATE quit FLEXNEY and be wise  Here is no lie no gall no art no force  Mean are the words and such as come of course  The Subject not less simple than the lay  A plain unlabour'd journey of a Day  Far from Me now be ev'ry tuneful Maid  I neither ask nor can receive their aid  Pegasus  turn'd into a common hack  Alone I jog and keep the beaten track  Nor would I have the Sisters of the hill  Behold their Bard in such a Dishabille  Absent but only absent for a time  Let Them caress some dearer son of Rime  Let Them as far as Decency permits  Without suspicion play the fool with Wits  'Gainst Fools be guarded 'tis a certain rule  Wits are safe things there's danger in a Fool  Let Them tho' modest GRAY more modest wooe  Let Them with MASON bleat and bray and cooe  Let Them with FRANKLIN proud of some small Greek  Make Sophocles disguis'd in English speak  Let Them with GLOVER o'er Medea doze  Let Them with DODSLEY wail Cleone's woes  Whilst He fine feeling creature all in tears  Melts as they melt and weeps with weeping Peers  Let Them with simple WHITEHEAD taught to creep  Silent and soft lay FONTENELLE asleep  Let Them with BROWNE contrive no vulgar trick  To cure the dead and make the living sick  Let Them in Charity to MURPHY give  Some old French piece that he may steal and live  Let Them with  antick  FOOTE subscriptions get  And advertise a Summerhouse of Wit  Thus or in any better way They please  With these great Men or with great Men like these  Let Them their appetite for laughter feed  I on my Journey all Alone proceed  If fashionable grown and fond of pow'r  With  hum'rous  SCOTS let Them disport their hour  Let Them dance fairy like round OSSIAN's tomb  Let Them forge  lies  and  histories  for HUME  Let Them with HOME the very Prince of verse  Make something like a Tragedy in  Erse    Under dark Allegory's flimsy veil  Let Them with OGILVIE spin out a tale  Of rueful length Let Them plain things obscure  Debase what's truly rich and what is poor  Make poorer still by jargon most uncouth  With ev'ry pert prim Prettiness of Youth  Born of false Taste with Fancy like a Child  Not knowing what It cries for running wild  With bloated Stile by Affectation taught  With much false Colouring and little Thought  With Phrases strange and Dialect decreed  By Reason never to have pass'd the  Tweed    With Words which Nature meant each other's foe  Forc'd to compound whether they will or no  With such materials Let Them if They will  To prove at once their pleasantry and skill  Build up a Bard to war 'gainst Common Sense  By way of Compliment to Providence  Let Them with ARMSTRONG taking leave of Sense  Read musty lectures on  Benevolence    Or conn the pages of his gaping  Day    Where all his former Fame was thrown away  Where all but barren labour was forgot  And the vain stiffness of a  Letter'd  SCOT  Let Them with ARMSTRONG pass the term of light  But not one hour of darkness when the Night  Suspends this mortal coil when Mem'ry wakes  When for our past misdoings Conscience takes  A deep revenge when by Reflexion led  She draws his curtains and looks comfort dead  Let ev'ry Muse be gone in vain He turns  And tries to pray for sleep an Aetna burns  A more than Aetna in his coward breast  And Guilt with vengeance arm'd forbids him rest  Tho' soft as Plumage from young Zephyr's wing  His couch seems hard and no relief can bring  INGRATITUDE hath planted daggers there  No Good Man can deserve no brave Man bear  Thus or in any better way They please  With these great Men or with great Men like these  Let Them their appetite for laughter feed  I on my Journey all Alone proceed
