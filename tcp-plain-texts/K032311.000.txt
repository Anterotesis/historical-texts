 Love at a Venture A COMEDY As it is ACTED By his Grace the Duke of  Grafton  's Servants AT THE NEW THEATRE IN BATH  Written by the Author of the  Gamester  LONDON  Printed for  John Chantry  at the Sign of  Lincolon  's  InnSquare  at  LincolonsInnBackGate  Price  s    d  To his Grace  Henry  Duke of  Beaufort  Marquiss and Earl of  Worcester  Baron  Herbert  of  Gower Rawland Chepstow c  May it please your Grace  IT has been a general and allow'd Custom in all Ages for Poets to lay their Works at some Great Man's Feet and always to chuse such as are eminently Conspicuous for their Vertues This made  Horace  single out  Mecenas  and  Terence  court the Protection of  Scipio  and  Lelius  which encourages me in humble Imitation of those Great Men to beg  your Grace's  Pratronage for the following Scenes It would be a kind of Poetical Sacrilege to offer them else where since it wou'd rob  your Grace  of the Homage to which your Quality Sense and good Nature your Indulgence to Poetry and your Judgment as well as Love for Musick give you an indisputable Title Musick is the Soul of Poesy and  Numbers sound most sweet when grac'd with soft harmonious Strains  I am the more forward to pay this just Debt  My Lord  because without the help of Fiction consequently without the help of Flattery I have a large Field for a Panegyrick which however I shall prudently decline for fear of degrading your Vertues through my Inability and Meanness of Expression Yet I cannot forbear mentioning the Excellency of  your Grace's  Temper your Goodness and Affability and the Regard you have for that generous Custom which formerly distinguish'd the  English  Nation from all the rest of the World  viz  Hospitality which makes  your Grace  admired and beloved to a degree next Adoration by all who are so happy as to approach you  Your Grace  is a true Pattern of Nobility The prudent Management of your Affairs your Voluntary Retreat from Noise and Vice shew you have a right Conception of the Joys of Life as  Cowley  has describ'd them To favour your Retirement Nature seems to have taken peculiar Care to indulge  your Grace's  Solitude with all her choice Productions For your Gardens exceed all that Poets feign  That  your Grace  may long enjoy those Blessings in perfect Health and unmolested Peace together with your Beauteous Lady and that your Connubial Joys may produce a perfect Copy of their Parents which may adorn the Age to come with the same Singularity of Goodness as  your Grace  does the present are  My Lord  the sincere Wishes of  Your Graces most Obedient most Devoted Humble Servant  Susanna Carroll  PROLOGUE  LEast any here shou'd blame our Author's toil  For stroling with her Boat a Hundred Mile  By me to such She does this Reason give  Seeing how many Men by Ventures live  She straight embark'd and hoisted Sail to try  What pure good Nature in these Bottoms lye  Beside she hop'd she might divert you too  By adding to your Pleasures something new  The Vertue of these Baths had ne're been known  If or'e these Hills no Man had ventur'd down  Here Doctors Venturing come in hopes of Fees  And Patients Venture on their Skill for Ease  For Wealth the Merchant Ventures on the Seas  The Lawyer Ventures upon any Cause  And Venturing Client's begger'd by the Laws  The Lover Ventures to Address the Fair  With broken Speeches and dejected Air  She runs a Venture who relieves his care  The Gamester Ventures to improve his Store  And having lost he Ventures on for more  The  London  Punk in Garret shut all Day  At Night with last half Crown she Ventures to the Play  The Amorous Cully meeting with the Miss  Ventures at WaterGruel for a Kiss  Since every Man Adventures in his way  Hither our Author ventur'd with her Play  And hopes her Profits will her Charge defray  If that bright Circle Ventures to adorn her Day  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Miss  Jacobella Power  IN spight of dull insipid Rules I'm come  To learn what Fate attends my Virgin Bloom  Strange things I've heard this Night that makes me fear  Least I shou'd find such Entertainment here  You Men are grown so witty in Deceit  That We poor Girls are often ruin'd by't  'Tis pittybut I hope to cross this Play  And be reveng'd on you some other way  Wellbut consider We are tender Things  That Innocence and sprightly Beauty brings  Soft Accents broken Words and yielding Air  Are all the Weapons that attend the Fair  And can you long resist the sweet Temptation  Give us at least a Bill of Reformation  That the succeeding Age may say of you  You dare be Civil tho' you can't be true
