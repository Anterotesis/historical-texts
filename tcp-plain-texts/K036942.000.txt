 DOUGLAS A TRAGEDY  As it is acted at the THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  Non ego sum vates sed prisci conscius aevi  LONDON Printed for A MILLAR in the Strand  MDCCLVII  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr SPARKS  IN antient times when  Britain  's trade was arms  And the lov'd musick of her youth alarms  A godlike race sustain'd fair  England  's fame  Who has not heard of gallant  PIERCY  's name  Ay and of  DOUGLAS  Such illustrious foes  In rival  Rome  and  Carthage  never rose  From age to age bright shone the  British  fire  And every hero was a hero's sire  When powerful fate decreed one warrior's doom  Up sprung the Phoenix from his parent's tomb  But whilst these generous rivals fought and fell  These generous rivals lov'd each other well  Tho' many a bloody field was lost and won  Nothing in hate in honour all was done  When  PIERCY  wrong'd defy'd his prince or peers  Fast came the  DOUGLAS  with his  Scottish  spears  And when proud  DOUGLAS  made his King his foe  For  DOUGLAS PIERCY  bent his  English  bow  Expell'd their native homes by adverse fate  They knock'd alternate at each other's gate  Then blaz'd the castle at the midnight hour  For him whose arms had shook its firmest tower  This night a  DOUGLAS  your protection claims  A wife a mother pity's softest names  The story of her woes indulgent hear  And grant your suppliant all she begs a tear  In confidence she begs and hopes to find  Each  English  breast like noble  PIERCY  's kind  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Lord RANDOLPH  Mr RIDOUT  GLENALVON  Mr SMITH  NORVAL DOUGLAS  Mr BARRY  STRANGER  Mr SPARKS  SERVANTS  WOMEN

melancholy gloom  Accords with my soul's sadness and draws forth  The voice of sorrow from my bursting heart  Farewel a while I will not leave you long  For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells  Who from the chiding stream or groaning oak  Still hears and answers to MATILDA's moan  O DOUGLAS DOUGLAS If departed ghosts  Are e'er permitted to review this world  Within the circle of that wood thou art  And with the passion of immortals hear'st  My lamentation hear'st thy wretched wife  Weep for her husband slain her infant lost  My brother's timeless death I seem to mourn  Who perish'd with thee on this fatal day  To thee I lift my voice to thee address  The plaint which mortal ear has never heard  O disregard me not though I am call'd  Another's now my heart is wholly thine  Incapable of change affection lies  Buried my DOUGLAS in thy bloody grave  But RANDOLPH comes whom fate has made my Lord  To chide my anguish and defraud the dead  Enter  Lord RANDOLPH  Again these weeds of woe say do'st thou well  To feed a passion which consumes thy life  The living claim some duty vainly thou  Bestow'st thy cares upon the silent dead  Lady RANDOLPH  Silent alas is he for whom I mourn  Childless without memorial of his name  He only now in my remembrance lives  Lord RANDOLPH  Time that wears out the trace of deepest anguish  Has past o'er thee in vain Wou'd thou wer't not  Compos'd of grief and tenderness alone  Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir MALCOLM  Strong was his rage eternal his resentment  For when thy brother fell he smil'd to hear  That DOUGLAS' son in the same field was slain  Lady RANDOLPH  Oh rake not up the ashes of my fathers  Implacable resentment was their crime  And grievous has the expiation been  Contending with the DOUGLAS gallant lives  Of either house were lost my ancestors  Compell'd at last to leave their ancient seat  On Tiviot's pleasant banks and now of them  No heir is left Had they not been so stern  I had not been the last of all my race  Lord RANDOLPH  Thy grief wrests to its purposes my words  I never ask'd of thee that ardent love  Which in the breasts of fancy's children burns  Decent affection and complacent kindness  Were all I wish'd for but I wish'd in vain  Hence with the less regret my eyes behold  The storm of war that gathers o'er this land  If I should perish by the Danish sword  MATILDA would not shed one tear the more  Lady RANDOLPH  Thou do'st not think so woeful as I am  I love thy merit and esteem thy virtues  But whither goest thou now  Lord RANDOLPH  Straight to the camp  Where every warrior on the tiptoe stands  Of expectation and impatient asks  Each who arrives if he is come to tell  The Danes are landed  Lady RANDOLPH  O may adverse winds  Far from the coast of Scotland drive their fleet  And every soldier of both hosts return  In peace and safety to his pleasant home  Lord RANDOLPH  Thou speak'st a woman's hear a warrior's wish  Right from their native land the stormy north  May the wind blow till every keel is fix'd  Immoveable in Caledonia's strand  Then shall our foes repent their bold invasion  And roving armies shun the fatal shore  Lady RANDOLPH  War I detest but war with foreign foes  Whose manners language and whose looks are strange  Is not so horrid nor to me so hateful  As that which with our neighbours oft we wage  A river here there an ideal line  By fancy drawn divides the sister kingdoms  On each side dwells a people similar  As twins are to each other valiant both  Both for their valour famous thro' the world  Yet will they not unite their kindred arms  And if they must have war wage distant war  But with each other fight in cruel conflict  Gallant in strife and noble in their ire  The battle is their pastime They go forth  Gay in the morning as to summer sport  When ev'ning comes the glory of the morn  The youthful warrior is a clod of clay  Thus fall the prime of either hapless land  And such the fruit of Scotch and English wars  Lord RANDOLPH  I'll hear no more this melody would make  A soldier drop his sword and doff his arms  Sit down and weep the conquests he has made  Yea like a monk sing rest and peace in heav'n  To souls of warriours in his battles slain  Lady farewel I leave thee not alone  Yonder comes one whose love makes duty light  Enter  ANNA  ANNA  Forgive the rashness of your ANNA's love  Urg'd by affection I have thus presum'd  To interrupt your solitary thoughts  And warn you of the hours that you neglect  And lose in sadness  Lady RANDOLPH  So to lose my hours  Is all the use I wish to make of time  ANNA  To blame thee lady suits not with my state  But sure I am since death first prey'd on man  Never did sister thus a brother mourn  What had your sorrows been if you had lost  In early youth the husband of your heart  Lady RANDOLPH  Oh  ANNA  Have I distrest you with officious love  And illtim'd mention of your brother's fate  Forgive me lady humble tho' I am  The mind I bear partakes not of my fortune  So fervently I love you that to dry  These piteous tears I'd throw my life away  Lady RANDOLPH  What power directed thy unconscious tongue  To speak as thou hast done to name  ANNA  I know not  But since my words have made my mistress tremble  I will speak so no more but silent mix  My tears with hers  Lady RANDOLPH  No thou shalt not be silent  I'll trust thy faithful love and thou shalt be  Henceforth th' instructed partner of my woes  But what avails it Can thy feeble pity  Roll back the flood of neverebbing time  Compell the earth and ocean to give up  Their dead alive  ANNA  What means my noble mistress  Lady RANDOLPH  Didst thou not ask what had my sorrows been  If I in early youth had lost a husband  In the cold bosom of the earth is lodg'd  Mangl'd with wounds the husband of my youth  And in some cavern of the ocean lyes  My child and his  ANNA  O lady most rever'd  The tale wrapt up in your amazing words  Deign to unfold  Lady RANDOLPH  Alas an ancient feud  Hereditary evil was the source  Of my misfortunes Ruling fate decreed  That my brave brother should in battle save  The life of DOUGLAS' son our house's foe  The youthful warriours vow'd eternal friendship  To see the vaunted sister of his friend  Impatient DOUGLAS to Balarmo came  Under a borrow'd nameMy heart he gain'd  Nor did I long refuse the hand he begg'd  My brother's presence authoriz'd our marriage  Three weeks three little weeks with wings of down  Had o'er us flown when my lov'd lord was call'd  To fight his father's battles and with him  In spite of all my tears did MALCOLM go  Scarce were they gone when my stern sire was told  That the false stranger was lord DOUGLAS' son  Frantic with rage the baron drew his sword  And question'd me Alone forsaken faint  Kneeling beneath his sword fault'ring I took  An oath equivocal that I ne'er would  Wed one of DOUGLAS name Sincerity  Thou first of virtues let no mortal leave  Thy onward path altho' the earth should gape  And from the gulf of hell destruction cry  To take dissimulation's winding way  ANNA  Alas how few of woman's fearful kind  Durst own a truth so hardy  Lady RANDOLPH  The first truth  Is easiest to avow This moral learn  This precious moral from my tragic tale  In a few days the dreadful tidings came  That DOUGLAS and my brother both were slain  My lord my life my husbandmighty God  What had I done to merit such affliction  ANNA  My dearest lady Many a tale of tears  I've listen'd to but never did I hear  A tale so sad as this  Lady RANDOLPH  In the first days  Of my distracting grief I found myself  As women wish to be who love their lords  But who durst tell my father The good priest  Who join'd our hands my brother's antient tutour  With his lov'd MALCOLM in the battle fell  They two alone were privy to the marriage  On silence and concealment I resolv'd  Till time should make my father's fortune mine  That very night on which my son was born  My nurse the only confident I had  Set out with him to reach her sister's house  But nurse nor infant have I ever seen  Or heard of ANNA since that fatal hour  My murder'd childhad thy fond mother fear'd  The loss of thee she had loud fame defy'd  Despis'd her father's rage her father's grief  And wander'd with thee thro' the scorning world  ANNA  Not seen nor heard of then perhaps he lives  Lady RANDOLPH  No It was dark December wind and rain  Had beat all night Across the Carron lay  The destin'd road and in it's swelling flood  My faithful servant perish'd with my child  O hapless son of a most hapless sire  But they are both at rest and I alone  Dwell in this world of woe condemn'd to walk  Like a guilttroubl'd ghost my painful rounds  Nor has despiteful fate permitted me  The comfort of a solitary sorrow  Tho' dead to love I was compell'd to wed  RANDOLPH who snatch'd me from a villain's arms  And RANDOLPH now possesses the domains  That by Sir MALCOLM's death on me devolv'd  Domains that should to DOUGLAS' son have giv'n  A baron's title and a baron's power  Such were my foothing thoughts while I bewail'd  The slaughter'd father of a son unborn  And when that son came like a ray from heav'n  Which shines and disappears alas my child  How long did thy fond mother grasp the hope  Of having thee she knew not how restor'd  Year after year hath worn her hope away  But left still undiminish'd her desire  ANNA  The hand that spins th' uneven thread of life  May smooth the length that's yet to come of your's  Lady RANDOLPH  Not in this world I have consider'd well  Its various evils and on whom they fall  Alas how oft does goodness wound itself  And sweet affection prove the spring of woe  O had I died when my lov'd husband fell  Had some good angel op'd to me the book  Of providence and let me read my life  My heart had broke when I beheld the sum  Of ills which one by one I have endur'd  ANNA  That God whose ministers good angels are  Hath shut the book in mercy to mankind  But we must leave this theme GLENALVON comes  I saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes  And hitherwards he slowly stalks his way  Lady RANDOLPH  I will avoid him An ungracious person  Is doubly irksome in an hour like this  ANNA  Why speaks my lady thus of RANDOLPH's heir  Lady RANDOLPH  Because he's not the heir of RANDOLPH's virtues  Subtle and shrewd he offers to mankind  An artificial image of himself  And he with ease can vary to the taste  Of different men it's features Selfdenied  And master of his appetites he seems  But his fierce nature like a fox chain'd up  Watches to seize unseen the wish'dfor prey  Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill  As in GLENALVON's unrelenting mind  Yet is he brave and politic in war  And stands aloft in these unruly times  Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter  Stay and detain him till I reach the castle  Exit  Lady RANDOLPH  ANNA  O happiness where art thou to be found  I see thou dwellest not with birth and beauty  Tho' grac'd with grandeur and in wealth array'd  Nor dost thou it would seem with virtue dwell  Else had this gentle lady miss'd thee not  Enter  GLENALVON  GLENALVON  What dost thou muse on meditating maid  Like some entranc'd and visionary seer  On earth thou stand'st thy thoughts ascend to heaven  ANNA  Wou'd that I were e'en as thou say'st a seer  To have my doubts by heav'nly vision clear'd  GLENALVON  What dost thou doubt of what hast thou to do  With subjects intricate Thy youth thy beauty  Cannot be questioned think of these good gifts  And then thy contemplations will be pleasing  ANNA  Let women view yon monument of woe  Then boast of beauty who so fair as she  But I must follow this revolving day  Awakes the memory of her ancient woes  Exit  ANNA  GLENALVON  solus  SoLady RANDOLPH shuns me by and by  I'll woo her as the lion wooes his brides  The deed's a doing now that makes me lord  Of these rich valleys and a chief of power  The season is most apt my sounding steps  Will not be heard amidst the din of arms  RANDOLPH has liv'd too long his better fate  Had the ascendant once and kept me down  When I had seiz'd the dame by chance he came  Rescu'd and had the lady for his labour  I 'scap'd unknown a slender consolation  Heaven is my witness that I do not love  To sow in peril and let others reap  The jocund harvest Yet I am not safe  By love or something like it stung inflam'd  Madly I blabb'd my passion to his wife  And she has threaten'd to acquaint him of it  The way of woman's will I do not know  But well I know the baron's wrath is deadly  I will not live in fear the man I dread  Is as a Dane to me ay and the man  Who stands betwixt me and my chief desire  No bar but he she has no kinsman near  No brother in his sister's quarrel bold  And for the righteous cause a stranger's cause  I know no chief that will defy GLENALVON  End of the  FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A Court  c  Enter servants and a stranger at one door and Lady  RANDOLPH  and  ANNA  at another  Lady RANDOLPH  WHAT means this clamour stranger speak secure  Hast thou been wrong'd have these rude men presum'd  To vex the weary traveller on his way  First SERVANT  By us no stranger ever suffer'd wrong  This man with outcry wild has call'd us forth  So sore afraid he cannot speak his fears  Enter Lord  RANDOLPH  and young man with their swords drawn and bloody  Lady RANDOLPH  Not vain the stranger's fears how fares my lord  Lord RANDOLPH  That it fares well thanks to this gallant youth  Whose valour sav'd me from a wretched death  As down the winding dale I walk'd alone  At the cross way four armed men attack'd me  Rovers I judge from the licentious camp  Who would have quickly laid Lord RANDOLPH low  Had not this brave and generous stranger come  Like my good angel in the hour of fate  And mocking danger made my foes his own  They turn'd upon him but his active arm  Struck to the ground from whence they rose no more  The fiercest two the others fled amain  And left him master of the bloody field  Speak Lady RANDOLPH upon Beauty's tongue  Dwell accents pleasing to the brave and bold  Speak noble dame and thank him for thy lord  Lady RANDOLPH  My lord I cannot speak what now I feel  My heart o'erflows with gratitude to heav'n  And to this noble youth who all unknown  To you and yours deliberated not  Nor paus'd at peril but humanely brave  Fought on your side against such fearful odds  Have you yet learn'd of him whom we should thank  Whom call the saviour of Lord RANDOLPH's life  Lord RANDOLPH  I ask'd that question and he answer'd not  But I must know who my deliverer is  to the Stranger  STRANGER  A low born man of parentage obscure  Who nought can boast but his desire to be  A soldier and to gain a name in arms  Lord RANDOLPH  Whoe'er thou art thy spirit is ennobled  By the great King of Kings thou art ordain'd  And stampt a hero by the sovereign hand  Of nature blush not flower of modesty  As well as valour to declare thy birth  STRANGER  My name is NORVAL on the Grampian hills  My father feeds his flocks a frugal swain  Whose constant cares were to encrease his store  And keep his only son myself at home  For I had heard of battles and I long'd  To follow to the field some warlike lord  And heaven soon granted what my sire denied  This moon which rose last night round as my shield  Had not yet fill'd her horns when by her light  A band of fierce barbarians from the hills  Rush'd like a torrent down upon the vale  Sweeping our flocks and herds The shepherds fled  For safety and for succour I alone  With bended bow and quiver full of arrows  Hover'd about the enemy and mark'd  The road he took then hasted to my friends  Whom with a troop of fifty chosen men  I met advancing The pursuit I led  Till we o'ertook the spoilencumber'd foe  We fought and conquer'd E're a sword was drawn  An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief  Who wore that day the arms which now I wear  Returning home in triumph I disdain'd  The shepherd's slothful life and having heard  That our good king had summon'd his bold peers  To lead their warriours to the Carron side  I left my father's house and took with me  A chosen servant to conduct my steps  Yon trembling coward who forsook his master  Journeying with this intent I past these towers  And heavendirected came this day to do  The happy deed that gilds my humble name  Lord RANDOLPH  He is as wise as brave Was ever tale  With such a gallant modesty rehears'd  My brave deliverer thou shalt enter now  A nobler list and in a monarch's sight  Contend with princes for the prize of fame  I will present thee to our Scottish king  Whose valiant spirit ever valour lov'd  Ha my MATILDA wherefore starts that tear  Lady RANDOLPH  I cannot say for various affections  And strangely mingled in my bosom swell  Yet each of them may well command a tear  I joy that thou art safe and admire  Him and his fortunes who hath wrought thy safety  Obscure and friendless he the army sought  Bent upon peril in the range of death  Resolv'd to hunt for fame and with his sword  To gain distinction which his birth denied  In this attempt unknown he might have perish'd  And gain'd with all his valour but oblivion  Now grac'd by thee his virtue serves no more  Beneath despair The soldier now of hope  He stands conspicuous fame and great renown  Are brought within the compass of his sword  On this my mind reflected whilst you spoke  And bless'd the wonderworking Lord of heaven  Lord RANDOLPH  Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts  My deeds shall follow where thou point'st the way  Next to myself and equal to GLENALVON  In honour and command shall NORVAL be  NORVAL  I know not how to thank you Rude I am  In speech and manners never till this hour  Stood I in such a presence yet my lord  There's something in my breast which makes me bold  To say that NORVAL ne'er will shame thy favour  Lady RANDOLPH  I will be sworn thou wilt not Thou shalt be  My knight and ever as thou didst today  With happy valour guard the life of RANDOLPH  Lord RANDOLPH  Well hast thou spoke Let me forbid reply  To  NORVAL  We are thy debtors still thy high desert  O'ertops our gratitude I must proceed  As was at first intended to the camp  Some of my train I see are speeding hither  Impatient doubtless of their lord's delay  Go with me NORVAL and thine eyes shall see  The chosen warriors of thy native land  Who languish for the fight and beat the air  With brandish'd swords  NORVAL  Let us begone my lord  Lord RANDOLPH  To Lady  RANDOLPH  About the time that the declining sun  Shall his broad orbit o'er yon hills suspend  Expect us to return This night once more  Within these walls I rest my tent I pitch  Tomorrow in the field Prepare the feast  Free is his heart who for his country fights  He in the eve of battle may resign  Himself to social pleasure sweetest then  When danger to a soldier's soul endears  The human joy that never may return  Exeunt  RANDOLPH  and  NORVAL  SCENE II  Lady RANDOLPH and ANNA  Lady RANDOLPH  His parting words have struck a fatal truth  O DOUGLAS DOUGLAS tender was the time  When we two parted ne'er to meet again  How many years of anguish and despair  Has heav'n annex'd to those swift passing hours  Of love and fondness Then my bosom's flame  Oft as blown back by the rude breath of fear  Return'd and with redoubled ardour blaz'd  ANNA  May gracious heav'n pour the sweet balm of peace  Into the wounds that fester in your breast  For earthly consolation cannot cure them  Lady RANDOLPH  One only cure can heav'n itself bestow  A gravethat bed in which the weary rest  Wretch that I am Alas why am I so  At every happy parent I repine  How blest the mother of yon gallant NORVAL  She for a living husband bore her pains  And heard him bless her when a man was born  She nurs'd her smiling infant on her breast  Tended the child and rear'd the pleasing boy  She with affection's triumph saw the youth  In grace and comeliness surpass his peers  Whilst I to a dead husband bore a son  And to the roaring waters gave my child  ANNA  Alas alas why will you thus resume  Your grief afresh I thought that gallant youth  Would for a while have won you from your woe  On him intent you gazed with a look  Much more delighted than your pensive eye  Has deign'd on other objects to bestow  Lady RANDOLPH  Delighted say'st thou Oh even there mine eye  Found fuel for my lifeconsuming sorrow  I thought that had the son of DOUGLAS liv'd  He might have been like this young gallant stranger  And pair'd with him in features and in shape  In all endowments as in years I deem  My boy with blooming NORVAL might have number'd  Whilst thus I mus'd a spark from fancy fell  On my sad heart and kindled up a fondness  For this young stranger wand'ring from his home  And like an orphan cast upon my care  I will protect thee said I to myself  With all my power and grace with all my favour  ANNA  Sure heav'n will bless so gen'rous a resolve  You must my noble dame exert your power  You must awake devices will be fram'd  And arrows pointed at the breast of NORVAL  Lady RANDOLPH  GLENALVON's false and crafty head will work  Against a rival in his kinsman's love  If I deter him not I only can  Bold as he is GLENALVON will beware  How he pulls down the fabric that I raise  I'll be the artist of young NORVAL's fortune  'Tis pleasing to admire most apt was I  To this affection in my better days  Though now I seem to you shrunk up retir'd  Within the narrow compass of my woe  Have you not sometimes seen an early flower  Open it's bud and spread it's silken leaves  To catch sweet airs and odours to bestow  Then by the keen blast nipt pull in it's leaves  And tho' still living die to scent and beauty  Emblem of me affliction like a storm  Hath kill'd the forward blossom of my heart  Enter  GLENALVON  GLENALVON  Where is my dearest kinsman noble RANDOLPH  Lady RANDOLPH  Have you not heard GLENALVON of the base  GLENALVON  I have and that the villains may not scape  With a strong band I have begirt the wood  If they lurk there alive they shall be taken  And torture force from them th' important secret  Whether some foe of RANDOLPH hir'd their swords  Or if  Lady RANDOLPH  That care becomes a kinsman's love  I have a counsel for GLENALVON's ear    Exit  ANNA  GLENALVON  To him your counsels always are commands  Lady RANDOLPH  I have not found so thou art known to me  GLENALVON  Known  Lady RANDOLPH  And most certain is my cause of knowledge  GLENALVON  What do you know By the most blessed cross  You much amaze me No created thing  Yourself except durst thus accost GLENALVON  Lady RANDOLPH  Is guilt so bold and dost thou make a merit  Of thy pretended meekness This to me  Who with a gentleness which duty blames  Have hitherto conceal'd what if divulg'd  Would make thee nothing or what's worse than that  An outcast beggar and unpitied too  For mortals shudder at a crime like thine  GLENALVON  Thy virtue awes me First of womankind  Permit me yet to say that the fond man  Whom love transports beyond strict virtue's bounds  If he is brought by love to misery  In fortune ruin'd as in mind forlorn  Unpitied cannot be Pity's the alms  Which on such beggars freely is bestow'd  For mortals know that love is still their lord  And o'er their vain resolves advances still  As fire when kindled by our shepherds moves  Thro' the dry heath before the fanning wind  Lady RANDOLPH  Reserve these accents for some other ear  To love's apology I listen not  Mark thou my words for it is meet thou should'st  His brave deliverer RANDOLPH here retains  Perhaps his presence may not please thee well  But at thy peril practise ought against him  Let not thy jealousy attempt to shake  And loosen the good root he has in RANDOLPH  Whose favourites I know thou hast supplanted  Thou look'st at me as if thou fain would'st pry  Into my heart 'Tis open as my speech  I give this early caution and put on  The curb before thy temper breaks away  The friendless stranger my protection claims  His friend I am and be not thou his foe  Exit  SCENE III  Manet  GLENALVON  Child that I was to start at my own shadow  And be the shallow fool of coward conscience  I am not what I have been what I should be  The darts of destiny have almost pierc'd  My marble heart Had I one grain of faith  In holy legends and religious tales  I should conclude there was an arm above  That fought against me and malignant turn'd  To catch my self the subtle snare I set  Why rape and murder are not simple means  Th' imperfect rape to RANDOLPH gave a spouse  And the intended murder introduc'd  A favourite to hide the sun from me  And worst of all a rival Burning hell  This were thy center if I thought she lov'd him  'Tis certain she contemns me nay commands me  And waves the flag of her displeasure o'er me  In his behalf And shall I thus be brav'd  Curb'd as she calls it by dame chastity  Infernal fiends if any fiends there are  More fierce than love ambition and revenge  Rise up and fill my bosom with your fires  And policy remorseless Chance may spoil  A single aim but perseverance must  Prosper at last For chance and fate are words  Persistive wisdom is the fate of man  Darkly a project peers upon my mind  Like the red moon when rising in the east  Cross'd and divided by strangecolour'd clouds  I'll seek the slave who came with NORVAL hither  And for his cowardice was spurned from him  I've known a follower's rankled bosom breed  Venom most fatal to his heedless lord  Exit  End of the  SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A Court  c  as before  Enter  ANNA  ANNA  THY vassals Grief great nature's order break  And change the noontide to the midnight hour  Whilst Lady RANDOLPH sleeps I will walk forth  And taste the air that breathes on yonder bank  Sweet may her slumbers be Ye ministers  Of gracious heaven who love the human race  Angels and seraphs who delight in goodness  Forsake your skies and to her couch descend  There from her fancy chase those dismal forms  That haunt her waking her sad spirit charm  With images celestial such as please  The blest above upon their golden beds  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  One of the vile assassins is secur'd  We found the villain lurking in the wood  With dreadful imprecations he denies  All knowledge of the crime But this is not  His first essay these jewels were conceal'd  In the most secret places of his garment  Belike the spoils of some that he has murder'd  ANNA  Let me look on them Ha here is a heart  The chosen crest of DOUGLAS' valiant name  These are no vulgar jewels Guard the wretch  Exit  ANNA  Enter servants with a Prisoner  PRISONER  I know no more than does the child unborn  Of what you charge me with  First SERVANT  You say so sir  But torture soon shall make you speak the truth  Behold the Lady of Lord RANDOLPH comes  Prepare yourself to meet her just revenge  SCENE II  Enter  Lady RANDOLPH  and  ANNA  ANNA  Summon your utmost fortitude before  You speak with him Your dignity your fame  Are now at stake Think of the fatal secret  Which in a moment from your lips may fly  Lady RANDOLPH  Thou shalt behold me with a desperate heart  Hear how my infant perish'd See he kneels  The prisoner kneels  PRISONER  Heav'n bless that countenance so sweet and mild  A judge like thee makes innocence more bold  O save me lady from these cruel men  Who have attack'd and seiz'd me who accuse  Me of intended murder As I hope  For mercy at the judgment seat of God  The tender lamb that never nipt the grass  Is not more innocent than I of murder  Lady RANDOLPH  Of this man's guilt what proof can ye produce  First SERVANT  We found him lurking in the hollow Glynn  When view'd and call'd upon amaz'd he fled  We overtook him and enquir'd from whence  And what he was he said he came from far  And was upon his journey to the camp  Not satisfied with this we search'd his cloaths  And found these jewels whose rich value plead  Most powerfully against him Hard he seems  And old in villainy Permit us try  His stubborness against the torture's force  PRISONER  O gentle lady by your lord's dear life  Which these weak hands I swear did ne'er assail  And by your children's welfare spare my age  Let not the iron tear my ancient joints  And my grey hairs bring to the grave with pain  Lady RANDOLPH  Account for these thine own they cannot be  For these I say be stedfast to the truth  Detected falsehood is most certain death  ANNA  removes the servants and returns    PRISONER  Alas I'm fore beset let never man  For sake of lucre sin against his soul  Eternal justice is in this most just  I guiltless now must former guilt reveal  Lady RANDOLPH  O ANNA hearonce more I charge thee speak  The truth direct for these to me foretell  And certify a part of thy narration  With which if the remainder tallies not  An instant and a dreadful death abides thee  PRISONER  Then thus adjur'd I'll speak to you as just  As if you were the minister of heaven  Sent down to search the secret sins of men  Some eighteen years ago I rented land  Of brave Sir MALCOLM then BALARMO's lord  But falling to decay his servants seiz'd  All that I had and then turn'd me and mine  Four helpless infants and their weeping mother  Out to the mercy of the winter winds  A little hovel by the river's side  Receiv'd us there hard labour and the skill  In fishing which was formerly my sport  Supported life Whilst thus we poorly liv'd  One stormy night as I remember well  The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof  Red came the river down and loud and oft  The angry spirit of the water shrick'd  At the dead hour of night was heard the cry  Of one in jeopardy I rose and ran  To where the circling eddy of a pool  Beneath the ford us'd oft to bring within  My reach whatever floating thing the stream  Had caught The voice was ceas'd the person lost  But looking sad and earnest on the waters  By the moon's light I saw whirl'd round and round  A basket soon I drew it to the bank  And nestled curious there an infant lay  Lady RANDOLPH  Was he alive  PRISONER  He was  Lady RANDOLPH  Inhuman that thou art  How couldst thou kill what waves and tempests spar'd  PRISONER  I am not so inhuman  Lady RANDOLPH  Didst thou not  ANNA  My noble mistress you are mov'd too much  This man has not the aspect of stern murder  Let him go on and you I hope will hear  Good tidings of your kinsman's long lost child  PRISONER  The needy man who has known better days  One whom distress has spited at the world  Is he whom tempting fiends would pitch upon  To do such deeds as makes the prosperous men  Lift up their hands and wonder who could do them  And such a man was I a man declin'd  Who saw no end of black adversity  Yet for the wealth of kingdoms I would not  Have touch'd that infant with a hand of harm  Lady RANDOLPH  Ha dost thou say so Then perhaps he lives  PRISONER  Not many days ago he was alive  Lady RANDOLPH  O God of heav'n Did he then die so lately  PRISONER  I did not say he died I hope he lives  Not many days ago these eyes beheld  Him flourishing in youth and health and beauty  Lady RANDOLPH  Where is he now  PRISONER  Alas I know not where  Lady RANDOLPH  Oh fate I fear thee still Thou riddler speak  Direct and clear else I will search thy soul  ANNA  Permit me ever honour'd Keen impatience  Tho' hard to be restrain'd defeats itself  Pursue thy story with a faithful tongue  To the last hour that thou didst keep the child  PRISONER  Fear not my faith tho' I must speak my shame  Within the cradle where the infant lay  Was stow'd a mighty store of gold and jewels  Tempted by which we did resolve to hide  From all the world this wonderful event  And like a peasant breed the noble child  That none might mark the change of our estate  We left the country travell'd to the north  Bought flocks and herds and gradually brought forth  Our secret wealth But God's allseeing eye  Beheld our avarice and smote us sore  For one by one all our own children died  And he the stranger sole remain'd the heir  Of what indeed was his Fain then would I  Who with a father's fondness lov'd the boy  Have trusted him now in the dawn of youth  With his own secret but my anxious wife  Foreboding evil never would consent  Mean while the stripling grew in years and beauty  And as we oft observ'd he bore himself  Not as the offspring of our cottage blood  For nature will break out mild with the mild  But with the froward he was fierce as fire  And night and day he talk'd of war and arms  I set myself against his warlike bent  But all in vain for when a desperate band  Of robbers from the savage mountains came  Lady RANDOLPH  Eternal providence What is thy name  PRISONER  My name is NORVAL and my name he bears  Lady RANDOLPH  'Tis he 'tis he himself It is my son  O sovereign mercy 'Twas my child I saw  No wonder ANNA that my bosom burn'd  ANNA  Just are your transports ne'er was woman's heart  Prov'd with such fierce extremes High fated dame  But yet remember that you are beheld  By servile eyes your gestures may be seen  Impassion'd strange perhaps your words o'erheard  Lady RANDOLPH  Well dost thou counsel ANNA Heaven bestow  On me that wisdom which my state requires  ANNA  The moments of deliberation pass  And soon you must resolve This useful man  Must be dismiss'd in safety e'er my lord  Shall with his brave deliverer return  PRISONER  If I amidst astonishment and fear  Have of your words and gestures rightly judg'd  Thou art the daughter of my ancient master  The child I rescu'd from the flood is thine  Lady RANDOLPH  With thee dissimulation now were vain  I am indeed the daughter of Sir MALCOLM  The child thou rescu'dst from the flood is mine  PRISONER  Blest be the hour that made me a poor man  My poverty hath sav'd my master's house  Lady RANDOLPH  Thy words surprize me sure thou dost not feign  The tear stands in thine eye such love from thee  Sir MALCOLM's house deserv'd not if aright  Thou told'st the story of thy own distress  PRISONER  Sir MALCOLM of our barons was the flower  The fastest friend the best and kindest master  But ah he knew not of my sad estate  After that battle where his gallant son  Your own brave brother fell the good old lord  Grew desperate and reckless of the world  And never as he erst was wont went forth  To overlook the conduct of his servants  By them I was thrust out and them I blame  May heaven so judge me as I judg'd my master  And God so love me as I love his race  Lady RANDOLPH  His race shall yet reward thee On thy faith  Depends the fate of thy lov'd master's house  Rememb'rest thou a little lonely hut  That like a holy hermitage appears  Among the clifts of Carron  PRISONER  I remember  The cottage of the clifts  Lady RANDOLPH  'Tis that I mean  There dwells a man of venerable age  Who in my father's service spent his youth  Tell him I sent thee and with him remain  'Till I shall call upon thee to declare  Before the king and nobles what thou now  To me hast told No more but this and thou  Shalt live in honour all thy future days  Thy son so long shall call thee father still  And all the land shall bless the man who sav'd  The son of DOUGLAS and Sir MALCOLM'S heir  Remember well my words if thou shouldst meet  Him whom thou call'st thy son still call him so  And mention nothing of his nobler father  PRISONER  Fear not that I shall mar so fair an harvest  By putting in my sickle 'ere 'tis ripe  Why did I leave my home and ancient dame  To find the youth to tell him all I knew  And make him wear these jewels in his arms  Which might I thought be challeng'd and so bring  To light the secret of his noble birth  Lady  RANDOLPH  goes towards the Servants  Lady RANDOLPH  This man is not th'assassin you suspected  Tho' chance combin'd some likelyhoods against him  He is the faithful bearer of the jewels  To their right owner whom in haste he seeks  'Tis meet that you should put him on his way  Since your mistaken zeal hath dragg'd him hither  Exeunt Stranger and Servants▪  SCENE III  Lady  RANDOLPH  and  ANNA  Lady RANDOLPH  My faithful ANNA dost thou share my joy  I know thou dost Unparalell'd event  Reaching from heaven to earth Jehovah's arm  Snatch'd from the waves and brings to me my son  Judge of the widow and the orphan's father  Accept a widow's and a mother's thanks  For such a gift What does my ANNA think  Of the young eaglet of a valiant nest  How soon he gaz'd on bright and burning arms  Spurn'd the low dunghill where his fate had thrown him  And tower'd up to the region of his sire  ANNA  How fondly did your eyes devour the boy  Mysterious nature with the unseen cord  Of powerful instinct drew you to your own  Lady RANDOLPH  The ready story of his birth believ'd  Supprest my fancy quite nor did he owe  To any likeness my so sudden favour  But now I long to see his face again  Examine every feature and find out  The lineaments of DOUGLAS or my own  But most of all I long to let him know  Who his true parents are to clasp his neck  And tell him all the story of his father  ANNA  With wary caution you must bear yourself  In public lest your tenderness break forth  And in observers stir conjectures strange  For if a cherub in the shape of woman  Should walk this world yet defamation would  Like a vile cur bark at the angel's train  Today the baron started at your tears  Lady RANDOLPH  He did so ANNA well thy mistress knows  If the least circumstance mote of offence  Should touch the baron's eye his sight would be  With jealousy disorder'd But the more  It does behove me instant to declare  The birth of DOUGLAS and assert his rights  This night I purpose with my son to meet  Reveal the secret and consult with him  For wise he is or my fond judgment errs  As he does now so look'd his noble father  Array'd in nature's ease his mien his speech  Were sweetly simple and full oft deceiv'd  Those trivial mortals who seem always wise  But when the matter match'd his mighty mind  Uprose the Hero on his piercing eye  Sat Observation on each glance of thought  Decision follow'd as the thunderbolt  Pursues the flash  ANNA  That demon haunts you still  Behold GLENALVON  Lady RANDOLPH  Now I shun him not  This day I brav'd him in behalf of NORVAL  Perhaps too far at least my nicer fears  For DOUGLAS thus interpret  Enter  GLENALVON  GLENALVON  Noble dame  The hov'ring Dane at last his men hath landed  No band of pirates but a mighty host  That come to settle where their valour conquers  To win a country or to lose themselves  Lady RANDOLPH  But whence comes this intelligence GLENALVON  GLENALVON  A nimble courier sent from yonder camp  To hasten up the chieftains of the north  Inform'd me as he past that the fierce Dane  Had on the eastern coast of Lothian landed  Near to that place where the searock immense  Amazing Bass looks o'er a fertile land  Lady RANDOLPH  Then must this western army march to join  The warlike troops that guard Edena's tow'rs  GLENALVON  Beyond all question If impairing time  Has not effac'd the image of a place  Once perfect in my breast there is a wild  Which lyes to westward of that mighty rock  And seems by nature formed for the camp  Of waterwafted armies whose chief strength  Lies in firm foot unflank'd with warlike horse  If martial skill directs the Danish lords  There inaccessible their army lies  To our swift scow'ring horse the bloody field  Must man to man and foot to foot be fought  Lady RANDOLPH  How many mothers shall bewail their sons  How many widows weep their husbands slain  Ye dames of Denmark ev'n for you I feel  Who sadly sitting on the seabeat shore  Long look for lords that never shall return  GLENALVON  Oft has th'unconquer'd Caledonian sword  Widow'd the north The children of the slain  Come as I hope to meet their fathers' fate  The monster war with her infernal brood  Loud yelling fury and lifeending pain  Are objects suited to GLENALVON's soul  Scorn is more grievous than the pains of death  Reproach more piercing than the pointed sword  Lady RANDOLPH  I scorn thee not but when I ought to scorn  Nor e'er reproach but when insulted virtue  Against audacious vice asserts herself  I own thy worth GLENALVON none more apt  Than I to praise thine eminence in arms  And be the echo of thy martial fame  No longer vainly feed a guilty passion  Go and pursue a lawful mistress glory  Upon the Danish crests redeem thy fault  And let thy valour be the shield of RANDOLPH  GLENALVON  One instant stay and hear an alter'd man  When beauty pleads for virtue vice abash'd  Flies it's own colours and goes o'er to virtue  I am your convert time will shew how truely  Yet one immediate proof I mean to give  That youth for whom your ardent zeal today  Somewhat too haughtily defy'd your slave  Amidst the shock of armies I'll defend  And turn death from him with a guardian arm  Sedate by use my bosom maddens not  At the tumultuous uproar of the field  Lady RANDOLPH  Act thus GLENALVON and I am thy friend  But that's thy least reward Believe me sir  The truly generous is the truely wise  And he who loves not others lives unblest  Exit Lady  RANDOLPH  GLENALVON  solus  Amen and virtue is it's own reward  I think that I have hit the very tone  In which she loves to speak Honey'd assent  How pleasing art thou to the taste of man  And woman also flattery direct  Rarely disgusts They little know mankind  Who doubt it's operation 'tis my key  And opes the wicket of the human heart  How far I have succeeded now I know not  Yet I incline to think her stormy virtue  Is lull'd awhile 'tis her alone I fear  Whilst she and RANDOLPH live and live in faith  And amity uncertain is my tenure  Fate o'er my head suspends disgrace and death  By that weak hair a peevish female's will  I am not idle but the ebbs and flows  Of fortune's tide cannot be calculated  That slave of NORVAL's I have found most apt  I shew'd him gold and he has pawn'd his soul  To say and swear whatever I suggest  NORVAL I'm told has that alluring look  'Twixt man and woman which I have observ'd  To charm the nicer and fantastick dames  Who are like lady RANDOLPH full of virtue  In raising RANDOLPH's jealousy I may  But point him to the truth He seldom errs  Who thinks the worst he can of womankind  The End of the  THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  Flourish of Trumpets  Enter  Lord RANDOLPH  attended  Lord RANDOLPH  SUmmon an hundred horse by break of day  To wait our pleasure at the castle gate  Enter  Lady RANDOLPH  Lady RANDOLPH  Alas my lord I've heard unwelcome News  The Danes are landed  Lord RANDOLPH  Ay no inroad this  Of the Northumbrian bent to take a spoil  No sportive war no tournament essay  Of some young knight resolv'd to break a spear  And stain with hostile blood his maiden arms  The Danes are landed we must beat them back  Or live the slaves of Denmark  Lady RANDOLPH  Dreadful times  Lord RANDOLPH  The fenceless villages are all forsaken  The trembling mothers and their children lodg'd  In wellgirt towers and castles whilst the men  Retire indignant Yet like broken waves  They but retire more awful to return  Lady RANDOLPH  Immense as fame reports the Danish host  Lord RANDOLPH  Were it as numerous as loud fame reports  An army knit like ours wou'd pierce it thro'  Brothers that shrink not from each others side  And fond companions fill our warlike files  For his dear offspring and the wife he loves  The husband and the fearless father arm  In vulgar breasts heroic ardor burns  And the poor peasant mates his daring lord  Lady RANDOLPH  Men's minds are temper'd like their swords for war  Lovers of danger on destruction's brink  They joy to rear erect their daring forms  Hence early graves hence the lone widow's life  And the sad mother's griefembitter'd age  Where is our gallant guest  Lord RANDOLPH  Down in the vale  I left him managing a fiery steed  Whose stubbornness had foil'd the strength and skill  Of every rider But behold he comes  In earnest conversation with GLENALVON  Enter  NORVAL  and  GLENALVON  GLENALVON with the lark arise go forth  And lead my troops that ly in yonder vale  Private I travel to the royal camp  NORVAL thou goest with me But say young man  Where didst thou learn so to discourse of war  And in such terms as I o'erheard to day  War is no village science nor it's phrase  A language taught amongst the shepherd swains  NORVAL  Small is the skill my lord delights to praise  In him he favours Hear from whence it came  Beneath a mountain's brow the most remote  And inaccessible by shepherds trod  In a deep cave dug by no mortal hand  A hermit liv'd a melancholy man  Who was the wonder of our wand'ring swains  Austere and lonely cruel to himself  Did they report him the cold earth his bed  Water his drink his food the shepherd's alms  I went to see him and my heart was touch'd  With reverence and pity Mild he spake  And entring on discourse such stories told  As made me oft revisit his sad cell  For he had been a soldier in his youth  And fought in famous battles when the peers  Of Europe by the bold GODFREDO led  Against th' usurping Infidel display'd  The cross of Christ and won the Holy Land  Pleas'd with my admiration and the fire  His speech struck from me the old man wou'd shake  His years away and act his young encounters  Then having shew'd his wounds he'd sit him down  And all the livelong day discourse of war  To help my fancy in the smooth green turf  He cut the figures of the marshall'd hosts  Describ'd the motions and explain'd the use  Of the deep column and the lengthen'd line  The square the crescent and the phalanx firm  For all that Saracen or Christian knew  Of war's vast art was to this hermit known  Lord RANDOLPH  Why did this soldier in a desart hide  Those qualities that shou'd have grac'd a camp  NORVAL  That too at last I learn'd Unhappy man  Returning homewards by Messina's port  Loaded with wealth and honours bravely won  A rude and boist'rous captain of the sea  Fasten'd a quarrel on him Fierce they fought  The stranger fell and with his dying breath  Declar'd his name and lineage Mighty God  The soldier cried my brother Oh my brother  Lady RANDOLPH  His brother  NORVAL  Yes of the same parents born  His only brother They exchang'd forgiveness  And happy in my mind was he that died  For many deaths has the survivor suffer'd  In the wild desart on a rock he sits  Or on some nameless stream's untrodden banks  And ruminates all day his dreadful fate  At times alas not in his perfect mind  Holds dialogues with his lov'd brother's ghost  And oft each night forsakes his sullen couch  To make sad orisons for him he slew  Lady RANDOLPH  To what mysterious woes are mortals born  In this dire tragedy were there no more  Unhappy persons did the parents live  NORVAL  No they were dead kind heav'n had clos'd their eyes  Before their son had shed his brother's blood  Lord RANDOLPH  Hard is his fate for he was not to blame  There is a destiny in this strange world  Which oft decrees an undeserved doom  Let schoolmen tell us whyFrom whence these sounds  Trumpets at a distance  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  My Lord the trumpets of the troops of Lorn  Their valiant leader hails the noble RANDOLPH  Lord RANDOLPH  Mine ancient guest does he the warriors lead  Has Denmark rous'd the brave old knight to arms  OFFICER  No worn with warfare he resigns the sword  His eldest hope the vallant John of Lorn  Now leads his kindred bands  Lord RANDOLPH  GLENALVON go  With hospitality's most strong request  Entreat the chief    Exit  GLENALVON  OFFICER  My lord requests are vain  He urges on impatient of delay  Stung with the tidings of the foe's approach  Lord RANDOLPH  May victory sit on the warriour's plume  Bravest of men his flocks and herds are safe  Remote from wars alarms his pastures lye  By mountains inaccessible secur'd  Yet foremost he into the plain descends  Eager to bleed in battles not his own  Such were the heroes of the ancient world  Contemners they of indolence and gain  But still for love of glory and of arms  Prone to encounter peril and to lift  Against each strong antagonist the spear  I'll go and press the hero to my breast    Exit  RANDOLPH  Manet  Lady RANDOLPH  and  NORVAL  Lady RANDOLPH  The soldier's loftiness the pride and pomp  Investing awful war NORVAL I see  Transport thy youthful mind  NORVAL  Ah should they not  Blest be the hour I left my father's house  I might have been a shepherd all my days  And stole obscurely to a peasant's grave  Now if I live with mighty chiefs I stand  And if I fall with noble dust I lye  Lady RANDOLPH  There is a gen'rous spirit in thy breast  That could have well sustain'd a prouder fortune  This way with me under yon spreading beech  Unseen unheard by human eye or ear  I will amaze thee with a wond'rous tale  NORVAL  Let there be danger lady with the secret  That I may hug it to my grateful heart  And prove my faith Command my sword my life  These are the sole possessions of poor NORVAL  Lady RANDOLPH  Know'st thou these gems  NORVAL  Durst I believe mine eyes  I'd say I knew them and they were my father's  Lady RANDOLPH  Thy father's say'st thou ah they were thy father's  NORVAL  I saw them once and curiously enquir'd  Of both my parents whence such splendor came  But I was check'd and more could never learn  Lady RANDOLPH  Then learn of me thou art not NORVAL's son  NORVAL  Not NORVAL's son  Lady RANDOLPH  Nor of a shepherd sprung  NORVAL  Lady who am I then  Lady RANDOLPH  Noble thou art  For noble was thy sire  NORVAL  I will believe  O tell me farther Say who was my father  Lady RANDOLPH  DOUGLAS  NORVAL  Lord DOUGLAS whom to day I saw  Lady RANDOLPH  His younger brother  NORVAL  And in yonder camp  Lady RANDOLPH  Alas  NORVAL  You make me tremble Sighs and tears  Lives my brave father  Lady RANDOLPH  Ah too brave indeed  He fell in battle e're thyself was born  NORVAL  Ah me unhappy e're I saw the light  But does my mother live I may conclude  From my own fate her portion has been sorrow  Lady RANDOLPH  She lives but wastes her life in constant woe  Weeping her husband slain her infant lost  NORVAL  You that are skill'd so well in the sad story  Of my unhappy parents and with tears  Bewail their destiny now have compassion  Upon the offspring of the friends you lov'd  O tell me who and where my mother is  Opprest by a base world perhaps she bends  Beneath the weight of other ills than grief  And desolate implores of heav'n the aid  Her son should give It is it must be so  Your countenance confesses that she's wretched  O tell me her condition Can the sword  Who shall resist me in a parent's cause  Lady RANDOLPH  Thy virtue ends her woe My son my son  I am thy mother and the wife of DOUGLAS  Falls upon his neck  NORVAL  O heav'n and earth how wond'rous is my fate  Art thou my mother Ever let me kneel  Lady RANDOLPH  Image of DOUGLAS Fruit of fatal love  All that I owe thy sire I pay to thee  NORVAL  Respect and admiration still possess me  Checking the love and fondness of a son  Yet I was filial to my humble parents  But did my sire surpass the rest of men  As thou excellest all of womankind  Lady RANDOLPH  Arise my son In me thou dost behold  The poor remains of beauty once admir'd  The autumn of my days is come already  For sorrow made my summer haste away  Yet in my prime I equal'd not thy father  His eyes were like the eagle's yet sometimes  Liker the dove's and as he pleas'd he won  All hearts with softness or with spirit aw'd  NORVAL  How did he fall Sure 'twas a bloody field  When DOUGLAS died O I have much to ask  Lady RANDOLPH  Hereafter thou shalt hear the lengthen'd tale  Of all thy father's and thy mother's woes  At present this Thou art the rightful heir  Of yonder castle and the wide domains  Which now Lord RANDOLPH as my husband holds  But thou shalt not be wrong'd I have the power  To right thee still Before the king I'll kneel  And call Lord DOUGLAS to protect his blood  NORVAL  The blood of DOUGLAS will protect itself  Lady RANDOLPH  But we shall need both friends and favour boy  To wrest thy lands and lordship from the gripe  Of RANDOLPH and his kinsman Yet I think  My tale will move each gentle heart to pity  My life incline the virtuous to believe  NORVAL  To be the son of DOUGLAS is to me  Inheritance enough Declare my birth  And in the field I'll seek for same and fortune  Lady RANDOLPH  Thou dost not know what perils and injustice  Await the poor man's valour O my son  The noblest blood in all the land's abash'd  Having no lacquey but pale poverty  Too long hast thou been thus attended DOUGLAS  Too long hast thou been deem'd a peasant's child  The wanton heir of some inglorious chief  Perhaps has scorn'd thee in the youthful sports  Whilst thy indignant spirit swell'd in vain  Such contumely thou no more shalt bear  But how I purpose to redress thy wrongs  Must be hereafter told Prudence directs  That we should part before yon chiefs return  Retire and from thy rustick follower's hand  Receive a billet which thy mother's care  Anxious to see thee dictated before  This casual opportunity arose  Of private conference It's purport mark  For as I there appoint we meet again  Leave me my son and frame thy manners still  To NORVAL's not to noble DOUGLAS' state  NORVAL  I will remember Where is NORVAL now  That good old man  Lady RANDOLPH  At hand conceal'd he lies  An useful witness But beware my son  Of yon GLENALVON in his guilty breast  Resides a villain's shrewdness ever prone  To false conjecture He hath griev'd my heart  NARVOL  Has he indeed Then let yon false GLENALVON  Beware of me  Exit  DOUGLAS  Manet  Lady RANDOLPH  There burst the smother'd flame  O thou all righteous and eternal King  Who father of the fatherless art call'd  Protect my son Thy inspiration Lord  Hath fill'd his bosom with that sacred fire  Which in the breasts of his forefathers burn'd  Set him on high like them that he may shine  The star and glory of his native land  Then let the minister of death descend  And bear my willing spirit to it's place  Yonder they come How do bad women find  Unchanging aspects to conceal their guilt  When I by reason and by justice urg'd  Full hardly can dissemble with these men  In nature's pious cause  Enter  Lord RANDOLPH  and  GLENALVON  Lord RANDOLPH  Yon gallant chief  Of arms enamour'd all repose disclaims  Lady RANDOLPH  Be not my Lord by his example sway'd  Arrange the business of tomorrow now  And when you enter speak of war no more  Exit  Lady RANDOLPH  Manent  Lord RANDOLPH  and  GLENALVON  Lord RANDOLPH  'Tis so by heav'n her mien her voice her eye  And her impatience to be gone confirm it  GLENALVON  He parted from her now Behind the mount  Amongst the trees I saw him glide along  Lord RANDOLPH  For sad sequester'd virtue she's renown'd  GLENALVON  Most true my Lord  Lord RANDOLPH  Yet this distinguish'd dame  Invites a youth the acquaintance of a day  Alone to meet her at the midnight hour  This assignation  shews a letter  the assassin freed  Her manifest affection for the youth  Might breed suspicion in a husband's brain  Whose gentle consort all for love had wedded  Much more in mine MATILDA never lov'd me  Let no man after me a woman wed  Whose heart he knows he has not tho' she brings  A mine of gold a kingdom for her dowry  For let her seem like the night's shadowy queen  Cold and contemplative He cannot trust her  She may she will bring shame and sorrow on him  The worst of sorrow and the worst of shames  GLENALVON  Yield not my Lord to such afflicting thoughts  But let the spirit of an husband sleep  'Till your own senses make a sure conclusion  This billet must to blooming NORVAL go  At the next turn awaits my trusty spy  I'll give it him refitted for his master  In the close thicket take your secret stand  The moon shines bright and your own eyes may judge  Of their behaviour  Lord RANDOLPH  Thou dost counsel well  GLENALVON  Permit me now to make one slight essay  Of all the trophies which vain mortal's boast  By wit by valour or by wisdom won  The first and fairest in a young mans eye  Is woman's captive heart Successful love  With glorious fumes intoxicates the mind  And the proud conqueror in triumph moves  Airborn exalted above vulgar men  Lord RANDOLPH  And what avails this maxim  GLENALVON  Much my lord  Withdraw a little I'll accost young NORVAL  And with ironical derisive counsel  Explore his spirit If he is no more  Than humble NORVAL by thy favour rais'd  Brave as he is he'll shrink astonish'd from me  But if he be the favourite of the fair  Lov'd by the first of Caledonia's dames  He'll turn upon me as the lion turns  Upon the hunter's spear  Lord RANDOLPH  'Tis shrewdly thought  GLENALVON  When we grow loud draw near But let my Lord  His rising wrath restrain  Exit  RANDOLPH  Manet  GLENALVON  'Tis strange by heav'n  That she should run full tilt her fond career  To one so little known She too that seem'd  Pure as the winter stream when ice emboss'd  Whitens it's course Even I did think her chaste  Whose charity exceeds not Precious sex  Whose deeds lascivious pass GLENALVON's thoughts  NORVAL  appears  His port I love he's in a proper mood  To chide the thunder if at him it roar'd  Has NORVAL seen the troops  NORVAL  The setting sun  With yellow radiance lighten'd all the vale  And as the warriours mov'd each polish'd helm  Corslet or spear glanc'd back his gilded beams  The hill they climb'd and halting at it's top  Of more than mortal size tow'ring they seem'd  An host angelic clad in burning arms  GLENALVON  Thou talk'st it well no leader of our host  In sounds more lofty speaks of glorious war  NORVAL  If I shall e'er acquire a leader's name  My speech will be less ardent Novelty  Now prompts my tongue and youthful admiration  Vents itself freely since no part is mine  Of praise pertaining to the great in arms  GLENALVON  You wrong yourself brave sir your martial deeds  Have rank'd you with the great but mark me NORVAL  Lord RANDOLPH's favour now exalts your youth  Above his veterans of famous service  Let me who know these soldiers counsel you  Give them all honour seem not to command  Else they will scarcely brook your late sprung power  Which nor alliance props nor birth adorns  NORVAL  Sir I have been accustom'd all my days  To hear and speak the plain and simple truth  And tho' I have been told that there are men  Who borrow friendship's tongue to speak their scorn  Yet in such language I am little skill'd  Therefore I thank GLENALVON for his counsel  Altho' it sounded harshly Why remind  Me of my birth obscure Why slur my power  With such contemptuous terms  GLENALVON  I did not mean  To gall your pride which now I see is great  NORVAL  My pride  GLENALVON  Suppress it as you wish to prosper  Your pride's excessive Yet for RANDOLPH's sake  I will not leave you to it's rash direction  If thus you swell and frown at highborn men  Will highborn men endure a shepherd's scorn  NORVAL  A shepherd's scorn  GLENALVON  Yes if you presume  To bend on soldiers these disdainful eyes  As if you took the measure of their minds  And said in secret you're no match for me  What will become of you  NORVAL  If this were told  Aside  Hast thou no fears for thy presumptuous self  GLENALVON  Ha Dost thou threaten me  NORVAL  Didst thou not hear  GLENALVON  Unwillingly I did a nobler foe  Had not been question'd thus But such as thee  NORVAL  Whom dost thou think me  GLENALVON  Norval  NORVAL  So I am  And who is NORVAL in GLENALVON's eyes  GLENALVON  A peasant's son a wandering beggarboy  At best no more even if he speaks the truth  NORVAL  False as thou art dost thou suspect my truth  GLENALVON  Thy truth thou'rt all a lye and false as hell  Is the vainglorious tale thou told'st to RANDOLPH  NORVAL  If I were chain'd unarm'd and bedrid old  Perhaps I should revile But as I am  I have no tongue to rail The humble NORVAL  Is of a race who strive not but with deeds  Did I not fear to freeze thy shallow valour  And make thee sink too soon beneath my sword  I'd tell theewhat thou art I know thee well  GLENALVON  Dost thou not know GLENALVON born to command  Ten thousand slaves like thee  NORVAL  Villain no more  Draw and defend thy life I did design  To have defy'd thee in another cause  But heaven accelerates it's vengeance on thee  Now for my own and Lady RANDOLPH's wrongs  Enter  Lord RANDOLPH  Lord RANDOLPH  Hold I command you both The man that stirs  Makes me his foe  NORVAL  Another voice than thine  That threat had vainly sounded noble RANDOLPH  GLENALVON  Hear him my lord he's wond'rous condescending  Mark the humility of shepherd NORVAL  NORVAL  Now you may scoff in safety  Sheaths his sword  Lord RANDOLPH  Speak not thus  Taunting each other but unfold to me  The cause of quarrel then I judge betwixt you  NORVAL  Nay my good lord tho' I revere you much  My cause I plead not nor demand your judgment  I blush to speak I will not cannot speak  Th' opprobrious words that I from him have borne  To the liegelord of my dear native land  I owe a subject's homage but ev'n him  And his high arbitration I'd reject  Within my bosom reigns another lord  Honour sole judge and umpire of itself  If my free speech offend you noble RANDOLPH  Revoke your favours and let NORVAL go  Hence as he came alone but not dishonour'd  Lord RANDOLPH  Thus far I'll mediate with impartial voice  The ancient foe of Caledonia's land  Now waves his banners o'er her frighted fields  Suspend your purpose 'till your country's arms  Repel the bold invader then decide  The private quarrel  GLENALVON  I agree to this  NORVAL  And I  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  The banquet waits  Lord RANDOLPH  We come  Exit  RANDOLPH  GLENALVON  Norval  Let not our variance mar the social hour  Nor wrong the hospitality of RANDOLPH  Nor frowning anger nor yet wrinkl'd hate  Shall stain my countenance Smooth thou thy brow  Nor let our strife disturb the gentle dame  NORVAL  Think not so lightly Sir of my resentment  When we contend again our strife is mortal  End of the  FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  The Wood  Enter  DOUGLAS  THIS is the place the centre of the grove  Here stands the oak the monarch of the wood  How sweet and solemn is this midnight scene  The silver moon unclouded holds her way  Thro' skies where I could count each little star  The fanning west wind scarcely stirs the leaves  The river rushing o'er its pebbled bed  Imposes silence with a stilly sound  In such a place as this at such an hour  If ancestry can be in ought believ'd  Descending spirits have convers'd with man  And told the secrets of the world unknown  Enter  Old NORVAL  Old NORVAL  'Tis he But what if he should chide me hence  His just reproach I fear  DOUGLAS  turns and sees him  Forgive forgive  Can'st thou forgive the man the selfish man  Who bred Sir MALCOLM's heir a shepherd's son  DOUGLAS  Kneel not to me thou art my father still  Thy wish'dfor presence now compleats my joy  Welcome to me my fortunes thou shalt share  And ever honour'd with thy DOUGLAS live  Old NORVAL  And do'st thou call me father O my son  I think that I could die to make amends  For the great wrong I did thee 'Twas my crime  Which in the wilderness so long conceal'd  The blossom of thy youth  DOUGLAS  Not worse the fruit  That in the wilderness the blossom blow'd  Amongst the shepherds in the humble cote  I learn'd some lessons which I'll not forget  When I inhabit yonder lofty towers  I who was once a swain will ever prove  The poor man's friend and when my vassals bow  NORVAL shall smooth the crested pride of DOUGLAS  NORVAL  Let me but live to see thine exaltation  Yet grievous are my fears O leave this place  And those unfriendly towers  DOUGLAS  Why should I leave them  NORVAL  Lord RANDOLPH and his kinsman seek your life  DOUGLAS  How know'st thou that  NORVAL  I will inform you how  When evening came I left the secret place  Appointed for me by your mother's care  And fondly trod in each accustom'd path  That to the castle leads Whilst thus I rang'd  I was alarm'd with unexpected sounds  Of earnest voices On the persons came  Unseen I lurk'd and overheard them name  Each other as they talk'd lord RANDOLPH this  And that GLENALVON still of you they spoke  And of the lady threatning was their speech  Tho' but imperfectly my ear could hear it  'Twas strange they said a wonderful discov'ry  And ever and anon they vow'd revenge  DOUGLAS  Revenge for what  NORVAL  For being what you are  Sir MALCOLM's heir how else have you offended  When they were gone I hied me to my cottage  And there sat musing how I best might find  Means to inform you of their wicked purpose  But I could think of none at last perplex'd  I issued forth encompassing the tower  With many a weary step and wishful look  Now providence hath brought you to my sight  Let not your too couragious spirit scorn  The caution which I give  DOUGLAS  I scorn it not  My mother warn'd me of GLENALVON's baseness  But I will not suspect the noble RANDOLPH  In our encounter with the vile assassins  In mark'd his brave demeanor him I'll trust  NORVAL  I fear you will too far  DOUGLAS  Here in this place  I wait my mother's coming she shall know  What thou hast told her counsel I will follow  And cautious ever are a mother's counsels  You must depart your presence may prevent  Our interview  NORVAL  My blessing rest upon thee  O may heav'n's hand which sav'd thee from the wave  And from the sword of foes be near thee still  Turning mischance if ought hangs o'er thy head  All upon mine  Exit Old  NORVAL  DOUGLAS  He loves me like a parent  And must not shall not lose the son he loves  Altho' his son has found a nobler father  Eventful day▪ how hast thou chang'd my state  Once on the cold and winter shaded side  Of a bleak hill mischance had rooted me  Never to thrive child of another soil  Transplanted now to the gay sunny vale  Like the green thorn of May my fortune flowers  Ye glorious stars high heav'n's resplendent host  To whom I oft have of my lot complain'd  Hear and record my soul's unalter'd wish  Dead or alive let me but be renown'd  May heav'n inspire some fierce gigantic Dane  To give a bold defiance to our host  Before he speaks it out I will accept  Like DOUGLAS conquer or like DOUGLAS die  Enter  Lady RANDOLPH  Lady RANDOLPH  My son I heard a voice  DOUGLAS  The voice was mine  Lady RANDOLPH  Didst thou complain aloud to nature's ear  That thus in dusky shades at midnight hours  By stealth the mother and the son should meet  Embracing him  DOUGLAS  No on this happy day this better birthday  My thoughts and words are all of hope and joy  Lady RANDOLPH  Sad fear and melancholy still divide  The empire of my breast with hope and joy  Now hear what I advise  DOUGLAS  First let me tell  What may the tenor of your counsel change  Lady RANDOLPH  My heart forebodes some evil  DOUGLAS  'Tis not good  At eve unseen by RANDOLPH and GLENALVON  The good old NORVAL in the grove o'er heard  Their conversation oft they mention'd me  With dreadful threatnings you they sometimes nam'd  'Twas strange they said a wonderful discov'ry  And ever and anon they vow'd revenge  Lady RANDOLPH  Defend us gracious God we are betray'd  They have found out the secret of thy birth  It must be so That is the great discovery  Sir MALCOLM's heir is come to claim his own  And they will be reveng'd Perhaps even now  Arm'd and prepar'd for murder they but wait  A darker and more silent hour to break  Into the chamber where they think thou sleep'st  This moment this heav'n hath ordain'd to save thee  Fly to the camp my son  DOUGLAS  And leave you here  No to the castle let us go together  Call up the ancient servants of your house  Who in their youth did eat your father's bread  Then tell them loudly that I am your son  If in the breasts of men one spark remains  Of sacred love fidelity or pity  Some in your cause will arm I ask but few  To drive those spoilers from my father's house  Lady RANDOLPH  O nature nature what can check thy force  Thou genuine offspring of the daring DOUGLAS  But rush not on destruction save thyself  And I am safe To me they mean no harm  Thy stay but risks thy precious life in vain  That winding path conducts thee to the river  Cross where thou seest a broad and beaten way  Which running eastward leads thee to the camp  Instant demand admittance to Lord DOUGLAS  Shew him these jewels which his brother wore  Thy look thy voice will make him feel the truth  Which I by certain proof will soon confirm  DOUGLAS  I yield me and obey but yet my heart  Bleeds at this parting Something bids me stay  And guard a mother's life Oft have I read  Of wond'rous deeds by one bold arm atchiev'd  Our foes are two no more let me go forth  And see if any shield can guard GLENALVON  Lady RANDOLPH  If thou regard'st thy mother or rever'st  Thy father's mem'ry think of this no more  One thing I have to say before we part  Long wert thou lost and thou art found my child  In a most fearful season War and battle  have great cause to dread Too well I see  Which way the current of thy temper sets  To day I've found thee Oh my long lost hope  If thou to giddy valour giv'st the rein  To morrow I may lose my son for ever  The love of thee before thou saw'st the light  Sustain'd my life when thy brave father fell  If thou shalt fall I have nor love nor hope  In this waste world my son remember me  DOUGLAS  What shall I say how can I give you comfort  The God of battles of my life dispose  As may be best for you for whose dear sake  I will not bear myself as I resolv'd  But yet consider as no vulgar name  That which I boast sounds amongst martial men  How will inglorious caution suit my claim  The post of fate unshrinking I maintain  My country's foes must witness who I am  On the invaders heads I'll prove my birth  'Till friends and foes confess the genuine strain  If in this strife I fall blame not your son  Who if he lives not honour'd must not live  Lady RANDOLPH  I will not utter what my bosom feels  Too well I love that valour which I warn  Farewell my son my counsels are but vain  Embracing  And as high heaven hath will'd it all must be  separate  Lady RANDOLPH  Gaze not on me thou wilt mistake the path  I'll point it out again    Just as they are separating enter from the wood Lord  RANDOLPH  and  GLENALVON  Lord RANDOLPH  Not in her presence  Now  GLENALVON  I'm prepar'd  Lord RANDOLPH  No I command thee stay  I go alone it never shall be said  That I took odds to combat mortal man  The noblest vengeance is the most compleat    Exit Lord  RANDOLPH  GLENALVON  makes some steps to the same side of the stage listens and speaks    GLENALVON  Demons of death come settle on my sword  And to a double slaughter guide it home  The lover and the husband both must die  Lord RANDOLPH  behind the scenes    Lord RANDOLPH  Draw Villain draw  DOUGLAS  Assail me not Lord RANDOLPH  Not as thou lov'st thy self  Clashing of swords  GLENALVON  running out    Now is the time  Enter  Lady RANDOLPH  at the opposite side of the stage faint and breathless  Lady RANDOLPH  Lord RANDOLPH hear me all shall be thine own  But spare Oh spare my son  Enter  DOUGLAS  with a sword in each hand  My mother's voice  I can protect thee still  Lady RANDOLPH  He lives he lives  For this for this to heaven eternal praise  But sure I saw thee fall  DOUGLAS  It was GLENALVON  Just as my arm had master'd RANDOLPH's sword  The villain came behind me but I flew him  Lady RANDOLPH  Behind thee Ah thou'rt wounded O my child  How pale thou look'st and shall I lose thee now  DOUGLAS  Do not despair I feel a little faintness  I hope it will not last  Leans upon his sword  Lady RANDOLPH  There is no hope  And we must part the hand of death is on thee  O my beloved child O DOUGLAS DOUGLAS  DOUGLAS  growing more and more faint    DOUGLAS  Too soon we part I have not long been DOUGLAS  O destiny hardly thou dealst with me  Clouded and hid a stranger to myself  In low and poor obscurity I liv'd  Lady RANDOLPH  Has heav'n preserv'd thee for an end like this  DOUGLAS  O had I fallen as my brave fathers fell  Turning with fatal arm the tide of battle  Like them I should have smil'd and welcom'd death  But thus to perish by a villain's hand  Cut off from nature's and from glory's course  Which never mortal was so fond to run  Lady RANDOLPH  Hear justice hear are these the fruits of virtue  DOUGLAS  falls    DOUGLAS  Unknown I die no tongue shall speak of me  Some noble spirits judging by themselves  May yet conjecture what I might have prov'd  And think life only wanting to my fame  But who shall comfort thee  Lady RANDOLPH  Despair despair  DOUGLAS  O had it pleas'd high heaven to let me live  A little while my eyes that gaze on thee  Grow dim apace my mother  Dies  Enter Lord  RANDOLPH  and  ANNA  Lord RANDOLPH  Thy words the words of truth have pierc'd my heart  I am the stain of knighthood and of arms  Oh if my brave deliverer survives  The traitor's sword  ANNA  Alas look there my lord  Lord RANDOLPH  The mother and her son How curst I am  Was I the cause No I was not the cause  Yon matchless villain did seduce my soul  To frantic jealousy  ANNA  My lady lives  The agony of grief hath but supprest  Awhile her powers  Lord RANDOLPH  But my deliverer's dead  The world did once esteem Lord RANDOLPH well  Sincere of heart for spotless honour fam'd  And in my early days glory I gain'd  Beneath the holy banner of the cross  Now past the noon of life shame comes upon me  Reproach and infamy and public hate  Are near at hand for all mankind will think  That RANDOLPH basely stab'd Sir MALCOLM's heir  Lady RANDOLPH  recovering  Lady RANDOLPH  Where am I now still in this wretched world  Grief cannot break a heart so hard as mine  My youth was worn in anguish but youth's strength  With hope's assistance bore the brunt of sorrow  And train'd me on to be the object now  On which omnipotence displays itself  Making a spectacle a tale of me  To awe it's vassal man  Lord RANDOLPH  O misery  Amidst thy raging grief I must proclaim  My innocence  Lady RANDOLPH  Thy innocence  Lord RANDOLPH  My guilt  Is innocence compared with what thou think'st it  Lady RANDOLPH  Of thee I think not what have I to do  With thee or any thing My son my son  My beautiful my brave how proud was I  Of thee and of thy valour My fond heart  O'erflow'd this day with transport when I thought  Of growing old amidst a race of thine  Who might make up to me their father's childhood  And bear my brother's and my husband's name  Now all my hopes are dead A little while  Was I a wife a mother not so long  What am I now I know But I shall be  That only whilst I please for such a son  And such a husband make a woman bold  Runs out  Lord RANDOLPH  Follow her ANNA I myself would follow  But in this rage she must abhor my presence  Exit  ANNA  Enter  Old NORVAL  NORVAL  I heard the voice of woe heaven guard my child  Lord RANDOLPH  Already is the idle gaping croud  The spiteful vulgar come to gaze on RANDOLPH  Begone  NORVAL  I fear thee not I will not go  Here I'll remain I'm an accomplice Lord  With thee in murder Yes my sins did help  To crush down to the ground this lovely plant  O noblest youth that ever yet was born  Sweetest and best gentlest and bravest spirit  That ever bless'd the world Wretch that I am  Who saw that noble spirit swell and rise  Above the narrow limits that confin'd it  Yet never was by all thy virtues won  To do thee justice and reveal the secret  Which timely known had rais'd thee far above  The villain's snare Oh I am punish'd now  These are the hairs that should have strew'd the ground  And not the locks of DOUGLAS  Tears his hair and throws himself upon the ground  Lord RANDOLPH  I know thee now thy boldness I forgive  My crest is fallen For thee I will appoint  A place of rest if grief will let thee rest  I will reward altho' I cannot punish  Curst curst GLENALVON he escap'd too well  Tho' slain and baffled by the hand he hated  Foaming with rage and fury to the last  Cursing his conqueror the felon dy'd  Enter  ANNA  ANNA  My Lord my Lord  Lord RANDOLPH  Speak I can hear of horror  ANNA  Horror indeed  Lord RANDOLPH  MATILDA  ANNA  Is no more  She ran she flew like light'ning up the hill  Nor halted till the precipice she gain'd  Beneath whose low'ring top the river falls  Ingulph'd in rifted rocks thither she came  As fearless as the eagle lights upon it  And headlong down  Lord RANDOLPH  'Twas I alas 'twas I  That fill'd her breast with fury drove her down  The precipice of death Wretch that I am  ANNA  O had you seen her last despairing look  Upon the brink she stood and cast her eyes  Down on the deep then lifting up her head  And her white hands to heaven seeming to say  Why am I forc'd to this She plung'd herself  Into the empty air  Lord RANDOLPH  I will not vent  In vain complaints the passion of my soul  Peace in this world I never can enjoy  These wounds the gratitude of RANDOLPH gave  They speak aloud and with the voice of fate  Denounce my doom I am resolv'd I'll go  Straight to the battle where the man that makes  Me turn aside must threaten worse than death  Thou faithful to thy mistress take this ring  Full warrant of my power Let every rite  With cost and pomp upon their funerals wait  For RANDOLPH hopes he never shall return  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mr BARRY  AN Epilogue I ask'd but not one word  Our bard will write He vows 'tis most absurd  With comick wit to contradict the strain  Of tragedy and make your sorrows vain  Sadly he says that pity is the best  And noblest passion of the human breast  For when its sacred streams the heart o'erflow  In gushes pleasure with the tide of woe  And when its waves retire like those of  Nile  They leave behind them such a golden soil  That there the virtues without culture grow  There the sweet blossoms of affection blow  These were his words void of delusive art  I felt them for he spoke them from his heart  Nor will I now attempt with witty folly  To chace away celestial melancholy
