 LETTERS OF THE LATE Rev Mr LAURENCE STERNE To his most intimate FRIENDS  Entered in the Hall Book of the Company of Stationers according to Act of Parliament  LYDIA STERNE DE MEDALLE  Painted by B  Engraved by J Caldwall  August    LETTERS OF THE LATE Rev Mr LAURENCE STERNE To his most intimate FRIENDS  WITH A FRAGMENT in the Manner of  Rabelais    To which are prefix'd Memoirs of his Life and Family Written by HIMSELF And Published by his Daughter Mrs MEDALLE  In THREE VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand  DEDICATION To DAVID GARRICK Esq  WHEN I was ask'd to whom I should dedicate these volumes I carelessly answered to no oneWhy not replied the person who put the question to me Because most dedications  look like begging a protection to the book Perhaps a worse interpretation may be given to it No no already so much obliged I cannot will not put another tax upon the generosity of any friend of Mr Sterne's or mine I went home to my lodgings and gratitude warmed my heart to such a pitch that I vow'd they should be dedicated to the man my father so much admiredwho with an unprejudiced eye read and approved  his works and moreover loved the man'Tis to Mr Garrick then that I dedicate these Genuine Letters  Can I forget the sweet  See Page  Epitaph which proved Mr Garrick's friendship and opinion of him 'Twas a tribute to friendshipand as a tribute of my gratitude I dedicate these volumes to a man of understanding and  feelingsReceive this as it is meantMay you dear Sir approve of these letters as much as Mr Sterne admired youbut Mr Garrick with all his urbanity can never carry the point half so far for Mr Sterne was an enthusiast if it is possible to be one in favour of Mr Garrick  This may appear a very simple dedication but Mr Garrick will judge by his own sensibility  that I can feel more than I can express and I believe he will give me credit for all my grateful acknowledgements  I am with every sentiment of gratitude and esteem  Dear Sir  Your obliged humble servant  Lydia Sterne de Medalle    London  June  EPITAPH  SHALL Pride a heap of sculptur'd marble raise  Some worthless unmourn'd titled fool to praise  And shall we not by one poor gravestone learn  Where Genius Wit and Humour sleep with  Sterne  D G  PREFACE  IN publishing these Letters the Editor does but comply with her mother's request which was that if any letters were publish'd under Mr Sterne's name that those she had in her possession as well as those that her father's friends would be kind enough to send to her should be likewise publish'dShe depends much  on the candour of the public for the favourable reception of thesetheir being genuine she thinksand hopes will render them not unacceptableShe has already experienced much benevolence and generosity from her late father's friendsthe rememberance of it will ever warm her heart with gratitude  In Memory of Mr STERNE author of THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY  WITH wit and genuine humour to dispel  From the desponding bosom gloomy care  And bid the gushing tear at the sad tale  Of hapless love or filial grief to flow  From the full sympathising heart were thine  These powers Oh Sterne but now thy fate demands  No plumage nodding o'er the emblazon'd hearse  Proclaiming honor where no virtue shone  But the sad tribute of a heartfelt sigh  What tho' no taper cast its deadly ray  Nor the full choir sing requiems o'er thy tomb  The humbler grief of friendship is not mute  And poor Maria with her faithful kid  Her auburn tresses carelessly entwin'd  With olive foliage at the close of day  Shall chaunt her plaintive vespers at thy grave  Thy shade too gentle Monk mid aweful night  Shall pour libations from its friendly eye  For 'erst his sweet benevolence bestow'd  Its generous pity and bedew'd with tears  The sod which rested on thy aged breast  A Character and Eulogium of STERNE and his Writings in a familiar Epistle from a Gentleman in Ireland to his FriendWritten in the Year  WHAT trifle comes nextSpare the censure my friend  This letter's no more from beginning to end  Yet when you consider your laughter pray stifle  The advantage the importance the use of a trifle  When you think too besideand there's nothing more clear  That pence compose millions and moments the year  You surely will grant me nor think that I jest  That life's but a series of trifles at best  How wildly digressive yet could I O STERNE  The late reverend  Laurence Sterne  A M c author of that truly original humourous heteroclite work called The Life and Opinions of  Tristram Shandy  of A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy which alas he did not live to finish and of some volumes of Sermons Of his skill in delineating and supporting his characters those of the father of his hero of his uncle  Toby  and of corporal  Trim  out of numberless others afford ample proof To his power in the pathetic whoever shall read the stories of  Le Fevre Maria the Monk  and  the dead Ass  must if he has feelings bear sufficient testimony And his  Sermons  throughout though sometimes perhaps chargeable with a levity not entirely becoming the pulpit breathe the kindest spirit of  Philanthropy  of  good will towards man  For the few exceptional parts of his works those small blemishes  Quas aut incuria fudit  Aut humana parum cavit natura  suffer them kind critic to rest with his ashes  The above eulogium will I doubt not appear to you and perhaps also to many others much too high for the literary character of STERNE I have not at present either leisure or inclination to enter into argument upon the question but in truth I considered myself as largely his debtor for the tears and the laughter he so frequently excited and was desirous to leave behind me for so long at least as this trifle shall remain some small memorial of my gratitude I will even add that although I regard the memory of  Shakespeare  with a veneration little short of idolatry I esteem the  Monk's hornbox  a relick  "as devoutly to be wished"  as a pipestopper a walkingstick or even an inkstand of the  mulberrytree      Digress with thy skill with thy freedom return  The vain wish I repressPoor YORICK no more  Shall thy mirth and thy jests "set the table on a roar"  No more thy sad tale with simplicity told  O'er each feeling breast its strong influence hold  From the wise and the brave call forth sympathy's sigh  Or swell with sweet anguish humanity's eye  Here and there in the page if a blemish appear  And what page or what life from a blemish is clear  TRIM and TOBY with soft intercession attend  LE FEVRE intreats you to pardon his friend  MARIA too pleads for her favourite distress'd  As you feel for her sorrows O grant her request  Should these advocates fail I've another to call  One tear of his MONK shall obliterate all  Favour'd pupil of Nature and Fancy of yore  Whom from Humour's embrace sweet Philanthropy bore  While the Graces and Loves scatter flow'rs on thy urn  And Wit weeps the blossom too hastily torn  This meed too kind spirit unoffended receive  From a youth next to SHAKESPEARE's who honours thy grave  MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE AND FAMILY OF THE LATE Rev Mr LAURENCE STERNE  ROGER STERNE grandson to Archbishop Sterne Lieutenant in Hand aside's regiment was married to Agnes Hebert widow of a captain of a good family her family name was  I believe Nuttlethough upon recollection that was the name of her fatherinlaw who was a noted sutler in Flanders in Queen Ann's wars where my father married his wife's daughter N B he was in debt to him which was in September Old StileThis Nuttle had a son by my grandmothera fine person of a man but a graceless whelpwhat became of him I know notThe family if any left live now at Clomwel in the south of Ireland  at which town I was born November th a few days after my mother arrived from DunkirkMy birthday was ominous to my poor father who was the day after our arrival with many other brave officers broke and sent adrift into the wide world with a wife and two childrenthe elder of which was Mary she was born in Lisle in French Flanders July the tenth one thousand seven hundred and twelve New StileThis child was most unfortunateshe  married one Weemans in Dublinwho used her most unmercifullyspent his substance became a bankrupt and left my poor sister to shift for herselfwhich she was able to do but for a few months for she went to a friend's house in the country and died of a broken heart She was a most beautiful womanof a fine figure and deserved a better fateThe regiment in which my father served being broke he left Ireland as soon as I was able to  be carried with the rest of his family and came to the family seat at Elvington near York where his mother lived She was daughter to Sir Roger Jaques and an heiress There we sojourned for about ten months when the regiment was established and our houshold decamped with bag and baggage for Dublinwithin a month of our arrival my father left us being ordered to Exeter where in a sad winter my mother and her two children followed him travelling from  Liverpool by land to Plymouth Melancholy description of this journey not necessary to be transmitted here In twelve months we were all sent back to DublinMy mother with three of us for she laid in at Plymouth of a boy Joram took ship at Bristol for Ireland and had a narrow escape from being cast away by a leak springing up in the vesselAt length after many perils and struggles we got to DublinThere my father took a large house furnished it and in a  year and a half's time spent a great deal of moneyIn the year one thousand seven hundred and nineteen all unhing'd again the regiment was ordered with many others to the Isle of Wight in order to embark for Spain in the Vigo expedition We accompanied the regiment and was driven into Milford Haven but landed at Bristol from thence by land to Plymouth again and to the Isle of Wightwhere I remember we stayed encamped some time before  the embarkation of the troopsin this expedition from Bristol to Hampshire we lost poor Jorama pretty boy four years old of the smallpox my mother sister and myself remained at the Isle of Wight during the Vigo Expedition and until the regiment had got back to Wicklow in Ireland from whence my father sent for usWe had poor Joram's loss supplied during our stay in the Isle of Wight by the birth of a girl Anne born September the  twentythird one thousand seven hundred and nineteenThis pretty blossom fell at the age of three years in the Barracks of Dublinshe was as I well remember of a fine delicate frame not made to last long as were most of my father's babesWe embarked for Dublin and had all been cast away by a most violent storm but through the intercessions of my mother the captain was prevailed upon to turn back into Wales where we stayed a month and at length  got into Dublin and travelled by land to Wicklow where my father had for some Weeks given us over for lostWe lived in the barracks at Wicklow one year one thousand seven hundred and twenty when Devijeher so called after Colonel Devijeher was born from thence we decamped to stay half a year with Mr Fetherston a clergyman about seven miles from Wicklow who being a relation of my mother's invited us to his parsonage at AnimoIt was  in this parish during our stay that I had that wonderful escape in falling through a millrace whilst the mill was going and of being taken up unhurtthe story is incredible but known for truth in all that part of Irelandwhere hundreds of the common people flocked to see meFrom hence we followed the regiment to Dublin where we lay in the barracks a yearIn this year one thousand seven hundred and twentyone I learned to write cThe regiment  ordered in twentytwo to Carrickfergus in the north of Ireland we all decamped but got no further than Drogheda thence ordered to Mullengar forty miles west where by Providence we stumbled upon a kind relation a collateral descendant from Archbishop Sterne who took us all to his castle and kindly entreated us for a yearand sent us to the regiment at Carrickfergus loaded with kindnesses ca most rueful and tedious journey had we all in  March to Carrickfergus where we arrived in six or seven dayslittle Devijeher here died he was three years oldHe had been left behind at nurse at a farmhouse near Wicklow but was fetch'd to us by my father the summer afteranother child sent to fill his place Susan this babe too left us behind in this weary journeyThe autumn of that year or the spring afterwards I forget which my father got leave of his colonel to fix me at schoolwhich he did near Halifax  with an able master with whom I staid some time 'till by God's care of me my cousin Sterne of Elvington became a father to me and sent me to the university c c To pursue the thread of our story my father's regiment was the year after ordered to Londonderry where another sister was brought forth Catherine still living but most unhappily estranged from me by my uncle's wickedness and her own follyfrom this station the regiment was sent to defend Gibraltar  at the seige where my father was run through the body by Captain Phillips in a duel the quarrel begun about a goose with much difficulty he survivedtho' with an impaired constitution which was not able to withstand the hardships it was put tofor he was sent to Jamaica where he soon fell by the country fever which took away his senses first and made a child of him and then in a month or two walking about continually without complaining till the  moment he sat down in an arm chair and breathed his lastwhich was at Port Antonio on the north of the islandMy father was a little smart manactive to the last degree in all exercisesmost patient of fatigue and disappointments of which it pleased God to give him full measurehe was in his temper somewhat rapid and hastybut of a kindly sweet disposition void of all design and so innocent in his own intentions that he suspected no one so that  you might have cheated him ten times in a day if nine had not been sufficient for your purposemy poor father died in March I remained at Halifax 'till about the latter end of that year and cannot omit mentioning this anecdote of myself and schoolmasterHe had had the cieling of the schoolroom new whitewashedthe ladder remained thereI one unlucky day mounted it and wrote with a brush in large capital letters LAU STERNE for which the  usher severely whipped me My master was very much hurt at this and said before me that never should that name be effaced for I was a boy of genius and he was sure I should come to prefermentthis expression made me forget the stripes I had receivedIn the year thirtytwo my cousin sent me to the university where I staid some time 'Twas there that I commenced a friendship with Mr H which has been most lasting on both sidesI then came to York  and my uncle got me the living of Suttonand at York I become acquainted with your mother and courted her for two yearsshe owned she liked me but thought herself not rich enough or me too poor to be joined togethershe went to her sister's in S and I wrote to her oftenI believe then she was partly determined to have me but would not say soat her return she fell into a consumptionand one evening that I was sitting by her with an almost  broken heart to see her so ill she said  "my dear Lawrey I can never be yours for I verily believe I have not long to livebut I have left you every shilling of my fortune"  upon that she shewed me her willthis generosity overpowered meIt pleased God that she recovered and I married her in the year My uncle and myself were then upon very good terms for he soon got me the Prebendary of Yorkbut he quarrelled with me afterwards because I would  not write paragraphs in the newspapersthough he was a partyman I was not and detested such dirty work thinking it beneath mefrom that period he became my bitterest enemyBy my wife's means I got the living of Stillingtona friend of her's in the south had promised her that if she married a clergyman in Yorkshire when the living became vacant he would make her a compliment of it I remained near twenty years at Sutton doing duty at both places  I had then very good healthBooks painting fiddling and shooting were my amusements as to the 'Squire of the parish I cannot say we were upon a very friendly footingbut at Stillington the family of the Cs shewed us every kindness'twas most truly agreeable to be within a mile and a half of an amiable family who were ever cordial friendsIn the year I took a house at York for your mother and yourself and went up to London to publish my two first  volumes of Shandy In that year Lord F presented me with the curacy of Coxwolda sweet retirement in comparison of Sutton In sixtytwo I went to France before the peace was concluded and you both followed meI left you both in France and in two years after I went to Italy for the recovery of my healthand when I called upon you I tried to engage your mother to return to England with meshe and yourself are at length comeand I have had the inexpressible  joy of seeing my girl every thing I wished her  I have set down these particulars relating to my family and self for my Lydia in case hereafter she might have a curiosity or a kinder motive to know them  IN justice to Mr Sterne's delicate feelings I must here publish the following letters to Mrs Sterne before he married her when she was in StaffordshireA good heart breathes in every line of them  LETTERS  LETTER I To Miss L  YES I will steal from the world and not a babbling tongue shall tell where I amEcho shall not so much as whisper my hiding placesuffer thy imagination to paint it as a little sungilt cottage on the side of a romantic hilldost thou think I will  leave love and friendship behind me No they shall be my companions in solitude for they will sit down and rise up with me in the amiable form of my Lwe will be as merry and as innocent as our first parents in Paradise before the arch fiend entered that undescribable scene  The kindest affections will have room to shoot and expand in our retirement and produce such fruit as madness and envy and ambition have always killed in the budLet the human tempest and hurricane rage at a distance the desolation is beyond the horizon of peaceMy L has  seen a Polyanthus blow in Decembersome friendly wall has sheltered it from the biting windNo planetary influence shall reach us but that which presides and cherishes the sweetest flowersGod preserve us how delightful this prospect in idea We will build and we will plant in our own waysimplicity shall not be tortured by artwe will learn of nature how to liveshe shall be our alchymist to mingle all the good of life into one salubrious draughtThe gloomy family of care and distrust shall be banished from our dwelling guarded by thy kind and tutelar deitywe will sing our choral songs of  gratitude and rejoice to the end of our pilgrimage  Adieu my L Return to one who languishes for thy society  L STERNE  LETTER II To the same  YOU bid me tell you my dear L how I bore your departure for S and whether the valley where D'Estella stands retains still its looksor if I think the roses or jessamines smell as sweet as when you left itAlas every thing has now lost its relish and look The hour you left D'Estella I took to my bedI was worn out with fevers of all kinds but most by that fever of the heart with which thou knowest well I have been wasting  these two yearsand shall continue wasting 'till you quit S The good Miss S from the forebodings of the best of hearts thinking I was ill insisted upon my going to herWhat can be the cause my dear L that I never have been able to see the face of this mutual friend but I feel myself rent to pieces She made me stay an hour with her and in that short space I burst into tears a dozen different timesand in such affectionate gusts of passion that she was constrained to leave the room and sympathize in her dressing roomI have been weeping for you both said she in a tone of the sweetest pityfor  poor L's heart I have long known ither anguish is as sharp as yoursher heart as tenderher constancy as greather virtues as heroicHeaven brought you not together to be tormented I could only answer her with a kind look and a heavy sighand return'd home to your lodgings which I have hired 'till your return to resign myself to miseryFanny had prepared me a suppershe is all attention to mebut I sat over it with tears a bitter sauce my L but I could eat it with no otherfor the moment she began to spread my little table my heart fainted within meOne solitary plate one knife one  fork one glassI gave a thousand pensive penetrating looks at the chair thou hadst so often graced in those quiet and sentimental repaststhen laid down my knife and fork and took out my handkerchief and clapped it across my face and wept like a childI do so this very moment my L for as I take up my pen my poor pulse quickens my pale face glows and tears are trickling down upon the paper as I trace the word L O thou blessed in thyself and in thy virtuesblessed to all that know theeto me most so because more do I know of thee than all thy sexThis is the philtre my L by which thou  hast charmed me and by which thou wilt hold me thine whilst virtue and faith hold this world togetherThis my friend is the plain and simple magick by which I told Miss I have won a place in that heart of thine on which I depend so satisfied that time or distance or change of every thing which might alarm the hearts of little men create no uneasy suspence in mineWast thou to stay in S these seven years thy friend though he would grieve scorns to doubt or to be doubted'tis the only exception where security is not the parent of dangerI told you poor Fanny was all attention to me since  your departurecontrives every day bringing in the name of L She told me last night upon giving me some hartshorn she had observed my illness began the very day of your departure for S that I had never held up my head had seldom or scarce ever smiled had fled from all societythat she verily believed I was brokenhearted for she had never entered the room or passed by the door but she heard me sigh heavilythat I neither eat or slept or took pleasure in any thing as beforejudge then my L can the valley look so wellor the roses and jessamines smell so sweet as heretofore  Ah meBut adieuthe vesper bell calls me from thee to my God  L STERNE  LETTER III To the same  BEFORE now my L has lodged an indictment against me in the high court of FriendshipI plead guilty to the charge and intirely submit to the mercy of that amiable tribunalLet this mitigate my punishment if it will not expiate my transgressiondo not say that I shall offend again in the same manner though a too easy pardon sometimes occasions a repetition of the same faultA miser says though I do no good with my money  today tomorrow shall be marked with some deed of beneficenceThe Libertine says let me enjoy this week in forbidden and luxurious pleasures and the next I will dedicate to serious thought and reflectionThe Gamester says let me have one more chance with the dice and I will never touch them moreThe Knave of every profession wishes to obtain but independency and he will become an honest manThe Female Coquette triumphs in tormenting her inamorato for fear after marriage he should not pity her  Thy apparition of the fifth instant for letters may almost be called so proved more welcome as I did not expect it Oh my L thou art kind indeed to make an apology for me and thou never wilt assuredly repent of one act of kindnessfor being thy debtor I will pay thee with interestWhy does my L complain of the desertion of friendsWhere does the human being live that will not join in this complaintIt is a common observation and perhaps too true that married people seldom extend their regards beyond their own firesideThere is such a thing as parsimony in esteem as well as money  yet as the one costs nothing it might be bestowed with more liberalityWe cannot gather grapes from thorns so we must not expect kind attachments from persons who are wholly folded up in selfish schemesI do not know whether I most despise or pity such charactersnature never made an unkind creatureill usage and bad habits have deformed a fair and lovely creation  My Lthou art surrounded by all the melancholy gloom of winter wert thou alone the retirement would be agreeableDisappointed ambition might envy such a retreat and disappointed  love would seek it outCrouded towns and busy societies may delight the unthinking and the gaybut solitude is the best nurse of wisdomMethinks I see my contemplative girl now in the garden watching the gradual approaches of springDo'st not thou mark with delight the first vernal buds the snowdrop and primrose these early and welcome visitors spring beneath thy feetFlora and Pomona already consider thee as their handmaid and in a little time will load thee with their sweetest blessingThe feathered race are all thy own and with them untaught harmony will soon begin to  cheer thy morning and evening walksSweet as this may be returnreturnthe birds of Yorkshire will tune their pipes and sing as melodiously as those of Staffordshire  Adieu my beloved L thine too much for my  peace    L STERNE  LETTER IV To the same  I HAVE offended her whom I so tenderly lovewhat could tempt me to it but if a beggar was to knock at thy gate wouldst thou not open the door and be melted with compassionI know thou wouldst for Pity has erected a temple in thy bosomSweetest and best of all human passions let thy web of tenderness cover the pensive form of affliction and soften the darkest shades of misery I have reconsidered this apology and alas  what will it accomplish Arguments however finely spun can never change the nature of thingsvery trueso a truce with them  I have lost a very valuable friend by a sad accident and what is worse he has left a widow and five young children to lament this sudden strokeIf real usefulness and integrity of heart could have secured him from this his friends would not now be mourning his untimely fateThese dark and seemingly cruel dispensations of Providence often make the best of human hearts complainWho can paint the distress of an affectionate mother  made a widow in a moment weeping in bitterness over a numerous helpless and fatherless offspringGod these are thy chastisements and require hard task a pious acquiescence  Forgive me this digression and allow me to drop a tear over a departed friend and what is more excellent an honest man My L thou wilt feel all that kindness can inspire in the death ofThe event was sudden and thy gentle spirit would be more alarmed on that accountBut my L thou hast less to lament as old age was creeping on and her period of doing good and being useful was  nearly overAt sixty years of age the tenement gets fast out of repair and the lodger with anxiety thinks of a dischargeIn such a situation the poet might well say  "The soul uneasy c"  My L talks of leaving the countrymay a kind angel guide thy steps hitherSolitude at length grows tiresomeThou sayest thou wilt quit the place with regretI think so tooDoes not something uneasy mingle with the very reflection of leaving it It is like parting with an old friend whose temper and company one has long been acquainted withI think  I see you looking twenty times a day at the housealmost counting every brick and pane of glass and telling them at the same time with a sigh you are going to leave themOh happy modification of matter they will remain insensible of thy lossBut how wilt thou be able to part with thy gardenThe recollection of so many pleasing walks must have endeared it to you The trees the shrubs the flowers which thou reared with thy own handswill they not droop and fade away sooner upon thy departureWho will be the successor to nurse them in thy absenceThou wilt leave thy name upon the myrtletreeIf  trees and shrubs and flowers could compose an elegy I should expect a very plaintive one upon this subject  Adieu adieu Believe me ever ever thine  L STERNE  LETTER V To S C Esq  London  Christmas Day  My Dear Friend  I HAVE been in such a continual hurry since the moment I arrived herewhat with my books and what with visiters and visitings that it was not in my power sooner to sit down and acknowledge the favour of your obliging letter and to thank you for the most friendly motives which led you to write it I am not much in pain upon what gives my kind friends at Stillington so much  on the chapter of  Noses  because as the principal satire throughout that part is levelled at those learned blockheads who in all ages have wasted their time and much learning upon points as foolishit shifts off the idea of what you fear to another pointand 'tis thought here very good'twill pass musterI mean not with allnono I shall be attacked and pelted either from cellars or garrets write what I willand besides must expect to have a party against me of many hundredswho either do notor will not laugh'Tis enough if I divide the worldat least I will rest contented with itI wish you was  here to see what changes of looks and political reasoning have taken place in every company and coffeehouse since last year we shall be soon Prussians and AntiPrussians B's and AntiBs and those distinctions will just do as well as Whig and Toryand for aught I know serve the same endsThe K seems resolved to bring all things back to their original principles and to stop the torrent of corruption and lazinessHe rises every morning at six to do businessrides out at eight to a minute returns at nine to give himself up to his peopleBy persisting 'tis thought he will oblige  his Ms and dependants to dispatch affairs with him many hours sooner than of lateand 'tis much to be question'd whether they will not be enabled to wait upon him sooner by being free'd from long levees of their own and applications which will in all likelyhood be transferr'd from them directly to himselfthe present system being to remove that Phalanx of great people which stood betwixt the throne and the subjects and suffer them to have immediate access without the intervention of a caballthis is the language of others however the K gives every thing himself knows every thing and weighs every thing maturely  and then is inflexiblethis puts old stagers off their gamehow it will end we are all in the dark  'Tis fear'd the war is quite over in Germany never was known such havock amongst troopsI was told yesterday by a Colonel from Germany that out of two battalions of nine hundred men to which he belong'd but seventyone leftP F has sent word 'tis said that he must have fortythousand men directly sent to take the fieldand with provisions for them too for he can but subsist them for a fortnightI hope this will find you all got to YorkI  beg my compliments to the amiable Mrs Croft c c  Tho' I purposed going first to GoldenSquare yet fate has thus long disposed of meso I have never been able to set a foot towards that quarter  I am dear Sir Your's affectionately L STERNE  LETTER VI To the same  My dear Sir  I HAVE just time to acknowledge the favour of yours but not to get the two prints you mentionwhich shall be sent you by next postI have bought them and lent them to Miss Gilbert but will assuredly send for them and enclose them to youI will take care to get your pictures well copied and at a moderate price And if I can be of further use I beseech you to employ  me and from time to time will send you an account of whatever may be worth transmittingThe stream now sets in strong against the German war Loud complaints of making a trade of the war c c much expected from Ld G's evidence to these matters who is expected every hourthe K wins every day upon the people shews himself much at the play but at no opera rides out with his brothers every morning half an hour after seven till ninereturns with themspends an hour with them at breakfast and chatand then sits  down to business I never dined at home once since I arrivedam fourteen dinners deep engaged just now and fear matters will be worse with me in that point than betterAs to the main points in view at which you hintall I can say is that I see my way and unless Old Nick throws the diceshall in due time come off winnerTristram will be out the twentieththere is a great rout made about him before he enters the stagewhether this will be of use or no I can't saysome wits of the first magnitude here both as to wit and station engage me successtime will shew  Adieu dear Sir and with my compliments to Mrs Croft c  I am your affectionate and obliged L STERNE  LETTER VII To the same  Dear Sir  I THIS moment received the favour of your kind letterThe letter in the Ladies Magazine about me was wrote by the noted Dr H who wrote the Inspector and undertakes that magazinethe people of York are very uncharitable to suppose any man so gross a beast as to pen such a character of himselfIn this great town no soul ever suspected it for a thousand  reasonscould they suppose I should be such a fool as to fall foul upon Dr Wn my best friend by representing him so weak a manor by telling such a lye of himas his giving me a purse to buy off his tutorship for Tristramor I should be fool enough to own I had taken his purse for that purpose  You must know there is a quarrel between Dr H and Dr My who was the physician meant at Mr C S's and Dr H has changed the place on purpose to give My a lickNow that conversation tho' perhaps true yet happen'd  at another place and with another physician which I have contradicted in this city for the honour of my friend My all which shews the absurdity of York credulity and nonsense Besides the account is full of falshoodsfirst with regard to the place of my birth which was at C in Irelandthe story of a hundred pounds to Mrs W not true or of a  pension promised  the merit of which I disclaim'dand indeed there are so many other things so untrue and unlikely to come from me that the worst enemy I have here never had a suspicionand to end all Dr H owns the paper  I shall be down before May is outI preach before the Judges on Sundaymy sermons come out on Thursday afterand I purpose the Monday at furthest after that to set out for YorkI have bought a pair of horses for that purposemy best respects to your Lady  I am Dear Sir Your most obliged and faithful L STERNE  PS I beg pardon for this hasty scrawl having just come from a Concert where the D of Y perform'dI have received great notice from him and last week had the honour of supping with him  LETTER VIII To the same  Dear Sir  SINCE I had the favour of your obliging letter nothing has happened or been said one day which has not been contradicted the next so having little certain to write I have forbore writing at all in hopes every day of something worth filling up a letter We had the greatest expectations yesterday that ever were  raised of a pitched battle in the H of C wherein Mr P was to have entered and thrown down the gauntlet in defence of the German warThere never was so full a housethe gallery full to the topI was there all the daywhen lo a political fit of the gout seized the great combattanthe entered not the listsB got up and begged the house as he saw not his right honourable friend there to put off the debateit could not be done so B rose up and made a most long passionate incoherent speech in defence of the Germanick warbut very severe upon the unfrugal manner it was carried  onin which he addressed himself principally to the C of the E and laid him on terriblyIt seems the chancery of Hanover had laid out pounds on account and brought in our treasury debtorand the grand debate was for an honest examination of the particulars of this extravagant account and for vouchers to authenticate itL answered B very rationally and coollyLord N spoke longSir F D maintained the German war was most perniciousMr C of Surry spoke well against the account with some othersL Bn at last got up and spoke half an hour  with great plainness and temperexplained a great many hidden springs relating to these accounts in favour of the late Kand told two or three conversations which had passed between the K and himself relative to these expenceswhich cast great honour upon the K's character This was with regard to the money the K had secretly furnished out of his pocket to lessen the account of the Hanoverscore brought us to discharge  Bd and Bn abused all who sought for peace and joined in the cry for it and Bd added that the reasons of wishing a peace  now were the same as at the peace of Utretchthat the people behind the curtain could not both maintain the war and their places too so were for making another sacrifice of the nation to their own interestsAfter allthe cry for a peace is so general that it will certainly end in one Now for myself  One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly as the other half cry it up to the skiesthe best is they abuse and buy it and at such a rate that we are going on with a second edition as fast as possible  I am going down for a day or two with Mr Spencer to Wimbleton on Wednesday there is to be a grand assembly at Lady N I have enquired every where about Stephen's affair and can hear nothingMy friend Mr Charles T will be now secretary of warhe bid me wish him joy of it though not in possessionI will ask himand depend my most worthy friend that you shall not be ignorant of what I learn from himbelieve me ever ever  Yours L S  LETTER IX To the same  My dear Sir  A STRAIN which I got in my wrist by a terrible fall prevented my acknowledging the favour of your obliging letter I went yesterday morning to breakfast with Mr V who is a kind of righthand man to the secretary on purpose to enquire about the propriety or feasibility of doing what you wish meand he has  told me an anecdote which had you been here would I think have made it wiser to have deferred speaking about the affair a month hence than now it is thisYou must know that the numbers of officers who have left their regiments in Germany for the pleasures of the town have been a long topic for merriment as you see them in St James's Coffeehouse and the park every hour enquiring open mouth how things go on in Germany and what newswhen they should have been there to have furnished news themselvesbut the worst part has been that many of them have left their brother officers on their  duty and in all the fatigues of it and have come with no end but to make friends to be put unfairly over the  heads of those  who were left risking  their lives  In this attempt there have been some but too successful which has justly raised illblood and complaints from the officers who staid behindthe upshot has been that they have every soul been ordered off and woe be to him 'tis said who shall be found listening Now just to mention our friend's case whilst this cry is on foot I think would be doing more hurt than good but if you think otherwise I will go with all my heart and mention it to Mr  T for to do more I am too inconsiderable a person to pretend to You made me and my friends here very merry with the accounts current at York of my being forbid the courtbut they do not consider what a considerable person they make of me when they suppose either my going or my not going there is a point that ever enters the K's headand for those about him I have the honour either to stand so personally well known to them or to be so well represented by those of the first rank as to fear no accident of that kind  I thank God B's excepted I have never yet made a friend or connection I have forfeited or done ought to forfeitbut on the contrary my true character is better understood and where I had one friend last year who did me honour I have three nowIf my enemies knew that by this rage of abuse and ill will they were effectually serving the interests both of myself and works they would be more quietbut it has been the fate of my betters who have found that the way to fame is like the way to heaventhrough much tribulationand till I shall have the honour to be  as much maltreated as Rabelais and Swift were I must continue humble for I have not filled up the measure of half their  persecutions    The court is

To Mrs F  York  Tuesday Nov  Dear Madam  YOUR kind enquiries after my health deserve my best thanksWhat can give one more pleasure than the good wishes of those we valueI am sorry you give so bad an account of your own health but hope you will find benefit from tarwaterit has been of infinite service to meI suppose my good lady by  what you say in your letter  "that I am busy writing an extraordinary book"  that your intelligence comes from Yorkthe fountainhead of chitchat newsandno matterNow for your desire of knowing the reason of my turning author why truly I am tired of employing my brains for other people's advantage'Tis a foolish sacrifice I have made for some years to an ungrateful personI depend much upon the candour of the publick but I shall not pick out a jury to try the merit of my book amongst ******* andtill you read my Tristram do not like some people condemn itLaugh I am  sure you will at some passagesI have hired a small house in the Minster Yard for my wife and daughterthe latter is to begin dancing c if I cannot leave her a fortune I will at least give her an educationAs I shall publish my works very soon I shall be in town by March and shall have the pleasure of meeting with youAll your friends are well and ever hold you in the same estimation that your sincere friend does  Adieu dear lady believe me with every wish for your happiness your most faithful c  LAURENCE STERNE  LETTER XII To Dr ******  Jan  Dear Sir    DE mortuis nil nisi bonum  is a maxim which you have so often of late urged in conversation and in your letters but in your last especially with such seriousness and severity against me as the supposed transgressor of the rulethat you have made me at length as serious and severe as yourselfbut that the humours you have stirred up might not work too  potently within me I have waited four days to cool myself before I would set pen to paper to answer you  "  de mortuis nil nisi bonum  "  I declare I have considered the wisdom and foundation of it over and over again as dispassionately and charitably as a good Christian can and after all I can find nothing in it or make more of it than a nonsensical lullaby of some nurse put into Latin by some pedant to be chanted by some hypocrite to the end of the world for the consolation of departing lechers'Tis I own Latin and I think that is all the weight it hasfor in plain English 'tis a loose and futile position  below a dispute  "  you are not to speak any thing of the dead but what is good  "  Why soWho says soneither reason or scriptureInspired authors have done otherwiseand reason and common sense tell me that if the characters of past ages and men are to be drawn at all they are to be drawn like themselves that is with their excellencies and with their foiblesand it is as much a piece of justice to the world and to virtue too to do the one as the otherThe ruleing passion  et les egarements du coeur  are the very things which mark and distinguish a man's characterin which I would as soon leave out a  man's head as his hobbyhorseHowever if like the poor devil of a painter we must conform to this pious canon  de mortuis c  which I own has a spice of piety in the  sound  of it and be obliged to paint both our angels and our devils out of the same potI then infer that our Sydenhams and Sangrados our Lucretiasand Massalinas our Sommers and our Bolingbrokesare alike entitled to statues and all the historians or satirists who have said otherwise since they departed this life from Sallust to Se are guilty of the crimes you charge me with "cowardice and injustice"  But why cowardice  "because 'tis not courage to attack a dead man who can't defend himself"  But why do you doctors of the faculty attack such a one with your incision knife Oh for the good of the living'Tis my pleaBut I have something more to say in my behalfand it is thisI am not guilty of the chargetho' defensible I have not cut up Doctor Kunastrokius at allI have just scratch'd himand that scarce skindeepI do him first all honourspeak of Kunastrokius as a great manbe he who he will and then most distantly hint at a drole foible in his characterand that not first reported  to the few who can even understand the hint by mebut known before by every chambermaid and footman within the bills of mortalitybut Kunastrokius you say was a great man'tis that very circumstance which makes the pleasantryfor I could name at this instant a score of honest gentlemen who might have done the very thing which Kunastrokius did and seen no joke in it at allas to the failing of Kunstrokius which you say can only be imputed to his friends as a misfortuneI see nothing like a misfortune in it to any friend or relation of Kunastrokiusthat Kunastrokius  upon occasions should sit with ******* and ******* I have put these stars not  to hurt your worship's delicacy  If Kunastrokius after all is too sacred a charactter to be even smiled at which is all I have done he has had better luck than his bettersIn the same page without imputation of cowardice I have said as much of a man of twice his wisdomand that is Solomon of whom I have made the same remark  "That they were both great men  and like all mortal men had each their ruling passion  The consolation you give me  "That my book however will be read enough to answer my design of raising a tax upon the public"  is very unconsolatoryto say nothing how very mortifying by hn an author is worse treated than a common ***** at this rate  "  You will get a penny by your sins and that's enough  "  Upon this chapter let me commentThat I proposed laying the world under contribution when I set pen to paperis what I own and I suppose I may be allow'd to have that view in my head in common with every other writer to make my labour of advantage to myself  Do not you do the same but I beg I may add that whatever views I had of that kind I had other viewsthe first of which was the hopes of doing the world good by ridiculing what I thought deserving of itor of disservice to sound learning chow I have succeeded my book must shewand this I leave entirely to the worldbut not to that little world  of your acquaintance  whose opinion and sentiments you call the general opinion of the best judges  without exception  who all affirm you say that my book cannot be put into the hands of any woman of  character  I hope you except widows doctorfor they are  not  all  so squeamishbut I am told they are all really of my party in return for some good offices done their interests in the th page of my second volume But for the chaste married and chaste unmarried part of the sexthey must not read my book Heaven forbid the stock of chastity should be lessen'd by the life and opinions of Tristram Shandyyes his opinionsit would certainly debauch 'em God take them under his protection in this fiery trial and send us plenty of Duenas to watch the workings of their humours 'till they have safely got thro' the whole workIf this will not be sufficient may we have plenty  of Sangrados to pour in plenty of cold water till this terrible fermentation is overas for the  nummum in loculo  which you mention to me a second time I fear you think me very poor or in debtI thank God tho' I don't aboundthat I have enough for a clean shirt every dayand a mutton chopand my contentment with this has thus far and I hope ever will put me above stooping an inch for it forestateCurse on it I like it not to that degree nor envy  you may be sure  any man who kneels in the dirt for itso that howsoever I may fall short of the ends proposed in commencing authorI enter this  protest  first that my end was  honest  and secondly that I wrote not be  fed  but to be  famous  I am much obliged to Mr Garrick for his very favourable opinionbut why dear Sir had he done better in finding fault with it than in commending it to humble me an author is not so soon humbled as you imagineno but to make the book better by castrationsthat is still  sub judice  and I can assure you upon this chapter that the very passages and descriptions you propose that I should sacrifice in my second edition are what are best relish'd by men of wit and some others whom I esteem as sound criticksso that upon  the whole I am still kept up if not above fear at least above despair and have seen enough to shew me the folly of an attempt of castrating my book to the prudish humours of particulars I believe the short cut would be to publish this letter at the beginning of the third volume as an apology for the first and second I was sorry to find a censure upon the insincerity of some of my friendsI have no reason myself to reproach any one manmy friends have continued in the same opinions of my books which they first gave me of itmany indeed have  thought better of 'em by considering them more few worse  I am Sir Your humble servant LAURENCE STERNE  LETTER XIII To the B of G  York  June  My Lord  NOT knowing where to send two sets of my Sermons I could think of no better expedient than to order them into Mr Berrenger's hands who has promised me that he will wait upon your Lordship with them the first moment he hears you are in town The truest and humblest thanks I  return to your Lordship for the generosity of your protection and advice to me by making a good use of the one I will hope to deserve the other I wish your Lordship all the health and happiness in this world for I am  Your Lordship's Most obliged and Most grateful Servant L STERNE  PS I am just sitting down to go on with Tristram

and am glad to understand you are got safe home and employ'd again in your proper studies and amusements You have it in your power to make that which is an amusement to yourself and others useful to both at least you should above all things beware of its becoming hurtful to either by any violations of  decency and good manners but I have already taken such repeated liberties of advising you on that head that to say more would be needless or perhaps unacceptable  Whoever is in any way well received by the public is sure to be annoy'd by that pest of the public  profligate scribblers  This is the common lot of successful adventurers but such have often a worse evil to struggle with I mean the overofficiousness of their indiscreet friends There are two Odes as they are call'd printed by Dodsley Whoever was the author he appears to be a  monster of impiety and lewdnessyet such is the malignity of the scribblers some have given them to your friend Hall and others which is still more impossible to yourself tho' the first Ode has the insolence to place you both in a mean and a ridiculous light But this might arise from a tale equally groundless and maglignant that you had shewn them to your acquaintances in  M S  before they were given to the public Nor was their being printed by Dodsley the likeliest means of discrediting the calumny  About this time another under the mask of friendship pretended to draw  your character which was since published in a  Female Magazine  for dulness who often has as great a hand as the devil in deforming God's works of the creation has  made them  it seems  male  and  female  and from thence it was transformed into a  Chronicle  Pray have you read it or do you know its author  But of all these things I dare say Mr Garrick whose prudence is equal to his honesty or his talents has remonstrated to you with the freedom of a friend He knows the inconstancy of what is called the Public towards all even the best intentioned of those  who contribute to its pleasure or amusement He as every man of honour and discretion would has availed himself of the public favour to regulate the taste and in his proper station to reform the manners of the fashionable world while by a well judged oeconomy he has provided against the temptations of a mean and servile dependency on the follies and vices of the great  In a word be assured

th instant came safe to hand c  which by the bye looks like a letter of business and you know very well from the first  letter I had the honour to write to you I am a man of no business at all This vile plight I found my genius in was the reason I have told Mr I would not write to you till the next posthopeing by that time to get some small recruit at least of vivacity if not wit to set out withbut upon second thoughts thinking a bad letter in seasonto be better than a good one out of itthis scrawl is the consequence which if you will burn the moment you get itI promise to send you a fine set essay in the stile of your female epistolizers cut and trim'd at all pointsGod defend me from such who never yet knew what it was to  say or write one premeditated word in my whole lifefor this reason I send you with pleasure because wrote with the careless irregularity of an easy heartWho told you Garrick wrote the medley for Beard'Twas wrote in his house however and before I left townI deny itI was not lost two days before I left townI was lost all the time I was there and never found till I got to this Shandy castle of mineNext winter I intend to sojourn amongst you with more decorum and will neither be lost or found any where  Now I wish to God I was at your elbowI have just finished one volume of Shandy and I want to read it to some one who I know can taste and relish humourthis by the way is a little impudent in mefor I take the thing for granted which their high mightinesses the world have yet to determinebut I mean no such thingI could wish only to have your opinionshall I in truth give you mineI dare notbut I will provided you keep it to yourselfknow then that I think there is more laughable humourwith equal degree of Cervantick satireif not more than in the lastbut we are bad judges of the merit of our children  I return you a thousand thanks for your friendly congratulations upon my habitationand I will take care you shall never wish me but well for

I RETURN to my new habitation fully determined to write as hard as can be and thank you most cordially my dear lady for your letter of congratulation upon my Lord Fauconberg's having presented me with the curacy of this placethough your congratulation comes somewhat of the latest as I have been possessed of it some timeI hope I have been of some service to his Lordship and he  has sufficiently requited me'Tis seventy guineas a year in my pocket though worth a hundredbut it obliges me to have a curate to officiate at Sutton and Stillington'Tis within a mile of his Lordship's seat and park

think the bestI shall write as long as I live 'tis in fact my hobbyhorse and so much am I delighted with my uncle Toby's imaginary character that I am become an enthusiastMy Lydia  helps to copy for

parishioners will I suppose be very merry upon the occasionYou will then be in townand feast your eyes with a sight which 'tis to be hoped will not be in either of our powers to see againfor in point of age we have about twenty years the start of his MajestyAnd now my dear friend I must finish thisand with every wish for your happiness conclude myself your most sincere wellwisher and friend  L

because a thin deathdoing pestiferous northeast wind blows in a line directly from crazycastle turret full upon me in this cuckoldly retreat for I value the northeast wind and all its powers  not a strawbut the transition from rapid motion to absolute rest was too violentI should have walked about the streets of York ten days as a proper medium to have passed thro' before I entered upon my restI staid but a moment and I have been here but a few to satisfy me I have not managed my miseries like a wise manand if God for my consolation under them had not poured forth the spirit of Shandeism into me which will not suffer me to think two moments upon any grave subject I would else just now lay down and diedieand yet in half an hour's time I'll lay a guinea I shall be as merry as a  monkeyand as mischievous too and forget it allso that this is but a copy of the present train running cross my brainAnd so you think this cursed stupidbut that my dear H depends much upon the quotâ horâ of your

strike a bargain for me before this time twelvemonth to lead a bear round Europe and from this hopes from you I verily believe it is that you are so high in her favour at presentShe swears you are a fellow of wit though humourous a funny jolly soul though somewhat splenetic and bating the love of women as honest as  gold  how do you like the  simileOh Lord now are you going to Ranelagh tonight

humanely given me the permission for a year of twoI shall set off with great hopes of its efficacy and shall write to my wife and daughter to come and join me at Paris else my stay could not be so

courier I could not write faster than I do having five letters more to dispatch by the same Gentleman he is going into another section of the globe and when he has seen you he will depart in peace  The Duke of Orleans has suffered my portrait to be added to the number  of some odd men in his collection and a gentleman who lives with him has taken it most expressively at full lengthI purpose to obtain an etching of it and to send it youyour prayer for me of  rosy health  is heardIf I stay here for three or four months I shall return more than reinstated My love to Mrs G  I am my dear G Your most humble Servant L STERNE  LETTER XXI To the same  Paris  April  My Dear G  I SNATCH the occasion of Mr Wilcox the late Bishop of Rochester's son leaving this place for England to write to you and I inclose it to Hall who will put it into your hand possibly behind the scenes I hear no news of you or your  empire  I would have said  kingdom  but here every thing is hyperbolizedand if  a woman is but simply pleased'tis  Je suis charmeé  and if she is charmed 'tis nothing less than that she is  ravi  sh'dand when ravish'd which may happen there is nothing left for her but to fly to the other world for a metaphor and swear qu'elle etoit toute  exiasieé  which mode of speaking is by the bye here creeping into use and there is scarce a woman who understands the  bon ton  but is seven times in a day in downright extasythat is the devil's in herby a small mistake of one world for the otherNow where am I got  I have been these two days reading a tragedy given me by a lady of talents to read and conjecture if it would do for you'Tis from the plan of Diderot and possibly half a translation of itThe Natural Son or the Triumph Virtue in five actsIt has too much sentiment in it at least for me the speeches too long and savour too much of  preaching  this may be a second reason it is not to my taste'Tis all love love love throughout without much separation in the character so I fear it would not do for your stage and perhaps for the very reason which recommend it to a French oneAfter a vile suspension  of three weekswe are beginning with our comedies and operas againyours I hear never flourished morehere the comic actors were never so lowthe tragedians hold up their headsin all senses I have known  one little man  support the theatrical world like a David Atlas upon his shoulders but Preville can't do half as much here though Mad Clairon stands by him and sets her back to hisshe is very great however and highly improved since you saw hershe also supports her dignity at table and has her public day every Thursday when she  gives to eat  as they say here to all that are hungry and dry  You are much talked of here and much expected as soon as the peace will let youthese two last days you have happened to engross the whole conversation at two great houses where I was at dinner'Tis the greatest problem in nature in this meridian that one and the same man should possess such tragic and comic powers and in such an equilibrio as to divide the world for which of the two nature intended him  Crebillion has made a convention with me which if he is not too lazy will be no bad  persiflage  as soon as I get to Thoulouse he has agreed to  write me an expostulatry letter upon the indecorums of T Shandywhich is to be answered by recrimination upon the liberties in his own worksthese are to be printed togetherCrebillion against SterneSterne against Crebillionthe copy to be sold and the money equally dividedThis is good Swisspolicy  I am recovered greatly and if I could spend one whole winter at Toulouse I should be fortified in my inner man beyond all danger of relapsingA sad asthma my daughter has been martyr'd with these three winters but mostly this last makes  it I fear necessary she should try the last remedy of a warmer and softer air so I am going this week to Versailles to wait upon Count Choiseul to solicit passports for themIf this system takes place they join me hereand after a month's stay we all decamp for the south of Franceif not I shall see you in June next Mr Fox and Mr Macartny having left Paris I live altogether in French familiesI laugh 'till I cry and in the same tender moments  cry 'till I laugh  I Shandy it more than ever and verily do believe that by mere Shandeism sublimated by a laughterloving people I fence as much against infirmities  as I do by the benefit of air and climate Adieu dear G present ten thousand of my best respects and wishes to and for my friend Mrs Ghad she been last night upon the Tulleries she would have annihilated a thousand French goddesses  in one single turn    I am most truly my dear friend L STERNE  LETTER XXII To Mrs S York  Paris  th  My Dear  IT is a thousand to one

pounds in your pocketif you consider Lydia must have two slight negligeesyou will want a new gown or twoas for painted linens  buy them in town they will be more admired because English than FrenchMrs

ancles and by which you have all more roomand what is more less heatbecause his head does not intercept the soreglass little or nothingLyd and I will enjoy this by turns sometimes I shall take a
