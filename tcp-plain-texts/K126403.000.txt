 In the Dead of the Night  Sung by Mrs Jordan in the Wedding Day  Sold by  J EVANS  No    Longlane  IN the dead of the night when with labor oppress'd  All mortals enjoy the sweet blessing of rest  A boy knock'd at my door I awoke with the noise  Who is it I said who is it that my rest thus destroys  He answered so softly so gently so mild  I am a poor little unfortunate child  Its a cold rainy night I am wet to the skin  And I have lost my way so pray let me in  In compassion I rose and striking a light  I open'd the door when a boy stood in sight  He had wings on his shoulders the rain from them drip'd  And with bow and with arrows the boy was equip'd  I stir'd up my fire set him down by my side  And with a warm napkin the wet from him dry'd  I chal'd him all o'er to keep out the cold air  And I wrung with my hands the wet from his hair  No sooner from wet and from cold he found ease  Then he took up the bow and said Ma'am if you please  would fain with your leave by experiment know  the rain has not damag'd the strings of my bow  Then straight from his quiver an arrow he drew  Which he aim'd at my heart and twang went the yew  My bow is undamag'd said he and my dart  And you will find trouble in bearing the smart
