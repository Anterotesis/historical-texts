 MARINA A PLAY OF THREE ACTS As it is Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL IN  CONVENTGARDEN  Taken from  PERICLES  PRINCE of  TYRE    By Mr LILLO  LONDON  Printed for JOHN GRAY at the  CrossKeys  in the  Poultry  near  Cheapside  MDCCXXXVIII Price  One Shilling    TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE the  Countess of  Hertford    MADAM  PErmit me to hope that you will pardon the honest ambition which has encourag'd me to seek a proper Patroness for  Marina  in your Ladyship whose real character gives countenance to the imaginary one and whose constant practice is a living example of that steady virtue and exalted piety which the Author of the old Play from whence this is taken has happily described in his  Princess of Tyre    Conscious of no mean views and secur'd by the universal acknowledgment  of your merit from the imputation of flattery I approach your Ladyship though a stranger and without any previous application with the less diffidence If this Play should appear on perusal to be designed to promote something better than meer amusement that will effectually recommend it to the favour of the Countess of  Hertford    To place merit in the gifts of fortune and happiness in what an hour may and a few years certainly will bring to an end is the folly and misery of too many who are reputed wise and great To be truly so is with your Ladyship to regard the finest understanding the most fruitful invention the happiest elocution talents far superior to wealth and dignity but as they subserve the interest of truth and virtue and render the possessors of them in the midst of affluence moderate even in the use of lawful pleasures humble in the  most exalted stations and capable of living above the world even in the possession of all it can bestow I am afraid and unwilling to offend But as universal benevolence is the perfection of virtue your Ladyship must suffer your own to be spoken of however painful it may be to you that others may not want a pattern for their encouragement or reprehension as they shall improve or neglect it A truly great mind discovers it self by nothing more than by a benign and well plac'd condescension of which your Ladyship's known esteem for the late excellent Mrs  Rowe  is a noble instance and an undoubted proof amongst many others which you daily give of the goodness of your heart and understanding and cannot be mentioned but to your honour  I can affirm and I hope I shall be thought sincere that what I have said doth not proceed from custom as a  Dedicator but from a mind fully convinc'd of its truth in every circumstance and a heart touch'd with a character so very amiable  That you may long live an ornament and a support of those excellent principles which you profess and practice and that your influence and example may do all the good that you your self can wish is the earnest desire of  Your  LADYSHIP  's Most obedient Humble Servant  GEO LILLO  PROLOGUE  HARD is the task in this discerning age  To find new subjects that will bear the stage  And bold our bards their low harsh strains to bring  Where  Avon  's Swan has long been heard to sing  Blest Parent of our Scene whose matchless wit  Tho' yearly reap'd is our best harvest yet  Well may that genius every heart command  Who drew all nature with her own strong hand  As various as harmonious fair and great  With the same vigour and immortal heat  As through each element and form she shines  We view Heav'ns handmaid in her  Shakespear  's lines  Though some mean scenes injurious to his fame  Have long usurp'd the honour of his Name  To glean and clear from chaff his least remains  Is just to him and richly worth our pains  We dare not charge the whole unequal play  Of  Pericles  on him yet let us say  As gold though mix'd with baser matter shines  So do his bright inimitable lines  Throughout those rude wild scenes distinguish'd stand  And show he touch'd them with no sparing hand  With humour mix'd in your forefathers way  We've to a single tale reduc'd our play  Charming  Marina  's wrongs begin the scene  Pericles  finding her with his lost Queen  Concludes the pleasing task Shou'd as the soul  The fire of  Shakespear  animate the whole  Shou'd heights which none but he cou'd reach appear  To little errors do not prove severe  If when in pain for the event surprize  And sympathetick joy shou'd fill your eyes  Do not repine that so you crown an art  Which gives such sweet emotions to the heart  Whose pleasures so exalted in their kind  Do as they charm the sense improve the mind  Dramatis Personae  MEN  PERICLES

a calm Sea near the City of  Tharsus    Enter  Philoten  and  Leonine  QUEEN  THY oath remember thou hast sworn to do it  'Tis but a blow which never shall be known  Kind Nature hath been bounteous to thy youth  Thy graceful person language and address  Are almost peerless and thy steril fortune  Our favour shall improve But let not conscience  Which none who hope to rise in courts regard  Disarm your hand nor her bewitching eyes  Inflame your amorous bosom  Leon  I have promis'd  And will perform Yet she's a goodly creature  Q  The fitter for the Gods I while she lives  Am not a Queen This poor this friendless daughter  Of  Pericles  the wretched Prince of  Tyre    Whom my fond Parents from compassion foster'd  Is more belov'd more reverenc'd in  Tharsus  Than I their Sov'reign And when foreign Princes  Drawn by the fame of my high rank and beauty  As suitors throng my court let her appear  Such is the force of her detested charms  And I am streight neglected and their vows  And adorations all transferr'd to her  Here she comes weeping for my mother's death  She had good cause to love her Let not pity  Which women have cast off defeat your purpose  There's nothing thou can'st do live e'er so long  Shall yield thee so much profit  Leon  I'm determin'd  Enter  Marina  with a wreath of flowers    Mar  No I will rob gay  Tellus  of her weed  To strew thy grave with flowers The yellows blues  The purple violets and marygolds  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy tomb  While summer days do last Ah me poor maid  Born in a tempest when my mother dy'd  And now I mourn a second mother's loss  This world to me is like a lasting storm  That swallows piece by piece the merchant's wealth  And in the end himself  Q  Why sweet  Marina    Will you consume your youth in fruitless grief  And choose to dwell 'midst tombs and dreary graves  You harm your self and profit not the dead  Give me that wreath who have most cause to mourn  And let your heart take comfort I will leave you  To the sweet conversation of this Lord  Who has the art of dissipating sadness  Mar  Pray let me not bereave you of his service  I choose to be alone  Q  You know I love you  With more than foreign heart and will not see  The beauty marr'd that fame reports so perfect  Shou'd your good father come at length to seek you  And find his hopes and all report so blasted  He may repent the breadth of his great voyage  And blame our want of care  Mar  You may command  But I have no desire to tarry here  Q  Once more be chearful and preserve that form  That wins from all competitors the hearts  Of young and old 'Tis no new thing for me  To walk alone while you are well attended  Mar  I hope you're not offended  Q  Nothing less  Farewell sweet Lady Sir you will remember  Leon  Fear not she ne'er shall vex your quiet more  Exit  Queen  Mar  I know no cause yet think the gentle Queen  Went hence in some displeasure Is she well  What are your thoughts  Leon  That she's nor well nor gentle  Mar  I'm sorry for't Is the wind westerly  Leon  Southwest  Mar  When I was born the wind was north  Leon  The wind was north you say I should not hear her  Lest I relent The Queen's enamour'd of me  She prais'd my blooming youth and good proportion  And shall I lose a crown for foolish pity  Mar  My Father as  Lychorida  hath told me  My Nurse that's dead did never fear but then  Galling his kingly hands with haling ropes  And chearing the faint Sailors with his voice  Endur'd a sea that almost burst the deck  Leon  And when was this  Mar  I said when I was born  Never were waves nor winds more violent  This tempest and my birth kill'd my poor Mother  I was preserv'd and left an Infant here  Now do you think I e'er shall see my Father  Leon  Never Come say your prayers  Mar  What do you mean  Leon  If you require a little space for pray'r  That I'll allow you pray but be not tedious  The Gods are quick of ear and I'm in haste  Mar  Why will you kill me Sir  Leon  T' obey the Queen  Mar  Why will she have me kill'd I never wrong'd her  In all my life I never spake bad word  Nor did ill turn to any living creature  By chance I once trod on a simple worm  But I wept for it How have I offended  Leon  I'm not to reason of the deed but do it  Mar  You will not do't for all the world I hope  You are well favour'd and your looks bespeak  A very gentle heart I saw you lately  When you caught hurt in parting two that fought  Good sooth it shew'd well in you Do so now  If the Queen seeks my life come you between  And save poor me the weaker  Leon  I have sworn  And will dispatch  Mar  Yet hear me speak once more  Kneeling  O do not kill me though I know no cause  Why I should wish to live who ne'er knew joy  Or fear to die who ever fear'd the Gods  But 'tis perhaps the property of youth  To doat on its new being and depend  Howe'er deprest on pleasures in reversion  You are but young your self then as you hope  To prove the fancy'd bliss of years to come  Spare me O spare me now  Leon  You plead in vain  Commit your soul to heaven  Mar  Can you speak thus  O can you have compassion for my soul  Yet at the instant by a cruel deed  That Heaven and Earth must hate destroy your own  Enter  Pirate  and interposes      Pir  Hold villain Fear not fair one I'll defend thee  Leon  Slave how doth her defence belong to you  Who and what are you    Pir  A man fool  Alexander  the Great was no more You are a poltron a coward and a rascal to draw cold iron on a woman  Leon  I want not courage base intruding villain  To scourge thy insolence  fight  Mar  You gracious Gods  Must I behold and be the cause of murder  Enter second and then third  Pirate    Pir  A prize A prize    Pir  Half part Mate half part    Pir  What are they quarrelling about my booty  Hold Sir  Leon  With all my heart  If you increase so fast 'tis time to fly  I know them now for Pirates  Exit  Leonine    Pir  Hands off I found her first    Pir  That's no claim amongst us    Pir  No none at all Every man is to have his share of all the prizes we take    Pir  Nay if you come to that she belongs to the whole ship's company    Pir  Who denies that But I will not quit my part in her to the Captain himself sink me if I do    Pir  Nor I by  Neptune      Pir  This is no place to dispute in We shall have the city rise upon us therefore we must have her aboard suddenly  Omnes  Ay bear a hand bear a hand    Pir  Come sweet Lady    Pir  None shall hurt you    Pir  We'll lose our lives before we'll see you wrong'd  Mar  You sacred powers who rule the rudest hearts  Protect me whilst among these lawless Men  From loath'd pollution violence and shame  And bold blasphemers who shall hear the wonder  Shall own you are and just    Pir  A rare prize if a man cou'd have her to himself A pox of all ill fortune say I  Exeunt  Reenter  Leonine  Leon  These Pirates serve the daring ruffian  Valdes    A desperate crew they are There is no fear  Marina  will return They'll doubtless have  Their pleasure of her first and then perhaps  According to a custom long us'd by 'em  Sell her where she will ne'er be heard of more  Then I may take the merit of her death  And claim the whole reward It shall be so  I'll swear to the fond Queen I have dispatch'd  And thrown her in the sea A rare device  These rogues have sav'd me from a hellish deed  And a fair wind attend them  Exit  Leonine  SCENE II  A House in  Ephesus  Enter  Bawd  and  Bolt  Bawd  Sad times  Bolt    Bolt  Ay very sad times Mistress  Bawd  This new order so much talk'd of for suppressing publick lewdness

storm Mother  Coupler    Bawd  Ay  Bolt  I have had my ups and my downs no Woman more But I will not be discourag'd I will not neglect business for a rumour neither The mart will fill the town and we

wind would blow 'em all to pieces I must have others whatever they cost me  Bolt  Shall I search the slave market  Bawd  Those we buy there are mostly half worn out before we have them There was the little  Transilvanian  you bought last did not live above three months and never brought in half the money she cost  Bolt  Ay she was quickly made meat for worms But there are losses in all trades and

sin you live by But see what we have brought you Here's a Paragon  Bolt  aside the Bawd  Mark the colour of her hair complection shape and age  Bawd  I have noted them all When Nature form'd this piece she meant me a good turn  Vald  Here's that will repair your decay'd arras and set you up for a Bawd of condition  Bawd  I was just saying what stale worn out creatures are daily brought to market and those who buy of Pirates must expect as bad or worse And then I have choice enough and those not blown on  Vald  Nay nay use your pleasure You have the first proffer of her If she's not for your turn there's no harm done She's any one's money  Bawd  You don't consider the dulness of the times If men were as they have been  Vald  A virgin too  Bawd  A likely matter coming from the hands of such a lawless crew  Vald  You are deceived We have laws amongst our selves or I would not have parted with her However we are distinguish'd by titles and office each man hath a right to his proportion of every prize we take which all claiming on the sight of her and refusing to compound with or give place to any other there ensued such jealousy such fury and contention that we were obliged by common consent to leave her untouch'd and dispose of her as soon as possible to prevent the cutting of one anothers throats  Bawd  Well what's your price  Vald  What do you mean ready

principal person in this family after our Mistress It may be well worth your while to make a friend of me  Mar  I know not but am sure I want a friend I am of maids most wretched  Bolt  I'll quickly ease you of the wretchedness of being a maid Yet you must pass for one and often  Mar  I understand you not  Bolt  Such things are common here But of that and other needful arts in our profession my Mistress will inform you  lays hold of her  Mar  Why do you rudely lay your hands upon me  I am not to be touch'd  Bolt  Not to be touch'd Ha ha in troth a pretty jest and will do rarely with some

Ay troop follow your Leader We'll teach you honesty modesty and religion with a vengeance  Mar  If fires be hot steel sharp or waters deep  Unstain'd I still my virgin fame will keep  Exeunt  The End of the First  ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  An Apartment adjoining to a Temple at the Court of  Tharsus    Enter  Queen  and  Leonine  LEONINE  TO bury kneaded earth for dead  Marina  Was a most quaint device The cheated  Tharsians  Pierced Heaven with their howlings but suspicion  As if Death closed her busy prying eyes  When the fair  Tyrian  died still slumbers on  The monument of  Parian  marble wrought  And epitaph in characters of gold  Were my contrivance too and now are finish'd  I have done all that your resentment ask'd  And well secured your safety and your fame  'Tis more than time you listen'd to my suit  Q  Can nothing but my person and my crown  Reward your service  Leon  I deserve them both  Q  Were I sole mistress of the spacious world  I'd give it all this murther were undone  The very Wrens of  Tharsus  will betray it  To  Pericles  who now comes to demand her  Leon  That's only in my power Give me your promise  To be my bride and seal my lips for ever  Q  What wed a murtherer  Leon  Who made me so  Resolve in time ere ruin overtake you  O'ertake us both Your flatt'ries drew me in  You taught me to be bloody and ambitious  And I will now partake your throne or perish  But not alone You know how popular  The injur'd Prince of  Tyre  is here in  Tharsus    This City now the seat of wealth and plenty  Whose towers invade the clouds which never stranger  Beheld but wonder'd at as all acknowledge  Had but for  Pericles  been desolate  Forsaken or the grave of its inhabitants  A den for bats to build and wolves to howl in  How many thousands living now remember  When famishing with hunger Prince and people  Sat down and wept for bread when tender mothers  Fed on their new born babes and man and wife  Drew lots who first shou'd die and furnish food  To lengthen out the life of the survivor  This our distress brought  Pericles  from  Tyre    Who bravely scorning to improve th' advantage  And make a conquest of a prostrate land  Did with a lib'ral hand supply our  wants  And turn our dying groans to songs of joy  For this the  Tharsians  love him as a Father  And as a God adore him  Q  Be it so  I'm still their Queen and hold 'em in subjection  Leon  Yes while they please As we have seen a Lyon  Held with a thread until some accident  Or his rash keeper's folly rous'd his fury  They've some regard for the good line you came of  And yet are thereby hardly held from outrage  So hateful have the pride and other vices  Notorious in you made you to the million  But shou'd they hear or have the least suspicion  Of your foul dealing with the much lov'd daughter  Of royal  Pericles  like flames let loose  They'd in an instant make this lofty dome  Your fun'ral pile and give the winds your ashes  Or having torn you in ten thousand pieces  With honest scorn cast out your loath'd remains  For kites and crows to feed on  Q  'Tis too true  Shou'd this dark deed take light my reign were ended  I see I must comply She who has us'd  A wicked agent in a shameful act  Must thenceforth be his slave You have my word  Now your ambition's serv'd teach me to answer  The King of  Tyre  when he demands his child  Leon  Say she dy'd suddenly as what's more common  That you wept o'er her hearse and mourn her yet  Then show the monument and epitaph  Procur'd at your expence and her griev'd Sire  Shall curse the cruel fates that still pursue him  With plague on plague but ne'er suspect that you  Have been their instrument  Q  The deed's not mine  Trumpets  Pericles  comes and I must seem content  The Traytor's in the toils and cannot 'scape me  Enter  Pericles Escanes  Guards and Attendants    Q  Welcome great  Pericles  to mourning  Tharsus    My royal parents and your faithful friends  Cleon  and  Dionysia  are no more  Per  Ent'ring the port I met the fatal news  The hot salt tears this unthought loss drew from me  Are yet wet on my cheeks O two such friends  But I'm a man born to adversity  No land e'er gave me rest and winds and waters  In their vast tenniscourt have as a ball  Used me to make them sportBut to my purpose  'Tis more than twice seven years since I beheld thee  With my  Marina  both were infants then  Peace and security smil'd on your birth  Her's was the rudest welcome to this world  That e'er was Prince's child Born on the sea  Hence is she call'd  Marina  in a tempest  When the high working billows kist the Moon  And the shrill whistle of the boatswain's pipe  Seem'd as a whisper in the ear of Death  Born when her Mother dy'd That fatal hour  Must still live with me O you gracious Gods  Why do you make us love your goodly gifts  And snatch them streight away The waves receiv'd  My Queen A sea mate's chest coffin'd her corpse  In which she silent lies 'midst groves of coral  Or in a glitt'ring bed of shining shells  The air fed lamps of Heaven the spouting whale  And dashing waters that roll o'er her head  Compose a monument to hide her bones  Spacious as Heaven and lasting as the frame  Of universal Nature  Esc  Royal Sir  This sad companion dulley'd Melancholy  So long carest shou'd now be cast aside  Per  O never never Do not interrupt me  In the days glorious walk or peaceful night  When grief shou'd seem to sleep a welcome guest  She fills my anxious thoughts and broken slumbers  With the lov'd image of my lost  Thaisa    And prompts me to rehearse the ofttold tale  Of her disast'rous end and chiefly now  I come to seek the Phenix that took life  From her dead ashesBut I've almost done  We left my Princess in her wat'ry tomb  And as the winds gave way arriv'd at  Tharsus    Here to your royal parents I committed  Whose love I had experienc'd and deserv'd  My only child to give her education  Suiting her rank and in some sort supply  Her pious mother's loss And this the rather  For that the peace of  Tyre  was sorely broken  By foreign foes and treasons bred at home  For I have drank the dregs of all misfortunes  I vow'd too then though it show'd wilful in me  That all unsister'd shou'd this heir of mine  Remain till she were marry'd Those commotions  That long embroil'd me being now compos'd  I'm come to pay my thanks and claim my daughter  Q  Unhappy Prince wou'd Heaven have heard my Pray'rs  Thy sweet  Marina  now by my lov'd side  Had bless'd thy longing eyes but wretched mortals  In vain oppose the powers that rule above 'em  Shou'd we rage loud as did the winds and seas  When she was born things would be as they are  Unfold those doors and let the careworn King  Behold the testimony of our love  To our fair foster Sister and our grief  For her untimely fate  The  Scene  draws and discovers a Temple with the Monument    Per  Reading  "Here lieth interr'd  "Marina  daughter to the Prince of  Tyre    O thou who gav'st me reason and reflection  Eternal  Jove  rebuke these swelling thoughts  That wou'd dispute your goodness or your being  Bind them in walls of brass Let me remember  I hold my powers from thee

passage to the realms of death  From this curst hour I'll never speak again  To mock with words unutterable grief  But make my manners savage as my fortunes  And be as wretched as the Gods wou'd have

of royal robes shall gird my loins  And ashes be my crown I'll ne'er return  Ne'er view thy spires again renowned  Tyre    But wander through the world a wilful vagrant  And ne'er taste comfort more

stars about my throne  And veil'd their crowns to my supremacy  Then like the sun all paid me reverence  For what I was and all the grateful lov'd me  For what I did bestow now not a glowworm  But in

 With strong emotions and unusual transports  Per  I pray who is this Lady  Lys  A miracle of goodness sent by Heav'n  To make this land most happy In her bloom  After a tempest in the which 'twas thought  All her companions perish'd she was cast  Here on our coast  Per  Near it I lost the mother  Of my  Marina    Tha  Hark what musick's that  Per  These very hands did cast into those seas  The treasure of my soul  Tha  I know it now  It is the harmony the spheres do make  Nay do not weep I am but overjoy'd  I shall recover strait  Per  Pray how long since  Was this strange chance you speak of  Lys  'Tis I've heard  About as many years as your fair daughter  Seems to be old  Per  I do begin to doat  And yet the Gods are mighty as they're good  How was she found  Lys  Close in a sailor's coffer  She seem'd a breathless corpse but my good father  Now with the Gods by his superior skill  Did find it was not so and by his art  Which equall'd his humanity restor'd her  To health and vigour  Tha  Where O where's my Lord  Per  Thaisa  's voice  Tha  Yet let me look again  If he be none of mine my sanctity  Shall guard me still from his licentious touch  I'll none but  Pericles    Per  Her face her stature  That beauty that nor time nor grief cou'd change  It is it can be none but my  Thaisa    Tha  But dare we trust  Per  By  Jove  I'd not be kept  A moment longer absent from thy bosom  Tho' I were sure as I did press thy lips  My high wrought spirits wou'd dissolve to air  And leave me cold and lifeless in thy arms  Tha  You sons and daughters of adversity  Preserve your innocence and each light grief  So bounteous are the Gods to those who serve them  Shall be rewarded with ten thousand joys  Mar  My heart bounds in me and wou'd fain be gone  Into my mother's bosom  Per  See who kneels there thy Child and mine  Thaisa    Bought almost with thy life  Tha  And cheaply purchased  Blest and my own Thou mak'st my joy compleat  Esc  Hail royal master  Lys  Happy monarch hail  Per  O good  Escanes  strike me noble Sir  Give me a gash put me to present pain  Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me  O'er bear the mounds of frail mortality  And sweetness be my bane O come come both  Thou whom the boundless ocean gave me back  O let me bury thee a second time  And hide thee in my heart and thou who gavest  Him life who did beget thee come thou too  There's endless space and as repleat with love  As the great deep with waters Wou'd our voices  Rise with our thoughts we'd thank the holy Gods  As loud as their high thunder threaten'd us  When thou wast born and thou did'st seem to die  This tribute paid not to our will but power  I do resolve for  Tharsus  there to strike  Th' inhospitable Queen  Lys  I have advice  My Lord that she is slain by  Leonine    One who was poison'd by her  Mar  That's the wretch  She hir'd to murder me  Lys  'Tis added too  She dy'd in evil fame and unlamented  Then mighty Sir repose your self awhile  After your weary griefs and make our court  Proud with your presence  Per  You're a noble host  And sue to purchase trouble with expence  Injoy thy wish  Lys  Herein I'm highly honour'd  But royal Sir I've yet a bolder suit  Per  Your princely Sire preserv'd  Thaisa  's life  And you are master of as gracious parts  In mind and form as any I e'er noted  You shall prevail be it to woo my daughter  Lys  Thanks royal Sir If she accept my vows  I am the very happiest of mankind  Tha  And she sweet maid most happily bestow'd  O my dear Lord he has been noble to her  But that and all we've proved since our sad parting  We will rehearse at leisure I have had  From sure intelligence the heavy news  Of my good Father's death and that our subjects  In peace and loyalty do wait our coming  Per  Heav'n make a star of him Yet here my Queen  We'll celebrate their nuptials and our selves  Will in fair  Cyprus  spend our future days  And to our children leave the crown of  Tyre    To cast new light on truth in

the present days  Shall be the theme of censure or of praise  When they shall blame what's wrong what's right allow  Just as you treat your own forefathers now  I'm thinking what a figure you will make  No light concern Sirs where your fame's at stake  I hope we need not urge your country's cause  You'll guard her glory and assert her laws  Nor force your ruin'd race mad with their pains  To curse you as the authors of their chains  We dare not think we wou'd not fear you will  For  Britons  though provok'd are  Britons  still  Yet let not this kind caution give offence  The surest friend to liberty is sense  How that declines the drooping arts declare  Are your diversions what your fathers were  At masquerades your wisdom to display  You make the stupid farce for which you pay  Musick it self may be too dearly bought  Nor was it sure design'd to banish thought  But Sirs what e'er's your fate in future story  Well have the  British  Fair secured their glory  When worse than barbarism had sunk your taste  When nothing pleas'd but what laid virtue waste  A sacred band determin'd wise and good  They jointly rose to stop th' exotick flood  And strove to wake by  Shakespear  's nervous lays  The manly genius of  Eliza  's days  Be it an omen of returning sense  Others adopt our softness and expence  Well pleas'd such harmless insults we may bear  Those follies lost we've numbers yet to spare  Unquestion'd let 'em rob us of our shame  We need but ask our treasure and our fame  Printed for  J GRAY  at the  Cross Keys  in the  Poultry  near  Cheapside    I GEORGE
