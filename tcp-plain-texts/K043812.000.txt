 REASONS WHY  DAVID GARRICK    Esq  SHOULD Not appear on the Stage  c  Price One Shilling  REASONS WHY  DAVID GARRICK    Esq  SHOULD Not appear on the Stage IN A LETTER TO  JOHN RICH    Esq  LONDON Printed for J COOKE at Shakespear's Head behind the ChapterHouse St Pauls ChurchYard MDCCLIX  A LETTER c  SIR  THERE are many undeniable and irrefragable arguments to support my negative but as  Vellum  says Out of several I shall only mention a few  I need not in this case beg a question which will readily be granted and therefore I shall take it for granted that all persons who go to the theatre go there for Entertainment in order to hear and see every thing and every body If I read Mr  Palmer's  name in the bill of the  way of the world  for  Mirabel  I go with a conviction that I shall see and hear him with entire satisfaction and so of Mr  King  in the part of  Atall  in the  Double Gallant  now in neither of these plays nor in many others does Mr  Garrick  intrude upon my entertainment nor obstruct my satisfaction because he does not play in them But when I go to see the  Suspicious Husband  there I see Mr  Garrick  in the part of  Ranger  and sure no man will deny but that he plays that part  better than any other man in the world But will any person be so hardy as to tell me I shall part with my money to see  honest Ranger  only I want to see  Frankly  and  Bellamy  and ratling  Jack Meggot  I would willingly see Mr  Strictland  the character who gives title to the Comedy yet am I herein debarred by Mr  Garrick  's instrusion for when he appears on the stage I am so blinded either by prejudice or admiration that I can see no body else I can hear no body else I can bear no body else for instance the other day I wanted to hear  Jacky Meggot  invite  Ranger  and his friend in the  Italian  taste to his house but I never heard a syllable of it  When  Ranger  is with his two friends  Bellamy  and  Frankly  I hear him indeed  speak of them and I am as much surpized to find him speaking  to  them but I can never set my eyes on them while he is by Before he came in I could see and hear them as distinctly and as clearly as visibly and audibly as ever I saw or heard any thing in all my life but when he comes in whether it is that he clouds my eyes or fills my sight I cannot for my soul determine but I see no more of  Bellamy  and  Frankly  If they  are  there I do not hear them and though I use my glass I cannot see them till he goes out again  I hear him say plain enough  Now it is dear boy and honest Ranger  and  just now you would have cut my throat  but I never heard that they said any such words but from his report  I suspected my own hearing nor I would not believe my own eyes till I asked a gentleman who sat by me whether  Frankly  or  Bellamy  were on the Stage and he said that he could not see any such personsThen said I who the devil is he speaking toBy my soul replied the gentleman I can't tell for I see neither of them nor do I believe either of them to be on the stage if they are it is more than I can say and I am as uneasy as you can be to see one man play the whole comedy by himself it is really too hard upon him and I can't find the reason why he keeps so many people in sallary to so little purpose and almost for doing nothing  I came here the other night when Mr  Garrick  did not play and I saw every body and heard every thing to my entire satisfaction but when this confounded  Garrick  comes on the stage he confounds my eyes and ears in such a manner that I am deprived of both organs which are entirely engrossed by his appearance and voice  When my side'sman had done speaking I asked a lady who sat by me Who Mr  Garrick  was speaking to She said She could not tellWhen he says  any letters  or  message  does he speak to the scene for by the lord I see no servant She said She thought her eyes pretty good and that she was as blind as myself in that respectand indeed she had the highest pair of  eyes that ever my eyes beheld yet clear as her vision was she could see no servant nor any thing else but this individual  Garrick  He is not of so gigantic a stature nor do I think he ever will exceed six feet in height he is not so fat as Sir  John Falstaff  and how the devil does this manager manage to cover every body and every thing from our sightHe must deal in magic thus to interpose between the spectators and every body else in such a  black art  manner as render them invisible  He is the reverse of a darklanthorn which hides the bearer and throws light upon every body else he is like the focus of a glass which attracts all the rays of light he is like a sundial which interprets time by light and shadehimself  all  light  every body else all  shade  Now a representation may be called a picture but no good picture was ever all light and all shade but both should be happily compounded and mixed to make a picture agreeable and striking  I like a fool the other night went to see the  Alchymist  I saw  Burton  and  Palmer  plain enough till  Abel Drugger  came on fiddling with his shopkeeper's apron He no sooner came on than away went  Subtle  and captain  Face  says I to one near me is not this monstrous that  Subtle  and  Face  should go off the stage at the time when  Nab  wants them He answered that he thought it unaccountable and that he was served so once before the last season and that if he had recollected himself in that particular  he would not have come to see  Abel Drugger  alone  You know the plot says he is mixt and has a variety of persons in the drama but the devil a one person here but  Abel Drugger  You shall see him fight a parcel of  Shadows  and beat them off presently He is excellent at  Skiomachy  He did so in a very short time beating the air with as much dexterity as if there had been a dozen people on the stage Well said I to the gentleman near me I don't like this egotism for as  Young  the satyrist expresses it  and I's  the little hero of each tale  Another cogent reason I shall offer to the public and you sir why Mr  Gartick  should  not  appear on the stage is  that besides blindfolding people by his fascination he imposes upon our hearing rendering us deaf to every other person but himselfThis is an intolerable  monopily  thus to seize upon and captivate our two senses  I have spoken to that of sight already and now I shall enter upon that of hearing  We have had occular proofs sufficient to convince all reasonable people that is all people that will believe their eyes that Mr  Garrick  should not appear upon the stage Had he happened to be an actor in  Paris  he would long since have been put into the Bastile but as he lives under so mild a government as that of  GreatBritain  the best we can do is to put him under the punishment of proscription  or in other words to banish him the stage the scene of his delinquency nor is it indeed reasonable in the nature of things to permit him to reign any longer in so unlimited a tyranny a tyranny for which some men would long since have been brought to the scaffold  I most wonder why his own company have not entered into a formal prosecution against him and brought their  habeas corpus  for rendering them invisible and inaudible they permit their names to be printed which is a kind of bond or promissary note payable to the public that they will enact such and such characters now if Mr  Austin  or Mr  Burton  or any of the players engages thus in print to perform this or that part and does not appear when  Garrick  comes on have not I my writ of insolvency against him what can they plead why I should not oblige them to appear when Mr  Garrick  comes onWhy do they go off that instantThere's no body in the galleries find any fault with them they and every other actor or actress in  Drurylane  have their peculiar merits in their own particular cast Each has his proper walk and shines in his own department and the next time I see them disappear on  Garrick's  entering I shall say with the witches in  Macbeth appear appear  So I give them this fair warning  When Mr  Garrick  says in  Hamlet    I am too much in the Sun  he speaks an evident truth and if I may be allowed the Expression a  palpable  one It is downright demonstrationHe is  too much in the sun  what he says needs no illustration for he is  so much in the sun  that he takes all the light to himself and like a ray of glory or an  infula  of beams eclipses all others  The moon herself and most of the stars who borrow their light from the sun have not so much reason to complain If they have not light of their own they shine in borrowed robes but they would take it very ill of  Dan Phoebus    that wandering knight so fair  if he should like  Garrick  get up of a frosty night put on his damask nightgown and then put them all outIt would be as cruel in the  sun  to do so as it is in  Othello  when he  puts out the light and then puts out the light  And I think with deference to the judgment of the public that it is as insufferable in Mr  Garrick  to extinguish all  other lights but his own and I hope they will take proper cognizance and jointly agree to put him out by the concurring votes of ostracism  I will only ask the company of  Drurylane  house has the manager as  Pythagoras  did of old to his disciples enjoin them silence for any term of years If he has done this in his wisdom 'tis but reasonable he should set them an exampleHe should like a good father enforce by his  precedent  what he preaches in doctrine and not like an incendiary  set us all by the ears  and like the sentence of perjury impose the  pillory  upon his audience I must own that I am so great a lover of music that I could sit a whole hour to hear a good  solo  performed by a good hand but by the blood of the  Mirables  I do not see why Mr  Garrick  should every night for  these many seasons play nothing but  solos  This is rehearsal upon rehearsal and repetition upon the back of repetition Are we never to have a concert because truly Mr  Garrick  loves nothing but  solos  I think Mr  Holland  and Mr  Howard  and Mr  Bransby  and indeed every Mr and Mrs in the house have a just title to perform their particular parts in the theatrical concert  They are paid for doing so we the public pay them and we insist on their playing for the future or we will pay them and repay themHad we found fault with their performance at any one time had we condemned their theatrical merit whether natural or acquired if we had refused to give them what is their undoubted right our just applause they might offer  some plea for not discharging their duty but as matters stand we think this time as seasonable as well as unseasonable silence is insensible and we hope to see a reformation in due time which yet we think cannot well be made except Mr  Garrick  begins it by a solemn departure from the stage since we may apply  Horace  's saying to him  Lusisti Satis  Tempus abire tibi  We shall now state some matters of fact in order to support our arguments  One matter of fact is that when he played  Hamlet  no body else appeared when he was on Our attention was so much engrossed by  Hamlet  that  we took no notice of any other person I neither saw  Bernardo  nor  Marcellus  nor heard one syllable of either  Rosenerans  or  Guilderstern  while  Hamlet  was onWhen  Hamlet  says  The play's the thing  With which I'll catch the conscience of the thing we expected there would have been a play but if there was any such thing I did not see it or hear it it might have been play'd for any thing I know but certain it is it escaped me Possibly I was gazing too attentively on  Hamlet  sitting at the feet of  Ophelia  and looking at something through her fanI knew that the object of his intuition was to have been the  King  but the devil a king was there or if there was it was a king of Hamlet's  own making like that when he says  A  King of shreds and patches  As in like manner in the  Alchymist  is it fitting that  Abel Dugger  should play the whole play himself and let no one else be seen or heard while he's on If monopoly in trade be an injury to the public then it must be confessed with respect to our entertainments a theatrical monopoly is an unfair monopoly an embargo on our taste a kind of an inquisition a very starchamber on our understanding and if trade in general suffers by such monopolies so is taste in general utterly depraved by such unjust engrossment  Why should not the witches be seen or heard when  Macbeth  comes in when he says  Ye black confederate midnight hags  What are ye doing  Instead of answering him  a deed    c  as they should do they instantly disappear they vanish and are no more seen he bewitches the very witches rendering them and all their diabolical proceedings invisibleThe cauldron is no more he extinguishes their infernal flames and plays hell with hell itself sending the very devil as the sentence does the condemned criminal to the place from whence he cameAnd is this sufferable Will any man be so hardy as to say this is to be borneit is not to be borne  I think the witches have as great a right to answer as  Macbeth  to ask a question at least I think it is so in your house sir and what is sauce for the goose should be sause for the gander as the saying is now at your house there are no such proceedings no such indecorum He does not swallow up the witches and devour them at a mouthful He does not like the famous  fireeater  feed upon brimstone and other combustibles which reminds me of a story I have somewhere read applicable to Mr  Garrick  's thus eating up the  devil  without a grain of salt I say applicable to him for one very good reason and that is if I do not insert it here I shall forget to insert it any where else  A certain nobleman to divert himself carried a young Blackamoor just imported to one of the Papish chapels in the city and when the priest was eating the wafer the blackamoor asked his master What that man was eating Who answered that he was eating his GodI wish we had him in our country says the blackamoor for he would eat the devil purely  This story needs no comment and therefore we shall make none we hope therefore from what we have advanced that these irrefragable arguments will have some weight with Mr  Garrick  and you are at liberty to shew this letter to him if he is able to answer all or any one of them to our satisfaction we shall subscribe a submissive acknowledgment  of our fault in the daily advertiser with the hopes of forgiveness and promise that we shall never be again guilty in this particular if not we shall say as the King in the Mourning bride expresses it  Take away his face  For we must acknowledge that it dazzles our sight in such a manner that we can see nothing else Nor indeed is any thing herein written sir in the least to insinuate any thing to the prejudice of your house which we honour and respect as we should do and we should want taste did we say any other Your performers have merit enough to extort praise from the best judges or the nicest criticks and perhaps one of the best  low comedians in the world is in  CoventGarden  Neither is any thing herein written intended to depreciate or run down the Actors of  Drurylane  but the reverse is the intention of this letter for if we were hardy enough to say that all and every of them has not theatrical merit in an eminent degree it were to give our own judgments the lie and the falsehood like dust thrown in the wind would fly in our facesit were a shallow artifice because we run down this most  unreasonable man  thereby to traduce or lessen that good esteem which they have learned by their good quallities or because they are not seen or heard when Mr  Garrick  appears that therefore they are not  fit to be seen or that they should not be  The reverse of all this is meant and intended by the whole tenour of which however tortured to confess will never be made to confess what it never intended I say it is fitting they should be seen or heard and that in order thereto we have given this our safe advice to  David Garrick  Esq  manager of  DruryLane  playhouse that he will appear no more on the stage which advice we should not have given in so peremptory a manner if he did not eclipse those who play with him Our advice is candid free and disinterested since it will be allowed that as there cannot be two suns neither can there be two  Garricks  since he like his own  Richard    has no brother  is  like no brother  He is himself alone  If then no similarity appears no corresponding features are seen upon a comparison that superiority of light which we allow him and which if we did not allow him the world would do it for us has raised him to an eminence above all in the theatrical walk and as a witty orangewoman said to a gentleman who asked Where was his Fellow meaning his servant By G  sir not in Christendom so we may say of  Garrick  not in the universe and for this one material mighty and substantial reason we exclude him from the stage that other people may have their turn to shine for if we did with him as  Juliet  says of  Romeo    Take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world would be in love with night and pay no worship to the garnish sun  Mr  Garrick  would possibly glitter every atom and particle of him and like a looking glass broke into ten thousand shatters each brittle shatter would glitter and sparkle still  So that if the other actors eminent as they are each in his own walk will condescend to allow this superiority in Mr  Garrick  we think they will join with us in expelling him the house as an unruly member who takes up so much box that he elbows off every body else one whose voice is  so loud that like that of  Sentor  the herald it draws ten thousand voices whose tongues so voluble that he will not even allow the very women to indulge their favourite faculty of talking And sure when one man can impose silence upon so many women a task above the power of all the husbands in England or in the world to perform what must we think of such a sway such a dispotic sovereign arbitrary rule should not be vested in any subject and it is more than the Grand Monarque Lewis himself would dare to do in France where his motto is Sic  volo    sic Jubeo  nay his favourites Pompadour would not obey so unreasonable a command and if he had the confidence to proclaim silence in a printed edict or declaration of his will  he would in all human all moral probability raise an army of female insurgents to rebel against his throne and like Sampson pull an old house over his ears we are delighted with the sweetness of the female voice as they are the most harmonious and shall Mrs  Cibber  Mrs  Pritchard  Mrs  Clive  Miss  Macklin  and the other actresses give up a privilege they have a right to enjoy a perogative they have maintained since the days of old mother Eve who no doubt enjoyed it in its full extent nor shall we join with Mr  Garrick  or any other man or set of man in the kingdom to impose this unreasonable injunction on women who have given us such uncommon pleasure either in the tender or the elevated tones of their voices  It would be an act more cruel than castration to men by which the Italians equip their children for the opera and I will speak for any of the above actresses and promise this in their name that they would think such  dilapidation  for procuring men a voice would be less cruel than to take the voice of women by any means nay I will vouch for them all that they would rather be martyrs and suffer themselves to be  stoned to death  as the Italians are  stoned for life  than to suffer the forfeiture of so rich a treasure or to cede by what treaty soever upon any terms or conditions clause or clauses that high and mighty female right the use of their tongues and therefore we still continue to affirm as we have sufficiently proved our assertion by many solid  reasons that this unreasonable man  David Garrick    Esq  should Not appear on the stage and we hope you will shew him this letter nay we request it of you and his abdicating the throne of his ancestors and resigning his theatrical authority we don't mean management will for ever oblige  SIR  Your most obedient Humble servant Y Z  POSTCRIPT  SOMETHING I intended to say when I first sat down to write this epistle but it slipt my memory occasioned by the zeal I entertain for exterpating Garrick and has again this moment occured to me  In the name of commonsense are we to have nothing new at your house is variety never to please our imagination  shall we neither have a new play nor a new performer but will you persist and again lead us through that beaten path we have all these ten years walked in  If we have not something new form you within this mouth I shall be necessitated to give my vote for keeping Garrick at Drurylane  Now Sir after having requested of you something new I would recommend to your memory some account of Mademoiselle de Clairon a celebrated actress at Paris of whom you doubtless have heard I mean by giving you this account of her that you may instruct the novices that may offer  Her first appearance is excessively engaging she never comes in staring round upon the company as if she intended to count of benefits of the house or at least to see as well as be seen Her eyes are always at first intently fixed upon the persons of the drama and she lifts them by degrees with enchanting diffidence upon the spectators Her first speech or at least the first part of it is delivered with scarce any motion of the arm her hands and her tongue never set out together but the one prepares us for the other She sometimes begins with a mute eloquent attitude but never goes forward all at once with hands eyes head and voice This observation though it may appear  of no importance should certainly be adverted to  By this simple beginning she gives herself a power of rising in the scene As she proceeds every gesture every look acquires new violence till at last transported she fills the whole vehemence of the part and all the idea of the poet  Her hands are not alternately stretched out and then drawn in again as with the singing women at Sadler'swells they are employed with graceful variety and every moment please with new and unexpected eloquence  FINIS
