your father really dead and is the fortune equal to your expecta∣tions  Rup  Oh the old gentleman's as peaceable as an embalmed Egyptian and as to the fortune 'tis beyond my hopes  Net  I am sorry for it  Rup  Sorry Nettlewhy so  Net  Why because it will be all thrown away upon such flies as Fidget here  Fid  You would have no objection I suppose to his throwing it away upon wasps like yourselfdon't be so envious Nettle  Net  I envious Sir  Fid  EnviousAye as a lady's monkey of her lov∣er's caresses  Net  You only think so because I am not like you a possessor of no pleasures but what are distant or impos∣sible a stupid senseless anticipater of enjoyment  Fid  Well and what then I appeal to Rupee if there is any harm in such a character  Rup  None in the worldI think you the most ac∣commodating little creature alive and for pinning a lady's tucker catching a poney being bound for a thousand pounds or stropping a razor I don't think there's your fellow in the county  Fid  I knew Rupee would praise me  Net  And you really think a flexibility of temper a pusillanimity of soul a placid insipid damned unfeeling serenity  Rup  Oh the most despicable thing in nature why a man might as well be a piece of informed freestone  Ap Hugh  I have heard and audited and peen wit∣ness look you of your tisputes and tifferences and as I am confinced and persuaded you are fery good friends in the mane I to tesire and peseech you to shake hands  Net  You are a pretty accommodater of differences a Welchman full of pride petulance and pedigree hot as a leek and amorous as a goat  Ap Hugh  Why look you Mr Nettle it is petter to be proud of a good heart than a malicious one it is petter to be exasperated at receiving a wrong than toing one and as to hur peticree if hur happens to be more honorably tesoended than those who enfy hur it is the fault of hur ancestors and not hurself  Rup  Well said Ap Hugh  Fid  Ay and truly said too I have heard him talk with pleasure a hundred times of his Judors and his Llwel∣lins and his Walladers and his Gummeries and as to being amorous who would not excuse it when there is such a temptation as thisto be sure as to reputation we won't say much about that but what then there are many demure ones with better characters and worse sentiments  Ap Hugh  It is a ferry just and a ferry generous re∣mark look you Oh 'tis an angel a fallen one to be sure put when her peholds hur poor Ap Hugh pecomes plind to hur errors and pack slidings look you and can see nothing put hur charms and fifacities  AIR  Were patience kind to me  Oh he de nos  Far plyther than a coat I'd be  Oh he de nos  Leap skip and pound would poor Ap Hugh  And capriole and caper too  And frisk and jump and dance look you  Oh he de nos  But patience very cruel is  Oh he de nos  With jibes cheers and mockeries  Oh he de nos  Which makes to sigh and sob Ap Hugh  And whining his sad fortune rue  And crieve and croan and crunt look you  Oh he de nos  SCENE II  Rupee English  Rup  Thus have I an extempore Comedy in my house nature not only supplying me with matter but scenes and decorations and here comes a principal cha∣racter an Englishman who traces his origin from the Saxon Heptarchy prodigal of pleasure as Henry the th with his mad associates and estimable as that exemplary prince after he had renounced his extravagancies Ha English the honour of a visit from you is as kind as it is unexpected  Eng  Why faith 'tis a satisfaction I should give my∣self oftner but our pursuits are different and why should we meet to disagreeI am bound by a singular though indulgent father  Rup  I know ithis dying injunctions were that you should never see London that you should dine four times a year with the vestry hang a stag's horns in your hall brew your own October and roast an ox at Christ∣mas Mine I thank him enjoin'd me no such con∣ducthe went abroadaccumulated a large fortunediedand left me to spend it  Eng  With which you purchase pleasure at the expence of happinesslast night for example  Rup  Oh I am with you but what mighty harm a nobleman's carriage breaks down in a quagmire occa∣sioned by the late floods and I invite my lord and his suite to my house  Eng  Yes and a stagecoach in about a quarter of an hour after breaks down in the same quagmire in which are a venerable old man and his lovely daughter whose appear∣ance being less splendid than my lord's they are left to shift for themselves  Rup  Oh they are safe at Seabright's my steward  Eng  No thanks to youI saw them there this morn∣ingthey are lately arrived from India and their busi∣ness it seems no less concerns you than themselves  Rup  And they have chosen you I suppose for their advocatetheir cause will have weight in such able hands Will you dine here Believe me I long to cultivate the closest intimacy with you  Eng  Try the test which life is the most rational and I accept this gage of friendshipI'll dine with you and you and your friends shall sup with me and if before we part you do not confess my conduct to be more reasonable than your's I'll change my ground and be∣come as errant a votary of dissipation as you or the mad∣dest of your adherents  Rup  A matchwhen am I to see this Indian queen  Eng  PresentlyAh RupeeI wish I could plead as successfully the cause of another  Rup  Whom  Eng  LucySeabright's charming daughter  Rup  What would you say of her Sir  Eng  That she is miserable and you have made her so that you have stolen her heart and I fear her honor  Rup  That's very well faith I did not expect thiswhat manare not you and I young highblooded will you make me believe while your companions have been beating the bushes of a morning you have never stolen away to the arms of some cherrycheeked farmer's daughter  Eng  Sir I am incapable of the crime you insinuate a true English sportsman holds his tenants comfort and security as inviolate as his own The chase ought to be for the destruction of beasts of prey and the extermination of vermin  AIR  When faintly gleams the doubtful day  Ere yet the dewdrops on the thorn  Borrow a lustre from the ray  That tips with gold the dancing corn  Health bids awake and homage pay  To him who gave another morn  And well with strength his nerves to brace  Urges the sportsman to the chase  II  "  The lines marked with inverted commas are to be omitted in the repre∣sentation  Do we pursue the timid hare  "As trembling o'er the lawn she bounds  "Still of her safety have we care  "While seeming death her steps surrounds  "We the defenceless creature spare  "And instant stop the well taught hounds  "For cruelty should ne'er disgrace  "The well earn'd pleasure of the chase  III  Return'd with shaggy spoils well stor'd  To our convivial joys at night  We toast and first our country's lord  Anxious who most shall do him right  The fair next crowns the social board  Britons should love as well as fight  For he who slights the tender race  Is held unworthy of the chase  SCENE III  Seabright's  house  Sir Ephraim  and  Seabright  Sir Eph  Why I never heard of such a devil of an ex∣travagant villain in my life  Sea  Indeed Sir Ephraim his excesses are without end  Sir Eph  Well well we must endeavour to cure them he believes me to be dead and his sister in India he has forgot her of course and as for me I have nothing to do but keep aloof till our plot is wrought to its height but what gives me the greatest pleasure in this business is that the son of my old friend Hengist English will join our designs against my son I remember his father and I talked of him and my Aurelia when they were little ones I should not be sorry to revive the idea  Sea  You could not choose a worthier soninlaw he is the idol of the county  Sir Eph  Well well we'll make my boy the idol of the county too We starched old fellows Seabright don't give latitude enough to the fiery feelings and tow∣ering spirits of a mettled young dog like him consider his princely fortune his elegant connections  Sea  These Sir are so many mirrors for mens ac∣tions which will reflect nothing as a beauty but what has a tendency to honour  Sir Eph  And I hope there are a great many such ten∣dencies in my Ephraim what has he done accuse him of something has he neglected to relieve indigent me∣rit has he pitifully sold his principles for the smiles of power has he seduced the wife or daughter of his friend  Sea  Daughter of his friend Sir  Sir Eph  AyI'd never forgive that  Sea  Sir it's very hard  Sir Eph  'Tis very severe judging but if you know any thing speak out  Sea  What a question Miss Aurelia Sirgood heaven  goes off  SCENE IV    Aurelia Lucy  Sir Eph  Oh Aurelia well but Seabrighthow gonehe has left me very abruptly methinksafraid of offending I supposethat's nonsense he might have said what he pleased  Aurelia  comes on followed by two or three  Lascars  one car∣rying a monkey another a maccaw  c  AIR  Here I am  With my ching wham wham  Gay splendid and dazzling pronounce me  While chang whang whang  As their citrons they twang  My slaves and attendants announce me  Lascars with their tymbals  Go thrum thrum thrum  And give the alarm by their drumming  While females their cymbals  Go strum strum strum  Proclaiming her title that's coming Here I am  c  At length the mutes  With their dulcet flutes  So sweetly join the cymbals strum  And qualify the tymbals thrum  'Till having stunn'd the listening ears  With whing chang chang  And ching whang whang  At length the motley train appears Here I am  c  Sir Eph  You are in fine spirits this morning Aurelia you'll never forget the sprightly wildness of the east I wish I could see your companion half so merry  Aur  Oh lord Sir you'll get nothing from her but sighs  Sir Eph  I have observed it and if I mistake not di∣vined the cause too 'twas a wicked Sylvan to steal so tender a hearthey Lucywell well don't blush but come tell me daughters judge more charitably of young fellows than fathers what do you think of my son  Lucy  Think of him Sir  Sir Eph  Ay ay is he not an elegant fine young fellow  Lucy  I believe there is no doubt of that Sir  Sir Eph  And now as to his vices and follies as they are called  Lucy  Dear Sir how should I  Sir Eph  I beg your pardon you young girls make shrewd remarksI have had hints  Lucy  Hints Sir  Sir Eph  Ay hints in short do you believe him capable of a premeditated dishonourable action  Lucy  Oh  cries  Aur  She's crying ready to break her heart Sir  Sir Eph  Heyday what's all this  Aur  My dear Lucy an't you well  Lucy  I beg your pardon ma'am I am lately so lowspirited and so little fit for company  Sir Eph  Why really Lucy this is very unaccountable I have noticed a sort of coolness between you and your father but it looked rather like unhappiness than anger let me intercede You know Lucy you are my goddaughter and should consider me as a second father come come be chearful  Lucy  Sir I am obliged to you for your advice but the best precepts are thrown away upon an impractica∣ble subject you add to my griefs by bringing them to my recollection but when the thorn of affliction rankles in the heart busy remembrance may irritate but con∣not extract it  AIR  Who to my wounds a balm advises  But little knows what I endure  The patient's pain to torture rises  When medicine's try'd and fails to cure  What can the wisest council teach me  But sad remembrance of my grief  Alas your kindness cannot reach me  It gives but wordsI ask relief  SCENE V    Sir Ephraim Aurelia  Sir Eph  Old Seabright surely gets crabbed and pee∣vish how can this poor girl have offended him  Aur  My dear papa that's not her grief  Sir Eph  What is then  Aur  One I fancy you would not be very fond of curing  Sir Eph  What do you mean  Aur  I mean that after so much anxiety for a beloved son you would hardly consent that he should throw him∣self away upon your steward's daughter  Sir Eph  Phoo phoononsenseimpossible  Aur  Then my dear Sir you have no observation didn't you perceive her sensible confusion whenever you spoke of him didn't she sigh faulter tremble and hesitate and then burst out a crying  Sir Eph  Yes 'tis very true her father too was ter∣ribly shocked  Aur  And I should not wonder if it was a scheme be∣tween themAs to the lady she is so soft and sentimental  Sir Eph  And so was the papa he had his tenden∣cies and his mirrors and his afflictions we must think of this  SCENE VI    Sir Ephraim Aurelia English  Eng  Sir Ephraim you must disappear from hence as fast as can unless you wish your son to see you for here he comes in full sail  Sir Eph  In full sail indeed why zounds he and his company look like a troop of BacchanalsAh I'll make one in their pious orgies before long  SCENE VII  English Aurelia Rupee  Rup  Speaking behind  Fidget shew his lordship the avenue leading to the Park and I'll wait for you here  Eng  Rupee I have the pleasure to introduce to you a fair supplicant whose story you will find singular and interesting you are also concern'd in it  Rup  How so  Aur  I'll tell you sirMy father acquir'd a consi∣derable fortune which my brother squanders away in loose and idle pleasuresIn his affairs your's are closely involved the wealth of both having sprung from the same source  Rup  Very likely I have extensive India connectionsHis name pray  Aur  You will hear it from my father sir at present I require your speedy interference in this business left it come too late  Rup  Why too late  Aur  His excessive dissipation and blind partiality for disreputable and worthless objects may leave him without the means of assisting me or himself  Rup  A sad fellow this same brother of your's ma'am  Eng  One would think she was describing you Rupee  Rup  Oh yes I dare say I shall get just such another sermon from my sister when she arrivesWhat he is incorrigible is he ma'am  Aur  As much so as vanity affluence and intercourse with knaves and flatterers can make him besides I fear we shall be too late on another account  Rup  Ay what's that  Aur  There was a rumor as I came over that your title to your fortune is very equivocal  Rup  Indeed  With indifference  Aur  Nay I have seen a gentleman who means to lay claim to it  Eng  Faith Rupee this seems to be a serious business  Rup  Not at allWe Nabobs according to rumor hold our fortunes at the pleasure of the public but while we keep unaccounted thousands for sops to an enquiring Cerberus he may growl but in the end he'll be sure to fawn and let us pass  SCENE VIII  Rupee English Aurelia Lord Lofty  Lord L  Upon my consequence 'tis a shame you should have this trio so long to yourselvesby my dis∣tinction she is a lovely creatureRupee  Rup  My lord  Lord L  This girl's come to you about disagreeable business  Rup  She is my lord  Lord L  I am in love with her I'll take her off your hands  Rup  A gallant proposal  Lord L  O lord tis nothing at all for me I always catch them on the wingat first sighthapop down they come  Rup  Bravo  Lord L  But perhaps ma'am I can't tempt youyouth a fine figure talents white teeth an earldom and fifty thousand a year won't be worth your acceptanceHey Rupee  Aur  Sir shall I beg you'll see me to my father  Lord L  By my title it must not bemy dear ma'am it will kill me stretch me by my condition I shall ex∣pire with grief  Rup  Don't be uneasy my lord you'll see the lady again  Lord L  Hartshorn to my fainting fancy or may I die a plebeian you'll leave hope with me at least ma'am  AIR  Aur  Ne'er yet did lover  Hope discover  'Till won by sighs and wishes tender  To reward him  We accord him  That presage of our hearts surrender  Hope's the reward of faithful hearts  Herald of every joy propitious  The course on which the lover starts  Eager to reach that goal he wishes  When you a lover's title prove  So kind so truewell pleas'd to greet you  This hope the harbinger of love  With winning smiles shall haste to meet you  SCENE IX  Lord Lofty Rupee Nettle Fidget Hairbrain  other Company and  English  who returns after having gone off with  Aurelia  Lord L  An angel or may I die without heirs  Fid  coming on  Upon my soul Nettle you use his lo  dship very scurvily what can be more noble than to be as I may say the sun of generosity to the world of science  Net  Or rather the moon for 'tis but a borrowed light  Fid  No 'tis you are the moon for all the light you give is by reflection  Rup  Well said Fidget  Lord L  Oh let Nettle alone I know him of old his head is like the Denaides with their sieves always overflowing and always empty  Net  Something like your taste then my Lordhow often have I seen you sit with rapture to see a fellow mincing along like a figure cut out in spermaceti per∣sonating  Julius Caesar or Marc Antony and giving command to an army or laws to an empire in the tone of a bullfinch or a child's threepenny whistle  Rup  Faith Nettle I so far join you in this last re∣mark that I would rather hear my friend English sing the old plaintive song of Jack Ratling in his manner than the finest warbling the HayMarket can afford us  Lord L  Perhaps the gentleman will favour us with it  Eng  With great pleasure my Lord  AIR  Jack Ratlin was the ablest seaman  None like him could hand reef and steer  No dangerous toil but he'd encounter  With skill and in contempt of fear  In fight a lion the battle ended  Meek as the bleating lamb he'd prove  Thus Jack had manners courage merit  Yet did he sighand all for love  II  The song the jest the flowing liquor  For none of these had Jack regard  He while his messmates were carousing  High sitting on the pendant yard  Would think upon his fair one's beauties  Swear never from such charms to rove  That truly he'd adore them living  And dyingsighto end his love  III  The same express the crew commanded  Once more to view their native land  Among the rest brought Jack some tidings  Would it had been his love's fair hand  Oh fateher death defac'd the letter  Instant his pulse forgot to move  With quiv'ring lips and eyes uplifted  He heav'd a sighand dy'd for love  All  Bravo  Rup  Ay ay while you have such goods as these you need not go to foreign markets  Hair  Rupee yonder comes Ap Hugh we have been teazing him to death till the poor Welshman's like a horse in the pillars he neither stands nor goes  Rup  Here he comes what shall we say to him  Hair  The comicalest notion alive let us send him to Coventry  Rup  Well thought of will you join him my lord  Lord L  Oh I'll be as errant a schoolboy as the best of you  SCEN X  To them  Ap Hugh  Ap Hugh  Saaf you saaf you coot peopleI be∣lieve I have some favours and obligations and first of all Mr Nettle what is the reason  Net  Goats and monkeys  turning away from him  Ap Hugh  Yes it is ferry pretty monkeys you are inteed and it is ferry pretty chipes and cheres but I counsel and warn you Ah Mr English I pray you  Eng  looking him full in the face  Oh he de nos  Ap Hugh  Odds my cholers and my passions is hur to be be played a pass and moreover a scurvy trick but all is oneMr Rupee I too tesire  Rup  speaking to Lord Lofty  you say very true my lord the passions of Welchmen are like mad bleak they swim upon the surface but nothing can sink them to the level of reason  Ap Hugh  A mad pleak is hur a fish or a bleak or a trout if hur is a trout I can tell you you do not go the way to tickle her My deer Patience I too be∣seech you  Pat  Mr Rupee don't you remember one Ap Hugh we had with us  Rup  Yes he fell in love with you  Hair  Yes poor fellow I first slighted him and he first went mad and then hanged himself  Ap Hugh  Hur believes hur shall co mad inteed  Fid  I cannot bear to see him so unhappy they have sent you to Coventry Ap Hugh'twas all Nettle's doings  Ap Hugh  I do not tout it and if I was to sent him to the tiffels and belzebubs he would be only among his relations  Serv  Sir dinner's served  Rup  Come gentlemen first for the dinner and then for the Burgundy  All  Bravo  CHORUS  What if my pleasures fools condemn  Because I am not dull like them  Because no minute I let pass  Unmarked by a convivial glass  Or else returned from strife and noise  I tempt the fair to softer joys  A mortal with a soul divine  Alternate crown'd with love and wine  II  These shall on earth my being share  And when I'm gone if in my heir  My spirit live let him not mourn  But see emboss'd upon my urn  Bacchus and Venus in a wreath  With this inscription underneath  "This mortal had a soul divine  "Alternate crown'd with love and wine"  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A Shrubbery  Patience English  Pat  ENGLISH seems to have got hold of this business pretty wellI remember old Ratsbane was the lawyer fellow well enough and if he really has joc∣key'd Rupee so much the better for Lucy  Png  Well Hairbrain do you think we shall be a match for Rupee  Pat  What about Lucyay ay  Eng  Well I am glad to find you are so confident of success  Pat  Confident cometo speak in your sporting wayI'll bett you five hundred to fifty that if that young filly is but guided by me tho' he jockey'd her across the flat and run away from the ditch she catches him at the turn of the lands and wins the race in a canter  Eng  Thou art a generous girl  Pat  Why as to that I was accessary to Lucy's mis∣fortunes and I should give but a bad sample of my promis'd Reformation if I did not assist to get her out of thembesides this is not half the mischief on footthere's a pretty deep stake to play with my lord he has  his plots toothere are more folks to be ruin'd I can tell you if matters could be brought to bear but no nothat won't dothere's misery enough in the world without his assistance  Eng  You have some excellent sentiments 'tis a pity you could not be brought to a little reformation  Pat  Why to tell you the truth I am not without hope that when Ap Hugh finds I rigidly pursue the re∣form I have planned he may be wrought on to make in the language of the world an honest woman and then should fortune bless me with a daughter the care of her morals should be an atonement for the neglect of mine  Eng  Nobly resolv'd  AIR  LUCY  Oh transports beyond measure  Oh exstacy of pleasure  What unknown joys possess me  The world will now confess me  That honor'd happy thing a wife  Should unexpected crosses  Misfortunes breed and losses  My husband's cares to soften  I'll tenderly and often  With kisses banish every strife  Thus I'll discharge so duly  So constantly so truly  So well my duty's promise  That pain and care far from us  Sweet shall be our cup of life  SCENE II  ENGLISH AURELIA  Eng  My dear Aurelia a thousand impertinent things have maliciously prevented me from paying my devoirs to you however 'twill not be difficult to woo you we are both children of nature  Aur  Ay but where's my oriental splendor that lan∣guid happiness that sickening delight which from its excess of luxury was at once both pleasure and satiety  Eng  In these arms what Nabob can boast so extensive an empire as my heart or slave so perfect an obedience to your willThen for amusement I'll turn you out a deer shall keep his hunters at bay like the subtil pard and if you wish to lounge in litters and palanquins I have ploughmen as agile as Lascars and horses as strong as elephants  Aur  Charmingyou are not a bit like an Indian galantI'll describe one to youHe comes out with an anticipated consumption holds a timorous command escapes assassination by miracle gets hated abroad cen∣sured at homemarries and dies of a catalogue of un∣titled diseases  Eng  What a descriptionthank fortune then who reserved me for you  Aur  Upon my wordI don't know that I shall marry you Aproposnow I think of it I am offended with youhow came you to conceal all this fine busi∣ness of Miss Lucy from me  Eng  I my dear Aurelia  Aur  Oh no not you you know nothing of her in∣tention to cheat my brother first of his senses and then of his fortune but I would have you for your own sake take care how you tamper in this business for in my mind he who abets the brother's folly can have but little regard for the sister's happiness  Eng  But Aurelia  Aur  Nay it is the same thing to me it shall be either peace or war India or Englishsay but the word  AIR  Prepar'd each army in its way  Would you hostilities should cease  Do you the olive branch display  I'll smoke the calimut of peace  But if in arms we must be found  Haste to the field and let us see  If your trumpet or my warhoop's sound  Can loudest cryto victory  SCENE III  English Lucy  Eng  So so now must I make an enemy of either my mistress or my honorto affront the latter might be to lose both and as our mistresses are often offended and pleased they know not why I'll e'en keep my ho∣nor which I am sure will never be out of humour with me unless I deserve it  Lucy  I beg your pardon I thought Miss Rupee had been here  Eng  She is this instant gone and in a perfect pet I can tell you at my entering the lists as your champion  Lucy  How SirI don't understand you  Eng  My dear Lucy I wou'd be cautious of offend∣ing your gentless and delicacy but 'tis necessary I should speak outIn a word I have consulted your father on the subject of Rupee's treachery towards you who but for my persuasions would have carried his resentment to a length more becoming the honest feelings of a man then the wary prudence of a peasantI appeased him however and am I think now by the help of one of Rupee's engines on the eve of such a discovery as must be of service to us  Lucy  I fear Sir you know not what you under∣take  Eng  Yes yes I dotake courage Lucyyou'll be happier and then in the words of my favourite song you shall pardon the treason for the sake of the traitor  Lucy  Ah that songhow often have I sung it and wept  Eng  Then sing it now and rejoice that the disagree∣able part of it is past and all that's pleasurable in it to come  AIR  LUCY  When faries are lighted by night's silver queen  And feast in the meadow or dance on the green  My Lumkin aside lays his plough and his flail  By yon oak to sit near me and tell his fond tale  And tho' I'm assur'd the same vows were believ'd  By Patty and Ruth he forsook and deceiv'd  Yet so sweet are his words and like truth so appear  I pardon the treason the traytor's so near  II  I saw the straw bonnet he bought at the fair  The rosecolour'd ribbons to deck Jenny's hair  The shoetyes of Bridget and still worse than this  The gloves he gave Peggy for stealing a kiss  All these did I see and with heartrending pain  Swore to part yet I know when I see him again  His words and his looks will like truth so appear  I shall pardon the treason the traytor's so dear  SCENE III  English Rupee  Rup  EnglishIf I had not the greatest regard for you I should laugh in your face  Eng  Indeed'tis lucky then your friendship shields me from your ridicule Why so much mirth pray  Rup  NothingYour fine Indian adventurer has con∣sented to an elopement with my lord that's all  Eng  For shame Mr Rupee the lady in question is a woman of honor  Rup  I tell you she is an errant town bite and but that the title and fortune of his lordship are more splendid than your's she would have tricked you as compleatly as she means to gull him  Eng  I cannot bear it Mr Rupeeyou know not who you abusebut I will not reproach you you'll endure enough before you sleep your LibertyHall is convulsed to the very center Sir it totters over your head  Rup  Indeed and did your woman of honour tell you that too  Eng  Both her and her fatherhe who has a better right here than you have  Rup  Oh oh oh I shall never have done laugh∣ingher father  Eng  Yes Sir before many hours are over your head you will confess yourself a dependant on his very bounty  Rup  Why zounds man I possess my fortune by my father's will  Eng  I know itbut there was one material circum∣stance omitted which alone could give you a title to ithe forgot to die  aside  Rup  So they have told you and I dare say under the influence of your oriental empress you believe itHowever to snatch you at once from your infatuation I am going to lend Lord Lofty my coach and five thou∣sand pounds to accelerate his project  SCENE V    English Patience Nettle Fidget Ap Hugh  Eng  Lend him five thousand pounds that must be preventedbut what does he mean by an elopementoh I see itHairbrain's deep stake I'll bett a thou∣sand  Hair  And I'll go your halvesI have made an ap∣pointment in the Indian gentlewoman's name where his Lordship may kick his heels long enough to no pur∣pose  Eng  Excellentwell what success  Hair  What with the old pettifogger all bank as good a licence as ever started from Doctors Commons  Eng  And he'll come  Hair  Who the lawyer why he's to get something by it is not he  Eng  Now for Rupee's probation'twill be severe but 'tis necessary he must smart to be curedthank Heaven his affairs are retrievablea spendthrift in his career is like the racer on which he betts his money  AIR  See the course throng'd with gazers the sports are begun  The confusion but hear I'll bett youdonedone  Ten thousand strange murmurs resound far and near  Lords hawkers and jockies assail the tir'd ear  While with neck like a rainbow erecting his crest  Pamper'd prancing and pleas'dhis head touching his breast  Scarcely snuffing the air he's so proud and elate  The high mettl'd racerfirst starts for the plate  II  The second and third Stanzas omitted in the Representation  Now reynard's turn'd out and o'er hedge and ditch rush  Hounds horses and huntsmen all hard at his brush  They run him at length and they have him at bay  And by scent and by view cheat a long tedious way  While alike born for sports of the field or the course  Always sure to come thorough a staunch and fleet horse  When fairly run down the fox yields up his breath  The high mettled raceris in at the death  III  Grown aged us'd up and turn'd out of the stud  Lame spavin'd and windgall'd but yet with some blood  While knowing postilions his pedigree trace  Tell his dam won the sweepstakes his father that race  And what matches he run to the ostlers count o'er  As they loiter their time at some hedge alehouse door  While the harness sore galls and the spurs his

unwilling one but it proceeds from the purest esteemI shall touch you home but you ought to thank mehe who has the courage to wring his friend's heart merits more from him than he who flat∣ters his

your two dearest relations out of your house to make room for a stranger to whom you have lent your service your coach and your money to seduce your own sister  Sir Eph  Because forsooth this stranger happened to be a lord and those are the hopeful idols you have wor∣shipped in your temple of Liberty  Rup  I resign it with pleasure SirThis day has convinced me that freedom is no longer the gift of Hea∣ven when it degenerates into licentiousness and that a work began in the Temple of Liberty is best sanctified when finished in the mansion of content  AIR  Lucy  No longer slowconsuming care  And grief by turns devour me  My heart's grown light I tread on air  Delicious joys o'erpow'r me  Cho  No low'ring clouds shall overwhelm  Henceforth our hopes on folly's sea  For wary prudence takes the helm  To guide the bark of Liberty  Eng  Increasing blessings may ye prove  For nobly hast thou won her  They only pay the price of love  Who purchase it with honor  Cho  No low'ring c  Aur  Like this good creature prithee say  Was ever such another  Oh that the sister's love could pay  Thy friendship to the brother  THE END
