 THE TEARS OF GENIUS  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  THE TEARS OF GENIUS  Occasioned by the DEATH of DR GOLDSMITH  BY COURTNEY MELMOTH  LONDON Printed for T BECKET Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand MDCCLXXIV  TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS  SIR  THE veneration I bear to the memory of Doctor Goldsmith has drawn me into the present publication and the sentiments of affection to be found in his Dedication of the DESERTED VILLAGE have induced me to inscribe  this  Elegy to Sir Joshua Reynolds who will naturally receive with kindness whatever is designed as a testimony of justice to a Friend that is no more  In contemplating the death of this excellent man and admirable poet I have been led to contemplate likewise the fate of others for within a very few years our literary losses have been fatally multiplied and many of the most valuable members have been suddenly lopped off from science and society In pursuit of this undertaking where the same pathetic subject was to be considered to the end I resolved to set out upon an irregular principle that without enchaining myself to any critical uniformity I might have scope and latitude for whatever varieties of versification should fall in my way  As I was to deplore the loss of different writers each of which possessed very strongly a marking originality I thought it best to write a sort of Epitaph upon each accordingly the following Verses are intended as so many separate Imitations of the style and manner of the Authors which they commemorate  That the occasion which produced the Elegy might not lose the strength of the impression by delayfor alas the traces of sorrow for the loss of the learned are soon worn out by the tumults of lifeI hurried the composition to the press the moment I could withdraw my hand from the manuscript the whole of which was begun and finished within a few hours after the news reached me that Dr Goldsmith was dead  But I beg Sir you will excuse the length of this Address and believe me to be  Your sincere admirer and most obedient servant COURTNEY MELMOTH  April th  THE TEARS OF GENIUS  THE villagebell tolls out the note of death  And thro' the echoing air the length'ning sound  With dreadful pause reverberating deep  Spreads the sad tydings o'er fair Auburn's vale  There to enjoy the scenes her bard had prais'd  In all the sweet simplicity of song  GENIUS in pilgrim garb sequester'd sat  And herded jocund with the harmless swains  But when she heard the fateforeboding knell  With startled step precipitate and swift  And look pathetic full of dire presage  The churchway walk beside the neighb'ring green  Sorrowing she sought and there in black array  Borne on the shoulders of the swains he lov'd  She saw the boast of Auburn mov'd along  Touch'd at the view her pensive breast she struck  And to the cypress which incumbent hangs  With leaning slope and branch irregular  O'er the moss'd pillars of the sacred fane  The briarbound graves shadowing with funeral gloom  Forlorn she hied And there the crowding woe  Swell'd by the parent press'd on bleeding thought  Big ran the drops from her maternal eye  Fast broke the bosomsorrow from her heart  And pale Distress sat sickly on her cheek  As thus her plaintive Elegy began  And must my children all expire  Shall none be left to strike the lyre  Courts Death alone a learned prize  Falls his shafts only on the wise  Can no fit marks on earth be found  From useless thousands swarming round  What crowding cyphers cram the land  What hosts of victims at command  Yet shall th' Ingenious drop alone  Shall Science grace the tyrant's throne  Thou murd'rer of the tuneful train  I charge thee with my children slain  Scarce has the Sun thrice urg'd his annual tour  Since half my race have felt thy barbarous power  Sore hast thou thinn'd each pleasing art  And struck a muse with every dart  Bard after bard obey'd thy slaughtering call  Till scarce a poet lives to sing a brother's fall  Then let a widow'd mother pay  The tribute of a parting lay  Tearful inscribe the monumental strain  And speak aloud her feelings and her pain  And first farewel to thee my son she cried  Thou pride of Auburn's Dalesweet bard farewel  Long for thy sake the peasants tear shall flow  And many a virginbosom heave with woe  For thee shall sorrow sadden all the scene  And every pastime perish on the green  The sturdy farmer shall suspend his tale  The woodman's ballad shall no more regale  No more shall Mirth each rustic sport inspire  I ut every frolic every feat shall tire  No more the evening gambol shall delight  Nor moonshine revels crown the vacant night  But groupes of villagers each joy forgot  Shall form a sad assembly round the cot  Sweet bard fareweland farewel Auburn's bliss  The bashful lover and the yielded kiss  The evening warble Philomela made  The echoing forest and the whispering shade  The winding brook the bleat of brute content  And the blithe voice that "whistled as it went"  These shall no longer charm the plowman's care  But sighs shall fill the pauses of despair  GOLDSMITH adieu the "booklearn'd priest" for thee  Shall now in vain possess his festive glee  The oftheard jest in vain he shall reveal  For now alas the jest he cannot feel  But ruddy damsels o'er thy tomb shall bend  And conscious weep for their and virtue's friend  The milkmaid shall reject the shepherd's song  And cease to carol as she toils along  All Auburn shall bewail the fatal day  When from her fields their pride was snatch'd away  And even the matron of the cressy lake  In piteous plight her palsied head shall shake  While all adown the furrows of her face  Slow shall the lingering tears each other trace  And Oh my child severer woes remain  To all the houseless and unshelter'd train  Thy fate shall sadden many an humble guest  And heap fresh anguish on the beggar's breast  For dear wert thou to all the sons of pain  To all that wander sorrow or complain  Dear to the learned to the simple dear  For daily blessings mark'd thy virtuous year  The rich receiv'd a moral from thy head  And from thy heart the stranger found a bed  Distress came always smiling from thy door  For God had made thee agent to the poor  Had form'd thy feelings on the noblest plan  To grace at once the Poet and the Man  Here GENIUS paus'd to dry the gathering tear  Which Nature started in her matron eye  She paus'd an instant then the strain renew'd  THEE too thou favourite of the moral strain  Pathetic GRAY for thee does GENIUS mourn  Science and Taste thy early fate shall plain  And Virtue drop a tear into thy urn  Oft as Night's curtain closes on the day  And twilight robes the clouds in duskier hue  A lovelone visit to thy tomb I pay  While all the parent trembles at the view  For how to the unconscious worm a prey  So dear a child as thee can I resign  Ah how can GENIUS e'er forget her GRAY  Poet of Nature all my powers were thine  On thy blest name with melted heart I dwell  Some kindred drops a loss like thine demands  Thou who could once for others wail so well  Now take THY tribute from a mother's hands  Tho' the grav'd tomb and cloud aspiring bust  To Cam's clear margin call not back thy breath  Yet shall fair Fame immortalize thy dust  And GENIUS snatch thee from the realms of death  Oft as I reach the spot where thou art laid  Thou whose bright sense could boast "celestial fire"  Those hands I cry the Muses scepter sway'd  "And wak'd to extacy the living lyre"  One morn I miss'd thee from the favourite tree  And anxious search'd the brook the lawn the grove  Another came but ah it was not thee  Oh the keen tortures of a parent's love  Next thro' the sculptur'd porch I saw thee borne  In slow procession by the sable train  I saw thy corpse entomb'd beneath the thorn  And o'er thy ashes sigh'd this funeral strain  EPITAPH  Here low in dust a son of Science lies  By fame distinguished and to Genius dear  Forgive the fault ye cynically wise  If on his grave the parent sheds a tear  Long shall the Muses mourn their pensive friend  Long shall a mother's bosom throb with woe  O'er his lov'd tomb the duteous swains shall bend  And Albion's daughters long bewail the blow  Now sighing stopt again the querulous power  And ruminated thoughtfulo'er the turf  Swell'd into mountains by the mingled dead  She cast a serious eyeand now the Hours  The lightwing'd messengers of hoary Time  Brought on the sable zenith of the night  Cloudless and incompos'd by gale or shower  Save that the Zephir rising from the south  Rustled the light leaf of the spreading beech  Far thro' the caerule air th' illumin'd moon  Her faint ray flung upon the shadowy earth  Struck by the scene Imagination turn'd  Reflective on a loss still more severe  A loss that all the Muses mourn at once  The cheek of GENIUS stream'd with warmer tears  Deepen'd the searching sigh and throbb'd the heart  As thus at length the bursting grief found way  Child of my heartthou matchless soul of Song  Guide of fair truth and leading star of fame  Etherial in thy talents as thy mind  Wise as all wisdom here below could be  Sublimely tuneful but not more sublime  Than delicatenor more refin'd than good  For Virtue ever brighten'd in thy lay  And beam'd fresh graces thro' thy ardent song  A song that dar'd a flight above the spheres  Caelestially ambitious Heaveninspir'd  Thy hopes angelic and thy theme a God  Thou Muses miraclethou Nation's pride  Whose worth yon silver Queen of night proclaim'd  When thou her pitying sympathy address'd  Whose wisdom all our sages loudly praise  Sages of science by deep thought made sage  Whose Virtue Immortality rewards  Whose GENIUS scorning narrow human ken  And the pent limits of this pigmy world  Where in a circle circumscrib'd by fate  The moleey'd mortal dimly gazes round  And boasts his deep sagacity of sight  Important emmetprideelated mite  Infinite atommomentary worm  Superior soars to scenes behind the cloud  Oh YOUNGthou daybright poet of the night  Accept sincere the genuine plaint of woe  Maternalstruck immediate from the heart  An heart that labours deep with various grief  And thou Oh Cynthiathou who lent thine aid  Caerulian and shed thy influence round  Chearing the darkness of thy Poet's fate  A fate envelop'd deep in Fortune's gloom  Dark beyond all the horrors of the night  When intercepting clouds repel thy rays  And not a gleam softens the black opaque  Dark beyond common woesdeathdark distress  Ebon of soul more sabled than the Styx  As once HIS anguish thou with influence bland  Benign didst seelnow kindly feel for me  For mesad relict of a prostrate race  Partake a wretched parent's soulheav'd throb  A parent rest of every filial joy  And smote by death's most desolating dart  Beneath thy sober sublunary shine  Tremulous tender melancholysoft  Suited to soothe the solitary woe  Beneath thy shinene'er did a greater Bard  Latian Athenian or in Briton born  Pour on the ear of night a lovelier song  Ne'er didst thou patronize a nobler lay  Nor hear a strain more pensively divine  Fair in distress and querulously sweet  Oh how the Poet breath'd at every pause  Oh how the Godhead dignified each line  Oh how the intrepid Christian crown'd the whole  'Twas not the courtly period of the day  Form'd to entrap the complimented fool  'Twas not the airy fashionable page  Politely pert and musically dull  The singsong nothing of some moonstruck elf  'Twas Genius spoke the language of the soul  A language losty elegant and strong  Pathos of sense and energy of sound  Beyond the common flight of modern song  Beyond the tinsel of the rhimeing tribe  Which for the flimsy Sonnet cull the flowers  Parnassian scarce deserving to be cropt  The stinted scyons of the mountain's foot  To deck their Mayday garland of an hour  Beyond the soar of sentimental fools  That delicately weave the web of wit  And spin the silken moral from the brain  Industriously idlecobwebthin  The tender texture of a vacant skull  And unsubstantial as the fairy scene  Form'd by the frolicks of the fallen snow  Far above such THY vigorous Genius soar'd  Genius cherubicnear allied to Heaven  Of heavenly themes ambitiousOh my Son  Oh what a stroke upon the feeling heart  Oh what a fall to Britain and to me  And rises then my sorrow into guilt  Verges my fondness on impiety  Reason religion duty all forgot  I almost mingle blushes with my woe  Confusion flings her crimson in my cheek  And colouring Conscience dyes a deeper red  Fall did I saysay rather what a rise  A rise highbounding to his native skies  How great how vast how glorious how profound  To  us  how vitalto  himself  how fair  He wish'd for Heav'n and Heav'n has heard his prayer  Then let me hail his beatific shade  The wellrewarded spirit bower'd in bliss  Yet Nature feeble Nature clinging to the chords  And pressing hard upon the tender strings  That move the finer feelings in our frame  With arbitrary rage demands her claim  And usurerlike exacts the parentsigh  Spite of the exultations I should feel  The hymn of triumph and the peal of praise  The tender tyrant tugs about my Breast  Strikes on each pulse and sluices every vein  Ah rebel nerves be stillor if too hard  The thoughts of losing HIM the most ador'd  Bears on thy weaker senseindulge a pause  From NaturePassionTorture and Thyself  Oh turn my soul from the distracting theme  Probe not the agonizing wound too deep  Search not the sore with too minute an eye  But from his dear idea turn away  She turn'dshe stoptbut found no sweet relief  The cormorant monster of the gorging grave  Had multiplied her woestill ran her thoughts  On some lov'd child which yet remain'd unsung  Another and another to her mind  Rose terribleand starting thus she cried  While Grief in every feature wrote Despair  And shall I pass thee o'er thou gentle spiritWas there ought in thy propensionsor in thy way of journeying through the windings of this sad worldWas there ought unfilial in thy feelingsought undeserving or forbidding that should incline me to overlook theeAh NonoTrust me gentle YORICK I more

thou art rank'd in my estimationEstimationhear me YORICK there is another Alas for theeThou can'st not hearGENIUS has much to say of theeThou wert nothing elseThy heart and head and every delicate appendage were the constant champions of all the Charitiesall the CivilitiesThou had'st not indeed any paradeany ostensibilityor religious prudery about theebut yet hast thou done more to the cause of Virtue than if thou hadst gone scowling through lifeIn all thy excursionsand whimsical meandersSENSIBILITY took thee by the handby the heart I might have saidand made thee accessible to every tender intreatyevery soft petition found its way into thy pocketthe thing was irresistablePITY seconded the request SYMPATHY thirded itand if thou haply hadst nothing to bestowwhy it was an hard case and would cost thee a teara drop of disappointmentan elixir to the sorrowing soula treasure rising from the  fulness of a rich heart and it was given without grudgingso would it had it been chrystalI honoured thy sentiments and I venerate thy memorythou would'st not suffer a nettle to grow upon the grave of an enemynor shall GENIUS ever suffer a weed to grow upon thinePeacepeace to thy shade  Once more the matron ceas'd the mournful lay  But the fresh anguish soon assail'd her heart  Still call'd the populous tomb for her lament  And bad her prove vicissitude of woe  As thus she sighing spoke  And now my lov'd Shenstone for Thee  Thou pride of the pastoral strain  Thou fairest resemblance of me  Dear elegant Bard of the plain  For thee will I pour the sad lay  That shall echo the thickets among  And weep as I muse on the day  That robb'd the poor swains of thy song  Full gentle and sweet was the note  That flow'd from his delicate heart  Simplicity smil'd as he wrote  And Nature was polish'd by art  But now as I look o'er thy bowers  As each shrub and each stream I survey  Disaster invades the soft flowers  Forohtheir lov'd master's away  Ah how should the woodlands be fair  Ah how the cool grottoes be gay  The groves murmur death and despair  The roses all droop and decay  Full well may they sorrow and fade  The dear shepherd that rear'd them is gone  And well may the birds leave the shade  For their loves and their labours are flown  Then unseen let the Eglantine blow  Unheeded the Hyacynth lye  Unheard let the rivulets flow  Let the Primroses flourish and die  For the Swain who should crop them is gone  He sungand all Nature admir'd  He spokeand all hearts were his own  He felland all pity expir'd  Scarce had she finish'd her disasterous song  When thus again lamenting she began  I  And oh she cried with frantic grief  Who now shall bring relief  Or where the cordial shall I find  To soothe a mother's mind  Since LYTTELTON is dead  Well may ye hang the head  And press your grassy bed  Ye conscious forests and ye waving groves  For never shall ye see your Master more  To other scenes the aetherial Spirit roves  And tir'd of Hagley seeks a fairer shore  II  The Muses listen'd to his polish'd strain  And every wondering swain  With pride came thronging to his rustic bower  The Dryads own'd his power  But when he wail'd his lovely Lucy dead  And his melodious sorrow told  The shepherds lean'd to hear  The silvans dropt a tear  Then all in wild disorder fled  Rapt in the deepest shades recess  They mourn'd their gentle Lord's distress  And join'd his prayers for Lucybut in vain  III  And art thou gone my venerable Son  Who shar'd with Genius the exalted throne  Pride of my age and pillar of my care  Mute is thy tuneful voice"O loss beyond repair"  Ah LYTTELTON for thee  The true tear long shall bathe this hoary breast  For there thy worth and talents live imprest  Engrav'd by SYMPATHY  Oh fall severely felt  To make a parent melt  The tender breast to tear  And wake despair  And scarce a child the mighty grief to share  IV  How shall I paint the glories of his mind  Benevolent and kind  His reason strong and elegantly clear  To every virtue dear  Beyond the pride of pedant rules  And maxims of the schools  His Genius knew the pleasing art  To steal upon the heart  To touch the finer passions of the mind  And give the sterling moral to mankind  V  He was the very glory of my race  Even in the vale of life in reason's bloom  Adorn'd with every learned grace  Amidst the shouts of power and praise  For many a year he wore the bays  Till tyrant Death  Stopt his muchhonour'd breath  And swept the laurel'd Hero to the tomb  So when some oak that long supreme hath stood  The stately monarch of the imperial wood  Whose arms superior shed a verdure round  And shadow'd wide beneath the umbrageous ground  Long time we view its top impierce the skies  Its broad leaf flourish and its branches rise  Long time we gaze upon the glowing sight  And eye with wonder its majestic height  Till time impatient for its destin'd prey  Full at the root directs the blow  And down it drops below  The mighty ruin of the groaning plain  Nor in lamenting the havock which Death hath triumphantly made continued GENIUS in the letter'd generation can HAWKESWORTH be forgotten A name which is particularly endear'd to me by the affection which its owner bore to virtue and to science  Every stroke of his pen corresponding with every idea of his mind however playful or however pathetic always terminated in the most useful knowledge that knowledge which might regulate the conduct of life or afford tranquillity and quietude at the hour of expiration The ardour which uniformly animated his endeavours gave constant vigour to his thought activity to his powers and dignity to his sentiment Nor did his excellence arise so much from the ambition which panted after fame and aim'd at popularitywhich appeal'd to the acclamations of the mob or sought the distinctions of this world as from the hearty hope of contributing in whatever degree to the investigation of truth the amendment of manners and the rectitude of the mind Of those who have acquir'd a literary immortality there are few who could dispute with my HAWKESWORTH strength of sense or elevation of expression and still fewer have given to the world so valuable or so copious a fund of virtuous entertainment Amidst all the efforts of his intellect whether his instructions were prepared in the dress of history or convey'd in the vehicle of fabulous narrationwhether they assum'd the graver style of argumentative profundity or whether they adopted the still deeper researches of philosophical raciocination their constant greatness of design was equally apparent  and the promotion of virtue was always strongly mark'd in the language of the writer My dear my regretted HAWKESWORTH was indeed never long seduc'd by any temptations or abstracted by any scientific allurements from those views which are alone of intrinsic importance and which he well knew would retain that importance when all that now flutters to the fancy plays upon the passions and fascinates the heart shall confess their insignificance and fly like the atom that is driven before the tempest  Here interrupting broke upon her plaint  The peering mornthe dundiscolour'd clouds  Dispersing fast unveil the fleecy white  Fair dawns the newbornday and o'er the sky  The ruddy crimson and the heavendipt blue  Mix'd with the fainter yellow's streaky gold  Chequering the air in rich variety  Fortell the Sun's uprisefrom his broad beam  Too garish for the melancholy mind  GENIUS withdrew and clos'd her tender lay  THE END
