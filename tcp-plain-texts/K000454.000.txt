 THE MEMOIRS OF AN English Officer Who serv'd in the  Dutch  War in to the Peace of  Utrecht  in  Containing  Several Remarkable TRANSACTIONS both by Sea and Land and in divers Coun∣tries but chiefly those wherein the Au∣thor was personally concern'd  Together with  A DESCRIPTION of many Cities Towns and Countries in which he resided their Man∣ners and Customs as well Religious as Civil interspers'd with many curious OBSERVATIONS on their Monasteries and Nunneries more par∣ticularly of the famous one at  Montserat  On the BULLFEASTS and other publick Diversions as also on the Genius of the  Spanish  People a∣mongst whom he continued several Years a Prisoner of War No Part of which has before been made publick  By Capt  GEORGE CARLETON  LONDON  Printed for E SYMON over against the Royal Exchange  Cornhill  MDCCXXVIII  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  Spencer  Lord  Wilmington  Knight of the  Bath  and one of his Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council  '  T  WAS my Fortune my Lord in my ju∣venile Years  Musas cum Marte commutare  and truly I have Reason to blush when I consider the small Advantage I have reap'd from that Change But lest  it should be imputed to my Want of Merit I have wrote these Memoirs and leave the World to judge of my Deserts They are not set forth by any fictitious Stories nor imbe∣lished with rhetorical Flou∣rishes plain Truth is certainly most becoming the Character of an old Soldier Yet let them be never so meritorious if not protected by some noble Patron some Persons may think them to be of no Value  To you therefore my Lord I present them to you who have so eminently dishinguish∣ed your self and whose Wis∣dom has been so conspicuous to the late Representatives of  Great Britain  that each re∣volving Age will speak in your Praise and if you vouchsafe to be the  Mecaenas  of these Memoirs your Name will give them sufficient San∣ction  An old Soldier I may truly call my self and my Family allows me the Title of a Gentleman yet I have seen many Favourites of Fortune without being able to discern why they should be so happy and my self so unfortunate but let not that discourage your Lordship from receiving these my Memoirs into your Patronage for the Unhappy cannot expect Favour but  from those who are endued with generous Souls  Give me Leave my Lord to congratulate this good For∣tune that neither Whig nor Tory in this complaining Age have found fault with your Conduct Your Fami∣ly has produced Heroes in defence of injured Kings and you when 'twas necessary have as nobly adher'd to the Cause of Liberty  My LORD  Your Lordship's Most obedient And most devoted Humble Servant G CARLETON  TO THE READER  THE Author of these Memoirs began early to distinguish himself in mar∣tial Affairs otherwise he could not have seen suck Variety of Actions both by Sea and Land After the last  Dutch  War he went into  Flanders  where he not only serv'd under the Command of his High∣ness the Prince of  Orange  whilst he was Generalissimo of the  Dutch  Forces but likewise all the time he reign'd King of  Great Britain  Most of the considerable Passages and Events which happened during that time are contained in the for∣mer Part of this Book  In the Year the Regiment in which he serv'd as Captain was order'd to embark for the  West Indies  and he having no In∣clination to go thither chang'd with an halfpay Captain and being recommended to the Earl of  Peterborow  by the late Lord  Cutts  went with him upon that noble Expedition into  Spain  When the Forces under his Lordship's Command were landed near  Barcelona  the Siege of that Place was thought by several impracticable not only for want of expe∣rienc'd  Engineers but that the Besieged were as numerous as the Besiegers yet the Courage of that brave Earl surmounted those Difficulties and the Siege was resolv'd upon  Our Author having obtain'd by his long Service some Knowledge of the practick Part of an Engineer and seeing at that cri∣tical Time the great Want of such readily acted as one which gave him the greater Opportunity of being an EyeWitness of his Lordship's Actions and consequently made him capable of setting them forth in these his Memoirs  It may not be perhaps improper to mention that the Author of these Memoirs was born at  Ewelme  in  Oxfordshire  descended from an ancient and an honourable Family The Lord  Dudley Carleton  who died Secretary of State to King  Charles I  was his Great Uncle and in the same Reign his Father was Envoy at the Court of  Madrid  whilst his Uncle Sir  Dudley Carleton  was Em∣bassador to the  States  of  Holland  Men in those Days respected both for their Abilities and Loyalty  MEMOIRS OF AN  English  Officer  c  I  N the Year one Thousand six Hundred seventy two War being proclaimed with  Hol∣land  it was looked upon among Nobility and Gentry as a Blemish not to attend the Duke of  York  aboard the Fleet who was then de∣clared Admiral With many others I at that Time about twenty Years of Age en∣ter'd my self a Voluntier on board the  London  commanded by Sir  Edward Sprage  ViceAdmiral of the  Red  THE Fleet set Sail from the  Buoy of the Nore  about the beginning of  May  in order to join the  French  Fleet then at Anchor in St  Hellen  's  Road  under the Command of  the  Count de Estrée  But in executing this Design we had a very narrow Escape For  De Ruyter  the Admiral of the  Dutch  Fleet having Notice of our Intentions waited to have intercepted us at the Mouth of the River but by the Assistance of a great Fog we pass'd  Dover  before he was aware of it and thus he miscarried with the poor Advantage of taking only one small Tender  A DAY or two after the joining of the  English  and  French  we sailed directly to∣wards the  Dutch  Coast where we soon got sight of their Fleet a Sand called the  Galloper  lying between The  Dutch  seem'd willing there to expect an Attack from us But in regard the  Charles  Man of War had been lost on those Sands the War before and that our Ships drawing more Water than those of the Enemy an Engagement might be render'd very disad∣vantagious it was resolv'd in a Council of War to avoid coming to a Battle for the present and to sail directly for  Solebay  which was accordingly put in Execution  WE had not been in  Solebay  above four or five Days when  De Ruyter  hearing of it made his Signal for sailing in order to surprize us and he had certainly had his Aim had there been any Breeze of Wind to favour him But though they made use of all their Sails there was so little Air stir∣ring  that we could see their Fleet making towards us long before they came up not∣withstanding which our Admirals found difficulty enough to form their Ships into a Line of Battle so as to be ready to receive the Enemy  English  and  Dutch  Fleets en∣gag'd in  Solebay  IT was about Four in the Morning of the th of  May  being  Tuesday  in  Whitson Week  when we first made the Discovery and about Eight the same Morning the Blue Squadron under the Command of the Earl of  Sandwich  began to engage with Admiral  Van Ghent  who command∣ed the  Amsterdam  Squadron and about Nine the whole Fleets were under a general Engagement The Fight lasted till Ten at Night and with equal Fury on all Sides the  French  excepted who appeared station∣ed there rather as Spectators than Parties and as unwilling to be too much upon the Offensive for fear of offending them∣selves  DURING the Fight the  English  Admi∣ral had two Ships disabled under him and was obliged about Four in the Afternoon to remove himself a third Time into the  London  where  remain'd all the rest of the Fight and till next Morning Never∣theless on his Entrance upon the  London  which was the Ship I was in and on our Hoisting the Standard  De Ruyter  and his Squadron seem'd to double their Fire upon  her as if they resolv'd to blow her out of the Water Notwithstanding all which the Duke of  York  remain'd all the time up∣on Quarter Deck and as the Bullets plenti∣fully whizz'd around him would often rub his Hands and cry  Sprage Sprage they follow us still  I am very sensible later Times have not been over favourable in their Sen∣timents of that unfortunate Prince's Valour yet I cannot omit the doing a Piece of Ju∣stice to his Memory in relating a Matter of Fact of which my own Eyes were Wit∣nesses and saying That if Intrepidity and Undauntedness may be reckon'd any Parts of Courage no Man in the Fleet better de∣serv'd the Title of Couragious or behav'd himself with more Gallantry than he did  THE  English  lost the  Royal James  commanded by the Earl of  Sandwich  which about Twelve after the strenuous Endeavours of her Sailors to disengage her from two  Dutch  Fire Ships plac'd on her one athwart her Hawsers the other on her Starboard Side took Fire blew up and perish'd and with her a great many brave Gentlemen as well as Sailors and amongst the rest the Earl himself concerning whom I shall further add that in my Passage from  Harwich  to the  Brill  a Year or two af∣ter the Master of the Pacquet Boat told me That having observ'd a great Flock of Gulls hovering in one particular Part of  the Sea he order'd his Boat to make up to it when discovering a Corpse the Sailors would have return'd it to the Sea as the Corpse of a  Dutch Man  but keeping it in his Boat it proved to be that of the Earl of  Sandwich  There was found about him between twenty and thirty Gui∣neas some Silver and his Gold Watch restoring which to his Lady she kept the Watch but rewarded their Honesty with all the Gold and Silver  THIS was the only Ship the  English  lost in this long Engagement For although the  Katherine  was taken and her Com∣mander Sir  John Chicheley  made Priso∣ner her Sailors soon after finding the Op∣portunity they had watch'd for seiz'd all the  Dutch  Sailors who had been put in upon them and brought the Ship back to our own Fleet together with all the  Dutch Men  Prisoners for which as they deserv'd they were well rewarded This is the same Ship which the Earl of  Mul∣grave  afterwards Duke of  Buckingham  commanded the next Sea Fight and has caus'd to be painted in his House in St  James  's  Park  I MUST not omit one very remark∣able Occurrence which happened in this Ship There was a Gentleman aboard her a Voluntier of a very fine Estate general∣ly known by the Name of  Hodge Vaughan  This Person receiv'd in the beginning of the Fight a considerable Wound which the great Confusion during the Battle would not give them leave to inquire into so he was carried out of the Way and dis∣posed of in the Hold They had some Hogs aboard which the Sailor under whose Care they were had neglected to feed these Hogs hungry as they were found out and fell upon the wounded Per∣son and between dead and alive eat him up to his very Scull which after the Fight was over and the Ship retaken as before was all that could be found of him  ANOTHER Thing less to be account∣ed for happen'd to a Gentleman Voluntier who was aboard the same Ship with my self He was of known personal Courage in the vulgar Notion of it his Sword ne∣ver having fail'd him in many private Duels But notwithstanding all his Land∣mettle it was observ'd of him at Sea that when ever the Bullets whizz'd over his Head or any way incommoded his Ears he immediately quitted the Deck and ran down into the Hold At first he was gently reproach'd but after many Repeti∣tions he was laugh'd at and began to be despis'd sensible of which as a Testimo∣nial of his Valour he made it his Request to be ty'd to the Main Mast But had it  been granted him I cannot see any Title he could have pleaded from hence to true Magnanimity since to be ty'd from run∣ning away can import nothing less than that he would have still continued these Signs of Cowardice if he had not been pre∣vented There is a Bravery of Mind which I fansy few of those Gentlemen Duellists are possess'd of True Courage cannot proceed from what Sir  Walter Ra∣leigh  finely calls  the Art  or  Philosophy of Quarrel  No It must be the Issue of Principle and can have no other Basis than a steady Tenet of Religion This will appear more plain if those Artists in Murder will give themselves leave cooly to consider and answer me this Question Why he that had ran so many Risques at his Sword's Point should be so shamefully intimidated at the Whiz of a Cannon Ball  The Names of those  English  Gentlemen who lost their Lives as I remember in this Engagement  COMMISSIONER  Cox  Captain of the  Royal Prince  under the Command of the Admiral and Mr  Travanian  Gentleman to the Duke of  York  Mr  Digby  Captain of the  Henry  second Son to the Earl of  Bristol  Sir  Fletchvile Hollis  Captain of  the  Cambridge  who lost one of his Arms in the War before and his Life in this Captain  Saddleton  of the  Dartmouth  the Lord  Maidstone  Son to the Earl of  Winchelsea  a Voluntier on board the  Charles  commanded by Sir  John Harman  ViceAdmiral of the Red  SIR  Philip Carteret  Mr  Herbert  Mr  Cotterel  Mr  Peyton  Mr  Gose  with se∣veral other Gentlemen unknown to me lost their Lives with the Earl of  Sandwich  on board the  Royal James  Mr  Vaughan  on board the  Katherine  commanded by Sir  John Chicheley  IN this Engagement Sir  George Rook  was youngest Lieutenant to Sir  Edward Sprage  Mr  Russel  afterwards Earl of  Orford  was Captain of a small Fifth Rate called the  Phoenix  Mr  Herbert  after∣wards Earl of  Torrington  was Captain of a small Fourth Rate called the  Monck  Sir  Harry Dutton Colt  who was on board the  Victory  commanded by the Earl of  Oss  ry  is the only Man now living that I can remember was in this Engagement  BUT to proceed the  Dutch  had one Man of War sunk though so near the Shore that I saw some part of her Main Mast remain above Water with their Admiral  Van Ghent  who was slain in the close Engagement with the Earl of  Sandwich  This Engagement lasted four∣teen Hours and was look'd upon the greatest that ever was fought between the  English  and the  Hollander  I CANNOT here omit one Thing which to some may seem trifling though I am apt to think our Naturalists may have a diffe∣rent Opinion of it and find it afford their Fansies no undiverting Employment in more curious and less perilous Reflections We had on board the  London  where as I have said I was a Voluntier a great Number of Pidgeons of which our Com∣mander was very fond These on the first firing of our Cannon dispers'd and flew away and were seen no where near us during the Fight The next Day it blew a brisk Gale and drove our Fleet some Leagues to the Southward of the Place where they forsook our Ship yet the Day after they all returned safe aboard not in one Flock but in small Parties of four or five at a Time Some Persons at that Time aboard the Ship admiring at the Manner of their Return and speaking of it with some Surprize Sir  Edward Sprage  told them That he brought those Pid∣geons with him from the  Streights  and that when pursuant to his Order he left the  Revenge  Man of War to go aboard the  London  all those Pidgeons of their own accord and without the Trouble or  Care of carrying left the  Revenge  like∣wise and removed with the Sailors on board the  London  where I saw them All which many of the Sailors afterwards confirm'd to me What Sort of Instinct this could proceed from I leave to the Cu∣rious  SOON after this Sea Engagement I left the Fleet And the Parliament the Winter following manifesting their Resentments against two of the Plenipotentiaries  viz Buckingham  and  Arlington  who had been sent over into  Holland  and expressing withal their great Umbrage taken at the prodigious Progress of the  French  Arms in the  United Provinces  and warmly remon∣strating the inevitable Danger attending  England  in their Ruin King  Charles  from all this and for want of the expected Supplies found himself under a Necessity of clapping up a speedy Peace with  Holland  Peace with  Holland  THIS Peace leaving those youthful Spirits that had by the late Naval War been rais'd into a generous Ferment under a perfect Inactivity at Home they found themselves to avoid a Sort of Life that was their Aversion oblig'd to look out for one more active and more suitable to their vigo∣rous Tempers Abroad  I MUST acknowledge my self one of that Number and therefore in the Year I resolv'd to go into  Flanders  in or∣der  to serve as Voluntier in the Army com∣manded by his Highness the Prince of  Orange  I took my Passage accordingly at  Dover  for  Calais  and so went by way of  Dunkirk  for  Brussels  ARRIVING at which Place I was in∣form'd that the Army of the Confederates lay encamp'd not far from  Nivelle  and un∣der the daily Expectation of an Engagement with the Enemy This News made me press forward to the Service for which Purpose I carry'd along with me proper Letters of Recommendation to Sir  Walter Vane  who was at that time a MajorGene∣ral Upon further Enquiry I understood that a Party of Horse which was to guard some Waggons that were going to Count  Montery  's Army were to set out next Morn∣ing so I got an  Irish  Priest to introduce me to the Commanding Officer which he readily oblig'd me in and they as I wish'd them arriv'd in the Camp next Day  I HAD scarce been there an Hour when happen'd one of the most extraordinary Ac∣cidents in Life I observ'd in the East a strange dusty colour'd Cloud of a pretty large Extent riding not before the Wind for it was a perfect Calm with such a pre∣cipitate Motion that it was got over our Heads almost as soon as seen When the Skirts of that Cloud began to cover our Camp there suddenly arose such a terrible  Hurricane or Whirlwind that all the Tents were carry'd aloft with great Vio∣lence into the Air and Soldiers Hats flew so high and thick that my Fansy can resemble it to nothing better than those Flights of Rooks which at Dusk of E∣vening leaving the Fields seek their roosting Places Trees were torn up by the very Roots and the Roofs of all the Barns  c  belonging to the Prince's Quarters were blown quite away This lasted for about half an Hour until the Cloud was wholly past over us when as suddenly en∣sued the same pacifick Calm as before the Cloud's Approach Its Course was seem∣ingly directly West and yet we were soon after inform'd that the fine Dome of the great Church at  Utrecht  had greatly suffer'd by it the same Day And if I am not much mistaken Sir  William Temple  in his Memoirs mentions somewhat of it which he felt at  Lillo  on his Return from the Prince of  Orange  's Camp where he had been a Day or two before  AS soon after this as I could get an Op∣portunity I deliver'd at his Quarters my recommendatory Letters to Sir  Walter Vane  who receiv'd me very kindly telling me at the same time that there were six or seven  English  Gentlemen who had enter'd them∣selves Voluntiers in the Prince's own Com∣pany of Guards And added that he would  immediately recommend me to Count  Solmes  their Colonel He was not worse than his Word and I was enter'd accordingly Those six Gentlemen were as follows  Clavers  who since was better known by the Title of Lord  Dundee  Mr  Collier  now Lord  Portmore  Mr  Rooke  since MajorGeneral Mr  Hales  who lately died and was for a long time Governor of  ChelseaHospital  Mr  Venner  Son of that  Venner  remarkable for his being one of the FifthMonarchy Men and Mr  Boyce  The four first rose to be very eminent but Fortune is not to all alike favourable  The Army marcheth towards  Binch  IN about a Week's Time after it was resolv'd in a Council of War to march to∣wards  Binch  a small wall'd Town about four Leagues from  Nivelle  the better to cut off the Provisions from coming to the Prince of  Conde  's Camp that Way  ACCORDINGLY on the first Day of  August  being  Saturday  we began our March and the  English  Voluntiers had the Favour of a Baggage Waggon appoint∣ed them Count  Souches  the Imperial General with the Troops of that Nation led the Van the main Body was compos'd of  Dutch  under the Prince of  Orange  as Generalissimo and the  Spaniards  under Prince  Vaudemont  with some Detachments made the Rear Guard  AS we were upon our March I being among those Detachments which made up the Rear Guard observ'd a great Party of the Enemy's Horse upon an Ascent which I then imagin'd as it after prov'd to be the Prince of  Condé  taking a View of our Forces under March There were many Defiles which our Army must necessarily pass through which that Prince politickly enough permitted the  Imperial  and  Dutch  Forces to pass unmolested But when Prince  Vaudemont  with the  Spaniards  and our Detachments thought to have done the like the Prince of  Condé  fell on our Rear Guard  Prince of  Condé  in∣tirely routs the Rear of the Con∣federate Army  and after a long and sharp Dis∣pute entirely routed 'em the Marquiss of  Assentar  a  Spanish  LieutenantGeneral dying upon the Spot  HAD the Prince of  Condé  contented him∣self with this Share of good Fortune his Victory had been uncontested But being push'd forward by a vehement Heat of Temper which he was noted for and flush'd with this extraordinary Success he resolv'd to force the whole Confederate Army to a Battle In order to which he immediately led his Forces between our Se∣cond Line and our Line of Baggage by which means the latter were entirely cut off and were subjected to the Will of the Enemy who fell directly to plunder in which they were not a little assisted by the  routed  Spaniards  themselves who did not disdain at that time to share with the Enemy in the plundering of their Friends and Allies  THE  English  Voluntiers had their Share of this ill Fortune with the rest their Waggon appointed them being among those intercepted by the Enemy and I for my Part lost every Thing but Life which yet was saved almost as unaccountably as my FellowSoldiers had lost theirs The Bag∣gage as I have said being cut off and at the Mercy of the Enemy every one endea∣vour'd to escape through or over the Hedges And as in all Cases of like Con∣fusion one endeavours to save himself upon the Ruins of others So here he that found himself stopt by another in getting over the Gap of a Hedge pull'd him back to make way for himself and perhaps met with the same Fortune from a Third to the Destruc∣tion of all I was then in the Vigour of my Youth and none of the least active and perceiving how it had far'd with some be∣fore me I clapt my left Leg upon the Shoulders of one who was thus contending with another and with a Spring threw my self over both their Heads and the Hedge at the same time By this Means I not only sav'd my Life for they were all cut to Pieces that could not get over but from an Eminence which I soon after attain'd I  had an Opportunity of seeing and making my Observations upon the remaining Part of that glorious Conflict  IT was from that advantagious Situation that I presently discover'd that the Imperia∣lists who led the Van had now join'd the main Body And I confess it was with an almost inexpressible Pleasure that I be∣held about three aClock with what in∣trepid Fury they fell upon the Enemy  The Battle of  Seneff  In short both Armies were universally en∣gag'd and with great Obstinacy disputed the Victory till Eleven at Night At which Time the  French  being pretty well sur∣feited made their Retreat  French  quit the Field  Nevertheless to secure it by a Stratagem they left their lighted Matches hanging in the Hedges and waving with the Air to conceal it from the Confederate Army  Confede∣rate Army drawn off  ABOUT two Hours after the Confede∣rate Forces follow'd the Example of their Enemies and drew off And tho' neither Army had much Reason to boast yet as the Prince of  Orange  remain'd last in the Field and the  French  had lost what they before had gain'd the Glory of the Day fell to the Prince of  Orange  who altho' but twentyfour Years of Age had the Suffrage of Friend and Foe of having play'd the Part of an old and experienc'd Officer  THERE were left that Day on the Field of Battle by a general Computation not less than eighteen Thousand Men on both Sides over and above those who died of their Wounds The Loss being pretty equal only the  French  carried off most Prisoners Prince  Waldeck  was shot through the Arm which I was near enough to be an Eyewitness of And my much lamented Friend Sir  Walter Vane  was carried off dead A Wound in the Arm was all the Mark of Honour that I as yet could boast of though our Cannon in the Defiles had slain many near me  THE Prince of  Condé  as we were next Day inform'd lay all that Night under a Hedge wrapp'd in his Cloke And either from the Mortification of being disappointed in his Hopes of Victory or from a Refle∣ction of the Disservice which his own na∣tural over Heat of Temper had drawn upon him was almost inconsolable many Days after And thus ended the famous Battle of  Seneff  BUT though common Vogue has given it the Name of a Battle in my weak Opi∣nion it might rather deserve that of a con∣fus'd Skirmish all Things having been for∣cibly carried on without Regularity or even Design enough to allow it any higher Denomination For as I have said before notwithstanding I was advantagiously sta∣tioned  for Observation I found it very of∣ten impossible to distinguish one Party from another  Prince of  Orange  in the midst of the  French  Army  And this was more remarkably evident on the Part of the Prince of  Orange  whose Valour and Vigour having led him into the Middle of the Enemy and being then sensible of his Error by a peculiar Presence of Mind gave the Word of Command in  French  which he spoke per∣fectly well But the  French  Soldiers who took him for one of their own Generals making Answer that their Powder was all spent it afforded Matter of Instruction to him to persist in his Attack at the same Time that it gave him a Lesson of Cauti∣on to withdraw himself as soon as he could to his own Troops  Marches to  Quarig∣nan  HOWEVER the Day after the Prince of  Orange  thought proper to march to  Qua∣rignan  a Village within a League of  Mons  where he remain'd some Days till he could be supply'd from  Brussels  with those Neces∣saries which his Army stood in need of  Marches to  Valenci∣ennes  and besieges  Oudenard  FROM thence we march'd to  Valen∣ciennes  where we again encamp'd till we could receive Things proper for a Siege Upon the Arrival whereof the Prince gave Orders to decamp and march'd his Army with a Design to besiege  Aeth  But having Intelligence on our March that the Ma∣reschal  De Humiers  had reinforc'd that Garrison we march'd directly to  Oude∣nard  and immediately invested it  THIS Siege was carried on with such Application and Success that the Besiegers were in a few Days ready for a Storm but the Prince of  Condé  prevented them by coming up to its Relief Upon which the Prince of  Orange  pursuant to the Resolution of a Council of War the Night before drew off his Forces in order to give him Battle and to that purpose after the laborious Work of filling up our Lines of Contraval∣lation that the Horse might pass more freely we lay upon our Arms all Night Next Morning we expected the Imperial General Count  Souches  to join us but instead of that he sent back some very frivolous Excuses of the Inconveniency of the Ground for a Battle and after that instead of joining the Prince marched off quite another way the Prince of  Orange  with the  Dutch  and  Spanish  Troops marched directly for  Ghent  exclaiming publickly against the Chicanery of  Souches  and openly declaring That he had been advertis'd of a Conference between a  French  Capuchin and that General the Night before Certain it is that that General lay under the Displeasure of his Master the Emperor for that Piece of Manage∣ment and the Count  de Sporck  was imme∣diately appointed General in his Place  Prince of  Orange  to going to leave the Army in Disgust  THE Prince of  Orange  was hereupon leaving the Army in great Disgust till pre∣vail'd upon by the Count  de Montery  for the general Safety to recede from that Re∣solution However seeing no likelihood of any Thing further to be done while  Souches  was in Command he resolv'd up∣on a Post of more Action though more dangerous wherefore ordering ten Thou∣sand Men to march before he himself soon after follow'd to the Siege of  Grave  Carries on the Siege of  Grave  THE  Grave  a strong Place and of the first Moment to the  Hollanders  had been block'd up by the  Dutch  Forces all the Summer the Prince of  Orange  therefore leaving the main Army under Prince  Wal∣deck  at  Ghent  follow'd the Detachment he had made for the Siege of that impor∣tant Place resolving to purchase it at any Rate On his Arrival before it Things began to find new Motion and as they were carried on with the utmost Applica∣tion and Fury the Besieged found them∣selves in a little Time oblig'd to change their haughty Summer Note for one more suitable to the Season  And takes it  THE Prince from his first coming ha∣ving kept those within hotly ply'd with Ball both from Cannon and Mortars Monsieur  Chamilly  the Governor after a few Days being weary of such warm Work desired to capitulate upon which Hostages were  exchanged and Articles agreed on next Morning Pursuant to which the Garri∣son march'd out with Drums beating and Colours flying two Days after and were conducted to  Charleroy  BY the taking this Place which made the Prince of  Orange  the more earnest up∣on it the  French  were wholly expell'd their last Year's astonishing Conquests in  Holland  And yet there was another Con∣sideration that render'd the Surrender of it much more considerable For the  French  being sensible of the great Strength of this Place had there deposited all their Can∣non and Ammunition taken from their other Conquests in  Holland  which they never were able to remove or carry off with tolerable Prospect of Safety after that Prince's Army first took the Field  THE Enemy being march'd out the Prince enter'd the Town and immediately order'd publick Thanksgivings for its happy Reduction Then having appointed a Go∣vernor and left a sufficient Garrison he put an End to that Campaign and return'd to the  Hague  where he had not been long before he fell ill of the Small Pox The Consternation this threw the whole Coun∣try into is not to be express'd Any one that had seen it would have thought that the  French  had made another Inundation greater than the former But when the  Danger was over their Joy and Satisfacti∣on for his Recovery was equally beyond Expression  Limburgh  besieged and taken by the  French  THE Year yielded very little re∣markable in our Army  Limburgh  was be∣sieged by the  French  under the Command of the Duke of  Enguien  which the Prince of  Orange  having Intelligence of immedi∣ately decamp'd from his fine Camp at  Beth∣lem  near  Louvain  in order to raise the Siege But as we were on a full March for that purpose and had already reach'd  Ruremond  Word was brought that the Place had surrender'd the Day before Upon which Advice the Prince after a short Halt made his little Army for it consisted not of more than thirty Thousand Men march back to  Brabant  Nothing of moment after this occurr'd all that Campaign  Maestrich  besieged by the Prince of  Orange  IN the Year the Prince of  Orange  having in concert with the  Spaniards  resolv'd upon the important Siege of  Mae∣strich  the only Town in the  Dutch  Pro∣vinces then remaining in the Hands of the  French  it was accordingly invested about the middle of  June  with an Army of twen∣ty Thousand Men under the Command of his Highness Prince  Waldeck  with the grand Army covering the Siege It was some Time before the heavy Cannon which we expected up the  Maes  from  Holland  arrived which gave Occasion to a Piece of Raillery of Monsieur  Calvo  the Governor which was as handsomely repartee'd That Governor by a Messenger intima∣ting his Sorrow to find we had pawn'd our Cannon for Ammunition Bread An∣swer was made That in a few Days we hoped to give him a Taste of the Loaves which he should find would be sent him in∣to the Town in extraordinary plenty I remember another Piece of Raillery which pass'd some Days after between the  Rhin∣grave  and the same  Calvo  The former sending Word that he hoped within three Weeks to salute that Governor's Mistress within the Place  Calvo  reply'd He'd give him leave to kiss her all over if he kiss'd her any where in three Months  BUT our long expected Artillery being at last arriv'd all this Jest and Merriment was soon converted into earnest Our Trenches were immediately open'd towards the  Dauphin  Bastion against which were planted many Cannon in order to make a Breach my self as a Probationer being twice put upon the forlorn Hope to faci∣litate that difficult Piece of Service Nor was it long before such a Breach was ef∣fected as was esteem'd practicable and therefore very soon after it was ordered to be attack'd  THE Disposition for the Attack was thus ordered two Serjeants with twenty Grenadiers a Captain with fifty Men my self one of the Number then a Party car∣rying Wool Sacks and after them two Captains with one Hundred Men more the Soldiers in the Trenches to be ready to sustain them as Occasion should re∣quire  THE Signal being given we left our Trenches accordingly having about one Hundred Yards to run before we could reach the Breach which we mounted with some Difficulty and Loss all our Batteries firing at the same instant to keep our Action in countenance and favour our Design When we were in Possession of the Bastion the Enemy fir'd most furiously upon us with their small Cannon through a thin brick Wall by which and their hand Grena∣does we lost more Men than we did in the Attack it self  BUT well had it been had our ill For∣tune stopp'd there for as if Disaster must needs be the Concomitant of Success we soon lost what we had thus gotten by a small but very odd Accident Not being furnished with such Scoopes as our Ene∣mies made use of in tossing their hand Grenadoes some distance off one of our own Soldiers aiming to throw one over the Wall into the Counterscarp among the  Enemy it so happen'd that he unfortunate∣ly miss'd his Aim and the Grenade fell down again on our side the Wall very near the Person who fir'd it He start∣ing back to save himself and some others who saw it fall doing the like those who knew nothing of the Matter fell into a sud∣den Confusion and imagining some greater danger than there really was every body was struck with a panick Fear and endea∣vour'd to be the first who should quit the Bastion and secure himself by a real Shame from an imaginary Evil Thus was a Ba∣stion that had been gloriously gain'd in∣advertently deserted and that too with the Loss of almost as many Men in the Re∣treat as had been slain in the Onset and the Enemy most triumphantly again took Possession of it  AMONG the Slain on our Side in this Action was an Ensign of Sir  John Fen∣wick  's Regiment and as an Approbation of my Services his Commission was bestow∣ed upon me  A FEW Days after it was resolv'd again to storm that Bastion as before out of three  English  and one  Scotch  Regiment then in the Camp a Detachment was se∣lected for a fresh Attack Those Regi∣ments were under the Command of Sir  John Fenwick  who was afterwards be∣headed  Colonel  Ralph Widdrington  and Colonel  Ashley  of the  English  and Sir  Alexander Collier  Father of the present Lord  Portmore  of the  Scotch  Out of every of these four Regiments as before were detach'd a Captain a Lieutenant and an Ensign with fifty Men Captain  An∣thony Barnwell  of Sir  John Fenwick  's Re∣giment who was now my Captain com∣manding that Attack  AT break of Day the Attack was be∣gun with great Resolution and though vigorously maintain'd was attended with the desir'd Success The Bastion was again taken and in it the commanding Officer who in Service to himself more than to us told us that the Center of the Bastion would soon be blown up being to his Knowledge undermin'd for that purpose But this Secret prov'd of no other use than to make us by way of Precaution to keep as much as we could upon the Rampart In this Attack Captain  Barnwell  lost his Life and it happened my new Commission was wetted not as too frequently is the Cu∣stom with a Debauch but with a Bullet through my Hand and the Breach of my Collar Bone with the Stroke of a Halberd  AFTER about half an Hour's Possession of the Bastion the Mine under it of which  the  French  Officer gave us warning was sprung the Enemy at the same Time ma∣king a furious Sally upon us The Mine did a little though the less Execution for being discover'd but the Sally no way answer'd their End for we beat them back and immediately fix'd our Lodgment which we maintain'd during the Time of the Siege But to our double Surprize a few Days after they fir'd another Mine un∣der or aside the former in which they had plac'd a quantity of Grenadoes which did much more Execution than the other Notwithstanding all which a Battery of Guns was presently erected upon that Ba∣stion which very considerably annoy'd the Enemy  THE Breach for a general Storm was now render'd almost practicable yet be∣fore that could be advisably attempted there was a strong Hornwork to be taken Upon this Exploit the  Dutch  Troops only were to signalize themselves and they answer'd the Confidence repos'd in them for though they were twice repuls'd at the third Onset they were more successful and took Posses∣sion which they likewise kept to the Rai∣sing of the Siege  THERE was a Stratagem lay'd at this Time which in its own Merit one would have thought should not have fail'd of a  good Effect but to shew the Vanity of the highest human Wisdom it miscarry'd On the other side of the  Maes  opposite to  Mae∣strich  lies the strong Fortress of  Wyck  to which it is join'd by a stone Bridge of six fair Arches The Design was by a false Attack on that regular Fortification to draw the Strength of the Garrison to its Defence which was but very natural to imagine would be the Consequence Rea∣dy to attend that well concerted false At∣tack a large flat bottom'd Boat properly furnish'd with Barrels of GunPowder and other Necessaries was to fall down under one of the middle Arches and when fix'd there by firing the Powder to have blown up the Bridge and by that means to have prevented the Return of the Garrison to op∣pose a real Attack at that instant of Time to be made upon the Town of  Maestrich  by the whole Army  THE false Attack on  Wyck  was accord∣ingly made which as propos'd drew the Main of the Garrison of  Maestrich  to its De∣fence and the Boat so furnish'd fell down the River as projected but unfortunately before it could reach the Arch from the Darkness of the Night running upon a Shoal it could not be got off for which Reason the Men in the Boat were glad to make a hasty Escape for fear of being dis∣cover'd  as the Boat was next Morning and the whole Design laid open  THIS Stratagem thus miscarrying all Things were immediately got ready for a general Storm at the main Breach in the Town and the rather because the Prince of  Orange  had receiv'd incontestable Intelli∣gence That Duke  Schomberg  at the Head of the  French  Army was in full march to relieve the Place But before every Thing could be rightly got ready for the intended Storm though some there were who pre∣tended to say that a Dispute rais'd by the  Spaniards  with the  Dutch  about the Pro∣priety of the Town when taken was the Cause of that Delay we heard at some di∣stance several Guns fir'd as Signals of Re∣lief upon which we precipitately and as most imagin'd shamefully drew off from before the Place and join'd the grand Ar∣my under Prince  Waldeck  Prince of  Orange  's Army re∣treats from before  Maestrich  But it was Matter of yet greater Surprize to most on the Spot that when the Armies were so joyn'd we did not stay to offer the Enemy Battle The well known Courage of the Prince then Generalissimo was so far from solving this Riddle that it rather puzzled all who thought of it however the pre∣vailing Opinion was that it was occasion'd by some great Misunderstanding between the  Spaniards  and the  Dutch  And Ex∣perience will evince that this was not the  only Disappointment of that Nature occa∣sion'd by imperfect Understandings  BESIDES the Number of common Soldi∣ers slain in this Attack which was not incon∣siderable we lost here the brave  Rhingrave  a Person much lamented on account of his many other excellent Qualifications as well as that of a General Colonel  Ralph Wid∣drington  and Colonel  Doleman  who had not enjoy'd  Widdrington  's Commission above a Fortnight Captain  Douglas  Cap∣tain  Barnwell  and Captain  Lee  were of the Slain among the  English  who in∣deed had born the whole brunt of the At∣tack upon the  Dauphin  's Bastion  I REMEMBER the Prince of  Orange  during the Siege receiv'd a Shot through his Arm which giving an immediate Alarm to the Troops under his Command he took his Hat off his Head with the wounded Arm and smiling wav'd it to shew them there was no danger Thus after the most gallant Defence against the most couragi∣ous Onsets ended the Siege of  Maestrich  and with it all that was material that Cam∣paign  Cambray  and St  O∣mers  be∣sieged by the  French  EARLY in the Spring in the Year the  French  Army under the Duke of  Orleans  besieged at once both  Cam∣bray  and  Saint Omers  This last the Prince of  Orange  seem'd very intent and resolute to relieve In order to which  well knowing by sad Experience it would be to little purpose to wait the majestick Motions of the  Spaniards  that Prince got together what Forces he could all in  Dutch  Pay and marching forward with all speed resolv'd even at the Hazard of a Battle to attempt the Raising the Siege  Prince of  Orange  attempts to raise the Siege of St  Omers  but is forc'd to retreat  Upon his appearing the Duke of  Orleans  to whose particular Conduct the Care of that Siege was committed drew off from before the Place leaving scarce enough of his Men to defend the Trenches The Prince was under the Necessity of march∣ing his Forces over a Morass and the Duke well knowing it took care to at∣tack him near  Mont Cassel  before half his little Army were got over The Dispute was very sharp but the Prince being much out number'd and his Troops not able by the Straitness of the Passage to engage all at once was oblig'd at last to retreat which he did in pretty good Order I re∣member the  Dutch  Troops did not all alike do their Duty and the Prince seeing one of the Officers on his fullest speed call'd to him over and over to halt which the Offi∣cer in too much haste to obey the Prince gave him a Slash over the Face saying  By this Mark I shall know you another Time  Soon after this Retreat of the Prince Saint  Omers  was surrender'd  St  Omers  surrenders  UPON this Retreat the Prince marching back lay for some Time among the Boors who from the good Discipline which he took care to make his Troops observe did not give us their customary boorish Recep∣tion And yet as secure as we might think our selves I met with a little Passage that confirm'd in me the Notions which the ge∣nerality as well as I had imbib'd of the private Barbarity of those People when∣ever an Opportunity falls in their Way I was stroling at a Distance from my Quar∣ters all alone when I found my self near one of their Houses into which the Doors being open I ventur'd to enter I saw no body when I came in though the House was for that Sort of People well enough furnish'd and in pretty decent Order I call'd but no body answering I had the Curiosity to advance a little farther when at the Mouth of the Oven which had not yet wholly lost its Heat I spy'd the Corpse of a Man so bloated swoln and parch'd as left me little room to doubt that the Oven had been the Scene of his Destiny I con∣fess the Sight struck me with Horror and as much Courage and Security as I enter'd with I withdrew in haste and with quite different Sentiments and could not fansy my self out of Danger till I had reach'd our Camp A wise Man should not frame an Accusation on Conjectures but on Inquiry  I was soon made sensible that such bar∣barous Usage is too common among those People especially if they meet with a Straggler of what Nation soever  THIS made me not very sorry when we decamp'd and we soon after receiv'd Or∣ders to march and invest  Charleroy  before which Place we stay'd somewhat above a Week and then drew off I remember very well that I was not the only Person then in the Camp that was at a Loss to dive into the Reason of this Investiture and De∣campment But since I at that time among the Politicians of the Army never heard a good one I shall not venture to offer my Sentiments at so great a Distance  Army marches to∣wards  Mons  WE after this march'd towards  Mons  and in our March pass'd over the very Grounds on which the Battle of  Seneff  had been fought three Years before It was with no little Pleasure that I resurvey'd a Place that had once been of so much Danger to me and where my Memory and Fansy now repeated back all those Observations I had then made under some unavoidable Confu∣sion Young as I was both in Years and Experience from my own Reflections and the Sentiments of others after the Fight was over methought I saw visibly before me the well order'd Disposition of the Prince of  Condé  the inexpressible Difficul∣ties which the Prince of  Orange  had to en∣counter  with while at the same Moment I could not omit to repay my Debt to the Memory of my first Patron Sir  Walter Vane  who there loosing his Life left me a solitary Wanderer to the wide World of Fortune  BUT these Thoughts soon gave place to new Objects which every Hour presented themselves in our continu'd March to  En∣ghien  a Place famous for the finest Gardens in all  Flanders  near which we encamp'd on the very same Ground which the  French  chose some Years after at the Battle of  Steenkirk  of which I shall speak in its proper Place Here the Prince of  Orange  left our Army as we afterwards found to pass into  England  where he marry'd the Princess  Mary  Daughter of the Duke of  York  And after his Departure that Cam∣paign ended without any thing further ma∣terial  Peace con∣cluded  NOW began the Year famous for the Peace and no less remarkable for an Action previous to it which has not fail'd to employ the Talents of Men variously as they stood affected Our Army under the Prince of  Orange  lay encamp'd at  Soignies  where it was whisper'd that the Peace was concluded Notwithstanding which two Days after being  Sunday  the  th  Day of  August  the Army was drawn out as most others as well as my self appre∣hended  in order to a  feux de Joye  but in lieu of that we found our March order'd towards St  Dennis  where the Duke of  Luxemburg  lay as he imagin'd safe in inaccessible Entrenchments  Prince of  Orange  arrives at St  Dennis  and begins the Attack  ABOUT three of the Clock our Army ar∣riv'd there when we receiv'd Orders to make the Attack It began with a most vi∣gorous Spirit that promis'd no less than the Success which ensu'd The three  English  and three  Scotch  Regiments under the Command of the ever renown'd Earl of  Ossory  together with the Prince of  Orange  's Guards made their Attack at a Place call'd the  Château  where the  French  took their Refuge among a Parcel of HopPoles but their Resource was as weak as their Defence and they were soon beaten out with a very great Slaughter  IT was here that a  French  Officer having his Pistol directed at the Breast of the Prince Monsieur  D'Auverquerque  interpos'd and shot the Officer dead upon the Spot  Duke of  Luxem∣burg  de∣feated and Peace pro∣claim'd  THE Fight lasted from three in the After∣noon till Nine at Night when growing dark the Duke of  Luxemburg  forsook his Entrenchments into which we march'd next Morning And to see the sudden Change of Things that very Spot of Ground where nothing but Fire and Fury appear'd the Day before the next saw so∣lac'd with the Proclamation of a Peace  ABOUT an Hour before the Attack be∣gan the Duke of  Monmouth  arriv'd in the Army being kindly receiv'd by the Prince of  Orange  bravely fighting by his Side all that Day The Woods and the Uneven∣ness of the Ground render'd the Cavalry almost useless yet I saw a Standard among some others which was taken from the Enemy being richly embroidered with Gold and Silver bearing the Sun in the Zodiack with these haughty Words  Nihil obstabit eunte  On the News of this unex∣pected Victory the States of  Holland  sent to congratulate the Prince and to testify how much they valued his Preservation they presented Monsieur  D'Auverquerque  who had so bravely rescued him with a Sword whose Handle was of massy Gold set with Diamonds I forgot to mention that this Gentleman receiv'd a Shot on his Head at the Battle of  Seneff  and truly in all Actions which were many he nobly distinguished himself by his Bravery He was Father of this present Earl of  Grantham  The NAMES of the  English  Officers which I knew to be killed in this Action  Lieut Col  Archer  Capt  Charleton  Capt  Richardson  Capt  Fisher  Capt  Pemfield  Lieut  Charleton  Lieut  Barton  Ensign  Colvile  With several others whose Names I have forgot  LIEUT Col  Babington  who began the Attack by beating the  French  out of the Hop Garden was taken Prisoner Col  Hales  who was a long time Governor of  Chelsea College  being then a Captain re∣ceived a Shot on his Leg of which he went lame to his dying Day  THE War thus ended by the Peace of  Nimeugen  the Regiment in which I serv'd was appointed to lie in Garrison at the  Grave  We lay there near four Years our Soldiers being mostly employ'd about the Fortifications It was here and by that Means that I imbib'd the Rudiments of Fortification and the practick Part of an Enginier which in my more advanc'd Years was of no small Service to me  NEVERTHELESS in the Year our Regiment receiv'd Orders to march to  Haren  near  Brussels  where with other Forces we encamp'd till we heard that  Luxemburg  invaded by the  French  in a Time of the profoundest Peace had sur∣render'd to them Then we decamp'd and march'd to  Mechlin  where we lay in the Field till near  November  Not that there was any War proclaim'd but as not know∣ing whether those who had committed such Acts of Hostility in time of Peace  might not take it in their Heads to proceed yet further In  November  we march'd into that Town where Count  Nivelle  was Go∣vernor The Marquiss  de Grana  at the same time governing the  Netherlands  in the Jurisdiction of  Spain  NOTHING of any Moment happen'd after this till the Death of King  Charles  II The Summer after which the three  English  and three  Scotch  Regiments receiv'd Orders to pass over into  England  upon the Occa∣sion of  Monmouth  's Rebellion  English  and  Scotch  Regiments pass over into  Eng∣land  where upon our Arrival we receiv'd Orders to encamp on  HounslowHeath  But that Rebellion being soon stifled and King  James  having no farther Need of us those Regiments were order'd to return again to  Holland  into the proper Service of those who paid them  THO' I am no stiff Adherer to the Doc∣trine of Predestination yet to the full Assu∣rance of a Providence I never could fail to adhere Thence came it that my natural Desire to serve my own native Country prevail'd upon me to quit the Service of an∣other though its Neighbour and Allie Events are not always to direct the Judg∣ment and therefore whether I did best in following those fondling Dictates of Nature I shall neither question nor determine  HOWEVER it was not long after my Ar∣rival in  England  before I had a Commission  given me by King  James  to be a Lieute∣nant in a new rais'd Regiment under the Command of Colonel  Tufton  Brother to the Earl of  Thanet  Under this Commis∣sion I sojourn'd out two peaceable Cam∣paigns on  HounslowHeath  where I was an EyeWitness of one mock Siege of  Buda  After which our Regiment was order'd to  Berwick  where I remained till the Revo∣lution  K  James  abdicates the Throne  KING  James  having abdicated the Throne and the Prince of  Orange  accepting the Administration all Commissions were order'd to be renew'd in his Name The Officers of our Regiment as well as others severally took out theirs accordingly a very few excepted of which Number was our Colonel who refusing a Compliance his Commission was given to Sir  James Lesley  Prince of  Orange  proclaim'd King  THE Prince of  Orange  presently after was declar'd and proclaim'd King and his Princess Queen with a conjunctive Power Upon which our Regiment was order'd into  Scotland  where Affairs appear'd under a Face of Disquietude We had our Quar∣ters at  Leith  till the Time the Castle of  Edinburg  then under the Command of the Duke of  Gordon  had surrender'd After which pursuant to fresh Orders we march'd to  Inverness  a Place of no great Strength and as little Beauty though yet  I think I may say without the least Danger of an  Hyperbole  that it is as pleasant as most Places in that Country Here we lay two long Winters perpetually harrass'd upon Parties and hunting of somewhat wilder than their wildest Game namely the  Highlanders  who were if not as nimble footed yet fully as hard to be found  BUT General  Mackay  having receiv'd Orders to build a Fort at  Inverlochy  our Regiment among others was commanded to that Service The two Regiments ap∣pointed on the same Duty with some few Dragoons were already on their March which having join'd we march'd together through  Louquebar  This sure is the wildest Country in the  Highlands  if not in the World I did not see one House in all our March and their Oeconomy if I may call it such is much the same with that of the  Arabs  or  Tartars  Hutts or Cabins of Trees and Trash are their Places of Habi∣tation in which they dwell till their halfhorn'd Cattle have devour'd the Grass and then remove staying no where longer than that Convenience invites them  IN this March or rather if you please most dismal Peregrination we could but very rarely go two on a Breast and oftner like Geeze in a String one after another So that our very little Army had sometimes  or rather most commonly an Extent of many Miles our Enemy the  Highlanders  firing down upon us from their Summits all the Way Nor was it possible for our Men or very rarely at least to return their Fa∣vours with any Prospect of Success for as they pop'd upon us always on a sudden they never stay'd long enough to allow any of our Soldiers a Mark or even time enough to fire And for our Men to march or climb up those Mountains which to them were natural Champion would have been as dangerous as it seem'd to us impracticable Nevertheless under all these disheartning Disadvantages we arriv'd at  Inverlochy  and there perform'd the Task appointed building a Fort on the same Spot where  Cromwell  had rais'd one before And which was not a little remarkable we had with us one  Hill  a Colonel who had been Go∣vernor in  Oliver  's Time and who was now again appointed Governor by General  Mac∣kay  Thus the Work on which we were sent being effected we march'd back again by the Way of  Gillycrancky  where that memorable Battle under  Dundee  had been fought the Year before  SOME time after Sir  Thomas Levingston  afterwards Earl of  Tiviot  having receiv'd Intelligence that the  Highlanders  intended to fall down into the lower Countries in a considerable Body got together a Party  of about five Hundred the Dragoons call'd the  Scotch Greys  inclusive with which he resolv'd if possible to give them a Meet∣ing We left  Inverness  the last Day o  April  and encamp'd near a little Town call'd  Forrest  the Place where as Tradi∣tion still confidently avers the Witches met  Mackbeth  and greeted him with their dia∣bolical Auspices But this Story is so natu∣rally display'd in a Play of the immortal  Shakespear  that I need not descend here to any farther Particulars  HERE Sir  Thomas  receiv'd Intelligence that the  Highlanders  design'd to encamp upon the  Spey  near the Laird of  Grant's  Castle Whereupon we began our March about Noon and the next Day about the Break thereof we came to that River where we soon discover'd the  Highlanders  by their Fires Sir  Thomas  immediately on Sight of it issued his Orders for our fording the River and falling upon them as soon after as possible  High∣landers  totally routed  Both were according∣ly perform'd and with so good Order Se∣crecy and Success that  Cannon  and  Balfour  their Commanders were obliged to make their Escape naked  THEY were about one Thousand in Num∣ber of which were kill'd about three Hun∣dred we pursued them till they got up  CrowdaleHill  where we lost them in a Fog And indeed so high is that Hill  that they who perfectly knew it assured me that it never is without a little dark Fog hanging over it And to me at that Instant of Time they seem'd rather to be People receiv'd up into Clouds than flying from an Enemy  NEAR this there was an old Castle call'd  Lethendy  into which about Fifty of them made their Retreat most of them Gentle∣men resolving there to defend themselves to the last Sir  Thomas  sent a Messenger to them with an Offer of Mercy if they would surrender But they refus'd the profer'd Quarter and fir'd upon our Men killing two of our Grenadiers and wound∣ing another During my Quarters at the  Grave  having learnt to throw a Grenado I took three or four in a Bag and crept down by the Side of a Ditch or Dyke to an old thatch'd House near the Castle ima∣gining on my mounting the same I might be near enough to throw them so as to do execution I found all Things answer my Expectation and the Castle wanting a Cover I threw in a Grenado which put the Enemy immediately into Confusion The Second had not so good Success falling short and the Third burst as soon as it was well out of my Hand though without Da∣mage to my self But throwing the Fourth in at a Window it so increas'd the Confu∣sion which the first had put them into that  they immediately call'd out to me upon their Parole of Safety to come to them  ACCORDINGLY I went up to the Door which they had barricaded and made up with great Stones when they told me they were ready to surrender upon Condition of obtaining Mercy I return'd to Sir  Thomas  and telling him what I had done and the Consequence of it and the Message they had desir'd me to deliver a great many of the  Highland  Gentlemen not of this Party being with him Sir  Thomas  in a high Voice and broad  Scotch  best to be heard and understood order'd me back to tell 'em  He would cut them all to Pieces for their Murder of two of his Grenadiers after his Profer of Quarter  I WAS returning full of these melancholy Tidings when Sir  Thomas  advancing after me a little Distance from the rest of the Company  Hark ye Sir  says he  I be∣lieve there may be among 'em some of our old Acquaintance  for we had serv'd together in the Service of the  States  in  Flanders    therefore tell them they shall have good Quarter  I very willingly carry'd back a Message so much chang'd to my Mind and upon delivering of it without the least He∣sitation they threw down the Barricado open'd the Door and out came one  Brody  who as he then told me had had a Piece of his Nose taken off by one of my Gre∣nadoes  I carry'd him to Sir  Thomas  who confirming my Message they all came out and surrendered themselves Prisoners This happen'd on  May  Day in the Morning for which Reason we return'd to  Inverness  with our Prisoners and Boughs in our Hats and the  Highlanders  never held up their Heads so high after this Defeat  UPON this Success Sir  Thomas  wrote to Court giving a full Account of the whole Action In which being pleas'd to make mention of my Behaviour with some Parti∣cularities I had soon after a Commission order'd me for a Company in the Regiment under the Command of Brigadier  Tiffin  MY Commission being made out sign'd and sent to me I repair'd immediately to  Portsmouth  where the Regiment lay in Garrison A few Days after I had been there Admiral  Russel  arriv'd with the Fleet and anchor'd at St  Hellen  's where he re∣main'd about a Week On the  th  of  May  the whole Fleet set Sail and it being my Turn the same Day to mount the Main Guard I was going the Rounds very early when I heard great shooting at Sea I went directly to acquaint the Governor and told him my Sentiments that the two contending Fleets were actually engag'd which indeed prov'd true for that very Night a Pinnace which came from our Fleet brought News that Admiral  Russel  had engag'd the  French  Admiral  Turvile  and after a long and sharp Dispute was making after them to their own Coasts  THE next Day towards Evening seve∣ral other Expresses arriv'd one after an∣other all agreeing in the Defeat of the  French  Fleet and in the Particulars of the burning their  Rising Sun  together with many other of their Men of War at  la Hogue  All which Expresses were imme∣diately forwarded to Court by Mr  Gibson  our Governor  ABOUT two Months after this our Re∣giment among many others was according to Order shipp'd off on a Secret Expedi∣tion under the Command of the Duke of  Leinster  no Man knowing to what Place we were going or on what Design no not the Commander himself However when we were out at Sea the General according to Instructions opening his Commission we were soon put out of our Suspence and in∣form'd that our Orders were to attack  Dunkirk  But what was so grand a Secret to those concern'd in the Expedition having been intrusted to a Female Politician on Land it was soon discover'd to the Enemy for which Reason our Orders were counter∣manded before we reach'd the Place of Action and our Forces receiv'd Directions to land at  Ostend  Battle at  Steenkirk  SOON after this happen'd that memorable Battle at  Steenkirk  which as very few at that Time could dive into the Reason of and mistaken Accounts of it have pass'd for authentick I will mention somewhat more particularly The Undertaking was bold and as many thought bolder than was consistent with the Character of the wise Undertaker Nevertheless the  French  having taken  Namure  and as the Male∣contents alledg'd in the very Sight of a su∣perior Army and nothing having been done by Land of any moment Things were blown into such a dangerous Fermen∣tation by a malicious and lying Spirit that King  William  found himself under a Necessity of attempting something that might appease the Murmurs of the People He knew very well though spoke in the Senate that it was not true that his Forces at the Siege of  Namure  exceeded those of the Enemy no Man could be more afflicted than he at the overflowing of the  Mehaigne  from the continual Rains which obstructed the Relief he had design'd for that important Place yet since his Maligners made an ill Use of these false Topicks to insinuate that he had no Mind to put an End to the War he was resolv'd to evince the contrary by shewing them that he was not afraid to ven∣ture his Life for the better obtaining what was so much desired  TO that Purpose receiving Intelligence that the Duke of  Luxemburg  lay strongly encamp'd at  Steenkirk  near  Enghien  tho' he was sensible he must pass through many Defiles to engage him and that the many Thickets between the two Armies would frequently afford him new Difficulties he resolv'd there to attack him Our Troops at first were forc'd to hew out their Passage for the Horse and there was no one Diffi∣culty that his Imagination had drawn that was lessen'd by Experience and yet so prosperous were his Arms at the Beginning that our Troops had made themselves Masters of several Pieces of the Enemy's Cannon But the farther he advanc'd the Ground growing straiter so strait as not to admit his Army's being drawn up in Bat∣talia the Troops behind could not give timely Succour to those engag'd and the Cannon we had taken was forcibly left be∣hind in order to make a good Retreat The  French  had lost all their Courage in the Onset for though they had too fair an Op∣portunity they did not think fit to pursue it or at least did it very languidly How∣ever the Malecontents at Home I remem∣ber grew very well pleas'd after this for so long as they had but a Battle for their Money like true  Englishmen  lost or won they were contented  SEVERAL Causes I remember were assign'd for this Miscarriage as they call'd it Some there were who were willing to lay it upon the  Dutch  and alledge a Say∣ing of one of their Generals who receiving Orders to relieve some  English  and  Scotch  that were overpower'd was heard to say  Dam 'em since they love Fighting let 'em have their Bellies full  But I should rather impute the Disappointment to the great Loss of so many of our bravest Officers at the very first Onset General  Mackay  Colonel  Lanier  the Earl of  Angus  with both his FieldOfficers Sir  Robert Douglas  Colonel  Hodges  and many others falling it was enough to put a very considerable Army into Confusion I remember one par∣ticular Action of Sir  Robert Douglas  that I should think my self to blame should I omit Seeing his Colours on the other Side the Hedge in the Hands of the Enemy he leap'd over slew the Officer that had them and then threw them over the Hedge to his Company redeeming his Colours at the Expense of his Life Thus the  Scotch  Commander improv'd upon the  Roman  Ge∣neral for the brave  Posthumius  cast his Stan∣dard in the Middle of the Enemy for his Soldiers to retrieve but  Douglas  retriev'd his from the Middle of the Enemy without any Assistance and cast it back to his Soldiers  to retain after he had so bravely rescued it out of the Hands of the Enemy  FROM hence our Regiment receiv'd Or∣ders to march to  Dixmuyd  where we lay some time employ'd in fortifying that Place While we were there I had one Morning stedfastly fix'd my Eyes upon some Ducks that were swimming in a large Water be∣fore me when all on a sudden in the Midst of a perfect Calm I observ'd such a strange and strong Agitation in the Waters that prodigiously surpriz'd me I was at the same Moment seiz'd with such a Giddiness in my Head that for a Minute or two I was scarce sensible and had much ado to keep on my Legs I had never felt any thing of an Earthquake before which as I soon after understood from others this was and it left indeed very apparent Marks of its Force in a great Rent in the Body of the great Church which remains to this Day  HAVING brought the intended Fortifica¦tions into some tolerable Order we receiv'd a Command out of hand to reimbarque for  England  And upon our Landing Direc∣tions met us to march for  Ipswich  where we had our Quarters all that Winter From thence we were order'd up to  London  to do Duty in the  Tower  I had not been there long before an Accident happen'd a  little to be accounted for without a divine Providence as some would make that Pro∣vidence to be that only can account for it  A dange∣rous Acci∣dent at the  Tower  of  London  THERE was at that Time as I was assur'd by my Lord  Lucas  Constable of it upwards of twenty Thousand Barrels of Gun∣powder in that they call the  WhiteTower  when all at once the middle Flooring did not only give way or shrink but fell flat down upon other Barrels of Powder together with many of the same combustible Matter which had been placed upon it It was a Providence strangely neglected at that Time and hardly thought of since But let any considerate Man consult the Consequences if it had taken fire perhaps to the Destruc∣tion of the whole City or at least as far as the  Bridge  and Parts adjacent Let his Thoughts proceed to examine why or how in that precipitate Fall not one Nail nor one Piece of Iron in that large Fabrick should afford one little Spark to enflame that Mass of sulphurous Matter it was loaded with and if he is at a loss to find a Providence I fear his Friends will be more at a loss to find his Understanding But the Battle of  Landen  happening while our Regiment was here on Duty we were soon remov'd to our Satisfaction from that paci∣fick Station to one more active in  Flanders  NOTWITHSTANDING that fatal Battle the Year preceding namely  A D  the  Confederate Army under King  William  lay encamp'd at  Mont St André  an open Place and much expos'd while the  French  were entrench'd up to their very Teeth at  Vig∣namont  a little Distance from us This afforded Matter of great Reflection to the Politicians of those Times who could hard∣ly allow that if the Confederate Army suffer'd so much as it really did in the Battle of  Landen  it could consist with right Conduct to tempt or rather dare a new Engagement But those sage Objectors had forgot the wellknown Courage of that brave Prince and were as little capable of fathoming his Designs The Enemy who to their Sorrow had by Experience been made better Judges was resolv'd to tra∣verse both for which Purpose they kept close within their Entrenchments so that after all his Efforts King  William  finding he could no way draw them to a Battle suddenly decamp'd and march'd directly to  Pont Espiers  by long Marches with a Design to pass the  French  Lines at that Place  BUT notwithstanding our Army march'd in a direct Line to our great Surprize we found the Enemy had first taken possession of it They gave this the Name of the  Long March  and very deservedly for though our Army march'd upon the String and the Enemy upon the Bow sensible of  the Importance of the Post and the Neces∣sity of securing it by double horseing with their Foot and by leaving their Weary and Weak in their Garrisons and supplying their Places with fresh Men out of them they gain'd their Point in disappointing us Though certain it is that March cost 'em as many Men and Horses as a Battle How∣ever their Master the  French  King was so pleas'd with their indefatigable and auspi∣cious Diligence that he wrote with his own Hand a Letter of Thanks to the Officers for the great Zeal and Care they had taken to prevent the Confederate Army from entring into  French Flanders  KING  William  thus disappointed in that noble Design gave immediate Orders for his whole Army to march through  Oude∣nard  and then encamp'd at  Rosendale  after some little Stay at that Camp we were remov'd to the  Camerlins  between  Newport  and  Ostend  once more to take our Winter Quarters there among the Boors  Namur  invested by the Earl of  Athlone  WE were now in the Year when the strong Fortress of  Namur  taken by the  French  in and since made by them much stronger was invested by the Earl of  Athlone  After very many vigorous Attacks with the Loss of many Men the Town was taken the Garrison retiring into the Castle Into which soon after notwithstanding all  the Circumspection of the Besiegers Maref∣chal  Bouflers  found means with some Dra∣goons to throw himself  Prince  Vaude∣mont  's glo∣rious Re∣treat  WHILE King  William  was thus engag'd in that glorious and important Siege Prince  Vaudemont  being posted at  Watergaem  with about fifty Battallions and as many Squadrons the Mareschal  Villeroy  laid a Design to attack him with the whole  French  Army The Prince imagin'd no less there∣fore he prepar'd accordingly giving us Or∣ders to fortify our Camp as well as the little time we had for it would permit Those Orders were pursu'd nevertheless I must confess it was beyond the Reach of my little Reason to account for our so long Stay in the Sight of an Army so much supe∣rior to ours The Prince in the Whole could hardly muster thirty Thousand and  Villeroy  was known to value himself upon having one Hundred Thousand effective Men However the Prince provisionally sent away all our Baggage that very Mor∣ning to  Ghent  and still made shew as if he resolv'd to defend himself to the last Extre∣mity in our little Entrenchments The Enemy on their Side began to surround us and in their Motions for that Purpose blew up little Bags of Gunpowder to give the readier Notice how far they had accom∣plish'd it Another Captain with my self being plac'd on the Right with one Hun∣dred  Men where I found Monsieur  Montal  endeavouring if possible to get behind us I could easily observe they had so far at∣tain'd their Aim of encompassing us as to the very Fashion of a Horse's Shoe This made me fix my Eyes so intently upon the advancing Enemy that I never minded what my Friends were doing behind me though I afterwards found that they had been fileing off so very artfully and private∣ly by that narrow Opening of the HorseShoe that when the Enemy imagin'd us past a Possibility of Escape our little Army at once and of a sudden was ready to dis∣appear There was a large Wood on the Right of our Army through which lay the Road to  Ghent  not broader than to admit of more than Four to march abreast Down this the Prince had slid his Forces except to that very small Party which the Captain and my self commanded and which was de∣signedly left to bring up the Rear Nor did we stir till Captain  Collier  then  Aid de Camp  to his Brother now Earl of  Port∣more  came with the Word of Command for us to draw off  WHEN  Villeroy  was told of our Retreat he was much surpriz'd as thinking it a Thing utterly impossible However at last being sensible of the Truth of it he gave Orders for our Rear to be attack'd but we kept fireing from Ditch to Ditch and  Hedge to Hedge till Night came upon us and so our little Army got clear of its gi∣gantick Enemy with very inconsiderable Loss However the  French  fail'd not in their customary Way to express the Sense of their Vexation at this Disappointment with Fire and Sword in the Neighbourhood round Thus Prince  Vaudemont  acquir'd more Glory by that Retreat than an intire Victory could have given him and it was not I confess the least Part of Satisfaction in Life that my self had a Share of Honour under him to bring off the Rear at that his glorious Retreat at  Arseel  HOWEVER in further Revenge of this po∣litical Chicane of the Prince of  Vaudemont  and to oblige if possible King  William  to raise the Siege from before  Namur Ville∣roy  enter'd into the Resolution of Bom∣barding  Brussells  Villeroy  bombards  Brussels  In order to which he encamp'd at  Anderleck  and then made his Approaches as near as was convenient to the Town There he caus'd to be planted thirty Mortars and rais'd a Battery of ten Guns to shoot hot Bullets into the Place  BUT before they fir'd from either  Ville∣roy  in complement to the Duke of  Bava∣ria  sent a Messenger to know in what Part of the Town his Dutchess chose to re∣side that they might as much as possible avoid incommoding her by directing their Fire to other Parts Answer was return'd  that she was at her usual Place of Residence the Palace and accordingly their fireing from Battery or Mortars little incommoded them that Way  FIVE Days the Bombardment continu'd and with such Fury that the Centre of that noble City was quite lay'd in Rubbish Most of the Time of Bombarding I was upon the Counterscarp where I could best see and distinguish and I have often counted in the Air at one time more than twenty Bombs for they shot whole Vollies out of their Mortars all together This as it must needs be terrible threw the inha∣bitants into the utmost Confusion Cart∣loads of Nuns that for many Years before had never been out of the Cloister were now hurry'd about from Place to Place to find Retreats of some Security In short the Groves and Parts remote were all crowded and the most spacious Streets had hardly a Spectator left to view their Ruins Nothing was to be seen like that Dexterity of our People in extinguishing the Fires for where the redhot Bullets fell and rais'd new Conflagrations not Burghers only but the vulgar Sort stood stareing and with their Hands impocketted beheld their Houses gradually consume and without offering prudent or charitable Hand to stop the growing Flames  Villeroy  decamps  BUT after they had almost thus destroy'd that late fair City  Villeroy  finding he could not raise the Siege of  Namur  by that vi∣gorous Attack upon  Brussels  decamp'd at last from before it and put his Army on the March to try if he could have better Success by exposing to Show his Pageant of one Hundred Thousand Men Prince  Vau∣demont  had timely Intelligence of the Duke's Resolution and Motion and resolv'd if possible to get there before him Nor was the Attempt fruitless He fortunately suc∣ceeded though with much Fatigue and no little Difficulty after he had put a Trick upon the Spies of the Enemy by pretending to encamp and so soon as they were gone ordering a full March  THE Castle of  Namur  had been all this Time under the Fire of the Besieger's Can∣non and soon after our little Army under the Prince was arriv'd a Breach that was imagin'd practicable being made in the  Terra Nova  which as the Name imports was a new Work rais'd by the  French  and added to the Fortifications since it fell into their Hands in and which very much increas'd the Strength of the Whole a Breach as I have said being made in this  Terra Nova  a Storm in a Council of War was resolv'd upon Four entire Re∣giments in conjunction with some Draughts made out of several others were order'd  for that Work my self commanding that Part of 'em which had been drawn out of Colonel  Tiffin  's We were all to rendevouze at the Abbey of  Salsines  under the Com∣mand of the Lord  Cutts  the Signal when the Attack was to be made being agreed to be the blowing up of a Bag of Gunpowder upon the Bridge of Boats that lay over the  Sambre  Lord  Cutts  storms the Castle of  Namur  but oblig'd to retire  SO soon as the Signal was made we march'd up to the Breach with a decent Intrepidity receiving all the Way we ad∣vanc'd the full Fire of the  Coborn  Fort But as soon as we came near enough to mount we found it vastly steep and rugged Not∣withstanding all which several did get up and enter'd the Breach but not being sup∣ported as they ought to have been they were all made Prisoners Which together with a Wound my Lord  Cutts  receiv'd after we had done all that was possible for us necessitated us to retire with the Loss of many of our Men  VILLEROY  all this while lay in sight with his Army of One Hundred Thou∣sand Men without making the least Offer to incommode the Besiegers or even with∣out doing any thing more than make his Ap∣pearance in favour of the Besieged and re∣connoitring our Encampment And at last seeing or imagining that he saw the At∣tempt would be to little purpose with all  the good Manners in the World in the Night he withdrew that terrible Meteor and reliev'd our poor Horses from feeding on Leaves the only Inconvenience he had put us to  The Castle capitulates  THIS Retreat leaving the Garrison without all Hope of Relief they in the Castle immediately capitulated But after one of the Gates had been according to Articles delivered up and Count  Guiscard  was marching out at the Head of the Gar∣rison and  Bouflers  at the Head of the Dra∣goons the latter was by order of King  William  arrested in reprize of the Garri∣son of  Dixmuyd  who contrary to the  Cartel  had been detain'd Prisoners and remain'd under Arrest till they were set free  Assassina∣tion Plot  AT the very Beginning of the Year was discover'd a Plot fit only to have had its Origin from Hell or  Rome  A Plot which would have put  Hottentots  and Bar∣barians out of Countenance This was call'd the  Assassination Plot  from the Design of it which was to have assassinated King  William  a little before the Time of his usual leaving  England  to head the Army of the Confederates in  Flanders  And as nothing could give a nobler Idea of the great Cha∣racter of that Prince than such a nefarious Combination against him so with all con∣siderate Men nothing could more depreciate  the Cause of his inconsiderate Enemies If I remember what I have read the Sons of ancient  Rome  though Heathens behav'd themselves against an Enemy in a quite dif∣ferent Manner Their Historians afford us more Instances than a few of their generous Intimations to Kings and Generals under actual Hostilities of barbarous Designs upon their Lives I proceed to this of our own Countrymen  SOON after the Discovery had been made by Persons actually engag'd in that inhuman Design the Regiment in which I serv'd with some others then in  Flanders  receiv'd Orders with all Expedition to embarque for  England  though on our Arrival at  Gravesend  fresh Orders met us to remain on board the Transports till we had fur∣ther Directions  ON my going to  London  a few Days after I was told that two Regiments only were now design'd to come ashore and that the rest would be remanded to  Flan∣ders  the Danger apprehended being pretty well over I was at  WhiteHall  when I receiv'd this Notice where meeting my Lord  Cutts  who had ever since the storming of the  Terra Nova  at  Namur  allow'd me a Share in his Favour he express'd him∣self in the most obliging Manner and at parting desir'd he might not fail of seeing me next Morning at his House for he had  somewhat of an extraordinary Nature to communicate to me  AT the time appointed I waited on his Lordship where I met Mr  Steel  now Sir  Richard  and at that time his Secretary who immediately introduc'd me I found in company with him three Gentlemen and after common Salutations his Lordship de∣liver'd into my Hands an Order from the King in Council to go along with Captain  Porter  Mr  de la Rue  and Mr  George Harris  who prov'd to be those three with him to search all the Transports at  Graves∣end  in order to prevent any of the Conspi∣rators getting out of  England  that Way After answering that I was ready to pay Obedience and receiving in private the further necessary Instructions we took our Leave and Oars soon after for  Gravesend  'Twas in our Passage down that I under∣stood that they had all been of the Conspi∣racy but now reluctant were become Wit∣nesses  WHEN we came to  Gravesend  I produc'd my Authority to the Commanding Officer who very readily paid Obedience and gave Assistance But after our most diligent Search finding nothing of what we look'd for we return'd that very Night to  London  NEXT Day a Proclamation was to come out for the apprehending three of four Troopers who were sent over by King  James  with a thousand Pounds Reward for each Mr  George Harris  who was the fourth being the only Evidence against the other three No sooner were we re∣turn'd from  Gravesend  but  Harris  had In∣telligence brought him that  Cassells  one of the three was at Mr  Allens  in the  Savoy  under the Name of  Green  Upon which we went directly to the Place and enqui∣ring for Mr  Green  we were told he lodg'd there and was in his Room  I WAS oblig'd by my Order to go along with them and assist 'em and very well was it that I was so For in consideration of the Reward in the Proclamation which as I have said was to come out the next Day  Harris  and the rest were for deferring his Seizure till the coming out of that Procla∣mation but making answer that in case of his Escape that Night I must be respon∣sible to my Superiors who under the most favourable Aspect would construe it a Neg∣lect of Duty they were forc'd to comply and so he was taken up and his Name that Night struck out of the Proclamation It is very true by this faithful Discharge of my Trust I did save the Government one Thousand Pounds but it is equally so that I never had of my Governors one Farthing Consideration for what others term'd an overofficious Piece of Service though in  Justice it must be own'd a Piece of exact and disinterested Duty  SOME few Days after attending by Di∣rection at the Secretary's Office with Mr  Harris  there came in a  Dutchman  splut∣tering and making a great Noise that he was sure he could discover one of the Con∣spirators but the Mein and the Behaviour of the Man would not give any Body Leave to give him any Credit or Regard How∣ever the Man persisting in his Assertions I spoke to Mr  Harris  to take him aside and ask him what Sort of a Person he was  Harris  did so and the  Dutchman  descri∣bing him says  Harris  returning to me I'll be hang'd if it be not  Blackburn  Upon which we had him question'd somewhat more narrowly when having no room to doubt and understanding where he was Colonel  Rivet  of the Guards was sent for and order'd to go along with us to seize him We went accordingly and it proving to be  Blackburn  the  Dutchman  had five Hundred Pounds and the Colonel and o∣thers the Remainder  Cassels  and  Black∣burn  if still alive are in  Newgate  confin'd by Act of Parliament one only Witness which was  Harris  being producible against them  WHEN  Blackburn  was seiz'd I found in the Chamber with him one  Davison  a  Watchmaker living in  Holbourn  I car∣ry'd him along with me to the Secretary of State but nothing on his Examination ap∣pearing against him he was immediately discharg'd He offer'd afterwards to present me with a fine Watch of his own making which I refus'd and he long after own'd the Obligation  SO soon as the Depth of this Plot was fathom'd and the intended Evil provided against as well as prevented King  William  went over into  Flanders  and our Regi∣ment thereupon receiv'd Orders for their immediate Return Nothing of any Mo∣ment occurr'd till our Arrival at our old Quarters the  Camerlins  where we lay dis∣pers'd amongst the Country Boors or Far∣mers as heretofore However for our better Security in those Quarters and to preserve us from the Excursions of the neighbouring Garrison of  Furnes  we were oblig'd to keep an Outguard at a little Place call'd  Shoerbeck  This Guard was every fortyeight Hours chang'd and re∣mounted with a Captain a Lieutenant an Ensign and threescore Men  WHEN it came to my Turn to relieve that Guard and for that Purpose I was ar∣riv'd at my Post it appear'd to me with the Face of a Place of Debauch rather than Business there being too visible Tokens that the hard Duty of both Officers  and Soldiers had been that of hard Drin∣king the foulest Error that a Soldier can commit especially when on his Guard  TO confirm my Apprehensions a little after I had taken Possession of my Guard the Man of the House related to me such Passages and so many of 'em that satisfy'd me that if ten sober Men had made the At∣tack they might have fairly knock'd all my Predecessors of the last Guard on the Head without much Difficulty However his Account administer'd Matter of Caution to me and put me upon taking a narrower View of our Situation In consequence whereof at Night I plac'd a Centinel a Quarter of a Mile in the Rear and such o∣ther Centinels as I thought necessary and convenient in other Places with Orders that upon Sight of an Enemy the Centinel near should fire and that upon hearing that all the other Centinels as well as he should hasten in to strengthen our Main Guard  WHAT my Jealousy on my Landlord's Relation had suggested happen'd ac∣cordingly For about one in the Morning I was alarm'd with the Cry of one of my Centinels  Turn out for God's sake  which he repeated with Vehemence three or four times over I took the Alarm got up suddenly and with no little Difficulty got my Men into their Ranks when the Person  who made the Outcry came running in al∣most spent and out of Breath It was the Centinel that I had luckily plac'd about a Quarter of a Mile off who gave the Alarm and his Musket flashing in the Pan without going off he endeavour'd to supply with his Voice the Defect of his Piece I had just got my Men into their Ranks in order to re∣ceive the Enemy when by the Moonlight I discover'd a Party advancing upon us My out Centinel challeng'd 'em and as I had precaution'd they answer'd  Hispanioli  though I knew 'em to be  French  HOWEVER on my Survey of our Situa∣  ion by Daylight having mark'd in my Mind a proper Place for drawing up my Men in Case of an Attack which was too  arrow to admit of more than two on a  reast and which would secure between  s and the Enemy a Ditch of Water I re∣  lv'd to put in practice what had enter∣  in'd me so well in the Theory To that  urpose I order'd my first Rank to keep  eir Post stand still and face the Enemy  hile the other two Ranks stooping should  llow me to gain the intended Station  hich done the first Rank had Orders to  e off and fall behind All was perform'd  excellent Order and I confess it was  th no little Pleasure that I beheld the  emy for the best Part of an Hour in Con∣  tation whether they should attack us or  no The Result nevertheless of that Consultation ended in this that seeing us so well upon our Guard it was most ad∣viseable to draw off They soon put their Resolution into practice which I was very glad to see on Examination a little before having found that my Predecessor as in o∣ther Things had fail'd of Conduct in leaving me a Garrison without Ammunition  NEXT Morning I was very pleasingly surpriz'd with a handsome Present of Wine and some other necessary Refreshments At first I made a little Scruple and Hesitation whether or no to receive 'em till the Bearer assur'd me that they were sent me from the Officers of the next Garrison who had made me a Visit the Night before as a candid Acknowledgment of my Conduct and good Behaviour I return'd their Com∣pliment that I hop'd I should never receive Men of Honour otherwise than like a Man of Honour which mightily pleas'd them Every of which Particulars the  Ghent Ga∣zettier  the Week after publish'd  WE had little to do except Marching an  Countermarching all the Campaign after  till it was resolv'd in a Council of War fo  the better preserving of  Brussels  from suc  Insults as it had before sustain'd from th  French  during the Siege of  Namur  t  fortify  Anderlech  upon which our Regi¦ment as well as others were commande  from our more pacifick Posts to attend that Work Our whole Army was under Move∣ment to cover that Resolution and the Train fell to my Care and Command in the March There accompany'd the Train a Fellow seemingly ordinary yet very offi∣cious and courteous being ready to do any thing for any Person from the Officer to the common Soldier He travell'd along and mov'd with the Train sometimes on Foot and sometimes getting a Ride in some one or other of the Waggons but ever full of his Chitchat and Stories of Humour By these insinuating Ways he had screw'd himself into the general good Opinion but the Waggoners especially grew particularly fond of him At the End of our March all our PowderWaggons were plac'd breast abreast and so close that one miscarrying would leave little doubt of the Fate of all the rest This in the Camp we commonly call  the Park  and here it was that our new Guest like another  Phaeton  though under Pretence of Weariness not Ambi∣tion got Leave of the very last Carter to the Train to take a Nap in his Waggon One who had entertain'd a Jealousy of him and had watch'd him gave Information a∣gainst him  An Incen∣diary taken and burnt in the Face of the Army  upon which he was seiz'd and brought to me as Captain of the Guard I caus'd him to be search'd and upon search finding Match Touchwood and other  dangerous Materials upon him I sent him and them away to the Provoe Upon the Whole a Council of War was call'd at which upon a strict Examination he con∣fess'd himself a hir'd Incendiary and as such receiv'd his Sentence to be burnt in the Face of the Army The Execution was a Day or two after When on the very Spot he further acknowledg'd that on Sight or Noise of the Blow it had been concerted that the  French  Army should fall upon the Confederates under those lamentable Cir∣cumstances  Peace of  Riswick  THE Peace of  Riswick  soon after taking place put an End to all Incendiarisms of either Sort So that nothing of a Military Kind which was now become my Pro∣vince happen'd of some Years after Our Regiment was first order'd into  England  and presently after into  Ireland  But as these Memoirs are not design'd for the Low Amuzement of a TeaTable but rather of the Cabinet a Series of inglorious Inactivity can furnish but very little towards 'em  YET as little as I admir'd a Life of Inac∣tivity there are some Sorts of Activity to which a wise Man might almost give Su∣pineness the Preference Such is that of bare∣ly encountring Elements and wageing War with Nature and such in my Opinion would have been the spending my Commis∣sion and very probably my Life with it  in the  West Indies  For though the Climate as some would urge may afford a Chance for a very speedy Advance in Honour yet upon revolving in my Mind that those Ro∣tations of the Wheel of Fortune are often so very quick as well as uncertain that I my self might as well be the First as the Last the Whole of the Debate ended in somewhat like that Couplet of the excellent  Hudibras  Then he that ran away and fled  Must lie in Honour's Trucklebed  HOWEVER my better Planets soon dis∣annull'd those melancholy Ideas which a Rumour of our being sent into the  West Indies  had crowded my Head and Heart with For being call'd over into  England  upon the very Affairs of the Regiment I arriv'd there just after the Orders for their Transportation went over by which Means the Choice of going was put out of my Power and the Danger of Refusing which was the Case of many was very luckily avoided  IT being judg'd therefore impossible for me to return soon enough to gain my Passage one in Power propos'd to me that I should resign to an Officer then going over and with some other contingent Ad∣vantages to my great Satisfaction I was  put upon the Halfpay List This was more agreeable for I knew or at least imagin'd my self wise enough to foretel from the over hot Debate of the House of Commons upon the Partition Treaty that it could not be long before the present Peace would at least require patching  UNDER this Sort of uncertain Settlement I remain'd with the Patience of a  Jew  though not with Judaical Absurdity a faithful Adherer to my Expectation Nor did the Consequence fail of answering a War was apparent and soon after pro∣claim'd  War Pro∣claim'd  Thus waiting for an Opportunity which I flatter'd my self would soon present the little Diversions of  Dublin  and the mo∣derate Conversation of that People were not of Temptation enough to make my Stay in  England  look like a Burden  BUT though the War was proclaim'd and Preparations accordingly made for it the Expectations from all receiv'd a sudden Damp by the as sudden Death of King  William  K  William  dies  That Prince who had stared Death in the Face in many Sieges and Battles met with his Fate in the Midst of his Diversions who seiz'd his Prize in an Hour to human Thought the least adapted to it He was a Hunting his customary Diversion when by an unhappy Trip of his Horse he fell to the Ground and in the Fall displac'd his Collarbone The  News of it immediately alarm'd the Court and all around and the sad Effects of it soon after gave all  Europe  the like Alarm  France  only who had not disdain'd to seek it sooner by ungenerous Means receiv'd new Hope from what gave others Motives for Despair He flatter'd himself that that long liv'd Obstacle to his Ambition thus re∣mov'd his Successor would never fall into those Measures which he had wisely con∣certed for the Liberties of  Europe  but he as well as others of his Adherents was glo∣riously deceiv'd that Godlike Queen with a Heart entirely  English  prosecuted her royal Predecessor's Counsels and to remove all the very Faces of Jealousy im∣mediately on her Accession dispatch'd to every Court of the great Confederacy Per∣sons adequate to the Importance of the Mes∣sage to give Assurances thereof  THIS gave new Spirit to a Cause that at first seem'd to languish in its Founder as it struck its great Opposers with a no less mor∣tifying Terror And well did the great Suc∣cesses of her Arms answer the Prayers and Efforts of that royal Soul of the Confedera∣cies together with the Wishes of all that like her had the Good as well as the Ho∣nour of their Country at Heart in which the Liberties of  Europe  were included The first Campaign gave a noble Earnest of the Future  Bon Keyserwaert Venlo  and  Ruremond  were found Forerunners only of  Donawert Hochstet  and  Blenheim  Such a March of  English  Forces to the Support of the tottering Empire as it gloriously manifested the ancient Genius of a warlike People so was it happily celebrated with a Success answerable to the Glory of the Un∣dertaking which concluded in Statues and princely Donatives to an  English  Subject from the then only Emperor in  Europe  A small Tribute it's true for ransom'd Nations and captiv'd Armies which justly enough inverted the Exclamations of a  Ro∣man  Emperor to the  French  Monarch who deprecated his Legions lost pretty near the same Spot but to a much superior Num∣ber and on a much less glorious Occasion  BUT my good Fortune not allowing me to participate in those glorious Appendages of the  English  Arms in  Flanders  nor on the  Rhine  I was resolv'd to make a Push for it the first Opportunity and waste my Minutes no longer on Court Attendances And my Lord  Cutts  returning with his full Share of Laurels for his never to be forgot∣ten Services at  Venlo Ruremond  and  Hochstet  found his active Genius now to be repos'd under the less agreeable Burden of unhazardous Honour where Quiet must pro∣vide a Tomb for one already past any Dan∣ger of Oblivion deep Wounds and glo∣rious Actions having anticipated all that  could be said in Epitaphs or litteral Inscrip∣tions Soon after his Arrival from  Ger∣many  he was appointed General of all her Majesty's Forces in  Ireland  upon which going to congratulate him he was pleas'd to enquire of me several Things re∣lating to that Country and particularly in what Part of  Dublin  I would recom∣mend his Residence offering at the same time if I would go over with him all the Services that should fall in his Way  BUT Inactivity was a Thing I had too long lamented therefore after I had as decently as I could declin'd the latter Part I told his Lordship that as to a Place of Residence I was Master of a House in  Dublin  large enough and suitable to his great Quality which should be at his Ser∣vice on any Terms he thought fit Adding withal that I had a Mind to see  Spain  where my Lord  Peterborow  was now going and that if his Lordship would fa∣vour me with a Recommendation it would suit my present Inclinations much better than any further tedious Recess His Lord∣ship was so good to close with both my Overtures and spoke so effectually in my Favour that the Earl of  Peterborow  then General of all the Forces order'd on that Expedition bad me speedily prepare my self and so when all Things were ready I embarqu'd with that noble Lord for  Spain  to pursue his well concerted Under∣taking which in the Event will demon∣strate to the World that little Armies un∣der the Conduct of auspicious Generals may sometimes produce prodigious Effects  THE  Jews  in whatever Part of the World are a People industrious in the in∣creasing of  Mammon  and being accustom'd to the universal Methods of Gain are al∣ways esteem'd best qualify'd for any Under∣taking where that bears a Probability of be∣ing a Perquisite Providing Bread and other Requisites for an Army was ever allow'd to carry along with it a Profit answerable and  Spain  was not the first Country where that People had engag'd in such an Under∣taking Besides on any likely Appearance of great Advantage it is in the Nature as well as Practice of that Race strenuously to assist one another and that with the utmost Confidence and prodigious Alacrity One of that Number both competent and willing enough to carry on an Undertaking of that kind fortunately came at that Juncture to solicit the Earl of  Peterborow  to be em∣ploy'd as Proveditor to the Army and Troops which were or should be sent into  Spain  IT will easily be admitted that the Earl under his present Exigencies did not de∣cline to listen And a very considerable Sum being offer'd by way of Advance the  Method common in like Cases was pursu'd and the Sum propos'd accepted by which Means the Earl of  Peterborow  found him∣self put into the happy Capacity of pro∣ceeding upon his first concerted Project The Name of the  Jew  who sign'd the Contract was  Curtisos  and he and his Friends with great Punctuality advanc'd the expected Sum of One Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling or very near it which was immediately order'd into the Hands of the Paymaster of the Forces For though the Earl took Money of the  Jews  it was not for his own but publick Use Ac∣cording to Agreement Bills were drawn for the Value from  Lisbon  upon the Lord  Godolphin  then Lord Treasurer all which were on that Occasion punctually com∣ply'd with  THE Earl of  Peterborow  having thus fortunately found Means to supply himself with Money and by that with some Horse after he had obtain'd Leave of the Lord  Galoway  to make an Exchange of two Regiments of Foot receiv'd the ArchDuke and all those who would follow him aboard the Fleet and at his own Expense transported him and his whole Retinue to  Barcelona  For all which prodigious Charge as I have been very lately inform'd from very good Hands that noble Earl never to this Day receiv'd any Considera∣tion  from the Government or any Person whatsoever  WE sail'd from  Lisbon  in order to join the Squadron under Sir  Cloudsley Shovel  Meeting with which at the appointed Sta∣tion off  Tangier  the Men of War and Transports thus united made the best of their Way for  Gibraltar  There we stay'd no longer than to take aboard two Regi∣ments out of that Garrison in lieu of two out of our Fleet Here we found the Prince of  Hesse  who immediately took a Resolu∣tion to follow the ArchDuke in this Expe∣dition He was a Person of great Gallan∣try and having been ViceRoy of  Cata∣lonia  was receiv'd on board the Fleet with the utmost Satisfaction as being a Person capable of doing great Service in a Country where he was well known and as well be∣lov'd  SPEAKING  Latin  then pretty fluently it gave me frequent Opportunities of conver∣sing with the two Father Confessors of the Duke of  Austria  and upon that Account I found my self honour'd with some Share in the Favour of the ArchDuke himself I mention this not to gratify any vain Hu∣mour but as a corroborating Circumstance that my Opportunities of Information in Matters of Consequence could not thereby be suppos'd to be lessen'd but that I might more reasonably be imagin'd to arrive at  Intelligence that not very often or at least not so soon came to the Knowledge of o∣thers  FROM  Gibraltar  we sail'd to the Bay of  Altea  not far distant from the City of  Va∣lencia  in the Road of which we continu'd for some Days While we were there as I was very credibly inform'd the Earl of  Peterborow  met with some fresh Disap∣pointment but what it was neither I nor any Body else as far as I could perceive could ever dive into Neither did it appear by any outward Tokens in that noble Ge∣neral that it lay so much at his Heart as those about him seem'd to assure me it did  HOWEVER while we lay in  Altea  Bay two BombVessels and a small Squadron were order'd against  Denia  which had a small Castle but rather fine than strong And accordingly upon our Offer to bring to bear with our Cannon and preparing to fix our BombVessels in order to bombard the Place it surrender'd  Denia  sur∣renders and pro∣claims the ArchDuke K of  Spain  and acknowledg'd the ArchDuke as lawful King of  Spain  and so proclaim'd him From this time therefore speaking of that Prince it shall be under that Title General  Ramos  was left Commander here a Person who after∣wards acted a very extraordinary Part in the War carry'd on in the Kingdom of  Va∣lencia  BUT notwithstanding no positive Resolu∣tions had been taken for the Operations of the Campaign before the Arch Duke's Departure from  Lisbon  the Earl of  Peter∣borow  ever solicitous of the Honour of his Country had premeditated another Enter∣prize which had it been embrac'd would in all Probability have brought that War to a much more speedy Conclusion and at the same time have obviated all those Diffi∣culties which were but too apparent in the Siege of  Barcelona  He had justly and judiciously weigh'd that there were no Forces in the Middle Parts of  Spain  all their Trrops being in the extream Parts of the Kingdom either on the Frontiers of  Portugal  or in the City of  Barcelona  that with King  Philip  and the royal Fa∣mily at  Madrid  there were only some few Horse and those in a bad Condition and which only serv'd for Guards if therefore as he rightly projected within himself by the taking of  Valencia  or any SeaPort Town that might have secur'd his Landing he had march'd directly for  Madrid  what could have oppos'd him But I shall have occasion to dilate more upon this Head a few Pages hence and therefore shall here only say that though that Project of his might have brought about a speedy and wonderful Revolution what he was by his Orders afterwards oblig'd to against his In∣clinations  to pursue contributed much more to his great Reputation as it put him under a frequent Necessity of overcoming Difficulties which to any other General would have appear'd unsurmountable  Valencia  describ'd  VALENCIA  is a City towards the Centre of  Spain  to the Seaward seated in a rich and most populous Country just fifty Leagues from  Madrid  It abounds in Horses and Mules by reason of the great Fertility of its Lands which they can to great Advantage water when and as they please This City and Kingdom was as much inclin'd to the Interest of King  Charles  as  Catalonia  it self for even on our first Appearance great Numbers of People came down to the Bay of  Altea  with not only a bare Offer of their Services but loaded with all Manner of Provisions and loud Acclamations of  Viva Carlos tercero Viva  There were no regular Troops in any of the Places round about it or in the City it self The nearest were those few Horse in  Madrid  one hundred and fifty Miles distant nor any Foot nearer than  Barcelona  or the Frontiers of  Por∣tugal  Description of  Barce∣lona  ON the contrary  Barcelona  is one of the largest and most populous Cities in all  Spain  fortify'd with Bastions one Side thereof is secur'd by the Sea and the other by a strong Fortification call'd  Monjouick  The Place is of so large a Circumference that thirty thousand Men would scarce suffice to form the Lines of Circumvallation It once resisted for many Months an Army of that Force and is almost at the greatest Distance from  England  of any Place be∣longing to that  Monarchy  THIS short Description of these two Places will appear highly necessary if it be consider'd that no Person without it would be able to judge of the Design which the Earl of  Peterborow  intended to pursue when he first took the ArchDuke aboard the Fleet Nevertheless the Earl now found himself under a Necessity of quitting that noble Design upon his Receipt of Orders from  England  while he lay in the Bay of  Altea  to proceed directly to  Cata∣lonia  to which the ArchDuke as well as many Sea and Land Officers were most in∣clin'd and the Prince of  Hesse  more than all the rest  ON receiving those Orders the Earl of  Peterborow  seem'd to be of Opinion that from an Attempt which he thought under a Probability of Success he was condemn'd to undertake what was next to an Impossibi∣lity of effecting since nothing appear'd to him so injudicious as an Attempt upon  Barce∣lona  A Place at such a Distance from re∣ceiving any Reinforcement or Relief the only Place in which the  Spaniards  had a  Garrison of regular Forces and those in Number rather exceeding the Army he was to undertake the Siege with was enough to cool the Ardour of a Person of less Pene∣tration and Zeal than what the Earl had on all Occasions demonstrated Whereas if the General as he intended had made an immediate March to  Madrid  after he had secur'd  Valencia  and the Towns adja∣cent which were all ready to submit and declare for King  Charles  or if otherwise inclin'd had it not in their Power to make any considerable Resistance to which  f it be added that he could have had Mules  nd Horses immediately provided for him  n what Number he pleas'd together with Carriages necessary for Artillery Baggage an  Ammunition in few Days he could  ave forc'd King  Philip  out of  Madrid  where he had so little Force to oppose him And as there was nothing in his Way to  revent or obstruct his marching thither it  hard to conceive any other Part King  Philip  could have acted in such an Extre∣  ity than to retire either towards  Portu∣  al  or  Catalonia  In either of which Cases  e must have left all the middle Part of  Spain  en to the Pleasure of the Enemy who  the mean time would have had it in their  ower to prevent any Communication of  ose Bodies at such opposite Extreams of  e Country as were the Frontiers of  Por∣tugal  and  Barcelona  where only as I said before were any regular Troops  AND on the other Side as the Forces of the Earl of  Peterborow  were more than sufficient for an Attempt where there was so little Danger of Opposition so if their Army on the Frontiers of  Portugal  should have march'd back upon him into the Coun∣try either the  Portugueze  Army could have enter'd into  Spain  without Opposition or at worst supposing the General had been forc'd to retire his Retreat would have been easy and safe into those Parts of  Valencia  and  Andaluzia  which he pre∣viously had secur'd Besides  Gibraltar  the strongest Place in  Spain  if not in the whole World was already in our Posses∣sion and a great Fleet at Hand ready to give Assistance in all Places near the Sea From all which it is pretty apparent that in a little time the War on our Side might have been supported without entering the  Mediterranean  by which Means all Rein∣forcements would have been much nearer at Hand and the Expences of transporting Troops and Ammunition very considerably diminish'd  BUT none of these Arguments though every one of them is founded on solid Rea∣son were of Force enough against the pre∣vailing Opinion for an Attempt upon  Cata∣lonia  Mr  Crow  Agent for the Queen in  those Parts had sent into  England  most po∣sitive Assurances that nothing would be wanting if once our Fleet made an Invasion amongst the  Catalans  The Prince of  Hesse  likewise abounded in mighty Offers and pro∣digious Assurances all which enforc'd our Army to that Part of  Spain  and that gal∣lant Prince to those Attempts in which he lost his Life Very much against the Incli∣nation of our General who foresaw all those Difficulties which were no less evident after∣wards to every one and the Sense of which occasion'd those Delays and that Opposi∣tion to any Effort upon  Barcelona  which ran thro' so many successive Councils of War  HOWEVER pursuant to his Instructions from  England  the repeated Desires of the ArchDuke and the Importunities of the Prince of  Hesse  our General gave Orders to sail from  Altea  towards the Bay of  Barce∣lona  the chief City of  Catalonia  Earl of  Pe∣terborow  arrives in  Barcelona  Bay and after some time lands the Forces  Never∣theless when we arriv'd there he was very unwilling to land any of the Forces till he saw some Probability of that Assistance and Succour so much boasted of and so often promis'd But as nothing appear'd but some small Numbers of Men very indifferently arm'd and without either Gentlemen or Officers at the Head of them the Earl of  Peterborow  was of Opinion this could not be deem'd sufficient Encouragement for him to engage in an Enterprize which carry'd  so poor a Face of Probability of Success a∣long with it In answer to this it was urg'd that till a Descent was made and the Affairs thoroughly engag'd in it was not to be ex∣pected that any great Numbers would ap∣pear or that Persons of Condition would discover themselves Upon all which it was resolv'd the Troops should be landed  ACCORDINGLY our Forces were disem∣bark'd and immediately encamp'd not∣withstanding which the Number of Suc∣cours increas'd very slowly and that after the first straggling Manner Nor were those that did appear any way to be depended on coming when they thought fit and go∣ing away when they pleas'd and not to be brought under any regular Discipline It was then pretended that until they saw the Artillery landed as well as Forces they would not believe any Siege actually in∣tended This brought the General under a sort of Necessity of complying in that also Though certainly so to do must be allow'd a little unreasonable while the Majority in all Councils of War declar'd the Design to be impracticable and the Earl of  Peter∣borow  had positive Orders to proceed ac∣cording to such Majorities  AT last the Prince of  Hesse  was pleas'd to demand Pay for those Stragglers as Officers and Soldiers endeavouring to maintain that it could not be expected that Men  should venture their Lives for nothing Thus we came to  Catalonia  upon Assurances of universal Assistance but found when we came there that we were to have none un∣less we paid for it And as we were sent thither without Money to pay for any thing it had certainly been for us more tolerable to have been in a Country where we might have taken by Force what we could not ob∣tain any other Way  HOWEVER to do the  Miquelets  all pos∣sible Justice I must say that notwithstanding the Number of 'em which hover'd about the Place never much exceeded fifteen Hundred Men if sometimes more oftner less and though they never came under any Command but planted themselves where and as they pleas'd yet did they considerable Service in taking Possession of all the Country Houses and Convents that lay between the Hills and the Plain of  Barcelona  by means whereof they render'd it impossible for the Enemy to make any  Sorties  or Sallies at any Distance from the Town  AND now began all those Difficulties to bear which long before by the General had been apprehended The Troops had con∣tinu'd under a State of Inactivity for the Space of three Weeks all which was spent in perpetual Contrivances and Disputes a∣mongst our selves not with the Enemy In six several Councils of War the Siege of  Barcelona  under the Circumstances we then lay was rejected as a Madness and Impossibility And though the General and Brigadier  Stanhope  afterward Earl  Stan∣hope  consented to some Effort yet it was rather that some Effort should be made to sa∣tisfy the Expectation of the World than with any Hopes of Success However no Consent at all could be obtain'd from any Council of War and the  Dutch  General in particular declar'd that he would not obey even the Commands of the Earl of  Peter∣borow  if he should order the Sacrifice of the Troops under him in so unjustifiable a Manner without the Consent of a Council of War  AND yet all those Officers who refus'd their Consent to the Siege of  Barcelona  offer'd to march into the Country and at∣tempt any other Place that was not pro∣vided with so strong and numerous a Gar∣rison taking it for granted that no Town in  Catalonia Barcelona  excepted could make long Resistance and in case the Troops in that Garrison should pursue them they then might have an Opportunity of fighting them at less Disadvantage in the open Field than behind the Walls of a Place of such Strength And indeed should they have issu'd out on any such Design a Defeat of those Troops would have put the Province of  Catalonia  toge∣ther with the Kingdoms of  Aragon  and  Va∣lencia  into the Hands of King  Charles  more effectually than the taking of  Barcelona  it self  LET it be observ'd  en passant  that by those Offers of the Land Officers in a Coun∣cil of War it is easy to imagine what would have been the Success of our Troops had they march'd directly from  Valencia  to  Madrid  For if after two Months Alarm it was thought reasonable as well as prac∣ticable to march into the open Country rather than attempt the Siege of  Barcelona  where Forces equal if not superior in Num∣ber were ready to follow us at the Heels what might not have been expected from an Invasion by our Troops when and where they could meet with little Opposition But leaving the Consideration of what might have been I shall now endeavour at least with great Exactness to set down some of the most remarkable Events from our taking to the Relief of  Barcelona  THE repeated Refusals of the Councils of War for undertaking the Siege of so strong a Place with a Garrison so nume∣rous and those Refusals grounded upon such solid Reasons against a Design so rash reduc'd the General to the utmost Per∣plexity The Court of King  Charles  was immerg'd in complaint all belonging to him lamenting the hard Fate of that Prince to be brought into  Catalonia  only to return  again without the Offer of any one Effort in his Favour On the other Hand our own Officers and Soldiers were highly dissa∣tisfy'd that they were reproach'd because not dispos'd to enter upon and engage them∣selves in Impossibilities And indeed in the Manner that the Siege was propos'd and insisted upon by the Prince of  Hesse  in e∣very of the several Councils of War after the Loss of many Men thrown away to no other purpose but to avoid the Shame as the Expression ran of coming like Fools and going away like Cowards it could have ended in nothing but a Retreat at last  IT afforded but small Comfort to the Earl to have foreseen all these Difficulties and to have it in his Power to say that he would never have taken the ArchDuke on Board nor have propos'd to him the Hopes of a Recovery of the  Spanish  Monarchy from King  Philip  if he could have imagin'd it probable that he should not have been at liberty to pursue his own Design according to his own Judgment It must be allow'd very hard for him who had undertaken so great a Work and that without any Orders from the Government and by so doing could have had no Justification but by Suc∣cess I say it must be allow'd to be very hard after the Undertaking had been ap∣prov'd in  England  that he should find  himself to be directed in this Manner by those at a Distance upon ill grounded and confident Reports from Mr  Crow  and compell'd as it were though General to follow the Sentiments of Strangers who either had private Views of Ambition or had no immediate Care or Concern for the Troops employ'd in this Expedition  SUCH were the present unhappy Circum∣stanches of the Earl of  Peterborow  in the Camp before  Barcelona  Impossibilities pro∣pos'd no Expedients to be accepted a Court reproaching Councils of War re∣jecting and the  Dutch  General refusing the Assistance of the Troops under his Com∣mand and what surmounted all a Despair of bringing such Animosities and differing Opinions to any tolerable Agreement Yet all these Difficulties instead of discouraging the Earl set every Faculty of his more afloat and at last produc'd a lucky Thought which was happily attended with Events extraor∣dinary and Scenes of Success much beyond his Expectation such as the General him∣self was heard to confess it had been next to Folly to have look'd for as certainly  in prima facie  it would hardly have born proposing to take by Surprize a Place much stronger than  Barcelona  it self True it is that his only Hope of succeeding consisted in this That no Person could suppose such an Enterprize could enter into the Imagina∣tion  of Man and without doubt the Gene∣ral's chief Dependence lay upon what he found true in the Sequel that the Gover∣nor and Garrison of  Monjouick  by reason of their own Security would be very negli∣gent and very little upon their Guard  HOWEVER to make the Experiment he took an Opportunity unknown to any Person but an  Aid de Camp  that attended him and went out to view the Fortifica∣tions And there being no Horse in that strong Fortress and the  Miquelets  being possess'd of all the Houses and Gardens in the Plain it was not difficult to give him∣self that Satisfaction taking his Way by the Foot of the Hill The Observation he made of the Place it self the Negligence and Supineness of the Garrison together with his own uneasy Circumstances soon brought the Earl to a Resolution of putting his first Conceptions in Execution satis∣fy'd as he was from the Situation of the Ground between  Monjouick  and the Town that if the first was in our Possession the Siege of the latter might be undertaken with some Prospect of Success  FROM what has been said some may be apt to conclude that the Siege afterward succeeding when the Attack was made from the Side of  Monjouick  it had not been impossible to have prevail'd if the Effort had been made on the East Side of the  Town where our Forces were at first en∣camp'd and where only we could have made our Approaches if  Monjouick  had not been in our Power But a few Words will convince any of common Experience of the utter Impossibility of Success upon the East Part of the Town although many al∣most miraculous Accidents made us succeed when we brought our Batteries to bear upon that Part of  Barcelona  towards the West The Ground to the East was a perfect Level for many Miles which would have neces∣sitated our making our Approaches in a re∣gular Way and consequently our Men must have been expos'd to the full Fire of their whole Artillery Besides the Town is on that Side much stronger than any o∣ther there is an Outwork just under the Walls of the Town flank'd by the Cour∣tin and the Faces of two Bastions which might have cost us half our Troops to possess before we could have rais'd a Bat∣tery against the Walls Or supposing after all a competent Breach had been made what a wise Piece of Work must it have been to have attempted a Storm a∣gainst double the Number of regular Troops within  ON the contrary we were so favour'd by the Situation when we made the Attack from the Side of  Monjouick  that the Breach was made and the Town taken without  opening of Trenches or without our being at all incommoded by any Sallies of the Enemy as in truth they made not one du∣ring the whole Siege Our great Battery which consisted of upwards of fifty heavy Cannon supply'd from the Ships and ma∣nag'd by the Seamen were plac'd upon a Spot of rising Ground just large enough to contain our Guns with two deep hollow Ways on each Side the Field at each End whereof we had rais'd a little Redoubt which serv'd to preserve our Men from the Shot of the Town Those little Redoubts in which we had some Field Pieces flank'd the Battery and render'd it intirely secure from any Surprize of the Enemy There were several other smaller Batteries rais'd upon the Hills adjacent in Places not to be approach'd which in a manner render'd all the Artillery of the Enemy useless by reason their Men could not ply 'em but with the utmost Danger whereas ours were secure very few being kill'd and those mostly by random Shot  BUT to return to the General forc'd as he was to take this extraordinary Resolu∣tion he concluded the readiest Way to sur∣prize his Enemies was to elude his Friends He therefore call'd a Council of War ashore of the Land Officers and aboard of the Admirals and Sea Officers In both which it was resolv'd that in case the Siege of  Barcelona  was judg'd impracticable and that the Troops should be reimbark'd by a Day appointed an Effort should be made upon the Kingdom of  Naples  According∣ly the Day affix'd being come the heavy Artillery landed for the Siege was return'd aboard the Ships and every thing in ap∣pearance prepar'd for a Reimbarkment During which the General was oblig'd to undergo all the Reproaches of a dissatisfy'd Court and what was more uneasy to him the Murmurings of the Sea Officers who not so competent Judges in what related to Sieges were one and all inclin'd to a De∣sign upon  Barcelona  and the rather be∣cause as the Season was so far spent it was thought altogether improper to engage the Fleet in any new Undertaking However all Things were so well disguis'd by our seeming Preparations for a Retreat that the very Night our Troops were in March towards the Attack of  Monjouick  there were publick Entertainments and Rejoicings in the Town for the raising of the Siege  THE Prince of  Hesse  had taken large Li∣berties in complaining against all the Pro∣ceedings in the Camp before  Barcelona  even to Insinuations that though the Earl gave his Opinion for some Effort in publick yet us'd he not sufficient Authority over the other General Officers to incline them to com∣ply throwing out withal some Hints that the  General from the Beginning had declar'd himself in favour of other Operations and against coming to  Catalonia  the latter Part whereof was nothing but Fact On the other Side the Earl of  Peterborow  complain'd that the boasted Assistance was no way made good and that in failure thereof his Troops were to be sacrificed to the Humours of a Stranger one who had no Command and whose Conduct might bear a Question whether equal to his Cou∣rage These Reproaches of one another had bred so much ill Blood between those two great Men that for above a Fortnight they had no Correspondence nor ever ex∣chang'd one Word  The Earl marches to  Monjouick  THE Earl however having made his proper Dispositions and deliver'd out his Orders began his March in the Evening with twelve Hundred Foot and two Hun∣dred Horse which of necessity were to pass by the Quarters of the Prince of  Hesse  That Prince on their Appearance was told that the General was come to speak with him and being brought into his Apart∣ment the Earl acquainted him that he had at last resolv'd upon an Attempt against the Enemy adding that now if he pleas'd he might be a Judge of their Behaviour and see whether his Officers and Soldiers had deserv'd that Character which he had so liberally given 'em The Prince made  answer that he had always been ready to take his Share but could hardly believe that Troops marching that way could make any Attempt against the Enemy to satisfac∣tion However without further Discourse he call'd for his Horse  BY this we may see what Share Fortune has in the greatest Events In all probabi∣lity the Earl of  Peterborow  had never en∣gag'd in such a dangerous Affair in cold Blood and unprovok'd and if such an En∣terprize had been resolv'd on in a regular Way it is very likely he might have given the Command to some of the General Officers since it is not usual nor hardly allowable for one that commands in chief to go in Person on such kind of Services But here we see the General and Prince notwithstanding their late indifferent Har∣mony engag'd together in this most de∣sperate Undertaking  BRIGADIER  Stanhope  and Mr  Methuen  now Sir  Paul  were the General's parti∣cular Friends and those he most consulted and most confided in yet he never imparted this Resolution of his to either of them for he was not willing to engage them in a Design so dangerous and where there was so little Hope of Success rather choosing to reserve them as Persons most capable of giving Advice and Assistance in the Confu∣sion great enough already which yet must  have been greater if any Accident had hap∣pen'd to himself And I have very good Reason to believe that the Motive which mainly engag'd the Earl of  Peterborow  in this Enterprize was to satisfy the Prince of  Hesse  and the World that his Diffidence proceeded from his Concern for the Troops committed to his Charge and not for his own Person On the other Hand the great Characters of the two Gentlemen just men∣tion'd are so well known that it will easily gain Credit that the only Way the Gene∣ral could take to prevent their being of the Party was to conceal it from them as he did from all Mankind even from the ArchDuke himself And certainly there never was a more universal Surprize than when the firing was heard next Morning from  Monjouick  BUT I now proceed to give an exact Ac∣count of this great Action of which no Per∣son that I have heard of ever yet took upon him to deliver to Posterity the glorious Par∣ticulars and yet the Consequences and Events by what follows will appear so great and so very extraordinary that few  if any had they had it in their Power  would have deny'd themselves the Pleasure or the World the Satisfaction of knowing it  THE Troops which march'd all Nigh  along the Foot of the Mountains arriv'  two Hours before Day under the Hill of  Monjouick  not a Quarter of a Mile from the outward Works For this Reason it was taken for granted whatever the De∣sign was which the General had propos'd to himself that it would be put in Execution before Daylight but the Earl of  Peter∣borow  was now pleas'd to inform the Officers of the Reasons why he chose to stay till the Light appear'd He was of opinion that any Success would be impos∣sible unless the Enemy came into the out∣ward Ditch under the Bastions of the second Enclosure but that if they had time al∣low'd them to come thither there being no Palisadoes our Men by leaping in upon them after receipt of their first Fire might drive 'em into the upper Works and fol∣lowing them close with some Probability might force them under that Confusion in∣to the inward Fortifications  SUCH were the General's Reasons then and there given after which having promis'd ample Rewards to such as discharg'd their Duty well a Lieutenant with thirty Men was order'd to advance towards the Bastion nearest the Town and a Captain with fifty Men to support him After the Ene∣my's Fire they were to leap into the Ditch and their Orders were to follow 'em close if they retir'd into the upper Works Never∣theless not to pursue 'em farther if they  made into the inner Fort but to endeavour to cover themselves within the Gorge of the Bastion  A LIEUTENANT and a Captain with the like Number of Men and the same Orders were commanded to a DemiBastion at the Extremity of the Fort towards the West which was above MusketShot from the in∣ward Fortification Towards this Place the Wall which was cut into the Rock was not fac'd for about twenty Yards and here our own Men got up where they found three Pieces of Cannon upon a Plat∣form without any Men to defend them  THOSE appointed to the Bastion towards the Town were sustain'd by two hundred Men with which the General and Prince went in Person The like Number under the Directions of Colonel  Southwell  were to sustain the Attack towards the West and about five hundred Men were left under the Command of a  Dutch  Colonel whose Orders were to assist where in his own Judgment he should think most proper and these were drawn up between the two Parties appointed to begin the Assault My Lot was on the Side where the Prince and Earl were in Person and where we su∣stain'd the only Loss from the first Fire of the Enemy  OUR Men though quite expos'd and though the Glacis was all escarp'd upon the  live Rock went on with an undaunted Courage  Confede∣rate Army attack  Monjouick  and immediately after the first Fire of the Enemy all that were not kill'd or wounded leap'd in  pelmel  a∣mongst the Enemy who being thus boldly attack'd and seeing others pouring in upon 'em retir'd in great Confusion and some one Way some another ran into the inward Works  THERE was a large Port in the Flank of the principal Bastion towards the NorthEast and a cover'd Way through which the General and the Prince of  Hesse  follow'd the flying Forces and by that Means be∣came possess'd of it Luckily enough here lay a Number of great Stones in the Gorge of the Bastion for the Use of the Fortifi∣cation with which we made a Sort of BreastWork before the Enemy recover'd of their Amaze or made any considerable Fire upon us from their inward Fort which commanded the upper Part of that Bastion  WE were afterwards inform'd that the Commander of the Citadel expecting but one Attack had call'd off the Men from the most distant and western Part of the Fort to that Side which was next the Town upon which our Men got into a DemiBastion in the most extream Part of the Fortification Here they got Possession of three Pieces of Cannon with hardly any Opposition and had Leisure to cast up a little Retrenchment  and to make use of the Guns they had taken to defend it Under this Situation the Enemy when drove into the inward Fort were expos'd to our Fire from those Places we were possess'd of in case they offer'd to make any Sally or other Attempt against us Thus we every Moment became better and better prepar'd against any Effort of the Garrison And as they could not pretend to assail us without evident Hazard so no∣thing remain'd for us to do till we could bring up our Artillery and Mortars Now it was that the General sent for the thousand Men under Brigadier  Stanhope  's Command which he had posted at a Convent half way between the Town and  Monjouick  THERE was almost a total Cessation of Fire the Men on both Sides being under Cover The General was in the upper Part of the Bastion the Prince of  Hesse  be∣low behind a little Work at the Point of the Bastion whence he could only see the Heads of the Enemy over the Parapet of the inward Fort Soon after an Accident happen'd which cost that gallant Prince his Life  THE Enemy had Lines of Communica∣tion between  Barcelona  and  Monjouick  The Governor of the former upon hearing the firing from the latter immediately sent four hundred Dragoons on Horseback un∣der Orders that two Hundred dismounting  should reinforce the Garrison and the other two Hundred should return with their Horses back to the Town  WHEN those two Hundred Dragoons were accordingly got into the inward Fort unseen by any of our Men the  Spaniards  waving their Hats over their Heads re∣peated over and over  Viva el Rey Viva  This the Prince of  Hesse  unfortunately took for a Signal of their Desire to surrender Upon which with too much Warmth and Precipitancy calling to the Soldiers fol∣lowing  They surrender they surrender  he advanc'd with near three Hundred Men who follow'd him without any Orders from their General along the Curtain which led to the Ditch of the inward Fort  Two Hun∣dred Men taken by the  Spa∣niards  The E∣nemy suffer'd them to come into the Ditch and there surrounding 'em took two Hun∣dred of them Prisoners at the same time making a Discharge upon the rest who were running back the Way they came This firing brought the Earl of  Peterborow  down from the upper Part of the Bastion to see what was doing below When he had just turn'd the Point of the Bastion he saw the Prince of  Hesse  retiring with the Men that had so rashly advanc'd  The Prince of  Hesse  kill'd  The Earl had ex∣chang'd a very few Words with him when from a second Fire that Prince receiv'd a Shot in the great Artery of the Thigh of which he died immediately falling down  at the General's Feet who instantly gave Orders to carry off the Body to the next Convent  ALMOST the same Moment an Officer came to acquaint the Earl of  Peterborow  that a great Body of Horse and Foot at least three Thousand were on their March from  Barcelona  towards the Fort The Distance is near a Mile all uneven Ground so that the Enemy was either discoverable or not to be seen just as they were marching on the Hills or in the Vallies However the General directly got on Horseback to take a View of those Forces from the rising Ground without the Fort having left all the Posts which were already taken well secur'd with the allotted Numbers of Officers and Soldiers  BUT the Event will demonstrate of what Consequence the Absence or Presence of one Man may prove on great Occasions No sooner was the Earl out of the Fort the Care of which he had left under the Command of the Lord  Charlemont  a Person of known Merit and undoubted Courage but some∣what too flexible in his Temper when a panick Fear tho' the Earl as I have said was only gone to take a View of the E∣nemy seiz'd upon the Soldiery which was a little too easily comply'd with by the Lord  Charlemont  then commanding Officer True it is for I heard an Officer ready  enough to take such Advantages urge to him that none of all those Posts we were become Masters of were tenable that to offer at it would be no better than wilfully sacrificing human Lives to Caprice and Hu∣mour and just like a Man's knocking his Head against Stone Walls to try which was hardest Having overheard this Piece of LipOratory and finding by the Answer that it was too likely to prevail and that all I was like to say would avail nothing I slipt away as fast as I could to acquaint the General with the Danger impending  AS I pass'd along I took notice that the Panick was upon the Increase the ge∣neral Rumor affirming that we should be all cut off by the Troops that were come out of  Barcelona  if we did not immediately gain the Hills or the Houses possess'd by the  Miquelets  Officers and Soldiers under this prevailing Terror quitted their Posts and in one united Body the Lord  Charle∣mont  at the Head of them march'd or rather hurry'd out of the Fort and were come half way down the Hill before the Earl of  Peterborow  came up to them Though on my acquainting him with the shameful and surprizing Accident he made no Stay but answering with a good deal of Vehemence  Good God is it possible  hasten'd back as fast as he could  I NEVER thought my self happier than in this Piece of Service to my Country I confess I could not but value it as having been therein more than a little instrumental in the glorious Successes which succeeded since immediately upon this Notice from me the Earl gallop'd up the Hill and light∣ing when he came to Lord  Charlemont  he took his HalfPike out of his Hand and turning to the Officers and Soldiers told them if they would not face about and follow him they should have the Scandal and eternal Infamy upon them of having de∣serted their Posts and abandon'd their Ge∣neral  IT was surprizing to see with what Ala∣crity and new Courage they fac'd about and follow'd the Earl of  Peterborow  In a Moment they had forgot their Apprehen∣sions and without doubt had they met with any Opposition they would have be∣hav'd themselves with the greatest Bravery But as these Motions were unperceiv'd by the Enemy all the Posts were regain'd and anew possess'd in less than half an Hour without any Loss Though had our Forces march'd half Musketshot farther their Re∣treat would have been perceiv'd and all the Success attendant on this glorious At∣tempt must have been intirely blasted  ANOTHER Incident which attended this happy Enterprize was this The two hun∣dred  Men which fell into the Hands of the Enemy by the unhappy Mistake of the Prince of  Hesse  were carry'd directly into the Town The Marquiss of  Risburg  a LieutenantGeneral who commanded the three thousand Men which were marching from the Town to the Relief of the Fort examin'd the Prisoners as they pass'd by and they all agreeing that the General and the Prince of  Hesse  were in Person with the Troops that made the Attack on  Monjouick  the Marquiss gave immediate Orders to re∣tire to the Town taking it for granted that the main Body of the Troops attended the Prince and General and that some De∣sign therefore was on foot to intercept his Return in case he should venture too far Thus the unfortunate Loss of our two hun∣dred Men turn'd to our Advantage in pre∣venting the Advance of the Enemy which must have put the Earl of  Peterborow  to in∣conceivable Difficulties  THE Body of one Thousand under Brigadier  Stanhope  being come up to  Mon∣jouick  and no Interruption given us by the Enemy our Affairs were put into very good Order on this Side while the Camp on the other Side was so fortify'd that the Enemy during the Siege never made one Effort against it In the mean time the Communication between the two Camps was secure enough although our Troops  were oblig'd to a tedious March along the Foot of the Hills whenever the General thought fit to relieve those on Duty on the Side of the Attack from those Regiments encamp'd on the West Side of  Barcelona  THE next Day after the Earl of  Peter∣borow  had taken Care to secure the first Camp to the Eastward of the Town he gave Orders to the Officers of the Fleet to land the Artillery and Ammunition behind the Fortress to the Westward Immediate∣ly upon the Landing whereof two Mortars were fix'd from both which we ply'd the Fort of  Monjouick  furiously with our Bombs But the third or fourth Day one of our Shells fortunately lighting on their Maga∣zine of Powder blew it up  Magazine of  Mon∣jouick  blown up and the Fortress taken  and with it the Governor and many principal Officers who were at Dinner with him The Blast at the same Instant threw down a Face of one of the smaller Bastions which the vigilant  Mi∣quelets  ready enough to take all Advantages no sooner saw for they were under the Hill very near the Place but they readily enter'd while the Enemy were under the utmost Confusion If the Earl no less watchful than they had not at the same Moment thrown himself in with some regu∣lar Troops and appeas'd the general Dis∣order in all probability the Garrison had been put to the Sword However the Ge∣neral's Presence not only allay'd the Fury of  the  Miquelets  but kept his own Troops under strictest Discipline So that in a happy Hour for the frighted Garrison the Gene∣ral gave Officers and Soldiers Quarters making them Prisoners of War  HOW critical was that Minute wherein the General met his retreating Commander a very few Steps farther had excluded us our own Conquests to the utter Loss of all those greater Glories which ensu'd Nor would that have been the worst for be∣sides the Shame attending such an ill con∣certed Retreat from our Acquests on  Mon∣jouick  we must have felt the accumulative Disgrace of infamously retiring aboard the Ships that brought us but Heaven reserv'd for our General amazing Scenes both of Glory and Mortification  I CANNOT here omit one Singularity of Life which will demonstrate Men's different Way of Thinking if not somewhat worse when many Years after to one in Office who seem'd a little too deaf to my Com∣plaints and by that Means irritating my human Passions in Justice to my self as well as Cause I urg'd this Piece of Service by which I not only preserv'd the Place but the Honour of my Country that  Mi∣nister petite  to mortify my Expectations and baffle my Plea with a Grimace as odd as his Logick return'd that in his Opinion the Service pretended was a Disservice to  the Nation since Perseverance had cost the Government more Money than all our Con∣quests were worth could we have kept 'em So irregular are the Conceptions of Man when even great Actions thwart the Bent of an interested Will  THE Fort of  Monjouick  being thus sur∣prizingly reduc'd furnish'd a strange Viva∣city to Mens Expectations and as extrava∣gantly flatter'd their Hopes for as Success never fails to excite weaker Minds to pursue their good Fortune though many times to their own Loss so is it often too apt to push on more elevated Spirits to renew the En∣counter for atchieving new Conquests by hazarding too rashly all their former Glory Accordingly every Body now began to make his utmost Efforts and look'd upon himself as a Drone if he was not employ'd in doing something or other towards pushing forward the Siege of  Barcelona  it self and raising proper Batteries for that Purpose  But after all it must in Justice be ac∣knowledg'd that notwithstanding this pro∣digious Success that attended this bold En∣terprize the Land Forces of themselves  without the Assistance of the Sailors could never have reduc'd the Town The Com∣manders and Officers of the Fleet had al∣ways evinc'd themselves Favourers of the Project upon  Barcelona  A new Under∣taking so late in the Year as I have sai  before was their utter Aversion and what they hated to hear of Elated therefore with a Beginning so auspicious they gave a more willing Assistance than could have been ask'd or judiciously expected The Admirals forgot their Element and acted as General Officers at Land They came every Day from their Ships with a Body of Men form'd into Companies and regu∣larly marshall'd and commanded by Cap∣tains and Lieutenants of their own Cap∣tain  Littleton  in particular one of the most advanc'd Captains in the whole Fleet offer'd of himself to take care of the Landing and Conveyance of the Artillery to the Camp And answerable to that his first Zeal was his Vigour all along for finding it next to an Impossibility to draw the Cannon and Mortars up such vast Precipices by Horses if the Country had afforded them he caus'd Harnesses to be made for two hundred Men and by that Means after a prodigious Fa∣tigue and Labour brought the Cannon and Mortars necessary for the Siege up to the very Batteries  Barcelona  besieg'd  IN this Manner was the Siege begun nor was it carry'd on with any less Application the Approaches being made by an Army of Besiegers that very little if at all exceed∣ed the Number of the Besieg'd not alto∣gether in a regular Manner our few Forces would not admit it but yet with Regula∣rity  enough to secure our two little Camps and preserve a Communication between both not to be interrupted or incommoded by the Enemy We had soon erected three several Batteries against the Place all on the West Side of the Town  viz  one of nine Guns another of Twelve and the last of upwards of Thirty From all which we ply'd the Town incessantly and with all imaginable Fury and very often in whole Vollies  NEVERTHELESS it was thought not only adviseable but necessary to erect another Battery upon a lower Piece of Ground un∣der a small Hill which lying more within Reach and opposite to those Places where the Walls were imagin'd weakest would annoy the Town the more and being de∣sign'd for six Guns only might soon be per∣fected A  French  Engeneer had the Direc∣tion and indeed very quickly perfected it But when it came to be consider'd which way to get the Cannon to it most were o  opinion that it would be absolutely imprac∣ticable by reason of the vast Descent tho  I believe they might have added a stronge  Reason and perhaps more intrinsick that i  was extremely expos'd to the Fire of th  Enemy  HAVING gain'd some little Reputatio  in the Attack of  Monjouick  this Difficulty was at last to be put upon me and as som  not my Enemies suppos'd more out of Envy than good Will However when I came to the Place and had carefully taken a View of it though I was sensible enough of the Difficulty I made my main Objection as to the Time for accomplishing it for it was then between Nine and Ten and the Guns were to be mounted by Daylight Neither could I at present see any other Way to answer their Expectations than by casting the Cannon down the Precipice at all Hazards to the Place below where that fourth Battery was erected  THIS wanted not Objections to and therefore to answer my Purpose as to point of Time sixty Men more were order'd me as much as possible to facilitate the Work by Numbers and accordingly I set about it Just as I was setting all Hands to work and had given Orders to my Men to begin some Paces back to make the Descent more gradual and thereby render the Task a little more feasible Major  Collier  who commanded the Train came to me and perceiving the Difficulties of the Under∣taking in a Fret told me I was impos'd upon and vow'd he would go and find out Brigadier  Petit  and let him know the Im∣possibility as well as the Unreasonableness of the Task I was put upon He had scarce utter'd those Words and turn'd himself round to perform his Promise when an un∣lucky  Shot with a MusketBall wounded him through the Shoulder upon which he was carry'd off and I saw him not till some con∣siderable time after  BY the painful Diligence and the addi∣tional Compliment of Men however I so well succeeded such was my great good Fortune that the Way was made and the Guns by the Help of Fascines and other lesser Preparations below safely let down and mounted so that that fourth Battery began to play upon the Town before Break of Day and with all the Success that was propos'd  IN short the Breach in a very few Days after was found wholly practicable and all Things were got ready for a general Storm  Governor of  Barcelona  beats a Parley and agrees to surrender in three Days  Which Don  Valasco  the Governor being sensible of immediately beat a Parley upon which it was among other Articles con∣cluded that the Town should be surren∣der'd in three Days and the better to en∣sure it the Bastion which commanded the Port St  Angelo  was directly put into our Possession  BUT before the Expiration of the limited three Days a very unexpected Accident fell out which hasten'd the Surrender Don  Valasco  during his Government had behav'd himself very arbitrarily and there∣by procur'd as the Consequence of it a large Proportion of ill will not only among the  Townsmen but among the  Miquelets  who had in their Zeal to King  Charles  flock'd from all Parts of  Catalonia  to the Siege of their Capital and who on the Signing of the Articles of Surrender had found various Ways being well acquainted with the most private Avenues to get by Night into the Town So that early in the Morning they began to plunder all that they knew Ene∣mies to King  Charles  or thought Friends to the Prince his Competitor  THEIR main Design was upon  Valasco  the Governor whom if they could have got into their Hands it was not to be que∣stion'd but as far as his Life and Limbs would have serv'd they would have suffi∣ciently satiated their Vengeance upon He expected no less and therefore concealed himself till the Earl of  Peterborow  could give Orders for his more safe and private Conveyance by Sea to  Alicant  NEVERTHELESS in the Town all was in the utmost Confusion which the Earl of  Peterborow  at the very first hearing hasten'd to appease with his usual Alacrity he rid all alone to Port St  Angelo  where at that time my self happen'd to be and de∣manding to be admitted the Officer of the Guard under Fear and Surprise open'd the Wicket through which the Earl enter'd and I after him  SCARCE had we gone a hundred Paces when we saw a Lady of apparent Quality and indisputable Beauty in a strange but most affecting Agony flying from the ap∣prehended Fury of the  Miquelets  her lovely Hair was all flowing about her Shoulders which and the Consternation she was in rather added to than any thing diminish'd from the Charms of an Excess of Beauty She as is very natural to People in Distress made up directly to the Earl her Eyes satisfying her he was a Per∣son likely to give her all the Protection she wanted And as soon as ever she came near enough in a Manner that declar'd her Quality before she spoke she crav'd that Protection telling him the better to se∣cure it who it was that ask'd it But the generous Earl presently convinc'd her he wanted no Intreaties having before he knew her to be the Dutchess of  Popoli  taken her by the Hand in order to convey her through the Wicket which he enter'd at to a Place of Safety without the Town  I STAY'D behind while the Earl con∣vey'd the distress'd Dutchess to her requested  Asylum  and I believe it was much the longest Part of an Hour before he return'd But as soon as ever he came back he and my self at his Command repair'd to the Place of most Confusion which the extra∣ordinary Noise full readily directed us to  and which happen'd to be on the Parade be∣fore the Palace There it was that the  Miquelets  were making their utmost Efforts to get into their Hands the almost sole Occa∣sion of the Tumult and the Object of their raging Fury the Person of Don  Valasco  the late Governor  IT was here that the Earl preserv'd that Governor from the violent but perhaps too just Resentments of the  Miquelets  and as I said before convey'd him by Sea to  Ali∣cant  And indeed I could little doubt the Effect or be any thing surpriz'd at the Easiness of the Task when I saw that wherever he appear'd the popular Fury was in a Moment allay'd and that every Di∣ctate of that General was assented to with the utmost Chearfulness and Deference  Valasco  before his Embarkment had given Orders in Gratitude to his Preserver for all the Gates to be deliver'd up tho' short of the stipulated Term and they were according∣ly so deliver'd and our Troops took Posses∣sion so soon as ever that Governor was a∣board the Ship that was to convey him to  Alicant  DURING the Siege of  Barcelona  Bri∣gadier  Stanhope  order'd a Tent to be pitch'd as near the Trenches as possibly could be with Safety where he not only entertain'd the chief Officers who were upon Duty but likewise the  Catalonian  Gentlemen who  brought  Miquelets  to our Assistance I re∣member I saw an old Cavalier having his only Son with him who appear'd a fine young Gentleman about twenty Years of Age go into the Tent in order to dine with the Brigadier But whilst they were at Dinner an unfortunate Shot came from the Bastion of St  Antonio  and intirely struck off the Head of the Son The Fa∣ther immediately rose up first looking down upon his headless Child and then lifting up his Eyes to Heaven whilst the Tears ran down his Cheeks he cross'd himself and only said  Fiat voluntas tua  and bore it with a wonderful Patience 'Twas a sad Spectacle and truly it affects me now whilst I am writing  THE Earl of  Peterborow  tho' for some time after the Revolution he had been em∣ploy'd in civil Affairs return'd to the mili∣tary Life with great Satisfaction which was ever his Inclination Brigadier  Stanhope  who was justly afterwards created an Earl did well deserve this Motto  Tam Marte quam Mercurio  for truly he behav'd all the time he continu'd in  Spain  as if he had been in∣spir'd with Conduct for the Victory at  Al∣manar  was intirely owing to him and likewise at the Battle of  Saragosa  he distin∣guish'd himself with great Bravery That he had not Success at  Bruhega  was not his Fault for no Man can resist Fate for 'twas  decreed by Heaven that  Philip  should re∣main King of  Spain  and  Charles  to be Em∣peror of  Germany  Yet each of these Mo∣narchs have been ungrateful to the Instru∣ments which the Almighty made use of to preserve them upon their Thrones for one had not been King of  Spain  but for  France  and the other had not been Emperor but for  England  Barcelona  the chief Place in  Catalonia  being thus in our Hands as soon as the Garrison little inferior to our Army had march'd out with Drums beating Colours flying  c  according to the Articles  Charles  the Third made his publick Entry and was proclaim'd King and receiv'd with the general Acclamations and all other Demonstrations of Joy suitable to that great Occasion  Publick Rejoycings  SOME Days after which the Citizens far from being satiated with their former Demonstrations of their Duty sent a Peti∣tion to the King by proper Deputies for that Purpose appointed desiring Leave to give more ample Instances of their Affections in a publick  Cavalcade  The King granted their Request and the Citizens pursuant thereto made their Preparations  ON the Day appointed the King plac'd in a Balcony belonging to the House of the Earl of  Peterborow  appear'd ready to ho∣nour the Show The Ceremonial to speak  nothing figuratively was very fine and grand Those of the first Rank made their Appearance in decent Order and upon fine Horses and others under Arms and in Companies march'd with native Gravity and Grandeur all saluting his Majesty as they pass'd by after the  Spanish  Manner which that Prince return'd with the Move∣ment of his Hand to his Mouth for the Kings of  Spain  are not allow'd to salute or return a Salute by any Motion to or of the Hat  AFTER these follow'd several Pageants the first of which was drawn by Mules set off to the Height with stateliest Feathers and adorn'd with little Bells Upon the Top of this Pageant appear'd a Man dress'd all in Green but in the Likeness of a Dragon The Pageant making a Stop just overagainst the Balcony where the King sate the Dra∣gonical Representative diverted him with great Variety of Dancings the Earl of  Pe∣terborow  all the time throwing out Dollars by Handfuls among the Populace which they as constantly receiv'd with the loud Acclamation and repeated Cries of  Viva Viva Carlos Terceros Viva la Casa d' Austria  WHEN that had play'd its Part another Pageant drawn as before made a like full Stop before the same Balcony On this was plac'd a very large Cage or Aviary the  Cover of which by Springs contriv'd for that Purpose immediately flew open and out of it a surprizing Flight of Birds of va∣rious Colours These all amaz'd at their sudden Liberty which I took to be the Emblem intended hover'd a considerable space of time over and about their Place of Freedom chirping singing and otherwise testifying their mighty Joy for their so un∣expected Enlargement  THERE were many other Pageants but having little in them very remarkable I have forgot the Particulars Nevertheless every one of them was dismiss'd with the like Acclamations of  Viva Viva  the Whole concluding with Bonfires and Illu∣minations common on all such Occasions  I CANNOT here omit one very remark∣able Instance of the Catholick Zeal of that Prince which I was soon after an Eyewitness of I was at that time in the FruitMarket when the King passing by in his Coach the Host whether by Accident or Contrivance I cannot say was brought at that very Juncture out of the great Church in order as I after understood to a poor sick Woman's receiving the Sacrament On Sight of the Host the King came out of his Coach kneel'd down in the Street which at that time prov'd to be very dirty till the Host pass'd by then rose up and taking the lighted Flambeau from him who  bore it he follow'd the Priest up a streight nasty Alley and there up a dark ordinary Pair of Stairs where the poor sick Woman lay There he stay'd till the whole Cere∣mony was over when returning to the Door of the Church he very faithfully re∣stor'd the lighted Flambeau to the Fellow he had taken it from the People all the while crying out  Viva Viva  an Acclamation we may imagine intended to his Zeal as well as his Person  ANOTHER remarkable Accident of a much more moral Nature I must in justice to the Temperance of that in this truly inimitable People recite I was one Day walking in one of the most populous Streets of that City where I found an uncommon Concourse of People of all Sorts got to∣gether and imagining so great a Croud could not be assembled on a small Occasion I prest in among the rest and after a good deal of Struggling and Difficulty reach'd into the Ring and Centre of that mix'd Mul∣titude But how did I blush with what Confusion did I appear when I found one of my own Countrymen a drunken Grana∣dier the attractive Loadstone of all that high and low Mob and the Butt of all their Merriment It will be easily imagin'd to be a Thing not a little surprizing to one of our Country to find that a drunken Man should be such a wonderful Sight How∣ever  the witty Sarcasms that were then by high and low thrown upon that senseless Creature and as I interpreted Matters me in him were so pungent that if I did not curse my Curiosity I thought it best to withdraw my self as fast as Legs could carry me away  BARCELONA  being now under King  Charles  the Towns of  Gironne Tarragona Tortosa  and  Lerida  immediately declar'd for him To every one of which Enge∣neers being order'd it was my Lot to be sent to  Tortosa  This Town is situated on the Side of the River  Ebro  over which there is a fair and famous Bridge of Boats The Waters of this River are always of a dirty red Colour somewhat fouler than our Moorish Waters yet is it the only Water the Inhabitants drink or covet to drink and every House providing for its own Con∣venience Cisterns to preserve it in by a few Hours standing it becomes as clear as the clearest Rockwater but as soft as Milk In short for Softness Brightness and Pleasantness of Taste the Natives pre∣fer it to all the Waters in the World And I must declare in favour of their Opinion that none ever pleas'd me like it  THIS Town was of the greater Moment to our Army as opening a Passage into the Kingdom of  Valencia  on one Side and the Kingdom of  Arragon  on the other And be∣ing  of it self tolerably defensible in human Appearance might probably repay a little Care and Charge in its Repair and Improve∣ment Upon this Employ was I appointed and thus was I busy'd till the Arrival of the Earl of  Peterborow  with his little Army in order to march to  Valencia  the Capital of that Province Here he left in Garrison Colonel  Hans Hamilton  's Regiment the Place nevertheless was under the Com∣mand of a  Spanish  Governor appointed by King  Charles  WHILE the Earl stay'd a few Days at this Place under Expectation of the promis'd Succours from  Barcelona  he re∣ceiv'd  a Proprio  or Express from the King of  Spain  full of Excuses instead of Forces And yet the very same Letter in a paradoxical Manner commanded him at all Events to attempt the Relief of  Santo Mattheo  where Colonel  Jones  commanded and which was then under Siege by the  Conde de los Torres  as was the Report with upwards of three thousand Men The Earl of  Peterborow  could not muster above one thousand Foot and about two hundred Horse a small Force to make an Attempt of that Nature upon such a superior Power Yet the Earl's Vivacity as will be occa∣sionally further observ'd in the Course of these Memoirs never much regarded Num∣bers so there was but room by any Stra∣tagem  to hope for Success True it is for his greater Encouragement and Consolation the same Letter intimated that a great Concourse of the Country People being up in Arms to the Number of many Thou∣sands in Favour of King  Charles  and wanting only Officers the Enterprize would be easy and unattended with much Danger But upon mature Enquiry the Earl found that great Body of Men all  in nubibus  and that the  Conde  in the plain Truth of the Matter was much stronger than the Letter at first represented  SANTO Mattheo  was a Place of known Importance and that from its Situation which cut off all Communication between  Catalonia  and  Valencia  and consequently should it fall into the Hands of the Enemy the Earl's Design upon the latter must inevi∣tably have been postpon'd It must be granted the Commands for attempting the Relief of it were pressing and peremptory nevertheless the Earl was very conscious to himself that as the promis'd Reinforce∣ments were suspended his Officers would not approve of the Attempt upon the Foot of such vast Inequalities and their own de∣clar'd Sentiments soon confirm'd the Dictates of the Earl's Reason He therefore ad∣dresses himself to those Officers in a different Manner He told 'em he only desir'd they would be passive and leave it to him to  work his own Way Accordingly the Earl found out and hired two  Spanish  Spies for whose Fidelity as his great Precaution al∣ways led him to do he took sufficient Se∣curity and dispatch'd 'em with a Letter to Colonel  Jones  Governor of the Place in∣timating his Readiness as well as Ability to relieve him and above all exhorting him to have the  Miquelets  in the Town ready on Sight of his Troops to issue out pursue and plunder since that would be all they would have to do and all he would expect at their Hands The Spies were dis∣patch'd accordingly and pursuant to In∣structions one betray'd and discover'd the other who had the Letter in charge to de∣liver to Colonel  Jones  The Earl to carry on the Feint having in the mean time by dividing his Troops and march∣ing secretly over the Mountains drawn his Men together so as to make their Appea∣rance on the Height of a neighbouring Mountain little more than Cannonshot from the Enemy's Camp  Santo Mattheo  reliev'd by the Earl of  Peterbo∣row  The Tale of the Spies was fully confirm'd and the  Conde  though an able General march'd off with some Precipitation with his Army and by that Means the Earl's smaller Number of twelve Hundred had Liberty to march into the Town without Interruption I must not let slip an Action of Colonel  Jones  's just be∣fore the Earl's Delivery of them The  Conde  for want of Artillery had set his Miners to work and the Colonel finding they had made some dangerous Advances turned the Course of a Rivulet that ran through the Middle of the Town in upon them and made them quit a Work they thought was brought to Perfection  SANTO Mattheo  being reliev'd as I have said the Earl though he had so far gain'd his Ends left not the flying Enemy without a Feint of Pursuit with such Cau∣tion nevertheless that in case they should happen to be better inform'd of his Weak∣ness he might have a Resource either back again to  Santo Mattheo  or to  Vinaros  on the Seaside or some other Place as occa∣sion might require But having just before receiv'd fresh Advice that the Reinforce∣ments he expected were anew counter∣manded and that the Duke of  Anjou  had increas'd his Troops to twelve thousand Men the Officers not enough elated with the last Success to adventure upon new Ex∣periments resolv'd in a Council of War to advise the Earl who had just before re∣reiv'd a discretionary Commission in lieu of Troops so to post the Forces under him as not to be cut off from being able to assist the King in Person or to march to the De∣fence of  Catalonia  in case of Necessity  PURSUANT to this Resolution of the Council of War the Earl of  Peterborow  tho' still intent upon his Expedition into  Valencia  which had been afresh com∣manded even while his Supplies were countermanded orders his Foot in a truly bad Condition by tedious Marches Day and Night over the Mountains to  Vinaros  and with his two hundred Horse set out to pro∣secute his pretended Design of pursuing the flying Enemy resolv'd if possible not∣withstanding all seemingly desperate Cir∣cumstances to perfect the Security of that Capital  TO that Purpose the Earl with his small Body of Patrolers went on frightning the Enemy till they came under the Walls of  Nules  a Town fortify'd with the best Walls regular Towers and in the best Re∣pair of any in that Kingdom But even here upon the Appearance of the Earl's Forlorn if they might not properly at that time all have pass'd under that Character under the same Panick they left that fensible Town with only one Thousand of the Town's People well arm'd for the Defence of it Yet was it scarce to be imagin'd that the Earl with his small Body of two hun∣dred Horse should be able to gain Admis∣sion or indeed under such Circumstances to attempt it But bold as the Undertaking was his good Genius went along with him and so good a Genius was it that it rarely left him without a good Effect He had  been told the Day before that the Enemy on leaving  Nules  had got Possession of  Villa Real  where they put all to the Sword What would have furnish'd another with Terror inspir'd his Lordship with a Thought as fortunate as it was successful The Earl rides up to the very Gates of the Town at the Head of his Party and peremptorily de∣mands the chief Magistrate or a Priest im∣mediately to be sent out to him and that un∣der Penalty of being all put to the Sword and us'd as the Enemy had us'd those at  VillaReal  the Day or two before The Troops that had so lately left the Place had left behind 'em more Terror than Men which together with the peremptory Demand of the Earl soon produc'd some Priests to wait upon the General By their Readiness to obey the Earl very justly imagin'd Fear to be the Motive wherefore to improve their Terror he only allow'd them six Minutes time to resolve upon a Surrender telling them that otherwise so soon as his Artillery was come up he would lay them under the utmost Extremities The Priests return'd with this melancholy Message into the Place  Nules  sur∣render'd to the Earl of  Peterbo∣row  and in a very short time after the Gates were thrown open Upon the Earl's En∣trance he found two hundred Horse which were the Original of his Lordship's forming that Body of Horse which afterwards prov'd the saving of  Valencia  THE News of the taking of  Nules  soon overtook the flying Enemy and so in∣creas'd the Apprehensions of their Danger that they renew'd their March the same Day though what they had taken before would have satisfy'd them much better without it On the other hand the Earl was so well pleas'd with his Success that leaving the Enemy to fly before their Fears he made a short Turn towards  Castillon de la Plana  a considerable but open Town where his Lordship furnish'd himself with four hundred Horses more and all this un∣der the Assurance that his Troops were driving the Enemy before them out of the Kingdom Hence he sent Orders to Colo∣nel  Pierce  's Regiment at  Vinaros  to meet him at  Oropesa  a Place at no great Di∣stance where when they came they were very pleasingly surpriz'd at their being well mounted and furnish'd with all Accoutre∣ments necessary After which leaving 'em canton'd in wall'd Towns where they could not be disturb'd without Artillery that inde∣fatigable General leaving them full Orders went on his way towards  Tortosa  AT  Vinaros  the Earl met with Advice that the  Spanish  Militia of the Kingdom of  Valencia  were assembled and had already advanc'd a Day's March at least into that Country Upon which collecting as fast as he could the whole Corps together the  Earl resolv'd to penetrate into  Valencia  directly notwithstanding this whole col∣lected Body would amount to no more than six hundred Horse and two thousand Foot  BUT there was a strong Pass over a River just under the Walls of  Molviedro  which must be first disputed and taken This Bri∣gadier  Mahoni  by the Orders of the Duke of  Arcos  who commanded the Troops of the Duke of  Anjou  in the Kingdom of  Va∣lencia  had taken care to secure  Molviedro  describ'd  Molvie∣dro  though not very strong is a wall'd Town very populous of it self and had in it besides a Garrison of eight hundred Men most of  Mahoni  's Dragoons It lies at the very Bottom of a high Hill on the upper Part whereof they shew the Ruins of the once famous SAGUNTUM  Saguntum  famous sure to Eternity if Letters shall last so long for an inviolable Fidelity to a negligent Confede∣rate against an implacable Enemy Here yet appear the visible  Vestigia  of awful Anti∣quity in half standing Arches and the yet unlevell'd Walls and Towers of that once celebrated City I could not but look upon all these with the Eyes of Despight in re∣gard to their Enemy  Hannibal  with those of Disdain in respect to the uncommon and unaccountable Supineness of its Confederates the  Romans  but with those of Veneration as to the Memory of a glorious People who rather than stand reproach'd with a Breach  of Faith or the Brand of Cowardice chose to sacrifice themselves their Wives Children and all that was dear to them in the Flames of their expiring City  IN  Molviedro  as I said before  Mahoni  commanded with eight hundred Men be∣sides Inhabitants which together with our having but little Artillery induc'd the Officers under the Earl of  Peterborow  reasonably enough to imagine and declare that there could be no visible Appearance of surmounting such Difficulties The Earl nevertheless instead of indulging such De∣spondencies gave them Hope that what Strength serv'd not to accomplish Art might possibly obtain To that Purpose he pro∣posed an Interview between himself and  Mahoni  and accordingly sent an Officer with a Trumpet to intimate his Desire The Motion was agreed to and the Earl having previously station'd his Troops to advantage and his little Artillery at a convenient Di∣stance with Orders they should appear on a slow March on the Side of a rising Hill during the time of Conference went to the Place appointed only as had been stipu∣lated attended with a small Party of Horse When they were met the Earl first offer'd all he could to engage  Mahoni  to the In∣terest of King  Charles  proposing some Things extravagant enough as  Mahoni  himself some time after told me to stagger  the Faith of a Catholick but all to little Purpose  Mahoni  was inflexible which oblig'd the Earl to new Measures  WHEREUPON the Earl frankly told him that he could not however but esteem the Confidence he had put in him and there∣fore to make some Retaliation he was ready to put it in his Power to avoid the Barbarities lately executed at  VillaReal  "My Relation to you continued the Gene∣ral inclines me to spare a Town under your Command You see how near my Forces are and can hardly doubt our soon being Masters of the Place What I would therefore offer you said the Earl is a Capitulation that my Incli∣nation may be held in Countenance by my Honour Barbarities however justified by Example are my utter Aversion and against my Nature and to testify so much together with my good Will to your Per∣son was the main Intent of this Interview"  THIS Frankness so far prevail'd on  Ma∣honi  that he agreed to return an Answer in half an Hour Accordingly an Answer was return'd by a  Spanish  Officer and a Ca∣pitulation agreed upon the Earl at the same time endeavouring to bring over that Officer to King  Charles  on much the same Topicks he us'd with  Mahoni  But finding this equally fruitless whether it was that he tacitly reproach'd the Officer with a Want  of Consideration in neglecting to follow the Example of his Commander or what else he created in that Officer such a Jealousy of  Mahoni  that was afterward very service∣able to him in his further Design  TO forward which to a good Issue the Earl immediately made choice of two Dra∣goons who upon promise of Promotion undertook to go as Spies to the Duke of  Arcos  whose Forces lay not far off on the other Side a large Plain which the Earl must unavoidably pass and which would inevitably be attended with almost insuper∣able Dangers if there attack'd by a Force so much superior Those Spies according to Instructions were to discover to the Duke that they overheard the Conference between the Earl and  Mahoni  and at the same time saw a considerable Number of Pistoles deliver'd into  Mahoni  's Hands large Promises passing at that Instant reci∣procally But above all that the Earl had recommended to him the procuring the March of the Duke over the Plain between them The Spies went and deliver'd all ac∣cording to Concert concluding before the Duke that they would ask no Reward but undergo any Punishment if  Mahoni  did not very soon send to the Duke a Request to march over the Plain in order to put the concerted Plot in execution It was not long after this pretended Discovery be∣fore  Mahoni  did send indeed an Officer to the Duke desiring the March of his Forces over the Plain but in reality to obstruct the Earl's Passage which he knew very well must be that and no other way How∣ever the Duke being prepossess'd by the Spies and what those  Spanish  Officers that at first escap'd had before infus'd took Things in their Sense and as soon as  Mahoni  who was forc'd to make the best of his way over the Plain before the Earl of  Peterborow  arriv'd at his Camp he was put under Arrest and sent to  Madrid  The Duke having thus imbib'd the Venom and taken the Alarm immediately decamp'd in Con∣fusion and took a different Rout than at first he intended leaving that once formidable Plain open to the Earl without an Enemy to obstruct him In some little time after he arriv'd at  Madrid Mahoni  made his Inno∣cence appear and was created a General while the Duke of  Arcos  was recall'd from his Post of Honour  The Earl's Entry into the City of  Valencia  THE Day after we arriv'd at  Valencia  the Gates of which fine City were set open to us with the highest Demonstrations of Joy I call'd it a fine City but sure it richly deserves a brighter Epithet since it is a common Saying among the  Spaniards  that the Pleasures of  Valencia  would make a  Jew  forget  Jerusalem  It is most sweetly situated in a very beautiful Plain and with∣in  half a League of the  Mediterranean  Sea It never wants any of the Fragrancies of Nature and always has something to de∣light the most curious Eye It is famous to a Proverb for fine Women but as infa∣mous and only in that so for the Race of Bravoes the common Companions of the Ladies of Pleasure in this Country These Wretches are so Casehardened they will commit a Murder for a Dollar tho' they run their Country for it when they have done Not that other Parts of this Nation are uninfested with this sort of Animals but here their Numbers are so great that if a Catalogue was to be taken of those in o∣ther Parts of that Country perhaps nine in ten would be found by Birth to be of this Province  BUT to proceed tho' the Citizens and all Sorts of People were redundant in their various Expressions of Joy for an Entry so surprizing and utterly lost to their Expecta∣tion whatever it was to their Wishes the Earl had a secret Concern for the Publick which lay gnawing at his Heart and which yet he was forced to conceal He knew that he had not four thousand Soldiers in the Place and not Powder or Ammunition for those nor any Provisions lay'd in for any thing like a Siege On the other Hand the E∣nemy without were upwards of seven Thou∣sand with a Body of four Thousand more  not fifteen Leagues off on their March to join them Add to this the Mareschal de  Thesse  was no farther off than  Madrid  a very few Days March from  Valencia  a short Way indeed for the Earl who as was said before was wholly unprovided for a Siege which was reported to be the sole End of the Mareschal's moving that Way But the Earl's neverfailing Genius resolv'd again to attempt that by Art which the Strength of his Forces utterly disallow'd him And in the first Place his Intelli∣gence telling him that sixteen twentyfour Pounders with Stores and Ammunition answerable for a Siege were ship'd off for the Enemy's Service at  Alicant  the Earl forthwith lays a Design and with his usual Success intercepts 'em all supplying that way his own Necessities at the Expence of the Enemy  THE four thousand Men ready to rein∣force the Troops nearer  Valencia  were the next Point to be undertaken but  hic labor hoc opus  since the greater Body under the Conde  de las Torres  who with  Mahoni  was now reinstated in his Post lay between the Earl and those Troops intended to be dispers'd And what inhaunc'd the Diffi∣culty the River  Xucar  must be pass'd in al∣most the Face of the Enemy Great Dis∣advantages as these were they did not dis∣courage the Earl He detach'd by Night  four hundred Horse and eight hundred Foot who march'd with such hasty Silence that they surpriz'd that great Body routed 'em  A small Party of the Earl's routs a Body of four Thou∣sand  and brought into  Valencia  six hundred Pri∣soners very safely notwithstanding they were oblig'd under the same NightCovert to pass very near a Body of three Thousand of the Enemy's Horse Such a prodigious Victory would hardly have gain'd Credit in that City if the Prisoners brought in had not been living Witnesses of the Action as well as the Triumph The Conde  de las Torres  upon these two military Rebuffs drew off to a more convenient Distance and left the Earl a little more at ease in his new Quarters  HERE the Earl of  Peterborow  made his Residence for some time He was extream∣ly well belov'd his affable Behaviour ex∣acted as much from all and he preserv'd such a good Correspondence with the Priests and the Ladies that he never fail'd of the most early and best Intelligence a thing by no means to be slighted in the common Course of Life but much more commendable and necessary in a General with so small an Army at open War and in the Heart of his Enemy's Country  THE Earl by this Means some small time after receiving early Intelligence that King  Philip  was actually on his March to  Bar∣celona  with an Army of upwards of twenty  five thousand Men under the Command of a Mareschal of  France  began his March to∣wards  Catalonia  with all the Troops that he could gather together leaving in  Va∣lencia  a small Body of Foot such as in that Exigence could best be spar'd The whole Body thus collected made very little more than two thousand Foot and six hundred Horse yet resolutely with these he sets out for  Barcelona  In the Neighbourhood of which as soon as he arriv'd he took care to post himself and his diminutive Army in the Mountains which inviron that City where he not only secur'd 'em against the Enemy but found himself in a Capacity of putting him under perpetual Alarms Nor was the Mareschal with his great Army capable of returning the Earl's Compliment of Disturbance since he himself every six or eight Hours put his Troops into such a varying Situation that always when most arduously sought he was farthest off from being found In this Manner the General bitterly harrass'd the Troops of the Enemy and by these Means struck a perpetual Ter∣ror into the Besiegers Nor did he only this way annoy the Enemy the Precautions he had us'd and the Measures he had taken in other Places with a View to prevent their Return to  Madrid  though the Invi∣dious endeavour'd to bury them in Oblivion having equally contributed to the driving  of the Mareschal of  France  and his Catho∣lick King out of the  Spanish  Dominions  BUT to go on with the Siege The Breaches in the Walls of that City during its Siege by the Earl had been put into tolerable Repair but those of  Monjouick  on the contrary had been as much neglect∣ed However the Garrison made shift to hold out a Battery of twentythree Days with no less than fifty Pieces of Cannon when after a Loss of the Enemy of upwards of three thousand Men a Moiety of the Army employ'd against it when the Earl took it they were forc'd to surrender at Discretion  Monjouick  taken by the Mares∣chal of  France  And this cannot but merit our Observation that a Place which the  English  General took in little more than an Hour and with very inconsiderable Loss afforded the Mareschal of  France  a Resi∣stance of twentythree Days  Barcelona  besieg'd  UPON the taking of Fort  Monjouick  the Mareschal  de Thess  gave immediate Orders for Batteries to be rais'd against the Town Those Orders were put in Execution with all Expedition and at the same time his Army fortify'd themselves with such En∣trenchments as would have ruin'd the Earl's former little Army to have rais'd or his pre∣sent much lesser Army to have attempted the forcing them However they sufficiently demonstrated their Apprehensions of that watchful General who lay hovering over  their Heads upon the Mountains Their main Effort was to make a Breach between Port St  Antonio  and that Breach which our Forces had made the Year before to effect which they took care to ply them very di∣ligently both from Cannon and Mortars and in some few Days their Application was answer'd with a practicable Breach for a Storm Which however was prudently deferr'd for some time and that thro' fear of the Earl's falling on the Back of them whenever they should attempt it which consequently they were sensible might put them into some dangerous Disorder  AND now it was that the Earl of  Peter∣borow  resolv'd to put in practice the Reso∣lution he had some time before concerted within himself About nine or ten Days be∣fore the Raising of the Siege he had receiv'd an Express from Brigadier  Stanhope  who was aboard Sir  John Leake  's Fleet appoint∣ed for the Relief of the Place with the Reinforcements from  England  acquainting the Earl that he had us'd all possible En∣deavours to prevail on the Admiral to make the best of his way to  Barcelona  But that the Admiral however persisted in a posi∣tive Resolution not to attempt the  French  Fleet before that Place under the Count  de Tholouse  till the Ships were join'd him which were expected from  Ireland  under the Command of Sir  George Bing  True  it was the Fleet under Admiral  Leake  was of equal Strength with that under the  French  Admiral but jealous of the Infor∣mations he had receiv'd and too ready to conclude that People in Distress were apt to make Representations too much in their own Favour he held himself in point of Discretion oblig'd not to hazard the Queen's Ships when a Reinforcement of both cleaner and larger were under daily Expectation  THIS unhappy Circumstance notwith∣standing all former glorious Deliverances had almost brought the Earl to the Brink of Despair and to increase it the Earl every Day receiv'd such Commands from the King within the Place as must have sa∣crificed his few Forces without the least Probability of succeeding Those all tended to his forcing his Way into the Town when in all human Appearance not one Man of all that should make the Attempt could have done it with any Hope or Pro∣spect of surviving The  French  were strong∣ly encamp'd at the Foot of the Mountains distant two Miles from  Barcelona  towards the Bottom of those Hills the Avenues into the Plain were possess'd and fortify'd by great Detachments from the Enemy's Army From all which it will be evident that no Attempt could be made without giving the Enemy time to draw together what Body  of Foot they pleas'd Or supposing it fea∣sible under all these difficult Circumstances for some of them to have forc'd their Pas∣sage the Remainder that should have been so lucky to have escap'd their Foot would have found themselves expos'd in open Field to a Pursuit of four thousand Horse and Dragoons and that for two Miles to∣gether when in case of their inclosing them the bravest Troops in the World un∣der such a Situation would have found it their best way to have surrender'd them∣selves Prisoners of War  NEVERTHELESS when Brigadier  Stan∣hope  sent that Express to the Earl which I just now mention'd he assur'd him in the same that he would use his utmost Dili∣gence both by Sea and Land to let him have timely Notice of the Conjunction of the Fleets which was now all they had to de∣pend upon Adding withal that if the Earl should at any time receive a Letter or Paper though directed to no Body and with nothing in it but a half Sheet of Paper cut in the Middle he the Earl might cer∣tainly depend upon it that the two Fleets were join'd and making the best of their Way for  Barcelona  It will easily be ima∣gin'd the Express was to be well paid and being made sensible that he ran little or no Hazard in carrying a Piece of blank Paper he undertook it and as fortunately arriv'd  with it to the Earl at a Moment when Chagrin and Despair might have hurry'd him to some Resolution that might have prov'd fatal The Messenger himself how∣ever knew nothing of the Joining of the Fleets or the Meaning of his Message  AS soon as the Earl of  Peterborow  re∣ceiv'd this welcome Message from Brigadier  Stanhope  he march'd the very same Night with his whole little Body of Forces to a Town on the SeaShore call'd  Sigeth  No Person guess'd the Reason of his March or knew any thing of what the Intent of it was The Officers as formerly obey'd without Enquiry for they were led to it by so many unaccountable Varieties of Success that Affiance became a second Nature both in Officer and Soldier  THE Town of  Sigeth  was about seven Leagues to the Westward of  Barcelona  where as soon as the Earl with his Forces arriv'd he took care to secure all the small FishingBoats  Feluccas  and  Sattées  nay in a Word every Machine in which he could transport any of his Men So that in two Days time he had got together a Num∣ber sufficient for the Conveyance of all his Foot  BUT a Day or two before the Arrival o  the  English  Fleet off  Sigeth  the Officers o  his Troops were under a strange Consterna¦tion at a Resolution their General had take  Impatient of Delay and fearful of the Fleets passing by without his Knowledge the Earl summon'd them together a little before Night at which time he discover'd to the whole Assembly that he himself was oblig'd to endeavour to get aboard the  English  Fleet and that if possible before the  French  Scouts should be able to make any Disco∣very of their Strength That finding him∣self of no further Use on Shore having al∣ready taken the necessary Precautions for their Transportation and Security they had nothing to do but to pursue his Orders and make the best of their Way to  Barcelona  in the Vessels which he had provided for them That they might do this in perfect Security when they saw the  English  Fleet pass by or if they should pass by in the Night an Engagement with the  French  which would be an inevitable Consequence would give them sufficient Notice what they had to do further  THIS Declaration instead of satisfying made the Officers ten times more curious But when they saw their General going with a Resolution to lie out all Night at Sea in an open Boat attended with only one Officer and understood that he in∣tended to row out in his  Felucca  five or six Leagues distance from the Shore it is hardly to be express'd what Amazement and Con∣cern surpriz'd them all Mr  Crow  the  Queen's Minister and others express'd a par∣ticular Dislike and Uneasiness but all to no purpose the Earl had resolv'd upon it Ac∣cordingly at Night he put out to Sea in his open  Felucca  all which he spent five Leagues from Shore with no other Com∣pany than one Captain and his Rowers  IN the Morning to the great Satisfaction of all Officers and others the Earl came again to Land and immediately began to put his Men into the several Vessels which lay ready in Port for that Purpose But at Night their Amaze was renew'd when they found their General ready to put in execu∣tion his old Resolution in the same Equi∣page and with the same Attendance Ac∣cordingly he again  felucca'd  himself and they saw him no more till they were landed on the Mole in  Barcelona  WHEN the Earl of  Peterborow  first en∣gag'd himself in the Expedition to  Spain  he propos'd to the Queen and her Ministry that Admiral  Shovel  might be join'd in Com∣mission with him in the Command of the Fleet But this Year when the Fleet came through the  Straites  under ViceAdmiral  Leake  the Queen had sent a Com∣mission to the Earl of  Peterborow  for the full Command whenever he thought fit to come aboard in Person This it was that made the General endeavour at all Hazards to get aboard the Fleet by Night for he  was apprehensive and the Sequel prov'd his Apprehensions too well grounded that Admiral  Leake  would make his Appearance with the whole Body of the Fleet which made near twice the Number of the Ships of the Enemy in which Case it was natural to suppose that the Count  de Tholouse  as soon as ever the  French  Scouts should give Notice of our Strength would cut his Cables and put out to Sea to avoid an En∣gagement On the other hand the Earl was very sensible that if a Part of his Ships had kept astern that the Superiority might have appear'd on the  French  Side or rather if they had bore away in the Night towards the Coast of  Africa  and fallen to the East∣ward of  Barcelona  the next Day a Battle had been inevitable and a Victory equally certain since the Enemy by this Means had been tempted into an Engagement and their Retreat being cut off and their whole Fleet surrounded with almost double their Num∣ber there had hardly been left for any of them a Probability of Escaping  THEREFORE when the Earl of  Peter∣borow  put to Sea again the second Evening fearful of loosing such a glorious Opportu∣nity and impatient to be aboard to give the necessary Orders he order'd his Rowers to obtain the same Station in order to discover the  English  Fleet And according to his Wishes he did fall in with it but unfor∣tunately  the Night was so far advanc'd that it was impossible for him then to put his Project into practice  Earl of  Pe∣terborow  arrives on board the  English  Fleet  Captain  Price  a Gentleman of  Wales  who commanded a Third Rate was the Person he first came aboard of but how amaz'd was he to find in an open Boat at open Sea the Person who had Commission to command the Fleet So soon as he was enter'd the Ship the Earl sent the Ship's Pinnace with Letters to Admiral  Leake  to acquaint him with his Orders and Intentions and to Brigadier  Stanhope  with a Notification of his safe Ar∣rival but the Darkness of the Night prov'd so great an Obstacle that it was a long time before the Pinnace could reach the Ad∣miral When Day appear'd it was asto∣nishing to the whole Fleet to see the  Union  Flag waving at the Maintopmast Head No Body could trust his own Eyes or guess at the Meaning till better certify'd by the Account of an Event so singular and extra∣ordinary  WHEN we were about six Leagues Di∣stance from  Barcelona  the Port we aim'd at one of the  French  Scouts gave the Alarm who making the Signal to another he communicated it to a Third and so on as we afterward sorrowfully found and as the Earl had before apprehended The  French  Admiral being thus made acquainted with the Force of our Fleet hoisted sail and  made the best of his Way from us either pursuant to Orders or under the plausible Excuse of a Retreat  THIS favourable Opportunity thus lost there remain'd nothing to do but to land the Troops with all Expedition which was executed accordingly The Regiments which the Earl of  Peterborow  embark'd the Night before being the first that got into the Town Let the Reader imagine how pleasing such a Sight must be to those in  Barcelona  reduc'd as they were to the last Extremity In this Condition to see an Enemy's Fleet give way to another with Reinforcements from  England  the Sea at the same Instant cover'd with little Vessels crouded with greater Succours what was there wanting to compleat the glorious Scene but what the General had project∣ed a Fight at Sea under the very Walls of the invested City and the Ships of the Enemy sinking or tow'd in by the victo∣rious  English  But Night and a few Hours defeated the latter Part of that well intended Landskip  KING  Philip  and the Mareschal of  France  had not fail'd to push on the Siege with all imaginable Vigour but this Re∣treat of the Count  de Tholouse  and the News of those Reinforcements soon chang'd the Scene Their Courage without was abated proportionably as theirs within was  elated  The Siege of  Barce∣lona  rais'd  In these Circumstances a Council of War being call'd it was unanimously re∣solv'd to raise the Siege Accordingly next Morning the first of  May  while the Sun was under a total Eclypse in a suitable Hurry and Confusion they broke up leaving behind them most of their Cannon and Mortars together with vast Quantities of all Sorts of Ammunition and Provisions scarce stopping to look back till they had left all but the very Verge of the disputed Dominion behind them  KING  Charles  look'd with new Pleasure upon this lucky Effort of his old Deli∣verers Captivity is a State no way de∣sirable to Persons however brave of the most private Station in Life but for a King within two Days of falling into the Hands of his Rival to receive so seasonable and unexpected a Deliverance must be supposed as it really did to open a Scene to universal Rejoicing among us too high for any Words to express or any Thoughts to ima∣gine to those that were not present and Partakers of it He forth with gave Orders for a Medal to be struck suitable to the Oc∣casion one of which set round with Dia∣monds he presented to Sir  John Leake  the  English  Admiral The next Orders were for recasting all the damag'd brass Cannon which the Enemy had left upon every one of which was by order a Sun eclyps'd  with this Motto under it  Magna parvis obscurantur  I HAVE often wonder'd that I never heard any Body curious enough to enquire what could be the Motives to the King of  Spain  's quitting his Dominions upon the raising of this Siege very certain it is that he had a fine Army under the Command of a Mareschal of  France  not very consi∣derably decreas'd either by Action or De∣sertion But all this would rather increase the Curiosity than abate it In my Opinion then though Men might have Curiosity enough the Question was purposely evaded under an Apprehension that an honest Answer must inevitably give a higher Idea of the General than their Inclinations led them to At first View this may carry the Face of a Paradox yet if the Reader will consider that in every Age Virtue has had its Shaders or Maligners he will himself easily solve it at the same time that he finds himself compell'd to allow that those who found themselves unable to prevent his great Services were willing in a more subtil Manner to endeavour at the annulling of them by Silence and Concealment  THIS will appear more than bare Suppo∣sition if we compare the present Situation as to Strength of the two contending Powers The  French  at the Birth of the Siege con∣sisted of five thousand Horse and Dragoons  and twentyfive thousand Foot effective Men Now grant that their kill'd and wounded together with their Sick in the Hospitals might amount to five Thousand yet as their Body of Horse was entire and in the best Condition the Remaining will appear to be an Army of twentyfive Thou∣sand at least On the other Side all the Forces in  Barcelona  even with their Re∣inforcements amounted to no more than seven thousand Foot and four hundred Horse Why then when they rais'd their Siege did not they march back into the Heart of  Spain  with their so much superior Army or at least towards their Capital The Answer can be this and this only Be∣cause the Earl of  Peterborow  had taken such provident Care to render all secure that it was thereby render'd next to an Im∣possibility for them so to do That Gene∣ral was satisfy'd that the Capital of  Cata∣lonia  must in course fall into the Hands of the Enemy unless a superior Fleet re∣mov'd the Count  de Tholouse  and threw in timely Succours into the Town And as that could not depend upon him but others he made it his chief Care and assiduous Employment to provide against those Strokes of Fortune to which he found him∣self again likely to be expos'd as he often had been and therefore had he Resource to that Vigilance and Precaution which had  often retriev'd him when to others his Cir∣cumstances seem'd to be most desperate  THE Generality of Mankind and the  French  in particular were of opinion that the taking  Barcelona  would prove a decisive Stroke and put a Period to the War in  Spain  and yet at that very Instant I was inclin'd to believe that the General flatter'd himself it would be in his Power to give the Enemy sufficient Mortification even though the Town should be oblig'd to submit to King  Philip  The wise Measures taken induc'd me so to believe and the Sequel approv'd it for the Earl had so well ex∣pended his Caution that the Enemy on the Disappointment found himself under a Necessity of quitting  Spain  and the same would have put him under equal Difficul∣ties had he carry'd the Place The  French  could never have undertaken that Siege without depending on their Fleet for their Artillery Ammunition and Provisions since they must be inevitably forc'd to leave behind them the strong Towns of  Tortosa Lerida  and  Taragona  The Earl there∣fore whose perpetual Difficulties seem'd rather to render him more sprightly and vi∣gorous took care himself to examine the whole Country between the  Ebro  and  Barcelona  and upon his doing so was pleasingly as well as sensibly satisfy'd that it was practicable to render their Return into  the Heart of  Spain  impossible whether they did or did not succeed in the Siege they were so intent to undertake  THERE were but three Ways they could attempt it The first of which was by the Seaside from  Taragona  towards  Tortosa  the most barren and consequently the most improper Country in the Universe to sustain an Army and yet to the natural the Earl had added such artificial Difficulties as ren∣der'd it absolutely impossible for an Army to subsist or march that Way  THE middle Way lay through a better Country indeed yet only practicable by the Care which had been taken to make the Road so And even here there was a Ne∣cessity of marching along the Side of a Mountain where by vast Labour and In∣dustry a high Way had been cut for two Miles at least out of the main Rock The Earl therefore by somewhat of the same Labour soon made it impassable He em∣ploy'd to that End many Thousands of the Country People under a few of his own Officers and Troops who cutting up twenty several Places made so many Precipices perpendicular almost as a Wall which ren∣der'd it neither safe or even to be attempt∣ed by any single Man in his Wits much less by an Army Besides a very few Men from the higher Cliffs of the Mountain might have destroy'd an Army with the Arms of  Nature only by rolling down large Stones and Pieces of the Rock upon the Enemy passing below  THE last and uppermost Way lay thro' the hilly Part of  Catalonia  and led to  Le∣rida  towards the Head of the  Ebro  the strongest Place we had in all  Spain  and which was as well furnish'd with a very good Garrison Along this Road there lay many old Castles and little Towns in the Mountains naturally strong all which would not only have afforded Opposition but at the same time have entertain'd an E∣nemy with variety of Difficulties and espe∣cially as the Earl had given Orders and taken Care that all Cattle and every Thing necessary to sustain an Army should be con∣vey'd into Places of Security either in the Mountains or thereabouts These three Ways thus precautiously secur'd what had the Earl to apprehend but the Safety of the ArchDuke which yet was through no Default of his if in any Danger from the Siege  FOR I well remember on Receipt of an Express from the Duke of  Savoy  as he fre∣quenly sent such to enquire after the Pro∣ceedings in  Spain  I was shew'd a Letter wrote about this time by the Earl of  Peter∣borow  to that Prince which rais'd my Spi∣rits though then at a very low Ebb It was too remarkable to be forgot and the  Substance of it was That his Highness might depend upon it that he the Earl was in much better Circumstances than he was thought to be That the  French  Officers knowing nothing of the Situation of the Country would find themselves ex∣treamly disappointed since in case the Siege was rais'd their Army should be oblig'd to abandon  Spain  Or in case the Town was taken they should find themselves shut up in that Corner of  Catalonia  and under an Impossibility of forcing their Way back either through  Aragon  or  Valencia  That by this Means all  Spain  to the  Ebro  would be open to the Lord  Galoway  who might march to  Madrid  or any where else without Opposition That he had no other Uneasiness or Concern upon him but for the Person of the ArchDuke whom he had nevertheless earnestly solicited not to re∣main in the Town on the very first Ap∣pearance of the intended Siege  BARCELONA  being thus reliev'd and King  Philip  forc'd out of  Spain  by these cautious Steps taken by the Earl of  Peter∣borow  before we bring him to  Valencia  it will be necessary to intimate that as it always was the Custom of that General to settle by a Council of War all the Mea∣sures to be taken whenever he was oblig'd for the Service to leave the ArchDuke a Council of War was now accordingly held  where all the General Officers and those in greatest Employments at Court assisted Here every thing was in the most solemn Manner concerted and resolv'd upon here Garrisons were settled for all the strong Places and Governors appointed But the main Article then agreed upon was that King  Charles  should immediately begin his Journey to  Madrid  and that by the Way of  Valencia  The Reason assign'd for it was because that Kingdom being in his Possession no Difficulties could arise which might occasion Delay if his Majesty took that Rout It was likewise agreed in the same Council that the Earl of  Peterborow  should embark all the Foot not in Gar∣risons for their more speedy as well as more easy Conveyance to  Valencia  The same Council of War agreed that all the Horse in that Kingdom should be drawn to∣gether the better to insure the Measures to be taken for the opening and facilitating his Majesty's Progress to  Madrid  ACCORDINGLY after these Resolutions were taken the Earl of  Peterborow  embarks his Forces and sails for  Valencia  where he was doubly welcom'd by all Sorts of People upon Account of his safe Arrival and the News he brought along with it By the Joy they express'd one would have ima∣gin'd that the General had escap'd the same Danger with the King and in truth had  their King arriv'd with him in Person the most loyal and zealous would have found themselves at a loss how to have express'd their Satisfaction in a more sensible Manner  SOON after his Landing with his custo∣mary Vivacity he apply'd himself to put in execution the Resolutions taken in the Coun∣cils of War at  Barcelona  and a little to improve upon them he rais'd an intire Re∣giment of Dragoons bought them Horses provided them Cloaths Arms and Acou∣trements and in six Weeks time had them ready to take the Field a thing though hardly to be parallell'd is yet scarce worthy to be mentioned among so many nobler Actions of his yet in regard to another General it may merit Notice since while he had  Madrid  in Possession near four Months he neither augmented his Troops nor lay'd up any Magazines neither sent he all that time any one Express to concert any Mea∣sures with the Earl of  Peterborow  but lay under a perfect Inactivity or which was worse negotiating that unfortunate Project of carrying King  Charles  to  Madrid  by the roundabout and illconcerted Way of  Ara∣gon  a Project not only contrary to the solemn Resolutions of the Council of War but which in reality was the Root of all our succeeding Misfortunes and that only for the wretched Vanity of appearing to have had some Share in bringing the King to his  Capital but how minute a Share it was will be manifest if it be consider'd that another General had first made the Way easy by driving the Enemy out of  Spain  and that the  French  General only stay'd at  Madrid  till the Return of those Troops which were in a manner driven out of  Spain  AND yet that Transaction doughty as it was took up four most precious Months which most certainly might have been much better employ'd in rendering it impossible for the Enemy to reenter  Spain  nor had there been any great Difficulty in so doing but the contrary if the General at  Madrid  had thought convenient to have join'd the Troops under the Earl of  Peterborow  and then to have march'd directly towards  Pampelona  or the Frontiers of  France  To this the Earl of  Peterborow  solicited the King and those about him he advis'd desir'd and intreated him to lose no time but to put in Execution those Measures re∣solv'd on at  Barcelona  A Council of War in  Valencia  renew'd the same Application but all to no Purpose his Rout was order'd him and that to meet his Majesty on the Frontiers of  Arragon  There indeed the Earl did meet the King and the  French  General an Army which by Virtue of a decrepid Intelligence he never saw or heard of till he fled from it to his Camp  at  Guadalira  Inexpressible was the Con∣fusion in this fatal Camp The King from  Arragon  the Earl of  Peterborow  from  Valencia  arriving in it the same Day al∣most the same Hour that the Earl of  Galo∣way  enter'd under a hasty Retreat before the  French  Army  BUT to return to Order which a Zeal of Justice has made me somewhat anticipate the Earl had not been long at  Valencia  be∣fore he gave Orders to MajorGeneral  Windham  to march with all the Forces he had which were not above two thousand Men and lay Siege to  Requina  Requina  besieg'd  a Town ten Leagues distant from  Valencia  and in the Way to  Madrid  The Town was not very strong nor very large but sure the odliest fortify'd that ever was The Houses in a Circle connectively compos'd the Wall and the People who defended the Town instead of firing from Hornworks Counterscarps and Bastions fir'd out of the Win∣dows of their Houses  NOTWITHSTANDING all which General  Windam  found much greater Opposition than he at first imagin'd and therefore finding he should want Ammunition he sent to the Earl of  Peterborow  for a Supply at the same time assigning as a Reason for it the unexpected Obstinacy of the Town So soon as the Earl receiv'd the Letter he sent for me and told me I must repair to  Re∣quina  where they would want an Engi∣neer and that I must be ready next Morn∣ing when he should order a Lieutenant with thirty Soldiers and two Matrosses to guard some Powder for that Service Ac∣cordingly the next Morning we set out the Lieutenant who was a  Dutchman  and Commander of the Convoy being of my Acquaintance  WE had reach'd Saint  Jago  a small Village about midway between  Valencia  and  Requina  when the Officer just as he was got without the Town resolving to take up his Quarters on the Spot order'd the Mules to be unloaded The Powder which consisted of fortyfive Barrels was pil'd up in a Circle and cover'd with Oilcloth to preserve it from the Weather and though we had agreed to sup together at my Quarters within the Village yet being weary and fatigu'd he order'd his FieldBed to be put up near the Powder and so lay down to take a short Nap  Fortyfive Barrels of Powder blewn up by an Accident  I had scarce been at my Quarters an Hour when a sud∣den Shock attack'd the House so violently that it threw down Tiles Windows Chim∣neys and all It presently came into my Head what was the Occasion and as my Fears suggested so it prov'd For running to the Door I saw a Cloud ascending from the Spot I left the Powder pitch'd upon In haste making up to which nothing was to  be seen but the bare Circle upon which it had stood The Bed was blown quite away and the poor Lieutenant all to pieces seve∣ral of his Limbs being found separate and at a vast Distance each from the other and particularly an Arm with a Ring on one of the Fingers The Matrosses were if possible in a yet worse Condition that is as to Manglement and Laceration All the Soldiers who were standing and any thing near were struck dead Only such as lay sleeping on the Ground escap'd and of those one assur'd me that the Blast remov'd him several Foot from his Place of Repose In short enquiring into this deplorable Disaster I had this Account That a Pig running out of the Town the Soldiers endeavour'd to intercept its Return but driving it upon the Matrosses one of them who was jealous of its getting back into the Hands of the Soldiers drew his Pistol to shoot it which was the Source of this miserable Catastrophe The Lieutenant car∣ry'd along with him a Bag of Dollars to pay the Soldiers Quarters of which the People and the Soldiers that were sav'd found many but blown to an inconceivable Distance  WITH those few Soldiers that remain'd alive I proceeded according to my Orders to  Requina  where when I arriv'd I gave General  Windham  an Account of the  Disaster at St  Jago  As such it troubled him and not a little on account of the Dis∣appointment However to make the best of a bad Market he gave Orders for the forming of a Mine under an old Castle which was part of the Wall As it was or∣der'd so it was begun more  in Terrorem  than with any Expectation of Success from it as a Mine Nevertheless I had scarce began to frame the Oven of the Mine when those within the Town desir'd to capitulate  Requina  surrenders  This being all we could aim at under the Miscarriage of our Powder at St  Jago  none being yet arriv'd to supply that De∣fect Articles were readily granted them pursuant to which that Part of the Garrison which was compos'd of  Castilian  Gentry had Liberty to go wherever they thought best and the rest were made Prisoners of War  Requina  being thus reduc'd to the Obedience of  Charles  III a new rais'd Regi∣ment of  Spaniards  was left in Garrison the Colonel of which was appointed Governor and our Supply of Powder having at last got safe to us General  Windham  march'd his little Army to  Cuenca  Cuenca  besieg'd  CUENCA  is a considerable City and a Bishoprick therefore to pretend to sit down before it with such a Company of Forragers rather than an Army must be plac'd among the hardy Influences of the Earl of  Peterborow  's auspicious Administra∣tion  On the out Part of  Cuenca  there stood an old Castle from which upon our Ap∣proach they play'd upon us furiously But as soon as we could bring two Pieces of our Cannon to bear we answer'd their Fire with so good Success that we soon oblig'd them to retire into the Town We had rais'd a Battery of twelve Guns against the City on their Rejection of the Summons sent them to come under the Obedience of King  Charles  going to which from the old Castle last reduc'd I receiv'd a Shot on the Toe of one of my Shoes which carry'd that Part of the Shoe intirely away without any further Damage  WHEN I came to that Battery we ply'd them warmly as well as from three Mor∣tars for the Space of three Days their Nights included but observing that in one particular House they were remarkably busy People thronging in and out below and those above firing perpetually out of the Windows I was resolv'd to have one Shot at that Window and made those Officers about me take Notice of it True it was the Distance would hardly allow me to hope for Success yet as the Experiment could only be attended with the Expence of a single Ball I made it So soon as the Smoak of my own Cannon would permit it we could see Clouds of Dust issuing from out of the Window which together with  the People's crouding out of Doors con∣vinc'd the Officers whom I had desir'd to take Notice of it that I had been no bad Marksman  UPON this two Priests were sent out of the Place with Proposals but they were so triflingly extravagant that as soon as ever the General heard them he order'd their Answer in a fresh Renewal of the Fire of both Cannon and Mortars And it hap∣pen'd to be with so much Havock and Exe∣cution that they were soon taught Reason and sent back their Divines with much more moderate Demands After the Ge∣neral had a little modell'd these last they were accepted and according to the Ar∣ticles of Capitulation the City was that very Day surrender'd into our Possession  Cuenca  surrenders  The Earl of  Duncannon  's Regiment took Guard of all the Gates and King  Charles  was proclaim'd in due Form  THE Earl of  Peterborow  during this Expedition had left  Valencia  and was ar∣riv'd at my Lord  Galway  's Camp at  Gua∣dalaxara  who for the Confederates and King  Charles  in particular unfortunately was order'd from  Portugal  to take the Command from a General who had all along been almost miraculously successful and by his own great Actions pav'd the Way for a safe Passage to that his Sup∣planter  YET even in this fatal Place the Earl of  Peterborow  made some Proposals which had they beem embrac'd might in all Probability have secur'd  Madrid  from fall∣ing into the Hands of the Enemy But in opposition thereto the Lord  Galway  and all his  Portugueze  Officers were for forcing the next Day the Enemy to Battle The almost only Person against it was the Earl of  Peterborow  who then and there took the Liberty to evince the Impossibility of com∣ing to an Engagement This the next Morning too evidently made apparent when upon the first Motion of our Troops towards the River which they pretended to pass and must pass before they could engage they were so warmly saluted from the Bat∣teries of the Enemy and their small Shot that our Regiments were forc'd to retire in Confusion to their Camp By which Re∣buff all heroical Imaginations were at pre∣sent laid aside to consider how they might make their Retreat to  Valencia  THE Retreat being at last resolv'd on and a Multiplicity of Generals rendering our bad Circumstances much worse the Earl of  Peterborow  met with a fortunate Reprieve by Solicitations from the Queen and Desires tantamount to Orders that he would go with the Troops left in  Catalonia  to the Relief of the Duke of  Savoy  It is hardly to be doubted that that General was  glad to withdraw from those Scenes of Con∣fusion which were but too visible to Eyes even less discerning than his However he forbore to prepare himself to put her Ma∣jesty's Desires in execution as they were not peremptory till it had been resolv'd by the unanimous Consent of a Council of War where the King all the Generals and Mi∣nisters were present That it was expedient for the Service that the Earl of  Peterborow  during the Winter Season should comply with her Majesty's Desires and go for  Italy  since he might return before the opening of the Campaign if it should be necessary And return indeed he did before the Cam∣paign open'd and brought along with him one hundred thousand Pounds from  Genoa  to the great Comfort and Support of our Troops which had neither Money nor Credit But on his Return that noble Earl found the Lord  Galway  had been near as successful against him as he had been unsuccessful against the Enemy Thence was the Earl of  Peterborow  recall'd to make room for an unfortunate General who the next Year suffer'd himself to be decoy'd in∣to that fatal Battle of  Almanza  THE Earl of  Peterborow  on his leaving  Valencia  had order'd his Baggage to fol∣low him to the Camp at  Guadalaxara  and it arriv'd in our little Camp so far safe in its way to the greater at  Guadalaxara  I think it consisted of seven loaded Wag∣gons and General  Windham  gave Orders for a small Guard to escorte it under which they proceeded on their Journey But a∣bout eight Leagues from  Cuenca  at a pretty Town call'd  Huette  a Party from the Duke of  Berwick  's Army with Boughs in their Hats the better to appear what they were not for the Bough in the Hat is the Badge of the  English  as white Paper is the Badge of the  French  came into the Town crying all the way  Viva Carlos Tercero Viva  With these Acclamations in their Mouths they advanc'd up to the very Waggons when attacking the Guards who had too much deluded themselves with Appearances they routed 'em and immediately plunder'd the Waggons of all that was valuable and then march'd off  THE Noise of this soon reach'd the Ears of the Earl of  Peterborow  at  Guadalaxara  When leaving my Lord  Galway  's Camp pursuant to the Resolutions of the Council of War with a Party only of fourscore of  Killegrew  's Dragoons he met General  Windham  's little Army within a League of  Huette  the Place where his Baggage had been plunder'd The Earl had strong Mo∣tives of Suspicion that the Inhabitants had given Intelligence to the Enemy and as is very natural giving way to the first Dictates of Resentment he resolv'd to have  lay'd the Town in Ashes But when he came near it the Clergy and Magistrates upon their Knees disavowing the Charge and asserting their Innocence prevail'd on the good Nature of that generous Earl without any great Difficulty to spare the Town at least not to burn it  WE march'd however into the Town and that Night took up our Quarters there and the Magistrates under the Dread of our avenging our selves on their part took Care that we were well supplied But when they were made sensible of the Value of the Loss which the Earl had sustain'd and that on a moderate Computation it amount∣ed to at least eight thousand Pistoles they voluntarily presented themselves next Morn∣ing and of their own accord offer'd to make his Lordship full Satisfaction and that in their own Phrase  de Contado in ready Money  The Earl was not displeas'd at their Offer but generously made An∣swer That he was just come from my Lord  Galway  's Camp at  Chincon  where he found they were in a likelihood of wanting Bread and as he imagin'd it might be easier to them to raise the Value in Corn than in ready Money if they would send to that Value in Corn to the Lord  Galway  's Camp he would be satisfy'd This they with Joy embrac'd and immediately com∣plied with  I AM apt to think the last Century and I very much fear the Current will be as de∣ficient can hardly produce a parallel In∣stance of Generosity and true publick Spi∣ritedness And the World will be of my Opinion when I have corroborated this with another Passage some Years after The Commissioners for Stating the Debts due to the Army meeting daily for that Purpose at their House in  Darby  Court in  Channel Row  I there mentioned to Mr  Read  Gentleman to his Lordship this very just and honourable Claim upon the Government as Monies advanced for the Use of the Army Who told me in a little Time after that he had mention'd it to his Lordship but with no other Effect than to have it rejected with a generous Disdain  WHILE we stay'd at  Huette  there was a little Incident in Life which gave me great Diversion The Earl who had al∣ways maintain'd a good Correspondence with the fair Sex hearing from one of the Priests of the Place That on the Alarm of burning the Town one of the finest Ladies in all  Spain  had taken Refuge in the Nunnery was desirous to speak with her  THE Nunnery stood upon a small rising Hill within the Town and to obtain the View the Earl had presently in his Head this Stratagem he sends for me as Engi∣neer  to have my Advice how to raise a proper Fortification upon that Hill out of the Nunnery I waited upon his Lordship to the Place where declaring the Intent of our coming and giving plausible Reasons for it the Train took and immediately the Lady Abbess and the fair Lady came out to make Intercession That his Lord∣ship would be pleas'd to lay aside that De∣sign The divine Oratory of one and the beautiful Charms of the other prevail'd so his Lordship left the Fortification to be the Work of some future Generation  FROM  Huette  the Earl of  Peterborow  march'd forwards for  Valencia  with only those fourscore Dragoons which came with him from  Chincon  leaving General  Wind∣ham  pursuing his own Orders to join his Forces to the Army then under the Com∣mand of the Lord  Galway  But stopping at  Campilio  a little Town in our Way his Lordship had Information of a most bar∣barous Fact committed that very Morning by the  Spaniards  at a small  Villa  about a League distant upon some  English  Sol∣diers  A CAPTAIN of the  English  Guards whose Name has slip'd my Memory tho' I well knew the Man marching in order to join the Battalion of the Guards then under the Command of General  Windham  with some of his Soldiers that had been in  the Hospital took up his Quarters in tha  little  Villa  But on his marching out of i  next Morning a Shot in the Back lai  that Officer dead upon the Spot And as it had been before concerted the  Spaniards  of the Place at the same Time fell upon the poor weak Soldiers killing several not even sparing their Wives This was but a Prelude to their Barbarity their savage Cruelty was only whetted not glutted They took the surviving few hurried and dragg'd them up a Hill a little without the  Villa  On the Top of this Hill there was a Hole or Opening somewhat like the Mouth of one of our CoalPits down this they cast several who with hideous Shrieks and Cries made more hideous by the Ecchoes of the Chasm there lost their Lives  THIS Relation was thus made to the Earl of  Peterborow  at his Quarters at  Campilio  who immediately gave Orders for to found to Horse At first we were all surpriz'd but were soon satisfy'd that it was to revenge or rather do Justice on this barbarous Action  AS soon as we enter'd the  Villa  we found that most of the Inhabitants but especially the most Guilty had withdrawn themselves on our Approach We found however many of the dead Soldiers Cloaths which had been convey'd into the  Church and there hid And a strong Ac∣cusation being laid against a Person belong∣ing to the Church and full Proof made that he had been singularly Industrious in the Execution of that horrid Piece of Bar∣barity on the Hill his Lordship command∣ed him to be hang'd up at the Knocker of the Door  AFTER this piece of military Justice we were led up to the fatal Pit or Hole down which many had been cast headlong There we found one poor Soldier alive who upon his throwing in had catch'd fast hold of some impending Bushes and sav'd himself on a little Jutty within the Concavity On hearing us talk  English  he cry'd out and Ropes being let down in a little Time he was drawn up when he gave us an ample Detail of the whole Villany Among other Particulars I remember he told me of a very narrow Escape he had in that obscure Recess A poor Woman one of the Wives of the Soldiers who were thrown down after him struggled and roared so much that they could not with all their Force throw her cleaverly in the Middle by which means falling near the Side in her Fall she almost beat him from his Place of Security  UPON the Conclusion of this tragical Relation of the Soldier thus saved his Lordship gave immediate Orders for the  Firing of the  Villa  which was executed with due Severity After which his Lord∣ship march'd back to his Quarters at  Cam∣pilio  from whence two Days after we arriv'd at  Valencia  Where the first Thing presented to that noble Lord was all the Papers taken in the Plunder of his Baggage which the Duke of  Berwick  had generously order'd to be return'd him without waste or opening  IT was too manifest after the Earl's ar∣rival at this City that the Alteration in the Command of the  English  Forces which before was only receiv'd as a Rumour had deeper Grounds for Belief than many of his Friends in that City could have wish'd His Lordship had gain'd the Love of all by a Thousand engaging Condescensions even his Gallantries being no way prejudicial were not offensive and though his Lord∣ship did his utmost to conceal his Chagrin the Sympathy of those around him made such Discoveries upon him as would have disappointed a double Portion of his Cauti∣on They had seen him unelated under Successes that were so near being unac∣countable that in a Country of less Super∣stition than  Spain  they might almost have pass'd for miraculous they knew full well that nothing but that Series of Successes had pav'd a Passage for the General that was to supersede him those only having  removed all the Difficulties of his March from  Portugal  to  Madrid  they knew him the older General and therefore not knowing that in the Court he came from Intrigue was too often the Soul of Merit they could not but be amazed at a Change which his Lordship was unwilling any body should perceive by himself  IT was upon this Account that as for∣merly he treated the Ladies with Balls and to pursue the Dons in their own Humour order'd a  Tawridore  or  BullFeast  In  Spain  no sort of publick Diversions are esteemed equal with this But the Bulls provided at  Valencia  not being of the right Breed nor ever initiated in the Mysteries did not acquit themselves at all masterly and consequently did not give the Diver∣sion or Satisfaction expected For which Reason I shall omit giving a Description of this BullFeast and desire my Reader to suspend his Curiosity till I come to some which in the  Spanish  Sense were much more entertaining that is attended with much greater Hazards and Danger  BUT though I have said the Gallan∣tries of the General were mostly political at least very inoffensive yet there hap∣pen'd about this Time and in this Place a piece of Gallantry that gave the Earl a vast deal of Offence and Vexation as a Matter that in its Consequences might  have been fatal to the Interest of King  Charles  if not to the  English  Nation in general and which I the rather relate in that it may be of use to young Officers and others pointing out to them the Danger not to say Folly of inadvertent and preci∣pitate Engagements under unruly Pas∣sions  I HAVE said before that  Valencia  is famous for fine Women It indeed abounds in them and among those are great Num∣bers of Courtezans not inferior in Beauty to any Nevertheless two of our  English  Officers not caring for the common Road however safe resolv'd to launch into the deeper Seas though attended with much greater Danger Amours the common Failing of that fair City was the Occasion of this Accident and two Nuns the Objects It is customary in that Country for young People in an Evening to resort to the Grates of the Nunneries there to divert them∣selves and the Nuns with a little pleasant and inoffensive Chitchat For though I have heard some relate a World of nauseous Pas∣sages at such Conversations I must declare that I never saw or heard any Thing un∣seemly and therefore whenever I have heard any such from such Fabulists I never so much wrong'd my Judgment as to afford them Credit  OUR two Officers were very assiduous at the Grates of a Nunnery in this Place and having there pitch'd upon two Nuns pro∣secuted their Amours with such Vigour that in a little time they had made a very great Progress in their Affections without in the least considering the Dangers that must attend themselves and the Fair they had exchang'd Vows and prevail'd upon the weaker Vessels to endeavour to get out to their Lovers To effect which soon after a Plot was lay'd the Means the Hour and every thing agreed upon  IT is the Custom of that Nunnery as of many others for the Nuns to take their weekly Courses in keeping the Keys of all the Doors The two Lovesick Ladies giving Notice to their Lovers at the Grate that one of their Turns was come the Night and Hour was appointed which the Officers punctually observing carry'd off their Prey without either Difficulty or In∣terruption  BUT next Morning when the Nuns were missing what an Uproar was there over all the City The Ladies were both of Quality and therefore the Tidings were first carry'd to their Relations They re∣ceiv'd the News with Vows of utmost Ven∣geance and as is usual in that Country put themselves in Arms for that Purpose There needed no great canvassing for dis∣covering  who were the Aggressors The Officers had been too frequent and too publick in their Addresses to leave any room for question Accordingly they were complain'd of and sought for but sensible at last of their past Temerity they endeavour'd and with a great deal of Difficulty perfected their Escape  LESS fortunate were the two fair Nuns their Lovers in their utmost Exigence had forsaken them and they poor Creatures knew not where to fly Under this sad Dilemma they were taken and as in like Offences condemn'd directly to the Punish∣ment of  immuring  And what greater Punishment is there on Earth than to be con∣fin'd between four narrow Walls only open at the Top and thence to be half supported with Bread and Water till the Offenders gradually starve to Death  THE Earl of  Peterborow  though highly exasperated at the Proceedings of his Offi∣cers in compassion to the unhappy Fair resolv'd to interpose by all the moderate Means possible He knew very well that no one Thing could so much prejudice the  Spaniard  against him as the countenancing such an Action wherefore he inveigh'd a∣gainst the Officers at the same time that he endeavour'd to mitigate in favour of the Ladies But all was in vain it was urg'd against those charitable Intercessions that  they had broke their Vows and in that had broke in upon the Laws of the Nun∣nery and Religion the Consequence of all which could be nothing less than the Punish∣ment appointed to be inflicted And which was the hardest of all the nearest of their Relations most oppos'd all his generous Me∣diations and those who according to the common Course of Nature should have thank'd him for his Endeavours to be instru∣mental in rescuing them from the impending Danger grew more and more enrag'd be∣cause he oppos'd them in their Design of a cruel Revenge  NOTWITHSTANDING all which the Earl persever'd and after a deal of Labour first got the Penalty suspended and soon after by the Dint of a very considerable Sum of Money a most powerful Argument which prevails in every Country sav'd the poor Nuns from immuring and at last though with great Reluctance he got them receiv'd again into the Nunnery As to the War∣like Lovers one of them was the Year after slain at the Battle of  Almanza  the other is yet living being a Brigadier in the Army  WHILE the Earl of  Peterborow  was here with his little Army of great Hereticks neither Priests nor People were so open in their superstitious Fopperies as I at other times found them For which Reason I  will make bold and by an Antichronism in this Place a little anticipate some Obser∣vations that I made some time after the Earl left it And as I have not often committed such a Transgression I hope it may be the more excusable now and no way blemish my Memoirs that I break in upon the Series of my Journal  VALENCIA  is a handsome City and a Bishoprick and is considerable not only for the Pleasantness of its Situation and beautiful Ladies but which at some cer∣tain Times and on some Occasions to them is more valuable than both those put to∣gether for being the Birthplace of Saint  Vincent  the Patron of the Place and next for its being the Place where  Santo Domingo  the first Institutor of the  Dominican  Order had his Education Here in honour of the last is a spacious and very splendid Convent of the  Dominicans  Walking by which I one Day observ'd over the Gate a Figure of a Man in Stone and near it a Dog with a lighted Torch in his Mouth The Image I rightly enough took to intend that of the Saint but inquiring of one of the Order at the Gate the Meaning of the Figures near it he very courteously ask'd me to walk in and then entertain'd me with the following Relation  WHEN the Mother of  Santo Domingo  said that Religious was with Child of that  future Saint she had a Dream which very much afflicted her She dreamt that she heard a Dog bark in her Belly and in∣quiring at what Oracle is not said the Meaning of her Dream she was told  That that Child should bark out the Gospel  ex∣cuse the Bareness of the Expression it may run better in  Spanish  tho' if I remember right  Erasmus  gives it in  Latin  much the same Turn  which should thence shine out like that lighted Torch  And this is the Reason that wherever you see the Image of that Saint a Dog and a lighted Torch is in the Group  HE told me at the same time that there had been more Popes and Cardinals of that Order than of any if not all the other To confirm which he led me into a large Gal∣lery on each Side whereof he shew'd me the Pictures of all the Popes and Cardinals that had been of that Order among which I particularly took Notice of that of Cardi∣nal  Howard  great Uncle to the present Duke of  Norfolk  But after many  Enco∣miums  of their Society with which he in∣terspers'd his Discourse he added one that I least valu'd it for That the sole Care and Conduct of the Inquisition was intrusted with them  FINDING me attentive or not so con∣tradictory as the  English  Humour generally is he next brought me into a fair and large  Cloister round which I took several Turns with him and indeed the Place was too delicious to tire under a Conversation less pertinent or courteous than that he enter∣tain'd me with In the Middle of the Cloister was a small but pretty and sweet Grove of Orange and Lemontrees these bore Fruit ripe and green and Flowers all together on one Tree and their Fruit was so very large and beautiful and their Flowers so transcendently odoriferous that all I had ever seen of the like Kind in  Eng∣land  could comparatively pass only for Beauty in Epitome or Nature imitated in Waxwork Many Flocks also of pretty little Birds with their chearful Notes added not a little to my Delight In short in Life I never knew or found three of my Senses at once so exquisitely gratify'd  NOT far from this Saint  Vincent  the Patron as I said before of this City has a Chapel dedicated to him Once a Year they do him Honour in a sumptuous Pro∣cession Then are their Streets all strow'd with Flowers and their Houses set off with their richest Tapestries every one strives to excel his Neighbour in distinguishing him∣self by the Honour he pays to that Saint and he is the best Catholick as well as the best Citizen in the Eye of the  religious  who most exerts himself on this Occasion  THE Procession begins with a Cavalcade of all the Friars of all the Convents in and about the City These walk two and two with folded Arms and Eyes cast down to the very Ground and with the greatest out∣ward Appearance of Humility imaginable nor though the Temptation from the fine Women that fill'd their Windows or the rich Tapestries that adorn'd the Balconies might be allow'd sufficient to attract could I observe that any one of them all ever mov'd them upwards  AFTER the Friars is borne upon the Shoulders of twenty Men at least an Image of that Saint of solid Silver large as the Life It is plac'd in a great Chair of Silver likewise the Staves that bear him up and upon which they bear him being of the same Metal The whole is a most costly and curious Piece of Workmanship such as my Eyes never before or since beheld  THE Magistrates follow the Image and its Supporters dress'd in their richest Ap∣parel which is always on this Day and on this Occasion particularly sumptuous and distinguishing Thus is the Image in the greatest Splendor borne and accompany'd round that fine City and at last convey'd to the Place from whence it came And so concludes that annual Ceremony  THE  Valencians  as to the Exteriors of Religion are the most devout of any in  Spain  though in common Life you find them amorous gallant and gay like other People yet on solemn Occasions there shines outright such a Spirit as proves them the very Bigots of Bigotry As a Proof of which Assertion I will now give some Ac∣count of such Observations as I had time to make upon them during two  Lent  Seasons while I resided there  THE Week before the  Lent  commences commonly known by the Name of  Car∣naval Time  the whole City appears a per∣fect  Bartholomew  Fair the Streets are crouded and the Houses empty nor is it possible to pass along without some Gambol or Jackpudding Trick offer'd to you Ink Water and sometimes Ordure are sure to be hurl'd at your Face or Cloaths and if you appear concern'd or angry they rejoyce at it pleas'd the more the more they dis∣please for all other Resentment is at that time out of Season though at other times few in the World are fuller of Resentment or more captious  THE younger Gentry or Dons to ex∣press their Gallantry carry about them Eggshells fill'd with Orange or other sweet Water which they cast at Ladies in their Coaches or such other of the fair Sex as they happen to meet in the Streets  BUT after all if you would think them extravagant to Day as much transgressing  the Rules of common Civility and neither regarding Decency to one another nor the Duty they owe to Almighty God yet when  AshWednesday  comes you will ima∣gine them more unaccountable in their Con∣duct being then as much too excessive in all outwards Indications of Humility and Re∣pentance Here you shall meet one bare∣footed with a Cross on his Shoulder a Burden rather fit for somewhat with four Feet and which his poor Two are ready to sink under yet the vain Wretch bears and sweats and sweats and bears in hope of finding Merit in an Ass's Labour  OTHERS you shall see naked to their Wastes whipping themselves with Scourges made for the Purpose till the Blood fol∣lows every Stroke and no Man need be at a Loss to follow them by the very Tracks of Gore they shed in this frentick Perambu∣lation Some who from the Thickness of their Hides or other Impediments have not Power by their Scourgings to fetch Blood of themselves are follow'd by Surgeons with their Lancets who at every Turn make use of them to evince the Extent of their Patience and Zeal by the Smart of their Folly While others mingling Amour with Devotion take particular Care to pre∣sent themselves all macerated before the Windows of their Mistresses and even in that Condition not satisfy'd with what they  have barbarously done to themselves they have their Operators at hand to evince their Love by the Number of their Gashes and Wounds imagining the more Blood they lose the more Love they shew and the more they shall gain These are ge∣nerally Devoto's of Quality though the Tenet is universal that he that is most bloody is most devout  AFTER these StreetExercises these ostentatious Castigations are over these Selfsacrificers repair to the great Church the bloodier the better there they throw themselves in a Condition too vile for the Eye of a Female before the Image of the Virgin  Mary  though I defy all their Race of Fathers and their infallible holy Father into the Bargain to produce any Authority to fit it for Belief that she ever delighted in such sanguinary Holocausts  DURING the whole Time of  Lent  you will see in every Street some Priest or Frier upon some Stall or Stool preaching up Re∣pentance to the People and with violent Blows on his Breast crying aloud  Mia Culpa mia maxima Culpa  till he extract reciprocal Returns from the Hands of his Auditors on their own Breasts  WHEN  GoodFriday  is come they enter∣tain it with the most profound Show of Re∣verence and Religion both in their Streets and in their Churches In the last parti∣cularly  they have contriv'd about twelve aClock suddenly to darken them so as to render them quite gloomy This they do to intimate the Eclipse of the Sun which at that time happen'd And to signify the Rending of the Vail of the Temple you are struck with a strange artificial Noise at the very same Instant  BUT when  Easter  Day appears you find it in all Respects with them a Day of Rejoicing for though Abstinence from Flesh with them who at no time eat much is not so great a Mortification as with those of the same Persuasion in other Countries who eat much more yet there is a visible Satisfa∣ction darts out at their Eyes which demon∣strates their inward Pleasure in being set free from the Confinement of Mind to the Dissatisfaction of the Body Every Person you now meet greets you with a  Resurrexit Jesus  a good Imitation of the primitive Christians were it the real Effect of Devo∣tion And all Sorts of the best Musick which here indeed is the best in all  Spain  proclaim an auspicious Valediction to the de∣parted Season of superficial Sorrow and stupid Superstition But enough of this I proceed to weightier Matters  WHILE we lay at  Valencia  under the Vigilance and Care of the indefatigable Earl News was brought that  Alicant  was besieg'd by General  Gorge  by Land while  a Squadron of Men of War batter'd it from the Sea from both which the Besiegers play'd their Parts so well and so warmly ply'd them with their Cannon that an in∣different practicable Breach was made in a little time  MAHONI  commanded in the Place being again receiv'd into Favour and clear'd as he was of those political Insinua∣tions before intimated he now seem'd re∣solv'd to confirm his Innocence by a reso∣lute Defence However perceiving that all Preparations tended towards a Storm and knowing full well the Weakness of the Town he withdrew his Garrison into the Castle leaving the Town to the Defence of its own Inhabitants  JUST as that was doing the Sailors not much skill'd in Sieges nor at all times capable of the coolest Consideration with a Resolution natural to them storm'd the Walls to the Side of the Sea where not meeting with much Opposition for the People of the Town apprehended the least Danger there they soon got into the Place and as soon as got in began to Plunder This oblig'd the People for the better Se∣curity of themselves to open their Gates and seek a Refuge under one Enemy in opposition to the Rage of another  GENERAL  Gorge  as soon as he enter'd the Town with a good deal of seeming  Lenity put a stop to the Ravages of the Sailors and ordered Proclamation to be made throughout the Place that all the In∣habitants should immediately bring in their best Effects into the great Church for their better Security This was by the mistaken Populace as readily comply'd with and neither Friend nor Foe at all disputing the Command or questioning the Integrity of the Intention the Church was presently crouded with Riches of all sorts and sizes Yet after some time remaining there they were all taken out and disposed of by those that had as little Property in 'em as the Sailors they were pretended to be preserv'd from  THE Earl of  Peterborow  upon the very first News of the Siege had left  Valencia  and taken Shipping for  Alicant  where he arrived soon after the Surrender of the Town and that Outcry of the Goods of the Townsmen Upon his Arrival  Ma∣honi  who was block'd up in the Castle and had experienced his indefatigable Di∣ligence being in want of Provisions and without much hope of Relief desired to capitulate The Earl granted him honour∣able Conditions upon which he delivered up the Castle and  Gorge  was made Go∣vernor  UPON his Lordship's taking Ship at  Va∣lencia  I had an Opportunity of marching  with those Dragoons which escorted him from  Castile  who had received Orders to march into  Murcia  We quarter'd the first Night at  Alcira  a Town that the River  Segra  almost surrounds which renders it capable of being made a Place of vast Strength though now of small Importance  THE next Night we lay at  Xativa  a Place famous for its Steadiness to King  Charles  General  Basset  a  Spaniard  be∣ing Governor it was besieg'd by the Forces of King  Philip  but after a noble Resistance the Enemy were beat off and the Siege raised for which Effort it is supposed that on the Retirement of King  Charles  out of this Country it was depriv'd of its old Name  Xativa  and is now called  San Felippo  though to this day the Peo∣ple thereabouts much dissallow by their Practice that novel Denomination  WE march'd next Morning by  Monte∣za  which gives Name to the famous Title of Knights of  Monteza  It was at the Time that Colonel  O Guaza  an  Irishman  was Governor besieg'd by the People of the Country in favour of King  Charles  but very ineffectually so it never chang'd its Sovereign That Night we quarter'd at  Fonte dalas Figuras  within one League of  Almanza  where that fatal and unfortu∣nate Battle which I shall give an Account  of in its Place was fought the Year after under the Lord  Galway  ON our fourth days March we were o∣blig'd to pass  Villena  where the Enemy had a Garrison A Party of  Mahoni  's Dragoons made a part of that Garrison and they were commanded by Major  Oroirk  an  Irish  Officer who always carried the Re∣putation of a good Soldier and a brave Gentleman  I had all along made it my Observation that Captain  Matthews  who commanded those Dragoons that I march'd with was a Person of much more Courage than Con∣duct and he us'd as little Precaution here though just marching under the Eye of the Enemy as he had done at other Times As I was become intimately acquainted with him I rode up to him and told him the Danger which in my Opinion attended our present March I pointed out to him just before  Villena  a jutting Hill under which we must unavoidably pass at the turning whereof I was apprehensive the Enemy might lie and either by Ambuscade or otherwise surprize us I therefore in∣treated we might either wait the coming of our Rear Guard or at least march with a little more leisure and caution But he taking little notice of all I said kept on his round March seeing which I press'd forward my Mule which was a very good  one and rid as fast as her Legs could carry her till I had got on the top of the Hill When I came there I found both my Ex∣pectation and my Apprehensions answer'd For I could very plainly discern three Squa∣drons of the Enemy ready drawn up and waiting for Us at the very winding of the Hill  HEREUPON I hastened back to the Captain with the like Speed and told him the Discovery I had made who never∣theless kept on his March and it was with a good deal of Difficulty that I at last pre∣vail'd on him to halt till our Rear Guard of twenty Men had got up to us But those joining us and a new Troop of  Spa∣nish  Dragoons who had march'd towards us that Morning appearing in Sight our Captain as if he was afraid of their rival∣ling him in his Glory at the very turn of the Hill rode in a full Gallop with Sword in Hand up to the Enemy They stood their Ground till we were advanc'd within two hundred Yards of them and then in Confusion endeavoured to retire into the Town  THEY were obliged to pass over a small Bridge too small to admit of such a Com∣pany in so much haste their crouding upon which obstructed their Retreat and left all that could not get over to the Mercy of our Swords which spar'd none However  narrow as the Bridge was Captain  Mat∣thews  was resolved to venture over after the Enemy on doing which the Enemy made a halt till the People of the Town and the very Priests came out to their Re∣lief with fire Arms On so large an Ap∣pearance Captain  Matthews  thought it not adviseable to make any further Advances so driving a very great flock of Sheep from under the Walls he continued his March towards  Elda  In this Action we lost Captain  Topham  and three Dragoons  I remember we were not marched very far from the Place where this Rencounter happen'd when an  Irish  Dragoon over∣took the Captain with a civil Message from Major  O Rairk  desiring that he would not entertain a mean Opinion of him for the Defence that was made since could he have got the  Spaniards  to have stood their Ground he should have given him good Reason for a better The Captain return'd a complimental Answer and so march'd on This Major  O Rairk  or  O Roork  was the next Year killed at  Alkay  being much la∣mented for he was esteemed both for his Courage and Conduct one of the best of the  Irish  Officers in the  Spanish  Service I was likewise informed that he was descend∣ed from one of the ancient Kings of  Ireland  the Mother of the honourable Colonel  Pa∣get  one of the Grooms of the Bedchamber to his present Majesty was nearly related to this Gallant Gentleman  ONE remarkable Thing I saw in that Action which affected and surprized me A  Scotch  Dragoon of but a moderate Size with his large baskethilted Sword struck off a  Spaniard's  Head at one stroke with the same ease in appearance as a Man would do that of a Poppy  WHEN we came to  Elda  a Town much in the Interest of King  Charles  and famous for its fine Situation and the largest Grapes in  Spain  the Inhabitants received us in a manner as handsome as it was peculiar all standing at their Doors with lighted Torches which considering the Time we enter'd was far from an unwelcome or dis∣agreeable Sight  THE next Day several requested to be the Messengers of the Action at  Villena  to the Earl of  Peterborow  at  Alicant  but the Captain return'd this Answer to all that in consideration of the Share that I might just∣ly claim in that Day's Transactions he could not think of letting any other Person be the Bearer So giving me his Letters to the Earl I the next Day deliver'd them to him at  Alicant  At the Delivery Colonel  Killegrew  whose Dragoons they were being present he expressed a deal of Satis∣faction  at the Account and his Lordship was pleased at the same time to appoint me sole Engineer of the Castle of  Alicant  SOON after which that successful Gene∣ral embark'd for  Genoa  according to the Resolutions of the Council of War at  Guadalaxara  on a particular Commission from the Queen of  England  another from  Charles  King of  Spain  and charged at the same time with a Request of the Marquiss  das Minas  General of the  Portugueze  Forces to negotiate Bills for one hundred thousand Pounds for the use of his Troops In all which tho' he was as ever success∣ful yet may it be said without a figure that his Departure in a good measure de∣termin'd the Success of the confederate Forces in that Kingdom True it is the General return'd again with the fortunate Fruits of those Negotiations but never to act in his old auspicious Sphere And there∣fore as I am now to take leave of this for∣tunate General let me do it with Justice in an Appeal to the World of the not to be parallel'd Usage in these latter Ages at least that he met with for all his Services such a vast variety of Enterprizes all suc∣cessful and which had set all  Europe  in amaze Services that had given occasion to such solemn and publick Thanksgivings in our Churches and which had received such ve∣ry remarkable Approbations both of Sove∣reign  and Parliament and which had been represented in so lively a Manner in a Let∣ter wrote by the King of  Spain  under his own Hand to the Queen of  England  and communicated to both Houses in the Terms following  MADAM my Sister  I Should n  t have been so long e'er I did my self the Honour to repeat the Assu∣rances of my sincere Respe  s to you had I not waited for the good Occasion which I now ac∣quaint you with that the City of  Barcelona  is surrendred to me by Capitulation I doubt not but you will receive this great News with intire Satisfaction as well be∣cause this happy Success is the Effect of your Arms always glorious as from the pure Motives of that Bounty and maternal Affec∣tion you have for me and for every Thing which may contribute to the Advancement of my Interest  I must do this Justice to all the Officers and common Soldiers and particularly to my Lord  Peterborow  that he has shew  in this whole Expedition a Constancy  Bravery and Conduct worthy of the Choic  that your Majesty has made of him an  that he could no ways give me bette  Satisfaction than he has by the great Zea  and Application which he has equally testi¦fied  for my Interest and for the Service of my Person I owe the same Justice to Bri∣gadier  Stanhope  for his great Zeal Vigi∣lance and very wise Conduct which he has given Proofs of upon all Occasions As also to all your Officers of the Fleet particularly to your worthy Admiral  Shovel  assuring your Majesty that he has assisted me in this Expedition with an inconceivable Readi∣ness and Application and that no Admiral will be ever better able to render me greater Satisfaction than he has done During the Siege of  Barcelona  some of your Maje∣sty's Ships with the Assistance of the Troops of the Country have reduc'd the Town of  Tarragona  and the Officers are made Pri∣soners of War The Town of  Girone  has been taken at the same Time by Surprize by the Troops of the Country The Town of  Lerida  has submitted as also that of  Tor∣tosa  upon the  Ebro  so that we have taken all the Places of  Catalonia  except  Roses  Some Places in  Aragon  near  Sarragosa  have declared for me and the Garrison of the Castle of  Denia  in  Valencia  have main∣tained their Post and repulsed the Ene∣my of the Enemies Cavalry have en∣ter'd into our Service and a great number of their Infantry have deserted  THIS Madam is the  te that your Arms and the Inclination of the People have put my Affairs in It is unnecessary  to tell you what stops the Course of these Conquests it is not the Season of the Year nor the Enemy these are no Obstacles to your Troops who desire nothing more than to act under the Conduct that your Ma∣jesty has appointed them The taking of  Barcelona  with so small a Number of Troops is very remarkable and what has been done in this Siege is almost without Example that with seven or eight thousand Men of your Troops and two hundred  Mi∣quelets  we should surround and invest a Place that thirty thousand  French  could not block up  AFTER a March of thirteen Hours the Troops climb'd up the Rocks and Pre∣cipices to attack a Fortification stronger than the Place which the Earl of  Peter∣borow  has sent you a Plan of two Ge∣nerals with the Grenadiers attack'd it Sword in Hand In which Action the Prince of  Hesse  died gloriously after so many brave Actions I hope his Brother and his Family will always have your Majesty's Protection With eight hundred Men they forc'd the cover'd Way and all the Intrenchments and Works one after an∣other till they came to the last Work which surrounded it against five hundred Men of regular Troops which defended the Place and a Reinforcement they had receiv'd and three Days afterwards we became  Masters of the Place We afterwards at∣tack'd the Town on the Side of the Castle We landed again our Cannon and the other Artillery with inconceivable Trouble and form'd two Camps distant from each other three Leagues against a Garrison almost as numerous as our Army whose Cavalry was double the Strength of ours The first Camp was so well intrench'd that 'twas defended by two thousand Men and the Dragoons whilst we attack'd the Town with the rest of our Troops The Breach being made we prepar'd to make a general Assault with all the Army These are Circumstances Madam which distinguish this Action perhaps from all others  HERE has happen'd an unforeseen Accident The Cruelty of the pretended Viceroy and the Report spread abroad that he would take away the Prisoners contrary to the Capitulation provok'd the Burghers and some of the Country People to take up Arms against the Garrison whilst they were busy in packing up their Baggage which was to be sent away the next Day so that every thing tended to Slaughter But your Majesty's Troops entering into Town with the Earl of  Peter∣borow  instead of seeking Pillage a Pra∣ctice common upon such Occasions appeas'd the Tumult and have sav'd the Town and even the Lives of their Enemies with a  Discipline and Generosity without Ex∣ample  WHAT remains is that I return you my most hearty Thanks for sending so great a Fleet and such good and valiant Troops to my Assistance After so happy a Begin∣ning I have thought it proper according to the Sentiments of your Generals and Ad∣mirals to support by my Presence the Conquests that we have made and to shew my Subjects so affectionate to my Per∣son that I cannot abandon them I receive such Succours from your Majesty and from your generous Nation that I am loaded with your Bounties and am not a little concern'd to think that the Support of my Interest should cause so great an Expence But Madam I sacrifice my Person and my Subjects in  Catalonia  expose also their Lives and Fortunes upon the Assurances they have of your Majesty's generous Pro∣tection Your Majesty and your Council knows better than we do what is necessary for our Conservation We shall then expect your Majesty's Succours with an entire Confidence in your Bounty and Wisdom A further Force is necessary We give no small Diversion to  France  and without doubt they will make their utmost Efforts against me as soon as possible but I am satisfy'd that the same Efforts will be made by my Allies to defend me Your Goodness Ma∣dam  inclines you and your Power enables you to support those that the Tyranny of  France  would oppress All that I can in∣sinuate to your Wisdom and that of your Allies is that the Forces employ'd in this Country will not be unprofitable to the pub∣lick Good but will be under an Obligation and Necessity to act with the utmost Vigour against the Enemy I am  With an inviolable Affection Respect and most Sincere Acknowledgment Madam my Sister Your most affectionate Brother CHARLES  From the Camp at  Senia  before  Bar∣celona  the  d  of  October    AND yet after all was this noble Ge∣neral not only recall'd the Command of the Fleet taken from him and that of the Army given to my Lord  Galway  without Assignment of Cause but all Manner of Falsities were industriously spread abroad not only to diminish if they could his Re∣putation  but to bring him under Accusa¦tions of a malevolent Nature I can hardl  imagine it necessary here to take Notic  that afterward he disprov'd all those idl  Calumnies and illinvented Rumours or t  mention what Compliments he receiv'd i  the most solemn Manner from his Country upon a full Examination and thorough can∣vassing of his Actions in the House of Lords But this is too notorious to be omitted That all Officers coming from  Spain  were purpose∣ly intercepted in their Way to  London  and craftily examin'd upon all the idle Stories which had pass'd tending to lessen his Cha∣racter And when any Officers had asserted the Falsity of those Inventions as they all did except a military Sweetner or two and that there was no Possibility of laying any thing amiss to the Charge of that Generalthey were told that they ought to be care ful however not to speak advantagiously of that Lord's Conduct unless they were willing to fall Martyrs in his CauseA Thing scarce to be credited even in a popish Country But  Scipio  was accus'dtho' as my Author finely observes by Wretches only known to Posterity by that stupid Ac∣cusation  AS a mournful Valediction before I enter upon any new Scene the Reader will par∣don this melancholy Expostulation How mortifying must it be to an  Englishman  after he has found himself solac'd with a Re∣lation of so many surprizing Successes of her Majesty's Arms under the Earl of  Peter∣borow  Successes that have lay'd before our Eyes Provinces and Kingdoms reduc'd and Towns and Fortresses taken and reliev'd where we have seen a continu'd Series of happy Events the Fruits of Conduct and Vigilance and Caution and Foresight pre∣venting Dangers that were held at first View certain and unsurmountable To change this glorious Landskip I say for Scenes every way different even while our Troops were as numerous as the Enemy and better provided yet always baffled and beaten and flying before the Enemy till fatally ruin'd in the Battle of  Almanza  How mortifying must this be to any Lover of his Country But I proceed to my Me∣moirs  ALICANT  is a Town of the greatest Trade of any in the Kingdom of  Valencia  having a strong Castle being situated on a high Hill which commands both Town and Harbour In this Place I resided a whole Year but it was soon after my first Arrival that Major  Collier  who was shot in the Back at  Barcelona  as I have related in the Siege of that Place hearing of me sought me out at my Quarters and after a particular Enquiry into the Success of that difficult Task that he left me upon and my  answering all his Questions to satisfaction all which he receiv'd with evident Plea∣sure he threw down a Purse of Pistoles upon the Table which I refusing he told me in a mos handsome Manner his Friend∣ship was not to be preserv'd but by my ac∣cepting it  AFTER I had made some very necessary Repairs I pursu'd the Orders I had receiv'd from the Earl of  Peterborow  to go upon the erecting a new Battery between the Castle and the Town This was a Task attended with Difficulties neither few in Number nor small in Consequence for it was to be rais'd upon a great Declivity which must render the Work both laborious and precarious However I had the good Fortune to effect it much sooner than was expected and it was call'd  Gorge  's Battery from the Name of the Governor then com∣manding who out of an uncommon Pro∣fusion of Generosity wetted that Piece of Gossiping with a distinguishing Bowl of Punch Brigadier  Bougard  when he saw this Work some time after was pleas'd to honour it with a singular Admiration and Approbation for its Compleatness not∣withstanding its Difficulties  THIS Work and the Siege of  Carta∣gena  then in our Possession by the Duke of  Berwick  brought the Lord  Galway  down to this Place  Cartagena  is of so  little Distance from  Alicant  that we could easily hear the Cannon playing against and from it in our Castle where I then was And I remember my Lord  Galway  on the fourth Day of the Siege sending to know if I could make any useful Observations as to the Success of it I return'd that I was of Opinion the Town was surrender'd from the sudden Cessation of the Cannon which by our News next Day from the Place prov'd to be fact  Cartagena  is a small SeaPort Town in  Murcia  but has so good an Harbour that when the famous Admiral  Doria  was ask'd which were the three best Havens in the  Mediterranean  he readily return'd  June July  and  Carta∣gena  UPON the Surrender of this Place a De∣tachment of Foot was sent by the Governor with some Dragoons to  Elsha  but it be∣ing a Place of very little Strength they were soon made Prisoners of War  THE Siege of  Cartagena  being over the Lord  Galway  return'd to his Camp and the Lord  Duncannon  dying in  Alicant  the first Guns that were fir'd from  Gorge  's Bat∣tery were the MinuteGuns for his Fune∣ral His Regiment had been given to the Lord  Montandre  who lost it before he had Possession by an Action as odd as it was scandalous  THAT Regiment had received Orders to march to the Lord  Galway's  Camp under the Command of their LieutenantColonel  Bateman  a Person before reputedly a good Officer tho' his Conduct here gave People not invidious too much Reason to call it in Question On his March he was so very careless and negligent though he knew himself in a Country surrounded with Enemies and that he was to march through a Wood where they every Day made their Appearance in great Numbers that his Soldiers march'd with their Mus∣kets slung at their Backs and went one after another as necessity had forc'd us to do in  Scotland  himself at the Head of 'em in his Chaise riding a considerable way before  IT happened there was a Captain with threescore Dragoons detatch'd from the Duke of  Berwick's  Army with a Design to intercept some Cash that was order'd to be sent to Lord  Galway's  Army from  A∣licant  This Detachment missing of that intended Prize was returning very discon∣solately  Re infecta  when their Captain observing that careless and disorderly March of the  English  resolv'd boldly enough to attack them in the Wood To that Purpose he secreted his little Party behind a great Barn and so soon as they were half passed by he falls upon 'em in the Center with  his Dragoons cutting and slashing at such a violent Rate that he soon dispersed the whole Regiment leaving many dead and wounded upon the Spot The three Co∣lours were taken and the gallant Lieu∣tenantColonel taken out of his Chaise and carried away Prisoner with many others only one Officer who was an Ensign and so bold as to do his Duty was kill'd  THE Lieutenant who commanded the Granadiers received the Alarm time enough to draw his Men into a House in their way where he bravely defended himself for a long Time but being killed the rest imme∣diately surrender'd The Account of this Action I had from the Commander of the Enemy's Party himself some Time after while I was a Prisoner And Captain  Ma∣honi  who was present when the News was brought that a few  Spanish  Dragoons had defeated an  English  Regiment which was this under  Bateman  protested to me that the Duke of  Berwick  turn'd pale at the Relation and when they offer'd to bring the Colours before him he would not so much as see them A little before the Duke went to Supper  Bateman  him∣self was brought to him but the Duke turn'd away from him without any further Notice than coldly saying that  he thought he was very strangely taken  The Wags of the Army made a thorough jest of him and  said his military Conduct was of a piece with his Oeconomy having two Days be∣fore this March sent his young handsome Wife into  England  under the Guardianship of the young Chaplain of the Regiment  April  IN the Year being  Easter Monday  we had in the Morning a flying Report in  Alicant  that there had been the Day before a Battle at  Almanza  between the Army under the Command of the Duke of  Berwick  and that of the  English  under Lord  Galway  in which the latter had suffer'd an entire Defeat We at first gave no great Credit to it But alas we were too soon wofully convinced of the Truth of it by Numbers that came flying to us from the conquering Enemy Then indeed we were satisfied of Truths too dif∣ficult before to be credited But as I was not present in that calamitous Battle I shall relate it as I received it from an Offi∣cer then in the Duke's Army  TO bring the Lord  Galway  to a Battle in a Place most commodious for his pur∣pose the Duke made use of this Strata∣gem He ordered two  Irishmen  both Offi∣cers to make their way over to the Enemy as Deserters putting this Story in their Mouths that the Duke of  Orleans  was in a full March to join the Duke of  Berwick  with twelve thousand Men that this would be done in two Days and that then they  would find out the Lord  Galway  and force him to Fight whereever they found him  Battle of  Almanza  LORD  Galway  who at this Time lay before  Villena  receiving this Intelligence from those well instructed Deserters im∣mediately rais'd the Siege with a Resolu∣tion by a hasty March to force the E∣nemy to Battle before the Duke of  Orleans  should be able to join the Duke of  Berwick  To effect this after a hard March of three long  Spanish  Leagues in the heat of the Day he appears a little after Noon in the face of the Enemy with his fatiegu'd Forces Glad and rejoyc'd at the Sight for he found his Plot had taken  Berwick  the better to receive him draws up his Army in a half Moon placing at a pretty good Advance three Regiments to make up the Centre with express Order nevertheless to re∣treat at the very first Charge All which was punctually observ'd and had its desired Effect For the three Regiments at the first Attack gave way and seemingly fled towards their Camp the  English  after their customary Manner pursuing them with Shouts and Hollowings As soon as the Duke of  Berwick  perceiv'd his Trap had taken he order'd his right and left Wings to close by which Means he at once cut off from the rest of their Army all those who had so eagerly pursu'd the imaginary Runa∣ways In short the Rout was total and  the most fatal Blow that ever the  English  re∣ceiv'd during the whole War with  Spain  Nor as it is thought with a great probabi∣lity of Reason had those Troops that made their Retreat to the Top of the Hills under Major General  Shrimpton  met with any bet∣ter Fate than those on the Plain had the  Spaniards  had any other General in the Command than the Duke of  Berwick  whose native Sympathy gave a check to the Ardour of a victorious Enemy And this was the sense of the  Spaniards  themselves after the Battle Verifying herein that no∣ble Maxim  That Victory to generous Minds is only an Inducement to Moderation  THE Day after this fatal Battle which gave occasion to a  Spanish  piece of Wit  that the English General had routed the French  the Duke of  Orleans  did arrive indeed in the Camp but with an Army of only fourteen Attendants  THE fatal Effects of this Battle were soon made visible and to none more than those in  Alicant  The Enemy grew every Day more and more troublesome visiting us in Parties more boldly than before and often hovering about us so very near that with our Cannon we could hardly teach 'em to keep a proper Distance  Gorge  the Gover∣nor of  Alicant  being recall'd into  England  Major General  Richards  was by King  Charles  appointed Governor in his Place  He was a Roman Catholick and very much belov'd by the Natives on that Account tho' to give him his due he behaved him∣self extremely well in all other Respects It was in his Time that a Design was laid of surprizing  Guardamere  a small Seaport Town in  Murcia  But the military Bishop for he was in a literal Sense excellent  tam Marte quam Mercurio  among his many others Exploits by a timely Expedition prevented that  GOVERNOR  Richards  my Post being always in the Castle had sent to desire me to give notice whenever I saw any Parties of the Enemy moving Pursuant to this Order discovering one Morning a consider∣able body of Horse towards  Elsha  I went down into the Town and told the Gover∣nor what I had seen and without any de∣lay he gave his Orders that a Captain with threescore Men should attend me to an old House about a Mile distance As soon as we had got into it I set about barricading all the open Places and Avenues and put my Men in a Posture ready to receive an Enemy as soon as he should appear upon which the Captain as a feint ordered a few of his Men to shew themselves on a rising Ground just before the House But we had like to have caught a Tartar For tho' the Enemy took the Train I had laid and on sight of our small Body on the Hill  sent a Party from their greater Body to in∣tercept them before they could reach the Town yet the Sequel prov'd we had mistaken their Number and it soon appeared to be much greater than we at first imagin'd However our Outscouts as I may call 'em got safe into the House and on the Appear∣ance of the Party we let fly a full Volly which laid dead on the Spot three Men and one Horse Hereupon the whole Body made up to the House but stood aloof up∣on the Hill without reach of our Shot We soon saw our Danger from the number of the Enemy And well for us it was that the watchful Governor had taken notice of it as well as we in the House For ob∣serving us surrounded with the Enemy and by a Power so much superior he marched himself with a good part of the Garrison to our Relief The Enemy stood a little time as if they would receive 'em but upon second thoughts they retir'd and to our no little Joy left us at Liberty to come out of the House and join the Garrison  SCARCE a Day pass'd but we had some visits of the like kind attended sometimes with Rencounters of this Nature in so much that there was hardly any stirring out in Safety for small Parties tho' never so little away There was within a little Mile of the Town an old Vineyard envi∣roned with a lose stone Wall An Officer  and I made an Agreement to ride thither for an Airing We did so and after a little riding it came into my Head to put a Fright upon the Officer And very lucky for us both was that unlucky Thought of mine pretending to see a Party of the Enemy make up to us I gave him the Alarm set Spurs to my Horse and rid as fast as Legs could carry me The Officer no way bated of his Speed and we had scarce got out of the Vineyard but my Jest prov'd Earnest twelve of the Enemy's Horse pursuing us to the very Gates of the Town Nor could I ever after prevail upon my FellowTraveller to believe that he ow'd his Escape to Merri∣ment more than Speed  SOON after my Charge as to the Forti∣fications was pretty well over I obtain'd Leave of the Governor to be absent for a Fortnight upon some Affairs of my own at  Valencia  On my Return from whence at a Town call'd  Venissa  I met two Officers of an  English  Regiment going to the Place from whence I last came They told me after common Congratulations that they had left Major  Boyd  at a little Place call'd  Capel  hiring another Mule that he rode on thither having tir'd and fail'd him de∣siring withal that if I met him I would let him know that they would stay for him at that Place I had another Gentleman in my Company and we had travell'd on not  above a League further whence at a little Distance we were both surpriz'd with a Sight that seem'd to have set all Art at de∣fiance and was too odd for any thing in Nature It appear'd all in red and to move but so very slowly that if we had not made more way to that than it did to us we should have made it a Day's Journey be∣fore we met it My Companion could as little tell what to make of it as I and in∣deed the nearer it came the more mon∣strous it seem'd having nothing of the Tokens of Man either Walking Riding or in any Posture whatever At last com∣ing up with this strange Figure of a Creature for now we found it was certainly such what or rather who should it prove to be but Major  Boyd  He was a Person of him∣self far from one of the least Proportion and mounted on a poor little Ass with all his warlike Accoutrements upon it you will al∣low must make a Figure almost as odd as one of the old  Centaurs  The Morocco Saddle that cover'd the Ass was of Burden enough for the Beast without its Master and the additional Holsters and Pistols made it much more weighty Nevertheless a CurbBridle of the largest Size cover'd his little Head and a long red Cloak hang∣ing down to the Ground cover'd Jack∣boots Ass Master and all In short my Companion and I after we could specifi∣cally  declare it to be a Man agreed we never saw a Figure so comical in all our Lives When we had merrily greeted our Major for a  Cynick  could not have forborn Laughter He excus'd all as well as he could by saying he could get no other Beast After which delivering our Message and condoling with him for his present Mounting and wishing him better at his next Quarters he settled into his old Pace and we into ours and parted  WE lay that Night at  Altea  famous for its Bay for Ships to water at It stands on a high Hill and is adorn'd not defended with an old Fort  THENCE we came to  Alicant  where having now been a whole Year and having effected what was held necessary I once more prevail'd upon the Governor to per∣mit me to take another Journey The Lord  Galway  lay at  Tarraga  while  Le∣rida  lay under the Siege of the Duke of  Orleans  and having some Grounds of Ex∣pectation given me while he was at  Ali∣cant  I resolv'd at least to demonstrate I was still living The Governor favour'd me with Letters not at all to my Disad∣vantage so taking Ship for  Barcelona  just at our putting into the Harbour we met with the  English  Fleet on its Return from the Expedition to  Toulon  under Sir  Cloudsly Shovel  I STAY'D but very few Days at  Barce∣lona  and then proceeded on my intended Journey to  Tarraga  arriving at which Place I deliver'd my Packet to the Lord  Galway  who receiv'd me with very great Civility and to double it acquainted me at the same time that the Governor of  Ali∣cant  had wrote very much in my Favour But though it was a known Part of that noble Lord's Character that the first Im∣pression was generally strongest I had Reason soon after to close with another Saying equally true  That general Rules always admit of some Exception  While I was here we had News of the taking of the Town of  Lerida  the Prince of  Hesse  Brother to that brave Prince who lost his Life before  Monjouick  retiring into the Castle with the Garrison which he bravely defended a long time after  WHEN I was thus attending my Lord  Galway  at  Tarraga  he receiv'd Intelli∣gence that the Enemy had a Design to lay Siege to  Denia  whereupon he gave me Orders to repair there as Engineer After I had receiv'd my Orders and taken Leave of his Lordship I set out resolving since it was left to my Choice to go by way of  Barcelona  and there take Shipping for the Place of my Station by which I pro∣pos'd to save more time than would allow me a full Opportunity of visiting  Montserat  a Place I had heard much Talk of which had fill'd me with a longing Desire to see it To say Truth I had been told such extra∣vagant Things of the Place that I could hardly impute more than one half of it to any thing but  Spanish  Rhodomontado's the Vice of extravagant Exaggeration being too natural to that Nation  Description of  Mont∣serat  MONTSERAT  is a rising lofty Hill in the very Middle of a spacious Plain in the Principality of  Catalonia  about seven Leagues distant from  Barcelona  to the West∣ward somewhat inclining to the North At the very first Sight its Oddness of Fi∣gure promises something extraordinary and even at that Distance the Prospect makes somewhat of a grand Appearance Hun∣dreds of aspiring Pyramids presenting them∣selves all at once to the Eye look if I may be allowed so to speak like a little pe∣trify'd Forrest or rather like the awful Ruins of some capacious Structure the La∣bour of venerable Antiquity The nearer you approach the more it affects but till you are very near you can hardly form in your Mind any thing like what you find it when you come close to it Till just upon it you would imagine it a perfect Hill of Steeples but so intermingled with Trees of Magnitude as well as Beauty that your Admiration can never be tir'd or your Cu∣riosity surfeited Such I sound it on my Ap∣proach  yet much less than what I found it was so soon as I enter'd upon the very Pre∣misses  NOW that stupendious Cluster of Pyra∣mids affected me in a Manner different to all before and I found it so finely group'd with verdant Groves and here and there inter∣spers'd with aspiring but solitary Trees that it no way lessened my Admiration while it increased my Delight Those Trees which I call solitary as standing single in opposition to the numerous Groves which are close and thick as I observ'd when I ascended to take a View of the several Cells rise generally out of the very Clefts of the main Rock with nothing to Ap∣pearance but a Soil or Bed of Stone for their Nurture But though some few Na∣turalists may assert that the Nitre in the Stone may afford a due Proportion of Nou∣rishment to Trees and Vegetables these in my Opinion were all too beautiful their Bark Leaf and Flowers carry'd too fair a Face of Health to allow them even to be the Fosterchildren of Rock and Stone only  UPON this Hill or if you please Grove of Rocks are thirteen Hermits Cells the last of which lies near the very Summit You gradually advance to every one from Bottom to Top by a winding Ascent which to do would otherwise be impossible by reason of the Steepness but though there  is a winding Ascent to every Cell as I have said I would yet set at defiance the most observant if a Stranger to find it feasible to visit them in order if not precaution'd to follow the poor  Borigo  or old Ass that with Paniers hanging on each Side of him mounts regularly and daily up to every particular Cell The Manner is as fol∣lows  IN the Paniers there are thirteen Parti∣tions one for every Cell At the Hour ap∣pointed the Servant having plac'd the Pa∣niers on his Back the Ass of himself goes to the Door of the Convent at the very Foot of the Hill where every Partition is sup∣ply'd with their several Allowances of Vi∣ctuals and Wine Which as soon as he has receiv'd without any further Atten∣dance or any Guide he mounts and takes the Cells gradually in their due Course till he reaches the very uppermost Where having discharg'd his Duty he descends the same Way lighter by the Load he carry'd up This the poor stupid Drudge fails not to do Day and Night at the stated Hours  TWO Gentlemen who had join'd me on the Road alike led by Curiosity seem'd alike delighted that the End of it was so well answer'd I could easily discover in their Countenances a Satisfaction which if it did not give a Sanction to my own much  confirm'd it while they seem'd to allow with me that these reverend Solitaries were truly happy Men I then thought them such and a thousand times since reflecting within my self have wish'd bating their Errors and lesser Superstitions my self as happily sta∣tion'd For what can there be wanting to a happy Life where all things necessary are provided without Care Where the Days without Anxiety or Troubles may be grate∣fully passed away with an innocent Va∣riety of diverting and pleasing Objects and where their Sleeps and Slumbers are never interrupted with any thing more offensive than murmuring Springs natural Cascades or the various Songs of the pretty feather'd Quiristers  BUT their Courtesy to Strangers is no less engaging than their Solitude A recluse Life for the Fruits of it generally speaking produces Moroseness Pharisaical Pride too often sours the Temper and a mistaken O∣pinion of their own Merit too naturally leads such Men into a Contempt of others But on the contrary these good Men for I must call them as I thought them seem'd to me the very Emblems of Innocence so ready to oblige others that at the same In∣stant they seem'd laying Obligations upon themselves This is selfevident in that Affability and Complaisance they use in shewing the Rarities of their several Cells  where for fear you should slip any thing worthy Observation they endeavour to in∣stil in you as quick a Propensity of asking as you find in them a prompt Alacrity in answering such Questions of Curiosity as their own have inspir'd  IN particular I remember one of those reverend old Men when we were taking Leave at the Door of his Cell to which out of his great Civility he accompany'd us finding by the Air of our Faces as well as our Expressions that we thought our selves pleasingly entertain'd to divert us afresh advanc'd a few Paces from the Door when giving a Whistle with his Mouth a sur∣prizing Flock of pretty little Birds varie∣gated and of different Colours immediate∣ly flock'd around him Here you should see some alighting upon his Shoulders some on his awful Beard others took Refuge on his snowlike Head and many feeding and more endeavouring to feed out of his Mouth each appearing emulous and under an inno∣cent Contention how best to express their Love and Respect to their no less pleased Master  NOR did the other Cells labour under any Deficiency of Variety Every one boasting in some particular that might distinguish it in something equally agreeable and enter∣taining Nevertheless crystal Springs spouting from the solid Rocks were from  the highest to the lowest common to the  all and in most of them they had littl  brass Cocks out of which when turn'd issu'd the most cool and crystalline Flows o  excellent pure Water And yet what more affected me and which I found near more Cells than one was the natural Cascades of the same transparent Element these falling from one Rock to another in that warm or rather hot Climate gave not more delightful Astonishment to the Eye than they afforded grateful Refreshment to the whole Man The Streams falling from these soften from a rougher tumultuous Noise into such affecting Murmurs by Distance the Intervention of Groves or neighbouring Rocks that it were impossible to see or hear them and not be charm'd  NEITHER are those Groves grateful only in a beautiful Verdure Nature renders them otherwise delightful in loading them with Clusters of Berries of a perfect scarlet Co∣lour which by a beautiful Intermixture strike the Eye with additional Delight In short it might nonplus a Person of the nicest Taste to distinguish or determine whether the Neatness of their Cells within or the beauteous Varieties without most exhaust his Admiration Nor is the Whole in my Opinion a little advantag'd by the frequent View of some of those pyramidical Pillars which seem as weary of their own  Weight to recline and seek Support from others in the Neighbourhood  WHEN I mention'd the outside Beauties of their Cells I must be thought to have for∣got to particularize the glorious Prospects presented to your Eye from every one of them but especially from that nearest the Summit A Prospect by reason of the Purity of the Air so extensive and so very entertaining that to dilate upon it properly to one that never saw it would baffle Cre∣dit and naturally to depaint it would confound Invention I therefore shall only say that on the  Mediterranean  Side after an agreeable Interval of some fair Leagues it will set at defiance the strongest Opticks and although  Barcelona  bounds it on the Land the Eyes are feasted with the De∣lights of such an intervening Champion where beauteous Nature does not only smile but riot that the Sense must be very temperate or very weak that can be soon or easily satisfy'd  HAVING thus taken a View of all their refreshing Springs their grateful Groves and solitary Shades under single Trees whose Clusters prov'd that even Rocks were grown fruitful and having ran over all the Variety of Pleasures in their several pretty Cells decently set off with Gardens round them equally fragrant and beautiful we were brought down again to the Con∣vent  which though on a small Ascent lies very near the Foot of this terrestrial Pa∣radise there to take a Survey of their sumptuous Hall much more sumptuous Chapel and its adjoining Repository and feast our Eyes with Wonders of a dif∣ferent Nature and yet as entertaining as any or all we had seen before  IMMEDIATELY on our Descent a Priest presented himself at the Door of the Con∣vent ready to shew us the hidden Rarities And though as I understood hardly a Day passes without the Resort of some Strangers to gratify their Curiosity with the Wonders of the Place yet is there on every such Occasion a superior Concourse of Natives ready to see over again out of meer Bigo∣try and Superstition what they have seen perhaps a hundred times before I could not avoid taking notice however that the Priest treated those constant Visitants with much less Ceremony or more Freedom if you please than any of the Strangers of what Nation soever or indeed he seem'd to take as much Pains to disoblige those as he did Pleasure in obliging us  THE Hall was neat large and stately but being plain and unadorn'd with more than decent Decorations suitable to such a Society I hasten to the other  WHEN we enter'd the Chapel our Eyes were immediately attracted by the  Image of our Lady of  Montserat  as they call it which stands over the AltarPiece It is about the natural Stature but as black and shining as Ebony it self Most would imagine it made of that Material though her Retinue and Adorers will allow nothing of the Matter On the contrary Tradi∣tion which with them is on some Occa∣sions more than tantamount to Religion has assur'd them and they relate it as un∣doubted Matter of Fact that her present Colour if I may so call it proceeded from her Concealment in the Time of the  Moors  between those two Rocks on which the Chapel is founded and that her long lying in that dismal Place chang'd her once love∣ly White into its present opposite Would not a Heretick here be apt to say That it was great pity that an Image which still boasts the Power of acting so many Miracles could no better conserve her own Com∣plexion At least it must be allow'd even by a good Catholick to carry along with it Matter of Reproach to the fair Ladies Natives of the Country for their unnatural and excessive Affection of adulterating if not defacing their beautiful Faces with the ruinating Dauberies of  Carmine  AS the Custom of the Place is which is likewise allow'd to be a distinguishing Piece of Civility to Strangers when we approach the black Lady who I should have told  you bears a Child in her Arms but whe∣ther maternally Black or of the  Mulatto  Kind I protest I did not mind the Priest in great Civility offers you her Arm to sa∣lute at which Juncture I like a true blue Protestant mistaking my Word of Com∣mand fell foul on the fair Lady's Face The Displeasure in his Countenance for he took more Notice of the Rudeness than the good Lady her self soon convinc'd me of my Error However as a greater Token of his Civility having admitted no  Spa∣niards  along with my Companions and me it pass'd off the better and his after Civi∣lities manifested that he was willing to re∣form my Ignorance by his Complaisance  TO demonstrate which upon my telling him that I had a Set of Beads which I must entreat him to consecrate for me he readily nay eagerly comply'd and having hung them on her Arm for the Space of about half or somewhat short of a whole Minute he return'd me the holy Baubles with a great deal of Address and most evi∣dent Satisfaction The Reader will be apt to admire at this curious Piece of Supersti∣tion of mine till I have told him that even rigid Protestants have in this Country  thought it but prudent to do the like and likewise having so done to carry them a∣bout their Persons or in their Pockets For Experience has convinc'd us of the Necessity  of this most Catholick Precaution since those who have here travelling or other∣wise come to their Ends whether by Ac∣cident Sickness or the Course of Nature not having these sanctifying Seals found up∣on them have ever been refus'd Christian Burial under a superstitious Imagination that the Corps of a Heretick will infect every thing near it  TWO Instances of this kind fell within my Knowledge one before I came to  Montserat  the other after The first was of one  Slunt  who had been  Bombardier  at  Monjouick  but being kill'd while we lay at  Campilio  a Priest whom I advis'd with upon the Matter told me that if he should be buried where any Corn grew his Body would not only be taken up again but ill treated in revenge of the Destruction of so much Corn which the People would on no account be persuaded to touch for which Reason we took care to have him lay'd in a very deep Grave on a very barren Spot of Ground The other was of one Captain  Bush  who was a Prisoner with me on the Surrender of  Denia  who being sent as I was afterwards to Saint  Clemente la Mancha  there dy'd and as I was inform'd tho' he was private∣ly and by Night bury'd in a CornField he was taken out of his Grave by those super∣stitious People as soon as ever they could discover the Place where his Body was de∣posited  But I return to the Convent at  Montserat  OUT of the Chapel behind the HighAltar we descended into a spacious Room the Repository of the great Offerings made to the Lady Here though I thought in the Chapel it self I had seen the Riches of the Universe I found a prodigious Quan∣tity of more costly Presents the supersti∣tious Tribute of most of the RomanCatho∣lick Princes in  Europe  Among a Multi∣tude of others they show'd me a Sword set with Diamonds the Offering of  Charles  the Third then King of  Spain  but now Emperor of  Germany  Though I must confess being a Heretick I could much easier find a Reason for a fair Lady's pre∣senting such a Sword to a King of  Spain  than for a King of  Spain  's presenting such a Sword to a fair Lady And by the Motto upon it  Pulchra tamen nigra  it was plain such was his Opinion That Prince was so delighted with the Pleasures of this sweet Place that he as well as I stay'd as long as ever he could though neither of us so long as either could have wish'd  BUT there was another Offering from a King of  Portugal  equally glorious and costly but much better adapted and therefore in its Propriety easier to be ac∣counted for That was a Glory for the Head of her Ladiship every Ray of which  was set with Diamonds large at the Bot∣tom and gradually lessening to the very Extremity of every Ray Each Ray might be about half a Yard long and I imagin'd in the Whole there might be about one Hundred of them In short if ever her Ladiship did the Offerer the Honour to put it on I will though a Heretick venture to aver she did not at that present time look like a humane Creature  TO enumerate the rest if my Memory would suffice would exceed Belief As the upper Part was a plain Miracle of Nature the lower was a compleat Treasury of mira∣culous Art  IF you ascend from the lowest Cell to the very Summit the last of all the thirteen you will perceive a continual Contention between Pleasure and Devotion and at last perhaps find your self at a Loss to decide which deserves the Preheminence For you are not here to take Cells in the vulgar Ac∣ceptation as the little Dormitories of soli∣tary Monks No Neatness Use and Contrivance appear in every one of them and though in an almost perfect Equality yet in such Perfection that you will find it difficult to discover in any one of them any thing wanting to the Pleasure of Life  IF you descend to the Convent near the Foot of that venerable Hill you may see more much more of the Riches of the  World but less far less Appearance of a celestial Treasure Perhaps it might be only the Sentiment of a Heretick but that Awe and Devotion which I found in my Attendant from Cell to Cell grew languid and lost in meer empty Bigotry and foggy Superstition when I came below In short there was not a greater Difference in their Heights than in the Sentiments they in∣spir'd me with  BEFORE I leave this Emblem of the bea∣tifick Vision I must correct some thing like a Mistake as to the poor  Borigo  I said at the Beginning that his Labour was daily but the  Sunday  is to him a Day of rest as it is to the Hermits his Masters a Day of Refection For to save the poor faithful Brute the hard Drudgery of that Day the thirteen Hermits if Health per∣mit descend to their  Coenobium  as they call it that is to the Hall of the Convent where they dine in common with the Monks of the Order who are  Benedictines  AFTER seven Days Variety of such in∣nocent Delight the Space allow'd for the Entertainment of Strangers I took my Leave of this pacifick Hermitage to pursue the more boisterous Duties of my Calling The Life of a Soldier is in every Respect the full  Antithesis  to that of a Hermit and I know not whether it might not be a Sense of that which inspir'd me with very great  Reluctancy at parting I confess while on the Spot I over and over bandy'd in my Mind the Reasons which might prevail upon  Charles  the Fifth to relinquish his Crown and the Arguments on his Side never fail'd of Energy when I could per∣suade my self that this or some like happy Retreat was the Reward of abdicated Em∣pire  FULL of these Contemplations for they lasted there I arriv'd at  Barcelona  where I found a Vessel ready to sail on which I embark'd for  Denia  in pursuance of my Orders Sailing to the Mouth of the  Medi∣terranean  no Place along the  Christian  Shore affords a Prospect equally delightful with the Castle of  Denia  It was never design'd for a Place of great Strength be∣ing built and first design'd as a Seat of Pleasure to the Great Duke of  Lerma  In that Family it many Years remain'd tho' within less than a Century that with two other Dukedoms have devolv'd upon the Family of the Duke  de Medina Celi  the richest Subject at this time in all  Spain  DENIA  was the first Town that in our Way to  Barcelona  declar'd for King  Charles  and was then by his Order made a Garrison The Town is but small and surrounded with a thin Wall so thin that I have known a CannonBall pierce through it at once  WHEN I arriv'd at  Denia  I found a  Spaniard  Governor of the Town whose Name has slipt my Memory tho' his Be∣haviour merited everlasting Annals Major  Percival  an  Englishman  commanded in the Castle and on my coming there I un∣derstood it had been agreed between 'em that in case of a Siege which they appre∣hended the Town should be defended wholly by  Spaniards  and the Castle by the  English  I had scarce been there three Weeks be∣fore those Expectations were answered The Place was invested by Count  D' Alfelt  and Major General  Mahoni  two Days after which they open'd Trenches on the East Side of the Town I was necessitated upon their so doing to order the Demolishment of some Houses on that Side that I might erect a Battery to point upon their Trenches the better to annoy them I did so and it did the intended Service for with that and two others which I rais'd upon the Castle from all which we fir'd incessantly and with great Success the Besiegers were sufficiently incommoded  THE Governor of the Town a  Spaniard  as I said before and with a  Spanish  Garri∣son behav'd very gallantly insomuch that what was said of the Prince of  Hesse  when he so bravely defended  Gibraltar  against the joint Forces of  France  and  Spain  might be said of him that he was Governor Engineer Gunner and Bom∣bardier all in one For no Man could ex∣ceed him either in Conduct or Courage nor were the  Spaniards  under him less va∣liant or vigilant For in case the Place was taken expecting but indifferent Quarter they fought with Bravery and defended the Place to Admiration  THE Enemy had answer'd our Fire with all the Ardour imaginable and having made a Breach that as we thought was practicable a Storm was expected every Hour Preparing against which to the great Joy of all the Inhabitants and the Surprize of the whole Garrison and with∣out our being able to assign the least Cause the Enemy suddenly raised the Siege and withdrew from a Place which those within imagined in great Danger  THE Siege thus abdicated if I may use a modern Phrase I was resolved to im∣prove my Time and make the best Provisi∣on I could against any future Attack To that purpose I made several new Fortificati∣ons together with proper Casemets for our Powder all which render'd the Place much stronger tho' Time too soon show'd me that Strength it self must yield to For∣tune  SURVEYING those Works and my Work∣men I was one Day standing on the great  Battery when casting my Eye toward the  Barbary  Coast I observ'd an odd sort of greenish Cloud making to the  Spanish  Shoar Not like other Clouds with Rapi∣dity or Swiftness but with a Motion so slow that Sight itself was a long time be∣fore it would allow it such At last it came just over my Head and interposing between the Sun and me so thickned the Air that I had lost the very Sight of Day At this moment it had reach'd the Land and tho' very near me in my Imagination it began to dissolve and lose of its first Te∣nebrity when all on a sudden there fell such a vast multitude of Locusts as exceed∣ed the thickest storm of Hail or Snow that I ever saw All around me was immediately cover'd with those crauling Creatures and they yet continu'd to fall so thick that with the swing of my Cane I knock'd down thousands It is scarce imaginable the Ha∣vock I made in a very little space of time much less conceivable is the horrid Desola∣tion which attended the Visitation of those  Animalcula  There was not in a Day or two's time the least Leaf to be seen upon a Tree nor any green Thing in a Garden Nature seem'd buried in her own Ruins and the vegetable World to be Supporters only to her Monument I never saw the hardest Winter in those Parts attended with any equal Desolation When glut∣ton  like they had devour'd all that should have sustained them and the more valuable Part of God's Creation whether weary with gorging or over thirsty with devour∣ing I leave to Philosophers they made to Ponds Brooks and standing Pools there revenging their own Rape upon Nature up∣on their own vile Carkasses In every of these you might see them lie in Heaps like little Hills drown'd indeed but attended with Stenches so noisome that it gave the distracted Neighbourhood too great Reason to apprehend yet more fatal Consequences A Pestilential Infection is the Dread of every Place but especially of all Parts upon the  Me∣diterranean  The Priests therefore repair'd to a little Chapel built in the open Fields to be made use of on such like Occasions there to deprecate the miserable Cause of this dreadful Visitation In a Week's time or there abouts the Stench was over and every Thing but verdant Nature in its pristin Order  Denia  be∣sieged a∣gain and taken  SOME few Months after this and about eight Months from the former Siege Count  D' Alfelt  caus'd  Denia  to be again invest∣ed and being then sensible of all the Mistakes he had before committed he now went about his Business with more Regularity and Dis∣cretion The first Thing he set upon and it was the wisest Thing he could do was to cut off our Communication with the Sea  This he did and thereby obtained what he much desired Next he caus'd his Bat∣teries to be erected on the West side of the Town from which he ply'd it so furiously that in five Days time a practicable Breach was made upon which they storm'd and took it The Governor who had so brave∣ly defended it in the former Seige fortu∣nately for him had been remov'd and  Francis Valero  now in his Place was made Prisoner of War with all his Garrison  AFTER the taking the Town they erect∣ed Batteries against the Castle which they kept ply'd with incessant Fire both from Cannon and Mortars But what most of all plagu'd us and did us most Mischief was the vast showers of Stones sent among the Garrison from their Mortars These ter∣rible in Bulk and Size did more Execution than all the rest put together The Gar∣rison could not avoid being somewhat dis∣heartened at this uncommon way of Ren∣counter yet to a Man declar'd against hearkening to any Proposals of Surrender the Governor excepted who having select∣ed more Treasure than he could properly or justly call his own was the only Person that seem'd forward for such a Motion He had more than once thrown out Expressions of such a Nature but without any Effect Nevertheless having at last secretly obtain∣ed a peculiar Capitulation for himself Bag  and Baggage the Garrison was sacrific'd to his private Interest and basely given up Prisoners of War By these Means indeed he saved his Money but lost his Reputati∣on and soon after Life it self And sure every Body will allow the latter loss to be least who will take Pains to consider that it screen'd him from the consequential Scrutinies of a Council of War which must have issued as the just Reward of his Deme∣rits  THE Garrison being thus unaccountably de∣livered up and made Prisoners were dispers∣ed different Ways Some into  Castile  others as far as  Oviedo  in the Kingdom of  Leon  For my own part having received a Contu∣sion in my Breast I was under a ne∣cessity of being left behind with the Enemy till I should be in a Condition to be re∣mov'd and when that time came I found my self agreeably order'd to  Valencia  AS a Prisoner of War I must now bid a∣dieu to the active Part of the military Life and hereafter concern my self with Descrip∣tions of Countries Towns Palaces and Men instead of Battles However if I take in my way Actions of War founded on the best Authorities I hope my Intersper∣sing such will be no disadvantage to my now more pacifick MEMOIRS  SO soon as I arriv'd at  Valencia  I wrote to our Paymaster Mr  Mead  at  Barcelona  letting him know that I was become a Prisoner wounded and in want of Money Nor could even all those Circumstances prevail on me to think it long before he re∣turned a favourable Answer in an Order to Monsieur  Zoulicafre  a Banker to pay me on Sight fifty Pistoles But in the same Let∣ter he gave me to understand that those fifty Pistoles were a Present to me from Ge∣neral afterwards Earl  Stanhope  and so indeed I found it when I return'd into  England  my Account not being charged with any part of it But this was not the only Test I received of that generous Earl's Generosity And where's the Wonder as the World is compell'd to own that Hero∣ick Actions and Largeness of Soul ever did discover and amply distinguish the genuine Branches of that illustrious Family  THIS Recruit to me however was the more generous for being seasonable Bene∣fits are always doubled in their being easily conferr'd and well tim'd and with such an Allowance as I constantly had by the order of King  Philip  as Prisoner of War  viz  eighteen Ounces of Mutton  per diem  for my self and nine for my Man with Bread and Wine in proportion and especially in such a Situation all this I say was sufficient to invite a Man to be easy and almost for∣get his want of Liberty and much more so to me if it be consider'd that that want  of Liberty consisted only in being debarr'd from leaving the pleasantest City in all  Spain  HERE I met with the  French  Engineer who made the Mine under the Rock of the Castle at  Alicant  That fatal Mine which blew up General  Richards  Colonel  Sy∣burg  Colonel  Thornicroft  and at least twenty more Officers And yet by the Ac∣count that Engineer gave me their Fate was their own choosing The General who commanded at that Siege being more industrious to save them than they were to be sav'd He endeavour'd it many ways He sent them word of the Mine and their readiness to spring it he over and over sent them Offers of Leave to come and take a view of it and inspect it Notwith∣standing all which tho' Colonel  Thorni∣croft  and Captain  Page  a  French  Engi∣neer in the Service of Kng  Charles  pur∣sued the Invitation and were permitted to view it yet would they not believe but reported on their Return that it was a sham Mine a feint only to intimidate 'em to a Surrender all the Bags being fill'd with Sand instead of Gunpowder  THE very Day on which the Besiegers design'd to spring the Mine they gave No∣tice of it and the People of the Neigh∣bourhood ran up in Crowds to an opposite Hill in order to see it Nevertheless altho'  those in the Castle saw all this they still remain'd so infatuated as to imagine it all done only to affright 'em At length the fatal Mine was sprung and all who were upon that Battery lost their Lives and a∣mong them those I first mentioned The very Recital hereof made me think within my self  who can resist his Fate  THAT Engineer added further that it was with an incredible Difficulty that he prepar'd that Mine that there were in the Concavity thirteen hundred Barrels of Powder notwithstanding which it made no great Noise without whatever it might do inwardly that only taking away what might be not improperly term'd an Excre∣scence in the Rock the Heave on the Blast had render'd the Castle rather stronger on that Side than it was before a Cre∣vice or Crack which had often occasioned Apprehensions being thereby wholly clos'd and firm  SOME further Particulars I soon after had from Colonel  Syburg's  Gentleman who seeing me at the Playhouse chal∣lenged me tho' at that Time unknown to me He told me that the Night pre∣ceeding the unfortunate Catastrophe of his Master he was waiting on him in the Casemet where he observed sometime before the rest of the Company took notice of it that General  Richards  appeared  very pensive and thoughtful that the whole Night long he was pester'd with and could not get rid of a great Flie which was per∣petually buzzing about his Ears and Head to the vexation and disturbance of the rest of the Company as well as the General himself that in the Morning when they went upon the Battery under which the Mine was the General made many offers of going off but Colonel  Syburg  who was got a little merry and the rest out of a Bravado would stay and would not let the General stir that at last it was pro∣pos'd by Colonel  Syburg  to have the other two Bottles to the Queen's Health after which he promised they would all go off together  UPON this my Relator  Syburg  's Gentle∣man said he was sent to fetch the stipula∣ted two Bottles returning with which Captain  Daniel Weaver  within thirty or forty Yards of the Battery ran by him vowing he was resolv'd to drink the Queen's Health with them but his Feet were scarce on the Battery when the Mine was sprung which took him away with the rest of the Company while Major  Harding  now a Justice in  Westminster  com∣ing that very Moment off Duty exchang'd Fates  IF Predestination in the Eyes of many is an unaccountable Doctrine what better  Account can the wisest give of this Fatality Or to what else shall we impute the Issue of this whole Transaction That Men shall be solicited to their Safety suffered to sur∣vey the Danger they were threatened with among many other Tokens of its approach∣ing Certainty see such a Concourse of Peo∣ple crowding to be Spectators of their im∣pending Catastrophe and after all this so infatuated to stay on the fatal Spot the fetching up of the other two Bottles what∣ever it may to such as never think to such as plead an use of Reason it must admini∣ster Matter worthy of the sedatest Conside∣ration  BEING now pretty well recover'd of my Wounds I was by Order of the Governor of  Valencia  removed to  Sainte Clemente de la Mancha  a Town somewhat more Inland and consequently esteem'd more secure than a SemiSeaport Here I remain'd under a sort of Pilgrimage upwards of three Years To me as a Stranger divested of Acquain∣tance or Friend for at that instant I was sole Prisoner there at first it appear'd such tho' in a very small compass of Time I luckily found it made quite otherwise by an agreeable Conversation  SAINTE Clemente de la Mancha  is rendered famous by the renown'd  Don Michael Cerviantes  who in his facetious but satyrical Romance has fix'd it the  Seat and Birth Place of his Hero  Don Quixot  THE Gentlemen of this Place are the least Priestridden or Sons of Bigotry of any that I met with in all  Spain  of which in my Conversation with them I had daily Instances Among many others an Expression that fell from  Don Felix Pacheco  a Gentle∣man of the best Figure thereabout and of a very plentiful Fortune shall now suffice I was become very intimate with him and we us'd often to converse together with a Freedom too dangerous to be common in a Country so enslav'd by the Inquisition Asking me one Day in a sort of a jocose manner who in my Opinion had done the greatest Miracles that ever were heard of I answer'd Jesus Christ  "It is very true says he Jesus Christ did great Mi∣racles and a great one it was to feed five Thousand People with two or three small Fishes and a like number of Loaves But  Saint Francis  the Founder of the  Franciscan  Order has found out a way to feed daily one hundred Thousand Lub∣bards with nothing at all"  meaning the  Franciscans  the Followers of Saint  Francis  who have no visible Revenues yet in their way of Living come up to if they do not exceed any other Order  ANOTHER Day talking of the Place it naturally led us into a Discourse of the  Knight of  la Mancha Don Quixot  At which time he told me that in his Opinion that Work was a perfect Paradox being the best and the worst Romance that ever was wrote  "For says he tho' it must infallibly please every Man that has any taste of Wit yet has it had such a fatal Effect upon the Spirits of my Country∣men that every Man of Wit must ever resent for continu'd he before the Ap∣pearance in the World of that Labour of  Cerviantes  it was next to an Impossibi∣lity for a Man to walk the Streets with any Delight or without Danger There were seen so many Cavaliero's prancing and curvetting before the Windows of their Mistresses that a Stranger would have imagin'd the whole Nation to have been nothing less than a Race of Knight Errants But after the World became a little acquainted with that no∣table History the Man that was seen in that once celebrated Drapery was pointed at as a  Don Quixot  and found himself the Jest of High and Low And I verily believe added he that to this and this only we owe that dampness and poverty of Spirit which has run thro' all our Councils for a Century past so little agreeable to those nobler Actions of our famous Ancestors"  AFTER many of these lesser sorts of Con∣fidences  Don Felix  recommended me to a Lodging next Door to his own It was at a Widow's who had one only Daughter her House just opposite to a  Franciscan  Nunnery Here I remain'd somewhat up∣wards of two Years all which time lying in my Bed I could hear the Nuns early in the Morning at their  Matins  and late in the Evening at their  Vespers  with Delight enough to my self and without the least Indecency in the World in my Thoughts of them Their own Divine Employ too much employ'd every Faculty of mine to entertain any Thing inconsentaneous or offensive  THIS my Neighbourhood to the Nunnery gave me an opportunity of seeing two Nuns invested and in this I must do a Justice to the whole Country to acknowledge that a Stranger who is curious I would impute it rather to their hopes of Conversion than to their Vanity shall be admitted to much greater Freedoms in their religious Pagean∣tries than any Native  The man∣ner of In∣vesting Nuns  ONE of these Nuns was of the first Quali∣ty which render'd the Ceremony more re∣markably fine The manner of investing them was thus In the Morning her Relations and Friends all met at her Father's House whence she being attir'd in her most sump∣tuous Apparel and a Coronet plac'd on her Head they attended her in Cavalcade to  the Nunnery the Streets and Windows be∣ing crowded and fill'd with Spectators of all sorts  SO soon as she enter'd the Chapel belong∣ing to the Nunnery she kneel'd down and with an appearance of much Devotion sa∣luted the Ground then rising up she ad∣vanced a Step or two farther when on her Knees she repeated the Salutes This done she approached to the Altar where she remain∣ed till Mass was over After which a Ser∣mon was preach'd by one of the Priests in Praise or rather in an exalted Preference of a single Life The Sermon being over the Nun elect fell down on her Knees before the Altar and after some short mental Orai∣sons rising again she withdrew into an in∣ner Room where stripping off all her rich Attire she put on her Nun's Weeds In which making her Appearance she again kneeling offer'd up some private Devotions which being over she was led to the Door of the Nunnery where the Lady and the rest of the Nuns stood ready to receive her with open Arms Thus enter'd the Nuns conducted her into the Quire where after they had entertained her with Singing and playing upon the Organ the Ceremony concluded and every one departed to their proper Habitations  THE very same Day of the Year ensuing the Relations and Friends of the fair Novi∣tiate  meet again in the Chapel of the Nun∣nery where the Lady Abbess brings her out and delivers her to them Then again is there a Sermon preach'd on the same Subject as at first which being over she is brought up to the Altar in a decent but plain Dress the fine Apparel which she put off on her Initiation being deposited on one side of the Altar and her Nun's Weeds on the other Here the Priest in Latin cries  Utrum horum mavis accipe  to which she answers as her Inclination or as her Instruction directs her If she after this her Year of Probation show any Dislike she is at Liberty to come again into the World But if aw'd by Fear as too often is the Case or won by Ex∣pectation or present real Inclination she makes choice of the Nun's Weeds she is im∣mediately invested and must never expect to appear again in the World out of the Walls of the Nunnery The young Lady I thus saw invested was very beautiful and sang the best of any in the Nunnery  THERE are in the Town three Nunneries and a Convent to every one of them  viz  one of  Jesuits  one of  Carmelites  and the other of  Franciscans  Let me not be so far mistaken to have this taken by way of Reflection No Whatever some of our Rakes of the Town may assert I freely de∣clare that I never saw in any of the Nun∣neries of which I have seen many both in  Spain  and other Parts of the World any thing like indecent Behaviour that might give occasion for Satyr or Disesteem It is true there may be Accidents that may lead to a Misinterpretation of which I re∣member a very untoward Instance in  Ali∣cant  WHEN the  English  Forces first laid Siege to that Town the Priests who were apprehensive of it having been long since made sensible of the profound Regard to Chastity and Modesty of us Hereticks by the ignominious Behaviour of certain Officers at  Rota  and  Porta St Maria  the Priests I say had taken care to send away privately all the Nuns to  Majorca  But that the He∣retick Invaders might have no Jealousy of it the fair  Curtezans  of the Town were admit∣ted to supply their Room The Officers both of Land and Sea as was by the Friars preimagin'd on taking the Town and Castle immediately repair'd to the Grates of the Nunnery toss'd over their Handker∣cheifs Nosegays and other pretty Things all which were doubtless very graciously received by those imaginary Recluses Thence came it to pass that in the space of a Month or less you could hardly fall into Company of any one of our younger Officers of either sort but the Discourse if it might deserve the Name was concerning these beautiful Nuns and you wou'd have ima∣gin'd  the Price of these Ladies as well known as that of Flesh in their common Markets Others as well as my self have often en∣deavour'd to disabuse those Glorioso's but all to little purpose till more sensible Tokens convinced them that the Nuns of whose Fa∣vours they so much boasted could hardly be perfect Virgins tho' in a Cloyster And I am apt to think those who would palm upon the World like vicious Relations of Nuns and Nunneries do it on much like Grounds Not that there are wanting In∣stances of Nunneries disfranchis'd and even demolish'd upon very flagrant Accounts but I confine my self to  Spain  IN this Town of  la Mancha  the  Corrigi∣dore  always has his Presidence having six∣teen others under his Jurisdiction of which  Almanza  is one They are changed every three Years and their Offices are the Pur∣chase of an excessive Price which occasi∣ons the poor People's being extravagantly fleeced nothing being to be sold but at the Rates they impose and every Thing that is sold paying the  Corrigidore  an Acknowledg∣ment in specie or an Equivalent to his liking  WHILE I was here News came of the Battle of  Almanar  and  Saragosa  and gi∣ving the Victory to that Side which they espous'd that of King  Philip  they made very great Rejoycings But soon alas for them was all that Joy converted into Sor∣row  The next Courier evincing that the Forces of King  Charles  had been victorious in both Engagements This did not turn to my present Disadvantage For Convents and Nunneries as well as some of those Dons whom afore I had not stood so well with strove now how most to oblige me not doubting but if the victorious Army should march that way it might be in my Power to double the most signal of their Services in my Friendship  SOON after an Accident fell out which had like to have been of an unhappy Con∣sequence to me I was standing in Com∣pany upon the Parade when a most sur∣prizing flock of Eagles flew over our Heads where they hover'd for a considerable time The Novelty struck them all with Admira∣tion as well as my self But I less ac∣customed to like Spectacles innocently say∣ing that in my Opinion it could not bode any good to King  Philip  because the Eagle compos'd the Arms of  Austria  some busie Body in hearing went and inform'd the  Corrigidore  of it Those most magi∣sterial Wretches embrace all Occasions of squeezing Money and more especially from Strangers However finding his Expecta∣tions disappointed in me and that I too well knew the length of his Foot to let my Money run freely he sent me next Day to  Alercon  but the Governor of that  Place having had before Intelligence that the  English  Army was advancing that way refus'd to receive me so I return'd as I went only the Gentlemen of the Place as they had condol'd the first congratulated the last for that  Corrigidore  stood but very indifferently in their Affections However it was a warning to me ever after how I made use of  English  Freedom in a  Spanish  Territory  AS I had attain'd the Acquaintance of most of the Clergy and Religious of the Place so particularly I had my aim in ob∣taining that of the Provincial of the  Car∣melites  His Convent tho' small was ex∣ceeding neat but what to me was much more agreeable there were very large Gar∣dens belonging to it which often furnished me with Sallading and Fruit and much oftner with Walks of Refreshment the most satisfactory Amusement in this warm Cli∣mate This Acquaintance with the Pro∣vincial was by a little Incident soon ad∣vanced into a Friendship which was thus I was one Day walking as I us'd to do in the long Gallery of the Convent when observing the Images of the Virgin  Mary  of which there was one at each end I took notice that one had an Inscription un∣der it which was this  Ecce Virgo pepe∣  it filium  but the other had no Inscription  at all upon which I took out my Pencil and wrote underneath this Line  Sponsa Dei patrisque parens filia filii  THE Friars who at a little distance had observed me as soon as I was gone came up and read what I had writ reporting which to the Provincial he order'd them to be writ over in Letters of Gold and plac'd just as I had put 'em saying doubt∣less such a fine Line cou'd proceed from nothing less than Inspiration This secur'd me ever after his and their Esteem the least advantage of which was a full Liberty of their Garden for all manner of Fruit Sallading or whatever I pleased And as I said before the Gardens were too fine not to render such a Freedom acceptable  THEY often want Rain in this Country To supply the Defect of which I observed in this Garden as well as others an Inven∣tion not unuseful There is a Well in the middle of the Garden and over that a Wheel with many Pitchers or Buckets one under another which Wheel being turn∣ed round by an Ass the Pitchers scoop up the Water on one Side and throw it out on the other into a Trough that by little Channels conveys it as the Gardiner di∣rects into every part of the Garden By this Means their Flowers and their Sallad∣ing  are continually refresh'd and preserved from the otherwise overparching Beams of the Sun  The Dan∣ger of the Inquisition  THE Inquisition in almost every Town in  Spain  and more especially if of any great Account has its Spies or Informers for treacherous Intelligence These make it their Business to ensnare the simple and un∣guarded and are more to be avoided by the Stranger than the Rattle Snake Na∣ture having appointed no such happy Tokens in the former to foreshew the Danger I had Reason to believe that one of those Ver∣min once made his Attack upon me in this place And as they are very rarely if ever known to the Natives themselves I being a Stranger may be allowed to make a guess by Circumstances  I was walking by my self when a Per∣son wholly unknown to me giving me the civil Salute of the Day endeavour'd to draw me into Conversation After Questions had pass'd on general Heads the Fellow ensna∣ringly asked me how it came to pass that I show'd so little Respect to the Image of the crucify'd Jesus as I pass'd by it in such a Street naming it I made Answer that I had or ought to have him always in my Heart crucified To that he made no Re∣ply But proceeding in his Interrogatories question'd me next whether I believ'd a Purgatory I evaded the Question as I  took it to be ensnaring and only told him that I should be willing to hear him offer any Thing that might convince me of the Truth or Probability of it Truth He reply'd in a Heat There never yet was Man so Holy as to enter Heaven without first passing through Purgatory In my O∣pinion said I there will be no Difficulty in convincing a reasonable Man to the contra∣ry What mean you by that cry'd the Spy I mean said I that I can name one and a great Sinner too who went into Bliss without any Visit to Purgatory Name him if you can reply'd my Querist What think you of the Thief upon the Cross said I to whom our dying Saviour said  Hodie eris mecum in Paradiso  At which being silenced tho' not convicted he turned from me in a violent Rage and left me to my self  WHAT increas'd my first Suspicion of him was that a very short time after my Friend the Provincial sent to speak with me and repeating all Passages between the holy Spy and me assur'd me that he had been forc'd to argue in my Favour and tell him that I had said nothing but well  For  says he  all ought to have the Holy Jesus crucified in their Hearts  "Nevertheless continu'd he it is a commendable and good Thing to have him represented in the high Ways For suppose said he  a Man was going upon some base or pro∣fligate Design the very Sight of a cruci∣fied Saviour may happen to subvert his Resolution and deter him from commit∣ting Theft Murder or any other of the deadly Sins"  And thus ended that Con∣ference  I remember upon some other occasional Conversation after the Provincial told me that in the  Carmelite  Nunnery next to his Convent and under his Care there was a Nun that was Daughter to  Don Juan  of  Austria  if so her Age must render her venerable as her Quality  TAKING notice one Day that all the People of the Place fetch'd their Water from a Well without the Town altho' they had many seemingly as good within I spoke to  Don Felix  of it who gave me under the Seal of Secrecy this Reason for it  "When the Seat of the War said he lay in these Parts the  French  Train of Artillery was commonly quarter'd in this Place the Officers and Soldiers of which were so very rampant and rude in attempting to debauch our Women that there is not a Well within the Town which has not some  French  Mens Bones at the bottom of it therefore the Natives who are sen∣sible of it choose rather to go farther a field"  BY this Well there runs a little Rivulet which gives head to that famous River call'd the  Guadiana  which running for some Leagues under Ground affords a pretence for the Natives to boast of a Bridge on which they feed many Thousands of Sheep When it rises again it is a fine large River and after a Currency of many Leagues empties it self into the  Atlantick  Ocean  AS to military Affairs  Almanar  and  Sara∣gosa  were Victories so compleat that no Body made the least doubt of their settling the Crown of  Spain  upon the Head of  Charles  the Third without a Rival This was not barely the Opinion of his Friends but his very Enemies resign'd all Hope or Expectation in favour of King  Philip  The  Castilians  his most faithful Friends enter∣tain'd no other Imagination for after they had advis'd and prevail'd that the Queen with the Prince of  Asturias  should be sent to  Victoria  under the same Despondency and a full Dispiritedness they gave him so little Encouragement to stay in  Madrid  that he immediately quitted the Place with a Resolution to retire into his Grandfather's Dominions the Place of his Nativity  IN his way to which even on the last Day's Journey it was his great good For∣tune to meet the Duke of  Vendome  with some few Troops which his Grandfather  Lewis  XIV of  France  had order'd to his  Succour under that Duke's Command The Duke was grievously affected at such an un∣expected Catastrophe nevertheless he left nothing unsaid or undone that might in∣duce that Prince to turn back and at length prevailing after a little Rest and a great deal of Patience by the Coming in of his scatter'd Troops and some few he could raise together with those the Duke brought with him he once more saw himself at the Head of twenty thousand Men  While Things were in this Manner un∣der Motion in King  Philip  's Favour  Charles  the third with his victorious Army advan∣ces forward and enters into  Madrid  of which he made General  Stanhope  Governor And even here the  Castilians  gave full Proof of their Fidelity to their Prince even at the Time when in their Opinion his Affairs were past all Hopes of Retrieve they them∣selves having by their Advice contributed to his Retreat Instead of prudential Accla∣mations therefore such as might have an∣swered the Expectations of a victorious Prince now entering into their Capital their Streets were all in a profound Silence their Balco∣nies unadorn'd with costly Carpets as was customary on like Occasions and scarce an Inhabitant to be seen in either Shop or Win∣dow  This doubtless was no little Mortificati∣on to a conquering Prince however his  Generals were wise enough to keep him from shewing any other Tokens of Resent∣ment than marching through the City with Unconcern and taking up his Quarters at  Villaverda  about a League from it  NEVERTHELESS King  Charles  visited in his March the Chapel of the Lady  de Ato∣cha  where finding several  English  Colours and Standards taken in the Battle of  Al∣manza  there hung up he ordered 'em to be taken down and restor'd 'em to the  En∣glish  General  IT was the current Opinion then and al∣most universal Consent has since confirm'd it that the falsest Step in that whole War was this Advancement of King  Charles  to  Madrid  After those two remarkable Vi∣ctories at  Almanar  and  Saragosa  had he directed his March to  Pampeluna  and ob∣tain'd Possession of that Place or some other near it he had not only stopt all Succours from coming out of  France  but he would in a great Measure have prevented the ga∣thering together of any of the routed and dispers'd Forces of King  Philip  And it was the general Notion of the  Spaniards  I convers'd with while at  Madrid  that had King  Philip  once again set his Foot up∣on  French  Land  Spain  would never have been brought to have reacknowledged him  KING  Charles  with his Army having stay'd some Time about  Madrid  and see∣ing  his Expectations of the  Castilians  join∣ing him not at all answered at last resolved to decamp and return to  Saragosa  Accord∣ingly with a very few Troops that Prince ad∣vanced thither while the main Body under the Command of the Generals  Stanhope  and  Staremberg  passing under the very Walls of  Madrid  held on their March towards  Aragon  AFTER about three Days March Gene∣ral  Stanhope  took up his Quarters at  Breu∣higa  a small Town half wall'd Gene∣ral  Staremberg  marching three Leagues farther to  Cifuentes  This Choice of Si∣tuation of the two several Armies not a little puzzled the Politicians of those Times who could very indifferently account for the  English  General's lying expos'd in an open Town with his few  English  Forces of which General  Harvey  's Regiment of fine Horse might be deem'd the Main and Ge∣neral  Staremberg  encamping three Leagues farther off the Enemy But to see the Vi∣cissitudes of Fortune to which the Actions of the bravest by an untoward Sort of Fa∣tality are often forced to contribute None who had been Eyewitnesses of the Bravery of either of those Generals at the Battles of  Almanar  and  Saragosa  could find Room to call in question either their Conduct or their Courage and yet in this March and this Encampment will appear a visible ill  Consequence to the Affairs of the Interest they fought for  THE Duke of  Vendosme  having increas'd the Forces which he brought from  France  to upwards of twenty thousand Men marches by  Madrid  directly for  Breuhiga  where his Intelligence inform'd him General  Stan∣hope  lay and that so secretly as well as swiftly that that General knew nothing of it nor could be persuaded to believe it till the very Moment their Bullets from the Ene∣my's Cannon convinc'd him of the Truth  Breuhiga  I have said was wall'd only on one Side and yet on that very Side the Enemy made their Attack But what could a Handful do a∣gainst a Force so much superior though they had not been in want of both Powder and Ball and in want of these were forc'd to make use of Stones against all Sorts of Ammunition which the Enemy ply'd them with The Consequence answered the Deficiency they were all made Prisoners of War and  Har∣vey  's Regiment of Horse among the rest which to augment their Calamity was im∣mediately remounted by the Enemy and march'd along with their Army to attack General  Staremberg  THAT General had heard somewhat of the March of  Vendosme  and waited with some Impatience to have the Confirmation of it from General  Stanhope  who lay be∣tween and whom he lay under an Expecta∣tion  of being joined with However he thought it not improper to make some lit∣tle Advance towards him and accordingly breaking up from his Camp at  Cifuentes  he came back to  Villa viciosa  a little Town between  Cifuentes  and  Breuhiga  there he found  Vendosme  ready to attack him before he could well be prepared for him but no  English  to join him as he had expected nevertheless the Battle was hot and obsti∣nately fought although  Staremberg  had vi∣sibly the Advantage having beat the Ene∣my at least a League from their Cannon at which Time hearing of the Misfortune of  Breuhiga  and finding himself thereby fru∣strated of those expected Succours to sup∣port him he made a handsome Retreat to  Barcelona  which in common Calculation is about one hundred Leagues without any Disturbance of an Enemy that seem'd glad to be rid of him Nevertheless his Baggage having fallen into the Hands of the Enemy at the Beginning of the Fight King  Phi∣lip  and the Duke of  Vendosme  generously return'd it unopen'd and untouch'd in ac∣knowledgment of his brave Behaviour  I HAD like to have omitted one material Passage which I was very credibly inform∣ed of That General  Carpenter  offered to have gone and have join'd General  Starem∣berg  with the Horse which was refus'd him This was certainly an Oversight of the high∣est  Nature since his going would have strengthen'd  Staremberg  almost to the Assu∣rance of an intire Victory whereas his Stay was of no manner of Service but quite the contrary For as I said before the Enemy by remounting the  English  Horse which perhaps were the compleatest of any Regi∣ment in the World turn'd if I may be al∣lowed the Expression the Strength of our Artillery upon our Allies  UPON this Retreat of  Staremberg  and the Surprize at  Breuhiga  there were great Rejoicings at  Madrid  and every where else where King  Philip  's Interest prevailed And indeed it might be said from that Day the Interest of King  Charles  look'd with a very lowering Aspect I was still a Prisoner at  la Mancha  when this News arriv'd and very sensibly affected at that strange Turn of Fortune I was in Bed when the Express pass'd through the Town in order to con∣vey it farther and in the Middle of the Night I heard a certain  Spanish  Don with whom a little before I had had some lit∣tle Variance thundering at my Door en∣deavoring to burst it open with as I had Reason to suppose no very favourable De∣sign upon me But my Landlady who hi∣therto had always been kind and careful calling Don  Felix  and some others of my Friends together sav'd me from the Fury of his Designs whatever they were  AMONG other Expressions of the general Joy upon this Occasion there was a BullFeast at  la Mancha  which being much be∣yond what I saw at  Valencia  I shall here give a Description of These BullFeasts are not so common now in  Spain  as formerly King  Philip  not taking much Delight in them Nevertheless as soon as it was pub∣lish'd here that there was to be one no o∣ther Discourse was heard and in the Talk of the Bulls and the great Preparations for the Feast Men seem'd to have lost or to have lay'd aside all Thoughts of the very Occasion A Week's time was allow'd for the Building of Stalls for the Beasts and Scaffolds for the Spectators and other ne∣cessary Preparations for the setting off their Joy with the most suitable Splendour  ON the Day appointed for the bringing the Bulls into Town the  Cavalieroes  mount∣ed their Horses and with Spears in their Hands rode out of Town about a League or somewhat more to meet them If any of the Bulls break from the Drove and make an Excursion as they frequently do the  Cavaliero  that can make him return again to his Station among his Companions is held in Honour suitable to the Dexterity and Address he performs it with On their Entrance into the Town all the Windows are fill'd with Spectators a Pope passing in grand Procession could not have more for  what can be more than all And he or she who should neglect so rare a Show would give Occasion to have his or her Legitimacy call'd in Question  WHEN they come to the  Plaza  where the Stalls and Scaffolds are built and upon which the Feats of Chivalry are to be per∣formed it is often with a great deal of Diffi∣culty that the Brutes are got in for there are twelve Stalls one for every Bull and as their Number grows less by the enstalling of some the Remainder often prove more untractable and unruly In these Stalls they are kept very dark to render them fiercer for the Day of Battle  ON the first of the Days appointed for a BullFeast commonly lasts three all the Gentry of the Place or near adjacent resort to the  Plaza  in their most gaudy Apparel every one vieing in making the most glorious Appearance Those in the lower Ranks provide themselves with Spears or a great many small Darts in their Hands which they fail not to cast or dart whenever the Bull by his Nearness gives them an Oppor∣tunity So that the poor Creature may be said to fight not only with the Tauriro or Bullhunter a Person always hired for that Purpose but with the whole Multitude in the lower Class at least  ALL being seated the uppermost Door is open'd first and as soon as ever the Bull  perceives the Light out he comes snuffing up the Air and stareing about him as if in admiration of his Attendants and with his Tail cock'd up he spurns the Ground with his Forefeet as if he intended a Challenge to his yet unappearing Antagonist Then at a Door appointed for that purpose enters the Tauriro all in white holding a Cloak in one Hand and a sharp two edged Sword in the other The Bull no sooner sets Eyes upon him but wildly staring he moves gently towards him then gradually mends his pace till he is come within about the space of twenty Yards of the Tauriro when with a sort of Spring he makes at him with all his might The Tauriro knowing by frequent Experience that it behoves him to be watchful slips aside just when the Bull is at him when casting his Cloak over his Horns at the same Moment he gives him a slash or two always aiming at the Neck where there is one particular Place which if he hit he knows he shall easily bring him to the Ground I my Self observ'd the truth of this Experiment made upon one of the Bulls who receiv'd no more than one Cut which happening upon the fatal Spot so stun'd him that he remain'd perfectly stupid the Blood flowing out from the Wound till after a violent Trembling he dropt down stone dead  BUT this rarely happens and the poor Creature oftner receives many Wounds and numberless Darts before he dies Yet whenever he feels a fresh Wound either from Dart Spear or Sword his Rage receives addition from the Wound and he pursues his Tauriro with an Increase of Fury and Violence And as often as he makes at his Adversary the Tauriro takes care with the utmost of his Agility to avoid him and re∣ward his kind Intention with a new Wound  SOME of their Bulls will play their Parts much better than others But the best must die For when they have behav'd them∣selves with all the commendable Fury possi∣ble if the Tauriro is spent and fail of do∣ing Execution upon him they set Dogs upon him Hough him and stick him all over with Darts till with very loss of Blood he puts an end to their present Cru∣elty  WHEN dead a Man brings in two Mules dress'd out with Bells and Feathers and fastening a Rope about his Horns draws off the Bull with the Shouts and Acclamations of the Spectators as if the Infidels had been drove from before  Ceuta  I had almost forgot another very common peice of barbarous Pleasure at these Diver∣sions The Tauriro will sometimes stick  one of their Bull Spears fast in the Ground aslant but levell'd as near as he can at his Chest then presenting himself to the Bull just before the point of the Spear on his taking his run at the Tauriro which as they assur'd me he always does with his Eyes closed the Tauriro slips on one side and the poor Creature runs with a violence often to stick himself and sometimes to break the Spear in his Chest running away with part of it till he drop  THIS  Tauriro  was accounted one of the best in  Spain  and indeed I saw him mount the back of one of the Bulls and ride on him slashing and cutting till he had quite wearied him at which time dismounting he kill'd him with much Ease and to the acclamatory Satisfaction of the whole Con∣course For variety of Cruelty as well as Dexterity administers to their De∣light  THE  Tauriroes  are very well paid and in Truth so they ought to be for they often lose their Lives in the Diversion as this did the Year after in the way of his Calling Yet is it a Service of very great Profit when they perform dextrously For when ever they do any Thing remarkable deserving the Notice of the Spectators they never fail of a generous Gratification Money being thrown down to 'em in plenty  THIS Feast as they generally do lasted three Days the last of which was in my Opinion much before either of the other On this a young Gentleman whose Name was  Don Pedro Ortega  a Person of great Quality perform'd the Exercise on Horse∣back The Seats if not more crowded were filled with People of better Fashion who came from Places at a distance to grace the noble  Tauriro  HE was finely mounted and made a very graceful Figure but as when the Foot  Tauriro  engages the Bull first en∣ters so in the Contest the  Cavaliero  al∣ways makes his Appearance on the  Plaza  before the Bull His Steed was a manag'd Horse mounted on which he made his En∣try attended by four Footmen in rich Li∣veries who as soon as their Master had rid round and paid his Devoirs to all the Spectators withdrew from the Dangers they left him expos'd to The  Cavaliero  having thus made his Bows and received the repeated  Vivas  of that vast Concourse march'd with a very stately Air to the very middle of the  Plaza  there standing ready to receive his Enemy at coming out  THE Door being open'd the Bull ap∣peared and as I thought with a fiercer and more threatning Aspect than any of the for∣mer  He star'd around him for a consider∣able time snuffing up the Air and spurning the Ground without in the least taking no∣tice of his Antagonist But at last fixing his Eyes upon him he made a full run at the  Cavaliero  which he most dexterously avoid∣ed and at the same moment of time pas∣sing by he cast a Dart that stuck in his Shoulders At this the Shouts and  Vivas  were repeated and I observed a Handker∣chief wav'd twice or thrice which as I afterwards understood was a Signal from the Lady of his Affections that she had beheld him with Satisfaction I took notice that the  Cavaliero  endeavour'd all he could to keep aside the Bull for the Advantage of the Stroke when putting his Horse on a full Career he threw another Dart which fix'd in his Side and so enrag'd the Beast that he seem'd to renew his Attacks with greater Fury The  Cavaliero  had behav'd himself to Admiration and escap'd many Dangers with the often repeated Acclama∣tions of  Viva Viva  when at last the en∣raged Creature getting his Horns between the Horse's hinder Legs Man and Horse came both together to the Ground  I expected at that Moment nothing less than Death could be the Issue when to the general Surprize as well as mine the very civil Brute Author of all the Mischief on∣ly  withdrew to the other Side of the  Pla∣za  where he stood still staring about him as if he knew nothing of the Matter  THE  Cavaliero  was carry'd off not much hurt but his delicate Beast suffer'd much more However I could not but think afterward that the good natur'd Bull came short of fair Play If I may be pardon'd the Expressi∣on he had us'd his Adversary with more Humanity than he met with at least since after he had the  Cavaliero  under he gene∣rously forsook him I think he might have pleaded or others for him for better Treat∣ment than he after met with  FOR as the  Cavaliero  was disabled and carry'd off the Foot  Tauriro  enter'd in white Accoutrements as before but he flatter'd himself with an easier Conquest than he found there is always on these Occasions when he apprehends any imminent Danger a Place of Retreat ready for the Foot  Tau∣riro  and well for him there was so this Bull oblig'd him over and over to make Use of it Nor was he able at last to dis∣patch him without a general Assistance for I believe I speak within Compass when I say he had more than an hundred Darts stuck in him And so barbarously was he mangled and slash'd besides that in my Mind I could not but think King  Philip  in the Right when he said  That it was a Custom deserv'd little Encouragement  SOON after this  Tauridore  or BullFeast was over I had a Mind to take a pleasant Walk to a little Town call'd  Minai  about three Leagues off but I was scarce got out of  la Mancha  when an Acquaintance meet∣ing me ask'd where I was going I told him to  Minai  when taking me by the Hand  Friend  Gorgio says he in  Spanish Come back with me you shall not go a Stride further there are  Picarons  that Way you shall not go  Inquiring as we went back into his Meaning he told me that the Day before a Man who had received a Sum of Money in Pistoles at  la Mancha  was on the Road set upon by some who had got notice of it and murdered him that not finding the Money expected about him for he had cautiously enough left it in a Friend's Hands at  la Mancha  they concluded he had swallowed it and therefore they ript up his Belly and open'd every Gut but all to as little Purpose This diverted my Walk for that Time  BUT some little Time after the same Per∣son inviting me over to the same Place to see his MelonGrounds which in that Coun∣try are wonderful fine and pleasant I ac∣cepted his Invitation and under the Advan∣tage of his Company went thither On the Road I took notice of a Cross newly erected and a Multitude of small Stones a∣round the Foot of it Asking the Meaning  whereof my Friend told me that it was rais'd for a Person there murder'd as is the Custom throughout  Spain  and that every good Catholick passing by held it his Du∣ty to cast a Stone upon the Place in De∣testation of the Murder I had often before taken Notice of many such Crosses but never till then knew the Meaning of their Erection or the Reason of the Heaps of Stones around them  THERE is no Place in all  Spain  more fa∣mous for good Wine than  Sainte Clemente de la Mancha  nor is it any where sold cheaper For as it is only an inland Town near no navigable River and the People temperate to a Proverb great Plenty and a small Vend must consequently make it cheap The Wine here is so famous that when I came to  Madrid  I saw wrote over the Doors of most Houses that sold Wine  Vino Sainte Clemente  As to the Temperance of the People I must say that notwithstand∣ing those two excellent Qualities of good and cheap I never saw all the three Years I was Prisoner there any one Person over∣come with Drinking  IT is true there may be a Reason and a political one assign'd for that Abstemious∣ness of theirs which is this That if any Man upon any Occasion should be brought in as an Evidence against you if you can prove that he was ever drunk it will in∣validate  his whole Evidence I could not but think this a grand Improvement upon the  Spartans  They made their Slaves pur∣posely drunk to shew their Youth the Fol∣ly of the Vice by the sottish Behaviour of their Servants under it But they never reach'd to that noble height of laying a Pe∣nalty upon the Aggressor or of discoura∣ging a voluntary Impotence of Reason by a disreputable Impotence of Interest The  Spaniard  therefore in my Opinion in this exceeds the  Spartan  as much as a natural Beauty exceeds one procured by Art for tho' Shame may somewhat influence some few Terrour is of force to deter all A Man we have seen it may shake Hands with Shame but  Interest  says another Proverb  will never lye  A wise Institution therefore doubtless is this of the  Spaniard  but such as I fear will never take Place in  Germany Holland France  or  Great Britain  BUT though I commend their Tempe∣rance I would not be thought by any Means to approve of their Bigotry If there may be such a Thing as Intemperance in Religion I much fear their Ebriety in that will be found to be overmeasure Under the notion of Devotion I have seen Men a∣mong 'em and of Sense too guilty of the grossest Intemperancies It is too common  to be a rarity to see their Dons of the prime Quality as well as those of the lower Ranks upon meeting a Priest in the open Streets con∣descend to take up the lower part of his Vestment and salute it with Eyes erected as if they look'd upon it as the Seal of Sal∣vation  WHEN the  AveBell  is heard the Hearer must down on his Knees upon the very Spot nor is he allowed the small Indulgence of deferring a little till he can recover a clean Place Dirtiness excuses not nor will dirty Actions by any means exempt This is so notorious that even at the Playhouse in the middle of a Scene on the first sound of the Bell the Actors drop their Discourse the Auditors supersede the indulging of their unsanctified Ears and all on their Knees bend their Tongues if not their Hearts quite a different way to what they just before had been employ'd in In short tho' they pretend in all this to an extraor∣dinary Measure of Zeal and real Devotion no Man that lives among them any time can be a Proselyte to them without immola∣ting his Senses and his Reason Yet I must confess while I have seen them thus delude∣ing themselves with  Ave Marias  I cou'd not refrain throwing up my Eyes to the only proper Object of Adoration in commiserati∣on of such Delusions  THE Hours of the  Ave Bell  are eight and twelve in the Morning and six in the Evening They pretend at the first to fall down to beg that God would be pleas'd to prosper them in all things they go about that Day At twelve they return Thanks for their Preservation to that time and at six for that of the whole Day After which one would think that they imagine them∣selves at perfect Liberty and their open Gallantries perfectly countenance the Ima∣gination For tho' Adultery is look'd upon as a grievous Crime and punish'd according∣ly yet Fornication is softned with the title of a Venial Sin and they seem to practise it under that Persuasion  I found here what  Erasmus  ridicules with so much Wit and Delicacy the Cu∣stom of burying in a  Franciscan  's Habit in mighty request If they can for that pur∣pose procure an old one at the price of a new one the Purchaser will look upon himself a provident Chap that has secur'd to his deceased Friend or Relation no less than Heaven by that wise Bargain  THE Evening being almost the only time of Enjoyment of Company or Conversa∣tion every body in  Spain  then greedily seeks it and the Streets are at that time crowd∣ed like our finest Gardens or most private Walks On one of those Occasions I met  a Don of my Acquaintance walking out with his Sisters and as I thought it became an  English  Cavalier I saluted him But to my Surprize he never return'd the Civility When I met him the Day after instead of an Apology as I had flatter'd my self I receiv'd a Reprimand tho' a very civil one telling me it was not the Custom in  Spain  nor well taken of any one that took No∣tice of any who were walking in the Com∣pany of Ladies at Night  BUT a Night or two after I found by Experience that if the Men were by Cu∣stom prohibited taking Notice Women were not I was standing at the Door in the cool of the Evening when a Woman seemingly genteel passing by call'd me by my Name telling me she wanted to speak with me She had her  Mantilio  on so that had I had Daylight I could have only seen one Eye of her However I walk'd with her a good while without being able to discover any thing of her Business nor pass'd there between us any thing more than a Conversation upon indifferent Matters Ne∣vertheless at parting she told me she should pass by again the next Evening and if I would be at the Door she would give me the same Advantage of a Conversation that seem'd not to displease me Accordingly the next Night she came and as before we  walk'd together in the privatest parts of the Town For tho' I knew her not her Dis∣course was always entertaining and full of Wit and her Enquiries not often improper We had continu'd this Intercourse many Nights together when my Landlady's Daughter having taken Notice of it stopt me one Evening and would not allow me to stand at the usual Post of Intelligence saying with a good deal of heat Don Gorgio  take my Advice go no more along with that Woman You may soon be brought home deprived of your Life if you do  I cannot say whether she knew her but this I must say she was very agreeable in Wit as well as Person However my Land∣lady and her Daughter took that Opportu∣nity of giving me so many Instances of the fatal Issues of such innocent Conversations for I could not call it an Intrigue that apprehensive enough of the Danger on lay∣ing Circumstances together I took their Ad∣vice and never went into her Company after  Sainte Clemente de la Mancha  where I so long remain'd a Prisoner of War lies in the Road from  Madrid  to  Valencia  and the Duke of  Vendosme  being ordered to the latter great Preparations were made for his Entertainment as he pass'd through He stay'd here only one Night where he was  very handsomely treated by the  Corrigidore  He was a tall fair Person and very fat and at the time I saw him wore a long black Patch over his left Eye but on what Oc∣casion I could not learn The afterwards famous  Alberoni  since made a Cardinal was in his Attendance as indeed the Duke was very rarely without him I remember that very Day three Weeks they return'd through the same Place the Duke in his Herse and  Alberoni  in a Coach paying his last Duties That Duke was a prodigious Lover of Fish of which having eat over heartily at  Veneros  in the Province of  Va∣lencia  he took a Surfeit and died in three Days time His Corps was carrying to the  Escurial  there to be buried in the  Panthae∣on  among their Kings  THE  Castilians  have a Privilege by Li∣cence from the Pope which if it could have been converted into a Prohibition might have sav'd that Duke's Life In regard their Country is wholly inland and the River  Tagus  famous for its Poverty or rather Barrenness their Holy Father indulges the Natives with the Liberty in lieu of that dangerous Eatable of eating all Lent time the Inwards of Cattle When I first heard this related I imagin'd that the Garbidge had been intended but I was soon after thus rectify'd  by Inwards  for  so expresly says the Licence it self  is meant the Heart the Liver and the Feet  THEY have here as well as in most other Parts of  Spain Valencia  excepted the most wretched Musick in the Universe Their  Guitars  if not their  Sole  are their darling Instruments and what they most delight in Tho' in my Opinion our  English  Sailors are not much amiss in giving them the Title of  Strum Strums  They are little better than our  Jewsharps  tho' hardly half so Musical Yet are they perpetually at Nights disturbing their Women with the Noise of them under the notion and name of Serenadoes From the Barber to the Grandee the Infection spreads and very often with the same Attendant Danger Night Quarrels and Rencounters being the frequent Result The true born  Spani∣ards  reckon it a part of their Glory to be jealous of their Mistresses which is too often the Forerunner of Mur∣ders or at best attended with many other very dangerous Inconveniences And yet bad as their Musick is their Dancing is the reverse I have seen a Country Girl ma∣nage her Castanets with the graceful Air of a Dutchess and that not to common Mu∣sick but to Peoples beating or druming a Tune with their Hands on a Table I have seen half a Dozen couple at a time dance to the like in excellent order  I just now distinguish'd by an Exception the Musick of  Valencia  where alone I ex∣perienced the use of the  Violin  which tho' I cannot in respect to other Countries call good yet in respect to the other parts of  Spain  I must acknowledge it much the best In my Account of that City I omit∣ted to speak of it therefore now to supply that Defect I will speak of the best I heard which was on this unfortunate Occasion Several Natives of that Country having received Sentence of Death for their Adhe∣rence to King  Charles  were accordingly ordered to the Place of Execution It is the Custom there on all such Occasions for all the Musick of the City to meet near the Gallows and play the most affecting and melancholy Airs to the very approach of the Condemn'd and really the Musick was so moving it heightened the Scene of Sorrow and brought Compassion into the Eyes of even Enemies  AS to the Condemn'd they came stript of their own Cloaths and cover'd with black Frocks in which they were led a∣long the Streets to the Place of Execution the Friars praying all the way When they came through any Street where any publick Images were fix'd they stay'd be∣fore 'em some reasonable time in Prayer with the Friars When they are arriv'd at the  fatal Place those Fathers leave 'em not but continue praying and giving them ghostly Encouragement standing upon the rounds of the Ladder till they are turn'd off The Hangman always wears a silver Badge of a Ladder to distinguish his Profession But his manner of executing his Office had somewhat in it too singular to allow of Si∣lence When he had ty'd fast the Hands of the Criminal he rested his Knee upon them and with one Hand on the Criminal's No∣strils to stop his Breath the sooner threw himself off the Ladder along with the dying Party This he does to expedite his Fate tho' considering the Force I wonder it does not tear Head and Body asunder which yet I never heard that it did  BUT to return to  la Mancha  I had been there now upwards of two Years much divert∣ed with the good Humour and Kindness of the Gentlemen and daily pleased with the Conversation of the Nuns of the Nunnery opposite to my Lodgings when walking one Day alone upon the  Plaza  I found my self accosted by a  Clerico  At the first Attack he told me his Country But added that he now came from  Madrid  with a  Potent  that was his Word from  Pedro de Dios  Dean of the Inquisition to endea∣vour the Conversion of any of the  English  Prisoners that being an  Irishman  as a sort  of a Brother he had conceived a Love for the  English  and therefore more eagerly embraced the Opportunity which the Holy Inquisition had put into his Hands for the bringing over to Mother Church as many Hereticks as he could that having heard a very good Character of me he should think himself very happy if he could be instru∣mental in my Salvation  "It is very true continu'd he I have lately had the good Fortune to convert many and besides the Candour of my own Disposition I must tell you that I have a peculiar knack at Conversion which very few if any ever could resist I am going upon the same work into  Murcia  but your good Character has fix'd me in my Resolution of preferring your Salvation to that of others"  TO this very long and no less surprizing Address I only return'd that it being an Affair of moment it would require some Consideration and that by the time he re∣turn'd from  Murcia  I might be able to re∣turn him a proper Answer But not at all sa∣tisfy'd with this Reply  "Sir says he God Almighty is allsufficient This mo∣ment is too precious to be lost he can turn the Heart in the twinkling of an Eye as well as in twenty Years Hear me then mind what I say to you I will convince you immediately You Here∣ticks  do not believe in Transubstantia∣tion and yet did not our Saviour say in so many Words  Hoc est corpus meum  And if you don't believe him don't you give him the Lye Besides does not one of the Fathers say  Deus qui est omnis Veritas non potest dicere falsum  "  He went on at the same ridiculous rate which soon convinced me he was a thorough Rattle However as a  Clerico  and con∣sequently in this Country a Man dangerous to disoblige I invited him home to Dinner where when I had brought him I found I had no way done an unacceptable thing for my Landlady and her Daughter seeing him to be a Clergyman receiv'd him with a vast deal of Respect and Pleasure  DINNER being over he began to enter∣tain me with a Detail of the many wonder∣ful Conversions he had made upon obsti∣nate Hereticks that he had convinced the most Stubborn and had such a  Nostrum  that he would undertake to convert any one Here he began his old round inter∣mixing his Harangue with such scraps and raw sentences of fustian  Latin  that I grew weary of his Conversation so pretending some Business of consequence I took leave and left him and my Landlady together  I did not return till pretty late in the E∣vening with Intent to give him Time e∣nough to think his own Visit tedious but  to my great Surprize I found my  Irish  Mis∣sionary still on the Spot ready to dare me to the Encounter and resolv'd like a true Son of the Church militant to keep last in the Field of Battle As soon as I had seat∣ed my self he began again to tell me how good a Character my Landlady had given me which had prodigiously increased his Ardour of saving my Soul that he could not answer it to his own Character as well as mine to be negligent and therefore he had enter'd into a Resolution to stay my Coming though it had been later To all which I return'd him Abundance of Thanks for his good Will but pleading Indisposition and want of Rest after a good deal of civil Impertinence I once more got rid of him at least I took my Leave and went to Bed leaving him again Master of the Field for I understood next Morning that he stay'd some Time after I was gone with my good Landlady  Next Morning the Nuns of the Nunnery opposite having taken Notice of the  Cleri∣co  's Ingress long Visit and late Egress sent to know whether he was my Countryman with many other Questions which I was not then let into the Secret of To all which I return'd that he was no Countryman of mine but an  Irishman  and so perfectly a Stranger to me that I knew no more of him than what I had from his own Mouth  that he was going into  Murcia  What the Meaning of this Enquiry was I could never learn but I could not doubt but it proceed∣ed from their great Care of their  Vicino  as they call'd me a Mark of their E∣steem and of which I was not a little proud  AS was my usual Custom I had been ta∣king my Morning Walk and had not been long come home in order to Dinner when in again drops my  Irish Clerico  I was con∣founded and vexed and he could not a∣void taking Notice of it nevertheless with∣out the least Alteration of Countenance he took his Seat and on my saying in a cold and indifferent Tone that I imagin'd he had been got to  Murcia  before this he reply'd with a natural Fleer that truely he was going to  Murcia  but his Conscience prick∣ed him and he did find that he could not go away with any Satisfaction or Peace of Mind without making me a perfect Con∣vert that he had plainly discovered in me a good Disposition and had for that ve∣ry Reason put himself to the Charge of Man and Mule to the Bishop of  Cuenca  for a License under his Hand for my Conver∣sion For in  Spain  all private Missionaries are obliged to ask Leave of the next Bishop before they dare enter upon any Enterprize of this Nature  I was more confounded at this last Assu∣rance of the Man than at all before and it put me directly upon reflecting whether any and what Inconveniencies might en∣sue from a Rencounter that I at first con∣ceiv'd ridiculous but might now reasona∣bly begin to have more dangerous Appre∣hensions of I knew by the Articles of War all Persons are exempted from any Power of the Inquisition but whether car∣rying on a Part in such a Farce might not admit or at least be liable to some dange∣rous Construction was not imprudently now to be considered Though I was not fear∣ful yet I resolv'd to be cautious Where∣fore not making any Answer to his Declara∣tion about the Bishop he took Notice of it and to raise a Confidence he found expiring began to tell me that his Name was  Mur∣tough Brennan  that he was born near  Kil∣kenny  of a very considerable Family This last part indeed when I came to  Madrid  I found pretty well confirm'd in a conside∣rable Manner However taking Notice that he had alter'd his Tone of leaving the Town and that instead of it he was ad∣vancing somewhat like an Invitation of him∣self to Dinner the next Day I resolv'd to show my self shy of him and thereupon abruptly and without taking any Leave I left the Room and my Landlady and him together  THREE or four Days had passed every one of which he never fail'd my Lodgings not at Dinner Time only but Night and Morning too from all which I began to suspect that instead of my Conversion he had fix'd upon a Reconversion of my Landlady She was not young yet for a black Woman handsom enough and her Daughter very pretty I entered into a Re∣solution to make my Observations and watch them all at a Distance nevertheless carefully concealing my Jealousy However I must confess I was not a little pleas'd that any Thing could divert my own Persecuti∣on He was now no longer my Guest but my Landlady's with whom I found him so much taken up that a little Care might fru∣strate all his former impertinent Importuni∣ties on the old Topick  BUT all my Suspicions were very soon after turn'd into Certainties in this Manner I had been abroad and returning somewhat weary I went to my Chamber to take what in that Country they call a  Cesto  up∣on my Bed I got in unseen or without seeing any Body but had scarce laid my self down before my young Landlady as I jestingly us'd to call the Daughter rushing into my Room threw her self down on the Floor bitterly exclaiming I started off my Bed and immediately running to the Door who should I meet there but my  I∣rish  Clerico  without his Habit and in his Shirt I could not doubt by the  Dishabil∣lè  of the  Clerico  but the young Creature had Reason enough for her Passion which render'd me quite unable to master mine wherefore as he stood with his Back next the Door I thrust him in that ghostly Plight in∣to the open Street  I might with leisure enough have re∣pented that precipitate Piece of Indiscretion if it had not been for his bad Character and the favourable Opinion the Town had conceived of me for he inordinately ex∣claim'd against me calling me Heretick and telling the People who were soon gathered round him that coming to my Lodgings on the charitable work of Conversion I had thus abus'd him stript him of his Habit and then turn'd him out of Doors The Nuns on their hearing the Outcries he made came running to their Grates to enquire into the Matter and when they understood it as he was pleas'd to relate it though they condemn'd my Zeal they pity'd my Condition Very well was it for me that I stood more than a little well in the good Opinion of the Town among the Gentry by my frequent Conversation and the in∣ferior Sort by my charitable Distributions for nothing can be more dangerous or a nearer Way to violent Fate than to insult one of the Clergy in  Spain  and especial∣ly  for such an one as they entitle a Here∣tick  MY old Landlady I speak in respect to her Daughter however formerly my seem∣ing Friend came in a violent Passion and wrenching the Door out of my Hands open∣ed it and pull'd her  Clerico  in and so soon as she had done this she took his Part and railed so bitterly at me that I had no Reason longer to doubt her thorough Conversion under the full Power of his Mission How∣ever the young one stood her Ground and by all her Expressions gave her many In∣quirers Reason enough to believe all was not Matter of Faith that the  Clerico  had ad∣vanced Nevertheless holding it advisea∣ble to change my Lodgings and a Friend confirming my Resolutions I removed that Night  The  Clerico  having put on his upper Gar∣ments was run away to the  Corrigidor  in a violent Fury resolving to be early as well knowing that he who tells his Story first has the Prospect of telling it to double Advantage When he came there he told that Officer a thousand idle Stories and in the worst Manner repeating how I had a∣bus'd him and not him only but my poor Landlady for taking his Part The  Corri∣gidor  was glad to hear it all and with an officious Ear fish'd for a great deal more expecting according to Usage at last to  squeeze a Sum of Money out of me How∣ever he told the  Clerico  that as I was a Pri∣soner of War he had no direct Power over me but if he would immediately write to the President  Ronquillo  at  Madrid  he would not fail to give his immediate Orders according to which he would as readily act against me  THE  Clerico  resolv'd to pursue his old Maxim and cry out first and so taking the  Corrigidor  's Advice he wrote away to  Madrid  directly In the mean Time the People in the Town both high and low some out of Curiosity some out of Friend∣ship pursu'd their Enquiries into the Reality of the Facts The old Landlady they could make little of to my Advantage but when∣ever the young one came to the Question she always left them with these Words in her Mouth  El Diabolo en forma del Cleri∣co  which rendring Things more than a lit∣tle cloudy on the  Clerico  's Side he was ad∣vis'd and press'd by his few Friends as fast as he could to get out of Town Nuns Cler∣gy and every Body taking Part against him excepting his new Convert my old Landlady  The Day after as I was sitting with a Friend at my new Quarters  Maria  for that was the Name of my Landlady's Daugh∣ter came running in with these Words in her Mouth  El Clerico el Clerico passa la  Calle  We hasten'd to the Window out of which we beheld the  Clerico Murtough Brennan  pitifully mounted on the Back of a very poor Ass for they would neither let nor lend him a Mule through all the Town his Legs almost rested on the Ground for he was lusty as his Ass was little and a Fellow with a large Cudgel march'd afoot driving his Ass along Never did  Sancha Pancha  on his Embassage to  Dulcinea  make such a despicable out of the way Fi∣gure as our  Clerico  did at this Time And what increas'd our Mirth was their telling me that our  Clerico  like that Squire tho' upon his own PriestErrantry was actually on his March to  Toboso  a Place five Leagues off famous for the Nativity of  Dulcinea  the Object of the Passion of that celebrated Hero  Don Quixot  So I will leave our  Cle∣rico  on his Journey to  Murcia  to relate the unhappy Sequel of this ridiculous Af∣fair  I have before said that by the Advice of the  Corrigidor  our  Clerico  had wrote to  Don Ronquillo  at  Madrid  About a Fort∣night after his Departure from  la Mancha  I was sitting alone in my new Lodgings when two  Alguizils  Officers under the  Corrigidor  and in the Nature of our Bailiffs came into my Room but very civilly to tell me that they had Orders to carry me away to Prison but at the same Moment  they advis'd me not to be afraid for they had observed that the whole Town was concern'd at what the  Corrigidor  and  Clerico  had done adding that it was their Opini∣on that I should find so general a Friend∣ship that I need not be apprehensive of any Danger With these plausible Speeches though I afterwards experienced the Truth of them I resign'd my self and went with them to a much closer Confinement  I had not been there above a Day or two before many Gentlemen of the Place sent to me to assure me they were heartily afflicted at my Confinement and resolv'd to write in my Favour to  Madrid  but as it was not safe nor the Custom in  Spain  to visit those in my present Circumstances they hoped I would not take it amiss since they were bent to act all in their Power towards my Deli∣verance concluding however with their Advice that I would not give one  Real of Plata  to the  Corrigidor  whom they hated but confide in their assiduous Interposal Don  Pedro de Ortega  in particular the Person that perform'd the Part of the  Tau∣riro  on Horseback sometime before sent me Word he would not fail to write to a Relation of his of the first Account in  Ma∣drid  and so represent the Affair that I should not long be debarr'd my old Ac∣quaintance  IT may administer perhaps Matter of Wonder that  Spaniards  Gentlemen of the stanchest Punctilio should make a Scruple and excuse themselves from visiting Persons under Confinement when according to all Christian Acceptation such a Circumstance would render such a Visit not charitable on∣ly but generous But though Men of vul∣gar Spirits might from the Narrowness of their Views form such insipid Excuses those of these Gentlemen I very well knew proceeded from much more excusable To∣picks I was committed under the Accusa∣tion of having abus'd a sacred Person one of the Clergy and though as a Prisoner of War I might deem my self exempt from the Power of the Inquisition yet how far one of that Country visiting a Person so accused might be esteemed culpable was a consideration in that dangerous Climate far from deserving to be slighted To me there∣fore who well knew the Customs of the Country and the Temper of its Country∣men their Excuses were not only allowable but acceptable also for without calling in Question their Charity I verily believ'd I might safely confide in their Honour  ACCORDINGLY after I had been a close Prisoner one Month to a Day I found the Benefit of these Gentlemens Promises and Solicitations Pursuant to which an Or∣der was brought for my immediate Dis∣charge  notwithstanding the new Convert my old Landlady did all she could to make her appearing against me effectual to the Height of her Prejudice and Malice even while the Daughter as sensible of my In∣nocence and acting with a much better Con∣science endeavoured as much to justify me against both the Threats and Persuasions of the  Corrigidor  and his few Accomplices though her own Mother made one  After Receipt of this Order for my En∣largement I was mightily press'd by Don  Felix  and others of my Friends to go to  Madrid  and enter my Complaint against the  Corrigidor  and the  Clerico  as a Thing highly essential to my own future Security Without asking Leave therefore of the  Cor∣rigidor  or in the least acquainting him with it I set out from  la Mancha  and as I after∣wards understood to the terrible Alarm of that griping Officer who was under the greatest Consternation when he heard I was gone for as he knew very well that he had done more than he could justify he was very apprehensive of any Complaint well knowing that as he was hated as much as I was beloved he might assure himself of the Want of that Assistance from the Gen∣tlemen which I had experienced  SO soon as I arrived at  Madrid  I made it my Business to enquire out and wait up∣on Father  Fahy  Chief of the  Irish College  He received me very courteously but when I acquainted him with the Treatment I had met with from  Brennan  and had given him an Account of his other scandalous Behavi∣our I found he was no Stranger to the Man or his Character for he soon confirm'd to me the Honour  Brennan  first boasted of his considerable Family by saying that scarce an Assize passed in his own Country with∣out two or three of that Name receiving at the Gallows the just Reward of their De∣merits In short not only Father  Fahy  but all the Clergy of that Nation at  Madrid  readily subscribed to this Character of him  That he was a Scandal to their Country  AFTER this I had nothing more to do but to get that Father to go with me to  Pe∣dro de Dios  who was the Head of the  Do∣minican  Cloyster and Dean of the Inquisi∣tion He readily granted my Request and when we came there in a Manner unexpect∣ed represented to the Dean that having some good Dispositions towards MotherChurch I had been diverted from them he feared by the evil Practices of one  Mur∣tough Brennan  a Countryman of his tho' a Scandal to his Country that under a Pre∣tence of seeking my Conversion he had lay'd himself open in a most beastly Manner such as would have set a Catholick into a vile Opinion of their Religion and much more  one that was yet a Heretick The Dean had hardly Patience to hear Particulars but as soon as my Friend had ended his Nar∣ration he immediately gave his Orders pro∣hibiting  Murtough  's saying any more Masses either in  Madrid  or any other Place in  Spain  This indeed was taking away the poor Wretches sole Subsistence and put∣ting him just upon an Equality with his De∣merits  I took the same Opportunity to make my Complaints of the  Corrigidor  but his Term expiring very soon and a Process being likely to be chargeable I was advised to let it drop So having effected what I came for I returned to my old Station at  la Man∣cha  WHEN I came back I found a new  Cor∣rigidor  as I had been told there would by the Dean of the Inquisition who at the same Time advised me to wait on him I did so soon after my Arrival and then ex∣perienced the Advice to be well intended the Dean having wrote a Letter to him to order him to treat me with all Manner of Civility He show'd me the very Letter and it was in such particular and obliging Terms that I could not but perceive he had taken a Resolution if possible to eradicate all the evil Impressions that  Murtough  's Be∣haviour might have given too great Oc∣casion for This serv'd to confirm me in an  Observation that I had long before made That a Protestant who will prudently keep his Sentiments in his own Breast may command any Thing in  Spain  where their stiff Bigotry leads 'em naturally into that o∣ther Mistake That not to oppose is to assent Besides it is generally among them almost a work of Supererogation to be even instru∣mental in the Conversion of one they call a Heretick To bring any such back to what they call Mother Church nothing shall be spar'd nothing thought too much And if you have Insincerity enough to give them Hopes you shall not only live in Ease but in Pleasure and Plenty  I had entertain'd some thoughts on my Journey back of taking up my old Quar∣ters at the Widow's but found her so intirely converted by her  Clerico  that there wou'd be no room to expect Peace For which Reason with the help of my fair  Vicinos  and  Don Felix  I took another where I had not been long before I receiv∣ed an unhappy Account of  Murtough's  Con∣duct in  Murcia  It seems he had kept his Resolution in going thither where meeting with some of his own Countrymen though he found 'em stanch good Catholicks he so far inveigled himself into 'em that he brought them all into a foul chance for their Lives There were three of 'em all Soldiers in a  Spanish  Regiment but in a  fit of ambitious though frantick Zeal  Murtough  had wheedled them to go along with him to  Pedro de Dios  Dean of the Inquisition to declare and acknowledge be∣fore him that they were converted and brought over to Mother Church and by him only The poor Ignorants thus intic'd had left their Regiment of which the Colo∣nel having notice sent after them and they were overtaken on the Road their  Missionair  with them But notwithstanding all his Oratory nay even the Discovery of the whole Farce one of them was hang'd for an Example to the other two  IT was not long after my Return before News arriv'd of the Peace which though they receiv'd with Joy they could hardly entertain with Belief Upon which the new  Corrigidor  with whom I held a better Correspondence than I had done with the old one desired me to produce my Letters from  England  that it was true Never did People give greater Demonstrations of Joy than they upon this Occasion It was the common cry in the Streets  Paz con Angle∣terra con todo Mundo Guerra  And my Confirmation did them as much Pleasure as it did Service to me for if possible they treated me with more Civility than before  BUT the Peace soon after being pro∣claimed I received Orders to repair to  Madrid  where the rest of the Prisoners  taken at  Denia  had been carried when I by reason of my Wounds and want of Health had been left behind Others I understood lay ready and some were on their March to  Bayone  in  France  where Ships were or∣dered for their Transportation into  England  So after a Residence of three Years and three Months having taken leave of all my Acquaintance I left a Place that was almost become natural to me the delicious  Sainte Clemente de la Mancha  NOTHING of Moment or worth observ∣ing met I with till I came near  Ocanna  and there occurred a Sight ridiculous e∣nough The Knight of the Town I last came from the ever renown'd  Don Quixot  never made such a Figure as a  Spaniard  I there met on the Road He was mounted on a Mule of the largest size and yet no way unsizeable to his Person He had two Pistols in his Holsters and one on each side stuck in his Belt a sort of large Blunder∣buss in one of his Hands and the fellow to it slung over his Shoulders hung at his Back All these were accompany'd with a right  Spanish Spado  and an Attendant  Stiletto  in their customary Position The Muletier that was my Guide calling out to him in  Spanish  told him he was very well arm'd to which with a great deal of Gravity the Don returned Answer by Saint Jago  a Man cannot be too well arm'd in such dan∣gerous Times  I took up my Quarters that Night at  O∣canna  a large neat and well built Town Houses of good Reception and Entertain∣ment are very scarce all over  Spain  but that where I then lay might have pass'd for good in any other Country Yet it gave me a Notion quite different to what I found for I imagined it to proceed from my near Approach to the Capital But in∣stead of that contrary to all other Coun∣tries the nearer I came to  Madrid  the Houses of Entertainment grew worse and worse not in their Rates do I mean for that with Reason enough might have been expected but even in their Provision and Places and way of Reception I could not however forbear smiling at the Reason given by my Muletier that it proceeded from a piece of Court Policy in Order to oblige all Travellers to hasten to  Madrid  TWO small Leagues from  Ocanna  we ar∣rived at  Aranjuez  a Seat of Pleasure which the Kings of  Spain  commonly select for their place of Residence during the Months of  April  and  May  It is distant from  Madrid  about seven Leagues and the Country round is the pleasantest in all  Spain Valencia  excepted The House it self makes but a very indifferent Appearance I have seen many a better in  England  with an Owner to it of no more than five hundred Pounds  per Annum  yet the Gardens are  large and fine or as the  Spaniards  say the finest in all  Spain  which with them is all the World They tell you at the same Time that those of  Versailles  in their most beautiful Parts took their Model from these I never saw those at  Versailles  But in my Opinion the Walks at  Aranjuez  tho' noble in their length lose much of their Beauty by their Narrowness  THE Waterworks here are a great Cu∣riosity to which the River  Tagus  running along close by does mightily contribute That River is let into the Gardens by a vast number of little Canals which with their pleasing  Maeanders  divert the Eye with in∣expressible Delight These pretty Wande∣rers by Pipes properly plac'd in them af∣ford Varieties scarce to be believ'd or ima∣gin'd and which would be grateful in any Climate but much more where the Air as it does here wants in the Summer Months perpetual cooling  TO see a spreading Tree as growing in its natural Soil distinguish'd from its pine∣ing Neighbourhood by a gentle refreshing Shower which appears softly distilling from every Branch and Leaf thereof while Na∣ture all around is smiling without one li∣quid sign of Sorrow to me appear'd sur∣prizingly pleasing And the more when I observ'd that its Neighbours receiv'd not any the least Benefit of that plentiful Effu∣sion  And yet a very few Trees distant you should find a dozen together under the same healthful  Sudor  Where Art imitates Nature well Philosophers hold it a Perfec∣tion Then what must she exact of us where we find her transcendent in the Per∣fections of Nature  THE watry Arch is nothing less surpri∣zing where Art contending with Nature acts against the Laws of Nature and yet is beautiful To see a Liquid Stream vaulting it self for the space of threescore Yards in∣to a perfect SemiOrb will be granted by the Curious to be rare and strange But sure to walk beneath that Arch and see the Waters flowing over your Head without your receiving the minutest Drop is stran∣ger if not strange enough to stagger all Belief  THE Story of  Actaeon  pictur'd in Water Colours if I may so express my self tho' pretty seem'd to me but trifling to the o∣ther Those seem'd to be like Nature mi∣raculously displayed this only Fable in Grotesque The Figures indeed were not only fine but extraordinary yet their va∣rious Shapes were not at all so entertain∣ing to the Mind however refreshing they might be found to the Body  I took notice before of the straitness of their Walks But tho' to me it might seem a Diminution of their Beauty I am apt to  believe to the  Spaniard  for and by whom they were laid out it may seem otherwise They of both Sexes give themselves so in∣tolerably up to Amouring that on that Ac∣count the Closeness of the Walks may be look'd upon as an Advantage rather than a Defect The grand Avenue to the House is much more stately and compos'd as they are of Rows of Trees somewhat larger than our largest Limes whose Leaves are all of a perfect Pea bloom Colour together with their Grandeur they strike the Eye with a pleasing Beauty At the Entrance of the Grand Court we see the Statue of  Philip  the Second to intimate to the Spectators I suppose that he was the Founder  AMONG other Parks about  Aranjuez  there is one intirely preserved for Drome∣daries an useful Creature for Fatigue Bur∣den and Dispatch but the nearest of kin to Deformity of any I ever saw There are several other enclosures for several sorts of strange and wild Beasts which are some∣times baited in a very large Pond that was shown me about half a League from hence This is no ordinary Diversion But when the Court is disposed that way the Beast or Beasts whether Bear Lyon or Tyger are convey'd into a House prepar'd for that pur∣pose whence he can no other way issue than by a Door over the Water through or over which forcing or flinging himself  he gradually finds himself descend into the very depth of the Pond by a wooden De∣clivity The Dogs stand ready on the Banks and so soon as ever they spye their Enemy rush all at once into the Water and engage him A Diversion less to be com∣plain'd of than their  Tauridores  because attended with less Cruelty to the Beast as well as Danger to the Spectators  WHEN we arrived at  Madrid  a Town much spoken of by Natives as well as Strangers tho' I had seen it before I could hardly restrain my self from being surpri∣zed to find it only environ'd with Mud Walls It may very easily be imagin'd they were never intended for Defence and yet it was a long time before I could find any other use or rather any use at all in 'em And yet I was at last con∣vinc'd of my Error by a sensible Increase of Expence Without the Gates to half a League without the Town you have Wine for two Pence the Quart but within the Place you drink it little cheaper than you may in  London  The Mud Walls therefore well enough answer their Intent of forcing People to reside there under pretence of Security but in reality to be tax'd for other Things are taxable as well as Wine tho' not in like Proportion  All Embassadors have a Claim or Privi∣lege of bringing in what Wine they please  Taxfree and the King to wave it will at any Time purchase that Exemption of Duty at the price of five hundred Pistoles  per Annum  The Convents and Nunneries are allowed a like Licence of free Importation and it is one of the first Advantages they can boast of for under that Licence having a liberty of setting up a Tavern near them they make a prodigious Advantage of it The Wine drank and sold in this Place is for the most part a sort of white Wine  BUT if the Mud Walls gave me at first but a faint Idea of the Place I was pleasing∣ly disappointed as soon as I enter'd the Gates The Town then show'd itself well built and of Brick and the Streets wide long and spacious Those of  Atocha  and  Alcala  are as fine as any I ever saw yet is it situated but very indifferently For tho' they have what they call a River to which they give the very fair Name of  la Mansuera  and over which they have built a curious long and large Stone Bridge yet is the Course of it in Summer time especi∣ally mostly dry This gave occasion to that piece of Railery of a Foreign Embassa∣dor  That the King would have done wise∣ly to have bought a River before he built the Bridge  Nevertheless that little Stream of a River which they boast of they improve as much as possible since down the Sides as far as you can see there are  Coops or little Places hooped in for Peo∣ple to wash their Linen for they very rarely wash in their own Houses nor is it really any unpleasing Sight to view the re∣gular Rows of them at that cleanly Opera∣tion  THE King has here two Palaces one within the Town the other near adjoining That in the Town is built of Stone the o∣ther which is called  Bueno Retiro  is all of Brick From the Town to this last in Summer time there is a large covering of Canvas propt up with tall Poles under which People walk to avoid the scorching heats of the Sun  AS I was passing by the Chapel of the  Carmelites  I saw several blind Men some led some groping the Way with their Sticks going into the Chapel I had the curiosity to know the Reason I no sooner enter'd the Door but was surprized to see such a number of those unfortunate People all kneeling before the Altar some kissing the Ground others holding up their Heads crying out  Misericordia  I was informed 'twas Saint  Lucy  's Day the Patroness of the Blind therefore all who were able came upon that Day to pay their Devotion So I left them and directed my Course to∣wards the King's Palace  WHEN I came to the outward Court I met with a  Spanish  Gentleman of my Ac∣quaintance  and we went into the  Piazza's  whilst we were talking there I saw several Gentlemen passing by having Badges on their Breasts some white some red and others green  The Orders of Knight∣hood in  Spain  My Friend informed me that there were five Orders of Knighthood in  Spain  That of the Golden Fleece was on∣ly given to great Princes but the other four to private Gentlemen  viz  That of  Saint Jago Alacantara Saint Salvador de Mont∣real  and  Monteza  HE likewise told me that there were a∣bove ninety Places of Grandees but never filled up who have the Privilege of being cover'd in the Presence of the King and are distinguished into three Ranks The first is of those who cover themselves before they speak to the King The second are those who put on their Hats after they have begun to speak The third are those who only put on their Hats having spoke to him The Ladies of the Grandees have also great Respect show'd them The Queen rises up when they enter the Cham∣ber and offers them Cushions  NO married Man except the King lies in the Palace for all the Women who live there are Widows or Maids of Honour to the Queen I saw the Prince of  Asturia  's Dinner carried through the Court up to him being guarded by four Gentlemen of the Guards one before another behind  and one on each Side with their Carbines shoulder'd the Queen's came next and the King's the last guarded as before for they always dine separately I observed that the Gentlemen of the Guards though not on Duty yet they are obliged to wear their Carbine Belts  SAINT Isodore  who from a poor la∣bouring Man by his Sanctity of Life ar∣rived to the Title of  Saint  is the Pa∣tron of  Madrid  and has a Church dedi∣cated to him which is richly adorned with∣in The Sovereign Court of the Inquisiti∣on is held at  Madrid  the President where∣of is called the Inquisitor General They judge without allowing any Appeal for four Sorts of Crimes  viz  Heresy Polygamy Sodomy and Witchcraft and when any are convicted 'tis called the Act of Faith  MOST People believe that the King's great∣est Revenue consists in the Gold and Silver brought from the West Indies which is a mistake for most Part of that Wealth be∣longs to Merchants and others that pay the Workmen at the Golden Mines of  Po∣tosi  and the Silver Mines at  Mexico  yet the King as I have been informed receives about a Million and a half of Gold  THE  Spaniards  have a Saying that the finest Garden of Fruit in  Spain  is in the mid∣dle of  Madrid  which is the  Plaza  or Market Place and truly the Stalls there  are set forth with such variety of delicious Fruit that I must confess I never saw any Place comparable to it and which adds to my Admiration there are no Gardens or Orchards of Fruit within some Leagues  THEY seldom eat Hares in  Spain  but whilst the Grapes are growing and then they are so exceeding fat they are knocked down with Sticks Their Rabits are not so good as ours in  England  they have great plenty of Patridges which are larger and finer feather'd than ours They have but little Beef in  Spain  because there is no Grass but they have plenty of Mutton and exceeding good because their Sheep feed only upon wild Potherbs their Pork is de∣licious their Hogs seeding only upon Chest∣nuts and Acorns  MADRID  and  Valladolid  though Great yet are only accounted Villages In the latter  Philip  the Second by the per∣suasion of  Parsons  an  English  Jesuit erect∣ed an  English  Seminary and  Philip  the Fourth built a most noble Palace with ex∣traordinary fine Gardens They say that  Christopher Columbus  who first discover'd the West Indies dyed there tho' I have heard he lies buried and has a Monument at  Sevil  The King's Palace  THE Palace in the Town stands upon eleven Arches under every one of which there are Shops which degrade it to a  meer Exchange Nevertheless the Stairs by which you ascend up to the Guard Room which is very spacious too are stately large and curious So soon as you have pass'd the Guard Room you enter into a long and noble Gallery the right Hand whereof leads to the King's Apartment the left to the Queen's Entring into the King's Apartment you soon arrive at a large Room where he keeps his  Levee  on one side whereof for it takes up the whole Side is painted the fatal Battle of  Almanza  I confess the View somewhat affected me tho' so long after and brought to Mind many old Passages However the Re∣flection concluded thus in favour of the  Spa∣niard  that we ought to excuse their Va∣nity in so exposing under a  French  General a Victory which was the only material one the  Spaniards  could ever boast of over an  English  Army  IN this State Room when the King first appears every Person present receives him with a profound Homage After which turn∣ing from the Company to a large Velvet Chair by which stands the Father Confes∣sor he kneels down and remains some Time at his Devotion which being over he rising crosies himself and his Father Confessor having with the motion of his Hand intimated his Benediction he then gives Audience to all that attend for that  purpose He receives every Body with a seeming Complaisance and with an Air more resembling the  French  than the  Spanish  Ceremony Petitions to the King as with us are delivered into the Hands of the Secre∣tary of State Yet in one Particular they are in my Opinion worthy the Imitation of other Courts the Petitioner is directly told what Day he must come for an An∣swer to the Office at which Time he is sure without any further fruitless Atten∣dance not to fail of it The Audience be∣ing over the King returns through the Gallery to his own Apartment  I cannot here omit an accidental Con∣versation that pass'd between General  Ma∣honi  and my self in this Place After some talk of the Bravery of the  English  Nation he made mention of General  Stanhope  with a very peculiar  Emphasis  "But says he I never was so put to the Nonplus in all my Days as that General once put me in I was on the Road from  Paris  to  Madrid  and having notice that that General was going just the Reverse and that in all likelyhood we should meet the next Day Before my setting out in the Morning I took care to order my gay∣est Regimental Apparel resolving to make the best Appearance I could to re∣ceive so great a Man I had not tr  d above four Hours before I saw t  ¦tlemen  who appearing to be  English  it induc'd me to imagine they were Fore∣runners and some of his Retinue But how abash'd and confounded was I when putting the Question to one of 'em he made answer  Sir I am the Person  Never did Moderation put Vanity more out of Countenance Tho' to say Truth I cou'd not but think his Dress as much too plain for General  Stanhope  as I at that juncture thought my own too gay for  Mahoni  But added he that great Man had too many inward great Endow∣ments to stand in need of any outside Decoration"  OF all Diversions the King takes most delight in that of Shooting which he per∣forms with great Exactness and Dexterity I have seen him divert himself at Swallow shooting by all I think allow'd to be the most difficult and exceeding all I ever saw The last time I had the Honour to see him was on his Return from that Exercise He had been abroad with the Duke of  Medina Sidenia  and alighted out of his Coach at a back Door of the Palace with three or four Birds in his Hand which according to his usual Custom he carried up to the Queen with his own Hands  There are two Playhouses in  Madrid  at both which they act every Day but their Actors and their Musick are almost too in∣different  to be mentioned The Theatre at the  Bueno Retiro  is much the best but as much inferior to ours at  London  as those at  Madrid  are to that I was at one Play when both King and Queen were present There was a splendid Audience and a great Concourse of Ladies but the latter as is the Custom there having Lattices before them the Ap∣pearance lost most of its Lustre One very remarkable Thing happen'd while I was there the  AveBell  rung in the Middle of an Act when down on their Knees fell e∣very Body even the Players on the Stage in the Middle of their Harangue They re∣mained for some Time at their Devotion then up they rose and returned to the Busi∣ness they were before engag'd in beginning where they left off  THE Ladies of Quality make their Visits in grand State and Decorum The Lady Visitant is carry'd in a Chair by four Men the two first in all Weathers always bare Two others walk as a Guard one on each Side another carrying a large Lanthorn for fear of being benighted then follows a Coach drawn by six Mules with her Wo∣men and after that another with her Gen∣tlemen several Servants walking after more or less according to the Quality of the Person They never suffer their Servants to overload a Coach as is frequently seen with us neither do Coachmen or Chairmen  go or drive as if they carried Midwives in lieu of Ladies On the contrary they affect a Motion so slow and so stately that you would rather imagine the Ladies were every one of them near their Time and very ap∣prehensive of a Miscarriage  I remember not to have seen here any Horses in any Coach but in the King's or an Embassador's which can only proceed from Custom for certainly finer Horses are not to be found in the World  AT the Time of my being here Cardi∣nal  Giudici  was at  Madrid  he was a tall proper comely Man and one that made the best Appearance  Alberoni  was there at the same Time who upon the Death of the Duke of  Vendosme  had the good Fortune to find the Princess  Ursini  his Patroness An Instance of whose Ingratitude will plead Pardon for this little Digression That Princess first brought  Alberoni  into Favour at Court They were both of  Italy  and that might be one Reason of that Lady's e∣spousing his Interest tho' some there are that assign it to the Recommendation of the Duke of  Vendosme  with whom  Alberoni  had the Honour to be very intimate as the other was always distinguish'd by that Prin∣cess Be which it will certain it is she was  Alberoni  's first and sole Patroness which gave many People afterwards a very smart Occasion of reflecting upon him both  as to his Integrity and Gratitude For when  Alberoni  upon the Death of King  Philip  's first Queen had recommended this present Lady who was his Countrywoman she of  Parma  and he of  Placentia  both in the same Dukedom and had forwarded her Match with the King with all possible Assi∣duity and when that Princess pursuant to the Orders she had received from the King pass'd over into  Italy  to accompany the Queen Elect into her own Dominions  Al∣beroni  forgetful of the Hand that first ad∣vanced him sent a Letter to the present Queen just before her Landing that if she resolv'd to be Queen of  Spain  she must ba∣nish the Princess  Ursini  her Companion and never let her come to Court Accord∣ingly that Lady to evince the Extent of her Power and the Strength of her Resolution dispatch'd that Princess away on her very Landing and before she had seen the King under a Detachment of her own Guards in∣to  France  and all this without either al∣lowing her an Opportunity of justifying her self or assigning the least Reason for so un∣common an Action But the same  Albero∣ni  though afterwards created Cardinal and for some Time King  Philip  's Prime Mi∣nion soon saw that Ingratit  de of his re∣warded in his own Dis  race at the very same Court  I remember when at  la Mancha  Do  Felix Pachero  in a Conversation there  maintain'd that three Women at tha  Time rul'd the World  viz  Queen  Anne  Madam  Mantenon  and this Princess  Ursini  FATHER  Fahy's  Civilities when last a  Madrid  exacting of me some suitable Ac¦knowledgment I went to pay him a Visit  as to render him due Thanks for the past s  to give him a further Account of his Coun∣tryman  Brennan  but I soon found he di  not much incline to hear any Thing more o  Murtough  not expecting to hear any Goo  of him for which Reason as soon as I wel  could I changed the Conversation to ano∣ther Topick In which some Word drop∣ping of the Count  de Montery  I told him that I heard he had taken Orders and offi∣ciated at Mass He made answer it was al  very true And upon my intimating tha  I had the Honour to serve under him in  Flan∣ders  on my first entring into Service an  when he commanded the  Spanish  Forces a  the famous Battle of  Seneff  and adding  that I could not but be surprized that he  who was then one of the brightest  Cavalieroes  of the Age should now be in Orders and that I should look upon it as a mighty Fa∣vour barely to have if it might be a View of him he very obligingly told me that he was very well acquainted with him and that  f I would come the next Day he would  not fail to accompany me to the Count's House  PUNCTUALLY at the Time appointed I waited on Father  Fahy  who as he promi∣sed carry'd me to the Count's House He was stepping into his Coach just as we got there but seeing Father  Fahy  he advan∣ced towards us The Father deliver'd my Desire in as handsom a Manner as could be and concluding with the Reason of it from my having been in that Service under him he seem'd very well pleas'd but added that there were not many beside my self living who had been in that Service with him After some other Conversation he call'd his Gentleman to him and gave him parti∣cular Orders to give us a  Frescari  or in  English  an Entertainment so taking leave he went into his Coach and we to our  Fres∣cari  COMING from which Father  Fahi  made me observe in the open Street a Stone on which was a visible great Stain of somewhat reddish and like Blood  "This said he was occasion'd by the Death of a Coun∣tryman of mine who had the Misfortune to overset a Child coming out of that House pointing to one opposite to us the Child frighted though not hurt as is natural made a terrible Outcry upon which its Father coming out in a violent Rage notwithstanding my Countryman  beg'd Pardon and pleaded Sorrow as being only an Accident stabb'd him to the Heart and down he fell upon that Stone which to this Day retains the Mark of innocent Blood so rashly shed"  He went on and told me the  Spaniard  imme∣diately took Sanctuary in the Church whence some Time after he made his Escape But Escapes of that Nature are so common in  Spain  that they are not worth wondering at For even though it were for wilful and premeditated Murder if the Murderer have taken Sanctuary it was never known that he was delivered up to Justice though de∣manded but in some Disguise he makes his Escape or some Way is secured against all the Clamours of Power or Equity I have observed that some of the greatest Quality stop their Coaches over a stinking nasty Puddle which they often find in the Streets and holding their Heads over the Door snuff up the nasty Scent which ascends be∣lieving that 'tis extream healthful when I was forced to hold my Nose passing by 'Tis not convenient to walk out early in the Morning they having no necessary Houses throw out their Nastiness in the Middle of the Street  AFTER I had taken Leave of Father  Fa∣hy  and return'd my Thanks for all Civili∣ties I went to pay a Visit to Mr  Salter  who was Secretary to General  Stanhope  when  the  English  Forces were made Prisoners of War at  Breuhiga  going up Stairs I found the Door of his Lodgings ajar and knock∣ing a Person came to the Door who ap∣peared under some Surprize at Sight of me I did not know him but enquiring if Mr  Salter  was within He answered as I fan∣cy'd with some Hesitation that he was but was busy in an inner Room How∣ever though unask'd I went in resolving since I had found him at home to wait his Leisure In a little Time Mr  Salter  enter'd the Room and after customary Ceremonies asking my Patience a little longer he desi∣red I would sit down and bear Ensign  Fan∣shaw  Company for so he call'd him ad∣ding at going out he had a little Busi∣ness that required Dispatch which be∣ing over he would return and join Com∣pany  THE Ensign as he call'd him appear'd to me under a  Dishabileè  and the first Que∣stion he ask'd me was if I would drink a Glass of  English  Beer Misled by his Ap∣pearance though I assented it was with a Design to treat which he would by no Means permit but calling to a Servant or∣dered some in We sat drinking that Liquor which to me was a greater Rarity than all the Wine in  Spain  when in dropt an old Ac∣quaintance of mine Mr  Le N  y  Secretary to Colonel  Nevil  He sat down with us and be∣fore  the Glass could go twice round told Ensign  Fanshaw  That his Colonel gave his humble Service to him and ordered him to let him know that he had but threescore Pistoles by him which he had sent and which were at his Service as what he pleas'd more should be as soon as it came to his Hands  AT this I began to look upon my Ensign as another guess Person than I had taken him for and  Le Noy  imagining by our setting cheek by joul together that I must be in the Secret soon after gave him the Title of Captain This soon convinc'd me that there was more in the Matter than I was yet Master of for laying Things toge∣ther I could not but argue within my self that as it seem'd at first a most incredible Thing that a Person of his Appearance should have so large Credit with such a Complement at the End of it without some Disguise and as from an Ensign he was risen to be a Captain in the taking of one Bottle of  English  Beer a little Patience would let me into a Farce in which at pre∣sent I had not the Honour to bear any Part but that of a Mute  AT last  Le Noy  took his leave and as soon as he had left us and the other Bottle was brought in Ensign  Fanshaw  began to open his Heart and tell me who he was I am necessitated said he to be under this Dis∣guise  to conceal my self especially in this Place  "For you must know conti∣nued he that when our Forces were Lords of this Town as we were for a little while I fell under an Intrigue with another Man's Wife Her Husband was a Person of considerable Account ne∣vertheless the Wife show'd me all the Fa∣vours that a Soldier under a long and hard Campaigne could be imagined to ask In short her Relations got ac∣quainted with our Amour and knowing that I was among the Prisoners taken at  Breuhiga  are now upon the Scout and Enquiry to make a Discovery that may be of fatal Consequence This is the Reason of my Disguise this the unfortu∣nate Occasion of my taking upon me a Name that does not belong to me"  HE spoke all this with such an Open∣ness of Heart that in return of so much Confidence I confess'd to him that I had heard of the Affair for that it had made no little Noise all over the Country that it highly behoved him to take great Care of himself since as the Relations on both Sides were considerable he must consequently be in great Danger That in Cases of that Nature no People in the World carry Things to greater Extremities than the  Spaniards  He return'd me Thanks for my good Advice which I understood in a few  Days after he with the Assistance of his Friends had taken Care to put in Practice for he was convey'd away secretly and af∣terwards had the Honour to be made a Peer of  Ireland  MY Passport being at last sign'd by the Count  de las Torres  I prepared for a Jour∣ney I had long and ardently wish'd for and set out from  Madrid  in the Beginning of  September  in Order to return to my native Country  ACCORDINGLY I set forward upon my Journey but having heard both before and since my being in  Spain  very famous Things spoken of the  Escurial  though it was a League out of my Road I resolved to make it a Visit And I must confess when I came there I was so far from condemning my Curiosity that I chose to congratulate my good Fortune that had at half a Day's Ex∣pence feasted my Eyes with Extraordina∣ries which would have justify'd a Twelvemonths Journey on purpose  Description of the  Es∣curial  THE Structure is intirely magnificent be∣yond any Thing I ever saw or any Thing my Imagination could frame It is compo∣sed of eleven several Quadrangles with no∣ble Cloisters round every one of them The Front to the West is adorn'd with three stately Gates every one of a different Mo∣del yet every one the Model of nicest Ar∣chitecture The Middlemost of the three  leads into a fine Chapel of the  Hieronomites  as they call them in which are entertain'd one hundred and fifty Monks At every of the four Corners of this august Fabrick there is a Turret of excellent Workmanship which yields to the Whole an extraordina∣ry Air of Grandure The King's Palace is on the North nearest that Mountain whence the Stone it is built of was hew'n and all the South Part is set off with many Galle∣ries both beautiful and sumptuous  THIS prodigious Pile which as I have said exceeds all that I ever saw and which would ask of it self a Volume to particu∣larize was built by  Philip  the Second He lay'd the first Stone yet liv'd to see it finish∣ed and lies buryed in the  Panthaeon  a Part of it set apart for the Burialplace of suc∣ceeding Princes as well as himself It was dedicated to Saint  Laurence  in the very Foundation and therefore built in the Shape of a Gridiron the Instrument of that Martyr's Execution and in Memory of a great Victo∣ry obtain'd on that Saint's Day The Stone of which it is built contrary to the common Course grows whiter by Age and the Quarry whence it was dug lies near e∣nough if it had Sense or Ambition to grow enamour'd of its own wonderful Production Some there are who stick not to assign this Convenience as the main Cause of its Situa∣tion and for my Part I must agree that I  have seen many other Parts of  Spain  where that glorious Building would have shone with yet far greater Splendour  THERE was no Town of any Conse∣quence presented it self in my Way to  Bur∣gos  Here I took up my Quarters that Night where I met with an  Irish  Priest whose Name was  White  As is natural on such Rencounters having answered his En∣quiry whither I was going he very kind∣ly told me he should be very glad of my Company as far as  Victoria  which lay in my Road and I with equal Frankness em∣brac'd the Offer  NEXT Morning when we had mounted our Mules and were got a little Distance from  Burgos  he began to relate to me a great many impious Pranks of an  English  Officer who had been a Prisoner there a lit∣tle before I came concluding all with some Vehemence that he had given greater Oc∣casion of Scandal and Infamy to his native Country than would easily be wiped off or in a little Time The Truth of it is ma∣ny Particulars which he related to me were too monstrously vile to admit of any Repetition here and highly meriting that unfortunate End which that Officer met with some Time after Nevertheless the just Reflections made by that Father plainly ma∣nifested to me the Folly of those Gentlemen who by such Inadvertencies to say no  worse cause the Honour of the Land of their Nativity to be called in question For tho' no doubt it is a very false Conclusion from a singular to conceive a general Cha∣racter yet in a strange Country nothing is more common A Man therefore of com∣mon Sense would carefully avoid all Occa∣sions of Censure if not in respect to himself yet out of a human Regard to such of his Countrymen as may have the Fortune to come after him and it's more than proba∣ble may desire to hear a better and juster Character of their Country and Country∣men than he perhaps might incline to leave behind him  AS we travelled along Father  White  told me that near the Place of our Quartering that Night there was a Convent of the  Carthusian  Order which would be well worth my seeing I was doubly glad to hear it as it was an Order most a Stranger to me and as I had often heard from many others most unaccountable Relations of the Severity of their Way of Life and the very odd Original of their Instituti∣on  THE next Morning therefore being  Sun∣day  we took a Walk to the Convent It was situated at the Foot of a great Hill ha∣ving a pretty little River running before it The Hill was naturally cover'd with Ever∣greens of various Sorts but the very Sum∣mit  of the Rock was so impending that one would at first Sight be led to apprehend the Destruction of the Convent from the Fall of it Notwithstanding all which they have very curious and well ordered Gardens which led me to observe that what ever Men may pretend Pleasure was not incom∣patible with the most austere Life And in∣deed if I may guess of others by this no Or∣der in that Church can boast of finer Con∣vents Their Chapel was compleatly neat the Altar of it set out with the utmost Mag∣nificence both as to fine Paintings and o∣ther rich Adornments The Building was answerable to the rest and in short no∣thing seem'd omitted that might render it beautiful or pleasant  WHEN we had taken a full Survey of all we not without some Regret return'd to our very indifferent Inn Where the better to pass away the Time Father  White  gave me an ample Detail of the Original of that Order I had beforehand heard somewhat of it nevertheless I did not care to inter∣rupt him because I had a Mind to hear how his Account would agree with what I had al∣ready heard  "  Bruno  said the Father the Author or Founder of this Order was not originally of this but of another He had a holy Brother of the same Order that was his Cellmate or Chamberfellow who was  reputed by all that ever saw or knew him for a Person of exalted Piety and of a most exact holy Life This Man  Bru∣no  had intimately known for many Years and agreed in his Character that general Consent did him no more than Justice having never observed any Thing in any of his Actions that in his Opinion could be offensive to God or Man He was perpetually at his Devotions and distin∣guishably remarkable for never permit∣ing any Thing but pious Ejaculations to proceed out of his Mouth In short he was reputed a Saint upon Earth"  "THIS Man at last dies and according to Custom is removed into the Chapel of the Convent and there plac'd with a Cross fix'd in his Hands Soon after which saying the proper Masses for his Soul in the Middle of their Devotion the dead Man lifts up his Head and with an audi∣ble Voice cry'd out  Vocatus sum  The pious Brethren as any one will easi∣ly imagine were most prodigiously sur∣prized at such an Accident and there∣fore they earnestly redoubled their Pray∣ers when lifting up his Head a second Time the dead Man cried aloud  Judi∣catus sum  Knowing his former Piety the pious Fraternity could not then entertain the least doubt of his Felicity when to their great Consternation and Confusion  he lifted up his Head a third Time cry∣ing out in a terrible Tone  Damnatus sum  upon which they incontinently re∣moved the Corps out of the Chapel and threw it upon the Dunghill"  "Good  Bruno  pondering upon these Passages could not fail of drawing this Conclusion That if a Person to all Ap∣pearance so holy and devout should miss of Salvation it behov'd a wise Man to contrive some Way more certain to make his Calling and Election sure To that Purpose he instituted this strict and severe Order with an Injunction to them sacred as any Part that every Professor should always wear Hair Cloth next his Skin ne∣ver eat any Flesh nor speak to one ano∣ther only as passing by to say  Memento mori  "  THIS Account I found to agree pret∣ty well with what I had before heard but at the same Time I found the Redouble of it made but just the same Impression it had at first made upon my Heart How∣ever having made it my Observation that a Spirit the least contradictory best carries a Man through  Spain  I kept Father  White  Company and in Humour 'till we arrived at  Victoria  Where he added one Thing by Way of Appendix in Relation to the  Carthusians  That every Person of the So∣ciety is oblig'd every Day to go into their  Place of Burial and take up as much Earth as he can hold at a Grasp with one Hand in order to prepare his Grave  NEXT Day we set out for  Victoria  It is a sweet delicious and pleasant Town It received that Name in Memory of a consi∣derable Victory there obtained over the  Moors  Leaving this Place I parted with Father  White  he going where his Affairs led him and I to make the best of my Way to  Bilboa  Entring into  Biscay  soon after I left  Vi∣ctoria  I was at a Loss almost to imagine what Country I was got into By my long Stay in  Spain  I thought my self a tolera∣ble Master of the Tongue yet here I found my self at the utmost Loss to understand Landlord Landlady or any of the Family I was told by my Muletier that they pretend their Language as they call it has continu∣ed uncorrupted from the very Confusion of  Babel  though if I might freely give my O∣pinion in the Matter I should rather take it to be the very Corruption of all that Confu∣sion Another  Rhodomontado  they have for in this they are perfect  Spaniards  that neither  Romans Carthaginians Vandals Goths  or  Moors  ever totally subdued them And yet any Man that has ever seen their Country might cut this Knot without a Hatchet by saying truly that neither  Ro∣man Carthaginian  nor any victorious Peo∣ple  thought it worth while to make a Con∣quest of a Country so mountainous and so barren  Bilboa  de∣scribed  HOWEVER  Bilboa  must be allowed tho' not very large to be a pretty clean and neat Town Here as in  Amsterdam  they al∣low neither Cart nor Coach to enter but every Thing of Merchandize is drawn and carried upon Sledges And yet it is a Place of no small Account as to Trade and e∣specially for Iron and Wooll Here I hop'd to have met with an opportunity of Em∣barking for  England  but to my Sorrow I found my self disappointed and under that Disappointment obliged to make the best of my Way to  Bayonne  SETTING out for which Place the first Town of Note that I came to was  Saint Sebastian  A very clean Town and neatly pav'd which is no little Rarity in  Spain  It has a very good Wall about it and a pretty Citadel At this Place I met with two  English  Officers who were under the same state with my self one of them being a Prisoner of War with me at  Denia  They were going to  Bayonne  to embark for  England  as well as my self so we agreed to set out together for  Port Passage  The Road from St  Sebastian  is all over a well pav'd Stone Causeway almost at the end where∣of there accosted us a great number of young Lasses They were all prettily dress'd their  long Hair flowing in a decent manner over their Shoulders and here and there decora∣ted with Ribbons of various Colours which wantonly play'd on their Backs with the Wind The Sight surpriz'd my Fellow Tra∣vellers no less than me and the more as they advanced directly up to us and seiz'd our Hands But a little time undeceiv'd us and we found what they came for and that their Contest tho' not so robust as our Oars on the  Thames  was much of the same Nature each contending who should have us for their Fare For 'tis here a Custom of Time out of mind that none but young Women should have the management and profit of that Ferry And tho' the Ferry is over an Arm of the Sea very broad and sometimes very rough those fair Ferriers manage themselves with that Dexterity that the Passage is very little dangerous and in calm Weather very pleasant In short we made choice of those that best pleased us who in a grateful Return led us down to their Boat under a sort of Musick which they walking along made with their Oars and which we all thought far from being disagreeable Thus were we transported over to  Port Passage  not undeservedly accounted the best Har∣bour in all the Bay of  Biscay  WE stay'd not long here after Landing resolving if possible to reach  Fonterabia  before Night but all the Expedition we could use little avail'd for before we could reach thither the Gates were shut and good Nature and Humanity were so lock'd up with them that all the Rhetorick we were Masters of could not prevail upon the Governor to order their being opened for which Reason we were obliged to take up our Quarters at the Ferry House  When we got up the next Morning we found the Waters so broad as well as rough that we began to enquire after another Pas∣sage and were answer'd that at the Isle of  Conference  but a short League upwards the Passage was much shorter and exposed to less Danger Such good Reasons soon de∣termin'd us So setting out we got there in a very little Time and very soon after were landed in  France  Here we found a House of very good Entertainment a Thing we had long wanted and much lamented the want of  WE were hardly well seated in the House before we were made sensible that it was the Custom which had made it the business of our Host to entertain all his Guests at first coming in with a prolix Account of that remarkable Interview between the two Kings of  France  and  Spain  I speak safely now as being got on  French  Ground For the  Spaniard  in his own Country would have made me to know that putting  Spain  after  France  had there been look'd upon as a meer Solecism in Speech However ha∣ving refresh'd our selves to show our defe∣rence to our Host's Relation we agreed to pay our Respects to that famous little Isle he mention'd which indeed was the whole burden of the Design of our crafty Landlord's Relation  WHEN we came there we found it a little oval Island overrun with Weeds and surrounded with Reeds and Rushes  "Here said our Landlord for he went with us upon this little Spot were at that juncture seen the two greatest Mo∣narchs in the Universe A noble Pavi∣lion was erected in the very middle of it and in the middle of that was placed a very large oval Table at which was the Conference from which the Place re∣ceiv'd its Title There were two Bridges rais'd one on the  Spanish  side the Pas∣sage to which was a little upon a Descent by reason of the Hills adjacent and the other upon the  French  side which as you see was all upon a Level The Musick playing and Trumpets sounding the two Kings upon a Signal agreed upon set forward at the same time the  Spanish  Monarch handing the  Infanta  his Daugh∣ter to the Place of Interview As soon as they were enter'd the Pavilion on each Side all the Artillery fired and  both Armies after that made their seve∣ral Vollies Then the King of  Spain  advancing on his side the Table with the  Infanta  the King of  France  advan∣ced at the same Moment on the other till meeting he received the  Infanta  at the Hands of her Father as his Queen upon which both the Artillery and small Arms fir'd as before After this was a most splendid and sumptuous Entertain∣ment which being over both Kings re∣tir'd into their several Dominions the King of  France  conducting his new Queen to  Saint Jean de Luz  where the Mar∣riage was consummated and the King of  Spain  returning to  Port Passage  "  AFTER a Relation so very inconsistent with the present State of the Place we took Horse for Mulemounting was now out of Fashion and rode to  Saint Jean de Luz  where we found as great a difference in our Eating and Drinking as we had be∣fore done in our Riding Here they might be properly call'd Houses of Entertainment tho' generally speaking till we came to this Place we met with very mean Fare and were poorly accommodated in the Houses where we lodged  A Person that travels this way would be esteem'd a Man of a narrow Curiosity who should not desire to see the Chamber where  Louis le grand  took his first Nights  Lodging with his Queen Accordingly when it was put into my Head out of an Ambition to evince my self a Person of Taste I asked the Question and the Fa∣vour was granted me with a great deal of  French  Civility Not that I found any Thing here more than in the Isle of  Confe∣rence  but what Tradition only had render∣ed remarkable  S  Jean de Luz  Saint Jean de Luz  is esteem'd one of the greatest Village Towns in all  France  It was in the great Church of this Place that  Lewis  XIV according to Marriage Articles took before the high Altar the Oath of Re∣nunciation to the Crown of  Spain  by which all the Issue of that Marriage were debarred Inheritance if Oaths had been o∣bligatory with Princes The Natives here are reckon'd expert Seamen especially in Whale fishing Here is a fine Bridge of Wood in the middle of which is a De∣scent by Steps into a pretty little Island where is a Chapel and a Palace belonging to the Bishop of  Bayonne  Here the Queen Dowager of  Spain  often walks to divert herself and on this Bridge and in the Walks on the Island I had the Honour to see that Princess more than once  THIS  Villa  not being above four Leagues from  Bayonne  we got there by Dinner time where at an Ordinary of twenty  Sons  we eat and drank in Plenty and with a  gusto  much better than in any part of  Spain  where for eating much worse we paid very much more  Bayonne  BAYONNE  is a Town strong by Na∣ture yet the Fortifications have been very much neglected since the building of the Citadel on the other Side the River which not only commands the Town but the Harbour too It is a noble Fabrick fair and strong and rais'd on the side of a Hill wanting nothing that Art could fur∣nish to render it impregnable The Mar∣shal  Bouflers  had the Care of it in its erec∣tion and there is a fine Walk near it from which he us'd to survey the Workmen which still carries his Name There are two noble Bridges here tho' both of Wood one over that River which runs on one side the Town the other over that which di∣vides it in the middle the Tide runs thro' both with vast Rapidity notwithstanding which Ships of Burden come up and pay∣ing for it are often fasten'd to the Bridge while loading or unloading While I was here there came in four or five  English  Ships laden with Corn the first as they told me that had come in to unlade there since the beginning of the War  Pont d' Esprit  ON that Side of the River where the new Citadel is built at a very little distance lies  Pont d' Esprit  a Place mostly inhabit∣ed by  Jews  who drive a great Trade  there and are esteemed very rich tho' as in all other Countries mostly very rogueish Here the Queen Dowager of  Spain  has kept her Court ever since the Jealousy of the present King reclus'd her from  Madrid  As Aunt to his Competitor  Charles  now Em∣peror he apprehended her Intrigueing for which Reason giving her an Option of Retreat that Princess made choice of this City much to the Advantage of the Place and in all Appearance much to her own Sa∣tisfaction She is a Lady not of the lesser Size and lives here in suitable Splendour and not without the Respect due to a Per∣son of her high Quality Every time she goes to take the Air the Cannon of the Citadel saluting her as she passes over the Bridge and to say Truth the Country round is extremely pleasant and abounds in plenty of all Provisions especially in wild Fowl  Bayonne  Hams are to a Proverb celebrated all over  France  WE waited here near five Months before the expected Transports arrived from  Eng∣land  without any other Amusements than such as are common to People under Sus∣pence Short Tours will not admit of great Varieties and much Acquaintance could not be any way suitable to People that had long been in a strange Country and ear∣nestly desired to return to our own Yet one  Accident befell me here that was nearer costing me my Life than all I had before encounter'd either in Battle or Siege  GOING to my Lodgings one Evening I unfortunately met with an Officer who would needs have me along with him a∣board one of the  English  Ships to drink a Bottle of  English  beer He had been often invited he said and I am afraid our Coun∣tryman continued he will hold himself slighted if I delay it longer  English  Beer was a great rarity and the Vessel lay not at any great distance from my Lodgings so without any f  rther Persuasion I consented When we came upon the Bridge to which the Ship we were to go aboard was fastned we found as was customary as well as ne∣cessary a Plank laid over from the Ship and a Rope to hold by for safe Passage The Night was very dark and I had cau∣tiously enough taken care to provide a Man with a Lanthorn to prevent Casualties The Man with the Light went first and out of his abundant Complaisance my Friend the Officer would have me follow the Light But I was no sooner stept upon the Plank after my Guide but Rope and Plank gave way and Guide and I tumbled both together into the Water  THE Tide was then running in pretty strong However my Feet in the Fall  touching Ground gave me an opportunity to recover my self a little at which Time I catch'd fast hold of a Buoy which was plac'd over an Anchor on one of the Ships there riding I held fast till the Tide rising stronger and stronger threw me off my Feet which gave an Opportunity to the poor Fel∣low our Lanthornbearer to lay hold of one of my Legs by which he held as fast as I by the Buoy We had lain thus lov∣ingly at Hull together strugling with the increasing Tide which well for us did not break my hold for if it had the Ships which lay breast a breast had certainly suck∣ed us under when several on the Bridge who saw us fall brought others with Ropes and Lights to our Assistance and especi∣ally my Brother Officer who had been Accessary as well as Spectator of our Ca∣lamity tho' at last a very small Portion of our Deliverance fell to his share  AS soon as I could feel a Rope I quitted my hold of the Buoy but my poor Drag at my Heels would not on any account quit his hold of my Leg And as it was next to an Impossibility in that Posture to draw us up the Bridge to save both if either of us we must s  ll have perished had not the Alarm brought off a Boat or two to our Succour who took us in  I was carry'd as fast as possible to a neigh∣bouring House hard by where they took  immediate care to make a good Fire and where I had not been long before our in∣tended Host the Master of the Ship came in very much concern'd and blaming us for not hailing the Vessel before we made an Attempt to enter For says he the very Night before my Vessel was robb'd and that Plank and Rope were a Trap de∣sign'd for the Thieves if they came again not imagining that Men in an honest way would have come on board without asking Questions Like the wise Men of this World I hereupon began to form Resolu∣tions against a Thing which was never a∣gain likely to happen and to draw Infe∣rences of Instruction from an Accident that had not so much as a Moral for its Founda∣tion  ONE Day after this partly out of Bu∣siness and partly out of Curiosity I went to see the Mint here and having taken no∣tice to one of the Officers that there was a difference in the Impress of their Crown Pieces one having at the bottom the Im∣press of a Cow and the other none  "Sir reply'd that Officer you are much in the right in your Observation Those that have the Cow were not coin'd here but at  Paw  the chief City of  Navarr  where they enjoy the Privilege of a Mint as well as we And Tradition tells says he that the Reason of that  Addition to the Impress was this A certain King of  Navarr  when it was a Kingdom distinct from that of  France  looking out of a Window of the Palace spy'd a Cow with her Calf standing a∣side her attack'd by a Lyon which had got loose out of his Menagery The Lyon strove to get the young Calf into his Paw the Cow bravely defended her Charge and so well that the Lyon at last tir'd and weary withdrew and left her Mistress of the Field of Battle and her young one Ever since which concluded that Officer by Order of that King the Cow is plac'd at the bottom of the Impress of all the Money there coined"  WHETHER or no my Relator guess'd at the Moral or whether it was Fact I dare not determine But to me it seem'd appa∣rent that it was no otherways intended than as an emblematical Fable to cover and pre∣serve the Memory of the Deliverance of  Hen∣ry  the Fourth then the young King of  Na∣varr  at that eternally ignominious Slaugh∣ter the Massacre of  Paris  Many Histori∣ans their own as well as others agree that the House of  Guise  had levell'd the Malice of their Design at that great Prince They knew him to be the lawful Heir but as they knew him bred what they call'd a  Hugonot  Barbarity and Injustice was easily conceal'd under the Cloak of Religion and the Good of Mother Church under the veil of Ambition was held sufficient to postpone the Laws of God and Man Some of those Historians have deliver'd it as Matter of Fact that the Conspirators in searching af∣ter that young King press'd into the very A∣partments of the Queen his Mother who having at the Toll of the Bell and Cries of the Murder'd taken the Alarm on hear∣ing 'em coming plac'd her self in her Chair and cover'd the young King her Son with her Farthingale till they were gone By which means she found an oppor∣tunity to convey him to a Place of more Safety and so preserv'd him from those bloody Murderers and in them from the Paw of the Lyon This was only a private Reflection of my own at that Time but I think carries so great a Face of Probability that I can see no present Reason to reject it And to have sought after better Information from the Officer of the Mint had been to sacrifice my Discretion to my Curiosity  WHILE I stay'd at  Bay  nne  the Princess  Ursini  came thither attended by some of the King of  Spain's  Guards She had been to drink the Waters of some famous Spaw in the Neighbourhood the Name of which has now  pt my Memory She was most  splendidly entertain'd by the Queen Dow∣ager of  Spain  and the Mareschal  de Mon∣trevel  no less signaliz'd himself in his Re∣ception of that great Lady who was at that Instant the greatest Favourite in the  Spanish  Court tho' as I have before related she was some Time after basely under∣mined by a Creature of her own advanc∣ing  BAYONNE  is esteem'd the third  Em∣porium  of Trade in all  France  It was once and remain'd long so in the Possessi∣on of the  English  of which had History been silent the Cathedral Church had afforded evident Demonstration being in every respect of the  English  Model and quite different to any of their own way of Building in  France  Pampelo∣na  PAMPELONA  is the Capital City of the  Spanish Navarr  supposed to have been built by  Pompey  'Tis situated in a pleasant Valley surrounded by lofty Hills This Town whether famous or infamous was the Cause of the first Institution of the Order of the Jesuits For at the Siege of this Place  Ignatius Loyola  being only a private Soldier receiv'd a shot on his Thigh which made him uncapable of following that Profession any longer up∣on which he set his Brains to work being a subtle Man and invented the Order of  the Jesuits which has been so troublesome to the World ever since  AT  Saint Stephen  near  Lerida  an Acti∣on happened between the  English  and  Spa∣niards  in which Major General  Cunning∣ham  bravely fighting at the Head of his Men lost his Life being extreamly much lamented He was a Gentleman of a great Estate yet left it to serve his Country  Dulce est pro Patria Mori  ABOUT two Leagues from  Victoria  there is a very pleasant Hermitage plac'd upon a small rising Ground a murmuring Rivulet running at the bottom and a pretty neat Chapel standing near it in which I saw  Saint Christopher  in a Gigantick Shape ha∣ving a  Christo  on his Shoulders The Her∣mit was there at his Devotion I ask'd him tho' I knew it before the reason why he was represented in so large a Shape The Hermit answered with great Civility and told me he had his Name from  Christo Fe∣rendo  for when our Saviour was young he had an inclination to pass a River so  Saint Christopher  took him on his Shoulders in order to carry him over and as the Water grew deeper and deeper so he grew higher and higher  AT last we received News that the  Gloucester  Man of War with two Tran∣sports was arrived at  Port Passage  in or∣der for the Transporting of all the remain∣ing  Prisoners of War into  England  Ac∣cordingly they march'd next Day and there embark'd But I having before a∣greed with a Master of a Vessel which was loaded with Wine for  Amsterdam  to set me ashoar at  Dover  stay'd behind waiting for that Ship as did that for a fair Wind  IN three or four Days Time a fine and fair Gale presented of which the Master ta∣king due Advantage we sail'd over the Bar into the Bay of  Biscay  This is with Sai∣lors to a Proverb reckon'd the roughest of Seas and yet on our Entrance into it no∣thing appear'd like it 'Twas smooth as Glass a Lady's Face might pass for young and in its Bloom that discover'd no more Wrinckles Yet scarce had we sail'd three Leagues before a prodigious Fish presented it self to our View As near as we could guess it might be twenty Yards in Length and it lay sporting it self on the Surface of the Sea a great Part appearing out of the Water The Sailors one and all as soon as they saw it declar'd it the certain Fore∣runner of a Storm However our Ship kept on its Course before a fine Gale till we had near passed over half the Bay when all on a sudden there was such a hideous Alteration as makes Nature re∣coil on the very Reflection Those Seas that seem'd before to smile upon us with the Aspect of a Friend now in a Moment  chang'd their flattering Countenance into that of an open Enemy and Frowns the certain Indexes of Wrath presented us with apparent Danger of which little on this Side Death could be the Sequel The an∣gry Waves cast themselves up into Mountains and scourg'd the Ship on every Side from Poop to Prow Such Shocks from the con∣tending Wind and Surges Such Falls from Precipices of Water to dismal Caverns of the same uncertain Element Although the lat∣ter seem'd to receive us in Order to skreen us from the Riot of the former Imagination could offer no other Advantage than that of a WindingSheet presented and prepared for our approaching Fate But why mention I Imagination In me 'twas wholly dormant And yet those Sons of stormy Weather the Sailors had theirs about them in full Stretch for seeing the Wind and Seas so very boi∣sterous they lash'd the Rudder of the Ship resolv'd to let her drive and steer herself since it was past their Skill to steer her This was our Way of sojourning most Part of that tedious Night driven where the Winds and Waves thought fit to drive us with all our Sails quite lower'd and flat upon the Deck If  Ovid  in the little  Archipelagian  Sea could whine out his  jam jam jacturus  c in this more dismal Scene and much more dange∣rous Sea the Pitchlike Darkness of the Night adding to all our sad Variety of Woes  what Words in Verse or Prose could serve to paint our Passions or our Expectations Alas our only Expectation was in the Re∣turn of Morning It came at last yet even slowly as it came when come we thought it come too soon a new Scene of sudden Death being all the Advantage of its first Appear∣ance Our Ship was driving full Speed to∣wards the  Breakers  on the  Cabritton  Shore between  Burdeaux  and  Bayonne  which fil∣led us with Ideas more terrible than all be∣fore since those were past and these seemingly as certain Beside to add to our Distress the Tide was driving in and consequently must drive us fast to visible Destruction A State so evident that one of our Sailors whom great Experience had render'd more sensible of our present Danger was prepa∣ring to save one by lashing himself to the main Mast against the expected Minute of Desolation He was about that melancholy Work in utter Despair of any better Fortune when as loud as ever he could bawl he cry'd out  a Point a Point of Wind  To me who had had too much of it it appear'd like the Sound of the last Trump but to the more intelligent Crew it had a different Sound With Vi∣gour and Alacrity they started from their Prayers or their Despair and with all ima∣ginable Speed unlash'd the Rudder and hoist∣ed all their Sails Never sure in Nature did one Minute produce a greater Scene of  Contraries The more skilful Sailors took Courage at this happy Presage of Delive∣rance And according to their Expecta∣tion did it happen that heavenly Point of Wind deliver'd us from the Jaws of those  Breakers  ready open to devour us and carrying us out to the much more wellcome wide Sea furnished every one in the Ship with Thoughts as distant as we thought our Danger  WE endeavour'd to make  Port Passage  but our Ship became unruly and would not answer her Helm for which Reason we were glad to go before the Wind and make for the Harbour of  Saint Jean de Luz  This we attain'd without any great Difficulty and to the Satisfaction of all Sailors as well as Passengers we there cast Anchor after the most terrible Storm as all the oldest Sailors agreed and as much Danger as ever Peo∣ple escap'd  HERE I took notice that the Sailors buoy'd up their Cables with Hogsheads enquiring into the Reason of which they told me that the Rocks at the Bottom of the Harbour were by Experience found to be so very sharp that they would other∣wise cut their Cables asunder Our Ship was obliged to be drawn up into the Dock to be refitted during which I lay in the Town where nothing of Moment or worth reciting happen'd  I beg Pardon for my Errors the very Movements of Princes must always be consi∣derable and consequently worth Recital While the Ship lay in the Dock I was one Evening walking upon the Bridge with the little Island near it which I have before spoke of and had a little  Spanish  Dog a∣long with me when at the further End I spy'd a Lady and three or four Gentlemen in Company I kept on my Pace of Leisure and so did they but when I came nearer I found they as much out number'd me in the Dog as they did in the human Kind And I soon experienced to my Sorrow that their Dogs by their Fierceness and Illhu∣mour were Dogs of Quality having with∣out Warning or the least Declaration of War fallen upon my little Dog accord∣ing to pristine Custom without any honou∣rable Regard to Size Interest or Num∣ber However the good Lady who by the Privilege of her Sex must be allow'd the most competent Judge of Inequalities out of an Excess of Condescension and Good∣ness came running to the Relief of oppres∣sed poor  Tony  and in courtly Language rated her own oppressive Dogs for their great Incivility to Strangers The Dogs in the Middle of their insulting Wrath o∣bey'd the Lady with a vast deal of profound Submission which I could not much won∣der at when I understood that it was a  Queen Dowager of  Spain  who had chid them  Our Ship being now repaired and made fit to go out again to Sea we left the Har∣bour of  Saint Jean de Luz  and with a much better Passage as the last Tempest was still dancing in my Imagination in ten Days Sail we reach'd  Dover  Here I land∣ed on the last Day of  March  having not till then seen or touch'd  English  Shoar from the Beginning of  May    I took Coach directly for  London  where when I arriv'd I thought my self transport∣ed into a Country more foreign than any I had either fought or pilgrimag'd in Not foreign do I mean in respect to others so much as to it self I left it seemingly un∣der a perfect Unanimity The fatal Distin∣ctions of  Whig  and  Tory  were then esteemed meerly nominal and of no more ill Conse∣quence or Danger than a Bee robb'd of its Sting The national Concern went on with Vigour and the prodigious Success of the Queen's Arms left every Soul without the least Pretence to a Murmur But now on my Return I found them on their old Esta∣blishment perfect Contraries and as un∣likely to be brought to meet as direct An∣gles Some arraigning some extolling of a Peace in which Time has shown both were wrong and consequently neither could be right in their Notions of it however an over  prejudic'd Way of thinking might draw them into one or the other But  Whig  and  Tory  are in my Mind the compleatest Pa∣radox in Nature and yet like other Para∣doxes old as I am I live in Hope to see before I die those seeming Contraries per∣fectly reconcil'd and reduc'd into one happy Certainty the Publick Good  Whilst I stay'd at  Madrid  I made seve∣ral Visits to my old Acquaintance General  Mahoni  I remember that he told me when the Earl of  Peterborow  and he held a Con∣ference at  Morvidro  his Lordship used many Arguments to induce him to leave the  Spa∣nish  Service  Mahoni  made several Excuses especially that none of his Religion was suf∣fer'd to serve in the  English  Army My Lord reply'd That he would undertake to get him excepted by an Act of Parliament I have often heard him speak with great Re∣spect of his Lordship and was strangely sur∣prized that after so many glorious Successes he should be sent away  He was likewise pleased to inform me that at the Battle of  Saragoza  'twas his Fortune to make some of our Horse to give way and he pursued them for a considerable time but at his Return he saw the  Spanish  Army in great Confusion But it gave him the Opportunity of attacking our Battery of Guns which he performed with great  Slaughter both of Gunners and Matrosses He at the same time inquired who 'twas that commanded there in chief I informed him 'twas Col  Bourguard  one that understood the Oeconomy of the Train exceeding well As for that he knew nothing of but that he would vouch he behaved himself with extraordinary Courage and defended the Battery to the utmost Extremity receiving several Wounds and deserved the Post in which he acted A Gentleman who was a Prisoner at  Gualaxara  informed me that he saw King  Philip  riding through that Town being only attended with one of his Guards  Saragoza  Saragoza  or  Caesar Augusta  lies upon the River  Ebro  being the Capital of  Arra∣gon  'tis a very ancient City and contains fourteen great Churches and twelve Con∣vents The Church of the Lady of the  Pil∣lar  is frequented by Pilgrims almost from all Countries 'twas anciently a Roman Colony  Tibi laus tibi honor tibi sit gloria O gloriosa Trinitas quia tu dedisti mihi hanc op∣portunitatem omnes has res gestas rec  r∣dandi Nomen tuum sit benedictum per saecula saeculorum Amen  FINIS
