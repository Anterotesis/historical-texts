THE STAGE As it has been is and ought to be  With biographical Anecdotes of Messrs MOSSOP DEXTER DERRICK and the AUTHOR  Schoolfellows  and public Cotemporaries  LONDON Sold by T EVANS PaternosterRow and J BELL near ExeterChange in the Strand  A SUMMARY VIEW OF THE ENGLISH SCOTS and IRISH STAGES  THE utility and dignity of the Stage when properly conducted has never been disputed in any age or nation by men of liberal sentiments in church or state some exclamatory blasts of enthusiasm have indeed at different times made virulent yet feeble attacks some faint remains of these now and then issue  officially  from Tottenhamcourtroad and Moorfields instructors but even they only utter invectives to preserve custom and affected sanctity while their hearers as well as themselves laugh at the unnecessary frivolous delusion the stage should not complain of this abuse as every institution may be and certainly is misconducted as well as misrepresented indeed as to the scandalous irrational and most illiberal Roman act adopted ridiculously by our legislature which stigmatizes performers while not only the matter and manner of their performances have been and are legally authorized and universally encouraged it deserves general reprobation and theatrical contempt  Roscius Cicero  's idol if his profession could be originally deemed bad should receive no credit from excellence in pursuing an infamous path as well might a dexterous highwayman claim praise for excelling in actions totally unsufferable  Some three years since I publickly invited a bigotted preacher in Scotland to bring  one  text of scripture in corroboration of his rigid opinions I asked if dramatic compositions were inconsistent with strict christianity why Saint Paul should have quoted from a Greek author in that sphere with some other pinching interrogations which appeared unanswerable and occasioned what I did not wish or mean the defection of many subscribers to this person's preaching a manifest temporal injury to him  In the course of what I have to offer I shall be desultory consequently unmethodical I shall produce nothing which does not in my idea deserve notice but as to arrangement I shall let circumstances and anecdotes fall in as they may the  more to sport with and amuse attention I shall endeavour to pursue  Othello  's rule and "nothing extenuate" even respecting myself "nor ought let down in malice" concerning others while impartiality is my guide I wish to be  the moment I pass that line may contempt be my portion the same contempt I have ever entertained for envy malevolence and adulation three common attendants upon  actors and every degree of public life A str  ng symptom of pride may appear in this declaration but a strict attenti  n to the several degrees of human nature with many severe  ubs some gleams of sunshine many selfdelusions more relative ones and rigid inspection into social connections have made me I presume a tolerable judge of the subject I now enter upon  From every historical circumstance we have reason to believe that such entertainments as a theatre affords could not be in a state of regularity or elegance for many years after their existence the reformation in its infancy the grand Spanish invasion not only threatened but prosecuted these and other succeeding circumstances all contributed to prevent that justice of exhibition for  Shakespeare  's inimitable productions which they deserved no amendment could be expected in the quibbling sanctified pedantic witchhunting period of  James  the First as to the miserable monarch his son  Charles  his time of royalty was so perplexed so turbulent and so fatal to himself nothing gentle elegant amusing or instructive could possibly prevail  Cromwell  's prevalence though a glorious aera for the nation was very unfavourable and necessarily so to the drama after the interregnum if I may so call an admirable and spirited administration of government  A volatile and we may add politic monarch came forward who perceiving a settled gloom on the nation determined to work a change by introducing the levity of wit the glare of show the ba  t of gallantry and a general plan of dissipation to shake off attention from matters of serious concern if ever the stage was prostituted it was at this time amidst a flow of great of original powerful genius  Dryden  may stand a proof of the whole who ranted pompously enthusiastically in his tragedies and descended to the lowest most fulsome stuff in his comedies however in this reign we may commence the first degree of theatrical excellence as to performers and upon a retrospect we find great uniformity in the  cast  of plays as it is phrased every one like a good soldier kept his place and by not being  misplaced  we may conclude made a  good  figure nay from the best accounts we are taught to believe so even the printed dramas strengthen this opinion and this is one of the best methods to judge by both comparatively and decisively as in examining the present stage hereafter  I will clearly demonstrate From this period composition and representation have save the comedies of  C  ve  and  Farquhar  with  Rowe  's tragedies been improving I mean as approaching nearer nature I do not contend for spirit character or invention in favour of the present age but a claim to superior propriety may b  justly maintained upon compari  on  The aera of  Wilkes Booth  and  Cibber  has been highly blazened and there is reason to credit tradition in many points but from the imitators of them I have seen who though they had by no means equal execution certainly possessed their manner it was offensive to chaste criticism thus  Quin  's turgid swell was derived from  Booth  who catched his from  Betterton  young  Cibber  's caricature grimace and snipsnap expression were but the remnants of his father's oddity and the late Mr  Giffard  's genteel comedy which he valued himself upon was but a costive retail of that formal gentility which obtained for Mr  Wilkes  when fullbottomed wigs mechanic utterance and stiff deportment were in fashion general applause  From their time to Mr  Garrick  's introduction of nature upon the stage dramatic entertainments were miserably mangled amidst wretched anarchy and most disgraceful management  The Irish stage till Mr  Sheridan  's assuming the reins of direction was from all I have been able to learn scarce worth mention in my own remembrance four  Elrington  's the most deplorable manglers of dialogue serious or comic that ever disgraced a TheatreRoyal monopolized all the principal characters the women were perfect mopsqueezers and the decorations mere puppetshow trumpery Mr  Sheridan  laboured for and in a great measure effected a reformation if his execution as an actor had been equal to his judgement and his general succe  s as a manager been equal to his liberality  spirit his condescension to performers and his zeal for the stage he would have made ere now a very genteel fortune but being in some points capricious and rather too fond of rigid exercise of authority he incurred at various times very prejudicial public resentment and though supported by many friends he was frequently attacked both by public and private foes 'till at length from a r  iculous attachment to court principles for he was wonderfully fond of a smile at the castle levees he drew upon himself a storm which blighted all his fairest hopes and b  re away with it the fruit of much labour and several favourable harvests  To this gentleman for whom I shall always entertain a proper degree of respect I stand indebted for an introduction to the stage an introduction more like that of a friend than a manager from whom had I chosen to stay in his theatre I  had reason to expect the most l  beral encouragement Here to anticipate any biographical manufacturer who might in future as actor or author gibbet me up to the view of posterity I shall give an impartial narrative of my coming into and general progress thro' life which will naturally take in by connexions some schoolfellows and public cotemporaries whom I wish to preserve from misrepresentation as much as I do myself  Without any boast of parentage suffice it to say my father had the general repute of an honest man who without any brilliance of parts possessed a share of sense to command respect he had seen much of the world and from thence laid in a stock of liberal notions by forty years service in the army during which time he had seen many coxcombs of fortune titles or interest put over his head he obtained a Captain's commission in this station most unfortunately for me he died when I was but seventeen he was blessed with a wife and I with a mother who by invariable conduct proved herself a worthy pattern of both characters  The d of October gave me to this mortal stage my state of infancy was most affectionately attended to and by unremitting care an imperfect constitution rendered very strong at ten or a little after I was put under the care of Mr Butler a clergyman who kept a grammarschool in Diggesstreet Dublin here my first acquaintance and intimacy began with Messrs  Mossop  and  Dexter  both within a year of my age Mr  Mossop  's father residing at his rectory his son Henry was sent to the care of an uncle who then kept a bookseller's shop this uncle put him to Mr  Butler  's school and lodged him at an obscure butcher's in an obscure market as I presume for cheapness sake not very happy in his situation he frequently by leave passed a few days at my father's with me and being of a grave cast was much liked by all the family as well as myself  During the space of five years we were inseparable and as I thought that kind of esteem daily grew upon us which seldom terminates but with life At fifteen I had the misfortune to obtain a commission in the same regiment with my father the inconveniency of which station I did not experience till the death of my best friend brought it to light indeed before that melancholy event I began to dislike the school of Mars which was then and I am afraid is too much so still a scene of dissipation and excess exceedingly dangerous for a young unformed mind possessed of warm passions  In the year of the rebellion a camp of men was formed at Bennet'sbridge near Kilkenny which tho' a pleasing show was certainly an idle affair discipline being in a most relaxed state our marchings and countermarchings our  sweatings and our swimmings were almost as laughable as Major  S  urgeon  's expedition to Acton Ealing c however we furnished many important paragraphs for the Dublin newspapers▪ one of which I well remember though we were but fifty miles from the capital killed of us by an epidemical distemper which had never been heard of in the camp a strong proof of what authentic intelligence those political vehicles convey  From Bennet'sbridge we returned to Dublin duty here I found Messrs  Mossop  and  Dexter  members of Trinitycollege the former complained grievously at the narrowness of his allowance lamenting his discontent in a romantic fit of friendship I gave him my commission purposing to accomplish myself for the church this circumstance he has often mentioned as I have been informed however he had not interest to get the tran  fer ratified by government From Dublin we were ordered into separate quarters the company I belonged to was destined for Cashell neither the Captain nor Lieutenant attending a pretty circumstance in time of war the care of a hundred men fell to my share the route pointed out our way and we pursued it with commendable regularity save as I suspected the plunder of some henroosts on our arrival at Cashell a well situated pleasant plentiful city I received a complimentary message from the new mayor who was that day giving a feast on commencing magistracy to partake of the festivityI attended was received with most polite hospitality and found myself immediately acquainted with near thirty leading gentlemen thus far was well but it being a kind of custom in that county to drink a visiter's senses away I sustained a most formidable attack surrounded by seasoned veterans at length my prudence head and heels gave way and I fell a sacrifice to Bacchus but not till three Aldermen and two Parsons had previously fallen prostrate  This was rather an unfavourable commencement but during my stay in the place afterwards I kept rather aloof and was better enabled thereto by passing much time in the family of a gentleman who had three very agreeable daughters one of whom tho' at least twelve years older than myself had rearly captivated me however Cupid perhaps thinking me a trifling conquest let me for that time escape Dr  Price  then Archbishop of the see was another strong motive of prevention from excess for as that liberalminded prelate very condescendingly gave me a general invitation to his palace and to ride with him which took place every fair morning I was edifyingly drawn from the company of those who prefer hunting and the bottle to every mental enjoyment  I was not above four months in this very agreeable and I may add profitable situation till my party was ordered to Kinsale  where a large number of French prisoners were rather refractory At Corke I found two hundred of those gently waiting to be conducted to Kinsale by me I took them in charge but never recollected till we had marched eight miles that there was not a grain of ammunition in the whole party however nothing amiss happened  At Kinsale discipline took place and the young officers were commendably attentive but being altogether in a mess we misled one another abominably both as to expences and constitutions our propensity to dissipation was considerably increased by the goodnatured volatility of Capt  Henry Boyle Walsingham  son of the then Speaker of the House of Commons whose unbounded goodnature and uncommon flow of spirits rendered him amiably delusive and persons who had little but their pay endeavouring to associate with him ran into difficulties which however his generosity having a large income besides a captain's commission often removed  I cannot pay a just tribute to the merits of this young gentleman taken out of life too soon as with a few more years and reflection he would have been a very compleat ornament of society and a most valuable friend to his country  While we were at Kinsale together an account reached us that liberty was given to raise two regiments for the Dutch service being tired of a life so inactive in the military view as ours then was we determined to apply for commissions of an advanced rank in one of those regiments he promised to take me by the hand which would have insured me success and even offered to assist with money if any thing of that kind seemed necessary The Dutch design being dropped on a view of peace I was foolish enough to give a hundred guineas for advance of rank in the same regiment without considering it took me from a station wherein I stood secure from reduction and placed me in one of the four additional companies which about eight months after were reduced here I found myself within the penurious limits of halfpay I had a right to some freehold property but being under age could not dispose of it and was cheated out of the rent all but a trifle by a knavish tenant  Here I flew to the stage without any great affection for it as a performer and found a most gentlemanlike reception from Mr  Sheridan  who judiciously recommended  Aboan  in  O  oon  ko  for my trial in which notwithstanding a most unconsequential figure and uncommon timidity I succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectations but this did by no means reconcile me to the back of the curtain as the spirit of malevolence envy and scandal was hourly invading my ears A season and a half passed without one symptom of ambition to urge for parts and at a time when Mr  Sheridan  had  marked out a very reputable cast for me I declined so precipitate a retreat was in a great measure occasioned by receiving a letter that an uncle of mine till then totally unknown to me even by name had died in the EastIndies and left me l this gave me a turn for domestic life as the sale of my little freehold was likely exclusive of a l mortgage to produce me l more When of age I was advised that on coming to London or by sending proper authority I might receive my Indian legacy desirous of seeing the English capital I set out  Here I shall return a littleDuring my connection with the Dublin theatre I received a letter from Mr  Mossop  then in London that he had been drawn from Ireland by the invitation of an uncle who as he said would do nothing material for him that he had offered himself to Mr  Garrick  and Mr  Rich  who both the latter is not surprising deemed him unworthy acceptance and therefore requested I would mention him to Mr  Sheridan  I did and was informed that a Mr  Marshall  with whom we were both intimate had previously mentioned the matter I was asked some questions which I answered with all the friendship and impartiality my ever favourite principle would allow Mr  Sheridan  always above envy gave him a cordial invitation he came over and had his choice of parts he very judiciously chose  Zanga  in the  Revenge  and displayed in it an astonishing degree of beautiful wildness his amazing powers of voice were clearly perceived and unanimously approved his action was what in a great measure it ever remained forced aukward and unpicturesque his emphasis mechanical and laborious however a whole pit full of collegians terrified criticism from any exertion for two nights and indeed his merit went so far before his faults that the encouragement tho' enthusiastic was right  The same week which produced Mr  Mossop  to public view furnished the stage with another very considerable ornament Mr  Digges  who had been an officer a young gentleman furnished with very agreeable and essential requisites such as a graceful person a comely countenance marking eyes and a fulltoned distinct tho' not harmonious voice  These two competitors set off in the race of fame nearly together and emulated with becoming spirit however Mr  Mossop  both in diligence and powers rather outstripped his competitor tho' Mr  Digges  has since shown himself a much more general performer By so powerful a reinforcement Mr  Sheridan  had a brilliant season nor did he as has been practised since bind rising merit to a kind of an apprenticeship upon penurious terms he rewarded them liberally and brought them forward with rapid speed  A ludicrous instance of Mr  Mossop  's capricious haughtiness may out of many be produced after performing the part of  Zanga  three nights he chose  Richard  for a fourth appearance and most unaccountably dressed the character in puckered white sattin Mr  Sheridan  very justly observing that it had a most coxcombly appearance the remark reached Mr  Mossop  's ear who next morning went to the manager's room and most emphatically addressed him thus  "Mr  Sheridan  I hear you said I dressed  Richard  like a  coxcomb  that is an  affront  you wear a sword pull it out of the  scabbard  I'll draw mine and thrust it into your  belly  "  This furious attack was smiled off and had an amicable conclusion  A circumstance here strikes recollection painfully which is that success in less than a month raised my schoolfellow so high on tragedystilts that a most ungracious reserve prevailed in his deportment and even to me he was the great man tho' civil Tho' I ever admired merit and respected preeminence I never did nor never will idolize either this he wanted in both respects I would not flatter my friendship forbad it he grew shy according to the dictates of his pride thus fell gradually into decay what I wished a permanent friendship I may have been too ready to catch offence but he certainly was too ready to furnish cause I was rather concerned at such a divorce of an early regard yet I believe we still entertained good wishes for each other and am willing to stile it the jarring of two oddities who had not forbearance sufficient for each others foibles  This supposed defection of a friend hastened my expedition to England I reached Chester at a time when Mr  Macklin  had brought an excellent company to that city knowing several of the members and wishing to know others I protracted my journey a matter of three months which passed pleasantly and rationally save too great expence loss of time and a near chance of matrimony which would then have been peculiarly indiscreet One leading defect of my disposition has been procrastination which has operated most powerfully however I was not totally idle for during my stay I altered  Ben Johnson's Sejanus  which I shall speak of in future Just previous to setting off for London Mr  Derrick  another early acquaintance pursued my steps not liking the avocation he was placed to  viz  that of a linendraper very bare of cash and little acquainted I was obliged to stand forth for him which I had great pleasure in doing  Soon after coming to London for sake of better air I took lodgings at Richmond Mr  Derrick  remained with me there near a year and was most of the time using his admirable talents for pushing into an extensive acquaintance while I waited with philosophic patience tho' not proper oeconomy  for my expected legacy passed most of my time in reading  the employment of my pen A strong degree of theatrical frenzy having seized poor  Derrick  who contrary to  sense and void of every executive requisite would make a stage attempt in friendly compassion I prevailed on him to assume a character wherein his diminutive and deformed figure would not be so laughable he in consequence murdered  Gloster  in  Jane Shore  and I believe convinced himself a well as the audience that he could never be bearable for I recollect no similar attemptwell for the stage if many others had followed so sensible an example  During my stay at Richmond I published the alteration of  Johnson's Sejanus  and from a connection my father had with the  Orrery  family I dedicated it to the late Earl  John  whose literary abilities and extreme liberal turn of mind reflected honour on nobility and even on the name of  Boyle  being ever of a distant nature in matters of this sort I referred presentation of the copy to Mr  Derrick  who never was better pleased than when employed in this manner he brought me a verbal account that my piece was politely received and that his Lordship wished to see me at his house then in Leicesterfields I obeyed the summons and never experienced more affability or good sense than at this interview he was pleased to say that I had given  some  marks of genius but feared if I should in future shew  much improved  abilities they would be but of little advantage for as he emphatically observed the fountainhead of critical taste was frozen and benumbed if you have a turn for politics continues his Lordship and will prostitute principle to profit either for or against administration some lucrative consequences will doubtless ensue but if you are an honest principled writer ten to one but  laudatur alget  is a proper motto for you how far I have found this veri  ied I won't pretend to say but heartily wish I had been fated to use an awl and end sooner than the pen for nothing but a pensioned defender of government a sycophant to managers or a slave to booksellers can do any thing more than crawl  In about a week after I had seen Lord  Orrery  I received from him a letter with an order on Mr  Hoare  his banker for twenty guineas and an observation  "that he wished more substantial approbation to attend every future production of mine"  After this the only profit from dedication I ever experienced and indeed did not expect I never saw his Lordship  However Mr  Derrick  made such good use of his first visit that he pursued and at lengthmiraculous to thinkdrew his Lordship as well as some other distinguished characters  nto a cordial epistolary correspondence A little after this period I was saluted with an account that my legacy was arrived and payable but how was I surprized to find that three  honest  lawyers here had upon perusing my uncle's will explained away l out of the l I expected this disagreeable stroke precipitated me into fresh dissipation which shortly narrowed my circumstances much and occasio  ed me to accept an engagement for Mr  Simpson's  theatre at Bath  Before my expedition thither under the gothic management of one Mr  Phillip  's an old theatrical coxcomb vain of playing and covetous of money I had the pleasure to see both town houses in a very reputable state of performance but as to tragedy save some of Mr  Garrick  's peculiar parts if I may so speak Coventgarden was much superior in comedy Drurylane claimed manifest precedence there never was a more masterly performance than  Every Man in his Humour  from  Kitely  to  Cash  every part was supported with a proportional degree of pleasant propriety  Mr  Mossop  who had reached the English stage had the Dublin audiences approbation cordially therefore essentially confirmed here yet though he possessed undoubted merit some share of what may be stiled good fortune attended him in both places for what the Irish  Collegians  began with animation the London  Templars  finished with zeal would he had been as friendly to himself as the public was to his endeavours Here as in Dublin too much illconcerted expence attended his pride yet I cannot recollect his circumstances were at this period so much reduced as those of some other successful knightserrant of the stage I have known no intimacy prevailed between us considerably owing I believe to my rigid remembrance of his sudden contemptible exaltation of deportm  nt and unfriendly precision of conversation below the idea of a liberal education and much more so of a liberal mind however before leaving town I paid him a complimentary visit when he wished me and I believe with friendly meaning all possible success  When arrived at  Bath  where the campaign was begun I found a very imperfect odd jumbled crew and according to many of the undertakings  I  was forced upon most of my endeavours only tended to make the groupe more ridiculous for being chiefly in a much varied capital line I must necessarily have been often capitally wrong however in the most unjustifiable attempts I always met with forbearance without the aid of a single puff or any support from personal acquaintances for I neither sought  obtained above twelve during eight months residence multiplicity of acquaintance and especially upon an interested plan I ever despised  So many repetitions of self are disagreeable but as they are unavoidable and as what I shall advance can be corrobolated o  contradicted by many persons living egotism becomes less painful and may be the more credible Amidst the study of a multiplicity of parts I wrote the  Suita  a tragedy which was well received though weakly performed even Mr  Quin  vouchsafed to say it was a tolerable  thing  but the male performers were mere  sprats  of mussulmen a remark not amiss for there were several light figures however that gentleman with more than usual condescension gave me on my night two guineas for a ticket wishing me a better  trade  than a Bath author or actor  "for says he the people of fashion come here only to tipple water or game and as to the town's people they understand little save extortion"  two points I found amply confirmed  The second season I produced  Zaphira  a tragedy on the same story of Dr  Brown's Barbarossa  but performed before that gentleman's piece came out at  Drurylane  it was better represented and better received than the  Sultan  though with less profit to me The same season I fitted up an alteration of  Shakespeare's Richard  the  Second  which though incumbered with too many characters of importance to be adequately supported by a country company for such  Bath  might then be called was also very well received indeed the performance of one Miss  Ibbot  the best  declamatory  actress I ever heard contributed much to the piece's reputation The manuscripts of these two tragedies have I know not how been purloined from me  During summer between the second and third seasons at  Bath  I came to  London  and found Mr  Derrick  studying law and practical philosophy in that agreeable academy the  where his situation would have been painfully exigent had not the late Sir  Francis Delaval  Mr  Foote  a Dr  Thompson  and through their assistance other gentlemen liberally subscribed for his support the me  ns of which was placed in Mr  Vailla  's hands from whom he received it weekly  Luckily when this supply was near exhausted I recommended his situation to the notice of a most benevolent gentlem  n who served him essentially as he has  me  on many occasions Mr  C  not only raised him twenty pounds subscription to a volume of poems but by means of the late  Serjeant H  d  got him out of confinement this pleasing point  d I went to  Bath  and there sound the company under the direction of Mr  King  whose spirited performances drawing better audiences than ever had been known there before and whose regular yet mild and gentlemanlike management rendered the theatre much more agreeable than to me it ever had been and to the proprietors much more prof  t  Departing from  Bath  I shall omit several excursions made to places of less note and only observe that during a year's vacation from dramatic connections I had an opportunity to see the  London  stages in their meridian glory and a very noble emulation carried on with great spirit and ability on each side the uniformity of each cast filled by persons devoted to a particular department was now strictly adhered to the managers did not then play the game of cross and pile as they do now nor make what is head one night tail another the policy of this scheme I shall presently elucidate as also endeavour at showing its manifest detriment to the stage in general and hackney'd drudges in particular  Having received an invitation from  Edinburgh  I went thither and met there on my arrival an extreme disagreeable disappointment Mr  Digges  and Mrs  Ward  two very popular favourites instead of joining the company as was expected decamped to  Dublin  leaving nothing to apologize for them and reduced me to the same disadvantageous state I was first in at  Bath  obliging me to take a porter's load on a schoolboy's back Judge of my regret when I was  obliged  to march on with a very insignificant figure the first night in  Othello  and the second in  Hotspur  parts I would ever have wished to decline after all I met indulgence and the season for six weeks during which time I had the misfortune to be  acting  manager a most disagreeable stationwent smoothly on at length considering some friends I had brought to the company and without whom it would have been truly deplorable ill used I resigned with secret joy the reins of painful government painful except where a thirst of power even in a pageant state stifles delicacy of feeling Several theatrical manoeuvres were practised to make me uneasy but finding me vulnerable only thro' the sides of my friends I was so closely attacked that way that an entire breach ensued and at the end of the season I parted with the managers as they stiled themselves on terms not the most polite however I was well pleased to get rid of such a disagreeable shuffling connection and wishing to see  Glasgow  a city I had heard much of I went thither without any public view  The place upon examination answered the description I had heard of it in the disposal of streets and elegance of buildings as well as in briskness of trade and opulence of merchants I was unexpectedly invited by some gentlemen who had seen me in  Edinburgh  to stay a few months and assist some persons of respectable families in the proper pronunciation of  English  some gentlemen of the university soon after applied to me for the same purpose I undertook the task with some reluctance but at length went through it pleasingly and profitably Just before my departure it was intimated to me  by persons of some influence that if I would settle there it was more than probable that a professorship for English oratory might be obtained for me with a settled salary and the advantage of pupils which I make no doubt would have turned out a comfortable establishment yet strange is the mind of man tho' from early years I had wished for a calm retreat now a very eligible and practicable one appeared a sudden wandering seized my brain and I  would  set off for  London  but not without returning warm and grateful acknowledgements for favours received and those proposed  From  Glasgow  I went to  Carlisle  over a country rather wild but good road rendered it agreeable at  Carlisle  which is a pretty little agreeable city peopled with genteel affable inhabitants but not much enriched with trade I expected a remittance from  Ireland  thro'  London  I waited a fortnight with patience then received information that my draft had been evaded highly chagrined at this and being ever more prone to revenge injuries on myself than other people I precipitately in the heat of vexation joined a company of  Thespians  then exhibiting there This is the only scene of real theatrical wretchedness both as to performance and finances I ever met indeed from the former nothing of the latter could be expected however I was only a pitying spectator of surrounding woes for some remains of cash and a tolerable benefit brought me through bareably  By means of the philosophy I always possessed upon a little reflection time would have passed agreeably enough here had not sympathetic feelings for the penury around me rather encumbered it two men of the company were rational and well behaved my landlord Boniface had a smart prattling agreeable daughter and there was lodged in the house a very affable young French prisoner by these with two or three honest blades of  Cumberland  my mind though not improved was innocently and often chearfully relaxed  At the end of five weeks I received an invitation from Mr  Whitley  whom I heard of as and found to be a reputable bustling judicious manager also a good actor in his line out of which the state of his company often forced him and perhaps sometimes inclination yet this admitted it is only what much greater performers have been guilty of many considerable towns have been and are much indebted to him for regularity good dresses and as suitable decorations as they could expect he also deserves praise for sustaining the stage with spirited resolution against much malevolence and many oppressive attacks  I took the road to  Scarbro'  which place as I staid there only a week I should not now have mentioned but for the following ludicrous affair  On my road thither I set up at a small house in a small village called  Kirkleatham  here I fell in for want of better company with half a dozen farmers and some servants of Mr  Turner  lord of the manor as it has been always an invariable rule with me to conform to the humours of every  strange  company as one method of knowing the general disposition of mankind I said as they did this conformity pleasing even to brutes with some compliments on Mr  Turner  obtained me the titles of honest fellow hearty cock c accompanied by several slaps on the shoulder and squeezes by the hand which from their roughness I would most gladly have excused however this social sunshine did not last long for happening to pull out my handkerchief a piece of paper dropped on which a person had traced out my road from  Carlisle  and specified the towns to prevent my mistaking a due direction from  Sunderland  to the place I have mentioned is all on the seacoast  Happening to go out of the room this paper was picked up by one who for a miracle could read they had while I saw my horse dispatch a feed of oats laid their politic noddles together and as I found had discovered me to be a  French Spy  On coming in I perceived looks of great distance consequence and curiosity silence reigned for about a minute when my making the trite observation that it was a right  English  meeting  "Look ye there says the oneeyed clerk of the parish did not I tell ye neighbours there are  French Papistes  about"  "ay says another turning to his righthand man I told thee Giles the pigtail was suspicious and dost see what a skeleton it ishe never eat beef or plumpudding in his life"  Not by any means comprehending these disjointed remarks I applied to my landlord for an explanation who said  "we all suspect thee to be a  French Spy  tho' for my part I can't say but you have called for supper like an  Englishman  and drank like one but our parish clerk and schoolmaster and the rest of the neighbours suspect you to be what I have said now as I am  constable  and magistrate d'ye see in his worship's absence who is gone to  Richmond  races I must look sharp"  "Right Mr  Constable  says a smart prig in a green coat and coachmanlike wig 'tis time to be wigilance I was born a cockney and know that there man is as sure  French  as I sit at this here table I have a right to be cunning a'ant I groom to a Justice of Peace and was'nt I whipperin to the  Lord Chancellor  sure I should know law"  In warmth I exclaimed whip the  Lord Chancellor  and  'Squire  too for having such fools as you about them  High treason was now echoed thro' the room for calling a  said the  Chancellor  and  'Squire  fools the wise and patriotic company here after giving solemn charge of me to my h  retired with no small apprehensions in their countenances My supper now approached and rather laughing upon recollection at so ridiculous an affair I sat down to it with good appetite asking my landlord to partake who with the resolution of a Caesar joined me in the attack declaring he did not think I would do him any harm  My room being guarded all night by a couple of stout labourers who first searched my pockets and pilfered as I found afterwards two very good razors in the morning I was conducted on horseback for there was no justice nearer than eight miles this was the first and indeed the last time I was ever admired by females for my beauty but they I suppose thinking the rope about my neck where e'er we passed pitifully exclaimed  "he's a likely weel far'd mon its a pity of him I hope as how may get off"  on our road too the tenderhearted constable with a most solemn face told me it was a pity that men should be hanged but it could not be helped and advised me to prepare for the worst I have a regard for you says he for you made me a good reckoning  When we came before the justice at a place called  Ayton  or vulgarly  Yatton  the matter was settled at once by my showing some letters I had about me particularly one from a gentleman whose person and handwriting he both knew After a sharp rebuff and some severe strictures from his worship upon the constable's illtimed activity we departed Mr  Longstaff  with all the penitence and politeness which defeated vermin of the law are capable of declared that we must not part till we had drank friends I rather declined this ceremony but complied to save worse trouble half a crown's worth of punch was called for with some cold beef c c several ludicrous observations passed from my companions among the rest my landlord declared  "that unless I would drink a glass of forgiveness to the parish clerk who had caused all this he knew the poor man so well his conscience would not let him sleep for putting an innocent man in the way of  hanging  for continues he if his worship had been as foolish as we folks of  Kirkleatham  who knows what might have happened"  Our repast over and a general forgiveness both for soul and body offered on my side my rejoiced conductor paid the reckoning I offered to be  Yorkshire club  but with a side insinuation he told me it was not out of  his pocket  the  parish  should pay it ay and  his  time the attendants horsehi  e c which when we have another halfcrown's worth says he  will make up about forty shillingsI know how to make up a constable's bill After two glasses of the second bowl I departed without a grain of resentment and I dare say my friends staid at the  parish expence  till they were as happy as princes  Having observed that I should at present only make bare mention of  Scarbro'  let us pass at once to  Manchester  and open to view a convenient though not an elegant theatre with a very good apparatus and a tolerable company the season was successful beyond my expectation the performers were cordial easy circumstances promote good humour the town's people were affable and social indeed I never met with more ease amidst opulence more industry with less selfishness or more critical taste with steady judgement than in this flourishing mart of trade the great capital excepted the audiences are liberal without levity and goodnatured without weakness  During the season I produced a  dramatic satire  called the  Mentalist  which thro' the uncommonly excellent performance of Mr  Ryder  now a  respectable  manager and deserving actor in one of the  Dublin  theatres met a truly favourable reception and rendered me pecuniary advantage  By the scandalous artifices of a person whom I had essentially served at  Bath  by tittletattle misrepresentations carried to both sides near the close of the season a difference somewhat serious in its nature arose between Mr  Whitley  and me from what I soon discovered I found and acknowledged then as I do now that he behaved with spirit and candour while I proceeded with censurable impetuosity though I believe no animosity remained on either side At the conclusion of the season I left his party determining  again  for London  I shall now for some time drop myself to pursue Mr  Mossop  and the general circumstances of the stageIn the theatre both male and female performers are in general the most discontented mortals breathing the top want to be higher and the bottom want to be top I know a performer of distinguished abilities no matter for his name who four and twenty years ago lamentingly told me that he had but one guinea and a half per week  "now continues he if I could but rise to  four  guineas I should reach my utmost ambition"  This same person by some happy requisites and about seven years practice without a grain of diligence attained to twice the extent of his wish yet was then as poor or poorer than when he first complained he has since trebled the advantages of his first idea yet though he may live more luxuriantly I cannot learn that he either has or ever had much money to spare  Discontent is the most irrational yet the most common perturbation of human nature it inva  es the wisest as well as the weakest and wherever admitted turns philosophy headlong out of doors somewhat of this having invaded Mr  Mossop  and occasioned him when well established with the  London  audience when possessed of a salary and other emolum  nt more than sufficient for every reasonable and some refin'd enjoyment of life considering him as a single man without one matrimonial wish in his heart when treated as he since told me with great gentility by Mr  Garrick  transported himself I may justly so phrase it to  Ireland  Let it be observed that Mr  Barry  and Mr  Woodward  acted on the same  wise  plan but as the latter exhibited his penitence publickly and the former I am told recollects his splendid but impoverishing reign with sincere inward compunction we'll cast a shade over the whole lavish blunder  Dublin  was never made for two theatres nor ever will properly support that number  one real  good company rather bears hard on the theatrical finances of that metropolis for what avails general spirit without money to support that spirit  Hence Messrs  Barry  and  Woodward  who had money to lose lost it and my old schoolfellow who had little more than public merit and private character to sacrifice impaired both very much During the greatest part of his mock monarchy he was but ruler of a crew not much above the mendicant tribe if he had pompous dresses for himself an unlimited round of characters some quality acquaintance who stripped him of more by private gaming than they served him in public and the free exercise of his own infallible opinion he was happy though hourly solicited by starving actors and daily watched by keenscented bailiffs he prostituted native honesty which I am sure he possessed to insuperable pride and immoveable obstinacy When the disposal of parts was in his own power thinking the  king's  name a  tower of defence  he undertook as many things out of his way as he did in it hence in the general view he resembled a man who wears a suit of cloaths of contrast materials look at his right side he is velvet and elegance turn to his left he is coarse frize which tho' warm and convenient is offensively misplaced  For some seasons this unhappy and in the main  great  man maintained painful unprofitable and perturbed authority he was all through an entire slave to his passions and most part of the time a prisoner to his circumstances and he who thought one half if not all mankind beneath him could for occasional forbearance bribe and truckle to the most contemptible rascally set of the human speciesneed the word  bailiffs  be added  However paradoxical this may appear it is certainly true and shows how very contradictory the human heart is often to itself after toiling through much more than I am able or think necessary to relate  outlines  of misery are sufficient he was seized with a malignant fever which unfortunately for himself and I may add for all his wellwishers did not take him off yet shattered his constitution so much that to my immediate knowledge he could never have made in public a figure equal to his original abilities of this I shall mention more and more properly hereafter  My next trip from  Manchester  was to join a company as it was called of kidnapped comedians picked up from  London Dublin  c led by one  Bardin  a noted adventurer who without any consent obtained from the magistrates most ignorantly and impudently intruded himself and unhappy Co upon the town of  Liverpool  where the  wise Mayor  had at that time conceived a  wise  prejudice against theatrical performances why or wherefore he knew not but power is power however used A set of people who innocent with regard to their general intentions were decoyed there by threats of prosecution curiously fabricated in the chicanery of law the performers were not only intimidated but their finances were so much reduced that they neither knew how to return or how to stay upon  honest  principles indeed I believe two or three were capable of  any  retreat not possessing the lastmentioned ingredient  The principle of selfdefence in the first place and a social concern for persons trepanned into a premunire made me strike out a rational evasion of that childish or rancorous law which makes that in common prosecutable which a  Royal Patent  can sanctify my scheme was to stile and to occupy the  theatre  as a school of  Oratory  for the explanation of moral and practical philosophy both according to the ancients and moderns to render this plausible and indeed incontrovertible as to both law equity and common sense I gave before each of the pieces a short introductory lecture upon the general subject and tendency of the play a point not amiss to be practised here instead of farcical unmeaning prologues  For six or seven nights that we performed our little hovel was filled and every thing bore a pleasing prospect as to profit nor did any storm immediately threaten our quiet but Mr  Mayor  a wonderful man thinking the territory of his jurisdiction was invaded  determined  sense or no sense to suppress the same kind of entertainment in winter which at a most improper season the summer he was an encourager of to say a disagreeable truth it was on good authority reported that the  London  company who had been excluded that summer had interposed to effect our exclusion which took place  accordingly but not in the ungenteel tyranical manner designed by our adversaries for sorry am I to say that the late Mr  Holland  going from  Manchester  to  London  took  Liverpool  in his way and offered  liberally  to lay a gentleman who told me of it live guineas that the  itenerants  what was he at the time would all be  shop'd  his polite phrase in less than a week He was deceived in this point and would have been in the whole of his expectations had not a miserable illiterate wretch who has since played at  Drurylane  on being interrogated  how he lived  answered  by the stage  which was equally mean and false mean as he had been instructed otherwise and false as it was impossible he could  live  by what he in no shape understood  On the day before our defeat from the above paltry explanation took place our valorous manager ever renowned for being the first in and the first out of a scrape secreted himself as I was credibly informed in a coalhouse and a person who now fancies himself the paragon of actorsoh dire necessity of the stagesculked out of town accompanied by a flimzy female his  then  wife  The noble group of heroes and heroines dissolved some scrambled back to  London  with this small difference of carriage that several who came down in the coach were glad to return in the basket others swam upon credit to  Dublin  while Mr  Hurst  of  Drurylane  and I remained we gave two or three lectures were indulged with genteel audiences and put some essential pounds in our pockets I also delivered two for servants as they are stiled of the company who I understood to be pennyless they were by this effort to my very great satisfaction decently relieved thus ended an expedition well conceived miserably conducted and pitifully marred  From this mingled scene of laughter and woe I went to  Chester  where I again met Mr  Whitley  having several cordial and respectable friends in the city I resolved to pass some time there as a private visiter At my leisure hours I wrote the  Modish Wife  and though I had no connection with or emolument from the company I gave my manuscript to the manager to use it he chose it he received the offer politely and got the piece up with care it was very well performed and most kindly received for four nights though full three quarters of an hour longer of performance than in its present state Mr  Hurst  who did a material part can testify this  During my stay I also pieced together a little interlude calculated for an admirable set of children called the  Fairy Court  this trifle was so excellently presented so indescribably supported by the little ones especially by one Miss  Wheeler    not then eight years of age that it ran fifteen nights  benefits a circumstance scarce ever known in a country town save in the case of the  Beggar's Opera  when it find came out I don't mention this any further in praise of myself than in furnishing ideas which the children so aptly conceived and so excellently expressed besides I had novelty on my side as so very young a dramatis personae had never been seen there  At this period being near  Dublin  I was much inclined to visit my native soil but a fresh and material disappointment irritated me to a new theatrical expedition to which I was the more readily induced by the formation of a new company set on foot by two persons I wished extremely well I joined the infant society which was very regular  and respectable in private though the  e was not much stage merit to boast of I made a tour of twelve months and though some rubs interrupted us yet I had the pleasure at parting to know that my friend Mr  Bates  then sole proprietor was if not quite very near established indeed a few mon  hs proved the matter he has since maintained a very advantageous circuit in  Yorkshire  wherein from his complacent disposition good regulations and punctual honesty he has acquired universal esteem and I heartily hope a c  mfortable competency no man deserves it better either as a conductor of a theatre or as a member of society  It may seem odd that I make particular mention of persons little it at all known here but I shall always be glad of acknowledging worth when and wherever I find it  Having by my own desire and on the utmost terms of friendship quitted this connection just when profits began to be considerable I went from  Scarbro'  a place like  Bath  made up in the summer of fantastical people of quality and ravenous tradesmen who prey on them let me except however the seafaring part who are blunt hospitable and sincere  I now went once more sick of public life to an agreeable and reasonable markettown about twenty miles from  York  called  Malton  remained there a year and married a most deserving femaleexcuse a sigh and tear to her loved memory I remained in this domestic retreat four years and experienced from the inhabitants save  one  with whom I had some dealings in the  bill way  very kind friendly treatment as also from some leading gentlemen in the neighbourhood During my residence here I wrote a thing in two volumes called a  Trip to the Moon  which had uncommon praise in that part of the world and was not severely treated by those critical dictators the Monthly Reviewers yet the success of that publication was no way considerable  My pen was next employed by advice of a gentleman consequ  n fortune and connexions in composing a set of fables for his ROYAL HIGHNESS the PRINCE of WALES the work was perused and approved by several acknowledged judges it was corrected and published under the inspection of a gentleman here whom I should think it an honour to name were such freedom consistent with delicacy it was dedicated by  permission  to his ROYAL HIGHNESS was presented and graciously received I had in consequence a very polite letter from a Lady of Quality eminent in her station at courtbut further on this point we say not  After this moonshine gleam of advantage had passed over a  sh prospect the more agreeable as unexpected started up I mean the patronage of that justly and generally lamented friend of his country the late  Marq  ss  of  Granby  A gentleman who knew my father's and my former  ation recommended me to his Lordship shewing him at the same time some of my productions the consequence was that he would provide  comfortably  for me a promise I had afterwards from the  Marquiss  's own mouth Near twelve months I waited in pleasing expectation then came to town and had not been above a quarter of a year when death my frequent friend in such cases before and since robbed me of my foremost hope and a favourite son in the s  m day  With essential philosophy I looked forward and endeavoured to avoid casting a glance behind notwithstanding a peevish state of circumstances urged perturbation at this time I waited on Mr  Foote  who had the following  comedy  recommended by the late Sir  Francis Delaval  two years in his possession he waved bringing it out pleading the insufficiency of his company to do a five act piec    In lieu of rejecting my piece Mr  Foote  very kindly and then conveniently for me offered a summer engagement which I gratefully accepted played and was without any agreement gratified by Mr  F  ote  's generosity with a  al  y which according to the state of his  theatre  and the little trouble performers have there beyond my own opinion With this gentleman I passed three agreeable and advantageous summers an expedition to  Edinburgh  one of the intervening winters was though pleasant rather a ballance against me as I took no benefit however renewing some valuable acquaintanceships and having the pleasure to see a great improvement not only in the city but in customs manners and critical task I by no means lamented pecuniary deficiencies During my connection with the  Haymarket  I fabricated two after pieces the  oba  mist  and  Cupid's Revenge  which were exceedingly well received yet again P  l G  rlick received but trifling advantage March most fatally deprived me of a companion  equal to every idea of matrimonial happiness whose loved memory no revolutions fortunate or adverse will ever eraze great indeed have been the prejudices of mind and circumstances accruing from this very fatal and most unexpected catastrophe health recollection and every mental exertion were for some months thrown into absolute confusion  About a  fortnight  before Mr  Foote  's theatre began I was struck with an information that he had no more occasion for my assistance this at a time of peculiar embarrassment embarrassment known to the manager was what I could not at that time account for nor have I to the present moment a single idea of explanation  Notwithstanding I was thus unaccountably detached from a place my warm wishes and utmost endeavours were attached to I wrote intentionally for Mr  Weston  the  Panthe  nites  how that piece written in four days and sent into the world without a procured friend to support it succeeded is too recent a circumstance to repeat here I cannot help remarking on a ridiculous custom of  authors  reading their pieces to the performers this is giving a false consequence in general to the former and is making mere machines of the latter unless such instructors as Mr  Garrick  and Mr  Foote  step forth the former from his extreme intimacy with nature and from adequate power of expression must give useful striking ideas even to the happiest natural conceptions the latter having a very bold singular caricature imagination of character is indispensibly necessary for the exhibition of his  own  pieces but after all it is to be wished that the  instructed  did not catch up the  peculiarities  instead of the  beauties  of the  instructors  it may be advanced that an author best knows his own ideas I grant it intellectually but expressively makes a wide difference I have known some  write  very tolerably who could not read decently and I have heard parsons preach very good  borrowed  sermons who could not write a paragraph fit for a schoolboy's theme  The season before my separation from Mr  Foote  I was astonished by a most friendly line from Mr  Mossop  wishing to see me at an appointed hour at Forest's Coffeehouse Charingcross though so long at a distance I punctually and cheerfully attended he received me  like  and I hope as a friend talked of his theatre in  Dublin  asked my connection and salary with Mr  Foote  I gave him faithful information he sounded my inclination for  Dublin  in a theatrical capacity and suggested not only my assistance to raise recruits but to accept the stile of managerdepute I declined all but the recommendation of some performers and even there told him I supposed they would expect collateral security for payment of their salaries here the great man broke out in the syllabled utterance of the word  security  however I sent two of diligence and  merit to him warning them of his situation as I never chose nor ever will be a kidnapper in any shape his being arrested put an end to the negociation Two days before he got into  salva custodia  a circumstance I very sincerely lamented in a  tete a tete  I asked him why he did not close with one house or the other  here  he observed that Mrs  Yates  was the only theatrical lady who could play consonantly with him that she was then at  Coventgarden  and as there was a  particular  reason why he could not properly be where Mr  Colman  was manager the reason I don't chuse to  elate he was indifferent about engaging I then suggested his obtaining which he certainly might have done licence for six nights at Mr  Foote  's after the season by which I told him he might at least get l and if his original powers remained by presenting himself to public view might oblige the managers of either house to comply with his terms  Whether conscious of that natural inward decay I plainly saw or rather more plainly heard or whether through native pride he replied thus  "old schoolfellow and friend I would not appear at Mr  Foote  's theatre in  London  to clear l in the time you mention"  here is a great light thrown on character After the circumstance of his bankruptcy I saw him not but heard that he passed his time dependantly in the south of  France  dismal situation for a proud man when he returned here I know not nor did I know of his precipitate decline however of his penury and obscure death I painfully heard too soon Mr  Garrick  I am informed offered to bury him but an  uncle  most generously took that enormous task to himself Here we place to rest an actor of as great natural powers as ever graced the stage for tragedy and as great defects as ever cast a damp on merit even in that stileshall we in opposition to that charitable maxim  de mortuis nil nisi bonum  enter a little into private character as I wish to be done by myself so will I do in this case with truth and brevity  As a schoolboy he was diligent in study goodnatured and strictly honest but rather abstracted as a member of the college he was tolerably oeconomical free from debauchery and equally attentive as at school transplanted to the stage he almost instantaneously grew selfsufficient and arrogant having very little money to command before and rushing into what I may call a profusion for him he forgot not only h  s early friends but even himself was in short a Bashaw off as well as on the stage on coming to  London  his arrogance rather abated but success still cherished pride  As to his connections with the female sex I will say no more than this that at the age of eighteen he had as far as I could judge a just and generous idea of their influence but commencing  a great man he was intimidated at marriage fearing any invasion of lordly rule however by credible informa+tions he was a dupe to artful females especially an old noble lady in  Dublin  who used to make a tolerable audience for her  dear Harry  as she stiled him and after the play stripped him at her route of twice what her interest had procured thus starving actors were deprived of their salaries and the daped imperious manager was worn out of all circumstances  Of his management it may be said he never consulted any thing but self not so much for gain as selfish vanity from the whole it may be collected that he had original integrity strongly planted in his breast that he was by nature a gentleman by opportunity and assiduity a scholar by uncommon requisites a great actor and by particular failings a very reprehensible man I arde  tly wish to cast a veil over the dark shades but as I profess myself real  y an enthusiast of impartiality I cannot disguise or varnish that so little respect was paid by the theatrical word to such an ornament is a reproach to the communities of both houses save those who attended but he who lived rich in abilities went to the grave poor in commemoration very little cons  quence to the de  d but shameful to the living  Great  hings were proposed respecting the amiable worthy Dr  Goldsmith  but the great folks dropped off and he went to  his grave  to their disgrace silently as a common balladsinger after tu  s were at an end  Oh life what are thy strange variations the idol of to day either as a man of power or of genius when breath departs and that power or genius operates no more is neglected not only by the multitude but also by persons who plume themselves on superior or perhap inferior abilities this is an i  refragabl  proof that all worldly applause more than a man can conscientiously approve is contemptible and highly below sensible regard  Having left Mr  Mossop  in that final state of liberation from sublunary cares which we must all by one means or other reach I shall proceed to a general view of the  London stages  from my arrival in town six years ago to the present time  After ten years absence I found a most dreadful declension of  tragic  merit  comedy  indeed has not suffered so much I both  eard and judged without prejudice and grieved I was to find so little room for approbation most of the faults I had formerly discovered appeared now in an enlarged state and few ver  few of the beauties remained though it would be peevish criticism to deny Mr  Holland  and Mr  Powell  capital merit in some views yet it must be acknowledged  hat both were very confined the former should never have uttered a tender sentiment the latter should have been entirely limited to pathetic and generous characters Mr  Powell  's  Macbeth  was  boyish to the last degree and Mr  Holland  making love was totally preposterous yet were these two the main props of the stage in a variety of inconsistent lights death letting fall the curtain of mortality closed their scenes of action  What remained Mr  Garrick  ever excepted and Mr  Barry  also while he has half a leg to stand or hop onMr  Reddish  steps forth in  Alexander  when  Lysimachus  is as far as with credit to himself or justice to the public he should go in  that  play Mr  Smith  did every thing at the other house and every thing the same way Mr  Cantherley  another  capital  actor has figured away in  Hamlet  when  Laertes  would rather overload him Mr  Brereton  hasI won't mention for his sake what he has done Mr  Bensley  went to school or college as I have been informed with Mr  Colman  so of necessity must be as exquisite in acting as the late manager was  nd may be in writing to say truth absurd elevation has reduced very good second and third rate actors into miserable apologies for the first stile and drawn upon them frequent censures they might otherwise have reputably escaped  I promised to give some light into the  managerical  artifice in making actors so exceedingly ridiculous and metamorphosable an actor  really  capital is missed by the audience and therefore will have adequate terms without being under slavish subjection to the manager if therefore an hungry appetite for seeing plays however mangled prevails through the public and a man for seven or eight pounds per week is sent on to bungle through principal parts which properly sustained would deserve twice that sum so much is really or supposed to be saved besides a  stopgap  of this kind should he assume any importance is immediately removed because next ours may succeed him without any public complaint thus actors and audiences are brought effectually into the gripe of pattentees  Let us only view comparatively the cast of  one  play as I have seen it done the  Orphan Castalio  Mr  Barry Polydore  Mr  Sheridan Chamont  Mr  Garrick  the other viewoh lamentable  Castalio  Mr  Reddish Polydore  Mr  Cantherley Chamont  Mr  Brereton  after several instances nearly equal to this can complaint be unjust or censure cruel  It i  somewhat odd tha  female merit keeps much nearer its predecessors than that of the males M  s  Barry  Mrs  Yates  and Miss  Younge  in  tragedy  Mrs  Abington  herself  lone Mrs  Bul  el  y  Miss  Pope  Mrs  Mattocks  and Mrs  Green  in  comedy  with the excelle  t support of Mess  s  King  particularly  Woodward Shuter Weston Quick Dodd Parsons  n the soc  deserve a large share of approbation how could imagination accept even in most uncommon abilities such contraste transitions as follow one night we see Mr  Palmer  who has considerable merit properly applied exhibiting  Dionisyus  a blustering  tyrant the next  Brush  a coxcombly valet now  Tamerlane  a cool philosophical  declaimer  then  Wilding  a rhapsodical pert incoherent volatile young fellow observe Mr  Clinch  at  Coventgarden  one night stuck up for  Alexander  and the next stuck up for  Pylades  I grant the latter much more within his compass than the former this is annihilating the real talents of performers it is setting a waggonhorse to run a race and yoking a galloper into a cart  Let us suppose Mrs  Yates  put into comedy chambermaids and Miss  Pope  into tragedy heroines would not the former promote sleep and the latter laughter beyond doubtwhy then should the men be made butts of ridicule Mr  Reddish  kept from all violent passions might be extremely respectable Mr  Smith  more applied to comedy must be more pleasing and Mr  Palmer  freed from  umbling parts which he is apt to  overdo  might in his proper place be a theatrical ornament  Here a remark occursafter Mr  Mossop  quitted the English stage his original part of  Barbarossa  which he shone exceedingly in was supplied by Mr  Bransby  a worthy man and very decent actor in his road Mr  Mossop  with the consequence I have already mentioned asked an acquaintance in  Dublin  if he could think  "  who  was his  successor  in one of his principal parts"  receiving no answer he imperiously but satirically continued  "the  frigid Bransby  NOW  represents Barbarossa  "  incapable politicians have exposed themselves as ministers of state and why not actors vainly mistakenly or compulsively render themselves or be rendered pitiable and contemptible objects  I could point out a number of faults in decorum and enunciation but presuming I shall be deemed rather severe for saying so much as I have done I shall contract myself on these points and only observe that in respect of the former I have frequently and lately seen the side wings of a chamber continued three or four minutes through a grove a garden scene c I have seen gothic pillars leading to a summerhouse and wood wings to a hall I have observed attendant lords and ladies pay no more attention or respect to their principals than if they were merely leading puppets I have observed friends assist  Orestes  in his madness without a gleam of concern in their countenances and even pages neglect the trains of queens though spreading those royal ornaments is the only purpose they are sent on for and indeed necessary for a dignified display of figure  In point of enunciation the blunders are innumerable and as to emphasis the misapplication incredible take one instance for all from head to foot it is now become fashionable if the words  thou  or  thy  are uttered to mark them strongly without  any doubt of meaning as for instance our present tragedy orators in saying give me thy hand though no hand but one is meant childishly or rather pedantically pronounce  thy  hand  thou  art a villain this without comparison should be directly opposite thou art a  villain  but these and many other essentials are below the notice of all accomplished infallible performers who are as repugnant to the tickling of criticism as a country girl to the approaches of her lover in early hours of cour  ship  Action one most graceful and expletive ornament is almost totally neglected as to correctness a needless extravagant misplaced expansion of arms is substituted for that descriptive and impressive disposition of limbs which renders the meaning more obvious and delights the view if the wings of a paper kite an emblem of some arms on the stage did not move so invariably even they would be more diverting  Among the heroines a strange exertion of masculine gestures take places which though it may enforce expression destroys essential delicacy there is also a dreadful misapplication here such as pointing to the ground or depressing the hand when elevation of the heart or mind is expressed  Standing further back than where the curtain falls is another constant and very prejudicial error as in that situation the voice is devoured and the features are obscured nay sometimes rendered scarce distinguishable it is also very objectionable for those who do or apologize for capital parts to monopolize what they think the most favourable points of view thus a great man stands full fronted to the pit while another character perhaps of cons  quence is obliged to speak with his back three parts to the audience forming a picture rude and unsatisfactory characters too in general pay too little at  ention to each other male and female acquaintances in pit or boxes too often call off eyes that should be rivetted to the subject and business of the stage  I have freely and perhaps it will be thought severely as I have determined to sacrifice all other feelings at the shrine of truth exposed the lamentable declension of  capital  merit it behoves me to give some reason musical pieces have been a most detrimental alternative and pantomime with luxuriant scenery have nearly swallowed up all regard for intrinsic genius and smothered every generous useful sympathetic feeling  Before I quit this part of my subject a part disagreeably insisted on I think it a duty to congratulate the public the patentees and the performers that so dispassionate a regulator is appointed at  Coventgarden  as Mr  Hall  whose head and heart from particular knowledge I can farely pronounce capable of ornamenting any station except that of a politician there impartiality and liberal feelings are an obstacle I  sincerely wish for the credit of the stage that every performer either would or was obliged to keep so uniformly within their powers as this gentleman does I cannot be unreasonable enough to wish  every  son of the buskin to understand his author so well that never was nor can be  Of Mr  Garrick  's management the policy and success have been so long and so universally known that it will suffice as a proof of his generalship to say that he has often particularly of late gained conquests without many front rank men sorry are all true lovers of the  drama  that he has condescended to call upon as mercenaries or allies the patched coat wooden sword Fete Champetre c there is not a single article of that sort but renders capital acting merit unnecessary suffer a mourning friend of the stage to utter this lamentable truth with emphatic feeling  Mr  Foote  's institution extremely peculiar in its nature is scarce describable I believe he does not wish it so if in his temple of Momus local characters temporary sarcasms and biting witticisms enriched with caricature features and grimace will do the whole end is answered and indeed no place of public exhibition ever answered the purpose so well let me not here be supposed scanty or churl  sh of praise since according to my own opinion there is more wit satire sentiment and pleasantry in the comic productions in this swallow season theatre than either of the winter ones considering the quantity of matter produced  The  English Scots  and  Irish  stages viewed as to critical taste a very short opinion will let in sufficient light upon the whole  In  London  the audience are judicious forbearing and fond of catching beauties ready to make every allowance slow to find fault keen to seize all occasions of applause tardy to resentment yet treated properly easy to forgive they know best what is right and yet will soonest forgive what is wrong they are prone to the dignity but not the malevolence of criticism  In  Scotland  they well know bad performance and bear it with inconceivable sufferance in public yet are sure to remember it in private and if a public conviction generally takes place it is rigorously enforced the point of criticism in which they are most judicious is declamation here judgement holds a very nice scale and among them would sooner gain applause for a cool deliberate sentiment well delivered than for all the enthusiastic rants of  Lee  poured forth with force their idea of players in a private capacity has been much but justly vitiated by the misconduct of individuals who under public favour and great emoluments for that place have shamefully evaded the engagements of honesty I could name  particulars but wish to be excused however be it enough to say that those who should have preserved the stage from shame in that part of the world and had it most in their power have laboured most for its reprobation  As to the  Dublin stage  which has been a most excellent nursery for this metropolis a variety of storms has assailed it some owing to proud obstinate managers others to proud luxuriant managers and several to proud ignorant managers to say truth though they are excellent critics in the  Hibernian  metropolis yet the warmth of passion occasions unwarrantable prejudice and savage opposition support is equally violent and a stranger has exceeding fair hospitable play they as well as we here have been from vic  ssitudes and want of leading genius most miserably off for some seasons insomuch th  t not a performer has been thought worth importing but Mr  Lewis  who we freely admit a pleasant comediankeep him out of tragedy his and our good stars  The taste of  Bath  in and out of the theatre is frippery governed by coxcombly fashion people of consequence there think dramatic entertainments mere time

of the inhabitants going frequently to  Dublin  there is a capricious opinion prevails and they are rather to be t  ken with a Theatre Royal name than real merit without that very honourable addition there is much politeness  hospitality and friendship in this city but too much affectation in their criticism  York  is goodnaturedly dull audiences there are remarkable for fixing public regard on individuals whom they pronounce incomparable they are a kind of parents to such actors and maintain them from youth to grey hairs even against judgement private character much to the city's honour is

Mrs ROCHE  EMMELINE    RUELLE  Miss ATKINSON  SCENE LONDON  THE MODISH WIFE  ACT I  SCENE I  ENTER COLONEL PARAPET meeting FUSEE  HAVE you deliver'd the cards as I order'd  Fusee  Yes Sirbut the one for Lady Brainless could hardly gain admittance  Col  How so  Fusee  Why that formal cautious domestic Mr Timothy said he would introduce me to his master but that honour from a knowledge of Sir Barnaby I prudently declin'd  Col  For what reason  Fusee  Because Sir I have no great affection for bruised flesh or broken bones  Col  Ha ha ha a pretty fellow for a soldier truly to be afraid of a feeble old citizen  Fusee  Ah Sir you dont know the force and activity of his crabtree crutch besides this love silences every other consideration and runs us into as many hazards as wardo you forget our midnight adventure when the great tanyard dog eased your coat of a skirt and was very near pruning my body of a leg  Col  All the better as in war so in love dangers and difficulties beget glory and pleasure  Fusee  Very likely Sir but to hazard life and limb without hopes of a pension is to be mere knightserrant  Col  Patience and perseverance may gain a pen+sion beyond thy utmost wishes  Fusee  There Sir you speak to the purpose and I hope your honour wont think me the worse servant for having an eye to the main chance as every day shows us that interest rules all ranks from the general to the centinel from the dutchess to the chambermaid  Col  True and you have a right to all the favour I can show for rescuing me from those whisker'd hussars at Warbourgwhat think you therefore of being provided with a good wife  Fusee  And a good fortune too Sir  Col  Certainly suppose Sir Scrapeall's sister old mother Busy  Fusee  And a sad supposition too Sir I think for if she had lived in Scotland some century ago her looks would have brought her to the faggot for a witch  Col  What I suppose nothing will go down with you but the roses and lillies of youth don't you know numscull that beauty is one of the most fading and perishable commodities in the world now old Busy having received most of the injuries that time can do human nature will be as engaging at last as at first besides you need not fear a rival  Fusee  Really I believe not Sir unless the devil himself turns gallant  Col  Besides she has five hundred a year jointure  Fusee  Has she so Sir that makes a very great alteration why she is not half so disagreeable as she wasyour honour's humble servant is not so nice  but he can find roses and lillies in the solemn hue of old gold and the harmony of the spheres from chinking of guinea sbut Sir there's one rub still if I should make prize of this old crazy galleon I must try to keep her above water as the cargo is to sink with her if I could but keep the gold and send her to the bottom it would be making a good cruise of it  Col  I warrant she has an old chest that will afford good spoil and I have no doubt of your success  Fusee  Ah Sir I must be a dull scholar indeed not to have learned from you how to tickle female ears and the view of a snug retreat will make me encounter wrinkled cheeks sunk eyes toothless gums and grey hairs with as much alacrity as if youth and beauty were the prize  Col  On that will depend your successmother Sly shall prepare the way for a proper introduction  Fusee  But Sir there's another rub we had like to forgetyour honour knows that I have been forced to make some advances to Mrs Ruelle Lady Brainless's woman now what shall I do to quiet her she is a good friend and may be a bitter foe  Col  Well observed she is a necessary agent and must not be lost should she know you in your disguise you must have recourse to your old method of lying and if that won't prevail my purse shall produce some irresistable arguments she is a politic jade and seems to know the value of a few guineas extremely well  Fusee  Yes truly I believe she does Sir and tho' possessed of a nimble tongue can always be silent when interest tips her the wink  Col  Retire I see Sir CharlesI shall furnish you with necessary materials and full instruction after dinner  Exit Fusee  ENTER SIR CHARLES PRUDENT  Sir Char  Colonel goodmorrow is not my visit unfashionably early  Col  Not at all Sir Charles an agreeable companion can never come unseasonably save a wench in the case as to fashion she is a capricious jade and below the regard of a sensible man  Sir Char  How can that be when no body in general pays a stricter regard to her rules than my friend  Col  you must not imagine that every custom I conform to commands my approbation but as peculiarities however rational are rather offensive to the general eye why should a man render himself disagreeably wiser than his neighbours it is a peevish characteristic of age to idolize the modes of its youth for my part I think revolutions in taste necessary and cannot suppose that either the morals or understandings of mankind are injured by a social conformity  Sir Char  Most certainly they are not  Col  So far then I am the voluntary subject but never can become the slave of fashion  Sir Char  To be free Colonel does not this sensible compliance proceed chiefly from the influence of the ladies  Col  To confess the truth I believe it may and among us soldiers it is no more than duty by our commissions we are ranked under the banners of fame and beauty to render the cause of the former service and the dictates of the latter obedience  Sir Char  In which light you have happily distinguished yourself and if report speaks true the ladies have not prov'd insensible to your merit what fame may do  Col  Gives me very little concern she is an  empty airy glittering bubble  as the song says when  my country calls my best endeavours are at her service but for a mistress let me have warm flesh and blood lips to melt and eyes to fire the heart  Sir Char  Like those of Emmeline Fairlove  Col  Right my friend what were the glory of an Alexander to possession of such charms  Sir Char  A mere aerial phantoms but prithee Frank has that lady had the power to touch your heart in reality  Col  Touch why she has shot it through and through with Cupid's arrows made a perfect riddle of it and notwithstanding my love of freedom I begin to think that matrimony alone can work its cure  Sir Char  Ha ha ha what the gay gallant and universal lover Colonel Parapet monopolized by a single happy fair one after all my friend I am afraid that roving dissipated heart of thine will hardly bear limitation  Col  Why so Sir Charles when that limitation proceeds from choice gallantry is a pretty agreeable amusement for some years at a man's first entrance into life but like other light appendages of youth should give place to more serious enjoyments  Sir Char  So then you have at last determin'd to become a grave citylike fellow  Col  Not that neither a husband may have spirit without running at large and a wife gaiety without indiscretion  Sir Char  Dear Colonel you have perfectly expressed pressed my opinion should one happy day give Lady Charlotte to my arms and Emmeline to yours I have no more to ask of fortune  Col  Nor I but you my friend have much the nearer prospect however fortune favours the bold and having laid siege I am determined to carry on my operations with vigour could I but  secure the outworks I should have no doubt of the town  Sir Char  By the outworks I presume you mean Lady Brainless and the amiable Mrs Busy  Col  You are rightand sure no mortal had ever greater contrast's to deal with as to the former being young handsome sprightly and good natured it is not a disagreeable point to flatter her vanity but the old beldam is quite intolerable however I have warm hopes of getting her off my hands immediately  Sir Char  By what means  Col  That you shall know hereafterthe hour calls me at my agent's to sign some accounts if you'll take a place in my chariot and accompany me thither I shan't detain you above five minutes then I am yours as you please  Sir Char  With all my heart  Col  Allons  Exeunt  SCENE II  LADY CHARLOTTE meeting EMMELINE  L Charlo  Good morning to my dear Emmeline  Emme  Lady Charlotte your servant  L Charlo  Oh Emmy I begin to think quality a sad incumbrance so much ceremony such fatigue and so little society that inexhaustable spirits and very pliant reason are necessary to go through the whimsical round why last night now at Lady Ombre's route was I obliged to stay till the telltale sun rendered flambeaux unnecessary and had not your Colonel gallanted me most pleasantly I should have made a very humdrum pitiful figure  Emme  My Colonel  L Charlo  Nay nay don't change colour child every honest heart like yours speaks through the  eyes therefore you may as well confess but you are diffident and require help in these cases so let me say for you that Colonel Parapet is a pretty fellow  Emme  Dear Lady Charlotte your cordial regard commands my utmost confidence and obliges me to acknowledge I have always thought him a man of merit  L Charlo  Very well my dear and when a woman of sense in the single state allows a batchelor merit take my word for it love is not far off but I hope you have not betrayed your good opinion to his knowledge for the men like us Emmy grow vain upon being admired  Emme  I hope and believe no word or action has revealed my opinion  L Charlo  So much the better hope kept at a distance in the affairs of love causes a more eager pursuit there's my swain Sir Charles Prudent has paid his addresses to me these twelve months yet has arrived at no point of certainty nor do I know when he will notwithstanding he has an exalted place in my esteem  Emme  Your Ladyship's caution is the effect of good sense and I flatter myself with considerable advantage from so prudent an exampleoh I see my agreeable tutoress approaching  L Charlo  Mercy deliver us from the nauseous wretch  ENTER MRS BUSY  Mrs B  My dear Lady Charlotte your very obedient humble servant I profess it is such an age since I had the pleasure of seeing your Ladyship that I quite languish'd to salute you  L Charlo  You are

taste the Queen's caudle cope with dear Lady Charlotte tho' we see some good things in the citywhen Mr Alderman Busy was alive I never miss'd the ball on Lord Mayor's day and I danced with such an air that Mr Deputy Stiffrump always chose me for his partnerI might have been a Lady too if my husband had my spiritbut its no matter there are so many paltry creatures with titles now adays I give myself very little concern about it  L Charlo  You are certainly right madam it is better to deserve a title than to wear one without merit  Mrs B  Most infinitely politeI warrant your Ladyship hears a great deal of news at the court end of the town  L Charlo  Really madam I seldom bend my attention that way  Mrs B  No suprizing we in the city always love to know what stirringnow I talk of stirrings has your Ladyship heard that Sir John Rampant carried off sukey Tallow  akes  L Ch  rlo  Fulsome gossip    aside    no madam  Mrs B  Why I believe it has been in the news paper I d  nt love to speak ill

ovet  ttletattle scand Ilet other  nswer for themselvesbut one must hear  when things are talked ofah there are sad doings in the worldwould your Ladyship believe it a cousin of my own over the waybut I shant say all I know neither  L Charlo  You are perfectly right madam your humanity does not at all check my curiosity  Mrs B  Nay its no secret only one does not love to repeat such things butwellI could have as soon suspected myself never did she miss church of prayer days and twice of a Sunday yet for all this sanctity 'tis not a week since a gallant was foundas I live found in her bedchamber  L Charlo  Intolerable tormentor    aside    perhaps madam there may be more scandal than truth in the story  Mrs B  No no its true enoughI thought I saw something suspicious a long time past but I am good natured and think the best besides being a relation your Ladyship knows that  L Charlo  I must change the subject    aside    pray madam has Colonel Parapet visited here lately  Mrs B  Oh dear yeswe could not do without the Colonel he is here three or four times a week and is always pleased to say he finds more charms here then throughout the whole circle of his acquaintance besides oh he's a most engaging sensible manso grave so prudentnone of your feathersculled fops I assu  e your Ladyship the Colonel and I have many a  trate  a  trate  conversation as the French call it  L Charlo  I shall laugh in her ignorant face oh Emmeline comes happily to my relief    aside    ENTER EMMELINE  Emmi  Lady Charlotte my sister begs to see you at her toilette  L Charlo  I attend hermadam your humble servant  Mrs B  Dear Lady Charlotte your most obedient may I hope to see your Lad ship soon again  L Charlo  With the first conve  ience madam  Mrs B  I shall insist upon itI shall be quite unhappy till then as there is not a person upon earth I more respect than dear dear dear Lady Charlotte  L Charlo  You quite overwhelm me madam  Mrs B  Nothing equal to your ladyship's deserts  L Charlo  You oblige me to flybesides Lady Brainless expects me  Mrs B  Since we must part so soon I am your Ladyship's most obedient humble servant    curtsies after Lady Charlotte to the door    what a proud conceited piece of stuff it isdont you think so Emmeline  Emme  No really madam  Mrs B  That's so stange nowbecause madam has got some quality blood in her veins and wears some trinkumbob jewels there's nobody so good as her I warrant but for ought I know she is no better than her neighboursit is not for nothing that Sir Charles Prudent has dangled after her and a swarm of fellows besides but as the proverb says a blot's no blot till it is hit  Emme  Nay madam such innuendo's are too severe for the world allows Lady Charlotte wit beauty and virtue  Mrs B  The worldwhat world pray and how come you to know the world mind your needle child that becomes you better than to contradict your eldersher Ladyship I suppose would make you as great a rantipole as herself and bring fellows about you there's her virtue but I'll take care my brother shall look sharpgoorder a pen and ink to my chamber    Exit Emme    I'll  write to the Colonel such a dear man is not to be missed

happy time to my relief do you know that I have just now been in the condition of poor Androm  da on the point of being devour'd by a seamonster  Col  A seamonster madam  L Brain  Yes truly the polite brotherinlaw of my polite husband I assure you Colonel the brute threw me into a horrid palpitation  Col  I presume it was the person I met with Sir Scrapeall madam who talked somewhat of a rasher on the coals and a bucket of flip as he passed by  L Brain  The very same  Col  Truly an uncouth appearance to address to a Lady but perhaps madam his externals injure  conceal'd merit intrinsic value lies often hid under such rough outside  L Brain  Well Colonel I must say your good nature and delicacy are remarkable for reconciling inconsistencies and placing persons or things in the most amiable light But ColonelI have met a most melancholly accident since I saw yousure poor charmer is dead  Col  Indeed I am perfectly concern'd that your Ladyship should lose such an engaging little animal  L Brain  Ay Colonel you know and valued his amiable qualificationswell since his fate was inevitable it is some comfort to find such genteel sympathy in the breast of a friend but that care is not single Sir Scrapeall takes pains to mortify my concerns  Col  Truly madam I have often blamed fortune in private which could lavish such a profusion of beauty and merit as you are possessed of upon avarice and insensibility  L Brain  Oh Sir you are infinitely obliging  C  l  And have been sorry to think that your Ladyship should be exiled into a kind of matrimonial Siberia  L Brain  'Tis too true Colonel but you know my condition and charitably sooth it with agreeable conversation  Col  Rather say madam I do myself both honour and pleasure when I render you the smallest satisfaction  L Brain  Sir so refin'd a compliment would prove my inability of return but that my sisterinlaw's ap  r  ch saves me  Col  The devil  t does    as  de    L Brain  She will amuse you Colonel for some minutes while I give Ruell  directions about poor Charmer which done I shall return to assist you against the violence of a neverceasing tongue  Col  Madam you are particularly obliging    exit L Brain    I must endeavour to retreat tho' before she returns for it would be almost an impossibility to please such contrarieties at once and on Emmeline's account I must if possible keep fair with both  ENTER MRS BUSY  Mrs B  Colonel your most obedient humble servantI profess you are grown a great stranger methinks it is an age since your last visit and yet I believe it is but three days neither but expectation makes time long as the saying is and you have particular good wishes from this family I assure you Colonel  Col  It is the pride and pleasure of my heart madam to deserve them  Mrs B  Most elegantly expressedwas not that my sister left the room as I came in  Col  Yes madam it was her ladyship  Mrs B  Her Ladyship humph these feathers in the cap make people hold their heads so high forsooth but you and I Colonel know better  Col  Most certainly madam as you say titles are mere feathers  Mrs B  And pray now Colonel do you really think this sister of mine so fine a woman as the world says  Col  Really madam it is hard to say beauty is not universal and that which pleases one  ye palls upon another Lady Brainless is not without her attractions but I must confess there are charms in this house of milder steddier natu  which more powerfully command my approbation  Mrs B  Infinitely discreet I professah Colonel if every fine Gentleman was as prudent we should not have so many minx presume upon their dolldousy faces  Col  Very true madam  Mrs B  Good houswifery would then take place of rambling and cards and idle routes give way to the dear society of kind sober husbands  Col  And if all the fine ladies had such prudential notions as yours madam sense as well as passion must own their influence  Mrs B  How happy do I esteem myself Colonel that my notions so particular agree with yours I wish her Ladyship was here to be convinced I am not quite so ignorant as she is pleased to imagine  Col  Heav'n forbid till I am gone however  aside  Mrs B  And here she comes I professnow for it Colonel  Col  Would I were gone I shall most certainly disoblige one of them    aside    ENTER LADY BRAINLESS  L Brain  Well Colonel I have settled poor Charmer's funeral procession he's to be interred under a rose tree and I am to be chief mourner  Mrs B  Lord sister I am amazed you can be so unpolite as to trouble the Colonel with that little ugly creature  L Brain  Really madam I did not come into the city to learn politeness  Mrs B  If your Ladyship had perhaps you might have met some useful instructions  Col  So so now it begins    asi  e    Mrs B  And persons who would have informed you that prudence is preferable to all the finical airs of quality  L Brain  Prudenceha ha ha really madam you oblige me to trespass upon my present concern and laugh at your mechanical notions ha ha ha ha  Mr  B  Mechanical notionsif your Ladyship  is confident of your cause what if we refer ourselves to the Colonel  Col  Ay now it comes    aside    L Brain  You could not have proposed a more agreeable judge I know he must despise the wretch    aside    Col  Your ladyship's good opinion does me honour  Mrs B  Then madam we are both pleased for I know he'll be of my side    aside    L Brain  Now then Colonel please to let us know if you was to chuse a lady which you would have her polite or prudent according to our opinions of those terms  Col  Oons what shall I say    aside    undoubtedly madam politeness is one of the most agreeable qualifications of human nature  L Brain  What say you to that madam  Mrs B  But Colonel did not you say that a prudent behaviour was the most amiable  Col  Yeyeyes madam I did to be sure and I think so stillthat isI thinkbless me I'm afraid we shan't have time for the necessary disquisitionI was to have met Sir Charles Prudent and I find I have slip'd my time a quarter of an hourtherefore if you please some other opportunity    going      L Brain  No no Colonel you shall determine now  Mrs B  Ay ay positively you shan't go  Col  Then I must stand buff I find I'll try to confuse and so escape    aside    why then ladies since you insist upon it I shall endeavour to clear up the pointpolitenessay we'll consider that first politeness is a vivifying ray which animates and enlightens social intercourse facilitating expression harmonizing temper and regulating deportment as the natural sun influences and animates  the vegetable world so this beautous child of art polishes adorns and dignifies society  L Brain  Infinitely fanciful what think you now madam  Mrs B  Proceed Sir  Col  Prudence I take to be that kind and gentle moderator whom reason deputes to assist us against the impulse of irregular passions a cool friend an infallible guide to lead with safety through the labyrinth of life  Mrs B  And pray what does your ladyship think now  Col  Nay ladies I absolutely declare against any preeminence being throughly convinced that they are highly essential to each other by seeing them so happily united before me    bows to each of the ladies    L Brain  Delicately complaisanthis look gave me the preference    aside    Mrs B  Charming manhis eyes spoke in my favour    aside    ENTER RUELLE  Ruelle  Colonel one of your servants desires to speak with you  Col  In lucky time    aside    very well    Ruelle whispers Mrs Busy and gives her a letter    your Ladyship might observe I was cautious of putting the old Lady out of temper    to Lady Brainless    L Brain  I did observe and commend your humanity    Ruelle goes and whispers Lady Brainless    Col  I was obliged madam to favour her Ladyship's opinion somewhat to prevent appearing too particular    to Mrs Busy    Mrs B  Most engagingly discreetI perceived and admired your caution  exit Ruelle  Col  Ladies you find I am under a necessity of forcing myself from your agreeable company  going  L Brain  It's we Sir that are the sufferers  Mrs B  Yes Colonel 'tis we that are unhappy  Col  I wish I was gone    aside    oh ladies    going    L Brain  Your Ladyship may spare that trouble for I'll see the Colonel down stairs  Col  Heav'ns you overwhelm me ladies  Mrs B  I must and will wait upon you Colonel  L Brain  Consider madam you are the elder and not so fit to bear fatigue  Col  Nay then 'tis time to fly    exit Lady Brainless after him    Mrs B  The elder an impudent young minx to

be true that the outside of a man is mostly considered I am in a fair way of being as much respected as my betters so MonmouthStreet I thank thee for this gaudy title page I wish the volume of my brain like many modern pieces may not fall short of what is promisedif that should be the case  I shall be still the more like a fine gentleman and at worst may make a brazen front stand for the unfurnished inside that's some comfort however and has been the road to preferment of many an enterprising bladeSoft let me recollect my instructions for what is a military man without his plan of operationsFusee says my master I know women and he that courts a widow must throw aside modestyI know that too Sir says I for I have courted ah and married several of your honours oceasional widowsWell no matter for that Fusee this mother Busy must be taken off at all events she has received a letter to prepare her for your reception praise her beauty be very fond and the business is doneay and when it is done a hopeful bargain I shall have there will be no need of any death's head but her face I shall never see it in a morning but it will put me in mind of the other world and to say the truth I have not much inclination to think that way yet but damn it the hopes of plunder have made many a man run his head against cannon balls then why should I be afraid of a witch so most engaging glibtongued ancient Ladyhave at you  Exit Fusee  SCENE II  COLONEL PARAPET meeting SIR CHARLES  Col  Well met Sir Charleswhy this unusual anxiety in your countenance It is not philosophical I assure you  Sir Char  Nay Frank all our resolution natural and speculative must give way upon particular occasionsI am miserable  Col  Marry heaven forbidwhy man your acres are not swallowed up by an earthquake  Sir Char  Pshaw that were a trifleI could bear any thing calmly but the disappointment of my heartI fear Lady Charlotte has a tincture of that inconstancy which is charged against her sex in general  Col  How so whence your suspicion has she started a rival to amuse you  Sir Char  Not that I know of tho' I may fear itI was to have paid her a visit as this hour but calling at her house a servant told me she had set off for her brother's the Earl of Greenhill's two hours ago and that without leaving any apology or the slightest hint of return  Col  And this is the mighty source of care oh love love what a capricious deity are thou who can so turn our wits the seamy side without as Shakespeare has itPrithee my friend don't take trifles to heart this flight of Lady Charlotte's is only the whim of a fine lady who has the prerogative of custom to give herself as many affected and inconsistent airs as she pleases  Sir Char  Nay dear Colonel don't be too severe I can't think her good sense descends to so trifling a character as you mean by a fine Lady she has spirits without wildness goodnature without weakness dignity without affectation and humility without meanness therefore this unaccountable behaviour surprizes me the more  Col  Unaccountable behaviour not at all your gravity is an excellent subject for wit and vivacity to play uponcome come Sir Charles rest assured that he who so palpably devotes himself to a single object will be liable to such rubs I love one yet gallant half a dozen at a time had you taken the same course ten to one but her volat  le ladyship had long ere now flown into your arms upon the wings of jealousy  Sir Char  Well Frank I acknowledge your superiority  in the affairs of love what then would you advise upon the present case  Col  Faith Sir Charles there seems to be but a limited choice of proceedings you have an excellent set of nags and if you wish for an immediate ecclaircissement e'en pursue and tell her you won't be treated with such indifference for the future or rather take no notice of the matter 'till her ladyship chuses to come back which if I am any judge of woman she very shortly will  Sir Char  Your latter opinion shall guide me her servant mentioned the arrival of Lord Frederic Bloom her younger brother could I obtain an intimacy with him it might be useful  Col  Most certainly as you would thereby know the motions of the enemy  ENTER a SERVANT  Serv  Lord Frederic Bloom's compliments and this letter Sir  Col  Very well wait a momentLord Frederic's compliments this is somewhat odd as I never knew any of the family but Lady Charlotte eh what have we hereCharlotte Bloomsuppose this should be a loveletterupon my honour Sir Charles I never made any advances  Sir Char  Dear Colonel you have alarmed my curiosity and if the purport is not very particular your communication will oblige me  Col  Purportgad you shall have it allyou shall read it kiss it and take it as a relique for adoration if you willthere  Sir Char    Reads    "Sir meeting my brother Lord Frederic on the road and knowing after three years travel commenced upon his leaving the university that he must be rather deficient of acquaintance I have taken the liberty of introducing him to you as a gentleman highly  deserving his observation and regard Your most c Charlotte Bloom"  This may be a lucky hit for me Colonel  Col  Right Sir Charles my interest may be of some use as the lady honours me with so kind an opinionhere friendis his Lordship at Lady Charlotte's  Serv  He is Sir and desires to know what time will be most convenient for his Lordship to wait on you  Col  Oh my compliments and I'll save the trouble by waiting upon him immediately    Exit Servant    Well my friend I am a notable spy I assure you and if any thing falls in my way you may depend upon diligence  Sir Char  I can never doubt or repay your friendship but as I know your disposition I shall refer you to the delicate pleasure which results to a generous mind from goodnatured actionsI won't detain you from this visitwhen it is over shall I see you at my house  Col  You shall so adieubut harkee Charles in the mean time I desire for philosophy's sake that you'll sigh as little as you possibly can  Exeunt severally  ENTER LADY CHARLOTTE  dressed as Lord Frederic  and EMMELINE  Emme  Well Lady Charlotte there is somewhat so unexpected and so romantic in this metamorphose of yours that positively I can't help laughing even at the expence of good manners ha ha ha hayou'll excuse me  L Charlo  Excuse ha ha ha I'll laugh with you my dear I am never better pleased than when laughing at myself and certainly I was never a better subject for it than at presentbut come give me your opinion don't I make a tolerable  smart figure in this masculine outsidea little upon the coxcomb or soeh  Emme  Not at all you have a much better right to the title of a fine gentleman than many who claim itbut after all to what extraordinary purpose have you done this is it merely to torment poor Sir Charlesbless us what confusion the poor man seemed in on hearing you had left town so abruptly  L Charlo  Why ay I grant you Sir Charles has all the appearance of an Arcadian swain and I believe him sincere but this is only surmise and when all the happiness of life depends upon a single choice that one should certainly be well grounded my disguise is an endeavour at this and for my friend Emmeline's sake as well as my own  Emme  For my sake in what shape pray  L Charlo  In short child I want to see you a happy wife as well as myself and to be plain I have always imagined your Colonel to be as suspicious a piece of gallantry as any within the sphere of my observation now in this form I shall be able to sound the very bottom of his heart which is more than you could ever be able to do until it was perhaps too late  Emme  I have always thought myself under infinite obligations to dear Lady Charlotte's goodnature but this extraordinary instance of friendship makes gratitude blush for its poverty  L Charlo  Not at all Emmeline you would put on a pair of breeches to oblige me and then the account is ballanced  ENTER a SERVANT  Colonel Parapet to wait on your Lordship  L Charlo  Very wellconduct him up    Exit Servant    So his complaisance anticipates my intention of visiting him and I am glad of it for  if you'll step into my dressing room there you may hear how I play my part    Exit Emmeline    I hope this Colonel may stand proof for poor Emmeline's sake however at any rate 'fore knowledge is better than late repentance  ENTER COLONEL  Col  My Lord your most obedient humble servant  L Charlo  Colonel your servant I am extremely concerned to give you this trouble  Col  'Tis a pleasure my Lord to wait upon so near a relation to Lady Charlotte and I hope to merit the very favourable opinion her Ladyship has indulged me with  L Charlo  When there is so much prepossession as I feel a small share of attention must certainly effect that besides I know my sister is not apt to flatterbut come Colonel as I have been upon my travels these three years I must trespass upon you for some account of matters here at home  Col  Faith my Lord I imagine them to be just the same they always were and the uncharitable spirit of ridicule as prevalent among persons of different dispositions as ever scarce any thing spoken of but the follies and vices of our neighbours while the censors themselves are hourly committing greater enormities than those they stigmatize as to the polite and trading world the first are endeavouring to ruin each other at cards and horseracing and the latter are studying to overreach one another by deceitful bargains and papercurrency in short reputations and circumstances are a general prey for scandal and knavery to hunt through the world while poor honesty is thrown out of the chace  L Charlo  A very comfortable prospect truly but I presume Colonel you are more attached to  and better acquainted with the sphere of gallantry than any other  Col  Why my Lord it is part of a soldier's profession the indulgence of peace for his fatigues in war and it would be ungrateful to reject the blessing besides Mars and Venus should never be divorced for whatever may be said of glory's charms I believe there is more courage derived from the influence of corporeal beauty than from the love of fame nor can any better reason be offered why Britons are the bravest of men than that nature has blessed them with the fairest of women  L Charlo  The ladies are obliged to you Colonel and since we have touched upon them pray do you know Emmeline Fairlove Sir Scrapeall Brainless's ward  Col  Yes my Lord I have seen the lady very often  L Charlo  I am glad of it since I must presume you are a better judge of female merit than my sister but she has possessed me with so high an idea of the lady that I am in love with her before I see her  Col  The devil    aside    in love with her my Lord  L Charlo  Yes truly and if she answers the description my sister gave of her I really don't know how far I may go in the road to matrimony  Col  Confusion a rival and a Lord tooI must throw some rubs in the way if possible    aside    Matrimony ha ha ha I presume your Lordship will hardly drop so soon into a domestic life  L Charlo  Why 'tis somewhat early as you observe Colonel but beauty and merit joined are irresistable therefore I am quite impatient to hear your opinion and I don't doubt its being impartial as I flatter myself with your friendship  Emme    listening    Now for it  Col  Your question my Lord is somewhat peculiar however to be ingenuous I think the Lady might make a tolerable decent kind of a citizen's wife but I am afraid that quality would sit very aukwardly upon her  Emme  A very hopeful beginning truly  L Charlo  You surprize me Colonel  Col  Besides she lives in such a queer odd sort of a family that your Lordship would find any approaches very disagreeable unless there was a much greater share of beauty to reward your pains  Emme  Beyond bearing deceitful villain  L Charlo  So then she's not handsome  Col  But very middling I assure your Lordship  Emme  Perfidiousblind wretch  L Charlo  How could my sister be so egregiously mistaken  Col  So the bait will take I hope    aside    why my Lord I imagine Lady Charlotte's goodnature here got the better of her judgement I have heard her profess a strict friendship for Emmeline besides your Lordship knows that beauty is not a recommendation of one female to another  Emme  Still complimenting  L Charlo  Well Colonel as the case is so I shall just pay her a ceremonious visit to deliver my sister's letter  Col  Oons if he sees her all's over    aside    letter my Lord  L Charlo  Yes one of introductionif you will favour me with your company to her guardians Colonel I shall get away the sooner  Col  To her guardian'sto be sure my Lord you honour mebut then as I told your Lordship it is such a motley unaccountable family that you'll undoubtedly meet a very unpolite reception  L Charlo  Pray what are they who compose this extraordinary family  Col  Why my Lord there's the old knight made up of avarice jealousy and rudenesshis Lady Emmeline's sister a scatterbrained piece of inconsistent affectation  Emme  So so my sister has her share too  Col  And ha ha ha ha an old widow Sir Scrapeall's sister who fancy's herself a blooming beauty and torments every thing in breeches that goes near the house tho' she's more like an antiquated tapestry figure than any animal of the present age  L Charlo  Ha ha ha ha a most hopeful society indeed  Col  So that I believe if your Lordship would send Lady Charlotte's letter it would do better than a visit  L Charlo  Oh by no means for I promised to deliver it besides I love curiositiesI presume the citizen won't set his great dog at me as to any thing else I can enjoy it for oncehereget the chariot ready  Col  So I have been lying so long to no purpose this affair must end in a scrape I see    aside    L Charlo  Well Colonel shall I have the honour of your company to Sir Scrapeall's  Col  I must beg your Lordship's excuse I am to call upon Sir Charles Prudent about this hour  L Charlo  Sir Charles Prudentif I don't mistake I have heard of that gentleman's paying his addresses to my sister if he is seriously in love with her I pity him for she is now gone into the country upon a treaty of marriage  Col  A treaty of marriage  L Charlo  Yes and I believe it is entirely settled  Col  So here's comfort for my friend too    aside    my Lord I'll take my leave  L Charlo  Well Colonel I shall depend upon seeing you often  Col  Certainly my Lordbut it must not be as a rival    aside    L Charlo  Give me leave to wait on you Colonel  Col  'Tis needless ceremony my Lord  L Charlo  Nay I insist upon it  Exit  EMMELINE sola  False man how unguarded how credulous are we women to take in the poison of flatterythis discovery of his baseness unexpected and mortifying as it is I must esteem fortunate  ENTER LADY CHARLOTTE  Well Emily what think you of the Colonel now  Emme  Think why that he's like all men treacherous and base  L Charlo  Come child I see this trial has put your heart into a horrid palpitation but be comforted I entertain a better opinion of your favourite than I did  Emme  How Lady Charlotte after he could treat me so disrespectfully so rudely and in every article contradict what he has a thousand times vowed and swore to me  L Charlo  Come you must not judge unfavourably if I can read countenances right the thoughts of a rival alarm'd him more than a battery of cannon would  Emme  But what could be the cause of his treating me so lightly  L Charlo  A stroke of policy to secure you to himself 'tis very common in those affairs as well as those of love to affect an indifference for or  even to dispraise those things we like bestbut come I must be an assiduous lover of yours so make haste home that I may visit you in form keep good spirits and fear nothing  Emme  My lord your most obedient  L Char  Madam your devoted slavenay I must gallant you to your chair  Emme  Ha ha ha ha  Exeunt  ENTER SIR SCRAPEALL and TIMOTHY  Sir Scr  Four bottles of rum in punch already you astonish me Timothy  Tim  And well I may an like your worship but lackaday Sir

she have with him by the description he's neither a gamester nor a hornplantereh Timothy  Tim  Marry I believe not Sir but whatever the man is I fancy he's a little mad for when I opened the door the hinges creeking for want of oil he started thus  Sir Scr  Take care of my gout Timothy  Tim  Stared in my face wildly and cried hark  Hark how the grating hinges croak despair  Sir Scr  Hinges and despairmad indeed and what has such a creature to do here we are all mad enough without himeh Timothy  Tim  Ah Sir it was not so in my good old Lady's timeno such rantipoledoings we might  go to bed

body in your worship's service but you are a kind indulgent master and if my old mimimistress had livedI cacacant help weeping when I think of herohhh  Sir Scr  It is very true Timothy very true and

of the THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  SIR CHARLES and the COLONEL  DEAR Colonel this unexpected rival of yours adds to my own perplexity but from the idea I have of your mistress I think your happiness in no danger  Col  There it is every man thinks his own case worst mischief on it I am chiefly vexed that after such experience I should let any attachment have power to perplex mehowever I threw what objections I could in the way  Sir Char  How so  Col  Why I gave as unfavourable an idea as I could of the familynay went so far as to contradict my heart in regard of Emmeline's beauty and meritbut Sir Charles in my confusion I had forgot to tell you that Lady Charlotte's expedition into the country is upon a treaty of marriage  Sir Char  A treaty of marriage with who  Col  That his Lordship did not particularize but said the affair was settled  Sir Char  Sdeath it cannot be what after permitting my addresses with most engaging condescension after intimating I was not disagreeable to her and giving delicate hopes of a happy issue after all this to change without the smallest pretext of offence or assigning the slightest reason  Col  So my friend it appears at presentyou know the brother could not have any view and he mentioned it with a tender sense of your disappointment  Sir Charl  My disappointment he should rather have felt for his sister's most egregious falshood  if she has jilted me I'll expose her publickly  Col  I am afraid Sir Charles that revenge will light upon yourselffashion and spirit will only laugh at your sincere easy disposition  Sir Char  Shall I therefore tamely bear such an insult to my heart and affections if I can't prevent the match I'll at least render it as disagreeable as may be I'll take post for the Earl's tomorrow morning lay my previous claim before him upbraid her inconstancy and if the new lover should have spirit enough to appear convince him I am not that commodious passive utensil she would make of me  Col  I applaud your resolution and if you have any occasion for an auxiliary sword you know where to find it in the mean time I think you had better find Lord Frederic and receive fuller information from him besides if you can detain him for the evening it may be of singular service to me  Sir Char  The latter motive alone is sufficient to excite my diligence for rest assured dear Colonel that whatever my cross stars design for me I heartily wish your affairs may feel the influence of a propitious planet  Col  And be satisfied Sir Charles my happiness must be incomplete without yours therefore let us hope the best on both sides  Exeunt severally  RUELLE conducting FUSEE  Ruelle  Please to come this way Sir and Mrs Busy will wait on you immediately  Fusee  Very well I shall attend the lady's leisure child la la la    sings    Ruelle  What an impudent fellow is this    aside    your honour won't be angry if I ask a question  Fusee  No not at all my dear  Ruelle  Pray did your honour ever hear of a brother of mine one Thomas Ruelle a soldier  Fusee  No child nor was it at all likely I should unless he had been in my own company we officers seldom know any thing of the private but that they are men or look like such we who bear commissions are entirely among ourselves my dear la la la la    sings    Ruelle  Ha ha ha ha I can hold no longer well said captain Fusee why sirrah could you imagine that fine cloaths a bag wig and quality airs could hide that sweet gunpowder face from my knowledge  Fusee  Pox o'this discerning jade I shall infallibly be blown up    aside    Ruelle  Bless me Captain does your welltried assurance fail youpray what scheme what military trick is your honour upon in this disguise  Fusee  Since 'tis in vain to dissemble I'll e'en tell youmy master wanting to get the old lady of this house off his hands has put me into masquerade I have had but one conference and yet by the help of mother Sly want nothing but a parson to finish the affair  Ruelle  Mighty well and what then becomes of all your fine spun protestations to me Mr Saucebox  Fusee  Why you know Mrs Ruelle Pyramus and Thisbe never loved so well but you was allways throwing dependance and poverty in my teeth so I thought it high time to mend myself  Ruelle  A very fine comeoff indeed but I'll spoil your master's project and your's Mr Impudence I will and discover all this moment  Fusee  Nay dear Ruelle don't be so cruel as that neither  Ruelle  Dear Ruellenot so much familiarity puppy you and your master are a couple of deceitful  forsworn rakehells and ought to be exposed  Fusee  What will nothing pacify you nothing bridle that harmonious tongue  Ruelle  No wretchnot all the eloquence you have  Fusee  Why then let my master speakhe desired me to present his compliments and this  gives a purse  the first I had no scruple to give but the latter I thought to have saved  Ruelle  Very honest indeed noble captain and like the rest of your trickslet me seehum humten guineas why ah these are compliments worth receiving and shows the Colonel knows how to speak most feelinglyYet after all must I not only lose so sweet a swain but as I have read in some play be made myself the instrument must I not only die but plunge the dagger in my heart myself this is indeed refining on calamity  Fusee  Tender loving soulI never thought her so fond as thispoor pretty soft rogue let me kiss off thy tears  Ruelle  Tearsha ha ha ha not so foolish as that neither good Mr Captain and since your sincerity is brought to light I'll show you that I was prepared against it  Fusee  What does the jade mean  Ruelle  Mean why I mean there's a sea captain worth ten thousand pounds my master's brotherinlaw whose heart I have so engaged by helping him to some bowls of punch more than Sir Scrapeall allowed that he has given me several kind glances squeezed my hands almost to a jelly and sworn if I have a mind he'll get a parson to splice us together tomorrow morning  Fusee  Oh snap him by all means and when we have made the double match you and I can be on better terms than ever Mrs Ruelle  Ruelle  Stand off jackanapes and learn a proper distance to your bettersyou and your old madam must not put yourself on a footing with a real Captain's Lady for my messmate as he calls himself though he's but a scurvy original has the recommendation of a fine gilded frame to set him offI shall so gall madam Fusee by taking place of herfor I am resolved when once Mrs Starboard to hold my own to pay as many visits to wear as fine cloaths and have as grand a route as any city lady of them all  Fusee  Hoity toity what whirligigs fortune has planted in the wench's head already  Ruelle  Captain to your arms the General's at hand  Exit  Fusee  Sblood this mistress of mine has the same effect upon me that a labelled bottle has upon the stomach of a sick manbut I must take the dose to cure the consumptive state of my pockets  ENTER MRS BUSY  Captain your very most humble servant  Fusee  Madam your eternal slave  Mrs B  Lard Captain I am most infinitely concerned at the rudeness of having made you wait so long and scarce know how to apologize but my poor neighbour Mrs Dolefull who has a sad fellow of a husband came to consult me and would not let me stir  Fusee  Madam though your absence to me is worse than riding the wooden horse standing upon the picket being tied up to the halberts or even running the gantelope upon so goodnatured an occasion of delay as comforting a distressed neighbour I must be not only satisfied but pleased also at the beauty of your mind as much as I am captivated with the beauty of your person madam  Mrs B  Bless me  Sir  the force and delicacy of your compliment makes me blush I profess it doesyet who would ever trust a man after what my good friend Mrs Sly related of the Colonel  Fusee  Oh name him not madam the young fellow is indeed plausible enough but nothing of a soldier except the titlegood friends no merit and as to gallantry I know he makes it his business to boast of favours from the ladies  Mrs B  Nay Sir I defy him there he could never boast of favours from me but in an honourable wayI don't flaunt about with profligate young fellowsnoI act with discretionI have an unsullied character to supportay ayif some forward flirting minx's of the age would take half so much care of reputations as they do of complexions there would not be such wicked and sensual doings  Fusee  Very true madamravishing sentiments killing eyeslet me swear by the horrors of war that though I have had my hat taken off by a four and twenty pounder though my beard has been close singed by the flash of a cannon tho' my teeth have been picked with bayonets though a whole platoon of musquet balls has passed thro' my body and though I have been three times blown up on the forlorn hope yet never did my heart feel such palpitation as those charms have caused  Mrs B  Oh dear that's a most powerful impression well military gentlemen undergo great hardshipand I presume you are forced to kill people in your own defence Sir  Fusee  Certainly madamwhy now in the battle ofofpshaw pox I have been in so many I don't know which it wasbut this single arm demolished two French Marqui's four Counts  and above a dozen rank and file but such bloody deeds are at an end the promise of your fair hand madam has made me determine to throw up my commission  Mrs B  Obliging and tender to the last degree  Fusee  But I shan't quit the service of my country entirely I have a borough waiting for me and I believe I shall accept of itbut madam say when shall the special licence I have obtained take effect  Mrs B  You are so zealous Sir but since you are determined e'en when you please  Fusee  Tomorrow morning then my fair the chaplain of our regiment shall attend and I'll fly upon the wings of love to give you notice  Mrs B  Dear Sir you are so irresistably persuading I shall certainly attend your call  Fusee  Transporting sound  Mrs B  Bless me I hear somebody coming and I would keep all snug till things are done  Fusee  Madam your words plant silence on my lipsten thousand soft adieus  Mrs B  The same let me returnremember tomorrow  Exeunt severally  LADY BRAINLESS meeting the COLONEL  L Brain  Colonel you are welcome  Col  Your Ladyship's most obedientpray madam was not that Lord Frederic who parted from you just now  L Brain  The same Sir  Col  So then here's anticipation against me    aside    L Brain  I profess Colonel your coming has given me great pleasure I began to almost despair of you and my route would have been as insipid in your absence as a humdrum society of countryfolks set to cards in a winter's evening  Col  Your Ladyship does me particular honour  L Brain  Well after all this matrimony is a very sad thing Siberia I think you called it did not you Colonelnotwithstanding which my sister I believe will shortly travel to that desart climewell I hope she may find it a pleasanter spot than I have done  Col  Your sister madam  L Brain  Yes trulyLord Frederic tho' his first visit I find has hinted something that way and my sister seems to have no objection  Col  'Sdeath 'tis as I feared    aside    this is a very sudden affair indeed madam but perhaps the match may not be so agreeable to Sir Scrapeall and she can't marry without his consent  L Brain  That's true as you say Colonel but I believe his generous worship considers her as a saleable piece of goods and would be glad to make a profitable affair of his consent  Col  That hint may be of use to me    aside    I should hardly have supposed your Ladyship's sister capable of so precipitate a compliance  L Brain  Why its a little out of the common course but the impressions of love are lightningwinged and very variable in their flightwitness those tender expressions and the profusion of regard you have lavished upon me Colonel though any woman might be vain of the conquest yet I never sought it however I am really concerned you should be so much in love with me but what can I possibly do  Col  A hopeful theme for my perplexity    aside    I am much debtor to your Ladyship's humanity and must be content to sigh away my passion in absence  L Brain  Absence nay that looks like absolute despair and despair is a very sad thingI should grieve to be the cause of itcome who  knows Colonel my agreeable lord and master can't live always and when he's gone  Col  I wish I was gone with all my heart    aside    your Ladyship is so much in the right that hope tho' ever so distant beams cheering rays but if Lord Frederic should prevail and blast  L Brain  Lord Frederic why you know Colonel he addresses my sister  Col  True madamhe does soII mistook you'll excuse my confusion  L Brain  Poor man I protest I pity him I never saw him so much affected before but I can't help the bewitching power of my eyes    aside    nay Colonel be comforted within the bounds of honour you may command me  Col  I can't in the least doubt your Ladyship's goodness but ardent love is impatient of delay and fearful of defeat therefore if your sister should resolve to check my wishes and favour a rival  L Brain  My sisteryou don't imagine she shall direct my choice  Col  No madamI did not mean thatbut then in caseI say that if your Ladyshipa oons I don't know what to say  L Brain  I see my staying does but perplex him the morehumanity instructs me to withdraw that he may have time to recoverwell Colonel perhaps the company will compose your spirits and banish the train of impertinent thoughts which so busily intrude upon your quietI'll leave you with Lord Frederic till we sit down to cards and I must positively insist upon your being of my party  Exit  Col  Pox o'party cards and company every moment till I see Emmeline is torture  ENTER LADY CHARLOTTE  L Charlo  Well Colonel I must say you are a gentleman of very difficult taste for as I remember  you told me that Emmeline was very middling in point of beauty now I think her exquisite  y charming  Col  It may be so my Lord  L Charlo  may be sonay it is so Colonel I profess myself the Lady's champion my sword is devoted to her service as well as my heart and I shall esteem any insinuation against her charms as high treason against the queen of beauty  Col  Your Lordship is very rapturous upon the occasion and I don't doubt but your sword is as ready as you speak it however since matters are come so far I must take the liberty to inform you that the Lady does not stand in need of your knight errantry for I have professed my service which having been accepted I cannot now decline  L Charlo  Hey day why certainly we are got to cross purposes what a person of Colonel Parapet's taste interfere with such an odd family as this and devote himself to a young Lady who can only make a tolerable citizen's wife on whom quality would sit very aukwardly ha ha ha ha now I shall take the pains to polish this rough diamond  Col  Your Lordship is facetious but to dash your lordship's hopes know that a previous claim to the Lady's favour has been made by me and countenanced by her which I presume my Lord will put an end to your pretensions  L Charlo  Put an end to my pretensions as soon to my life Colonel  Col  If that be your resolution my Lord I know but of one decisionyou have in appearance an excellent sword and I cannot doubt either your Lordship's skill or courage in the use of it  L Charlo  A very rational method of argument truly right military logic and in regard of us young fellows may be salutary our constitutions are too sanguine and breathing a vain must be  useful so I shan't baulk your resolutioncome Sir    draws    Col  Spoke with the generous pleasantry of true courage and strict honour it will be some pleasure if I should fall to fall by so brave a hand  draws  L Charlo  Let me warn you Colonel to keep at a distance for there is not a man in England could stand long before me at close quarters  Col  You are particularly generous my Lord but I am prepared for all events  L Charlo  Very well Sircome on thenyet holdtwo points we have forgot it won't be so decent to throw the family into confusion with our private animosity and if in this combat the Lady's favourite which ever it is should fall the conqueror will have no cause for trumph so that being somewhat between hawk and buzzard I think the Lady should be consulted and if she declines an explanation we can but appeal to our swords at last  Col  True my Lord and on that footing let me have the honour to call myself your Lordship's friend  L Charlo  I cordially embrace your proposal and here the Lady comes most opportunely if you'll open the case you shall have all the justice imaginable  ENTER EMMELINE  Emme  Colonel your humble servant  Col  Madam your most obedientI am sorry there should be any occasion to desire an explanation of what for particular reasons I have endeavoured to conceal but his Lordship informing me of acl  he either has or intends to put in for your favour I am under the necessity madam of requesting that you will do justice to the previous right I assert  Emme  Right ColonelI protest you astonish me I am an entire stranger to the meaning of this formal address  Col  A stranger madam  Emme  Quite so I assure you Siryou talk of right and favour and justice but upon what cause and between what parties I really cannot conceive  Col  How madam  Emme  And if I did not having been used to the law 'tis very probable I might not be able to decide however the curiosity incident to my sex induces me to request an explanation  Col  I am thunderstruckis it possible madam you can need an explanation  L Charlo  Come come Colonel this affected surprise and these distant insinuations are unfair I'll deal more candidly and set the Lady right at oneeyou must know madam that happening to mention the impression your charms have made upon my heart this gentleman my friend declared that he had already preferred his addresses  Emme  What his addresses to me  L Char  Yes madam and that you had received them most favourably  Emme  Favourablyis it possible you could advance this Colonel  Col  Why madam did you not  L Charlo  So upon this supposition the colonel very kindly proposed his cutting my throat or my cutting his and if you had not appeared madam like the dove with the olive branch I know not what might have been the consequence for our resolutions seemed very terrible on both sides  Col  Your Lordship is very fanciful and merry but I am not in a mood of temper to bear sneers at present  L Charlo  Nay now Colonel you are quite  too severe that you'll neither allow me to love p  attle nor laugh ha ha ha ha  Col  Fire and fury  Emme  So so so now the mystery begins to clear up and I perceive that what appeared rudeness is merely the unhappy effects of frenzy  Col  Sdeath madam frenzy  Emm    Most certainly could any thing else have introduced such romantic chimaer  s my Lord  Col  Madam this affected ignorance of what you too well know may prove insincerity but cannot add to the reputation of candor and judgement choice is undoubtedly free but that choice once fixed does not admit of alteration without some material reason  Emme  Ay there Sir I entirely come in with your opinion had any such choice been made but I see you are quite too violent for argument therefore I think it will be most prudent to retire  Col  Hold madam  L Charlo  Nay no violence  Col  Sdeath Sir dare you interpose    draws    Emme  Ah    screams    L Charlo  Sheath your sword Colonel I shan't fight a lunatic positively  ENTER LADY BRAINLESS and MRS BUSY hastily  L Brain  Bless me what was the reason of that scream a sword drawnah I shall certainly faint  Mrs B  The Colonelmy blood boils at the fellow  Col  So I shall have the whole crew upon me    aside    L Brain  For heav'ns sake Emmeline what is the meaning of all this  Emme  Only the Colonel sister who because I  would not confess being in love with him very heroically intended to murther his Lordship  L Brain  What you in love with him  Emme  Yes truly and talks of having paid his addresses in form asserts they were favourably received and charges me with insincerity  L Brain  What were his professions to make a cat's paw of memy pride is hurt    aside    Mrs B  Ah have a care childhe's a most dangerous fellow he would have imposed upon me if he could  Col  Yes I shall have it now and soundly too    aside    L Brain  How Sir did you make love to my sister  Col  To your sister madam  Mrs B  Did not you sigh and vow and swear to me perjur'd wretch  Col  To you  L Brain  What was that your delicate taste  Mrs B  Where was your discretion  Col  Oons I had no discretion to run myself into such a  L Brain  Such a what Sir  Mrs B  Ay Sir such a what  Col  Why such such'sdeath no words can paint my condition  L Brain  Have not you attempted to asperse my sister  Mrs B  Did you not strive to delude me  L Charlo  I find you are a general lover Colonel ha ha ha ha  Col  And what then my Lord  L Brain  Why then you are a deceitful treacherous hypocrite  Mrs B  A base designing scurvy fellow  Col  I am infinitely obliged to you ladies  L Brain  You are an inveigler of hearts  Mrs B  A breaker of vows  L Brain  A vile betrayer  Mrs B  A monster of prey  Col  Mighty well mighty well truly I have brought myself to a fine pass here bubbled of my mistress jeer'd by a coxcomb baited like a bear by a couple ofwell ladies I hope your lungs may be the better for this breathing whatever my ears may have suffered for you madam who have so very short a memory or such a weathercock heart I have only to repent the knowledge of so much beauty and falshood his facetious Lordship I may meet in a fitter time and place    going    Mrs B  Hold hold Sir  Col  What for you to begin again 'sdeath I'd sooner stand at the mouth of a charged cannon with a lighted match at the touchhole  runs off  L Brain  Positively he shan't escape so easy  Exit  Mrs B  Easy no no he shall have t'other sasarara before he gets off  Exit  L Charlo  Ha ha ha ha let's follow and have a little more of it  Emme  With all my hearttho' I almost begin to pity him  Exeunt  ENTER STARBOARD RUELLE leading him  Ruelle  Bless me Sir have a careI'm afraid you'll fall  Starb  No no my little pilotyou

SCENE I  SIR CHARLES and the COLONEL  HA ha ha ha a pretty situation you had got into among the females however my discovery of the pretended Lord Frederic has occasioned a considerable revolution in your countenance Colonel  Col  Ay and in my heart too Sir Charles but I am impatient to know the method of your discovery  Sir Cha  Know then I went in search of Lord Frederic and being told he was gone to Lady Brainless's route I followed where I was so thoroughly mortified with an account of Lady Charlotte's marriage that to collect my spirits I retired and took a moonlight turn in the garden  Col  A proper place and fit season for melancholy reflection  Sir Cha  I had not been long there when her masquerading Ladyship and Emmeline came down a neighbouring walk enjoying aloud the perplexity they had given us encouraged by the subject I drew near and received conviction that your rival is no other than my mistress who concluded with remarking that she thought they had played upon us sufficiently  Col  Yes truly I think they have so long that I began to be most horridly out of tunebut  prithee what could be at the bottom of this Quixote scheme  Sir Cha  To gain some assurance of our sincerity which after laughing at us a little they seemed satisfied with  Col  Dear Sir Charles let me embrace you so prudent and spirited a design makes the little gipsies ten times dearer than everdid you let them know the discovery  Sir Cha  Not for the worldI hastened from the garden joined the company some minutes before them shook off all concern was unusually gay and gallanted Lady Betty Ombre so warmly that poor Lord Charles was in his turn utterly discontented  Col  Ha ha ha ha bravissimo that was turning the tables upon them with strict justice and I think it would not be amiss to have a little more of it  Sir Char  By all means I sought you for that purpose I am to call at Sir Scrapeall's this morning and would have you drop in occasionally for as the politicians play'd a double game into each others hands it is but fit we should return like for like  Col  With all my heart it will be notable revenge mischief on't had your discovery been made a little sooner it might have saved me five thousand pounds for ought I know  Sir Char  What mean you  Col  Why in the heat of my passion I went to the Knight made known my passion for Emmeline and offered half her fortune for his consent  Sir Char  Haa substantial compliment to the Lady Colonel but we must try to settle matters otherwisebut come the hour calls me to the citizen's I'll lead the van do you bring up the rear  Col  Fear not I am ever punctual to my orders  Exeunt  ENTER LADY CHARLOTTE and EMMELINE  Emme  Dear Lady Charlotte I am concerned to see your natural vivacity so much disconcerted by a slight supposition  L Charlo  Slight supposition alas Emmeline in your case you don't see with the eyes of love else you would put another construction upon Sir Charles's behaviour  Emme  I admit there was something extraordinary but the feelings he confessed when you told him of the intended marriage were strong and sincere the gaiety he afterwards assumed was if I judge right a slight veil occasionally thrown over a gloomy heart  L Brain  I can't think soforced spirits are easily seen through and such could never have carried him so far as to gallant that forward shallow piece of coquetry Lady Betty  Emme  There I must acknowledge he was somewhat mysterious  L Charlo  Would I had not taken this disguise though it has been so far useful as to prove the sincerity of your lover it has only purchased pain for meI cannot blame Sir Charlesthe fault is mineI have acted like a foolish boy who plays with and teizes a favourite bird till breaking bondage it takes wing never to be recalled dear friend what step shall I take  Emme  I would hope the best still you know by appointment he will soon be here sound him a little further and I dare believe he will yet fulfill my good opinion of him  L Charlo  I would indulge that hope but strong doubts press forward to exclude it  Emme  I see him coming and shall leave you to a private conference  Exit  ENTER SIR CHARLES  L Charlo  Sir Charles good morningI have according to promise prepared a letter for my sister Charlotte wherein I have enlarged upon your previous pretensions as much as possible  Sir Char  I am infinitely obliged to your Lordship but upon second thought I have determined not to offend Lady Charlotte by a visit  L Charlo  Your resolution so warmly urged is very soon changed Sir  Sir Char  Why my Lord upon cool deliberation I think it better not to proceed any further in the affair 'tis possible I might have interpreted the Lady's good nature too partially in my own favour and as freedom of choice is undoubtedly just it would be rude and cruel to interrupt her present scheme of happiness  L Charlo  You are of a very happy disposition Sir Charles that can so soon and so coolly reconcile an affair which seemed so interesting  Sir Cha  Yes my Lord I am tolerably philosophical in these matters besides to own the truth I had amongst other conversation talked so much of love to Lady Charlotte that I fancied our hearts engaged when there was nothing meant I believe but a little fashionable gallantry  L Charlo  Then all my fears are true    aside    but suppose Sir my sister's affection should have been seriously engaged  Sir Char  Nay my Lord she's too much a fine Lady to be in any danger that way  ENTER COLONEL  Colonel Parrapet your most humble servant  Col  Sir Charles yours my Lord I kiss your hand  L Char  Sir I don't think your behaviour and our last parting admit of such familiarity  Col  Nay my Lord I came on purpose to solicit pardon too free a glass had flustered my temper without the least intention of offence acknowledgement of error is I know sufficient to a man of honour but I must confess myself a little puzzled for an apology to this Lady  ENTER EMMELINE  Emme  Sir Charles your servantoh the Colonel may we hope that night and reflection Sir have given your thoughts a calm  Col  Most certainly madam and I hope your good nature will grant indulgence to unlimited confession especially as I am come to make all attonement possible by offering any assistance wh  ch may promote his Lordship's happiness and yours  L Charlo  So this swain is changed about too    aside    Emme  Your condescension is very forward Sir but I presume his Lordship can take care of his own happiness without your assistance  Col  Doubtless madambut if I could any way contribute  Emme  Oh Sir you are exceeding liberal and courtly in your professions and promises I can witness that  Col  How so madam for by your own declaration I never had the honour of promising or professing to you  Emme  'Tis no matter Sir but I believe if you had you are very capable of forswearing it  Col  Oh dear madam I am sorry you have so terrible an opinion of me but I perceive this subject grows too interestingadso I had almost forgot to tell you Sir Charles that I met Lady Betty Ombre just now and to use her own phrase she dies till she sees you  L Charlo  I shall go distracted    aside    Sir Char  Colonel I am obliged to you for delivering so kind a message and from so accomplished a Lady when your match with her sister Lady Frances is compleated of friends we shall become brothers  Emme  Confident faith  ess wretches    aside    Col  That will be double pleasure pray madam are you intimate with the family of the Ombre  s  Emme  I don't know I can't tellinsolent tormenting man    aside    Col  Your Lordship will be happy in an acquaintance thereSir Charles will introduce you and if your Lordship's choice was not already fixed upon this Lady there is a third sister who has a most bewitching pair of eyes  L Charlo  I can hold no longer  Sir Char  A very dangerous pair of sparklers indeed my Lord  L Charlo  Sir you are a villain  Emme  And Sir you are the worst of villains  Sir Char  Amazing  Col  Wonderful  Emme  Oh that I were a man for justice sake  L Charlo  And I too  Sir Char  And I toowhat self betrayed ha ha ha ha this is more than I expected and hastens the comedy to a conclusionwhat think you ladies have we ballanced the account of perplexity or not  L Charlo  Ladies  Emme  What do you mean Sir  Sir Char  Nay never look strange your scheme was well laid and had not chance directed me to a moonlight walk in the garden last night we might have continued food for mirth at the expence of our peace  Emme  I am glad its no worse    aside    L Charlo  I am so confus'd and so pleas'd I know not what to say    aside    Sir Char  The palpitation of our hearts will I hope ladies make this trespass on your patience appear excusable  L Charlo  Well gentlemen since it is in vain to deny I admit your discovery and cannot but acknowledge your treatment has been founded on strict justice  Col  Spoke with your usual candour and generosity lady Charlotte and hence let mutual confidence ensue as to you madam I have Sir Scrapeall's promise to make you mine  L Charlo  So so Here's counterworking was it fair to undermine me but pray how did you prevail upon the knight  Col  By the rhetoric of five thousand pounds that is offering to surrender half the Lady's fortune  Emme  Generous indeed  Col  And had it been twenty times as much I should have only thought it a fit sacrifice to so much merit  L Charlo  An excellent proof of disinterested love Colonelbut you are outbid for I proposed to take the Lady without any fortune at all and am to have the honest Citizen's written consent within  Col  Contemptible reptile  Sir Cha  Ha ha ha ha upon my honour Colonel you have been fairly outsoldiered beat at your own weapons  Emme  And poor I set up at auction to the best bidder  L Charlo  Ha ha ha even so Emmeline but all for the better I hopeoh I see Lady Brainless I have some business with her in my  Lordly capacity and shall beg of you to retire  Sir Cha  You command us madam  Exeunt Emme Sir Cha  and  Col  L Charlo  Now must I play a part severely kind in hopes of good effects your Ladyship's most obedient  ENTER LADY BRAINLESS  My Lord your humble servant  L Charlo  Your Ladyship had a bad run at cards last night  L Brain  Oh terrible my Lord it seemed as if fortune had determined to cross me  L Charlo  Were not such things common madam in matters of chance they would press hard upon patienceI think your Ladyship lost fifteen hundred pounds one thousand to me and five hundred to Lord Robert Whist  L Brain  Thereabouts I believe my Lord  L Charlo  I am sorry to urge your Ladyship but being myself a good deal out of cash at present and having a bill of eight hundred to pay this forenoon should be obliged to you for the trifle depending between us  L Brain  Really my Lord your demand takes me rather at a disadvantage  L Charl  You know madam it is not like the impertinent bill of a troublesome mechanic for work done or goods delivered it is a debt of honour and such you know takes place of all other payments among people of fashion  L Brain  That's very true my Lord and I would always act up to the fashion but inclination must give way where ability is totally wanting and though Sir Scrapeall deals in cash I am almost as bare as if he was not worth a single shilling  L Charl  If this be the case I find I ventured real against imaginary sums and must therefore be more cautious of my company  L Brain  Really my Lord there is much less politeness in that inuendo than I should have expected from a man of fashion  L Charlo  Politeness madam is very well upon particular occasions but in gaming there is no such thing we win of whom and when we can like death it cuts off all distinction of rank relations and friends and stakes must be paid or persons exposed but as your Ladyship is a fine woman matters should be made as easy as possible and if  L Brain  If what my Lord  L Charlo  I presume there could not be much love in your match with Sir ScrapeallI have conceived a passion give it suitable return and let the thousand pounds  L Brain  Insolent man no more what part of my conduct tho' perhaps ungarded could encourage so gross an insultgratify your malice expose the sum due and set me up the sport of laughing libertines I'll bear all patiently as the fruit and punishment of my own indiscretion secure in this pleasing reflection that tho' you publish my poverty you cannot taint my virtue  L Charlo  Come come madam Colonel Parapet would have received a gentler answer  L Brain  No my Lord there you are mistaken also for though that gentleman may have been allowed a particular intimacy and may have improved or misconstrued appearances he must be a consumate villain if ever he dropped a prejudicial insinuation for let me say to you to him and all the world that however I have dipped into follies the vices of life could never make me a proselyte  L Charlo  'Tis as I always thought dear Lady Brainless these just and noble sentiments force off false appearances and reveal me instead of a gaming  Lord your disinterested and inviolable friend Charlotte Bloom  L Brain  Lady Charlotte why then this disguise or why would friendship alarm such painful sensations  L Charlo  As to the motive of this appearance you shall know in due timewhy I have wounded your delicate feeling was to awaken a sense of what you justly call follies which have long obscured many valuable qualifications and subjected you to the reproach of several who have l  ss real merit but more external caution  L Brain  Dear Lady Charlotte I shall be ever debtor to your kind opinion and friendly design reflection tells me I have given too just cause for censure yet not without some plea of justification  L Charlo  I am certain of it your most disproportionate marriage if not an entire excuse is at least a powerful palliation  L Brain  Marriage there you have said all at once those who should have studied and judged better for my future happiness warmly urged the match young and unexperienced I was allured by the hopes of a title and unlimited command ever since I have been almost hourly rendered unhappy by the selfish and perverse temper of Sir Scrapeall which has occasioned me to despise and cross him in every particular and most of my extravagncies have been more calculated for killing time than any pleasurepity me dear Charlotte for I find my scheme of life widely different from what I wish and yet in self defence I am obliged to follow it when avarice jealousy and discord prevail at home peace must be sought abroad  L Charlo  I have no reason to doubt your friendship but tell me did the Colonel use any freedom with my character  L Charlo  No upon my honour what I hinted was from observation last night and repeated to alarm you tho' I sincerely believe you meant nothing  L Brain  Your interpretation my friend is kind and just I own my horrid situation made me fond of his engaging conversation and female vanity was flattered in some compliments he passed upon me nothing more I assure you and yet now I look back such gallant trifling is like sporting on the unstedfast margin of a lucid stream where while we admire the beautiful reflection in its liquid bosom one false step hurries us to certain destruction  L Charlo  Your similitude my friend is fancifully just but we are too grave Sir Charles the Colonel and Emmeline are but in the next room shall we join them and prattle away gloomy ideas  L Brain  Excuse me for the present dear Lady Charlotte the reflections you have awakened render my spirits unfit for conversation therefore give me leave to retirethink for me gentle friend and if any means can be found to free from or alleviate my bondage I promise that future conduct shall prove my errors the effect of disagreeable circumstances of a tormented but not a dishonest heart  Exit  L Charlo  How good a heart may inadvertently be led into unfavourable appearance  ENTER SIR CHARLES COLONEL and EMMELINE  Emme  Knowing your design Lady Charlotte I ventured to make these gentlemen ear witnesses of the work of reformation and they admire it vastly  L Charlo  I am glad of it and hope you will all join to set her Ladyship free  Col  Sdeath if there be no other method I'll chuck old cent per cent out of the window and  her  t liberty that way  L Charlo  Come come I hope to effect it by some less furious meansI'll slep to him for a few minutes  Exit  Sir Char  Heyday what have we here  Col  As I live mother Busy and my man Fusee married I hope  ENTER MRS BUSY and FUSEE  Mrs B  Sir Charles your most humble servant Emmeline how dost do child  Col  And pray madam why am I left out of the catalogue of compliments  Mrs B  You marry come up indeed I wonder you have assurance to look me in the face after such behaviour I should have been prettily off indeed if I had depended upon your fine speeches and palav'ringI should have been a fine laughing truly for all the coxcombs and gill flirts but I'd have you know Mr Colonel grown birds are not to be catched with chaff no no I saw through all your designs  Col  Designs madam what could you see but the most faithful the most ardent passion but I suppose you tax me with inconstancy to justify your own falshood and will give yourself away to blast all my hopes  Mrs B  Ah that wheedling tongue and that deceitful fa  e if my virtue had not been impregnable if I had not been as cold as ice to unlawful love I don't know what might have been the consequence but as I am not to be imposed upon I know the world and the difference of people Captain Spontoon my husband has heard your baseness  Col  How husbandah cruel fairare you then married  Mrs B  Yes truly Sirperhaps you thought I could not get a match but the Captain has discernment  you might have made your market Sir but now 'tis too late  Col  Then animosity aside I wish you joy with all my heart and hope Fusee may make you a good husband  Sir Char and Emme  Ha ha ha ha  Mrs B  Fusee and who's that pray  Col  A very honest fellow I assure you madam my servant that was and your lord and master that ishow long have you been a Captain Fusee  Fusee  Not much above four and twenty hours Sir  Sir Char Col and Emme  Ha ha ha ha  Mrs B  What can all this meanhow Sir are you no Captain  Fusee  No truly not at presentbut I will be one if you'll buy me a commission my charming dear  Mrs B  Buy you a halter my roguish dear  Sir Char Col and Emme  Ha ha ha ha  Mrs B  What am I tricked then has neighbour Sly imposied on me  Emme  Oh no madam you are not to be imposed uponyou know the world and the difference of people ha ha ha  Mrs B  Hold your tongue hussy must such a minx as you set up your face  Col  Nay good madam don't be in a passion it discomposes your beautya bride and frown oh fie  Sir Char and Emme  Ha ha ha ha  Mrs B  They provoke me so I don't know what to say or domarried to his servant well you are pleased to be mighty merry good folks but I am not the first that has been deceived nor sh  n't be the lastas for you Colonel I'll let your character be known and this fellow I can be revenged of at any time for if I throw myself into the river my jointure goes with me so there's tit for tat and bite for bite he he he  runs off  Col  Follow your Lady Fusee she'll come too when she can't help herself  Fusee  I'll do what I can Sir for sake of the money but if she should resolve upon a lover's leap e'en let her go for truly I begin to think her service will prove harder duty than the brown musket and sixpence a day  Exit  Col  Well madam I think her insolence to you is pretty well repaid  Emme  Thoroughly as I could wish  Sir Char  Nothing but strict justice on your own account for she was most abominably troublesome here comes Lady Charlotte and the Knight  ENTER SIR SCRAPEALL and LADY CHARLOTTE  Sir Scr  Well my Lord upon signing the paper I sent you to peruse you shall have my consent to marry her in writing  Col  Sir Scrapeall your very humble servant  Sir Scr  How my scarlet friend what shall I say to him    aside    your servant Sir  Col  Well Sir Scrapeall the young Lady agrees to your consent in my favour  Sir Scr  Consent Sir ay but  L Charlo  How Sir have you been in treaty with another  Sir Scr  In treaty  Col  Another▪ why Sir did not you promise me your consent on abating half the Lady's fortune  L Char  Nay Colonel but I abate the whole of her fortune  Emme  Hey day guardian have you set me up to public sale  Col  I shall depend upon your word Sir Scrapeall  L Charlo  And I shall positively insist upon my claim  Sir Scr  You are very peremptory gentlemen but  suppose I won't consent to either what thenas to you Colonel I don't think your fortune sufficient and for you my Lordkeep our bargain and you shall have my consent to run away with her to Scotland    aside    L Char  Ha ha ha

are not you a Lord then  L Charlo  No Sir but I am a Lady by courtesy  Sir Scr  What the mischief women turned into men I have long scrupled to believe my ears and now I shan't chuse to trust my eyeswell Colonel I shall consider your proposals  L Charlo  Nay Sir it shall be settled now anddraw this waynot only give your consent but the Lady's whole fortune or I'll make you repent it  Sir Scr

the titledirections for John Ringbolt master of the ship Peggy to run her ashore she being insured at treble value  Sir Scr  Oh that blundering dog my clerk  aside  well Colonel since I believe you'll make the girl a good husband and she is willing I shall give my consent  L Charlo  Ay Sir but it must be done in due form and now as your Lady has many just causes of complaint to prevent the trouble

fortune with her  Sir Scra  No no I did not say that neither  L Charlo  What I must consult the insurers must I    aside    Sir Scra  Ohhhno I'll do what you have a mind  L Charlo  Well gentlemen and

anxiety in the pursuit  Col  But will in the hands of these ladies more than repay it all for how pleasing soever the irregular sallies of dissipation may be I doubt not but we shall be perfectly and happily convinced  That human kind no equal bliss can prove  To the chaste raptures of connubial love  FINIS
