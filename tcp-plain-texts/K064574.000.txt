 A SIXTH DISCOURSE ON THE MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR  In VIEW of the Present Controversy between INFIDELS and APOSTATES  Jamque Opus exegi  By THO WOOLSTON B D sometime Fellow of  SidneyCollege  in  Cambridge  LONDON Printed for the Author and Sold by him next door to the  Star  in  Aldermanbury  and by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price One Shilling  TO THE Right Reverend Father in GOD  JOHN  Lord Bishop of Oxford  MY LORD  _WHEN the following  Discourse  was finish'd and ready for the  Press  I consider'd to what  Bishop  the  Dedication  of it would be most acceptable for I am resolv'd that none but  Bishops  as yet shall have the Honour of my  Dedications  and  I had not long ponder'd upon the Matter before I hit upon your  Lordship  who must needs be pleas'd with this  Discourse  because of the Advantage that you as well as myself in the End will reap by it  By Virtue of your  Professorship  at  Oxford  you  My Lord  are a  Moderator  at theological Disputations as I am here And whether the Execution of your Office be as troublesome as mine is I know not But if the Design of this  Discourse  take Place we shall find that modern Controversies about Religion are all vain and thereupon be  both  of us soon eas'd of the Trouble of our  Moderations  at them  It may be  my Lord  you are not so weary of your  Moderatorship  as I am Besides that you are better paid for your Pains your Disputants are more amicable and in the midst of their Disputes more  tractable Tho they may warmly contend at the present for and against the Point in Debate yet like  Lawyers  who are no less zealous for their  Clients  in the Day they commonly agree to drink a Bottle together at Night and go to Bed good Friends And this is very well done of them  But my Disputants  my Lord  call'd  Infidels  and  Apostates  at whose Controversy I have the Trouble by the Appointment of the Fathers to preside are more stubborn turbulent and refractory What ill Treatment they would give each other if it was in their Power I know not But my  Apostates  since they can't be aveng'd on their Adversarys are full of Resentment against their  Moderator  because I am not altogether partial to their side and how I shall escape their Indignation God alone knows  Whatever the  Clergy    my Lord  whom I dignify with the Title of  Apostates  may think I look upon myself as a notable  Moderator  of the Controversy I have shewn them all the Favour I can in it and would have brought them off with Honor but for a  little Flaw  here discover'd in the Foundation of their Church which for the Determination of our Disputes must be confefs'd and granted  If your  Lordship  upon reading this  Discourse  should be of the same Mind with me I beg of you to Stroak the  Clergy  into Temper Patience and Compliance Tell them they have been long orthodox and glorious Victors over  Infidels  and that it would be now an Act of Generosity to yield to them in a  small Point  upon which such a Pacification would ensue as nothing hereafter would be able to dissolve  But I have another Favour  my Lord  here to crave of you that you wou  d be pleas'd to persuade my old Friend the  Bishop  of  London  to stay at Home this  Lent  and keep to his  Prayers  and  Fasting  for the casting out a certain  Kind  of that by fits he's unhappily troubled with or upon the  ublication of this  Discourse  I shall be in Danger of being soon kn  pp'd for it  If your  Lordship  will do me that Favour then I will do you as good a Turn and praise you for your Doctrine of  Passive Obedience  preach'd at the Coronation Tho many may laugh at your Revival of that Doctrine Saying the  Clergy  upon an Occasion which our most excellent  Sovereign  will never give them would again have Recourse to their  Reserves  and  Distinctions  yet I say it was well done of your  Lordship  to preach it that the Tongues  and the Hands to Say nothing of the Hearts of the  Clergy  might go together in Subscriptions to  Articles  and  Homilys  and so avoid that Prevarication and Inconsistency which some now have no more Wit than to charge them with  So not questioning your  Lordship  's Approbation of this  Discourse  and the  Dedication  nor doubting but you'll make me as bountiful a Recompence for it as any of my other Episcopal Patrons have done I subscribe my self  Feb th  My Lord  The Admirer of your Passive Obedience Sermon  Thomas Woolston  A SIXTH DISCOURSE ON THE MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR  c  _HERE goes my sixth and last  Discourse  on  Jesus  's  Miracles  the Subject whereof is the literal Story of his own Resurrection which according to the Proposition in hand I am to show to consist of Absurditys Improbabilitys and Incredibilitys And I hope our  Bishops  will quietly permit the Publication of this  Discourse  especially  if I assure them that I mean nothing worse by it than to make way for the Understanding what the Fathers write of the mystical Resurrection of  Jesus  out of the Grave of the Letter of the Law and the Prophets of which mystical Resurrection of our  spiritual Jesus  the Evangelical Story of the Resurrection of a  carnal Christ  is but mere Type and Shadow  I am so far from designing any Service to Infidelity by this  Discourse  that I aim at the Accomplishment of some of St  John  's Apocalyptical Visions The Fathers say that a  Church  built on the Letter of the Scriptures particularly on the Letter of  Jesus  's Miracles is  Babylon  and that antiliteral Arguments and mystical Interpretations will be the downfal of her Whether there is any Truth in this Opinion of the Fathers I am minded to make the Experiment and tho I should bring the old House of the Church over my Head and be crush'd to Pieces in its Ruins I can't forbear it But however I would advise the  Clergy  to make haste and  come out of Babylon  for fear of the worst or they who upon the Authority of the Fathers are  the Merchants of Babylon  will  weep  Revelations Ch xviii  and mourn  upon her  Fall because  none will buy their Merchandize  of the Letter  any more  Dear  Jesu  that such a  Student  as I am in the  Revelations  of St  John  and an Interpreter of them too upon the Authority of the Fathers should be charg'd with Blasphemy and Infidelity  So to Work I went and I had not been long musing by myself how to sap this Foundation of the Church before I was sensible of my own Insufficiency for it Whereupon I sent to my old Friend the  Jewish Rabbi  for his Thoughts on this grand Miracle of  Jesus  's Resurrection which he gave me some Promise of But I desired him to forbear all Ludicrousness Satire and Banter for fear of Offence For tho our  Clergy  liked Volumes of Jests and Facetiousness if they were discharg'd against  Jews    Turks  and  Infidels  yet when they were levell'd at  Ministers  of the  Letter  the  Case was alter'd  as quoth  Plowden  and they were not to be born with Therefore he was to remember that decency seriousness and calmness of Argument required by the  Bishop  of  London  In his Pastoral Letter p  or I durst not print it  In Compliance with my Desires he sent me the following Letter which having  purg'd it of a few  Puns  and  Cunundrums  because all Appearance of  Wit  as of  Evil  was to be abstain'd from I here publish and it runs thus  SIR  ACcording to your Request I here send you my Thoughts on  Jesus  's Resurrection in which I shall be shorter than I would be because of the customary Bounds of your  Discourse  The Controversy between us  Jews  and you  Christians  about the  Messiah  has hitherto been of a diffusive Nature But as the subject of  this  is the Resurrection of your  Jesus  so by my Consent we'll now reduce the Controversy to a narrow Compass and let it turn entirely on this grand Miracle and Article of your Faith If your  Divines  can prove  Jesus  's Resurrection against the following Objections then I will acknowledge him to be the  Messiab  and will turn Chtistian otherwise he must still pass with us for an Impostor and false Prophet  I have often lamented the Loss of such Writings which our  Ancestors  unquestionably dispers'd against  Jesus  because of the cl  ar fight they would give us into the Cheat and Imposture of his Religion  But I rejoice and thank God there is little or no want of them to the Point in Hand For I had not long meditated on the Story of  Jesus  's Resurrection as your  Evangelists  have related it but I plainly discern'd it to be the most notorious and monstrous Imposture that ever was put upon Mankind And if you please to attend to my following Arguments which require no depth of Judgment and Capacity to apprehend I am persuaded that you and every one disinterested will be of the same Mind too  To overthrow and confute the Story of this monstrous and incredible Miracle I was thinking once to premise an Argument of the Justice of the Sentence denounc'd against and executed upon  Jesus  who was so far from being the innocent Person you Christians would make of him that as may easily be proved he was so grand a  Deceiver    Impostor  and  Malefactor  as no Punishment could be too great for him But this Argument which I reserve against a Day of perfect Liberty to publish by itself in Defence of the Honour and Justice of our  Ancestors  would be too long for the Compass of this Letter and therefore I pass it by tho it would give Force to my following Objections it being hard and even impossible to imagine  that God would vouchsafe the Favour of a miraculous Resurrection to one who for his Crimes deservedly suffer'd and underwent Death  But waveing I say that Argument for the present which of itself would be enough to prejudice a reasonable Man against the Belief of  Jesus  's Resurrection I will allow  Jesus  to have been a much better Man than I believe him to have been or as good a one in Morals as your Divines do suppose him and will only consider the Circumstances of the Evangelical Story of his Resurrection from which if I don't prove it to have been the most barefac'd Imposture that ever was put upon the World I deserve for the Vanity of this Attempt a much worse Punishment than he for his Frauds endured  I have sometimes wonder'd considering the Nature and Heinousness of  Jesus  's Faults for which he dy'd that our  Chief Priests  and  Pharisees  had any regard to his Prediction which was so like a Bambouzlement of the Populace that he was to rise again the  third Day  after his Crucifixion There's no other Nation in the World which would not have slighted such a vain Prognostication of a known Impostor Let him foretel with ever so much Confidence  his speedy return to Life I dare say any other Magistrates of ordinary Prudence would have despised him for a presumptuous  Enthusiast  But when I reflected on the Imposture of  Lazarus  's Resurrection and of what pernicious Consequence it had like to have proved to the Peace and Welfare of our Nation if it had not been happily discover'd my Wonder here ceas'd and I as much admire now the Wisdom Caution and Circumspection of our  Chief Priests  against all possible Fraud and Deceit in the foretold Resurrection of  Jesus  Tho  Jesus  himself the Head of the Confederacy and prime Projector of the design'd Cheat in the Case of  Lazarus  was cut off yet his Associates were still numerous and it was not impossible but they might concert a Project of a counterfeited Resurrection of him in Accomplishment of his Prophecy that might be of more fatal Consequence and tend to such Confusions and Distractions among the People as would not be soon quell'd and quieted Whereupon our  Chief Priests  very prudently consider of Precautions against Cheat here and wisely make Application to  Pilat  the  Governor  that proper and effectual Measures may be taken against a false and feign'd Resurrection for Fear of the ill Effects of it  And one of them as the  Spokesman  of their Company seems according to  Matthew  Ch xxvii to have made the Speech following  SIR  We remember that this Deceiver and Impostor  Jesus  who was yesterday crucified and justly suffer'd Death for his Blasphemy and many Delusions of the People that were of bad Consequence and might have been of much worse if he had not been timely brought to condign Punishment said repeatedly before that notwithstanding the Death he was to undergo he should rise again to Life the  third Day  after It is not that we are at all apprehensive of such a wonderful and miraculous Event which knowing him to have been a false Prophet as well as a deceitful Juggler we have no Fears nor Belief of But as it is not long since that the Inhabitants in and about  Bethany  had like to have been fatally deluded and imposed on by him in the pretended Resuscitation of  Lazarus  one of his Disciples and Confederates in Iniquity so it is not altogether impossible nor improbable bat his Disciples and Accomplices who are many may project a feign'd Resurrection of  Jesus  in  Accomplishment of his Prediction by stealing his Body away and pretending he is risen from the dead Should such a ShamMiracle be contrived amongst them and cunningly executed it would be    not an Error but  an Imposture of worse Consequence to our Nation and Religion than the former in  Lazarus  could have been if it had never been detected We crave therefore the Favour of your  Excellency  to give Command for the making his Sepulchre sure till the  third Day  is past that neither his  dead  Body may be taken away and a Resurrection pretended nor a  living  one slipt into its Place and a Miracle counterfeited on that Day when we will be present at the opening of the Sepulchre and give Satisfaction to the People of his being a false Prophet  Whether  Pilat  was at all intent on the Prevention of Fraud in this Case or would not willingly have connived at it to increase the Divisions and Distractions of our then unhappy Nation may be question'd But the Request of our  Chief Priests  was so reasonable and their Importunitys so urgent that he could not resist them and therefore order'd them a  Watch  for the  Sepulchre which they might make as sure as they could against Fraud and Imposture till the  third Day  Whereupon our  Chief Priests  deliberate what measures were fittest to be taken to this Purpose And as I can't and don't believe any Man else can devise any better for the security of the Sepulchre against Fraud than what they took so I admire and applaud their Prudence Circumspection and Precaution in the Case They  seal'd the Stone  at the mouth of the Sepulchre and placed a Guard of Soldiers about it which were  Two  such certain means for the Prevention or Detection of Cheat in a Resurrection as are not to be equall'd by any other  They  seal'd the Stone  of the Sepulchre which tho it was no Security at all against Violence yet was an absolute one against Fraud How the  Stone  which fitted the Mouth of the Sepulchre as a Door do's the Entrance into a Room was seal'd I need not describe The use and manner of sealing of Doors of Closets of Chests and of Papers is common and as it is an obvious Expedient for the Satisfaction of the Signators against Deceit so it has been an antient as well as a modern Practice  Nebuchadnezzar  Daniel Cap vi  seal'd the Door of the Den of Lions wherein  Daniel  was cast with his own Signet And wherefore did He so For the Satisfaction of himself and of his Courtiers when he came again to open and compare the Signature with his Signet that no Art nor Artifice hid been used for the Preservation of  Daniel  So our  Chief Priests  seal'd the Stone of  Jesus  's Sepulchre which they design'd to be present at the opening of on the  third Day  the Time appointed by  Jesus  for his Resurrection and then give ample Satisfaction to the People that there was a real or could be no Resurrection of his Body Wherefore else did they  seal  the Stone of his Sepulchre  Your  Grotius  Adducor ut credam Pilati Annulo et hunc Lapidem signatum  In Loc Matt  thinks that  Pilat  's Seal was affix'd to the Stone of the Sepulchre but as I believe  Pilat  little concern'd himself about the Prevention of Deceit here so I much question it It is more reasonable to think that the  Chief Priests  and other Civil Magistrates of  Jerusalem  with their several Seals which could not be open'd but by themselves without suspicion of Fraud sign'd the  Stone and intended to be present on the Day appointed at the opening of the Sepulchre not doubting what no body could question but  Jesus  would wait their coming and arise to Life if he could in the sight of themselves and of a vast Concourse of People that were sure to attend on them to behold the Miracle Such a Resurrection would have been of Satisfaction to the whole Nation and such a Resurrection reasonably speaking  Jesus  would if he could have vouchsafed in Accommodation to the  sealing  of the  Stone  But notwithstanding this Precaution in sealing of the Stone the best that could be taken against Fraud  Jesus  's Body was privately slipt off early in the Morning of the Day before and a Resurrection pretended by his Disciples and you would have us and our Ancestors to believe there was no Deceit in the Case tho confessedly none of the  Sealers  of the Sepulchre were present Who can believe it Was or can there be any Imposture more against Sense and Reason palm'd upon the Understandings of Mankind If there had been a real Resurrection the  Sealers  of the  Stone  would have  been the  Openers  of the Sepulchre wherefore else was the  Stone seal'd    A Question that here arises is On what Day and what Time of the Day did our  Chief Priests  the Sealers of the Stone expect what they could not think would ever come to pass  Jesus  's Resurrection Or what was the Extent of the Time meant by  Jesus  when he said that after  three Days  or on the  third Day  after his Passion he should rise again if any Impostor or Prophet like  Jesus  should in this Age so predict his Resurrection and be executed on a  Fryday  the Day for his Resurrection would be presumed to be  Monday  and not  Sunday  Morning before Day And I humbly conceive former Ages and Nations and our Nation in particular did compute after this Fashion Accordingly on  Monday  our  Chief Priests  I don't doubt intended to be present at the opening of the Seals of the Sepulchre and to behold the Miracle But  Jesus  's Body was clandestinely moved off early on  Sunday  the Day before  that  signified and predicted for his Resurrection to the Laughter more than to the surprize of our Ancestors at the Notoriety of the Fraud committed and at the Vanity of a Resurrection pretended upon it And I may  appeal even to your  Chief Priests  of the Church whether here's not another Note of Cheat and Imposture and whether the Disciples were not afraid to trust  Jesus  's Body it's full time in the Grave because of the greater Difficulty to carry it off afterwards and pretend a Resurrection upon it  But because your  Divines  who have singular Knacks at making two Nights and a full Day that  Jesus  was buried to be  three Days  and  three Nights  and whose various Ways of Computation I always smile at do assert that  Sunday  was the  third Day  on which in Accomplishment of  Jonah  's Prophecy and of his own Prediction he was to rise again I will suppose so with them and will if they please grant that our  Chief Priests  the  Sealers  of the Sepulchre expected his Resurrection on that Day and intended for the opening of the Seals to be present at it  But at what Time of Day were they to come or could be expected at the Sepulchre Not long before Noon But  Jesus  's Body was gone betimes in the Morning before our  Chief Priests  could be out of their Beds and a barefaced Infringment of the Seals of the Sepulchre was made against the Laws of Honour and  Honesty and a Resurrection confidently talk'd of by the Disciples and yet your Christian Priesthood at this Day would have us to believe there was no Fraud and Deceit in all this O most monstrous  If our  Chief Priests  had trespass'd upon  Jesus  's Patience and would not attend at the Sepulchre for the opening of the Seals on the Day and Time appointed if they hid been for confining him longer in the Grave than was meet according to Prophecy then his Resurrection without their Presence had been excusable and justifiable But this his pretended Rising to Life not only a Day before the Chief Priests could imagine he would or earlier in the Morning than he should for the Sake of their requisite Presence is together with the Fracture of the Seals against the Law of Security such a manifest and indisputable Mark and Indication of Fraud as is not to be equall'd in all or any of the Impostures that ever were attempted to be put upon the World  In short by the Sealing of the Stone of the Sepulchre we are to understand nothing less than a Covenant enterd into between our  Cheif Priests  and the  Apostles  by which  Jesus  's Veracity Power and  Messiahship  was to be try'd Tho we read not of the Apostles giving their Consent to the Covenant yet it was reasonably presum'd and could not have been refus'd if ask'd The Condition of the seal'd Covenant was that if  Jesus  arose from the dead in the Presence of our  Cheif Priests  upon their opening the Seals of the Sepulchre at the Time appointed then was he to be acknowledg'd to be the  Messiah  But if he continued in a corrupt and putrified state of Mortality then was he to be granted to be an  Impostor  Very wisely and rightly agreed And if the Apostles had stood to this Covenant Christianity had been nipt in its Bud and suppress'd in its Birth But they had other Views and another Game to play at all Adventures The Body was to be removed and a Resurrection pretended to the Delusion it possibe of all Mankind in which they have been more successful than could be imagin'd upon a Project that had so little Sense or Reason so little Colour of Truth or Artifice in the Contrivance and Execution of it Our  Cheif Priests  were apprehensive at first of their stealing the Body away and pretending a Resurrection Bat after the  sealing  of the  Stone  those fears vanish'd because upon the stealing the  Body away against such security and Precaution the Fraud would be felf evident and want no Demonstration and Proof of it Bur for all this Precaution I say the Body was in a barefaced Manner taken away a Resurrection talk'd of and to the Amazement of every one who can think freely has been beleived thro' all Ages of the Church since Upon the whole then I think you may as well say when a seal'd Closet is broken open and the Treasure gone without the Privity of the Signators that there's no wrong done as that in the Resurrection of  Jesus  there was no Fraud The Cases are equal and parallel What then can your Christian  Priests  say to this demonstrative Argument of a manifest and barefaced Cheat in  Jesus  's Resurrection I have been thinking what they will or can say and upon the maturest Consideration I don't find they can make any other than one or more of these shuffling Answers to it  viz  That it was impossible for the Disciples to Steal the Body of  Jesus  away because of the Watchfulness of the Guards and therefore there was a real Resurrection tho the  Cheif Priests  and  Sellers  of Sepulchre were not present at it  That tho the  Cheif Priests  and  Sealers  of the stone of the Sepulchre were not presenr as I say they ought to have been to behold the Miracle yet his Resurrection was afterwards made as manifest to them as if they had been there present  That if  Jesus  did not really arise from the dead the Beleif of his Resurrection could never have been so propagated at first nor would have been retain'd in the World for so many Ages since  I can think of no other Answers and believe it impossible for your Christian  Priests  to form any other to the foresaid Argument of Fraud in  Jesus  's Resurrection But how weak frivolous and insufficient they all and every one are will appear upon a little Examination into them  Then against the foresaid demonstrative Argument of Fraud it may be pretended  That it was impossible for the Disciples to steal the Body of  Jesus  away because of the Watchfulness of the Guards and therefore there was a real Resurrection tho the  Cheif Priests  the  Sealers  of the Sepulchre were not present at it  To which I reply and confess that if it was impossible to evade the Guards of the Sepulchre then there was a real Resurrection but if there was but a bare Possibility of evading them then this Answer is of no Force And I am of Opinion that the Thing was not only possible but easy feassible and practicable Tho the  Roman  Soldiers were of as much Fidelity and Integrity as any of their Profession yet it is well known that such Creatures are subject to Bribery and Corruption if the Disciples had any Money to tempt them with Or if their Faithfulness to their Trust was untainted yet it is not improbable but their Officers at the Direction of  Pilat  who found his Account in the Distractions of our Nation might give them the Hint to wink hard at the Commission of such a Fraud But not to insist on either of these Ways to evade the  Watch  our Ancestors said what your  Evangelist  has recorded that the Disciples taking the opportunity of the sleep of the Guards carry'd the Body of  Jesus  off which was a thing both possible and probable  Of what Number the  Watch  did consist is uncertain Your  Whitly  Upon the Place in  Matthew  says they  were  sixty  but he has no Reason nor Authority to think they were so many If they had been to be a Guard against Violence I should easily have believed they were more but in as much as they were only a  Watch  against Fraud and against any casual defaceing of the  Seals  on the Stone before the  Cheif Priests  came to open the Sepulchre  three  or  four  Soldiers were sufficient and I don't think there were any more set to this Purpose  It is not then at all improbable that so few Soldiers should be fast asleep at that time of Night or so early in the Morning when the clandestine Work was done especially after keeping such a  Gaudy day  as was the Feast of the Passover which like the Festivals of other Nations was celebrated with Excess Foot Soldiers then you may be sure upon the Bounty of one or other did no more want than they would scruple to take their  Fill  which like an Opiat lock'd up their Senses for that Night when the Disciples being aware of the lucky opportunity carry'd the Body of  Jesus  off safely  And where's the Absurdity to suppose that the Disciples themselves might contrive the Intoxication of the Guards  Herodotus  tells us a Story of a deadBody's  being stolen away by such an Artifice And I don't think the Disciples of  Jesus  either so foolish or conscientious as not to take the Hint and enterprise the like Fraud  Peter  who upon occasion could  swear  and  curse  like a  Trooper  would hardly scruple to fuddle a few  FootSoldiers  But which way soever it came to pass the Watch were asleep which is neither hard to conceive nor believe and then the Disciples executed  that  Fraud which has been the Delusion of Nations and Ages since  Your  Evangelists  would hint that the  Cheif Priests  gave Money to the Soldiers to say they were asleep when the Disciples stole the Body of  Jesus  away as if they were brib'd to a false Testimony but there neither was nor could be any such Thing If there had been a real Resurrection to their Astonishment and Amazement as it is represented in your Gospels no Money could so soon have corrupted them to a false Witness being under such Fears of God and of  Jesus  I don't doubt but our  Cheif Priests  might reward the Soldiers for speaking the Truth and exhort them to persist in it with a Promise to  secure  them  against the Anger of  Pilat  for their sleeping and neglect of their Duty  Here then is no  Answer  to the foresaid Argument or Objection against  Jesus  's Resurrection It was not at all impossible for the Disciples who stole the Body away to avoid the Guards who were and may reasonably be supposed to be lull'd asleep when the Disciples did it Neither is there any more Force in the  Second Answer to it  viz That tho the Cheif Priests the sealers of the Stone of ths Sepulchre were not present opening the Seals and beholding the Miracle yet his Resurrection was afterwards as manifest to them as if they had been there present  Ay this is somewhat like an Answer if there be any Truth in it A Manifestation of  Christ risen  afterwards to our  Cheif Priests  would have been equivalent to their Presence at and sight of the Miracle But how was his Resurrection manifested to them did  Jesus  ever afterwards appear personally to them to their satisfaction that he was the same Person whom they crucified and put to Death for a Deceiver and false Prophet No this is not once asserted by your  Evangelists  or ever insinuated by any antient or modern Writer How then was  Jesus  's Resurrection made  manifest to our Cheif Priests Why your  Divines  say what is all that can be said here that the Words of the Disciples who being Men of Honesty Simplicity and Integrity would not Lye are to be taken for it Very fine indeed our Cheif Priests are to take the Words of the Disciples for  Jesus  's Resurrection and look upon them as Men of Veracity when they knew and experienc'd them to be grand Cheats not only in Stealing the Body of  Jesus  away but in the  known Imposture  of  Lazarus  's Resurrection or your  Evangelist  had never implicitly called it so When therefore Deceivers will not be  Lyers  nor Theives  Dissemblers  of the Fact they are accused of I will own  Jesus  's Resurrection to have been manifest enough to our  Cheif Priests  There's no Need of more Argument here He that bestows more Words on it loses Time  It has been a Constant Objection of us  Jews  against the Resurrection of  Jesus  that he appear'd not personally afterwards to our  Cheif Priests  to  Pilat  and to others his Crucifiers and Insultors to upbraid them with their Infidelity and ill Treatment of him Whether  Jesus  would not have done so if he really arose from the dead and whether he ought not in Reason for the Conviction and Conversion of  Unbeleivers to have done so with me is no Question  Celsus  of old  Si Jesus volebat revera declarare suam divinam Potentiam debuerat suis Insultatoribus ipsi{que} Praesidi qui capitalem sententiam contra se tulerat denique caeteris omnibus se ostendere  In Orig Lib  ii  contra Celsum  in the Name of the  Jews  made the Objection and  Olibio  a late  Rabbi  In Limborchii Arnica Collatione cum Judaeo  has repeated it But in all my Reading and Conversation with Men or Books I never met with a tolerable Answer to it  Origen  and  Limborch  the Writers against  Celsus  and  Olibio  gently slide over the Objection as if it was too hot or weighty to be touch'd and handled by them To recite the poor short and insufficient Answers of those two great Authors to the Objection would be the Exposing of them and giving such Strength to the Objection which it don't want Therefore I will leave the Objection which  Origen  Magna Sane Res et miranda occurrit hoc loco quae non Solum aliquem  vulgo Credentium exercere posset Sed perfectiores etiam cur non Dominus post Resurrectionem aeque ac superioribus temporibus conspiciendum se praebuerit  In Lib  ii cont  Celsum  owns to be a considerable one to the Meditation of your modern Advocates for Christianity and when they can prove that  Jesus  after his Resurrection did personally appear to his Crucifiers the  Cheif  Priests  and  Sealers  of the Sepulchre to their Confutation or that according to the Law of Reason he ought not to have appeared to them then I will turn  Christian  and grant that in the Argument above which proves plain Fraud in the Resurrection there's no Force nor Truth In the mean time  Jesus  's NonAppearance to the  Cheif Priests  is a Confirmation that he did not arise from the Dead bat that his Body was stolen away or he would have waited in the Grave the coming of the Sealers of the Stone and their regular opening of the Sepulchre to the Conviction and Conversion of all there present and Confirmation of the Faith of all Ages and Nations since But  A third Answer to the foresaid Argument of Fraud in the Resurrection of  Jesus  drawn from the Nature Use and Design of sealing the Stone of the Sepulchre is  that tho the  Sealers  of the Sepulchre were not present opening the Seals and beholding the Miracle yet  Jesus  did certainly arise from the Dead or the Belief of his Resurrecton could never have been at first propagated by the Apostles nor would for so many Ages of the Church since have stood its Ground  Here's as little Reason in this Answer as in either of the two former Who knows not that many Errors in Philosophy and as many Frauds in Religion have been sometimes accidentally sometimes designedly espous'd and palm'd upon Mankind who in Process of Time become so wedded  them thro' Prejudice and Interest that they will not give themselves Leave to enquire into the Rise and Foundation of them False Miracles have been common Things among Christians and as the Resurrection of  Jesus  is their grand and fundamental one so it is not at all difficult to account for the Rise Propagation and Continuance of the Belief of it  Why it has been believed thro' these latter Ages of the Church is no Wonder at all The Priests had their Interest in it the ignorant and superstitious had their Comfort in it and the wise and considerate for Fear of Persection durst not enquire into the Grounds of it  The only difficulty here is to know upon what Principle the Project and Story of  Jesus  's Resurrection was at first devised And whether it was Ambition or Revenge upon our ancient and pharisaical Priesthood that prompted the Apostles to it is all one to me Such bad  Principles too often put Men upon desperate Attempts But however an Imposture it was for the Argument above To say the Apostles and Confederates in the Fraud would not have stood to it and have dy'd for it if the Resurrection had not been real Fact signifies nothing Many Cheats and Criminals besides them have asserted their Innocency and deny'd their Guilt in the utmost exrremity of Death without the like Views of Honour and Fame The only Thing that's surprising and astonishing in this ShamMiracle is that tho it was the most manifest the most barefaced and the most self evident Imposture that ever was put upon the World yet it has been the most fortunate and successful having past thro' many Ages and Nations with Reputation and Renown and might have continued for as many Generations to come but for the Argument above that perfectly and clearly overthrows its Credit  But some may say here where was the Wisdom and Providence of God all this while to suffer so many Ages and Nations to labour under such a Delusion Why I'll tell you The Providence of God in it was "To humble Mankind in the End for their vain  Ostentation of Wisdom Learning and  Science falsly so call'd  "To shame them for their Madness and Wickedness to persecute one another for different Opinions in that Religion whose very Foundation is false and groundless "To caution them against a blind and implicit Faith for the future against believing any thing out of the sight and reach of their Understandings "To admonish them of the necessity of Liberty to think speak and write freely about Religion for the Correction of Errors and Discovery of Truth and lastly "To reduce the World when it should be ripe for it to the golden Religion of Nature which upon the Testimony of our old  Cabalistical  Doctors and of your  Jesus  himself is the  End of the Law and the Prophets  And thus have I spoken to the  Answers  which your  Christian Priesthood  may be presumed to make to the foresaid Argument of Fraud in  Jesus  's Resurrection drawn from the Design of our  Cheif Priests  in sealing of the Stone of his Sepulchre I should not have concern'd myself to speak to these their supposed  Answers  but to save them the Trouble of making them and the Imagination of there being some Force in them  As to the Stories in your  Evangelists  of  Jesus  's several Appearances after his pretended Resurrection sometimes to the Women and at other Times to his Disciples I am not at all obliged to refute them If these Appearances had been more frequent better circumstanced and more solemnly averr'd they would have wanted no Confutation There's no doubt on't but the Disciples who for the Argument above unquestionably stole  Jesus  's Body away in order to pretend a Resurrection would talk much of his appearing to them and of the Conversation afterwards they had with him And if they had told better and more plausible Tales of their fight of and Conversition with him it would be nothing to the Purpose  better  I say  and more plausible Tales  than those upon Record which for Absurdity Nonsense and Incoherence carry their own Confutation along with them  Whoever blends together the various History of the four  Evangelists  as to  Jesus  's Appearances after his Resurrection will find himself not only perplex'd how to make an intelligible consistent and sensible Story of it but must with  Celsus  Quamvis Celsus has Jesu post Resurrectionem Apparitiones conferre conetur cum vulgaribus Spectris Visionibus  In Origen Lib  ii  contra Celsum    needs think it if he closely think on't like some of the confused and incredible womanish Fables of the Apparitions of the Ghosts of deceased Persons which the Christian World in particular has in former Ages abounded with The Ghosts of the Dead in this present Age and especially in this Protestant Country have ceas'd to appear and we nowadays hardly ever hear of such an Apparition And what is the Reason of it Why the Beleif of these Storys being banish'd out of Men's Minds the crafty and vaporous forbear to trump them upon us There has been so much clear Proof of Fraud in many of these Storys that the wise and considerate Part of Mankind has rejected them all excepting  this  of  Jesus  which to Admiration has stood its Ground It's no wonder indeed that the  Clergy  who are more incredulous than other Folks as to Storys of Apparitions do stick to this of  Jesus  the only one excepted out of all others It is a sweet morsel of Faith and they readily swallow and digest it because they live by it otherwise  this  Story of  Jesus  's Appearances after Death had hardly escaped the Fate of other Apparitions nay would have been rejected one of the first of them there being hardly one I dare say it among all  Storys of  Apparitions were they to be collected together that's more absurd and incredible than  this  of  Jesus  I have not here Room to make any Remarks on your Evangelical Story of  Jesus  's Apparitions after his Death and if I had I durst not do it for fear of an offensive Ludicrousness and of transgressing the Rules of  Decency    Sobriety  and  Sedateness  of Argument you have confined me to But however can't read the Story without smiling and there are two or three Passages in it that put me in mind of  Robinson Cruso  's filling his Pockets with Biskets when he had neither Coat Wastcoat nor Breeches on Sometimes I think your  Evangelists  wanted Wit to adapt their Tale to Sense and to accommodate the Transaction to Nature and sometimes I think them crafty and were minded like  Daniel de Foe  in his foresaid  Romance  to put the Banter upon the Credulity of Mankind with some disguised and latent Absurdities that in the Conclusion and Discovery they might be heartily laugh'd at for the Belief of them I dare not I say so much a hint at one of these Absurdities least I should be unwarily tempted to crack a Jest on it But the Time I hope is coining when I shall use more Freedom And should your  Priesthood in Proof of  Jesus  's Resutrection urge any of these Storys of his corporal Presence and Appearance after it then I trust they'll permit me to to make as merry Descants on them as your  Bishops  when Academical  Jesters  used to do on other Men's Bulls and Blunders  In the mean time I depend on the foregoing single sober and sedate Argument of Fraud in this grand Miracle which I found on the Nature and Design of sealing the Sepulchre and for Confirmation of my Opinion and Proof of Fraud in it will conclude this Letter with a parallel Case and Story Not many Years since one Dr  Emms  of the Society of the French Prophets who in their Inspirations were like  Jesus  and his Disciples of old Declaimers against the Pharisaical Priesthood of this Age did by himself or some of his Fraternity did for him predict his Resurrection on a certain Day when there was a Concourse of People about his Grave in vain to behold the Miracle as there would have been about  Jesus  's Sepulchre if he had lain in it his full Time But supposing in this Case that the Magistrates and Priesthood of this City to prevent a Cheat and Delusion of the People had interred the  Doctor  in a ChnrchVault and seal'd the Door of it against the Day appointed for his Resurrection commanding a  NightWatch  to look to the Vault the no Violence or Deceit be used This would have been a wise Precaution against Fraud as was in the Case of  Jesus  But what if his Fraternity having a Mind like  Jesus  's Disciples to bambouzle the People and Priesthood had some of them drawn the Watch aside to a  Ginshop  whilst others carry'd the Body off pretending a Resurrection What would all reasonable Men have said here That it was an impudent and barefaced Imposture But to carry on the Farce supposing the  Doctor  's Fraternity had afterwards averr'd that they had seen and convers'd with him alive several Times as before his Death and had told particular Storys of their Conversation with him as  first  of all how he appear'd to some of their Women who were admonish'd of the Certainty of his Resurrection by a Youth or an Angel or two they could not tell whether but they were as like to Angels which they never saw before in their Lives as Youths could be who knew him not by his Countenance for  their Eyes were holden  as by his Talk on ScriptureProphecy which was his usual Cant before his  Death And at another Time he appear'd to his old Acquaintance who knew him not by the Features of his Face but by an habitual Motion and Action of his Hand in  breaking of Bread  And at another Time he was corporally present but  they thought    they saw a Spirit  About  eight Days after that  he appear'd among more of his old Friends but for all their former Intimacy with him some of them  doubted  whether it was the  Doctor  or not At another Time he came to them in  another Form  and Shape unlike to his pristin one but they were sure it was  He  by his Exposition of the Scripture At another Time when they were assembled together and the Doors were lock'd  for fear of the Clergy  the  Doctor  slipt unexpectedly into their Company either from behind a Curtain or miraculously enter'd at the Keyhold And the last Time he appear'd there was one of his intimate Friends had not known him but by a  Sore  in his Breast which the Power of God in his Resurrection did not heal After which they said he  vanish'd away    was taken up into Heaven  and they saw him no more Supposing I say the  French  Prophets had told such like Storys of  Doctor Emms  's Resurrection and of his Appearances to them what would  your Priests and all other wise Men have said to it Why that it was all idle Tales manifest Lyes Sham and lmposture and that if the  Doctor  in Confutation of the Errors of your Priests had risen to Life God would have kept him in his Sepulchre his full time and have rais'd him in the Presenee of Priests Magistrates and People and that he would have walk'd afterwards publickly in the Streets without Danger to the Satisfaction of all who knew him that he was the same  Emms  who died and was bury'd  Without Danger  I say from the Populace who would have been so far from affronting him that they would have almost adored him for the miraculous Favour God had done him in his Resurrection from the dead and that he would never have skulk'd about and absconded himself for  forty Days  together before he was pretendedly translated and therefore there was nothing but notorious Deceit and Imposture in all these Pretences  I need not make the Application of this Case and Story which your  Priests  know how to do for me To say here that there's none would be so desperate to engage in such a Fraud as is the supposed Case of Dr  Emms  above is a mistake  Many Thousands for their Diversion would enterprise it and the Storys of the Apparitions of Ghosts which are almost all the Frauds of the Crafty to delude the ignorant do prove it I my felf would be forward to concert such an Intrigue if it was but to put the Banter upon the  Clergy  to ruffle their Tempers and secretly to laugh at them Nothing would deter me from it but fears of the Civil Magistrate which was not the Danger of the Disciples of  Jesus  because  Pilat  for the sake of Rule over the  Jews  was a Countenancer of every Faction amongst them and particularly  Comminatus est Periculum Accusatoribus Christianorum  Tertul Apol Cap  v  Tiberius  upon  Pilat  's Representation of the matter soon commanded that the Disciples of  Jesus  should not be molested nor call'd into Question So the Disciples stood to the Fraud told the Story of  Jesus risen  so often till they believed it themselves and drew Multitudes into the Belief of it Which Belief must have continued thro' all Generations to come but for my Argument of Fraud before urg'd and argued  Here Sir before I conclude this Letter I think it my Duty however to give  you may Opinion of the Religion that  Jesus  and his Disciples were for introducing into the World Tho I beleive what I have proved his Resurrection to be a Piece of Fraud and his other Miracles to have been all Artifice and tho our  Cheif Priests  and ancient Nation are justifiable in the Sentence that was pass'd and executed upon  Jesus  yet I must do him and his Disciples the Justice to own that the Doctrine they taught was for the most Part of it good ufeful and popular being no other than the Law and Religion of Nature which all Nations being wearied with their own Superstitions and sick of the Burthen of their Priests ran apace into Accordingly one  Justin Martyr  In Apol  ii  of your ancient Fathers says that they  who lived according to the Law of Nature were true Christians  And I must needs say that if Christians in Process of Time had not sophisticated this primitive Religion of  Jesus  If they had not built their systematical Divinity upon him and brought strange Inventions of Men into his Worship If lastly they had not again subjugated and entangled themselves with another and worse Yoke of Bondage to an intolerable and tyrannical  Priesthood of the Church the World might have enjoy'd great Happiness under  Jesus  's Religion even  that Happiness  which is now only to be expected upon a Disproof of his miraculous Resurrection that has been the Foundation of a most confused Superstructure of wild Doctrines and Opinions Or more truely speaking  That Happiness  of the state of Nature Religion and Liberty which may be look'd for upon the coming of our  Messiah  the allegorical Accomplisher of the Law and the Prophets whose Advent upon the Tradition of our  Cabalists  will be toward the latter End of the  Sixth  grand Age of the Creation to remove from our Faces and our Hearts the Vail of the Letter and in the mean while I adhere to the umbratical Rites Ceremonies and way of Worship derived from our Forefathers  Thus Sir have I finish'd my  Letter  on  Jesus  's Resurrection and whether I hive not said enough to justify our  Jewish  Disbeleif of that Miracle let your  Cheif Priests  judge I don't expect my Argument against it will be convincing of any of your Preachers They have a potent Reason for their Faith which we  Jews  can't come at or I don't know but we might believe with them  I trust you'll meet with no Molestation for the Publication of this  Letter  neither do I think it was any thing of mine inserted in your Discourses that at any time brought Trouble on you It was your own Imprudence to rave as you do against  Ecclesiasticks  What need had you to talk of the Mischeifs and Inconveniences of an Hireling Priesthood What occasion had you to call them Ecclesiastical Virmin and to speak of the Happiness of Mankind upon their Extinction These things are very provoking And here's the true Sourse in my Opinion of all your Troubles  Tho I have here shewn that  Christ is not risen  yet I have more Wit than to make the Inference of  Paul  that  their Preaching is vain  Their Oratory is still useful if it be but to tickle the Ears and amuse the Understandings of the People about Doctrines they understand not whether true or false And such an order of Men as are your Priestood are by their Habit of long Robes an Ornament to Society and it is an Honour to the Country to have them well fed and clad Had I Room for it I could write a curious  Encomium  in Prise of them and tell the World of what Use and Advantage they have been in all Ages O  what Wars and Persecutions might have been rais'd in the World but for their pacifick Tempers How would Sin and Immorality have broke in upon Mankind like a Deluge but for the Goodness of their Lives and the Excellency of their Precepts How has the Increase and Multitude of their warm Sermons been the Ruin of  Satan  's hot and divided Kingdom of Darkness and Error Its owing to their Pains and Labours that every Age for many past has been improving in Virtue till the present which for Piety and good Morals is that Perfection of Time which is not to be meliorated but by the Restitution of the golden Age  So could I enlarge in Praise of your  Clergy  and so should you have done and then you might have disputed as you do against any Doctrines Miracles and Articles of Faith without Molestation Try if you can't correct that fundamental Error you have committed Assert still if you can with Dr  Rogers  the Necessity of an establish'd Priesthood well paid for the Service of the  King  and the Country under all Changes of Religion which may be a means to retrieve their Favour and will beget in me a better opinion of your Prudence than at  present is entertain'd by your  Assured Friend  N N  So ends the Letter of my Friend the  Jewish Rabbi  in which to my Comfort he has conform'd himself to the Rules of  Sedateness    Decency  and  Sobriety  of Argument prescrib'd by the two great  Bishops  of  London  and St  Davids  If the weight and solidity of his Argument don't grieve the  Clergy  I am in no Pain for the Levity and Ludicrousness of if And whether the weight and nature of his Argument against  Jesus  's Resurrection will at all startle and surprise them I know not but I profess for my self that I might have study'd long enough for such an Argument against it as this  Rabbi  with his great gray Beard has presently hit off He told me beforehand that his Thoughts on  Jesus  's Resurrection should be out of the common Road of thinking and I must needs say he has been as good as his Word or no Man ever kept his Promise  There are two Things very remarkable in his Argument The  One  is the Use and Design of sealing the Stone of  Jesus  's Sepulchre which he lays great stress on to the Proof of Fraud in his Resurrection and the  other  is his Application of these Words  the last Error  or  as he reads Deceit or Imposture  will be worst than the first  or former in which he makes the  Cheif Priests  in their Speech to  Pilat  to refer to  Lazarus  's Resurrecrection as the former known Imposture If his Application be just and true the Consequence is that the Resurrections of  Jesus  and  Lazarus  are both Impostures It grieves me to the Heart to think of this Consequence which our  Divines  are to see to and evade if they can No sooner did I read his Application of the foresaid Words but I run to our  Commentators  for another and better Exposition of them But alas to my Sorrow they made nothing of them but a sort of a  proverbial Expression  which the  Cheif Priests  must have spoil'd and knock'd out of Joint Being then under great Trouble for the Truth of Christianity and the Certainty of these two grand Miracles I refer the matter to our Learned  Clergy  desiring them to be as speedy as they can in another and more proper Interpretation of the foresaid Words or  Jews  and  Infidels  will run away with them in the  Rabbi  's Sense to the Confutation of our holy Religion  I consider'd lately tint  Easter  drew nigh when it was usual for our  Divines  in their Pulpits to insist on the Proof of  Jesus  's Resurrection and therefore I I hasten'd the Publication of this  Discourse  that they might have these two peculiar Texts  viz  of  sealing the Stone  of the Sepulchre and of  the last Error  or Imposture  will be worse than the first  to treat on He that produces a Sermon or Sermons wresting the foresaid Texts out of the Hands of my  Rabbi  and putting another Sense on them to the Credit of  Jesus  's and  Lazarus  's Resurrection  Erit mihi magnus Apollo  and by my Consent shall be the next  ArchBishop  of  Canterbury  But my Heart akes a little for our  Divines  and I almost despair of their clean Solutions of the foresaid two Difficultys What must they do then Why they must give up their  Religion  as well as their  Church  or go along with me to Fathers for their mystical Interpretation of the whole Story of  Jesus  's Resurrection  That the Fathers without questioning their Belief of  Jesus  's corporal Resurrection universally interpreted the Story and every part of it mystically is  most certain St  Hilary  Quod autem a Joseph rogato Pilato ut Corpus redderet sindone involvitur in Monumento novo in Petra excisa reponitur Saxum Ostio Monumenti advolvitur Quanquam sit Ordo Gestorum sepeliri eum erat necesse qui resurrecturus erat a mortuis tamen non sine Rerum

Story and intimates what they are typical and figurative of as any one may see by the Citation referr'd to which I have not Room to translate and illustrate  St  Augustin  Ad hoc enim Dominus hodie resurrexit ut Imaginem nobis futurae Resurrectionis  enderet  In Serm  clxviii  Append  says that  Jesus  's Resurrection from the dead at that Time was  to exhibit an Image and Resemblance of his future and mystical Resurrection And elsewhere says  Quid singula significent quaerere sanctae quidem Deliciae sunt  In Johan Evang C  xx  Tract    that its a holy Pleasure to consider and search for the things signified by the Story of it  That  Origen  is of the same Opinion no body need question A multitude of his Testimonies might be produced to this Purpose but I shall mention only one  Monumentum Christi est divina Scriptura in qua Divinitatis Humanitatis cjus mysteria densitate Litterae veluti quadam muniuntur Petra  In Diversos Homil    wherein he asserts that by the Sepulchre of  Jesus  is to be understood the  Letter  of the Scriptures in which as in a Rock he is reposited  St  John  of  Jercsalem  Ne putes tune solummodo traditus est Christus Principilus Sacerdotibus ScribisQuando enim vides Scripturas Ptophetarum Evangelii Apostolorum traditas esse in Manus fulsorum Sacerdotum Scribarum num intelliges quia Verbum Veritatis traditum est Principibus iniquis scribis  In Mat C  xx  by the Crucifiers of  Jesus  understands false Teachers meaning  Ministers  of the  Letter  to be sure because he himself was a great Allegorist  St  Hilary  says that  Interpretatio autem Nominis Barabbae est Patris filius Jam itaque Arcanum Infidelitatis futurae oftenditur Christo Patris filium praeferendo Anti Christum scilicet hominem Peccati Diaboli filium potius{que} adhortantibus principibus suis eligunt Damnationi reservatum quatn Salutis Authorem  In Loc Mat  Barabbas  is a Type of  AntiChrist  and by  AntiChrist  as I have elsewhere shewn but of the Fathers is meant the  Letter  of the Scriptures which modern Commentators and Crucifiers of  Jesus  would prefer to the Spirit For these are the two  Letter  and Spirit the  Christ  and  AntiChrist  that are contrary one to another  St  Jerome  Velum Templi scissun est omnia Legis Sacramenta quae prius tegebantur prodita sunt atquc ad Gentium Populum transierunt  In Loc Mat  says that by the  Vail  of the  Temple  rent at  Jesus  's Resurrection is to be understood the opening the  Vail  of the  Letter  of the Law and the Prophets for the Manifestation of the divine Mysterys contain'd in them And by the rending of the Rocks according  Petrae Scissae id est universa Vaticinia Prophetarum  In Epist ad Hedibriam  to him is to be understood the Apertion of the Oracles of God that were before as hard as a Rock till his spiritual Resurrection for the Illustration of them And by the Earthquake  He  Sed mihi videtur Terrae Motus reliqua typum ferre credentium quod pristinis Erroum vitiis derelictis Cordis emollita duritia postea agnoverint Creatorem  In Loc Matt  says is meant the Shakeing of the Hearts of Men and preparing them by a Dereliction of their old Errors for the susception of the true Knowledge of God  As to the Time that  Jesus  was dead and bury'd which modern  Divines  call  three Days  and  three Nights  St  Augustin  says  Ipsum autem tridurum non totum plenum fuisse Scriptura testis est  In Lib iv de Trinitate Sect    that according to the Scripture he was not so long dead and buried Many says  De tribus diebus multi fancti multa hinc senserint atque dixerintSed nos neutram eorum vacantes sententiam melius tamen si placet in his spiritalem requiramus Intellectum tres dies tria Tempora Saeculi ponentes  In Sermon de Symbolo  he have put various Constructions on the Time of  Christ  's burial endeavouring to make three Days of it But we without slighting any of their opinions are for a mystical Interpretation and suppose that by the three Days are to be understood three Ages of the World  The Day would fail me to collect all the Passages out of the Fathers in Interpretation of one or other of the Parts  of the story of  Jesus  's Resurrection but what I have here said in a few Citations is enough to show that they look'd upon the whole Story as emblematical of his spiritual Resurrection out of the  Grave  of the  Letter  of the Scriptures in which he has been bury'd about  three Days  and  three Nights  according to that mystical Interpretation of prophetical Numbers which I have learn'd of them  And thus have I done with the Miracle of  Jesus  's Resurrection which by the help of my Friend the Jewish  Rabbi  I have shown according to the Letter to consist of the greatest Incredibilitys And with this I conclude my  Discourses  on his Miracles intending to treat on no more of them unless I am invited or provoked to it I had once an Inclination to make another  Discourse  on  Jesus  's miraculous Conception and on his feeding his Thousands in the Wilderness with a few Loaves and Fishes but upon a little Consideration on the Letter of those two Storys I found myself too grave for the Work and my  Rabbi  's Thoughts are too gay and wonton therefore it must be omitted till the  Clergy  importune me to it and signify their Curiosity to see it perform'd by me  My Discourses hereafter if God spare me Life and Liberty which under his Providence I don't despair of to publish another Volume shall treat on some historical Passages of the New Testament such as "On the Storys of  Jesus  's Birth and the Appearances of Angels to the Shepherds keeping Watch over their Flocks by Night "The Journey and Presents of the Wise Men to  Jesus  The Slaughter of the Innocents at  Bethlehem  and of  Herods  Cruelty "The Travels of  Joseph  with the Child  Jesus  and his Mother into  Egypt  "The Disputation of  Jesus  with the  Doctors  in the Temple and his Elopement from his Parents "His riding on an Ass to  Jerusalem  and on other such like Passages of his Life For I am resolv'd to give the Letter of the Scripture no Rest so long as God gives me Life and Abilities to attack it  Origen  Cum disputamus adversus eos cum conquirimus advicem tunc quaeimus logum Dogmatis illius in littera Legis Historiae ostenditur secundum Historiam stare non posse  In Psal  xxxvi  says that  when we dispute against Ministers of the Letter we must select some historical Parts of Scripture which they understand litterally and shew that according to the Letter they can't stand  their Ground but imply Absurditys and Nonsence  And how then is such a Work to be perform'd to best Advantage is it to be done in a grave sedate and serious Manner No I think Ridicule should here take Place of sober Reasoning as the more proper and effectual means to cure Men of their foolish Faith and absurd Notions As no wise Man hardly ever reprehends a Blunderbuss for his Bull any other way than by laughing at him so the Asserters of nonsensical Notions in Theology should if possible be satirised and jested upon or they'll never be put out of Countenance for nor desert their absurd Doctrines And there never was a Polemical Divine that if he hid an opportunity and Advantage over the Weakness of his Adversary did not take such a ludicrous and merry Course with him  But on such historical Passages of the Gospel as before mention'd do I trust to publish another Volume of  Discourses  like to these on  Jesus  's Miracles and at present pass to my third general Head at first proposed to be spoken to and that is  III To consider what  Jesus  means when he appeals to his Works and Miracles  as to a Testimony and witness of his Authority and to show that he did not properly and ultimately refer to those done in the  Flesh  but to those mystical ones he would do in the  Spirit  of which those done in the Flesh are but mere Types and Shadows  And on this Head I shall be short there being no Occasion of many Words on it The  Bishop  of  London  Pastoral Letter p  has collected many Sayings of  Jesus  wherein he seems to appeal to the Works he then did and had done in Flesh as to a witness of him But why might not  Jesus  then Prophesy and mean the spiritual Works which  Heinus  would do It is the known Way of the Prophets to speak of Things to come as if they were already past because such Prophecys are not to be understood till their Accomplishment Even so did  Jesus  Prophesy when he appeal'd to his Works as I could prove from the Nature and Manner of his Expressions but that the Argument would be dry and tedious And therefore I refer the Matter entirely to the Fathers who asserted that  Jesus  prophesied in his  Miracles  as well as in his  Parables  and that the Works he then did in the Flesh were but Types of his mysterious Operations  that would be the Demonstration of his Authority and Messiahship Hence it is that  Origen  Adventus quidem Christi unus in Humilitate completus est alius vero Speratur in Gloria Et hic primus Adventus in Carne mystico quodam Sermone in Scripturis Sanctis Umbra ejus appellatur  In Jesu Nave Homil  viii  says that  Jesus  's first coming was but Type and Shadow of his Spiritual Advent and that his  Vera Christi Miracula Sanatio Infirmorum est spiritalis  In Matt C  xxv  true Miracles by which his Authority is to be proved are Spiritual Hence it is that St  Hilary  repeatedly says  Haec licet in prasens gesta sunt quid tamen in futurum significent contuendum est  In Matt C  x  S  Christi Gesta aliud portendunt  C  xii  S  Peragunt formam futuri gesta praerfentia  C  x xi  that  Jesus  's Works were significative and predictive of mysterious Operations which we were especially to look to And Hence it is that all the other Fathers interpreted the Miracles of  Jesus  in a mystical and allegorical Sense  The Question then is to what Miracles did  Jesus  truly and properly appeal in the Opinion of the Fathers for his Authority and Messiahship Was it to his Typical or Antitypal Works was it to the  shadow  or to the  subsistance  of his Operations  To his substantial Operations to be sure which are and will be his spiritual ones upon the Soul that are greater than those once done on Men's Bodys and which will be a proper Proof of his divine Power And to declare my Opinion freely I am only for such a spiritual  Messiah  who will cure the  Errors  call'd the Diseases of Mankind which  Jesus  of  Nazareth  has not as yet done  But not to dispute this Point with  Bishop Gibson  I will leave him in the Enjoyment of his Opinion of his literal  Messiah  and miraculous Operator on Men's Bodys if he'll but indulge me in the Belief of my spiritual  Messiah  to come for the healing of modern Distempers call'd the Sins and Errors of Mankind And in the mean time let us draw the Comparison between his  litteral  and my  spiritual  Jesus and let the World judge to whom the Preference is to be given for Power and Authority  Bishop  Gibson  is for  Jesus  of  Nazareth  's Messiahship because he cured the  bodily blindness  of many miraculously And a good Work it was But I am for the Messiahship of a spiritual  Jesus  to come who will open the  blind Eyes  of pur Understandings to discern Truth from Error which will be a most glorious  Operation that his  Jesus  of  Nazareth  has not as yet done  Bishop  Gibson  is for  Jesus  's Messiahship who once cured  bodily Deafness  in many which was indeed well done of him But I am for the Messiahship of a spiritual  Jesus  to come to heal the  Deafness  of our Souls or their  Dulness  in Apprehension of sublime Mysterys which will be a divine Work that his  Jesus  has not as yet done  Bishop  Gibson  is for  Jesus  's Messiahship because he cured Men's bodily  Lameness  for which I do praise him But I am for a spiritual  Jesus  's Messiahship who will heal Mankind of their  Halting  between two and more Opinions a more Blessed Work that  Jesus  of  Nazareth  has not as yet done for us  And so comparing all other Diseases of Body and Soul together I am for the  Jesus  who will heal the Diseases of the Soul and have a much less Regard for  Bishop Gibson  's  Jesus  who cured the Diseases of a few Men's Bodys but for all that am not angry with the  Bishop  for his high Veneration of his  Jesus  neither would I by any Means have him prosesecuted and punish'd for not being of the same Mind with me  But because the  Bishop  suspects me of Infidelity in that I have ludicrously treated some of the Miracles of his  Jesus  which by the by he has not vindicated from the Absurditys and Incredibilitys I charged them with I will humour the  Bishop  and supposing  Jesus  wrought literally those Miracles which are allegorically interpreted by me will in those very Miracles compare his  litteral  and my  spiritual  Jesus together and appeal to all Men of Consideration which is the most worthy of the Title and Honour of the true  Messiah  Bishop  Gibson  is for his  Jesus  's Messiahship who miraculously drove the  Buyers  and  Sellers  out of the Temple just as if a Man was God to invest him with Power should furiously drive the  Butchers  and  Grasiers  with their Cattle to the Confusion of their several Propertys out of  Smithfield  A notable Miracle That But I am for the spiritual  Jesus  's Messiahship who according to the Form of that typical Story will at his Coming expel Ecclesiastical Merchants out of his Church who make Merchandise of the Gospel Selling their  Bulls  and  Beasts  and  fatlings  of the Letter A most glorious and Beneficial Work to Mankind will this  be And to prepare Men's Souls for the susception of such a spiritual  Jesus  I intend to publish a  Discourse  of the Mischiefs and Inconveniencies of an  HirelingPriesthood  wherein it shall be proved that Mankind can't be either good wise or happy under the Kingdom of this  Messiah  to come without an Abolition and Extirpation of them  Bishop  Gibson  is for the Messiahship of his  Jesus  who  cast the Devils out of the Madmen aud permitted them to enter into the Herd of Swine  that  ran violently down a Precipice and were choak'd in the Sea  How great a Miracle it was thus to cure the Madmen the  Bishop  may know best being perhaps better acquainted with the Devil than I am but was it not for Pity to the  Swineherds  for their Losses I could even now laugh at the Thoughts of the Hogs running and tumbling downhill as if the  Devil  drove them But leaving the Bishop  calmly    decently  and  seriously  to admire the Wisdom and Justice of his  Jesus  in that Act I am for the spiritual  Jesus  who according to the typical form of that Story exorcis'd the furious and diabolical Tempers out of the  Jews  and  Gentiles  of old whom no Chains of Reason could hold from doing Violence to the Christians  till they were converted and tho He permitted the like persecuting and diabolical Spirits to enter into Ecclesiastical Swine yet will they be precipitated into the  Sea  of the Knowledge of God wherein they will be absorpt with divine Divisions and Contemplations O most glorious Work that bespeaks the Wisdom Power and Goodness of our spiritual  Jesus  from beginning to the End of it  Bishop  Gibson  admires his  Jesus  for his Transfiguration on Mount  Tabor  tho neither He nor any body else can tell wherein lay the Miracle nor into what various Figures and Shapes  Jesus  was transform'd But I am for the spiritual  Jesus  whose glorious Transfiguration after  six  grand Days of the Creation will be conspicuous when with the Eyes of our Understanding we shall behold him metamorphosed into the Forms of all the Types of him under the Law I am now ravish'd with the intellectual View of this Transfiguration and believe was I to set about it I could give others except the Bishop an Idea and Conception of it to their Astonishment at the Glory of  Jesus  in it  Bishop  Gibson  is for the Messiahship of  Jesus  of  Nazareth  because he cured a  Woman of an Issue of Blood  after she had  spent all she had upon Physicians to no purpose which might be or might not be a Miracle for any Thing he can argue upon it But I am for the spiritual  Jesus  's Messiahship who at his Coming will according to that Typical Story cure the  Woman  of the Church of her  Issue of Blood  that is shed in Persecution and War which her Ecclesiastical Physicians of the  Clergy  have not been able to stop tho they have receiv'd large Fees and Stipends of the Church to that Purpose Will not this be a desirable and beneficial Work to all Nations And who knows not excepting the  Bishop  that it is of the Office of the true Messiah to give  abundance of Peace  to Mankind to  make the Lion to lye down with the Lamb  and to induce Men to  break their Swords into Plowshares  and  their Spears into Pruninghooks  and to  make Wars to cease  in all the World Which Prophecys are so far from being fulfill'd by  Jesus  of  Nazareth  that there has been nothing but wrangling and jangling and scolding and fighting about him ever since I wonder the want of the Accomplishment of the foresaid Prophecys has not long before now occasion'd the Rejection of  Jesus  's Messiahship or of the Authority of the Prophets  Bishop  Gibson  is for his  Jesus  's being the Messiah because he cured an old  Woman  of a  Spirit  of no body knows what  Infirmity  consequently little or nothing is to be said for the Greatness of that Miracle But I am for the spiritual  Jesus  's Messiahship who according to the figure of that litteral Story is to heal the  Woman  of the Church of her  Infirmity of the Spirit  of Prophecy which  Jesus  of  Nazareth  has not done for her or there would not be so many Disputes about Prophecys and their Interpretations so far as there is hardly one Prophecy that Christians are agreed about the Sense of It is the grand Characteristick of the true  Messiah  that he's to restore Prophecy and the Way of Interpretation of the Prophets upon the allegorical Scheme too I speak this not only upon the Authority of the Prophets themselves but upon an almost infinite number of Testimonys of ancient  Jews  and  Fathers  accordingly I expect the Advent of a spiritual Messiah who alone can do it to heal the Church of her present  Infirmity  and to restore the Art and Gift of Prophecy  Bishop  Gibson  is an Admirer of  Jesus  of  Nazareth  because he told a poor Whore of  Samaria  her Fortune of  having had five Husbands  and being then an  Adulteress with another Man which according to the Letter is such a poor sort of a Miracle that I can hardly think of it without blushing But I am an Adorer beforehand of the spiritual  Jesus  who according to that Type will out of the Law and the Prophets allegorically interpreted tell the present heretical and adulterous Woman of the Church  all that she has done  and how she has been wedded to the sensible Things of the  five  Books of  Moses  and is now an Adulteress with the  AntiChrist  of the Letter Such an Information of the Church will be a most stupendous and miraculous Work and a Demonstration of our  Jesus  's Messiahship beyond Contradiction in as much as it will be agreeable to the Opinion that all Antiquity entertain'd of the true  Messiah    viz  that he was to let us into the Sight Knowledge and Understanding of the Wisdom and Beauty of Providence thro' all Ages of the World  Bishop  Gibson  admires  Jesus  of  Nazareth  for  his cursing the Figtree    for not bearing Fruit out of Season  Shame on that Miracle according to the Letter and on all Admirers of it But I am for the spiritual  Jesus  who at his Coming to the Figtree of his Church will make its  present  unfruitful State to  wither away  and  cause it to produce the Fruits of the Spirit and allegorical Interpretations of the Scriptures that are compared so sweet and ripe Figs For such his Advent to this miraculous and beneficial Purpose I daily pray and say too Blessed are all those who love his Appearance  After this Fashion could I go thro' the other Miracles I have treated on in these  Discourses  and Upon the Comparison set plainly before the Eyes of my  Readers  the Difference between the  litteral  Miracles of Bishop  Gibson  's  carnal  Jesus and the  allegorical  ones of my  spiritual  Jesus as to Stupendousness Use and Excellency But what I have here done in the seven Instances above is enough to induce us to believe with the Fathers that  Jesus  's first Coming in the  Flesh  was but Type and Shadow of his second Advent in the  Spirit  and that  Jesus  of old when he appeal'd to his Works then done as to a Witness of his Authority did only Prophesy and re erultimately to his mystical Operations that are alone the Proof of his Godlike and divine Power Bishop  Gibson  says  Pastoral Letter p  of me that  pretending to raise the Actions and Miracles of our Saviour to a more exalted and spiritual Meaning I  have labour'd to take away the Reality of them and by that to destroy one of the principal Evidences of Christianity  But I presume now he'll be sensible of the Rashness and Incogitancy of that Accusation If he be not I shall say of him in Case he write any more for  Jesus  's  litteral  Miracles in Opposition to his  allegorical  ones that he's like the Dog in the Fable the  Bishop  will excuse the Coarsness of the Comparison that let go the  Substance  of his Mutton and catch'd at the Shadow and so like a foolish  Cur  as he was lost both  And thus have I done with the  Three  general Heads at first proposed to be handled in these  Discourses  Now whether I am upon the whole an  Infidel  or  Beleiver  of Christianity the World is to judge I'll make no more solemn Declarations of my Belief of it much less at this Juncture of Time when I am under Prosecution for Infidelity because it would be a sneaking tame and cowardly Act in me and such an Argument of that meanness of Spirit as I abhor and detest My  Works  shall speak for me in which being conscious of the Innocency of my Intentions and of the Usefulness of my Design I mean to proceed not doubting but some of our  Clergy  upon  two or three more  Discourses  against the Letter of the  New Testament  will find me out what I am and whether I am not a true Professor of the Religion of the spiritual and holy  Jesus  In the mean Time I'll not compound the Difference depending between Bishop  Gibson  and myself upon any other Terms than his making me ample Satisfaction for the Injurys done to my Reputation and low Fortunes Tho he may thirst after my Life or at least my Liberty yet under the Providence of God I fear not the Loss of either God be prais'd this Kingdom is bless'd with such a Civil Administration for Wisdom Justice and Mercy as no Nation of the World can equal Our Magistrates are all Philosophers Lovers of Truth and of an Enquiry into it and so tender of the religious as well as of the civil Rights of the Subject that I have nothing to dread from them  There is somewhat  popular  indeed tho nothing true nor rational in the Clamour and Accusations of the  Clergy  against me Bishop  Gibson  would insinuate  Pastoral Letter p  that my  Discourses  on  Miracles  strike  at the Foundation of civil Society  but by an unnatural  Consequence of his own making I confess it is an heinous Crime to write any Thing that tends to the Subversion or Prejudice of the civil Society But how will the  Bishop  make me guilty of it If the  Clergy  will not be Disturbers of the Peace of the publick upon my  Discourses  it's certain that the Quiet of the World which I wish and aim at will be inviolably kept and preserv'd for all me My Followers indeed when I walk the Streets of this  City  are  numerous  and if any of them should break the Peace what serves my  Lord Mayor  's Power for but to chastise them for it As for my self and my Adherents at home which as yet are  without Number  we are all  Quietists  and should act against our Consciences and Religion if we should injure any Man in his Person and Property But I smile to see a  Clergyman  all on a sudden like the  Bishop  so tender of the Welfare of the Publick when  Ecclesiasticks  in all Ages past have been the  Bane  of Society and the  Pest  of Mankind as appears from the Wars and Persecutions they have rais'd in the World and from that Strife Variance and Discords they have occasion'd in Citys and Familys And with Submission to the  Bishop  who I hope will not be angry for my saying it I am sure the  Clergy  at this Juncture  even darken'd and obscured the seemingly native simplicity of the Story of the Life of Jesus So leaving you to chew upon this I turn  My Address to  Infidels  particularly to the two most renown'd Writers of the Party Mr  Grounds  and Mr  Scheme  I should  Gentlemen  by Right salute you with the Title of  FreeThinkers  a proper Name for your Philosophical Sect who are for the free Exercise of your Reason about divine and speculative Points in Theology And I had distinguish'd you by this Title from your Apostatical Adversarys but that I had a Mind to oblige my old Friends the  Clergy  in giving you a no more honourable Title than I do them And I trust you will not be offended at the Title of  Infidels  since not only your Writings seem to have a Tendency to Infidelity but if there be any Fault in your Principles you know how to charge it on your Adversarys the pretended Advocates for Christianity whose Absurditys false Reasonings Inconsistencys and foolish Glosses on the Scriptures have occasion'd your departure from the Faith in Christ  I thank Mr  Scheme  for the noble Present of his Book which I received and read with Pleasure But instead of one  he should have sent me a  Dozen  for the Use of Friends and Borrowers who are very curious and importunate for the Perusal of it For what Reason He envys the  Booksellers  the publick Sale of his Work chusing rather to give it away  gratis  than that they should reap any Profit by it I know not Surely it is not to bring an  Odium  on the  Clergy  for Persecutors as if such an useful and philosophical Piece might not appear publickly without danger from them If so I hope the  Clergy  will resent the Indignity and invite him to a Publication of his Book with a Promise of Impunity which would wipe off the Reproach which this clandestine Method of disposing of it has cast on them  I once almost despair'd  Sirs  of seeing such another Piece from your Quarter I was afraid the Prosecution of the  Moderator  would have deterr'd you from the Press whereby our excellent Controversy on Foot must have been drop't But the sudden and unexpected appearance of Mr  Scheme  has revived me and rejoiced the Cockles of my Heart Go on then  Great Sirs  in this Controversy which Mr  Grounds  happily commenc'd and if you are deny'd the Liberty of the Press and publick Sale of your Books I hope you'll for all that as occasion  offers it self oblige the Learned and Curious with some more of your bright Lucubrations tho' you Print them and dispose of them in this clancular and subtile Method  It is not that I wish well to your Cause of Infidelity that I thus encourage you You have more Sense and Reason than to suspect me tainted with unbelieving Principles Christianity will stand its Ground against your battering Armour and the Church of Christ will be the more firmly establish'd on a Rock of Wisdom for that Opposition you make to it Tho' you will entirely vanquish the litteral  Schemists  and ride in Triumph over them yet other Defenders of the Faith call'd  Allegorists  will arise to your Confutation and final overthrow  If I am not mistaken  Sirs  your Adversarys the litteral  Schemists  whom I call  Apostates  are about making a Retreat and yeilding the Field of Battle to you The  Bishop  of  Lichfield  the greatest General on their Side will not only find it hard to levy any more Forces in Defence of his  twelve  litteral Prophecys but he knows that if he draw his Sword any more against you he must attack too the Authority of the Fathers for the allegorical Interpretation of some of those Prophecys  already urg'd in my  Supplements  to the  Moderator  or if the Fathers are neglected by him they and I keeping out of the Reach of his  BugPear  will treat him with such familiar Language as never was given to one of his Order  Mr  Scheme  seems to promise us a Discourse on the Miracles in the Scriptures I hope he'll be as good as his Word and 'ere long publish it This Discourse of mine can't possibly supersede his As I question not but his Thoughts and Remarks on Miracles will be very considerable so I shall be a little impatient till I see them But be his Discourse on Miracles of what Kind soever I believe it will hardly be an Obstruction to my Undertaking in Hand which I intend by Gods Leave to go on with to the Honour of the Holy  Jesus  our Spiritual  Mesiah  to whom be Glory and Praise for ever and ever Amen  FINIS  Books written by Mr  Woolston  and Sold by him near  Moregate  and the Booksellers of
