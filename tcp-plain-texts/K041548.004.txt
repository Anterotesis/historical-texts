ON EPIC POETRY  NOTES TO THE THIRD EPISTLE  NOTE I VERSE  AND smiles of triumph hid his mortal pang    An allusion to  ridens moriar  the close of the celebrated Northern Ode by the Danish king Regner Lodbrog a translation of which is inserted in the curious little volume of Runic poetry printed for Dodsley  Bartholin in his admirable Essay on the Causes which inspired the Danes with a Contempt of Death affirms that it was customary with the  Northern warriors to sing their own exploits in the close of life He mentions the example of a hero named Hallmundus who being mortally wounded commanded his daughter to attend while he composed a poem and to inscribe it on a tablet of wood  BARTHOLIN Lib i cap  NOTE II VERSE  And galls the ghostly tyrant with her lash    The poetry of Provence contains many spirited satires against the enormities of the Clergy The most remarkable is the bold invective of the Troubadour Guillaume Figueira in which he execrates the avarice and the cruelty of Rome The Papal cause found a female Poet to defend it Germonda of Montpellier composed a poetical reply to the satire of Figueira  See MILLOT's Hist des Troubadours vol ii p  NOTE III VERSE  Struck with illfated zeal the Latian lyre    There never was a century utterly destitute of ingenious and elegant Poets says the learned Polycarp Leiser after having patiently traced the obscure progress of Latin poetry through all the  dark ages Indeed the merit of some Latin Poets in a period that we commonly suppose involved in the grossest barbarism is singularly striking many of these are of the Epic kind and as they describe the manners and customs of their respective times a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work I shall briefly mention such as appear most worthy of notice  Abbo a Parisian monk of the Benedictine order wrote a poem on the siege of Paris by the Normans and the Danes at which he was present in the year it is printed in the second volume of Duchesne's Script Francorum and though it has little or no poetical merit may be regarded as an historical curiosity The following lines addressed to the city of Paris in the beginning of the work may serve as a specimen of its language  Dic igitur praepulchra polis quod Danea munus  Libavit tibimet soboles Plutonis amica  Tempore quo praesul domini et dulcissimus heros  Gozlinus temet pastorque benignus alebat  Haec inquit miror narrare potest aliquisne  Nonne tuis idem vidisti oculis refer ergo  Vidi equidem jussisque tuis parebo libenter  Leiser has confounded this Poet with another of this name but Fabricius has corrected the  mistake in his Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae Aetatis  Guido Bishop of Amiens from the year to wrote an Heroic poem on the exploits of William the Conqueror in which according to Ordericus Vitalis he imitated both Virgil and Statius William of Apulia composed at the request of Pope Urban the IId a poem in five books on the actions of the Normans in Sicily Apulia and Calabria to the death of Robert Guiscard their prince addressing his work to the son of that hero It was written between the years and first printed in to and again in Muratori's Script ItalDu Cange in his Notes to the Alexiad of the Princess Anna Comnena has illustrated that history by frequent and long quotations from William of Apulia but though the learned Critic gives him the title of Scriptor Egregius his poetry appears to me but a few degrees superior to that of the Monk Abbo whom I have just mentioned The Reader may judge from the following passage which I select not only as a specimen of the Author's style but as it shews that the wives of these martial Princes shared with them in all the perils of war  Uxor in hoc bello Roberti fortè sagittâ  Quâdam laesa fuit quae vulnere territa nullam  Dum sperabat opem se penè subegerat hosti  Navigio cujus se commendare volebat  Instantis metuens vicina pericula lethi  Hanc deus eripuit fieri ludibria nolens  Matronae tantae tam nobilis et venerandae  The Princess Comnena has also celebrated the fortitude which this Heroine whose name was Gaita displayed in the battle and it is remarkable that the royal female Historian describes the noble Amazon more poetically than the Latin Poet  Gualfredo an Italian who succeeded to the bishoprick of Siena in the year and died in wrote an Heroic poem on the expedition of Godfrey of Boulogne which is said to be still preserved in MS at Siena I believe Gualfredo is the first Poet in point of time who treated of the happy subject of the Crusades which was afterwards embellished by two very elegant writers of Latin verse Iscanus and Gunther of whom I shall presently speak and at length received its highest honour from the genius of Tasso There is also an early Latin poem on this subject the joint production of two writers named Fulco and Aegidius whom the accurate Fabricius places in the  beginning of the th century the title of the work is Historia Gestorum Viae nostri Temporis Hierosolymitanae It is printed in the fourth volume of Duchesne's Script Franc and with considerable additions in the third volume of Anecdota Edmundi Martene I transcribe part of the opening of this poem as the curious reader may have a pleasure in comparing it with that of Tasso  Ardor inest inquam sententia fixaque menti  Versibus et numeris transmittere posteritati  Qualiter instinctu deitatis et auspice cultu  Est aggressa via memorando nobilis actu  Qua sacrosancti violantes jura sepulchri  Digna receperunt meriti commercia pravi  Inque suis Francis antiqua resurgere Troja  Coepit et edomuit Christo contraria regna  I will only add the portrait of Godfrey  Inclytus ille ducum Godefridus culmen honosque  Omnibus exemplum bonitatis militiaeque  Sive hasta jaculans aequaret Parthica tela  Cominus aut feriens terebraret ferrea scuta  Seu gladio pugnans carnes resecaret et ossa  Sive eques atque pedes propelleret agmina densa  Hic inimicitiis cunctis sibi conciliatis  Cunctis possessis pro Christi pace relictis  Arripuit callem Christum sectando vocantem  The poem closes with the capture of Jerusalem  Laurentius of Verona who flourished about the year wrote an Heroic poem in seven books intitled Rerum in Majorica Pisanorum Edidit Ughellus tom Italiae sacrae  But in merit and reputation these early Latin Poets of modern time are very far inferior to Philip Gualtier de Chatillon who seems to have been the first that caught any portion of true poetic spirit in Latin verse He was Provost of the Canons of Tournay  Fabricius calls him Episcopus Magalonensis Bib Lat tom ii p  about the year according to Mr Warton who has given some specimens of his style in the second Dissertation prefixed to his admirable History of English Poetry I shall therefore only add that the best edition of his Alexandreid an Heroic poem in ten books on Alexander the Great was printed at Leyden to  The superior merit of Josephus Iscanus or  Joseph of Exeter has been also displayed by the same judicious Encomiast in the Dissertation I have mentioned nor has he failed to commemorate two Latin Epic Poets of the same period and of considerable merit for the time in which they livedGunther and William of Bretagny the first was a German monk who wrote after the year and has left various historical and poetical works particularly two of the Epic kindSolymarium a poem on the taking of Jerusalem by Godfrey of Bulloign and another intitled Ligurinus on the exploits of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa which he completed during the life of that Prince The first was never printed of the latter there have been several editions and one by the celebrated Melancthon in That his poetical merit was considerable in many respects will appear from the following verses in which he speaks of himself  Hoc quoque me famae si desint caetera solum  Conciliare potest quod jam per multa latentes  Saecula nec clausis prodire penatibus ausas  Pierides vulgare paro priscumque nitorem  Reddere carminibus tardosque citare poetas  William of Bretagny was preceptor to Pierre Charlot natural son of Philip Augustus King of France and addressed a poem to his pupil intitled Karlotis which is yet unpublished but his greater work called Philippis an Heroic poem in twelve books is printed in the collections of Duchesne and Pithaeus and in a separate to volume with a copious commentary by Barthius Notwithstanding the praises bestowed on this Author by his learned Commentator who prefers him to all his contemporaries he appears to me inferior in poetic spirit to his three rivals Gualtier de Chatillon Iscanus and Gunther Yet his work is by no means despicable in its style and may be considered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived for he was himself engaged in many of the scenes which he describes His profest design is to celebrate the exploits of Philip Augustus and he closes his poem with the death of that Monarch which happened in He addresses his work in two separate poetical dedications to Lewis the successor of Philip and to Pierre Charlot his natural son who was Bishop of Noyon in and died He seems to have been excited to this composition by the reputation of Gualtier's Alexandreid to which he thus alludes in the verses addressed to Lewis  Gesta ducis Macedum celebri describere versu  Si licuit Gualtere tibi quae sola relatu  Multivago docuit te vociferatio famae    Cur ego quae novi proprio quae lumine vidi  Non ausim magni magnalia scribere regis  Qui nec Alexandro minor est virtute nec illo  Urbi Romuleae totum qui subdidit orbem  He takes occasion also in two other parts of his poem to pay a liberal compliment to Gualtier to whom in poetical ability he confesses himself inferior but this inferiority his admirer Barthius will not allow Of their respective talents the reader may judge who will compare the passage which Mr Warton has cited from the Alexandreid with the following lines in which William of Bretagny uses the very simile of his predecessor comparing his hero Philip to a young lion  Rex dolet ereptum comitem sibi frendit et irae  Occultare nequit tectos sub pectore motus  Nam rubor in vultu duplicatus prodit aperte  Quam gravis illustrem trahit indignatio mentem  Qualiter in Lybicis spumante leunculo rictu  Saltibus ungue ferox et dentibus asper aduncis  Fortis et horrisonis anno jam penè secundo  Cui venatoris venabula forte per armos  Descendere levi stringentia vulnere corpus  Colla rigens hirsuta jubis desaevit in hostem  Jam retrocedentem nec eum tetigisse volentem  Cum nihil ex facto referat nisi dedecus illo  Nec mora nec requies quin jam deglutiat ipsum  Ni prudens hostis praetenta cuspide scuto  Unguibus objecto dum dat vestigia retrò  In loca se retrahat non irrumpenda leoni  Sic puer in comitem rex debacchatur et ipsum  Subsequitur presso relegens vestigia gressu  I will add the following passage from the eleventh Book as it contains an animated portrait and a simile more original than the preceding  At laevo in cornu qui nulli marte secundus  Bolonides pugnae insistit cui fraxinus ingens  Nunc implet dextram vix ulli bajula qualem  In Bacchi legimus portasse Capanea cunas  Quam vix fulmineo dejecit Jupiter ictu  Nunc culter vitae impatiens nunc sanguine pugni  Mucro rubens gemina e sublimi vertice fulgens  Cornua conus agit superasque eduxit in auras  E costis assumpta nigris quas faucis in antro  Branchia balenae Britici colit incola ponti  Ut qui magnus erat magnae superaddita moli  Majorem faceret phantastica pompa videri  Ac velut in saltus scopulosa Bieria saltu  Praecipiti mittit ingenti corpore cervum  Cujus multifidos numerant a cornibus annos  Mense sub Octobri nondum Septembre peracto  Annua quandò novis Venus incitat ignibus illum  Cursitat in cervos ramosa fronte minores  Omnibus ut pulsis victor sub tegmine fagi  Connubio cervam solus sibi subdat amatam  Haud secus e peditum medio quibus ipse rotundo  Ut castro cauta se circumsepserat arte  Prosiliens volat in Thomam Robertigenasque  Drocarum Comitem Belvacenumque Philippum  Bolonides  William of Bretagny had an immediate successor in Latin poetry who appears to have at least an equal portion of poetical spirit the name of this Author is Nicholas de Brai who wrote an Heroic poem on the actions of Louis the VIIIth after the death of that Monarch and addressed it to William of Auvergne who was Bishop of Paris from the year to As a specimen of his descriptive power I select the following lines which form part of a long description of a Goblet presented to the King on his accession  Parant intrare palatia regis  Magnifici cives gratissima dona ferentes  Tegmina quos ornant variis insculpta figuris  Et patrem patriae jucunda voce salutant  Et genibus flexis praesentant ditia dona    Offertur crater quem si sit credere dignum  Perditus ingenio fabricavit Mulciber auro  Margine crateris totus depingitur orbis  Et series rerum brevibus distincta figuris  Illic pontus erat tellus et pendulus aer  Ignis ad alta volans coeli supereminet illis  Quatuor in partes orbis distinguitur ingens  Circuit oceanus immensis fluctibus orbem  Ingenio natura suo duo lumina fecit  Fixa tenore poli mundi famulantia rebus  The Author proceeds to describe Thebes and Troy as they are figured on this superb Goblet and concludes his account of the workmanship with the four following lines of peculiar beauty for the age in which they appeared  Martis adulterium resupino margine pinxit  Mulciber et Venerem laqueis cum Marteligavit  Pluraque caelasset sub margine sed pudor illi  Obstat et ingentis renovatur causa doloris  This Poem which the author seems to have left imperfect is printed in the fifth volume of Duchesne's Script FrancorumEngland is said to have produced another Heroic Poet of confiderable merit who celebrated in Latin verse the exploits of Richard the First and who was called Gulielmus Peregrinus from his having attended that Prince to the Holy Land Leland mentions him by the name of Gulielmus de Canno and Pits calls him Poetarum sui temporis apud nostrates facile Princeps but I do not find that his Work was ever printed nor do the several biographical writers who speak of him inform us where it exists in MS  In Italy the Latin language is supposed to have been cultivated with still greater success and the restoration of its purity is in great measure ascribed to Albertino Mussato whose merits were first displayed to our country by the learned author of the Essay on PopeMussato was a Paduan of high rank and great talents but unfortunate He died in exile and left besides many smaller Latin pieces an Heroic Poem De Gestis Italorum post Henricum VII Caesarem seu de Obsidione Domini Canis Grandis de Verona circa Moenia Paduanae Civitatis et Conflictu ejusQuadrio from whom I transcribe this title says it is printed  in the tenth volume of Muratori Vossius who speaks of him as an Historian asserts that he commanded in the war which is the subject of his Poem  In a few years after the death of Mussato Petrarch received the laurel at Rome for his Latin Epic poem intitled Africa a performance which has sunk so remarkably from the high reputation it once obtained that the great admirer and encomiast of Petrarch who has published three entertaining quarto volumes on his life calls it  "Un ouvrage sans chaleur sans invention sans interet qui n'a pas meme le merite de la versification du style dont il est impossible de soutenir la lecture  I must observe however that Tasso in his Essay on Epic Poetry bestows a very high encomium on that part of Petrarch's Latin poem in which he celebrates the loves of Sophonisba and Masinissa and indeed the censure of this amiable French writer who in other points has done ample justice to the merits of Petrarch appears to me infinitely too severe There are many passages in this neglected Poem conceived with great force and imagination and expressed with equal elegance of language I shall select some verses from that part of it which has been honoured by the applause of Tasso The  following lines describe the anguish of the young Numidian Prince when he is constrained to abandon his lovely bride  Volvitur inde thoro quoniam sub pectore pernox  Saevit amor lacerantque truces praecordia curae  Uritur invigilant moeror metus ira furorque  Saepè absentem lacrymans dum stringit amicam  Saepè thoro dedit amplexus et dulcia verba  Postquam nulla valent violento fraena dolori  Incipit et longis solatur damna querelis  Cura mihi nimium vita mihi dulcior omni  Sophonisba vale non te mea cura videbo  Leniter aethereos posthac componere vultus  Effusosque auro religantem ex more capillos  Dulcia non coelum mulcentia verba Deosque  Oris odorati secretaque murmura carpam  Solus ero gelidoque insternam membra cubili  Atque utinam socio componat amica sepulchro  Et simul hic vetitos illic concorditer annos  Contingat duxisse mihi sors optima busti  Si cinis amborum commixtis morte medullis  Unus erit Scipio nostros non scindet amores  O utinam infernis etiam nunc una latebris  Umbra simus liceat pariter per claustra vagari  Myrtea nec nostros Scipio disjungat amores  Ibimus una ambo flentes et passibus iisdem  Ibimus aeterno connexi foedere nec nos  Ferreus aut aequos Scipio interrumpet amores  The wellknown catastrophe of the unfortunate Sophonisba is related with much poetical spirit The close of her life and her first appearance in the regions of the dead are peculiarly striking  Illa manu pateramque tenens lumina coelo  Attollens Sol alme inquit Superique valete  Masinissa vale nostri memor inde malignum  Ceu sitiens haurit non mota fronte venenum  Tartareasque petit violentus spiritus umbras    Nulla magis Stygios mirantum obsessa corona  Umbra lacus subiit postquam divisa triformis  Partibus hand aequis stetit ingens machina mundi  Obtutu attonito stabant horrentia circum  Agmina Poenarum sparsoque rigentia villo  Eumenidum tacitis inhiabant rictibus ora  Regia vis oculis inerat pallorque verendus  Et vetus egregia majestas fronte manebat  Indignata tamen superis irataque morti  Ibat et exiguo defigens lumina flexu  With Petrarch I may close this cursory review of the neglected authors who wrote Heroic poems  in Latin during the course of the dark agesA peculiar circumstance induces me to add another name to the preceding list John Abbot of Peterborough in the reign of Edward the Third wrote an Heroic poem intitled Bellum Navarrense de Petro rege Aragoniae Edwardo Principe This performance containing five hundred and sixty verses is said to be preserved in MS in the Bodleian Library and I have thought it worthy of notice because it treats of the very subject on which Dryden informs us he had once projected an Epic poem  Of the many Latin compositions of the Epic kind which later times have produced the Christiad of Vida the Sarcotis of Massenius and the Constantine of Mambrun appear to me the most worthy of regard but even these are seldom perused and indeed the Poet who in a polished age prefers the use of a dead language to that of a living one can only expect and perhaps only deserves the attention of a few curious sequestered students  NOTE IV VERSE  Thy daring Dante his wild Vision sung    Dante Allighieri was born at Florence in May of  an ancient and honourable family Boccacio who lived in the same period has left a very curious and entertaining Treatise on the Life the Studies and Manners of this extraordinary Poet whom he regarded as his master and for whose memory he professed the highest veneration This interesting biographer relates that Dante before he was nine years old conceived a passion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his singular Poem Her age was near his own and her name was Beatrice the daughter of Folco Portinari a noble citizen of Florence Of this fair one the best accounts are obscure Some refining commentators have even denied her corporeal existence affirming her to be nothing more or less than Theology but we may question if Theology was ever the mistress of so young a lover The passion of Dante however like that of his successor Petrach seems to have been of the chaste and Platonic kind according to the account he has himself given of it in one of his early productions intitled Vita Nuova a mixture of mysterious poetry and prose in which he mentions both the origin of his affection and the death of his mistress who according to Boccacio died at the age of twentyfour The same author asserts that Dante fell into a deep melancholy in consequence of this  event from which his friends endeavoured to raise him by persuading him to marriage After some time he followed their advice and repented it for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore some resemblance to the celebrated Xantippe The Poet not possessing the patience of Socrates separated himself from her with such vehement expressions of dislike that he never afterwards admitted her to his presence though she had borne him several childrenIn the early part of his life he gained some credit in a military character distinguishing himself by his bravery in an action where the Florentines obtained a signal victory over the citizens of Arezzo He became still more eminent by the acquisition of civil honours and at the age of thirtyfive he rose to be one of the chief magistrates of Florence when that dignity was conferred by the suffrages of the people From this exaltation the Poet himself dated his principal misfortunes as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by Lionardo Bruni one of his early biographers where Dante speaks of his political failure with that liberal frankness which integrity inspiresItaly was at that time distracted by the contending factions of the Ghibellins and the Guelphs the latter among whom Dante took an active part were again divided into the Blacks  and the Whites Dante says Gravina exerted all his influence to unite these inferior parties but his efforts were ineffectual and he had the misfortune to be unjustly persecuted by those of his own faction A powerful citizen of Florence named Corso Donati had taken measures to terminate these intestine broils by introducing Charles of Valois brother to Philip the Fair King of France Dante with great vehemence opposed this disgraceful project and obtained the banishment of Donati and his partizans The exiles applied to the Pope Boniface the VIIIth and by his assistance succeeded in their design Charles of Valois entered Florence in triumph and those who had opposed his admission were banished in their turn Dante had been dispatched to Rome as the ambassador of his party and was returning when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city His enemies availing themselves of his absence had procured an iniquitous sentence against him by which he was condemned to banishment and his possessions were confiscated His two enthusiastic biographers Boccacio and Manetti express the warmest indignation against this injustice of his countryDante on receiving the intelligence took refuge in Siena and afterwards in Arezzo where many of his party were assembled  An attempt was made to surprise the city of Florence by a small army which Dante is supposed to have attended the design miscarried and our Poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of Italy till he found a patron in the great Can della Scala Prince of Verona whom he has celebrated in his Poem The high spirit of Dante was ill suited to courtly dependence and he is said to have lost the favour of his Veronese patron by the rough frankness of his behaviour From Verona he retired to France according to Manetti and Boccacio affirms that he disputed in the Theological Schools of Paris with great reputation Bayle questions his visiting Paris at this period of his life and thinks it improbable that a man who had been one of the chief magistrates of Florence should condescend to engage in the public squabbles of the Parisian Theologists But the spirit both of Dante and the times in which he lived sufficiently account for this exercise of his talents and his residence in France at this season is confirmed by Boccacio in his life of our Poet which Bayle seems to have had no opportunity of consulting  The election of Henry Count of Luxemburgh to the empire in November afforded Dante a prospect of being restored to his native city as he attached himself to the interest of the new Emperor  in whose service he is supposed to have written his Latin treatise De Monarchia in which he asserted the rights of the Empire against the encroachments of the Papacy In the year he instigated Henry to lay siege to Florence in which enterprize says one of his Biographers he did not appear in person from motives of respect towards his native city The Emperor was repulsed by the Florentines and his death which happened in the succeeding year deprived Dante of all hopes concerning his reestablishment in Florence  After this disappointment he is supposed to have passed some years in roving about Italy in a state of poverty and distress till he found an honourable establishment at Ravenna under the protection of Guido Novello da Polenta the lord of that city who received this illustrious exile with the most endearing liberality continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life and extended his munificence to the ashes of the Poet  Eloquence was one of the many talents which Dante possessed in an eminent degree On this account he is said to have been employed on fourteen different embassies in the course of his life and to have succeeded in most of them His patron Guido had occasion to try his abilities in a service of this  nature and dispatched him as his ambassador to negociate a peace with the Venetians who were preparing for hostilities against Ravenna Manetti asserts that he was unable to procure a public audience at Venice and returned to Ravenna by land from his apprehensions of the Venetian fleet when the fatigue of his journey and the mortification of failing in his attempt to preserve his generous patron from the impending danger threw him into a fever which terminated in death on the th of September He died however in the palace of his friend and the affectionate Guido paid the most tender regard to his memory This magnificent patron says Boccacio commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments and after being carried on a bier through the streets of Ravenna by the most illustrious citizens to be deposited in a marble coffin He pronounced himself the funeral oration and expressed his design of erecting a splendid monument in honour of the deceased a design which his subsequent misfortunes rendered him unable to accomplish At his request many epitaphs were written on the Poet the best of them says Boccacio by Giovanni del Virgilio of Bologna a famous author of that time and the intimate friend of Dante Boccacio then cites a few Latin verses not  worth transcribing six of which are quoted by Bayle as the composition of Dante himself on the authority of Paul Jovius In Bernardo Bembo the father of the celebrated Cardinal raised a handsome monument over the neglected ashes of the Poet with the following inscription  Exigua tumuli Danthes hic sorte jacebas  Squallenti nulli cognita paenè situ  At nunc marmoreo subnixus conderis arcu  Omnibus et cultu splendidiore nites  Nimirum Bembus Musis incensus Etruscis  Hoc tibi quem in primis hae coluere dedit  Before this period the Florentines had vainly endeavoured to obtain the bones of their great Poet from the city of Ravenna In the age of Leo the Xth they made a second attempt by a solemn application to the Pope for that purpose and the great Michael Angelo an enthusiastic admirer of Dante very liberally offered to execute a magnificent monument to the Poet The hopes of the Florentines were again unsuccessful The particulars of their singular petition may be found in the notes to Condivi's Life of Michael Angelo  The person and manners of Dante are thus represented by the descriptive pen of Boccacio  "Fu adunque questo nostro Poeta di Mezzana statura e poichè alla matura età fu pervenuto andò alquanto gravetto ed era il suo andar grave e mansueto di onestissimi panni sempre vestito in quello abito che era alla sua matura età convenevole il suo volto fu lungo il naso aquilino gli occhi anzi grossi che piccioli le mascelle grandi e dal labbro di sotto era quel di sopra avanzato il colore era bruno i capelli e la barba spessi neri e  crespi e sempre nella faccia malinconico e pensosoNe costumi publici e domestici mirabilmente fu composto e ordinato più che niuno altro cortese e civile nel cibo e nel poto fu modestissimo  Though Dante is described as much inclined to melancholy and his genius particularly delighted in the gloomy and sublime yet in his early period of life he seems to have possessed all the lighter graces of sprightly composition as appears from the following airy and sportive sonnet  A GUIDO CAVALCANTI  Guido vorrei che tu e Lappo ed io  Fossimo presi per incantamento  E messi ad un vassel ch'ad ogni vento  Per mare andasse a voler vostro e mio  Sicché fortuna od altro tempo rio  Non ci potesie dare impedimento  Anzi vivendo sempre in noi talento  Di stare insieme crescesse 'l disio  E monna Vanna e monna Bice poi  Con quella su il numer delle trenta  Con noi ponesie il buono incantatore  E quivi ragionar sempre d' amore  E ciascuna di lor fosse contenta  Siccome io credo che sariamo noi  IMITATION  Henry I wish that you and Charles and I  By some sweet spell within a bark were plac'd  A gallant bark with magic virtue grac'd  Swift at our will with every wind to fly  So that no changes of the shifting sky  No stormy terrors of the watery waste  Might bar our course but heighten still our taste  Of sprightly joy and of our social tie  Then that my Lucy Lucy fair and free  With those soft nymphs on whom your souls are bent  The kind magician might to us convey  To talk of love throughout the livelong day  And that each fair might be as well content  As I in truth believe our hearts would be  These lively verses were evidently written before the Poet lost the object of his earliest attachment as she is mentioned by the name of Bice At what time and in what place he executed the great and singular work which has rendered him immortal his numerous Commentators seem unable to determine Boccacio asserts that he began it in his thirtyfifth year and had finished seven Cantos of his Inferno before his exile that in the plunder of his house on that event the beginning of his poem was fortunately preserved but remained for some time neglected till its merit being accidently discovered by an intelligent Poet named Dino it was sent to the Marquis Maroello Malespina an Italian nobleman by whom Dante was then protected The Marquis restored these lost papers to the Poet and entreated him to proceed in a work which opened in so promising a manner To this incident we are probably indebted for the poem of Dante which he must have continued under all the disadvantages of an unfortunate and agitated life It does not appear at what time he completed it perhaps before he quitted Verona as he dedicated the Paradise to his Veronese patronThe Critics have variously accounted for his having called his poem Comedia He gave it that title said one of his sons because it opens with distress and closes with felicity The very high  estimation in which this production was held by his country appears from a singular institution The republic of Florence in the year assigned a public stipend to a person appointed to read lectures on the poem of Dante Boccacio was the first person engaged in this office but his death happening in two years after his appointment his Comment extended only to the seventeen first Cantos of the Inferno The critical dissertations that have been written on Dante are almost as numerous as those to which Homer has given birth the Italian like the Grecian Bard has been the subject of the highest panegyric and of the grossest invective Voltaire has spoken of him with that precipitate vivacity which so frequently led that lively Frenchman to insult the reputation of the noblest writers In one of his entertaining letters he says to an Italian Abbé  "Je fais grand cas du courage avec lequel vous avez osé dire que Dante etoit un fou et son ouvrage un monstreLe Dante pourra entrer dans les bibliotheques des curieux mais il ne sera jamais lu"  But more temperate and candid Critics have not been wanting to display the merits of this original Poet Mr Warton has introduced into his last volume on English Poetry a judicious and spirited summary of Dante's performance We  have several versions of the celebrated story of Ugolino but I believe no entire Canto of Dante has hitherto appeared in our language though his whole work has been translated into French Spanish and Latin verse The three Cantos which follow were translated a few years ago to oblige a particular friend The Author has since been solicited to execute an entire translation of Dante but the extreme inequality of this Poet would render such a work a very laborious undertaking and it appears very doubtful how far such a version would interest our country Perhaps the reception of these Cantos may discover to  the Translator the sentiments of the public At all events he flatters himself that the ensuing portion of a celebrated poem may afford some pleasure from its novelty as he has endeavoured to give the English reader an idea of Dante's peculiar manner by adopting his triple rhyme and he does not recollect that this mode of versification has ever appeared before in our language it has obliged him of course to make the number of translated lines correspond exactly with those of the original The difficulties attending this metre will sufficiently shew themselves and obtain some degree of indulgence from the intelligent and candid reader  DELL' INFERNO  CANTO I  NEL mezzo del cammin di nostra vita  Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura  Che la diritta via era smarrita  E quanto à dir qual era è cosa dura  Questa selva selvaggia ed aspra e forte  Che nel pensier rinnuova la paura  Tanto è amara che poco è più morte  Ma per trattar del ben ch'i vi trovai  Dirò dell' altre cose ch'i v'ho scorte  I non so ben ridir com'i v'entrai  Tant'era pien di sonno in su quel punto  Che la verace via abbandonai  Ma po' ch'i fui al piè d'un colle giunto  Là ove terminava quella valle  Che m'avea di paura il cor compunto  Guarda'in alto e vidi le sue spalle  Vestite già de' raggi del pianeta  Che mena dritto altrui per ogni calle  Allor fu la paura un poco queta  Che nel lago del cor m'era durata  La notte ch'i passai con tanta pieta  E come quei che con lena affannata  Ufcito fuor del pelago alla riva  Si volge all'aqua perigliosa e guata  Cosi l'animo mio ch'ancor fuggiva  Si vols' à retro à rimirar lo passo  Che non lasciò giammai persona viva  Poi ch'ebbi riposato il corpo lasso  Ripresi via per la piaggia deserta  Si che 'l piè fermo sempre era 'l più basso  Ed ecco quasi al cominciar dell' erta  Una lonza leggiera e presta molto  Che di pel maculato era coperta  E non mi si partia dinanzi al volto  Anz' impediva tanto 'l mio cammino  Ch'i fu per ritornar piu volte volto  Temp' era dal principio del mattino  E 'l sol montava in su con quelle stelle  Ch' eran con lui quando l'amor divino  Mosse da prima quelle cose belle  Si ch'a bene sperar m'era cagione  Di quella fera la gaietta pelle  L'ora del tempo e la dolce stagione  Ma non si che paura non mi desse  La vista che m'apparve d'un leone  Questi parea che contra me venesse  Con la test'alta e con rabbiosa fame  Si che parea che l'aer ne temesse  Ed una lupa che di tutte brame  Sembiava carca con la sua magrezza  E molte genti fe' già viver grame  Questa mi porse tanto di gravezza  Con la paura ch'uscia di sua vista  Ch'i perde' la speranza dell' altezza  E quale è quei che volentieri acquista  E gingne 'l tempo che perder lo face  Che 'n tutt' i suoi pensier piange e s'attrista  Tal me fece la bestia senza pace  Che venendomi 'ncontro a poco a poco  Mi ripingeva là dove 'l sol tace  Mentre ch'i rovinava in basso loco  Dinanzi gli occhi mi si fu offerto  Chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco  Quando i' vidi costui nel gran diserto  Miserere di me gridai a lui  Qual che tu sii od ombra od uomo certo  Risposemi non uomo uomo già fui  E li parenti miei furon Lombardi  E Mantovani per patria amendui  Nacqui sub Julio ancorche fosse tardi  E vissi a Roma sotto 'l buono Agusto  Al tempo degli Dei falsi e bugiardi  Poeta fui e cantai di quel giusto  Figlioul d'Anchise che venne da Troja  Poichè 'l superbo Ilion fu combusto  Ma tu perchè ritorni à tanta noja  Perchè non sali il dilettoso monte  Ch'è principio e cagion di tutta gioja  Or se' tu quel Virgilio e quella fonte  Che spande di parlar sì largo fiume  Risposi lui con vergognosa fronte  Oh degli altri poeti onore e lume  Vagliami 'l lungo studio e'l grande amore  Che m'han fatto cercar lo tuo volume  Tu se' lo mio maestro e'l mio autore  Tu se' solo colui da cu'io tolsi  Lo bello stile che m'ha fatto onore  Vedi la bestia per cu'io mi volsi  Ajutami da lei famoso saggio  Ch'ella mi fa tremar le vene e i polsi  A te convien tenere altro viaggio  Rispose poichè lagrimar mi vide  Se vuoi campar d'esto luogo selvaggio  Che questa bestia per la qual tu gride  Non lascia altrui passar per la sua via  Ma tanto lo 'mpedisce che l'uccide  Ed ha natura sì malvagia e ria  Che mai non empie la bramosa voglia  E dopo 'l pasto ha più fame che pria  Molti son gli animali a cui s'ammoglia  E più saranno ancora infin che 'l veltro  Verrà che la farà morir di doglia  Questi non ciberà terra nè peltro  Ma spienza e amore e virtute  E sua nazion sarà tra Feltro e Feltro  Di quell' umile Italia fia salute  Per cui morío la Vergine Cammilla  Eurialo e Turno e Niso di ferute  Questi la caccerà per ogni villa  Fin chè l'avrà rimessa nello 'nferno  La onde 'nvidia prima dipartilla  Ond' io per lo tuo me' penso e discerno  Che tu mi segui ed io sarò tua guida  E trarrotti di qui per luogo eterno  Ov' udirai le disperate strida  Vedrai gli antiche spiriti dolenti  Che la seconda morte ciascun grida  E poi vedrai color che son contenti  Nel fuoco perchè speran di venire  Quando che sia alle beate genti  Alle qua' poi se tu vorrai salire  Anima fia a ciò di me più degna  Con lei ti lascerò nel mio partire  Che quello 'mperador che lassù regna  Perch' i' fu' ribellante alla sua legge  Non vuol che'n sua città per me si vegna  In tutte parti impera e quivi regge  Quivi è la sua cittade e l'alto seggio  O felice colui cu' ivi elegge  Ed io a lui Poeta i' ti rechieggio  Per quello Iddio che tu non conoscesti  Acciocch' i' fugga questo male e peggio  Che tu mi meni là dov'or dicesti  Sì ch' i' vegga la porta di san Pietro  E color che tu fai cotanto mesti  Alior si mosse ed io li tenni dietro  CANTO II  LO giorno se n'andava e l'aer bruno  Toglieva gli animai che sono 'n terra  Dalle fatiche loro ed io sol' uno  M'apparecchiava a sostener la guerra  Si del cammino e sì della pietate  Che ritrarrà la mente che non erra  O Muse o alto 'ngegno or

OF DANTE  CANTO I  IN the mid season of this mortal strife  I found myself within a gloomy grove  Far wandering from the ways of perfect life  The place I know not where I chanc'd to rove  It was a wood so wild it wounds me sore  But to remember with what ills I strove  Such still my dread that death is little more  But I will tell the good which there I found  High things 'twas there my fortune to explore  Yet how I enter'd on that secret ground  I know not to explain so much in sleep  My mortal senses at that hour were drown'd  But when I reach'd the bottom of a steep  That rose to terminate the dreary vale  Which made cold terrors thro' my bosom creep  I look'd on high where breath'd a purer gale  And saw the summit glisten with that ray  Which leads the wand'rer safe o'er hill and dale  This soon began to chase those fears away  Which held my struggling spirit bound so fast  During that night of darkness and dismay  And as th' exhausted wretch by fortune cast  Safe from the stormy deep upon the shore  Turns to survey the perils he has past  So turn'd my soul ere yet its dread was o'er  Back to contemplate that mysterious strait  Where living mortal never past before  Arising soon from this repose elate  Up the rough steep my journey I begin  My lower foot sustaining all my weight  Here while my toilsome way I slowly win  Behold a nimble Panther springs to sight  And beauteous spots adorn his motley skin  He at my presence shew'd no signs of fright  But rather strove to bar my doubtful way  I often turn'd and oft resolv'd on flight  'Twas now the chearful hour of rising day  The sun advanc'd in that propitious sign  Which first beheld his radiant beams display  Creation's charms the work of love divine  So that I now was rais'd to hope sublime  By these bright omens of a fate benign  The beauteous Beast and the sweet hour of prime  But soon I lost that hope and shook yet more  To see a Lion in this lonely clime  With open jaws athirst for human gore  He rush'd towards me in his hungry ire  Air seem'd to tremble at his savage roar  With him enflam'd with every fierce desire  A famish'd Shewolf like a spectre came  Beneath whose gripe shall many a wretch expire  Such sad oppression seiz'd my sinking frame  Such horror at these strange tremendous sights  My hopes to climb the hill no longer aim  But as the wretch whom lucre's lust incites  In the curst hour which scatters all his wealth  Sinks in deep sorrow dead to all delights  So was I robb'd of all my spirit's health  And to the quarter where the sun grows mute  Driven by this Beast who crept on me by stealth  While I retreated from her dread pursuit  A manly figure my glad eyes survey'd  Whose voice was like the whisper of a lute  Soon as I saw him in this dreary glade  Take pity on me to this form I cry'd  Be thou substantial man or fleeting shade  A man I was the gracious form reply'd  And both my parents were of Lombard race  They in their native Mantua liv'd and dy'd  I liv'd at Rome rich in a monarch's grace  Beneath the good Augustus' letter'd reign  While fabled Gods were serv'd with worship base  A Bard I was the subject of my strain  That just and pious Chief who sail'd from Troy  Sinking in ashes on the sanguine plain  But thou whom these portentous sights annoy  Why dost thou turn why not ascend the mount  Source of all good and summit of all joy  Art thou that Virgil thou that copious fount  Of richest eloquence so clear so bright  I answer'd blushing at his kind account  O thou of Poets the pure guide and light  Now let me profit by that fond esteem  Which kept thy song for ever in my sight  Thou art my Master thou my Bard supreme  From whom alone my fond ambition drew  That purer style which I my glory deem  O from this Beast so hideous to the view  Save me O save me thou muchhonour'd Sage  For growing terrors all my power subdue  A different road must lead thee from her rage  He said observant of my starting tears  And from this wild thy spirit disengage  For that terrific Beast which caus'd thy fears  Worries each wretch that in her road she spies  Till death at length his sole relief appears  So keen her nature sleep ne'er seals her eyes  Her ravenous hunger no repast can sate  Food only serves to make its fury rise  She calls from different animals her mate  And long shall she produce an offspring base  Then from a mighty victor meet her fate  Nor pomp nor riches shall that victor grace  But truth and love and all excelling worth  He from his rescu'd land all ill shall chase  The saviour of the realm that gives him birth  Of Italy for whom Camilla fell  And Turnus fighting for his native earth  And Nisus with the friend he lov'd so well  The Beast this victor to that den shall drive  Whence Envy let her loose her native hell  Now for thy good wellpleas'd I will contrive  That by my aid while I thy steps controul  Thou shalt in safety at those realms arrive  Where thou shalt see the tortur'd spirits roll  And hear each mourn his miserable fate  Calling for death on his immortal soul  Then shalt thou visit those who in a state  Of purifying fire are still content  And for their promis'd heaven submissive wait  If to that heaven thy happy course is bent  A worthier guard will soon my place supply  A purer spirit for thy guidance sent  For that Immortal Power who rules on high  Because I ne'er his perfect laws have known  His sacred presence will to me deny  There in the realms of light he fix'd his throne  There o'er the world Almighty Lord he reigns  O blest the servant whom he deigns to own  Poet I answer'd by thy living strains  And by that God tho' not reveal'd to thee  That I may 'scape from these and heavier pains  Be thou my leader where thy way is free  So that my eyes St Peter's gate may find  And all the wonders of the deep may see  He led and I attentive march'd behind  CANTO II  THE day was sinking and the dusky air  On all the animals of earth bestow'd  Rest from their labours I alone prepare  To meet new toil both from my dreary road  And pious wish to paint in worthy phrase  The Unerring Mind and his divine abode  O sacred Muses now my genius raise  O Memory who writest what I saw  From hence shall spring thy everduring praise  Kind Poet I began with trembling awe  Mark if my soul be equal to this aim  Nor into scenes too hard my weakness draw  Thy Song declares the Chief of pious fame  Appear'd among the blest retaining still  His mortal senses and material frame  Yet if the great Opposer of all ill  Shew'd grace to him as knowing what and who  Should from him rise and mighty things fulfil  Most worthy he appear'd in Reason's view  That Heaven should chuse him as the Roman Sire  Source of that empire which so widely grew  Mark'd in its growth by the angelic choir  To be the seat where Sanctity should rest  And Peter's heirs yet raise dominion higher  From his dark journey in thy Song exprest  He learn'd mysterious things from whence arose  Rome's early grandeur and the Papal vest  To Paul while living heaven's high powers disclose  Their secret bliss that he may thence receive  Strength in that faith from which salvation flows  But how may I this high exploit atchieve  I'm not Aeneas nor the holy Paul  Of this unworthy I myself believe  If then I follow at thy friendly call  Midway perchance my trembling soul may sink  Wise as thou art thou may'st foresee my fall  Now as a man who shudd'ring on the brink  Of some great venture sudden shifts his mind  And feels his spirit from the peril shrink  So in this scene of doubt and darkness join'd  Wavering I wasted thought in wild affright  And the first ardour of my soul resign'd  If thy faint words I understand aright  Reply'd the mighty and magnanimous shade  Those mists of fear have dimm'd thy mental sight  Which oft the seat of human sense invade  And make blind mortals from high deeds recoil  By Terror's airy phantasies betray'd  But that such fears thy soul no more may soil  I'll tell thee whence I came at whose request  When first I pitied thy uncertain toil  From the suspended host in which I rest  A lovely Spirit call'd me fair as light  Eager I waited on her high behest  While eyes beyond the solar radiance bright  And with the sweetness of an angel's tongue  Thus her soft words my willing aid invite  O ever gentle shade from Mantua sprung  Whose fame unfading on the earth shall last  As long as earth in ambient air is hung  My friend whose love all base desire surpast  In yon drear desart finds his passage barr'd  And compass'd round with terrors stands aghast  And much I fear beset with dangers hard  He may be lost beyond all friendly reach  And I from heaven descend too late a guard  But go and with thy soft soulsoothing speech  And all the aid thy wisdom may inspire  The ways of safety to this wanderer teach  My name is Beatrice the heavenly quire  For this I left tho' ever left with pain  But love suggested what I now desire  When I the presence of my lord regain  On thee my praises with delight shall dwell  So spake this angel in her heavenly strain  Bright Fair I cry'd who didst on earth excel  All that e'er shone beneath the lunar sphere  And every mind to virtuous love impel  Had I e'en now perform'd the task I hear  That swift performance I should think too slow  Nor needs there more your gracious will is clear  Yet how you venture I would gladly know  From those pure realms to which again you fly  So near the center of eternal woe  What you require she said in kind reply  I briefly will explain how thus I dare  Unconscious of alarm these depths to try  From these things only springs our fearful care  By which our hapless friends may suffer ill  But not from other for no fear is there  Such am I form'd by Heaven's most gracious will  That torture cannot touch my purer frame  E'en where fierce fires his flaming region fill  A gentle spirit Lucia is her name  In heaven laments the hardships of my friend  For whom I ask your aid to me she came  And kindly bade me to his woes attend  Behold she said thy servant in distress  And I his safety to thy care commend  Lucia the friend of all whom ills oppress  Me where I sate with pensive Rachel sought  In heavenly contemplation's deep recess  In mercy's name she cry'd thus lost in thought  Seest thou not him who held thy charms so dear  Whom Love to rise above the vulgar taught  And dost thou not his lamentation hear  Nor see the horror which his strength impairs  On yon wide torrent with no haven near  Never was mind intent on worldly cares  So eager wealth to gain or loss to shun  As when acquainted with these deadly snares  I flew from the blest confines of the sun  Trusting that eloquence which to thy name  And to thy followers such praise has won  She having thus explain'd her gracious aim  Turn'd her bright eyes which tears of pity fill  And hence more swift to thy relief I came  And pleas'd to execute her heavenly will  I sav'd thee from the fury of that Beast  Which barr'd thy journey up the brighter hill  Why then O why has all thy ardour ceas'd  And whence this faintness in thy feeble mind  Why has its noble energy decreas'd  When these pure Spirits for thy good combin'd  Watch o'er thy safety in their heavenly seat  And I reveal the favour thou shalt find  As tender flowers reviv'd by solar heat  That thro' the chilling night have sunk deprest  Rise and unfold the welcome ray to meet  So rose my spirit of new life possest  And my warm heart on high atchievements bent  I thus my animating guide addrest  Gracious that Spirit who thy succour sent  And friendly thou who freely hast display'd  Thy zeal to execute her kind intent  Thy soothing words have to my soul convey'd  Such keen desire to those bright realms to soar  I scorn the terror that my step delay'd  Now leadthy pleasure I dispute no more  My lord my master thou and thou my guard  I ended here and while he march'd before  The gloomy road I enter'd deep and hard  CANTO III  "THRO' me you pass to Mourning's dark domain  Thro' me to scenes where Grief must ever pine  Thro' me to Misery's devoted train  Justice and power in my Great Founder join  And love and wisdom all his fabrics rear  Wisdom above controul and love divine  Before me Nature saw no works appear  Save works eternal such was I ordain'd  Quit every hope all ye who enter here"  These characters where misty darkness reign'd  High o'er a lofty gate I saw engrav'd  Ah Sire said I hard things are here contain'd  He sapient Guide my farther question sav'd  With spirit answering "Here all doubt resign  All weak distrust and every thought deprav'd  At length we've reach'd that gloomy drear confine  Where as I said thou'lt see the mournful race  For ever robb'd of Reason's light benign"  Then stretching forth his hand with gentle grace  From whence new comfort thro' my bosom flows  He led me in to that mysterious place  There sighs and wailings and severest woes  Deeply resounded through the starless air  And as I first advanc'd my fears arose  Each different cry the murmuring notes of care  Accents of misery and words of ire  With all the sounds of discord and despair  To form such tumult in this scene conspire  As flies for ever round the gloomy waste  Like sand when quicken'd by the whirlwind's fire  I then my mind with error still disgrac'd  Exclaim'dO Sire what may this trouble mean  What forms are these by sorrow so debas'd  He soon reply'dBehold these bounds between  All who without or infamy or fame  Clos'd the blank business of their mortal scene  They join those angels of ignoble name  Who not rebell'd yet were not faithful found  Without attachment self alone their aim  Heaven shuts them out from its unsullied bound  And Hell refuses to admit this train  Lest e'en the damn'd o'er these their triumphs sound  O Sire said I whence then this grievous pain  That on our ears their lamentations grate  This he reply'd I will in brief explain  These have no hope that death may mend their fate  And their blind days form so confus'd a mass  They pine with envy of each other's state  From earth their name has perish'd like the grass  E'en Mercy views them with a scornful eye  We'll speak of them no more Behold and pass  I look'd and saw a banner rais'd on high  That whirl'd unconscious of a moment's stand  With rapid circles in the troubled sky  Behind it driven by Fate's supreme command  Came such a host I ne'er could have believ'd  Death had collected so complete a band  When now I had the forms of all perceiv'd  I saw the shade of that ignoble priest  Of sovereign power by indolence bereav'd  Instant I knew from every doubt releas'd  These were the base the miscreated crew  To whom the hate of God had never ceas'd  Vile forms ne'er honor'd with existence true  Naked they march'd and sorely were they stung  By wasps and hornets that around them flew  These the black blood from their gall'd faces wrung  Blood mixt with tears that trickling to their feet  Fed the fastidious worms which round them clung  When now I farther pierc'd the dark retreat  Numbers I saw beside a mighty stream  Sudden I cry'dNow Sire let me entreat  To know what forms in distant prospect seem  To pass so swiftly o'er a flood so wide  As I discern by this imperfect gleam  That shalt thou know return'd my gracious Guide  When the near respite from our toil we reach  On sullen Acheron's infernal tide  With downcast eyes that pardon now beseech  And hoping silence may that pardon win  E'en to the river I abstain'd from speech  And lo towards us with a shrivell'd skin  A hoary boatman steers his crazy bark  Exclaiming "Woe to all ye sons of sin  Hope not for heaven nor light's celestial spark  I come to waft you to a different lot  To Torture's realm with endless horror dark  And thou who living view'st this sacred spot  Haste to depart from these for these are dead"  But when he saw that I departed not  In wrath he cry'd "Thro' other passes led  Not here shalt thou attempt the farther shore  But in a bark to bear thy firmer tread"  O Charon said my Guide thy strife give o'er  For thus 'tis will'd in that superior scene  Where will is power Seek thou to know no more  Now grew the bearded visage more serene  Of the stern boatman on the livid lake  Whose eyes so lately glar'd with anger keen  But all the naked shades began to quake  Their shuddering figures grew more pale than earth  Soon as they heard the cruel words he spake  God they blasphem'd their parents' injur'd worth  And all mankind the place the hour that saw  Their first formation and their future birth  Then were they driven by Fate's resistless law  Weeping to that sad scene prepar'd for all  Who fear not God with pure devotion's awe  Charon with eyes of fire and words of gall  Collects his crew and high his oar he wields  To strike the tardy wretch who slights his call  As leaves in autumn thro' the woody fields  Fly in succession when each trembling tree  Its ling'ring honors to the whirlwind yields  So this bad race condemn'd by Heaven's decree  Successive hasten from that river's side  As birds which at a call to bondage flee  So are they wafted o'er the gloomy tide  And ere from thence their journey is begun  A second crew awaits their hoary guide  My gracious Master kindly saidMy son  All those who in the wrath of God expire  From every clime haste hither one by one  Nor would their terrors from this stream retire  Since heavenly justice so impels their mind  That fear is quicken'd into keen desire  Here may no spirit pass to good inclin'd  And hence if Charon seem'd to thwart thy will  Hence wilt thou deem his purpose not unkind  He paus'd and horrors of approaching ill  Now made the mournful troop so stand aghast  Their fears yet strike me with a deadly chill  The groaning earth sent forth a hollow blast  And flash'd a fiery glare of gloomy red  The horrid scene my fainting power surpast  I fell and as in sleep my senses fled  NOTE V VERSE  The gay Boccacio tempts th' Italian Muse    Boccacio was almost utterly unknown to our country as a Poet when two of our most accomplished Critics restored his poetical reputation  Mr Tyrwhitt to whom Chaucer is as deeply indebted as a Poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator has given a sketch of Boccacio's Theseida in his introductory discourse to the Canterbury Tales and Mr Warton has enriched the first volume of his History of English Poetry with a considerable specimen of this very rare Italian Epic poem of which our country is said to possess but a single copyThe father of Boccacio was an Italian merchant a native  of Certaldo near Florence who in his travels attached himself to a young woman of Paris and our Poet is supposed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection He was born in and educated as a student of the canon law but a sight of Virgil's tomb according to Filippo Villani his most ancient Biographer made him resolve to relinquish his more irksome pursuits and devote himself entirely to the Muses His life seems to have been divided between literature and love as he was equally remarkable for an amorous disposition and a passionate attachment to study His most celebrated mistress was Mary of Arragon the natural daughter of Robert King of Naples the generous and enthusiastic patron of Petrarch To this lady distinguished by the name  of The Fiammetta Boccacio addressed his capital poem the Theseida telling her in an introductory letter that it contained many allusions to the particular circumstances of their own secret attachment In his latter days he retired to Certaldo and died there in the year of a disorder supposed to have arisen from excessive application Few authors have rendered more essential service to the republic of letters than Boccacio as he not only contributed very much to the improvement of his native language but was particularly instrumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning a merit which he shared with Petrarch The tender and generous friendship which subsisted between these two engaging authors reflects the highest honour on both and their letters to each other may be ranked among the most interesting productions of that period Boccacio composed according to Quadrio no less than thirtyfour volumes His Novels are universally known his Poetical Works are as follow La Theseida in Ottava Rima L'Amorosa Visione in Terza Rima Il Filostrato in Ottava Rima Il Ninfale Fiesolano in Ottava RimaHe piqued himself on being the first Poet who sung of martial subjects in Italian verse and he has been generally supposed the inventor of the Ottava Rima the common Heroic measure  of the Italian Muse but Quadrio has shewn that it was used by preceding writers and Pasquier in his Recherches has quoted two stanzas of Thibaud King of Navarre written in the same measure on Blanch queen of France who died in The neglect into which the Poems of Boccacio had fallen appears the more striking as he peculiarly prided himself on his poetical character informing the world by an inscription on his tomb that Poetry was his favourite pursuitStudium fuit alma Poesis are the last words of the epitaph which he composed for himself  NOTE VI VERSE  She spoke exulting and Trissino sung    Giovanni Giorgio Trissino was born of a noble family in Vicenza he was particularly distinguished by a passion for Poetry and Architecture and one of the very few Poets who have been rich enough to build a palace This he is said to have done from a design of his own under the direction of the celebrated Palladio He had the merit of writing the first regular tragedy in the Italian language entitled Sophonisba but in his Epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed though some learned Critics and Gravina amongst them have  endeavoured to support the credit of that performance His subject was the expulsion of the Goths from Italy by Belisarius and his poem consists of twentyseven books in blank verse He addressed it to the Emperor Charles the Vth and professes in his Dedication to have taken Aristotle for his preceptor and Homer for his guide  The reader will excuse a trifling anachronism in my naming Trissino before Ariosto for poetical reasons The Italia Liberata of the former was first published in the Orlando Furioso in Trissino died at Rome Ariosto at Ferrara  NOTE VII VERSE  Of a poetic Sire the more poetic Son    The reputation of Torquato Tasso has almost eclipsed that of his father Bernardo who was himself a considerable Poet and left two productions of the Epic kind L'Amadigi and Il Floridante the latter remained unfinished at his death but was afterwards published in its imperfect state by his son who has spoken of his father's poetry with filial regard in his different critical works The Amadigi was written at the request of several Spanish  Grandees in the court of Charles the Vth and first printed in Venice by Giolito The curious reader may find an entertaining account of the Author's ideas in composing this work among his Letters volume the first page I cannot help remarking that the letter referred to contains a simile which Torquato has introduced in the opening of his Jerusalem Delivered  The Italians have formed a very pleasing and valuable work by collecting the letters of their eminent Painters which contain much information on points relating to their art The letters of their Poets if properly selected might also form a few interesting volumes as a proof of this I shall insert a short letter of the younger Tasso because it seems to have escaped the notice of his Biographers and relates the remarkable circumstance of his having deliberated on five different subjects before he decided in favour of Goffredo  Al M Illustre Sig Conte Ferrante Estense Tassone  Io ho scritto questa mattina a V S che io desidero di far due Poemi a mio gusto e sebben per elezione non cambierei il soggetto che una volta presi nondimeno per soddisfar il signor principe  gli do l' elezione di tutti questi soggetti i quali mi paijono sovra gli altri atti a ricever la forma eroica  Espedizion di Goffredo e degli altri principi contra gl' Infedeli e ritorno Dove avrò occasione di lodar le famiglie d' Europa che io vorrò  Espedizion di Belisario contra i Goti  Di Narsete contra i Goti e discorro d' un principe E in questi avrei grandissima occasione di lodar le cose di Spagna e d' Italia e di Grecia e l' origine di casa d' Austria  Espedizion di Carlo il magno contra Lansoni  Espedizion di Carlo contra i Longobardi In questi troverei l' origine di tutte le famiglie grandi di Germania di Francia e d' Italia e 'l ritorno d' un principe  E sebben alcuni di questi soggetti sono stati presi non importa perche io cercherei di trattargli meglio e a giudicio d' Aristotele  Opere di Torquato Tasso tom ix p  This letter is the more worthy of notice as the subject on which Tasso fixed has been called by Voltaire and perhaps very justly  Le plus grand qu'on ait jamais choisi  Le Tasse l'a traité dignement  adds the lively Critic with unusual candour  yet in his subsequent remarks he is peculiarly severe on the magic of the Italian Poet The merits of Tasso are very ably defended against the injustice of French criticism and particularly that of Boileau and Voltaire in the wellknown Letters on Chivalry and Romance Indeed the genius of this injured Poet seems at length to triumph in the country where he was most insulted as the French have lately attempted a poetical version of his Jerusalem  I enter not into the history of Tasso or that of his rival Ariosto because the public has lately received from Mr Hoole a judicious account of their lives prefixed to his elegant versions of their respective Poems  NOTE VIII VERSE  Shall gay Tassoni want his festive crown    Alessandro Tassoni the supposed inventor of the modern Heroicomic Poetry was born at Modena His family was noble but his parents dying during his infancy left him exposed to vexatious lawsuits which absorbed a great part of his patrimony and rendered him dependant In he was engaged as Secretary to Cardinal Ascanio  Colonna whom he attended on an embassy into Spain He was occasionally dispatched into Italy on the service of that Prelate and in the course of one of these expeditions wrote his Observations on Petrarch In he is supposed to have quitted the service of the Cardinal and to have lived in a state of freedom at Rome where in he became the chief of a literary society intitled Academia degli Umoristi He was afterwards employed in the service of Charles Emanuel Duke of Savoy which after suffering many vexations in it he quitted with a design of devoting himself to study and retirement But this design he was induced to relinquish and to serve the Cardinal Lodovisio nephew of Pope Gregory XV from whom he received a considerable stipend On the death of this patron in he was recalled to his native city by Francis the First Duke of Modena and obtained an honourable establishment in the court of that Prince Age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune his health declined in the year of his return and he expired in April His genius was particularly disposed to lively satire and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increase that disposition After having passed many vexatious and unprofitable years in  the service of the Great he had his portrait painted with a fig in his hand and Muratori supposes him to have written these two lines on the occasion  Dextera cur ficum quaeris mea gestet inanem  Longi operis merces haec fuit aula dedit  His celebrated Poem La Secchia rapita was written as he has himself declared in begun in April and finished in October It was circulated in MS received with the utmost avidity and first printed at Paris In a catalogue of the numerous editions of the Secchia which Muratori has prefixed to his Life of Tassoni he includes an English translation of it printed  NOTE IX VERSE  And rashly judges that her Vega's lyre    The famous Lope de Vega frequently called the Shakespear of Spain is perhaps the most fertile Poet in the annals of Parnassus and it would be difficult to name any author ancient or modern so universally idolized while living by all ranks of people and so magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the Great He was the son of Felix de Vega and Francisca Fernandez who were both descended from honourable  families and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid Our Poet was born in that city on the th of November He was according to his own expression a Poet from his cradle and beginning to make verses before he had learned to write he used to bribe his elder schoolfellows with a part of his breakfast to commit to paper the lines he had composed Having lost his father while he was still a child he engaged in a frolic very natural to a lively boy and wandered with another lad to various parts of Spain till having spent their money and being conducted before a magistrate at Segovia for offering to sell a few trinkets they were sent home again to Madrid Soon after this adventure our young Poet was taken under the protection of Geronimo Manrique Bishop of Avila and began to distinguish himself by his dramatic compositions which were received with great applause by the public though their author had not yet completed his education for after this period he became a member of the university of Alcala where he devoted himself for four years to the study of philosophy He was then engaged as Secretary to the Duke of Alva and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron who is frequently mentioned in his Occasional Poems He quitted that employment on his marriage with Isabel de  Urbina a lady says his friend and biographer Perez de Montalvan beautiful without artifice and virtuous without affectation His domestic happiness was soon interrupted by a painful incidentHaving written some lively verses in ridicule of a person who had taken some injurious freedom with his character he received a challenge in consequence of his wit and happening in the duel which ensued to give his adversary a dangerous wound he was obliged to fly from his family and shelter himself in Valencia He resided there a considerable time but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid His wife died in the year of his return His affliction on this event led him to relinquish his favourite studies and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the invasion of England He had a brother who served in that fleet as a lieutenant and being shot in an engagement with some Dutch vessels his virtues were celebrated by our afflicted Poet whose heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection After the ill success of the Armada the disconsolate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid and became Secretary to the Marquis of Malpica to whom he has addressed a grateful Sonnet From the service of this Patron he passed into the household of the Count of Lemos whom he celebrates as an inimitable  Poet He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the Great for the more inviting comforts of a married life His second choice was Juana de Guardio of noble birth and singular beauty By this lady he had two children a son who died in his infancy and a daughter named Feliciana who survived her father The death of his little boy is said to have hastened that of his wife whom he had the misfortune to lose in about seven years after his marriage Having now experienced the precariousness of all human enjoyments he devoted himself to a religious life and fulfilled all the duties of it with the most exemplary piety still continuing to produce an astonishing variety of poetical compositions His talents and his virtues procured him many unsolicited honours Pope Urban the VIIIth sent him the Cross of Malta with the title of Doctor in Divinity and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apostolic Chamber favours for which he expressed his gratitude by dedicating his Corona Tragica a long poem on the fate of Mary Queen of Scots to that liberal Pontiff In his seventythird year he felt the approaches of death and prepared himself for it with the utmost composure and devotion His last hours were attended by many of his intimate friends and particularly his chief patron the Duke of Sessa whom  he made his executor leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana and of his various manuscripts The manner in which he took leave of those he loved was most tender and affecting He said to his Disciple and Biographer Montalvan That true fame consisted in being good and that he would willingly exchange all the applauses he had received to add a single deed of virtue to the actions of his life Having given his dying benediction to his daughter and performed the last ceremonies of his religion he expired on the th of August  The splendor of his funeral was equal to the respect paid to him while livingHis magnificent patron the Duke of Sessa invited the chief nobility of the kingdom to attend it The ceremony was prolonged through the course of several days and three sermons in honour of the deceased were delivered by three of the most celebrated preachers These are printed with the works of the Poet and may be considered as curious specimens of the false eloquence which prevailed at that time A volume of encomiastic verses chiefly Spanish and written by more than a hundred and fifty of the most distinguished characters in Spain was published soon after the death of this lamented Bard To this collection his friend and disciple Perez de  Montalvan prefixed a circumstantial account of his life and death which I have chiefly followed in the preceding narrative An ingenious Traveller who has lately published a pleasing volume of Letters on the Poetry of Spain has imputed the duel in which Lope de Vega was engaged to the gallantries of his first wife but Montalvan's relation of that adventure clears the honor of the lady whose innocence is still farther supported by a poem written in her praise by Pedro de Medina Medinilla it is printed in the works of our Poet who is introduced in it under the name of Belardo celebrating the excellencies and lamenting the loss of his departed Isabel  Of the person and manners of Lope de Vega his friend Montalvan has only given this general accountthat his frame of body was particularly strong and preserved by temperance in continued healththat in conversation he was mild and unassuming courteous to all and to women peculiarly gallantvery eager when engaged in the business of his friends and somewhat careless in the management of his own Of his wealth and charity I shall have occasion to speak in a subsequent note The chief expences in which he indulged himself were books and pictures of the latter he distributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends  to the Duke of Sessa a fine portrait of himself and to me says Montalvan another painted when he was young surrounded by dogs monkies and other monsters and writing in the midst of them without attending to their noiseOf the honours paid to this extraordinary Poet his Biographer asserts that no person of eminence visited Spain without seeking his personal acquaintance that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the streets and women saluted him with benedictions when he passed under their windows If such homage can be deserved by the most unwearied application to poetry Lope de Vega was certainly entitled to it He declared that he constantly wrote five sheets a day and his biographers who have formed a calculation from this account conclude the number of his verses to be no less than His country has very lately published an elegant edition of his poems in quarto volumes his dramatic works are to be added to this collection and will probably be still more voluminous I shall speak only of the formerAmong his poems there are several of the Epic kind the three following appear to me the most remarkable La Dragontea La Hermosura de Angelica La Jerusalem Conquistada The Dragontea consists of ten cantos on the last expedition  and death of our great naval hero Sir Francis Drake whom the Poet from his excessive partiality to his country considers as an avaricious pirate or rather as he chuses to call him a marine Dragon and it may be sufficient to observe that he has treated him accordingly The poem on Angelica seems to have been written in emulation of Ariosto and it is founded on a hint in that Poet it was composed in the early part of our Author's life and contains many compliments to his sovereign Philip the IId it consists of cantos and closes with Angelica's being restored to her beloved Medoro In his Jerusalem Conquistada he enters the lists with Tasso whom he mentions in his preface as having sung the first part of the history which he had chosen for his subject From the great name of Lope de Vega I had some thoughts of presenting to the reader a sketch of this his most remarkable poem but as an Epic Poet he appears to me so much inferior to Tasso and to his countryman and cotemporary Ercilla that I am unwilling to swell these extensive notes by an enlarged description of so unsuccessful a work the Author has prophesied in the close of it that although neglected by his own age it would be esteemed by futuritya singular proof that even the most favoured writers are frequently disposed to declaim against the period in which they  live If Lope de Vega could think himself neglected what Poet may ever expect to be satisfied with popular applauseBut to return to his Jerusalem Conquistada Richard the Second of England and Alphonso the Eighth of Castile are the chief heroes of the poem which contains twenty cantos and closes with the unfortunate return of these confederate Kings and the death of Saladin It was first printed more than twenty years after the first appearance of Tasso's JerusalemOne of the most amiable peculiarities in the character of Lope de Vega is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals In his Laurel de Apolo he celebrates all the eminent Spanish and Portugueze Poets he speaks both of Camoens and Ercilla with the warmest applause Among the most pleasing passages in this poem is a compliment which he pays to his father who was like the father of Tasso a Poet of considerable talents  Among the smaller pieces of Lope de Vega there are two particularly curious a descriptive poem on the garden of his patron the Duke of Alva and a sonnet in honour of the Invincible Armada The latter may be considered as a complete model of Spanish bombast  "Go forth and burn the world"  says the Poet addressing himself to that  mighty fleet  "my sighs will furnish your sails with a neverfailing wind and my breast will supply your cannon with inexhaustible fire"  Perhaps this may be equalled by a Spanish character of our Poet with which I shall close my imperfect account of him It is his friend and biographer Montalvan who in the opening of his life bestows on him the following titles El Doctor Frey Lope Felix de Vega Carpio Portento del Orbe Gloria de la Nacion Lustre de la Patria Oracula de la Lengua Centro de la Fama Assumpio de la Invidia Cuydado de la Fortuna Fenix de los Siglos Principe de los Versos Orfeo de las Ciencias Apolo de las Musas Horacio de los Poetas Virgilio de los Epicos Homero de los Heroycos Pindaro de los Lyricos Sofocles de los Tragicos y Terencio de los Comicos Unico entre los Mayores Mayor entre los Grandes y Grande a todas Luzes y en todas Materias  NOTE X VERSE  The brave Ercilla sounds with potent breath  His Epic trumpet in the fields of death    Don Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuniga was equally distinguished as a Hero and a Poet but this exalted character notwithstanding his double claim to our  regard is almost totally unknown in our country and I shall therefore endeavour to give the English reader the best idea that I can both of his gallant life and of his singular poemHe was born in Madrid on the th of August the third son of Fortun Garcia de Ercilla who tho' descended from a noble family pursued the profession of the law and was so remarkable for his talents that he acquired the appellation of  "The subtle Spaniard"  The mother of our Poet was also noble and from her he inherited his second title Zuniga Ercilla was the name of an ancient castle in Biscay which had been long in the possession of his paternal ancestors He lost his father while he was yet an infant a circumstance which had great influence on his future life for his mother was received after the decease of her husband into the household of the Empress Isabella the wife of Charles the Vth and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young Alonzo into the palace He soon obtained an appointment there in the character of page to the Infant Don Philip to whose service he devoted himself with the most heroic enthusiasm though Philip was a master who little deserved so generous an attachment At the age of fourteen he attended that Prince in the splendid progress which he made at the desire of his Imperial father  through the principal cities of the Netherlands and through parts of Italy and Germany This singular expedition is very circumstantially recorded in a folio volume by a Spanish historian named Juan Christoval Calvete de Estrella whose work affords a very curious and striking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and romantic age All the cities which were visited by the Prince contended with each other in magnificent festivity the brilliant series of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited though they answered not their design of conciliating the affection of the sullen Philip might probably awaken the genius of our youthful Poet and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame In he returned with the Prince into Spain and continued there for three years at the end of which he attended his royal master to England on his marriage with Queen Mary which was celebrated at Winchester in the summer of At this period Ercilla first assumed the military character for his sovereign received advice during his residence at London that the martial natives of Arauco a district on the coast of Chile had revolted from the Spanish government and dispatched an experienced officer named Alderete who attended him in England to subdue  the insurrection investing him with the command of the rebellious province Ercilla embarked with Alderete but that officer dying in his passage our Poet proceeded to Lima Don Hurtado de Mendoza who commanded there as Viceroy of Peru appointed his son Don Garcia to supply the place of Alderete and sent him with a considerable force to oppose the Araucanians Ercilla was engaged in this enterprize and greatly distinguished himself in the obstinate contest which ensued The noble character of the Barbarians who maintained this unequal struggle and the many splendid feats of valour which this scene afforded led our author to the singular design of making the war in which he was himself engaged the subject of an Heroic poem which he intitled "La Araucana" from the name of the country As many of his own particular adventures may be found in the following summary of his work I shall not here enlarge on his military exploits but proceed to one of the most mortifying events of his life which he briefly mentions in the conclusion of his poem After passing with great honour through many and various perils he was on the point of suffering a disgraceful death from the rash orders of his young and inconsiderate Commander On his return from an expedition of adventure and discovery to  the Spanish city of Imperial he was present at a scene of public festivity displayed there to celebrate the accession of Philip the IId to the crown of Spain At a kind of tournament there arose an idle dispute between Ercilla and Don Juan de Pineda in the heat of which the two disputants drew their swords many of the spectators joined in the broil and a report arising that the quarrel was a mere pretence to conceal some mutinous design the hasty Don Garcia their General committed the two antagonists to prison and sentenced them both to be publicly beheaded Ercilla himself declares he was conducted to the scaffold before his precipitate judge discovered the iniquity of the sentence but his innocence appeared just time enough to save him and he seems to have been fully reinstated in the good opinion of Don Garcia as among the complimentary sonnets addressed to Ercilla there is one which bears the name of his General in which he styles him the Divine Alonzo and celebrates both his military and poetical genius But Ercilla seems to have been deeply wounded by this affront for quitting Chile he went to Callao the port of Lima and there embarked on an expedition against a Spanish rebel named Lope de Aguirre who having murdered his captain and usurped the chief power was perpetrating the most  cruel enormities in the settlement of Venezuela But Ercilla learned on his arrival at Panama that this barbarous usurper was destroyed he therefore resolved as his health was much impaired by the hardships he had passed to return to Spain He arrived there in the twentyninth year of his age but soon left it and travelled as he himself informs us through France Italy Germany Silesia Moravia and Pannonia but the particulars of this expedition are unknown In the year he appeared again at Madrid and was married to Maria Bazan a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the course of his military poem He is said to have been afterwards gentleman of the bedchamber to the Emperor Rodolph the IId a prince who had been educated at Madrid but the connection of our Poet with this Monarch is very indistinctly recorded and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known In the year he resided at Madrid in a state of retirement and poverty The time and circumstances of his death are uncertain it is proved that he was living in the year by the evidence of a Spanish writer named Mosquera who in a treatise of military discipline speaks of Ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of Don Alvaro Bazan Marques de Santa Cruz in a poem which has never appeared and is  supposed to have been left imperfect at his death Some anecdotes related of our Poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits were not entirely unrewarded It is said that in speaking to his sovereign Philip he was so overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him  "Don Alonzo"  replied the King  "speak to me in writing"  He did so and obtained his requestThe Spanish Historian Ovalle who has written an account of Chile in which he frequently supports his narration by the authority of Ercilla affirms that our Poet presented his work to Philip with his own hand and received a recompence from the King But in this circumstance I fear the Historian was mistaken as he supposes it to have happened on the return of Ercilla from Chile and our Poet in a distinct portion of his work which was not published till many years after that period expressly declares in addressing himself to Philip that all his attempts to serve him had been utterly unrequited Ercilla left no legitimate family but had some natural children the most eminent of which was a daughter who was advantageously married to a nobleman of Portugal  In that elegant collection of Spanish Poets "  Parnaso Espanol  " there is a pleasing little amorous poem written by Ercilla in his youth  which is peculiarly commended by Lope de Vega who has bestowed a very generous encomium on our Poet in his "  Laurel de Apolo  " But the great and singular work which has justly rendered Ercilla immortal is his Poem intitled Araucana which was published in three separate parts the first appeared in he added the second in the succeeding year and in he printed a complete edition of the whole It was applauded by the most eminent writers of Spain and Cervantes in speaking of Don Quixote's Library has ranked it among the choicest treasures of the Castilian Muse Voltaire who speaks of Ercilla with his usual spirit and inaccuracy has the merit of having made our Poet more generally known though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely slight for he affirms that Ercilla was in the battle of Saint Quintin a mistake into which he never could have fallen had he read the Araucana Indeed the undistinguishing censure which he passes on the poem in general after commending one particular passage sufficiently proves him a perfect stranger to many subsequent parts of the work yet his remark on the inequality of the Poet is just Ercilla is certainly unequal but with all his defects he appears to me one of the most extraordinary  and engaging characters in the poetical world Perhaps I am a little partial to him from the accidental circumstance of having first read his poem with a departed friend whose opinions are very dear to me and who was particularly fond of this military Bard However this may be my idea of Ercilla's merit has led me to hazard the following extensive sketch of his workit has swelled to a much larger size than I at first intended for I was continually tempted to extend it by the desire of not injuring the peculiar excellencies of this wonderful Poet If I have not utterly failed in that desire the English reader will be enabled to judge and to enjoy an author who considering his subject and its execution may be said to stand single and unparalleled in the host of Poets His beauties and his defects are of so obvious a nature that I shall not enlarge upon them but let it be remembered that his poem was composed amidst the toils and perils of the most fatiguing and hazardous service and that his verses were sometimes written on scraps of leather from the want of better materials His style is remarkably pure and perspicuous and notwithstanding the restraint of rhyme it has frequently all the ease the spirit and the volubility of Homer I wish not however  to conceal his defects and I have therefore given a very fair account of the strange episode he introduces concerning the history of Dido which has justly fallen under the ridicule of Voltaire I must however observe as an apology for Ercilla that many Bards of his country have considered it as a point of honour to defend the reputation of this injured lady and to attack Virgil with a kind of poetical Quixotism for having slandered the chastity of so spotless a heroine If my memory does not deceive me both Lope de Vega and Quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of Dido We may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively Frenchman against our Poet on this occasion but let us recollect that Ercilla has infinitely more Homeric spirit and that his poem contains more genuine Epic beauties than can be found in Voltaire  Ercilla has been honoured with many poetical encomiums by the writers of his own country and as I believe the most elegant compliment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a Spanish lady I shall close this account of him with a translation of the Sonnet in which she celebrates both the Hero and the Poet  SONETO DE LA SEN̄ORA DON̄A LEONOR DE ICIZ SEN̄ORA DE LA BARONIA DE RAFALES A DON ALONSO DE FRCILLA  Mil bronces para estatuas ya forxados  Mil lauros de tus obras premio honroso  Te ofrece Espan̄a Ercilla generoso  Por tu pluma y tu lanza tan ganados  Hourese tu valor entre soldados  Invidie tu nobleza el valeroso  Y busque en tí el poeta mas famoso  Lima para sus versos mas limados  Derrame por el mundo tus loores  La fama y eternice tu memoria  Porque jamás el tiempo la consuma  Gocen ya sin temor de que hay mayores  Tus hechos y tus libros de igual gloria  Pues la han ganado igual la espada y pluma  SONNET FROM THE LADY LEONORA DE ICIZ BARONESS OF RAFALES TO DON ALONZO DE ERCILLA  Marble that forms the Hero's mimic frame  And laurels that reward the Poet's strain  Accept Ercilla from thy grateful Spain  Thy sword and pen alike this tribute claim  Our Warriors honour thy heroic name  Thy birth is envy'd by Ambition's train  Thy verses teach the Bard of happiest vein  A finer polish and a nobler aim  May glory round the world thy merit spread  In Memory's volume may thy praises stand  In characters that time shall ne'er destroy  Thy songs and thy exploits without the dread  To be surpass'd by a superior hand  With equal right their equal fame enjoy  A SKETCH OF THE ARAUCANA  THE Poem of Ercilla opens with the following exposition of his subject  I Sing not love of ladies nor of sights  Devis'd for gentle dames by courteous knights  Nor feasts nor tourneys nor that tender care  Which prompts the Gallant to regale the Fair  But the bold deeds of Valour's fav'rite train  Those undegenerate sons of warlike Spain  Who made Arauco their stern laws embrace  And bent beneath their yoke her untam'd race  Of tribes distinguish'd in the field I sing  Of nations who disdain the name of King  Courage that danger only taught to grow  And challenge honour from a generous foe  And persevering toils of purest fame  And feats that aggrandize the Spanish name  For the brave actions of the vanquish'd spread  The brightest glory round the victor's head  He then addresses his work to his sovereign Philip the Second and devotes his first Canto to the description of that part of the New World which forms the scene of his action and is called Arauco  a district in the province of Chile He paints the singular character and various customs of its warlike inhabitants with great clearness and spirit In many points they bear a striking resemblance to the ancient Germans as they are drawn with a kind of poetical energy by the strong pencil of Tacitus The first Canto closes with a brief account how this martial province was subdued by a Spanish officer named Valdivia with an intimation that his negligence in his new dominion gave birth to those important exploits which the Poet proposes to celebrate  CANTO II  ERCILLA begins his Cantos much in the manner of Ariosto with a moral reflection sometimes rather too much dilated but generally expressed in easy elegant and spirited verseThe following lines faintly imitate the two first stanzas of his second Canto  Many there are who in this mortal strife  Have reach'd the slippery heights of splendid life  For Fortune's ready hand its succour lent  Smiling she rais'd them up the steep ascent  To hurl them headlong from that lofty seat  To which she led their unsuspecting feet  E'en at the moment when all fears disperse  And their proud fancy sees no sad reverse  Little they think beguil'd by fair sucess  That Joy is but the herald of Distress  The hasty wing of Time escapes their sight  And those dark evils that attend his flight  Vainly they dream with gay presumption warm  Fortune for them will take a steadier form  She unconcern'd at what her victims feel  Turns with her wonted haste her fatal wheel  After blaming his countrymen for abusing their good fortune the Poet celebrates in the following spirited manner the eagerness and indignation with which the Indians prepared to wreak their vengeance on their Spanish oppressors  The Indians first by novelty dismay'd  As Gods rever'd us and as Gods obey'd  But when they found we were of woman born  Their homage turn'd to enmity and scorn  Their childish error when our weakness show'd  They blush'd at what their ignorance bestow'd  Fiercely they burnt with anger and with shame  To see their masters but of mortal frame  Disdaining cold and cowardly delay  They seek atonement on no distant day  Prompt and resolv'd in quick debate they join  To form of deep revenge their dire design  Impatient that their bold decree should spread  And shake the world around with sudden dread  Th' assembling Chieftains led so large a train  Their ready host o'erspread th' extensive plain  No summons now the soldier's heart requires  The thirst of battle every breast inspires  No pay no promise of reward they ask  Keen to accomplish their spontaneous task  And by the force of one avenging blow  Crush and annihilate their foreign foe  Of some brave Chiefs who to this council came  Well may'st thou Memory preserve the name  Tho' rude and savage yet of noble soul  Justly they claim their place on Glory's roll  Who robbing Spain of many a gallant son  In so confin'd a space such victories won  Whose fame some living Spaniards yet may spread  Too well attested by our warlike dead  The Poet proceeds to mention in the manner of Homer but in a much shorter catalogue the principal chieftains and the number of their respective vassals  Uncouthly as their names must sound to an English ear it seems necessary to run through the list as these free and nobleminded savages act so distinguished a part in the course of the poemTucapel stands first renowned for the most inveterate enmity to the Christians and leader of three thousand vassals Angol a valiant youth attended by four thousand Cayocupil with three and Millarapue an elder chief with five thousand Paycabi with three thousand and Lemolemo with six Maregnano Gualèmo and Lebopia with three thousand each Elicura distinguished by strength of body and detestation of servitude with six thousand and the ancient Colocolo with a superior number Ongolmo with four thousand and Puren with six the fierce and gigantic Lincoya with a still larger train Peteguelen lord of the valley of Arauco prevented from personal attendance by the Christians dispatches six thousand of his retainers to the assembly the most distinguished of his party are Thomè and Andalican The Lord of the maritime province of Pilmayquen the bold Caupolican is also unable to appear at the opening of the council Many other Chieftains attended whose names the Poet suppresses lest his prolixity should offend As they begin their business in the style of the ancient  Germans with a plentiful banquet they soon grow exasperated with liquor and a violent quarrel ensues concerning the command of the forces for the projected war an honour which almost every chieftain was arrogant enough to challenge for himself In the midst of this turbulent debate the ancient Colocolo delivers the following harangue which Voltaire prefers and I think with great justice to the speech of Nestor on a similar occasion in the first Iliad  Assembled Chiefs ye guardians of the land  Think not I mourn from thirst of lost command  To find your rival spirits thus pursue  A post of honour which I deem my due  These marks of age you see such thoughts disown  In me departing for the world unknown  But my warm love which ye have long possest  Now prompts that counsel which you'll find the best  Why should we now for marks of glory jar  Why wish to spread our martial name afar  Crush'd as we are by Fortune's cruel stroke  And bent beneath an ignominious yoke  Ill can our minds such noble pride maintain  While the fierce Spaniard holds our galling chain  Your generous fury here ye vainly shew  Ah rather pour it on th' embattled foe  What frenzy has your souls of sense bereav'd  Ye rush to selfperdition unperceiv'd  'Gainst your own vitals would ye lift those hands  Whose vigour ought to burst oppression's bands  If a desire of death this rage create  O die not yet in this disgraceful state  Turn your keen arms and this indignant flame  Against the breast of those who sink your fame  Who made the world a witness of your shame  Haste ye to cast these hated bonds away  In this the vigour of your souls display  Nor blindly lavish from your country's veins  Blood that may yet redeem her from her chains  E'en while I thus lament I still admire  The fervor of your souls they give me fire  But justly trembling at their fatal bent  I dread some dire calamitous event  Lest in your rage Dissention's frantic hand  Should cut the sinews of our native land  If such its doom my thread of being burst  And let your old compeer expire the first  Shall this shrunk frame thus bow'd by age's weight  Live the weak witness of a nation's fate  No let some friendly sword with kind relief  Forbid its sinking in that scene of grief  Happy whose eyes in timely darkness close  Sav'd from that worst of sights his country's woes  Yet while I can I make your weal my care  And for the public good my thoughts declare  Equal ye are in courage and in worth  Heaven has assign'd to all an equal birth  In wealth in power and majesty of soul  Each Chief seems worthy of the world's controul  These gracious gifts not gratefully beheld  To this dire strife your daring minds impell'd  But on your generous valour I depend  That all our country's woes will swiftly end  A Leader still our present state demands  To guide to vengeance our impatient bands  Fit for this hardy task that Chief I deem  Who longest may sustain a massive beam  Your rank is equal let your force be try'd  And for the strongest let his strength decide  The Chieftains acquiesce in this proposal which as Voltaire justly observes is very natural in a nation of savages The beam is produced and of a size so enormous that the Poet declares himself afraid to specify its weight The first Chieftains who engage in the trial support it on their shoulders five and six hours each Tucapel fourteen and Lincoya more than double that number when the assembly considering his strength as almost supernatural is eager to bestow on him  the title of General but in the moment he is exulting in this new honour Caupolican arrives without attendants His person and character are thus described by the Poet  Tho' from his birth one darken'd eye he drew  The viewless orb was of the granate's hue  Nature who partly robb'd him of his sight  Repaid this failure by redoubled might  This noble youth was of the highest state  His actions honour'd and his words of weight  Prompt and resolv'd in every generous cause  A friend to Justice and her sternest laws  Fashion'd for sudden feats or toils of length  His limbs possess'd both suppleness and strength  Dauntless his mind determin'd and adroit  In every quick and hazardous exploit  This accomplished Chieftain is received with great joy by the assembly and having surpassed Lincoya by many degrees in the trial is invested with the supreme command He dispatches a small party to attack a neighbouring Spanish fort they execute his orders and make a vigorous assault After a arp conflict they are repulsed but in the moment of their retreat Caupolican arrives with his army to their support The Spaniards in despair  evacuate the fort and make their escape in the night the news is brought to Valdivia the Spanish Commander in the city of Concepcionand with his resolution to punish the Barbarians the canto concludes  CANTO III  O CURELESS malady Oh fatal pest  Embrac'd with ardour and with pride carest  Thou common vice thou most contagious ill  Bane of the mind and frenzy of the will  Thou foe to private and to public health  Thou dropsy of the soul that thirsts for wealth  Insatiate Avarice'tis from thee we trace  The various misery of our mortal race  With this spirited and generous invective against that prevailing vice of his countrymen which sullied the lustre of their most brilliant exploits Ercilla opens his d canto He does not scruple to assert that the enmity of the Indians arose from the avaricious severity of their Spanish oppressors and he accuses Valdivia on this head though he gives him the praise of a brave and gallant officerThis Spaniard on the first intelligence of  the Indian insurrection dispatched his scouts from the city where he commanded They do not return Pressed by the impatient gallantry of his troops Valdivia marches outthey soon discover the mangled heads of his messengers fixed up as a spectacle of terror on the road Valdivia deliberates what measures to pursue His army entreat him to continue his march He consents being piqued by their insinuations of his disgracing the Spanish arms An Indian ally brings him an account that twenty thousand of the confederated Indians are waiting to destroy him in the valley of Tucapel He still presses forward arrives in sight of the fort which the Indians had destroyed and engages them in a most obstinate battle in the description of which the Poet introduces an original and striking simile in the following manner  The steady pikemen of the savage band  Waiting our hasty charge in order stand  But when th' advancing Spaniard aim'd his stroke  Their ranks to form a hollow square they broke  An easy passage to our troop they leave  And deep within their lines their foes receive  Their files resuming then the ground they gave  Bury the Christians in that closing grave  As the keen Crocodile who loves to lay  His silent ambush for his finny prey  Hearing the scaly tribe with sportive sound  Advance and cast a muddy darkness round  Opens his mighty mouth with caution wide  And when th' unwary fish within it glide  Closing with eager haste his hollow jaw  Thus satiates with their lives his rav'nous maw  So in their toils without one warning thought  The murd'rous foe our little squadron caught  With quick destruction in a fatal strife  From whence no Christian soldier 'scap'd with life  Such was the fate of the advanced guard of the Spaniards The Poet then describes the conflict of the main army with great spiritten Spaniards distinguish themselves by signal acts of courage but are all cut in pieces The battle proceeds thus  The hostile sword now deeply dy'd in blood  Drench'd the wide field with many a sanguine flood  Courage still grows to form the fierce attack  But wasted vigour makes the combat slack  No pause they seek to gain exhausted breath  No rest except the final rest of death  The wariest combatants now only try  To snatch the sweets of vengeance ere they die  The fierce disdain of death and scorn of flight  Give to our scanty troop such wond'rous might  The Araucanian host begin to yield  They quit with loss and shame the longfought field  They fly and their pursuers shake the plain  With joyous shouts of Victory and Spain  But dire mischance and Fate's resistless sway  Gave a strange issue to the dreadful day  An Indian Youth a noble Chieftain's son  Who as our friend his martial feats begun  Our Leader's Page by him to battle train'd  Who now beside him the hard fight sustain'd  As he beheld his kindred Chiefs retire  Felt an indignant flash of Patriot fire  And thus incited to a glorious stand  The flying champions of his native land  Misguided Country by vain fear possest  Ah whither dost thou turn thy timid breast  Ye brave compatriots shall your ancient fame  Be vilely buried in this field of shame  Those laws those rights ye gloried to defend  All perish all by this ignoble end  From Chiefs of dreaded power and honour'd worth  Ye sink to abject slaves the scorn of earth  To the pure founders of your boasted race  Ye give the cureless wound of deep disgrace  Behold the wasted vigor of your foe  See bath'd in sweat and blood their coursers blow  Lose not your mental force your martial fires  Our best inheritance from generous sires  Sink not the noble Araucanian name  From glory's summit to the depths of shame  Fly fly the servitude your souls detest  To the keen sword oppose the dauntless breast  Why shew ye frames endued with manly power  Yet shrink from danger in the trying hour  Fix in your minds the friendly truth I speak  Vain are your fears your terror blind and weak  Now make your names immortal now restore  Freedom's lost blessings to your native shore  Now turn while Fame and Victory invite  While prosp'rous Fortune calls you to the fight  Or yet a moment cease O cease to fly  And for our country learn of me to die  As thus he speaks his eager steps advance  And 'gainst the Spanish Chief he points his lance  To lead his kindred fugitives from flight  Singly he dares to tempt th' unequal fight  Against our circling arms that round him shine  Eager he darts amidst the thickest line  Keen as when chaf'd by summer's fiery beam  The young Stag plunges in the cooling stream  The Poet proceeds to relate the great agility and valour displayed by Lautaro for such is the name of this gallant and patriotic Youth and as Ercilla has a soul sufficiently heroic to do full justice to the virtues of an enemy he gives him the highest praise Having mentioned on the occasion many heroes of ancient history he exclaims  Say of these famous Chiefs can one exceed  Or match this young Barbarian's noble deed  Vict'ry for them her purpose unexplor'd  Tempted by equal chance their happy sword  What risk what peril did they boldly meet  Save where Ambition urg'd the splendid feat  Or mightier Int'rest fir'd the daring mind  Which makes a Hero of the fearful Hind  Many there are who with a brave disdain  Face all the perils of the deathful plain  Who fir'd by hopes of glory nobly dare  Yet fail the stroke of adverse chance to bear  With animated fire their spirit shines  Till the short splendor of their day declines  But all their valor all their strength expires  When fickle Fortune from their side retires  This youthful Hero when the die was cast  War's dire decree against his country past  Made the stern Power the finish'd cause resume  And finally reverse the cruel doom  He by his efforts in the dread debate  Forc'd the determin'd will of adverse Fate  From shouting Triumph rush'd the palm to tear  And fix'd it on the brow of faint Despair  Caupolican leading his army back to the charge in consequence of Lautaro's efforts in their favour obtains a complete victory The Spaniards are all slain in the field except their Commander Valdivia who flies attended only by a priest but he is soon taken prisoner and conducted before the Indian Chief who is inclined to spare his life when an elder savage called Leocato in a sudden burst of indignation kills him with his club  All the people of Arauco assemble in a great plain to celebrate their victory old and young women and children unite in the festival and the trees that surround the scene of their assembly are decorated with the heads and spoils of their slaughtered enemies  They meditate the total extermination of the Spaniards from their country and even a descent on Spain The General makes a prudent speech to restrain their impetuosity and afterwards besfowing  just applause on the brave exploit of the young Lautaro appoints him his lieutenant In the midst of the festivity Caupolican receives advice that a party of fourteen Spanish horsemen had attacked some of his forces with great havoc He dispatches Lautaro to oppose them  CANTO IV  APARTY of fourteen gallant Spaniards who had set forth from the city of Imperial to join Valdivia not being apprised of his unhappy fate are surprised by the enemy where they expected to meet their Commanderthey defend themselves with great valor They are informed by a friendly Indian of the fate of Valdivia They attempt to retreat but are surrounded by numbers of the Araucanianswhen the Poet introduces the following instance of Spanish heroism which I insert as a curious stroke of their military character  Here cried a Spaniard far unlike his race  Nor shall his abject name my verse debase  Marking his few associates march along  O that our band were but a hundred strong  The brave Gonsalo with disdain replied  Rather let two be sever'd from our side  Kind Heaven that Memory may our feats proclaim  And call our little troop The Twelve of Fame  They continue to fight with great bravery against superior numbers when Lautaro arrives with a fresh army against them Still undaunted they only resolve to sell their lives as dear as possible Seven of them are cut to piecesIn the midst of the slaughter a furious thunder and hail storm arises by which incident the surviving seven escape The tempest is described with the following original simile  Now in the turbid air a stormy cloud  Spreads its terrific shadow o'er the crowd  The gathering darkness hides the solar ray  And to th' affrighted earth denies the day  The rushing winds to which the forests yield  Rive the tall tree and desolate the field  In drops distinct and rare now falls the rain  And now with thickening fury beats the plain  As the bold master of the martial drum  Ere to the shock th' advancing armies come  In aweful notes that shake the heaven's high arch  Intrepid strikes the slow and solemn march  But when the charging heroes yield their breath  Doubles the horrid harmony of death  So the dark tempest with increasing sound  Pours the loud deluge on the echoing ground  The few Spaniards that escape take refuge in a neighbouring fort which they abandon the following day on hearing the fate of Valdivia Lautaro returns and receives new honors and new forces from his General to march against a Spanish army which departs from the city of Penco under the command of Villagran an experienced officer to revenge the death of Valdivia The departure of the troops from Penco is described and the distress of the womenVillagran marches with expedition towards the frontiers of Arauco He arrives at a dangerous pass and finds Lautaro with his army of Indians advantageously posted on the heights and waiting with great steadiness and discipline to give him battle  CANTO V  LAUTARO with great difficulty restrains the eager Indians in their post on the rock He suffers a few to descend and skirmish on the lower ground where several distinguish themselves in  single combat The Spaniards attempt in vain to dislodge the army of Lautaro by an attack of their cavalrythey afterwards fire on them from six pieces of cannon  The vext air feels the thunder of the fight  And smoke and flame involve the mountain's height  Earth seems to open as the flames aspire  And new volcano's spout destructive fire  Lautaro saw no hopes of life allow'd  Save by dispersing this terrific cloud  That pours its lightning with so dire a shock  Smiting his lessen'd host who strew the rock  And to the troop of Leucoton the brave  His quick command the skilful Leader gave  He bids them fiercely to the charge descend  And thus exhorts aloud each ardent friend  My faithful partners in bright victory's meed  Whom fortune summons to this noble deed  Behold the hour when your prevailing might  Shall prove that Justice guards us in the fight  Now firmly fix your lances in the rest  And rush to honor o'er each hostile breast  Through every bar your bloody passage force  Nor let a brother's fall impede your course  Be yon dread instruments of death your aim  Possest of these you gain eternal fame  The camp shall follow your triumphant trace  And own you leaders in the glorious chace  While these bold words their ardent zeal exalt  They rush impetuous to the rash assault  The Indians undismayed by a dreadful slaughter gain possession of the cannonVillagran makes a short but spirited harangue to his flying soldiers He is unable to rally them and chusing rather to die than to survive so ignominious a defeat rushes into the thickest of the enemywhen the Poet leaving his fate uncertain concludes the canto  CANTO VI  THE valiant mind is privileg'd to feel  Superior to each turn of Fortune's wheel  Chance has no power its value to debase  Or brand it with the mark of deep disgrace  So thought the noble Villagran our Chief  Who chose that death should end his present grief  And smooth the horrid path with thornso' erspread  Which Destiny condemn'd his feet to tread  With the preceding encomium on the spirit of this unfortunate officer the Poet opens his th  Canto Thirteen of the most faithful soldiers of Villagran perceiving their Leader fallen motionless under the fury of his enemies make a desperate effort to preserve himBeing placed again on his horse by these generous deliverers he recovers from the blow which had stunned him and by singular exertion with the assistance of his spirited little troop effects his escape and rejoins his main army whom he endeavours in vain to lead back against the triumphant Araucanians The pursuit becomes general and the Poet describes the horrid massacre committed by the Indians on all the unhappy fugitives that fell into their handsThe Spaniards in their flight are stopt by a narrow pass fortified and guarded by a party of Indians Villagran forces the rude entrenchment in person and conducts part of his army safe through the pass but many attempting other roads over the mountainous country are either lost among the precipices of the rocks or pursued and killed by the Indians  CANTO VII  THE remains of the Spanish army after infinite loss and fatigue at last reach the city of Concepcion  Their entrance in these walls let fancy paint  O'erwhelm'd with anguish and with labor faint  These gash'd with ghastly wounds those writh'd with pain  And some their human semblance scarce retain  They seem unhappy spirits 'scap'd from hell  Yet wanting voice their misery to tell  Their pangs to all their rolling eyes express  And silence most declares their deep distress  When weariness and shame at length allow'd  Their tongues to satisfy th' enquiring crowd  From the pale citizens amaz'd to hear  A tale surpassing e'en their wildest fear  One general sound of lamentation rose  That deeply solemniz'd a nation's woes  The neighbouring mansions to their grief reply  And every wall return'd the mournful cry  The inhabitants of Concepcion expecting every instant the triumphant Lautaro at their gates resolve to abandon their city A gallant veteran upbraids their cowardly design They disregard his reproaches and evacuate the placewhen the Poet introduces the following instance of female heroism  'Tis just that Fame a noble deed display  Which claims remembrance even to the day  When Memory's hand no more the pen shall use  But sink in darkness and her being lose  The lovely Mencia an accomplish'd Dame  A valiant spirit in a tender frame  Here firmly shew'd as this dread scene began  Courage now found not in the heart of man  The bed of sickness 'twas her chance to press  But when she heard the city's loud distress  Snatching such weapons as the time allow'd  She rush'd indignant midst the flying crowd  Now up the neighbouring hill they slowly wind  And bending oft their mournful eyes behind  Cast a sad look of every hope bereft  On those rich plains the precious home they left  More poignant grief see generous Mencia feel  More noble proof she gives of patriot zeal  Waving a sword in her heroic hand  In their tame march she stopt the timid band  Cross'd the ascending road before their van  And turning to the city thus began  Thou valiant nation whose unequall'd toils  Have dearly purchas'd fame and golden spoils  Where is the courage ye so oft display'd  Against this foe from whom ye shrink dismay'd  Where those high hopes and that aspiring flame  Which made immortal praise your constant aim  Where your firm souls that every chance defied  And native strength that form'd your noble pride  Ah whither would you fly in selfish fear  In frantic haste with no pursuer near  How oft has censure to your hearts assign'd  Ardor too keenly brave and rashly blind  Eager to dart amid the doubtful fray  Scorning the useful aid of wise delay  Have we not seen you with contempt oppose  And bend beneath your yoke unnumber'd foes  Attempt and execute designs so bold  Ye grew immortal as ye heard them told  Turn to your people turn a pitying eye  To whom your fears these happy seats deny  Turn and survey this fair this fertile land  Whose ready tribute waits your lordly hand  Survey its pregnant mines its sands of gold  Survey the flock now wandering from its fold  Mark how it vainly seeks in wild despair  The faithless shepherd who forsakes his care  E'en the dumb creatures of domestic kind  Though not endow'd with man's discerning mind  Now shew the semblance of a reasoming soul  And in their masters misery condole  The stronger animals of sterner heart  Take in this public woe a feeling part  Their plaintive roar that speaks their sense aright  Justly upbraids your ignominious flight  Ye fly from quiet opulence and fame  Purchas'd by valor your acknowledg'd claim  From these ye fly to seek a foreign seat  Where dastard fugitives no welcome meet  How deep the shame an abject life to spend  In poor dependance on a pitying friend  Turn let the brave their only choice await  Or honourable life or instant fate  Return return O quit this path of shame  Stain not by fear your yet unsullied name  Myself I offer if our foes advance  To rush the foremost on the hostile lance  My actions then shall with my words agree  And what a woman dares your eyes shall see  Return return she cried but cried in vain  Her fire seem'd frenzy to the coward train  The dastardly inhabitants of the city unmoved by this remonstrance of the noble Donna Mencia de Nidos continue their precipitate flight and after twelve days of confusion and fatigue reach the city of Santiago in the valley of Mapocho Lautaro arrives in the mean time before the walls they had desertedand the Poet concludes his canto with a spirited description of the barbaric  fury with which the Indians entered the abandoned city and destroyed by fire the rich and magnificent mansions of their Spanish oppressors  CANTO VIII  LAUTARO is recalled from his victorious exploits to assist at a general assembly of the Indians in the valley of Arauco The different Chieftains deliver their various sentiments concerning the war after their Leader Caupolican has declared his design to pursue the Spaniards with unceasing vengeance The veteran Colocolo proposes a plan for their military operations An ancient Augur named Puchecalco denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen in the name of the Indian Daemon Eponamon He recites the omens of their destruction The fierce Tucapel provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet strikes him dead in the midst of his harangue by a sudden blow of his mace Caupolican orders the murderous Chieftain to be led to instant death He defends himself with success against numbers who attempt to seize him Lautaro pleased by this exertion of his wonderful force and valour intreats the General to forgive what had passed and at  his intercession Tucapel is received into favour Lautaro then closes the business of the assembly by recommending the plan proposed by Colocolo and intreating that he may himself be entrusted with a detached party of five hundred Indians with which he engages to reduce the city of Santiago His proposal is accepted The Chieftains having finished their debate declare their resolutions to their people and after their usual festivity Caupolican with the main army proceeds to attack the city of Imperial  CANTO IX  THE Poet opens this Canto with an apology for a miracle which he thinks it necessary to relate as it was attested by the whole Indian army and though it does not afford him any very uncommon or sublime imagery he embellishes the wonder he describes by his easy and spirited versification of which the following lines are an imperfect copy  When to the city's weak defenceless wall  Its foes were rushing at their trumpet's call  The air grew troubled with portentous sound  And mournful omens multiplied around  With furious shock the elements engage  And all the winds contend in all their rage  From clashing clouds their mingled torrents gush  And rain and hail with rival fury rush  Bolts of loud thunder floods of lightning rend  The opening skies and into earth descend  O'er the vast army equal terrors spread  No mind escapes the universal dread  No breast tho' arm'd with adamantine power  Holds its firm vigor in this horrid hour  For now the fierce Eponamon appears  And in a Dragon's form augments their fears  Involving flames around the Daemon swell  Who speaks his mandate in a hideous yell  He bids his votaries with haste invest  The trembling city by despair deprest  Where'er th' invading squadrons force their way  He promises their arms an easy prey  Spare not he cry'd in the relentless strife  One Spanish battlement one Christian life  He spoke and while the host his will adore  Melts into vapour and is seen no more  Quick as he vanish'd Nature's struggles cease  The troubled elements are sooth'd to peace  The winds no longer rage with boundless ire  But hush'd in silence to their caves retire  The clouds disperse restoring as they fly  The unobstructed sun and azure sky  Fear only held its place and still possest  Usurp'd dominion o'er the boldest breast  The tempest ceas'd and heaven ferenely bright  Array'd the moisten'd earth in joyous light  When pois'd upon a cloud that swiftly flew  A Female form descended to their view  Clad in the radiance of so rich a veil  As made the sun's meridian lustre pale  For it outshone his golden orb as far  As his full blaze outshines the twinkling star  Her sacred features banish all their dread  And o'er the host reviving comfort shed  An hoary Elder by her side appear'd  For age and sanctity of life rever'd  And thus she spoke with soft persuasive grace  Ah whither rush ye blind devoted race  Turn while you can towards your native plain  Nor 'gainst yon city point your arms in vain  For God will guard his faithful Christian band  And give them empire o'er your bleeding land  Since thankless false and obstinate in ill  You scorn submission to his sacred will  Yet shun those walls th' Almighty there ador'd  There arms his people with Destruction's sword  So spoke the Vision with an angel's tongue  And thro' the spacious air to heaven she sprung  The Indians confounded by this miraculous interposition disperse in disorder to their several homes and the Poet proceeds very gravely to affirm that having obtained the best information from many individuals concerning this miracle that he might be very exact in his account of it he finds it happened on the twentythird of April four years before he wrote the verses that describe it and in the year of our Lord The Vision was followed by pestilence and famine among the Indians They remain inactive during the winter but assemble again the ensuing spring in the plains of Arauco to renew the war They receive intelligence that the Spainards are attempting to rebuild the city of Concepcion and are requested by the neighbouring tribes to march to their assistance and prevent that design Lautaro leads a chosen band on that expedition hoping to surprize the fort the Spaniards had erected on the ruins of their city but the Spanish commander Alvarado being apprized of their motion sallies forth to meet the Indian party a skirmish ensues the Spaniards retire to their fort Lautaro attempts to storm it a most bloody encounter ensues Tucapel signalizes himself in the attack the Indians persevere with the most obstinate valour and after a long conflict described with a considerable  portion of Homeric spirit gain possession of the fort Alvarado and a few of his followers escape they are pursued and much galled in their flight a single Indian named Rengo harrasses Alvarado and two of his attendants the Spanish officer provoked by the insult turns with his two companions to punish their pursuer but the wily Indian secures himself on some rocky heights and annoys them with his sling till despairing of revenge they continue their flight  CANTO X  THE Indians celebrate their victory with public games and prizes are appointed for such as excel in their various martial exercises Leucoton is declared victor in the contest of throwing the lance and receives a scimitar as his reward Rengo subdues his two rivals Cayeguan and Talco in the exercise of wrestling and proceeds to contend with Leucoton After a long and severe struggle Rengo has the misfortune to fall by an accidental failure of the ground but springing lightly up engages his adversary with increasing fury and the canto ends without deciding the contest  CANTO XI  LAUTARO separates the two enraged antagonists to prevent the ill effects of their wrath The youth Orompello whom Leucoton had before surpassed in the contest of the lance challenges his successful rival to wrestle they engage and fall together the victory is disputed Tucapel demands the prize for his young friend Orompello and insults the General Caupolican The latter is restrained from avenging the insult by the sage advice of the veteran Colocolo at whose request he distributes prizes of equal value to each of the claimants To prevent farther animosities they relinquish the rest of the appointed games and enter into debate on the war Lautaro is again appointed to the command of a chosen troop and marches towards the city of St Jago The Spaniards alarmed at the report of his approach send out some forces to reconnoitre his party a skirmish ensues they are driven back to the city and relate that Lautaro is fortifying a strong post at some distance intending soon to attack the city Villagran the Spaniard who commanded there being confined by illness appoints an officer of his own name to sally forth with all the forces he can raise in quest of the  enemy The Spaniards fix their camp on the approach of night near the fort of Lautaro they are suddenly alarmed and summoned to arms but the alarm is occasioned only by a single horse without a rider which Lautaro aware of their approach had turned loose towards their camp as an insulting mode of proclaiming his late victory in which he had taken ten of the Spanish horses  The Spaniards pass the night under arms resolving to attack the Indians at break of day Lautaro had issued orders that no Indian should sally from the fort under pain of death to prevent the advantage which the Spanish cavalry must have over his small forces in the open plain He also commanded his soldiers to retreat with an appearance of dismay at the first attack on the fort and suffer a considerable number of the enemy to enter the place This stratagem succeeds the Spaniards rush forward with great fury the Indians give ground but soon turning with redoubled violence on those who had passed their lines destroy many and oblige the rest to save themselves by a precipitate flight The Indians forgetting the orders of their Leader in the ardour of vengeance sally forth in pursuit of their flying enemy Lautaro recalls them by the sound of a military horn which he blows with the utmost violence They  return but dare not appear in the presence of their offended Commander He issues new restrictions and then summoning his soldiers together addresses them in a spirited yet calm and affectionate harangue on the necessity of martial obedience While he is yet speaking the Spaniards return to the attack but are again repulsed with great loss They retreat and encamp at the foot of a mountain unmolested by any pursuers  CANTO XII  THE Spaniards remain in their camp while two of their adventurous soldiers engage to return once more to the fort and examine the state of it On their approach one of them called Marcos Vaez is saluted by his name and promised security by a voice from within the walls Lautaro had formerly lived with him on terms of friendship and now invites him into the fort The Indian Chief harangues on the resolution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the Spaniards unless they submit He proposes however terms of accommodation to his old friend Marcos and specifies the tribute he should expect The Spaniard answers with disdain that the only tribute the Indians would receive from his countrymen would be  torture and death Lautaro replies with great temper that arms and the valor of the respective nations must determine this point and proceeds to entertain his guest with a display of six Indians whom he had mounted and trained to exercise on Spanish horses The Spaniard challenges the whole party Lautaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict but dismisses him in peace He recalls him before he had proceeded far from the fort and telling him that his soldiers were much distressed by the want of provision entreats him to send a supply affirming it to be true heroism to relieve an enemy from the necessities of famine The Spaniard subscribes to the sentiment and engages if possible to comply with the request Returning to his camp he acquaints his Commander Villagran with all that had passed who suspecting some dangerous design from Lautaro decamps hastily in the night to regain the city The Indian Chief is severely mortified by their departure as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat by letting large currents of water into the marshy ground on which the Spaniards were encamped Despairing of being able to succeed against their city now prepared to resist him he returns towards Arauco most sorely galled by his disappointment and thus venting his anguish  What can redeem Lautaro's wounded name  What plea preserve his failing arms from shame  Did not my ardent soul this task demand  Which now upbraids my unperforming hand  On me on me alone can censure fall  Myself th' adviser and the guide of all  Am I the Chief who in Fame's bright career  Ask'd to subdue the globe a single year  While at the head of this my glittering train  I weakly threaten Spanish walls in vain  Thrice has pale Cynthia with replenish'd ray  Seen my illorder'd troop in loose array  And the rich chariot of the blazing sun  Has from the Scorpion to Aquarious run  At last as fugitives these paths we tread  And mourn twice fifty brave companions dead  Could Fate's kind hand this hateful stain efface  Could death redeem me from this worse disgrace  My useless spear should pierce this abject heart  Which has so ill sustain'd a soldier's part  Unworthy thought the mean ignoble blow  Would only tempt my proud and vaunting foe  To boast that I preferr'd in fear's alarm  My own weak weapon to his stronger arm  By Hell I swear who rules the sanguine strife  If Chance allow me yet a year of life  I'll chase these foreign lords from Chile's strand  And Spanish blood shall saturate our land  No changing season neither cold nor heat  Shall make the firmer step of War retreat  Nor shall the earth nor hell's expanding cave  From this avenging arm one Spaniard save  Now the brave Chief with solemn ardor swore  To his dear native home to turn no more  From no fierce sun no stormy winds to fly  But patiently abide the varying sky  And spurn all thoughts of pleasure and of ease  Till rescu'd fame his tortur'd soul appease  Till earth confess the brave Lautaro's hand  Has clos'd the glorious work his spirit plann'd  In these resolves the Hero found relief  And thus relax'd the o'erstrain'd cord of grief  Whose pressure gall'd him with such mental pain  That frenzy almost seiz'd his burning brain  Lautaro continues his march into an Indian district from which he collects a small increase of force and after addressing his soldiers concerning the expediency of strict military discipline and the cause of their late ill success he turns again towards the city of St Jago but receiving intelligence on his road of its preparations for defence he again suspends his design and fortifies a post which he  chuses with the hope of collecting still greater numbers to assist him in his projected enterprize The Spaniards at St Jago are eager to sally in quest of Lautaro but their Commander Villagran was absent on an expedition to the city of Imperial In returning from thence he passes near the post of Lautaro An Indian ally acquaints him with its situation and at the earnest request of the Spanish officer agrees to conduct him by a short though difficult road over a mountain to attack the fort by surprize The Poet suspends his narration of this interesting event to relate the arrival of new forces from Spain in America and he now begins to appear himself on the field of action  "Hitherto"  says he  "I have described the scenes in which I was not present yet I have collected my information from no partial witnesses and I have recorded only those events in which both parties agree Since it is known that I have shed so much blood in support of what I affirm my future narration will be more authentic for I now speak as an ocular witness of every action unblinded by partiality which I disdain and resolved to rob no one of the praise which he deserves"  After pleading his youth as an apology for the defects of his style and after declaring that his only motive for writing was the ardent desire to preserve  so many valiant actions from perishing in oblivion the Poet proceeds to relate the arrival of the Marquis de Canete as Viceroy in Peru and the spirited manner in which he corrected the abuses of that country The canto concludes with reflections on the advantages of loyalty and the miseries of rebellion  CANTO XIII  SPANISH deputies from the province of Chile implore assistance from the new Viceroy of Peru he sends them a considerable succour under the conduct of Don Garcia his son The Poet is himself of this band and relates the splendid preparations for the enterprize and the embarkation of the troops in ten vessels which sail from Lima towards the coast of Chile Having described part of this voyage he returns to the bold exploit of Villagran and the adventures of Lautaro the most interesting of all the Araucanian Heroes whom he left securing himself in his sequestered fort  A path where watchful centinels were spread  A single path to this lone station led  No other signs of human step were trac'd  For the vex'd land was desolate and waste  It chanc'd that night the noble Chieftain prest  His anxious mistress to his gallant breast  The fair Guacolda for whose charms he burn'd  And whose warm heart his faithful love return'd  That night beheld the warlike savage rest  Free from th' incumbrance of his martial vest  That night alone allow'd his eyes to close  In the deceitful calm of short repose  Sleep prest upon him like the weight of death  But soon he starts alarm'd and gasps for breath  The fair Guacolda with a trembling tongue  Anxious enquires from whence his anguish sprung  My lovely Fair the brave Lautaro cries  An hideous vision struck my scornful eyes  Methought that instant a fierce Chief of Spain  Mock'd my vain spear with insolent disdain  His forceful arm my failing powers o'ercame  And strength and motion seem'd to quit my frame  But still the vigor of my soul I keep  And its keen anger burst the bonds of sleep  With quick despir the troubled Fair one said  Alas thy dreams confirm the ills I dread  'Tis comethe object of my boding fears  Thy end the source of my unceasing tears  Yet not so wretched is this mournful hour  Nor o'er me Fortune canst thou boast such pow'r  But that kind death may shorten all my woes  And give the agonizing scene to close  Let my stern fate its cruel rage employ  And hurl me from the throne of love and joy  Whatever pangs its malice may devise  It cannot rend affection's stronger ties  Tho' horrible the blow my fears foresee  A second blow will set my spirit free  For cold on earth thy frame shall ne'er be found  While mine with useless being loads the ground  The Chief transported with her tender charms  Closely around her neck entwin'd his arms  And while fond tears her snowy breast bedew'd  Thus with redoubled love his speech pursu'd  My generous Fair thy gloomy thoughts dismiss  Nor let dark omens interrupt our bliss  And cloud these moments that with transport shine  While my exulting heart thus feels thee mine  Thy troubled fancy prompts my mutual sigh  Not that I think the hour of danger nigh  But Love so melts me with his soft controul  Impossibilities alarm my soul  If thy kind wishes bid Lautaro live  Who to this frame the wound of death can give  Tho' 'gainst me all the powers of earth combine  My life is subject to no hand but thine  Who has restor'd the Araucanian name  And rais'd it sinking in the depths of shame  When alien lords our nation's spirit broke  And bent its neck beneath a servile yoke  I am the Chief who burst our galling chain  And freed my country from oppressive Spain  My name alone without my sword's display  Humbles our foes and fills them with dismay  These happy arms while thy dear beauties fill  I feel no terror I foresee no ill  Be not by false and empty dreams deprest  Since truth has nothing to afflict thy breast  Oft have I 'scap'd inur'd to every state  From many a darker precipice of fate  Oft in far mightier perils risk'd my life  And issued glorious from the doubtful strife  With less'ning confidence and deeper grief  Trembling she hung upon the soothing Chief  His lip with supplicating softness prest  And urg'd with many a tear this fond request  If the pure love which prodigal and free  When freedom most was mine I gave to thee  If truth which Heaven will witness and defend  Weigh with my sovereign lord and gentle friend  By these let me adjure thee by the pain  Which at our parting pierc'd my every vein  And all the vows if undispers'd in air  Which then with many a tear I heard thee swear  To this my only wish at least agree  If all thy wishes have been laws to me  Haste I entreat thee arm thyself with care  And bid thy soldiers for defence prepare  The brave Barbarian quick reply'd'Tis clear  How low my powers are rated by thy fear  Canst thou so poorly of Lautaro deem  And is this arm so sunk in thy esteem  This arm which rescuing thy native earth  So prodigally prov'd its valiant worth  In my try'd courage how complete thy trust  Whose terror weeps thy living lord as dust  In thee she cries with confidence most pure  My soul is satisfy'd yet not secure  What will thy arm avail in danger's course  If my malignant fate has mightier force  But let the mis'ry I forebode arise  On this firm thought my constant love relies  The sword whose stroke our union may disjoin  Will teach my faithful soul to follow thine  Since my hard destiny with rage severe  Thus threatens me with all that love can fear  Since I am doom'd the worst of ills to see  And lose all earthly good in losing thee  O suffer me to pass ere death appears  The little remnant of my life in tears  The heart that sinks not in distress like this  Could never feel could never merit bliss  Here from her eyes such floods of sorrow flow  Compassion weeps in gazing on her woe  The fond Lautaro tho' of firmest power  Sheds as she speaks a sympathetic shower  But to the tender scenes of love unus'd  My artless pen embarrass'd and confus'd  From its sad task with diffidence withdraws  And in its labour asks a little pause  CANTO XIV  WHat erring wretch to Truth and Beauty blind  Shall dare to satirize the Female Kind  Since pure affection prompts their anxious care  Their lovely weakness and their fond despair  This fair Barbarian free from Christian ties  A noble proof of perfect love supplies  By kindest words and floods of tears that roll  From the clear source of her impassion'd soul  The cheering ardor of the dauntless Chief  Fails to afford her troubled mind relief  Nor can the ample trench and guarded wall  Preserve her doubtful heart from fear's enthrall  Her terrors rushing with love's mighty force  Level whatever would impede their course  She finds no shelter from her cruel doom  Save the dear refuge of Lautaro's tomb  Thus their two hearts where equal passion reign'd  A fond debate with tender strife maintain'd  Their differing words alike their love display  Feed the sweet poison and augment its sway  The sleepy soldiers now their stories close  And stretch'd around their sinking fires repose  The path in front with centinels was lin'd  And the high mountain was their guard behind  But o'er that mountain with advent'rous tread  Bold Villagran his silent forces led  His hasty march with painful toil he made  Toil is the price that must for fame be paid  Now near the fort and halting in its sight  He waits the coming aid of clearer light  The stars yet shining but their fires decay  And now the reddening East proclaims the day  Th' advancing troop no Indian eye alarms  For friendly darkness hover'd o'er their arms  And on the quarter where the mountain rose  The careless guard despis'd the thought of foes  No panting horse their still approach betray'd  Propitious Fortune lent the Spaniards aid  Fortune who oft bids drowsy Sloth beware  And lulls to sleep the watchful eye of Care  When Night's obscure dominion first declines  And glimmering light the dusky air refines  The weary guards who round the wall were plac'd  Hail the new day and from their station haste  Secure of ill no longer watch they keep  Quick to forget their nightly toils in sleep  Thro' all the fort there reign'd a calm profound  In wine and slumber all its force was drown'd  The Spanish Chief who saw the fav'ring hour  Led on by slow degrees his silent power  No Indian eyes perceiv'd his near advance  Fate seem'd to bind them in a cruel trance  Each in sound slumber draws his easy breath  Nor feels his slumber will be clos'd by Death  So blind are mortals to that tyrant's sway  They deem him distant while they sink his prey  Our eager soldiers now no longer halt  While kind occasion prompts the keen assault  A shout they raise terrific loud and long  Swell'd by the voice of all the ardent throng  Whose ranks obedient to their Leader's call  Rush with light ardor o'er th' unguarded wall  And gain the fort where Sleep's oppressive weight  Expos'd his wretched victims blind to fate  As villains conscious of their life impure  Find in their guilty course no spot secure  For vice is ever doom'd new fears to feel  And tremble at each turn of Fortune's wheel  At every noise at each alarm that stirs  Death's penal horror to their mind occurs  Quick to their arms they fly with wild dismay  And rush where hasty terror points the way  So quick the Indians to the tumult came  With sleep and valor struggling in their frame  Unaw'd by danger's unexpected sight  They rouse their fellows and they rush to fight  Tho' their brave bosoms are of armour bare  Their manly hearts their martial rage declare  No furious odds their gallant souls appal  But resolute they fly to guard the wall  It was the season when with tender care  Lautaro reason'd with his anxious Fair  Carest consol'd and in his anger kind  Mildly reprov'd her weak mistrusting mind  Spite of his cheering voice she trembles still  Severer terrors now her bosom fill  For sterner sounds their soft debate o'ercome  Drown'd in the rattle of th' alarming drum  But not so quick on Apprehension's wings  The wretched miser from his pillow springs  Whose hoarded gold forbids his mind to rest  If doubtful noise the nightly thief suggest  Nor yet so hasty tho' with terror wild  Flies the fond mother to her wounded child  Whose painful cry her shuddering soul alarms  As flew Lautaro at the sound of arms  His mantle rapidly around him roll'd  And grasping a light sword with hasty hold  Too eager for his heavier arms to wait  The fierce Barbarian hurried to the gate  O faithless Fortune thou deceitful friend  Of thy false favours how severe the end  How quick thou cancell'st when thy frown appears  Th' accumulated gifts of long triumphant years  To aid the Spaniards in their bold emprize  Four hundred Indians march'd their firm allies  Who on the left their line of battle close  And haste to combat with their painted bows  Launching adroitly in their rapid course  Unnumber'd arrows with unerring force  As brave Lautaro issued from his tent  A shaft to meet the sallying Chief was sent  Thro' his left side ye valiant mourn his lot  Flew the keen arrow with such fury shot  It pierc'd his heart the bravest and the best  That e'er was lodg'd within a human breast  Proud of the stroke that laid such valor low  Death seem'd to glory in th' important blow  And that no Mortal might his triumph claim  In darkness hid the doubtful Archer's name  Such force the keen resistless weapon found  It stretch'd the mighty Chieftain on the ground  And gave large outlet to his ardent blood  That gush'd apace in a tumultuous flood  From his sunk cheek its native colour fled  His sightless eyes roll'd in his ghastly head  His soul that felt its glorious hopes o'erthrown  Retir'd indignant to the world unknown  The noble savages not dismayed by the death of their Leader continue to defend the fort with great fury  CANTO XV  THE Poet opens this canto with a lively panegyric on Love he affirms that the greatest Poets have derived their glory from their vivid descriptions of this enchanting passion and he laments that he is precluded by his subject from indulging his imagination in such scenes as are more likely to captivate a reader  He seems to intend this as an apology but I  must own it is an unsatisfactory one for deserting the fair Guacolda whom he mentions no more He proceeds to describe the sharp contest which the undaunted Indians still maintained in their fortthey refuse quarter which is offered them by the Spanish Leader and all resolutely perish with the brave and beloved Lautaro The Poet then resumes his account of the naval expedition from Peru to Chile and concludes the canto with a spirited description of a storm which attacked the vessels as they arrived in sight of the province to which they were steering  CANTO XVI  THE storm abates The Spaniards land and fortify themselves on an island near the country of the Araucanians The latter hold a council of war in the valley of Ongolmo Caupolican their General proposes to attack the Spaniards in their new post The elder Chieftains dissuade him from the design A quarrel ensues between Tucapel and the aged Peteguelenthey are appeased by a speech of the venerable Colocolo by whose advice a spirited and adroit young Indian named Millalanco is dispatched as a peaceful ambassador to learn the situation and designs of the Spaniards  He embarks in a large galley with oars and soon arrives at the island He surveys the Spanish implements of war with astonishment and is conducted to the tent of the General Don Garcia  CANTO XVII  THE Indian addresses the Spanish officers with a proposal of peace and amity He is dismissed with presents The Chieftains on his return pretend to relinquish hostilities but prepare secretly for war The Spaniards remain unmolested on the island during the stormy season They send a select party of an hundred and thirty including our Poet to raise a fort on the continent these execute their commission with infinite dispatch and all the Spanish troops remove to this new post The Araucanians are alarmed An intrepid Youth named Gracolano proposes to the Indian General Caupolican to storm the fort The Indians advance near it under shelter of the night The Poet describes himself at this juncture as oppressed by the excessive labours of the day and unable to pursue his poetical studies according to his nightly custom the pen falls from his hand he is seized with violent pains and tremblings  his strength and senses forsake him But soon recovering from this infirmity he enjoys a refreshing sleep Bellona appears to him in a vision and encourages him both as a soldier and a poet She conducts him through a delicious country to the summit of a most lofty mountain when pointing to a spot below she informs him it is St Quintin and that his countrymen under the command of their sovereign Philip are just marching to attack it she adds that her presence is necessary in the midst of that important scene and leaves the Poet on the eminence to survey and record the battle  CANTO XVIII  AFTER the Poet has described the success of his royal master at St Quintin a female figure of a most venerable appearance but without a name relates to him prophetically many future events of great importance to his country She touches on the disturbances in the Netherlands the enterprizes of the Turks and the exploits of Don John of Austria at that time unknown to fame These she hints very imperfectly telling the Poet that if he wishes for farther information he must follow the steps of a tame deer which he will find in a particular spot this animal will lead  him to the cell of an ancient hermit formerly a soldier who will conduct him to the secret cave of the unsocial Fiton a mighty magician who will display to him the most miraculous visions His female Instructor then advises him to mix softer subjects with the horrors of war and to turn his eyes and his thoughts to the charms of the many Beauties who then flourished in Spain He beholds all these lovely fair ones assembled in a delicious paradise and he is particularly attracted by a young lady whose name he discovers to be Donna Maria Bazan his future wife in the moment that he begins to question his Guide concerning this engaging Beauty he is roused from his vision by the sound of an alarm He snatches up his arms and hurries to his postwhile the morning dawns and the Indians begin to attack the fort  CANTO XIX  THE Indians advance in three squadrons The Youth Gracolano o'erleaps the trench supported on a lofty pike by which he also passes the wall He defends himself in the midst of the Spaniards with great spirit but finding himself unsupported he wrenches a lance from a Spanish soldier and tries to leap once more over the trench  but he is struck by a stone while vaulting through the air and falls covered as the Poet expressly declares with twoandthirty wounds Some of his friends are shot near him but the Indians get possession of the Spanish lance with which he had sprung over the wall and brandish it in triumph The Spaniard named Elvira who had lost his weapon piqued by the adventure sallies from the fort and returns amid the shouts of his countrymen with an Indian spear which he won in single combat from a Barbarian whom he had perceived detached from his party The Indians attempt to storm the fort on every side many are destroyed by the Spanish firearms The head of the ancient Peteguelen is shot off but Tucapel passes the wall and rushes with great slaughter into the midst of the enemy The Spaniards who were in the ships that anchored near the coast hasten on shore and march to assist their countrymen in the fort but are attacked by a party of Indians in their march The conflict continues furious on the walls but the Indians at length retreat leaving Tucapel still sighting within the fort  CANTO XX  TUCAPEL though severely wounded escapes with life and rejoins the Indian army which continues to retreat The Spaniards sally from the fort but soon return to it from the apprehension of an ambuscade They clear their trench and strengthen the weaker parts of their fortification Night comes on The Poet describes himself stationed on a little eminence in the plain below the fort which was seated on high and rocky groundfatigued with the toils of the day and oppressed by the weight of his armour which he continues to wear he is troubled with a lethargic heaviness which he counteracts by exercise declaring that his disposition to slumber in his post arose not from any intemperance either in diet or in wine as mouldy biscuit and rainwater had been for some time his chief sustenance and that he was accustomed to make the moist earth his bed and to divide his time between his poetical and his military labours He then relates the following nocturnal adventure which may perhaps be considered as the most striking and pathetic incident in this singular poem  While thus I strove my nightly watch to keep  And struggled with th' oppressive weight of sleep  As my quick feet with many a silent stride  Travers'd th' allotted ground from side to side  My eye perceiv'd one quarter of the plain  White with the mingled bodies of the slain  For our incessant fire that bloody day  Had slaughter'd numbers in the stubborn fray  As oft I paus'd each distant noise to hear  Gazing around me with attentive ear  I heard from time to time a feeble sound  Towards the breathless Indians on the ground  Still closing with a sigh of mournful length  At every interval it gather'd strength  And now it ceas'd and now again begun  And still from corse to corse it seem'd to run  As night's encreasing shade my hope destroys  To view the source of this uncertain noise  Eager my mind's unquiet doubts to still  And more the duties of my post fulfil  With crouching steps I haste and earnest eyes  To the low spot from whence the murmurs rise  And see a dusky Form that seems to tread  Slow on four feet among the gory dead  With terror that my heart will not deny  When this strange vision struck my doubtful eye  Towards it with a prayer to Heav'n I prest  Arms in my hand my corselet on my breast  But now the dusky Form on which I sprung  Upright arose and spoke with plaintive tongue  Mercy to mercy hear my just pretence  I am a woman guiltless of offence  If my distress and unexampled plight  No generous pity in thy breast excite  If thy bloodthirsty rage by tears uncheck'd  Would pass those limits which the brave respect  Will such a deed encrease thy martial fame  When Heaven's just voice shall to the world proclaim  That by thy ruthless sword a woman died  A widow sunk in sorrow's deepest tide  Yet I implore thee if 'twas haply thine  Or for thy curse as now I feel it mine  If e'er thy lot in any state to prove  How firm the faithful ties of tender love  O let me bury one brave warrior slain  Whose corse lies blended with this breathless train  Remember he who thwarts the duteous will  Becomes th' approver and the cause of ill  Thou wilt not hinder these my pious vows  War fiercest war this just demand allows  The basest tyranny alone is driven  To use the utmost power that chance has given  Let but my soul its dear companion find  Then sate thy fury if to blood inclin'd  For in such grief I draw my lingering breath  Life is my dread beyond the pangs of death  There is no ill that now can wound my breast  No good but what I in my Love possest  Fly then ye hours that keep me from the dead  For he the spirit of my life is fled  If adverse Heaven my latest wish deny  On his dear corse to fix my closing eye  My tortur'd soul in cruel Fate's despight  Will soar the faithful partner of his flight  And now her agony of heart implor'd  An end of all her sorrows from my sword  Doubt and distrust my troubled mind assail  That fears deceit in her affecting tale  Nor was I fully of her faith secure  Till oft her words the mournful truth insure  Suspicion whisper'd that an artful spy  By this illusion might our state descry  Howe'er inclin'd to doubt yet soon I knew  Though night conceal'd her features from my view  That truth was stamp'd on every word she said  So full of grief so free from guilty dread  And that bold love to every danger blind  Had sent her forth her slaughter'd Lord to find  Who in the onset of our bloody strife  For brave distinction sacrific'd his life  Fill'd with compassion when I saw her bent  To execute her chaste and fond intent  I led her weeping to the higher spot  To guard whose precincts was that night my lot  Securely there I begg'd her to relate  The perfect story of her various fate  From first to last her touching woes impart  And by the tale relieve her loaded heart  Ah she replied relief I ne'er can know  Till Death's kind aid shall terminate my woe  Earth for my ills no remedy supplies  Beyond all suff'rance my afflictions rise  Yet though the task will agonize my soul  Of my sad story I will tell the whole  Grief thus inforc'd my life's weak thread may rend  And in the killing tale my pangs may end  The fair Indian then relates to Ercilla the particulars of her life in a speech of considerable lengthshe informs him that her name is Tegualdathat she is the daughter of the Chieftain Brancolthat her father had often pressed her to marry which she had for some time declined though solicited by many of the noblest Youths in  her country till being appointed in compliment to her beauty to distribute the prizes in a scene of public festivity to those who excelled in the manly exercises she was struck by the accomplishments of a gallant Youth named Crepino as she bestowed on him the reward of his victoriesthat she declared her choice to her father after perceiving the Youth inspired with a mutual affection for herthat the old Chieftain was delighted by her chusing so noble a character and their marriage had been publicly solemnized but a month from that day On this conclusion of her story she bursts into new agonies of grief and entreats Ercilla to let her pay her last duties to her husband or rather to unite them again in a common grave Ercilla endeavours to console her by repeated promises of all the assistance in his power In the most passionate excess of sorrow she still entreats him to end her miserable lifeIn this distressing scene our Author is relieved by the arrival of a brother officer who had been also stationed on the plain and now informs Ercilla that the time of their appointed watch is expired They join in comforting the unhappy Mourner and conduct her into the fort where they consign her for the remainder of the night to  the decent care of  married women  to use the chaste expression of the generous and compassionate Ercilla  CANTO XXI  IN pure affection who has soar'd above  The tender pious proof of faithful love  Which thus awak'd our sympathetic care  For this unhappy fond barbarian Fair  O that just Fame my humble voice would raise  To swell in loudest notes her lasting praise  To spread her merits in immortal rhyme  Through every language and through every clime  With pitying females she the night remain'd  Where no rude step their privacy profan'd  Though wretched thankful for their soothing aid  With hopes her duty would at length be paid  Soon as the welcome light of morning came  Though soundest sleep had seiz'd my jaded frame  Though my tir'd limbs were still to rest inclin'd  Solicitude awak'd my anxious mind  Quick to my Indian Mourner I repair  And still in tears I find the restless Fair  The varying hours afford her no relief  No transient momentary pause of grief  With truest pity I her pangs assuage  To find her slaughter'd Lord my word engage  Restore his corse and with a martial band  Escort her safely to her native land  With blended doubt and sorrow weeping still  My promis'd word she pray'd me to fulfil  Assembling now a menial Indian train  I led her to explore the bloody plain  Where heaps of mingled dead deform'd the ground  Near to the fort the breathless Chief we found  Claycold and stiff the gory earth he prest  A fatal ball had pass'd his manly breast  Wretched Tegualda who before her view'd  The pale disfigur'd form in blood imbru'd  Sprung forward and with instantaneous force  Frantic she darted on the precious corse  And press'd his lips where livid death appears  And bath'd his wounded bosom in her tears  And kiss'd the wound and the wild hope pursues  That her fond breath may yet new life infuse  Wretch that I am at length she madly cried  Why does my soul these agonies abide  Why do I linger in this mortal strife  Nor pay to Love his just demand my life  Why poor of spirit at a single blow  Do I not close this bitter scene of woe  Whence this delay will Heaven to me deny  The wretch's choice and privilege to die  While bent on death in this despair she gasp'd  Her furious hands her snowy neck inclasp'd  Failing her frantic wish they do not spare  Her mournful visage nor her flowing hair  Much as I strove to stop her mad intent  Her fatal purpose I could scarce prevent  So loath'd she life and with such fierce controul  The raging thirst of death inflam'd her soul  When by my prayers and soft persuasion's balm  Her pangs of sorrow grew a little calm  And her mild speech confirm'd my hope at last  That her delirious agony was past  My ready Indian train with duteous haste  On a firm bier the claycold body plac'd  And bore the Warrior in whose fate we griev'd  To where her vassals the dear charge receiv'd  But lest from ruthless War's outrageous sway  The mourning Fair might suffer on her way  O'er the near mountains to a safer land  I march'd to guard her with my warlike band  And there secure for the remaining road  Was clear and open to her own abode  She gratefully declin'd my farther care  And thank'd and bless'd me in a parting prayer  As I have been tempted to dwell much longer than I intended on some of the most pathetic incidents of this extraordinary poem I shall give a more concise summary of the remaining cantosOn Ercilla's return the Spaniards continue to strengthen their fort They receive intelligence from an Indian ally that the Barbarian army intend a fresh assault in the night They are relieved from this alarm by the arrival of a large reinforcement from the Spanish cities in Chileon which event Colocolo prevails on the Indians to suspend the attack Caupolican the Indian General reviews all his forces and the various Chieftains are well described The Spanish Commander Don Garcia being now determined to march into the hostile district of Arauco addresses his soldiers in a spirited harangue requesting them to remember the pious cause for which they fight and to spare the life of every Indian who is disposed to submission They remove from their post and pass in boats over the broad river Biobio  CANTO XXII  THE Spaniards are attacked in their new quartersa furious battle ensues The Spaniards are forced to give ground but at last prevail The  Indian Chief Rengo signalizes himself in the action defends himself in a marsh and retreats in good order with his forces The Spaniards after the conflict seize an unhappy straggling Youth named Galvarino whom they punish as a rebel in the most barbarous manner by cutting off both his hands The valiant Youth defies their cruelty in the midst of this horrid scene and brandishing his bloody stumps departs from his oppressors with the most insulting menaces of revenge  CANTO XXIII  GALVARINO appears in the Assembly of the Indian Chieftains and excites them in a very animated speech to revenge the barbarity with which he had been treated He faints from loss of blood in the close of his harangue but is recovered by the care of his friends and restored to health The Indians exasperated by the sight of his wounds unanimously determine to prosecute the war The Spaniards advancing in Arauco send forth scouts to discover the disposition of the neighbouring tribes Ercilla engaging in this service perceives an old Indian in a sequestered spot apparently sinking under the infirmities of  age but on his approach the ancient figure flies from him with astonishing rapidity He endeavours in vain though on horseback to overtake this aged fugitive who soon escapes from his sight He now discovers the tame Deer foretold in his vision and pursuing it is conducted through intricate paths to a retired cottage where a courteous old man receives him in a friendly manner Ercilla enquires after the magician Fiton the old man undertakes to guide him to the secret mansion of that wonderful Necromancer to whom he declares himself related He adds that he himself was once a distinguished warrior but having the misfortune to sully his past glory without losing his life in a conflict with another Chieftain he had withdrawn himself from society and lived twenty years as a hermit He now leads Ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the Magician whose residence and magical apparatus are described with great force of imagination Fiton appears from a secret portal and proves to be the aged figure who had escaped so swiftly from the sight of Ercilla At the request of his relation the old Warrior he condescends to shew Ercilla the wonders of his art He leads him to a large lucid globe selfsuspended in the middle of an immense apartment He tells him it is the work of forty  years study and contains an exact representation of the world with this singular power that it exhibits at his command any scene of futurity which he wishes to beholdthat knowing the heroic composition of Ercilla he will give him an opportunity to vary and embellish his poem by the description of a most important seafight which he will display to him most distinctly on that sphere He then invokes all the powers of the infernal world Ercilla fixes his eye on the globe and perceives the naval forces of Spain with those of the Pope and the Venetians prepared to engage the great armament of the Turks  CANTO XXIV  DESCRIBES circumstantially the naval battle of Lepanto and celebrates the Spanish admiral Don John of Austria Ercilla gazes with great delight on this glorious action and beholds the complete triumph of his countrymen when the Magician strikes the globe with his wand and turns the scene into darkness Ercilla after being entertained with other marvellous sights which he omits from his dread of prolixity takes leave of his two aged friends and regains his quarters The  Spaniards continue to advance on their pitching their camp in a new spot towards evening an Araucanian fantastically drest in armour enquires for the tent of Don Garcia and is conducted to his presence  CANTO XXV  THE Araucanian delivers a defiance to Don Garcia in the name of Caupolican who challenges the Spanish General to end the war by a single combat The messenger adds that the whole Indian army will descend into the plain on the next morning to be spectators of the duel Don Garcia dismisses him with an acceptance of the challenge At the dawn of day the Indian forces appear in three divisions A party of Spanish horse precipitately attack their left wing before which Caupolican was advancing They are repulsed A general and obstinate engagement ensues The mangled Galvarino appears at the head of one Indian squadron and excites his countrymen to revenge his wrongs Many Spaniards are named who distinguish themselves in the battle Among the Indian Chiefs Tucapel and Rengo display the most splendid acts of valour and  though personal enemies they mutually defend each other Caupolican also at the head of the left squadron obliges the Spaniards to retreat and the Araucanians are on the point of gaining a decisive victory when the fortune of the day begins to turn  CANTO XXVI  THE reserved guard of the Spaniards in which Ercilla was stationed advancing to the charge recover the field and oblige the main body of the Indians to fly Caupolican though victorious in his quarter sounds a retreat when he perceives this event The Indians fly in great disorder Rengo for some time sustains an unequal conflict and at last retreats sullenly into a wood where he collects several of the scattered fugitives As Ercilla happened to advance towards this spot a Spaniard called Remon exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this Indian party from the wood His honour being thus piqued he rushes forward with a few followers and after an obstinate engagement in which many of the Indians are cut to pieces the Spaniards obtain the victory and return to their camp with several prisoners After this great defeat of  the Indian army the Spaniards to deter their enemies from all future resistance barbarously resolve to execute twelve Chieftains of distinction whom they find among their captives and to leave their bodies exposed on the trees that surrounded the field of battle The generous Ercilla lamenting this inhuman sentence intercedes particularly for the life of one alledging that he had seen him united with the Spaniards This person proves to be Galvarino who on hearing the intercession for his life produces his mangled arms which he had concealed in his bosom and giving vent to his detestation of the Spaniards insists on dying with his countrymen Ercilla persists in vain in his endeavour to save him As no executioner could be found among the Spanish soldiers a new mode of destruction says our Poet was invented and every Indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him These brave men hastened to accomplish their fate with as much alacrity continues Ercilla as the most spirited warrior marches to an attack One alone of the twelve begins to hesitate and pray for mercy declaring himself the lineal descendant of the most ancient race and sovereign of the country He is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous Galvarino and repenting his timidity atones for it by instant death  The Spaniards advance still farther in the country and raise a fort where Valdivia had perished Ercilla finds his old friend the Magician once more who tells him that Heaven thought proper to punish the pride of the Araucanians by their late defeat but that the Spaniards would soon pay dearly for their present triumph The Wizard retires after this prophecy and with much intreaty allows Ercilla to follow him Coming to a gloomy rock he strikes it with his wand a secret door opens and they enter into a delicious garden which the Poet commends for its symmetry expressly declaring that every hedge  has its brother  The Magician leads him into a vault of alabaster and perceiving his wish though he does not express it of seeing the miraculous globe again the courteous Fiton conducts him to it  CANTO XXVII  THE Magician displays to our Poet the various countries of the globe particularly pointing out to him the ancient castle of Ercilla the seat of his ancestors in Biscay and the spot where his sovereign Philip the Second was soon to build his magnificent palace the Escurial Having shewn  him the various nations of the earth on his marvellous sphere Fiton conducts his guest to the road leading to the Spanish camp where the soldiers of Ercilla were seeking their officer The Spaniards in vain attempt to sooth and to terify the Araucanians into peace and finding the importance of their present post they determine to strengthen it Ercilla proceeds with a party to the city of Imperial to provide necessaries for this purpose On his return as he is marching through the country of some pacific Indians he discovers at the close of day a distrest female who attempts to fly but is overtaken by Ercilla  CANTO XXVIII  THE fair fugitive whom our Poet describes as singularly beautiful relates her story She tells him her name is Glaura the daughter of an opulent Chieftain with whom she lived most happily till a brother of her father's who frequently resided with him persecuted her with an unwarrantable passionthat she in vain represented to him the impious nature of his lovehe persisted in his frantic attachment and on the appearance of a hostile party of Spaniards rushed forth to die in her  defence intreating her to receive his departing spirit He fell in the action her father shared the same fate she herself escaped at a postern gate into the woods Two negroes laden with spoil discovered and seized her Her cries brought a young Indian named Cariolano to her rescue he shot an arrow into the heart of the first ruffian and stabbed the second Glaura expressed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her husband Before they could regain a place of safety they were alarmed by the approach of Spaniards The generous Youth intreated Glaura to conceal herself in a tree while he ventured to meet the enemy In her terror she submitted to this expedient which on recovery from her panic she bitterly repented for when she issued from her retreat she sought in vain for Cariolano and supposed from the clamour she had heard that he must have perished She continued to wander in this wretched state of mind still unable to hear any tidings of her protector While the fair Indian thus closes her narrative Ercilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of Barbarians One of his faithful Indian attendants whom he had lately attached to him intreats him to escape with the utmost haste adding that he can save him from pursuit by his knowledge of the country and that he will risque  his own life most willingly to preserve that of Ercilla Glaura bursts into an agony of joy in discovering her lost Cariolano in this faithful attendant Ercilla exclaims  "Adieu my friends I give you both your liberty which is all I have at present to bestow and rejoins his little troop"  Before he enters on the account of what followed he relates the circumstance by which he attached Cariolano to his service whom he had found alone as he himself was marching with a small party and a few prisoners that he had taken The Youth at first defended himself and shot two Spaniards with his arrows and continued to resist the numbers that pressed upon him with his mantle and his dagger evading their blows by his extreme agility and wounding several Ercilla generously rushed in to his rescue and declared he deserved a reward for his uncommon bravery instead of being destroyed so unfairly The Youth in consequence of this treatment flung down his dagger and became the affectionate attendant of Ercilla Our Poet after relating this incident returns to the scene where his party was surprized in a hollow road and severely galled by the enemy who attacked them with showers of stones from the higher ground Ercilla forces his way up the precipice and after dispersing part of the Indian force effects his escape with  a few followers but all are wounded and obliged to leave their baggage in the possession of their numerous enemies  CANTO XXIX  OPENS with an encomium on the love of our country and the signal proofs of this virtue which the Araucanians displayed who notwithstanding their loss of four great battles in the space of three months still continue firm in their resolution of defending their liberty Caupolican proposes in a public assembly to set fire to their own habitations and leave themselves no alternative but that of killing or being killed The Chieftains all agree in this desperate determination Tucapel before they proceed to action against the Spaniards insists on terminating his difference with Rengo a rival Chieftain by a single combat A plain is appointed for this purpose all the people of Arauco assemble as spectators the Chiefs appear in complete armour and engage in a most obstinate and bloody conflict  CANTO XXX  AFTER many dreadful wounds on each side the two Chieftains closing with each other  fall together and after a fruitless struggle for victory remain speechless on the ground Caupolican who presided as judge of the combat descends from his seat and finding some signs of life in each orders them to be carried to their respective tents They recover and are reconciled The Spaniards leaving a garrison in their new fort under a captain named Reynoso had proceeded to the city of Imperial Caupolican endeavours to take advantage of this event He employs an artful Indian named Pran to examine the state of the fort Pran insinuates himself among the Indian servants belonging to the Spaniards He views the fort and endeavours to persuade a servile Indian named Andresillo to admit Caupolican and his forces while the Spaniards are sleeping Andresillo promises to meet Caupolican in secret and converse with him on this project  CANTO XXXI  OPENS with a spirited invective against treachery in war and particularly those traitors who betray their country Andresillo reveals all that had passed to his Spanish captain who promises him a great reward if he will assist in making the stratagem of the Indians an instrument of destruction  to those who contrived it They concert a plan for this purpose Andresillo meets Caupolican in secret and promises to introduce the Indian forces into the fort when the Spaniards are sleeping in the heat of the day Pran is sent forward to learn from Andresillo if all things are quiet just before the hour appointed for the assault He examines the state of the fort and finding the Spaniards apparently unprepared for defence hastens back to the Indian General who advances by a quick and silent march The Spaniards in the interim point all their guns and prepare for the most bloody resistance  CANTO XXXII  AFTER a panegyric on clemency and a noble censure of those enormous cruelties by which his countrymen sullied their military fame the Poet relates the dreadful carnage which ensued as the Indians approached the fort The Spaniards after destroying numbers by their artillery send forth a party of horse who cut the fugitives to pieces They inhumanly murder thirteen of their most distinguished prisoners by blowing them from the mouths of cannon but none of the confederate Chieftains whom the Poet has particularly  celebrated were included in this number for those highspirited Barbarians had refused to attend Caupolican in this assault as they considered it as disgraceful to attack their enemies by surprize The unfortunate Indian Leader seeing his forces thus unexpectedly massacred escapes with ten faithful followers and wanders through the country in the most calamitous condition The Spaniards endeavour by all the means they can devise to discover his retreat the faithful inhabitants of Arauco refuse to betray him  Ercilla in searching the country with a small party finds a young wounded female She informs him that marching with her husband she had the misfortune of seeing him perish in the late slaughterthat a friendly soldier in pity to her extreme distress had tried to end her miserable life in the midst of the confusion but had failed in his generous design by giving her an ineffectual woundthat she had been removed from the field of battle to that sequestered spot where she languished in the hourly hope of death which she now implores from the hand of Ercilla Our Poet consoles her dresses her wound and leaves one of his attendants to protect her On his return to the fort he discourses to his soldiers in praise of the fidelity and spirit displayed by the Indian females  comparing them to the chaste and constant Dido A young soldier of his train expresses his surprize on hearing Ercilla commend the Carthaginian Queen for a virtue to which he conceived she had no pretence From hence our Poet takes occasion to vindicate the injured Eliza from the slanderous misrepresentation of Virgil and flatters himself that the love of justice so natural to man will induce every reader to listen with pleasure to his defence of the calumniated Queen He then enters on her  real history  and relates circumstantially her lamentation over the murdered Sichaeus and the artifice by which she escaped with her treasures from her inhuman brother Pygmalionshe engages many of his attendants to share the chances of her voyage and having collected a supply of females from the island of Cyprus she directs her course to the coast of Africa  CANTO XXXIII  DIDO as our Poet continues her  more authentic story  purchases her dominion and raises her flourishing city The ambassadors of Iarbas arrive at Carthage to offer this celebrated Queen the alternative of marriage or war The Senate who are first informed of the proposal being fearful that  the chaste resolutions of their fair Sovereign may ruin their country attempt to engage her by a singular device to accept the hand of Iarbas They tell her that this haughty Monarch has sent to demand twenty of her privy counsellors to regulate his kingdom and that in consideration of their age and infirmities they must decline so unpleasant a service The Queen represents to them the danger of their refusal and the duty which they owe to their country declaring that she would most readily sacrifice her own life for the safety or advantage of her subjects The Senators then reveal to her the real demand of Iarbas and urge the necessity of her marriage for the preservation of the state The faithful Dido knows not what to resolve and demands three months to consider of this delicate and important pointat the close of that period she assembles her subjects and taking leave of them in a very affectionate harangue declares her resolution to die as the only means by which she can at once satisfy both Heaven and earth by discharging her duty to her people and at the same time preserving her faith inviolate to her departed Sichaeus Invoking his name she plunges a poniard in her breast and throws herself on a flaming pile which had been kindled for a different sacrifice Her grateful subjects lament her death  and pay divine honours to her memory  "This  Este es el cierto y verdadero cuento  De la famosa Dido disfamada  Que Virgilio Maron sin miramiento  Falseó su historia y castidad preciada  Por dar a sus ficciones ornamento  Pues vemos que esta Reyna importunada  Pudiéndose casar y no quemarse  Antes quemarse quiso que casarse  says our Poet is the true and genuine story of the famous defamed Dido whose most honoured chastity has been belied by the inconsiderate Virgil to embellish his poetical fictions"  Our Poet returns from this digression on Dido to the fate of the Indian Leader CaupolicanOne of the prisoners whom the Spaniards had taken in their search after this unfortunate Chief is at last tempted by bribes to betray his General He conducts the Spaniards to a spot near the sequestered retreat of Caupolican and directs them how to discover it but refuses to advance with them overcome by his dread of the Hero whom he is tempted to betray The Spaniards surround the house in which the Chieftain had taken refuge with his ten faithful associates Alarmed by a centinel he prepares for defence but being  soon wounded in the arm surrenders endeavouring to conceal his high character and to make the Spaniards believe him an ordinary soldier  With their accustom'd shouts and greedy toil  Our furious troops now riot in their spoil  Through the lone village their quick rapine spread  Nor leave unpillag'd e'en a single shed  When from a tent that plac'd on safer ground  The neighbouring hill's uncultur'd summit crown'd  A woman rush'd who in her hasty flight  Ran through the roughest paths along the rocky height  A Negro of our train who mark'd her way  Soon made the hapless fugitive his prey  For thwarting crags her doubtful steps impede  And the fair form was ill prepar'd for speed  For at her breast she bore her huddled son  To fifteen months the infant's life had run  From our brave captive sprung the blooming boy  Of both his parents the chief pride and joy  The Negro carelessly his victim brought  Nor knew th' important prize his haste had caught  Our soldiers now to catch the cooling tide  Had sallied to the murmuring river's side  When the unhappy Wife beheld her Lord  His strong arms bound with a disgraceful cord  Stript of each ensign of his past command  And led the pris'ner of our shouting band  Her anguish burst not into vain complaint  No female terrors her firm soul attaint  But breathing fierce disdain and anger wild  Thus she exclaim'd advancing with her child  The stronger arm that in this shameful band  Has tied thy weak effeminated hand  Had nobler pity to thy state exprest  If it had bravely pierc'd that coward breast  Wert thou the Warrior whose heroic worth  So swiftly flew around the spacious earth  Whose name alone unaided by thy arm  Shook the remotest clime with fear's alarm  Wert thou the Victor whose triumphant strain  Promis'd with rapid sword to vanquish Spain  To make new realms Arauco's power revere  And spread her empire o'er the Arctic sphere  Wretch that I am how was my heart deceiv'd  In all the noble pride with which it heav'd  When through the world my boasted title ran  Tresia the wife of great Caupolican  Now plung'd in misery from the heights of fame  My glories end in this detested shame  To see thee captive in a lonely spot  When death and honour might have been thy lot  What now avail thy scenes of happier strife  So dearly bought by many a nobler life  The wondrous feats that valor scarce believ'd  By thee with hazard and with toil atchiev'd  Where are the vaunted fruits of thy command  The laurels gather'd by this fetter'd hand  All sunk all turn'd to this abhorr'd disgrace  To live the slave of this ignoble race  Say had thy soul no strength thy hand no lance  To triumph o'er the fickle pow'r of chance  Dost thou not know that to the Warrior's name  A gallant exit gives immortal fame  Behold the burthen which my breast contains  Since of thy love no other pledge remains  Hadst thou in glory's arms resign'd thy breath  We both had follow'd thee in joyous death  Take take thy Son he was a tie most dear  Which spotless love once made my heart revere  Take himby generous pain and wounded pride  The currents of this fruitful breast are dried  Rear him thyself for thy gigantic frame  To woman turn'd a woman's charge may claim  A mother's title I no more desire  Or shameful children from a shameful sire  As thus she spoke with growing madness stung  The tender nursling from her arms she flung  With savage fury hast'ning from our sight  While anguish seem'd to aid her rapid flight  Vain were our efforts our indignant cries  Nor gentle prayers nor angry threats suffice  To make her breast where cruel frenzy burn'd  Receive the little innocent she spurn'd  The Spaniards after providing a nurse for this unfortunate child return with their prisoner Caupolican to their fort which they enter in triumph  The Indian General perceiving that all attempts to conceal his quality are ineffectual desires a conference with the Spanish Captain Reynoso  CANTO XXXIV  CAUPOLICAN entreats Reynoso to grant his life but without any signs of terror He affirms it will be the only method of appeasing the sanguinary hatred by which the contending nations are inflamed and he offers from his great influence over his country to introduce the Christian worship and to bring the Araucanians to  consider themselves as the subjects of the Spanish Monarch His proposals are rejected and he is sentenced to be impaled and shot to death with arrows He is unappall'd by this decree but first desires to be publicly baptized after which ceremony he is inhumanly led in chains to a scaffold He displays a calm contempt of death but on seeing a wretched Negro appointed his executioner his indignation bursts forth and he hurls the Negro from the scaffold entreating to die by a more honourable hand His horrid sentence is however executed He supports the agonies of the stake with patient intrepidity till a chosen band of archers put a period to his life  Our brave Ercilla expresses his abhorrence of this atrocious scene and adds that if he had been present this cruel execution should not have taken place  The consequence of it was such as Caupolican foretoldthe Araucanians determine to revenge his death and assemble to elect a new General The Poet makes an abrupt transition from their debate to relate the adventures of Don Garcia with whom he was himself marching to explore new regions The inhabitants of the districts they invade alarmed at the approach of the Spaniards  consult on the occasion An Indian named Tunconabala who had served under the Araucanians addresses the assembly and recommends to them a mode of eluding the supposed avaricious designs of the Spaniards by sending messengers to them who should assume an appearance of extreme poverty and represent their country as barren and thus induce the invaders to turn their arms towards a different quarter He offers to engage in this service himself The Indians adopt the project he recommends and remove their valuable effects to the interior parts of their country  CANTO XXXV  DON GARCIA being arrived at the boundaries of Chile which no Spaniard had passed encourages his soldiers in a spirited harangue to the acquisition of the new provinces which lay before them They enter a rude and rocky country in which they are exposed to many hazards by their deceitful guides Tunconabala meets them as he had projected with the appearance of extreme poverty and after many assurances of the sterility of that region advises them to return or to advance by a different path which he represents to them as dangerous but the only practicable road On  finding them resolved to press forward he supplies them with a guide They advance with great toil and danger Their guide escapes from them They continue their march through various hardships in a desolate region They at length discover a fertile plain and a large lake with many little inhabited islands As they approach the lake a large gondola with twelve oars advances to meet them the party it contained leap ashore and salute the Spaniards with expressions of amity  CANTO XXXVI  THE young Chieftain of the gondola supplies the Spaniards with provisions refusing to accept any reward and our Poet celebrates all the inhabitants of this region for their amiable simplicity of manners He visits one of the principal islands where he is kindly entertained He discovers that the lake had a communication with the sea by a very rough and dangerous channel this circumstance obliges the Spaniards though reluctant to return They lament the necessity of passing again through the hardships of their former road A young Indian undertakes to conduct them by an easier way But our adventurous Ercilla before the little army set forth on their return engages  ten chosen associates to embark with him in a small vessel and pass the dangerous channel He lands on a wild and sandy spot and advancing half a mile up the country engraves a stanza to record this adventure on the bark of a tree He repasses the channel and rejoins the Spanish troops who after much difficulty reach the city of Imperial Our Poet then touches on some particulars of his personal history which I mention in the slight sketch of his life He afterwards promises his reader to relate the issue of the debate among the Araucanian Chieftains on the election of their new General but recollecting in the instant that Spain herself is in arms he entreats the favour of his Sovereign to inspire him with new spirit that he may devote himself to that higher and more interesting subject  CANTO XXXVII  OUR Poet in this his last canto seems to begin a new work He enters into a discussion of Philip's right to the dominion of Portugal and his acquisition of that kingdom when sinking under the weight of this new subject he declares his resolution of leaving it to some happier Poet He recapitulates the various perils and hardships of  his own life and remarking that he has ever been unfortunate and that all his labours are unrewarded he consoles himself with the reflection that honour consists not in the possession of rewards but in the consciousness of having deserved them He concludes with a pious resolution to withdraw himself from the vain pursuits of the world and to devote himself to God  NOTE XI VERSE  At once the Bard of Glory and of Love    The Epic powers of Camoens have received their due honour in our language by the elegant and spirited  translation of Mr Mickle but our country is still a stranger to the lighter graces and pathetic sweetness of his shorter compositions These as they are illustrated by the Spanish notes of his indefatigable Commentator  Manuel de Faria  amount to two volumes in folio I shall present the reader with a specimen of his Sonnets for which he is celebrated as the rival of Petrarch Of the three translations which follow I am indebted for the two first to an ingenious friend from whom the public may wish me to have received more extensive obligations of a similar nature It may be proper to add that the first Sonnet of Camoens like that of Petrarch is a kind of preface to the amorous poetry of its author  SONETO I  EM quanto quis Fortuna que tivesse  Esperanca de algum contentamento  O gosto de hum suave pensamento  Me fez que seus effeytos escrevesse  Porèm temendo Amor que aviso desse  Minha escritura a algum juizo isento  Escureccome o engenho co' o tormento  Para que seus enganos naō dissesse  O vós que amor obriga a ser sogeytos  A diversas vontades quando lerdes  Num breve livro casos taō diversos  Verdades puras saō naō defeytos  Entendey que segundo o amor tiverdes  Tircis o entendimento de meus versos  SONETO XIX  ALMA minha gentil que te partiste  Taō cedo desta vida descontente  Repousa là no ceo eternamente  E viva eu cà na terra sempre triste  Se là no assento etereo onde subiste  Memoria desta vida se consente  Naō te esqueças de aquelle amor ardente  Que já nos olhos meus taō puro viste  Ese vires que póde merecerte  Algūa cousa a dor queme sicou  Da magoa sem remedio de perderte  Roga a Deos que teus annos encurtou  Que taō cedo de câ me leve a verte  Quaō cedo de meus olhos te levou  SONETO LXXII  QUANDO de minhas magoas a comprida  Maginaçaō os olhos me adormece  Em sonhos aquella alma me aparece  Que para mi foy sonho nesta vida  Lá numa soidade onde estendida  A vista por o campo desfallece  Corro apos ella ella entaō parece  Que maes de mi se alonga compelida  Brado Naō me fujays sombra benina  Ella os olhos em mi c'hum brado pejo  Como quem diz que ja naō pode ser  Torna a fugirme torno a bradar dina  E antes q' acabe em mene acordo vejo  Que nem hum breve engano posso ter  SONNET I  WHile on my head kind Fortune deign'd to pour  Her lavish boons and through my willing soul  Made tides of extasy and pleasure roll  I sung the raptures of each passing hour  But Love who heard me praise the golden shower  Resolv'd my fond presumption to controul  And painful darkness o'er my spirit stole  Lest I should dare to tell his treacherous power  O ye whom his hard yoke compels to bend  To others' will if in my various lay  Sad plaints ye find and fears and cruel wrong  To suffering nature and to truth attend  For in the measure ye have felt his sway  Your sympathizing hearts will feel my song  SONNET XIX ON THE DEATH OF THE POET'S MISTRESS DONNA CATALINA DE ATAIDE WHO DIED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY  GO gentle spirit now supremely blest  From scenes of pain and struggling virtue go  From thy immortal seat of heavenly rest  Behold us lingering in a world of woe  And if beyond the grave to saints above  Fond memory still the transient past pourtrays  Blame not the ardor of my constant love  Which in these longing eyes was wont to blaze  But if from virtue's source my sorrows rise  For the sad loss I never can repair  Be thine to justify my endless sighs  And to the Throne of Grace prefer thy prayer  'That Heaven who made thy span of life so brief  May shorten mine and give my soul relief  SONNET LXXII  WHile prest with woes from which it cannot flee  My fancy sinks and slumber seals my eyes  Her spirit hastens in my dreams to rise  Who was in life but as a dream to me  O'er a drear waste so wide no eye can see  How far its senseevading limit lies  I follow her quick step but ah she flies  Our distance widening by stern Fate's decree  Fly not from me kind shadow I exclaim  She with fix'd eyes that her soft thoughts reveal  And seem to say "Forbear thy fond design"  Still fliesI call her but her halfform'd name  Dies on my falt'ring tongueI wake and feel  Not e'en one short delusion may be mine  The Spanish Commentator of Camoens considers this vision as the most exquisite Sonnet of his author and affirms that it is superior to the much longer poem of Petrarch's on a similar idea It may amuse a curious reader to compare both Camoens and Petrarch on this occasion with Milton who has also written a Sonnet on the same subject The Commentator Faria has a very  pleasant remark on this species of composition He vindicates the dignity of the amorous Sonnet by producing an alphabetical list of two hundred great Poets who have thus complimented the object of their affection and he very gravely introduces Achilles as the leader of this choir for having celebrated Briseis If the Sonnets of the Portuguese' Poet are worthy of attention  his Elegies are perhaps still more so as they illustrate many particulars of his interesting life which ended in under the most cruel circumstances of neglect and poverty  Portugal has produced no less than fourteen Epic poems twelve in her own language and two in that of Spain At the head of these stands the Lusiad of Camoens The Malaca Conquistada of Francisco de Sa' de Menesisand the Ulyssea or Lisboa Edificada of Gabriel Pereira de Castro are two of the most eminent among its successorsFor a list of the Portuguese Epic Poets and for an elegant copy of the Malaca Conquistada I am indebted to the very liberal politeness of the Chevalier de Pinto the Ambassador of Portugal  NOTE XII VERSE  Where Eulogy with one eternal smile    Though a vain insipidity may be considered as the general characteristic of the French  Eloges  it is but just to remark that several of these performances are an honour to the country which produced them and particularly the little volume of  Eloges  lately published by Mr D'Alembert This agreeable Encomiast has varied and enlivened the tone  of panegyric by the most happy mixture of amusing anecdote judicious criticism and philosophical precept we may justly say of him what he himself has said of his predecessor Fontenelle  Il a solidement assuré sa gloire par ces Eloges si interessans pleins d'une raifon si fine et si profonde qui font aimer et respecter les lettres qui inspirent aux génies naissans la plus noble emulation et qui feront passer le nom de l'auteur à la posterité avec celui de la compagnie célebre dont il a été le digne organe et des grands hommes dont il s'est rendu l'egal en devenant leur panégyriste  D'Alembert Eloge de la Motte p  NOTE XIII VERSE  No great Examples rise but many a Rule    Before the appearance of Bossu's celebrated treatise on Epic poetry the French had a similar work written in Latin The learned Jesuit Mambrun published in a quarto volume entitled Dissertatic Peripatetica de Epico Carmine His Dissertation is founded on the principles of Aristotle whom he considers as infallible authority and he introduces the Greek Philosopher to decide the following very curious question which he argues with becoming gravity Whether  the action of a woman can be sufficiently splendid to prove a proper subject for an Epic poemHaving reasoned on this delicate point with more learning than gallantry he thus concludes the debate  Congruenter magis finem huic quaestioni ponere non licet quam verbis Aristotelis capite Poeticae ubi de moribus disputat  id est secunda proprietas morum est ut sint congruentes ut esse fortem mos est aliquis at non congruit mulieri fortem esse aut terribilem ut vertit Riccobonus vel  prudentem  ut Pacius  The latter interpretation of the word  would render the decision of these Philosophers very severe indeed on the Female character by supposing it incapable of displaying both fortitude and prudenceThe Fair Sex have found an advocate on this occasion in a French Epic Poet The famous Chapelain in the preface to his unfortunate Pucelle has very warmly attacked these ungallant maxims of Mambrun and Aristotle In speaking of certain critics who had censured the choice of his subject before the publication of his poem he says  Ceuxcy jurant sur le texte d'Aristote maintiennent que la femme est une erreur de la nature qui ayant toujours intention de  faire un homme s'arreste souvent en chemin et se voit contrainte par la resistance de la matiere de laisser son dessein imparfait Ils tiennent la force corporelle tellement necessaire dans la composition d'un heros que quand il n'y auroit autre defaut à reprocher à la femme ils luy en refuseroient le nom pour cela seulement qu'elle n'a pas la vigueur d'un Athlete et que la mollesse de sa complexion l'empesche de pouvoir durer au travail Ils n'estiment ce Sexe capable d'aucune pensée heroique dans la creance que l'esprit suit le temperament du corps et que dans le corps de la femme l'esprit ne peut rien concevoir qui ne se sente de sa foiblesseCes Messieurs me pardonneront toutesois si je leur dis qu'ils ne considerent pas trop bien quelle est la nature de la vertu heroique qu'ils en definissent l'essence par un de ses moindres accidens et qu'ils en font plutost une vertu brutale qu'une vertu divineIls se devroient souvenir que cette vertu n'a presque rien à faire avec le corps et qu'elle consiste non dans les efforts d'un Milon de Crotone où l'esprit n'a aucune part mais en ceux des ames nées pour les grandes choses quand par une ardeur plusqu' humaine elles s'elevent audessus d'ellesmesmes qu'elles forment quelque dessein dont l'utilité est aussi grande que la difficulté et qu'elles choisissent les moyens de l'executer avec  constance et hauteur de courage Pour prevenus qu'ils soient en faveurs des hommes je ne pense pas qu'ils voulussent attribuer à leur ame un seul avantage auquel l'ame de la femme ne pust aspirer ni faire deux especes des deux sexes desquels la raison de tous les sages n'a fait qu'une jusqu'icyje ne croy pas non plus qu'ils imaginent que les vertus morales ayent leur siege ailleurs que dans la volonté ou dans l'entendement Mais si elles y ont leur siege et si l'on ne peut dire que ces deux facultés soient autres dans l'ame de la femme que dans l'ame de l'homme ils ne peuvent sans absurdité accorder une de ces vertus à l'homme et ne l'accorder pas à la femme En effet cette belle pensée d'Aristote qui a donné occasion à leur erreur est si peu physique qu'elle fait plus de tort à la philosophie du Lycée qu'elle n'appuye l'opinion de ceux que nous combattons"  Chapelain then enters into an historical defence of Female dignity and opposes the authority of Plato to that of Aristotle concerning the propriety of women's ever appearing on the great theatre of active life Happy had he supported the Female cause as forcibly in the execution of his poem as in the arguments of his preface but Chapelain was unfortunately one of the many examples which every country affords that the most perfect union of virtue and erudition is utterly insufficient to  form a Poet and as he had the ill fate to be persecuted by the pitiless rigour of Boileau his inharmonious poem can never sink into a desirable oblivion The treatise of Mambrun seems to have excited among the French an eagerness to distinguish themselves in the field of Epic poetry for several Epic poems were published in France in a few years after that work appeared but most of them and particularly those on scriptural subjects were hardly ever known to exist  Le Jonas inconnu seche dans la poussiere  Le David imprimé n'a point vu la lumiere  Le Moïse commence à moisir par les bords  BOILEAU Sat ix  The Alaric of Scudery and the Clovis of Desmarests can scarce be reckoned more fortunate but in this band of unsuccessful Epic writers there was one Poet of whom even the severe Boileau could not allow himself to speak ill this was Le Moine the author of St Louis The Satirist being asked why he had never mentioned the poetry of Le Moine replied with the two following verses parodied from Corneille  Il s'est trop élevé pour en dire du mal  Il s'est trop égaré pour en dire du bien  The judicious and candid Heyne has bestowed considerable applause on Le Moine in one of his notes to the th book of Virgil where he examines the different methods by which the Epic Poets have introduced their various pictures of futurity From his account Le Moine excels in this article I can speak only from the opinion of this learned Critic for the neglected French Poet is become so rare that I have sought in vain for a copy of his workThe number of obscure Epic writers in France is very trifling compared to those which Italy has produced the Italians have been indefatigable in this species of composition and as if they had resolved to leave no Hero unsung their celebrated Novelist Giraldi Cinthio has written an Epic poem in twentysix cantos on the exploits of Hercules  NOTE XIV VERSE  Keen Boileau shall not want his proper praise    Nicolas Boileau Despreaux was born  in  or  near  Paris for it is a contested point on the first of November and died in March of a dropsy the very disease which terminated the life of his English rival The Lutrin of Boileau still considered by some French Critics of the present time as the best poem to which France has  given birth was first published in It is with great reason and justice that Voltaire confesses the Lutrin inferior to the Rape of the Lock Few Poets can be so properly compared as Pope and Boileau and wherever their writings will admit of comparison we may without any national partiality adjudge the superiority to the English Bard These two great authors resembled each other as much in the integrity of their lives as in the subjects and execution of their several compositions There are two actions recorded of Boileau which sufficiently prove that the inexorable Satirist had a most generous and friendly heart when Patru the celebrated Advocate who was ruined by his passion for literature found himself under the painful necessity of selling his expensive library and had almost agreed to part with it for a moderate sum Boileau gave him a much superior price and after paying the money added this condition to the purchase that Patru should retain during his life the possession of the books The succeeding instance of the Poet's generosity is yet noblerwhen it was rumoured at court that the King intended to retrench the pension of Corneille Boileau hastened to Madame de Montespan and said that his Sovereign equitable as he was could not without injustice grant a pension to an author like himself just ascending Parnassus  and take it from Corneille who had so long been seated on the summit that he entreated her for the honour of the King to prevail on his Majesty rather to strike off  his  pension than to withdraw that reward from a man whose title to it was incomparably greater and that he should more easily console himself under the loss of that distinction than under the affliction of seeing it taken away from such a Poet as Corneille This magnanimous application had the success which it deserved and it appears the more noble when we recollect that the rival of Corneille was the intimate friend of Boileau  The long and unreserved intercourse which subsisted between our Poet and Racine was highly beneficial and honourable to both The dying farewell of the latter is the most expressive eulogy on the private character of Boileau Je regarde comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous said the tender Racine in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend  NOTE XV VERSE  Nor gentle Gresset shall thy sprightly rhyme    This elegant and amiable writer was born at Amiens and educated in the society of the Jesuits to whom he has paid a grateful compliment in bidding  them adieu At the age of twentysix he published his Ververt a poem in four cantos which commemorates  La cause infortunée  D'un Perroquet non moins brillant qu' Enée  Non moins dévot plus malheureux que lui  Voltaire has spoken invidiously of this delightful performance but a spirited French Critic has very justly vindicated the merits of Gresset in the following remark  Le Ververt sera toujours un poeme charmant et inimitable sans souiller sa plume par l'impiété et la licence qui deshonorent celle de l'auteur de  La Pucelle  le Poete a su y répandre un agrément une fraîcheur et une vivacité de coloris qui le rendent aussi piquant dans les détails qu'il est riche et ingénieux dans la fiction On placera toujours cet agreable badinage parmi les productions originales propres à faire aimer des etrangers la gaieté Françoise en écartant toute mauvaise idée de nos moeurs  NOTE XVI VERSE  See lovely Boccage in ambition strong    Madame du Boccage is known to the English reader as the correspondent of Lord Chesterfield This ingenious and spirited Lady has written three poems of  the Epic kindLe Paradis Terrestre in six cantos from Milton La Mort d'Abel in five cantos from Gesner and a more original composition in ten cantos on the exploits of Columbus I have alluded to a passage in the last poem where Zama the daughter of an Indian Chief is thus described  Comme Eve elle etoit nue une egale innocence  L'offre aux regards sans honte et voile ses appas  Les Graces qu'elle ignore accompagnent ses pas  Et pour tout vêtement en formant sa parure  D'un plumage azuré couvrirent sa ceinture  The works of this elegant female Poet contain an animated version of Pope's Temple of Fame And she has added to her poetry an account of her travels through England Holland and Italy in a series of entertaining letters addressed to Madame du Perron her sister  NOTE XVII VERSE  To swell the glory of her great Voltaire    Though the Henriade has been frequently reprinted and the partizans of Voltaire have endeavoured to make it a national point of honour to support its reputation it seems at length to be sinking under that neglect and oblivion which never fail to overtake every feeble offspring of the Epic Muse  Several of our most eminent Critics have attacked this performance with peculiar severity and some have condemned it on the most opposite principles merely because it does not coincide with their respective systems Their sentence has been passed only in short and incidental remarks but a French writer inflamed by personal animosity against Voltaire has raised three octavo volumes on the defects of this single poem Mr Clement in his "  Entretiens sur le Poeme Epique relativement à la Henriade  " has endeavoured to prove it utterly deficient in all the essential points of Epic poetryin the structure of its general plan in the conduct of its various parts in sentiment in character in style His work indeed displays an acrimonious detestation of the Poet whom he examines and perhaps there is hardly any human composition which could support the scrutiny of so rigid an inquisitor the Henriade is utterly unequal to it for in many articles we are obliged to confess that the justice of the Critic is not inferior to his severity He discovers in his dissection of the Poem the skill of an anatomist with the malignity of an assassin If any thing can deserve such rigorous treatment it is certainly the artifice of Voltaire who in his Essay on Epic Poetry has attempted with much ingenuity to sink the reputation of all the great Epic Writers that he might raise himself  to their level an attempt in which no author can ultimately succeed for as D'Alembert has admirabiy remarked on a different occasion  Le public laissera l'amour propre de chaque ecrivain faire son plaidoyer rira de leurs efforts non de genie mais de raisonnement pour hausser leur place et finira par mettre chacun à la sienne  NOTE XVIII VERSE  And shrouded in a mist of moral spleen    It seems to be the peculiar infelicity of Pope that his moral virtues have had a tendency to diminish his poetical reputation Possessing a benevolent spirit and wishing to make the art to which he devoted his life as serviceable as he could to the great interests of mankind he soon quitted the higher regions of poetry for the more level and more frequented field of Ethics and of Satire He declares with a noble pride arising from the probity of his intention  That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long  But stoop'd to truth and moraliz'd his song  The severity of Criticism has from hence inferred that his imagination was inferior to the other faculties of his mind and that he possessed not that vigour of genius which might enable him to rank with our more sublime and pathetic Bards This  inference appears to me extremely defective both in candour and in reason it would surely be more generous and I will venture to add more just to assign very different causes for his having latterly applied himself to moral and satyric composition If his preceding poems displayed only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderness we might indeed very fairly conjecture that he quitted the kind of poetry where these qualities are particularly required because Nature directed him to shine only as the Poet of reasonBut his earlier productions will authorize an opposite conclusion At an age when few authors have produced any capital work Pope gave the world two poems one the offspring of imagination and the other of sensibility which will ever stand at the head of the two poetical classes to which they belong his Rape of the Lock and his Eloise have nothing to fear from any rivals either of past or of future time When a writer has displayed such early proofs of exquisite fancy and of tender enthusiasm those great constituents of the real Poet ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater scope and freer exercise to these qualities rather than to assert that he did not possess them in a superlative degree Why then it may be asked did he confine himself to compositions in which these have little share The life and character of Pope will perfectly explain  the reasons why he did not always follow the higher suggestions of his own natural genius He had entertained an opinion that by stooping to truth and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the passing time he should be most able to benefit mankind The idea was perhaps illfounded but his conduct in consequence ofit was certainly noble Its effects however were most unhappy for it took from him all his enjoyment of life and may injure in some degree his immortal reputation by suffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools he fell into the splenetic delusion that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly and from hence he has been reproached for supposing that all human merit was confined to himself and to a few of his most intimate correspondents  There was an amiable peculiarity in the character of Pope which had great influence both on his conduct and compositionhe embraced the sentiments of those he loved with a kind of superstitious regard his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affectionate heart it was this which led him at the request of his idol Bolingbroke to write a sublime poem on metaphysical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend it was this which urged him almost to quarrel with Mr Allen in compliance with the caprices of a  female friend it was this which induced him in the warmth of gratitude to follow the absurd hints of Warburton with all the blindness of infatuated affection Whoever examines the life and writings of Pope with a minute and unprejudiced attention will find that his excellencies both as a Poet and a Man were peculiarly his own and that his failings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment or the artifice of his real and pretended friends The lavish applause and the advice of his favourite Atterbury were perhaps the cause of his preserving the famous character of Addison which finely written as it is all the lovers of Pope must wish him to have suppressed Few of his friends had integrity or frankness sufficient to persuade him that his satires would destroy the tranquillity of his life and cloud the lustre of his fame yet to the honour of Lyttelton be it remembered that he suggested such ideas to the Poet in the verses which he wrote to him from Rome with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friendship  No more let meaner Satire dim the rays  That flow majestic from thy nobler bays  In all the flowery paths of Pindus stray  But shun that thorny that unpleasing way  Nor when each soft engaging Muse is thine  Address the least attractive of the Nine  This generous admonition did not indeed produce its intended effect for other counsellors had given a different bias to the mind of the Poet and the malignity of his enemies had exasperated his temper yet he afterwards turned his thoughts towards the composition of a national Epic poem and possibly in consequence of the hint which this Epistle of Lyttelton contains The intention was formed too late for it arose in his decline of life Had he possessed health and leisure to execute such a work I am persuaded it would have proved a glorious acquisition to the literature of our country the subject indeed which he had chosen must be allowed to have an unpromising appearance but the opinion of Addison concerning his Sylphs which was surely honest and not invidious may teach us hardly ever to decide against the intended works of a superior genius Yet in all the Arts we are perpetually tempted to pronounce such decisions I have frequently condemned subjects which my friend Romney had selected for the pencil but in the sequel my opinion only proved that I was nearsighted in those regions of imagination where his keener eyes commanded all the prospect  NOTES TO THE FOURTH EPISTLE  NOTE I VERSE  PROCEED ye Sisters of the tuneful Shell    For the advice which I have thus ventured to give such of my fair readers as have a talent for poetry I shall produce them a much higher poetical authority In the age of Petrarch an Italian Lady named Giustina Perrot was desirous of distinguishing herself by this pleasing accomplishment but the remarks of the world which represented it  as improper for her sex discouraged her so far that she was almost tempted to relinquish her favourite pursuit In her doubts on this point she consulted the celebrated Poet of her country in an  elegant Sonnet and received his answer on the interesting subject in the same poetical form I shall add the two Sonnets with an imitation of each  IO vorrei pur drizzar queste mie piume  Colà Signor dove il desio n'invita  E dopo morte rimaner' in vita  Col chiaro di virtute inclyto lume  Ma' volgo inerte che dal rio costume  Vinto ha d' ogni suo ben la via smarrita  Come degna di biasmo ogn' hor m' addita  Ch' ir tenti d' Elicona al sacro fiume  All ago al fuso piu ch' al lauro o al mirto  Come che qui non sia la gloria mia  Vuol ch' habbia sempre questa mente intesa  Dimmi tu hormai che per piu dritta via  A Parnasso t' en vai nobile spirto  Dovrò dunque lasciar si degna impresa  LA gola e 'l sonno e l' oziose piume  Hanno del mondo ogni virtù

spirto  Non lasciar la magnanima tua impresa  THE SONNET OF GIUSTINA TO PETRARCH  GLADLY would I exchange inglorious ease  For future fame the Poet's fond desire  And still to live in spite of death aspire  By Virtue's light that darkness cannot seize  But stupified by Custom's blank decrees  The idle vulgar void of liberal fire  Bid me with scorn from Helicon retire  And rudely blame my generous hope to please  Distaffs not laurels to your sex belong  They cryas honour were beyond our view  To such low cares they wish my spirit bent  Say thou who marchest 'mid the favor'd few  To high Parnassus with triumphant song  Should I abandon such a fair intent  THE ANSWER OF PETRARCH  LUXURIOUS pleasure and lethargic ease  Have deaden'd in the world each bright desire  Our thoughts no more with Nature's force aspire  Custom's cold powers the drooping fancy seize  So lost each light that taught the soul to please  Each heavenly spark of lifedirecting fire  That all who join the Heliconian choir  Are frantic deem'd by Folly's dull decrees  What charms what worth to Laurelwreaths belong  Naked and poor Philosophy we view  Exclaims the crowd on fordid gain intent  Associates in

Paradise Lost for the sum of five pounds on the condition of receiving fifteen  pounds more at three subsequent periods to be regulated by the sale of the PoemFor the ceiling at Whitehall Rubens received three thousand pounds  NOTE III VERSE  Receive the Laurel from Imperial Charles    Ariosto is said to have been publicly crowned with laurel at Mantua by the Emperor Charles the Vth towards the end of the year This fact has been disputed by various writers but it seems to be sufficiently established by the researches of Mazzuchelli  The custom of crowning Poets with laurel is almost as ancient as poetry itself says the Abbé du Resnel in his Recherches sur les Poetes couronnez a work which contains but scanty information on this curious topic Petrarch is generally supposed to have revived this ancient solemnity which had been abolished as a pagan institution in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius It appears however from two passages in the writings of Boccacio that Dante had entertained serious thoughts of this honourable distinction which his exile precluded him from receiving as he chose says his Biographer to be crown'd only in his native city  An amusing volume might be written on the honours which have been paid to Poets in different ages and in various parts of the world It is remarkable that the most unpolished nations have been the most lavish in rewarding their Bards  There are two instances on record in which poetical talents have raised their possessors even to sovereign dominion The Scythians chose the Poet Thamyris for their king though he was not a native of their country    Hist Poet Script Edit Gale p  Saxo Grammaticus begins the sixth book of his History by relating that the Danes bestowed their vacant diadem on the Poet Hiarnus as a reward for his having composed the best epitaph on their deceased sovereign Frotho From the four Latin verses which the Historian has given us as a translation of this extraordinary epitaph we may venture to affirm that the poetical monarch obtained his crown on very easy conditions  NOTE IV VERSE  For him her fountains gush with golden streams    Of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary Poet his friend and biographer Montalvan has given a particular account This author concludes that Lope de Vega gained by his dramatic works alone a sum nearly equal to pounds sterling the revenue arising from  the posts he held and from his pension was very considerable His opulence was much encreased by the most splendid instances of private liberality He received many costly presents from various characters to whom he was personally unknown and he was himself heard to say in speaking of his generous patron that the Duke of Sessa alone had given him at different periods of his life sums almost amounting to six thousand pounds  It must be confessed that the noble patrons of English poetry have not equalled this example of Spanish munificence even if we admit the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the generosity of Lord Southampton to Shakespeare and of Sir Philip Sidney to Spenser Considering the liberality for which our nation is so justly celebrated it is remarkable that not a single English Poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs yet Spenser had every claim to the bounty of Elizabeth he sung her praises in a strain which might gratify her pride and of all who have flattered the great he may justly be considered as the most worthy of reward His song was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy and the sex of his idol may be said to purify his incense from all the offensive particles of servile adulation The neglect which he experienced from the vain imperious  and ungrateful Elizabeth appears the more striking when we recollect that her lovely rival the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots signalized her superior generosity by a magnificent present of plate to the French Poet Ronsard This neglected Bard was once the darling of France and perhaps equalled Lope de Vega in the honours which he received his sovereign Charles the Ninth composed some elegant verses in his praise and the city of Toulouse presented him with a Minerva of massive silver  If our princes and nobles have not equalled those of other kingdoms in liberality to the great Poets of their country England may yet boast the name of a private gentleman who discovered in this respect a most princely spirit no nation either ancient or modern can produce an example of munificence more truly noble then the annual gratuity which Akenside received from Mr Dyson a tribute of generous and affectionate admiration endeared to its worthy possessor by every consideration which could make it honourable both to himself and to his patron  It has been lately lamented by an elegant and accomplished writer who had too much reason for the complaint that  "the profession of Literature by far the most laborious of any leads to no  real benefit"  Experience undoubtedly proves that it has a general tendency to impoverish its votaries and the legislators of every country would act perhaps a wise at all events an honourable part if they corrected this tendency by establishing public emoluments for such as eminently distinguish themselves in the various branches of science It is surely possible to form such an establishment which without proving a national burthen might aggrandize the literary glory of the nation by preserving her men of letters from the evils so frequently connected with their pursuits by securing to those who deserve it the possession of ease and honour without damping their emulation or destroying their independence  NOTES TO THE FIFTH EPISTLE  NOTE I VERSE  THE loose Petronius gave the maxim birth    Aristotle has said but little in his Poetics concerning that weighty point which has so much employed and embarrassed the modern Criticsthe machinery of the Epic poem and the little which he has said might rather furnish an argument for its exclusion than justify its use But Rome in her most degenerate days produced a writer to whose authority contemptible as it is most frequent appeals have been made in this curious literary  question In almost every modern author who has touched however slightly on Epic poetry we may find at least some part of the following sentence from Petronius Arbiter  Ecce belli civilis ingens opus quisquis attigerit nisi plenus litteris sub onere labetur Non enim res gestae versibus comprehendendae sunt quod longe melius historici faciunt sed per ambages deorumque ministeria fabulosum sententiarum tormentum praecipitandus est liber spiritus ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides  These remarks on the necessity of celestial agents were evidently made to depreciate the Pharsalia of Lucan and Petronius may be called a fair Critic as Pope said of Milbourne on his opposition to Dryden because he produces his own poetry in contrast to that which he condemns His specimen of the manner in which he thought an Epic poem should be conducted sufficiently proves the absurdity of his criticism for how insipid is the fable in those verses which he has opposed to the Pharsalia when compared to the first book of Lucan Yet the Epic composition of Petronius has not wanted admirers a Dutch Commentator is bold enough to say that he prefers this single rhapsody to three hundred volumes of such poetry as  Lucan's an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with Boileau  Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire  If men of letters in the age of Lucan differed in their sentiments concerning machinery the great changes that have since happened in the world and the disquisitions which have appeared on the subject are very far from having reconciled the judgment of modern writers on this important article Two eminent Critics of the present time have delivered opinions on this topic so singularly opposite to each other that I shall transcribe them both  "In a theatrical entertainment which employs both the eye and the ear it would be a gross absurdity to introduce upon the stage superior Beings in a visible shape There is not place for such objection in an Epic poem and Boileau with many other Critics declares strongly for that sort of machinery in an Epic poem But waving authority which is apt to impose upon the judgment let us draw what light we can from reason I begin with a preliminary remark that this matter is but indistinctly handled  by Critics The poetical privilege of animating insensible objects for enlivening a description is very different from what is termed  machinery  where deities angels devils or other supernatural powers are introduced as real personages mixing in the action and contributing to the catastrophe and yet these two things are constantly jumbled together in the reasoning The former is founded on a natural principle but can the latter claim the same authority So far from it that nothing is more unnatural Its effects at the same time are deplorable First it gives an air of fiction to the whole and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections and to move our passions which of itself is sufficient to explode machinery whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination And next were it possible by disguising the fiction to delude us into a notion of reality which I think can hardly be an insuperable objection would still remain which is that the aim or end of an Epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is introduced for an evident reason that virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endued  with passions and affections like our own that is by human actions and as for moral instruction it is clear that none can be drawn from Beings who act not upon the same principles with us Homer it is true introduces the Gods into his fable but the religion of his country authorized that liberty it being an article in the Grecian creed that the Gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs I must however observe that Homer's Deities do no honour to his poems Fictions that transgress the bounds of nature seldom have a good effect they may inflame the imagination for a moment but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste They may be of some use to the lower rank of writers but an author of genius has much finer materials of nature's production for elevating his subject and making it interestingVoltaire in his Essay upon Epic Poetry talking of the Pharsalia observes judiciously that the proximity of time the notoriety of events the character of the age enlightened and political joined with the solidity of Lucan's subject deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction Is it not amazing that a Critic who reasons so justly with respect to others can be so  blind with respect to himself Voltaire not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior Beings introduces them into the action In the sixth canto of the Henriade St Louis appears in person and terrifies the soldiers in the seventh canto St Louis sends the God of Sleep to Henry and in the tenth the demons of Discord Fanaticism War c assist Aumale in a single combat with Turenne and are driven away by a good angel brandishing the sword of God To blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals makes a bad figure at any rate and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry IV This singly is sufficient to make the Henriade a shortlived poem were it otherwise possessed of every beauty"    Elements of Criticism  vol ii p th edition  "The Pagan Gods and Gothic Fairies were equally out of credit when Milton wrote He did well therefore to supply their room with Angels and Devils If these too should wear out of the popular creed and they seem in a hopeful way from the liberty some late Critics have taken with them I know not what other expedients  the Epic Poet might have recourse to but this I knowthe Pomp of verse the energy of description and even the finest moral paintings would stand him in no stead Without  admiration  which cannot be effected but by the marvellous of celestial intervention I mean the agency of superior natures really existing or by the illusion of the fancy taken to be so no Epic poem can be longlived I am not afraid to instance in the Henriade itself which notwithstanding the elegance of the composition will in a short time be no more read than the Gondibert of Sir W Davenant and for the same reason"    Letters on Chivalry and Romance  Letter X  I have thus ventured to confront these eminent critical antagonists that while they engage and overthrow each other we may observe the injustice produced by the spirit of systematical criticism even in authors most respectable for their talents and eruditionHere is the unfortunate Voltaire placed between two critical fires which equally destory him The  first  Critic asserts that the Henriade must be shortlived because the Poet  has introduced invisible and superior agents  the  second  denounces the same fate against it because  it wants  the  agency of superior natures  yet surely every reader of Poetry who is not influenced by any particular system will readily allow that if Voltaire had treated his subject with true Epic spirit in all other points neither the introduction nor the absence of St Louis could be singly sufficient to plunge the Henriade in oblivion Indeed the learned author who has spoken in so peremptory a manner concerning the necessity of supernatural agents to preserve the existence of an Epic poem appears rather unfortunate in the two examples by which he endeavours to support his doctrine for the Epic poems both of Davenant and Voltaire have sufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot without considering the article of Machinery  If I have warmly opposed any decisions of this exalted Critic it is from a persuasion in which I may perhaps be mistaken that  some  of his maxims have a strong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both an art on which his genius and learning have cast  many  rays of pleasing and of useful light  NOTE II VERSE  But howling dogs the fancied Orpheus tore    This anecdote of Neanthus the son of King Pittacus is related by Lucian The curious reader may find it in the second volume of Dr Francklin's spirited translation of that lively author page of the quarto edition  NOTE III VERSE  And spotless Laurels in that field be won    The Indian mythology as it has lately been illustrated in the writings of Mr Holwell is finely calculated to answer the purpose of any poetical genius who may wish to introduce new machinery into the serious Epic Poem Besides the powerful charm of novelty it would have the advantage of not clashing with our national religion for the endeavours of Mr Holwell to reconcile the ancient and pure doctrine of Bramah with the dispensation of Christ have so far succeeded that if his system does not satisfy a theologist it certainly affords a sufficient basis for the structure of a Poem In perusing his account of the Indian scripture every reader of  imagination may I think perceive that the Shastah might supply a poetical spirit with as rich a mass of ideal treasure as fancy could wish to work uponAn Epic Poet desirous of laying the scene of his action in India would be more embarrassed to find interesting Heroes than proper DivinitiesHad justice and generosity inspired and guided that English valour which has signalized itself on the plains of Indostan had the arms of our country been employed to deliver the native Indians from the oppressive usurpation of the Mahometan powers such exploits would present to the Epic Muse a subject truly noble and the mythology of the East might enrich it with the most splendid decorations Whether it be possible or not to find such a subject in the records of our Indian history I leave the reader to determineOur great Historian of the Roman empire has intimated in a note to the first volume of his immortal work that  "the wonderful expedition of Odin which deduces the enmity of the Goths and Romans from so memorable a cause might supply the noble groundwork of an Epic poem"  The idea is certainly both just and splendid Had Gray been ever tempted to engage in such a work he would probably have convinced us that the Northern mythology has still sufficient power to seize and enchant  the imagination as much in Epic as in Lyric composition  It may amuse our speculative Critics to consider how far the  religious Gothic fables  should be introduced or rejected to render such a performance most interesting to a modern reader Few judges would agree in their sentiments on the question and perhaps the great dispute concerning Machinery cannot be fairly adjusted till some happy genius shall possess ambition and perseverance enough to execute two Epic poems in the one adopting and in the other rejecting supernatural agents for Reason alone is by no means an infallible conductor in the province of Fancy and in the poetical as well as the philosophical world experiment is the surest guide to truth  END OF THE FOURTH VOLUME
