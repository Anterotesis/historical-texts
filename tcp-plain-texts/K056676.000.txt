little into the History of our Trade with  France  for the last or Years And because some Period of Time is proper in all such Cases to take a Rise from it shall be placed at the Year If any think that Time is not sufficiently remote they shall be fairly followed let them go back as far as they please In the mean while I must take Notice to the  Reader  that the Particulars are too copious and extensive and especially their Numbers so pressing that no Time or Room can be spar'd for  Preambles  and  Introductions  About the Year the general Book of Rates was made in  England  according to an Act of Parliament whereby a Subsidy of Tonnage was laid on  Wines  and  Brandies  and a Subsidy of Poundage after the Rate of  l per Cent  upon all Goods and Merchandizes Imported  In Imitation of this in the Year the  French  made a General  Tariff  or Book of Rates wherein they followed us in Rating all Goods and Merchandizes at a Tax of about  l per Cent ad Valorem  except that for the Encouragement of their own People to improve in Trade and Manufactures all the Manufactures of  Silk Gold Silver Hair Thread  and  Wool  were Rated at  per Cent  according to their Value This  Tariff  was es  eemed by all the Nations in these parts of Europe to be very easy and not the least Interruption to their Trade with  France  That the  Reader  may see at once what was paid upon our  English Manufactures  by that  Tariff  and what has been laid on in  France  since that time the foregoing Table is plac'd at the begining of this Paper and also as what there will be Occasion often to mention and refer to Out of which the  Whalebone Fins  and  Oyl  might have been omitted because we have no Share of that Trade But as it may be useful for the Information of some People the whole is above Incerted  All our  Woollen Manufactures  Exported from  England  to  France  are reduced to the old Duties payable by the  Tariff  of Except  BroadCloth  and  Serges  which are to pay as by the  Tariff  of that also being capable of being moderated by Commissioners thus  BroadCloth  which from the Year paid  Livres  will now pay only  Livres  Mill'd  Serges  which paid  Livres  now  Livres  All other wollen Goods pay after the  Tariff  of as aforesaid when their  Wines  paid Duty here but  l s per Ton  and  Brandy  but  l s  This part being thus stated let us turn the Tables and view the other side of the Trade viz Our Import from  France  where the Particulars will be very surprizing and this following Conclusion is most natural there from viz That if we Traded with  France  to our Advantage before much more must we do so now for the State of the Trade between  England  and  France  stands thus  An Account of the several Duties which were payable upon  French  Goods Imported

Dowlas    Ells           Every True  Britain  whose Concern is for his Countries Interest  must look upon this Table of Duties with great Satisfaction  The setting this Account against the former clears up  the Treaty of Commerce  so effectually that farther Enlargements must seem unnecessary Nevertheless since Matters of Fact concur it shall next be shewed what Regard Her Majesty has had to the other TradingInterest of Her Subjects How the Ports of  France  are opened to Them upon equal Terms with the  French  Subjects themselves and that even in some things prejudicial so themselves as in the Levant Trade in particular  The  Hudsons Bay  Company Pray that the  French  may surrender all the Forts and Settlements in  Hudsons Bay  and  Straight  and be obliged to renounce all Right and Pretensions thereto for the Future  Granted  And that they make Restitution of Damages to the Value of  l  Sterl  Granted  The Quantum only being referr'd to Comm  ssioners  The  Turky  or  Levant Company  Pray that They may have the  ame  i  erty of Trade in  France  as the  French  themselves and not to pay higher Duties than by the  Tariff  of  Granted  And that They be allowed to carry Goods to all Parts of  France  from the  Levant  directly or the Goods of the  Levant  viz  Raw Silks  c from  GreatBritain  Granted  as in  The  EastIndia Company  Pray that the Prohibitions and high Duties laid in  France  on  EastIndia  Goods sent from  England  may be taken off and to be on the same foot as in the first of King  Charle  's Reign  Granted  And yet the Prohibition in  England  of  EastIndia  Goods from any Place but the  EastIndies  continues  The  Virginia  Merchants Pray That the  Tobacco  of the  English  Plantations be Imported into  France  under a reasonable Duty and the Importers to sell it without Subjection to the  Farmers  Granted  Under the sameDuty which other Nations pay as to the Farm referr'd to the Commissioners  Lyme Regis  Prays The Prohibition of Woollen Manufactures and the high Duties laid in  France  may be taken off and the said Goods be Imported into  France  as formerly  Granted  The Merchants of  Bristol  Pray The same as above from  Lyme  as also that Tonage of Ships be abolished on both Sides  Granted  And that all our Merchants be permitted to Buy and Sell  Tobacco  in  France  under moderate Customs without being subjected to the Farmers  Referred to the Commissioners  That nothing might be wanting to secure to  Great Britain  a compleat Freedom of their Trade to  France  all the Advantages of the Treaties  France  has made with other Nations are contained in this Treaty and all the Privileges stipulated for them are by her Majesty's Care for her Subjects Profit made our own as by the  Eighth  and other  Article    whereby it is stipulated that her Majesty's Subjects shall be Treated in  France  in the same manner as the Nations they most favoured and even as the  French  King's own Subjects  The  Ninth Article  adds  And all Prohibitions Tariffs Edicts Declarations Decrees made in  France  since the said  Tariff  of contrary thereunto in Respect of the Goods and Merchandizes of  Great Britain  shall be repealed  As to this it is objected that it is not said  Goods and Merchandizes of the Subjects of  Great Britain but  Goods and Merchandizes of  Great Britain  which implyes  say they  the Manufactures of  Great Britain  only  But the Absurdity here is so gross that it is strange the Wisdom of the  Turkey Company  should fall into it For if it had been meant of the Manufactures of  Great Britain  only it would have been said  The  GROWTH  and  PRODUCE  not the Goods and Merchandizes  By Growth and Produce indeed the Manufactures had been understood but by the Goods and Merchandizes of  Great Britain  must be understood the Goods and Merchandizes which the Subjects of  Great Britain  TRADE IN But it is out of Question That if the taking off the Prohibitions c of the Goods and Merchandizes of  Great Britain  was meant only of the Manufactures then was the whole  Levant Trade  prohibited still which the Gentlemen do not pretend to  Thus it appears that the Construction the Company would have put on▪ the Words of the th  Article  viz Goods and Merchandizes of  Britain  would be the Ruin of that very Trade which they Petition to support and would Prohibit all their  Levant  Goods in  France  Such People like Children must be dealt with by the Nature of things and must have given them not always what they DO ask but what they WOULD ask  Some Considerations might be offered here upon the  Turkey  Companies desiring the Liberty to carry their  Raw Silk  from  England  to  France  and yet at the same time Petition that the Silk Manuf  ctures here should receive Encouragement as if carrying the Silk abroad which is a means to keep up the Price of Silk should at the same time be a means to encourage the Weavers and Manufacturers of  Silk  in this Kingdom This Mystery is referr'd to them to unfold Also the Consistency of their desiring to supply  France  with  Raw Silk  at the same time that they desire the Silk Manufactures of  France  should not be encouraged  In general all the  Memorials Petitions  and  Representations  given in as well from publick Bodies of Men as from private Merchants do allow that if the  Priviledges Advantages Abatements  of  Duties  c which they request or represent as needful▪ may be obtained there will be a great and beneficial Trade driven from  England  to  France  To make it plain then that all those  Priviledges Advantages Abatements  c are really obtain'd by the  Treaty  the Contents of those  Memorials  are here sum'd up▪ the  Memorials  themselves being too long and most of them demanding the same thing with but little Variation  All they Petition for may be reduced to these Heads  Reduction of Duties in  France  upon our Goods especially the Woollen Manufactures to the  Tariff  of    Obtained  with a Reserve only to  Cloths  and  ClothSerges  which is to be debated by Commissioners and at most to pay but as in  Liberty of carrying all our Manufactures into  France  and the taking off all Prohibitions    Obtained  Abolishing the  Sol  per Ton  and the  Droit au bein    Obtained  generally tho' the  Dutch  pay it Coastway as also the  Droit au bein  which was a cruel Custom that gave all the Estates of  English  Merchants who died in  France  to the King  Liberty of Importing  Tobacco  into  France  and of Selling it there free from the Farm    Obtain'd  only as to the Farm  referr'd  Liberty of Importing  Levant Goods  either directly from the  Levant  or from  England    Obtain'd  Liberty of Importing  EastIndia  Goods into  France    Obtain'd    British  Merchants to be free from the  Papier Timbrée  or stamp'd  Paper▪    Obtain'd  and which was not ask'd a Freedom of Religion and Christian Burial things the Petitioners shew'd little Concern about  That Ships may Trade Coastways in  France  without double Demands of Customs  c  Ships may deliver part of the Cargo in  France  and proceed with the rest without paying Duties    Obtain'd  Surrender of  Hudson  's  Bay  and  Straight Newfoundland  and the  Fishery Annapolis  and  Nova Scotia    Obtain'd  together with the Island of St  Christophers  which was not ask'd  Reparation of Damages to Merchants    Obtain'd  the  Quantum  only being  referr'd  It would be reasonable here to desire those People who insist so much upon this Reserve of  Cloths  and  Serges  out of the  Tariff  of to consider what the exception amounts to and how far it may hurt the Trade that they may Judge whether the Damage is equal to the Complaint To this purpose the Difference in the  Serges  is set down again here viz That the  Serges  which paid Livres in and were afterwards brought to and then to and after that prohibited may now be freely Imported into  France  paying only Livres that is to say one Livre advance upon a piece of Ells and the Difference upon  Cloths  is that the Piece which paid Livres before in must pay now being Livres upon about Yards  English  Measure  To make this Estimate more plain it is to be noted that the  Ell  mention'd in all these Cases is to be understood the  French Ell  containing Quarters of the  English  Yard and so the Account of the Exception of  Cloths  and  Cloth Serges  may be read thus  Cloths per piece  containing  Ells  that is  English Yards  and a  Quarter  to pay  Livres  more than by the  Tariff  of  Cloth Serges per piece  containing  Ells  that is  Yards  and  Quarters  to pay  Livre  more than by the  Tariff  of  Considering Men when they come to weigh this will be apt to wonder what it is the Trading part of this Nation have been so much allarm'd at in the Treaty with  France  and will hardly be brought to believe that the Complaints which have been made of ruining our  Manufactures  and encouraging the  French  should all be raised from these small Differences  Would these People turn the  Tables  and make the Case of  France  here the  r own what loud Complaints would they make in  England  if any  Manufactures  which our own People were endeavouring to make at home should have been admitted by the Treaty from  France  with alike small Advance on the  French  Goods more than they paid in Whereas every body is sensible that the  French  are to pay here upon all their Goods or  l per Cent  higher Duties than they paid in and in some Goods much more Had these advanced Duties been taken off how would they alledge that Foreigners were encouraged that the Bread was taken out of the Mouths of our own People that the Importing  Manufactures  from abroad which we could make at Home was taking away the Employment from our own Poor to give to the  French  Yet this is the Case here The  French  have given all the Encouragment they could to their People to fall upon the making the  Woollen Manufactures  of  Great Britain  it is supposed none can blame them for that some steps they have taken in it which promised them Success while the Duties of  Livres  and  Livres  were laid on  English Cloths  and yet even then great Quantities of  English Cloth  were carried into  France  which obliged the King of  France  at last to make a Prohibition of  English Woollon Manufactures  in general viz in the Year  But after all these  Advances  in the  Woollen Manufactures  the  French  King being obliged by the Necessity of his Affa  rs to make a Peace has yielded to such a Peace as opens the Door into  France  for the  Woollen Manufactures  of  Great Britain  at the same Rate of  Custom  and  Duties  as they paid Years ago long before his own People m  de any considerable Attempt that way having excepted or reserved but two species of  Manufactures  and upon them has only advanced about or  per Cent  There is ha  dly a  Manufacture  Erected by us in  Britain  in the memory of Man but that if the high  Duties  laid upon Forreign Goods of the same kind were taken off or within or  per Cent  of what they were before would be ruin'd and the Undertakers thereof must lay them down If the  Manufacturers  of  Paper Linnen Cloth Canvas  or  Sail Cloth  and many other things were heard to this it is believed they would all acknowledge the Truth of it  But the  French  King is obliged by this  Treaty  what Discouragement soever it may be to his own Subjects and their  Manufacture  to take off all his Prohibitions and high Duties and give all the  English Manufactures  a free Entrance into his Country upon the same easy Duties they paid in the Year except two sorts only viz  Cloth  and  Cloth Serges  That this may admit of no  Dispute  the Affirmative leads to the particular sorts of our  Woollen Manufactures  which by this  Treaty  may be carryed into  France  by the Rule of the  Tariff  of  viz  Spanish Cloths Serges  not  ClothSerges Double Bays Single Bays Says Perpetuana's Spanish Draggets  all sorts of  Norwich Stuff  LinseyWoolseys Kiderminster Stuffs Shalloons Chenys Peny  es half Thicks Cottons  plain double and single Dozens  i e Yorkshire Cloths Kersies Duffels Tammies Plaids Blankets Rugs  lannels Worsted Hose Woollen Hose KnitCaps KnitWa  c  ats KnitPetticoats Friezes Camtalogns  and whatever other things are made of  Wool  and wrought in  Great Britain  all are reduced by this  Tariff  to the Duties payable in    What has been said of the Liberty of Commerce obtained by the Treaty with  France  the Reduction of the Duties in  France  to the  Tariff  of and the Reserve or Limitation of two Species of our  Manufactures  only viz of  Broad Cloths  and  Serges  to a small Advance of Duty has been more than sufficient to explain those things to any Mens Understandings which are not politically dull Unless these People expected that her Majesty should have made a Condition with the  French  King that his Subjects should make no  Woollen Cloth  or that when they had made it they should not export it to  Turkey  for fear of prejudicing our  Levant  Trade  If the  French  Merchants in  Turkey  hold their  Cloths  up to equal Price with the  English  no Buyer will take them except when a sufficient Quantity of  English Cloth  cannot be had to supply the Market  The  French Cloths  being inferiour to the  English  in Quality are for that Reason and no other Sold in  Turkey  at a lower Price  It is evident that the  French  want the Materials viz the  Wool  especially in those parts of  France  where their  Cloths  for the  Turkey  Trade are made and whither the  English  or  Irish Wool  which they get by Stealth cannot be carried without very great Expence and that the  Wool  they make use of instead thereof and to mix with the  Spanish Wool  is of an inferiour Quality to the  English Wool  they themselves will not deny But if these were not so and they were to make  Cloth  wholly of  Spanish Wool  or of  English  and  Spanish Wool  mixt yet the general Way of Workmanship of the  French  Nation is known to be slighter and looser in all their  Manufactures  than the  Manufactures  of the like kind made here and that our Workmen perform almost all kinds of Workfirmer and more sub  antial not only than the  French  but also than any other People So that our  Cloths  and even all our  Woollen Manufactures  will Sell for a better Price than  Manufactures  of the same Denomination from other Countries  As to the  Silk Manufactures  they have such a sufficient Provision made for them and such Encouragement given them already by the high Duties on Foreign wrought  Silks  as well of  France  as of any other Country that as they stood in no need of Prohibitions during the War so they stand in need of no farther Assistance during the Peace  For this Reason as they have nothing to ask but that those Duties should remain so the  Treaty of Commerce  has taken none of them away and if the  Silk Manufacture  cannot subsist with that Difference upon them which those Duties have laid neither would they subsist with a Total Prohibition  It is observable that during the said high Duties particularly upon  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  none of them have been Imported here that is legally Imported as for Clandestine Importation or Running of Goods that can be no Argument because neither  can the Quantity be great or is it possible entirely to prevent those things either in this Country or in any other The Difference between the Manufactures of  Silk  at home and those imported stands thus  Foreign wrought  Silks  of all kinds pay for every pound Weight  L Netts Duty  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  pay for every pound Weight  L Nett Duty  Now if the Foreign wrought  Silks  pay above  Shillings per Pound  Weight Duty upon Importation all Discounts taken off the Disadvantage which they must lie under must exceedingly lessen that Importation and seems sufficient not only to encourage but to quicken the Industry of our own  Weavers  But since the Encouragement of the  Silk  Trade and Employment of the  Weavers  is spoken of as a thing of such extraordinary Weight it may be very necessary to state the Case of  Manufacturing  in general that our Opinion of things may be rightly ballanc'd  It is an undoubted Rule of Trade that the Employment of our own Poor and Consumption of our own Growth is the first Principal of  Commerce  and should be the last End of all our National Improvement  As  Great Britain  is stated in Matters of Trade this Concern for the General Interest of that Trade centers upon our  Woollen Manufacture  There is a just Concern due to every Branch of Trade but to that most which most contributes to and is most essential in the two great Ends of Trade abovementioned viz  Employment of the People and Consumption of the Produce  This the  Woollen Manufacture  is so far superior in to all other Branches of our  Commerce  as admits of no Comparison and therefore the principal Concern of the Nation is and ought to be the  Woollen Manufacture  It is true Prudence may so guide as that this Concern for the  Woollen Manufacture  tho' it be with a Preference to all our other Goods yet may not be in Opposition to them there being a manifest Difference between shewing a peculiar Regard to one and injuring the other as a Man having many Children may shew a peculiar Affection to his eldest without injuring the rest But then on the other hand neither must any of the other Branches of Trade claim or expect such a Regard or Concern to be shewn to them as should be injurious to the  Woollen Manufactures  The  Silk  Trade is useful and advantageous but  Silk  is a modern  Manufacture  and is useful and advantageous as it is a Return for and encourages the Exportation of the  Woollen Manufactures  and no otherwise The  Woollen Manufacture  is the Eldest Child of the Nation's  Commerce  The  Silk  Trade is a FosterChild taken into the Family made useful and meriting to be encouraged but always with a Subserviency to the Good of the Heir  If the  Turky  Merchants drive any considerable Trade to  France  with raw  Silk  whether from  England  by ReExportations or from the  Levant  directly the  Silk  they carry it is allowed must be the Product of  English Manufactures  so that by that Method not only our own  Silks  but even the  French Silks  also as to the Materials they are made of are the Product and Return of the  English Woollen Manufactures  The next Difference is the Workmanship which lies thus that one is perform'd by the  French  whom we ought to have no Regard to in Trade the other is perform'd by our own People whom we ought to support  But granting this if on the other hand a Bale of wrought  Silks  should be brought from  France  bought there with a Bale or Bales of  Spanish Cloth  or other  Woollen Goods  it is easy to prove that it is more our Interest to bring over that Bale of wrought  Silk  and that the said wrought  Silks  are more our own  Manufacture  than if they had been wrought in  SpittleFields  because the  Woollen Manufactures  which were first sent to  Turky  to purchase the raw  Silk  which this Bale of  Silks  was wrought from and the  Spanish Cloths  or other  Woollen Goods  sent to  France  to purchase the said  Silks  when wrought not only consumed the Growth of  England  but employed above Sixteen times the Number of People in their making  c  more than the Bale of wrought  Silks  would have done if they had been made in  SpittleFields  On the other hand this implies no Danger at all to the  English Manufactures  of  Silk  because tho' the Humours and Fancies of some expensive People may run them upon buying Foreign wrought  Silks  yet while the high Duties here remain as they are to do by the  Treaty  the Difference of Price will be always such as will lessen the Demand of Foreign  Silks  restrain the Humour aforesaid to a few People and preserve the Bulk of the  Manufacture  in our hands  It is objected by some That the Difference is not sufficient that notwithstanding  l s d  to be paid upon the Importation for every Pound Weight of wrought  Silks  yet that the  French  will bring in their  Silks  But this amounts to no more than this viz That they will bring in some few Which is what as above may be to our Advantage But they will not pretend that the Difference of the said Duty shall not lessen that Importation and reduce it to a small Quantity and that the Gross of the Trade shall remain in our own hands  The Substance of the Petitions of the  Silk Weavers  and of others who pretend to appear in their Behalf is in short this That the Importation of  French  wrought  Silks  may be prevented The Pretence to make their Petitioning national is the Danger they say appears that  French  wrought  Silks  will now by Virtue of  the Treaty of Commerce  be imported in great Quantities into  Britain  and the  French  being able to underwork us will also Undersell us and the Weavers thereby be ruin'd  What Foundation there is to support these Things will appear upon making a few Enquiries into matters of Fact and some just Calculation of the Proportions of one to the other  The Affairs of the high Du  ies upon wrought  Silks  Imported is given in Answer to the  Weavers  and seems to make their Apprehensions appear very irrational Above  s per Pound  Duty on the Importation must be paid upon  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  and above  s per Pound  upon all other wrought  Silks  except  Italian Silks  Imported in  English  Ships which pay Duty  s d  The Force of Reason prevailed in the first and the  Weavers  have given it up owning at the Bar of the  House of Commons  that the Difference is sufficient in the  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  and that the  French  can do them no harm there but it seems they think  s  or  s d per pound  too little upon the other wrought  Silks  But they either did not know or omitted to take notice that the Raw  Silk  which those  French  Goods are made of pays Sixteen  Livres per pound  Duty at the first Importation into  France  that the wrought  Silks  when shipp'd again to be brought hither pay  l per Cent  Custom  ad Valorem  upon their Exportation both by the  Tariff  of and that the other Charges such as Transportation by LandCarriage to the Ports they are shipp'd at Commission for  Buying Fraight Risque  of the  Sea  c cannot be so little as  per Cent  more So that here is about  per Cent  more upon the Value of the Goods to be added to the Difference of  s  or  s d per pound  all which put together makes such a Weight upon the Foreign wrought  Silks  and gives such an Advantage to the  English Weavers  that it is wonderful to think they should complain  To add to the Conviction of these Things it shall be a little examin'd what effect this Difference has already had upon the  Silk  Trade from whence may be Estimated some thing of what may be expected for the time to come  The  Weavers  said Themselves at the Committee of the House of Commons that they make to the Value of Three hundred thousand Pounds every Year in  Black Silks  only whether it be Truth or not is not easy to be examined But in this Case if they allow it we are not to question it for if it be an Error it is against themselves their  Quantity of other  Silks  they spake of as prodigiously great It cannot be amiss to observe then what Quantity of Foreign wrought  Silks  have been imported here from all parts of  Europe  under our high  Duties  and see what Proportion they bear to the Quantity which these People say they make at Home whether these Foreign wrought  Silks  have been  French  or no is not the Case The  Duties  are near the same and as they are Imported from Countries to which  France  had an open Trade it is not improbable many  French Silks  have been among them and if more has not come in the Difference made by the  Duties  have been the apparent and only Reason and the same Reason must hold good still as long as the same  Duties  remain  An Account of the Quantities of wrought Silks Imported Annually from all Parts of Europe distingushing the Countries viz  The several Countries and Species  From  Christmas  To  Christmas    To  Christmas    To  Christmas    Total of the Three years     L  L  L  L  GermanyDutch  wrought            Italian  wrought      ½  ½  HollandDutch  wrought      ¾  ¾  Italian  wrought  ½  ¾  ½  ¾  ItalyItalian  wrought    ½  ¼  ¾  SpainSpanish  wrought           Italian  wrought        ½  ½  StreightsItalian  wrought      ½  ½  TurkyTurky  wrought      ½  ½  VeniceItalian  wrought            Total of the Three Years           ¼  All that can be alledged against this is to beg the  Question  and say  That There will be more Imported now  but before that can be allowed they should shew a good Reason why more was not Imported in these Years abovestated being the Quantity from  Italy  was always much greater before the raising the  Duties  here and that Reason which is good for preventing the Importation from  Italy  will be good for preventing it from any other Country  What has been said against the Reason of this is so little to the Purpose and with such little Force that it is worth no Notice the Facts are so clearly made out that they amount even to Demonstration The high Duties have effectually check'd the importation of wrought  Silks  and will do so still If the  French  had their  raw Silks  cheaper than we have it how comes it to pass that so much weight has been put upon the  Levant  Company's obtaining a Liberty of Exporting  Raw Silk  from  England  to  France  which is obtain'd for them by the  Treaty  and which the Company are now fully satisfied is settled to their advantages If the  French  had  raw Silks  cheaper than the  English  it would be absur'd to spake of our sending  raw Silks  from  England  to  France  Goods  are shipped from Port to Port to mend their Market not to lessen their Value if our Merchants did not advance the Price they would never send their Goods abroad  Not only the  French  have not their raw  Silk  Cheaper than  England  but on the contrary  England  has their  raw Silks  cheaper than all the World those Countries excepted who have it of their own and this will appear by the great Quantity of  raw Silk  Exported from  England  to other Countries as also of  Mohair Yarn  which is equally concern'd in the  Argument  and the following  Abstract  of One Year may give a specimen  An Account of Raw Silk and MohairYarn Exported into Foreign Parts from Christmas to Christmas Viz  Raw Silk  MohairYarn  Pounds weight  Pounds weight      It would be an unaccountable Trade if it should be true that other Nations had  Raw Silk  cheaper than we have it when at the same time they should buy such Quantities of it every Year from us  If any Nation in the World can have  Raw Silk  cheaper than  England Italy  may be thought to be the Place because they have great Quantities  Sicily  included of  Silks  of their own Growth It will be hard to assign a Reason why  Italy  who have  Silk  of their own and with whom our Trade has been always open should by our high Duties be obstructed from sending their wrought  Silks  to  England  and  France  who buy great Quantities of  Silk  from us should not  As the like Arts have been made use of to possess the People with an Opinion that the Interest of  Britain  has been neglected with respect to the  Portugal  Trade which were before employ'd in that of the  French  so it will easily be made appear it has been done with the like Weakness and 'tis hop'd it shall be with the like Success  It is alledged That the Treaty with  France  and the  Treaty  formerly made with  Portugal  and no  subsisting are inconsistent with one another That the Effect of the  Treaty  with  France  will be the  ess  ing the Importation of  Portugal Wines  by Lowering the Duties on the  French  that this will lessen the Consumption of our  Woollen Manufactures  in  Portugal  that our Trade there will be en  irely lost by a Prohibition of all our  Woollen Manufactures  in  Portugal  as it was before the War  And the like  It is needful to go back and look into the former State of the  Portugal  Trade before the late  Treaty  and enquire into the Nature and Reason of the Alterations Additions and Encreases which have been Accidents to that Trade and which have brought it from what it was to what it now is in which if the Causes assign'd for it's Encrease are mistaken the Notions we entertain of such and such things endangering its Decrease will appear equ  ly groundless  Two general and Vulgar Errors or Mistakes are entertained among us relating to the first part of the  Portugal  Trade viz what it was before the  Treaty  with  Portugal  and two more relating to what it now is or will be by reason of the  Peace  The Mistakes about what it was are That the  Portuguese  had prohibited all our  Woolllen Manufactures  That the Encrease of our Trade or Export to  Portugal  was occasioned by and depended upon the Encrease of our Demand for Their Wines Our Mistakes about what the  Portugal  Trade is now or is like to be are That upon our reducing the Duties of  French Wine  by the  Treaty of Commerce  with  France  to an Equality with the  Portuguese Wines  the  Wine  Trade from  Portugal  will be ruined and we shall import no more  That upon this the  Portuguese  will immediately prohibit our  Woollen Manufactures  and so that great Trade which it is alledged tho' falsly too Exports two Millions Yearly in the  Growth  and  Manufacture  of  GreatBritain  will be lost  If every one of these may be clearly proved to be Mistakes and that neither the things suggested or the Consequences drawn from them can be supported by Truth or Reason then all our Uneasiness about this  Portugal  Trade will appear causeless and ill grounded To do this there needs no more than to state Matters of Fact and give such Proofs of every thing as the Case will admit  That all our  Woolen Manufactures  were Prohibited before the War is a Mistake and truly this is a Mistake of such a Nature so obvious and so easy to be confuted that it is wonderful it should be expected by any body to do their Arguments any Service It is well known upon the Exchange and no  Portugal  Merchants of any long standing can be ignorant that the Prohibition was ONLY of our  Medley Cloths  which were forbidden not only to be imported there but to be worn the Reasons whereof also were assigned viz Not that they set about the making them there as some alledged but because they found their People forward to run into the  French  way of Clothing and Dressing themselves which the Court for many Reasons thought fit to prevent But no Man who has any competent Knowledge of the  Portugal  Trade will pretend that the  Bays Says Perpets Serges Stuffs Stockings Cotions Plains Kerseys  c which were always the Gross of the  English  Exportations to  Portugal  were ever under any Prohibition there or any other of our  Woollen Manufactures  the  Woollen Cloths  as above only excepted  That what is said here may as  it is Resolved all things in this Paper shall  carry it's Evidence along with it the Words of the late Treaty with  Portugal  may be produced for Proof In the Second Articles after the Proportion between the Customs of  Portuguese  Wines and the Custom of  French  Wines is settled follow these Words  Butt if this Abatements of Customs as is presumed to be made shall be after any manner prejudiced or Abolished shall be just and lawful for his Sacred Royal Majesty of  Portugal  again to forbid the  WOOLLEN CLOTHS  From he  ce may be noted also that  this part  of the Agreement was not so absolutely and  laid down as an Essential of the Treaty between  England  and  Portugal  without which the Peace of the two Nations could not subsist but Provision was expresly made in the very Article that if it should be ABOLISHED yet the Peace should r  main entire only the King of  Portugal  would then be at Liberty if he thought  make himself Amend  upon  England  by prohibiting the  English  WOOLLEN CLOTHS  The next vulgar Error or Mistake which we are led into about the  Portugal  Trade is that the Encrease of our Exports of the  Woollen Manufactures  of  Great Britain  to  Portugal  is occasion'd by and depends upon the Encrease of our Demand for their Wines This however absurd and in its Nature contrary to the Truth of Fact is the thing on which the Argument is made to turn from which they would infer that as our Demand for  Portugal  Wine decreased so will their Demand for our  Manufactures  decline And in short that if by the coming in of  French  Wines the  Portugal  Wine shall be wholly left off as they vainly suggest so will also the Demand for our  Woollen Manufactures  in  Portugal  cease and that Trade be lost  The People who argue thus confute themselves in their own Calculations For First to magnify the  Portugal  Trade they tell us that we export thither Annually the Value of Two Millions  Sterling  most of it in the  Woollen Manufactures  of  Great Britain  against this give them leave to make their own Estimates of the  Wine  we Import from thence and take the largest Year and the highest Price they can reasonably suppose the Quantity will not amount to above or  Ton  which Account there  will in the pursuit of this Article appear Reason to make great Abatement of too but were it so and account the Wines prime Cost one with another at  l per Ton  or  to please them  at  l per Ton  which is much above the true Cost in in  Portugal  they will not amount to  l  which by their own Account is less than one Tenth part of the Demand for our  Manufactures  This will very ill make it out that their Demand for our  Manufactures  is occasion'd by and depends upon our Demand for their Wines by which they must make it appear that the Nine parts of the Trade depend upon the Tenth and the greater is occasioned by the less which is an Absurdity in the very Nature of the thing  But the matter of Fact is evident and known to all that have any tolerable Knowledge of the  Portugal  Trade viz That the Encrease of the Trade to  Portugal  has been occasion'd by the Discovery within these few Years of the Gold Mines of St  Paul  in the  Brazils  by which an immense Treasure is gain'd yearly to the  Portugueze  Nation as well as to their King that by th  s means the People in  Brazil  are so increas'd in Wea  th and the Trade to  Brazil  are so increased as a Consequence that the  leets which about twelve Years ago were usually Twentythree to TwentyEight Sail of Ships from  Lisbon  to  Brazil  are now Seventy Eighty to a hundred Sail and the Exports of  English  Goods to  Portugal  are increased in Proportion  This is the true and the only Reason of the Encrease of their Demand for  English Manufactures  and th  s has no more Dependance upon or is occasion'd by our Demand for their  Wines  than it depends upon any thing that has no Relation at all to it  It is very strange to find the Opposers of any Argument lay the whole Stress and Weight of what they have to say upon any thing which they are not very sure they can support the Truth of But it is perfectly surprizing to see Men value themselves and their Cause upon Accounts and Calculations which are fraudulent and erroneous known by Themselves to be so and which they might be sure in an Age like this when Men take nothing upon Trust would by inquiring Heads be soon detected and exposed  Nothing of this kind can be more wonderful than what we see practised just now by some People in handing about a Paper call'd  A SCHEME of the Trade between  England  and  France in order to make the Trade between  England  and  France  look with an Aspect to please them and to answer all the  Romantick  things they have said of it which Paper or SCHEME was Printed in and said to be Sign'd by several eminent Merchants of the City of  London  Something might be said to the Design of that Paper when it was first published and to the Persons who Sign'd it viz  That it was Calculated for a Design then on foot to expose the Publick Management and divide the People against the Court  It may be proper than for the detecting the Fraud of this  Scheme  to enter into an Examination of some of the Particulars wherein it differs from the true Account of that Year which shall be done by giving a brief  Abstract  of the said  Scheme  and likewise of the true Account from the  Custom House  as it is now laid before the Honourable House of Commons by the Commissioners  By both which it will appear that the Design of this Paper call'd A  SCHEME  was then and the making it publick is now to lessen in the publick Opinion the Value of our Exp  rtations to  France  and to encrease or heighten the Value of our Importations from  France  a Design in it self dishonest but much more so from the manner of doing it as will appear by what follows  Our Exportat  ons to  France  from  Michaelmas  to  Michaelmas  are made by the Scheme to amount to l and all the species of Goods are restrated to these few viz  Woollen Cloths Dozens Kerseys Rashes Pennystones Cott  ns Flannels Hose Bays Stuffs Serges  and  Perpets  with some  Petties  which are Crowded together at the Value of  l  Two  Observations  shall contain what is sufficient to say to this part of it and nothing can be desired to expose it more  That here is not half of the species of Goods named which are every Year Exported to  France  and which as appears by the  Customhouse  Books were actually Exported to  France  that Year  That of the species of Goods which they have named they have not set down the true quantities which were really Exported to  France  that very Year  These are such Tokens of a design'd  Collusion  and  Prevarication  that nothing of that kind can be more corrupt  But to descend to a few  Particulars  of this  Fraud  that the People may see in how gross a manner they are Imposed upon  Take a few of the Articles mention'd by the  SCHEME  of Goods Exported to  France  as aforesaid and when Compared with the real Entries of that Year in the  CustomHouse  Books from the Port of  London  according to the Account given in by the Commissioners and now lying before the House of Commons  And any one upon Casting up the following  Particulars  will see to what a Magnitude this Part will amount  The Difference stands thus  Exported as by the Scheme  Really Exported as by the  CustomHouse  Books  Spanish Cloths      Long Cloths      Short Cloths      Northern Dozens Double      Di  to  single      Devon Dozens and Cloth Rashes      Pennystones      Kersies      Norwich Stuffs      Serges and Perpets      Add to this That to lessen the Appearance of our Trade to  France  they have wholly omitted all the  Fish  such as  Herrings Pilchards Salmon  and  White Fish  all our  Plantation Goods  and all the Goods of other Countries Re  exported by us to  France  of which the Quantities Exported that very Year were very great and are so every Year The  Particulars  are too long to set down here but may be guess'd at by these few  Cotten Wool and Yarn    l  Goats Hair or Wooll    Indico    Sugar Brown    Pepper    Tobacco    Callicoes  Pieces  Oyl  Ton  Drugs    l  Besides prodigious Quantities of other Goods Exported to  France  that Year as may be seen by the said account from the  CustomHouse  now lying before the House of Commons  The remaining  Particulars  are so many as makes it plain that the Value of our Exportations to  France  for that Year exceeded the Value of our Importations from  France  very considerably as by the  CustomHouse  Books will appear  The Errors in the Account of the Importations are no less unfairly Stated than these and the Fraud is extended to a much greater Value Nay even the manner of Stating it discovers a design of Imposing upon the Publick For First the Export is confine  to the Port of  London  only with an allowance of one Third more for the out Ports whereas the Import is said to be for the whole Kingdom let them take it which way they Please  If their Imports are for the Ports of  London  only then they have committed a Fraud in the Quantities to the Value of above Pounds as will be prov'd by the  CustomHouse  Books  If their Imports take in the whole Kingdom then they have committed two Frauds instead of one In the Quantities And In offering to state the Debtor side of the Account upon the Port of  London  with a Guess at one Third more of the OutPorts AGAINST all that they say was Imported in the whole Kingdom  If they had design'd a fair and just Account They ought to have stated the Exports and Imports exactly for the Port of  London  and have made the Addition of one Third for the out Ports equal to both sides and have stated both sides upon the Imports and Exports of the whole Kingdom For if the Exports exceed the Imports for the Port of  London  only as appears by the  CustomHouse  Books It would have been much more so for the OutPorts because many of our OutPorts which lye in or near those Countries where the  Woollen Manufactures  are made  Fish  cured  c  Export much greater Quantities to  France  than they could consume the Value of in  French  Goods as  Exeter Colchester Yarmouth  and many other Ports  But the Prevarications are yet more gross and the Value greater As one part makes the Exportations to  France  seem less so the other as dexterously makes the Importations from  France  seem more Nor will their making a Guess or Wholsale Allowance of one Third for the OutPorts on one side answer for it unless they had either made the same allowance serve on both sides or extended the Account to the same period of Time on both sides without it but acting fairly did not seem to suit the Design  Those who would support the Paper call'd  A Scheme  produce a Paper said to be Signed by the Farmers of the Customs containing an Account of the Importations of  Wines Brandies  and  Linnen  from  France  from  Michaelmas  to  Michaelmas  which they make to be very large and from whence they would argue that one half thereof must be the Rule of the Year Had this been a meer Guess or had it been at any other time the Calculation might have been less suspected But there lies so just an Exception against the Year and it was so well known to them that it cannot be any thing but a meer Design  It is well known the Plague had in the Year put an universal stop to all Trade except such as Necessity forc'd the People to for meer Provisions The next Year the Fire of  London  happen'd and as the Fire began near the water side and among the Warehouses and Cellars of the Merchants the Quantities of  Wines  as well as of other Goods which were spoil'd or destroy'd were very great Add to this a War with  France  and  Holland  by which the Trade with both was stop'd and which War was not ended till the Treaty at  Breda  in  July    These Things might well suppose  England  to be so Exhausted of  French  Goods as that the Importation of the next Year viz must be prodigious great and no rational Judgment can be made of the Trade to or from  France  by the Accounts of that Year This is farther demonstrated by the Article of the  Brandies  which the Account  of the Farmers aforesaid makes for the said Two Years to be but  Ton  But by an Account of the same Farmers for the last Five Quarters of the said two Years viz from  Michaelmas  to  Michaelmas  the whole Quantity of Brandy Imported amounts to no more than  Ton  and yet the  SCHEME  affirms there was  Ton  of  Brandy  Imported from  Michaelmas  to  Michaelmas  And this is offer'd as one undeniable Evidence of the Fraud of that  SCHEME  There may be a parallel Case found out to illustrate this and that is of the Exportation of  Lead  from  England  to  France  in the Year which amounts to as by the  CustomHouse  Books a most prodigious and unusual Quantity viz From  Michaelmas  to  Michaelmas  there was Exported from  England  to  France  Fodder of  Lead  which at  l per Fodder  as the  Scheme  allows the Price to be amounts to  l  It would be acknowledged very unfair that this should be given in as an Article of our usual Export of Lead to  France  for as an extraordinary Year is no just Rule to take a Medium of Calculation from so no more is the Year to be taken as a proper time to Calculate our Importation of  Wine  from  France  the preceding Accidents of a Plague the Fire and the War joining together to make the Demand for Wines that Year extraordinary great  Perhaps it is a Fate upon us that the Inconveniencies and IllConsequences of rejecting a Trade so evidently Beneficial to  England  must be discovered by our Experience and must be felt before they will be known in which Case this Paper will have Occasion not only to mention those Inconveniencies before hand but to remind you of them when they happen  This Paper shall also in its Course be adapted to the several Trading Counties and Towns of  Great Britain  to make appear that now the War is ended all the Goods and Commodities of  France  may be Imported into this Kingdom especially such as are to be Reexported as  Brandies Linens Silks Paper Laces  c Since upon such Reexportation all the additional Duties are drawn back when at the same time not one Yard of the  Woollen Manufacture  of  Great Britain  which are all prohibited in  France  nor of our  Fish  and other material Commodities can be Imported into  France  the Articles not being made effectual  The Instances of this shall be hereafter especially applyed to the particular Trading places of  Great Britain  who will thereby be able to judge whether this is not the true State of their Case and whether the  Dutch  or  Flemings  will now have the Importation of our  Manufactures  into  France  as they have had for above Years last past and reserve to themselves the  Dressing Dying  and  Finishing  of those Goods whereby the  Manufacturers  of  Great Britain  will become Slaves to Foreigners who will either set their own Price upon our  Manufactures  or set up Fabricks of their own in Imitation of them all which might have been avoided by having an open and direct Trade with  France  This Paper shall not suggest so much Unhappiness to  Great Britain  whose general Good it is design'd to promote as to propose that the Articles of  Commerce  shall not in time to come be farther consider'd The Parliament of  Britain  who are the true Judges of their Countries Good cannot be supposed to omit any thing that shall be apparently for the publick Advantage and therefore when it shall appear to them which we will not question that these Articles are proper to be Reconsider'd they will no doubt act therein as Reason and Justice requires  In the mean time seeing we are to carry on our Trade without the Advantages which were expected from the  Treaty  let us enquire upon what Terms we are to carry it on and how we shall Trade with  France  for the time coming  The  Tariff  of is now no more to be mentioned in this Affair The low Duties which our Goods would have paid in  France  are out of the Question The Edict of must now be the Rule of our Trade in  France  And that this may be understood  without any Difficulty and be as little subject to Mistakes as possible the Edict it self may be its own Exposi  or of which the following is a faithful Abstract  An Arrest of the King'sCouncil of State containing a Rule for the Importation of Goods and Merchandizes of the Manufactures of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  and the Dominions thereunto belonging  September  th  HIS Majesty continuing his  Application  for the  Profit  and  Advantage  of his Subjects in

DrinkingGlass Decanters  and all other sorts of  Glass Wares  p C Wt      This is a strict View of the present State of the  English Commerce  in  France  and these are but part of the Burthens and Incumbrances of our Trade there which her Majesty by the  Treaty of Commerce  with  France  and in her just Concern for the good of her Kingdoms had procured to have her Subjects delivered from But the Articles being not made Effectual they are now to continue so that our Trade is to remain in general prohibited there till some Act shall be passed here to render Effectual the Provisions made for a Freedom of  Commerce  and till Two Months after all which time the Profits of an advantageous Trade are lost to this Nation  It is also to be observed that while all these high Duties and Prohibitions remain upon our Trade into  France  most of the  French  Goods are still at Liberty to be Imported here paying the high Duties the Case of which will be that for all of those which may be Reexported whither to our Plantations the  Spanish WestIndies  or other Parts those high Duties will be all drawn back and the  French  Goods be so far prejudicial to our  Manufactures  without our having any Share of the Advantage from the Trade to  France  In like manner the  Wines  and  Brandies  which may be used at Sea or in Foreign Parts will draw back all the high Duties and for the other part viz the Home Consumption they will be brought in as  Spanish  and  Portugal Wines  and  Brandies  or else smuggled upon the Coast The  Silks Linnen Paper  c will come in as  Dutch  and  Flemmish  by which means the  French  will have the Benefit of the Peace as to their Part of the Trade and  Britain  will be entirely shut out or be subservient to Foreigners who shall carry it on for their own Benefit as they have done for Years last past  There have been divers Representations made to the King of  France  himself by his own Subjects as well  Merchants  and  Manufacturers  as others all against the  Treaty of Commerce  with  Great Britain  and especially against the Eighth and Ninth Articles the same which our People are offended with Complaining and with great Earnestness too against admitting the  English Woollen Manufactures  into  France  upon the low Duties of as what will be ruinous to the  Manufactures  set up with so great Success in  France  For that the  English  will now bring in all their  Woollen Manufactures  upon them in such great Quantities that those made in  Languedoc  in  Porton  in  Picardy  and other Places will be Ruined That the  English  make those Goods so much better than they can be made in  France  and they will be so Cheap the high Duties which his Majesty had laid on not so much to enrich his Treasury as to encourage the Industry of his own Subjects being taken off even as far back as the  Tariff  of that the  French  Goods will find no Sale but that the  English  Goods will in proportion to their Goodness be sold much cheaper than any can be made in  France  Farther these Representations go on in very pressing tho' humble Terms it being spoken to their King to Complain that an open Trade with  England  will always be to the great Damage and Loss of the  French  for say they the  French  Nation has very few Goods to send to the  English  but whereof other Nations have the like kinds and do also Import the same into  England  But the  English  have divers Goods to send to  France  of which no other Nation can send the like That is to say  Lead Tin Leather Allum Coal Pilchards Salmon  and several other kinds whereas the  Wines  of  France  are supplied to the  English  by  Portugal  the  Brandy  by  Spain  the  Wrought Silks  by  Genoa  and the  Dutchy  of  Milan  the  Fruits  and  Perfumes  by  Italy  and the  Linen  and  Paper  by  Hamburgh  and  Holland  For these Reasons they repres  nt that the  Treaty of Commerce  with  Great Britain  as it is now fixed would be Dist  uctive and an entire Ruin to the Trade of the  French  Nation concluding that  France  can never recover it's Wealth and Greatness if such a  Treaty of Commerce  should be permitted to take place and unless some way be found out to continue the high Duties and thereby to keep out the  English Manufactures  from being permitted to come into  France  These  Representations  seem to rally the  English  for what they call a Stupidity incredible that they prohibit Trading with  France  at the begining of the first War  By which  say they  the Manufactures of  France  have arrived to a great Height which it was impossible should have been if the  English Woollen Manufactures  had continu'd to have been sent into  France and insinuate that  it should have been the Most Christian King not the late King  William  who should have caused a  Prohibition  of Trade to have been publish'd for that the  English  Trade was the only Destructive thing to the Industry of the  French  Nation  These  Arguments  are so pungent and carry with them so much Weight that it makes a most pointed  Satyre  upon the  French  King that he should not comply with their Desires but it must be acknowledged that if their Reasons are just on the  French  side it will be hard to find that our Complaints of this Trade can be reasonable on the other side for it is hardly Rational to suggest that the Trade between these Two Nations can be to the Disadvantage and Loss on both sides  Many Delusions have been spread about to amuse and deceive the People in this Matter of the  Treaty of Commerce  with  France  some of which have been Detected and duly Exposed and many who have been Deceived by them begin to recover their Judgments and to find that the  Treaty  which they have been prevail'd upon to Reject and Contemn is really a Foundation of the most advantageous Commerce that  Britain  can be engaged in That the  French  must Trade with us under the most disadvantageous Conditions imaginable That our Export will be easy to us their Imports here hard and Loaden with Burthens to them and we begin to see these People now repent the Opposition they have all along made to their Countries Good and would undo what others have done if it was in their Power to do so  But there are still Mistakes behind which must be removed and Objections which however they may be illgrounded yet require some Notice of them as especially this viz That there are but three Ports in  France  at which our  Manufactures  are admitted to be Imported viz St  Vallery  on the  Soame Roan  and  Bourdaux  It is wonderful to reflect how much this prevails in the Minds of the People considering it is evident that the limiting the Ports for Entry concern only the two Species viz the  Cloths  and  ClothSerges  which is plain by the Specifications of the  Treaty  and not all the rest of our  Woollen Manufactures  But as to all our other  Woollen Manufactures Bays Says Serges Perpets Stuffs Druggets Dozens Kersies Stockings  c All our Reexported Goods such as  Cottons Indicoes Sugars EastIndia  and  Turky  Goods and all other they are f  eely allow'd by the  Treaty  to be Imported into all the Ports of  France  and before this  Treaty  the said two species of  Manufactures  were confined to but Two Ports viz  Calais  and St  Vallery  on the same  It has been said that the Reason why the  French  Confined our said  Woollen Manufactures  to certain Ports for their Importations was that the Land Carriage and Local Duties of the said Goods should rise so h  gh upon them that the Price should thereby be made too great for the Buyer and give the advantage to their own  Manufactures  Let such People but look Back upon their Own  Arguments  they are not only false in themselves but inconsistent with one another for if this were true then it must be true also that their own  Manufactures  stood in need of those Helps that their own  Manufactures  were so Inferiour to the  Eng  ish  that if the utmost Discouragements were not put upon the  English  Goods the  French Manufactures  would not be told that the  English Manufactures  so excelled the  French  in the real intrinsick Value that if these were admitted tho' upon the hardest Terms to be Imported into  France  yet they would gain Ground there and to be brief would Sell before the  French  albeit the Difference made by the Burthen of Duties there was at that time above  per Cent  and these things they will not allow having on many Occasions published that the  French Manufactures  are as good as Ours and if permitted to come into  England  would ruin our own  But on the other hand this suggestion cannot in general be True for had it been so that the limiting the Importation of the  Woollen Manufactures  of  Britain  to a few certain Ports was contriv'd to Load the said Goods with the farther Burthens of Landcarriage  c  Why then should the Ports they were limited to be chosen out upon the greatest Navigable Rivers in  France  nearest to the Place where the Centre of their Trade lay and where the chief Consumption of our  Manufactures  was to be expected For Example  Roan  and  Bourdeaux  The City of  Roven  lies on the River  Sein  and is to  Paris  as  Gravesend  is to  London  From thence the Navigation of the  Sein  conveys every thing by Water upon Five great Rivers viz by the  Oyse  and the  Aisne  into the Isle of  France  and the lower  Champain  to the City of  Rhiemes  the  Rhetelois  and the Edge of the Dutchy of  Bar  by the River  Maza  through the whole Province of  Champain  by the  Yonne  into  Burgundy  and  Nivernois  and by the River  Loyng  and the  Canal de Briare  into the great River  Loyre  to the Cities of  Orleans Nevers Blais Tours Angers  c even down to the  Occean  and through the very Heart of  France  Again the City of  Bourdeaux  is the Centre of the  English Commerce  in  France  and where the greatest Number of our Ships resort for the  Wine  and  Brandies  which are brought from thence Therefore appointing  Bourdeaux  as one of the Ports for the Import of our  Manufactures  was rather making the Trade easy than difficult to the  English  and so far from a design of making our Goods dear and encreasing the Charges upon them that it was rather giving Ease to it by opening that only Port to which the  English  could bring them upon the easiest Terms of  Fraight  and where the greatest Demand for those Goods was to be found where the principal Consumption of them might be excepted and where the greatest Convenience of  Ireland  Navigation was to be had in order to convey the said  Manufactures  to all Parts of the Kingdom of  France  For the City of  Bourdeaux  stands on the  Garonne  from whence they have a Navigation by other Rivers viz the  Dordonne  quite through  Perigott  and  Limosin  into  Auvergne  by the River  Lot  through  Quercy  and  Rovergne  even to the  Sevennes  and by the Royal Canal from the City of  Thoulouse  on the  Garonne  quite through the Province of  Languedoc  to  Narbonne  and into the mediterranean Sea supplying the whole Provinces of  Gascoign Guienne  and  Languedock  with  British Manufactures  by Water Carriage  This rather seems to intimate to us that the  French  King finding it convenient on other Accounts to limit the Importation of these Goods to certain Ports yet appointed those Ports so as that his Subjects might have the Goods brought with the greatest Ease and the least Charge that could be to those Markets where the greatest Consumption of them was and where the Principal Traders in those Goods were settled who from thence supplyed the whole Kingdom by the Convenience of WaterCarriage As to the Reason of naming particular Ports and Places for the Importation of these Goods it is known to those who are acquainted with the Affairs of  France That it was occasioned by the differing Circumstances of the Contracts with the Farmers  and was a thing practised in other Cases in  France  as well as in this of the  Woollen Manufactures  as particularly the  Drugs  and  Spices  which are limited in almost the same manner  Also this limiting the Importation of Goods to certain Ports is not a new Practice or peculiar to  France  only the like is done in  England  particularly the  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  are confined to the Port of  London  and the Importation of  Wooll  from  Ireland  is limited to Three or Four Ports only but however is so ordered not that the  Irish Wooll  should by Reason of LandCarriage be made dearer to our  Manufactures  than the  English  in order to discourage the Importation of it But for other particular Reasons drawn from the Circumstances of the thing it self and therefore the Towns to which the Importations of  Irish Wooll  is limited are such as are not only nearest and most convenient by their Situation for the coming from  Ireland  but nearest and most convenient to those parts of  England  where the  Manufacturers  live who make use of  Irish Wooll  and are the principal Buyers and Consumers thereof as  Mi  e  ead  for the  SergeMakers  of  Ta  ton  are  Biddiford  or  Ba  stable  for the  SergeMakers  of  Exeter Tiverton  c at  L  verpool  for the  Clothiers  of  Yorkshire  and  Lancashire  And the like  Had not the Convenience of the  Manufacturers  been consulted in this Limitation but on the contrary had it been contrived or appointed on purpose to add the Burthen and Expence of LandCarriage to the Price of the  Wooll Bristoll  might have been named  MilfordHa  e    or any Port in  Wales  which tho' lying as wel  for the  Navigation  of the  Irish  Vessels would yet have greatly encreased the Price of the  Wooll  to the  Manufacturers  by the Charges of carrying it on Horseback after it was landed in like manner had the King of  France  limited the Importation of the  English▪ Manufactures  with Design as it is alledged to Enhance the Price by LandCarriage he would have chosen such Ports for their Importation as were most remote from those Parts where the principal Consumptions of them was known to be and most remote from the Conveniences of WaterCarriage This was very easy for him to have done had he  amed the Cities of  Rochell  and St  Mall  for Example instead of  Roan  and  Bourdeaux  the Case had been qui  e altered there being no River Navigable near them and then it would have been difficult to have assigned any other Reason for such Limitation than that of Discouraging and Burthening the Trade But as it is now there is no room for any Supposition of that kind  Further it might be demanded why the  French  King should not rather lay still higher D  ties on the said  Woollen Manufactures  than study to raise their Price by the Difficulties of their Importation the former being the readiest Method of Discour  ging their Market and which would at the same time have brought in some Gain to the Crown which is an Article they are far from being forgetful of in  France  Much has been said in Discoursing on this Subject about the Ballance of the  French  Trade being against  England  That the Ballance formerly against  England  has been Disputed and that with good Reason the contrary in many Particulars evidently appearing But that the Ballance will be against  England  NOW is too evident for it is impossible to be otherwise the Nature of the Trade will not permit it to be otherwise The  French  will bring in great Quantities of their Goods here of which some will always be consumed at home what Price soever they cost and all that we want for ReExportation whether to our own Colonies or other Parts will go abroad drawing back the high Duties which as it is alledged are to hinder our Trading in them So that still all our Foreign  Commerce  so far as these Kind of  Goods  are Demanded will be  French  Against this it is demanded how must Payment be made  all our Trade to  France  is in some Respect prohibited as has been shewn by the Edict of published MERCATOR No and what is not prohibited is loaded with such high Duties as are almost equal to a Prohibition We have been told that we pay for all the Goods we buy in  France  with ready Money whether we did or no BEFORE may be debated another time but it is evident that we shall buy NOW the Articles not being made Effectual must be paid for with Money or not paid for at all for the  French  will take nothing of us So that they having formerly shut the Door of  Commerce  against  England  we have bolted it now on the wrong side and will not suffer them to open it again altho' they are willing to do it  If the Ballance of Trade by this means runs against  Britain  which before always ran against  France  we cannot blame them but must blame our selves who have been willing to have it so and have so blamed our PartyInterest with our TradingInterest as to ruin the one in order to carry on the other  The Objection upon which all this Matter seem'd to turn has been that the  French  have NOW all kinds of  Woollen Manufactures  of their own making and have no need of our Trade this is carryed such a Length by some that they insist that the  French  make all the sorts of our  Woollen Manufactures  as good as the  English  and much cheaper than they can be made here that they are able not only to supply themselves but other Countries nay all Countries says one Author and  Britain  too says another Author But it would be ask'd of these warm People  Why then do they so strictly and carefully Exclude Prohibit or Load with Duties all the  English Woollen Manufactures If their own are better and cheaper than the  English  their Quality would be a Prohibition as effectual as an Edict or  Arrest du Conseil  and much more and other Prohibitions would be needless  But whatever we are pleased to say the  French  know better and as they have good Reason to be most sensible of the Defects of their own  Manufactures  so they are very careful to keep the  English  Goods out that the Goodness of one against the Meanness of the other may not be discovered by the Trade it self Nothing can be a more undeniable Proof of the Mistake of those People who talk so warmly of the Goodness and Cheapness of the  French Manufactures  than the  French  King laying such repeated Burthens upon the  English  Goods and after this was done and several times encreased yet when the  Manufacturers  there found that notwithstanding their high Duties and Burthens the  English  Goods would be bought by their People whatever they cost being recommended so effectually by their own Worth and Goodness that all the  French  could do in the meer way of Trade would be of no Signification to it They Petitioned the  French  King to grant a Total Prohibition of  Woollen Manufactures  which he did And this was all done during a Time of Peace so that the War is not the Reason of this Case but the meer Nature of the Trade and it is easy to be discovered that it had been to small Purpose to go about making  Woollen Manufactures  in  France  if the  English Woollen Manufactures  were not effectually Prohibited  Her Majesty on the other hand has so effectually secur'd to her Subjects all the Advantages of the  French  Trade that she has not only obtain'd the Revocation of all that the King of  France  had been doing for Years for the Encouragement of his Subjects in the  Woollen Manufactures  by which she gives her own People a full Opportunity to extend their Trade into all parts of  France  with Advantage but on the contrary has continued upon the  French  Importations hither all those Inequalities and extraordinary Duties which were needful to exclude them from any prejudicial Excesses in  England  to the Disadvantage of her own People By both which the Ballance of that Trade is effectually secured to be on the  English  side and we are in a fair way to recover all the Injury done to our  Commerce  by the last impungent Prohibitions  Would these People turn the Tables and make this Case their own what may we suppose they would say if the Queen of  Great Britain  had in Her Majesty's  Treaty of Commerce  Consented to take off the high Duties laid on the Importation of those  French Manufactures  which our People have been Encouraged by those high Duties to make here and given Permission by this  New Treaty  to the  French  to Import the said Goods upon the low Duties which the same Goods paid here before the Year  For Example  Should the Duties on  French Alamodes  and  Lustrings  have been reduced to  s per l  which they paid before the War instead of s d which they are to pay now should the Duties on  French Brandy  which by this  Treaty  is to remain at above l  per  Ton have been reduced to s as it was before the  Revolution  May we not suppose the Distiller of  Corn  and  Mollasses  the Weavers of  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  and the Dealers under them all would have made  Representations  and  Complaints  of their Trade being ruin'd and given up to the  French  their Families Impoverish'd  c  like as we find the  French  Merchants and  Manufactures  in  France  have done on their side to their King and for which we must acknowledge they have very good Reason  It is scarcely worth while to mention here much less to give an Answer to a Report very Confidently spread about and which some people are weak enough to take  upon Trust viz  That by the  Treaty of Commerce  leave was to be given to Export our Wooll unwrought into  France But as it is certain that such a R  port is industriously spread about where it is thought there is Ignorance enough to suffer so great a De  sion it is reasonable to observe from it what  Endeavours  are us'd by some among us to Impose upon the people of this Nation in the grossest manner for the carrying on other Designs equally Destructive to the publick safety  But to return to what was mention'd viz of the real abatement of Duties which is obtain'd by this  Treaty  it may be a profitable Explanation of the present  Treaty of Commerce  and may prevent the prejudices which some Entertain against this  Treaty  should a brief Account be given them of the Difference between the present State of our Trade with  France  and what it has been at several times when it has nevertheless been carried on by us to Advantage and what it was to have been by the  Treaty  or would have been had the  Articles  been made Effectual And as this shall be done in brief Tables referring to the several Heads of our Exportation as they now lye before us so they may afterwards be brought down one by one to the particular Trading Towns and Counties of  Britain  where those Branches of our  Manufactures  are carried on  To begin with our  Woollen Manufactures  all which now stand Prohibited and must do so till the said  Articles  are made Effectual the following Table will shew what Duties are taken off by this Treaty and upon what low Duties they would have been admitted into  France  by this Treaty had it been made Effectual as well as what Prohibitions and high Duties the Trade now labours under  The following is an Account of several  Goods  and  Woollen Manufactures  of  Great Britain  now Prohibited in  France  the Time when the high Duties were laid upon them before the said Prohibition with what they were to pay by the  Tariff  of which was to

Manufactures  of  Britain  in general who can read this Table without  being sensible of the Disadvantage our Trade lyes under in the present situation of our Commerce with  France  When they shall Read the Word  Prohibited  continually before every  Article  of our  Woollen Manufacture  and shall remember that for Twelve Years past none of all those Goods have been admitted into  France  but by way of  Holland  whereas very great Quantities of  Woollen Manufactures  were Yearly Exported thither before besides other Goods of the Growth and Production of our own Country or of our Plantations which is the same thing and ought so to be esteemmed  When the QUEEN  who always had the Good of Her Subjects and the Prosperity of their Commerce at Her Heart  found it was in Her Power to open such a Door of Trade to Her People  on Terms so much to the Loss and Disadvantage of  France  and so evidently to the Advantage of Her own Kingdoms  it could not but be with great Satisfaction that Her Majesty gave in Charge to Her Ministers and Plenipotentiaties  to Conclude a Treaty which took off all the Burthens and Prohibitions which the Mistakes of former Years had brought upon the Trade and by which Her Enemies were obliged to make deep Wounds in their own Trade to comply with those Demands  But it must be very disobliging to the QUEEN as well as very surprizing to her Faithful Subjects to see in what manner  some People  receive and how disingeniously they Construe  all Her Majesty's Endeavours to shew Her affectionate Concern for the Welfare of Her Subjects and the Prosperity of Their Commerce  as if that very Care which Her Majesty has so Eminently express'd  for Their Good  was a Contrivance of Her and their Enemies to betray us to the  French  and to give up the  British Interest in Trade  to the most dangerous Rivals they have in the World  Certainly Mankind cannot be so far carried away with the stream of their Passions as to deny this general Maxim  That nothing ought to be believed in such publick Debates as these but what is proved  This  Paper  has from its beginning taken this for a Rule  and therefore brings Authentick Proofs with it of every Thing it says yet these Men say it is all Lies  on the contrary  they bring no  Proof  at all of what they say and yet they expect to be believed  To shorten the  Dispute  the  MERCATOR  shall as modestly as the  Case  will allow make a fair Challenge to all  Opposers  which if they do not Answer they can but ill Justify any of their future  Objections  against the Truth of what is alledg'd in this Paper  The  Challenge  is▪  That whereas they charge this Paper with Lying  they ought to descend to Particulars and stating it truly  let the World know what ONE THING it is the MERCATOR has Affirm'd Asserted made Publick as Truth which is not so  If this cannot be done  the charge of Lying will turn back upon them with great Disadvantage to themselves  One Condition only must be desir'd of them viz  That they will not expect any thing should be taken upon Trust on one side more than on the other  and therefore that they will be careful as the MERCATOR has always done to quote their Authorities for all they shall say the Validity of which when Confronted with those of this Paper may be easily examined and the  Readers  may judge whether are in the Right if they do not think fit to do this as the MERCATOR will not think it worth while to take any Notice of them so neither can they expect it of any one else  That their  Scheme  of which they  oasted is it self one general Complication of Fraud and false Representations has been made appear even to both Houses of Parliament The MERCATOR in that as in every other Case of like Nature says nothing from himself but spakes the Language of the  Custom House  Books gives exact Copies of the Commissioners Reports sign'd under their Hands and proves every thing in particular by Authentick Papers if these are false the MERCATOR would be  very willing to see the Proof of it if any mistake has happened whether wilful or by the negligence of Clerks the Books are remaining and may be referr'd to Why do not these People tell us where these Mistakes lye why do they not prove that the MERCATORS has made false Draughts of those Accounts and Reports omitted any thing or added any thing to make his Arguments appear the Better as on the other Hand has been proved to be their practice even in a most scandalous manner in their late SCHEME under the hands of the Commissioners of the  Customs  and by them Laid before both Houses of Parliament  All the use this Paper shall make of this unfair Usage is only to proceed with the same Caution in all that it shall make publick still taking care to offer nothing but what is sufficiently confirm'd by such Authorities as shall always stand the Test of the strictest Examination taking no notice of any thing which shall be said in Opposition to it unless it comes likewise supported by such Proofs as may give a due Weight and make it reasonable to be Inquired into  But to return to the Subject of Trade from which as few Digressions as possible shall be made in this  Paper  The last MERCATOR gave a true Prospect of the State of one Branch of our Trade in  France  as it now stands and as it might now have stood had the  Treaty  taken place that is to say  the Branch of Trade which concerns our  Woollen Manufactures  in particular  The  Manufacturers  of  Great Britain  may there see what Circumstances they are now in as to  Trade  and what their unnatural Joy is built upon which they have so publickly shewn at the Delay of the Advantages which they might by this time have rafted of in their Trade  Next to the said Exportation of our  Woollen Manufacture  the  Fishing Trade  is our immediate Concern and that more especially since our  Union  with  Scotland  The  Northern  Parts of  Britain  have a peculiar Interest in the  Fishery  and the securing a Market in  France  for the great Quantities of  Fish  that are or may be Cured in  Scotland  and in the  North  and  West  parts of  England  is of so great Consequence to this Nation that it cannot be omitted in a  Treaty of Commerce  The  French  had not forgotten this part or to encourage their own Subjects to launch into the  Fishery  as well as into the other Branches of our  Trade  The high Duties in  France  laid upon  Fish  from  Great Britain were an effectual Support to the  French  Projects of  Fishing  and a Bar to the  Fishing of Great Britain For  Scotland  by the  Union  being brought into the same Prohibitions and being esteemed as the same Nation came thereby also under  the same Inconveniencies of Trade  and  lost the Advantage of their Trade to  France which before was very considerable especially in  Fish Scotland  having always before the  Union  Exported to  France  yearly a very great Quantity of  Herring Salmon  and white  Fish  It cannot but be grateful to all those Parts of  Britain  which are sensible of the  Benefit  of the  Fishery  and who depend  upon the Exportation of the  Fish  when taken  to understand  That the Importation of our  Fish  into  France  is now by this  Treaty  left open upon very easy Terms  and particularly  upon the same Terms with the  Dutch which could never be obtained before  The just Care and Concern which Her Majesty has shewn for the Interest of Her own Subjects and the Extent of their Commerce has been seen in removing that Inequality and providing that our Fishery shall now be upon the same Foot with that of the  Dutch  and have the same Encouragement of an open Trade to  France  a thing which however the  Dutch  have Taught us to reject here they always took care to secure for themselves and found no little advantage in it  The Merchants and Gentlemen of the  North  part of  Britain  and of the  West  also have frequently express'd to the Government their great Concern for the obtaining  this Liberty of Commerce and the great Advantages which it would be to them if obtain'd as may be seen by the  Representation  of the Royal Buroughs in  Scotland  formerly sent up to the Lords Commissioners of Trade and of others also And unless we could suppose them to Act in Contradiction to themselves it must be a particular Satisfaction to them all to see what provision Her Majesty has made for the said  FishingTrade  by this  Treaty  and it must be impossible without an Infatuation which it would be rude to suggest that the Merchants and Trading People of  Scotland  of the  North  of  England  of the Coasts about  Y  mouth  and  Loest  ff  or the Counties of  Cornwall  and  Devon  can be drawn into say  they are pleas'd that the Articles of this Treaty remain Ineffectual  Having thus often mention'd  Scotland  and the  FishingTrade  it is proper also to take notice how by the present Treaty Her Majesty made it Her especial Care in behalf of Her  Scots  Subjects as well as  English  to have all those new Burthens which were laid upon the  British Fishing Trade  only and which gave that Trade away from us to the  Dutch  taken away in  France  and as it is very surprizing that the Power of any PartyInfluence should make us in  England  insensible of such advantages So the next Paper shall let you see what those Advantages are and that they are not equally disregarded in  Scotland  as they are here  FINIS
