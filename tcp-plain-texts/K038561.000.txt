 THE LAW OF LOMBARDY A TRAGEDY AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  WRITTEN BY ROBERT JEPHSON ESQ AUTHOR OF BRAGANZA  LONDON PRINTED FOR T EVANS NEAR YORKBUILDINGS STRAND MDCCLXXIX Price One Shilling and Sixpence  TO THE KING  SIR  YOUR Majesty's having graciously permitted me to prefix your royal name to this tragedy has impress'd me with so deep a sense of the honor that I despair of finding terms sufficient to express my acknowledgments  Tho' the public which is seldom disposed to receive favourably performances destitute of merit has been pleased to give this a very indulgent reception I must still regret its imperfections when I consider that it may for a moment become the object of your Majesty's attention Having omitted nothing in my power to render it not entirely unworthy of such an exalted patronage I can't forbear to flatter myself that it may raise in the breast of your Majesty those emotions which well imagined distress never fails to excite in the noblest natures but at the same time I more anxiously wish that no other uneasiness but from such fictitious sorrow may ever approach you and that the greatest and most amiable sovereign in Europe may be also for ever distinguished as the most prosperous and happy  I am SIR  Your Majesty's most dutiful subject and most obliged humble servant ROBERT JEPHSON  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  PALADORE  Mr SMITH  KING  Mr BENSLEY  RINALDO  Mr PACKER  ASCANIO  Mr HURST  LUCIO  Mr FARREN  SENATOR  Mr CHAMBERS  SHEPHERD  Mr WRIGHT  FORESTERS  Mr WRIGHTEN  Mr FAWCET  SQUIRE TO PALADORE  Mr PHILEMORE  AND  BIRENO  Mr HENDERSON  PRINCESS  Miss YOUNGE  ALINDA  Mrs ROBINSON  THE LAW OF LOMBARDY A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  A Chamber in the Palace  BIRENO ALINDA  ALINDA  I Wonder not you should suspect me slow  In this strange office had you but enjoin'd me  Shut out the sun ten times his annual rounds  Feed all my life on pulse or with coarse weeds  Obscure the little grace which Nature's hand  Has lent my outside then without a wherefore  From the meek humbleness of love I bear you  My obedience wou'd have follow'd  BIRENO  Sweet impatience  Smooth that contracted brow  ALINDA  But to commend  To any other woman those fond vows  I hop'd to own unpartner'd is it less  Than to expect my tongue suborn'd should plead  Against the dearest interest of my life  And make me earnest for my own undoing  BIRENO  Must I again call down the saints to witness  That for convenience only not from love  I seek to wed the princess My ambition  Aims at the crown her dower were that bright gem  Heir'd by a pigmy the meer mock of sight  By ideot drawling and a shrew's perverseness  No less shou'd I desire it If I prosper  My heart as ever shall be thine and hers  The dull legitimate languor of the husband  ALINDA  But when to royal state Sophia joins  Such rare endowments as make doubtful strife  'Twixt Nature's gifts and Fortune's can I hope  More than some grateful note from memory  How much Alinda lov'd you  BIRENO  Trust me fair one  Beauty's degrees are in the lover's fancy  Not in a scal'd perfection Varying nature  Has lineaments for every appetite  Not her arch'd brows nor stature Junolike  Her crisped tresses spun from finest gold  Nor the intelligent lustre of her eye  To me have half such charms as thy soft mien  The pure carnation of thy dimpling cheek  And unassuming sweet simplicity  But hast thou urg'd my suit  ALINDA  Spite of ourselves  The tongue interprets from the abundant heart  Bireno's image filling all my thoughts  Cou'd I be silent on a theme so lov'd  BIRENO  And how does she receive the gentle tale  ALINDA  Sometimes she chides and sometimes smiling tells me  But that she knows me wise such lavish praise  Might hint a heart touch'd deeply and ill suits  The sober preference of an humble maid  Who cannot hope to call you hers in honour  Then with discreetest lessons will she school me  To guard my breast 'gainst love forgetting still  How much she wants the counsel she bestows  BIRENO  Does she then love  ALINDA  She never told me so  But signs far more significant than speech  Reveal it hourly  BIRENO  Let me know my rival  Tho' my foreboding heart already whispers  It must be Paladore  ALINDA  Oh rightly guess'd  Her love for him makes her unjust to you  BIRENO  Curses o'ertake him Near his brighter fires  My star shines dimly I was wonder'd at  Till this new meteor shot across men's eyes  And drew all gaze to follow At our tournaments  He foils me like a novice in grave council  I prate unmark'd while hoary heads bow down  In reverence to his weighty utterance  And thus the upstart heresy of opinion  Runs on this smooth impostorBy what signs  Take you this note of her affection towards him  ALINDA  By such we women deem infallible  If unexpectedly she hears him nam'd  Sweet discomposure seizes all her frame  Suffasion softer than Aurora's blush  Spreads o'er her beauteous cheek If she expect  His presence at the court studious to please  Beyond her wonted elegance of dress  With nicer care she counsels at her glass  To make the daintiest workmanship of nature  By ornament more winning  BIRENO  Indications  That speak and shrewdly yet their vanity  To catch the flattery of the fool they scorn  Will bait such hooks as these Have you no proof  More unequivocal  ALINDA  What wou'd you more  We reason from ourselves looking within  We find in our own breasts the according springs  Of motions similar when first I lov'd  So did I wish to please so doubt my power  Yet more than this her eye still follows him  And when the unwelcome hour of parting comes  The chearful flame that lighted up her countenance  Expires sighs heave and a soft silent tear  Steals down her cheek  BIRENO  Enough I'm satisfied  She loves him and the frost of my reception  Conspires in proof Now then my best Alinda  You must assist me on this single push  Hang all my fortunesIf my rival wed her  Farewel my hopes my country  ALINDA  How your country  A voluntary exile for the loss  Of one you swear you love not  BIRENO  My possessions  The means of pleasure to my thriftless youth  Moulder in confiscation thus my dukedom  My royal ancestry and rank in the state  So scantily supported will but mock me  A marriage with the princess wou'd heal all  But if I fail I will not stay to see  Upstarts made rich by my inheritance  Nor the proud finger of the slave I scorn  Point at the princely beggar  ALINDA  Oh good heaven  Devise commandCan my best industry  Prevent this ruin Tell me but the means  And bid me fly  BIRENO  No more of jealousy  But with appliance dext'rous call her thoughts  To me and my deservings speak with slight  Yet not as by suggestion of my rival  I've known more way made in a woman's grace  By such confederate arts than could be won  By a long siege of amorous enginry  Soft flatteries sighs protestings infinite  And all the fervor of impatient love  ALINDA  But should this fail  BIRENO  I'll spread a finer snare  Subtle as fabled Vulcan forg'd in Lemnos  To enmesh them thy soft hand my dear Alinda  Must help to hold the toils  ALINDA  But see she comes  The king too and her lover  BIRENO  I'll retire  And seek thee presently rivet thine ear  Meantime to what they utter thy report  Shall somewhat shape my course Highflighted fool  Check thy bold soaring else my hot revenge  Shall melt thy waxed plumes and hurl thee down  To a devouring sea that roars beneath thee  Exit  Alinda  retires  SCENE II  KING PRINCESS PALADORE ATTENDANTS  KING  You shall no more Sophia to the chase  This morning's danger makes my blood run cold  Had not thy wellsped lance brave Paladore  Pierc'd the huge boar that gor'd her foaming horse  These eyes now rais'd in thanks to heaven and thee  Had wept her lifeless  PALADORE  Ever prais'd be Fortune  That plac'd me near her Since a common feat  That daily dies our weapons thus ennobled  By blest conjunct on with her precious safety  I would not change for the best garland won  By Caesar's conquering sword  PRINCESS  We are not nice  In dangers imminent to chuse the means  Of our deliverance yet believe me Sir  More than for life preserv'd I thank the chance  That made you my preserver Th' unwelcome hand  Rendering us service like sharp frost in sunshine  Chills the fresh blossom of our gratitude  Which else uncheck'd would put forth all its sweetness  KING  I have much serious matter for your ear  To  Paladore  Our helms must be lac'd close our swords new edg'd  'Gainst fiercer foes than these rude foresters  That make us sport with peril  PALADORE  By my life  My cruel heart beats high to give it welcome  For Virtue's test is action  KING  Thus my paper  Brief its contents but fearful Burgundy  Stung by refusal of my daughter's love  Stirs up commotion 'gainst our kingdom's peace  And soon the golden grain of Lombardy  Shall be trod down beneath the furious heel  Of peasants cas'd in iron  PRINCESS  Heaven avert it  For sure 'twere better I had ne'er been born  Than live the fatal cause why war's rude blast  Disturb'd the quiet of my father's age  Which soft repose shou'd foster The griev'd people  Will chide your gentleness that did not bend  My heart to this obedience and your virtue  Seen thro' th' unwelcome colour of the event  For reverence find upbraiding  KING  No Sophia  I would not violate the meanest right  Of my least subject for the fear or promise  Of any issue Is my child my daughter  Sweet duteous amiable burn free and royal  Less charter'd from oppression than a stranger  A selfinvited wooer here he sojourn'd  To thrive as your approving gave him licence  I fed him not with promise you with hope  Nor shall audacious menace ere extort  What courtesy denied him  PALADORE  To his teeth  Hurl your defiance King 'tis proud to threaten  But baseness to be aw'd by it From my breast  I'd tear these hallow'd symbols give this steel  To be a baby's plaything cou'd my heart  Distrustful of the event forbode one fear  To cast black presage on a cause so noble  KING  Thou gem of Britain Dear in my esteem  As wert thou native here be Pavias' shield  Her pride her pillar yes our hardy files  Led on by thee shall drive the boaster back  To mourn at home his baffled preparations  PALADORE  Oh wou'd the fortune of this glorious strife  Hung on my arm alone  KING  Our daughter's hand  Is destin'd for a prince who draws his blood  From the same source as mine our kingdom's heir  Did not this sweet prevention stand between  To bless Bireno with two matchless gifts  Her beauty and a royal diadem  PRINCESS  Bireno Sir  KING  Even he I know his worth  But is there poison in my kinsman's name  It pales the healthful vermeil of your cheek  Dims your bright eye and viels your wonted smiles  PRINCESS  Alas I cannot speak  KING  Why then hereafter  Will better suit this subject Sir farewel  We shall expect your aid to counsel with us  What present mounds our wisdom best may raise  'Gainst this loud torrent that at distance roars  Ere it rush down to spread its ruin round us  Exit  SCENE III  PRINCESS PALADORE  PRINCESS  Oh stay and hear me now Alas he's gone  Who smiles on me and kills me bids my heart  Be traitor to itself yet with soft words  Fetters my tongue which free wou'd boldly answer  Such kindness but destroys me  PALADORE  My soul's idol  I was indeed presumptuous to believe  These humble arms were destin'd to enfold  So vast a treasure yet aspiring love  Hopes things impossible  PRINCESS  Bireno He  I'd rather waste my life in singleness  Like the pale votarist pour faint orisons  At the cold shrines of senseless marble saints  And wear the eternal pavement with my knees  Than at the sacred altar load my soul  With holy perjuries to love the man  At whose approach my heart alarm'd shrinks back  While thought confirms instinctive Nature's hate  PALADORE  See like a haughty conqueror he comes  Pleasure and pride on his exulting brow  At distance speak his triumph  PRINCESS  Arm me Disdain  To meet the bold intruderGentle Paladore  'Tis thus thy rival woo's me Courtship's season  Is the short date of woman's sovereignty  For liberty we have but in exchange  The little tribute of a lover's sighs  His humble seeming and soft courtesy  Yet these he thinks too rich a sacrifice  And owns no advocate but pride in love  SCENE IV  To them  BIRENO  BIRENO  Confirm'd fair princess By the King's command  You see me here a joyful visitant  'Tis not unknown why warlike Burgundy  Spreading his hostile banners to the wind  Makes sword and fire his dreadful harbingers  PRINCESS  The cause I have heardBut on  PALADORE  Aside  Down swelling heart  BIRENO  Your yet unplighted hand gives to this war  Its edge and colour to remove that prize  Beyond the invader's reach my sovereign's wisdom  Deems the best means to blunt his hostile sword  Therefore on me he deigns  PRINCESS  I understand  But have no present ear for such a theme  My father's goodness left my choice unforc'd  Of one unwelcome suitor the same justice  Secures me from compulsion in a second  BIRENO  And must I bear this answer to the King  PRINCESS  Myself will be my own interpreter  And save your trouble Once more Sir I thank you  To  Paladore  and exit  SCENE V BIRENO PALADORE  BIRENO  Well go thy ways woman's epitome  Beauteous aenigma Who wou'd solve you rightly  Must thus interpret make your outward semblance  An index pointing to its contrary  When your smooth polish'd vizors beam in smiles  Displeasure's at your hearts the moody brow  Tells inward sunshine tears are joy not sorrow  You sooth where you approve not and look gall  When sweet content honies your appetites  PALADORE  These common railings 'gainst that gentle sex  Denote his humour more who utters them  Than their defect or any deep conception  But you have chosen a season for hard thoughts  Rebukes your censure still the chamber's air  Winnows her balmy breathing from our eyes  Scarce glides her beauteous form when your dark spleen  As venom'd things suck poison from sweet flowers  Finds matter for distemper's nourishment  And food for calumny in excellence  BIRENO  Her form indeed is fair  PALADORE  Ay and her mind  If more can be more fair more amiable  Thy neverrender'd snowcold Apenine  Is not so free from taint as from offence  Her spotless bosom yet has she a tear  Healing as balm for others frailties  That makes remission heavenly sweet persuasion  Hangs on her words with power oracular  To shame the cynic's chidingSpirit of truth  She is thy visible divinity  And 'tis thy reverence to pay homage to her  BIRENO  'Tis to my wish  Aside  I grant her well endow'd  And in fair seeming most preeminent  But for these other virtues you have nam'd  They are of different climes and earlier ages  Our Pavias ladies cast in earthly moulds  They make the most of Nature's liberal gifts  Put pleasure out to usury and love  As ease convenience or the moment sways them  PALADORE  You're pleasant lord  BIRENO  No soberly thy friend  Shall I be plain  PALADORE  What call you your past measure  Was it a courtier's strain  BIRENO  You love the princess  PALADORE  And heaven may be belov'd  BIRENO  Ay and hop'd too  For heaven has many mansions and receives  Too large for limitation all deservers  But in a lady's heart there's but one place  Though many may contend for't therefore friend  Waste not your precious sighs which might enkindle  Bright sparks of equal love in some soft breast  Destined to mate your fondness in hopeless wooing  Search not the cause believe me on my truth  'Tis past all reckoning hopeless  PALADORE  Nothing's hopeless  Though deeds untried oft seem impossible  And craven Sloth molting his sleekless plumes  With drowsy wonder views the advent'rous wing  That soars the shining azure o'er his head  What will not yield to daring Victory  Sits on the helm whose crest is Confidence  And boldness wins success in love's soft strife  As in the dangerous din of rattling war  BIRENO  How cou'd I make me sport were I light minded  Were I malignant mischief from this mood  That runs so contrary to all sober sense  But here I rest in kindnessBe advis'd  Push not a desperate purpose by my life  The princess loves you not  PALADORE  I'll bear no more  Matchless audacity Let me take thee in  From crown to toe walk round thee and survey thee  Like a prodigious thing for such thou should'st be  To put my course of love in circumscription  And school me like a boy with unsought precept  BIRENO  Lovers are sick with fevers of the brain  Diseas'd by airy hope high flighted fancy  Imaginations bred from selfconceit  An arch deluder which presents the Juno  Their frenzy grasps at with a zone unbound  While like Ixion's mistress the coy queen  Slumbers on golden beds in high Olympus  PALADORE  Hear me proud duke▪ had I no other spur  But thy forbidding were there no incitement  From her transcendent beauty did no beam  Shoot from her eye to light eternal love  At passion's altar were she swart and froward  Oh blasphemy to think it in despight  I would assume an unfelt extasy  Invoke her name till echo should grow faint  With the perpetual burden and devise  All means of contradiction to proclaim  Scorn of thy council and defiance to thee  BIRENO  Then hear to dash thy pride since thus you urge me  My experience of her lightness well she knows  Would freeze me as her husband and her hand  Which but to save appearances I ask  I wou'd reject if offer'd so her craft  Sooths you with feign'd endearments As a mistress  I find her worth my holding but a wife  Fit for a prince must come with better gifts  Than amorous blood and beautyNay but mark me  PALADORE  Trust not too far the reverence of this place  Awaythou yet art safemy sword once drawn  BIRENO  Am I so lost in your esteem you hold me  Your friend profess'd in malice capable  Or falsehood thus to wound you  PALADORE  Both by Heaven  BIRENO  And will maintain this thinking  PALODORE  With my life  BIRENO  'Tis a deep ventureMine upon my truth  When fullorb'd Phoebe wheel her fleecy car  To silver yon blue concave midst the pines  That wave their green tops o'er the battlement  Of her nightchamber in the garden meet me  Alone when we encounter in that place  You there shall listen to conditions meet  For both our honours So till then farewel  PALADORE  alone  I'll meet thee be assur'd I will  Gird on thy keenest edge if thou hast aught  Unsettled in this world dispatch it quickly  We stand upon the utmost verge of Fate  And one or both of us must plunge for ever  Exit  SCENE VI  BIRENO  alone  The wise should watch the event on fortune's wheel  That for a moment circles at the top  And seiz'd not vanishesI must about it  My all's at stakeYe ministers of vengeance  That hide your gory locks in misthung caves  And roll your deadly eyeballs o'er the edge  Of your insatiate daggers shaking ever  Dews of oblivious sleep from your stung brows  Receive me of your band ne'er to know peace  Till this keen writhing vulture quit my heart  And with blunt beak and flagging wings outstretch'd  Drowze o'er the mangled victims of my rage  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  a Chamber  PRINCESS  alone  OH blessed most blessed are the insensible  In the mild zone of calm indifference  No hatred chills them and no passion burns  To feed and sleep and do observance due  To the stale ritual of quaint ceremony  Fills up the humble measure of their hope  Smooth and unruffled glides their temperate stream  And one day rounds their whole life's history  Oh had my heart been such but Nature poiz'd  In distribution when she gives the touch  Alive to exstacy in like extreme  Subjects the sense to anguish the same soul  That in the hope of wedding Paladore  Enjoy'd its sum of bliss with equal pain  Averts me from his rival thus entranc'd  'Twixt love and fear I feel the pangs of both  And the sharp conflict rends me Ha my father  Now comes the trial  SCENE II KING PRINCESS  KING  How in tears Sophia  Come 'tis not wellI fear I guess the cause  This morn I did but hint a purpose to you  Of import dear to your own happiness  And your chang'd brow reproving my intent  Cut short my free discourse  PRINCESS  Oh good my Lord  I am not practis'd to conceal my thoughts  And least from you by casting o'er my looks  The unalter'd vizor of tranquility  When perturbation like a sleepless guest  Forbids my bosom's quiet  KING  I have lov'd thee  With fondness so unbated that 'twere needless  For confirmation to attest by words  What all my thoughts my life's whole carriage towards thee  Have set beyond the question  PRINCESS  Oh to me  Your love has been like those perpetual springs  "That ever flow" and waste not my least wish  Scarce had its birth ere its accomplishment  In your preventive kindness  KING  Since 'tis so  If chance the current of my present will  To yours run contrary you must not deem  That meerly to enforce authority  Or wake controlement which might sleep to death  In its difuse I now expect the course  Of your desires should lose themselves in mine  Or flow by my direction  PRINCESS  As my father  The giver of my life I reverence you  Next as your subject my obedience stands  Bound by the general tie but since your power  Has still been temper'd so with lenity  That even the stranger's cause with patient hearing  Is weigh'd ere you determine I your daughter  May hope at least an equal privilege  With favour in my audience  KING  I were else  Unnatural withholding from my child  What aliens claim by justice Give me hearing  The Duke Bireno loves you has my promise  That like a wellgrac'd advocate my tongue  Shou'd win your gentle favour to his suit  Urging such commendations of his love  As modesty though conscious of desert  May wish you hear yet cannot speak itself  PRINCESS  Ah Sir forbear he knows my heart already  Already has he heard from my own lips  I cannot love him poorly he engages  Your honour'd combination in a league  That whatsoe'er its issue must conspire  To wound your daughter's peace  KING  By heaven you wrong him  To wound your peace He seeks your happiness  And so am I his second  PRINCESS  But these means  Are adverse to the end for if I wed him  This is no raving of rash extacy  On death that only can dissolve my chain  Will hang my future hope as eagerly  As the poor weary seabeat mariner  Pants for the shore so shall my outstretch'd arms  Embrace the welcome terror My refusal  To you the gentlest kindest best of fathers  Must seem repugnance harsh and o'er my duty  Before untainted casts the sickly hue  Of pale suspicion thus begins his love  Fearful to me in each alternative  KING  Why this is infant rhet'ric to protest  The impulse of a strong antipathy  Which never causeless sways the human breast  Yet give no reason why  PRINCESS  Alas to feel it  O'ermasters every reason Need we search  To ground aversion on weigh'd argument  When instinct cuts the tedious process short  And makes the heart our umpire  KING  Hear me calmly  My days are almost number'd this white head  Bears not in vain its reverend monitors  Time puts a tongue in every hoary hair  To warn the wise man of mortality  When I am gone behold thy single state  Unhusbanded unfather'd stands expos'd  Ev'n as the tender solitary shrub  On the bleak mountain's summitEvery blast  May bend or break thy sweetness this strong fence  This union would enroot its shelter round  And like a forest shield thee  PRINCESS  Let me hope  A stronger sence in a whole people's love  Their grateful memory of my father's virtue  And loyalty hereditarly mine  Descending like the sceptre to your issue  KING  Think'st thou my aspiring kinsman whose ambition  Impatient waits till my declining beam  Give place to his meridian who already  Wins from my side a moiety of my court  By his succession's hope will tamely view  That sceptre wielded by a woman's hand  Nor wrest it from thy grasp No my fair kingdom  I see the meeting torrents of contention  Deluge thy peaceful vales while her weak sex  Unable to direct or stem the tide  Will be borne down and swept to ruin with it  PRINCESS  These evils but in possibility  May never come but Oh 'tis certain sorrow  To promise love obedience duty honor  When the heart's record vouches 'gainst the tongue  It changes order's course the holy tie  Of weilproportion'd marriage still supposes  These bonds have gone before nor is there power  Creative in the simple ceremony  The seed unsown to give that harvest growth  KING  Here break we offTo sue and sue in vain  But ill becomes a father may my augury  Be more in fear than wisdom Hold tomorrow  The council meets to scan this threaten'd war  The people call it thine then be thou present  To thank and animate their zeal to serve us  Exit  SCENE III  PRINCESS  alone  I shall attend your order This cold parting  Speaks his displeasure and my heart accustom'd  To the kind sunshine of approving smiles  Droops at the chilling change Ye gentle breasts  Strangers as yet to love be warn'd by me  Soft as the printless step of midnight sleep  The subtle tyrant steals into the soul  Once seated there securely he controuls  The idle strife of unimpassion'd ties  And laughs to scorn their sober impotence  As feeble vassals list their arms in vain  In the unequal conflict soon o'erthrown  They prove their weakness and his power supreme  Exit  SCENE IV  A Garden  RINALDO  alone Night  He must pass this way thro' the postern gate  That leads here only with distemper'd pace  I saw him hasten Since the evening banquet  His wild demeanour "  has put on more change  "  Than yonder fickle planet in her orb  Just now he seiz'd his sword look'd at and poiz'd it  Then girt it round him while his bloodshot eye  And heaving bosom spoke the big conception  Of some dire purpose There is mischief towards  I may perhaps prevent itthese tall shrubs  Will hide me from his viewSoft soft 'tis he  Rinaldo  retires  SCENE V PALADORE  alone  PALADORE  Why do I shake thus If indeed she's false  I shou'd rejoice to have the spell unbound  That chains me to delusion He swears deeply  But bad men's oaths are breath and their base lies  With holiest adjurations stronger vouch'd  Than native truth which center'd in itself  Rests in its simpleness then this bold carriage  Urging the proof by test infallible  The witness of my sight Why these combin'd  Spite of my steady seeming vipertooth'd  Gnaw at my constancy and inward spread  Suggestions which unmaster'd soon would change  The ruddy heart to blackness But Oh shame  These doubts are Slander's leigersSweetest innocence  That now perhaps lapt in Elysian sleep  Seest heaven in vision let not these base sounds  Creep on thy slumber lest they startle rest  And change thy trance to horrorLo he comes  Yon light that glimmers 'twixt the quivering leaves  Like a small star directs his footsteps hither  SCENE VI  To him  BIRENO  with a Lanthorn  BIRENO  Your pardon Sir I fear I've made you wait  But here beneath the window of his mistress  A lover favour'd and assur'd like you  Must have a thousand pleasant fantasies  To entertain his musing  PALADORE  Sir my fancy  Has various meditations no one thought  Mix'd with disloyalty of her whose honour  Your boldness wou'd attaint  BIRENO  Then you hold firm  I am a boaster  PALADORE  'Tis my present creed  BIRENO  'Twere kind perhaps to leave you in that error  The wretch who dreams of bliss while his sleep lasts  Is happy as in waking certainty  But if he's rous'd and rous'd to misery  He sure must curse the hand that shook his curtain  PALADORE  I have no time for maxims and your mirth  Is most unseasonable Thus far to endure  Perhaps is too much tamenessTo the purpose  BIRENO  With all convenient speed You're not to learn  We have a law peculiar to this realm  That subjects to a mortal penalty  All women nobly born be their estate  Single or husbanded who to the shame  Of chastity o'erleap its thorny bounds  To wanton in the flowery path of pleasure  Nor is the proper issue of the king  By royalty exempted  PALADORE  So I have heard  But wherefore urge you this  BIRENO  Not without reason  I draw my sword in peace Now place your lips  Here on this sacred cross By this deep oath  Most binding to our order you must swear  Whate'er you see or whatsoe'er your wrath  From what you see that never shall your tongue  Reveal it to the danger of the princess  PALADORE  A most superfluous bondBut on I swear  BIRENO  Hold yet a little Now Sir once again  Let this be touch'dYour enmity to me  If by the process it should be provok'd  Must in your breast be smother'd not break out  In tilting at my life nor your gage thrown  For any after quarrel The cause weigh'd  I might expect your love but 'tis the stuff  And proper quality of hoodwink'd rage  To wrest offence from kindness  PALADORE  Should your proof  Keep pace with your assurance scorn not rage  Will here be paramount and my sword sleep  From my indifference to a worthless toy  Valued but in my untried ignorance  BIRENO  So you determine wisely I must bind you  To one condition more If I make palpable  Her preference in my favour you must turn  Your back on Lombardy and never more  Seek her encounter  PALADORE  By a soldier's faith  Should it be so I wou'd not breathe your air  A moment longer for the sov'reignty  Of all the soil wash'd by your wand'ring Po  BIRENO  Summon your patience now for sure you'll need it  PALADORE  You have tried it to the last dally no more  I shiver in expectance Come your proofs  BIRENO  Well you will have them Know you first this writing  Gives a paper  PALADORE  It is the character of fair Sophia  BIRENO  I think so and as such receiv'd it from her  Convey'd with such sweet action to my hand  As wak'd the nimble spirit of my blood  Whispering how kind were the contents within  This light will aid the moon tho' now she shines  In her full splendor At your leisure read it  PALADORE  reading  Kind words indeed I fear I fear too common  BIRENO  It works as I could wish How his cheek whitens  His fiery eye darts thro' each tender word  As it would burn the paper  PALADORE  reading  Ever constant  Let me look once again Is my fight false  Oh wou'd it were Fain wou'd I cast the blame  To save her crime on my imperfect sense  But did she give you this  BIRENO  Look to the address  PALADORE  Oh darkness on my eyes I've seen too much  There's not a letter but like necromancy  Withers my corporal functions Shame confound her  BIRENO  As you before were tardy of belief  You now are rash Behold these little shadows  These you have seen before  Producing two pictures  PALADORE  What's this what's this  My picture as I live I gave the false one  And her's she promis'd me Oh woman's faith  I was your champion once deceitful sex  Thought your fair mindsBut hold I may be rash  This letter and these pictures might be your's  By the king's power compelling her reluctant  To write and send them therefore let me see  All you have promis'dYou expect her summons  At yon Miranda  BIRENO  Yes the time draws near  She ever is most punctual This small light  Our wonted signal stand without its ray  For shou'd she spy more than myself beneath  Fearing discovery she'll retire again  Into her chamberWhen her beauteous form  Breaks like the moon as fair tho' not so cold  From yonder window  PALADORE  Ha by hell it opens  BIRENO  Stand you apart a moment While I climb  Yon orb now braz'd to this accustom'd scene  Will shew you who invites me I'll detain her  To give you ample leisure for such note  As counterfeits abide not  Bireno  retires  ▪  SCENE VII  PALADORE  alone  Death 'tis she  There's not a silken braid that binds her hair  One little shred of all that known attire  That wantons in the wind but to my heart  Has sent such sweet disturbance that it beat  Instinctive of her coming ere my sight  Enjoy'd the beauteous wonderSoft What now  See she lets down the cordage of her shame  To hoist him to her arms I'll look no more  Distraction Devil How she welcomes him  That's well that's wellAgain grow to her lips  Poison and aspics rot them Now she woo's him

inordinate wish  Is guilt unacted and the canon points  More 'gainst the coward heart that wou'd and dare not  Than the bold deed that braves the penalty  SCENE II  BIRENO ASCANIO  Welcome Ascanio Thanks for this kind speed  To meet my summons I have business for thee  Worthy thy subtle genius thou shalt aid me  To spread a banquet forth where two sharp guests  Ambition and Revenge shall both be feasted  Even to satiety  ASCANIO  I will not pall  Performance by protesting Is there aught  In which a pliant tongue and ready hand  No despicable engines may do service  To their best cunning use them your poor bondman  Will think himself much honour'd in obedience  BIRENO  I have profess'd myself thy friend Ascanio  And when the golden autumn of my hopes  Whose rich maturity I now wou'd hasten  Is ripe for bearing thou shall taste the fruit  That bends my swelling branches  ASCANIO  I have liv'd  The creature of your bounty and my life  I would cast from me like a useless load  When to your gracious ends unprofitable  BIRENO  My means have hitherto been poor and scanty  My power confin'd but I shall be Ascanio  Like a great river whose large urns dispense  Abundance to the subject rills around him  Till they o'erpeer their banks  ASCANIO  Oh my good lord  BIRENO  I'll trust thee as I know theefor a villain  Aside  Place thyself near me when the council meets  I shall make matter for them they foresee not  Whate'er I urge or whomsoe'er I charge  Be ready thou with the grave mockery  Of uplift eyes thy hand thus on thy breast  And heavenattesting oaths to second me

they pass what bodes that conference  LUCIO  Danger my life on't That smooth knave Ascanio  Is the Duke's crucible his breast receives  The mass of his crude projects and his brain  A subtle fire refines the drossy ore  To bear the ready stamp for present mischief  OFFICER  The Duke of late grows past his custom courteous  Joins hands with us and calls us by our names  Gives praise and largess to the soldiery  Whom he was wont to style State caterpillars  Burthens of peace and but endur'd in war  As necessary evils  LUCIO  It denotes  Or I lack charity trouble to the state  I know him proud subtle and pitiless  Nor will his nature change these elements  However for a season he put on  A smoother guise and fashion suitable  To the end he aims at  OFFICER  Best conceal these thoughts  For

Knights Attendants  Health to your Majesty  KING  Thanks gentle friends  But why this faintness in your salutations  Why wear your brows that ominous livery  I trust our gallant spirits will not palter  Because a rash invader threatens us  When I was young as you to hear of war  Made my blood dance but these good days are past  This sapless trunk shrinks from its mailed bark  Yet age has still its use count me your steward  Holding the honours of the state in trust  For all deserversShe shall better thank you  SCENE V  To the above  PRINCESS  Attendants  More retribution dwells in beauty's smile  Than in whole volumes of an old man's praise  Approach my child Come grace thy father's side  These are thy champions give your women tasks  Bid all the looms of Pavia ply their labors  A scarf for every warrior they'll deserve them  PRINCESS  They will not want my thanks nor such poor tokens  How much I prize their worth their hightouch'd virtue  Finds in itself the source and end

their first care to the seat of life  So now the wounded vitals of our honour  Demand our prior tendence  KING  Speak good cousin  Do dark conspiracy and homebred treason  Unnatural leaguers with a foreign foe  Bid the sharp sword of vengeance turn its edge  'Gainst our own children  BIRENO  Yes though nature bleeds  Justice will take her course I see before me  The prime of the kingdom and from some among you  Since they in whose authority abides  The executive of power best can tell  I now wou'd hear why do our registers  Contain that rigorous ordinance which respects  The chastity of women  FIRST SENATOR  To that question  The law's preamble answers 'Tis rehears'd  That the wild licence of our countrywomen  O'erleapt all modest bounds Sweet pudency  That ruby of the sex had been cast by  For casual wantonness till our name abroad  Became a byword and confusion strange  Disturb'd domestic peace A spurious issue  The slips of chance and wildness were engrafted  In rich inheritances while the sire  Caress'd the child not his and left to fortune  The true heirs of his fondness these abuses  Required an iron curb so pass'd the law  Making transgression death with no remittance  To high rank or degree in the offender  But in its bloody gripe comprizing all  BIRENO  And is this so allow'd  FIRST SENATOR  'Tis so allow'd  Nor is there a decretal in our rolls  Of less ambiguous import or more known  KING  This is beyond devining I have mark'd  To the  Princess  half aside  His changing feature some strong passion shakes him  PRINCESS  He plays emotion well most masterly  Even to the life of feigning  BIRENO  May I on  Or must I like a novice to your forms  First prove my right of audience  KING  Be not anger'd  We questioned not your rightAll counsellors  Speak what

 Who do awake this statute  FIRST SENATOR  Willingly  'Tis there provided that the accus'd being cited  In the king's presence he who brings the charge  Shou'd state each circumstance that done the herald  Thrice in six hours first in the market place  Next in the hippodrome last in the porch  Of the great temple must invite all knights  Whether impell'd by pity love or justice  To appear her champions in the marshal'd lists  There if the accuser falls she is held free  And her fair fame restor'd but if he conquers  The event confirms her guilt and the sharp axe  Severs the wanton's life  BIRENO  Then in this peril  Stand I at presentBid your trumpets sound  And call forth every bold adventurer  To try what desperate valour may achieve  'Gainst truth and my keen sword  KING  But whither wou'd'st thou  Suspense and horror fit on every brow  Like the red comet thy denouncing eye  Forebodes disaster  BIRENO  Oh relentless justice  If these be drops of weakness let them fall  'Tis the last tribute of a human sorrow  And now I am wholly thine  KING  Pr'ythee go on  BIRENO  'Twere vain to waste your patience in persuasion  I would not wantonly play with the fangs  Of such a lion law whose terrible roar  Must be appeas'd with bloodSo rests my truth  A lover's fondness last night prompted me  Attended by this gentleman  Pointing to  Ascanio  ASCANIO  Curs'd chance  Oh would the darkness of the delving mole  Had been my portion then I had not seen  What have I said Nay do not call on me  Was it for this I was commanded hither  I'll close my lips for ever  FIRST

wanderer in the palace garden  To gaze upon the window of the princess  When Oh sad object for a lover's eyes  The casement open'd and the fullorb'd moon  Bright as the radiance of meridian day

lightning flash  Can the tremendous courriers of your wrath  Sleep o'er this perjury  BIRENO  My gage is thrown  And here I stand to answer with my life  If I have charg'd her falsely  ASCANIO  Kneeling  On my knees  If ever pity touch'd your noble breast  I beg you speak no more  PRINCESS    To  Ascanio  Thou vile confederate  Of his bloodythirsty malice Have I liv'd  To hear a wretch suborn'd his sycophant  Mock me with intercession    To  Bireno  I behold thee  And scorn so struggles with astonishment  That my full heart and intercepted tongue  Almost refuse their active offices  Till passion's choak'd in silence  KING  Powers of mercy  Am I reserv'd for this My only child  The pride the joy the treasure of my soul  My age's cordial and my life's best prop  In the sweet spring and blossom of her youth  Thus blasted in my sight    To  Bireno  But Oh dark fiend  Whom hell lets loose to spread destruction round thee  Why does thy vengeance fasten upon me  Have I deserv'd this from thee Well thou know'st  I strove to make her thine I would have given thee  My crown and daughter Thou requit'st my love  By daggers steep'd in poison to my heart  BIRENO  I thank thy kindness and forgive thy rage  The father shall have licenceHonor witness  Nor malice nor ambition loos'd my tongue  To this heartrending office Reverend Lords  Let your unclouded wisdom judge between us  PRINCESS  Can I be patient Most abandon'd ruffian  Thou scoffer at all ties with the same breath  That violates a virgin's sanctity  Holy and pure beyond thy gross conceiving  Thus conscious of thy lie dar'st thou invoke  Honour to witness for thee Wherefore call  On these to judge between us See barbarian  Amaz'd and struck with horror they have heard thee  Too well thou know'st they must pronounce me guilty  Thy oath must be their law but there is one  An unseen judge an all discerning eye  Now if thou dar'st look up poor shivering wretch  He views the dark recesses of thy soul  Tremble at him thy judge  BIRENO  I were a slave  Fit for abuses cou'd I tamely bear  To see the rich reversion of my blood  Seiz'd by a base and spurious progeny  An alien Briton in his sport of lust  Stamping a brood of illegitimate kings  To bend our necks to bastard tyranny  KING  An alien Briton  BIRENO  Bid  her  answer thee  Call for her paramour her Paladore  Say why is he not present  PRINCESS  Why indeed  Hast thou not practis'd on his precious life  And to consummate this day's guilt and horror  Crown'd perjury with murder  KING  Paladore  Search find him out put pinions to your speed  And bear him to our presence  BIRENO  Spare your labour  Fear will outstrip their hasteThe dastard's gone  He had my challenge for this injury  And answer'd it by flight  KING  Confusion fled  Am I then doubly wretched Must she die  And die dishonour'd too  PRINCESS  Kneeling  Allseeing Heaven  If e'er thy interposing Providence  Dash'd the audacious councils of the wicked  If innocence ensnar'd may raise its eye  In humble hope to thy eternal throne  Look down and succour me I kneel before thee  Distrest forlorn abandon'd to despair  By all deserted and my life beset  The man my soul adores traduc'd and wrong'd  Yet Oh there is a pang surpassing all  While the envenom'd rancour of this fiend  Casts its contagion on my spotless fame  And unrebuk'd persists to blast my virtue  BIRENO  Hear she avows her love  PRINCESS  Yes glory in it  KING  Ha have a care rash girl nor turn my grief  To curses on thy headDar'st thou confirm  Thy doubtful infamy  PRINCESS  A love so pure  What bosom might not feel what tongue not own  It was a fault to hide the secret from you  But are such fighs as vestal breasts might heave  Such spotless vows as angels might record  Pollution worthy death These are my crimes  And if I labour with with a guilt more black  May the full malice of that villain reach me  KING  What can I think His absenceYet thy truth  Thy nature's modesty plead strongly for thee  Away with doubtOh thou obdurate heart  BIRENO  We trifle timeThe lists must beprepar'd  The heralds sound defiance  PRINCESS  Hold a moment  I'll tell thee how to arm thee for the combat  Steep thy keen sword in poison that no balm  May heal the wounds it gives but each be mortal  Let a staunch bloodhound with devouring fangs  And eyeballs fiery red couch o'er thy helm  The deadly sable of thy mail besmear'd  With scaffolds wheels and engines virgin's heads  Fresh bleeding from the axe's severing stroke  Scorn thou the mean device of vulgar knights  Who fight for what they reverence truth and honour  But be profess'd their champion whom thou serv'st  And write in bloody letters hell and falshood  BIRENO  This passion lady ill becomes your state  Shame is wash'd out by sorrow not by anger  KING  Hence from my sight detested parricide  Assassin butcher lest these feeble hands  Brac'd by my wrongs to more than mortal strength  Fix on thy throat and bare thy treacherous heart  BIRENO  Old man I goCompassion for thy grief  Forbids me to retort these outrages  Let frenzy take its courseWhen next we meet  Summon thy fortitude and learn mean time  Crowns

well may scorn my anger Oh my child  This little hour while I can call thee mine  Close let me strain thee to my bursting heart  Alas thy aged father can no more  Than thus to fold thee pour these scalding tears  And drench thy tender bosom with his sorrows  PRINCESS  By my best hopes of happiness hereafter  To see that reverend frame thus torn with anguish  To hear those heartfetch'd groans is greater misery  Than all the horrors of the doom that waits me  I could put on a Roman constancy  And go to death like sleep did no soft sorrow  Hang on the mourning of surviving friends  And wake a keener pang for their affliction  SCENE VIII  To them  LUCIO  LUCIO  Forgive the obedience of reluctant duty  I have the council's order to commit  The Princess to a guard's close custody  KING  Thou art my subject Lucio and my soldier  Do thy unhappy master one last service  Draw forth thy sword and strike it through my heart  PRINCESS  No let our grief be sacred if we weep  Let them not see and triumph in our tears  Martyrs have died in voluntary flames  And heroes rush'd on death inevitable  By faith inspir'd or glory Thou Sophia  Sustain'd alone by peace and innocence  Meet fate as firmly

doat thus fondly  Faith prudence honor govern'd appetites  Whose everlasting bonds make passion wise  In her were only seeming or like ornament  Thrown by or worn at pleasure then this sorrow  Hangs on her outside only that's unchang'd  For falshood did not dim her radiant eyes  Her cheek was damask'd with as pure a rose  Her breath as odorous when she most deceiv'd  As when her virture like her specious form  Seem'd spotless and unparagon'd  RINALDO  My Lord  Court not this solitude speak out your grief  Mine is no flinty breast this dangerous spleen  That makes your bane its nurture then shews worst  When nothing spent in loudness and complaint  Like a deep stream it rolls its noiseless way  Mining the banks in silence  PALADORE  Wou'd the pain  Vanish with the exposure of the cause  I shou'd make blunt the patience of your ear  By endless iteration But why tell thee  Thinkst thou there is a charm in soothing words  To pluck the sting from anguish Good Rinaldo  Thou hadst a son and lost him  RINALDO  True I had so  PALADORE  See there his very name provokes thy tears  Say can wise counsel stop them Shall I tell thee  The lot of mortals is mortality  That fate will take its course 'twas Heaven's high will  And man is born to sorrow This is wise  The sum of consolation Strains like these  Flow smoothly from the tongues of moralists  Patient as sleep in others sufferings  But vex'd as wasps and hornets in their own  RINALDO  From these imperfect starts I cannot answer  They speak but passion If my guess deceive not  A woman sure has wrong'd you  PALADORE  A true woman  I thought her angel once most basely wrong'd me  Yet if revenge kept measure with her shame  I cou'd wash out in her polluted blood  This stain to modesty Yes fair falsehood  Shou'd I appeal thee of the incontinence  My blasted eyes have witness'd the stern law  Wou'd give me ample vengeance  RINALDO  Your great spirit  Whoe'er she be that thus has injur'd you  Wou'd scorn your reparation from that law  The shame even of justice  PALADORE  Fear not still she twines  Here round my heartstrings No let late remorse  For sure it will o'ertake punish her sin  But hie thee back to Pavia presently

Go get thee gone  Sorrow's my food I'll drink my falling tears  Ye savage denizons of this wild wood  Gaunt wolves and tusky boars No more my hounds  Shall dash the spangled dewdrops from your brakes

SECOND FORESTER  Half of our hire's to come How shall we do it  Stab her or strangle  FIRST FORESTER  Make this cord her necklace  Blood may beget suspicion When she's dead  We'll drag her body to yon hazel copse  And leave the maws of wolves to bury it  There's scarce a bush in this green labyrinth  But is familiar to me Many a traveller  When I was master of us stout a gang  As ere defied the law here has paid down  His life in conflict for the gold I wanted  And never more was heard of  SECOND FORESTER  Sound your horn  I told her we'd a little on before  To give our horses forage and directed  Her way to follow shou'd she miss the path  Her ear will be her guide See Carlo see  The pretty innocent caught by her eye  Stops for a while to pluck the velvet bells  That blow beneath her feet then forward bounds  Light as the roe till some fresh floweret  Lures her again  FIRST FORESTER  Ay like the lamb that plays  And crops his pasture in the butcher's eye  Even while the knife's a whetting Hush She's here  SCENE III  To them  ALINDA  ALINDA  Beneath a rugged thorn I found this flower  Blushing unmark'd its odorous life away  I'll wear it in my breast and all who see  Will praise its beauty modest worth's sweet emblem  That first must be conspicuous ere 'tis priz'd  Oh are you there I'm ready my good guides  Where is our equipage The way's but short  We shall be there ere moonshine  FIRST FORESTER  Pretty lady  You have a longer journey than you wot of  And a dark dreary road to travel thro'  ALINDA  Why then the Duke deceiv'd me for he said  The way was pleasant and the distance nothing  SECOND FORESTER  We have helped many forward the same way  And all were much averse to travel it  ALINDA  They had no lover to obey like me  For I am light and were it ten times further  To please my Lord I'd go it blithesomely  Come come to horse  FIRST FORESTER  Are you prepar'd to die  ALINDA  Mercy defend me How Prepar'd to die  'Tis a strange question  FIRST FORESTER  But most seasonable  As fit as if your couch were spread at midnight  To ask if you were weary With our will  We do it not for we were gently bred  And hous'd with gallants once but this rough trade  Necessity enforces Come prepare  ALINDA  What do you search for And why turn you pale  You make me shake to see your stedfast eye  Does this become the servants of the Duke  To frighten whom they shou'd protect from fear  SECOND FORESTER  We are indeed the servants of the Duke  For we receive his hire then for your fears  We mean to rid you of them by your death  ALINDA  Can this be sport Alas What have I done  That such detested thoughts shou'd rise in you  FIRST FORESTER  You are troublesome Our business is to kill you  If you have a ready prayer and brief kneel there  And say it presently We run great hazard  To let you live so long  ALINDA  I'll kneel to you  Make you my saint if you'll have mercy on me  I never injur'd you nay cou'd not injure  For till this hour that I was made your charge  I never saw you Do not turn away  Think how you'll answer this to him whose love  Trusted me to your care He will require  A strict account  SECOND FORESTER  Pr'ythee let go my arm  ALINDA  May I not know why you do wish to kill me  If for these sparkling bawbles take them freely  Rob me of all but do not murder me  I am not fit to die  FIRST FORESTER  We need not thank you  For what you can't withhold Fall to your prayers  ALINDA  But are you not the servants of the Duke  Think how you swore to tend me faithfully  How he enjoin'd you as you priz'd his favor  Ev'n in your looks he'll read this cruelty  And find how you have abus'd him Think on that  FIRST FORESTER  'Twere pity she shou'd die in ignorance  Caught in the falcon's pounce the dove as well  Might gurgle to

her arms  All strife is vain  ALINDA  Oh Sir yet hold a moment  You murder more than one An innocent pledge  Of my disastrous love leaps at my side  And joins his speechless prayer  SECOND FORESTER  And not his wife  Why then your head's a forfeit to the law  And we but take before what sport or malice  Might make you render at the bloody block  With process more afflicting  ALINDA  Barbarous

succour Here's a mould  So delicate 'twere worth a miracle  To give it second life I've seen this face  Ha As I live 'tis she the beauteous girl  That waited on the Princess Soft the blood  Steals to

gentle  But will you save me from these barbarous men  Shou'd they again return I tremble still  Still feel their ruffian gripe nor can believe  I yet am safe tho' I no more behold them  PALADORE  They are fled far but ah thy side is pierc'd  Nor does this houseless solitude afford  The chance of timely succour  ALINDA  Heaven is just  For now I know you since it bids me die  Weeping for pardon at your injur'd knees  For I have basely wrong'd you  PALADORE  Wrong'd me How  All who have ever serv'd or lov'd that false one  As they bring back her irksome memory  I shou'd avoid in wisdom So confin'd  It is not in thy sphere to wake a thought  More than compassion for thy helpless sex  And aid my order binds to  ALINDA  Have but patience  Nor waste the few short moments fate allows me  To doubt my truth the seal of death is on it  You left the court on much supposed proof  Of her incontinence  PALADORE  Supposed proof  By Heaven I saw her in the fulsome twine  Of riotous dalliance with one she swore  That very noon a budding perjury  Excited but her loathing  ALINDA  At her window  I know you think you saw her  PALADORE  Think I saw her  Is there for visible objects better sense  Than sight to hold by  ALINDA  Oh most injur'd lady  My sullied lips wou'd but profane thy virtue  To say I know it spotless  PALADORE  Do not mock me  With hopes impossible I see her still  Her snowy veil and sparkling coronet  Peculiar in their form  ALINDA  By me were worn  While she and harmless thoughts slept sound together  Bireno's was the fraud my boundless love  Made me his instrument  PALADORE  Oh hold my brain  But one thing moreHow came he by that letter  Her picture mine  ALINDA  These too I found and gave him  By her for you intended 'Midst her notes  I found his title writ and trac'd the address  Stroke after stroke agreeing  PALADORE  Wretch fond wretch  Have I for this with viperous calumny  Traduc'd her virgin fame With desperate hand  Rais'd this sharp sword against my

suspicion my unwary tongue  Might publish his contrivance  PALADORE  How thy life  Inhuman dog Were these his ruffians then  I found thee struggling with  ALINDA  I thought they led me  By his especial care far from the city  Where he ordain'd I shou'd remain secure  To hide this swelling witness of my shame  My fatal passion bears him  PALADORE  Heaven defend me  ALINDA  There lies the bloody contract Oh forgive me  I have struggled hard to make this last confession  The icy grasp of death chills my shrunk heart  PALADORE  Wou'd I cou'd save thee  ALINDA  Say but you forgive me

and comely outside  To act so sad a deed  PALADORE  You wrong me shepherd  She fell by ruffians Pr'ythee call thy hinds  And for thy soul's sake do this courtesy  SHEPHERD  Good Sir detain me not I haste to the city  Where all our villagers flock to behold  A most strange sight and sad as it is strange  With their best speed my old limbs will be late  The sun goes down apace  PALADORE  Whate'er the sight  Respite thy curiosity for gold  Take this and give a covering to that corse  Gives a purse  I must away you shall hear further from me  Exit  SCENE VI  To the  SHEPHERD  at an opposite Entrance  RINALDO  SHEPHERD  He had a hard heart lady struck thee down  I wou'd not for the herds that graze these hills  Beyond my eyes not no nor for the wealth  Of all who throng the city I or mine  Shou'd answer for a sin like this at doom'sday  Oh if thy father lives what bitter tears  Will this misdeed wring from his watery eyes  Thou shalt not want what I can do for thee  I'll make thy bed with leaves and strew thee o'er  With herbs and flowers wild thyme and lavender  White lilies and the prime of all our fields  And for thy soul's peace till thy knell is toll'd  I'll number many an

perish  Most horribleKind shepherd answer quickly  Saw'st thou a youth clad in a shining robe  Of noble port wandering these tangled woods  SHEPHERD  Even such a one as you describe but now  Him of your question doubtless went from hence  And left with me in charge  RINALDO  No matter what  Know you the path he took which way his course  SHEPHERD  I follow'd him a little with my eye  And saw him wind round yonder shrubby hill  Then pass the row of olives  RINALDO  Leads it not  Strait to the city  SHEPHERD  As the falcon flies  RINALDO  Oh Fortune Guide his steps once more to Pavia  Else never ending misery awaits him  Exeunt severally  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  a Hall  LUCIO  an  OFFICER  OFFICER  THINK on the danger  LUCIO  Who sees only that  Will ne'er surmount it More than life I owe her  Adversity's hard hand had crush'd my hopes  Doom'd my sweet wife and infant family  To shameful beggary my affliction reach'd her  Can I forget her alldispensing bounty  That rais'd my soul from comfortless despair  That bad my cheerful house again receive me  Bless'd us with plentyIf I fall and save her  'Tis well I ask no nobler epitaph  OFFICER  There's virtue in your motive and your purpose  But how effect her rescue  LUCIO  Will you join us  OFFICER  Or why these questions  LUCIO  I dare trust your honour  The bond of soldiers Know then I command  And sought it with this hope her prison guard  I have sounded them they hate the cruel service  A little ere the fatal hour's approach  We mean to pass their unresisting force  Throw wide the iron gates and bear her safe  Beyond the danger of this bloody edict  OFFICER  It looks success may fortune second it  The throngs assembled to behold the sight  Will count for idle gazers and conceal  Your bold design till 'tis too late to twhart it  How brooks she her sad plight  LUCIO  With fortitude  So sweet so eventemper'd that her death  Seems but a phantom dress'd by Fancy's trick  To frighten children All her soul's employ'd  In minist'ring with softest piety  To her distracted father  OFFICER  There's a spectacle  Indeed heartrending Cast on the cold ground  He strews his head with ashes by the roots  Tears out his silver hair beats his poor breast  While the significant dumbness of his gesture  Beggars all power of words  LUCIO  Thou blind mischance  Stand neuter we shall cheer him presently  I'll to my station Keep thy sword conceal'd  Nor sheathe it drawn but in the villain's breast  That dare oppose us Be but firm and fear not  Exeunt severally  SCENE II  BIRENO  alone  By their description it was Paladore  The place the glittering robe his courage too  In so assailing them If their keen daggers  Left her enough of breath to tell the tale  She has no doubt told all and wing'd him back  To wreak his vengeance on me this way only  Can I be safe firm as he is and fearless  My ambush cuts him off and by his death  The full tide of my prosperous fortune flows  Never to ebb  SCENE III  To  BIRENO ASCANIO  Well the great period comes  No champion meets my challenge  ASCANIO  No not one  Fear puts the livery of conscience on  They cannot think one of your nobleness  Wou'd charge a lady falsely to the death  And few are the examples of success  Against conviction "true 'tis pitiful  "That one so fair so young of royal birth  "For the meer frailty of impulsive nature  "Should meet so sad a doom the law's to blame  "That bloodily enrolls a venial trespass  "With those o'ergrown and huge enormities  "That shake society" but they can no more  Than drop a tear or two and let her die  BIRENO  True she must die and the heartwounded king  Whose age already totters o'er the grave  Like a crush'd serpent but a little longer  Will drag his painful being Yet one fear  Sits like a boding raven o'er my breast  And flaps its heavy wing to damp my joy  ASCANIO  What fear can reach you now From Paladore  BIRENO  Perdition seize him yes But my good ruffians  Ere this I trust have sent to his account  That illstar'd Briton Doubly arm'd they wait him  Close by a brambled cavern he must pass  Returning hither Yet should he escape  It cannot beHeart reassume thy seat  But come the time draws onBear to the lists  My martial ensigns I must seem prepar'd  To oppose a danger that will never meet me  As be is going a servant delivers a paper Reads  The hand of Bernardine my trusty spy  Confusion rescue her Come back Ascanio  Fly to St Mark's collect the cohort there  Go place them instantly around the prison  Bid them disarm the guard that holds that place  And on their lives drive back the populace  I'll to HonoriasThese stout veterans  Will sweep the rabble like vile chaff before them  AwayA moment may be fatal to us  Exeunt severally  SCENE IV  a Prison  PRINCESS WOMEN  attending  PRINCESS  Nay dry these tearsThe aweful eve of death  Is but profan'd by shews of common sorrow  I have a triple armour round my heart  'Gainst all the shapes of terror yet it owns  The soft contagion of affection's drops  And melts at kindness Come this must not be  You Laura must be near me at the block  And help to disarray meWhat more tears  Stop them for shame I must have strangers else  For this last office When the axe has fallen  They have no further powerSave from disgrace  My poor remains and on your loves I charge you  When I am dead see that they touch me not  I have not been unmindful of your service  It is not muchThere were too many poor  Too many comfortless to leave me rich  But you will find a father in the king  And for my sake he will be bounteous to you  Retire and weep I dare not look upon you  Takes a picture from her breast  Thou dear dumb image of a form belov'd  Soul of my soul and precious even in death  A while be sensible Receive this sigh  And take my last farewel When thou shalt know  My truth and sufferings let not the sad tale  Blast the fair promise of thy noble youth  But with a sweet a sacred melancholy  Embalm the soft remembrance of my love  My father Oh angelic host support me  To bear this parting and death's pang is past  SCENE V  PRINCESS KING  I am indeed subduedTo see thee thus  KING  They would not let me die  PRINCESS  These few short hours  Alas how have they chang'd thee Murderous sorrow  Thy furrows sink more deep than age or time  Your cheek is ashy pale your eyes quite sunk  Will you not look upon me  KING  Oh no no  I came to give thee comfort to sustain thee  But looking on thee I shall weep again  And add my load of misery to thine  Yet teach me to be patient  PRINCESS  View me well  Nor think these tears fall for my own distress  The throbbings of my heart are for my father  'Tis apprehension makes death terrible  Cowards from weakness tremble guilt from conscience  But the firm bosom innocence invests  Knows it a fix'd inevitable end  Meets the pale guest nor startles at the encounter  KING  Thou wert my all a mote that vex'd thy eye  A thorn that raz'd thy finger snatch'd my thoughts  From every care but thee And thus to lose thee  PRINCESS  Oh were our being circumscrib'd by earth  This end indeed might shake my constancy  But faith apart think what bright evidence  Shines here within of immortality  Who has not felt the heavenly overflow  Of thought congenial to the eternal mind  Why are there tears of virtuous sympathy  Whence that coelestial fluid of the eye  That sheds such full such satisfied delight  But that the God of all benevolence  Thus gives a glimpse of blessedness to come  In joys refin'd from sense and far transcending  KING  What has old age to lose Is the poor remnant  Of life worn threadbare precious for itself  Can we be fond of pain and feebleness  No but our second spring our soul's renew'd  In our dear children there we cling to life  Mortality thy last thy heaviest curse  Bids us remain the mournful monument  The living tomb of all our comforts buried  Telling no more in our sepulchral sorrow  Than that they were and are not  PRINCESS  You must live  For sure the hour will come to see this cloud  Pass from my memory and the shame he merits  Fall on my base accuser  KING  Kneeling  Hear me Heaven  On the devoted murderer of my child  With tenfold visitation pour my sorrow  Let fear mistrust and horror ever haunt him  Slumber forsake his couch and joy his table  If he must reign Oh line his crown with thorns  Turn reverence to contempt the friend he trusts  Meet him for smiles with daggers war abroad  Treason at home pursue and harrass him  And may the steam that mounts from innocent blood  Make heavier the dire thunderbolt  Lanc'd from thy red right arm at last to crush him  PRINCESS  Spirit of peace on his distemper'd rage  Oh shed thy healing balm  A noise without  What mean these shouts  This wild tumultuous noise  To them an  ATTENDANT  ATTENDANT  Our prayers are heard  The guard gives way the massy bars are forc'd  And like delivering angels the rous'd people  Burst in to lead you from this den of horror  KING  Oh joy unhop'd Millions of blessings crown them  ATTENDANT  Led by the gallant Lucio they advance  KING  The tiger then may seek his prey in vain  My brave my generous people Hark they come  More noise  PRINCESS  Ah Sir retireYour heart must thank their purpose  Yet sure 'twere most unmeet for royalty  Whose sway and throne are hallow'd in obedience  To countenance this outrage Pray retire  KING  Yes I will go but Oh be swift my child  Nor dally with this blessed chance to save thee  Exit  SCENE VI  To her  LUCIO  his sword drawn  PRINCESS  Advancing  Your purpose quickly  LUCIO  Kneeling  Your deliverance lady  I owe a debt of boundless gratitude  And thus in part wou'd pay it Madam fly  The people all are yours a chosen band  Faithful and brave wait to conduct you hence  This smiling moment seiz'd may place you safe  Beyond the dreadful fate that threatens you  PRINCESS  But not beyond the reach of soul disgrace  The noble mind's worst fateI know thee Lucio  And thank thy kind intention Cou'd my flight  Restore my name to its original whiteness  Make palpable his lie who slanders me  I'd think thee thus commission'd from above  And welcome life with transport  LUCIO  Do I wake  When your good angel thus by me invites you  Is this a time to doubt Can you devote  That rosy youth that all commanding beauty  To voluntary death  PRINCESS  Were it a pain  Worse than the fear of cowards can conceive  I wou'd abide it Have I not endur'd  A greater horror heard myself proclaim'd  The thing I scorn to utter Shall I live  To bear about a disputable fame  Scattering the eternal seeds of strife and war  Over my country for the privilege  To draw a little transitory breath  And be consign'd to infamy or honour  But as the sword of conquest arbitrates  LUCIO  These are suggestions of your generous anger  And not your reasonOh most honour'd lady  Again behold me prostrate at your feet  Thus thus by me the people supplicate  Kneels  We have but one short moment left to save you  Seize it and live live to be still rever'd  Your country's pride her boast her ornament  PRINCESS  I am not to be chang'd But Oh my father  The good old king he wants a friend like thee  ASCANIO  Without  Force down the bridge Kill all who dare oppose  They fly stand fast  PRINCESS  He cuts my purpose short  SCENE VII  ASCANIO  with Soldiers to them  LUCIO  Oh death to all our hopes 'tis now too late  I cast thee from my hand vile instrument  Since she disdains thy service  Throws down his sword  ASCANIO  Seize that traitor  Quick bear him henceMadam I grieve to speak it  The herald to the temple porch has issued  For final proclamation  PRINCESS  Spare your sorrow  A shameful world disgrac'd by souls like thine  Turns grief to joy when noble natures leave it  Exit  Princess  guarded  SCENE VIII  To  ASCANIO BIRENO  BIRENO  Oh let me clasp thee This was worthy service  But for thy zeal the highrais'd edifice  So near complete had tumbled to the earth  And crush'd me in its fall  ASCANIO  Haste to the lists  A moment more consummates our design  And Fate itself may strive in vain to shake us  Exeunt  SCENE IX  The Lists in the middle of the stage A scaffold guard and executioner at the bottom Many spectators officers and senators preceding the Princess supported by women  Bireno  with  Ascanio  who bears his shield and sword Heralds with trumpets on the sides  OFFICER  Make room Fall back Let the procession pass  BIRENO  'Tis known why I stand here yet once again  And for the last time herald sound my challenge  Proceed none answer  Bireno'  s Trumpet sounds  PRINCESS  I wou'd have it so  You generous people who behold with horror  These gloomy preparations do not deem me  Cold and unthankful for my offer'd safety  Tho' I prefer'd this dire alternative  Before the tongue of slander struck my fame  The rude hand of affliction never touch'd me  Life had a thousand bonds to tie me to it  Young spirits royal birth fortune and greatness  But honour was the prop round which like stalks  Tender and weak these accessaries twin'd  When Calumny's sharp edge cut down that trunk  Then these poor tendrils lost their hue and wither'd  With that great ruin fell my happiness  I now stand on eternity's dark verge  Nor dare I to the God and Judge of Truth  Bring lips with falsehood fullied Of the offence  Cast on me by vile malice I am free  Even to abhorrence this to Heaven is known  My own heart and my accuser therefore boldly  And for your sakes will I arraign the law  Which thus has pass'd upon me  FIRST SENATOR  Gracious lady  If in this censure we too stand accus'd  Think we pronounc'd but did not make the law  And let my bleeding heart bear witness for me  I wou'd lay down the dearest thing I own  To save you from the forfeit  PRINCESS  Good my Lord  All forms of justice have been well observ'd  My blame lights on the law not on your office  Which you with truth and mercy minister  But let these mute spectators mark my counsel  Fall at the king's feet clasp the senate's knees  And pray them they wipe out clear from their rolls  This more than cruel edict else be sure  From every roof there hangs a dangerous sword  Hangs by a thread which each dark hand may drop  To pierce and sever nature's dearest ties  She who profanes her honor's sanctity  Upbraided by her heart by her own sex  Shun'd or neglected nay held cheap and vile  Even to the loathing of the lover's sense  Who wrought her easy nature to transgress  These are sharp penalties but added death  Turns the clear stream of justice into blood  And makes such law more curs'd than anarchy  Forget not my example let me perish  But if you pluck your safety from my ruin  I shall not die in vain FarewelLead on  Princess  goes toward the Scaffold a Trumpet sounds  FIRST SENATOR  Hold on your lives  BIRENO  What means that trumpet's voice  It sounds a shrill alarm  SCENE X  To them a  SQUIRE  SQUIRE  Arrest your sentence  I come in the name of one who hears with horror  This barbarous process to proclaim the accuser  Of that most innocent and royal lady  A slanderer and villain who accepts  Her just defence and by the law of arms  Throws down this gage and claims the combat for her  BIRENO  Take it Ascanio Bid your knight appear  If such his order for to none beneath  Am I thus bound to answer Speak his titles  SQUIRE  He wills not I reveal him but suffice it  He has a name in arms that will not shame  The noble cause he fights for  BIRENO  Bid him enter  My shield and sword Say I am deck'd to meet him  Exit  Squire  Some rash adventurer prodigal of life  Brib'd by her father's gold to grace her fall  And add an easy trophy to my banners  Confusion Paladore  SCENE XI  To them  PALADORE  PRINCESS  'Tis he 'tis he  Then life thou art welcome  A loud Murmur among the People  BIRENO  Marshal do your office  Furies and hellKeep order in the lists  Silence that uproar  PALADORE  Yes behold me villain  I have thee in the toils thou can'st not scape me  But Oh most wrong'd and heavenly excellence  To the  Princess  How shall I plead for pardonCan the abuse  Of his deep craft and devilish artifice  Fooling my nature's plainness blanch my cheek  From the deep shame that my too easy faith  Combin'd with hell against thee  PRINCESS  Rise my soldier  Though yet I know not by what subtle practice  Thy nobleness was wrought on nor the means  That since reveal'd his fraud praise be to Heaven  Thy presence plucks my honour from the grave  Thou liv'st thou know'st my truth thou wilt avenge me  PALADORE  Avenge theeYesDid his righthand grasp thunder  Did yelling furies combat on his side  Pal'd in with circling fires I wou'd assail him  Nor cast a look to Fortune for the event  BIRENO  Presumptuous Briton Think not that bold mien  A wanton's favour or thy threats have power  To shrink the finews of a soldier's arm  PALADORE  A soldier's arm Thou double murderer  Assassin in thy intention and in act  But ere my falchion cleave thy treacherous breast  I will divulge theeBring that russian forth  One of  Alinda  's murderers is brought out  Two hellhounds such as this he set upon me  One fell beneath my sword that wretch I spar'd  Kneeling for mercy let your justice doom him  Look you amaz'd Peruse that paper Lords  His compact for the blood of a fair minion  He taught to sin and made her wages death  Ha Does it shake thee See Alinda's form  Thy panting image mangled in her side  Stalks from her sanguine bed and ghastly smiles  To aid the prowess of this dauntless soldier  BIRENO  Aside  Destruction All's reveal'd  ASCANIO  to  BIRENO  What turn'd to stone  Droop not for shameBe quick retort the charge  BIRENO  All false as hell And thouDefend thyself  Nor blast me thus with thy detested presence  This to thy heart  Fight  Bireno  falls  PALADORE  Oh impotence of guilt  An infant's lath had fell'd him Villain die  And know thy shame and the deep wound that wriths thee  Are but a feeble earnest of the pangs  Reserv'd beneath for giant crimes like thine  PRINCESS  Haste to the King proclaim this bless'd event  BIRENO  Perfidious chance Caught in my own device  AccursedHa they drag me tear meOh  Dies  PRINCESS  I have a thousand things to ask to hear  But Oh the joy to see thee thus again  To owe my life my honour to thy love  These tears these rapturous tears let them speak for me  PALADORE  I cou'd endure the malice of my fate  But this full tide of such excessive bliss  Sure 'tis illusion all It quite transports me  When I have borne thee from this scene of horror  Perhaps I may grow calm and talk with reason  SCENE XII  and last  To them  KING LUCIO  c  KING  Where is she Let me strain her to my heart  They cannot part us now my joy my comfort  Thou generous youth How can my o'erflowing soul  Find words to thank theeWords Poor recompense  Here I invest thee with the forfeit lands  The wealth and honours of that prostrate traitor  This too is littlethen receive her hand  Due to thy love thy courage and thy virtue  And joys unutterable crown your union  END OF THE FIFTH ACT  PROLOGUE to the LAW of LOMBARDY  Written by the AUTHOR  Spoken by Mr FARREN  HARD is the task in modern days to choose  Congenial subjects for the tragic muse  The historian's page the fertile epic store  Were known and ransack'd centuries before  Like luscious gardens unenclos'd they lay  To ev'ry saunt'ring bard an easy prey  They enter'd and as taste impell'd they fed  On Homer some and some on Hollingshead  From loftiest numbers or from humblest prose  As each conspir'd the artless structures rose  Thus one great labour of their work was o'er  They found a fable and they fought no more  Careless were they of action place or time  Whose only toil was dialogue and rhyme  "Rules which the rigid Stagyrite devis'd  "Our fathers knew not or if known despis'd  Whilst side by side were mingled in the scene  A laughing rustic and a weeping queen  Space was obedient to the boundless piece  That op'd in Mexico and clos'd in Greece  Then thick with plots the crowded tale was sown  'Till the divided bosom felt for none  "They fear'd no censures of a frowning pit  "That judg'd as loosely as the authors writ"  But we who posted in time's tardy rear  Before a learn'd tribunal now appear  With anxious art a fable must design  Where probability and interest join  Where time and place and action all agree  To violate no sacred unity  And thus each candid critic must confess  The labour greater and indulgence less  When such the task the wonder is to meet  Not many pieces bad but one complete  Nor let presumptious poets fondly claim  From rules exemption by great Shakespeare's name  Though comets move with wild excentric force  Yet humbler planets keep their stated course  But now a bard who touch'd your hearts before  Again salutes you from a neighbouring shore  Fir'd by the applause you gave his early lays  He stands again a candidate for praise  Nor from your former favour dares foresee  To worthless strains a partial destiny  But if his virgin palm was fairly won  And this next course with equal vigour's run  Now join to bind his fresher laurels on  He fears no jaundic'd rival's envious  reath  The hands which twin'd shall still preserve the wreath  EPILOGUE to the LAW of LOMBARDY  Written by the AUTHOR  Spoken by Miss YOUNGE  OF all the Gothic laws I ever heard  This Lombard Law was sure the most absurd  What could the monsters mean to make us die  But for a little harmless gallantry  Were such a barbarous custom now in fashion  Good Lord it would unpeople half the nation  Scaffolds on scaffolds now the streets would fill  As signposts did before the pavingbill  Were British lawmakers such rigorous churls  They'd hardly leave a head to wear false curls  Besides what champion now would risque his life  To gain what most men shudder ata wife  Instead of arm'd knights at trumpet's summons  Commend me to our proctors and the Commons  There though we lose our husbands and our fame  We get our portion and a maiden name  And if her fortune and her charms remain  Then Miss may wedand be divorc'd again  Yet though these frolics have of late been common  Lay not the blame entirely on weak woman  The careless mate his rival recommends  We find him 'midst his own obliging friends  Some swain who swears he lives but in our eyes  And plies us with such cunning flatteries  That spouse neglecting us and lover wooing  One strives and t'other leads us to our ruin  So if weak ladies chance to go astray  Their lords methinks are more in fault than they  The goal of marriage reach'd the men lie down  Like weary racers when the prize is won  Mere catching us alone their care engages  The nets they spread but never mind the cages  The married gamester more delight can find  In "Seven's the main" than all dear womankind  Acteon wedded to our voice prefers  The sweeter music of his yelping ours  While the dull sot who his six bottles boasts  Thinks women good for nothingbut for toasts  Thus slighted for the glass the hound the die  Our pride steps in and to revenge we fly  One obvious method only can preserve us  Strive by your own attentions to deserve us  And now as formerly be sure you'll prove  Contempt will meet contempt as love meets love  Books printed for T Evans in the Strand  BRAGANZA a
