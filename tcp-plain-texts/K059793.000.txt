 THE FORTUNES AND MISFORTUNES Of the FAMOUS  Moll Flanders  c  Who was Born in NEWGATE and during a Life of continu'd Variety for Threescore Years besides her Childhood was Twelve Year a  Whore  five times a  Wife  whereof once to her own Brother Twelve Year a  Thief  Eight Year a Transported  Felon  in  Virginia  at last grew  Rich  liv'd  Honest  and died a  Penitent    Written from her own  MEMORANDUMS    LONDON  Printed for and Sold by W CHETWOOD at  Cato'sHead  in  Russelstreet CoventGarden  and T EDLING at the  Prince  's  Arms  overagainst  ExerterChange  in the  Strand  MDDCXXI  THE PREFACE  _THE World is so taken up of late with Novels and Romances that it will be hard for a private History to be taken for Genuine where the Names and other Circumstances of the Person are concealed and on this Account we must be content to leave the Reader to pass his own Opinion upon the ensuing Sheets and take it just as he pleases  THE Author is here suppos'd to be writing her own History and in the very beginning of her Account she gives the Reasons why she thinks fit to conceal her true Name after which there is no Occasion to say any more about that  IT is true that the original of this Story is put into new Words and the Stile of the famous Lady we here speak of is a little alter'd particularly she is made to tell her own Tale in modester Words than she told it at first the Copy which came first to Hand having been written in Language more like one still in  Newgate  than one grown Penitent and Humble as she afterwards pretends to be  THE Pen employ'd in finishing her Story and making it what you now see it to be has had no little difficulty to put it into a Dress fit to be seen and to make it speak Language fit to be read When a Woman debauch'd from her Youth nay even being the Offspring of Debauchery and Vice comes to give an Account of all her vicious Practises and even to descend to the particular Occasions and Circumstances by which she first became wicked and of all the progression of Crime which she run through in threescore Year an Author must be hard  put to it to wrap it up so clean as not to give room especially for vitious Readers to turn it to his Disadvantage  ALL possible Care however has been taken to give no leud Ideas no immodest Turns in the new dressing up this Story no not to the worst parts of her Expressions to this Purpose some of the vicious part of her Life which cou'd not be modestly told is quite left out and several other Parts are very much shortn'd what is left 'tis hop'd will not offend the chastest Reader or the modestest Hearer and as the best use is made even of the worst Story the Moral 'tis hop'd will keep the Reader serious even where the Story might incline him to be otherwise To give the History of a wicked Life repented of necessarily requires that the wick'd Part should be made as wicked as the real History of it will bear to illustrate and give a Beauty to the Penitent part which is certainly the best and brightest if related with equal Spirit and Life  IT is suggested there cannot be the same Life the same Brightness and Beauty in relateing the penitent Part as is in the criminal Part If there is any Truth in that Suggestion I must be allow'd to say 'tis because there is not the same taste and relish in the Reading and indeed it is too true that the difference lyes not in the real worth of the Subject so much as in the Gust and Palate of the Reader  BUT as this Work is chiefly recommended to those who know how to Read it and how to make the good Uses of it which the Story all along recommends to them so it is to be hop'd that such Readers will be much more pleas'd with the Moral than the Fable with the Application than with the Relation and with the End of the Writer than with the Life of the Person written of  THERE is in this Story abundance of delightful Incidents and all of them usefully apply'd There is an agreeable turn  Artfully given them in the relating that naturally Instructs the Reader either one way or other The first part of her leud Life with the young Gentleman at  Colchester  has so many happy Turns given it to expose the Crime and warn all whose Circumstances are adapted to it of the ruinious End of such things and the foolish Thoughtless and abhorr'd Conduct of both the Parties that it abundantly attones for all the lively Discription she gives of her Folly and Wickedness  THE Repentance of her Lover at the  Bath  and how brought by the just alarm of his fit of Sickness to abandon her the just Caution given there against even the lawful Intimacies of the dearest Friends and how unable they are to preserve the most solemn Resolutions of Vertue without divine Assistance there are Parts which to a just Discernment will appear to have more real Beauty in them than all the amorous Chain of Story which introduces it  IN a Word as the whole Relation is carefully garbl'd of all the Levity and Looseness that was in it So it is all applied and with the utmost care to vertuous and religious Uses None can without being guilty of manifest Injustice cast any Reproach upon it or upon our Design in publishing it  THE Advocates for the Stage have in all Ages made this the great Argument to persuade People that their Plays are useful and that they ought to be allow'd in the most civilz'd and in the most religious Government Namely That they are applyed to vertuous Purposes and that by the most lively Representations they fail not to recommend Vertue and generous Principles and to discourage and expose all sorts of Vice and Corruption of Manners and were it true that they did so and that they constantly adhered to that Rule as the Test of their acting on the  Theatre  much might be said in their Favour  THROUGHOUT the infinite variety of this Book this Fundamental is most strictly ad+hered  to there is not a wicked Action in any Part of it but is first and last rendered Unhappy and Unfortunate There is not a superlative Villain brought upon the Stage but either he is brought to an unhappy End or brought to be a Penitent There is not an ill thing mentio'd but it is condemn'd even in the Relation nor a vertuous just Thing but it carries its Praise along with it What can more exactly answer the Rule laid down to recommend even those Representations of things which have so many other just Objections lying against them Namely of Example of bad Company obscene Language and the like  UPON this Foundation this Book is recommended to the Reader as a Work from every part of which something may be learned and some just and religious Inference is drawn by which the Reader will have something of Instruction if he pleases to make use of it  ALL the Exploits of this Lady of Fame in her Depredations upon Mankind stand  as so many warnings to honest People to beware of them intimating to them by what Methods innocent People are drawn in plunder'd and robb'd and by Consequence how to avoid them Her robbing a little innocent Child dress'd fine by the vanity of the Mother to go to the DancingSchool is a good Memento to such People hereafter as is likewise her picking the GoldWatch from the young Ladies side in the  Park    HER getting a parcel from a hairbrained Wench at the Coaches in St  Johnstreet  her Booty made at the Fire and again at  Harwich  all give us excellent Warnings in such Cases to be more present to ourselves in sudden Surprizes of every Sort  HER application to a sober Life and industrious Management at last in  Virginia  with her Transported Spouse is a Story fruitful of Instruction to all the unfortunate Creatures who are oblig'd to seek their Reestablishment abroad whether by the Misery  of Transportation or other Disaster letting them know that Diligence and Application have their due Encouragement even in the remotest Parts of the World and that no Case can be so low so despicable or so empty of Prospect but that an unwearied Industry will go a great way to deliver us from it will in time raise the meanest Creature to appear again in the World and give him a new Cast for his Life  THESE are a few of the serious Inferences which we are led by the Hand to in this Book and these are fully sufficient to Justifie any Man in recommending it to the World and much more to Justifie the Publication of it  THERE are two of the most beautiful Parts still behind which this Story gives some Idea of and lets us into the Parts of them but they are either of them too long to be brought into the same Volume and indeed are  as I may call them  whole Volumes of themselves  viz  The Life of her Governess as she calls her who had run  thro' it seems in a few Years all the eminent degrees of a Gentlewoman a Whore and a Bawd a Midwife and a Midwifekeeper as  they are call'd  a Pawnbroker a Childtaker a Receiver of Thieves and of Thieves purchase that is to say of stolen Goods and in a Word her self a Thief a Breeder up of Thieves and the like and yet at last a Penitent  THE second is the Life of her Transported Husband a Highwayman who it seems liv'd a twelve Years Life of successful Villany upon the Road and even at last came off so well as to be a Voluntier Transport not a Convict and in whose Life there is an incredible Variety  BUT as I have said these are things too long to bring in here so neither can I make a Promise of their coming out by themselves  WE cannot say indeed that this History is carried on quite to the End of the Life of this famous  Moll Flanders  as she calls her self for no Body can write their own Life to the full End of it unless they can write  it after they are dead but her Husband's Life being written by a third Hand gives a full Account of them both how long they liv'd together in that Country and how they came both to  England  again after about eight Year in which time they were grown very Rich and where she liv'd it seems to be very old but was not so extraordinary a Penitent as she was at first it seems only that indeed she always spoke with abhorence of her former Life and of every Part of it  IN her last Scene at  Maryland  and  Virginia  many pleasant things happen'd which makes that part of her Life very agreeable but they are not told with the same Elegancy as those accounted for by herself so it is still to the more Advantage that we break off here  THE HISTORY AND MISFORTUNES Of the FAMOUS  Moll Flanders  c  _MY True Name is so well known in the Records or Registers at  Newgate  and in the  OldBaily  and there are some things of such Consequence still depending there relating to my particular Conduct that it is not to be expected I should set my Name or the Account of my Family to this Work perhaps after my Death it may be better known at present it would not be proper no not tho' a general Pardon should be issued even without Exceptions and reserve of Persons or Crimes  IT is enough to tell you that as some of my worst Comrades▪ who are out of the Way of doing me Harm having gone out of the World by the Steps▪ and the String as I often expected to go know me by the Name of  Moll Flanders  so you may give me leave to speak of myself under that Name till I dare own who I have been as well as who I am  I HAVE been told that in one of our Neighbour Nations whether it be in  France  or where else I know not they have an Order from the King that when any Criminal is condemn'd either to Die or to the Gallies or to be Transported if they leave any Children as such are generally unprovided for by the Poverty or Forfeiture of their Parents so they are immediately taken into the Care of the Government and put into an Hospital call'd the  House  of  Orphans  where they are Bred up Cloath'd Fed Taught and when fit to go out are plac'd out to Trades or to Services so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest industrious Behaviour  HAD this been the Custom in our Country I had not been left a poor desolate Girl without Friends without Cloaths without Help or Helper in the World as was my Fate and by which I was not only expos'd to very great Distresses even before I was capable either of Understanding my Case or how to Amend it nor brought into a Course of Life which was not only scandalous in itself but which in its ordinary Course tended to the swift Destruction both of Soul and Body  BUT the Case was otherwise here my Mother was convicted of Felony for a certain petty Theft scarce worth naming  viz  Having  an opportunity of borrowing three Pieces of fine  Holland  of a certain Draper in  Cheapside  The Circumstances are too long to repeat and I have heard them related so many Ways that I can scarce be certain which is the right Account  HOWEVER it was this they all agree in that my Mother pleaded her Belly and being found quick with Child she was respited for about seven Months in which time having brought me into the World and being about again she was call'd Down as they term it to her former Judgment but obtain'd the Favour of being Transported to the Plantations and left me about Half a Year old and in bad Hands you may be sure  THIS is too near the first Hours of my Life for me to relate any thing of myself but by hearsay 'tis enough to mention that as I was born in such an unhappy Place I had no Parish to have Recourse to for my Nourishment in my Infancy nor can I give the least Account how I was kept alive other than that as I have been told some Relation of my Mothers took me away for a while as a Nurse but at whose Expence or by whose Direction I know nothing at all of it  THE first account that I can Recollect or could ever learn of myself was that I had wandred among a Crew of those People they call  Gypsies  or  Egyptians  but I believe it was but a very little while that I had been among them for I had not had my Skin discolour'd or blacken'd as they do very young to all the Children they carry about with them nor can I tell how I came among them or how I got from them  IT was at  Colchester  in  Essex  that those People left me and I have a Notion in my Head that I left them there that is that I hid myself and  wou'd not go any farther with them but I am not able to be particular in that Account only this I remember that being taken up by some of the Parish Officers of  Colchester  I gave an Account that I came into the Town with the  Gypsies  but that I would not go any farther with them and that so they had left me but whether they were gone that I knew not nor could they expect it of me for tho' they sent round the Country to enquire after them it seems they could not be found  I WAS now in a Way to be provided for for tho' I was not a Parish Charge upon this or that part of the Town by Law yet as my Case came to be known and that I was too young to do any Work being not above three Years old Compassion mov'd the Magistrates of the Town to order some Care to be taken of me and I became one of their own as much as if I had been born in the Place  IN the Provision they made for me it was my good hap to be put to Nurse as they call it to a Woman who was indeed Poor but had been in better Circumstances and who got a little Livelihood by taking such as I was suppos'd to be and keeping them with all Necessaries till they were at a certain Age in which it might be suppos'd they might go to Service or get their own Bread  THIS Woman had also had a little School which she kept to teach Children to Read and to Work and having as I have said liv'd before that in good Fashion she bred up the Children she took with a great deal of Art as well as with a great deal of Care  BUT that which was worth all the rest she bred them up very Religiously▪ being herself a very sober pious Woman Very Housewifly and Clean and Very Mannerly and with good Behaviour So that in a Word excepting a plain Diet course Lodging and mean Cloths we were brought up as Mannerly and as Genteely as if we had been at the DancingSchool  I WAS continu'd here till I was eight years Old when I was terrified with News that the Magistrates as I think they call'd them had order'd that I should go to Service I was able to do but very little Service where ever I was to go except it was to run of Errands and be a Druge to some CookMaid and this they told me of often which put me into a great Fright for I had a thorough Aversion to going to Service as they call'd it that is to be a Servant tho' I was so young and I told my Nurse as we call'd her that I believ'd I could get my Living without going to Service if she pleas'd to let me for she had Taught me to Work with my Needle and Spin Worsted which is the chief Trade of that City and I told her that if she wou'd keep me I wou'd Work for her and I would Work very hard  I talk'd to her almost every Day of Working hard And in short I did nothing but Work and Cry all Day which griev'd the good kind Woman so much that at last she began to be concern'd for me for she lov'd me very well  ONE Day after this as she came into the Room were all we poor Children were at Work she sat down just over against me not in her usual Place as Mistress but as if she set herself on purpose to observe me and see me Work I was doing something she had set me to as I remember  it was Marking some Shirts which she had taken to Make and after a while she began to Talk to me Thou foolish Child says she thou art always Crying for I was Crying then prethee What doest Cry for because they will take me away  says I  and put me to Service and I can't Work HouseWork well Child says she but tho' you can't Work HouseWork as you call it you will learn it in time and they won't put you to hard Things at first yes they will says I and if I can't do it they will Beat me and the Maids will Beat me to make me do great Work and I am but a little Girl and I can't do it and then I cry'd again till I could not speak any more to her  THIS mov'd my good Motherly Nurse so that she from that time resolv'd I should not go to Service yet so she bid me not Cry and she wou'd speak to Mr  Mayor  and I should not go to Service till I was bigger  WELL this did not Satisfie me for to think of going to Service was such a frightful Thing to me that if she had assur'd me I should not have gone till I was years old it wou'd have been the same to me I shou'd have cry'd I believe all the time with the very Apprension of its being to be so at last  WHEN she saw that I was not pacify'd yet she began to be angry with me and what wou'd you have  says she  don't I tell you that you shall not go to Service till you are bigger Ay says I but then I must go at last why what said she is the Girl mad what would you be a Gentlewoman Yes  says I  and cry'd heartily till I roar'd out again  THIS set the old Gentlewoman a Laughing at me as you may be sure it would Well Madam forsooth says she  Gibing at me  you would be a Gentlewoman and pray how will you come to be a Gentlewoman what will you do it by your Fingers Ends  YES  says I again  very innocently  WHY what can you Earn  says she  what can you get at your Work  THREEPence  said I  when I Spin and  d  when I Work plain Work  ALAS poor Gentlewoman  said she again  Laughing what will that do for thee  IT will keep me  says I  if you will let me live with you and this  I said  in such a poor petitioning Tone that it made the poor Womans Heart yearn to me as she told me afterwards  BUT  says she  that will not keep you and buy you Cloths too and who must buy the little Gentlewoman Cloths  says she  and smil'd all the while at me  I will Work Harder then  says I  and you shall have it all  POOR Child it won't keep you  says she  it will hardly keep you in Victuals  THEN I will have no Victuals  says I  again very Innocently let me but live with you  WHY can you live without Victuals  says she  yes  again says I  very much like a Child you may be sure and still I cry'd heartily  I HAD no Policy in all this you may easily see it was all Nature but it was joyn'd with so much Innocence and so much Passion That in short it set the good Motherly Creature a weeping too and she cry'd at last as fast as I did and then took me and led me out of the teaching Room  come  says she  you shan't go to Service you shall live with me and this pacify'd me for the present  SOMETIME after this she going to wait on the  Mayor  and talking of such things as belong'd to her Business at last my Story came up and my good Nurse told Mr  Mayor  the whole Tale He was so pleas'd with it that he would call his Lady and his two Daughters to hear it and it made Mirth enough among them you may be sure  HOWEVER not a Week had pass'd over but on a suddain comes Mrs  Mayoress  and her two Daughters to the House to see my old Nurse and to see her School and the Children When they had look'd about them a little Well Mrs says the  Mayoress  to my Nurse and pray which is the little Lass that intends to be a Gentlewoman I heard her and I was terrible frighted at first tho' I did not know why neither but Mrs  Mayoress  comes up to me Well Miss says she And what are you at Work upon The Word Miss was a Language that had hardly been heard of in our School and I wondred what sad Name it was she call'd me However I stood up made a Curtsy and she took my Work out of my Hand look'd on it and said it was very well then she took up one of my Hands nay says she the Child may come to be a Gentlewoman for ought any body knows she has a Gentlewoman's Hand says she this pleas'd me mightily you may be sure but Mrs  Mayoress  did not stop there but giving me my Work again she put her Hand in her Pocket gave me a Shilling and bid me mind my Work and learn to Work well and I might be a Gentlewoman for ought she knew  NOW all this while my good old Nurse Mrs  Mayoress  and all the rest of them did not understand me at all for they meant one Sort of thing by the Word Gentlewoman and I meant quite another for alas all I understood by being a Gentlewoman was to be able to Work for myself and get enough to keep me without that terrible Bugbear  going to Service  whereas they meant to live Great Rich and High and I know not what  WELL after Mrs  Mayoress  was gone her two Daughters came in and they call'd for the Gentlewoman too and they talk'd a long while to me and I answer'd them in my Innocent way but always if they ask'd me whether I resolv'd to be a Gentlewoman I answer'd YES At last one of them ask'd me what a Gentlewoman was that puzzel'd me much but however I explain'd myself negatively that it was one that did not go to Service to do HouseWork they were pleas'd to be familiar me and lik'd my little Prattle to them which it seems was agreeable enough to them and they gave me Money too  AS for my Money I gave it all to my Mistress Nurse as I call'd her and told her she should have all I got for myself when I was a Gentlewoman as well as now by this and some other of my talk my old Tutress began to understand me about what I meant by being a Gentlewoman and that I understood by it to no more than to be able to get my Bread by my own Work and at last she ask'd me whether it was not so  I told her  yes  and insisted on it that to do so was to be a Gentlewoman for says I there is such a one naming a Woman that mended Lace and wash'd the Ladies Lac'dheads she  says I  is a Gentlewoman and they call her Madam  POOR Child says my good old Nurse you may soon be such a Gentlewoman as that for she is a Person of ill Fame and has had two or three Bastards  I DID not understand any thing of that but I answer'd I am sure they call her Madam and she does not go to Service nor do HouseWork and therefore I insisted that she was a Gentlewoman and I would be such a Gentlewoman as that  THE Ladies were told all this again to be sure and they made themselves Merry with it and every now and then the young Ladies Mr  Mayor's  Daughters would come and see me and ask where the little Gentlewoman was which made me not a little Proud of myself  THIS held a great while and I was often visited by these young Ladies and sometimes they brought others with them so that I was known by it almost all over the Town  I WAS now about ten Years old and began to look a little Womanish for I was mighty Grave and Humble very Mannerly and as I had often heard the Ladies say I was Pretty and would be a very handsome Woman so you may be sure that hearing them say so made me not a little Proud however that Pride had no ill effect upon me yet only as they often gave me Money and I gave it my old Nurse she  honest Woman  was so just to me as to lay it all out again for me and gave me HeadDresses and Linnen and Gloves and Ribbons and I went very Neat and always Clean for that I would do and if I had Rags on I would always be Clean or else I would dabble them in Water myself but  I say  my good Nurse when I had Money given me very honestly laid it out for me and would always tell the Ladies this  or that was bought with their Money and this made them oftentimes give me more Till at last I was indeed call'd upon by the Magistrates as I understood it to go out to Service but then I was come to be so good a Workwoman myself and the Ladies were so kind to me that it was plain I could maintain myself that is to say I could Earn as much for my Nurse as she was able by it to keep me so she told them that if they would give her leave she would keep the Gentlewoman as she call'd me to be her Assistant and teach the Children which I was very well able to do for I was very nimble at my Work and had a good Hand with my Needle though I was yet very young  BUT the kindness of the Ladies of the Town did not End here for when they came to understand that I was no more maintain'd by the publick Allowance as before they gave me Money oftner than formerly and as I grew up they brought me Work to do for them such as Linnen to Make and Laces to Mend and Heads to Dress up and not only paid me for doing them but even taught me how to do them so that now I was a Gntlewoman indeed as I understood that Word and as I desir'd to be for by that time I was twelve Years old I not only found myself Cloaths and paid my Nurse for my keeping but got Money in my Pocket too beforehand  THE Ladies also gave me Cloaths frequently of their own or their Childrens some Stockings some Petticoats some Gowns some one thing some another and these my old Woman Managed for me like a meer Mother and kept them for me oblig'd me to Mend them and turn them and twist them to the best Advantage for she was a rare HouseWife  AT last one of the Ladies took so much Fancy to me that she would have me Home to her House for a Month she said to be among her Daughters  NOW tho' this was exceeding kind in her yet as my old good Woman said to her unless she resolv'd to keep me for good and all she would do the little Gentlewoman more harm then good Well says the Lady that's true and therefore I'll only take her Home for a Week then that I may see how my Daughters and she agree together and how I like her Temper and then I'll tell you more and in the mean time if any Body comes to see her as they us'd to do you may only tell them you have sent her out to my House  THIS was prudently manag'd enough and I went to the Ladies House but I was so pleas'd there with the young Ladies and they so pleas'd with me that I had enough to do to come away and they were as unwilling to part with me  HOWEVER I did come away and liv'd almost a Year more with my honest old Woman and began now to be very helpful to her for I was almost fourteen Years old was tall of my Age and look'd a little Womanish but I had such a Tast of Genteel living at the Ladies House that I was not so easie in my old Quarters as I us'd to be and I thought it was fine to be a Gentlewoman indeed for I had quite other Notions of a Gentlewoman now than I had before and as I thought I say that it was fine to be a Gentlewoman so I lov'd to be among Gentlewomen and therefore I long'd to be there again  ABOUT the Time that I was fourteen Years and a quarter Old my good old Nurse Mother I ought rather to call her fell Sick and Dyed I was then in a sad Condition indeed for as there is  no great Bustle in putting an end to a Poor bodies Family when once they are carried to the Grave so the poor good Woman being Buried the Parish Children she kept were immediately remov'd by the ChurchWardens the School was at an End and the Children of it had no more to do but just stay at Home till they were sent some where else and as for what she left her Daughter a married Woman with six or seven Children came and swept it all away at once and removing the Goods they had no more to say to me than to Jest with me and tell me that the little Gentlewoman might set up for her self if she pleas'd  I was frighted out of my Wits almost and knew not what to do for I was as it were turn'd out of Doors to the wide World and that which was still worse the old honest Woman had two and twenty Shillings of mine in her Hand which was all the Estate the little Gentlewoman had in the World and when I ask'd the Daughter for it she huft me and laught at me and told me she had nothing to do with it  IT was true the good poor Woman had told her Daughter of it and that it lay in such a Place that it was the Child's Money and had call'd once or twice for me to give it me but I was unhappily out of the way some where or other and when I came back she was past being in a Condition to speak of it However the Daughter was so Honest afterward as to give it me tho' at first she us'd me Cruelly about it  NOW was I a poor Gentlewoman indeed and I was just that very Night to be turn'd into the wide World for the Daughter remov'd all the Goods and I had not so much as a Lodging to go to or a bit of Bread to Eat But it seems some of  the Neighbours who had known my Circumstances took so much Compassion of me as to acquaint the Lady in whose Family I had been a Week as I mention'd above and immediately she sent her Maid to fetch me away and two of her Daughters came with the Maid tho' unsent so I went with them Bag and Baggage and with a glad Heart you may be sure The fright of my Condition had made such an Impression upon me that I did not want now to be a Gentlewoman but was very willing to be a Servant and that any kind of Servant they thought fit to have me be  BUT my new generous Mistress for she exceeded the good Woman I was with before in every Thing as well as in the matter of Estate I say in every Thing except Honesty and for that tho this was a Lady most exactly Just yet I must not forget to say on all Occasions that the First tho Poor was as uprightly Honest as it was possible for any One to be  I was no sooner carried away as I have said by this good Gentlewoman but the first Lady  that is to say  the  Mayoress  that was sent her two Daughters to take Care of me and another Family which had taken Notice of me when I was the little Gentlewoman and had given me Work to do sent for me after her so that I was mightily made of as we say nay and they were not a little Angry especially Madam the  Mayoress  that her Friend had taken me away from her as she call'd it for as she said I was Her by Right she having been the first that took any Notice of me but they that had me wou'd no part with me and as for me tho' I shou'd have been very well Treated with any of the other yet I could not be better than where I was  HERE I continu'd till I was between and Years old and here I had all the Advantages for my Education that could be imagin'd the Lady had Masters home to the House to teach her Daughters to Dance and to speak  French  and to Write and others to teach them Musick and as I was always with them I learn'd as fast as they and tho' the Masters were not appointed to teach me yet I learn'd by Imitation and enquiry all that they learn'd by Instruction and Direction So that in short I learn'd to Dance and speak  French  as well as any of them and to Sing much better for I had a better Voice than any of them I could not so readily come at playing on the Harpsicord or Spinnet because I had no Instrument of my own to Practice on and could only come at theirs in the intervals when they left it which was uncertain but yet I learn'd tollerably well too and the young Ladies at length got two Instruments that is to say a Harpsicord and a Spinnet too and then they Taught me themselves But as to Dancing they could hardly help my learning Country Dances because they always wanted me to make up even Number and on the other Hand they were as heartily willing to learn me every thing that they had been Taught themselves as I could be to take the Learning  BY this Means I had as I have said above all the Advantages of Education that I could have had if I had been as much a Gentlewoman as they were with whom I liv'd and in some things I had the Advantage of my Ladies tho' they were my Superiors but they were all the Gifts of Nature and which all their Fortunes could not furnish First I was apparently Handsomer than  any of them Secondly I was better shap'd and Thirdly I Sung better by which I mean I had a better Voice in all which you will I hope allow me to say I do not speak my own Conceit of myself but the Opinion of all that knew the Family  I HAD with all these the common Vanity of my Sex  viz  That being really taken for very Handsome or if you please for a great Beauty I very well knew it and had as good an Opinion of myself as any body else could have of me and particularly I lov'd to hear any body speak of it which could not but happen to me sometimes and was a great Satisfaction to me  THUS far I have had a smooth Story to tell of myself and in all this Part of my Life I not only had the Reputation of living in a very good Family and a Family Noted and Respected every where for Vertue and Sobriety and for every valluable Thing but I had the Character too of a very sober modest and vertuous young Woman and such I had always been neither had I yet any occasion to think of any thing else or to know what a Temptation to Wickedness meant  BUT that which I was too vain of was my Ruin or rather my vanity was the Cause of it The Lady in the House where I was had two Sons young Gentlemen of very promising Parts and of extraordinary Behaviour and it was my Misfortune to be very well with them both but they manag'd themselves with me in a quite different Manner  THE eldest a gay Gentleman that knew the Town as well as the Country and tho' he had Levity enough to do an illnatur'd thing yet had  too much Judgment of things to pay too dear for his Pleasures he began with that unhappy Snare to all Women  viz  taking Notice upon all Occasions how pretty I was as he call'd it how agreeable how well Carriaged and the like and this he contriv'd so subtilly as if he had known as well how to catch a Woman in his Net as a Patridge when he went a Setting for he wou'd contrive to be talking this to his Sisters when tho' I was not by yet when he knew I was not so far off but that I should be sure to hear him His Sisters would return softly to him Hush Brother she will hear you she is but in the next Room then he would put it off and Talk softlier as if he had not known it and begun to ackowledge he was Wrong and then as if he had forgot himself he would speak aloud again and I that was so well pleas'd to hear it was sure to Lissen for it upon all Occasions  AFTER he had thus baited his Hook and found easily enough the Method how to lay it in my Way he play'd an opener Game and one Day going by his Sister's Chamber when I was there doing something about Dressing her he comes in with an Air of gayty O Mrs  Betty  said he to me How do you do Mrs  Betty  don't your Cheeks burn Mrs  Betty  I made a Curtsy and blush'd but said nothing What makes you talk so Brother  says the Lady  Why says he we have been talking of her below Stairs this half Hour  Well says his Sister  you can say no Harm of her that I am sure so 'tis no matter what you have been talking about nay  says he  'tis so far from talking Harm of her that we have been talking a great deal of good and a great many fine Things have been said of Mrs  Betty  I assure you and particularly that she is the  Handsomest young Woman in  Colchester  and in short they begin to Toast her Health in the Town  I wonder at you Brother  says the Sister Betty  wants but one Thing but she had as good want every Thing for the Market is against our Sex just now and if a young Woman have Beauty Birth Breeding Wit Sense Manners Modesty and all these to an Extream yet if she have not Money she's no Body she had has good want them all for nothing but Money now recommends a Woman the Men play the Game all into their own Hands  HER younger Brother who was by cry'd  Hold Sister  you run too fast I am an Exception to your Rule I assure you if I find a Woman so Accomplish'd as you Talk of  I say  I assure you I would not trouble myself about the Money  O says the Sister  but you will take Care not to Fancy one then without the Money  YOU don't know that neither  says the Brother    BUT why Sister  says the elder Brother  why do you exclaim so at the Men for aiming so much at the Fortune you are none of them that want a Fortune what ever else you want  I understand you Brother  replies the Lady very smartly  you suppose I have the Money and want the Beauty but as Times go now the first will do without the last so I have the better of my Neighbours  WELL  says the younger Brother  but your Neighbours as you call them may be even with you for Beauty will steal a Husband sometimes in spight of Money and when the Maid chances to be Handsomer than the Mistress she oftentimes  makes as good a Market and rides in a Coach before her  I thought it was time for me to withdraw and leave them and I did so but not so far but that I heard all their Discourse in which I heard abundance of fine things said of myself which serv'd to prompt my Vanity but as I soon found was not the way to encrease my Interest in the Family for the Sister and the younger Brrother fell grieviously out about it and as he said some very dissobliging things to her upon my Account so I could easily see that she Resented them by her future Conduct to me which indeed was very unjust to me for I had never had the least thought of what she suspected as to her younger Brother Indeed the elder Brother in his distant remote Way had said a great many things as in Jest which I had the folly to believe were in earnest or to flatter myself with the hopes of what I ought to have suppos'd he never intended and perhaps never thought of  IT happen'd one Day that he came running up Stairs towards the Room where his Sisters us'd to sit and Work as he often us'd to do and calling to them before he came in as was his way too I being there alone step'd to the Door and said Sir the Ladies are not here they are Walk'd down the Garden as I step'd forward to say this towards the Door he was just got to the Door and clasping me in his Arms as if it had been by Chance O Mrs  Betty says he  are you here that's better still I want to speak with you more than I do with them and then having me in his Arms he Kiss'd me three or four times  I struggl'd to get away and yet did it but faintly neither and he held me fast and still  Kiss'd me till he was almost out of Breath and then sitting down says  dear Betty  I am in Love with you  HIS Words I must confess fir'd my Blood all my Spirits flew about my Heart and put me into Disorder enough which he might easily have seen in my Face He repeated it afterwards several times that he was in Love with me and my Heart spoke as plain as a Voice that I lik'd it nay when ever he said I am in Love with you my Blushes plainly reply'd  wou'd you were  Sir  HOWEVER nothing else pass'd at that time it was but a Surprise and when he was gone I soon recover'd myself again He had stay'd longer with me but he happen'd to look out at the Window and see his Sisters coming up the Garden so he took his leave Kiss'd me again told me he was very serious and I should hear more of him very quickly and away he went leaving me infinitely pleas'd tho' surpris'd and had there not been one Misforune in it I had been in the Right but the Mistake lay here that Mrs  Betty  was in Earnest and the Gentleman was not  FROM this time my Head run upon strange Things and I may truly say I was not myself to have such a Gentleman talk to me of being in Love with me and of my being such a charming Creature as he told me I was these were things I knew not how to bear my vanity was elevated to the last Degree It is true I had my Head full of Pride but knowing nothing of the Wickedness of the times I had not one Thought of my own Safety or of my Vertue about me and had my young Master offer'd it at first Sight he might have taken any Liberty he thought sit with me but  he did not see his Advantage which was my happiness for that time  AFTER this Attack it was not long but he found an opportunity to catch me again and almost in the same Posture indeed it had more of Design in it on his Part tho' not on my Part  it was thus  the young Ladies were all gone a Visiting with their Mother his Brother was out of Town and as for his Father he had been at  London  for a Week before he had so well watched me that he knew where I was tho' I did not so much as know that he was in the House and he briskly comes up the Stairs and seeing me at Work comes into the Room to me directly and began just as he did before with taking me in his Arms and Kissing me for almost a quarter of an Hour together  IT was his younger Sisters Chamber that I was in and as there was no Body in the House but the Maids below Stairs he was it may be the ruder In short he began to be in Earnest with me indeed perhaps he found me a little too easie for God knows I made no Resistance to him while he only held me in his Arms and Kiss'd me indeed I was too well pleas'd with it to resist him much  HOWEVER as it were tir'd with that kind of Work we sat down and there he talk'd with me a great while  he said  he was charm'd with me and that he could not rest Night or Day till he had told me how he was in Love with me and if I was able to Love him again and would make him happy I should be the saving of his Life and many such fine things I said little to him again but easily discover'd that I was a Fool and that I did not in the least perceive what he meant  THEN he walk'd about the Room and taking me by the Hand I walk'd with him and by and by taking his Advantage he threw me down upon the Bed and Kiss'd me there most violently but to give him his Due offer'd no manner of Rudeness to me only Kiss'd me a great while after this he thought he had heard some Body come up Stairs so he got off from the Bed lifted me up professing a great deal of Love for me but told me it was all an honest Affection and that he meant no ill to me and with that he put five Guineas into my Hand and went away down Stairs  I WAS more confounded with the Money than I was before with the Love and began to be so elevated that I scarse knew the Ground I stood on I am the more particular in this part that if my Story comes to be read by any innocent young Body they may learn from it to Guard themselves against the Mischiefs which attend an early Knowledge of their own Beauty if a young Woman once thinks herself Handsome she never doubts the Truth of any Man that tells her he is in Love with her for if she believes herself Charming enough to Captivate him tis natural to expect the Effects of it  THIS young Gentleman had fir'd his Inclination as much as he had my vanity and as if he had found that he had an opportunity and was sorry he did not take hold of it he comes up again in half an Hour or thereabouts and falls to Work with me again as before only with a little less Introduction  AND First when he enter'd the Room he turn'd about and shut the Door Mrs  Betty  said he I fancy'd before some Body was coming up Stairs but it was not so however  adds he  if  they find me in the Room with you they shan't catch me a Kissing of you I told him I did not know who should be coming up Stairs for I believ'd there was no Body in the House but the Cook and the other Maid and they never came up those Stairs well my Dear  says he  'tis good to be sure however and so he sits down and we began to Talk and now tho' I was still all on fire with his first visit and said little he did as it were put Words in my Mouth telling me how passionately he lov'd me and that tho' he could not mention such a thing till he came to his Estate yet he was resolv'd to make me happy then and himself too  that is to say to Marry me  and abundance of such fine things which I poor Fool did not understand the drift off but acted as if there was no such thing as any kind of Love but that which tended to Matrimony and if he had spoke of that I had no Room as well as no Power to have said No but we were not come that length yet  WE had not sat long but he got up and stoping my very Breath with Kisses threw me upon the Bed again but then being both well warm'd he went farther with me then Decency permits me to mention nor had it been in my power to have deny'd him at that Moment had he offer'd much more than he did  HOWEVER tho' he took these Freedoms with me it did not go to that which they call the last Favour which to do him Justice he did not attempt and he made that self denyal of his a Plea for all his Freedoms with me upon other Occasions after this When this was over he stay'd but a little while but he put almost a Handful of Gold in my Hand and left me making a thousand Protestations of his Passion for me and  of his loving me above all the Women in the World  IT will not be strange if I now began to think but alas it was but with very little solid Reflection I had a most unbounded Stock of Vanity and Pride and but a very little Stock of Vertue I did indeed cast sometimes with myself what my young Master aim'd at but thought of nothing but the fine Words and the Gold whether he intended to Marry me or not to Marry me seem'd a Matter of no great Consequence to me nor did my Thoughts so much as suggest to me the Necessity of making any Capitulation for myself till he came to make a kind of formal Proposal to me as you shall hear presently  THUS I gave up myself to a readiness of being ruined without the least concern and am a fair  Memento  to all young Women whose Vanity prevails over their Vertue Nothing was ever so stupid on both Sides had I acted as became me and resisted as Vertue and Honour requir'd this Gentleman had either Desisted his Attacks finding no room to expect the Accomplishment of his Design or had made fair and honourable Proposals of Marriage in which Case whoever had blam'd him no Body could have blam'd me In short if he had known me and how easy the Trifle he aim'd at was to be had he would have troubled his Head no farther but have given me four or five Guineas and have lain with me the next time he had come at me and if I had known his Thoughts and how hard he thought I would be to be gain'd I might have made my own Terms with him and if I had not Capitulated for an immediate Marriage I might for a Maintenance till Marriage and might have had what I would  for he was already Rich to Excess besides what he had in Expectation but I seem'd wholly to have abandoned all such Thoughts as these and was taken up Onely with the Pride of my Beauty and of being be lov'd by such a Gentleman as for the Gold I spent whole Hours in looking upon it I told the Guineas over and over a thousand times a Day Never poor vain Creature was to wrapt up with every part of the Story as I was not Considering what was before me and how near my Ruin was at the Door indeed I think I rather wish'd for that Ruin than studyed to avoid it  IN the mean time however I was cunning enough not to give the least room to any in the Family to suspect me or to imagine that I had the least Correspondence with this young Gentleman I scarce ever look'd towards him in publick or Answer'd if he spoke to me if any Body was near us but for all that we had every now and then a little Encounter where we had room for a Word or two and now and then a Kiss but no fair opportunity for the Mischief intended and especially considering that he made more Circumlocution than if he had known my Thoughts he had occasion for and the Work appearing Difficult to him he really made it so  BUT as the Devil is an unwearied Tempter so he never fails to find opportunity for that Wickedness he invites to It was one Evening that I was in the Garden with his two younger Sisters and himself and all very innocently Merry when he found Means to convey a Note into my Hand by which he Directed me to understand that he would to Morrow desire me to publickly to go  of an Errand for him into the Town and that I should see him somewhere by the Way  ACCORDINGLY after Dinner he very gravely says to me his Sisters being all by Mrs  Betty  I must ask a Favour of you What's that  says his second Sister  nay Sister  says be  very gravely if you can't spare Mrs  Betty  to Day any other time will do  yes they said  they could spare her well enough and the Sister beg'd Pardon for asking which she did but of meer Course without any Meaning Well but Brother says the eldest Sister you must tell Mrs  Betty  what it is if it be any private Business that we must not hear You may call her out there she is why Sister says the Gentleman very gravely What do you mean  I  only desire her to go into the  Highstreet  and then he pulls out a TurnOver to such a Shop and then he tells them a long Story of two fine Neckcloths he had bid Money for and he wanted to have me go and make an Errand to buy a Neck to the TurnOver that he showed to see if they would take my Money for the Neckcloths to bid a Shilling more and Haggle with them and then he made more Errands and so continued to have such petty Business to do that  I  should be sure to stay a good while  WHEN he had given me my Errands he told them a long Story of a Visit he was going to make to a Family they all knew and where was to be such and such Gentlemen and how Merry they were to be and very formally asks his Sisters to go with him and they as formally excus'd themselves because of Company that they had Notice was to come and Visit them that Afternoon which by the Way he had contriv'd on purpose  HE had scarce done speaking to them and giving me my Errand but this Man came up to tell him that Sir  W H s  Coach stop'd at the Door so he runs down and comes up again immediately alas  says he  aloud there's all my Mirth spoil'd at once Sir  W  has sent his Coach for me and desires to speak with me upon some earnest Business It seems this Sir  W  was a Gentleman who liv'd about three Miles out of Town to whom he had spoken on purpose the Day before to lend him his Charriot for a particular occasion and had appointed it to call for him as it did about three aClock  IMMEDIATELY he calls for his best Wig Hat and Sword and ordering his Man to go to the other Place to make his Excuse that was to say he made an Excuse to send his Man away he prepares to go into the Coach As he was going he stop'd a while and speaks mighty earnestly to me about his Business and finds an Opportunity to say very softly to me  come away my Dear as soon as ever you can  I said nothing but made a Curtsy as if I had done so to what he said in publick in about a Quarter of an Hour I went out too I had no Dress other than before except that I had a Hood a Mask a Fan and a pair of Gloves in my Pocket so that there was not the least Suspicion in the House He waited for me in the Coach in a back  Lane  which he knew  I  must pass by and had directed the Coachman whether to go which was to a certain Place call'd  MileEnd  where lived a Confident of his where we went in and where was all the Convenience in the World to be as Wicked as we pleas'd  WHEN we were together he began to Talk very Gravely to me and to tell me he did not bring me there to betray me that his Passion for me would not suffer him to Abuse me that he resolv'd to Marry me as soon as he came to his Estate that in the mean time if  I  would grant his Request he would Maintain me very Honourably and made me a thousand Protestations of his Sincerity and of his Affection to me and That he would never abandon me and as  I  may say made a thousand more Preambles than he need to have done  HOWEVER as he press'd me to speak I told him I had no Reason to question the Sincerity of his Love to me after so many Protestations But and there I stopp'd as if I left him to Guess the rest BUT WHAT my Dear  says he  I guess what you mean what if you should be with Child is not that it Why then  says he  I'll take Care of you and Provide for you and the Child too and that you may see I am not in Jest  says he  here's an Earnest for you and with that he pulls out a silk Purse with an Hundred Guineas in it and gave it me and I'll give you such another  says he  every Year till I Marry you  MY Colour came and went at the Sight of the Purse and with the fire of his Proposal together so that I could not say a Word and he easily perceiv'd it so putting the Purse into my Bosom I made no more Resistance to him but let him do just what he pleas'd and as often as he pleas'd and thus I finish'd my own Destruction at once for from this Day being forsaken of my Vertue and my Modesty I had nothing of Value left to recommend me either to God's Blessing or Man's Assistance  BUT things did not End here I went back to the Town did the Business he publickly directed me to and was at Home before any Body thought me long as for my Gentleman he staid out as he told me he would till late at Night and there was not the least Suspicion in the Family either on his Account or on mine  WE had after this frequent Opportunities to repeat our Crime chiefly by his contrivance especially at home when his Mother and the young Ladies went Abroad a Visiting which he watch'd so narrowly as never to miss knowing always beforehand when they went out and then fail'd not to catch me all alone and securely enough so that we took our fill of our wicked Pleasure for near half a Year and yet which was the most to my Satisfaction I was not with Child  BUT before this half Year was expir'd his younger Brother of whom I have made some mention in the beginning of the Story falls to work with me and he finding me alone in the Garden one Evening begins a Story of the same Kind to me made good honest Professions of being in Love with me and in short proposes fairly and Honourably to Marry me and that before he made any other Offer to me at all  I was now confounded and driven to such an Extremity as the like was never known at least not to me I resisted the Proposal with Obstinancy and now I began to Arm my self with Arguments I laid before him the inequallity of the Match the Treatment I should meet with in the Family the Ingratitude it wou'd be to his good Father and Mother who had taken me into their House upon such generous Principles and when I was in such a low Condition and in short  I said every thing to dissuade him from his Design that I could imagine except telling him the Truth which wou'd indeed have put an end to it all but that I durst not think of mentioning  BUT here happen'd a Circumstance that I did not expect indeed which put me to my Shifts for this young Gentleman as he was plain and Honest so he pretended to nothing with me but what was so too and knowing his own Innocence he was not so careful to make his having a Kindness for Mrs  Betty  a Secret in the House as his Brother was and tho' he did not let them know that he had talk'd to me about it yet he said enough to let his Sisters perceive he Lov'd me and his Mother saw it too which tho' they took no Notice of it to me yet they did to him and immediately I found their Carriage to me alter'd more than ever before  I saw the Cloud tho' I did not foresee the Storm it was easie  I say  to see that their Carriage to me was alter'd and that it grew worse and worse every Day till at last I got Information among the Servants that I shou'd in a very little while be desir'd to remove  I was not alarm'd at the News having a full Satisfaction that I should be otherwise provided for and especially considering that I had Reason every Day to expect I should be with Child and that then I should be oblig'd to remove without any Pretences for it  AFTER some time the younger Gentleman took an Opportunity to tell me that the Kindness he had for me had got vent in the Family he did not Charge me with it  he said  for he knew well enough which way it came out he told me his plain way of Talking had been  the Occasion of it for that he did not make his respect for me so much a Secret as he might have done and the Reason was that he was at a Point that if I would consent to have him he would tell them all openly that he lov'd me and that he intended to Marry me That it was true his Father and Mother might Resent it and be unkind but that he was now in a Way to live being bred to the Law and he did not fear Maintaining me agreeable to what I should expect and that in short as he believed I would not be asham'd of him so he was resolv'd not to be asham'd of me and that he scorn'd to be afraid to own me now who he resolv'd to own after I was his Wife and therefore I had nothing to do but to give him my Hand and he would Answer for all the rest  I was now in a dreadful Condition indeed and now I repented heartily my easiness with the eldest Brother not from any Reflection of Conscience but from a View of the Happiness I might have enjoy'd and had now made impossible for tho' I had no great Scruples of Conscience  as I have said  to struggle with yet I could not think of being a Whore to one Brother and a Wife to the other but then it came into my Thoughts that the first Brother had promis'd to make me his Wife when he came to his Estate but I presently remember'd what I had often thought of that he had never spoken a Word of having me for a Wife after he had Conquer'd me for a Mistress and indeed till now tho' I said I thought of it often yet it gave me no Disturbance at all for as he did not seem in the least to lessen his Affection to me so neither did he lessen his Bounty tho' he had the Discretion himself to desire  me not to lay out a Penny of what he gave me in Cloaths or to make the least show Extraordinary because it would necessarily give Jealousie in the Family since every Body knew I could come at such things no manner of ordinary Way but by some private Friendship which they would presently have suspected  BUT I was now in a great strait and really knew not what to do the main Difficulty was this the younger Brother not only laid close Siege to me but suffered it to be seen he would come into his Sisters Room and his Mothers Room and sit down and Talk a Thousand kind things of me and to me even before their Faces and when they were all there This grew so Publick that the whole House talk'd of it and his Mother reprov'd him for it and their Carriage to me appear'd quite Altered In short his Mother had let fall some Speeches as if she intended to put me out of the Family that is in  English  to turn me out of Doors Now I was sure this could not be a Secret to his Brother only that he might not think as indeed no Body else yet did that the youngest Brother had made any Proposal to me about it But as I easily cou'd see that it would go farther so I saw likewise there was an absolute Necessity to speak of it to him or that he would speak of it to me and which to do first I knew not that is whether I should break it to him or let it alone till he should break it to me  UPON serious Consideration for indeed now I began to Consider things very seriously and never till now I say upon serious Consideration I resolv'd to tell him of it first and it was not long before I had an Opportunity for the  very next Day his Brother went to  London  upon some Business and the Family being out a Visiting just as it had happen'd before and as indeed was often the Case he came according to his Custom to spend an Hour or Two with Mrs  Betty    WHEN he came and had sate down a while he easily perceiv'd there was an alteration in my Countenance that I was not so free and pleasant with him as I us'd to be and particularly that I had been a Crying he was not long before he took notice of it and ask'd me in very kind Terms what was the Matter and if any thing Troubl'd me I wou'd have put it off if I could but it was not to be Conceal'd so after suffering many Importunities to draw that out of me which I long'd as much as possible to Disclose I told him that it was true something did Trouble me and something of such a Nature that I could not Conceal from him and yet that I could not tell how to tell him of it neither that it was a thing that not only Surpriz'd me but greatly perplex'd me and that I knew not what Course to take unless he would Direct me He told me with great Tenderness that let it be what it wou'd I should not let it Trouble me for he would Protect me from all the World  I then begun at a Distance and told him I was afraid the Ladies had got some secret Information of our Correspondence for that it was easie to see that their Conduct was very much chang'd towards me for a great while and that now it was come to that pass that they frequently found Fault with me and sometimes fell quite out with me tho' I never gave them the least Occasion That whereas I us'd always to lye with the Eldest Sister I was lately put to lye by my self or  with one of the Maids and that I had overheard them several times talking very Unkindly about me but that which confirm'd it all was that one of the Servants had told me that she had heard I was to be Turn'd out and that it was not safe for the Family that I should be any longer in the House  HE smil'd when he heard all this and I ask'd him how he could make so light of it when he must needs know that if there was any Discovery I was Undone for ever and that even it would hurt him tho' not Ruin him as it would me I upbraided him that he was like all the rest of the Sex that when they had the Character and Honour of a Woman at their Mercy often times made it their Jest and at least look'd upon it as a Trifle and counted the Ruin of those they had had their Will of as a thing of no value  HE saw me Warm and Serious and he chang'd his Stile immediately  he told me  he was sorry I should have such a thought of him that he had never given me the least Occasion for it but had been as tender of my Reputation as he could be of his own that he was sure our Correspondence had been manag'd with so much Address that not one Creature in the Family had so much as a Suspicion of it that if he smil'd when I told him my Thoughts it was at the Assurance he lately receiv'd that our understanding one another was not so much as known or guess'd at and that when he had told me how much Reason he had to be Easie I should Smile as he did for he was very certain it would give me a full Satisfaction  THIS is a Mystery I cannot understand  says I  or how it should be to my Satisfaction that I am to be turn'd out of Doors for if our Correspondence  is not discover'd I know not what else I have done to change the Countenances of the whole Family to me or to have them Treat me as they do now who formerly used me with so much Tenderness as if I had been one of their own Children  WHY look you Child  says he  that they are Uneasie about you that is true but that they have the least Suspicion of the Case as it is and as it respects you and I is so far from being True that they suspect my Brother  Robin  and in short they are fully persuaded he makes Love to you Nay the Fool has put it into their Heads too himself for he is continually Bantring them about it and making a Jest of himself I confess I think he is wrong to do so because he can not but see it vexes them and makes them Unkind to you but 'tis a Satisfaction to me because of the Assurance it gives me that they do not suspect me in the least and I hope this will be to your Satisfaction too  SO it is  says I  one way but this does not reach my Case at all nor is this the chief Thing that Troubles me tho' I have been concern'd about that too What is it then  says he  With which I fell into Tears and could say nothing to him at all He strove to pacifie me all he could but began at last to be very pressing upon me to tell what it was at last  I answer'd  that I thought I ought to tell him too and that he had some right to know it besides that I wanted his Direction in the Case for I was in such Perplexity that I knew not what Course to take and then I related the whole Affair to him  I told him  how imprudently his Brother had manag'd himself in making himself so Publick for that if he had kept it  Secret as such a Thing ought to have been I could but have Denied him Positively without giving any Reason for it and he would in Time have ceas'd his Sollicitations but that he had the Vanity first to depend upon it that I would not Deny him and then had taken the Freedom to tell his Resolution of having me to the whole House  I  told him  how far I had resisted him and  told him  how Sincere and Honourable his Offers were but  says I  my Case will be doubly hard for as they carry it Ill to me now because he desires to have me they'll carry it worse when they shall find I have Deny'd him and they will presently say there's something else in it and then out it comes that I am Marry'd already to somebody else or else that I would never refuse a Match so much above me as this was  THIS Discourse surpriz'd him indeed very much He  told me  that it was a critical Point indeed for me to Manage and he did not see which way I should get out of it but he would consider of it and let me know next time we met what Resolution he was come to about it and in the mean time desir'd I would not give my Consent to his Brother nor yet give him a flat Denial but that I would hold him in Suspence a while  I seem'd to start at his saying I should not give him my Consent I  told him  he knew very well I had no Consent to give that he had Engag'd himself to Marry me and that my Consent was at the same time Engag'd to him that he had all along told me I was his Wife and I look'd upon my self as effectually so as if the Ceremony had pass'd and that it was from his own Mouth that I did so he having all along persuaded me to call myself his Wife  WELL my Dear  says he  don't be Concern'd at that now if I am not your Husband I'll be as good as a Husband to you and do not let those things Trouble you now but let me look a little farther into this Affair and I shall be able to say more next time we meet  HE pacify'd me as well as he could with this but I found he was very Thoughtful and that tho' he was very kind to me and kiss'd me a thousand Times and more I believe and gave me Money too yet he offer'd no more all the while we were together which was above two Hours and which I much wonder'd at indeed at that Time considering how it us'd to be and what Opportunity we had  HIS Brother did not come from  London  for five or six Days and it was two Days more before he got an Opportunity to talk with him but then getting him by himself he began to talk very Close to him about it and the same Evening got an Opportunity for we had a long Conference together to repeat all their Discourse to me which as near as I can remember was to the purpose following He  told him  he heard strange News of him since he went  viz  that he made Love to Mrs  Betty  Well  says his  Brother a little Angrily and so  I do  And what then What has any body to do with that Nay  says his  Brother don't be Angry  Robin  I don't pretend to have any thing to do with it nor do I pretend to be Angry with you about it But I find they do concern themselves about it and that they have used the poor Girl Ill about it which I should take as done to my self Who do you mean by THEY  says  Robin I mean my Mother and the Girls  says the  elder Brother  BUT hark ye  says his  Brother are you in Earnest do you really Love the Girl you may be free with me you know Why then  says  Robin I will be free with you I do Love her above all the Women in the World and I will have Her let  them say  and do what they will I believe the Girl will not Deny me  IT stuck me to the Heart when he  told me  this for tho' it was most rational to think I would not Deny him yet I knew in my own Conscience I must Deny him and I saw my Ruin in my being oblig'd to do so but I knew it was my business to Talk otherwise then so I interrupted him in his Story thus  AY  said I  does he think I can not Deny him but he shall find I can Deny him for all that  WELL my dear  says he  but let me give you the whole Story as it went on between us and then say what you will  THEN he went on and  told me  that he reply'd thus But Brother you know She has nothing and you may have several Ladies with good Fortunes 'Tis no matter for that  said  Robin I Love the Girl and I will never please my Pocket in Marrying and not please my Fancy and so my Dear  adds he  there is no Opposing him  YES yes  says I  you shall see I can Oppose him I have learnt to say NO now tho' I had not learnt it before if the best Lord in the Land offer'd me Marriage now I could very chearfully say NO to him  WELL but my Dear  says he  What can you say to him You know as you said when we talk'd of it before he will ask you many Questions about it and all the House will wonder what the meaning of it should be  WHY  says I  smiling I can stop all their Mouths at one Clap by telling him and them too that I am Married already to his elder Brother  HE smil'd a little too at the Word but I could see it Startled him and he could not hide the disorder it put him into however he return'd Why tho' that may be true in some Sense yet I suppose you are but in Jest when you talk of giving such an Answer as that it may not be Convenient on many Accounts  No no  says I  pleasantly I am not so fond of letting that Secret come out without your Consent  BUT what then can you say to him or to them  says he  when they find you positive against a Match which would be apparently so much to your Advantage  WHY  says I  should I be at a loss First of all I am not oblig'd to give them any Reason at all on the other hand I may tell them I am Married already and stop there and that will be a full Stop too to him for he can have no Reason to ask one Question after it  AY  says he  but the whole House will teize you about that even to Father and Mother and if you deny them positively they will be Disoblig'd at you▪ and Suspicious besides  WHY  says I  What can I do What would you have me do I was in strait enough before and as I  told you  I was in Perplexity before and acquainted you with the Circumstances that I might have your Advice  MY dear  says he  I have been considering very much upon it you may be sure and tho' it is a piece of Advice that has a great many Mortifications in it to me and may at first seem Strange to you yet all Things consider'd I fee no better  way for you than to let him go on and if you find him hearty and in Earnest Marry him  I gave him a look full of Horror at those Words and turning Pale as Death was at the very point of sinking down out of the Chair I sat in When giving a start my Dear  says he  aloud What's the matter with you Where are you a going and a great many such things and with joging and calling to me fetch'd me a little to my self tho' it was a good while before I fully recover'd my Senses and was not able to speak for several Minutes more  WHEN I was fully recover'd he began again▪ My dear  says he  What made you so Surpriz'd at what I said I would have you consider Seriously of it you may see plainly how the Family stand in this Case and they would be stark Mad if it was my Case as it is my Brothers and for I ought I see it would be my Ruin and yours too  AY  says I  still speaking angrily are all your Protestations and Vows to be shaken by the dislike of the Family Did I not always object that to you and you made a light thing of it as what you were above and would not Value and is it come to this now  Said I  ▪ is this your Faith and Honour your Love and the Solidity of your Promises  HE continued perfectly Calm notwithstanding all my Reproaches and I was not sparing of them at all but  he reply'd  at last My Dear I have not broken one Promise with you yet I did tell you I would Marry you when I was come to my Estate but you see my Father is a hail healthy Man and may live these thirty Years still and not be Older than several are round us in the Town and you never propos'd my Marrying you  sooner because you know it might be my Ruin and as to all the rest I have not fail'd you in any thing you have wanted for nothing  I could not deny a Word of this and had nothing to say to it in general but why then  says I  can you perswade me to such a horrid stop as leaving you since you have not left me Will you allow no Affection no Love on my Side where there has been so much on your Side Have I made you no Returns Have I given no Testimony of my Sincerity and of my Passion are the Sacrifices I have made of Honour and Modesty to you no Proof of my being ty'd to you in Bonds too strong to be broken  BUT here my Dear  says he  you may come into a safe Station and appear with Honour and with splendor at once and the Remembrance of what we have done may be wrapt up in an eternal Silence as if it had never happen'd you shall always have my Respect and my sincere Affection only then it shall be Honest and perfectly Just to my Brother you shall be my Dear Sister as now you are my Dearand there he stop'd  YOUR Dear whore  says I  you would have said if you had gone on and you might as well have said it but I understand you However I desire you to remember the long Discourses you have had with me and the many Hours pains you have taken to perswade me to believe myself an honest Woman that I was your Wife intentionally tho' not in the Eye of the World and that it was as effectual a Marriage that had pass'd between us as if we had been publickly Wedded by the Parson of the Parish you know and cannot but remember that these have been your own Words to me  I found this was a little too close upon him but I made it up in what follows he stood stock still for a while and said nothing and I went on thus you cannot  says I  without the highest injustice believe that I yielded upon all these Perswasions without a Love not to be questioned not to be shaken again by any thing that could happen afterward If you have such dishonourable Thoughts of me I must ask you what Foundation in any of my Behaviour have I given for such a Suggestion  IF than I have yielded to the Importunities of my Affection and if I have been perswaded to believe that I am really and in the Essence of the Thing your Wife shall I now give the Lye to all those Arguments and call myself your Whore or Mistress which is the same thing And will you Transfer me to your Brother Can you Transfer my Affection Can you bid me cease loving you and bid me love him is it in my Power think you to make such a Change at Demand No Sir  said I  depend upon it 'tis impossible and whatever the Change of your Side may be I will ever be True and I had much rather since it is come that unhappy Length be your Whore than your Brothers Wife  HE appear'd pleas'd and touch'd with the impression of this last Discourse and told me that he stood where he did before that he had not been Unfaithful to me in any one Promise he had ever made yet but that there were so many terrible things presented themselves to his View in the Affair before me and that on my Account in particular that he had thought of the other as a Remedy so effectual as nothing could come up to it That he thought this would not be  an entire parting us but we might love as Friends all our Days and perhaps with more Satisfaction than we should in the Station we were now in as things might happen That he durst say I could not apprehend any thing from him as to betraying a Secret which could not but be the Destruction of us both if it came out That he had but one Question to ask of me that could lye in the way of it and if that Question was answer'd in the Negative he could not but think still it was the only Step I could take  I guess'd at his Question presently namely Whether I was sure I was not with Child As to that  I told him  he need not be concern'd about it for I was not with Child why then my Dear  says he  we have no time to Talk farther now consider of it and think closely about it I cannot but be of the Opinion still that it will be the best Course you can take and with this he took his Leave and the more hastily too his Mother and Sister Ringing at the Gate just at the Moment that he had risen up to go  HE left me in the utmost Confusion of Thought and he easily perceiv'd it the next Day and all the rest of the Week for it was but  Tuesday  Evening when we talked but he had no Opportunity to come at me all that Week till the  Sunday  after when I being indispos'd did not go to Church and he making some Excuse for the like stay'd at Home  AND now he had me an Hour and a Half again by myself and we fell into the same Arguments all over again or at least so near the same as it would be to no purpose to repeat them at last  I ask'd him  warmly what Opinion he must have of my Modesty that he could suppose I should so much as Entertain  a thought of lying with two Brothers And assur'd him it could never be  I added  if he was to tell me that he would never see me more than which nothing but Death could be more Terrible yet I could never entertain a thought so Dishonourable to my self and so Base to him and therefore I entreated him if he had one Grain of Respect or Affection left for me that he would speak no more of it to me or that he would pull his Sword out and Kill me He appear'd surpriz'd at my Obstinancy as he call'd it  told me  I was unkind to my self and unkind to him in it that it was a Crisis unlook'd for upon us both and impossible for either of us to foresee but that he did not see any other way to save us both from Ruin and therefore he thought it the more Unkind but that if he must say no more of it to me he added with an unusual Coldness that he did not know any thing else we had to talk of and so he rose up to take his leave I rose up too as if with the same Indifference but when he came to give me as it were a parting Kiss I burst out into such a Passion of Crying that tho' I would have spoke I could not and only pressing his Hand seem'd to give him the Adieu but cry'd vehemently  HE was sensibly mov'd with this so he sat down again and said a great many kind things to me to abate the excess of my Passion but still urg'd the necessity of what he had proposed all the while insisting that if I did refuse he would notwithstanding provide for me but letting me plainly see that he would decline me in the main Point nay even as a Mistress making it a point of Honour not to lye with the Woman that for ought he knew might come to be his Brothers Wife  THE bare loss of him as a Gallant was not so much my Affliction as the loss of his Person whom indeed I Lov'd to Distraction and the loss of all the Expectations I had and which I always had built my Hopes upon of having him one Day for my Husband These things oppress'd my Mind so much that in short I fell very ill the agonies of my Mind in a word threw me into a high Feaver and long it was that none in the Family expected my Life  I was reduc'd very low indeed and was often Delirious and light Headed but nothing lay so near me as the fear that when I was light Headded I should say something or other to his Prejudice I was distress'd in my Mind also to see him and so he was to see me for he really Lov'd me most passionately but it could not be there was not the least Room to desire it on one side or other or so much as to make it Decent  IT was near five Weeks that I kept my Bed and tho' the violence of my Feaver abated in three Weeks yet it several times Return'd and the Physicians said two or three times they could do no more for me but that they must leave Nature and the Distemper to fight it Out only strengthening the first with Cordials to maintain the Strugle After the end of five Weeks I grew better but was so Weak so Alter'd so Melancholly and recover'd so Slowly that the Physicians apprehended I should go into a Consumption and which vex'd me most they gave it as their Opinion that my Mind was Oppress'd that something Troubl'd me and in short that I was IN LOVE upon this the whole House was set upon me to Examine me and to press me to tell whether I was in Love or not and with who but as  I well might I deny'd my being in Love at all  THEY had on this Occasion a Squable one Day about me at Table that had like to have put the whole Family in an Uproar and for sometime did so they happen'd to be all at Table but the Father as for me I was Ill and in my Chamber At the beginning of the Talk which was just as they had finish'd their Dinner the old Gentlewoman who had sent me somewhat to Eat call'd her Maid to go up and ask me if I would have any more but the Maid brought down Word I had not Eaten half what she had sent me already  ALAS  says the  old Lady that poor Girl I am afraid she will never be well  WELL  says the  elder Brother How should Mrs  Betty  be well  they say  she is in Love  I believe nothing of it  says the  old Gentlewoman  I don't know  says the  eldest Sister what to say to it they have made such a rout about her being so Handsome and so Charming and I know not what and that in her hearing too that has turn'd the Creatures Head I believe and who knows what possessions may follow such Doings for my Part I don't know what to make of it  WHY Sister you must acknowledge she is very Handsome  says the  elder Brother  AY and a great deal Handsomer than you Sister  says  Robin and that's your Mortification  WELL well that is not the Question  says his  Sister the Girl is well enough and she knows it well enough she need not be told of it to make her Vain  WE are not a talking of her being Vain  says the  elder Brother but of her being in Love it may be she is in Love with herself it seems my Sisters think so  I would she was in Love with me  says  Robin I'd quickly put her out of her Pain  WHAT d' ye mean by that Son  says the  old Lady How can you talk so  WHY Madam  says  Robin again very honestly Do you think I'd let the poor Girl Die for Love and of one that is near at hand to be had too  FYE Brother  says the  second Sister how can you talk so would you take a Creature that has not a Groat in the World  PRETHEE Child  says  Robin Beauties a Portion and good Humour with it is a double Portion I wish thou hadst half her Stock of both for thy Portion So there was her Mouth stopp'd  I find  says the  eldest Sister if  Betty  is not in Love my Brother is I wonder he has not broke his Mind to  Betty  I warrant she won't say NO  THEY that yield when they're ask'd  says  Robin are one step before them that were never ask'd to yield Sister and two Steps before them that yield before they are ask'd And that's an Answer to you Sister  THIS fir'd the Sister and she flew into a Passion and said things were come to that pass that it was time the Wench  meaning me  was out of the Family and but that she was not fit to be turn'd out she hop'd her Father and Mother would consider of it as soon as she could be remov'd  Robin  reply'd That was business for the Master and Mistress of the Family who were not to be taught by One that had so little Judgment as his eldest Sister  IT run up a great deal farther the Sister Scolded  Robin  Rally'd and Banter'd but poor  Betty  loss'd Ground by it extreamly in the Family I  heard of it and I cry'd heartily and the old Lady came up to me some body having told her that I was so much concern'd about it I complain'd to her that it was very hard the Doctors should pass such a Censure upon me for which they had no Ground and that it was still harder considering the Circumstances I was under in the Family that I hop'd I had done nothing to lessen her Esteem for me or given any Occasion for the Bickering between her Sons and Daughters and I had more need to think of a Coffin than of being in Love and beg'd she would not let me suffer in her Opinion for any bodies Mistakes but my own  SHE was sensible of the Justice of what I said but  told me  since there had been such a Clamour among them and that her younger Son Talk'd after such a rattling way as he did she desir'd I would be so Faithful to her as to Answer her but one Question sincerely I told her I would with all my heart and with the utmost plainess and Sincerity Why then the Question was Whether there was any thing between her Son  Robert  and me I told her with all the Protestations of Sincerity that I was able to make and as I might well do that there was not nor ever had been I  told her  that Mr  Robert  had rattled and jested as she knew it was his way and that I took it always as I suppos'd he meant it to be a wild airy way of Discourse that had no Signification in it And again assured her that there was not the least tittle of what she understood by it between us and that those who had Suggested it had done me a great deal of Wrong and Mr  Robert  no Service at all  THE old Lady was fully satisfy'd and kiss'd me spoke chearfully to me and bid me take care of my Health and want for nothing and so took her leave But when she came down she found the Brother and all his Sisters together by the Ears they were Angry even to Passion at his upbraiding them with their being Homely and having never had any Sweetheart never having been ask'd the Question and their being so forward as almost to ask first He rallied them upon the Subject of Mrs  Betty  how Pretty how good Humour'd how she Sung better than they did and Danc'd better and how much Handsomer she was and in doing this he omitted no Illnatur'd Thing that could vex them and indeed push'd too hard upon them The old Lady came down in the height of it and to put a stop to it told them all the Discourse she had had with me and how I answer'd that there was nothing between Mr  Robert  and I  SHE'S wrong there  says  Robin for if there was not a great deal between us we should be closer together than we are I told her I Lov'd her hugely  says he  but I could never make the Jade believe I was in Earnest I do not know how you should  says his  Mother no body in their Senses could believe you were in Earnest to Talk so to a poor Girl whose Circumstances you know so well  BUT prethee Son  adds she  since you tell me that you could not make her believe you were in Earnest what must we believe about it for you ramble so in your Discourse that no body knows whether you are in Earnest or in Jest But as I find the Girl by your own Confession has answer'd truely I wish you would do so too and tell me  seriously so that I may depend upon it Is there any thing in it or no Are you in Earnest or no Are you Distracted indeed or are you not 'Tis a weighty Question and I wish you would make us easie about it  BY my Faith Madam  says  Robin 'tis in vain to mince the Matter or tell any more Lyes about it I am in Earnest as much as a Man is that's going to be Hang'd If Mrs  Betty  would say she Lov'd me and that she would Marry me I'd have her to morrow Morning fasting and say  To have and to hold  instead of eating my Breakfast  WELL  says the Mother  then there's one Son lost and she said it in a very mournful Tone as one greatly concern'd at it  I hope not Madam  says  Robin no Man is lost when a good Wife has found him  WHY but Child  says the  old Lady she is a Beggar  WHY then Madam she has the more need of Charity  says  Robin I'll take her off of the hands of the Parish and she and I'll Beg together  ITS bad Jesting with such things  says the Mother    I don't Jest Madam  says  Robin We'll come and beg your Pardon Madam and your Blessing Madam and my Fathers  THIS is all out of the way Son  says the Mother  if you are in Earnest you are Undone  I am afraid not  says he  for I am really afraid she won't have me after all my Sisters huffing and blustring I believe I shall never be able to persuade her to it  THAT'S a fine Tale indeed she is not so far out of her Senses neither Mrs  Betty  is no Fool  says the youngest Sister  Do you think she has learnt to say NO any more than other People  NO Mrs  MirthWit  says ROBIN Mrs  Betty  's no Fool but Mrs  Betty  may be Engag'd some other way And what then  NAY  says the eldest Sister  we can say nothing to that Who must it be to then She is never out of the Doors it must be between you  I have nothing to say to that  says  Robin I have been Examin'd enough there's my Brother if it must be  between us  go to Work with him  THIS stung  the elder Brother  to the Quick and he concluded that  Robin  had discover'd something However he kept himself from appearing disturb'd Prethee  says he  don't go to sham your Stories off upon me I tell you I deal in no such Ware I have nothing to say to Mrs  Betty  nor to any of the  Miss Betty  's in the Parish and with that he rose up and brush'd off  NO  says the eldest Sister  I dare answer for my Brother he knows the World better  THUS the Discourse ended but it left  the elder Brother  quite confounded He concluded his Brother had made a full Discovery and he began to doubt whether I had been concern'd in it or not but with all his Management he could not bring it about to get at me at last he was so perplex'd that he was quite Desperate and resolv'd he wou'd come into my Chamber and see me whatever came of it In order to this he contriv'd it so that one Day after Dinner watching  his eldest Sister  till he could see her go up Stairs he runs after her  Hark ye Sister says he  Where is this sick Woman may not a body see her  YES says the Sister  I believe you may but let me go first a little and I'll tell you so she  run up to the Door and gave me notice and presently call'd to him again BROTHER  says she  you may come if you please so in he came just in the same kind of Rant Well  says he  at the Door  as he came in  Where is this sick Body that's in Love How do ye do Mrs  Betty  I would have got up out of my Chair but was so Weak I could not for a good while and he saw it and his Sister too and she said  Come do not strive to stand up  my Brother desires no Ceremony especially now you are so Weak No No Mrs  Betty  pray sit still  says he  and so sits himself down in a Chair overagainst me and appear'd as if he was mighty Merry  HE talk'd a deal of rambling Stuff to his Sister and to me sometimes of one thing sometimes of another on purpose to Amuse his Sister and every now and then would turn it upon the old Story directing it to me Poor Mrs  Betty says he  it is a sad thing to be in Love why it has reduced you sadly at last I spoke a little I am glad to see you so Merry Sir  says I  but I think the Doctor might have found some thing better to do than to make his Game at his Patients If I had been Ill of no other Distemper I know the Proverb too well to have let him come to me What Proverb  says he  O I remember it now What  "Where Love is the Case  "The  Doctor's  an Ass  IS not that it Mrs  Betty  I smil'd and said nothing Nay  says he  I think the effect has prov'd it to be Love for it seems the Doctor has been able to do you but little Service you mend very slowly they say I doubt there's somewhat in it  Mrs  Betty  I doubt you are Sick of the Incureables and that is Love I smil'd and said No  indeed Sir  that's none of my Distemper  WE had a deal of such Discourse and sometimes others that signify'd as little by and by He ask'd me to Sing them a Song at which I smil'd and said my singing Days were over At last he ask'd me if he should Play upon his Flute to me his Sister said she believ'd it wou'd hurt me and that my Head could not bear it I bow'd and said No it would not hurt me And pray Madam  said I  do not hinder it I love the Musick of the Flute very much then his Sister said well do then Brother with that he pull'd out the Key of his Closet Dear Sister  says he  I am very Lazy do step to my Closet and fetch my Flute it lies in  such a Drawer  naming a Place where he was sure it was not that she might be a little while a looking for it  AS soon as she was gone he related the whole Story to me of the Discourse his Brother had about me and of his pushing it at him and his concern about it which was the Reason of his contriving this Visit to me I assur'd him I had never open'd my Mouth either to his Brother or to any Body else I told him the dreadful Exigence I was in that my Love to him and his offering to have me forget that Affection and remove it to another had thrown me down and that I had a thousand Times wish'd I might Die rather than Recover and to have the same Circumstances to strugle with as I had before and that this backwardness to Life had been the great Reason of the slowness of my Recovering I added that I foresaw that as soon as I was well I must quit the Family and that as for Marrying his  Brother  I  abhor'd the thoughts of it after what had been my Case with him and that he might depend upon it I would never see his Brother again upon that Subject That if he would break all his Vows and Oaths and Engagements with me be that between his Conscience and his Honour and himself But he should never be able to say that I who he had persuaded to call my self his Wife and who had given him the Liberty to use me as a Wife was not as Faithful to him as a Wife ought to be what ever he might be to me  HE was going to reply and had said That he was sorry I could not be persuaded and was a going to say more but he heard his Sister a coming and so did I and yet I forc'd out these few Words as a reply That I could never be persuaded to Love one  other and Marry another He shook his Head and said  Then I am Ruin'd  meaning himself and that Moment his Sister enter'd the Room and told him she could not find the Flute Well  says he  merrily this Laziness won't do so he gets up and goes himself to go to look for it but comes back without too not but that he could have found it but because his Mind was a little Disturb'd and he had no mind to Play and besides the Errand he sent his Sister of was answer'd another way for he only wanted an Opportunity to speak to me which he gain'd tho' not much to his Satisfaction  I had however a great deal of Satisfaction in having spoken my Mind to him with Freedom and with such an honest Plainest as I have related and tho' it did not at all Work that way I desir'd  that is to say  to oblige the Person to me the more yet it took from him all possibility of quiting me but by a down right breach of Honour  and giving up all the Faith of a Gentleman to me which he had so often engaged by never to abandon me but to make me his Wife as soon as he came to his Estate  IT was not many Weeks after this before I was about the House again and began to grow well but I continu'd Melancholly silent dull and retir'd which amaz'd the whole Family except he that knew the Reason of it yet it was a great while before he took any Notice of it and I  as backward to speak as he  carried respectfully to him but never offer'd to speak a Word to him that was particular of any kind whatsoever and this continu'd for sixteen or seventeen Weeks so that as I expected every Day to be dismiss'd the Family on Account of what Distaste they had taken another Way in which I had no Guilt so I expected to hear no more of this Gentleman after all his solemn Vows and Protestations but to be ruin'd and abandon'd  AT last I broke the way myself in the Family for my Removing for being talking seriously with the old Lady one Day about my own Circumstances in the World and how my Distemper had left a heaviness upon my Spirits that I was not the same thing I was before The old Lady said I am afraid  Betty  what I have said to you about my Son has had some Influence upon you and that you are Melancholly on his Account Pray will you let me know how the Matter stands with you both if it may not be improper for as for  Robin  he does nothing but Rally and Banter when I speak of it to him Why truly Madam  said I  that Matter stands as I wish it did not and I shall be very sincere with you in it what ever befalls me for it Mr  Robert  has seveseveral  times propos'd Marriage to me which is what I had no Reason to expect my poor Circumstances consider'd but I have always resisted him and that perhaps in Terms more positive than became me considering the Regard that I ought to have for every Branch of your Family But  said I  Madam I could never so far forget my Obligations to you and all your House to offer to Consent to a Thing which I know must needs be Disobliging to you and this I have made my Argument to him and have possitively told him that I would never entertain a Thought of that kind unless I had your Consent and his Fathers also to whom I was bound by so many invincible Obligations  AND is this possible Mrs  Betty  says the old Lady than you have been much Justier to us than we have been to you for we have all look'd upon you as a kind of a Snare to my Son and I had a Proposal to make to you for your Removing for fear of it but I had not yet mention'd it to you because I thought you were not thorough Well and I was afraid of grieving you too much least it should thro' you down again for we have all a Respect for you still tho' not so much as to have it be the Ruin of my Son but if it be as you say we have all wrong'd you very much  AS to the Truth of what I say Madam  said I  I refer you to your Son himself if he will do me any Justice he must tell you the Story just as I have told it  AWAY goes the old Lady to her Daughters and tells them the whole Story just as I had told it her and they were surpris'd at it you may be sure as I believ'd they would be one  said  she could never have thought it another said  Robin  was a Fool a  Third  said she would not believe a Word of it and she would warrant that  Robin  would tell the Story another way but the old Gentlewoman who was resolv'd to go to the bottom of it before I could have the least Opportunity of Acquainting her Son with what had pass'd resolv'd too that she would Talk with her Son immediately and to that purpose sent for him for he was gone but to a Lawyers House in the Town upon some petty Business of his own and upon her sending he return'd immediately  UPON his coming up to them for they were all still together sit down  Robin says the old Lady  I must have some talk with you with all my Heart Madam  says  Robin  looking very Merry  I hope it is about a good Wife for I am at a great loss in that Affair How can that be  says his Mother  did not you say you resolved to have Mrs  Betty  Ay Madam says  Robin  but there is one has  forbid the Banns  Forbid the Banns  says his Mother  who can that be Even Mrs  Betty  herself says  Robin  How so  says his Mother  Have you ask'd her the Question then  Tes indeed Madam says  Robin I have attack'd her in Form five times since she was Sick and am beaten off the Jade is so stout she won't Capitulate nor yield upon any Terms except such as I cannot effectually Grant Explain your self  says the Mother  for I am surpris'd I do not understand you I hope you are not in Earnest  WHY Madam  says he  the Case is plain enough upon me it explains itself she wont have me  she says  is not that plain enough I think 'tis plain and pretty rough too well but  says the Mother  you talk of Conditions that you cannot Grant what does she want a Settlement her  Jointure ought to be according to her Portion but what Fortune does she bring you Nay as to Fortune  says  Robin she is rich enough I am satisfy'd in that Point but  'tis I  that am not able to come up to her Terms and she is positive she will not have me without  HERE the Sisters put in Madam  says the second Sister  'tis impossible to be serious with him he will never give a direct Answer to any thing you had better let him alone and talk no more of it to him you know how to dispose of her out of his way if you thought there was any thing in it  Robin  was a little warm'd with his Sisters rudeness but he was even with her and yet with good Manners too There are two sorts of People Madam  says he turning to his Mother  that there is no contending with that is a wise Body and a Fool 'tis a little hard I should engage with both of them together  THE younger Sister than put in we must be Fools indeed  says she  in my Brother's Opinion that he should think we can believe he has seriously ask'd Mrs  Betty  to Marry him and that she has refus'd him  Answer  and  Answer not  says  Solomon replyed her Brother  When your Brother had said to your Mother that he had ask'd her no less than five Times and that it was so that she positively Denied him methinks a younger Sister need not question the Truth of it when her Mother did not My Mother you see did not understand it  says the second Sister  There's some difference  says  Robin between desiring me to Explain it and telling me she did not believe it  WELL but Son  says the old Lady  if you are dispos'd to let us into the Mystery of it What were  these hard Conditions Yes Madam  says  Robin I had done it before now if the  Teazers  here had not worried me by way of Interruption The Conditions are that I bring my Father and you to Consent to it and without that she protests she will never see me more upon that Head and these Conditions  as I said  I suppose I shall never be able to Grant I hope my warm Sisters will be Answer'd now and Blush a little if not I have no more to say till I hear farther  THIS Answer was surprizing to them all tho' less to the Mother because of what I had said to her as to the Daughters they stood Mute a great while but the Mother said with some Passion WELL I had heard this before  but I cou'd not believe it  but if it is so then we have all done  BETTY  wrong and she has behav'd better than I ever expected Nay  says the eldest Sister  if it is so she has acted Handsomely indeed I confess  says the Mother  it was none of her Fault if he was Fool enough to take a Fancy to her but to give such an Answer to him shews more Respect to your Father and me than I can tell how to Express I shall value the Girl the better for it as long as I know her But I shall not  says  Robin unless you will give your Consent I'll consider of that a while  says the Mother  I assure you if there were not some other Objections in the way this Conduct of hers would go a great way to bring me to Consent I wish it would go quite thro' with it  says  Robin if you had as much thought about making me Easie as you have about making me Rich you would soon Consent to it  WHY  Robin says the Mother again  Are you really in Earnest Would you so fain have her as you pretend Really Madam  says  Robin I think  'tis hard you should Question me upon that Head after all I have said I won't say that I will have her how can I resolve that point when you see I cannot have her without your Consent besides I am not bound to Marry at all But this I will say I am in Earnest in that I will never have any body else if I can help it so you may Determine for me  Betty  or no Body is the Word and the Question which of the Two shall be in your Breast to decide Madam provided only that  my good humour'd Sisters here may have no Vote in it    ALL this was dreadful to me for the Mother began to yield and  Robin  press'd her Home in it On the other hand she advised with the eldest Son and he used all the Arguments in the World to persuade her to Consent alledging his Brothers passionate Love for me and my generous Regard to the Family in refusing my own Advantages upon such a nice point of Honour and a thousand such Things And as to the Father he was a Man in a hurry of publick Affairs and getting Money seldom at Home thoughtful of the main Chance but left all those Things to his Wife  YOU may easily believe that when the Plot was thus as  they thought  broke out and that every one thought they knew how Things were carried It was not so Difficult or so Dangerous for the elder Brother who no body suspected of any thing to have a freer Access to me than before Nay the Mother  which was just as he wish'd  Propos'd it to him to Talk with Mrs  Betty  for it may be Son  said she  you may see farther into the Thing than I and see if you think she has been so Positive as  Robin  says she has been or no This was as well as he could wish and he as it were  yielding to Talk with me at his Mother's Request She brought me to him into her own Chamber told me her Son had some Business with me at her Request and desir'd me to be very Sincere with him and then she left us together and he went and shut the Door after her  HE came back to me and took me in his Arms and kiss'd me very Tenderly but told me he had a long Discourse to hold with me and it was now come to that Crisis that I should make my self Happy or Miserable as long as I Liv'd That the Thing was now gone so far that if I could not comply with his Desire we should be both Ruin'd Then he told me the whole Story between  Robin  as he call'd him and his Mother and Sisters and himself as it is above And now dear Child  says he  consider what it will be to Marry a Gentleman of a good Family in good Circumstances and with the Consent of the whole House and to enjoy all that the World can give you And what on the other Hand to be sunk into the dark Circumstances of a Woman that has lost her Reputation and that tho' I shall be a private Friend to you while I live yet as I shall be suspected always so you will be afraid to see me and I shall be afraid to own you  HE gave me no time to Reply but went on with me thus What has happen'd between us Child so long as we both agree to do so may be buried and forgotten I shall always be your sincere Friend without any Inclination to nearer Intimacy when you become my Sister and we shall have all the honest part of Conversation without any Reproaches between us of having done amiss I beg of you to consider it and do not stand in the way of your own Safety and Prosperity  and to satisfie you that I am Sincere  added he  I here offer you  l  in Money to make you some Amends for the Freedoms I have taken with you which we shall look upon as some of the Follies of our Lives which 'tis hop'd we may Repent of  HE spoke this in so much more moving Terms than it is possible for me to Express and with so much greater force of Argument than I can repeat That I only recommend it to those who Read the Story to suppose that as he held me above an Hour and Half in that Discourse so he answer'd all my Objections and fortified his Discourse with all the Arguments that humane Wit and Art could Devise  I cannot say however that any thing he said made Impression enough upon me so as to give me any thought of the Matter till he told me at last very plainly that if I refus'd he was sorry to add that he could never go on with me in that Station as we stood before that tho' he Lov'd me as well as ever and that I was as agreeable to him as ever yet Sense of Vertue had not so far forsaken him as to suffer him to lye with a Woman that his Brother Courted to make his Wife and if he took his leave of me with a denial in this Affair whatever he might do for me in the Point of support grounded on his first Engagement of maintaining me yet he would not have me be surpriz'd that he was oblig'd to tell me he could not allow himself to see me any more and that indeed I could not expect it of him  I  receiv'd this last part with some tokens of Surprize and Disorder and had much a do to avoid sinking down for indeed I lov'd him to an Extravagance  not easie to imagine but he perceiv'd my Disorder he entreated me to consider seriously of it assur'd me that it was the only way to Preserve our mutual Affection that in this Station we might love as Friends with the utmost Passion and with a love of Relation untainted free from our just Reproaches and free from other Peoples Suspicions that he should ever acknowledge his happiness owing to me that he would be Debtor to me as long as he liv'd and would be paying that Debt as long as he had Breath Thus he wrought me up in short to a kind of Hesitation in the Matter having the Dangers on one Side represented in lively Figures and indeed heightn'd by my Imagination of being turn'd out to the wide World a meer cast off Whore  for it was no less  and perhaps expos'd as such with little to provide for myself with no Friend no Acquaintance in the whole World  out of that Town  and there I could not pretend to stay all this terrify'd me to the last Degree and he took care upon all Occasions to lay it home to me in the worst Colours that it could be possible to be drawn in on the other Hand he fail'd not to set forth the easy prosperous Life which I was going to live  HE answer'd all that I could object from Affection and from former Engagements with telling me the Necessity that was before us of taking other Measures now and as to his Promises of Marriage the nature of things  he said  had put an End to that by the probability of my being his Brothers Wife before the time to which his Promises all referr'd  THUS in a Word I may say he Reason'd me out of my Reason he conquer'd all my Arguments  and I began to see a Danger that I was in which I had not consider'd of before and that was of being drop'd by both of them and left alone in the World to shift for myself  THIS and his perswasion at length Prevail'd with me to Consent tho' with so much Reluctance that it was easie to see I should go to Church like a Bear to the Stake I had some little Apprehensions about me too least my new Spouse who by the way I had not the least Affection for should he be skilful enough to Challenge me on another Account upon our first coming to Bed together but whether he did it with Design or not I know not but his elder Brother took care to make him very much Fuddled before he went to Bed so that I had the Satisfaction of a drunken Bedfellow the first Night How he did it I know not but I concluded that he certainly contiriv'd it that his Brother might be able to make no Judgment off the difference between a Maid and a married Woman nor did he ever Entertain any Notions of it or disturb his Thoughts about it  I should go back a little here to where I left off the elder Brother having thus manag'd me his next business was to Manage his Mother and he never left till he had brought her to acquiesce and be passive in the thing Even without acquainting the Father other than by Post Letters So that she consented to our Marrying privately and leaving her to manage the Father afterwards  THEN he Cajol'd with his Brother and perswaded him what Service he had done him and how he had brought his Mother to Consent which  tho' True  was not indeed done to serve him but to serve himself but thus diligently did he cheat him and had the Thanks of a faithful Friend for  shifting off his Whore into his Brothers Arms for a Wife So certainly does Interest banish all manner of Affection and so naturally do Men give up Honour and Justice Humanity and even Christianity to secure themselves  I must now come back to Brother  Robin  as we always call'd him who having got his Mother's Consent  as above  came big with the News to me and told me the whole Story of it with a Sincerity so visible that I must confess it griev'd me that I must be the Instrument to abuse so honest a Gentleman but there was no Remedy he would have me and I was not oblig'd to tell him that I was his Brother's Whore tho' I had no other way to put him off so I came gradually into it to his Satisfaction and behold we were Married  MODESTY forbids me to reveal the Secrets of the Marriage Bed but nothing could have happen'd more suitable to my Circumstances than that  as above  my Husband was so Fuddled when he came to Bed that he could not remember in the Morning whether he had any Conversation with me or no and I was oblig'd to tell him  he had  tho' in reallity  he had not  that I might be sure he could make no enquiry about any thing else  IT concerns the Story in hand very little to enter into the farther particulars of the Family or of myself for the five Years that I liv'd with this Husband only to observe that I had two Children by him and that at the end of five Year he Died He had been really a very good Husband to me and we liv'd very agreeably together But as he had not receiv'd much from them and had in the little time he liv'd acquir'd no great Matters so my Circumstances were not great nor was I  much mended by the Match Indeed I had preserv'd the elder Brother's Bonds to me to pay me  l  which he offer'd me for my Consent to Marry his Brother and this with what I had saved of the Money he formerly gave me and about as much more by my Husband left me a Widow with about  l  in my Pocket  MY two Children were indeed taken happily off of my Hands by my Husband's Father and Mother and that by the way was all they got by Mrs  Betty    I confess I was not suitably affected with the loss of my Husband nor indeed can I say that I ever Lov'd him as I ought to have done or as was proportionable to the good Usage I had from him for he was a tender kind good humour'd Man as any Woman could desire but his Brother being so always in my sight at  least  while we were in the Country was a continual Snare to me and I never was in Bed with my Husband but I wish'd my self in the Arms of his Brother and tho' his Brother never offer'd me the least Kindness that way after our Marriage but carried it just as a Brother ought to do yet it was impossible for me to do so to him In short I committed Adultery and Incest with him every Day in my Desires which without doubt was as effectually Criminal in the Nature of the Guilt as if I had actually done it  BEFORE my Husband Died his elder Brother was Married and we being then remov'd to  London  were written to by the old Lady to come and be at the Wedding my Husband went but I pretended Indisposition and that I could not possibly Travel so I staid behind for in short I could not bear the sight of his being given to another Woman tho' I knew I was never to have him my self  I was now  as above  left loose to the World and being still Young and Handsome as every body said of me  and I assure you I thought my self so  and with a tollerable Fortune in my Pocket I put no small value upon my self I was Courted by several very considerable Tradesmen and particularly very warmly by one a  LinnenDraper  at whose House after my Husband's Death I took a Lodging his Sister being my Acquaintance here I had all the Liberty and all the Opportunity to be Gay and appear in Company that I could desire my Landlord's Sister being one of the Madest Gayest things alive and not so much Mistress of her Vertue as I thought at first she had been She brought me into a World of wild Company and even brought home several Persons  such as she lik'd well enough to Gratifie  to see her pretty Widow  so she was pleas'd to call me  and that Name I got in a little time in Publick now as Fame and Fools make an Assembly I was here wonderfully Caress'd had abundance of Admirers and such as call'd themselves  Lovers  but I found not one fair Proposal among them all as for their common Design that I understood too well to be drawn into any more Snares of that Kind The Case was alter'd with me I had Money in my Pocket and had nothing to say to them I had been trick'd once by  that Cheat  call'd LOVE but the Game was over I was resolv'd now to be Married or Nothing and to be well Married or not at all  I lov'd the Company indeed of Men of Mirth and Wit Men of Gallantry and Figure and was often entertain'd with such as I was also with others but I found by just Observation that the brightest Men came upon the dullest Errand  that is  to say  the Dullest as to what I aim'd at on the other Hand those who came with the best Proposals were the Dullest and most disagreeable Part of the World I was not averse to a Tradesman but then I would have a Tradesman forsooth that was something of a Gentleman too that when my Husband had a mind to carry me to the Court or to the Play he might become a Sword and look as like a Gentleman as another Man and not be one that had the mark of his Apronstrings upon his Coat or the mark of his Hat upon his Perriwig that should look as if he was set on to his Sword when his Sword was put on to him and that carried his Trade in his Countenance  WELL at last I found this amphibious Creature this  Landwaterthing  call'd a  GentlemanTradesman  and as a just Plague upon my Folly I was catch'd in the very Snare which  as I might say  I laid for my self  I say laid for my self  for I was not Trepan'd I confess but I betray'd my self  THIS was a  Draper  too for tho' my Comrade would have brought me to a Bargain with her Brother yet when it came to the Point it was it seems for a Mistress not a Wife and I kept true to this Notion that a Woman should never be kept for a Mistress that had Money to keep her self  THUS my Pride not my Principle my Money not my Vertue kept me Honest tho' as it prov'd I found I had much better have been Sold by my  She Comrade  to her Brother than have Sold my self as I did to a Tradesman that was Rake Gentleman Shop keeper and Beggar all together  BUT I was hurried on by my Fancy to a Gentleman to Ruin my self in the grossess Manner  that ever Woman did for my new Husband coming to a lump of Money at once fell into such a profusion of Expence that all I had and all he had before if he had any thing worth mentioning would not have held it out above one Year  HE was very fond of me for about a quarter of a Year and what I got by that was that I had the pleasure of seeing a great deal of my Money spent upon my self and as I may say had some of the spending it too Come my dear  says be to me one Day  Shall we go and take a turn into the Country for about a Week Ay my Dear  says I  Whether would you go I care not whether  says he  but I have a mind to look like Quality for a Week we'll go to OXFORD  says he  How  says I  shall we go I am no Horse Woman and 'tis too far for a Coach too far  says he  no Place is too far for a Coach and Six If I carry you out you shall Travel like a Dutchess hum  says I  my Dear 'tis a Frolick but if you have a mind to it I don't care Well the time was appointed we had a rich Coach very good Horses a Coachman Postilion and two Footmen in very good Liveries a Gentleman on Horseback and a Page with a Feather in his Hat upon another Horse The Servants all call'd him my Lord and the InnKeepers you may be sure did the like and I was  her Honour  the Countess and thus we Travel'd to OXFORD and a very pleasant Journey we had for give him his due not a Beggar alive knew better how to be a Lord than my Husband We saw all the Rareties at OXFORD talk'd with two or three Fellows of Colleges about putting out a young Nephew that was left to his Lordship's Care to the University and of their being his Tutors we diverted our selves with bantering several other poor Scholars  with hopes of being at least his Lordship's Chaplains and putting on a Scarf and thus having liv'd like Quality indeed as to Expence we went away for  Northampton  and in a word in about twelve Days ramble came Home again to the Tune of about  l  Expence  VANITY is the perfection of a Fop my Husband had this Excellence that he valued nothing of Expence and as his History you may be sure has very little weight in it 'tis enough to tell you that in about two Years and a Quarter he Broke and was not so happy to get over into the  Mint  but got into a  SpungingHouse  being Arrested in an Action too heavy for him to give Bail to so he sent for me to come to him  IT was no surprize to me for I had foreseen  sometime  that all was going to Wreck and had been taking care to reserve something if I could  tho' it was not much  for myself But when he sent for me he behav'd much better than I expected and told me plainly he had plaid the Fool and suffer'd himself to be Surpriz'd which he might have prevented that now he foresaw he could not stand it and therefore he would have me go Home and in the Night take away every thing I had in the House of any Value and secure it and after that he told me that if I could get away  l  or  l  in Goods out of the Shop I should do it only  says he  let me know nothing of it neither what you take or whether you carry it for as for me  says he  I am resolv'd to get out of this House and be gone and if you never hear of me more my Dear  says he  I wish you well I am only sorry for the Injury I have done you He said some very handsome Things to me indeed at Parting for  I told you  he was a  Gentleman  and that  was all the benefit I had of his being so that he used me very handsomely and with good Manners upon all Occasions even to the last only spent all I had and left me to Rob the Creditors for something to Subsist on  HOWEVER I did as he bad me  that you may be sure  and having thus taken my leave of him I never saw him more for he found means to break out of the Bailiff's House that Night or the next and got over into  France  and for the rest the Creditors scrambl'd for it as well as they could How I knew not for I could come at no Know+ledge of any thing more than this that he came Home about three a Clock in the Morning caus'd the rest of his Goods to be remov'd into the  Mint  and the Shop to be shut up and having rais'd what Money he could get together he got over as I said to  France  from whence I had one or two Letters from him and no more  I did not see him when he came Home for he having given me such Instructions as above and I having made the best of my Time I had no more Business back again at the House not knowing but I might have been stop'd there by the Creditors for a  Commission of Bankrupt  being soon after Issued they might have stop'd me by Orders from the  Commissioners  But my Husband having so dextrously got out of the Bailiff's House by letting himself down in a most desperate Manner from almost the top of the House to the top of another Building and leaping from thence which was almost two Stories and which was enough indeed to have broken his Neck He came home and got away his Goods before the Creditors could come to Seize  that is to say  before  they could get out the Commission and be ready to send their Officers to take Possession  MY Husband was so civil to me  for still I say he was much of a Gentleman  that in the first Letter he wrote me from  France  he let me know where he had Pawn'd Pieces of fine  Holland  for  l  which were really worth above  l  and enclos'd me the Token and an order for the taking them up paying the Money which I did and made in time above  l  of them having Leisure to cut them and sell them some and some to private Families as opportunity offer'd  HOWEVER with all this and all that I had secur'd before I found upon casting things up my Case was very much alter'd and my Fortune much lessen'd for including the Hollands and a parcel of fine Muslins which I carry'd off before and some Plate and other things I found I could hardly muster up  l  and my Condition was very odd for tho' I had no Child  I had had one by my Gentleman  Draper  but it was buried  yet I was a Widow bewitch'd I had a Husband and no Husband and I could not pretend to Marry again tho' I knew well enough my Husband would never see  England  anymore if he liv'd fifty Years  Thus I say  I was limitted from Marriage what Offer soever might be made me▪ and I had not one Friend to advise with in the Condition I was in at least not one I durst Trust the Secret of my Circmustances to for if the Commissioners were to have been inform'd where I was I should have been fetch'd up and examin'd upon Oath and all I had sav'd be taken away from me  UPON these Apprehensions the first thing I did was to go quite out of my Knowledge and go by another Name This I did effectually for I  went into the  Mint  too took Lodgings in a very private Place drest me up in the Habit of a Widow and call'd myself Mrs  Flanders    HERE however I conceal'd myself and tho' my new Acquaintances knew nothing of me yet I soon got a great deal of Company about me and whether it be that Women are scarce among the Sorts of People that generally are to be found there or that some Consolation in the Miseries of the Place are more Requisite than on other Occasions I soon found an agreeable Woman was exccedingly valuable among the Sons of Affliction there and that those that wanted Money to pay Half a Crown in the Pound to their Creditors and that run in Debt at the Sign of the  Bull  for their Dinners would yet find Money for a Supper if they lik'd the Woman  HOWEVER I kept myself Safe yet tho' I began like my Lord  Rochester's  Mistress that lov'd his Company but would not admit him farther to have the Scandal of a Whore without the Joy and upon this score tir'd with the Place and indeed with the Company too I began to think of Removing  IT was indeed a Subject of strange Reflection to me to see Men who were overwhelm'd in perplex'd Circumstances who were reduc'd some Degrees below being Ruin'd whose Families were Objects of their own Terror and other Peoples Charity yet while a Penny lasted nay even beyond it endeavouring to drown their Sorrow in their Wickedness heaping up more Guilt upon themselves labouring to forget former things which now it was the proper time to remember making more Work for Repentance and Sinning on as a Remedy for Sin past  BUT it is none of my Talent to preach these Men were too wicked even for me there was something horrid and absurd in their way of Sinning for it was all a Force even upon themselves they did not only act against Conscience but against Nature they put a Rape upon their Temper to drown the Reflections which their Circumstances continually gave them and nothing was more easie than to see how Sighs would interrupt their Songs and paleness and anguish sit upon their Brows in spight of the forc'd Smiles they put on nay sometimes it would break out at their very Mouths when they had parted with their Money for a lewd Treat or a wicked Embrace I have heard them turning about fetch a deep Sigh and cry  what a Dog am I  Well  Betty  my Dear I'll drink thy Health tho'  meaning the Honest Wife  that perhaps had not a Half a Crown for herself and three or four Children The next Morning they are at their Penitentials again and perhaps the poor weeping Wife comes over to him either brings him some Account of what his Creditors are doing and how she and the Children are turn'd out of Doors or some other dreadful News and this adds to his self Reproaches but when he has Thought and Por'd on it till he is almost Mad having no Principles to Support him nothing within him or above him to Comfort him but finding it all Darkness on every Side he flyes to the same Relief again  viz  to Drink it away Debauch it away and falling into Company of Men in just the same Condition with himself he repeats the Crime and thus he goes every Day one Step onward of his way to Destruction  I was not wicked enough for such Fellows as these  yet  on the contrary I began to consider here  very seriously  what I had to do how things stood with me and what Course I ought to take I knew I had no Friends no not one Friend or Relation in the World and that little I had left apparently wasted which when it was gone I saw nothing but Misery and Starving was before me Upon these Considerations I say and fill'd with Horror at the Place I was in and the dreadful Objects which I had always before me  I resolv'd to be gone    I had made an Acquaintance with a very sober good sort of a Woman who was a Widow too like me but in better Circumstances her Husband had been a Captain of a Merchant Ship and having had the Misfortune to be Cast away coming Home on a Voyage from the  WestIndies  which would have been very profitable if he had come safe was so reduc'd by the Loss that tho' he had saved his Life then it broke his Heart and kill'd him afterwards and his Widow being persued by the Creditors was forc'd to take Shelter in the  Mint  She soon made things up with the help of Friends and was at Liberty again and finding that I rather was there to be conceal'd than by any particular Prosecutions and finding also that I agreed with her  or rather she with me  in a just Abhorrence of the Place and of the Company she invited me to go Home with her till I could put myself in some posture of settling in the World to my Mind withal telling me that it was ten to one but some good Captain of a Ship might take a Fancy to me and Court me in that part of the Town where she liv'd  I accepted her offer and was with her Half a Year and should have been longer but in that interval what she propos'd to me happen'd to herself and she marry'd very much to her Advantage but whose Fortune soever was upon the Encrease mine seem'd to be upon the Wane and I found nothing present except two or three Boatswains or such Fellows but as for the Commanders they were generally of two Sorts Such as having good Business  that is to say  a good Ship resolv'd not to Marry but with Advantage that is with good a Fortune Such as being out of Employ wanted a Wife to help them to a Ship I mean A Wife who having some Money could enable them to hold as they call it a good part of a Ship themselves so to encourage Owners to come in Or A Wife who if she had not Money had Friends who were concern'd in Shipping and so could help to put the young Man into good Ship which to them is as good as a Portion and neither of these was my Case so I look'd like one that was to  lye on Hand    THIS Knowledge I soon learnt by Experience  viz  That the State of things was altered as to Matrimony and that I was not to expect at  London  what I had found in the Country that Marriages were here the Consequences of politick Schemes for forming Interests and carring on Business and that LOVE had no Share or but very little in the Matter  THAT as my Sister in Law at  Colchester  had said Beauty Wit Manners Sence good Humour good Behaviour Education Vertue Piety or any other Qualification whether of Body or Mind had no power to recomend That Money only  made a Woman agreeable That Men chose Mistresses indeed by the gust of their Affection and it was requisite to a Whore to be Handsome well shap'd have a good Mein and a graceful Behaviour but that for a Wife no Deformity would shock the Fancy no ill Qualities the Judgement the Money was the thing the Portion was neither crooked or Monstrous but the Money was always agreeable whatever the Wife was  ON the other Hand as the Market run very Unhappily on the Mens side I found the Women had lost the Privilege of saying No that it was a Favour now for a Woman to have THE QUESTION ask'd and if any young Lady had so much Arrogance as to Counterfeit a Negative she never had the Opportunity given her of denying twice much less of Recovering that false Step and accepting what she had but seem'd to decline The Men had such Choice every where that the Case of the Women was very unhapy for they seem'd to Plie at every Door and if the Man was by great Chance refus'd at one House he was sure to be receiv'd at the next  BESIDES this I observ'd that the Men made no scruple to set themselves out and to go a Fortune Hunting  as they call it  when they had really no Fortune themselves to Demand it or Merit to deserve it and That they carry'd it so high that a Woman was scarce allow'd to enquire after the Character or Estate of the Person that pretended to her This I had an Example of in a young Lady at the next House to me and with whom I had Contracted an intimacy she was Courted by a young Captain and though she had near  l  to her Fortune she did but enquire of some of his Neighbours about his Character his  Morals or Substance and he took Occasion at the next Visit to let her know truly that he took it very ill and that he should not give her the Trouble of his Visits any more I heard of it and as I had begun my Acquaintance with her I went to see her upon it Se enter'd into a close Conversation with me about it and unbosom'd herself very freely I perceiv'd presently that tho' she thought herself very ill us'd yet she had no power to resent it and was exceedingly Piqu'd that she had lost him and particularly that another of less Fortune had gain'd him  I fortify'd her Mind against such a Meanness  as I call'd it  I told her that as low as I was in the World I would have despis'd a Man that should think I ought to take him upon his own Recommendation only without having the liberty to inform myself of his Fortune and of his Character also  I told her  that as she had a good Fortune she had no need to stoop to the Dissaster of the times that it was enough that the Men could insult us that had but little Money to recommend us but if she suffer'd such an Affront to pass upon her without Resenting it she would be render'd lowpriz'd upon all Occasions and would be the Contempt of all the Women in that part of the Town that a Woman can never want an Opportunity to be Reveng'd of a Man that has us'd her ill and that there were ways enough to humble such a Fellow as that or else certainly Women were the most unhappy Creatures in the World  I found she was very well pleas'd with the Discourse and she told me seriously that she would be very glad to make him sensible of her just Resentment and either to bring him on again or  have the Satisfaction of her Revenge being as publick as possible  I told her  that if she would take my Advice I would tell her how she should obtain her Wishes in both those things and that I would engage I would bring the Man to her Door again and make him beg to be let in  She smil'd at that  and soon let me see that if he came to her Door her Resentment was not so great as to give her leave to let him stand long there  HOWEVER she lissened very willingly to my offer of Advice so  I told her  that the first thing she ought to do was a piece of Justice to herself namely that whereas she had been told by several People that he had reported among the Ladies that he had left her and pretended to give the Advantage of the Negative to himself she should take care to have it well spread among the Women which she could not fail of an Opportunity to do in a Neighbourhood so addicted to Family News as that she liv'd in was that she had enquired into his Circumstances and found he was not the Man as to Estate he pretended to be Let them be told Madam  said I  that you had been well inform'd that he was not the Man that you expected and that you thought it was not safe to meddle with him that you heard he was of an ill Temper▪ and that he boasted how he had us'd the Women ill upon many Occasions and that particularly he was Debauch'd in his Morals  c  The last of which indeed had some Truth in it but at the same time I did not find that she seem'd to like him much the worse for that part  AS I had put this into her Head she came most readily into it immediately she went to Work to find Instruments and she had very little difficulty in the Search for telling her Story in general to a Couple of Gossips in the Neighbourhood it was the Chat of the Tea Table all over that part of the Town and I met with it where ever I visited Also as it was known that I was Acquainted with the young Lady herself my Opinion was ask'd very often and I confirm'd it with all the necessary Aggravations and set out his Character in the blackest Colours but then as a piece of secret Intelligence I added as what the other Gossips knew nothing of  viz  That I had heard he was in very bad Circumstances that he was under a Necessity of a Fortune to support his Interest with the Owners of the Ship he Commanded That his own Part was not paid for and if it was not paid quickly his Owners would put him out of the Ship and his Chief Mate was likely to Command it who offer'd to buy that Part which the Captain had promis'd to take  I added  for I confess I was heartily piqu'd at the Rogue  as I call'd him  that I had heard a Rumour too that he had a Wife alive at  Plymouth  and another in the  West Indies  a thing which they all knew was not very uncommon for such kind of Gentlemen  THIS work'd as we both desir'd it for presently the young Lady at next Door  who had a Father and Mother that Govern'd both her and her Fortue  was shut up and her Father forbid him the House Also in one Place more where he went the Woman had the Courage  however strange it was  to say No and he could try no where but he was Reproached with his Pride and that he pretended not to  give the Women leave to enquire into his Character  and the like    WELL by this time he began to be sensible of his mistake and having allarm'd all the Women on that side the Water he went over to  Ratcliff  and got access to some of the Ladies there but tho' the young Women there too were according to the Fate of the Day pretty willing to be ask'd yet such was his ill luck that his Character follow'd him over the Water and his good Name was much the same there as it was on our side so that tho' he might have had Wives enough yet it did not happen among the Women that had good Fortunes which was what he wanted  BUT this was not all she very ingeniously manag'd another thing her self for she got a young Gentleman who was a Relation and was indeed a marry'd Man to come and visit her Two or Three times a Week in a very fine Chariot and good Liveries and her Two Agents and I also presently spread a Report all over that this Gentleman came to Court her that he was a Gentleman of a Thousand Pounds a Year and that he was fallen in Love with her and that she was going to her Aunt's in the City because it was inconvenient for the Gentleman to come to her with his Coach in  Redriff  the Streets being so narrow and difficult  THIS took immediately the Captain was laugh'd at in all Companies and was ready to hang himself he tryed all the ways possible to come at her again and wrote the most passionate Letters to her in the World excusing his former Rashness and in short by great Application obtained leave to wait on her again  as he said  to clear his Reputation  AT this meeting she had her full Revenge of him for  she told him  she wondred what he took her to be that she should admit any Man to a Treaty of so much Consequence as that of Marriage without enquiring very well into his Circumstances that if he thought she was to be huff'd into Wedlock and that she was in the same Circumstances which her Neighbours might be in  viz  to take up with the first good Christian that came he was mistaken that in a word his Character was really bad or he was very ill beholding to his Neighbours and that unless he could clear up some Points in which she had justly been Prejudiced she had no more to say to him but to do herself Justice and give him the Satisfaction of knowing that she was not afraid to say NO either to him or any Man else  WITH that she told him what she had heard  or rather rais'd herself by my means of his Character  his not having paid for the Part he pretended to Own of the Ship he Commanded of the Resolution of his Owners to put him out of the Command and to put his Mate in his stead and of the Scandal rais'd on his Morals his having been reproach'd with such and such Women and his having a Wife at  Plymouth  and in the  WestIndies and the like  and she ask'd him whether he could deny that she had good Reason if these things were not clear'd up to refuse him and in the mean time to insist upon having Satisfaction in Points so significant as they were  HE was so confounded at her Discourse that he could not answer a word and she almost began to believe that all was true by his disorder tho' at the same time she knew that she had been the raiser of all those Reports herself  AFTER some time he recover'd himself a little and from that time became the most humble the most modest and most importunate Man alive in his Courtship  SHE carried her jest on a great way she ask'd him if he thought she was so at her last shift that she could or ought to bear such Treatment and if he did not see that she did not want those who thought it worth their while to come farther to her than he did meaning the Gentleman who she had brought to visit her by way of sham  SHE brought him by these tricks to submit to all possible measures to satisfie her as well of his Circumstances as of his Behaviour He brought her undeniable Evidence of his having paid for his part of the Ship he brought her Certificates from his Owners that the Report of their intending to remove him from the Command of the Ship and put his chief Mate in was false and groundless in short he was quite the reverse of what he was before  THUS I convinc'd her that if the Men made their Advantage of our Sex in the Affair of Marriage upon the supposition of there being such Choice to be had and of the Women being so easie it was only owing to this that the Women wanted Courage to maintain their Ground and to play their Part and that according to my Lord  Rochester    "A Woman's ne'er so ruin'd but she can  "Revenge herself on her undoer Man  AFTER these things this young Lady plaid her part so well that tho' she resolved to have him and that indeed having him was the main  bent of her design yet she made his obtaining her be TO HIM the most difficult thing in the World and this she did not by a haughty Reserv'd Carriage but by a just Policy turning the Tables upon him and playing back upon him his own Game for as he pretended by a kind of lofty Carriage to place himself above the occasion of a Character and to make enquiring into his Character a kind of an affront to him she broke with him upon that Subject and at the same time that she made him submit to all possible enquiry after his Affairs she apparently shut the Door against his looking into her own  IT was enough to him to obtain her for a Wife as to what she had she told him plainly that as he knew her Circumstances it was but just she should know his and tho' at the same time he had only known her Circumstances by common Fame yet he had made so many Protestations of his Passion for her that he could ask no more but her Hand to his grand Request  and the like ramble according to the Custom of Lovers  In short he left himself no room to ask any more questions about her Estate and she took the advantage of it like a prudent Woman for she plac'd part of her Fortune so in Trustees without letting him know any thing of it that it was quite out of his reach and made him be very well content with the rest  IT is true she was pretty well besides that is to say she had about  l  in Money which she gave him and the other after some time she brought to light as a perquisite to her self which he was to accept as a mighty Favour seeing though it was not to be his it might case him in the Article of her particular Expences and I  must add that by this Conduct the Gentleman himself became not only the more humble in his Applications to her to obtain her but also was much the more an obliging Husband to her when he had her I cannot but remind the Ladies here how much they place themselves below the common Station of a Wife which if I may be allow'd not to be Partial is low enough already  I say  they place themselves below their common Station and prepare their own Mortifications by their submitting so to be insulted by the Men beforehand which I confess I see no Necessity of  THIS Relation may serve therefore to let the Ladies see that the Advantage is not so much on the other Side as the Men think it is and tho' it may be true that the Men have but too much Choice among us and that some Women may be found who will dishonour themselves be Cheap and Easy to come at and will scarce wait to be ask'd yet if they will have Women  as I may say  worth having they may find them as uncomatable as ever and that those that are otherwise are a Sort of People that have such Defficiencies  when had  as rather recommend the Ladies that are Difficult than encourage the Men to go on with their easie Courtship and expect Wives equally valluable that will come at first call  NOTHING is more certain than that the Ladies always gain of the Men by keeping their Ground and letting their pretended Lovers see they can Resent being slighted and that they are not affraid of saying No They I observe insult us mightily with telling us of the Number of Women that the Wars and the Sea and Trade  and other Incidents have carried the Men so much away that there is no Proportion between the Numbers of the Sexes and therefore the Women have the Disadvantage but I am far from Granting that the Number of the Women is so great or the Number of the Men so small but if they will have me tell the Truth the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon the Men and it lyes here and here only  Namely  that the Age is so Wicked and the Sex so Debauch'd that in short the Number of such Men as an honest Woman ought to meddle with is small indeed and it is but here and there that a Man is to be found who is fit for a Woman to venture upon  BUT the Consequence even of that too amounts to no more than this that Women ought to be the more Nice For how do we know the just Character of the Man that makes the offer To say that the Woman should be the more easie on this Occasion is to say we should be the forwarder to venture because of the greatness of the Danger which in my way of Reasoning is very absurd  ON the contrary the Women have ten Thousand times the more Reason to be wary and backward by how much the hazard of being betray'd is the greater and would the Ladies consider this and act the wary Part they would discover every Cheat that offer'd for  in short  the Lives of very few Men now aDays will bear a Character and if the Ladies do but make a little Enquiry they will soon be able to distinguish the Men and deliver themselves As for Women that do not think their own Safety worth their Thought that impatient of their present  State resolve  as they call it  to take the first good Christian that comes that runs into Matrimony as a Horse rushes into the Battle I can say nothing to them but this that they are a Sort of Ladies that are to be pray'd for among the rest of distemper'd People and to me they look like People that venture their whole Estates in a Lottery where there is a Hundred Thousand Blanks to one Prize  NO Man of common Sense will value a Woman the less for not giving up herself at the first Attack or for accepting his Proposal without enquiring into his Person or Character on the contrary he must think her the weakest of all Creatures in the World as the Rate of Men now goes In short he must have a very contemptible Opinion of her Capacities nay even of her Understanding that having but one Cast for her Life shall cast that Life away at once and make Matrimony like Death be  a Leap in the Dark    I would fain have the Conduct of my Sex a little Regulated in this particular which is the Thing in which of all the parts of Life I think at this Time we suffer most in 'Tis nothing but lack of Courage the fear of not being Marry'd at all and of that frightful State of Life call'd  an old Maid  of which I have a Story to tell by itself This I say is the Woman's Snare but would the Ladies once but get above that Fear and manage rightly they would more certainly avoid it by standing their Ground in a Case so absolutely Necessary to their Felicity than by exposing themselves as they do and if they did not Marry so soon as they may do otherwise they would make themselves amends by Marrying safer she is always Married too soon who gets a bad Husband  and she is never Married too late who gets a good one In a Word there is no Woman  Deformity or lost Reputation excepted  but if she manages well may be Marry'd safely one time or other but if she Precipates herself it is ten Thousand to one but she is undone  BUT I come now to my own Case in which there was at this time no little Nicety The Circumstances I was in made the offer of a good Husband the most necessary Thing in the World to me but I found soon that to be made Cheap and Easy was not the way It soon began to be found that the Widow had no Fortune and to say this was to say all that was Ill of me for I began to be dropt in all the Discourses of Matrimony Being well Bred Handsome Witty Modest and agreeable all which I had allowed to my Character whether justly or no is not to the Purpose I say all these would not do without the Dross which was now become more valuable than Virtue itself In short  the Widow  they said  had no Money    I resolv'd therefore as to the State of my present Circumstances that it was absolutely Necessary to change my Station and make a new Appearance in some other Place where I was not known and even to pass by another Name if I found Occasion  I Communicated my Thoughts to my intimate Friend the Captain's Lady who I had so faithfully serv'd in her Case with the Captain and who was as ready to serve me in the same kind as I could desire I made no scruple to lay my Circumstances open to her my Stock was but low for I had made but about  l  at the Close of my last Affair and I had wasted some of that However I had about  l  lest a great many  very rich Cloaths a gold Watch and some Jewels tho' of no extraordinary value and about or  l  left in Linnen not dispos'd of  MY Dear and faithful Friend the Captain's Wife was so sensible of the Service I had done her in the Affair above that she was not only a steddy Friend to me but knowing my Circumstances she frequently made me Presents as Money came into her Hands such as fully amounted to a Maintenance so that I spent none of my own and at last she made this unhappy Proposal to me  viz  that as we had observ'd  as above  how the Men made no scruple to set themselves out as Persons meriting a Woman of Fortune when they had really no Fortune of their own it was but just to deal with them in their own way and if it was possible to Deceive the Deceiver  THE Captain's Lady in short put this Project into my Head and told me if I would be rul'd by her I should certainly get a Husband of Fortune without leaving him any room to Reproach me with want of my own I told her as I had Reason to do That I would give up myself wholly to her Directions and that I would have neither Tongue to speak or Feet to step in that Affair but as she should direct me depending that she would Extricate one out of every Difficulty that she brought me into which she said she would Answer for  THE first step she put me upon was to call her Cousin and go to a Relations House of hers in the Country where she directed me and where she brought her Husband to visit me and calling me Cousin she work'd Matters so about that her Husband and she together Invited me most passionately  to come to Town and be with them for they now liv'd in a quite different Place from where they were before In the next Place she tells her Husband that I had at least  l  Fortune and that after some of my Relations I was like to have a great deal more  IT was enough to tell her Husband this there needed nothing on my Side I was but to sit still and wait the Event for it presently went all over the Neighbourhood that the young Widow at Captain s was a Fortune that she had at least  l  and perhaps a great deal more and  that the Captain said so  and if the Captain was ask'd at any time about me he made no scruple to affirm it tho' he knew not one Word of the Matter other than that his Wife had told him so and in this he thought no Harm for he really believ'd it to be so because he had it from his Wife▪ so slender a Foundation will those Fellows build upon if they do but think there is a Fortune in the Game With the Reputation of this Fortune I presently found myself bless'd with admirers enough and that I had my Choice of Men as scarce as they said they were  which by the way confirms what I was saying before  This being my Case I who had a subtile Game to play had nothing now to do but to single out from them all the properest Man that might be for my Purpose  that is to say  the Man who was most likely to depend upon the  hear say  of a Fortune and not enquire too far into the particulars and unless I did this  I did nothing  for my Case would not bare much Enquiry  I Pick'd out my Man without much difficulty by the judgement I made of his way of Courting me I had let him run on with his Protestations and  Oaths that he lov'd me above all the World that if I would make him happy that was enough all which I knew was upon Supposition nay it was upon a full Satisfaction that I was very Rich tho' I never told him a Word of it myself  THIS was my Man but I was to try him to the bottom and indeed in that consisted my Safety for if he baulk'd I knew I was undone as surely as he was undone if he took me and if I did not make some scruple about his Fortune it was the way to lead him to raise some about mine and first therefore I pretended on all occasions to doubt his Sincerity and told him perhaps he only courted me for my Fortune he stop'd my Mouth in that part with the Thunder of his Protestations  as above  but still I pretended to doubt  ONE Morning he pulls off his Diamond Ring and writes upon the Glass of the Sash in my Chamber this Line  You I Love and you alone  I read it and ask'd him to lend me his Ring with which I wrote under it thus  And so in Love says every one  He takes his Ring again and writes another Line thus  Virtue alone is an Estate  I borrow'd it again and I wrote under it  But Money's Vertue Gold is Fate  He colour'd as red as Fire to see me turn so quick upon him and in a kind of a Rage told me he would Conquer me and writes again  thus    I scorn your Gold and yet I Love  I ventur'd all upon the last cast of Poetry as you'll see for I wrote boldly under his last  I'm Poor Let's see how kind you'll prove  This was a sad Truth to me whether he believ'd me or no I cou'd not tell I supposed then that he did not However he flew to me took me in his Arms and kissing me very eagerly and with the greatest Passion imaginable he held me fast till he call'd for a Pen and Ink and then  told me  he could not wait the tedious writing on the Glass but pulling out a piece of Paper he began and wrote again  Be mine with all your Poverty  I took his Pen and follow'd him immediately thus  Yet secretly you hope I lie  HE told me that was unkind because it was not just and that I put him upon contradicting me which did not consist with good Manners any more than with his Affection and therefore since I had insensibly drawn him into this poetical scribble he beg'd I would not oblige him to break it off so he writes again  Let Love alone be our Debate  I wrote again  She Loves enough that does not hate  This he took for a favour and so laid down the Cudgels that is to say the Pen I say he took it for a favour and a mighty one it was if he had known all However he took it as I meant it  that is to let him think I was inclin'd to go on with him as indeed I had all the Reason in the World to do for he was the best humoured merry sort of a Fellow that I ever met with and I often reflected on my self how doubly criminal it was to deceive such a Man but that Necessity which press'd me to a Settlement suitable to my Condition was my Authority for it and certainly his Affection to me and the Goodness of his Temper however they might argue against using him ill yet they strongly argued to me that he would better take the Disappointment than some fiery tempered Wretch who might have nothing to recommend him but those Passions which would serve only to make a Woman miserable all her Days  BESIDES tho' I had jested with him as he suppos'd it so often about my Poverty yet when he found it to be true he had foreclosed all manner of objection seeing whether he was in jest or in earnest he had declar'd he took me without any regard to my Portion and whether I was in jest or in earnest I had declar'd my self to be very Poor so that  in a word  I had him fast both ways and tho' he might say afterwards he was cheated yet he could never say that I had cheated him  HE persued me close after this and as I saw there was no need to fear losing him I play'd the indifferent part with him longer than Prudence might otherwise have dictated to me But I considered how much this caution and indifference would give me the advantage over him when I should come to be under the Necessity of owning my own Circumstances to him and I manag'd it the more warily because I found he inferr'd from  thence as indeed he ought to do that I either had the more Money or the more Judgment and would not venture at all  I TOOK the freedom one Day after we had talk'd pretty close to the Subject to tell him that it was true I had receiv'd the Compliment of a Lover from him namely that he would take me without enquiring into my Fortune and I would make him a suitable return in this  viz  that I would make as little enquiry into his as consisted with Reason but I hoped he would allow me to ask a few Questions which he should answer or not as he thought fit and that I would not be offended if he did not answer me at all one of these Questions related to our manner of living and the place where because I had heard he had a great Plantation in  Virginia  and that he had talk'd of going to live there and I told him I did not care to be Transported  HE began from this Discourse to let me voluntarily into all his Affairs and to tell me in a frank open way all his Circumstances by which I found he was very well to pass in the World but that great part of his Estate consisted of three Plantations which he had in  Virginia  which brought him in a very good Income generally speaking to the tune of  l  a Year but that if he was to live upon them would bring him in four times as much very well thought I you shall carry me thither as soon as you please tho' I won't tell you so beforehand  I JESTED with him extremely about the Figure he would make in  Virginia  but I found he would do any thing I desired tho' he did not seem glad to have me undervalue his Plantations so I turn'd my Tale I told him I had good reason  not to desire to go there to live because if his Plantations were worth so much there I had not a Fortune suitable to a Gentleman of  l  Year as he said his Estate would be  HE reply'd generously he did not ask what my Fortune was he had told me from the beginning he would not and he would be as good as his word But whatever it was he assur'd me he would never desire me to go to  Virginia  with him or go thither himself without me unless I was perfectly willing and made it my Choice  ALL this you may be sure was as I wish'd and indeed nothing could have happen'd more perfectly agreeable I carried it on as far as this with a sort of indifferency that he often wondred at more than at first But which was the only support of his Courtship and I mention it the rather to intimate again to the Ladies that nothing but want of Courage for such an Indifferency makes our Sex so cheap and prepares them to be ill us'd as they are would they venture the loss of a pretending Fop now and then who carries it high upon the point of his own Merit they would certainly be slighted less and courted more had I discovered really and truly what my great Fortune was and that in all I had not full  l  when he expected  l  yet I had hook'd him so fast and play'd him so long that I was satisfied he would have had me in my worst Circumstances and indeed it was less a surprize to him when he learnt the Truth than it would have been because having not the least blame to lay on me who had carried it with an air of indifference to the last he could not say one word except that indeed he thought it had been more but that if it had been less he did not repent his bargain only  that he should not be able to maintain me so well as he intended  IN short we were married and very happily married on my side I assure you  as to the Man  for he was the best humour'd Man that ever Woman had but his Circumstances were not so good as I imagined as on the other hand he had not bettered himself by marrying so much as he expected  WHEN we were married I was shrewdly put to it to bring him that little Stock I had and to let him see it was no more but there was a necessity for it so I took my opportunity one Day when we were alone to enter into a short Dialogue with him about it MY DEAR  said I  we have been married a Fortnight is it not time to let you know whether you have got a Wife with something or with nothing your own time for that my Dear  says he  I am satisfied that I have got the Wife I love I have not troubled you much  says he  with my enquiry after it  THAT'S true  said I  but I have a great difficulty upon me about it which I scarce know how to manage  WHAT'S that my Dear  says he  WHY  says I  'tis a little hard upon me and 'tis harder upon you I am told that Captain meaning my Friend's Husband has told you I had a great deal more Money than I ever pretended to have and I am sure I never employ'd him to do so  WELL  says he  Captain may have told me so but what then if you have not so much that may lye at his Door but you never told me what you had so I have no reasons to blame you if you have nothing at all  THAT is so just  said I  and so generous that it makes my having but a little a double Affliction to me  THE less you have  my Dear says he  the worse for us both but I hope your Affliction you speak of is not caus'd for fear I should be unkind to you for want of a Portion No No if you have nothing tell me plainly and at once I may perhaps tell the Captain he has cheated me but I can never say you have cheated me for did you not give it under your Hand that you were Poor and so I ought to expect you to be  WELL said I  my Dear  I am glad I have not been concern'd in deceiving you before Marriage if I deceive you since 'tis ne'er the worse  that I am Poor  is too true but not so Poor as to have nothing neither so I pull'd out some Bank Bills and gave him about a Hundred and Sixty Pounds there's something my Dear  says I  and not quite all neither  I HAD brought him so near to expecting nothing by what I had said before that the Money tho' the Sum was small in it self was doubly welcome to him he own'd it was more than he look'd for and that he did not question by my Discourse to him but that my fine Cloths Gold Watch and a Diamond Ring or two had been all my Fortune  I LET him please himself with that  l  two or three Days and then having been abroad that Day and as if I had been to fetch it I brought him a Hundred Pounds more home in Gold and told him there was a little more Portion for him and in short in about a Week more I brought him  l  more and about  l  in Linnen which I made him believe I had been oblig'd  to take with the  l  which I gave him in Gold as a Composition for a Debt of  l  being little more than Five Shilling in the Pound and overvalued too  And now MY DEAR  says I to him  I am very sorry to tell you that there is all and that I have given you my whole Fortune I added that if the Person who had my  l  had not abus'd me I had been worth a Thousand Pound to him but that as it was I had been faithful to him and reserv'd nothing to my self but if it had been more he should have had it  HE was so oblig'd by the Manner and so pleas'd with the Sum for he had been in a terrible fright least it had been nothing at all that he accepted it very thankfully And thus I got over the Fraud of  passing for a Fortune without Money  and cheating a Man into Marrying me on pretence of a Fortune which  by the way  I take to be one of the most dangerous Steps a Woman can take and in which she runs the most hazard of being ill us'd afterwards  My Husband  to give him his due  was a Man of infinite good Nature but he was no Fool and finding his Income not suited to the manner of Living which he had intended if I had brought him what he expected and being under a Disappointment in his return of his Plantations in  Virginia  he discover'd many times his inclination of going over to  Virginia  to live upon his own and often would be magnifying the way of living there how cheap how plentiful how pleasant  and the like    I BEGAN presently to understand his meaning and I took him up very plainly one Morning and told him that I did so that I found his Estate turn'd to no account at this distance compar'd  to what it would do if he liv'd upon the spot and that I found he had a mind to go and live there and I added that I was sensible he had been disappointed in a Wife and that finding his Expectations not answer'd that way I could do no less to make him amends than tell him that I was very willing to go over to  Virginia  with him and live there  HE said a thousand kind things to me upon the subject of my making such a Proposal to him He told me that however he was disappointed in his Expectations of a Fortune he was not disappointed in a Wife and that I was all to him that a Wife could be and he was more than satisfied in the whole when the particulars were put together but that this offer was so kind that it was more than he could express  TO bring the story short we agreed to go  he told me  that he had a very good House there that it was well Furnish'd that his Mother was alive and liv'd in it and one Sister which was all the Relations he had that as soon as he came there his Mother would remove to another House which was her own for life and his after her Decease so that I should have all the House to my self and I found all this to be exactly as he had said  TO make this part of the story short we put on board the Ship  which we went in  a large quantity of good Furniture for our House with stores of Linnen and other Necessaries and a good Cargoe for Sale and away we went  TO give an account of the manner of our Voyage which was long and full of Dangers is out of my way I kept no Journal neither did my Husband all that I can say is that after a terrible passage frighted twice with dreadful Storms and  once with what was still more terrible I mean a Pyrate who came on board and took away almost all our Provisions and which would have been beyond all to me they had once taken my Husband to go along with them but by entreaties were prevail'd with to leave him I say after all these terrible things we arriv'd in  York River  in  Virginia  and coming to our Plantation we were receiv'd with all the Demonstrations of Tenderness and Affection by my Husband's Mother that were possible to be express'd  WE liv'd here all together my Motherinlaw  at my entreaty  continuing in the House for she was too kind a Mother to be parted with my Husband likewise continued the same as at first and I thought my self the happiest Creature alive when an odd and surprizing Event put an end to all that Felicity in a moment and rendred my Condition the most uncomfortable if not the most miserable in the World  MY Mother was a mighty chearful good humour'd old Woman I may call her old Woman for her Son was above Thirty I say she was very pleasant good Company and us'd to entertain  me in particular  with abundance of Stories to divert me as well of the Country we were in as of the People  AMONG the rest she often told me how the greatest part of the Inhabitants of the Colony came thither in very indifferent Circumstances from  England  that generally speaking they were of two sorts either such as were brought over by Masters of Ships to be sold as Servants  such we call them  my Dear  says she  but they are more properly call'd  Slaves  Or Such as are Transported from  Newgate  and other Prisons after  having been found guilty of Felony and other Crimes punishable with Death  WHEN they come here  says she  we make no difference the Planters buy them and they work together in the Field till their time is out when 'tis expir'd  said she  they have Encouragement given them to Plant for themselves for they have a certain number of Acres of Land allotted them by the Country and they go to work to Clear and Cure the Land and then to Plant it with Tobacco and Corn for their own use and as the Tradesmen and Merchants will trust them with Tools and Cloaths and other Necessaries upon the Credit of their Crop before it is grown so they again Plant every Year a little more than the Year before and so buy whatever they want with the Crop that is before them  HENCE Child  says she  many a  Newgate  Bird becomes a great Man and we have  continued she  several Justices of the Peace Officers of the Train Bands and Magistrates of the Towns they live in that have been burnt in the Hand  SHE was going on with that part of the Story when her own part in it interrupted her and with a great deal of goodhumour'd Confidence she told me she was one of the second sort of Inhabitants herself that she came away openly having ventur'd too far in a particular Case so that she was become a Criminal and here's the Mark of it CHILD  says she  and pulling of her Glove look ye here  says she  turning up the Palm of her Hand and shewed me a very fine white Arm and Hand but branded in the inside of the Hand as in such cases it must be  THIS Story was very moving to me but my Mother smiling said you need not think such a  thing strange  Daughter  for as I told you some of the best Men in this Country are burnt in the Hand and they are not asham'd to own it there's Major  says she  he was an Eminent Pickpocket there's Justice  Ba r  was a Shoplifter and both of them were burnt in the Hand and I could name you several such as they are  WE had frequent Discourses of this kind and abundance of instances she gave me of the like after some time as she was telling some Stories of one that was Transported but a few Weeks ago I began in an intimate kind of way to ask her to tell me something of her own Story which she did with the utmost plainness and Sincerity how she had fallen into very ill Company in  London  in her young Days occasion'd by her Mother sending her frequently to carry Victuals and other Relief to a Kinswoman of hers who was a Prisoner in  Newgate  and who lay in a miserable starving Condition was afterwards Condemned to be Hang'd but having got Respite by pleading her Belly dyed afterwards in the Prison  HERE my MotherinLaw ran out in a long account of the wicked practices in that dreadful Place and how it ruin'd more young People than all the Town besides and Child  says my Mother  perhaps you may know little of it or it may be have heard nothing about it but depend upon it  says she  we all know here that there are more Thieves and Rogues made by that one Prison of  Newgate  than by all the Clubs and Societies of Villains in the Nation 'tis that cursed Place  says my Mother  that half Peoples this Colony  HERE she went on with her own Story so long and in so particular a manner that I began to be very uneasy but coming to one Particular  that requir'd telling her Name I thought I should have sunk down in the place she perceived I was out of order and asked me if I was not well and what ail'd me I told her I was so affected with the melancholy Story she had told and the terrible things she had gone thro' that it had overcome me and I beg'd of her to talk no more of it  Why  my Dear  says she very kindly  what need these things trouble you These Passages were long before your time and they give me no trouble at all now nay I look back on them with a particular Satisfaction as they have been a means to bring me to this place Then she went on to tell me how she very luckily fell into a good Family where behaving herself well and her Mistress dying her Master married her by whom she had my Husband and his Sister and that by her Diligence and good Management after her Husband's Death she had improv'd the Plantations to such a degree as they then were so that most of the Estate was of her getting not her Husband's for she had been a Widow upwards of sixteen Year  I HEARD this part of the Story with very little attention because I wanted much to retire and give vent to my Passions which I did soon after and let any one judge what must be the Anguish of my Mind when I came to reflect that this was certainly no more or less  than my own Mother  and I had now had two Children and was big with another by my own Brother and lay with him still every Night  I WAS now the most unhappy of all Women in the World O had the Story never been told me all had been well it had been no Crime to  have lain with my Husband since as to his being my Relation I had known nothing of it  I HAD now such a load on my Mind that it kept me perpetually waking to reveal it  which would have been some ease to me  I cou'd not find wou'd be to any purpose and yet to conceal it wou'd be next to impossible nay I did not doubt but I should talk of it in my sleep and tell my Husband of it whether I would or no If I discover'd it the least thing I could expect was to lose my Husband for he was too nice and too honest a Man to have continued my Husband after he had known I had been his Sister so that I was perplex'd to the last degree  I LEAVE it to any Man to judge what Difficulties presented to my view I was away from my native Country at a distance prodigious and the return to me unpassable I liv'd very well but in a Circumstance unsufferable in it self if I had discover'd my self to my Mother it might be difficult to convince her of the Particulars and I had no way to prove them  On the other hand  if she had question'd or doubted me I had been undone for the bare Suggestion would have immediately separated me from my Husband without gaining my Mother or him who would have been neither a Husband or a Brother so that between the surprise on one hand and the uncertainty on the other I had been sure to be undone  IN the mean time as I was but too sure of the Fact I liv'd therefore in open avowed Incest and Whoredom and all under the appearance of an honest Wife and tho' I was not much touched with the Crime of it yet the Action had something in it shocking to Nature and made  my Husband  as he thought himself  even nauseous to me  HOWEVER upon the most sedate Consideration I resolv'd that it was absolutely necessary to conceal it all and not make the least Discovery of it either to Mother or Husband and thus I liv'd with the greatest Pressure imaginable for three Year more but had no more Children  DURING this time my Mother used to be frequently telling me old Stories of her former Adventures which however were no ways pleasant to me for by it tho' she did not tell it me in plain terms yet I could easily understand joyn'd with what I had heard my self of my first Tutors that in her younger Days she had been both WHORE and THIEF but I verily believe she had lived to repent sincerely of both and that she was then a very Pious sober and religious Woman  WELL let her Life have been what it would then it was certain that my Life was very uneasie to me for I liv'd as I have said but in the worst sort of Whoredom and as I cou'd expect no Good of it so really no good Issue came of it and all my seeming Prosperity wore off and ended in Misery and Destruction it was some time indeed before it came to this for but I know not by what ill Fate guided every thing went wrong with us afterwards and that which was worse my Husband grew strangely alter'd froward jealous and unkind and I was as impatient of bearing his Carriage as the Carriage was unreasonable and unjust These things proceeded so far that we came at last to be in such ill Terms with one another that I claim'd a promise of him which he entered willingly into with me when I  consented to come from  England  with him  viz  that if I found the Country not to agree with me or that I did not like to live there I should come away to  England  again when I pleas'd giving him a Year's warning to settle his Affairs  I SAY  I now claim'd this promise of him  and I must confess I did it not in the most obliging Terms that could be in the World neither but I insisted that he treated me ill that I was remote from my Friends and could do my self no Justice and that he was Jealous without cause my Conversation having been unblameable and he having no pretence for it and that to remove to  England  would take away all Occasion from him  I INSISTED so peremptorily upon it that he could not avoid coming to a point either to keep his word with me or to break it and this notwithstanding he used all the skill he was master of and employ'd his Mother and other Agents to prevail with me to alter my Resolutions indeed the bottom of the thing lay at my Heart and that made all his Endeavours fruitless for my Heart was alienated from him  as a Husband  I loathed the Thoughts of Bedding with him and used a thousand Pretences of Illness and Humour to prevent his touching me fearing nothing more than to be with Child again by him which to be sure would have prevented or at least delay'd my going over to  England    HOWEVER at last I put him so out of Humour that he took up a rash and fatal Resolution In short I should not go to  England  and tho' he had promis'd me yet it was an unreasonable thing for me to desire it that it would be ruinous to his Affairs would Unhinge his whole Family and  be next to an Undoing him in the World That therefore I ought not to desire it of him and that no Wise in the World that valu'd her Family and her Husbands prosperity would insist upon such a thing  THIS plung'd me again for when I considered the thing calmly and took my Husband as he really was a diligent careful Man in the main Work of laying up an Estate for his Children and that he knew nothing of the dreadful Circumstances that he was in I could not but confess to myself that my Proposal was very unreasonable and what no Wise that had the good of her Family at Heart wou'd have desir'd  BUT my Discontents were of an another Nature I look'd upon him no longer as a Husband but as a near Relation the Son of my own Mother and I resolv'd some how or other to be clear of him but which way I did not know nor did it seem possible  IT is said  by the illnatured World  of our Sex that if we are set on a thing it is impossible to turn us from our Resolutions  In short  I never ceas'd poreing upon the Means to bring to pass my Voyage and came that length with my Husband at last as to propose going without him This provok'd him to the last degree and he call'd me not only an unkind Wife but an unnatural Mother and ask'd me how I could entertain such a Thought without horror as that of leaving my two Children for one was dead without a Mother and to be brought up by Strangers and never to see them more  It was true  had things been right I should not have done it but now  it was  my real desire never to see them or him either any more and as to the  Charge of unnatural I could easily answer it to myself while I knew that the whole Relation was Unnatural in the highest degree in the World  HOWEVER it was plain there was no bringing my Husband to any thing he would neither go with me or let me go without him and it was quite out of my Power to stir without his Consent as any one that knows the Constitution of the Country I was in knows very well  WE had many Family quarrels about it and they began in time to grow up to a dangerous Height for as I was quite Estrang'd from my Husband  as he was call'd  in Affection so I took no heed to my Words but sometimes gave him Language that was provoking And  in short  strove all I could to bring him to a parting with me which was what above all things in the World I desir'd most  HE took my Carriage very ill and indeed he might well do so for at last I refus'd to Bed with him and carrying on the Breach upon all occasions to extremity he told me once he thought I was Mad and if I did not alter my Conduct he would put me under Cure  that is to say into a MadHouse  I told him he should find I was far enough from Mad and that it was not in his power or any other Villians to Murther me I Confess at the same time I was heartily frighted at his Thoughts of putting me into a  MadHouse  which would at once have destroy'd all the possibility of breaking the Truth out whatever the occasion might be for that then no one would have given Credit to a word of it  THIS therefore brought me to a Resolution  whatever came of it  to lay open my whole Case but which way to do it or to whom was an inextricable Difficulty and took me up many Months to Resolve  in the mean time  another Quarrel with my Husband happen'd which came up to such a mad Extream as almost push'd me on to tell it him all to his Face but tho' I kept it in so as not to come to the particulars I spoke so much as put him into the utmost Confusion and in the End brought out the whole Story  HE began with a calm Expostulation upon my being so resolute to go to  England  I defended it and one hard Word bringing on another as is usual in all Family strife  he told me  I did not Treat him as if he was my Husband or talk of my Children as if I was a Mother and  in short  that I did not deserve to be us'd as a Wife That he had us'd all the fair Means possible with me that he had Argu'd with all the kindness and calmness that a Husband or a Christian ought to do and that I made him such a vile return that I Treated him rather like a Dog than a Man and rather like the most contemptible Stranger than a Husband That he was very loth to use Violence with me but that  in short  he saw a Necessity of it now and that for the future he should be oblig'd to take such Measures as should reduce me to my Duty  MY blood was now fir'd to the utmost  tho' I knew what he had said was very true  and nothing could appear more provok'd I told him for his fair means and his foul they were equally contemn'd by me that for my going to  England  I was resolv'd on it come what would and that as to treating him not like a Husband and not  showing my self a Mother to my Children there might be something more in it than he understood at present but for his farther consideration I thought fit to tell him thus much that he neither was my lawful Husband nor they lawful Children and that I had reason to regard neither of them more than I did  I CONFESS I was mov'd to pity him when I spoke it for he turn'd pale as Death and stood mute as one Thunder struck and once or twice I thought he would have fainted  in short  it put him in a Fit something like an Apoplex he trembl'd a Sweat or Dew ran off his Face and yet he was cold as a Clod so that I was forced to run and fetch something for him to keep Life in him when he recover'd of that he grew sick and vomited and in a little after was put to Bed and in the next Morning was as he had been indeed all Night in a violent Fever  HOWEVER it went off again and he recovered tho' but slowly and when he came to be a little better he told me I had given him a mortal Wound with my Tongue and he had only one thing to ask before he desir'd an Explanation I interrupted him and told him I was sorry I had gone so far since I saw what disorder it put him into but I desir'd him not to talk to me of Explanations for that would but make things worse  THIS heighten'd his impatience and indeed perplex'd him beyond all bearing for now he began to suspect that there was some Mystery yet unfolded but could not make the least guess at the real Particulars of it all that run in his Brain was that I had another Husband alive which I could not say in fact might not be true but I  assur'd him however there was not the least of that in it and indeed as to my other Husband he was effectually dead in Law to me and had told me I should look on him as such so I had not the least uneasiness on that score  BUT now I found the thing too far gone to conceal it much longer and my Husband himself gave me an opportunity to ease my self of the Secret much to my Satisfaction he had laboured with me three or four Weeks  but to no purpose  only to tell him whether I had spoken those words only as the effect of my Passion to put him in a Passion Or whether there was any thing of Truth in the bottom of them But I continued inflexible and would explain nothing unless he would first consent to my going to  England  which he would never do  he said  while he liv'd on the other hand I said it was in my power to make him willing when I pleas'd NAY to make him entreat me to go and this increased his Curiosity and made him importunate to the highest degree  but it was all to no purpose    AT length he tells all this Story to his Mother and sets her upon me to get the main Secret out of me and she us'd her utmost Skill with me indeed but I put her to a full stop at once  by telling her  that the Reason and Mystery of the whole matter lay in herself and that it was my Respect to her that had made me conceal it and that in short I could go no farther and therefore conjur'd her not to insist upon it  SHE was struck dumb at this Suggestion and could not tell what to say or to think but laying aside the supposition as a Policy of mine continued her importunity on account of her Son and if possible to make up the breach between us  two as to that  I told her  that it was indeed a good design in her but that it was impossible to be done and that if I should reveal to her the Truth of what she desir'd she would grant it to be impossible and cease to desire it At last I seem'd to be prevail'd on by her importunity and told her I dar'd trust her with a Secret of the greatest Importance and she would soon see that this was so and that I would consent to lodge it in her Breast if she would engage solemnly not to acquaint her Son with it without my consent  SHE was long in promising this part but rather than not come at the main Secret she agreed to that too and after a great many other Preliminaries I began and told her the whole Story First I told her how much she was concern'd in all the unhappy breach which had happen'd between her Son and me by telling me her own Story and her  London  Name and that the surprize she see I was in was upon that Occasion Then I told her my own Story and my Name and assur'd her by such other Tokens as she could not deny that I was no other nor more or less than her own Child  her Daughter  born of her Body in  Newgate  the same that had sav'd her from the Gallows by being in her Belly and the same that she left in such and such Hands when she was Transported  IT is impossible to express the Astonishment she was in she was not inclin'd to believe the Story or to remember the Particulars for she immediately foresaw the Confusions that must follow in the Family upon it but every thing concurr'd so exactly with the Stories she had told me of her self and which if she had not told me  she would perhaps have been content to have denied that she had stop'd her own Mouth and she had nothing to do but to take me about the Neck and kiss me and cry most vehemently over me without speaking one word for a long time together at last she broke out  Unhappy Child says she  what miserable chance could bring thee hither And in the Arms of my own Son too  Dreadful Girl  says she  why we are all undone  Married to thy own Brother Three Children and two alive all of the same Flesh and Blood My Son and my Daughter lying together as Husband and Wife All Confusion and Destraction for ever  miserable Family  what will become of us what is to be said what is to be done and thus she run on for a great while nor had I any power to speak or if I had did I know what to say for every word wounded me to the Soul With this kind of Amasement on our Thoughts we parted for the first time tho' my Mother was more surpriz'd than I was because it was more News to her than to me However she promis'd again to me at parting that she would say nothing of it to her Son till we had talk'd of it again  IT was not long you may be sure before we had a second Conference upon the same Subject when as if she had been willing to forget the Story she had told me of herself or to suppose that I had forgot some of the Particulars she began to tell them with Alterations and Omissions but I refresh'd her Memory and set her to rights in many things which I supposed she had forgot and then came in so opportunely with the whole History that it was impossible for her to go from it and then she fell into her Rhapsodies again and Exclamations at the Severity of her Misfortunes  When these things were a little over with her we fell into a close Debate about what should be first done before we gave an account of the matter to my Husband but to what purpose could be all our Consultations we could neither of us see our way thro' it nor see how it could be safe to open such a Scene to him it was impossible to make any judgment or give any guess at what Temper he would receive it in or what Measures he would take upon it and if he should have so little Government of himself as to make it publick we easily foresaw that it would be the ruin of the whole Family and expose my Mother and me to the last degree and if at last he should take the Advantage the Law would give him he might put me away with disdain and leave me to Sue for the little Portion that I had and perhaps wast it all in the Suit and then be a Beggar the Children would be ruin'd too having no legal Claim to any of his Effects and thus I should see him perhaps in the Arms of another Wife in a few Months and be my self the most miserable Creature alive  MY Mother was as sensible of this as I and upon the whole we knew not what to do after some time we came to more sober Resolutions but then it was with this Misfortune too that my Mother's Opinion and mine were quite different from one another and indeed inconsistent with one another for my Mother's Opinion was that I should bury the whole thing entirely and continue to live with him as my Husband till some other Event should make the discovery of it more convenient and that in the mean time she would endeavour to reconcile us together again and restore our mutual Comfort and Family Peace that  we might lie as we us'd to do together and so let the whole matter remain a secret as close as Death for Child  says she  we are both undone if it comes out  TO encourage me to this she promis'd to make me easy in my Circumstances as far as she was able and to leave me what she could at her Death secur'd for me separately from my Husband so that if it should come out afterwards I should not be left destitute but be able to stand on my own Feet and procure Justice from him  THIS Proposal did not agree at all with my Judgment of the thing tho' it was very fair and kind in my Mother but my Thoughts run quite another way  AS to keeping the thing in our own Breasts and letting it all remain as it was I told her it was impossible and I ask'd her how she cou'd think I cou'd bear the thoughts of lying with my own Brother In the next place I told her that her being alive was the only support of the Discovery and that while she own'd me for her Child and saw reason to be satisfyed that I was so no body else would doubt it but that if she should die before the Discovery I should be taken for an impudent Creature that had forg'd such a thing to go away from my Husband or should be counted Craz'd and Distracted Then I told her how he had threaten'd already to put me into a Madhouse and what concern I had been in about it and how that was the thing that drove me to the necessity of discovering it to her as I had done  FROM all which I told her that I had on the most serious Reflections I was able to make in the Case come to this Resolution which I hop'd she  would like as a medium between both  viz  that she should use her endeavours with her Son to give me leave to go for  England  as I had desired and to furnish me with a sufficient Sum of Money either in Goods along with me or in Bills for my Support there all along suggesting that he might one time or other think it proper to come over to me  THAT when I was gone she should then in cold Blood and after first obliging him in the solemnest manner possible to Secresie discover the Case to him doing it gradually and as her own Discretion should guide her so that he might not be surpriz'd with it and fly out into any Passions and Excesses on my account or on hers and that she should concern herself to prevent his slighting the Children or Marrying again unless he had a certain account of my being Dead  THIS was my Scheme and my Reasons were good I was really alienated from him in the Consequence of these things indeed I mortally hated him as a Husband and it was impossible to remove that riveted Aversion I had to him  at the same time  it being an unlawful incestuous living added to that Aversion and tho' I had no great concern about it in point of Conscience yet every thing added to make Cohabiting with him the most nauseous thing to me in the World and I think verily it was come to such a height that I could almost as willingly have embrac'd a Dog as have let him offer any thing of that kind to me for which Reason I could not bear the thoughts of coming between the Sheets with him I cannot say that I was right in point of Policy in carrying it such a length while at the same time I did not resolve to discover the thing to him but I  am giving an account of what was not of what ought or ought not to be  IN this directly opposite Opinion to one another my Mother and I continued a long time and it was impossible to reconcile our Judgments many Disputes we had about it but we could never either of us yield our own or bring over the other  I INSISTED on my Aversion to lying with my own Brother and she insisted upon its being impossible to bring him to consent to my going from him to  England  and in this uncertainty we continued not differing so as to quarrel or any thing like it but so as not to be able to resolve what we should do to make up that terrible breach that was before us  AT last I resolv'd on a desperate course and  told my Mother  my Resolution  viz  that in short I would tell him of it my self my Mother was frighted to the last degree at the very thoughts of it but  I bid her be easie  told her I would do it gradually and softly and with all the Art and good Humour I was Mistress off and time it also as well as I could taking him in good Humour too  I told her  I did not question but if I cou'd be Hypocrite enough to feign more Affection to him than I really had I should succeed in all my Design and we might part by Consent and with a good Agreement for I might love him well enough for a Brother tho' I could not for a Husband  ALL this while he lay at my Mother to find out if possible what was the meaning of that dreadful Expression of mine as he call'd it which I mention'd before namely  That I was not his lawful Wife nor my Children his legal Children  My Mother put him off told him she could bring me to no Explanations but found there was something that disturb'd me very much and she hop'd she should get it out of me in time and in the mean time recommended to him earnestly to use me more tenderly and win me with his usual good Carriage  told him  of his terrifying and affrighting me with his Threats of sending me to a Madhouse and the like and advis'd him not to make a Woman Desperate on any account whatever  HE promis'd her to soften his Behaviour and bid her assure me that he lov'd me as well as ever and that he had no such design as that of sending me to a Madhouse whatever he might say in his Passion also he desir'd my Mother to use the same Perswasions to me too that our Affections might be renew'd and we might live together in a good understanding as we us'd to do  I FOUND the Effects of this Treaty presently my Husband's Conduct was immediately alter'd and he was quite another Man to me nothing could be kinder and more obliging than he was to me upon all Occasions and I could do no less than make some return to it  which I did as well as I cou'd  but it was but in an awkward manner at best for nothing was more frightful to me than his Caresses and the Apprehensions of being with Child again by him was ready to throw me into Fits and this made me see that there was an absolute necessity of breaking the Case to him without any more delay which however I did with all the caution and reserve imaginable  HE had continued his alter'd Carriage to me near a Month and we began to live a new kind  of Life with one another and could I have satisfied my self to have gone on with it I believe it might have continued as long as we had continued alive together One Evening as we were sitting and talking very friendly together under a little Auning which serv'd as an Arbour at the entrance from our House into the Garden he was in a very pleasant agreeable Humour and said abundance of kind things to me relating to the Pleasure of our present good Agreement and the Disorders of our past breach and what a Satisfaction it was to him that we had room to hope we should never have any more of it  I FETCH'D a deep Sigh and told him there was no Body in the World could be more delighted than I was in the good Agreement we had always kept up or more afflicted with the Breach of it and should be so still but I was sorry to tell him that there was an unhappy Circumstance in our Case which lay too close to my Heart and which I knew not how to break to him that rendred my part of it very miserable and took from me all the Comfort of the rest  HE importun'd me to tell him what it was I told him I could not tell how to do it that while it was conceal'd from him I alone was unhappy but if he knew it also we should be both so and that therefore to keep him in the dark about it was the kindest thing that I could do and it was on that account alone that I kept a secret from him the very keeping of which I thought would first or last be my Destruction  IT is impossible to express his Surprize at this Relation and the double importunity which he used with me to discover it to him He told me I could not be call'd kind to him nay I could not  be faithful to him if I conceal'd it from him I told him I thought so too and yet I could not do it He went back to what I had said before to him and told me he hoped it did not relate to what I had said in my Passion and that he had resolv'd to forget all that as the Effect of a rash provok'd Spirit I told him I wish'd I could forget it all too but that it was not to be done the Impression was too deep and I cou'd not do it it was impossible  HE then told me he was resolved not to differ with me in anything and that therefore he would importune me no more about it resolving to acquiesce in whatever I did or said only begg'd I would then agree that whatever it was it should no more interrupt our quiet and our mutual kindness  THIS was the most provoking thing he could have said to me for I really wanted his farther importunities that I might be prevail'd with to bring out that which indeed it was like Death to me to conceal so I answer'd him plainly that I could not say I was glad not to be importuned tho' I could not tell how to comply but come  my Dear said I  what Conditions will you make with me upon the opening this Affair to you  ANY Conditions in the World  said he  that you can in reason desire of me well  said I  come give it me under your Hand that if you do not find I am in any fault or that I am willingly concern'd in the Causes of the Misfortune that is to follow you will not blame me use me the worse do me any Injury or make me be the Sufferer for that which is not my fault  THAT  says he  is the most reasonable demand in the World not to blame you for that which is  not your fault give me a Pen and Ink  says he  so I ran in and fetch'd a Pen Ink and Paper and he wrote the Condition down in the very words I had proposed it and sign'd it with his Name well says he  what is next  my Dear  WHY  says I  the next is that you will not blame me for not discovering the Secret of it to you before I knew it  VERY just again  says he  with all my Heart so he wrote down that also and sign'd it  WELL  my Dear  says I then I have but one Condition more to make with you and that is that as there is no body concern'd in it but you and I you shall not discover it to any Person in the World except your own Mother and that in all the Measures you shall take upon the discovery as I am equally concern'd in it with you  tho' as innocent as your self  you shall do nothing in a Passion nothing to my Prejudice or to your Mother's Prejudice without my knowledge and consent  THIS a little amaz'd him and he wrote down the words distinctly but read them over and over before he Sign'd them hesitating at them several times and repeating them  my Mother  's Prejudice  and your Prejudice  what mysterious thing can this be however at last he Sign'd it  WELL  says I  my Dear I'll ask you no more under your Hand but as you are to bear the most unexpected and surprizing thing that perhaps ever befel any Family in the World I beg you to promise me you will receive it with Composure and a Presence of Mind suitable to a Man of Sense  I'LL do my utmost  says he  upon Condition you will keep me no longer in suspence for you Terrify me with all these Preliminaries  WELL then  says I  it is this as I told you before in a Heat that I was not your lawful Wife and that our Children were not legal Children so I must let you know now in calmness and in kindness but with Affliction enough that  I am  your own Sister  and you  my own Brother and that we are both the Children of our Mother now alive and in the House who is convinc'd of the Truth of it in a manner not to be denied or contradicted  I SAW him turn pale and look wild and I said now remember your Promise and receive it with Presence of mind for who cou'd have said more to prepare you for it than I have done However I call'd a Servant and got him a little Glass of Rum which is the usual Dram of the Country for he was just fainting away  WHEN he was a little recover'd  I said to him  this Story you may be sure requires a long Explanation and therefore have patience and compose your Mind to hear it out and I'll make it as short as I can and with this I told him what I thought was needful of the Fact and particularly how my Mother came to discover it to me as above and now my Dear  says I  you will see Reason for my Capitulations and that I neither have been the Cause of this Matter nor could be so and that I could know nothing of it before now  I AM fully satisfy'd of that  says he  but 'tis a dreadful Surprize to me however I know a Remedy for it all and a Remedy that shall put an End to all your Difficulties without your going to  England  That would be strange  said I  as all the rest No No  says he  I'll make it easie there's no Body in the way of it all but myself  He look'd a little disorder'd when he said this but I did not apprehend any thing from it at that time believing as it us'd to be said that they who do those things never talk of them or that they who talk of such things never do them  BUT things were not come their height with him and I observ'd he became Pensive and Melancholly and in a Word as I thought a little Distemper'd in his Head I endeavour'd to talk him into Temper and to Reason him into a kind of Scheme for our Government in the Affair and sometimes he would be well and talk with some Courage about it but the Weight of it lay too heavy upon his Thoughts and in short it went so far that he made two attempts upon himself and in one of them had actually strangled himself and had not his Mother come into the Room in the very Moment he had died but with the help of a  Negro  Servant she cut him down and recover'd him  THINGS were now come to a lamentable height in the Family My pity for him now began to revive that Affection which at first I really had for him and I endeavour'd sincerely by all the kind Carriage I could to make up the Breach but in short it had gotten too great a Head it prey'd upon his Spirits and it threw him into a long ling'ring Consumption tho' it happen'd not to be Mortal In this Distress I did not know what to do as his Life was apparently declining and I might perhaps have Marry'd again there very much to my Advantage it had been certainly my Business to have staid in the Country but my Mind was restless too and uneasie I hanker'd  after coming to  England  and nothing would satisfie me without it  IN short by an unwearied importunity my Husband who was apparently decaying as I observ'd was at last prevail'd with and so  my own Fate pushing me on  the way was made clear for me and  my Mother concurring  I obtain'd a very good Cargo for my coming to  England    WHEN I parted with my Brother for such I am now to call him we agreed that after I arriv'd he should pretend to have an Account that I was Dead in  England  and so might Marry again when he would he promis'd and engag'd to me to Correspond with me as a Sister and to Assist and Support me as long as I liv'd and that if he dy'd before me he would leave sufficient to his Mother to take Care of me still in the Name of a Sister and he was in some respect Careful of me when he heard of me but it was so oddly mannag'd that I felt the Disappointments very sensibly afterwards as you shall hear in its time  I CAME away for  England  in the Month of  August  after I had been Eight Years in that Country and now a new Scene of Misfortunes attended me which perhaps few Women have gone thro' the like of  WE had an indifferent good Voyage till we came just upon the Coast of  England  and where we arriv'd in two and thirty Days but were then Ruffled with two or three Storms one of which drove us away to the Coast of  Ireland  and we put in at  Kinsale  We remain'd there about thirteen Days got some Refreshment on Shore and put to Sea again tho' we met with very bad Weather again in which the Ship sprung her Mainmast  as they call'd it for I knew not what they meant  But we got at last into  Milford Haven  in  Wales  where tho' it was remote from our Port yet having my Foot safe upon the firm Ground of my Native Country the Isle of  Britain  I resolv'd to venture it no more upon the Waters which had been so terrible to me so getting my Cloths and Money on Shore with my Bills of Loading and other Papers I resolv'd to come for  London  and leave the Ship to get to her Port as she could the Port whether she was bound was to  Bristol  where my Brothers chief Correspondent liv'd  I GOT to  London  in about three Weeks where I heard a little while after that the Ship was arriv'd in  Bristol  but at the same time had the Misfortune to know that by the violent Weather she had been in and the breaking of her Mainmast she had great damage on board and that a great part of her Cargo was spoil'd  I HAD now a new Scene of Life upon my Hands and a dreadful Appearance it had I was come away with a kind of final Farewel what I brought with me was indeed considerable had it come safe and by the help of it I might have married again tollerably well but as it was I was reduc'd to between two or three Hundred Pounds in the whole and this without any hope of Recruit I was entirely without Friends nay even so much as without Acquaintance for I found it was absolutely necessary not to revive former Acquaintances and as for my subtle Friend that set me up formerly for a Fortune she was Dead and her Husband also as I was inform'd upon sending a Person unknown to enquire  THE looking after my Cargo of Goods soon after oblig'd me to take a Journey to  Bristol    and during my attendance upon that Affair I took the Diversion of going to the  Bath  for as as I was still far from being old so my Humour which was always Gay continu'd so to an Extream and being now  as it were  a Woman of Fortune tho' I was a Woman without a Fortune I expected something or other might happen in my way that might mend my Circumstances as had been my Case before  THE  Bath  is a Place of Gallantry enough Expensive and full of Snares I went thither indeed in the view of taking any thing that might offer but I must do myself that Justice as to protest I knew nothing amiss I meant nothing but in an honest way nor had I any Thoughts about me at first that look'd the way which afterwards I suffered them to be guided  HERE I stay'd the whole latter Season  as it is call'd there  and Contracted some unhappy Acquaintance which rather prompted the Follies I fell afterwards into than fortify'd me against them I liv'd pleasantly enough kept good Company  that is to say  gay fine Company but had the Discouragement to find this way of Living sunk me exceedingly and that as I had no settl'd Income so spending upon the main Stock was but a certain kind of  bleeding to Death  and this gave me many sad Reflections in the Intervals of my other Thoughts However I shook them off and still flatter'd myself that something or other might offer for my Advantage  BUT I was in the wrong Place for it I was not none at  Redriff  where If I had set myself tollerably up some honest Sea Captain or other might have talk'd with me upon the honourable terms of Matrimony but I was at the  Bath  where Men find a Mistress sometimes but very rarely look for a Wife and Consequently all the particular Acquaintances a Woman can Expect to make there must have some Tendency that way  I HAD spent the first Season well enough for tho' I had Contracted some Acquaintance with a Gentleman who came to the  Bath  for his Diversion yet I had enter'd into no  felonious Treaty  as it might be call'd I had resisted some Casual offers of Gallantry and had manag'd that way well enough I was not wicked enough to come into the Crime for the meer Vice of it and I had no extraordinary Offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which I wanted  HOWEVER I went this length the first Season  viz  I contracted an Acquaintance with a Woman in whose House I Lodg'd who tho' she did not keep an ill House  as we call it  yet had none of the best Principles in herself I had on all Occasions behav'd myself so well as not to get the least Slur upon my Reputation on any Account whatever and all the Men that I had Convers'd with were of so good Reputation that I had not given the least Reflection by Conversing with them nor did any of them seem to think there was room for a wicked Correspondence if they had any of them offered it yet there was one Gentleman  as above  who always singl'd me out for the Diversion of my Company as he call'd it which  as he was pleas'd to say  was very agreeable to him but at time there was no more in it  I HAD many melancholly Hours at the  Bath  after all the Company was gone for tho' I went to  Bristol  sometimes for the disposing my Effects and for Recruits of Money yet I chose to come  back to  Bath  for my Residence because being on good Terms with the Woman in whose House I lodg'd in the Summer I found that during the Winter I liv'd rather cheaper there than I could do any where else here  I say  I pass'd the Winter as heavily as I had pass'd the Autumn chearfully But having contracted a nearer intimacy with the said Woman in whose House I Lodg'd I could not avoid communicating to her something of what lay hardest upon my Mind and particularly the narrowness of my Circumstances and the loss of my Fortune by the Damage of my Goods by Sea I told her also that I had a Mother and a Brother in  Virginia  in good Circumstances and as I had really written back to my Mother in particular to represent my Condition and the great Loss I had receiv'd which indeed came to almost  l  so I did not fail to let my new Friend know that I expected a Supply from thence and so indeed I did and as the Ships went from  Bristol  to  York  River in  Virginia  and back again generally in less time than from  London  and that my Brother Corresponded chiefly at  Bristol  I thought it was much better for me to wait here for my Returns than to go to  London  where also I had not the least Acquaintance  MY new Friend appear'd sensibly affected with my Condition and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the Rate of my living with her to so low a Price during the Winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me and as for Lodging during the Winter I paid nothing at all  WHEN the Spring Season came on she continu'd to be as kind to me as she could and I lodg'd  with her for a time till it was found necessary to do otherwise she had some Persons of Character that frequently lodg'd in her House and in particular the Gentleman who as I said singl'd me out for his Companion the Winter before and he came down again with another Gentleman in his Company and two Servants and lodg'd in the same House I suspected that my Landlady had invited him thither letting him know that I was still with her but she deny'd it and protested to me that she did not and he said the same  IN a Word this Gentleman came down and continu'd to single me out for his peculiar Confidence as well as Conversation he was a compleat Gentleman  that must be confess'd  and his Company was very agreeable to me as mine  if I might believe him  was to him he made no Professions to me but of an extraordinary Respect and he had such an Opinion of my Virtue that  as he often profess'd  he believ'd if he should offer any thing else I should reject him with Contempt he soon understood from me that I was a Widow that I had arriv'd at  Bristol  from  Virginia  by the last Ships and that I waited at  Bath  till the next  Virginia Fleet  should arrive by which I expected considerable Effects I understood by him and by others of him that he had a Wife but that the Lady was distemper'd in her Head and was under the Conduct of her own Relations which he consented to to avoid any Reflections that might  as was not unusual in such Cases  be cast on him for mismanaging her Cure and in the mean time he came to the  Bath  to divert his Thoughts from the Disturbance of such a melancholy Circumstance as that was  MY Landlady who of her own accord encourag'd the Correspondence on all Occasions gave me an advantageous Character of him as of a Man of Honour and of Virtue as well as of a great Estate and indeed I had a great deal of Reason to say so of him too for tho' we lodg'd both on a Floor and he had frequently come into my Chamber even when I was in Bed and I also into his when he was in Bed yet he never offered any thing to me farther than a kiss or so much as solicited me to any thing till long after as you shall hear  I FREQUENTLY took notice to my Landlady of his exceeding Modesty and she again used to tell me she believ'd it was so from the beginning however she used to tell me that she thought I ought to expect some Gratification from him for my Company for indeed he did as it were engross me and I was seldom from him  I told her  I had not given him the least occasion to think I wanted it or that I would accept of it from him  she told me  she would take that part upon her and she did so and manag'd it so dextrously that the first time we were together alone after she had talk'd with him he began to enquire a little into my Circumstances as how I had subsisted my self since I came on shore and whether I did not want Money I stood off very boldly I told him that tho' my Cargo of Tobacco was damag'd yet that it was not quite lost that the Merchant I had been consign'd to had so honestly manag'd for me that I had not wanted and that I hop'd with frugal Management I should make it hold out till more would come which I expected by the next Fleet that in the mean time I had retrench'd my Expences and whereas I kept a Maid  last Season now I liv'd without and whereas I had a Chamber and a Diningroom then on the first Floor  as he knew  I now had but one Room two pair of Stairs  and the like  but I live  said I  as well satisfy'd now as I did then  adding  that his Company had been a means to make me live much more chearfully than otherwise I should have done for which I was much oblig'd to him and so I put off all room for any offer for the present However it was not long before he attack'd me again and told me he found that I was backward to trust him with the Secret of my Circumstances  which he was sorry for  assuring me that he enquir'd into it with no design to satisfie his own Curiosity but meerly to assist me if there was any occasion but since I would not own my self to stand in need of any assistance he had but one thing more to desire of me and that was that I would promise him that when I was any way streighten'd or like to be so I would frankly tell him of it and that I would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer  adding  that I should always find I had a true Friend tho' perhaps I was afraid to trust him  I OMITTED nothing  that was fit to be said by one infinitely oblig'd  to let him know that I had a due Sense of his Kindness and indeed from that time I did not appear so much reserv'd to him as I had done before tho' still within the Bounds of the strictest Virtue on both sides but how free soever our Conversation was I cou'd not arrive to that sort of Freedom which he desir'd  viz  to tell him I wanted Money tho' I was secretly very glad of his offer  SOME Weeks pass'd after this and still I never ask'd him for Money when my Landlady a  cunning Creature who had often press'd me to it but found that I cou'd not do it makes a Story of her own inventing and comes in bluntly to me when we were together O Widow  says she  I have bad News to tell you this Morning What is that said I are the  Virginia  Ships taken by the  French for that was my fear  No no  says she  but the Man you sent to  Bristol  Yesterday for Money is come back and says he has brought none  NOW I could by no means like her Project I thought it look'd too much like prompting him which indeed he did not want and I saw clearly that I should lose nothing by being backward to ask so I took her up short I can't imagine why he should say so to you  said I  for I assure you he brought me all the Money I sent him for and here it is  said I  pulling out my Purse with about Guineas in it and added I intend you shall have most of it by and by  HE seem'd distasted a little at her talking as she did at first as well as I taking it as I fancied he would as something forward of her but when he saw me give such an Answer he came immediately to himself again The next Morning we talk'd of it again when I found he was fully satisfy'd and smiling said he hop'd I would not want Money and not tell him of it and that I had promis'd him otherwise I told him I had been very much dissatisfy'd at my Landladies talking so publickly the Day before of what she had nothing to do with but I suppos'd she wanted what I ow'd her which was about Eight Guineas which I had resolv'd to give her and had accordingly given it her the same Night she talk'd so foolishly  HE was in a mighty good Humour when he heard me say  I had paid her  and it went off into some other Discourse at that time but the next Morning he having heard me up about my Room before him he call'd to me  and I answering  he ask'd me to come into his Chamber he was in bed when I came in and he made me come and sit down on his Bed side  for he said  he had something to say to me which was of some Moment After some very kind Expressions he ask'd me if I would be very honest to him and give a sincere Answer to one thing he would desire of me after some little Cavil with him at the word  Sincere  and asking him if I had ever given him any Answers which were not Sincere I promis'd him I would why then his Request was  he said  to let him see my Purse I immediately put my Hand into my Pocket  and Laughing at him  pull'd it out and there was in it three Guineas and a Half  then he ask'd me  if there was all the Money I had I told him no  Laughing again  not by a great deal  WELL then  he said  he would have me promise to go and fetch him all the Money I had every Farthing  I told him I would  and I went into my Chamber and fetch'd him a little private Drawer where I had about six Guineas more and some Silver and threw it all down upon the Bed and told him there was all my Wealth honestly to a Shilling He look'd a little at it but did not tell it and Huddled it all into the Drawer again and reaching his Pocket pull'd out a Key and bad then me open a little Walnuttree box he had upon the Table and bring him such a Drawer which I did in which Drawer there was a great deal of Money in Gold I believe near Guineas  but I knew not how much He took the Drawer and taking my Hand made me put it in and take a whole handful I was backward at that but he held my Hand hard in his Hand and put it into the Drawer and made me take out as many Guineas almost as I could well take up at once  WHEN I had done so he made me put them into my Lap and took my little Drawer and pour'd out all my own Money among his and bad me get me gone and carry it all Home into my own Chamber  I RELATE this Story the more particularly because of the good Humour there was in it and to show the temper with which we Convers'd It was was not long after this but he began every Day to find fault with my Cloths with my Laces and Headdresses and in a Word press'd me to buy better which by the way I was willing enough to do tho' I did not seem to be so for I lov'd nothing in the World better than fine Clothes I told him I must Housewife the Money he had lent me or else I should not be able to pay him again He then told me in a few Words that as he had a sincere Respect for me and knew my Circumstances he had not Lent me that Money but given it me and that he thought I had merited it from him by giving him my Company so intirely as I had done After this he made me take a Maid and keep House and his Friend that came with him to  Bath  being gone he oblig'd me to Dyet him which I did very willingly believeing  as it appear'd  that I should lose nothing by it nor did the Woman of the House fail to find her Account in it too  WE had liv'd thus near three Months when the Company beginning to wear away at the  Bath  he talk'd of going away and fain he would have me to go to  London  with him I was not very easie in that Proposal not knowing what Posture I was to live in there or how he might use me But while this was in Debate he fell very Sick he had gone out to a place in  Somersetshire  called  Shepton  where he had some Business and was there taken very ill and so ill that he could not Travel so he sent his Man back to  Bath  to beg me that I would hire a Coach and come over to him Before he went he had left all his Money and other things of Value with me and what to do with them I did not know but I secur'd them as well as I could and Lock'd up the Lodgings and went to him where I found him very ill indeed however I perswaded him to be carry'd in a Litter to the  Bath  where there was more help and better advice to be had  HE consented and I brought him to the  Bath  which was about fifteen Miles  as I remember  here he continued very ill of a Fever and kept his Bed five Weeks all which time I nurs'd him and tended him my self as much and as carefully as if I had been his Wife indeed if I had been his Wife I could not have done more I sat up with him so much and so often that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer and then I got a Pallate Bed into his Room and lay in it just at his Bed's Feet  I WAS indeed sensibly affected with his Condition and with the Apprehension of losing such a Friend as he was and was like to be to me and I us'd to sit and Cry by him many Hours together However at last he grew Better and gave  hopes that he would recover as indeed he did tho' very slowly  WERE it otherwise than what I am going to say I should not be backward to disclose it as it is apparent I have done in other Cases in this Account but I affirm that thro' all this Conversation abating the freedom of coming into the Chamber when I or he was in Bed and abating the necessary Offices of attending him Night and Day when he was Sick there had not pass'd the least immodest Word or Action between us O that it had been so to the last  AFTER some time he gathered Strength and grew well apace and I would have remov'd my Palate Bed but he would not let me till he was able to venture himself without any Body to sit up with him and then I remov'd to my own Chamber  HE took many Occasions to express his Sense of my Tenderness and Concern for him and when he grew quite well he made me a Present of Fifty Guineas for my Care and as he call'd it for hazarding my Life to save his  AND now he made deep Protestations of a sincere inviolable Affection for me but all along attested it to be with the utmost reserve for my Virtue and his own I told him I was fully satisfyed of it he carried it that length that he protested to me that if he was naked in Bed with me he would as sacredly preserve my Virtue as he would defend it if I was assaulted by a Ravisher I believ'd him and told him I did so but this did not satisfie him he would  he said  wait for some opportunity to give me an undoubted Testimony of it  IT was a great while after this that I had Occasion on my own Business to go to  Bristol  upon which he hir'd me a Coach and would go with me and did so and now indeed our intimacy increas'd From  Bristol  he carry'd me to  Gloucester  which was meerly a Journey of Pleasure to take the Air and here it was our hap to have no Lodging in the Inn but in one large Chamber with two Beds in it The Master of the House going up with us to show his Rooms and coming into that Room said very frankly to him Sir  It is none of my business to enquire whether the Lady be your Spouse or no  but if not  you may lie as honestly in these two Beds as if you were in two Chambers  and with that he pulls a great Curtain which drew quite cross the Room and effectually divided the Beds well  says my Friend  very readily these Beds will do and as for the rest we are too near a kin to lye together tho' we may Lodge near one another and this put an honest Face on the thing too When we came to go to Bed he decently went out of the Room till I was in Bed and then went to Bed in the Bed on his own side of the Room but lay there talking to me a great while  AT last repeating his usual saying that he could lye in the naked Bed with me and not offer me the least Injury he starts out of his Bed and now  my Dear says he  you shall see how just I will be to you and that I can keep my word and away he comes to my Bed  I resisted a little but I must confess I should not have resisted him much if he had not made those Promises at all so after a little struggle  as I said  I lay still and let him come to Bed when he was there he took me in his Arms and so I lay all Night with him but he had no more to  do with me or offer'd any thing to me other than embracing me as I say in his Arms no not the whole Night but rose up and dress'd him in the Morning and left me as innocent for him as I was the Day I was born  THIS was a surprizing thing to me and perhaps may be so to others who know how the Laws of Nature work for he was a strong vigorous brisk Person nor did he act thus on a principle of Religion at all  but of meer Affection  insisting on it that tho' I was to him the most agreeable Woman in the World yet because he lov'd me he cou'd not injure me  I OWN it was a noble Principle but as it was what I never understood before so it was to me perfectly amazing We Travel'd the rest of the Journey as we did before and came back to the  Bath  where as he had opportunity to come to me when he would he often repeated the Moderation and I frequently lay with him and he with me and altho' all the familiarities between Man and Wife were common to us yet he never once offered to go any farther and he valued himself much upon it I do not say that I was so wholly pleas'd with it as he thought I was For I own I was much wickeder than he  as you shall hear presently    WE liv'd thus near two Year only with this exception that he went three times to  London  in that time and once he continued there four Months but to do him Justice he always supply'd me with Money to subsist me very handsomly  HAD we continued thus I confess we had had much to boast of but as wise Men say it is ill venturing too near the brink of a Command so we found it and here again I must do him the Justice  to own that the first Breach was not on his part It was one Night that we were in Bed together warm and merry and having drank I think a little more Wine that Night both of us than usual tho' not in the least to disorder either of us when after some other follies which I cannot name and being clasp'd close in his Arms  I told him I repeat it with shame and horror of Soul  that I cou'd find in my Heart to discharge him of his Engagement for one Night and no more  HE took me at my word immediately and after that there was no resisting him neither indeed had I any mind to resist him any more let what would come of it  THUS the Government of our Virtue was broken and I exchang'd the Place of Friend for that unmusical harshsounding Title of WHORE In the Morning we were both at our Penitentials I cried very heartily he express'd himself very sorry but that was all either of us could do at that time and the way being thus clear'd and the bars of Virtue and Conscience thus removed we had the less difficulty afterwards to struggle with  IT was but a dull kind of Conversation that we had together for all the rest of that Week I look'd on him with Blushes and every now and then started that melancholy Objection  what if I should be with Child now What will become of me then  He encourag'd me by telling me that as long as I was true to him he would be so to me and since it was gone such a length which indeed he never intended yet if I was with Child he would take care of that and of me too This harden'd us both I assur'd him if I was with Child I would die for want of a Midwife rather than  Name him as the Father of it and he assur'd me I should never want if I should be with Child These mutual assurances harden'd us in the thing and after this we repeated the Crime as often as we pleas'd till at length as I had fear'd so it came to pass and I was indeed with Child  AFTER I was sure it was so and I had satisfied him of it too we began to think of taking measures for the managing it and I propos'd trusting the Secret to my Landlady and asking her Advice which he agreed to My Landlady a Woman as I found us'd to such things made light of it she said she knew it would come to that at last and made us very merry about it As I said above we found her an Experienc'd old Lady at such Work she undertook every thing engag'd to procure a Midwife and a Nurse to satisfie all Enquiries and bring us off with Reputation and she did so very dexterously indeed  WHEN I grew near my time she desir'd my Gentleman to go away to  London  or make as if he did so when he was gone she acquainted the Parish Officers that there was a Lady ready to lye in at her House but that she knew her Husband very well and gave them as she pretended an account of his Name which she called Sir  Walter Cleave  telling them he was a very worthy Gentleman and that she would answer for all Enquiries and the like This satisfied the Parish Officers presently and I lay INN with as much Credit as I could have done if I had really been my Lady  Cleave  and was assisted in my Travel by three or four of the best Citizens Wives of  Bath  who liv'd in the Neighbourhood which however made me a  little the more expensive to him I often expressed my concern to him about it but he bid me not be concern'd at it  AS he had furnish'd me very sufficiently with Money for the extraordinary Expences of my Lying Inn I had every thing very handsome about me but did not affect to be Gay or Extravagant neither besides knowing my own Circumstances and knowing the World as I had done and that such kind of things do not often last long I took care to lay up as much Money as I could for a wet Day as I call'd it making him believe it was all spent upon the extraordinary appearance of things in my Lying Inn  BY this means and including what he had given me as above I had at the end of my Lying Inn about Guineas by me including also what was left of my own  I WAS brought to Bed of a fine Boy indeed and a charming Child it was and when he heard of it he wrote me a very kind obliging Letter about it and then told me he thought it would look better for me to come away for  London  as soon as I was up and well that he had provided Appartments for me at  Hammersmith  as if I came thither only from  London  and that after a little while I should go back to the  Bath  and he would go with me  I LIK'D this offer very well and accordingly hir'd a Coach on purpose and taking my Child and a WetNurse to Tend and Suckle it and a Maid Servant with me away I went for  London    HE met me at  Reading  in his own Chariot and taking me into that left the Servant and the Child in the hir'd Coach and so he brought me  to my new Lodgings at  Hammersmith  with which I had abundance of Reason to be very well pleas'd for they were very handsome Rooms and I was very well accommodated  AND now I was indeed in the height of what I might call my Prosperity and I wanted nothing but to be a Wife which however could not be in this Case there was no room for it and therefore on all Occasions I study'd to save what I could as I have said above against a time of scarcity knowing well enough that such things as these do not always continue that Men that keep Mistresses often change them grow weary of them or Jealous of them or something or other happens to make them withdraw their Bounty and sometimes the Ladies that are thus well us'd are not careful by a prudent Conduct to preserve the Esteem of their Persons or the nice Article of their Fidelity and then they are justly cast off with Contempt  BUT I was secur'd in this Point for as I had no Inclination to change so I had no manner of Acquaintance in the whole House and so no Temptation to look any farther I kept no Company but in the Family where I Lodg'd and with a Clergyman's Lady at next Door so that when he was absent I visited no Body nor did he ever find me out of my Chamber or Parlor whenever he came down if I went any where to take the Air it was always with him  THE living in this manner with him and his with me was certainly the most undersigned thing in the World he often protested to me that when he became first acquainted with me and even to the very Night when we first broke in upon our Rules he never had the least Design  of lying with me that he always had a sincere Affection for me but not the least real inclination to do what he had done I assur'd him I never suspected him that if I had I should not so easily have yielded to the freedoms which brought it on but that it was all a surprize and was owing to the Accident of our having yielded too far to our mutual Inclinations that Night and indeed I have often observ'd since and leave it as a caution to the Readers of this Story that we ought to be cautious of gratifying our Inclinations in loose and lewd Freedoms least we find our Resolutions of Virtue fail us in the juncture when their Assistance should be most necessary  IT is true  and I have confess'd it before  that from the first hour I began to converse with him I resolv'd to let him lye with me if he offer'd it but it was because I wanted his help and assistance and I knew no other way of securing him than that But when we were that Night together and as I have said had gone such a length I found my Weakness the Inclination was not to be resisted but I was oblig'd to yield up all even before he ask'd it  HOWEVER he was so just to me that he never upbraided me with that nor did he ever express the least dislike of my Conduct on any other Occasion but always protested he was as much delighted with my Company as he was the first Hour we came together I mean came together as Bedfellows  IT is true that he had no Wife that is to say she was as no Wife to him and so I was in no Danger that way but the just Reflections of Conscience oftentimes snatch a Man especially a Man  of Sense from the Arms of a Mistress as it did him at last tho' on another Occasion  ON the other hand tho' I was not without secret Reproaches of my own Conscience for the Life I led and that even in the greatest height of the Satisfaction I ever took yet I had the terrible prospect of Poverty and Starving which lay on me as a frightful Spectre so that there was no looking behind me But as Poverty brought me into it so fear of Poverty kept me in it and I frequently resolv'd to leave it quite off if I could but come to lay up Money enough to maintain me But these were Thoughts of no weight and whenever he came to me they vanish'd for his Company was so delightful that there was no being melancholly when he was there the Reflections were all the Subject of those Hours when I was alone  I LIV'D six Year in this happy but unhappy Condition in which time I brought him three Children but only the first of them liv'd and tho' I remov'd twice in those six Years yet I came back the sixth Year to my first Lodgings at  Hammersmith  Here it was that I was one Morning surpriz'd with a kind but melancholy Letter from my Gentleman intimating that he was very ill and was afraid he should have another fit of Sickness but that his Wife's Relations being in the House with him it would not be practicable to have me with him which however he express'd his great Dissatisfaction in and that he wish'd I cou'd be allowed to Tend and Nurse him as I did before  I WAS very much concern'd at this Account and was very impatient to know how it was with him I waited a Fortnight or thereabouts and  heard nothing which surpriz'd me and I began to be very uneasy indeed I think I may say that for the next Fortnight I was near to distracted It was my particular difficulty that I did not know directly where he was for I understood at first he was in the Lodgings of his Wive's Mother but having remov'd my self to  London  I soon found by the help of the Direction I had for writing my Letters to him how to enquire after him and there I found that he was at a House in  Bloomsbury  whether he had a little before he fell Sick remov'd his whole Family and that his Wife and Wives Mother were in the same House tho' the Wife was not suffered to know that she was in the same House with her Husband  HERE I also soon understood that he was at the last Extremity which made me almost at the last Extremity too to have a true account One Night I had the Curiosity to disguise my self like a Servant Maid in a Round Cap and Straw Hat and went to the Door as sent by a Lady of his Neighbourhood where he liv'd before and giving Master and Mistresses Service I said I was sent to know how Mr did and how he had rested that Night in delivering this Message I got the opportunity I desir'd for speaking with one of the Maids I held a long Gossips Tale with her and had all the Particulars of his Illness which I found was a Pleurisie attended with a Cough and a Fever she told me also who was in the House and how his Wife was who by her Relation they were in some hopes might Recover her Understanding but as to the Gentleman himself  in short  she told me the Doctors said there was very little hopes of him that in the Morning they thought he had been dying and  that he was but little better then for they did not expect that he could live over the next Night  THIS was heavy News for me and I began now to see an end of my Prosperity and to see also that it was very well I had play'd the good Housewife and secur'd or saved something while he was alive for that now I had no view of  my own living  before me  IT lay very heavy upon my Mind too that I had a Son a fine lovely Boy above five Years old and no Provision made for it at least that I knew of with these Considerations and a sad Heart I went home that Evening and began to cast with my self how I should live and in what manner to bestow my self for the residue of my Life  YOU may be sure I could not rest without enquiring again very quickly what was become of him and not venturing to go my self I sent several sham Messengers till after a Fortnights waiting longer I found that there was hopes of his Life tho' he was still very ill then I abated my sending any more to the House and in some time after I learnt in the Neighbourhood that he was about House and then that he was Abroad again  I MADE no doubt then but that I shou'd soon hear of him and began to comfort my self with my Circumstances being as I thought recovered I waited a Week and two Weeks and with much surprize and amazement I waited near two Months and heard nothing but that being recover'd he was gone into the Country for the Air and for the better Recovery after his Distemper after this it was yet two Months more and then I understood  he was come to his CityHouse again but still I heard nothing from him  I HAD written several Letters for him and Directed them as usual and found two or three of them had been call'd for  but not the rest  I wrote again in a more pressing manner than ever and in one of them let him know that I must before'd to wait on him myself Representing my Circumstances the Rent of Lodgings to pay and the Provision for the Child wanting and my own deplorable Condition destitute of Subsistence after his most solemn Engagement to take Care of and Provide for me I took a Copy of this Letter and finding it lay at the House near a Month and was not call'd for I found means to have the Copy of it put into his own Hands at a CoffeeHouse where I had by Enquiry found he us'd to go  THIS Letter forc'd an Answer from him by which tho' I found I was to be abandon'd yet I found he had sent a Letter to me sometime before desiring me to go down  to the Bath again  its Contents I shall come to presently  IT is True that Sick Beds are the times when such Correspondences as this are look'd on with different Countenance and seen with other Eyes then we saw them with or than they appear'd with before My Lover had been at the Gates of Death and at the very brink of Eternity and it seems had been strook with a due remorse and with sad Reflections upon his past Life of Gallantry and Levity and among the rest this criminal Correspondence with me which was neither more or less than a long continu'd Life of Adultery had represented it self as it really was not as it had been formerly thought by  him to be and he look'd upon it now with a just and a religious Aborrence  I cannot but observe also and leave it for the Direction of my Sex in such Cases of Pleasure that when ever sincere Repentance succeeds such a Crime as this there never fails to attend a Hatred of the Object and the more the Affection might seem to be before the Hatred will be the more in Proportion It will always be so indeed it can be no otherwise for there cannot be a true and sincere Abhorrence of the Offence  the Love to the Cause of it remain there will with an Abhorrence of the Sin be found a detestation of the fellow Sinner you can expect no other  I found it so here tho' good Manners and Justice in this Gentleman kept him from carrying it on to any extream but the short History of his Part in this Affair was thus he perceiv'd by my last Letter and by all the rest which he went for after that I was not gone to the  Bath  that his first Letter had not come to my Hand upon which he writes me this following  Madam  I AM surpriz'd that my Letter Dated the th of last Month did not come to your Hand I give you my Word it was deliver'd at your Lodgings and to the Hands of your Maid  I NEED not acquaint you with what has been my Condition for sometime past and how having been at the Edge of the Grave I am by the unexpected and undeserv'd Mercy of Heaven restor'd again In the Condition I have been in it cannot be strange to you that our unhappy Correspondence has not been the least of  the Burthens which lay upon my Conscience I need say no more those things that must be repented of must be also reform'd  I WISH you would think of going back to the  Bath  I enclose you here a Bill for  l  for clearing your self at your Lodgings and carrying you down and hope it will be no surprize to you to add that on this account only and not for any Offence given me on your side I can SEE YOU NO MORE I will take due care of the Child leave him where he is or take him with you as you please I wish you the like Reflections and that they may be to your Advantage I am  c  I WAS struck with this Letter as with a thousand Wounds such as I cannot describe the Reproaches of my own Conscience were such as I cannot express for I was not blind to my own Crime and I reflected that I might with less Offence have continued with my Brother and liv'd with him as a Wife since there was no Crime in our Marriage on that score neither of us knowing it  BUT I never once reflected that I was all this while a marry'd Woman a Wife to Mr the Linner Draper who tho' he had left me by the Necessity of his Circumstances had no power to Discharge me from the Marriage Contract which was between us or to give me a legal liberty to marry again so that I had been no less than a Whore and an Adultress all this while I then reproach'd my self with the Liberties I had taken and how I had been a Snare to this Gentleman and that indeed I was principal in the Crime that now he was mercifully snatch'd out of the Gulph by a convincing Work upon his  Mind but that I was left as if I was forsaken of God's Grace and abandon'd by Heaven to a continuing in my wickedness  UNDER these Reflections I continu'd very pensive and sad for near a Month and did not go down to the  Bath  having no inclination to be with the Woman who I was with before least as I thought she should prompt me to some wicked course of Life again as she had done and besides I was very loth she should know I was cast off as above  AND now I was greatly perplex'd about my little Boy it was Death to me to part with the Child and yet when I consider'd the Danger of being one time or other left with him to keep without a Maintenance to support him I then resolv'd to leave him where he was but then I concluded also to be near him my self too that I might have the satisfaction of seeing him without the Care of providing for him  I sent my Gentleman a short Letter therefore that I had obey'd his Orders in all things but that of going back to the  Bath  which I cou'd not think of for many Reasons that however parting from him was a Wound to me that I could never recover yet that I was fully satisfied his Reflections were just and would be very far from desiring to obstruct his Reformation or Repentance  THEN I represented my own Circumstances to him in the most moving Terms that I was able I told him that those unhappy Distresses which first mov'd him to a generous and an honest Friendship for me would I hope move him to a little concern for me now tho' the Criminal part of our Correspondence which I believed neither of us intended to fall into at that time was broken off  that I desir'd to Repent as sincerely as he had done but entreated him to put me in some Condition that I might not be expos'd to the Temptations which the Devil never fails to excite us to from the frightful prospect of Poverty and Distress and if he had the least Apprehensions of my being troublesome to him I beg'd he would put me in a Posture to go back to my Mother in  Virginia  from whence he knew I came and that would put an end to all his Fears on that account I concluded that if he would send me  l  more to facilitate my going away I would send him back a general Release and would promise never to disturb him more with any Importunities unless it was to hear of the welldoing of the Child who if I found my Mother living and my Circumstances able I would send for to come over to me and take him also effectually off of his Hands  THIS was indeed all a Cheat thus far  viz  that I had no intention to go to  Virginia  as the Account of my former Affairs there may convince any Body of but the business was to get this last Fifty Pounds of him if possible knowing well enough it would be the last Penny I was ever to expect  HOWEVER the Argument I us'd namely of giving him a general Release and never troubling him any more prevail'd effectually with him and he sent me a Bill for the Money by a Person who brought with him a general Release for me to sign and which I frankly sign'd and receiv'd the Money and thus tho' full sore against my will a final End was put to this Affair  AND here I cannot but reflect upon the unhappy Consequence of too great Freedoms between Persons stated as we were upon the pretence of innocent intentions Love of Friendship  and the like  for the Flesh has generally so great a share in those Friendships that it is great odds but inclination prevails at last over the most solemn Resolutions and that Vice breaks in at the breaches of Decency which really innocent Friendship ought to preserve with the greatest strictness but I leave the Readers of these things to their own just Reflections which they will be more able to make effectual than I who so soon forgot my self and am therefore but a very indifferent Monitor  I WAS now a single Person again  as I may call my self  I was loos'd from all the Obligations either of Wedlock or Mistresship in the World except my Husband the Linnen Draper who I having not now heard from in almost Fifteen Year no Body could blame me for thinking my self entirely freed from seeing also he had at his going away told me that if I did not hear frequently from him I should conclude he was dead and I might freely marry again to whom I pleas'd  I NOW began to cast up my Accounts I had by many Letters and much Importunity and with the Intercession of my Mother too had a second return of some Goods from my Brother  as I now call him  in  Virginia  to make up the Damage of the Cargo I brought away with me and this too was upon the Condition of my sealing a general Release to him and to send it him by his Correspondent at  Bristol  which though I thought hard of yet I was oblig'd to promise to do However  I manag'd so well in this case that I got my Goods away before the Release was sign'd and then I always found something or other to say to evade the thing and to put off the signing it at all till  at length  I pretended I must write to my Brother and have his Answer before I could do it  INCLUDING this Recruit and before I got the last  l  I found my strength to amount put all together to about  l  so that with that I had above  l  I had sav'd above  l  more but I met with a Disaster with that which was this that a Goldsmith in whose Hands I had trusted it broke so I lost  l  of my Money the Man's Composition not making above  l  out of his  l  I had a little Plate but not much and was well enough stock'd with Cloaths and Linnen  WITH this Stock I had the World to begin again but you are to consider that I was not now the same Woman as when I liv'd at  Redriff  for first of all I was near Years older and did not look the better for my Age nor for my Rambles to  Virginia  and back again and tho' I omitted nothing that might set me out to Advantage except Painting for that I never stoop'd to and had Pride enough to think I did not want it yet there would always be some difference seen between Five and Twenty and Two and Forty  I cast about innumerable ways for my future State of Life and began to consider very seriously what I should do  but nothing offer'd  I took care to make the World take me for something more than I was and had it given out that I was a Fortune and that my Estate was in my own Hands the last of which was very true the first of it was as above I had no Acquaintance which  was one of my worst Misfortunes and the Consequence of that was I had no adviser at least who cou'd advise and assist together and above all I had no Body to whom I could in confidence commit the Secret of any Circumstances to and could depend upon for their Secresie and Fidelity and I found by experience that to be Friendless is the worst Condition next to being in want that a Woman can be reduc'd to  I say a Woman  because 'tis evident Men can be their own Advisers and their own Directors and know how to work themselves out of Difficulties and into Business better than Women but if a Woman has no Friend to Communicate her Affairs to and to advise and assist her 'tis ten to one but she is undone nay and the more Money she has the more Danger she is in of being wrong'd and deceiv'd and this was my Case in the Affair of the Hundred Pound which I left in the Hand of the Goldsmith  as above  whose Credit it seems was upon the Ebb before but I that had no knowledge of things and no Body to consult with knew nothing of it and so lost my Money  IN the next place when a Woman is thus left desolate and void of Council she is just like a Bag of Money or a Jewel dropt on the Highway which is a Prey to the next Comer if a Man of Virtue and upright Principles happens to find it he will have it cried and the Owner may come to hear of it again but how many times shall such a thing fall into Hands that will make no scruple of siezing it for their own to once that it shall come into good Hands  THIS was evidently my Case for I was now a loose unguided Creature and had no Help no Assistance no Guide for my Conduct I knew  what I aim'd at and what I wanted but knew nothing how to pursue the End by direct means I wanted to be plac'd in a settled State of Living and had I happen'd to meet with a sober good Husband I should have been as faithful and true a Wife to him as Virtue it self could have form'd If I had been otherwise the Vice came in always at the Door of Necessity not at the Door of Inclination and I understood too well by the want of it what the value of a settl'd Life was to do any thing to forfeit the felicity of it nay I should have made the better Wife for all the Difficulties I had pass'd thro' by a great deal nor did I in any of the Times that I had been a Wife give my Husbands the least uneasiness on account of my Behaviour  BUT all this was nothing I found no encouraging Prospect I waited I liv'd regularly and with as much frugality as became my Circumstances but nothing offer'd nothing presented and the main Stock wasted apace what to do I knew not the Terror of approaching Poverty lay hard upon my Spirits I had some Money but where to place it I knew not nor would the Interest of it maintain me at least not in  London    AT length a new Scene open'd There was in the House where I Lodg'd a North Country Woman that went for a Gentlewoman and nothing was more frequent in her Discourse than her account of the cheapness of Provisions and the easie way of living in her County how plentiful and how cheap every thing was what good Company they kept and the like till at last I told her she almost tempted me to go and live in her County for I that was a Widow tho' I had sufficient  to live on yet had no way of encreasing it and that  London  was an expensive and extravagant Place that I found I could not live here under a Hundred Pound a Year unless I kept no Company no Servant made no Appearance and buried my self in Privacy as if I was oblig'd to it by Necessity  I SHOULD have observ'd that she was always made to believe as every Body else was that I was a great Fortune or at least that I had Three or Four Thousand Pounds if not more and all in my own Hands and she was mighty sweet upon me when she thought me inclin'd in the least to go into her Country she said she had a Sister liv'd near  Liverpool  that her Brother was a considerable Gentleman there and had a great Estate also in  Ireland  that she would go down there in about two Months and if I would give her my Company thither I should be as welcome as her self for a Month or more as I pleas'd till I should see how I lik'd the Country and if I thought fit to live there she would undertake they would take care tho' they did not entertain Lodgers themselves they would recommend me to some agreeable Family where I shou'd be plac'd to my content  IF this Woman had known my real Circumstances she would never have laid so many Snares and taken so many weary steps to catch a poor desolate Creature that was good for little when it was caught and indeed I whose case was almost desperate and thought I cou'd not be much worse was not very anxious about what might befall me provided they did me no personal Injury so I suffered my self tho' not without a great deal of Invitation and great Professions of sincere Friendship  and real Kindness  I say  I suffer'd my self to be prevail'd upon to go with her and accordingly I pack'd up my Baggage and put my self in a Posture for a Journey tho' I did not absolutely know whether I was to go  AND now I found my self in great Distress what little I had in the World was all in Money except as before a little Plate some Linnen and my Cloaths as for Houshold stuff I had little or none for I had liv'd always in Lodgings but I had not one Friend in the World with whom to trust that little I had or to direct me how to dispose of it and this perplex'd me Night and Day I thought of the Bank and of the other Companies in  London  but I had no Friend to commit the Management of it to and to keep and carry about with me Bank Bills Talleys Orders and such things I look'd upon it as unsafe that if they were lost my Money was lost and then I was undone and on the other hand I might be robb'd and perhaps murder'd in a strange place for them this perplex'd me strangely and what to do I knew not  IT came in my Thoughts one Morning that I would go to the  Bank  my self where I had often been to receive the Interest of some Bills I had which had Interest payable on them and where I had found the Clark to whom I applyed my self very Honest and Just to me and particularly so fair one time that when I had misstold my Money and taken less than my due and was coming away he set me to rights and gave me the rest which he might have put into his own Pocket  I WENT to him and represented my Case very plainly  and ask'd if he would trouble himself to be my Adviser who was a poor friendless Widow  and knew not what to do He told me  if I desir'd his Opinion of any thing within the reach of his Business he would do his Endeavour that I should not be wrong'd but that he would also help me to a good sober Person who was a grave Man of his Acquaintance who was a Clark in such business too tho' not in their House whose Judgment was good and whose Honesty I might depend upon  for  added he  I will answer for him and for every step he takes if he wrongs you  Madam  of one Farthing it shall lye at my door I will make it good  and he delights to assist People in such Cases he does it as an act of Charity  I WAS a little at a stand at this Discourse but after some pause I told him I had rather have depended upon him because I had found him honest but if that cou'd not be I would take his Recommendation sooner than any ones else  I dare say  Madam says he  that you will be as well satisfied with my Friend as with me and he is thoroughly able to assist you which I am not  it seems he had his Hands full of the Business of the Bank and had engag'd to meddle with no other Business than that of his Office which I heard afterwards but did not understand then He added that his Friend should take nothing of me for his Advice or Assistance and this indeed encourag'd me very much  HE appointed the same Evening after the Bank was shut and Business over for me to meet him and his Friend and indeed as soon as I saw his Friend and he began but to talk of the Affair I was fully satisfied that I had a very honest Man to deal with his Countenance spoke it and his Character as I heard afterwards was every where so good that I had no room for any more doubts upon me  AFTER the first meeting in which I only said what I had said before we parted and he appointed me to come the next Day to him  telling me  I might in the mean time satisfie my self of him by enquiry which however I knew not how well to do having no Acquaintance my self  ACCORDINGLY I met him the next Day when I entered more freely with him into my Case  I told him  my Circumstances at large that  I  was  a Widow  come over from  America  perfectly desolate and friendless that I had a little Money and but a little and was almost distracted for fear of losing it having no Friend in the World to trust with the management of it that I was going into the North of  England  to live cheap that my stock might not waste that I would willingly Lodge my Money in the Bank but that I durst not carry the Bills about me and the like as above and how to Correspond about it or with who I knew not  HE told me I might lodge the Money in the Bank as an Account and its being entred in the Books would entitle me to the Money at any time and if I was in the North I might draw Bills on the Cashire and receive it when I would but that then it would be esteem'd as running Cash and the Bank would give no Interest for it that I might buy Stock with it and so it would lye in store for me but that then if I wanted to dispose of it I must come up to Town on purpose to Transfer it and even it would be with some difficulty I should receive the half yearly Dividend unless I was here in Person or had some Friend I could trust with having the Stock in his Name to do it for me and that would have the same difficulty in it as before and with that he look'd hard  at me  and smil'd a little  at last  says he  why do you not get a head Steward Madam that may take you and your Money together into keeping and then you would have the trouble taken off of your Hands Ay Sir and the Money too it may be  said I  for truly  I find the hazard that way is as much as 'tis t'other way  but I remember  I said  secretly to my self I wish you would ask me the Question fairly I would consider very seriously on it before I said NO  HE went on a good way with me and I thought once or twice he was in earnest but to my real Affliction I found at last he had a Wife but when he own'd he had a Wife he shook his Head and said with some concern that indeed he had  a Wife  and  no Wife  I began to think he had been in the Condition of my late Lover and that his Wife had been Distemper'd or Lunatick or some such thing However we had not much more Discourse at that time but he told me he was in too much hurry of business then but that if I would come home to his House after their Business was over he would by that time consider what might be done for me to put my Affairs in a Posture of Security I told him I would come and desir'd to know where he liv'd He gave me a Direction in Writing and when he gave it me he read it to me and said there 'tis Madam if you dare trust your self with me Yes Sir  said I  I believe I may venture to trust you with my self for you have a Wife you say and I don't want a Husband besides I dare trust you with my Money which is all I have in the World and if that were gone I may trust my self any where  HE said some things in Jest that were very handsome and mannerly and would have pleas'd  me very well if they had been in earnest  but that pass'd over  I took the Directions and appointed to attend him at his House at seven a Clock the same Evening  WHEN I came he made several Proposals for my placing my Money in the Bank▪ in order to my having Interest for it but still some difficulty or other came in the way which he objected as not safe and I found such a sincere disinterested Honesty in him that I began to muse with my self that I had certainly found the honest Man I wanted and that I could never put my self into better Hands so I told him with a greal deal of frankness that I had never met with Man or Woman yet that I could trust or in whom I cou'd think my self safe but that I saw he was so disinterestedly concern'd for my safety that  I said  I would freely trust him with the management of that little I had if he would accept to be Steward for a poor Widow that could give him no Salary  HE smil'd and standing up with great Respect saluted me he told me he could not but take it very kindly that I had so good an Opinion of him that he would not deceive me that he would do any thing in his Power to serve me and expect no Sallary but that he cou'd not by any means accept of a Trust that it might bring him to be suspected of Selfinterest and that if I should die he might have Disputes with my Executors which he should be very loth to encumber himself with  I TOLD him if those were all his Objections I would soon remove them and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty for that  first  as for suspecting him if ever I should do it  now was the time to suspect him and not put the Trust into his Hands and whenever I did suspect him he could but throw it up then and refuse to go any farther  Then  as to Executors I assur'd him I had no Heirs nor any Relations in  England  and I would have neither Heirs or Executors but himself unless I should alter my Condition before I died and then his Trust and Trouble should cease together which however I had no prospect of yet but I told him if I died as I was it should be all his own and he would deserve it by being so faithful to me as I was satisfied he would be  HE chang'd his Countenance at this Discourse and ask'd me how I came to have so much good will for him and looking very much pleas'd said he might very lawfully wish he was a single Man for my sake I smil'd and told him that as he was not my offer could have no design upon him in it and to wish as he did was not to be allow'd 'twas Criminal to his Wife  HE told me I was wrong for  says he  Madam as I said before I have a Wife and no Wife and 'twould be no Sin to me to wish her hang'd if that were all I know nothing of your Circumstances that way Sir  said I  but it cannot be innocent to wish your Wife dead I tell you  says he again  she is a Wife and no Wife you don't know what I am or what she is  THAT'S true  said I  Sir I do not know what you are but I believe you to be an honest Man and that's the cause of all my Confidence in you  WELL well  says he  and so I am  I hope  too but I am something else too Madam for  says he  to be plain with you I am a  Cuckold  and she is a  Whore  he spoke it in a kind of Jest but it was  with such an awkward smile that I perceiv'd it was what stuck very close to him and he look'd dismally when he said it  THAT alters the case indeed Sir  said I  as to that part you were speaking of but  a Cuckold  you know may be an honest Man it does not alter that Case at all besides I think  said I  since your Wife is so dishonest to you you are too honest to her to own her for your Wife but that  said I  is what I have nothing to do with  NAY  says he  I do think to clear my Hands of her for to be plain with you Madam  added he  I am no contented Cuckold neither  On the other hand  I assure you it provokes me to the highest degree but I can't help my self she that will be  a Whore  will be a  Whore    I WAV'D the Discourse and began to talk of my Business but I found he could not have done with it so I let him alone and he went on to tell me all the Circumstances of his Case too long to relate here particularly that having been out of  England  some time before he came to the Post he was in she had had two Children in the mean time by an Officer of the Army and that when he came to  England  and upon her Submission took her again and maintain'd her very well yet she run away from him with a LinnenDraper's Apprentice robb'd him of what she could come at and continued to live from him still so that Madam  says he  she is a Whore not by Necessity which is the common Bait of your Sex but by Inclination and for the sake of the Vice  WELL I pitied him and wish'd him well rid of her and still would have talk'd of my Business but it would not do at last he looks steadily at  me  look you  Madam  says he  you came to ask Advice of me and I will serve you as faithfully as if you were my own Sister but I must turn the Tables since you oblige me to do it and are so friendly to me and I think I must ask advice of you  tell me what must a poor abus'd Fellow do with  a Whore  what can I do  to do my self Justice  upon her    ALAS  Sir says I  'tis a Case too nice for me to advise in but it seems she has run away from you so you are rid of her fairly what can you desire more Ay she is gone indeed  said he  but I am not clear of her for all that  THAT'S true  says I  she may indeed run you into Debt but the Law has furnish'd you with Methods to prevent that also you may Cry her down  as they call it    NO no  says he  that is not the Case neither I have taken care of all that 'tis not that part that I speak of but I would be rid of her so that I might marry again  WELL Sir  says I  then you must Divorce her if you can prove what you say you may certainly get that done and then I suppose you are free  THAT'S very tedious and expensive  says he    WHY  says I  if you can get any Woman you like to take your word I suppose your Wife would not dispute the Liberty with you that she takes herself  AY  says he  but 'twou'd be hard to bring an honest Woman to do that and for the other sort  says he  I have had enough of her to meddle with any more Whores  IT occurr'd to me presently I would have taken your word with all my Heart if you had but  ask'd me the Question but that was to my self  to him I reply'd  why you shut the Door against any honest Woman accepting you for you condemn all that should venture upon you at once and conclude that really a Woman that takes you now can't be honest  WHY  says he  I wish you would satisfie me that an honest Woman would take me I'd venture it and then turns short upon me  will you take me  Madam  THAT'S not a fair Question  says I  after what you have said however least you should think I wait only for a Recantation of it I shall answer you plainly NO  not I  my Business is of another kind with you and I did not expect you would have turn'd my serious Application to you in my own distracted Case into a Comedy  WHY Madam  says he  my Case is as distracted as yours can be and I stand in as much need of Advice as you do for I think if I have not Relief some where I shall be mad my self and I know not what course to take I protest to you  WHY Sir  says I  'tis easie to give Advice in your Case much easier than it is in mine speak then  says he  I beg of you for now you encourage me  Why  says I  if your Case is so plain as you say it is you may be legally Divorc'd and then you may find honest Women enough to ask the Question of fairly the Sex is not so scarce that you can want a Wife  WELL then  said he  I am in earnest I'll take your Advice but shall I ask you one Question seriously before hand  ANY Question  said I  but that you did before  NO that Answer will not do  said he  for in short that is the Question I shall ask  YOU may ask what Questions you please but you have my Answer to that already  said I  besides Sir  said I  can you think so Ill of me as that I would give any Answer to such a Question beforehand Can any Woman alive believe you in earnest or think you design any thing but to banter her  WELL well  says he  I do not banter you I am in earnest consider of it  But SIR  says I a little gravely  I came to you about my own Business I beg of you let me know what you will advise me to do  I WILL be prepar'd  says he  against you come again  NAY  says I  you have forbid my coming any more  WHY so  said he  and look'd a little surpriz'd  BECAUSE  said I  you can't expect I should visit you on the account you talk of  WELL  says he  you shall promise me to come again however and I will not say any more of it till I have gotten the Divorce but I desire you will prepare to be better condition'd when that's done for you shall be the Woman or I will not be Divorc'd at all Why I owe it to your unlooked for kindness if it were to nothing else but I have other Reasons too  HE could not have said any thing in the World that pleas'd me better however I knew that the way to secure him was to stand off while the thing was so remote as it appear'd to be and that it  was time enough to accept of it when he was able to perform it so I said very respectfully to him it was time enough to consider of these things when he was in a Condition to talk of them in the mean time I told him I was going a great way from him and he would find Objects enough to please him better▪ We broke off here for the present and he made me promise him to come again the next Day for his Resolutions upon my own Business which after some pressing I did tho' had he seen farther into me I wanted no pressing on that Account  I CAME the next Evening accordingly and brought my Maid with me  to let him see  that I kept a Maid but I sent her away as soon as I was gone in He would have had me let the Maid have staid but I would not but order'd her aloud to come for me again about Nine aClock but he forbid that and told me he would see me safe Home which by the way I was not very well pleas'd with supposing he might do that to know where I liv'd and enquire into my Character and Circumstances However I ventur'd that for all that the People there or thereabout knew of me was to my Advantage and all the Character he had of me after he had enquir'd was  that I was a Woman of Fortune  and that I was a very modest sober Body which whether true or not in the Main yet you may see how necessary it is for all Women who expect any thing in the World to preserve the Character of their Virtue even when perhaps they may have sacrific'd the Thing itself  I FOUND  and was not a little pleas'd with it  that he had provided a Supper for me I found also he liv'd very handsomely and had a House very  handsomely furnish'd all which I was rejoyc'd at indeed for I look'd upon it as all my own  WE had now a second Conference upon the Subject matter of the last Conference He laid his business very Home indeed he protested his Affection to me and indeed I had no room to doubt it he declar'd that it began from the first Moment I talk'd with him and long before I had mention'd leaving my Effects with him 'tis no matter when it begun  thought I  if it will but hold 'twill be well enough  He then told me  how much the offer I had made of trusting him with my Effects and leaving them to him had engag'd him so I intended it should  thought I  but then I thought you had been a single Man too After we had Supp'd I observ'd he press'd me very hard to drink two or three Glasses of Wine which however I declin'd but Drank one Glass or two He then told he had a Proposal to make to me which I should promise him I would not take ill if I should not grant it I told him I hop'd he would make no dishonourable Proposal to me especially in his own House and that if it was such I desir'd he would not propose it that I might not be oblig'd to offer any Resentment to him that did not become the respect I profess'd for him and the Trust I had plac'd in him in coming to his House and beg'd of him he would give me leave to go away and accordingly began to put on my Gloves and prepare to be gone tho' at the same time I no more intended it than he intended to let me  WELL he importun'd me not to talk of going he assur'd me he had no dishonourable thing in his Thoughts about me and was very far from offering any thing to me that was dishonourable and if I thought so he would chuse to say no more of it  THAT part I did not relish at all I told him I was ready to hear any thing that he had to say depending that he would say nothing unworthy of himself or unfit for me to hear upon this he told me his Proposal was this That I would Marry him tho' he had not yet obtain'd the Divorce from the Whore his Wife and to satisfie me that he meant honourably he would promise not to desire me to live with him or go to Bed to him till the Divorce was obtain'd My Heart said yes to this offer at first Word but it was necessary to Play the Hypocrite a little more with him so I seem'd to decline the Motion with some warmth and besides a little Condemning the thing as unfair told him that such a Proposal could be of no Signification but to entangle us both in great Difficulties for if he should not at last obtain the Divorce yet we could not dissolve the Marriage neither could we proceed in it so that if he was disappointed in the Divorce I left him to consider what a Condtion we should both be in  IN SHORT I carried on the Argument against this so far that I convinc'd him it was not a Proposal that had any Sense in it WELL then he went from it to another and that was that I would Sign and Seal a Contract with him Conditioning to Marry him as soon as the Divorce was obtain'd and to be void if he could not obtain it  I TOLD him such a thing was more Rational than the other but as this was the first time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in earnest in this Affair I did not use to say YES at first asking I would consider of it  I PLAY'D with this Lover as an Angler does with a Trout I found I had him fast on the Hook so I jested with his new Proposal and put him  off I told him he knew little of me and bad him enquire about me I let him also go Home with me to my Lodging tho' I would not ask him to go in for I told him it was not Decent  IN SHORT I ventur'd to avoid Signing a Contract of Marriage and the Reason why I did it was because the Lady that had invited me so earnestly to go with her into  Lancashire  insisted so possitively upon it and promised me such great Fortunes and such fine things there that I was tempted to go and try perhaps  said I  I may mend myself very much and then I made no scruple in my Thoughts of quitting my honest Citizen who I was not so much in Love with as not to leave him for a Richer  IN a Word I avoided a Contract but told him I would go into the  North  that he should know where to write to me by the Consequence of the Business I had entrusted with him that I would give him a sufficient Pledge of my Respect for him for I would leave almost all I had in the World in his Hands and I would thus far give him my Word that as soon as he had su'd out a Divorce from his first Wife if he would send me an Account of it I would come up to  London  and that then we would talk seriously of the Matter  IT was a base Design I went with  that I must confess  tho' I was invited thither with a Design much worse than mine was as the Sequel will discover well I went with my Friend  as I call'd her  into  Lancashire  all the way we went the Caressed me with the utmost appearance of a sincere undissembled Affection treated me except my Coach hire all the way and her Brother brought a Gentleman's Coach to  Warrington  to receive us and we were carried from thence to  Liverpool  with as much Ceremony as I could desire We were also  entertain'd at a Merchant's House in  Liverpool  three or four Days very handsomely I forbear to tell his Name because of what follow'd then she told me she would carry me to an Uncles House of hers where we should be nobly entertain'd she did so her Uncle as she call'd him sent a Coach and four Horses for us and we were carried near forty Miles I know not whether  WE came however to a Gentleman's Seat where was a numerous Family a large Park extraordinry Company indeed and where she was call'd Cousin I told her if she had resolv'd to bring me into such Company as this she should have let me have prepar'd my self and have furnish'd my self with better Cloths the Ladies took notice of that and told me very genteely they did not value People in their Country so much by their Cloths as they did in  London  that their Cousin had fully inform'd them of my Quality and that I did not want Cloths to set me off in short they entertain'd me not like what I was but like what they thought I had been Namely a Widow Lady of a great Fortune  THE first Discovery I made here was that the Family were all  Roman Catholicks  and the Cousin too who I call'd my Friend however  I must say  that nothing in the World could behave better to me and I had all the Civility shown me that I could have had if I had been of their Opinion The Truth is I had not so much Principle of any kind as to be Nice in Point of Religion and I presently learn'd to speak favourably of the  Romish Church  particularly I told them I saw little but the prejudice of Education in all the Differences that were among Christians about Religion and if it had so happen'd that my Father  had been a  Roman Catholick  I doubted not but I should have been as well pleas'd with their Religion as my own  THIS oblig'd them in the highest Degree and as I was besieg'd Day and Night with good Company and pleasant Discourse so I had two or three old Ladies that lay at me upon the Subject of Religion too I was so Complaisant that tho' I would not compleatly engage yet I made no scruple to be present at their Mass and to conform to all their Gestures as they shew'd me the Pattern but I would not come too cheap so that I only in the main encourag'd them to expect that I would turn  Roman Catholick  if I was instructed in the  Catholick Doctrine  as they call'd it and so the matter rested  I STAY'D here about six Weeks and then my Conducter led me back to a Country Village about six Miles from  Liverpool  where her Brother as she call'd him came to Visit me in his own Chariot and in a very good Figure with two Footmen in a good Livery and the next thing was to make Love to me As it had happen'd to me one would think I could not have been cheated and indeed I thought so myself having a safe Card at home which I resolv'd not to quit unless I could mend myself very much However in all appearance this Brother was a Match worth my lissening to and the least his Estate was valued at was a  l  a Year but the Sister said it was worth  l  a Year and lay most of it in  Ireland    I THAT was a great Fortune and pass'd for such was above being ask'd how much my Estate was and my false Friend taking it upon a foolish hearsay had rais'd it from  l  to  l  and by the time she came into the Country she call'd it    l  the  Irishman  for such I understood him to be was stark Mad at this Bait In short he Courted me made me Presents and run in Debt like a mad Man for the Expences of his Equipage and of his Courtship He had to give him his due the Appearance of an extraordinary fine Gentleman he was Tall well Shap'd and had an extraordinary Address talk'd as naturally of his Park and his Stables of his Horses his GameKeepers his Woods his Tenants and his Servants as if we had been in the MansionHouse and I had seen them all about me  HE never so much as ask'd me about my Fortune or Estate but assur'd me that when we came to  Dublin  he would Joynture me in  l  a Year good Land and that he would enter into a Deed of Settlement or Contract here for the performance of it  THIS was such Language indeed as I had not been us'd to and I was here beaten out of all my Measures I had a she Devil in my Bosom every Hour telling me how great her Brother liv'd One time she would come for my Orders how I would have my Coaches painted and how lin'd and another time what Cloths my Page should wear In short my Eyes were dazl'd I had now lost my Power of saying No and to cut the Story short I consented to be married but to be the more private we were carried farther into the Country and married by a Romish Clergyman which I was assur'd would marry us as effectually as a Church of  England  Parson  I CANNOT say but I had some Reflections in this Affair upon the dishonourable forsaking my faithful Citizen who lov'd me sincerely and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous  Whore by whom he had been indeed barbarously us'd and promis'd himself infinite Happiness in his new choice which choice was now giving up her self to another in a manner almost as scandalous as hers could be  BUT the glittering show of a great Estate and of fine Things which the deceived Creature that was now my Deceiver represented every Hour to my Imagination hurried me away and gave me no time to think of  London  or of any thing there much less of the Obligation I had to a Person of infinitely more real Merit than what was now before me  BUT the thing was done I was now in the Arms of my new Spouse who appear'd still the same as before great even to Magnificence and nothing less than a Thousand Pound a Year could support the ordinary Equipage he appear'd in  AFTER we had been marry'd about a Month he began to talk of my going to  Westchester  in order to embark for  Ireland  However he did not hurry me for we staid near three Weeks longer and then he sent to  Chester  for a Coach to meet us at the  Black Rock  as they call it overagainst  Liverpool  Thither we went in a fine Boat they call a Pinnace with six Oars his Servants and Horses and Baggage going in the Ferry Boat He made his excuse to me that he had no Acquaintance at  Chester  but he would go before and get some handsome Apartment for me at a private House I ask'd him how long we should stay at  Chester  he said not at all any longer than one Night or two but he would immediately hire a Coach to go to  Holyhead  then I told him he should by no means give himself the trouble to get private Lodgings for one Night or two for that  Chester  being a great Place I made no doubt but there would be very good Inns and Accommodation enough so we lodg'd at an Inn in the West Street not far from the Cathedral I forget what Sign it was at  HERE my Spouse talking of my going to  Ireland  ask'd me if I had no Affairs to settle at  London  before we went off I told him no not of any great Consequence but what might be done as well by Letter from  Dublin  Madam says he very respectfully I suppose the greatest part of your Estate which my Sister tells me is most of it in Money in the Bank of  England  lies secure enough but in case it requir'd Transferring or any way altering its Property it might be necessary to go up to  London  and settle those things before we went over  I SEEMED to look strange at it and told him I knew not what he meant that I had no Effects in the Bank of  England  that I knew of and I hoped he could not say that I had ever told him I had No he said I had not told him so but his Sister had said the greatest part of my Estate lay there and  I only mention'd it my Dear  said he  that if there was any occasion to settle it or order any thing about it we might not be oblig'd to the hazard and trouble of another Voyage back again  for he added that he did not care to venture me too much upon the Sea  I WAS surpriz'd at this talk and began to consider very seriously what the meaning of it must be and it presently occurr'd to me that my Friend who call'd him Brother had represented me in Colours which were not my due and I thought since it was come to that pitch that I would know the bottom of it before I went out of  England  and before I should put my self into I knew not whose Hands in a strange Country  UPON this I call'd his Sister into my Chamber the next Morning and letting her know the Discourse her Brother and I had been upon the Evening before I conjur'd her to tell me what she had said to him and upon what Foot it was that she had made this Marriage She own'd that she had told him that I was a great Fortune and said that she was told so at  London Told so  says I warmly  did I ever tell you so  No she said it was true I did not tell her so but I had said several times that what I had was in my own disposal I did so  return'd I very quickly and hastily  but I never told you I had any thing call'd a Fortune no not that I had one Hundred Pounds or the value of an Hundred Pounds in the World and how did it consist with my being a Fortune  said I  that I should come here into the North of  England  with you only upon the account of living cheap At these words which I spoke warm and sigh'd my Husband and her Brother as she call'd him came into the Room and I desir'd him to come and sit down for I had something of moment to say before them both which it was absolutely necessary he should hear  He look'd a little disturb'd at the assurance with which I seem'd to speak it and came and sat down by me having first shut the Door upon which I began for I was very much provok'd and turning my self to him I am afraid says I  my Dear  for I spoke with kindness on his side that you have a very great abuse put upon you and an Injury done you never to be repair'd in your marrying me which however as I have had no hand in it I desire I may be fairly acquitted of it  and that the blame may lie where it ought to lie and no where else for I wash my Hands of every part of it  WHAT Injury can be done me  my Dear  says he in marrying you I hope it is to my Honour and Advantage every way I will soon explain it to you says I and I fear you will have no reason to think your self well us'd but I will convince you  my Dear says I again  that I have had no hand in it and there I stop'd a while  HE look'd now scar'd and wild and began I believ'd to suspect what follow'd however looking towards me and saying only  go on  he sat silent as if to hear what I had more to say so I went on I ask'd you last Night said I▪ speaking to him if ever I made any boast to you of my Estate or ever told you I had any Estate in the Bank of  England  or any where else and you own'd I had not as is most true and I desire you will tell me here before your Sister if ever I gave you any Reason from me to think so or that ever we had any Discourse about it and he own'd again I had not  but said  I had appeared always as a Woman of Fortune and he depended on it that I was so and hoped he was not deceived I am not enquiring yet whether you have been deceived or not  said I  I fear you have  and I too  but I am clearing my self from the unjust Charge of being concern'd in deceiving you  I have been now asking your Sister if ever I told her of any Fortune or Estate I had or gave her any Particulars of it and she owns I never did And pray Madam  said I turning my self to her  be so just to me before your Brother to charge me if you can if ever I pretended to you that I had an Estate and why if I had should I  come down into this Country with you on purpose to spare  that little I had  and live cheap She could not deny one word but said she had been told in  London  that I had a very great Fortune and that It lay in the Bank of  England    AND now  Dear Sir  said I  turning my self to my new Spouse again  be so just to me as to tell me who has abus'd both you and me so much as to make you believe I was a Fortune and prompt you to court me to this Marriage He cou'd not speak a word but pointed to her and after some more pause flew out in the most furious Passion that ever I saw a Man in my Life cursing her and calling her all the Whores and hard Names he could think of and that she had ruin'd him declaring that she had told him I had Fifteen Thousand Pounds and that she was to have Five Hundred Pounds of him for procuring this Match for him He then added directing his Speech to me that she was none of his Sister but had been his Whore for two Years before that she had had One Hundred Pound of him in part of this Bargain and that he was utterly undone if things were as I said and in his raving  he swore  he would let her Heart's Blood out immediately which frighted her and me too  she cried  said she had been told so in the House where I Lodg'd but this aggravated him more than before that she should put so far upon him and run things such a length upon no other Authority than  a hearsay  and then turning to me again said very honestly he was afraid we were both undone for to be plain  my Dear  I have no Estate  says he  what little I had this Devil has made me run out in waiting on you and putting me into this Equipage she took the opportunity of his being earnest  in talking with me and got out of the Room and I never saw her more  I WAS confounded now as much as he and knew not what to say I thought many ways that I had the worst of it but his saying he was undone and that he had no Estate neither put me into a meer distraction why  says I to him  this has been a hellish Juggle for we are married here upon the foot of a double Fraud you are undone by the Disappointment it seems and if I had had a Fortune I had been cheated too for you say you have nothing  YOU would indeed have been cheated my Dear  says he  but you would not have been undone for Fifteen Thousand Pound would have maintain'd us both very handsomly in this Country and I assure you  added he  I had resolv'd to have dedicated every Groat of it to you I would not have wrong'd you of a Shilling and the rest I would have made up in my Affection to you and Tenderness of you as long as I liv'd  THIS was very honest indeed and I really believe he spoke as he intended and that he was a Man that was as well qualified to make me happy as to his Temper and Behaviour as any Man ever was but his having no Estate and being run into Debt on this ridiculous account in the Country made all the Prospect dismal and dreadful and I knew not what to say or what to think of my self  I TOLD him it was very unhappy that so much Love and so much Goodnature as I discovered in him should be thus precipated into Misery that I saw nothing before us but Ruin for as to me it was my unhappiness that what little I had was not able to relieve us a Week and with  that I pull'd out a Bank Bill of  l  and eleven Guineas which I told him I had saved out of my little Income and that by the account that Creature had given me of the way of living in that Country I expected it would maintain me three or four Year that if it was taken from me I was left destitute and he knew what the Condition of a Woman among strangers must be if she had no Money in her Pocket however I told him if he would take it there it was  HE told me with a great concern and I thought I saw Tears stand in his Eyes that he would not touch it that he abhorr'd the thoughts of stripping me and making me miserable that on the contrary he had Fifty Guineas left which was all he had in the World and he pull'd it out and threw it down on the Table bidding me take it tho' he were to starve for want of it  I RETURN'D with the same concern for him that I could not bear to hear him talk so that on the contrary if he could propose any probable method of living I would do any thing that became me on my part and that I would live as close and as narrow as he cou'd desire  HE beg'd of me to talk no more at that rate for it would make him Distracted he said he was bred a Gentleman tho' he was reduced to a low Fortune and that there was but one way left which he cou'd think of and that would not do unless I cou'd answer him one Question which however he said he would not press me to I told him I would answer it honestly whether it would be to his Satisfaction or no that I could not tell  WHY then my Dear tell me plainly  says he  will the little you have keep us together in any Figure or in any Station or Place or will it not  IT was my happiness hitherto that I had not discovered myself or my Circumstances at all no not so much as my Name and seeing there was nothing to be expected from him however good Humoured and however honest he seem'd to be but to live on what I knew would soon be wasted I resolv'd to conceal every thing but the  Bank Bill  and the Eleven Guineas which I had own'd and I would have been very glad to have lost that and have been set down where he took me up I had indeed another  Bank Bill  about me of  l  which was the whole of what I brought with me as well to Subsist on in the Country as not knowing what might offer because this Creature the  gobetween  that had thus betray'd us both had made me believe strange things of my Marrying to my Advantage in the Country and I was not willing to be without Money whatever might happen This Bill I concealed and that made me the freer of the rest in Consideration of his Circumstances for I really pittied him heartily  BUT to return to his Question I told him I never willingly Deceiv'd him and I never would I was very sorry to tell him that the little I had would not Subsist us that it was not sufficient to Subsist me alone in the  South  Country and that this was the Reason that made me put my self into the Hands of that Woman who call'd him Brother she having assur'd me that I might Board very handsomely at a Town call'd  Manchester  where I had not yet been for about six Pound a Year and my whole Income not being above  l  a Year I thought I might live easie upon it and wait for better things  HE shook his Head and remain'd Silent and a very melancholly Evening we had however we Supped together and lay together that Night and when we had almost Supp'd he look'd a little better and more chearful and call'd for a Bottle of Wine  come  my Dear  says he  tho' the Case is bad it is to no purpose to be dejected come be as easie as you can I will endeavour to find out some way or other to live if you can but Subsist your self that is better than nothing I must try the World again a Man ought to think like a Man To be Discourag'd is to yield to the Misfortune with this he fill'd a Glass and Drank to me holding my Hand and pressing it hard in his Hand all the while the Wine went down and Protesting afterward his main concern was for me  IT was really a truly gallant Spirit he was of and it was the more Grievous to me 'Tis something of Relief even to be undone by a Man of Honour rather than by a Scoundrel but here the greatest Disappointment was on his side for he had really spent a great deal of Money deluded by this Madam the Procuress and it was very remarkable on what poor Terms she proceeded first the baseness of the Creature herself is to be observ'd who for the getting One Hundred Pound herself could be content to let him spend Three or Four more tho' perhaps it was all he had in the World and more than all when she had not the least Ground more than a little TeaTable Chat to say that I had any Estate or was a Fortune  or the like  It is true the Design of deluding a Woman of a Fortune if I had been so was base enough the putting the Face of great Things  upon poor Circumstances was a Fraud and bad enough but the Case a little differ'd too and that in his Favour for he was not a Rake that made a Trade to delude Women and as some have done get six or seven Fortunes after one another and then riffle and run away from them but he was really a Gentleman unfortunate and low but had liv'd well and tho' if I had had a Fortune I should have been enrag'd at the Slut for betraying me yet really for the Man a Fortune would not have been ill bestow'd on him for he was a lovely Person indeed of generous Principles good Sense and of abundance of good Humour  WE had a great deal of close Conversation that Night for we neither of us Slept much he was as Penitent for having put all those Cheats upon me as if it had been Felony and that he was going to Execution he offer'd me again every Shilling of the Money he had about him and said he would go into the Army and seek the World for more  I ask'd him  why he would be so unkind to carry me into  Ireland  when I might suppose he cou'd not have Subsisted me there He took me in his Arms my Dear  said he  depend upon it I never design'd to go to  Ireland  at all much less to have carried you thither but came hither to be out of the Observation of the People who had heard what I pretended to and withal that No Body might ask me for Money before I was furnish'd to supply them  BUT where then  said I  were we to have gone next  WHY my Dear  said he  I'll confess the whole Scheme to you as I had laid it I purpos'd here to ask you something about your Estate as you see I did and when you as I expected you would had enter'd into some Account with me of the particular I would have made an excuse to you to have put off our Voyage to  Ireland  for some time and to have gone first towards  London    THEN my Dear  said he  I resolv'd to have confess'd all the Circumstances of my own Affairs to you and let you know I had indeed made use of these Artifices to obtain your Consent to marry me but had now nothing to do but to ask you Pardon and to tell you how abundantly  as I have said above  I would endeavour to make you forget what was past by the felicity of the Days to come  TRULY  said I to him  I find you would soon have conquer'd me and it is my Affliction now that I am not in a Condition to let you see how easily I should have been reconcil'd to you and have pass'd by all the Tricks you had put upon me in Recompence of so much good Humour but my Dear  said I  what can we do now We are both undone and what better are we for our being reconcil'd together seeing we have nothing to live on  WE propos'd a great many things but nothing could offer where there is nothing to begin with He beg'd me at last to talk no more of it for  he said  I would break his Heart so we talk'd of other things a little till at last he took a Husbands leave of me and so we went to Sleep  HE rise before me in the Morning and indeed having lain Awake almost all Night I was very sleepy and lay till near Eleven aClock in this time he  took his Horses and three Servants and all his Linnen and Bagage and away he went leaving a short but moving Letter for me on the Table as follows  MY DEAR  I  AM a Dog I have abus'd you but I have been drawn in to do it by a base Creature contrary to my Principle and the general Practice of my Life Forgive me  my Dear  I ask you Pardon with the greatest Sincerity I am the most miserable of Men in having deluded you I have been so happy to Possess you and am now so wretch'd as to be forc'd to fly from you Forgive me  my Dear  once more I say forgive me I am not able to see you Ruin'd by me and myself unable to Support you Our Marriage is nothing I shall never be able to see you again I here discharge you from it if you can Marry to your Advantage do not decline it on my Account I here swear to you on my Faith and on the Word of a Man of Honour I will never disturb your Repose if I should know of it which however is not likely On the other Hand if you should not Marry and if good Fortune should befall me it shall be all yours where ever you are  I HAVE put some of the Stock of Money I have left into your Pocket take Places for your self and your Maid in the StageCoach and go for London I hope it will bear your Charges thither without breaking into your own Again I sincerely ask your Pardon and will do so as often as I shall ever think of you  Adieu my Dear for Ever I am  yours most Affectionatly  A E  NOTHING that ever befel me in my Life sunk so deep into my Heart as this Farewel I reproach'd him a Thousand times in my Thoughts for leaving me for I would have gone with him thro' the World if I had beg'd my Bread I felt in my Pocket and there I found ten Guineas his Gold Watch and two little Rings one a small Diamond Ring worth only about six Pound and the other a plain Gold Ring  I SAT me down and look'd upon these Things two Hours together and scare spoke a Word till my Maid interrupted me by telling me my Dinner was ready I eat but little and after Dinner I fell into a vehement Fit of crying every now and then calling him by his Name which was  James O Jemy  said I  come back come back  I'll give you all I have I'll beg I'll starve with you and thus I run Raving about the Room several times and then sat down between whiles and then walking about again call'd upon him to  come back  and then cry'd again and thus I pass'd the Afternoon till about seven aClock when it was near Dusk in the Evening being  August  when to my unspeakable Surprize he comes back into the Inn but without a Servant and comes directly up into my Chamber  I WAS in the greatest Confusion imaginable and so was he too I could not imagine what should be the Occasion of it and began to be at odds with myself whether to be glad or sorry but my Affection byass'd all the rest and it was impossible to conceal my Joy which was too great for Smiles for it burst out into Tears He was no sooner entered the Room but he run to me and took me in his Arms holding me fast and almost stopping my Breath with his Kisses but spoke  not a Word at length I began my Dear  said I  how could you go away from me To which he gave no Answer for it was impossible for him to speak  WHEN our Extasies were a little over he told me he was gone about Mile but it was not in his Power to go any farther without coming back to see me again and to take his Leave of me once more  I TOLD him how I had pass'd my time and how loud I had call'd him to  come back again  he told me he heard me very plain upon  Delamere Forest  at a Place about Miles off  I smil'd Nay says he  do not think I am in Jest for if ever I heard your Voice in my Life I heard you call me a loud and sometimes I thought I saw you running after me why said I what did I say for I had not nam'd the Words to him you call'd aloud says he and said  O Jemy O Jemy come back come back  I Laught at him  my Dear says he  do not Laugh for depend upon it I heard your Voice as plain as you hear mine now if you please I'll go before a Magistrate and make Oath of it I then began to be amaz'd and surpriz'd and indeed frighted and told him what I had really done and how I had call'd after him as above  WHEN we had amus'd ourselves a while about this I said to him well you shall go away from me no more I'll go all over the World with you rather  He told me  it would be a very difficult thing for him to leave me but since it must be he hoped I would make it as easie to me as I could but as for him it would be his Destruction that he foresaw  HOWEVER he told me that he Consider'd he had left me to Travel to  London  alone which was too long a Journey and that as he might as well go that way as any way else he was resolv'd to see me safe thither or near it and if he did go away then without taking his leave I should not take it ill of him and this he made me promise  HE told me how he had dismiss'd his three Servants sold their Horses and sent the Fellows away to seek their Fortunes and all in a little time at a Town on the Road I know not where and  says he  it cost me some Tears all alone by myself to think how much happier they were than their Master for they could go to the next Gentleman's House to see for a Service whereas  said he  I knew not whether to go or what to do with myself  I TOLD him I was so compleatly miserable in parting with him that I could not be worse and that now he was come again I would not go from him if he would take me with him let him go whether he would or do what he would and in the mean time I agreed that we would go together to  London  but I could not be brought to Consent he should go away at last and not take his leave of me as he propos'd to do but told him Jesting that if he did I would call him back again as loud as I did before Then I pull'd out his Watch and gave him back and his two Rings and his Ten Guineas but he would not take them which made me very much suspect that he resolv'd to go off upon the Road and leave me  THE truth is the Circumstances he was in the passionate Expressions of his Letter the kind Gentlemanly Treatment I had from him in all the Affair with the Concern he show'd for me in it  his manner of Parting with that large Share which he gave me of his little Stock left all these had joyn'd to make such Impressions on me that I really lov'd him most tenderly and could not bear the Thoughts of parting with him  TWO Days after this we quitted  Chester  I in the Stage Coach and he on Horseback I dismiss'd my Maid at  Chester  he was very much against my being without a Maid but she being a Servant hired in the Country and I resolving to keep no Servant at  London  I told him it would have been barbarous to have taken the poor Wench and have turn'd her away as soon as I came to Town and it would also have been a needless Charge on the Road so I satisfy'd him and he was easie enough on that Score  HE came with me as far as  Dunstable  within Miles of  London  and then he told me Fate and his own Misfortunes oblig'd him to leave me and that it was not Convenient for him to go to  London  for Reasons which it was of no value to me to know and I saw him preparing to go The Stage Coach we were in did not usually stop at  Dunstable  but I desiring it but for a Quarter of an Hour they were content to stand at an InnDoor a while and we went into the House  BEING in the Inn I told him I had but one Favour more to ask of him and that was that since he could not go any farther he would give me leave to stay a Week or two in the Town with him that we might in that time think of something to prevent such a ruinous thing to us both as a final Separation would be and that I had something of Moment to offer to him that I had never said yet and which perhaps he might find Practicable to our mutual Advantage  THIS was too reasonable a Proposal to be denied so he call'd the Landlady of the House  and told her  his Wife was taken ill and so ill that she cou'd not think of going any farther in the Stage Coach which had tyr'd her almost to Death and ask'd if she cou'd not get us a Lodging for two or three Days in a private House where I might rest me a little for the Journey had been too much for me The Landlady a good sort of Woman well bred and very obliging came immediately to see me  told me  she had two or three very good Rooms in a part of the House quite out of the noise and if I saw them she did not doubt but I would like them and I should have one of her Maids that should do nothing else but be appointed to wait on me this was so very kind that I could not but accept of it and thank her so I went to look on the Rooms and lik'd them very well and indeed they were extraordinarily Furnish'd and very pleasant Lodgings so we paid the Stage Coach took out our Baggage and resolv'd to stay here a while  HERE  I told him  I would live with him now till all my Money was spent but would not let him spend a Shilling of his own We had some kind squabble about that but  I told him  it was the last time I was like to enjoy his Company and I desir'd he would let me be Master in that thing only and he should govern in every thing else so he acquiesc'd  HERE one Evening taking a Walk into the Fields  I told him  I would now make the Proposal to him I had told him of accordingly I related to him how I had liv'd in  Virginia  that I had a Mother I believ'd was alive there still tho' my Husband was dead some Years  I told him  that  had not my Effects miscarry'd which by the way I magnify'd pretty much I might have been Fortune good enough to him to have kept us from being parted in this manner Then I entered into the manner of Peoples going over to those Countries to settle how they had a quantity of Land given them by the Constitution of the Place and if not that it might be purchased at so easie a Rate that it was not worth naming  I THEN gave him a full and distinct account of the nature of Planting how with carrying over but two or three Hundred Pounds value in  English  Goods with some Servants and Tools a Man of Application would presently lay a Foundation for a Family and in a very few Years be certain to raise an Estate  I LET him into the nature of the Product of the Earth how the Ground was Cur'd and Prepared and what the usual encrease of it was and demonstrated to him that in a very few Years with such a beginning we should be as certain of being Rich as we were now certain of being Poor  HE was surpriz'd at my Discourse for we made it the whole Subject of our Conversation for near a Week together in which time I laid it down in black and white  as we say  that it was morally impossible with a supposition of any reasonable good Conduct but that we must thrive there and do very well  THEN I told him what measures I would take to raise such a Sum as  l  or thereabouts and I argued with him how good a Method it would be to put an end to our Misfortunes and restore our Circumstances in the World to what we had both expected and I added that after seven Years if  we liv'd we might be in a Posture to leave our Plantation in good Hands and come over again and receive the Income of it and live here and enjoy it and I gave him Examples of some that had done so and liv'd now in very good Circumstances in  London    IN short I press'd him so to it that he almost agreed to it but still something or other broke it off again till at last he turn'd the Tables and he began to talk almost to the same purpose of  Ireland    HE told me that a Man that could confine himself to a Country Life and that cou'd but find Stock to enter upon any Land should have Farms there for  l  a Year as good as were here let for  l  a Year that the Produce was such and so Rich the Land that if much was not laid up we were sure to live as handsomely upon it as a Gentleman of  l  a Year could do in  England  and that he had laid a Scheme to leave me in  London  and go over and try and if he found he could lay a handsome Foundation of living suitable to the Respect he had for me as he doubted not he should do he would come over and fetch me  I WAS dreadfully afraid that upon such a Proposal he would have taken me at my Word  viz  to sell my little Income as I call'd it and turn it into Money and let him carry it over into  Ireland  and try his Experiment with it but he was too just to desire it or to have accepted it if I had offered it and he anticipated me in that for he added that he would go and try his Fortune that way and if he found he cou'd do any thing at it to live then by adding mine to it when I went over we should live like our selves but  that he would not hazard a Shilling of mine till he had made the Experiment with a little and he assur'd me that if he found nothing to be done in  Ireland  he would then come to me and join in my Project for  Virginia    HE was so earnest upon his Project being to be try'd first that I cou'd not withstand him how ever he promis'd to let me hear from him in a very little time after his arriving there to let me know whether his prospect answer'd his Design that if there was not a probability of Success I might take the Occasion to prepare for our other Voyage and then he assur'd me he would go with me to  America  with all his Heart  I COULD bring him to nothing farther than this However those Consultations entertain'd us near a Month during which I enjoy'd his Company which indeed was the most entertaining that ever I met with in my life before In this time he let me into the whole Story of his own Life which was indeed surprizing and full of an infinite Variety sufficient to fill up a much brighter History for its Adventures and Incidents than any I ever saw in Print But I shall have occasion to say more of him hereafter  WE parted at last tho' with the utmost reluctance on my side and indeed he took his leave very unwillingly too but Necessity oblig'd him for his Reasons were very good why he would not come to  London  as I understood more fully some time afterwards  I GAVE him a Direction how to write to me tho' still I reserv'd the grand Secret and never broke my Resolution which was not to let him ever know my true Name who I was or where  to be found he likewise let me know how to write a Letter to him so that he said he wou'd be sure to receive it  I CAME to  London  the next Day after we parted but did not go directly to my old Lodgings but for another nameless Reason took a private Lodging in St  John's street  or as it is vulgarly call'd St  Jones's  near  Clarkenwell  and here being perfectly alone I had leisure to sit down and reflect seriously upon the last seven Months Ramble I had made for I had been abroad no less the pleasant Hours I had with my last Husband I look'd back on with an infinite deal of Pleasure but that Pleasure was very much lessen'd when I found some time after that I was really with Child  THIS was a perplexing thing because of the Difficulty which was before me where I should get leave to Lye Inn it being one of the nicest things in the World at that time of Day for a Woman that was a Stranger and had no Friends to be entertain'd in that Circumstance without Security which by the way I had not neither could I procure any  I HAD taken care all this while to preserve a Correspondence with my honest Friend at the Bank or rather he took care to Correspond with me for he wrote to me once a Week and tho' I had not spent my Money so fast as to want any from him yet I often wrote also to let him know I was alive I had left Directions in  Lancashire  so that I had these Letters which he sent convey'd to me and during my Recess at St  Jones  's I receiv'd a very obliging Letter from him assuring me that his Process for a Divorce from his  Wife went on with Success tho' he met with some Difficulties in it that he did not expect  I WAS not displeas'd with the News that his Process was more tedious than he expected for tho' I was in no condition to have had him yet not being so foolish to marry him when I knew my self to be with Child by another Man as some I know have ventur'd to do yet I was not willing to lose him and in a word resolv'd to have him if he continu'd in the same mind as soon as I was up again for I saw apparently I should hear no more from my other Husband and as he had all along press'd me to Marry and had assur'd me he would not be at all disgusted at it or ever offer to claim me again so I made no scruple to resolve to do it if I could and if my other Friend stood to his Bargain and I had a great deal of Reason to be assur'd that he would stand to it by the Letters he wrote to me which were the kindest and most obliging that could be  I NOW grew Big and the People where I Lodg'd perceiv'd it and began to take notice of it to me and as far as Civility would allow intimated that I must think of removing this put me to extreme perplexity and I grew very melancholy for indeed I knew not what Course to take I had Money but no Friends and was like now to have a Child upon my Hands to keep which was a difficulty I had never had upon me yet as the Particulars of my Story hitherto makes appear  IN the course of this Affair I fell very ill and my Melancholy really encreas'd my Distemper my illness prov'd at length to be only an Ague but my Apprehensions were really that I should Miscarry  I should not say Apprehensions for indeed I would have been glad to miscarry but I cou'd never be brought to entertain so much as a thought of endeavouring to Miscarry or of taking any thing to make me Miscarry I abhorr'd I say so much as the thought of it  HOWEVER speaking of it in the House the Gentlewoman who kept the House propos'd to me to send for a Midwife I scrupled it at first but after some time consented to it but told her I had no particular Acquaintance with any Midwife and so left it to her  IT seems the Mistress of the House was not so great a Stranger to such Cases as mine was as I thought at first she had been as will appear presently and she sent for a Midwife of the right sort that is to say the right sort for me  THE Woman appear'd to be an experienc'd Woman in her Business I mean as a Midwife but she had another Calling too in which she was as expert as most Women if not more My Landlady had told her I was very Melancholy and that she believ'd that had done me harm and once  before me  said to her Mrs  B meaning the Midwife  I believe this Lady's Trouble is of a kind that is prety much in your way and therefore if you can do any thing for her pray do for she is a very civil Gentlewoman and so she went out of the Room  I REALLY did not understand her but my Mother Midnight began very seriously to explain what she meant as soon as she was gone Madam  says she  you seem not to understand what your Landlady means and when you do understand it you need not let her know at all that you do so  SHE means that you are under some Circumstances that may render your LyingInn difficult to you and that you are not willing to be expos'd I need say no more but to tell you that if you think fit to communicate so much of your Case to me  if it be so  as is necessary for I do not desire to pry into those things I perhaps may be in a Condition to assist you and to make you perfectly easie and remove all your dull Thoughts upon that Subject  EVERY word this Creature said was a Cordial to me and put new Life and new Spirit into my very Heart my Blood began to circulate immediately and I was quite another Body I eat my Victuals again and grew better presently after it She said a great deal more to the same purpose and then having press'd me to be free with her and promis'd in the solemnest manner to be secret she stop'd a little as if waiting to see what Impression it made on me and what I would say  I WAS too sensible of the want I was in of such a Woman not to accept her offer  I told her  my Case was partly as she guess'd and partly not for I was really married and had a Husband tho' he was in such Circumstances and so remote at that time as that he cou'd not appear publickly  SHE took me short  and told me  that was none of her Business all the Ladies that came under her Care were married Women to her every Woman  says she  that is with Child has a Father for it and whether that Father was a Husband or no Husband was no Business of hers her Business was to assist me in my present Circumstances whether I had a Husband or no for  Madam says she  to have a Husband that cannot appear is to  have no Husband in the sense of the Case and therefore whether you are a Wife or a Mistress is all one to me  I FOUND presently that whether I was a Whore or a Wife I was to pass for a Whore here so I let that go  I told her  it was true as she said but that however if I must tell her my Case I must tell it her as it was So I related it to her as short as I could and I concluded it to her thus  I trouble you with all this  Madam said I  not that as you said before it is much to the purpose  in your Affair but this is to the purpose  namely that I am not in any pain about being seen or being publick or conceal'd for 'tis perfectly indifferent to me but my difficulty is that I have no Acquaintance in this part of the Nation    I UNDERSTAND you Madam  says she  you have no Security to bring to prevent the Parish Impertinences usual in such Cases and perhaps  says she  do not know very well how to dispose of the Child when it comes the last  says I  is not so much my concern as the first Well Madam  answers the Midwife  dare you put your self into my Hands I live in such a place tho' I do not enquire after you you may enquire after me my Name is  B  I live in such a Street naming the Street at the Sign of the  Cradle  my Profession is a Midwife and I have many Ladies that come to my House to LyeInn I have given Security to the Parish in General Terms to secure them from any Charge from whatsoever shall come into the World under my Roof I have but one Question to ask in the whole Affair Madam  says she  and if that be answer'd you shall be entirely easie for all the rest  I presently understood what she meant and told her Madam  I believe I understand you  I thank God  tho' I want Friends in this Part of the World I do not want Money so far as may be Necessary tho' I do not abound in that neither  This I added because I would not make her expect great things well Madam  says she  that is the thing indeed without which nothing can be done in these Cases and yet  says she  you shall see that I will not impose upon you or offer any thing that is unkind to you and if you desire it you shall know every thing before hand that you may suit your self to the Occasion and be either costly or sparing as you see fit  I told her  she seem'd to be so perfectly sensible of my Condition that I had nothing to ask of her but this that as I had told her that I had Money sufficient but not a great Quantity she would order it so that I might be at as little superfluous Charge as possible  SHE replyed  that she would bring in an Account of the Expences of it in two or three Shapes and like a  Bill of Fare  I should chuse as I pleas'd and I desir'd her to do so  THE next Day she brought it and the Copy of her three Bills was as Follow  For Three Months Lodging in her House including my Dyet at  s  a Week  l  s  d        For a Nurse for the Month and Use of Childbed Linnen        For a Minister to Christen the Child and to the Godfathers and Clark        For a Supper at the Christening if I had five Friends at it        For her Fees as a Midwife and the taking off the Trouble of the Parish        To her MaidServant attending                 THIS was the first Bill the second was in the same Terms  For Three Months Lodging and Diet  c  at  s per  Week        For a Nurse for the Month and the Use of Linnen and Lace        For the Minister to Christen the Child  c  as above        For a Supper and for Sweetmeats        For her Fees as above        For a ServantMaid                 THIS was the second rate Bill the third  she said  was for a degree Higher and when the Father or Friends appeared  For Three Months Lodging and Diet having two Rooms and a Garret for a Servant        For a Nurse for the Month and the finest Suit of Childbed Linnen        For the Minister to Christen the Child  c        For a Supper the Gentlemen to send in the Wine        For my Fees  c        The Maid besides their own Maid only                 I LOOK'D upon all the three Bills and smil'd  and told her  I did not see but that she was very reasonable in her Demands all things Consider'd and for that I did not doubt but her Accommodations were good  SHE told me  I should be Judge of that when I saw them  I told her  I was sorry to tell her that I fear'd I must be her lowest rated Customer and  perhaps Madam  said I  you will make me the less Welcome upon that Account  No not at all  said she  for where I have One of the third Sort I have Two of the Second and Four to One of the First and I get as much by them in Proportion as by any but if you doubt my Care of you I will allow any Friend you have to overlook and see if you are well waited on or no  THEN she explain'd the particulars of her Bill in the first Place Madam  said she  I would have you Observe that here is three Months Keeping you are but  s  a Week I undertake to say you will not complain of my Table I suppose  says she  you do not live Cheaper where you are now no indeed  said I  nor so Cheap for I give six Shillings  per  Week for my Chamber and find my own Diet as well as I can which costs me a great deal more  THEN Madam  says she  If the Child should not live or should be dead Born as you know sometime happens then there is the Minister's Article saved and if you have no Friends to come to you you may save the Expence of a Supper so that take those Articles out Madam  says she  your LyingIn will not cost you above  l    s  in all more than your ordinary Charge of Living  THIS was the most reasonable thing that I ever heard of so I smil'd and told her I would come and be her Customer but  I told her also  that as I had two Months and more to go I might perhaps be oblig'd to stay longer with her than three Months and desir'd to know if she would not be oblig'd to remove me before it was proper no  she said  her House was large and besides she never put any Body to remove that had lain Inn till they were willing to go and if she had more Ladies offer'd she was not so ill belov'd among her Neighbours but she could provide Accommodation for Twenty if there was occasion  I FOUND she was an eminent Lady in her way and  in short  I agreed to put my self into her Hands and promis'd her She then talk'd of other things look'd about into my Accommodations where was found fault with my wanting Attendance and Conveniencies and that I should not be us'd so at her House  I told her  I was shy of speaking for the Woman of the House look'd stranger or at least I thought so since I had been Ill because I was with Child and I was afraid she would put some Affront or other upon me supposing that I had been able to give but a slight Account of myself  O DEAR  said she  her Ladyship is no stranger to these things she has try'd to entertain Ladies in your Condition several times but could not secure the Parish and besides she is not such a nice Lady as you take her to be however since you are agoing you shall not meddle with her but I'll see you are a little better look'd after while you are here than I think you are and it shall not cost you the more neither  I DID not understand her at all however I thank'd her and so we parted the next Morning she sent me a Chicken roasted and hot and a pint Bottle of Sherry and order'd the Maid to tell me that she was to wait on me every Day as long as I stay'd there  THIS was surprisingly good and kind and I accepted it very willingly At Night she sent to me again to know if I wanted any thing and how I did and to order the Maid to come to her in the morning for my Dinner the Maid had order to make me some Chocolat in the Morning before she came away and did so and at Noon she brought me the Sweetbread of a Breast of Veal whole and a Dish of Soup for my Dinner and after this manner she Nurs'd me up at a distance so that I was mightily well pleas'd and quickly well for indeed my Dejections before were the principal Part of my Illness  I expected as usually is the Case among such People that the Servant she sent me would have been some impudent brazen Wench of  DruryLane  Breeding and I was very uneasie at having her with me upon that Account so I would not let her lie in that House the first Night by any means but had my Eyes about me as narrowly as if she had been a publick Thief  MY Gentlewoman guess'd presently what was the matter and sent her back with a short Note that I might depend upon the honesty of her Maid that she would be answerable for her upon all Accounts and that she took no Servants into her House without very good Security for their Fidelity I was then perfectly easie and indeed the Maids behaviour spoke for its self for a modester quieter soberer Girl never came into any bodies Family and I found her so afterwards  AS soon as I was well enough to go Abroad I went with the Maid to see the House and to see the Apartment I was to have and every thing was so handsome and so clean and well that in short I had nothing to say but was wonderfully pleas'd and satisfy'd with what I had met with which considering the melancholy Circumstances I was in was far beyond what I look'd for  IT might be expected that I should give some Account of the Nature of the wicked Practice of this Woman in whose Hands I was now fallen but it would be but too much Encouragement to the Vice to let the World see what easie Measures were here taken to rid the Women's unwelcome Burthen of a Child clandestinely gotten This grave Matron had several sorts of Practise and this was one particular that if a Child was born tho' not in her House for she had the occasion to be call'd to many private Labours she had People at Hand who for a Peice of Money would take the Child off their Hands and off from the Hands of the Parish too and those Children as she said were honestly provided for and taken care of What should become of them all Considering so many as by her Account she was concern'd with I cannot conceive  I HAD many times Discourses upon that Subject with her but she was full of this Argument that she sav'd the Life of many an innocent Lamb as she call'd them which would otherwise perhaps have been Murder'd and of many a Woman who made Desperate by the Misfortune would otherwise be tempted to Destroy their Children and bring themselves to the Gallows I granted her that this was true and a very commendable thing provided the poor Children fell into good Hands afterwards and were not abus'd starv'd and neglected by the Nurses that bred them up she answer'd that she always took care of that and had no Nurses in her Business but what were very good honest People and such as might be depended upon  I COU'D say nothing to the contrary and so was oblig'd to say Madam I do not question you do your part honestly but what those People do afterwards is the main Question and she stop'd my Mouth again with saying that she took the utmost Care about it  THE only thing I found in all her Conversation on these Subjects that gave me any distaste was that one time in Discoursing about my being so far gone with Child and the time I expected to come she said something that look'd as if she could help me off with my Burthen sooner if I was willing or in  English  that she could give me something to make me Miscarry if I had a desire to put an end to my Troubles that way but I soon let her see that I abhorr'd the Thoughts of it and to do her Justice she put it off so cleverly that I cou'd not say she really intended it or whether she only mentioned the practise as a horrible thing for she couch'd her words so well  and took my meaning so quickly that she gave her Negative before I could explain my self  TO bring this part into as narrow a Compass as possible I quitted my Lodging at St  Jones  's and went to my new Governess for so they call'd her in the House and there I was indeed treated with so much Courtesy so carefully look'd to so handsomely provided and every thing so well that I was surpris'd at it and cou'd not at first see what Advantage my Governess made of it but I found afterwards that she profess'd to make no Profit of the Lodgers Diet nor indeed cou'd she get much by it but that her Profit lay in the other Articles of her Management and she made enough that way I assure you for 'tis scarce credible what Practice she had as well Abroad as at Home and yet all upon the private Account or in plain  English  the whoring Account  WHILE I was in her House which was near Four Months she had no less than Twelve Ladies of Pleasure brought to Bed within Doors and I think she had Two and Thirty or thereabouts under her Conduct without Doors whereof one as nice as she was with me was Lodg'd with my old Landlady at St  Jones  's  THIS was a strange Testimony of the growing Vice of the Age and such a one that as bad as I had been my self it shock'd my very Senses I began to nanceate the place I was in and above all the wicked Practice and yet I must say that I never saw or do I believe there was to be seen the least indecency in the House the whole time I was there  NOT a Man was ever seen to come up Stairs except to visit the LyingInn Ladies within their Month nor then without the old Lady with them  who made it a piece of the Honour of her Management that no Man should touch a Woman no not his own Wife within the Month nor would she permit any Man to lye in the House upon any pretence whatever no not tho' she was sure it was with his own Wife and her general saying for it was that she car'd not how many Children was born in her House but she would have none got there if she could help it  IT might perhaps be carried farther than was needful but it was an Error of the right Hand if it was an Error for by this she kept up the Reputation such as it was of her Business and obtain'd this Character that tho' she did take Care of the Women when they were Debauch'd yet she was not Instrumental to their being Debauch'd at all and yet it was a wicked Trade she drove too  WHILE I was here and before I was brought to Bed I receiv'd a Letter from my Trustee at the Bank full of kind obliging things and earnestly pressing me to return to  London  It was near a Fortnight old when it came to me because it had been first sent into  Lancashire  and then return'd to me he concludes with telling me that he had obtain'd a Decree I think he call'd it against his Wife and that he would be ready to make good his Engagement to me if I would accept of him adding a great many Protestations of Kindness and Affection such as he would have been far from offering if he had known the Circumstances I had been in and which as it was I had been very far from deserving  I RETURNED an Answer to this Letter and dated it at  Leverpool  but sent it by a Messenger alledging that it came in Cover to a Friend in  Town I gave him Joy of his Deliverance but rais'd some Scruples at the Lawfulness of his Marrying again and told him I suppos'd he would consider very seriously upon that Point before he resolv'd on it the Consequence being two great for a Man of his Judgment to venture rashly upon a thing of that Nature so concluded wishing him very well in whatever he resolv'd without letting him into any thing of my own Mind or giving any Answer to his Proposal of my coming to  London  to him but mention'd at a distance my intention to return the latter end of the Year this being dated in  April    I WAS brought to Bed about the middle of  May  and had another brave Boy and my self in as good Condition as usual on such Occasions My Governess did her part as a Midwife with the greatest Art and Dexterity imaginable and far beyond all that ever I had had any Experience of before  HER Care of me in my Travail and after in my LyingInn was such that if she had been my own Mother it cou'd not have been better let none be encourag'd in their loose Practises from this Dexterous Lady's Management for she is gone to her place and I dare say has left nothing behind her that can or will come up to it  I THINK I had been brought to Bed about twenty two Days when I receiv'd another Letter from my Friend at the Bank with the surprizing News that he had obtain'd a final Sentence of Divorce against his Wife and had serv'd her with it on such a Day and that he had such an Answer to give to all my Scruples about his Marrying again as I could not expect and as he had no Desire of for that his Wife who had been under  some Remorse before for her usage of him as soon as she had the account that he had gain'd his Point had very unhappily destroy'd her self that same Evening  HE express'd himself very handsomly as to his being concern'd at her Disaster but clear'd himself of having any hand in it and that he had only done himself Justice in a Case in which he was notoriously Injur'd and Abus'd However he said that he was extremely afflicted at it and had no view of any Satisfaction left in this World but only in the hope that I wou'd come and relieve him by my Company and then he press'd me violently indeed to give him some hopes that I would at least come up to Town and let him see me when he would farther enter into Discourse about it  I WAS exceedingly surpriz'd at the News and began now seriously to reflect on my present Circumstances and the inexpressible Misfortune it was to me to have a Child upon my Hands and what to do in it I knew not at last I open'd my Case at a distance to my Governess I appear'd melancholy and uneasie for several Days and she lay at me continually to know what troubl'd me I could not for my life tell her that I had an offer of Marriage after I had so often told her that I had a Husband so that I really knew not what to say to her I own'd I had something which very much troubl'd me but at the same time told her I cou'd not speak of it to any one alive  SHE continued importuning me several Days but it was impossible  I told her  for me to commit the Secret to any Body this instead of being an Answer to her encreas'd her Importunities she urg'd her having been trusted with the  greatest Secrets of this Nature that it was her business to Conceal every thing and that to Discover things of that Nature would be her Ruin she ask'd me if ever I had found her Tatling to her of other Peoples Affairs and how could I suspect her  she told me  to unfold my self to her was telling it to no Body that she was silent as Death that it must be a very strange Case indeed that she could not help me out of but to conceal it was to deprive myself of all possible Help or means of Help and to deprive her of the Opportunity of Serving me  In short  she had such a bewitching Eloquence and so great a power of Perswasion that there was no concealing any thing from her  SO I resolv'd to unbosome myself to her I told her the History of my  Lancashire  Marriage and how both of us had been Disappointed how we came together and how we parted How he absolutely Discharg'd me as far as lay in him and gave me free Liberty to Marry again protesting that if he knew it he would never Claim me or Disturb or Expose me that I thought I was free but was dreadfully afraid to venture for fear of the Consequences that might follow in case of a Discovery  THEN I told her what a good Offer I had show'd her my Friends two last Letters inviting me to come to  London  and let her see with what Affection and Earnestness they were written but blotted out the Name and also the Story about the Dissaster of his Wife only that she was dead  SHE fell a Laughing at my scruples about marrying and told me the other was no Marriage but a Cheat on both Sides and that as we were parted by mutual Consent the nature of the Contract was destroy'd and the Obligation was  mutually discharg'd She had Arguments for this at the tip of her Tongue and  in short  reason'd me out of my Reason not but that it was too by the help of my own Inclination  BUT  then came the great and main Difficulty and that was the Child this she told me in so many Words must be remov'd and that so as that it should never be possible for any one to discover it I knew there was no Marrying without entirely concealing that I had had a Child for he would soon have discover'd by the Age of it that it was born nay and gotten too since my Parly with him and that would have destroy'd all the Affair  BUT it touch'd my Heart so forcibly to think of Parting entirely with the Child and for ought I knew of having it murther'd or starv'd by Neglect and Illusuage which was much the same that I could not think of it without Horror I wish all those Women who consent to the disposing their Children out of the way  as it is call'd  for Decency sake would consider that 'tis only a contriv'd Method for Murther that is to say a killing their Children with safety  IT is manifest to all that understand any thing of Children that we are born into the World helpless and uncapable either to supply our own Wants or so much as make them known and that without help we must Perish and this help requires not only an assisting Hand whether of the Mother or some Body else but there are two Things necessary in that assisting Hand that is Care and Skill without both which half the Children that are born would die nay tho' they were not to be deny'd Food and one half more  of those that remain'd would be Cripples or Fools loose their Limbs and perhaps their Sense I Question not but that these are partly the Reasons why Affection was plac'd by Nature in the Hearts of Mothers to their Children without which they would never be able to give themselves up as 'tis necessary they should to the Care and waking Pains needful to the Support of their Children  SINCE this Care is needful to the Life of Children to neglect them is to Murther them again to give them up to be Manag'd by those People who have none of that needful Affection plac'd by Nature in them is to Neglect them in the highest Degree nay in some it goes farther and is a Neglect in order to their being Lost so that 'tis even an intentional Murther whether the Child lives or dies  ALL those things represented themselves to my View and that in the blackest and most frightful Form and as I was very free with my Governness who I had now learn'd to call Mother I represented to her all the dark Thoughts which I had upon me about it and told her what distress I was in She seem'd graver by much at this Part than at the other but as she was harden'd in these things beyond all possibility of being touch'd with the Religious part and the Scruples about the Murther so she was equally impenetrable in that Part which related to Affection She ask'd me if she had not been Careful and Tender of me in my LyingInn as if I had been her own Child I told her I own'd she had Well my Dear  says she  and when you are gone what are you to me and what would it be to me if you were to be Hang'd Do you think there are not Women who as it is their Trade and they get their Bread by it value  themselves upon their being as careful of Children as their own Mothers can be and understand it rather better Yes yes Child  says she  fear it not How were we Nurs'd ourselves Are you sure you was Nurs'd up by your own Mother and yet you look fat and fair Child says the old Beldam and with that she stroak'd me over the Face never be concern'd Child  says she  going on in her drolling way I have no Murtherers about me▪ I employ the best and the honestest Nurses that can be had and have as few Children miscarry under their Hands as there would if they were all Nurs'd by Mothers we want neither Care nor Skill  SHE touch'd me to the Quick when she ask'd if I was sure that I was Nurs'd by my own Mother on the contrary I was sure I was not and I trembled and look'd pale at the very Expression sure said I to myself this Creature cannot be a Witch or have any Conversation with a Spirit that can inform her what was done with me before I was able to know it myself and I look'd at her as if I had been frighted but reflecting that it cou'd not be possible for her to know any thing about me that Disorder went off and I began to be easie but it was not presently  SHE perceiv'd the Disorder I was in but did not know the meaning of it so she run on in her wild Talk upon the weakness of my supposing that Children were murther'd because they were not all Nurs'd by the Mother and to perswade me that the Children she dispos'd of were as well us'd as if the Mothers had the Nursing of them themselves  IT may be true Mother  says I  for ought I know but my Doubts are very strongly grounded  indeed come then  says she  lets hear some of them Why first  says I  you give a Piece of Money to these People to take the Child off the Parents Hands and to take Care of it as long as it lives now we know Mother  said I  that those are poor People and their Gain consists in being quit of the Charge as soon as they can how can I doubt but that as it is best for them to have the Child die they are not over Solicitous about its Life  THIS is all Vapours and Fancy  says the old Woman  I tell you their Credit depends upon the Child's Life and they are as careful as any Mother of you all  O Mother  says I  if I was but sure my little Baby would be carefully look'd to and have Justice done it I should be happy indeed but it is impossible I can be satisfy'd in that Point unless I saw it and to see it would be Ruin and Destruction to me as now my Case stands so what to do I know not  A FINE Story  says the Governess  you would see the Child and you would not see the Child you would be Conceal'd and Discover'd both together these are things impossible my Dear so you must e'n do as other conscientious Mothers have done before you and be contented with things as they must be tho' they are not as you wish them to be  I understood what she meant by conscientious Mothers she would have said conscientious Whores but she was not willing to disoblige me for really in this Case I was not a Whore because legally Married the force of my former Marriage excepted  HOWEVER let me be what I would I was not come up to that pitch of Hardness common to the  Profession I mean to be unnatural and regardless of the Safety of my Child and I preserv'd this honest Affection so long that I was upon the Point of giving up my Friend at the  Bank  who lay so hard at me to come to him and Marry him that  in short  there was hardly any room to deny him  AT last my old Governness came to me with her usual Assurance Come my Dear  says she  I have found out a way how you shall be at a certainty that your Child shall be used well and yet the People that take Care of it shall never know you or who the Mother of the Child is  O Mother  says she  If you can do so you will engage me to you for ever Well  says she  are you willing to be at some small Annual Expence more than what we usually give to the People we Contract with Ay  says I  with all my Heart provided I may be conceal'd as to that says  the Governness  you shall be Secure for the Nurse shall never so much as dare to Enquire about you and you shall once or twice a Year go with me and see your Child and see how 'tis used and be satisfy'd that it is in good Hands no Body knowing who you are  WHY  said I  do you think Mother that when I come to see my Child I shall be able to conceal my being the Mother of it do you think that possible  WELL well  says my Governess  if you discocover it the Nurse shall be never the wiser for she shall be forbid to ask any Questions about you or to take any Notice if she offers it she shall lose the Money which you are to be suppos'd to give her and the Child be taken from her too  I WAS very well pleas'd with this so the next Week a Country Woman was brought from  Hertford  or thereabouts who was to take the Child off our Hands entirely for  l  in Money but if I would allow  l  a Year more to her she would be obliged to bring the Child to my Governesses House as often as we desired or we should come down and look at it and see how well she us'd it  THE Woman was a very wholesome look'd likely Woman a Cottager's Wife but she had very good Cloaths and Linnen and every thing well about her and with a heavy Heart and many a Tear I let her have my Child I had been down at  Hertford  and look'd at her and at her Dwelling which I lik'd well enough and I promis'd her great Things if she would be kind to the Child so she knew at first word that I was the Child's Mother but she seem'd to be so much out of the way and to have no room to enquire after me that I thought I was safe enough so in short I consented to let her have the Child and I gave her Ten Pound that is to say I gave it to my Governess who gave it the poor Woman before my Face she agreeing never to return the Child back to me or to claim any thing more for its keeping or bringing up only that I promised if she took a great deal of Care of it I would give her something more as often as I came to see it so that I was not bound to pay the Five Pound only that I promised my Governess I would do it And thus my great Care was over after a manner which tho' it did not at all satisfie my Mind yet was the most convenient for me as my Affairs then stood of any that cou'd be thought of at that time  I THEN began to write to my Friend at the Bank in a more kindly Style and particularly about the beginning of  July  I sent him a Letter that I purpos'd to be in Town sometime in  August  he return'd me an Answer in the most Passionate Terms imaginable and desir'd me to let him have timely Notice and he would come and meet me two Days Journey This puzzl'd me scurvily and I did not know what Answer to make to it once I was resolv'd to take the Stage Coach to  Westchester  on purpose only to have the satisfaction of coming back that he might see me really come in the same Coach for I had a jealous thought though I had no Ground for it at all least he should think I was not really in the Country and it was no illgrounded Thought as you shall hear presently  I endeavour'd to Reason my self out of it but it was in vain the Impression lay so strong on my Mind that it was not to be resisted at last it came as an Addition to my new Design of going in the Country that it would be an excellent Blind to my old Governess and would cover entirely all my other Affairs for she did not know in the least whether my new Lover liv'd in  London  or in  Lancashire  and when I told her my Resolution she was fully perswaded it was in  Lancashire    HAVING taken my Measures for this Journey I let her know it and sent the Maid that tended me from the beginning to take a Place for me in the Coach she would have had me let the Maid have waited on me down to the last Stage and come up again in the Waggon but I convinc'd her it wou'd not be convenient when I went away she told me she would enter into no Measures for  Correspondence for she saw evidently that my Affection to my Child would cause me to write to her and to visit her too when I came to Town again I assur'd her it would and so took my leave well satisfied to have been freed from such a House however good my Accommodations there had been as I have related above  I took the Place in the Coach not to its full Extent but to a place call'd  Stone  in  Cheshire  I think it is where I not only had no manner of Business but not so much as the least Acquaintance with any Person in the Town or near it But I knew that with Money in the Pocket one is at home any where so I Lodg'd there two or three Days till watching my opportunity I found room in another Stage Coach and took Passage back again for  London  sending a Letter to my Gentleman that I should be such a certain Day at  StonyStratford  where the Coachman told me he was to Lodge  IT happen'd to be a Chance Coach that I had taken up which having been hired on purpose to carry some Gentlemen to  WestChester  who were going for  Ireland  was now returning and did not tye it self up to exact Times or Places as the Stages did so that having been oblig'd to lye still a  Sunday  he had time to get himself ready to come out which otherwise he cou'd not have done  HOWEVER his warning was so short that he could not reach to  StonyStratford  time enough to be with me at Night but he met me at a Place call'd  Brickill  the next Morning as we were just coming into the Town  I CONFESS I was very glad to see him for I had thought my self a little disappointed over Night seeing I had gone so far to contrive my coming on purpose He pleas'd me doubly too by  the Figure he came in for he brought a very handsome Gentleman's Coach and four Horses with a Servant to attend him  HE took me out of the Stage Coach immediately which stop'd at an Inn in  Brickill  and putting in to the same Inn he set up his own Coach and bespoke his Dinner I ask'd him what he meant by that for I was for going forward with the Journey he said no I had need of a little Rest upon the Road and that was a very good sort of a House tho' it was but a little Town so we would go no farther that Night whatever came of it  I DID not press him much for since he had come so far to meet me and put himself to so much Expence it was but reasonable I should oblige him a little too so I was easy as to that Point  AFTER Dinner we walk'd to see the Town to see the Church and to view the Fields and the Country as is usual for Strangers to do and our Landlord was our Guide in going to see the Church I observ'd my Gentleman enquir'd pretty much about the Parson and I took the hint immediately that he certainly would propose to be married and tho' it was a sudden thought it follow'd presently that in short I would not refuse him for to be plain with my Circumstances I was in no condition now to say NO I had no reason now to run any more such hazards  BUT while these Thoughts run round in my Head which was the work but of a few Moments I observ'd my Landlord took him aside and whisper'd to him tho' not very softly neither for so much I overheard  Sir if you shall have occasion  the rest I cou'd not hear but it  seems it was to this purpose  Sir if you shall have occasion for a Minister I have a Friend a little way off that will serve you and be as private as you please  my Gentleman answer'd loud enough for me to hear  very well I believe I shall    I WAS no sooner come back to the Inn but he fell upon me with irresistable Words that since he had had the good Fortune to meet me and every thing concurr'd it wou'd be hastening his Felicity if I would put an end to the matter just there what do you mean  says I  colouring a little what in an Inn and upon the Road Bless us all  said I  as if I had been surpriz'd how can you talk so O I can talk so very well  says he  I came a purpose to talk so and I'll show you that I did and with that he pulls out a great Bundle of Papers you fright me  said I  what are all these don't be frighted my Dear  said he  and kiss'd me  this was the first time that he had been so free to call me my Dear  then he repeated it don't be frighted you shall see what it is all then he laid them all abroad there was first the Deed or Sentence of Divorce from his Wife and the full Evidence of her playing the Whore then there was the Certificates of the Minister and Churchwardens of the Parish where she liv'd proving that she was buried and intimating the manner of her Death the Copy of the Coroner's Warrant for a Jury to sit upon her and the Verdict of the Jury who brought it in  Non Compos Mentis  all this was indeed to the purpose and to give me Satisfaction tho' by the way I was not so scrupulous had he known all but that I might have taken him without it However I look'd them all over as well as I cou'd and told him that this was all very clear indeed but that he need not have given himself the Trouble to have brought them out with him for it  was time enough Well  he said  it might be time enough for me but no time but the present time was time enough for him  THERE were other Papers roll'd up and I ask'd him what they were Why Ay  says he  that's the Question I wanted to have you ask me so he unrolls them and takes out a little Chagreen Case and gives me out of it a very fine Diamond Ring I could not refuse it if I had a mind to do so for he put it upon my Finger so I made him a Curtsy and accepted it then he takes out another Ring and this  says he  is for another Occasion so he puts that in his Pocket Well but let me see it tho'  says I  and smil'd I guess what it is I think you are Mad I should have been Mad if I had done less  says he  and still he did not show it me and I had a great mind to see it so I says well but let me see it hold  says he  first look here then he took up the Roll again and read it and behold it was a License for us to be married Why  says I  are you Distracted why you were fully satisfy'd that I would comply and yield at first Word or resolv'd to take no denial the last is certainly the Case  said he  but you may be mistaken  said I  no no  says he  how can you think so I must not be denied I can't be denied and with that he fell to Kissing me so violently I could not get rid of him  THERE was a Bed in the Room and we were walking too and again eager in the Discourse at last he takes me by surprize in his Arms and threw me on the Bed and himself with me and holding me fast in his Arms but without the least offer of any Undecency Courted me to Consent with such repeated Entreaties and Arguments protesting his Affection and vowing he would not let me go till I had  promised him that at last I said why you resolve not to be deny'd indeed I think No no  says he  I must not be denyed I won't be deny'd I can't be deny'd Well well  said I  and giving him a slight Kiss then you shan't be deny'd  said I  let me get up  HE was so Transported with my Consent and the kind manner of it that I began to think Once he took it for a Marriage and would not stay for the Form but I wrong'd him for he gave over Kissing me took me by the Hand pull'd me up again and then giving me two or three Kisses again thank'd me for my kind yielding to him and was so overcome with the Satisfaction and Joy of it that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes  I TURN'D from him for it fill'd my Eyes with Tears too and I ask'd him leave to retire a little to my Chamber If ever I had a Grain of true Repentance for a vitious and abominable Life for Years past it was then O what a felicity is it to Mankind  said I  to myself that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another How happy had it been for me if I had been Wife to a Man of so much honesty and so much Affection from the Beginning  THEN it occour'd to me what an abominable Creature am I and how is this innocent Gentleman going to be abus'd by me How little does he think that having Divorc'd a Whore he is throwing himself into the Arms of another that he is going to Marry one that has lain with two Brothers and has had three Children by her own Brother one that was born in  Newgate  whose Mother was a Whore and is now a transported Thief one that has lain with thirteen Men and has had a Child since he saw me poor Gentleman  said I  What is he going to do After this reproaching my self was over it followed thus Well if I must be his Wife if it please God to give me Grace I'll be a true Wife to him and love him suitably to the strange Excess of his Passion for me I will make him amends if possible by what he shall see for the Cheats and Abuses I put upon him which he does not see  HE was impatient for my coming out of my Chamber but finding me long he went down Stairs and talk'd with my Landlord about the Parson  MY Landlord an Officious tho' wellmeaning Fellow had sent away for the Neighbouring Clergy Man and when my Gentleman began to speak of it to him and talk of sending for him Sir says he to him my Friend is in the House so without any more words he brought them together When he came to the Minister he ask'd him if he would venture to marry a couple of Strangers that were both willing The Parson said that Mr had said something to him of it that he hop'd it was no Clandestine Business that he seem'd to be a grave Gentleman and he suppos'd Madam was not a Girl so that the consent of Friends should be wanted to put you out of doubt of that says my Gentleman read this Paper and out he pulls the License I am satisfied says the Minister where is the Lady you shall see her presently says my Gentleman  WHEN he had said thus he comes up Stairs and I was by that time come out of my Room so he tells me the Minister was below and that he had talk with him and that upon showing him the  he was free to marry us with all his  Heart but he asks to see you so he ask'd if I would let him come up  'Tis time enough  said I  in the Morning is it not Why  said he  my Dear he seem'd to scruple whether it was not some young Girl stolen from her Parents and I assur'd him we were both of Age to command our own Consent and that made him ask to see you well  said I  do as you please so up they brings the Parson and a merry good sort of Gentleman he was he had been told it seems that we had met there by accident that I came in the  Chester  Coach and my Gentleman in his own Coach to meet me that we were to have met last Night at  StonyStratford  but that he could not reach so far Well Sir  says the Parson  every ill turn has some good in it the Disappointment Sir  says he to my Gentleman  was yours and the good Turn is mine for if you had met at  StonyStratford  I had not had the Honour to Marry you LANDLORD  have you a CommonPrayer Book    I started as if I had been frighted Lord Sir  says I  what do you mean what to marry in an Inn and at Night too Madam  says the Minister  if you will have it be in the Church you shall but I assure you your Marriage will be as firm here as in the Church we are not tyed by the Canons to Marry no where but in the Church and if you will have it in the Church it will be as publick as a Country Fair and as for the time of Day it does not at all weigh in this Case our Princes are married in their Chambers and at Eight or Ten a Clock at Night  I WAS a great while before I could be perswaded and pretended not to be willing at all to be married but in the Church but it was all Grimace  so I seem'd at last to be prevail'd on and my Landlord and his Wife and Daughter were call'd up My Landlord was Father and Clark and all together and we were married and very Merry we were tho' I confess the selfreproaches which I had upon me before lay close to me and extorted every now and then a deep sigh from me which my Bridegroom took notice of and endeavour'd to encourage me thinking poor Man that I had some little hesitations at the Step I had taken so hastily  WE enjoy'd our selves that Evening compleatly and yet all was kept so private in the Inn that not a Servant in the House knew of it for my Landlady and her Daughter waited on me and would not let any of the Maids come up Stairs except while we were at Supper My Landlady's Daughter I call'd my Bridemaid and sending for a Shopkeeper the next Morning I gave the young Woman a good Suit of Knots as good as the Town would afford and finding it was a Lacemaking Town I gave her Mother a piece of Bonelace for a Head  ONE Reason that my Landlord was so close was that he was unwilling the Minister of the Parish should hear of it but for all that somebody heard of it so as that we had the Bells set a Ringing the next Morning early and the Musick such as the Town would afford under our Window but my Landlord brazen'd it out that we were marry'd before we came thither only that being his former Guess we would have our Wedding Supper at his House  WE cou'd not find in our Hearts to stir the next Day for in short having been disturb'd by the Bells in the Morning and having perhaps not  slept over much Before we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in Bed till almost Twelve a Clock  I BEG'D my Landlady that we might not have any more Musick in the Town nor Ringing of Bells and she manag'd it so well that we were very quiet But an odd Passage interrupted all my Mirth for a good while the great Room of the House look'd into the Street and my new Spouse being below Stairs I had walk'd to the end of the Room and it being a pleasant warm Day I had opened the Window and was standing at it for some Air when I saw three Gentlemen come by on Horseback and go into an Inn just against us  IT was not to be conceal'd nor was it so doubtful as to leave me any room to question it but the second of the three was my  Lancashire  Husband I was frighted to Death I never was in such a Consternation in my Life I thought I should have sunk into the Ground my Blood run Chill in my Veins and I trembl'd as if I had been in a cold Fit of an Ague I say there was no room to question the Truth of it I knew his Cloaths I knew his Horse and I knew his Face  THE first sensible Reflection I made was that my Husband was not by to see my Disorder and that I was very glad of The Gentlemen had not been long in the House but they came to the Window of their Room as is usual but my Window was shut you may be sure However I cou'd not keep from peeping at them and there I saw him again heard him call out to one of the Servants of the House for something he wanted and receiv'd all the terryfying Confirmations of its being the same Person that were possible to be had  MY next concern was to know if possible what was his Business there but that was impossible sometimes my Imagination form'd an Idea of one frightful thing sometimes of another sometimes I thought he had discover'd me and was come to upbraid me with Ingratitude and Breach of Honour and every Moment I fancied he was coming up the Stairs to Insult me and innumerable fancies came into my Head of what was never in his Head nor ever could be unless the Devil had reveal'd it to him  I REMAIN'D in this fright near two Hours and scarce ever kept my Eye from the Window or Door of the Inn where they were At last hearing a great clutter in the Passage of their Inn I run to the Window and to my great Satisfaction see them all three go out again and Travel on Westward had they gone towards  London  I should have been still in a fright least I should meet him on the Road again and that he should know me but he went the contrary way and so I was eas'd of that Disorder  WE resolv'd to be going the next Day but about six a Clock at Night we were alarm'd with a great uproar in the Street and People riding as if they had been out of their Wits and what was it but a Hue and Cry after three Highway Men that had rob'd two Coaches and some other Travellers near  Dunstable  Hill and notice had it seems been given that they had been seen at  Brickill  at such a House meaning the House where those Gentlemen had been  THE House was immediately beset and search'd but there were witnesses enough that the Gentlemen had been gone above three Hours the Crowd having gathered about we had the News presently  I and was heartily concern'd now another way I presently told the People of the House that I durst to say those were not the Persons for that I knew one of the Gentlemen to be a very honest Person and of a good Estate in  Lancashire    THE Constable who came with the Hue and Cry was immediately inform'd of this and came over to me to be satisfy'd from my own Mouth and I assur'd him that I saw the three Gentlemen as I was at the Window that I saw them afterwards at the Windows of the Room they din'd in that I saw them afterwards take Horse and I could assure him I knew one of them to be such a Man that he was a Gentleman of a very good Estate and an undoubted Character in  Lancashire  from whence I was just now upon my Journey  THE assurance with which I deliver'd this gave the Mob Gentry a Check and gave the Constable such Satisfaction that he immediately sounded a Retreat told his People these were not the Men but that he had an account they were very honest Gentlemen and so they went all back again what the Truth of the matter was I knew not but certain it was that the Coaches were rob'd at  Dunstable  Hill and  l  in Money taken besides some of the LaceMerchants that always Travel that way had been visited too as to the three Gentlemen that remains to be explain'd hereafter  WELL this Allarm stop'd us another Day tho' my Spouse was for Travelling and told me that it was always safest Travelling after a Robbery for that the Thieves were sure to be gone far enough off when they had allarm'd the Country but I was afraid and uneasy and indeed principally  least my old Acquaintance should be upon the Road still and should chance to see me  I NEVER liv'd four pleasanter Days together in my life I was a meer Bride all this while and my new Spouse strove to make me entirely easie in every thing O could this State of Life have continued how had all my past Troubles been forgot and my future Sorrows been avoided but I had a past life of a most wretched kind to account for some of it in this World as well as in another  WE came away the fifth Day and my Landlord because he saw me uneasie mounted himself his Son and three honest Country Fellows with good FireArms and without telling us of it follow'd the Coach and would see us safe into  Dunstable  we could do no less than treat them very handsomely at  Dunstable  which Cost my Spouse about Ten or Twelve Shillings and something he gave the Men for their Time too but my Landlord would take nothing for himself  THIS was the most happy Contrivance for me that could have fallen out for had I come to  London  unmarried I must either have come to him for the first Night's Entertainment or have discovered to him that I had not one Acquaintance in the whole City of  London  that could receive a poor Bride for the first Night's Lodging with her Spouse But now being an old married Woman I made no scruple of going directly home with him and there I took Possession at once of a House well Furnish'd and a Husband in very good Circumstances so that I had a prospect of a very happy Life if I knew how to manage it and I had leisure to consider of the real Value of the Life I was likely to live how different it was to be from  the loose ungovern'd part I had acted before and how much happier a Life of Virtue and Sobriety is than that which we call a Life of Pleasure  O HAD this particular Scene of Life lasted or had I learnt from that time I enjoy'd it to have tasted the true sweetness of it and had I not fallen into that Poverty which is the sure Bane of Virtue how happy had I been not only here but perhaps for ever for while I liv'd thus I was really a Penitent for all my Life pass'd I look'd back on it with Abhorrence and might truly be said to hate my self for it I often reflected how my Lover at the  Bath  strook by the Hand of God repented and abandon'd me and refus'd to see me any more tho' he lov'd me to an extreme but I prompted by that worst of Devils Poverty return'd to the vile Practice and made the Advantage of what they call a handsome Face be the Relief to my Necessities and Beauty be a Pimp to Vice  NOW I seem'd landed in a safe Harbour after the Stormy Voyage of Life past was at an end and I began to be thankful for my Deliverance I sat many an Hour by my self and wept over the Remembrance of past Follies and the dreadful Extravagances of a wicked Life and sometimes I flatter'd my self that I had sincerely repented  BUT there are Temptations which it is not in the Power of Human Nature to resist and few know what would be their Case if driven to the same Exigences As Covetousness is the Root of all Evil so Poverty is I believe the worst of all Snares But I wave that Discourse till I come to the Experiment  I LIV'D with this Husband in the utmost Tranquility he was a Quiet Sensible Sober Man  Virtuous Modest Sincere and in his Business Diligent and Just His Business was in a narrow Compass and his Income sufficient to a plentiful way of Living in the ordinary way I do not say to keep an Equipage and make a Figure as the World calls it nor did I expect it or desire it for as I abhorr'd the Levity and Extravagance of my former Life so I chose now to live retir'd frugal and within our selves I kept no Company made no Visits minded my Family and oblig'd my Husband and this kind of Life became a Pleasure to me  WE liv'd in an uninterrupted course of Ease and Content for Five Years when a sudden Blow from an almost invisible Hand blasted all my Happiness and turn'd me out into the World in a Condition the reverse of all that had been before it  MY Husband having trusted one of his Fellow Clarks with a Sum of Money too much for our Fortunes to bear the Loss of the Clark fail'd and the Loss fell very heavy on my Husband yet it was not so great neither but that if he had had Spirit and Courage to have look'd his Misfortunes in the Face his Credit was so good that as I told him he would easily recover it for to sink under Trouble is to double the Weight and he that will Die in it shall Die in it  IT was in vain to speak comfortably to him the Wound had sunk too deep it was a Stab that touch'd the Vitals he grew Melancholy and Disconsolate and from thence Lethargick and died I foresaw the Blow and was extremely oppress'd in my Mind for I saw evidently that if he died I was undone  I HAD had two Children by him and no more for to tell the Truth it began to be time for me to leave bearing Children for I was now Eight and Forty and I suppose if he had liv'd I should have had no more  I WAS now left in a dismal and disconsolate Case indeed and in several things worse than ever First it was past the flourishing time with me when I might expect to be courted for a Mistress that agreeable part had declin'd some time and the Ruins only appear'd of what had been and that which was worse than all was this that I was the most dejected disconsolate Creature alive I that had encourag'd my Husband and endeavour'd to support his Spirits under his Trouble could not support my own I wanted that Spirit in Trouble which I told him was so necessary to him for bearing the burthen  BUT my Case was indeed Deplorable for I was left perfectly Friendless and Helpless and the Loss my Husband had sustain'd had reduc'd his Circumstances so low that tho' indeed I was not in Debt yet I could easily foresee that what was left would not support me long that while it wasted daily for Subsistence I had no way to encrease it one Shilling so that it would be soon all spent and then I saw nothing before me but the utmost Distress and this represented it self so lively to my Thoughts that it seem'd as if it was come before it was really very near also my very Apprehensions doubl'd the Misery for I fancied every Sixpence that I paid but for a Loaf of Bread was the last that I had in the World and that Tomorrow I was to fast and be starv'd to Death  IN this Distress I had no Assistant no Friend to comfort or advise me I sat and cried and tormented  my self Night and Day wringing my Hands and sometimes raving like a distracted Woman and indeed I have often wonder'd it had not affected my Reason for I had the Vapours to such a degree that my Understanding was sometimes quite lost in Fancies and Imaginations  I LIV'D Two Years in this dismal Condition wasting that little I had weeping continually over my dismal Circumstances and as it were only bleeding to Death without the least hope or prospect of help from God or Man and now I had cried so long and so often that Tears were as I might say exhausted and I began to be Desperate for I grew Poor apace  FOR a little Relief I had put off my House and took Lodgings and as I was reducing my Living so I sold off most of my Goods which put a little Money in my Pocket and I liv'd near a Year upon that spending very sparingly and eeking things out to the utmost but still when I look'd before me my very Heart would sink within me at the inevitable approach of Misery and Want O let none read this part without seriously reflecting on the Circumstances of a desolate State and how they would grapple with meer want of Friends and want of Bread it will certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only but of looking up to Heaven for support and of the wise Man's Prayer  Give me not Poverty least I Steal    LET 'em remember that a time of Distress is a time of dreadful Temptation and all the Strength to resist is taken away Poverty presses the Soul is made Desperate by Distress and what can be done It was one Evening when being brought  as I may say to the last Gasp I think I may truly say I was Distracted and Raving when prompted by I know not what Spirit and as it were doing I did not know what or why I dress'd me for I had still pretty good Cloaths and went out I am very sure I had no manner of Design in my Head when I went out I neither knew or considered where to go or on what Business but as the Devil carried me out and laid his Bait for me so he brought me to be sure to the place for I knew not whether I was going or what I did  WANDRING thus about I knew not whether I pass'd by an Apothecary's Shop in  Leadenhallstreet  where I saw lye on a Stool just before the Counter a little Bundle wrapt in a white Cloth beyond it stood a Maid Servant with her Back to it looking up towards the top of the Shop where the Apothecary's Apprentice as I suppose was standing up on the Counter with his Back also to the Door and a Candle in his Hand looking and reaching up to the upper Shelf for something he wanted so that both were engag'd mighty earnestly and no Body else in the Shop  THIS was the Bait and the Devil who I said laid the Snare as readily prompted me as if he had spoke for I remember and shall never forget it 'twas like a Voice spoken to me over my Shoulder take the Bundle be quick do it this Moment it was no sooner said but I step'd into the Shop and with my Back to the Wench as if I had stood up for a Cart that was going by I put my Hand behind me and took the Bundle and went off with it the Maid or the Fellow not perceiving me or any one else  IT is impossible to express the Horror of my Soul all the while I did it When I went away I had no Heart to run or scarce to mend my pace I cross'd the Street indeed and went down the first turning I came to and I think it was a Street that went thro' into  Fenchurchstreet  from thence I cross'd and turn'd thro' so many ways and turnings that I could never tell which way it was▪ nor where I went for I felt not the Ground I stept on and the farther I was out of Danger the faster I went till tyr'd and out of Breath I was forc'd to sit down on a little Bench at a Door and then I began to recover and found I was got into  Thamesstreet  near  Billinsgate  I rested me a little and went on my Blood was all in a Fire my Heart beat as if I was in a sudden Fright In short I was under such a Surprize that I still knew not whether I was a going or what to do  AFTER I had tyr'd my self thus with walking a long way about and so eagerly I began to consider and make home to my Lodging where I came about Nine a Clock at Night  WHAT the Bundle was made up for or on what Occasion laid where I found it I knew not but when I came to open it I found there was a Suit of Childbed Linnen in it very good and almost new the Lace very fine there was a Silver Porringer of a Pint a small Silver Mug and Six Spoons with some other Linnen a good Smock and Three Silk Handkerchiefs and in the Mug wrap'd up in a Paper Eighteen Shillings and Sixpence in Money  ALL the while I was opening these things I was under such dreadful Impressions of Fear and in such Terror of Mind tho' I was perfectly safe that I cannot express the manner of it I sat me  down and cried most vehemently Lord  said I  what am I now a Thief why I shall be taken next time and be carry'd to  Newgate  and be Try'd for my Life and with that I cry'd again a long time and I am sure as poor as I was if I had durst for fear I would certainly have carried the things back again but that went off after a while Well I went to Bed for that Night but slept little the Horror of the Fact was upon my Mind and I knew not what I said or did all Night and all the next Day Then I was impatient to hear some News of the Loss and would fain know how it was whether they were a Poor Bodies Goods or a Rich perhaps  said I  it may be some poor Widow like me that had pack'd up these Goods to go and sell them for a little Bread for herself and a poor Child and are now starving and breaking their Hearts for want of that little they would have fetch'd and this Thought tormented me worse than all the rest for three or four Days time  BUT my own Distresses silenc'd all these Reflections and the prospect of my own Starving which grew every Day more frightful to me harden'd my Heart by degrees it was then particularly heavy upon my Mind that I had been reform'd and had as I hop'd repented of all my pass'd wickednesses that I had liv'd a sober grave retir'd Life for several Years but now I should be driven by the dreadful Necessity of my Circumstances to the Gates of Destruction Soul and Body and two or three times I fell upon my Knees praying to God as well as I could for Deliverance but I cannot but say my Prayers had no hope in them I knew not what to do it was all Fear without and Dark within and I  reflected on my pass'd Life as not sincerely repented of that Heaven was now beginning to punish me on this side the Grave and would make me as miserable as I had been wicked  HAD I gone on here I had perhaps been a true Penitent but I had an evil Counsellor within and he was continually prompting me to relieve my self by the worst means so one Evening he tempted me again by the same wicked Impulse that had said  take that Bundle  to go out again and seek for what might happen  I WENT out now by Daylight and wandred about I knew not whether and in search of I knew not what when the Devil put a Snare in my way of a dreadful Nature indeed and such a one as I have never had before or since going thro'  Aldersgatestreet  there was a pretty little Child had been at a DancingSchool and was going home all alone and my Prompter like a true Devil set me upon this innocent Creature I talk'd to it and it prattl'd to me again and I took it by the Hand and led it a long till I came to a pav'd Alley that goes into  Bartholomew Close  and I led it in there the Child said that was not its way home I said yes my Dear it is I'll show you the way home the Child had a little Necklace on of Gold Beads and I had my Eye upon that and in the dark of the Alley I stoop'd pretending to mend the Child's Clog that was loose and took off her Necklace and the Child never felt it and so led the Child on again Here I say the Devil put me upon killing the Child in the dark Alley that it might not Cry but the very thought frighted me so that I was ready to drop down but I turn'd the Child about and bad it go back again for that was not its way home the Child said so  she would and I went thro' into  Bartholomew Close  and then turn'd round to another Passage that goes into  Longlane  so away into  CharterhouseYard  and out into  St John's street  then crossing into  Smithfield  went down  Chicklane  and into  Fieldlane  to  Holbournbridge  when mixing with the Crowd of People usually passing there it was not possible to have been found out and thus I enterpriz'd my second Sally into the World  THE thoughts of this Booty put out all the thoughts of the first and the Reflections I had made wore quickly off Poverty as I have said harden'd my Heart and my own Necessities made me regardless of any thing The last Affair left no great Concern upon me for as I did the poor Child no harm I only said to my self I had given the Parents a just Reproof for their Negligence in leaving the poor little Lamb to come home by it self and it would teach them to take more Care of it another time  THIS String of Beads was worth about Twelve or Fourteen Pounds I suppose it might have been formerly the Mother's for it was too big for the Child's wear but that perhaps the Vanity of the Mother to have her Child look Fine at the Dancing School had made her let the Child wear it and no doubt the Child had a Maid sent to take care of it but she like a careless Jade was taken up perhaps with some Fellow that had met her by the way and so the poor Baby wandred till it fell into my Hands  HOWEVER I did the Child no harm I did not so much as fright it for I had a great many tender Thoughts about me yet and did nothing  but what as I may say meer Necessity drove me to  I HAD a great many Adventures after this but I was young in the Business and did not know how to manage otherwise than as the Devil put things into my Head and indeed he was seldom backward to me One Adventure I had which was very lucky to me I was going thro'  Lombardstreet  in the dusk of the Evening just by the end of  Three King Court  when on a sudden comes a Fellow running by me as swift as Lightning and throws a Bundle that was in his Hand just behind me as I stood up against the corner of the House at the turning into the Alley just as he threw it in he said God bless you Mistress let it lie there a little and away he runs swift as the Wind After him comes two more and immediately a young Fellow without his Hat crying stop Thief and after him two or three more they pursued the two last Fellows so close that they were forced to drop what they had got and one of them was taken into the bargain the other got off free  I STOOD stock still all this while till they came back dragging the poor Fellow they had taken and luging the things they had found extremely well satisfied that they had recovered the Booty and taken the Thief and thus they pass'd by me for I look'd only like one who stood up while the Crowd was gone  ONCE or twice I ask'd what was the matter but the People neglected answering me and I was not very importunate but after the Crowd was wholly pass'd I took my opportunity to turn about and take up what was behind me and walk away This indeed I did with less Disturbance than I had done formerly for these things I did  not steal but they were stolen to my Hand I got safe to my Lodgings with this Cargo which was a Peice of fine black Lustring Silk and a Peice of Velvet the latter was but part of a Peice of about a Yards the former was a whole Peice of near Yards it seems it was a  Mercer's  Shop that they had rifled I say rifled because the Goods were so considerable that they had Lost for the Goods that they Recover'd were pretty many and I believe came to about six or seven several Peices of Silk How they came to get so many I could not tell but as I had only robb'd the Thief I made no scruple at taking these Goods and being very glad of them too  I HAD pretty good Luck thus far and I made several Adventures more tho' with but small Purchase yet with good Success but I went in daily dread that some mischief would befal me and that I should certainly come to be hang'd at last The impression this made on me was too strong to be slighted and it kept me from making attempts that for ought I know might have been very safely perform'd but one thing I cannot omit which was a Bait to me many a Day I walk'd frequently out into the Villages round the Town to see if nothing would fall in my Way there and going by a House near  Stepney  I saw on the Windowboard two Rings one a small Diamond Ring and the other a plain Gold Ring to be sure laid there by some thoughtless Lady that had more Money than Forecast perhaps only till she wash'd her Hands  I WALK'D several times by the Window to observe if I could see whether there was any Body in the Room or no and I could see no Body but still I was not sure it came presently into my  Thoughts to rap at the Glass as if I wanted to speak with some Body and if any Body was there they would be sure to come to the Window and then I would tell them to remove those Rings for that I had seen two suspicious Fellows take notice of them This was a ready Thought I rapt once or twice and no Body came when seeing the Coast clear I thrust hard against the Square of Glass and broke it with very little Noise and took out the two Rings and walk'd away with them very safe the Diamond Ring was worth about  l  and the other about  s  I WAS now at a loss for a Market for my Goods and especially for my two Peices of Silk I was very loth to dispose of them for a Trifle as the poor unhappy Theives in general do who after they have ventured their Lives for perhaps a thing of Value are fain to sell it for a Song when they have done but I was resolv'd I would not do thus whatever shift I made unless I was driven to the last Extremity however I did not well know what Course to take At last I resolv'd to go to my old Governness and acquaint myself with her again I had punctually supply'd the  l  a Year to her for my little Boy as long as I was able but at last was oblig'd to put a stop to it However I had written a Letter to her wherein I had told her that my Circumstances were reduc'd very low that I had lost my Husband and that I was not able to do it any longer and so beg'd that the poor Child might not suffer too much for its Mother's Misfortunes  I NOW made her a Visit and I found that she drove something of the old Trade still but that she was not in such flourishing Circumstances as before for she had been Sued by a certain Gentleman who had had his Daughter stolen from him  and who it seems she had helped to convey away and it was very narrowly that she escap'd the Gallows the Expence also had ravag'd her and she was become very poor her House was but meanly Furnished and she was not in such repute for her Practice as before however she stood upon her Legs▪ as they say and as she was a stirring bustling Woman and had some Stock left she was turn'd  Pawn Broker and liv'd pretty well    SHE receiv'd me very civily and with her usual obliging manner told me she would not have the less respect for me for my being reduc'd that she had taken Care my Boy was very well look'd after tho' I could not pay for him and that the Woman that had him was easie so that I needed not to Trouble myself about him till I might be better able to do it effectually  I TOLD her I had not much Money left but that I had some things that were Monies worth if she could tell me how I might turn them into Money she ask'd me what it was I had I pull'd out the string of gold Beads and told her it was one of my Husbands Presents to me then I show'd her the two Parcels of Silk which I told her I had from  Ireland  and brought up to Town with me and the little Diamond Ring as to the small Parcel of Plate and Spoons I had found means to dispose of them myself before and as for the Childbed Linnen I had she offer'd me to take it herself believing it to have been my own she told me that she was turn'd  PawnBroker  and that she would sell those things for me as pawn'd to her and so she sent presently for proper Agents that bought them being in her Hands without any scruple and gave good Prizes too  I NOW began to think this necessary Woman might help me a little in my low Condition to  some Business for I would gladly have turn'd my Hand to any honest Employment if I could have got it but here she was defficient honest Business did not come within her reach if I had been younger perhaps she might have helped me to a Spark but my Thoughts were off of that kind of Livelihood as being quite out of the way after which was my Case and so I told her  SHE invited me at last to come and be at her House till I could find something to do and it should cost me very little and this I gladly accepted of and now living a little easier I enter'd into some Measures to have my little Son by my last Husband taken off and this she made easie too reserving a Payment only of  l  a Year if I could pay it This was such a help to me that for a good while I left off the wicked Trade that I had so newly taken up and gladly I would have got my Bread by the help of my Needle if I cou'd have got Work but that was very hard to do for one that had no manner of Acquaintance in the World  HOWEVER at last I got some QuiltingWork for Ladies Beds Peticoats and the like and this I lik'd very well and work'd very hard and with this I began to live but the diligent Devil who resolv'd I should continue in his Service continually prompted me to go out and take a Walk that is to say to see if any thing would offer in the old Way  ONE Evening I blindly obeyed his Summons and fetch'd a long Circuit thro' the Streets but met with no purchase and came Home very weary and empty but not content with that I went out the next Evening too when going by an Alchouse I saw the Door of a little room open next the very Street and on the Table a silver Tankard things much in use in publick Houses at that time it seems  some Company had been drinking there and the careless Boys had forgot to take it away  I WENT into the Box frankly and setting the silver Tankard on the Corner of the Bench I sat down before it and knock'd with my Foot a Boy came presently and I bad him fetch me a pint of warm Ale for it was cold Weather the Boy run and I heard him go down the Sellar to draw the Ale while the Boy was gone another Boy come into the Room and cried  d  ye call  I spoke with a melancholly Air and said no Child the Boy is gone for a Pint of Ale for me  WHILE I sat here I heard the Woman in the Bar say are they all gone in the Five which was the Box I sat in and the Boy said  yes  who fetch'd the Tankard away  says the Woman  I did  says another Boy  that's it pointing it seems to another Tankard which he had fetch'd from another Box by Mistake or else it must be that the Rogue forgot that he had not brought it in which certainly he had not  I HEARD all this much to my satisfaction for I found plainly that the Tankard was not mist and yet they concluded it was fetch'd away so I drank my Ale call'd to Pay and as I went away  I said  take care of your Plate Child meaning a silver pint Mug which he brought me Drink in the Boy said  yes Madam very welcome  and away I came  I CAME Home to my Governness and now I thought it was a time to try her that if I might be put to the Necessity of being expos'd she might offer me some assistance when I had been at Home some time and had an opportunity of Talking to her I told her I had a Secret of the greatest Consequence in the World to commit to  her if she had respect enough for me to keep it a Secret She told me she had kept one of my Secrets faithfully why should I doubt her keep+ing another I told her the strangest thing in the World had befallen me and that it had made a Thief of me even without any design and so told her the whole Story of the Tankard And have you brought it away with you my Dear  says she  to be sure I have  says I  and shew'd it her But what shall I do now  says I  must not I carry it again  CARRY it again  says she  Ay if you are minded to be sent to  Newgate  for stealing it why  says I  they can't be so base to stop me when I carry it to them again You don't know those Sort of People Child  says she  they'll not only carry you to  Newgate  but hang you too without any regard to the honesty of returning it or bring in an Account of all the other Tankards they have lost for you to pay for What must I do then  says I  Nay  says she  as you have plaid the cunning part and stole it you must e'n keep it there's no going back now besides Child  says she  Don't you want it more than they do I wish you cou'd light of such a Bargain once a Week  THIS gave me a new Notion of my  Governess  and that since she was turn'd  Pawn Broker  she had a Sort of People about her that were none of the honest ones that I had met with there before  I HAD not been long there but I discover'd it more plainly than before for every now and then I saw Hilts of Swords Spoons Forks Tankards and all such kind of Ware brought in not to be Pawn'd but to be sold down right and she bought every thing that came without asking any  Questions but had very good Bargains as I found by her Discourse  I FOUND also that in the following this Trade she always melted down the Plate she bought that it might not be challeng'd and she came to me and told me one Morning that she was going to Melt and if I would she would put my Tankard in that it might not be seen by any Body I told her with all my Heart so she weigh'd it and allow'd me the full value in Silver again but I found she did not do the same to the rest of her Customers  SOMETIME after this as I was at Work and very melancholly she begins to ask me what the Matter was as she was us'd to do I told her my Heart was heavy I had little Work and nothing to live on and knew not what Course to take she Laugh'd and told me I must go out again and try my Fortune it might be that I might meet with another Peice of Plate O Mother  says I  that is a Trade I have no skill in and if I should be taken I am undone at once  says she  I cou'd help you to a SchoolMistress that shall make you as dexterous as her self I trembled at that Proposal for hitherto I had had no Confederates nor any Acquaintance among that Tribe but she conquer'd all my Modesty and all my Fears and in a little time by the help of this Confederate I grew as impudent a Thief and as dexterous as ever  Moll CutPurse  was tho' if Fame does not belie her not half so Handsome  THE Comrade she helped me to dealt in three sorts of Craft  viz  Shoplifting stealing of ShopBooks and PocketBooks and taking off Gold Watches from the Ladies Sides and this last she did so dexteriously that no Woman ever arriv'd to  the Perfection of that Art so as to do it like her I lik'd the first and the last of these things very well and I attended her some time in the Practise just as a Deputy attends a Midwife without any Pay  AT length she put me to Practise she had shewn me her Art and I had several times unhook'd a Watch from her own side with great dexterity at last she show'd me a Prize and this was a young Lady big with Child who had a charming Watch the thing was to be done as she came out of Church she goes on one side of the Lady and pretends just as she came to the Steps to fall and fell against the Lady with so much violence as put her into a great fright and both cry'd out terribly in the very moment that she jostl'd the Lady I had hold of the Watch and holding it the right way the start she gave drew the Hook out and she never felt it I made off immediately and left my Schoolmistress to come out of her pretended Fright gradually and the Lady too and presently the Watch was miss'd ay  says my Comrade  then it was those Rogues that thrust me down I warrant ye I wonder the Gentlewoman did not miss her Watch before then we might have taken them  SHE humour'd the thing so well that no Body suspected her and I was got home a full Hour before her This was my first Adventure in Company the Watch was indeed a very fine one and had a great many Trinkets about it and my Governess allow'd us  l  for it of which I had half and thus I was enter'd a compleat Thief harden'd to a Pitch above all the Reflections of Conscience or Modesty and to a Degree which I must acknowledge I never thought possible in me  THUS the Devil who began by the help of an irresistable Poverty to push me into this Wickedness brought me on to a height beyond the common Rate even when my Necessities were not so great or the prospect of my Misery so terrifying for I had  ow got into a little Vein of Work and as I was not at a loss to handle my Needle it was very probable as Acquaintance came in I might have got my Bread honestly enough  I must say that if such a prospect of Work had presented it self at first when I began to feel the approach of my miserables Circumstances I say had such a prospect of getting my Bread by working presented it self then I had never fallen into this wicked Trade or into such a wicked Gang as I was now embark'd with but practise had hardened me and I grew audacious to the last degree and the more so because I had carried it on so long and had never been taken for in a word my new Partner in Wickedness  and I  went on together so long without being ever detected that we not only grew Bold but we grew Rich and we had at one time One and Twenty Gold Watches in our Hands  I REMEMBER that one Day being a little more serious than ordinary and finding I had so good a Stock beforehand as I had for I had near  l  in Money for my Share it came strongly into my Mind no doubt from some kind Spirit if such there be that as at first Poverty excited me and my Distresses drove me to these dreadful Shifts so seeing those Distresses were now relieved and I could also get something towards a Maintenance by working and had so good a Bank to support me why should I not now leave off as they say while I was well that I could not  expect to go always free and if I was once surpris'd and miscarry'd I was undone  THIS was doubtless the happy Minute when if I had hearken'd to the blessed hint from whatsoever hand it came I had still a cast for an easie Life but my Fate was otherwise determin'd the busie Devil that so industriously drew me in had too fast hold of me to let me go back but as Poverty brought me into the Mire so Avarice kept me in till there was no going back as to the Arguments which my Reason dictated for perswading me to lay down Avarice stept in and said go on go on you have had very good luck go on till you have gotten Four or Five Hundred Pound and then you shall leave off and then you may live easie without working at all  THUS I that was once in the Devil's Clutches was held fast there as with a Charm and had no Power to go without the Circle till I was ingulph'd in Labyrinths of Trouble too great to get out at all  HOWEVER these Thoughts left some Impression upon me and made me act with some more caution than before and more than my Directors us'd for themselves My Comerade as I call'd her but rather she should have been called my Teacher with another of her Scholars was the first in the Misfortune for happening to be upon the hunt for Purchase they made an attempt upon a LinnenDraper in  Cheapside  but were snap'd by a Hawksey'd Journeyman and seiz'd with two pieces of Cambrick which were taken also upon them  THIS was enough to Lodge them both in  Newgate  where they had the Misfortune to have some of their former Sins brought to remembrance two  other Indictments being brought against them and the Facts being prov'd upon them they were both condemned to Die they both pleaded their Bellies and were both voted Quick with Child tho' my Tutress was no more with Child than I was  I WENT frequently to see them and Condole with them expecting that it would be my turn next but the place gave me so much Horror reflecting that it was the place of my unhappy Birth and of my Mother's Misfortunes that I could not bear it so I was forc'd to leave off going to see them  AND O cou'd I have but taken warning by their Disasters I had been happy still for I was yet free and had nothing brought against me but it could not be my Measure was not yet fill'd up  MY Comerade having the Brand of an old Offender was Executed the young Offender was spar'd having obtain'd a Reprieve but lay starving a long while in Prison till at last she got her Name into what they call a Circuit Pardon and so came off  THIS terrible Example of my Comerade frighted me heartily and for a good while I made no Excursions but one Night in the Neighbourhood of my Governesses House they cryed Fire my Governess look'd out for we were all up and cryed immediately that such a Gentlewoman's House was all of a light Fire a top and so indeed it was Here she gives me a jog now Child says she there is a rare opportunity the Fire being so near that you may go to it before the Street is block'd up with the Crow'd she presently gave me my Cue go Child  says she  to the House and run in and tell  the Lady or any Body you see that you come to help them and that you came from such a Gentlewoman that is one of her Acquaintance farther up the Street she gave me the like Cue to the next House naming another Name that was also an Acquaintance of the Gentlewoman of the House  AWAY I went and coming to the House I found them all in Confusion you may be sure I run in and finding one of the Maids Lord Sweetheart  said I  how came this dismal Accident Where is your Mistress And how does she do Is she safe And where are the Children I come from Madam to help you away runs the Maid Madam Madam  says she  screaming as loud as she cou'd yell  here is a Gentlewoman come from Madam to help us  The poor Woman half out of her Wits with a Bundle under her Arm and two little Children comes towards me  Lord Madam says I  let me carry the poor Children to Madam she desires you to send them she'll take care of the poor Lambs and immediately I takes one of them out of her Hand and she lifts the tother up into my Arms  ay do for God sake  says she  carry them to her O thank her for her kindness  Have you  any thing else to secure  Madam says I  she will take care of it  O dear ay says she  God bless her and thank her take this bundle of Plate and carry it to her too O she is a good Woman O Lord we are utterly ruin'd utterly undone  and away she runs from me out of her Wits and the Maids after her and away comes I with the two Children and the Bundle  I WAS no sooner got into the Street but I saw another Woman come to me O  says she  Mistress in a piteous Tone you will let fall the Child come this is a sad time let me help you  and immediately lays hold of my Bundle to carry it for me no  says I  if you will help me take the Child by the Hand and lead it for me but to the upper end of the Street I'll go with you and satisfie you for your pains  SHE cou'd not avoid going after what I said but the Creature in short was one of the same Business with me and wanted nothing but the Bundle however she went with me to the Door for she cou'd not help it when we were come there I whisper'd her  go Child  said I  I understand your Trade  you may meet with Purchase enough  SHE understood me and walk'd off I thundered at the Door with the Children and as the People were rais'd before by the noise of the Fire I was soon let in and I said  is Madam awake pray tell her  Mrs  desires the favour of her to take the two Children in  poor Lady  she will be undone their House is all of a Flame  they took the Children in very civily pitied the Family in Distress and away came I with my Bundle one of the Maids ask'd me if I was not to leave the Bundle too I said no Sweetheart 'tis to go to another place it does not belong to them  I WAS a great way out of the hurry now and so I went on clear of any Body's enquiry and brought the bundle of Plate which was very considerable strait home and gave it to my old Governess she told me she would not look into it but bad me go out again to look for more  SHE gave me the like Cue to the Gentlewoman of the next House to that which was on Fire and I did my endeavour to go but by this time the allarm of Fire was so great and so many Engines playing and the Street so throng'd with People that I cou'd not get near the House whatever I  cou'd do so I came back again to my Governesses and taking the Bundle up into my Chamber I began to examine it It is with Horror that I tell what a Treasure I found there 'tis enough to say that besides most of the Family Plate which was considerable I found a Gold Chain an old fashion'd thing the Locket of which was broken so that I suppose it had not been us'd some Years but the Gold was not the worse for that also a little Box of burying Rings the Lady's WeddingRing and some broken bits of old Lockets of Gold a Gold Watch and a Purse with about  l  value in old pieces of Gold Coin and several other things of Value  THIS was the greatest and the worst Prize that ever I was concern'd in for indeed tho' as I have said above I was harden'd now beyond the Power of all Reflection in other Cases yet it really touch'd me to the very Soul when I look'd into this Treasure to think of the poor disconsolate Gentlewoman who had lost so much by the Fire besides and who would think to be sure that she had sav'd her Plate and best things how she wou'd be surpriz'd and afflicted when she should find that she had been deceiv'd and should find that the Person that took her Children and her Goods had not come as was pretended from the Gentlewoman in the next Street but that the Children had been put upon her without her own knowledge  I SAY I confess the inhumanity of this Action mov'd me very much and made me relent exceedingly and Tears stood in my Eyes upon that Subject But with all my Sense of its being cruel and Inhuman I cou'd never find in my Heart to make any Restitution The Reflection wore off and  I began quickly to forget the Circumstances that attended the taking them  NOR was this all for tho' by this jobb I was become considerably Richer than before yet the Resolution I had formerly taken of leaving off this horrid Trade when I had gotten a little more did not return but I must still get farther and more and the Avarice join'd so with the Success that I had no more thoughts of coming to a timely Alteration of Life tho' without it I cou'd expect no Safety no Tranquility in the Possession of what I had so wickedly gain'd but a little more and a little more was the Case still  AT length yielding to the Importunities of my Crime I cast off all Remorse and Repentance and all the Reflections on that Head turn'd to no more than this that I might perhaps come to have one Booty more that might compleat my Desires but tho' I certainly had that one Booty yet every hit look'd towards another and was so encouraging to me to go on with the Trade that I had no Gust to the Thought of laying it down  IN this Condition harden'd by Success and resolving to go on I fell into the Snare in which I was appointed to meet with my last Reward for this kind of Life But even this was not yet for I met with several successful Adventures more in this way of being undone  I remain'd still with my Governess who was for a while really concern'd for the Misfortune of my Comerade that had been hang'd and who it seems knew enough of my Governess to have sent her the same way and which made her very uneasy indeed she was in a very great fright  IT is true that when she was gone and had not open'd her Mouth to tell what she knew My Governess  was easy as to that Point and perhaps glad she was hang'd for it was in her power to have obtain'd a Pardon at the Expence of her Friends But on the other Hand the loss of her and the Sense of her Kindness in not making her Market of what she knew mov'd my Governess to Mourn very sincerely her I comforted her as well as I cou'd and she in return harden'd me to Merit more compleatly the same Fate  HOWEVER as I have said it made me the more wary and particularly I was very shie of Shoplifting especially among the  Mercers  and  Drapers  who are a Set of Fellows that have their Eyes very much about them I made a Venture or two among the Lace Folks and the Mileners and particularly at one Shop where I got Notice of two young Women who were newly set up and had not been bred to the Trade There I think I carried off a Peice of Bonelace worth six or seven pound and a Paper of Thread but this was but once it was a Trick that would not serve again  IT was always reckon'd a safe Job when we heard of a new Shop and especially▪ when the People were such as were not bred to Shops such may depend upon it that they will be visited once or twice at their beginning and they must be very Sharp indeed if they can prevent it  I MADE another Adventure or two but they were but Trifles too tho' sufficient to live on after this nothing considerable offering for a good while I began to think that I must give over the Trade in Earnest but my Governess who was not willing to lose me and expected great Things of me brought me one Day into Company with a young Woman and a Fellow that went for her Husband tho' as it appear'd afterwards she was  not his Wife but they were Partners it seems in the Trade they carried on and Partners in something else too  In short  they robb'd together lay together were taken together and at last were hang'd together  I CAME into a kind of League with these two by the help of my Governess and they carried me out into three or four Adventures where I rather saw them commit some Course and unhandy Robberies in which nothing but a great Stock of impudence on their Side and gross Negligence on the Peoples Side who were robb'd could have made them Successful so I resolv'd from that time forward to be very Cautious how I Adventur'd upon any thing with them and indeed when two or three unlucky Projects were propos'd by them I declin'd the offer and perswaded them against it One time they particularly propos'd Robbing a Watchmaker of Gold Watches which they had Ey'd in the Day time and found the Place where he laid them one of them had so many Keys of all kinds that he made no Question to open the Place where the Watchmaker had laid them and so we made a kind of an Appointment but when I came to look narrowly into the Thing I found they propos'd breaking open the House and this as a thing out of my Way I would not Embark in so they went without me They did get into the House by main Force and broke up the lock'd Place where the Watches were but found but one of the Gold Watches and a Silver one which they took and got out of the House again very clear but the Family being alarm'd cried out Thieves and the Man was pursued and taken the young Woman had got off too but unhappily was stop'd at a  Distance and the Watches found upon her and thus I had a second Escape for they were convicted and both hang'd being old Offenders tho' but young People as  I said before  that they robbed together and lay together so now they hang'd together and there ended my new Partnership  I BEGAN now to be very wary having so narrowly escap'd a Scouring and having such an Example before me but I had a new Tempter who prompted me every Day I mean my Governess and now a Prize presented which as it came by her Management so she expected a good Share of the Booty there was a good Quantity of FlandersLace Lodg'd in a private House where she had gotten Intelligence of it and FlandersLace being then Prohibited it was a good Booty to any CustomHouse Officer that could come at it I had a full Account from my Governess as well of the Quantity as of the very Place where it was conceal'd and I went to a CustomHouse Officer and told him I had such a Discovery to make to him of such a Quantity of Lace if he would assure me that I should have my due Share of the Reward This was so just an offer that nothing could be fairer so he agreed and taking a Constable and me with him we beset the House as I told him I could go directly to the Place He left it to me and the Hole being very dark I squeez'd myself into it with a Candle in my Hand and so reach'd the Peices out to him taking care as I gave him some so to secure as much about myself as I could conveniently Dispose of There was near  l  worth of Lace in the whole and I secur'd about  l  worth of it to myself The People of the House were not owners of the Lace but a Merchant who had entrusted them  with it so that they were not so surpriz'd as I thought they would be  I LEFT the Officer overjoy'd with his Prize and fully satisfy'd with what he had got and appointed to meet him at a House of his own directing where I came after I had dispos'd of the Cargo I had about me of which he had not the least Suspicion when I came to him he began to Capitulate with me believing I did not understand the right I had to a Share in the Prize and would fain have put me off with Twenty Pound but I let him know that I was not so ignorant as he suppos'd I was and yet I was glad too that he offer'd to bring me to a certainty I ask'd  l  and he rise up to  l  I fell to  l  and he rise again to  l  in a Word he offer'd  l  and I consented only demanding a Peice of Lace which I thought came to about or Pound as if it had been for my own Wear and he agreed to it so I got  l  in Money paid me that same Night and made an End of the Bargain nor did he ever know who I was or where to enquire for me so that if it had been discover'd that part of the Goods were embezzel'd he could have made no Challenge upon me for it  I VERY punctually divided this Spoil with my Governess and I pass'd with her from this time for a very dexterous Manager in the nicest Cases I found that this last was the best and easiest sort of Work that was in my way and I made it my business to enquire out prohibited Goods and after buying some usually betray'd them but none of these Discoveries amounted to any thing Considerable not like that I related just now but I was willing to act safe and was still Cautions of  running the great Risques which I found others did and in which they Miscarried every Day  THE next thing of Moment was an attempt at a Gentlewoman's gold Watch it happen'd in a Crowd at a MeetingHouse where I was in very great Danger of being taken I had full hold of her Watch but giving a great Jostle as if some body had thrust me against her and in the Juncture giving the Watch a fair pull I found it would not come so I let it go that Moment and cried out as if I had been kill'd that some body had Trod upon my Foot and that there was certainly  Pickpockets  there for some body or other had given a pull at my Watch for you are to observe that on these Adventures we always went very well Dress'd and I had very good Cloaths on and a Gold Watch by my Side as like a Lady as other Folks  I HAD no sooner said so but the tother Gentlewoman cried out  a Pickpocket  too for some body  she said  had try'd to pull her Watch away  WHEN I touc'd her Watch I was close to her but when I cry'd out I stop'd as it were short and the Crowd bearing her forward a little she made a Noise too but it was at some Distance from me so that she did not in the least suspect me but when she cried out  a Pickpocket  some body cried Ay and here has been another this Gentlewoman has been attempted too  AT that very instant a little farther in the Crowd and very Luckily too they cried out  a Pickpocket  again and really seiz'd a young Fellow in the very Fact This tho' unhappy for the Wretch was very opportunely for my Case tho' I had carried it off handsomely enough before but now it was out of Doubt and all the loose part of the  Crowd run that way and the poor Boy was deliver'd up to the Rage of the Street which is a Cruelty I need not describe and which however they are always glad of rather than to be sent to  Newgate  where they lie often a long time till they are almost perish'd and sometimes they are hang'd and the best they can look for if they are Convicted is to be Transported  THIS was a narrow Escape to me and I was so frighted that I ventur'd no more at Gold Watches a great while there was indeed a great many concurring Circumstances in this Adventure which assisted to my Escape but the chief was that the Woman whose Watch I had pull'd at was a Fool that is to say she was Ignorant of the nature of the Attempt which one would have thought she should not have been seeing She was wise enough to fasten her Watch so that it could not be slipt up but she was in such a Fright that she had no thought about her proper for the Discovery for she when she felt the pull scream'd out and push'd herself forward and put all the People about her into disorder but said not a Word of her Watch or of a  Pickpocket  for at least two Minutes time which was time enough for me and to spare for as I had cried out behind her  as I have said  and bore myself back in the Crowd as she bore forward there were several People at least seven or eight the Throng being still moving on that were got between me and her in that time and then I crying out  a Pickpocket  rather sooner than she or at least as soon she might as well be the Person suspected as I and the People were confus'd in their Enquiry whereas had she with a Presence of Mind needful on such an Occasion  as soon as she felt the pull not skream'd out as she did but turn'd immediately round and seiz'd the next Body that was behind her she had infallibly taken me  THIS is a Direction not of the kindest Sort to the Fraternity but 'tis certainly a Key to the Clue of  a Pickpockets  Motions and whoever can follow it will as certainly catch the Thief as he will be sure to miss if he does not  I HAD another Adventure which puts this Matter out of doubt and which may be an Instruction for Posterity in the Case of  a Pickpocket  my good old Governess to give a short touch at her History tho' she had left off the Trade was as I may say born  a Pickpocket  and as I understood afterward had run thro' all the several Degrees of that Art and yet had never been taken but once when she was so grossly detected that she was convicted and orderd to be Transported but being a Woman of a rare Tongue and withal having Money in her Pocket she found Means the Ship putting into  Ireland  for Provisions to get on Shore there where she liv'd and practis'd her old Trade for some Years when falling into another sort of bad Company she turn'd Midwife and Procuress and play'd a Hundred Pranks there which she gave me a little History of in Confidence between us as we grew more intimate and it was to this wicked Creature that I ow'd all the Art and Dexterity I arriv'd to in which there were few that ever went beyond me or that practis'd so long without any Misfortune  IT was after those Adventures in  Ireland  and when she was pretty well known in that Country that she left  Dublin  and came over to  England  where the time of her Transportation being not expir'd she left her former Trade for fear of falling into  bad Hands again for then she was sure to have gone to Wreck Here she set up the same Trade she had followed in  Ireland  in which she soon by her admirable Management and a good Tongue arriv'd to the Height which I hav already describ'd and indeed began to be Rich tho' her Trade fell off again afterwards as I have hinted before  I mention thus much of the History of this Woman here the better to account for the concern she had in the wicked Life I was now leading into all the particulars of which she led me as it were by the Hand and gave me such Directions and I so well follow'd them that I grew the greatest Artist of my time and work'd myself out of every Danger with such Dexterity that when several more of my Comrades run themselves into  Newgate  presently and by that time they had been Half a Year at the Trade I had now Practis'd upwards of five Year and the People at  Newgate  did not so much as know me they had heard much of me indeed and often expected me there but I always got off tho' many times in the extreamest Danger  ONE of the greatest Dangers I was now in was that I was too well known among the Trade and some of them whose hatred was owing rather to Envy than any Injury I had done them began to be Angry that I should always Escape when they were always catch'd and hurried to  Newgate  These were they that gave me the Name of  Moll Flanders  For it was no more of Affinity with my real Name or with any of the Names I had ever gone by than black is of Kin to white except that once as before I call'd my self Mrs  Flanders  when I sheltered myself in the  Mint  but that these Rogues never knew nor  could I ever learn how they came to give me the Name or what the Occasion of it was  I WAS soon inform'd that some of these who were gotten fast into  Newgate  had vowed to Impeach me and as I knew that two or three of them were but too able to do it I was under a great concern about it and kept within Doors for a good while but my Governess who▪ I always made Partner in my Success and who now plaid a sure Game with me for that she had a Share of the Gain and no Share in the hazard  I say  my Governess was something impatient of my leading such a useless unprofitable Life as she call'd it and she laid a new Contrivance for my going Abroad and this was to Dress me up in Mens Cloths and so put me into a new kind of Practise  I WAS Tall and Personable but a little too smooth Fac'd for a Man however as I seldom went Abroad but in the Night it did well enough but it was a long time before I could behave in my new Cloths I mean as to my Craft it was impossible to be so Nimble so Ready so Dexterous at these things in a Dress so contrary to Nature and as I did every thing Clumsily so I had neither the success or the easiness of Escape that I had before and I resolv'd to leave it off but that Resolution was confirm'd soon after by the following Accident  AS my Governess had disguis'd me like a Man so she joyn'd me with a Man a young Fellow that was Nimble enough at his Business and for about three Weeks we did very well together Our principal Trade was watching ShopKeepers Compters and Slipping off any kind of Goods we could see carelesly laid any where and we made several very good Bargains as we call'd them  at this Work And as we kept always together so we grew very intimate yet he never knew that I was not a Man nay tho' I several times went home with him to his Lodgings according as our business directed and four or five times lay with him all Night But our Design lay another way and it was absolutely necessary to me to conceal my Sex from him as appear'd afterwards The Circumstances of our Living coming in late and having such and such Business to do as requir'd that no Body should be trusted with coming into our Lodgings were such as made it impossible to me to refuse lying with him unless I would have own'd my Sex and as it was I effectually conceal'd my self  BUT his ill and my good Fortune soon put an end to this Life which I must own I was sick of too on several other Accounts We had made several Prizes in this new way of Business but the last would have been extraordinary there was a Shop in a certain Street which had a Warehouse behind it that look'd into another Street the House making the corner of the turning  THROUGH the Window of the Warehouse we saw lying on the Counter or Showboard which was just before it Five pieces of Silks besides other Stuffs and tho' it was almost dark yet the People being busie in the fore shop with Customers had not had time to shut up those Windows or else had forgot it  THIS the young Fellow was so overjoy'd with that he could not restrain himself it lay all within his reach he said and he swore violently to me that he would have it if he broke down the House for it I disswaded him a little but saw there was no remedy so he run rashly upon it slipt out a  Square out of the Sash Window dexterously enough and without noise and got out four pieces of the Silks and came with them towards me but was immediately pursued with a terrible Clutter and Noise we were standing together indeed but I had not taken any of the Goods out of his Hand when I said to him hastily you are undone fly for God sake he run like Lightning and I too but the pursuit was hotter after him because he had the Goods than after me he dropt two of the Pieces which stop'd them a little but the Crowd encreas'd and pursued us both they took him soon after with the other two pieces upon him and then the rest followed me I run for it and got into my Governesses House whether some quickeyed People follow'd me so warmly as to fix me there they did not immediately knock at the Door by which I got time to throw off my Disguise and dress me in my own Cloths besides when they came there my Governess who had her Tale ready kept her Door shut and call'd out to them and told them there was no Man came in there the People affirm'd there did a Man come in there and swore they would break open the Door  MY Governess not at all surpriz'd spoke calmly to them told them they should very freely come and search her House if they would bring a Constable and let in none but such as the Constable would admit for it was unreasonable to let in a whole Crowd this they could not refuse tho' they were a Crowd so a Constable was fetch'd immediately and she very freely open'd the Door the Constable kept the Door and the Men he appointed search'd the House my Governess going with them from Room to Room when she came to my Room she call'd to me and said  aloud Cousin pray open the Door here's some Gentlemen that must come and look into your Room  I HAD a little Girl with me which was my Governesses Grandchild as she call'd her and I bad her open the Door and there sat I at work with a great litter of things about me as if I had been at Work all Day being my self quite undress'd with only Nightcloaths on my Head and a loose Morning Gown wrapt about me My Governess made a kind of excuse for their disturbing me telling me partly the occasion of it and that she had no Remedy but to open the Doors to them and let them satisfie themselves for all she could say to them would not satisfie them I sat still and bid them search the Room if they pleas'd for if there was any Body in the House I was sure they was not in my Room and as for the rest of the House I had nothing to say to that I did not understand what they look'd for  EVERY thing look'd so innocent and so honest about me that they treated me civiller than I expected but it was not till they had search'd the Room to a nicety even under the Bed in the Bed and every where else where it was possible any thing cou'd be hid when they had done this and cou'd find nothing they ask'd my Pardon for troubling me and went down  WHEN they had thus searched the House from Bottom to Top and then from Top to Bottom and cou'd find nothing they appeas'd the Mob pretty well but they carried my Governess before the Justice Two Men swore that they see the Man who they pursued go into her House My Governess rattled and made a great noise that  her House should be insulted and that she should be used thus for nothing that if a Man did come in he might go out again presently for ought she knew for she was ready to make Oath that no Man had been within her Doors all that Day as she knew of and that was very true indeed that it might be indeed that as she was above Stairs any Fellow in a Fright might find the Door open and run in for shelter when he was pursued but that she knew nothing of it and if it had been so he certainly went out again perhaps at the other Door for she had another Door into an Alley and so had made his escape and cheated them all  THIS was indeed probable enough and the Justice satisfied himself with giving her an Oath that she had not receiv'd or admitted any Man into her House to conceal him or protect or hide him from Justice This Oath she might justly take and did so and so she was dismiss'd  IT is easie to judge what a fright I was in upon this occasion and it was impossible for my Governess ever to bring me to Dress in that Disguise again for as I told her I should certainly betray my self  MY poor Partner in this Mischief was now in a bad Case for he was carried away before my Lord Mayor and by his Worship committed to  Newgate  and the People that took him were so willing as well as able to Prosecute him that they offer'd themselves to enter into Recognisances to appear at the Sessions and persue the Charge against them  HOWEVER he got his Indictment deferr'd upon promise to discover his Accomplices and particularly the Man that was concern'd with  him in this Robbery and he fail'd not to do his endeavour for he gave in my Name who he call'd  Gabriel Spencer  which was the Name I went by to him and here appear'd the Wisdom of my concealing my Name and Sex from him which if he had ever known I had been undone  HE did all he cou'd to discover this  Gabriel Spencer  he describ'd me he discover'd the place where he said I Lodg'd and in a word all the Particulars that he cou'd of my Dwelling but having conceal'd the main Circumstances of my Sex from him I had a vast Advantage and he never cou'd hear of me he brought two or three Families into Trouble by his endeavouring to find me out but they knew nothing of me any more than that I had a Fellow with me that they had seen but knew nothing of and as for my Governess tho' she was the means of his coming to me yet it was done at second hand and he knew nothing of her  THIS turn'd to his Disadvantage for having promis'd Discoveries but not being able to make it good it was look'd upon as a trifling with the Justice of the City and he was the more fiercely persued by the Shopkeepers who took him  I WAS however terribly uneasie all this while and that I might be quite out of the way I went away from my Governesses for a while but not knowing whether to wander I took a Maid Servant with me and took the Stage Coach to  Dunstable  to my old Landlord and Landlady where I had liv'd so handsomly with my  Lancashire  Husband Here I told her a formal Story that I expected my Husband every Day from  Ireland  and that I had sent a Letter to him that I would meet  him at  Dunstable  at her House and that he would certainly Land if the Wind was fair in a few Days so that I was come to spend a few Days with them till he should come for he would either come Post or in the  WestChester  Coach I knew not which but which soever it was he would be sure to come to that House to meet me  MY Landlady was mighty glad to see me and my Landlord made such a stir with me that if I had been a Princess I cou'd not have been better used and here I might have been welcome a Month or two if I had thought fit  BUT my Business was of another Nature I was very uneasie tho' so well Disguis'd that it was scarce possible to Detect me least this Fellow should some how or other find me out and tho' he cou'd not charge me with this Robbery having perswaded him not to venture and having also done nothing in it my self but run away yet he might have charg'd me with other things and have bought his own Life at the Expence of mine  THIS fill'd me with horrible Apprehensions I had no Recourse no Friend no Confident but my old Governess and I knew no Remedy but to put my Life in her Hands and so I did for I let her know where to send to me and had several Letters from her while I stayed here some of them almost scar'd me out of my Wits but at last she sent me the joyful News that he was hang'd which was the best News to me that I had heard a great while  I HAD stay'd here five Weeks and liv'd very comfortably indeed the secret Anxiety of my Mind excepted but when I receiv'd this Letter I look'd pleasantly again and told my Landlady  that I had receiv'd a Letter from my Spouse in  Ireland  that I had the good News of his being very well but had the bad News that his business would not permit him to come away so soon as he expected and so I was like to go back again without him  MY Landlady complemented me upon the good News however that I had heard he was well for I have observ'd Madam  says she  you han't been so pleasant as you us'd to be you have been over Head and Ears in Care for him I dare say  says the good Woman  'tis easie to be seen there's an alteration in you for the better  says she  Well I am sorry the Esquire can't come yet  says my Landlord  I should have been heartily glad to have seen him but I hope when you have certain News of his coming you'll take a step hither again Madam  says he  you shall be very welcome whenever you please to come  WITH all these fine Complements we parted and I came merry enough to  London  and found my Governess as well pleas'd as I was and now she told me she would never recommend any Partner to me again for she always found  she said  that I had the best luck when I ventur'd by my self and so indeed I had for I was seldom in any Danger when I was by my self or if I was I got out of it with more Dexterity than when I was entangled with the dull Measures of other People who had perhaps less forecast and were more rash and impatient than I for tho' I had as much Courage to venture as any of them yet I used more caution before I undertook a thing and had more Presence of Mind when I was to bring my self off  I HAVE often wondered even at my own hardiness another way that when all my Companions were surpriz'd and fell so suddainly into the Hand of Justice and that I so narrowly escap'd yet I could not all that while enter into one serious Resolution to leave off this Trade and especially Considering that I was now very far from being poor that the Temptation of Necessity which is generally the Introduction of all such Wickedness was now remov'd for I had near  l  by me in ready Money on which I might have liv'd very well if I had thought fit to have retir'd but  I say  I had not so much as the least inclination to leave off no not so much as I had before when I had but  l  beforehand and when I had no such frightful Examples before my Eyes as these were From hence 'tis Evident to me that when once we are harden'd in Crime no Fear can affect us no Example give us any warning  I HAD indeed one Comrade whose Fate went very near me for a good while tho' I wore it off too in time that Case was indeed very unhappy I had made a Prize of a Piece of very good Damask in a  Mercers  Shop and went clear off myself but had convey'd the Peice to this Companion of mine when we went out of the Shop and she went one way and I went another We had not been long out of the Shop but the  Mercer  mist his Peice of Stuff and sent his Messengers one one way and one another and they presently seiz'd her that had the Peice with the Damask upon her as for me I had very Luckily step'd into a House where there was a Lace Chamber up one Pair of Stairs and had the Satisfaction or the Terror indeed of looking out of the Window upon the Noise they made and seeing the poor Creature  drag'd away in Triumph to the Justice who immediately committed her to  Newgate    I WAS careful to attempt nothing in the LaceChamber but tumbl'd their Goods pretty much to spend time then bought a few Yards of Edging and paid for it and came away very sad Hearted indeed for the poor Woman who was in Tribulation for what I only had stolen  HERE again my old Caution stood me in good stead Namely that tho' I often robb'd with these People yet I never let them know who I was or where I Lodg'd nor could they ever find out my Lodging tho' they often endeavour'd to Watch me to it They all knew me by the Name of  Moll Flanders  tho' even some of them rather believ'd I was she than knew me to be so my Name was publick among them indeed but how to find me out they knew not nor so much as how to guess at my Quarters whether they were at the EastEnd of the Town or the West and this wariness was my safety upon all these Occasions  I KEPT close a great while upon the Occasion of this Womans disaster I knew that if I should do any thing that should Miscarry and should be carried to Prison she would be there and ready to Witness against me and perhaps save her Life at my Expence I consider'd that I began to be very well known by Name at the  Old Baily  tho' they did not know my Face and that if I should fall into their Hands I should be treated as an old Offender and for this Reason I was resolv'd to see what this poor Creatures Fate should be before I stirr'd Abroad tho' several times in her Distress I convey'd Money to her for her Relief  AT length she came to her Tryal she pleaded she did not steal the Things but that one Mrs  Flanders  as she heard her call'd for she did not know her gave the Bundle to her after they came out of the Shop and bad her carry it Home to her Lodging They ask'd her where this Mrs  Flanders  was but she could not produce her neither could she give the least Account of me and the  Mercers  Men swearing positively that she was in the Shop when the Goods were stolen that they immediately miss'd them and pursu'd her and found them upon her Thereupon the Jury brought her in Guilty but the Court considering that she really was not the Person that stole the Goods an inferiour Assistant and that it was very possible she could not find out this Mrs  Flanders meaning me  tho' it would save her Life which indeed was true I say considering all this they allow'd her to be be Transported which was the utmost Favour she could obtain only that the Court told her that if she could in the mean time produce the said Mrs  Flanders  they would intercede for her Pardon that is to say if she could find me out and hang me she should not be Transported This I took care to make impossible to her and so she was Shipp'd off in pursuance of her Sentence a little while after  I MUST repeat it again that the Fate of this poor Woman troubl'd me exceedingly and I began to be very pensive knowing that I was really the Instrument of her disaster but the Preservation of my own Life which was so evidently in Danger took off all my tenderness and seeing she was not put to Death I was very easie at her Transportation because she was then  out of the way of doing me any Mischief whatever should happen  THE Disaster of this Woman was some Months before that of the last recited Story and was indeed partly the Occasion of my Governess proposing to Dress me up in Mens Cloths that I might go about unobserv'd as indeed I did but I was soon tir'd of that Disguise as  I have said  for indeed it expos'd me to too many Difficulties  I WAS now easie as to all Fear of Witnesses aganst me for all those that had either been concern'd with me or that knew me by the Name of  Moll Flanders  were either hang'd or Transported and if I should have had the Misfortune to be taken I might call myself any thing else as well as  Moll Flanders  and no old Sins could be plac'd to my Account so I began to run a Tick again with the more freedom and several successful Adventurers I made tho' not such as I had made before  WE had at that time another Fire happen'd not a great way off from the Place where my Governess liv'd and I made an attempt there as before but as I was not soon enough before the Crowd of People came in and could not get to the House I aim'd at instead of a Prize I got a mischief which had almost put a Period to my Life and all my wicked doings together for the Fi  e being very furious and the People in a great Fright in removing their Goods and throwing them out of Window a Wench from out of a Window threw a Featherbed just upon me it is true the Bed being soft it broke no Bones but as the weight was great and made greater by the Fall it beat me down and laid me dead for while nor did the People concern themselves much to deliver me from it or to recover me at all but I lay like one Dead and neglected a good while till  some body going to remove the Bed out of the way helped me up it was indeed a wonder the People in the House had not thrown other Goods out after it and which might have fallen upon it and then I had been inevitably kill'd but I was reserved for further Afflictions  THIS Accident however spoil'd my Market for that time and I came Home to my Governess very much hurt and Bruised and Frighted to the last degree and it was a good while before she could set me upon my Feet again  IT was now a Merry time of the Year and  Bartholomew  Fair was begun I had never made any Walks that Way nor was the common Part of the Fair of much Advantage to me but I took a turn this Year into the Cloisters and among the rest I fell into one of the Raffling Shops It was a thing of no great Consequence to me nor did I expect to make much of it but there came a Gentleman extreamly well Dress'd and very Rich and as 'tis frequent to talk to every Body in those Shops he singl'd me out and was very particular with me first told he me he would put in for me to Raffle and did so and some small matter coming to his Lot he presented it to me I think it was a Feather Must Then he continu'd to keep talking to me with a more than common Appearance of Respect but still very civil and much like a Gentleman  HE held me in talk so long till at last he drew me out of the Raffling Place to the ShopDoor and then to take a walk in the Cloister still talking of a Thousand things Cursorily without any thing to the purpose at last he told me that without Complement he was charm'd with my Company and ask'd me if I durst trust myself in a Coach with him he told me he was a Man of  honour and would not offer any thing to me unbecoming him as such I seem'd to decline it a while but suffer'd myself to be importun'd a little and then yielded  I WAS at a loss in my Thoughts to conclude at first what this Gentleman design'd but I found afterward he had had some drink in his Head and that he was not very unwilling to have some more He carried me in the Coach to the  SpringGarden  at  Knight'sBridge  where we walk'd in the Gardens and he Treated me very handsomely but I found he drank very freely he press'd me also to drink but I declin'd it  HITHERTO he kept his Word with me and offer'd me nothing amiss we came away in the Coach again and he brought me into the Streets and by this time it was near Ten a Clock at Night and he stop'd the Coach at a House where it seems he was acquainted and where they made no scruple to show us up Stairs into a Room with a Bed in it at first I seem'd to be unwilling go up but after a few Words I yielded to that too being indeed willing to see the End of it and in Hopes to make something of it at last as for the Bed  c  I was not much concern'd about that Part  HERE he began to be a little freer with me than he had promis'd and I by little and little yielded to every thing so that in a Word he did what he pleas'd with me I need say no more all this while he drank freely too and about One in the Morning we went into the Coach again the Air and the shaking of the Coach made the Drink he had get more up in his Head than it was before and he grewuneasy in the Coach and was for acting over again whathe had been doing before but as  I thought my Game now secure I resisted him and brought him to be a little still which had not lasted five Minutes but he fell fast asleep  I TOOK this opportunity to search him to a Nicety I took a gold Watch with a silk Purse of Gold his fine full bottom Perrewig and silver fring'd Gloves his Sword and fine Snuffbox and gently opening the Coachdoor stood ready to jump out while the Coach was going on but the Coach stopping in the narrow Street beyond  TempleBar  to let another Coach pass I got softly out fasten'd the Door again and gave my Gentleman and the Coach the slip both together and never heard more of them  THIS was an Adventure indeed unlook'd for and perfectly undesign'd by me tho' I was not so past the Merry part of Life as to forget how to behave when a Fop so blinded by his Appetite should not know an old Woman from a young I did not indeed look so old as I was by ten or twelve Year yet I was not a young Wench of Seventeen and it was easie enough to be distinguish'd There is nothing so absurd so surfeiting so ridiculous as a Man heated by Wine in his Head and a wicked Gust in his Inclination together he is in the possession of two Devils at once and can no more govern himself by his Reason than a Mill can Grind without Water His Vice tramples upon all that was in him that had any good in it if any such thing there was nay his very Sense is blinded by its own Rage and he acts Absurdities even in his View such is Drinking more when he is Drunk already picking up a common Woman without regard to what she is or who she is whether Sound or rotten Clean or Unclean whether Ugly or  Handsome whether Old or Young and so blinded as not really to distinguish such a Man is worse than Lunatick prompted by his vicious corrupted Head he no more knows what he is doing than this Wretch of mine knew when I pick'd his Pocket of his Watch and his Purse of Gold  THESE are the Men of whom  Solomon  says  they go like an Ox to the slaughter till a Dart strikes through their Liver  an admirable Description  by the way  of the soul Disease which is a poisonous deadly Contagion mingling with the Blood whose Center or Fountain is in the Liver from whence by the swift Circulation of the whole Mass that dreadful nauceous Plague strikes immediately thro' his Liver and his Spirits are infected his Vitals stab'd thro' as with a Dart  IT is true this poor unguarded Wretch was in no Danger from me tho' I was greatly apprehensive at first of what Danger I might be in from him but he was really to be pityed in one respect that he seem'd to be a good sort of a Man in himself a Gentleman that had no harm in his Design a Man of Sense and of a fine Behaviour a comely handsome Person a sober solid Countenance a charming beautiful Face and every thing that cou'd be agreeable only had unhappily had some Drink the Night before had not been in Bed as he told me when we were together was hot and his Blood fir'd with Wine and in that Condition his Reason  as it were  asleep had given him up  As for me my Business was his Money and what I could make of him and after that if I could have found out any way to have done it I would have sent him safe home to his House and  to his Family for 'twas ten to one but he had an honest virtuous Wife and innocent Children that were anxious for his Safety and would have been glad to have gotten him Home and have taken care of him till he was restor'd to himself and then with what Shame and Regret would he look back upon himself how would he reproach himself with associating himself with a Whore pick'd up in the worst of all Holes the Cloister among the Dirt and Filth of all the Town how would he be trembling for fear he had got the Pox for fear a Dart had struck through his Liver and hate himself every time he look'd back upon the Madness and Brutality of his Debauch how would he if he had any Principles of Honour as I verily believe he had I say how would he abhor the Thought of giving any ill Distemper if he had it as for ought he knew he might to his Modest and Virtuous Wife and thereby sowing the Contagion in the Lifeblood of his Posterity  WOULD such Gentlemen but consider the contemptible Thoughts which the very Women they are concern'd with in such Cases as these have of them it wou'd be a surfeit to them As I said above they value not the Pleasure they are rais'd by no Inclination to the Man the passive Jade thinks of no Pleasure but the Money and when he is as it were drunk in the Extasies of his wicked Pleasure her Hands are in his Pockets searching for what she can find there and of which he can no more be sensible in the Moment of his Folly than he can forethink of it when he goes about it  I KNEW a Woman that was so dexterous with a Fellow who indeed deserv'd no better usage that while he was busie with her another way convey'd his Purse with twenty Guineas in it out of  his Fob Pocket where he had put it for fear of her and put another Purse with guilded Counters in it into the room of it After he had done he says to her now han't you pick'd my Pocket she jested with him and told him she suppos'd he had not much to loose he put his Hand to his Fob and with his Fingers felt that his Purse was there which fully satisfy'd him and so she brought off his Money and this was a Trade with her she kept a sham Gold Watch that is a Watch of Silver Guilt and a Purse of Counters in her Pocket to be ready on all such Occasions and I doubt not practis'd it with Success  I CAME home with this last Booty to my Governess and really when I told her the Story it so affected her that she was hardly able to forbear Tears to think how such a Gentleman run a daily Risque of being undone every time a Glass of Wine got into his Head  BUT as to the Purchase I got and how entirely I stript him she told me it pleas'd her wonderfully nay Child  says she  the usage may for ought I know do more to reform him than all the Sermons that ever he will hear in his Life and if the remainder of the Story be true so it did  I FOUND the next Day she was wonderful inquisitive about this Gentleman the description I had given her of him his Dress his Person his Face every thing concur'd to make her think of a Gentleman whose Character she knew and Family too she mus'd a while and I going still on with the Particulars she starts up  says she  I'll lay a Hundred Pound I know the Gentleman  I AM sorry you do  says I  for I would not have him expos'd on any account in the World he has had Injury enough already by me and I would  not be instrumental to do him any more No no  says she  I will do him no Injury I assure you but you may let me satisfie my Curiosity a little for if it is he I warrant you I find it out I was a little startled at that and told her with an apparent concern in my Face that by the same Rule he might find me out and then I was undone  she return'd warmly  why do you think I will betray you Child No no  says she  not for all he is worth in the World I have kept your Counsel in worse things than these sure you may trust me in this So I said no more at that time  SHE laid her Scheme another way and without acquainting me of it but she was resolv'd to find it out if possible so she goes to a certain Friend of hers who was acquainted in the Family that she guess'd at and told her Friend she had some extraordinary business with such a Gentleman who by the way was no less than a Baronet and of a very good Family and that she knew not how to come at him without somebody to introduce her Her Friend promis'd her very readily to do it and accordingly goes to the House to see if the Gentleman was in Town  THE next Day she comes to my Governess and tells her that Sir was at Home but that he had met with a Disaster and was very ill and there was no speaking with him what Disaster  says my Governess hastily  as if she was surpriz'd at it Why  says her Friend  he had been at  Hampstead  to Visit a Gentleman of his Acquaintance and as he came back again he was set upon and Robb'd and having got a little Drink too as they suppose the Rogues abus'd him and he is very ill Robb'd  says my Governess  and what did they take from him why  says her Friend  they  took his Gold Watch and his Gold Snuffbox his fine Perriwig and what Money he had in his Pocket which was considerable to be sure for Sir never goes without a Purse of Guineas about him  PSHAW says my old Governess jeering I warrant you he has got drunk now and got a Whore and she has pick'd his Pocket and so he comes home to his Wife and tells her he has been Robb'd that's an old sham a thousand such tricks are put upon the poor Women every Day  FYE  says her Friend  I find you don't know Sir why he is as Civil a Gentleman there is not a finer Man nor a soberer grave modester Person in the whole City he abhors such things there's no Body that knows him will think such a thing of him Well well  says my Governess  that's none of my Business if it was I warrant I should find there was something of that kind in it your Modest Men in common Opinion are sometimes no better than other People only they keep a better Character or if you please are the better Hypocrites  No no  says her Friend  I can assure you Sir is no Hypocrite he is really an honest sober Gentleman and he has certainly been Robb'd Nay  says my Governess  it may be he has it is no Business of mine I tell you I only want to speak with him my Business is of another Nature but  says her Friend  let your Business be of what nature it will you cannot see him yet for he is not fit to be seen for he is very ill and bruis'd very much Ay  says my Governess  nay then he has fallen into bad Hands to be sure and then she ask'd gravely pray where is he bruised Why in his Head  says her Friend  and one of his Hands  and his Face for they us'd him barbarously Poor Gentleman  says my Governess  I must wait then till he recovers and adds I hope it will not be long for I want very much to speak with him  AWAY she comes to me and tells me this Story I have found out your fine Gentleman and a fine Gentleman he was  says she  but Mercy on him he is in a sad pickle now I wonder what the D l you have done to him why you have almost kill'd him I look'd at her with disorder enough I kill'd him  says I  you must mistake the Person I am sure I did nothing to him he was very well when I left him  said I  only drunk and fast asleep I know nothing of that  says she  but he is in a sad pickle now and so she told me all that her Friend had said to her Well then  says I  he fell into bad Hands after I left him for I am sure I left him safe enough  ABOUT ten Days after or a little more my Governess goes again to her Friend to introduce her to this Gentleman she had enquir'd other ways in the mean time and found that he was about again if not abroad again so she got leave to speak with him  SHE was a Woman of an admirable Address and wanted no Body to introduce her she told her Tale much better than I shall be able to tell it for her for she was a Mistress of her Tongue as I have said already She told him that she came tho' a Stranger with a single design of doing him a Service and he should find she had no other End in it that as she came purely on so Friendly an account she beg'd a promise from him that if he did not accept what she should officiously propose he would not take ill that she meddl'd  with what was not her Business she assur'd him that as what she had to say was a Secret that belong'd to him only so whether he accepted her offer or not it should remain a Secret to all the World unless he expos'd it himself nor should his refusing her Service in it make her so little show her Respect as to do him the least Injury so that he should be entirely at liberty to act as he thought fit  HE look'd very shy at first and said he knew nothing that related to him that requir'd much secresie that he had never done any Man any wrong and car'd not what any Body might say of him that it was no part of his Character to be unjust to any Body nor could he imagine in what any Man cou'd render him any Service but that if it was so disinterested a Service as she said he could not take it ill from any one that they should endeavour to serve him and so as it were left her at liberty either to tell him or not to tell him as she thought fit  SHE found him so perfectly indifferent that she was almost afraid to enter into the point with him but however after some other Circumlocutions she told him that by a strange and unaccountable Accident she came to have a particular knowledge of the late unhappy Adventure he had fallen into and that in such a manner that there was no Body in the World but herself and him that were acquainted with it no not the very Person that was with him  HE look'd a little angrily at first what Adventure  said he  why Sir  said she  of your being Robb'd coming from  Knightsbr Hampstead  Sir I should say  says she  be not surpris'd Sir  says she  that I am able to tell you every step you took that Day from the  Cloyster  in  Smithfield  to  the  SpringGarden  at  Knightsbridge  and thence to the in the  Strand  and how you were left asleep in the Coach afterwards I say let not this surprize you for Sir I do not come to make a Booty of you I ask nothing of you and I assure you the Woman that was with you knows nothing who you are and never shall and yet perhaps I may serve you farther still for I did not come barely to let you know that I was inform'd of these things as if I wanted a Bribe to conceal them assure your self Sir  said she  that whatever you think fit to do or say to me it shall be all a secret as it is as much as if I were in my Grave  HE was astonish'd at her Discourse and said gravely to her Madam you are a Stranger to me but it is very unfortunate that you should be let into the Secret of the worst action of my Life and a thing that I am so justly asham'd of that the only satisfaction of it to me was that I thought it was known only to God and my own Conscience Pray Sir  says she  do not reckon the Discovery of it to me to be any part of your Misfortune it was a thing I believe you were surprised into and perhaps the Woman us'd some Art to prompt you to it however you will never find any just Cause  said she  to repent that I came to hear of it nor can your own Mouth be more silent in it than I have been and ever shall be  WELL  says he  but let me do some Justice to the Woman too whoever she is I do assure you she prompted me to nothing she rather declin'd me it was my own Folly and Madness that brought me into it all ay and brought her into it too I must give her her due so far as to what she took from me I cou'd expect no less from her  in the condition I was in and to this Hour I know not whether she Robb'd me or the Coachman if she did it I forgive her and I think all Gentlemen that do so should be us'd in the same manner but I am more concern'd for some other things than I am for all that she took from me  MY Governess now began to come into the whole matter and he open'd himself freely to her first she said to him in answer to what he had said about me I am glad Sir you are so just to the Person that you were with I assure you she is a Gentlewoman and no Woman of the Town and however you prevail'd with her so far as you did I am sure 'tis not her Practise you run a great venture indeed Sir but if that be any part of your Care I am perswaded you may be perfectly easie for I dare assure you no Man has touch'd her before you since her Husband and he has been dead now almost eight Year  IT appear'd that this was his Grievance and that he was in a very great fright about it however when my Governess said this to him he appeared very well pleased and said well Madam to be plain with you if I was satisfy'd of that I should not so much value what I lost for as to that the Temptation was great and perhaps she was poor and wanted it If she had not been poor Sir  says my Governess  I assure you she would never have yielded to you▪ and as her Poverty first prevailed with her to let you do as you did so the same Poverty prevail'd with her to pay her self at last when she saw you was in such a Condition that if she had not done it perhaps the next Coachman or Chairman might have done it  WELL  says he  much good may it do her I say again all the Gentlemen that do so ought to be  us'd in the same manner and then they would be cautious of themselves I have no more concern about it but on the score which you hinted at before Madam Here he entred into some freedoms with her on the Subject of what pass'd between us which are not so proper for a Woman to write and the great Terror that was upon his Mind with relation to his Wife for fear he should have receiv'd any Injury from me and should communicate it farther and ask'd her at last if she cou'd not procure him an opportunity to speak with me my Governess gave him farther assurances of my being a Woman clear from any such thing and that he was as entirely safe in that respect as he was with his own Lady but as for seeing me she said it might be of dangerous consequence but however that she would talk with me and let him know my Answer using at the same time some Arguments to perswade him not to desire it and that it cou'd be of no Service to him seeing she hop'd he had no desire to renew a Correspondence with me and that on my account it was a kind of putting my Life in his Hands  HE told her he had a great desire to see me that he would give her any assurances that were in his Power not to take any Advantages of me and that in the first place he would give me a general release from all Demands of any kind she insisted how it might tend to a farther divulging the Secret and might in the end be injurious to him entreating him not to press for it so at length he desisted  THEY had some Discourse upon the Subject of the things he had lost and he seem'd to be very desirous of his Gold Watch and told her if she cou'd procure that for him he would willingly give as  much for it as it was worth she told him she would endeavour to procure it for him and leave the valuing it to himself  ACCORDINGLY the next Day she carried the Watch and he gave her Guineas for it which was more than I should have been able to make of it tho' it seems it cost much more he spoke something of his Perriwig which it seems cost him threescore Guineas and his Snuffbox and in a few Days more she carried them too which oblig'd him very much and he gave her Thirty more the next Day I sent him his fine Sword and Cane  Gratis  and demanded nothing of him but I had no mind to see him unless it had been so that he might be satisfy'd I knew who he was which he was not willing to  THEN he entered into a long Tale with her of the manner how she came to know all this matter she form'd a long Talk of that part how she had it from one that I had told the whole Story to and that was to help me dispose of the Goods and this Confident brought the Things to her she being by Profession a  PawnBroker  and she hearing of his Worship's dissaster guess'd at the thing in general that having gotten the Things into her Hands she had resolv'd to come and try as she had done She then gave him repeated Assurances that it should never go out of her Mouth and tho' she knew the Woman very well yet she had not let her know  meaning me  any thing of it  that is to say  who the Person was which by the way was false but however it was not to his Damage for I never open'd my Mouth of it to any Body  I HAD a great many Thoughts in my Head about my seeing him again and was often sorry that I had refus'd it I was perswaded that if I had seen him and let him know that I knew him I should have made some Advantage of him and perhaps have had some Maintenance from him and tho' it was a Life wicked enough yet it was not so full of Danger as this I was engag'd in However those Thoughts wore off and I declin'd seeing him again for that time but my Governess saw him often and he was very kind to her giving her something almost every time he saw her one time in particular she found him very Merry and as she thought he had some Wine in his Head and he press'd her again very earnestly to let him see that Woman that  as he said  had Betwitch'd him so that Night my Governess who was from the beginning for my seeing him told him he was so desirous of it that she could almost yield to it if she cou'd prevail upon me adding that if he would please to come to her House in the Evening she would endeavour it upon his repeated Assurances of forgetting what was pass'd  ACCORDINGLY she came to me and told me all the Discourse  in short  she soon byass'd me to consent in a Case which I had some regret in my mind for declining before so I prepar'd to see him I dress'd me to all the Advantage possible I assure you and for the first time us'd a little Art I say for the first time for I had never yielded to the baseness of Paint before having always had vanity enough to believe I had no need of it  AT the Hour appointed he came and as she observ'd before so it was plain still that he had been drinking tho' very far from what we call  being in drink He appear'd exceeding pleas'd to see me and enter'd into a long Discourse with me upon the old Affair I beg'd his pardon very often for my share of it protested I had not any such design when first I met him that I had not gone out with him but that I took him for a very civil Gentleman and that he made me so many promises of offering no uncivility to me  HE alledg'd the Wine he drank and that he scarce knew what he did and that if it had not been so I should never have let him take the freedom with me that he had done He protested to me that he never touch'd any Woman but me since he was married to his Wife and it was a surprise upon him Complimented me upon being so particularly agreeable to him and the like and talk'd so much of that kind till I found he had talk'd himself almost into a temper to do the same thing over again But I took him up short I protested I had never suffer'd any Man to touch me since my Husband died which was near eight Year he said he believed it to be so truly and added that Madam had intimated as much to him and that it was his Opinion of that part which made him desire to see me again and that since he had once broke in upon his Vertue with me and found no ill Consequences he cou'd be safe in venturing there again and so in short it went on to what I expected and to what will not bear relating  MY old Governess had foreseen it as well as I and therefore led him into a Room which had not a Bed in it and yet had a Chamber within it which had a Bed whether we withdrew for the rest of the Night and in short after some time being together he went to Bed and lay there all Night  I withdrew but came again undress'd in the Morning before it was Day and lay with him the rest of the time  THUS you see having committed a Crime once is a sad Handle to the committing of it again whereas all the Regret and Reflections wear off when the Temptation renews it self had I not yielded to see him again the Corrupt desire in him had worn off and 'tis very probable he had never fallen into it with any Body else as I really believe he had not done before  WHEN he went away I told him I hop'd he was satisfy'd he had not been robb'd again he told me he was satisfy'd in that Point and cou'd trust me again and putting his Hand in his Pocket gave me five Guineas which was the first Money I had gain'd that way for many Years  I HAD several Visits of the like kind from him but he never came into a settled way of Maintenance which was what I would have been best pleas'd with Once indeed he ask'd me how I did to live I answer'd him pretty quick that I assur'd him I had never taken that Course that I took with him but that indeed I work'd at my Needle and could just Maintain myself that sometimes it was as much as I was able to do and I shifted hard enough  HE seem'd to reflect upon himself that he should be the first Person to lead me into that which he assur'd me he never intended to do himself and it touch'd him a little  he said  that he should be the Cause of his own Sin and mine too He would often make just Reflections also upon the Crime itself and upon the particular Circumstances of it with respect to himself how Wine introduc'd the Inclinations how the Devil led him to the  Place and found out an Object to tempt him and he made the Moral always himself  WHEN these thoughts were upon him he would go away and perhaps not come again in a Months time or longer but then as the serious part wore off the lewd Part would wear in and then he came prepar'd for the wick'd Part thus we liv'd for sometime tho' he did not KEEP as they call it yet he never fail'd doing things that were Handsome and sufficient to Maintain me without working and which was better without following my old Trade  BUT this Affair had its End too for after about a Year I found that he did not come so often as usual and at last he left it off altogether without any dislike or bidding adieu and so there was an End of that short Scene of Life which added no great Store to me only to make more Work for Repentance  HOWEVER during this interval I confin'd my self pretty much at Home at least being thus provided for I made no Adventures no not for a Quarter of a Year after he left me but then finding the Fund fail and being loth to spend upon the main Stock I began to think of my old Trade and to look Abroad into the Street again and my first Step was lucky enough  I HAD dress'd myself up in a very mean Habit for as I had several Shapes to appear in I was now in an ordinary StuffGown a blue Apron and a StrawHat and I plac'd myself at the Door of the three CupsInn in St  John Street  There were several Carriers us'd the Inn and the Stage Coaches for  Barnet  for  Toteridge  and other Towns that way stood always in the Street in the Evening when they prepar'd to set out so that I  was ready for any thing that offer'd for either one or other The meaning was this People come frequently with Bundles and small Parcels to those Inns and call for such Carriers or Coaches as they want to carry them into the Country and there generally attends Women Porters Wives or Daughters ready to take in such things for their respective People that employ them  IT happen'd very odly that I was standing at the InnGate and a Woman that had stood there before and which was the Porter's Wife belonging to the  Barnet  Stage Coach having observ'd me ask'd if I waited for any of the Coaches I told her yes I waited for my Mistress that was coming to go to  Barnet  she ask'd me who was my Mistress and I told her any Madam's Name that came next me but as it seem'd I happen'd upon a Name a Family of which Name liv'd at  Hadly  just beyond  Barnet    I SAID no more to her or she to me a good while but by and by some body calling her at a Door a little way off she desir'd me that if any body call'd for the  Barnet  Coach I would step and call her at the House which it seems was an Alehouse I said yes very readily and away she went  SHE was no sooner gone but comes a Wench and a Child puffing and sweating and asks for the  Barnet  Coach I answer'd presently  Here  do you belong to the  Barnet  Coach  says she  yes Sweetheart  said I  what do ye want I want Room for two Passengers  says she  Where are they Sweetheart  said I  Here's this Girl pray let her go into the Coach  says she  and I'll go and fetch my Mistress make hast then Sweetheart  says I  for we may be full else the Maid had a great  Bundle under Arm so she put the Child into the Coach and  I said  you had best put your Bundle into the Coach too No  says she  I am afraid some body should slip it away from the Child give it me then  said I  and I'll take care of it do then  says she  and be sure you take care of it I'll answer for it  said I  if it were for Twenty Pound value There take it then  says she  and away she goes  As soon as I had got the Bundle and the Maid was out of Sight I goes on towards the Alehouse where the Porter's Wife was so that if I had met her I had then only been going to give her the Bundle and to call her to her Business as if I was going away and cou'd stay no longer but as I did not meet her I walk'd away and turning into  CharterhouseLane  made off thro'  CharterhouseYard  into  LongLane  then cross'd into  BartholomewClose  so into  LittleBritain  and thro' the  BlueCoatHospital  into  NewgateStreet    TO prevent my being known I pull'd off my blue Apron and wrapt the Bundle in it which before was made up in a Piece of painted Callico and very Remarkble I also wrapt up my StrawHat in it and so put the Bundle upon my Head and it was very well that I did thus for coming thro' the  BlueCoatHospital  who should I meet but the Wench that had given me the Bundle to hold it seems she was going with her Mistress who she had been gone to fetch to the  Barnet  Coaches  I SAW she was in hast and I had no Business to stop her so away she went and I brought my Bundle safe Home to my Governess there was no Money nor Plate or Jewels in the Bundle but a very good Suit of  Indian  Damask a Gown and Petticoat a lac'd Head and Ruffles of very  good FlandersLace and some Linnen and other things such as I knew very well the value of  THIS was not indeed my own Invention but was given me by one that had practis'd it with Success and my Governess lik'd it extreamly and indeed I try'd it again several times tho' never twice near the same Place for the next time I try'd it in  WhiteChappel  just by the Corner of  PettyCoatLane  where the Coaches stand that go out to  Stratford  and  Bow  and that Side of the Country and another time at the  FlyingHorse  without  Bishopsgate  where the  Cheston  Coaches then lay and I had always the good Luck to come off with some Booty  ANOTHER time I plac'd myself at a Warehouse by the Waterside where the Coasting Vessels from the  North  come such as from  NewCastle  upon  Tyne Sunderland  and other Places here the Warehouse being shut comes a young Fellow with a Letter and he wanted a Box and a Hamper that was come from  NewCastle  upon  Tyne  I ask'd him if he had the Marks of it so he shows me the Letter by Vertue of which he was to ask for it and which gave an Account of the Contents the Box being full of Linnen and the Hamper full of GlassWare I read the Letter and took care to see the Name and the Marks the Name of the Person that sent the Goods the Name of the Person that they were sent to then I bad the Messenger come in the Morning for that the Warehouse Keeper would not be there any more that Night  AWAY went I and getting Materials in a publick House I wrote a Letter from Mr  John Richardson  of  NewCastle  to his Dear Cousin  Jemey Cole  in  London  with an Account that he had sent  by such a Vessel for I remember'd all the Particulars to a tittle so many pieces of Huckaback Linnen so many Ells of  Dutch  Holland and the like in a Box and a Hamper of Flint Glasses from Mr  Henzill  's Glasshouse and that the Box was mark'd IC No I and the Hamper was directed by a Label on the Cording  ABOUT an Hour after I came to the Warehouse found the Warehousekeeper and had the Goods deliver'd me without any scruple the value of the Linnen being about Pound  I COULD fill up this whole Discourse with the variety of such Adventures which daily Invention directed to and which I manag'd with the utmost Dexterity and always with Success  AT length as when does the Pitcher come safe home that goes so very often to the Well I fell into some small Broils which tho' they cou'd not affect me fatally yet made me known which was the worst thing next to being found Guilty that cou'd befall me  I HAD taken up the Disguise of a Widow's Dress it was without any real design in view but only waiting for any thing that might offer as I often did It happen'd that while I was going along the Street in  CoventGarden  there was a great Cry of stop Thief stop Thief some Artists had it seems put a trick upon a Shopkeeper and being pursued some of them fled one way and some another and one of them was they said dress'd up in Widow's Weeds upon which the Mob gathered about me and some said I was the Person others said no immediately came the Mercer's Journeman and he swore aloud I was the Person and so seiz'd on me however when I was brought back by the Mob to the Mercer's Shop the Master of the  House said freely that I was not the Woman that was in his Shop and would have let me go immediately but another Fellow said gravely pray stay till Mr  meaning the Journeyman  comes back for he knows her so they kept me by force near half an Hour they had call'd a Constable and he stood in the Shop as my Jayler and in talking with the Constable I enquir'd where he liv'd and what Trade he was the Man not apprehending in the least what happened afterwards readily told me his Name and Trade and where he liv'd and told me as a Jest that I might be sure to hear of his Name when I came to the  Old Bayley  SOME of the Servants likewise us'd me saucily and had much ado to keep their Hands off of me the Master indeed was civiler to me than they but he would not yet let me go tho' he owned he could not say I was in his Shop before  I BEGAN to be a little surly with him and told him I hop'd he would not take it ill if I made my self amends upon him in a more legal way another time and desir'd I might send for Friends to see me have right done me No  he said  he could give no such liberty I might ask it when I came before the Justice of Peace and seeing I threaten'd him he would take care of me in the mean time and would lodge me safe in  Newgate  I told him it was his time now but it would be mine by and by and govern'd my Passion as well as I was able however I spoke to the Constable to call me a Porter which he did and then I call'd for Pen Ink and Paper but they would let me have none I ask'd the Porter his Name and where he liv'd and the poor Man told it me very willingly I bad him observe and remember how I was treated there that he saw I was detain'd  there by Force I told him I should want his Evidence in another place and it should not be the worse for him to speak the Porter said he would serve me with all his Heart but Madam  says he  let me hear them refuse to let you go then I may be able to speak the plainer  WITH that I spoke aloud to the Master of the Shop and said Sir you know in your own Conscience that I am not the Person you look for and that I was not in your Shop before therefore I demand that you detain me here no longer or tell me the reason of your stopping me the Fellow grew surlier upon this than before and said he would do neither till he thought fit very well said I to the Constable and to the Porter you will be pleas'd to remember this Gentlemen another time the Porter said  yes Madam  and the Constable began not to like it and would have perswaded the Mercer to dismiss him and let me go since as he said he own'd I was not the Person Good Sir  says the Mercer to him Tauntingly  are you a Justice of Peace or a Constable I charg'd you with her pray do you do your Duty The Constable told him a little mov'd but very handsomely  I know my Duty and what I am Sir I doubt you hardly know what you are doing  they had some other hard words and in the mean time the Journeymen impudent and unmanly to the last degree used me barbarously and one of them the same that first seized upon me pretended he would search me and began to lay Hands on me I spit in his Face call'd out to the Constable and bad him take notice of my usage and pray Mr Constable  said I  ask that Villain's Name pointing to the Man the Constable reprov'd him decently told him that he did not know what he  did for he knew that his Master acknowledg'd I was not the Person that was in his Shop and says the Constable I am afraid your Master is bringing himself and me too into Trouble if this Gentlewoman comes to prove who she is and where she was and it appears that she is not the Woman you pretend to Dam her  says the Fellow again  with an impudent harden'd Face she is the Lady you may depend upon it I'll swear she is the same Body that was in the Shop and that I gave the pieces of Satin that is lost into her own hand you shall hear more of it when Mr  William  and  Anthony those were other Journeymen  come back they will know her again as well as I  JUST as the insolent Rogue was talking thus to the Constable comes back Mr  William  and Mr  Anthony  as he call'd them and a great Rabble with them bringing along with them the true Widow that I was pretended to be and they came sweating and blowing into the Shop and with a great deal of Triumph dragging the poor Creature in a most butcherly manner up towards their Master who was in the back Shop and cryed out aloud here's the Widow Sir we have catch'd her at last what do ye mean by that  says the Master  why we have her already there she sits  says he  and Mr  says he  can swear this is she The other Man who they call'd Mr  Anthony  replyed Mr may say what he will and swear what he will but this is the Woman and there's the Remnant of Sattin she stole I took it out of her Cloaths with my own Hand  I SAT still now and began to take a better Heart but smil'd and said nothing the Master look'd Pale the Constable turn'd about and look'd at me  let 'em alone Mr Constable  said I  let 'em go on  the Case was plain and could not be denied so the Constable was charg'd with the right Thief and the Mercer told me very civily he was sorry for the mistake and hoped I would not take it ill that they had so many things of this nature put upon them every Day that they cou'd not be blam'd for being very sharp in doing themselves Justice Not take it ill Sir  said I  how can I take it well if you had dismiss'd me when your insolent Fellow seiz'd on me in the Street and brought me to you and when you your self acknowledg'd I was not the Person I would have put it by and not taken it ill because of the many ill things I believe you have put upon you daily but your Treatment of me since has been unsufferable and especially that of your Servant I must and will have Reparation for that  THEN he began to parly with me said he would make me any reasonable Satisfaction and would fain have had me told him what it was I expected I told him I should not be my own Judge the Law should decide it for me and as I was to be carried before a Magistrate I should let him hear there what I had to say he told me there was no occasion to go before the Justice now I was at liberty to go where I pleased and so calling to the Constable told him he might let me go for I was discharg'd the Constable said calmly to him Sir you ask'd me just now if I knew whether I was a Constable or a Justice and bad me do my Duty and charg'd me with this Gentlewoman as a Prisoner now Sir I find you do not understand what is my Duty for you would make me a Justice indeed but I must tell you it is not in my Power I may keep a Prisoner when I am charg'd with him but 'tis the Law and the Magistrate alone  that can discharge that Prisoner therefore 'tis a mistake Sir I must carry her before a Justice now whether you think well of it or not The Mercer was very high with the Constable at first but the Constable happening to be not a hir'd Officer but a good Substantial kind of Man I think he was a Cornchandler and a Man of good Sense stood to his Business would not discharge me without going to a Justice of the Peace and I insisted upon it too When the Mercer see that well  says he to the Constable  you may carry her where you please I have nothing to say to her but Sir  says the Constable  you will go with us I hope for 'tis you that charg'd me with her no not I  says the Mercer  I tell you I have nothing to say to her But pray Sir do  says the Constable  I desire it of you for your own sake for the Justice can do nothing without you Prithee Fellow  says the Mercer  go about your Business I tell you I have nothing to say to the Gentlewoman I charge you in the King's Name to dismiss her Sir  says the Constable  I find you don't know what it is to be a Constable I beg of you don't oblige me to be rude to you I think I need not you are rude enough already  says the Mercer  No Sir  says the Constable  I am not rude you have broken the Peace in bringing an honest Woman out of the Street when she was about her lawful Occasion confining her in your Shop and ill using her here by your Servants and now can you say I am rude to you I think I am civil to you in not commanding or charging you in the King's Name to go with me and charging every Man I see that passes your Door to aid and assist me in carrying you by Force this you cannot but know I have power to do and yet I forbear it and once  more entreat you to go with me Well he would not for all this and gave the Constable ill Language However the Constable kept his Temper and would not be provoked and then I put in and said come Mr Constable let him alone I shall find ways enough to fetch him before a Magistrate I don't fear that but there's the Fellow  says I  he was the Man that seized on me as I was innocently going along the Street and you are a Witness of his Violence with me since give me leave to charge you with him and carry him before the Justice yes Madam  says the Constable  and turning to the Fellow come young Gentleman  says he to the Journeyman  you must go along with us I hope you are not above the Constable's Power tho' your Master is  THE Fellow look'd like a condemn'd Thief and hung back then look'd at his Master as if he cou'd help him and he like a Fool encourag'd the Fellow to be rude and he truly resisted the Constable and push'd him back with a good Force when he went to lay hold on him at which the Constable knock'd him down and call'd out for help and immediately the Shop was fill'd with People and the Constable seiz'd the Master and Man and all his Servants  THE first ill Consequence of this Fray was that the Woman they had taken who was really the Thief made off and got clear away in the Crowd and two others that they had stop'd also whether they were really Guilty or not that I can say nothing to  BY this time some of his Neighbours having come in and upon inquiry seeing how things went had endeavour'd to bring the hotbrain'd Mercer to his Senses and he began to be convinc'd  that he was in the wrong and so at length we went all very quietly before the Justice with a Mob of about People at our Heels and all the way I went I could hear the People ask what was the matter and others reply and say a Mercer had stop'd a Gentlewoman instead of a Thief and had afterwards taken the Thief and now the Gentlewoman had taken the Mercer and was carrying him before the Justice this pleas'd the People strangely and made the Crowd encrease and they cry'd out as they went which is the Rogue which is the Mercer and especially the Women then when they saw him they cryed out  that's he that's he  and every now and then came a good dab of Dirt at him and thus we march'd a good while till the Mercer thought fit to desire the Constable to call a Coach to protect himself from the Rabble so we Rode the rest of the way the Constable and I and the Mercer and his Man  WHEN we came to the Justice which was an ancient Gentleman in  Bloomsbury  the Constable giving first a summary account of the Matter the Justice bad me speak and tell what I had to say and first he asked my Name which I was very loath to give but there was no remedy so I told him my Name was  Mary Flanders  that I was a Widow my Husband being a Sea Captain dyed on a Voyage to  Virginia  and some other Circumstances I told which he cou'd never contradict and that I lodg'd at present in Town with such a Person naming my Governess but that I was preparing to go over to  America  where my Husband's Effects lay and that I was going that Day to buy some Cloaths to put my self into second Mourning but had not yet been in any Shop when that Fellow pointing to the Mercer's  Journeyman came rushing upon me with such fury as very much frighted me and carried me back to his Masters Shop where tho' his Master acknowledg'd I was not the Person yet he would not dismiss me but charg'd a Constable with me  THEN I proceeded to tell how the Journeyman treated me how they would not suffer me to send for any of my Friends how afterwards they found the real Thief and took the very Goods they had Lost upon her and all the particulars as before  THEN the Constable related his Case his Dialogue with the  Mercer  about Discharging me and at last his Servants refusing to go with him when he had Charg'd him with him and his Master encouraging him to do so and at last his striking the Constable and the like all as I have told it already  THE Justice then heard the  Mercer  and his Man the  Mercer  indeed made a long Harangue of the great loss they have daily by Lifters and Thieves that it was easy for them to Mistake and that when he found it he would have dismiss'd me  c  as above as to the Journeyman he had very little to say but that he pretended other of the Servants told him that I was really the Person  UPON the whole the Justice first of all told me very courteously I was Discharg'd that he was very sorry that the  Mercers  Man should in his eager pursuit have so little Discretion as to take up an innocent Person for a guilty Person that if he had not been so unjust as to detain me afterward he believ'd I would have forgiven the first Affront that however it was not in his Power to award me any Reparation for any thing other than by openly reproving them which he  should do but he suppos'd I would apply to such Methods as the Law directed in the mean time he would bind him over  BUT as to the Breach of the Peace committed by the Journeyman he told me he should give me some satisfaction for that for he should commit him to  Newgate  for Assaulting the Constable and for Assaulting of me also  ACCORDINGLY he sent the Fellow to  Newgate  for that Assault and his Master gave Bail and so we came away but I had the satisfaction of seeing the Mob wait upon them both as they came out Holooing and throwing Stones and Dirt at the Coaches they rod in and so I came Home to my Governess  AFTER this hustle coming home and telling my Governess the Story she falls a Laughing at me Why are you merry  says I  the Story has not so much Laughing room in it as you imagine I am sure I have had a great deal of Hurry and Fright too with a Pack of ugly Rogues  Laugh  says my Governess I laugh Child to see what a lucky Creature you are why this Jobb will be the best Bargain to you that ever you made in your Life if you manage it well I warrant you  says she  you shall make the  Mercer  pay you  l  for Damages besides what you shall get of the Journeyman  I HAD other Thoughts of the Matter than she had and especially because I had given in my Name to the Justice of Peace and I knew that my Name was so well known among the People at  Hicks  's  Hall  the  Old Baily  and such Places that if this Cause came to be tryed openly and my Name came to be enquir'd into no Court would give much Damages for the Reputation of  a Person of such a Character however I was oblig'd to begin a Prosecution in Form and accordingly my Governess found me out a very creditable sort of a Man to manage it being an Attorney of very good Business and of good Reputation and she was certainly in the right of this for had she employ'd a petty Fogging hedge Soliciter or a Man not known and not in good Reputation I should have brought it to but little  I MET this Attorney and gave him all the particulars at large as they are recited above and he assur'd me it was a Case  as he said  that would very well support itself and that he did not Question but that a Jury would give very considerable Damages on such an Occasion so taking his full Instructions he began the Prosecution and the  Mercer  being Arrested gave Bail a few Days after his giving Bail he Comes with his Attorney to my Attorney to let him know that he desir'd to Accommodate the matter that it was all carried on in the Heat of an unhappy Passion that his Client  meaning me  had a sharp provoking Tongue that I us'd them ill gibbing at them and jeering them even while they belived me to be the very Person and that I had provok'd them and the like  MY Attorney manag'd as well on my Side made them believe I was a Widow of Fortune that I was able to do myself Justice and had great Friends to stand by me too who had all made me promise to Sue to the utmost and that if it cost me a Thousand Pound  I  would be sure to have satisfaction for that the Affronts I had receiv'd were unsufferable  HOWEVER they brought my Attorney to this that he promis'd he would not blow the Coals  that if I enclin'd to an Accommodation he would not hinder me and that he would rather perswade me to Peace than to War for which they told him he should be no looser all which he told me very honestly and told me that if they offer'd him any Bribe I should certainly know it but upon the whole he told me very honestly that if I would take his Opinion he would Advise me to make it up with them for that as they were in a great Fright and were desirous above all things to make it up and knew that let it be what it would they would be alotted to bear all the Costs of the Suit he believ'd they would give me freely more than any Jury or Court of Justice would give upon a Trial I ask'd him what he thought they would be brought to he told me he could not tell as to that but he would tell me more when I saw him again  SOME time after this they came again to know if he had talk'd with me He told them he had that he found me not so Averse to an Accommodation as some of my Friends were who resented the Disgrace offer'd me and set me on that they blow'd the Coals in secret prompting me to Revenge or to do myself Justice as they call'd it so that he could not tell what to say to it he told them he would do his endeavour to persuade me but he ought to be able to tell me what Proposal they made They pretended they could not make any Proposal because it might be made use of against them and he told them that by the same Rule he could not make any offers for that might be pleaded in Abatement of what Damages a Jury might be inclin'd to give However after some Discourse  and mutual Promises that no Advantage should be taken on either Side by what was transacted then or at any other of those Mettings they came to a kind of a Treaty but so remote and so wide from one another that nothing could be expected from it for my Attorney demmanded  l  and Charges and they offer'd  l  without Charges so they broke off and the  Mercer  propos'd to have a Meeting with me myself and my Attorney agreed to that very readily  MY Attorney gave me Notice to come to this Meeting in good Cloaths and with some State that the  Mercer  might see I was something more than I seem'd to be that time they had me Accordingly I came in a new Suit of second Mourning according to what I had said at the Justices I set myself out too as well as a Widows dress in second Mourning would admit my Governess also furnish'd me with a good Pearl Necklace that shut in behind with a Locket of Diamonds which she had in Pawn and I had a very good gold Watch by my Side so that in a Word I made a very good Figure and as I stay'd till I was sure they were come I came in a Coach to the Door with my Maid with me  WHEN I came into the Room the  Mercer  was surpriz'd he stood up and made his Bow which I took a little Notice of and but a little and went and Sat down where my own Attorney had pointed to me to sit for it was his House after a little while the  Mercer  said he did not know me again and began to make some Compliments his way I told him I believe he did not know me at first and that if he had I believ'd he would not have treated me as he did  HE told me was very sorry for what had happen'd and that it was to testifie the willingness he had to make all possible Reparation that he had appointed this Meeting that he hop'd I would not carry things to extremity which might be not only too great a Loss to him but might be the ruin of his Business and Shop in which Case I might have the satisfaction of repaying an Injury with an Injury ten times greater but that I would then get nothing whereas he was willing to do me any Justice that was in his Power without putting himself or me to the Trouble or Charge of a Suit at Law  I TOLD him I was glad to hear him talk so much more like a Man of Sense than he did before that it was true acknowledgement in most Cases of Affronts was counted Reparation sufficient but this had gone too far to be made up so that I was not Revengeful nor did I seek his Ruin or any Mans else but that all my Friends were unanimous not to let me so far neglect my Character as to adjust a thing of this kind without a sufficient Reparation of Honour That to be taken up for a Thief was such an Indignity as could not be put up that my Character was above being treated so by any that knew me but because in my Condition of a Widow I had been for sometime Careless of myself and Negligent of myself I might be taken for such a Creature but that for the particular usage I had from him afterward and then I repeated all as before it was so provoking I had scarce Patience to repeat it  WELL he acknowledg'd all and was mighty humble indeed he made Proposals very handsome he came up to a Hundred Pounds and to pay all the Law Charges and added that he would make me a Present of a very good Suit of Cloths  I came down to three Hundred Pounds and I demanded that I should publish an Advertisement of the particulars in the common News Papers  THIS was a Clause he never could comply with however at last he came up by good Management of my Attorney to  l  and a Suit of black silk Cloaths and there I agreed and as it were at my Attornies request complied with it he paying my Attornies Bill and Charges and gave us a good Supper into the Bargain  WHEN I came to receive the Money I brought my Governess with me dress'd like an old Dutchess and a Gentleman very well dress'd who we pretended Courted me but I call'd him Cousin and the Lawyer was only to hint privately to him that this Gentleman Courted the Widow  HE treated us handsomely indeed and paid the Money chearfully enough so that it cost him  l  in all or rather more At our last Meeting when all was agreed the Case of the Journeyman came up and the  Mercer  beg'd very hard for him told me he was a Man that had kept a Shop of his own and been in good Business had a Wife and several Children and was very poor that he had nothing to make satisfaction with but he should come to beg my pardon on his Knees if I desir'd it as openly as I pleas'd I had no Spleen at the sawcy Rogue nor were his Submissions any thing to me since there was nothing to be got by him so I thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not so I told him I did not desire the Ruin of any Man and therefore at his Request I would forgive the Wretch it was below me to seek any Revenge  WHEN we were at Supper he brought the poor Fellow in to make acknowledgement which he  would have done with as much mean Humility as his Offence was with insulting Haughtiness and Pride in which he was an Instance of a compleat baseness of Spirit impious cruelter and relentless when Uppermost and in Prosperity abject and low Spirited when Down in Affliction However I abated his Cringes told him I forgave him and desir'd he might withdraw as if I did not care for the sight of him tho' I had forgiven him  I WAS now in good Circumstances indeed if I could have known my time for leaving off and my Governess often said I was the richest of the Trade in  England  and so I believe I was for I had  l  by me in Money besides Cloaths Rings some Plate and two gold Watches and all of them stol'n for I had innumerable Jobbs besides these I have mention'd O had I even now had the Grace of Repentance I had still leisure to have look'd back upon my Follies and have made some Reparation but the satisfaction I was to make for the publick Mischiefs I had done was yet left behind and I could not forbear going Abroad again  as I call'd it now  than any more I could when my Extremity really drove me out for Bread  IT was not long after the Affair with the  Mercer  was made up that I went out in an Equipage quite different from any I had ever appear'd in before I dress'd myself like a Beggar Woman in the coursest and most despicable Rags I could get and I walk'd about peering and peeping into every Door and Window I came near and indeed I was in such a Plight now that I knew as ill how to behave in as ever I did in any I naturally abhorr'd Dirt and Rags I had been bred up Tite and Cleanly and could be no other whatever Condition I was in so that this was the most  uneasie Disguise to me that ever I put on I said presently to myself that this would not do for this was a Dress that every body was shy and afraid of and I thought every body look'd at me as if they were afraid I should come near them least I should take something from them or afraid to come near me least they should get something from me I wandered about all the Evening the first time I went out and made nothing of it but came home again wet draggl'd and tired However I went out again the next Night and then I met with a little Adventure which had like to have cost me dear as I was standing near a Tavern Door there comes a Gentleman on Horse back and lights at the Door and wanting to go into the Tavern he calls one of the Drawers to hold his Horse he stay'd prety long in the Tavern and the Drawer heard his Master call and thought he would be angry with him seeing me stand by him when he call'd to me here Woman  says he  hold this Horse a while till I go in if the Gentleman comes he'll give you something  yes says I  and takes the Horse and walks off with him very soberly and carri'd him to my Governess  THIS had been a Booty to those that had understood it but never was poor Thief more at a loss to know what to do with any thing that was stolen for when I came home my Governess was quite confounded and what to do with the Creature we neither of us knew to send him to a Stable was doing nothing for it was certain that publick Notice would be given in the  Gazette  and the Horse describ'd so that we durst not go to fetch it again  ALL the remedy we had for this unlucky Adventure was to go and set up the Horse at an Inn and send a Note by a Porter to the Tavern that the Gentleman's Horse that was lost such a time was left at such an Inn and that he might be had there that the poor Woman that held him having led him about the Street not being able to lead him back again had left him there we might have waited till the owner had publish'd and offer'd a Reward but we did not care to venture the receiving the Reward  SO this was a Robbery and no Robbery for little was lost by it and nothing was got by it and I was quite Sick of going out in a Beggar's dress it did not answer at all and besides I thought it was Ominous and Threatning  WHILE I was in this Disguise I fell in with a parcel of Folks of a worse kind than any I ever sorted with and I saw a little into their ways too these were Coiners of Money and they made some very good offers to me as to profit but the part they would have had me have embark'd in was the most dangerous Part I mean that of the very working the Dye as they call it which had I been taken had been certain Death and that at a Stake  I say  to be burnt to Death at a Stake so that tho' I was to Appearance but a Beggar and they promis'd Mountains of Gold and Silver to me to engage yet it would not do it is True if I had been really a Beggar or had been desperate as when I began I might perhaps have clos'd with it for what care they to Die that can't tell how to Live But at present this was not my Condition at least I was for no such terrible Risques as those besides the very Thoughts of being burnt at a Stake struck terror into my very Soul chill'd my  Blood and gave me the Vapours to such a degree as I could not think of it without trembling  THIS put an End to my Disguise too for as I did not like the Proposal so I did not tell them so but seem'd to relish it and promis'd to meet again but I durst see them no more for if I had seen them and not complied tho' I had declin'd it with the greatest assurances of Secresy in the World they would have gone near to have murther'd me to make sure Work and make themselves easy  as they call it  what kind of easiness that is they may best Judge that understand how easy Men are that can Murther People to prevent Danger  THIS and Horse stealing were things quite out of my way and I might easily resolve I would have no more to say to them my business seem'd to lye another way and tho' it had hazard enough in it too yet it was more suitable to me and what had more of Art in it more room to Escape and more Chances for a coming off if a a Surprize should happen  I HAD several Proposals made also to me about that time to come into a Gang of HouseBreakers but that was a thing I had no mind to venture at neither any more than I had at the Coining Trade I offer'd to go along with two Men and a Woman that made it their Business to get into Houses by Stratagem and with them I was willing enough to venture but there was three of them already and they did not care to part nor I to have too many in a Gang so I did not close with them but declin'd them and they paid dear for their next Attempt  BUT at length I met with a Woman that had ofen told me what Adventures she had made and with Success at the Waterside and I clos'd with her and we drove on our Business pretty well One Day we came among some  Dutch  People at St  Catherines  where we went on pretence to buy Goods that were privately got on Shore I was two or three times in a House where we saw a good Quantity of prohibited Goods and my Companion once brought away three Peices of  Dutch  black Silk that turn'd to good Account and I had my Share of it but in all the Journeys I made by myself I could not get an Opportunity to do any thing so I laid it aside for I had been so often that they began to suspect something and were so shy that I saw nothing was to be done  THIS baulk'd me a little and I resolv'd to push at something or other for I was not us'd to come back so often without Purchase so the next Day I dress'd myself up fine and took a Walk to the other End of the Town I pass'd thro' the  Exchange  in the  Strand  but had no Notion of finding any thing to do there when on a sudden I saw a great Clutter in the Place and all the People Shopkeepers as well as others standing up and staring and what should it be but some great Dutchess come into the  Exchange  and they said the Queen was coming I set myself close up to a Shopside with my back to the Compter as if to let the Crowd pass by when keeping my Eye upon a parcel of Lace which the Shopkeeper was showing to some Ladies that stood by me the Shopkeeper and her Maid were so taken up with looking to see who was a coming and what Shop they would go to that I found means to slip a Paper of Lace into my Pocket and come clear off  with it so the Lady Millener paid dear enough for her gaping after the Queen  I WENT off from the Shop as if driven along by the Throng and mingling myself with the Crowd went out at the other Door of the  Exchange  and so got away before they miss'd their Lace and because I would not be follow'd I call'd a Coach and shut myself up in it I had scarse shut the Coach Doors up but I saw the Milleners Maid and five or six more come running out into the Street and crying out as if they were frighted they did not cry stop Thief because no body ran away but I cou'd hear the Word robb'd and Lace two or three times and saw the Wench wringing her Hands and run staring too and again like one scar'd the Coachman that had taken me up was getting up into the Box but was not quite up so that the Horses had not begun to move so that I was terrible uneasy and I took the Packet of Lace and laid it ready to have dropt it out at the Flap of the Coach which opens before just behind the Coachman but to my great satisfaction in less then a Minute the Coach began to move that is to say as soon as the Coachman had got up and spoken to his Horses so he drove away without any interruption and I brought off my Purchase which was worth near twenty Pound  THE next Day I dress'd me up again but in quite different Cloths and walk'd the same way again but nothing offer'd till I came into St  James  's  Park  where I saw abundance of fine Ladies in the  Park  walking in the  Mall  and among the rest there was a little Miss a young Lady of about or Years old and she had a Sister as I suppose it was with her that might be about  Nine Year old I observ'd the biggest had a fine gold Watch on and a good Necklace of Pearl and they had a Footman in Livery with them but as it is not usual for the Footmen to go behind the Ladies in the  Mall  so I observ'd the Footman stop'd at their going into the  Mall  and the biggest of the Sisters spoke to him which I perceiv'd was to bid him be just there when they came back  WHEN I heard her dismiss the Footman I step'd up to him and ask'd him what little Lady that was and held a little Chat with him about what a pretty Child it was with her and how Genteel and well Carriag'd the Lady the eldest would be how Womanish and how Grave and the Fool of a Fellow told me presently who she was that she was Sir  Thomas  's eldest Daughter of  Essex  and that she was a great Fortune that her Mother was not come to Town yet but she was with Sir  William  's Lady of  Suffolk  at her Lodgings in  Suffolk Street  and a great deal more that they had a Maid and a Woman to wait on them besides Sir  Thomas  's Coach the Coachman and himself and that young Lady was Governess to the whole Family as well here as at Home too and in short told me abundance of things enough for my business  I WAS very well dress'd and had my gold Watch as well as she so I left the Footman and I puts myself in a Rank with this young Lady having stay'd till she had taken one double Turn in the  Mall  and was going forward again by and by I saluted her by her Name with the Title of Lady  Betty  I ask'd her when she heard from her Father when my Lady her Mother would be in Town and how she did  I TALK'D so familiarly to her of her whole Family that she cou'd not suspect but that I knew them all intimately I ask'd her why she would come Abroad without Mrs  Chime  with her that was the Name of her Woman to take care of Mrs  Judith  that was her Sister Then I enter'd into a long Chat with her about her Sister what a fine little Lady she was and ask'd her if she had learn'd  French  and a Thousand such little things to entertain her when on a sudden we see the Guards come and the Crowd run to see the King go by to the ParliamentHouse  THE Ladies run all to the Side of the  Mall  and I help'd my Lady to stand upon the edge of the Boards on the side of the  Mall  that she might be high enough to see and took the little one and lifted her quite up during which I took care to convey the gold Watch so clean away from the Lady  Betty  that she never felt it nor miss'd it till all the Crowd was gone and she was gotten into the middle of the  Mall  among the other Ladies  I TOOK my leave of her in the very Crowd and said to her as if in hast dear Lady  Betty  take care of your little Sister and so the Crowd did as it were Thrust me away from her and that I was oblig'd unwillingly to take my leave  THE hurry in such Cases is immediately over and the Place clear as soon as the King is gone by but as there is always a great running and clutter just as the King passes so having drop'd the two little Ladies and done my Business with them without any Miscarriage I kept hurring on among the Crowd as if I run to see the King and so I got before the Crowd and kept so till I came to the End of the  Mall  when the King going on toward the HorseGuards I went forward to the  Passage which went then thro' against the lower End off the  HayMarket  and there I bestow'd a Coach upon myself and made off and I confess I have not yet been so good as my word  viz  to go and visit my Lady  Betty    I WAS once of the mind to venture staying with Lady  Betty  till she mist the Watch and so have made a great Outcry about it with her and have got her into her Coach and put myself in the Coach with her and have gone Home with her for she appear'd so fond of me and so perfectly deceiv'd by my so readily talking to her of all her Relations and Family that I thought it was very easy to push the thing farther and to have got at least the Necklace of Pearl but when I consider'd that tho' the Child would not perhaps have suspected me other People might and that if I was search'd I should be discover'd I thought it was best to go off with what I had got and be satisfy'd  I CAME accidentally afterwards to hear that when the young Lady miss'd her Watch she made a great Outcry in the  Park  and sent her Footman up and down to see if he could find me out she having describ'd me so perfectly that he knew presently that it was the same Person that had stood and talked so long with him and ask'd him so many Questions about them but I was gone far enough out of their reach before she could come at her Footman to tell him the Story  I MADE another Adventure eafter this of a Nature different from all I had been concern'd in yet and this was at a GamingHouse near  ConventGarden    I SAW several People go in and out and I stood in the Passage a good while with another Woman  with me and seeing a Gentleman go up that seem'd to be of more than ordinary Fashion I said to him Sir pray don't they give Women leave to go up  yes Madam says he  and to play too if they please I mean so Sir  said I  and with that he said he would introduce me if I had a mind so I follow'd him to the Door and he looking in there Madam  says he  are the Gamesters if you have a mind to venture I look'd in and said to my Comrade aloud here's nothing but Men I won't venture among them at which one of the Gentlemen cry'd out you need not be afraid Madam here's none but fair Gamesters you are very welcome to come and Set what you please so I went a little nearer and look'd on and some of them brought me a Chair and I sat down and see the Box and Dice go round a pace then I said to my Comrade the Gentlemen play too high for us come let us go  THE People were all very civil and one Gentleman in particular encourag'd me and said come Madam if you please to Venture if you dare Trust me I'll answer for it you shall have nothing put upon you here no Sir  said I  smiling I hope the Gentlemen wou'd not Cheat a Woman but still I declin'd venturing tho' I pull'd out a Purse with Money in it that they might see I did not want Money  AFTER I had sat a while one Gentleman said to me Jeering come Madam I see you are afraid to venture for yourself I always had good luck with the Ladies you shall Set for me if you won't Set for yourself I told him Sir I should be very loth to loose your Money tho' I added I am pretty lucky too but the Gentlemen play so high that I dare not indeed venture my own  WELL well  says he  there's ten Guineas Madam Set them for me so I took his Money and set himself looking on I run out Nine the of Guineas by One and Two at a Time and then the Box coming to the next Man to me my Gentleman gave me Ten Guineas more and made me Set Five of them at once and the Gentleman who had at the Box threw out so there was Five Guineas of his Money again he was encourag'd at this and made me take the Box which was a bold Venture However I held the Box so long that I had gain'd him his whole Money and had a good handful of Guineas in my Lap and which was the better Luck when I threw out I threw but at One or Two of those that had Set me and so went off easie  WHEN I was come this length I offer'd the Gentleman all the Gold for it was his own and so would have had him play for himself pretending I did not understand the Game well enough He laugh'd and said if I had but good Luck it was no matter whether I understood the Game or no but I should not leave off However he took out the Guineas that he had put in at first and bad me play with the rest I would have told them to see how much I had got but he said no no don't tell them I believe you are very honest and 'tis bad Luck to tell them so I play'd on  I Understood the Game well enough tho' I pretended I did not and play'd cautiously it was to keep a good Stock in my Lap out of which I every now and then convey'd some into my Pocket but in such a manner and at such convenient times as I was sure he cou'd not see it  I PLAY'D a great while and had very good Luck for him but the last time I held the Box they Set me high and I threw boldly at all I held  e Box till I gain'd near Fourscore Guineas but  ost above half of it back at the last throw so I got up for I was afraid I should lose it all back again and said to him pray come Sir now and and take it and play for your self I think I  ave done pretty well for you he would have had me play'd on but it grew late and I desir'd to be excus'd When I gave it up to him I told him I hop'd he would give me leave to tell it now that I might see what I had gain'd and how lucky I had been for him when I told them there was Threescore and Three Guineas Ay  says I  if I had not been for that unlucky Throw I had got you a Hundred Guineas so I gave him all the Money but he would not take it till I had put my Hand into it and taken some for myself and bid me please myself I refus'd it and was positive I would not take it myself if he had a mind to  y thing of that kind it should be all his own doings  THE rest of the Gentlemen seeing us striving  y'd give it her all but I absolutely refus'd that when one of them said Dn ye  Jack  half it with her don't you know you should be always upon even Terms with the Ladies so in short he divided it with me and I brought away Guineas besides about which I had stole privately which I was sorry for afterwards because he was so generous  THUS I brought Home Guineas and let my old Governess see what good Luck I had at  However it was her Advice that I should  not venture again and I took her Council for I never went there any more for I knew as well as she if the Itch of Play came in I might soon lose that and all the rest of what I had got  FORTUNE had smil'd upon me to that degree and I had Thriven so much and my Governess too for she always had a Share with me that really the old Gentlewoman began to talk of leaving off while we were well and being satisfy'd with what we had got but I know not what Fate guided me I was as backward to it now as she was when I propos'd it to her before and so in an ill Hour we gave over the Thoughts of it for the present and in a Word I grew more hardn'd and audacious than ever and the Success I had made my Name as famous as any Thief of my sort ever had been at  Newgate  and in the  OldBayly    I HAD sometimes taken the liberty to Play the same Game over again which is not according to Practice which however succeeded not amiss but generally I took up new Figures and contriv'd to appear in new Shapes every time I went abroad  IT was now a rumbling time of the Year and the Gentlemen being most of them gone out of Town  Tunbridge  and  Epsom  and such Places were full of People but the City was Thin and I thought our Trade felt it a little as well as others so that at the latter End of the Year I joyn'd myself with a Gang who usually go every Year to  Sturbridge  Fair and from thence to  Bury  Fair in  Suffolk  We promis'd our selves great things here but when I came to see how things were I was weary of it presently for except meer Picking of Pockets there was little worth meddling with neither if a Booty had been made was it  so easy carrying it off nor was their such a variety of occasion for Business in our way as in  London  all that I made of the whole Journey was a gold▪ Watch at  Bury  Fair and a small parcel of Linnen at  Cambridge  which gave me an occasion to take leave of the Place It was an old Bite and I thought might do with a Country Shop keeper tho' in  London  it would not  I BOUGHT at a Linnen Draper's Shop not in the Fair but in the Town of  Cambridge  as much fine Holland and other things as came to about seven Pound when I had done I bad them be sent to such an Inn where I had purposely taken up my being the same Morning as if I was to Lodge there that Night  I ORDER'D the Draper to send them Home to me about such an Hour to the Inn where I lay and I would pay him his Money at the time appointed the Draper sends the Goods and I plac'd one of our Gang at the Chamber Door and when the Innkeeper's Maid brought the Messenger to the Door who was a young Fellow an Apprentice almost a Man she tells him her Mistress was a sleep but if he would leave the things and call in about an Hour I should be awake and he might have the Money he left the Parcel very readily and goes his way and in about half an Hour my Maid and I walk'd off and that very Evening I hired a Horse and a Man to ride before me and went to  Newmarket  and from thence got my Passage in a Coach that was not quite full to St  Edmund's Bury  Where as I told you I could make but little of my Trade only at a little Country  Opera  House made a shift to carry off a gold Watch from a Ladies side who was not only  intollerably Merry but as I thought a little Fuddled which made my Work much easier  I MADE off with this little Booty to  Ipswich  and from thence to  Harwich  where I went into an Inn as if I had newly arriv'd from  Holland  not doubting but I should make some Purchase among the Foreigners that came on shore there but I found them generally empty of things of value except what was in their Portmanteuas and  Dutch  Hampers which were generally guarded by Footmen however I fairly got one of their Portmanteuas one Evening out of the Chamber where the Gentleman lay the Footman being fast a sleep on the Bed and I suppose very Drunk  THE Room in which I Lodg'd lay next to the  Dutchman  's and having dragg'd the heavy thing with much ado out of the Chamber into mine I went out into the Street to see if I could find any possibility of carrying it off I walk'd about a great while but could see no probability either of getting out the thing or of conveying away the Goods that was in it if I had open'd it the Town being so small and I a perfect Stranger in it so I was returning with a resolution to carry it back again and leave it where I found it Just in that very Moment I heard a Man make a Noise to some People to make hast for the Boat was going to put off and the Tide would be spent I call'd to the Fellow What Boat is it Friend  says I  that you belong to the  Ipswich  Wherry Madam  says he  When do you go off  says I  this Moment Madam  says he  do you want to go thither yes  said I  if you can stay till I fetch my things Where are your things Madam  says he  At such an Inn  said I  Well I'll go with you Madam  says he  very civilly and bring them for you come away then  says I  and takes him with me  THE People of the Inn were in great hurry the PacketBoat from  Holland  being just come in and two Coaches just come also with Passengers from  London  for another PacketBoat that was going off for  Holland  which Coaches were to go back next Day with the Passengers that were just Landed In this hurry it was not much minded that I came to the Bar and paid my Reckoning telling my Landlady I had gotten my Passage by Sea in a Wherry  THESE Wherries are large Vessels with good Accommodation for carrying Passengers from  Harwich  to  London  and tho' they are call'd Wherries which is a word us'd in the  Thames  for a small Boat Row'd with one or two Men yet these are Vessels able to carry twenty Passengers and ten or fifteen Ton of Goods and fitted to bear the Sea all this I had found out by enquiring the Night before into the several ways of going to  London    MY Landlady was very Courteous took my Money for my Reckoning but was call'd away all the House being in a hurry so I left her took the Fellow up to my Chamber gave him the Trunk or Portmanteua for it was like a Trunk and wrapt it about with an old Apron and he went directly to his Boat with it and I after him no Body asking us the least Question about it for as the drunken  Dutch  Footman he was still a sleep and his Master with other Foreign Gentlemen at Supper and very Merry below so I went clean off with it to  Ipswich  and going in the Night the People of the House knew nothing but that I was gone to  London  by the  Harwich  Wherry as I had told my Landlady  I WAS plagu'd at  Ipswich  with the Custom House Officers who stopt my Trunk  as I call'd it  and would open and search it I was willing I told them they should search it but my Husband had the Key and he was not yet come from  Harwich  this I said that if upon searching it they should find all the things be such as properly belong'd to a Man rather than a Woman it should not seem strange to them however they being possitive to open the Trunk I consented to have it be broken open that is to say to have the Lock taken off which was not difficult  THEY found nothing for their turn for the Trunk had been search'd before but they discover'd several things very much to my satisfaction as particularly a parcel of Money in  French  Pistoles and some  Dutch  Ducatoons or  Rix  Dollars and the rest was chiefly two Perriwigs wearing Linnen and Razors Washballs Perfumes and other useful things Necessaries for a Gentleman which all pass'd for my Husband's and so I was quit of them  IT was now very early in the Morning and not Light and I knew not well what Course to take for I made no doubt but I should be pursued in the Morning and perhaps be taken with the things about me so I resolv'd upon taking new Measures I went publickly to an Inn in the Town with my Trunk  as I call'd it  and having taken the Substance out I did not think the Lumber of it worth my concern however I gave it the Landlady of the House with a Charge to take great Care of it and lay it up safe till I should come again and away I walk'd into the Street  WHEN I was got into the Town a great way from the Inn I met with an antient Woman who had just open'd her Door I and fell into Chat with her and ask'd her a great many wild Questions of things all remote to my Purpose and Design but in my Discourse I found by her how the Town was situated that I was in a Street which went out towards  Hadly  but that such a Street went towards the Waterside such a Street went into the Heart of the Town and at last such a Street went towards  Colchester  and so the  London  Road lay there  I HAD soon my Ends of this old Woman for I only wanted to know which was  London  Road and away I walk'd as fast as I could not that I intended to go on Foot either to  London  or to  Colchester  but I wanted to get quietly away from  Ipswich    I WALK'D about two or three Mile and then I met a plain Countryman who was busy about some Husbandry work I did not know what and I ask'd him a great many Questions first not much to the purpose but at last told him I was going for  London  and the Coach was full and I cou'd not get a Passage and ask'd him if he cou'd not tell me where to hire a Horse that would carry double and an honest Man to ride before me to  Colchester  that so I might get a Place there in the Coaches the honest Clown look'd earnestly at me and said nothing for above half a Minute when scratching his Pole a Horse say you and to  Colchester  to carry double why yes Mistress a lackaday you may have Horses enough for Money well Friend  says I  that I take for granted I don't expect it without Money Why but Mistress  says he  how much are you willing to give  nay says I again Friend I don't know what your Rates are in the Country here for I am a Stranger but if you can get one for me get it as Cheap as you can and I'll give you somewhat for your Pains  WHY that's honestly said too says the Countryman  not so honest neither  said I to myself  if thou knewest all  why Mistress  says he  I have a Horse that will carry Double and I don't much care if I go my self with you  and the like  Will you  says I  well I believe you are an honest Man if you will I shall be glad of it I'll pay you in Reason why look ye Mistress  says he  I won't be out of Reason with you then if I carry you to  Colechester  it will be worth five Shillings for myself and my Horse for I shall hardly come back to Night  IN short I hir'd the honest Man and his Horse but when we came to a Town upon the Road I do not remember the Name of it but it stands upon a River I pretended myself very ill and I could go no farther that Night but if he would stay there with me because I was a Stranger I would pay him for himself and his Horse with all my Heart  THIS I did because I knew the  Dutch  Gentlemen and their Servants would be upon the Road that Day either in the Stage Coaches or riding Post and I did not know but the drunken Follow or some body else that might have seen me at  Harwich  might see me again and so I thought that in ones Days stop they would be all gone by  WE lay all that Night there and the next Morning it was not very early when I set out so that it was near Ten aClock by that time I got to  Colechester  It was no little Pleasure that I  saw the Town where I had so many pleasant Days and I made many Enquires after the good old Friends I had once had there but could make little out they were all dead or remov'd The young Ladies had been all married or gone to  London  the old Gentleman and the old Lady that had been my early Benefactress all dead and which troubled me most the young Gentleman my first Lover and afterwards my BrotherinLaw was dead but two Sons Men grown were left of him but they too were Transplanted to  London    I DISMISS'D my old Man here and stay'd incognito for three or four Days in  Colechester  and then took a Passage in a Waggon because I would not venture being seen in the  Harwich  Coaches but I needed not have used so much Caution for there was no Body in  Harwich  but the Woman of the House could have known me nor was it rational to think that she considering the hurry she was in and that she never saw me but once and that by Candle light should have ever discover'd me  I WAS now return'd to  London  and tho' by the Accident of the last Adventure I got something considerable yet I was not fond of any more Country rambles nor should I have ventur'd Abroad again if I had carried the Trade on to the End of my Days I gave my Governess a History of my Travels she lik'd the  Harwich  Journey well enough and in Discoursing of these things between our selves she observ'd that a Theif being a Creature that Watches the Advantages of other Peoples mistakes 'tis impossible but that to one that is vigilant and industrious many Opportunities must happen and therefore she thought that  one so exquisitely keen in the Trade as I was would scarce fail of something extraordinary where ever I went  ON the other hand every Branch of my Story if duly consider'd may be useful to honest People and afford a due Caution to People of some sort or other to Guard against the like Surprizes and to have their Eyes about them when they have to do with Strangers of any kind for 'tis very seldom that some Snare or other is not in their way The Moral indeed of all my Historys left to be gather'd by the Senses and Judgment of the Reader I am not Qualified to preach to them let the Experience of one Creature compleatly Wicked and compleatly Miserable be a Storehouse of useful warning to those that read  I AM drawing now towards a new Variety of the Scenes of Life Upon my return being hardened by a long Race of Crime and Success unparalell'd at least in the reach of my own Knowledge I had as I have said no thoughts of laying down a Trade which if I was to judge by the Example of others must however End at last in Misery and Sorrow  IT was on the  Christmasday  following in the Evening that to finish a long Train of Wickedness I went Abroad to see what might offer in my way when going by a Working SilverSmiths in  Fosterlane  I saw a tempting Bait indeed and not to be resisted by one of my Occupation for the Shop had no Body in it as I could see and a great deal of loose Plate lay in the Window and at the Seat of the Man who usually as I suppose Work'd at one side of the Shop  I WENT boldly in and was just going to lay my Hand upon a peice of Plate and might have  done it and carried it clear off for any care that the Men who belong'd to the Shop had taken of it but an officious Fellow in a House not a Shop on the other side of the Way seeing me go in and observing that there was no Body in the Shop comes running over the Street and into the Shop and without asking me what I was or who seizes upon me and cries out for the People of the House  I HAD not as I said above touch'd any thing in the Shop and seeing a glimpse of some Body running over to the Shop I had so much presence of Mind as to knock very hard with my Foot on the Floor of the House and was just calling out too when the Fellow laid Hands on me  HOWEVER as I had always most Courage when I was in most danger so when the Fellow laid Hands on me I stood very high upon it that I came in to buy half a Dozen of silver Spoons and to my good Fortune it was a Silversmith's that sold Plate as well as work'd Plate for other Shops The Fellow laugh'd at that Part and put such a value upon the Service that he had done his Neighbour that he would have it be that I came not to buy but to steal and raising a great Crowd I said to the Master of the Shop who by this time was fetch'd Home from some Neighbouring Place that it was in vain to make Noise and enter into Talk there of the Case the Fellow had insisted that I came to steal and he must prove it and I desir'd we might go before a Magistrate without any more Words for I began to see I should be too hard for the Man that had seiz'd me  THE Master and Mistress of the Shop were really not so violent as the Man from tother side of the Way and the Man said Mistress you might come into the Shop with a good Design for ought I know  but it seem'd a dangerous thing for you to come into such a Shop as mine is when you see no Body there and I cannot do Justice to my Neighbour who was so kind to me as not to acknowledge he had reason on his Side tho' upon the whole I do not find you attemp'd to take any thing and I really know not what to do in it I press'd him to go before a Magistrate with me and if any thing cou'd be prov'd on me that was like a design of Robbery I should willingly submit but if not I expected reparation  JUST while we were in this Debate and a Crowd of People gather'd about the Door came by Sir  T B  an Alderman of the City and Justice of the Peace and the Goldsmith hearing of it goes out and entreated his Worship to come in and decide the Case  GIVE the Goldsmith his due he told his Story with a great deal of Justice and Moderation and the Fellow that had come over and seiz'd upon me told his with as much Heat and foollish Passion which did me good still rather than Harm It came then to my turn to speak and I told his Worship that I was a Stranger in  London  being newly come out of the  North  that I Lodg'd in such a Place that I was passing this Street and went into the Goldsmiths Shop to buy half a Dozen of Spoons by great good Luck I had an old silver Spoon in my Pocket which I pull'd out and told him I had carried that Spoon to match it with half a Dozen of new ones that it might match some I had in the Country  THAT seeing no Body in the Shop I knock'd with my Foot very hard to make the People hear and had also call'd aloud with my Voice Tis true there was loose Plate in the Shop but that  no Body cou'd say I had touch'd any of it or gone near it that a Fellow came running into the Shop out of the Street and laid Hands on me in a furious manner in the very Moments while I was calling for the People of the House that if he had really had a mind to have done his Neighbour any Service he should have stood at a distance and silently watch'd to see whether I had touch'd any thing or no and then have clap'd in upon me and taken me in the Fact That is very true  says Mr Alderman  and turning to the Fellow that stopt me he ask'd him if it was true that I knock'd with my Foot he said yes I had knock'd but that might be because of his coming Nay says  the Alderman  taking him short now you contradict yourself for just now you said she was in the Shop with her back to you and did not see you till you came upon her now it was true that my back was partly to the Street but yet as my Business was of a kind that requir'd me to have my Eyes every way so I really had a glance of him running over as I said before tho' he did not perceive it  AFTER a full Hearing the Alderman gave it as his Opinion that his Neighbour was under a mistake and that I was Innocent and the Goldsmith acquisc'd in it too and his Wife and so I was dismiss'd but as I was going to depart Mr  Alderman  said but  hold Madam  if you were designing to buy Spoons I hope you will not let my Friend here lose his Customer by the Mistake I readily answer'd no Sir I'll buy the Spoons still if he can Match my odd Spoon which I brought for a Pattern and the Goldsmith shew'd me some of the very same Fashion so he weigh'd the Spoons and they came to five and thirty Shillings  so I pulls out my Purse to pay him in which I had near Guineas for I never went without such a Sum about me what ever might happen and I found it of use at other times as well as now  WHEN Mr  Alderman  saw my Money  he said  well Madam now I am satisfy'd you were wrong'd and it was for this Reason that I mov'd you should buy the Spoons and staid till you had bought them for if you had not had Money to pay for them I should have suspected that you did not come into the Shop with an intent to buy for indeed the sort of People who come upon those Designs that you have been Charg'd with are seldom troubl'd with much Gold in their Pockets as I see you are  I SMIL'D and told his Worship that then I ow'd something of his Favour to my Money but I hop'd he saw reason also in the Justice he had done me before he said yes he had but this had confirm'd his Opinion and he was fully satisfy'd now of my having been injur'd so I came off with flying Colours tho' from an Affair in which I was at the very brink of Destruction  IT was but three Daysafter this that not at all made Cautious by my former Danger as I us'd to be and still pursuing the Art which I had so long been employ'd in I ventur'd into a House where I saw the Doors open and furnish'd myself as I thought verily without being perceiv'd with two Peices of flower'd Silks such as they call Brocaded Silk very rich it was not a Mercers Shop nor a Warehouse of a Mercer but look'd like a private DwellingHouse and was it seems Inhabited by a Man that sold Goods for the Weavers to the Mercers like a Broker or Factor  THAT I may make short of this black Part of this Story I was attack'd by two Wenches that came open Mouth'd at me just as I was going out at the Door and one of them pull'd me back into the Room while the other shut the Door upon me I would have given them good Words but there was no room for it▪ two firery Dragons cou'd not have been more furious then they were they tore my Cloths bully'd and roar'd as if they would have murther'd me the Mistress of the House came next and then the Master and all outrageous for a while especially  I GAVE the Master very good Words told him the Door was open and things were a Temptation to me that I was poor and distress'd and Poverty was what many could not resist and beg'd him with Tears to have pity on me the Mistress of the House was mov'd with Compassion and enclin'd to have let me go and had almost perswaded her Husband to it also but the sawcy Wenches were run even before they were sent and had fetch'd a Constable and then the Master said he could not go back I must go before a Justice and answer'd his Wife that he might come into Trouble himself if he should let me go  THE sight of the Constable indeed struck me me with terror and I thought I should have sunk into the Ground I fell into faintings and indeed the People themselves thought I would have died when the Woman argued again for me and entreated her Husband seeing they had lost nothing to let me go I offer'd him to pay for the two Peices whatever the value was tho' I had not got them and argued that as he had his Goods and had really lost nothing it would be cruel to pursue me to Death and have my Blood for the  bare Attempt of taking them I put the Constable in mind that I had broke no Doors nor carried any thing away and when I came to the Justice and pleaded there that I had neither broken any thing to get in nor carried any thing out the Justice was enclin'd to have releas'd me but the first sawcy Jade that stop'd me affirming that I was going out with the Goods but that she stop'd me and pull'd me back as I was upon the Threshold the Justice upon that point committed me and I was carried to  Newgate  that horrid Place my very Blood chills at the mention of its Name the Place where so many of my Comrades had been lock'd up and from whence they went to the fatal Tree the Place were my Mother suffered so deeply where I was brought into the World and from whence I expected no Redemption but by an infamous Death To conclude the Place that had so long expected me and which with so much Art and Success I had so long avoided  I WAS now fix'd indeed 'tis impossible to describe the terror of my mind when I was first brought in and when I look'd round upon all the horrors of that dismal Place I look'd on myself as lost and that I had nothing to think of but of going out of the World and that with the utmost Infamy the hellish Noise the Roaring▪ Swearing and Clamour the Stench and Nastiness and all the dreadful croud of Afflicting things that I saw there joyn'd together to make the Place seem an Emblem of Hell itself and a kind of an Entrance into it  NOW I reproach'd myself with the many hints I had had  as I have mentioned above  from my own Reason from the Sense of my good Circumstances and of the many Dangers I had escap'd to  leave off while I was well and how I had withstood them all and hardened my Thoughts against all Fear it seem'd to me that I was hurried on by an invitable and unseen Fate to this Day of Misery and that now I was to Expiate all my Offences at the Gallows that I was now to give satisfaction to Justice with my Blood and that I was come to the last Hour of my Life and of my Wickedness together These things pour'd themselves in upon my Thoughts in a confus'd manner and left me overwhelm'd with Melancholly and Despair  THEN I repented heartily of all my Life past but that Repentance yielded me no Satisfaction no Peace no not in the least because  as I said to myself  it was repenting after the Power of farther Sinning was taken away I seem'd not to Mourn that I had committed such Crimes and for the Fact as it was an Offence against God and my Neighbour but I mourn'd that I was to be punish'd for it I was a Penitent as I thought not that I had sinn'd but that I was to suffer and this took away all the Comfort and even the hope of my Repentance in my own Thoughts  I GOT no sleep for several Nights or Days after I came into that wretch'd Place and glad I wou'd have been for some time to have died there tho' I did not consider dying as it ought to be consider'd neither indeed nothing could be fill'd with more horror to my Imagination than the very Place nothing was more odious to me than the Company that was there O▪ if I had but been sent to any Place in the World and not to  Newgate  I should have thought myself happy  IN the next Place how did the harden'd Wretches that were there before me Triumph over me what Mrs  Flanders  come to  Newgate  at last what Mrs  Mary  Mrs  Molly  and after that plain  Moll Flanders  They thought the Devil had help'd me they said that I had reign'd so long they expected me there many Years ago and was I come at last then they flouted me with my Dejections welcom'd me to the Place wish'd me Joy bid me have a good Heart not to be cast down things might not be so bad as I fear'd and the like then call'd for Brandy and drank to me but put it all up to my Score for they told me I was but just come to the College  as they call'd it  and sure I had Money in my Pocket tho' they had none  I ASK'D one of this Crew how long she had been there she said four Months I ask'd her how the Place look'd to her when she first came into it just as it did now to me  says she  dreadful and frightful that she thought she was in Hell and lieve so still  adds she but it is natural to me now I don't disturb myself about it  I suppose says I you are in no danger of what is to follow Nay  says she  for you are mistaken there I assure you for I am under Sentence only I pleaded my Belly but I am no more with Child than the Judge that try'd me and I expect to be call'd down next Sessions  this  CALLING DOWN is calling down  to their former Judgement when a Woman has been respited for her Belly but proves not to be with Child or if she has been with Child and has been brought to Bed  Well says I and are you thus easy ay  says she  I can't help myself what signifyes being sad If I am hang'd there's and End of me  says she    and away she turns Dancing and Sings as she goes the following Peice of  Newgate  Wit  If I swing by the String  I shall hear the  The Bell at St  Sepulcher's  which Tolls upon Execution Day    Bell ring  And then there's an End of poor  Jenny    I MENTION this because it would be worth the Observation of any Prisoner who shall hereafter fall into the same Misfortune and come to that dreadful Place of  Newgate  how Time Necessity and Conversing with the Wretches that are there Familiarizes the Place to them how at last they become reconcil'd to that which at first was the greatest Dread upon their Spirits in the World and are as impudently Chearful and Merry in their Misery as they were when out of it  I CAN not say as some do this Devil is not so black as he is painted for indeed no Colours can represent the Place to the Life nor any Soul conceive aright of it but those who have been Sufferers there But how Hell should become by degrees so natural and not only tollerable but even agreeable is a thing Unintelligible but by those who have Experienc'd it as I have  THE same Night that I was sent to  Newgate  I sent the News of it to my old Governess who was surpriz'd at it you may be sure and spent the Night alomost as ill out of  Newgate  as I did in it  THE next Morning she came to see me she did what she cou'd to Comfort me but she saw that was to no purpose however as she said to sink under the Weight was but to encrease the Weight she immediately applied her self to all the proper Methods to prevent the Effects of it which we  fear'd and first she found out the two fiery Jades that had surpriz'd me she tamper'd with them persuad'd them offer'd them Money and in a Word try'd all imaginable ways to prevent a Prosecution she offer'd one of the Wenches  l  to go away from her Mistress and not to appear against me but she was so resolute that tho' she was but a ServantMaid at  l  a Year Wages or thereabouts she refus'd it and would have refus'd it as my Governess said she believ'd if she had offer'd her  l  Then she attack'd the tother Maid she was not so hard Hearted in appearance as the other and sometimes seem'd inclin'd to be merciful but the first Wench kept her up and chang'd her Mind and would not so much as let my Governess talk with her but threatn'd to have her up for Tampering with the Evidence  THEN she apply'd to the Master that is to say the Man whose Goods had been stol'n and particularly to his Wife who as I told you was enclin'd at first to have some Compassion for me she found the Woman the same still but the Man alledg'd he was bound by the Justice that committed me to Prosecute and that he should forfeit his Recognizance  MY Governess offer'd to find Friends that should get his Recognizances off of the File as they call it and that he should not suffer but it was not possible to Convince him that could be done or that he could be safe any way in the World but by appearing against me so I was to have three Witnesses of Fact against me the Master and his two Maids that is to say I was as certain to be cast for my Life as I was certain that I was alive and I had nothing to do but to think of dying and prepare for it I had but a sad foundation  to build upon as I said before for all my Repentance appear'd to me to be only the Effect of my fear of Death not a sincere regret for the wicked Life that I had liv'd and which had brought this Misery upon me or for the offending my Creator who was now suddenly to be my Judge  I LIV'D many Days here under the utmost horror of Soul I had Death as it were inview and thought of nothing Night and Day but of Gibbets and Halters evil Spirits and Devils it is not to be express'd by Words how I was harrass'd between the dreadful Apprehensions of Death and the Terror of my Conscience reproaching me with my past horrible Life  THE Ordinary of  Newgate  came to me and talk'd a little in his way but all his Divinity run upon Confessing my Crime as he call'd it tho' he knew not what I was in for making a full Discovery and the like without which he told me God would never forgive me and he said so little to the purpose that I had no manner of Consolation from him and then to observe the poor Creature preaching Confession and Repentance to me in the Morning and find him drunk with Brandy and Spirits by Noon this had something in it so shocking that I began to Nauseate the Man more than his Work and his Work too by degrees for the sake of the Man so that I desir'd him to trouble me no more  I KNOW not how it was but by the indefatigable Application of my diligent Governess I had no Bill preferr'd against me the first Sessions I mean to the Grand Jury at  GuildHall  so I had another Month or five Weeks before me and without doubt this ought  to have been accepted by me as so much time given me for Reflection upon what was past and preparation for what was to come or in a Word I ought to have esteem'd it as a space given me for Repentance and have employ'd it as such but it was not in me I was sorry  as before  for being in  Newgate  but had very few Signs of Repentance about me  ON the contrary like the Waters in the Caveties and Hollows of Mountains which putrifies and turns into Stone whatever they are suffer'd to drop upon so the continual Conversing with such a Crew of HellHounds as I was which had the same common Operation upon me as upon other People I degenerated into Stone I turn'd first Stupid and Senseless then Brutish and thoughtless and at last raving Mad as any of them were and in short I became as naturally pleas'd and easie with the Place as if indeed I had been Born there  IT is scarce possible to imagine that our Natures should be capable of so much Degeneracy as to make that pleasant and agreeable that in it self is the most compleat Misery Here was a Circumstance that I think it is scarce possible to mention a worse I was as exquisitely miserable as speaking of common Cases it was possible for any one to be that had Life and Health and Money to help them as I had  I HAD a weight of Guilt upon me enough to sink any Creature who had the least power of Reflection left and had any Sense upon them of the Happiness of this Life or the Misery of another then I had at first remorse indeed but no Repentance I had now neither Remorse or Repentance I had a Crime charg'd on me the Punishments of which was Death by our Law▪ the  Proof so evident that there was no room for me so much as to plead not Guilty I had the Name of old Offender so that I had nothing to expect but Death in a few Weeks time neither had I myself any thoughts of Escaping and yet a certain strange Lethargy of Soul possess'd me I had no Trouble no Apprehensions no Sorrow about me the first Surprize was gone I was I may well say I know not how my Senses my Reason nay my Conscience were all asleep my Course of Life for forty Years had been a horrid Complication of Wickedness Whoredom Adultery Incest Lying Theft and in a Word every thing but Murther and Treason had been my Practice from the Age of Eighteen or thereabouts to Threescore and now I was ingulph'd in the misery of Punishment and had an infamous Death just at the Door and yet I had no Sense of my Condition no Thought of Heaven or Hell at least that went any farther than a bare flying Touch like the Stich or Pain that gives a Hint and goes off I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy or indeed to think of it and in this I think I have given a brief Description of the compleatest Misery on Earth  ALL my terrifying Thoughts were past the Horrors of the Place were become Familiar and I felt no more uneasinesses at the Noise and Clamours of the Prison then they did who made that Noise in a Word I was became meer a  NewgateBird  as Wicked and as Outragious as any of them nay I scarce retain'd the Habit and Custom of good Breeding and Manners which all along till now run thro' my Conversation so thro' a Degeneracy had possess'd me that I was no more the  same thing that I had been than if I had never been otherwise than what I was now  IN the middle of this harden'd Part of my Life I had another sudden Surprize which call'd me back a little to that thing call'd Sorrow which indeed I began to be past the Sense of before they told me one Night that there was brought into the Prison late the Night before three HighwayMen who had committed a Robbery somewhere on the to Road  Windsor HounslowHeath  I think it was and were pursu'd to  Uxbridge  by the Country and were taken there after a gallant Resistance in which I know not how many of the Country People were wounded and some kill'd  IT is not to be wonder'd that we were Prisoners were all desirous enough to see these brave topping Gentlemen that were talk'd up to be such as their Fellows had not been known and especially because it was said they would in the Morning be remov'd into the PressYard having given Money to the HeadMaster of the Prison to be allow'd the liberty of that better Part of the Prison So we that were Women plac'd ourselves in the way that we would be sure to see them but nothing cou'd express the Amazement and Surprize I was in when the very first Man that came out I knew to be my  Lancashire  Husband the same who liv'd so well at  Dunstable  and the same who I afterwards saw at  Brickill  when I was married to my last Husband as has been related  I WAS struck Dumb at the Sight and knew neither what to say or what to do he did not know me and that was all the present Relief I had I quitted my Company and retir'd a much as that dreadful Place suffers any Body to retire and I cry'd vehemently for a great while dreadful Creature that I  am  said I  How many poor People have I made Miserable How many desperate Wretches have I sent to the Devil This Gentleman's Misfortunes I plac'd all to my own Account He had told me at  Chester  he was ruin'd by that Match and that his Fortunes were made Desperate that on my Account for that thinking I had been a Fortune he was run into Debt more then he was able to pay and that he knew not what Course to take that he would go into the Army and carry a Musquet or buy a Horse and take a Tour as he call'd it and tho' I never told him that I was a Fortune and so did not actually Deceive him myself yet I did encourage the having it thought that I was so and by that means I was the occasion originally of his Mischief  THE Surprize of this thing only struck deeper into my Thoughts and gave me stronger Reflections than all that had befallen me before I griev'd Day and Night for him and the more for that they told he was the Captain of the Gang and that he had committed so many Robberies that  ind  or  Whitney  or the  Golden Farmer  were Fools to him that he would surely be hang'd if there were no more Men left in the Country he was born in and that there would abundance of People come in against him  I WAS overwhelm'd with grief for him my own Case gave me no disturbance compar'd to this and I loaded my self with Reproaches on his Account I bewail'd his Misfortunes and the ruin he was now come to at such a Rate that I relish'd nothing now as I did before and the first Reflections I made upon the horrid detestable Life I had liv'd began to return upon me and as these things return'd my abhorrance of the Place I was in and of the way of living in it return'd  also in a word I was perfectly chang'd and become another Body  WHILE I was under these influences of sorrow for him came Notice to me that the next Sessions approaching there would be a Bill preferr'd to the Grand Jury against me and that I should be certainly try'd for my Life at the  OldBaily  My Temper was touch'd before the harden'd wretch'd boldness of Spirit which I had acquir'd abated and Conscious in the Prison Guilt began to flow in upon my Mind In short I began to think and to think is one real Advance from Hell to Heaven all that Hellish harden'd state and temper of Soul which I have said so much of before is but a deprivation of Thought he that is restor'd to his Power of thinking is restor'd to himself  AS soon as I began I say to Think the first thing that occurr'd to me broke out thus Lord what will become of me I shall certainly die I shall be cast to be sure and there is nothing beyond that but Death I have no Friends what shall I do I shall be certainly cast Lord have Mercy upon me what will become of me This was a sad Thought you will say to be the first after so long time that had started into my Soul of that kind and yet even this was nothing but fright at what was to come there was not a Word of sincere Repentance in it all However I was indeed dreadfully dejected and disconsolate to the last degree and as I had no Friend in the World to communicate my distress'd Thoughts to it lay so heavy upon me that it threw me into Fits and Swoonings several times aDay I sent for my old Governess and she  give her her due  acted the Part of a true Friend she left me no Stone untunr'd to prevent the Grand Jury finding  out one or two of the Jury Men talk'd with them and endeavour'd to possess them with favourable Dispositions on Account that nothing was taken away and no House broken  c  but all would not do they were overruled by the rest the two Wenches swore home to the Fact and the Jury found the Bill against me for Robbery and Housebreaking that is for Felony and Burglary  I SUNK down when they brought me News of it and after I came to myself again I thought I should have died with the weight of it My Governess acted a true Mother to me she pittied me she cryed with me and for me but she cou'd not help me and to add to the Terror of it 'twas the Discourse all over the House that I should die for it I cou'd hear them talk it among themselves very often and see them shake their Heads and say they were sorry for it and the like as is usual in the Place but still no Body came to tell me their Thoughts till at last one of the Keepers came to me privately and said with a Sigh well Mrs  Flanders  you will be tried a  Friday  this was but a  Wednesday  what do you intend to do I turn'd as white as a Clout and said God knows what I shall do for my part I know not what to do why  says he  I won't flatter you I would have you prepare for Death for I doubt you will be Cast and as they say you are an old Offender I doubt you will find but little Mercy They say  added he  your Case is very plain and that the Witnesses swear so home against you there will be no standing it  THIS was a stab into the very Vitals of one under such a Burthen as I was oppress'd with before and I cou'd not speak to him a Word good or bad for a great while but at last I burst out into  Tears and said to him Lord Mr What must I do Do  says he  send for the Ordinary send for a Minister and talk with him for indeed Mrs  Flanders  unless you have very good Friends you are no Woman for this World  THIS was plain dealing indeed but it was very harsh to me at least I thought it so He left me in the greatest Confusion imaginable and all that Night I lay awake and now I began to say my Prayers which I had scarce done before since my last Husband's Death or from a little while after and truly I may well call it saying my Prayers for I was in such a Confusion and had such horrour upon my Mind that tho' I cry'd and repeated several times the Ordinary Expression of  Lord have Mercy upon me  I never brought my self to any Sense of my being a miserable Sinner as indeed I was and of Confessing my Sins to God and begging Pardon for the sake of Jesus Christ I was overwhelm'd with the Sense of my Condition being try'd for my Life and being sure to be Condemn'd and then I was as sure to be Executed and on this Account I cry'd out all Night Lord what will become of me Lord what shall I do Lord I shall be hang'd Lord have mercy upon me and the like  MY poor afflicted Governess was now as much concern'd as I and a great deal more truly Penitent tho' she had no prospect of being brought to Tryal and Sentence not but that she deserv'd it as much as I and so she said herself but she had not done any thing herself for many Years other than receiving what I and others stole and encouraging us to steal it But she cry'd and took on like a distracted Body wringing her Hands and crying out that she was undone that she believ'd there  was a Curse from Heaven upon her that she should be damn'd that she had been the Destruction of all her Friends that she had brought such a one and such a one and such one to the Gallows and there she reckon'd up ten or eleven People some of which I have given an Account of that came to untimely Ends and that now she was the occasion of my Ruin for she had persuaded me to go on when I would have left off I interrupted her there no Mother no  said I  don't speak of that for you would have had me left off when I got the Mercer's Money again and when I came home from  Harwich  and I would not hearken to you therefore you have not been to blame it is I only have ruin'd myself I have brought myself to this Misery and thus we spent many Hours together  WELL three was no Remedy the Prosecution went on and on the  Thursday  I was carried down to the SessionsHouse where I was arraign'd as they call'd it and the next Day I was appointed to be Try'd At the Arraigment I pleaded not Guilty and well I might for I was indicted for Felony and Burglary that is for feloniously stealing two Pieces of Brocaded Silk value  l  the Goods of  Anthony Johnson  and for breaking open his Doors whereas I knew very well they could not pretend to prove I had broken up the Doors or so much as lifted up a Latch  ON the  Friday  I was brought to my Tryal I had exhausted my Spirits with Crying for two or three Days before that I slept better the  Thursday  Night than I expected and had more Courage for my Tryal than indeed I thought possible for me to have  WHEN the Tryal began and the Indictment was read I would have spoke but they told me the Witnesses must be heard first and then I should have time to be heard The Witnesses were the two Wenches a Couple of hard Mouth'd Jades indeed for tho' the thing was Truth in the main yet they aggravated it to the utmost extremity and swore I had the Goods wholly in my possession that I had hid them among my Cloaths that I was going off with them that I had one Foot over the Threshold when they discovered themselves▪ and then I put tother over so that I was quite out of the House in the Street with the Goods before they took hold of me and then they seiz'd me and brought me back again and they took the Goods upon me The Fact in general was all true but I believe and insisted upon it that they stop'd before I had set my Foot clear of the Threshold of the House but that did not argue much for certain it was that I had taken the Goods and that I was bringing them away if I had not been taken  BUT I pleaded that I had stole nothing they had lost nothing that the Door was open and I went in seeing the Goods lye there and with Design to buy if seeing no Body in the House I had taken any of them up in my Hand it cou'd not be concluded that I intended to steal them for that I never carried them farther then the Door to look on them with the better Light  THE Court would not allow that by any means and made a kind of a Jest of my intending to buy the Goods that being no Shop for the Selling of any thing and as to carrying them to the Door to look at them the Maids made their impudent Mocks upon that and spent their Wit upon it very much told the Court I had look'd at them  sufficiently and approv'd them very well for I had pack'd them up under my Cloaths and was a going with them  IN short I was found Guilty of Felony but acquited of the Burglary which was but small Comfort to me the first bringing me to a Sentence of Death and the last would have done no more The next Day I was carried down to receive the dreadful Sentence and when they came to ask me what I had to say why Sentence should not pass I stood mute a while but some Body that stood behind me prompted me aloud to speak to the Judges for that they cou'd represent things favourably for me This encourag'd me to speak and I told them I had nothing to say to stop the Sentence but that I had much to say to bespeak the Mercy of the Court that I hop'd they would allow something in such a Case for the Circumstances of it that I had broken no Doors had carried nothing off that no Body had lost any thing that the Person whose Goods they were was pleas'd to say he desir'd Mercy might be shown which indeed he very honestly did that at the worst it was the first Offence and that I had never been before any Court of Justice before And in a Word I spoke with more Courage than I thought I cou'd have done and in such a moving Tone and tho' with Tears yet not so many Tears as to obstruct my Speech that I cou'd see it mov'd others to Tears that heard me  THE Judges sat Grave and Mute gave me an easy Hearing and time to say all that I would but saying neither Yes or No to it Pronounc'd the Sentence of Death upon me a Sentence that was to me like Death itself which after it was read confounded me I had no more Spirit left in me I  had no Tongue to speak or Eyes to look up either to God or Man  MY poor Governess was utterly Disconsolate and she that was my Comforter before wanted Comfort now herself and sometimes Mourning sometimes Raging was as much out of herself as to all outward Appearance as any mad Woman in  Bedlam  Nor was she only Disconsolate as to me but she was struck with Horror at the Sense of her own wicked Life and began to look back upon it with a Taste quite different from mine for she was Penitent to the highest Degree for her Sins as well as Sorrowful for the Misfortune She sent for a Minister too a serious pious good Man and apply'd herself with such earnestness by his assistance to the Work of a sincere Repentance that I believe and so did the Minister too that she was a true Penitent and which is still more she was not only so for the Occasion and at that Juncture but she continu'd so as I was inform'd to the Day of her Death  IT is rather to be thought of than express'd what was now my Condition I had nothing before me but present Death and as I had no Friends to assist me or to stir for me I expected nothing but to find my Name in the Dead Warrant which was to come down for the Execution the  Friday  afterward of five more and myself  IN the mean time my poor distress'd Governess sent me a Minister who at her request first and at my own afterwards came to visit me He exhorted me seriously to repent of all my Sins and to dally no longer with my Soul not flattering myself with hopes of Life which he said he was inform'd there was no room to expect but unfeignedly to look up to God with my whole Soul  and to cry for Pardon in the Name of Jesus Christ He back'd his Discourses with proper Quotations of Scripture encouraging the greatest Sinner to Repent and turn from their Evil way and when he had done he kneel'd down and pray'd with me  IT was now that for the first time I felt any real signs of Repentance I now began to look back upon my past Life with abhorrence and having a kind of view into the other Side of time the things of Life as I believe they do with every Body at such a time began to look with a different Aspect and quite another Shape than they did before the greatest and best things the views of felicity the joy the griefs of Life were quite other things and I had nothing in my Thoughts but what was so infinitely Superior to what I had known in Life that it appear'd to me to be the greatest stupidity in Nature to lay any weight upon any thing tho' the most valuable in this World  THE Word Eternity represented itself with all its incomprehensible Additions and I had such extended Notions of it that I know not how to express them Among the rest how vile how gross how absurd did every pleasant thing look I mean that we had counted pleasant before especially when I reflected that these sordid Trifies were the things for which we forfeited eternal Felicity  WITH these Reflections came in of meer Course severe Reproaches of my own Mind for my wretched Behaviour in my past Life that I had forfeited all hope of any Happiness in the Eternity that I was just going to enter into and on the contrary was entitul'd to all that was miserable or had been conceiv'd of Misery and all this with the frightful Addition of its being also Eternal  I AM not capable of reading Lectures of Instruction to any Body but I relate this in the very manner in which things then appear'd to me as far as I am able but infinitely short of the lively impressions which they made on my Soul at that time indeed those Impressions are not to be explain'd by words or if they are I am not Mistress of Words enough to express them It must be the Work of every sober Reader to make just Reflections on them as their own Circumstances may direct and without Question this is what every one at sometime or other may feel something of I mean a clearer Sight into things to come than they had here and a dark view of their own Concern in them  BUT I go back to my own Case the Minister press'd me to tell him as far as I thought convenient in what State I found myself as to the Sight I had of things beyond Life he told me he did not come as Ordinary of the Place whose business it is to extort Confessions from Prisoners for private Ends or for the farther detecting of other Offenders that his business was to move me to such freedom of Discourse as might serve to disburthen my own Mind and furnish him to administer Comfort to me as far as was in his Power and assur'd me that whatever I said to him should remain with him and be as much a Secret as if it was known only to God and myself and that he desir'd to know nothing of me but as above to qualifie him to apply proper Advice and Assistance to me and to pray to God for me  THIS honest friendly way of treating me unlock'd all the Sluces of my Passions He broke into my very Soul by it and I unravell'd all the Wickedness of my Life to him In a word I gave him an Abridgement of this whole History I gave  him the Picture of my Conduct for Years in Miniature  I HID nothing from him and he in return exhorted me to a sincere Repentance explain'd to me what he meant by Repentance and then drew out such a Scheme of infinite Mercy proclaim'd from Heaven to Sinners of the greatest Magnitude that he left me nothing to say that look'd like despair or doubting of being accepted and in this Condition he left me the first Night  HE visited me again the next Morning and went on with his Method of explaining the Terms of Divine Mercy which according to him consisted of nothing more or more Difficult than that of being sincerely desirous of it and willing to accept it only a sincere Regret for and hatred of those things I had done which render'd me so just an Object of divine Vengeance I am not able to repeat the excellent Discourses of this extraordinary Man 'tis all that I am able to do to say that he reviv'd my Heart and brought me into such a Condition that I never knew any thing of in my Life before I was cover'd with Shame and Tears for things past and yet had at the same time a secret surprizing Joy at the Prospect of being a true Penitent and obtaining the Comfort of a Penitent I mean the hope of being forgiven and so swift did Thoughts circulate and so high did the impressions they had made upon me run that I thought I cou'd freely have gone out that Minute to Execution without any uneasiness at all casting my Soul entirely into the Arms of infinite Mercy as a Penitent  THE good Gentleman was so mov'd also in my behalf with a view of the influence which he saw these things had on me that he blessed God he had come to visit me and resolv'd not to leave me till  the last Moment that is not to leave visiting me  IT was no less than Days after our receiving Sentence before any were order'd for Execution and then upon a  Wednesday  the Dead Warrant  as they call it  came down and I found my Name was among them a terrible blow this was to my new Resolutions indeed my Heart sunk within me and I swoon'd away twice one after another but spoke not a word The good Minister was sorely Afflicted for me and did what he could to comfort me with the same Arguments and the same moving Eloquence that he did before and left me not that Evening so long as the Prisonkeepers would suffer him to stay in the Prison unless he wou'd be lock'd up with me all Night which he was not willing to be  I wonder'd much that I did not see him all the next Day  it being but the Day before the time appointed for Execution  and I was greatly discouraged and dejected in my Mind and indeed almost sunk for want of that Comfort which he had so often and with such Success yeilded me on his former Visits I waited with great impatience and under the greatest oppressions of Spirits imaginable till about four aClock he came to my Apartment for I had obtain'd the Favour by the help of Money nothing being to be done in that Place without it not to be kept in the Condemn'd Hole as they call it among the rest of the Prisoners who were to die but to have a little dirty Chamber to my self  MY Heart leap'd within me for Joy when I heard his Voice at the Door even before I saw him but let any one Judge what kind of Motion I found in my Soul when after having made a short excuse for his not coming he shew'd me that his time had been employ'd on my Account that he  had obtain'd a favourable Report from the Recorder to the Secretary of State in my particular Case and in short that he had brought me a Reprieve  HE us'd all the Caution that he was able in letting me know a thing which it would have been a double Cruelty to have conceal'd and yet it was too much for me for as Grief had overset me before so did Joy overset now and I fell into a much more dangerous Swooning than I did at first and it was not without a great Difficulty that I was recover'd at all  THE good Man having made a very Christian Exhortation to me not to let the Joy of my Reprieve put the Remembrance of my past Sorrow out of my Mind and having told me that he must leave me to go and enter the Reprieve in the Books and show it to the Sheriffs stood up just before his going away and in a very earnest Manner pray'd to God for me that my Repentance might be made Unfeign'd and Sincere and that my coming back as it were into Life again might not be a returning to the Follies of Life which I had made such solemn Resolutions to forsake and to repent of them I joyn'd heartily in the Petition and must needs say I had deeper Impressions upon my Mind all that Night of the Mercy of God in sparing my Life and a greater Detestation of my past Sins from a Sense of the goodness which I had tasted in this Case than I had in all my Sorrow before  THIS may be thought inconsistent in it self and wide from the Business of this Book Particularly I reflect that many of those who may be pleas'd and diverted with the Relation of the wild and wicked part of my Story may not relish this which is really the best part of my Life the most Advantageous to myself and the most  instructive to others such however will I hope allow me the liberty to make my Story compleat It would be a severe Satyr on such to say they do not relish the Repentance as much as they do the Crime and that they had rather the History were a compleat Tragedy as it was very likely to have been  BUT I go on with my Relation the next Morning there was a sad Scene indeed in the Prison the first thing I was saluted with in the Morning was the Tolling of the great Bell at St  Sepulchres  as they call it which usher'd in the Day As soon as it began to Toll a dismal groaning and crying was heard from the Condemn'd Hole where there lay six poor Souls who were to be Executed that Day some for one Crime some for another and two of them for Murther  THIS was follow'd by a confus'd Clamour in the House among the several sorts of Prisoners expressing their awkward Sorrows for the poor Creatures that were to die but in a manner extreamly differing one from another some cried for them some huzza'd and wish'd them a good Journey some damn'd and curst those that had brought them to it that is meaning the Evidence or Prosecutors many pittying them and some few but very few praying for them  THERE was hardly room for so much Composure of Mind as was requir'd for me to bless the merciful Providence that had as it were snatch'd me out of the Jaws of this Destruction I remained as it were Dumb and Silent overcome with the Sense of it and not able to express what I had in my Heart for the Passions on such Occasions as these are certainly so agitated as not to be able presently to regulate their own Motions  ALL the while the poor condemn'd Creatures were preparing to their Death and the  Ordinary  as they call him  was busy with them disposing them to submit to their Sentence I say all this while I was seiz'd with a fit of trembling as much as I cou'd have been if I had been in the same Condition as to be sure the Day before I expected to be▪ I was so violently agitated by this Surprising Fit that I shook as if it had been in the cold Fit of an Ague so that I could not speak or look but like one Distracted As soon as they were all put into the Carts and gone which however I had not Courage enough to see  I say  as soon as they were gone I fell into a fit of crying involuntarily and without Design but as a meer Distemper and yet so violent and it held me so long that I knew not what Course to take nor could I stop or put a Checque to it no not with all the Strength and Courage I had  THIS fit off crying held me near two Hours and as I believe held me till they were all out of the World and than a most humble Penitent serious kind of Joy succeeded a real transport it was or Passion of Joy and Thankfulness but still unable to give vent to it by Words and in this I continued most part of the Day  IN the Evening the Good Minister visisted me again and then fell to his usual good Discourses he Congratulated my having a space yet allow'd me for Repentance whereas the state of those six poor Creatures was determin'd and they were now pass'd the offers of Salvation he earnestly press'd me to retain the same Sentiments of the things of Life that I had when I had a view of Eternity and at the End of all told me I should not conclude that all was over that a Reprieve was not a Pardon that he could not yet answer for the Effects of it however I had this Mercy that I had more time given me and that it was my business to improve that time  THIS Discourse tho' very seasonable left a kind of sadness on my Heart as if I might expect the Affair would have a tragical Issue still which however he had no certainty of and I did not indeed at that time question him about it he having said that he would do his utmost to bring it to a good End and that he hoped he might but he would not have me secure and the Consequence prov'd that he had Reason for what he said  IT was about a Fortnight after this that I had some just Apprehensions that I should be included in the next dead Warrant at the ensuing Sessions and it was not without great difficulty and at last an humble Petition for Transportation that I avoided it so ill was I beholding to Fame and so prevailing was the fatal Report of being an old Offender tho' in that they did not do me strict Justice for I was not in the Sense of the Law an old Offender whatever I was in the Eye of the Judge for I had never been before them in a judicial way before so the Judges could not Charge me with being an old Offender but the Recorder was pleas'd to represent my Case as he thought fit  I HAD now a certainty of Life indeed but with the hard Conditions of being order'd for Transportation which indeed was a hard Condition in it self but not when comparatively considered and therefore I shall make no Comments upon the Sentence nor upon the Choice I was put to we shall all choose any thing rather than Death especially when 'tis attended with an uncomfortable prospect beyond it which was my Case  THE good Minister whose interest tho'  a Stranger to me  had obtain'd me the Reprieve mourn'd sincerely for this part he was in hopes  he said  that I should have ended my Days under the Influence of good Instruction that I might not have forgot my former Distresses and that I should not have been turned loose again among such a wretched a Crew as they generally are who are thus sent Abroad where  as he said  I must have more than ordinary secret Assistance from the Grace of God if I did not turn as wicked again as ever  I HAVE not for a good while mentioned my Governess who had during most if not all of this part been dangerously Sick and being in as near a view of Death by her Disease as I was by my Sentence was a very great Penitent I say I have not mention'd her nor indeed did I see her in all this time but being now recovering and just able to come Abroad she came to see me  I TOLD her my Condition and what a different flux and reflux of Fears and Hopes I had been agitated with I told her what I had escap'd and upon what Terms and she was present when the Minister express'd his fears of my relapsing into wickedness upon my falling into the wretch'd Companies that are generally Transported Indeed I had a melancholly Reflection upon it in my own Mind for I knew what a dreadful Gang was always sent away together and I said to my Governess that the good Minister's fears were not without Cause Well well  says she  but I hope you will not be tempted with such a horrid Example as that and as soon as the Minister was gone she told me she would not have me discourag'd for perhaps ways and means might be found out to dispose of me in a particular way by my self of which she would talk farther to me afterward  I LOOK'D earnestly at her and I thought she look'd more cheaful than she usually had done and I entertain'd immediately a Thousand Notions of being deliver'd but could not for my Life imagin the Methods or think of one that was in the least feizible but I was too much concerned in it to let her go from me without explaining herself which tho' she was very loth to do yet my importunity prevail'd and while I was still pressing she answer'd me in few Words thus Why  you have Money have you not  did you ever know one in your Life that was Transported and had a Hundred Pound in his Pocket I'll warrant you Child  says she    I UNDERSTOOD her presently but told her I would leave all that to her but I saw no room to hope for any thing but a strict Execution of the order and as it was a severity that was esteem'd a Mercy there was no doubt but it would be strictly observ'd she said no more but this  we will try what can be done  and so we parted for that Night  I LAY in the Prison near fifteen Weeks after this order for Transportation was sign'd what the Reason of it was I know not but at the end of this time I was put on Board of a Ship in the  Thames  and with me a Gang of Thirteen as harden'd vile Creatures as ever  Newgate  produc'd in my time and it would really well take up a History longer than mine to describe the degrees of Impudence and audacious Villany that those Thirteen were arriv'd to and the manner of their behaviour in the Voyage of which I have a very diverting Account by me which the Captain of the Ship who carried them over gave me the Minutes of and which he caus'd his Mate to write down at large  IT may perhaps be thought Trifling to enter here into a Relation of all the little incidents which attended me in this interval of my Circumstances I mean between the final order for my Transportation and the time of my going on board the Ship and I am too near the End of my Story to allow room for it but something relating to me  and my Lancashire Husband  I must not omit  HE had  as I have observ'd already  been carried from the Master's side of the ordinary Prison into the PressYard with three of his Comrades for they found another to add to them after some time here for what Reason I knew not they were kept in Custody without being brought to Tryal almost three Months it seems they found means to Bribe or buy off some of those who were expected to come in against them and they wanted Evidence some time to Convict them After some puzzle on for this Account at first they made a shift to get proof enough against two of them to carry them off but the other two of which my  Lancashire  Husband was one lay still in Suspence They had I think one positive Evidence against each of them but the Law strictly obliging them to have two Witnesses they cou'd make nothing of it yet it seems they were resolv'd not to part with the Men neither not doubting but a farther Evidence would at last come in and in order to this I think Publication was made that such Prisoners being taken any one that had been robb'd by them might come to the Prison and see them  I TOOK this opportunity to satisfy my Curiosity pretending that I had been robb'd in the  Dunstable  Coach and that I would go to see the two HighwayMen but when I came into the PressYard I so disguis'd myself and muffled  my Face up so that he cou'd see litile of me and consequently knew nothing of who I was and when I came back I said publickly that I knew them very well  IMMEDIATELY it was Rumour'd all over the Prison that  Moll Flanders  would turn Evidence against one of the Highway Men and that I was to come off by it from the Sentence of Transportation  THEY heard of it and immediately my Husband desir'd to see this Mrs  Flanders  that knew him so well and was to be an Evidence against him and accordingly I had leave given to go to him I dress'd myself up as well as the best Cloths that I suffer'd myself ever to appear in there would allow me and went to the Pressyard but had for some time a Hood over my Face he said little to me at first but ask'd me if I knew him I told him yes very well but as I conceal'd my Face so I Counterfeited my Voice that he had not the least guess at who I was He ask'd me where I had seen him I told him between  Dunstable  and  Brickhill  but turning to the Keeper that stood by I ask'd if I might not be admitted to talk with him alone he said yes yes as much as I pleas'd and so very civilly withdrew  AS soon as he was gone and I had shut the Door I threw off my Hood and bursting out into Tears  my Dear  says I  do you not know me  He turn'd pale and stood Speechless like one Thunder struck and not able to conquer the Surprize said no more but this  let me sit down  and sitting down by a Table he laid his Elbow upon the Table and leaning his Head on his Hand fix'd his Eyes on the Ground as one stupid I cry'd so vehemently on the other Hand that it was a good  while ee'r I could speak any more but after I had given some vent to my Passion by Tears I repeated the same Words MY DEAR  do you not know me  at which he answer'd YES and said no more a good while  AFTER some time continuing in the Surprize  as above  he cast up his Eyes towards me and said  How could you be so cruel  I did not readily understand what he meant and I answer'd How can you call me Cruel What have I been Cruel to you in  To come to me  says he  in such a Place as this is it not to insult me I have not robb'd  you  at least not on  the Highway  I PERCEIV'D by this that he knew nothing of the miserable Circumstances I was in and thought that having got some Intelligence of his being there I had come to upbraid him with his leaving me but I had too much to say to him to be affronted and told him in few Words that I was far from coming to Insult him but at best I came to Condole mutually that he would be easily satisfy'd that I had no such View when I should tell him that  my Condition was worse than his and that many ways  He look'd a little concern'd at the general Expression of my Condition being worse than his but with a kind of a smile look'd a little wildly and said How can that be when you see me Feter'd and in  Newgate  and two of my Companions Executed already can you say your Condition is worse than Mine  COME my Dear  says I  we have a long peice of Work to do if I should be to relate or you to hear my unfortunate History but if you are dispos'd to hear it you will soon conclude with me that my Condition is worse than yours How is that possible  says he again  when I expect to be  cast for my Life the very next Sessions Yes  says I  'tis very possible when I shall tell you that I have been cast for my Life three Sessions ago and am under Sentence of Death is not my Case worse than yours  THEN indeed he stood silent again like one struck Dumb and after a little while he starts up unhappy Couple  says he  How can this be possible I took him by the Hand come MY DEAR  said I  sit down and let us compare our Sorrows I am a Prisoner in this very House and in a much worse Circumstance than you and you will be satisfy'd I do not come to Insult you when I tell you the particulars and with this we sat down together and I told him so much of my Story as I thought was convenient bringing it at last to my being reduc'd to great Poverty and representing myself as fallen into some Company that led me to relieve my Distresses by a way that I had been utterly unacquainted with and that they making an attempt at a Tradesman's House I was seiz'd upon for having been but just at the Door the MaidServant pulling me in that I neither had broke any Lock or taken any thing away and that notwithstanding that I was brought in Guilty and Sentenc'd to Die but that the Judges having been made sensible of the Hardship of my Circumstances had obtain'd leave to remit the Sentence upon my consenting to be transported  I TOLD him I far'd the worse for being taken in the Prison for one  Moll Flanders  who was a famous successful Thief that all of them had heard of but none of them had ever seen but that  as he knew well  was none of my Name but I plac'd all to the account of my ill Fortune and that under  this Name I was dealt with as an old Offender tho' this was the first thing they had ever known of me I gave him a long particular of things that had befallen me since I saw him but I told him if I had seen him since he might think I had and then gave him an Account how I had seen him at  Brickhill  how furiously he was ursued and how by giving an Account that I knew him and that he was a very honest Gentleman one Mr the  Heu and Cry  was stopp'd and the High Constable went back again  HE listen'd most attentively to all my Story▪ and smil'd at most of the particulars being all of them petty Matters and infinitely below what he had been at the Head of but when I came to the Story of little  Brickill  he was surpriz'd  and was it you my Dear  said he  that gave the Check to the Mob that was at our Heels there  at  Brickill  Yes  said I  it was I indeed and then I told him the particulars which I had observ'd of him there  Why then  said he  it was you that sav'd my Life at that time  and I am glad I owe my Life to you for I will pay the Debt to you now and I'll deliver you from the present Condition you are in or I will die in the attempt  I TOLD him by no means it was a Risque too great not worth his running the hazard of and for a Life not worth his saving 'twas no matter for that he said it was a Life worth all the World to him a Life that had given him a new Life for  says he  I was never in real Danger of being taken but that time till the last Minute when I was taken Indeed  he told  me his Danger then lay in his believing he had not been pursued that way for they had gone off from  Hockly  quite another way and had come over the enclos'd Country  into  Brickill  not by the Road and were sure they had not been seen by any Body  HERE he gave a long History of his Life which indeed would make a very strange History and be infinitely diverting He told me he took to the Road about twelve Year before he marry'd me that the Woman which call'd him Brother was not really his Sister or any Kin to him but one that belong'd to their Gang and who keeping Correspondence with them liv'd always in Town having good store of Acquaintance that she gave them a perfect Intelligence of Persons going out of Town and that they had made several good Booties by her Correspondence that she thought she had fix'd a Fortune for him when she brought me to him but happen'd to be Disappointed which he really could not blame her for▪ That if it had been his good Luck that I had had the Estate which she was inform'd I had he had resolv'd to leave off the Road and live a retired sober Life but never to appear in publick till some general Pardon had been pass'd or till he could for Money have got his Name into some particularlar Pardon that so he might have been perfectly easy but that as it had proved otherwise he was oblig'd to put off his Equipage and take up the old Trade again  HE gave me a long Account of some of his Adventures and particularly one when he robb'd the  West Chester  Coaches near  Lichfield  when he got a very great Booty and after that how he robb'd five Grasiers in the  West  going to  Burford  Fair in  Wiltshire  to buy Sheep he told me he got so much Money on those two Occasions that if he had known where to have found me he would certainly have embrac'd my Proposal of  going with me to  Virgina  or to have settled in a Plantation on some other Parts of the  English  Colonies in  America    HE told me he wrote two or three Letters to me directed according to my Order but heard nothing from me This I indeed knew to be true but the Letters coming to my Hand in the time of my latter Husband I could do nothing in it and therefore chose to give no answer that so he might rather believe they had miscarried  BEING thus Disappointed  he said  he carried on the old Trade ever since tho' when he had gotten so much Money  he said  he did not run such desperate Risques as he did before then he gave me some Account of several hard and desperate Encounters which he had with Gentlemen on the Road who parted too hardly with their Money and shew'd me some Wounds he had receiv'd and he had one or two very terrible Wounds indeed as particularly one by a Pistol Bullet which broke his Arm and another with a Sword which ran him quite thro' the Body but that missing his Vitals he was cur'd again one of his Comrades having kept with him so faithfully and so Friendly as that he assisted him in riding near Miles before his Arm was Set and then got a Surgeon in a considerable City remote from that Place where it was done pretending they were Gentlemen Traveling towards  Carlisle  and that they had been attack'd on the Road by HighwayMen and that one of them had shot him into the Arm and broke the Bone  THIS  he said  his Friend manag'd so well that they were not suspected at all but lay still till he was perfectly cur'd He gave me so many distinct Accounts of his Adventures that it is with  great reluctance that I decline the relating them but I consider that this is my own Story not his  I THEN enquir'd into the Circumstances of his present Case at that time and what it was he expected when he came to be try'd he told me that they had no Evidence against him or but very little for that of three Roberries which they were all Charg'd with it was his good Fortune that he was but in one of them and that there was but one Witness to be had for that F  ct which was not sufficient but that it was expected some others would come in against him that he thought indeed when he first see me that I had been one that came of that Errand but that if no Body came in against him he hop'd he should be clear'd that he had had some intimation that if he would submit to Transport himself he might be admitted to it without a Tryal but that he could not think of it with any Temper and thought he could much easier submit to be Hang'd  I BLAM'D him for that and told him I blam'd him on two Accounts first because if he was Transported there might be an Hundred ways for him that was a Gentleman and a bold enterprizing Man to find his way back again and perhaps some Ways and Means to come back before he went He smil'd at that Part and said he should like the last the best of the two for he had a kind of Horror upon his Mind at his being sent over to the Plantations as  Romans  sent condemn'd Slaves to Work in the Mines that he thought the Passage into another State let it be what it would much more tolerable at the Gallows and that this was the general Notion of all the Gentlemen who were  driven by the Exigence of their Fortunes to take the Road that at the Place of Execution there was at least an End of all the Miseries of the present State and as for what was to follow a Man was in his Opinion as likely to Repent sincerely in the last Fortnight of his Life under the Pressures and Agonies of a Jayl and the condemn'd Hole as he would ever be in the Woods and Wildernesses of  America  that Servitude and hard Labour were things Gentlemen could never stoop to that it was but the way to force them to be their own Executioners afterwards which was much worse and that therefore he could not have any Patience when he did but think of being Transported  I USED the utmost of my endeavour to perswade him and joyn'd that known Womans Rhetorick to it I mean that of Tears I told him the Infamy of a publick Execution was certainly a greater pressure upon the Spirits of a Gentleman than any of the Mortifications that he could meet with Abroad could be that he had at least in the other a Chance for his Life whereas here he had none at all that it was the easiest thing in the World for him to manage the Captain of the Ship who were generally speaking Men of good Humour and some Gallantry and a small matter of Conduct especially if there was any Money to be had would make way for him to buy himself off when he came to  Virginia    HE look'd withfully at me and I thought I guess'd at what he meant  that is to say  that he had no Money but I was mistaken his meaning was another way  you hinted just now  my Dear said he that there might be a way of coming back before I went by which I understood  you that it might  be possible to buy it off here I had rather give    l to prevent going than    l to be set at Liberty when I came there  That is my Dear said I  because you do not know the Place so well as I do  that may be said he  and yet I believe as well as you know it you would do the same unless it is because  as you told me  you have a Mother there    I TOLD him as to my Mother it was next to impossible but that she must be dead many Years before and as for any other Relations that I might have there I knew them not now That since the Misfortunes I had been under had reduc'd me to the Condition I had been in for some Years I had not kept up any Correspondence with them and that he would easily believe I should find but a cold Reception from them if I should be put to make my first visit in the Condition of a Transported Felon that therefore if I went thither I resolv'd not to see them But that I had many Views in going there if it should be my Fate which took off all the uneasy Part of it and if he found himself oblig'd to go also I should easily Instruct him how to manage himself so as never to go a Servant at all especially since I found he was not destitute of Money which was the only Friend in such a Condition  HE smil'd and said he did not tell me he had Money I took him up short and told him I hop'd he did not understand by my speaking that I should expect any supply from him if he had Money that on the other Hand tho' I had not a great deal yet I did not want and while I had any I would rather add to him than weaken him in that Article seeing what ever he had I knew in the Case of Transportation he would have Occasion of it all  HE express'd himself in a most tender manner upon that Head he told me what Money he had was not a great deal but that he would never hide any of it from me if I wanted it and that he assur'd me he did not speak with any such Apprehensions that he was only intent upon what I had hinted to him before he went that here he knew what to do with himself but there he should be the most ignorant helpless Wretch alive  I TOLD him he frighted and terify'd himself with that which had no Terror in it that if he had Money as I was glad to hear he had he might not only avoid the Servitude suppos'd to be the Consequence of Transportation but begin the World upon a new Foundation and that such a one as he cou'd not fail of Success in with but the the common Application usual in such Cases that he could not but call to Mind that it was what I had recommended to him many Years before and had propos'd it for our mutual Subsistence and restoring our Fortunes in the World and I would tell him now that to convince him both of the certainty of it and of my being fully acquainted with the Method and also fully satisfy'd in the probability of Success he should first see me deliver myself from the Necessity of going over at all and then that I would go with him freely and off my own Choice and perhaps carry enough with me to satisfy him that I did not offer it for want of being able to live without Assistance from him but that I thought our mutual Misfortunes had been such as were sufficient to Reconcile us both to quitting this part of the World and living where no Body could upbraid us with what was past or we be in any dread of a Prison and without the Agonies of a condemn'd Hole to drive us to it this where  we should look back on all our past Disasters with infinite Satisfaction when we should consider that our Enemies should entirely forget us and that we should live as new People in a new World no Body having any thing to say to us or we to them  I PRESS'D this Home to him with so many Arguments and answer'd all his own passionate Objections so effectually that he embrac'd me and told me I treated him with such a Sincerity and Affection as overcame him that he would take my Advice and would strive to submit to his Fate in hope of having the comfort of my Assistance and of so faithful a Counsellor and such a Companion in his Misery but still he put me in mind of what I had mention'd before Namely that there might be some way to get off before he went and that it might be possible to avoid going at all which he said would be much better I told him he should see and be fully satisfy'd that I would do my utmost in that Part too and if it did not succeed yet that I would make good the rest  WE parted after this long Conference with such Testimonies of Kindness and Affection as I thought were Equal if not Superior to that at our parting at  Dunstable  and now I saw more plainly than before the Reason why he declin'd coming at that time any farther with me toward  London  than  Dunstable  and why when we parted there he told me it was not convenient for him to come part of the way to  London  to bring me going as he would otherwise have done▪ I have observ'd that the Account of his Life would have made a much more pleasing History than this of mine and indeed nothing in it was more strange  than this Part  viz  that he had carried on that desperate Trade full five and Twenty Year and had never been taken the Success he had met with had been so very uncommon and such that sometimes he had liv'd handsomely and retir'd in one Place for a Year or two at a time keeping himself and a ManServant to wait on him and has often sat in the CoffeeHouses and heard the very People who he had robb'd give Accounts of their being robb'd and of the Places and Circumstances so that he cou'd easily remember that it was the same  IN this manner it seems he liv'd near  Leverpool  at the time he unluckily married me for a Fortune Had I been the Fortune he expected I verily believe as he said that he would have taken up and liv'd honestly all his Days  HE had with the rest of his Misfortunes the good luck not to be actually upon the spot when the Robbery was done which the was committed for and so none of the Persons robb'd cou'd swear to him or had any thing to Charge upon him but it seems as he was taken with the Gang one hardmouth'd Countryman swore home to him and they were like to have others come in according to the Publication they had made so that they expected more Evidence against him and for that Reason he was kept in hold  HOWEVER the offer which was made to him of admitting him to Transportation was made as I understood upon the intercession of some great Person who press'd him hard to accept of it before a Tryal and indeed as he knew there were several that might come in against him I thought his Friend was in the Right and I lay at him Night and Day to delay it no longer  AT last with much difficulty he gave his consent and as he was not therefore admitted to Transportation in Court and on his Petition as I was so he found himself under a difficulty to avoid embarking himself as I had said he might have done his great Friend who was his Interrcessor for the Favour of that Grant having given Security for him that he should Transport himself and not return within the Term  THIS hharship broke all my Measurers for the steps I took afterwards for my own deliverance were hereby render'd wholly ineffectual unlels I would abandon him and leave him to go to  America  by himself than which he protested he would much rather venture altho' he were certain to go directly to the Gallows  I must now return to my own Case the time of my being Transporred according to my Sentence was near at Hand my Governess who continu'd my fast Friend had try'd to obtain a Pardon but it could not be done unless with an Expence too heavy for my Purse considering that to be left naked and empty unless I had resolv'd to return to my old Trade again had been worse than my Transportation because there I knew I could live here I could not The good Minister stood very hard on another Account to prevent my being Transported also but he was answer'd that indeed my Life had been given me at his first Solicitations and therefore he ought to ask no more he was sensibly griev'd at my going because  as he said  he fear'd I should lose the good impressions which a prospect of Death had at first made on me and which were since encreas'd by his Instructions and the pious Gentleman was exceedingly concern'd about me on that Account  ON the other Hand I really was not so sollicitous about it as I was before but I industriously conceal'd my Reasons for it from the Minister and to the last he did not know but that I went with the utmost reluctance and affliction  IT was in the Month of  February  that I was with seven other Convicts  as they call'd us  deliver'd to a Merchant that Traded to  Virginia  on board a Ship riding as they call'd it in  Deptford  Reach The Officer of the Prison deliver'd us on board and the Master of the Vessel gave a Discharge for us  WE were for that Night clapt under Hatches and kept so close that I thought I should have been suffocated for want of Air and the next Morning the Ship weigh'd and fell down the River to a Place they call  Bugby's Hole  which was done as they told us by the agreement of the Merchant that all opportunity of Escape should be taken from us However when the Ship came thither and cast Anchor we were allow'd more Liberty and particularly were permitted to come upon the Deck but not upon the QuarterDeck that being kept particularly for the Captain and for Passengers  WHEN by the Noise of the Men over my Head and the Motion of the Ship I perceiv'd that they were under Sail I was at first greatly surpriz'd fearing we should go away directly and that our Friends would not be admitted to see us any more but I was easy soon after when I found they had come to an Anchor again and soon after that we had Notice given by some of the Men where we were that the next Morning we should have the Liberty to come upon  Deck and to have our Friends come and see us if we had any  ALL that Night I lay upon the hard Boards of the Deck as the other Prisoners did but we had afterwards the Liberty of little Cabins for such of us as had any Bedding to lay in them and room to stow any Box or Trunk for Cloths and Linnen if we had it which might well be put in for some of them had neither Shirt or Shift or a Rag of Linnen or Woollen but what was on their Backs or a Farthing of Money to help themselves and yet I did not find but they far'd well enough in the Ship especially the Women who got Money of the Seamen for washing their Cloths sufficient to purchase any common things that they wanted  WHEN the next Morning we had the liberty to come upon the Deck I ask'd one of the Officers of the Ship whether I might not have the liberty to send a Letter on Shore to let my Friends know where the Ship lay and to get some necessary things sent to me This was it seems the Boatswain a very civil courteous sort of Man who told me I should have that or any other liberty that I desir'd that he could allow me with Safety I told him I desir'd no other and he answer'd that the Ships Boat would go up to  London  the next Tide and he would order my Letter to be carried  ACCORDINGLY when the Boat went off the Boatswain came to me and told me the Boat was going off and that he went in it himself and ask'd me if my Letter was ready he would take care of it I had prepared myself you may be sure Pen Ink and Paper beforehand and I had gotten a Letter ready directed to my Governess and  enclos'd another for my fellow Prisoner which however I did not let her know was my Husband not to the last in that to my Governess I let her know where the Ship lay and press'd her earnestly to send me what things I knew she had got ready for me for my Voyage  WHEN I gave the Boatswain the Letter I gave him a Shilling with it which I told him was for the Charge of a Messenger or Porter which I entreated him to send with the Letter as soon as he came on Shore that if possible I might have an Answer brought back by the same Hand that I might know what was become of my things for SIR  says I  if the Ship should go away before I have them on Board I am undone  I TOOK care when I gave him the Shilling to let him him see that I had a little better Furniture about me than the ordinary Prisoners for he saw that I had a Purse and in it a pretty deal of Money and I found that the very sight of it immediately furnish'd me with very different Treatment from what I should otherwise have met with in the Ship for tho' he was very Courteous indeed before in a kind of natural Compassion to me as a Woman in distress yet he was more than ordinarily so afterwards and procur'd me to be better treated in the Ship than  I say  I might otherwise have been as shall appear in its Place  HE very honestly had my Letter deliver'd to my Governess own Hands and brought me back an Answer from her in writing and when he gave me the Answer gave me the Shilling again  there  says he there's your Shilling again too for I deliver'd the Letter my self I could not tell what to say I was so surpris'd at the thing but after  some Pause  I said  Sir you are too kind it had been but Reasonable that you had paid yourself Coach hire then  No no  says he  I am over paid What is the Gentlewoman your Sister  NO SIR  said I  she is no Relation to me but she is a dear Friend and all the Friends I have in the World well  says he  there are few such Friends in the World why she cryes after you like a Child Ay  says I again  she would give a Hundred Pound I believe to deliver me from this dreadful Condition I am in  WOULD she so  says he  for half the Money I believe I cou'd put you in a way how to deliver yourself but this he spoke softly that no Body cou'd hear  Alas SIR  said I  but then that must be such a Deliverance as if I should be taken again would cost me my Life Nay  said he  if you were once out of the Ship you must look to yourself afterwards that I can say nothing to so we drop'd the Discourse for that time  IN the mean time my Governess faithful to the last Moment convey'd my Letter to the Prison to my Husband and got an Answer to it and the next Day came down herself to the Ship bringing me in the first Place a  SeaBed  as they call it and all its Furniture such as was convenient but not to let the People think it was extraordinary she brought with her a  SeaChest  that is a Chest such as are made for Seamen with all the Conveniencies in it and fill'd with every thing almost that I could want and in one of the corners of the Chest where there was a private Drawer was my Bank of Money  that is to say  so much of it as I had resolv'd to carry with me for I order'd a part of my Stock to be left behind  me to be sent afterwards in such Goods as I should want when I came to settle for Money in that Country is not of much use where all things are bought for Tobacco much more is it a great loss to carry it from Hence  BUT my Case was particular it was by no Means proper to me to go thither without Money or Goods and for a poor Convict that was to be sold as soon as I came on Shore to carry with me a Cargo of Goods would be to have Notice taken of it and perhaps to have them seiz'd by the Publick so I took part of my Stock with me thus and left the other part with my Governess  MY Governess brought me a great many other things but it was not proper for me to look too well provided in the Ship at least till I knew what kind of a Captain we should have When she came into the Ship I thought she would have died indeed her Heart sunk at the sight of me and at the thoughts of parting with me in that Condition and she cry'd so intolerably I cou'd not for a long time have any talk with her  I TOOK that time to read my fellow Prisoners Letter which however greatly perplex'd me he told me he was determin'd to go but found it would be impossible for him to be Discharg'd time enough for going in the same Ship and which was more than all he began to question whether they would give him leave to go in what Ship he pleas'd tho' he did voluntarily Transport himself but that they would see him put on Board such a Ship as they should direct and that he would be charg'd upon the Captain as other convict Prisoners were so that he began to be in dispair of seeing me till he came to  Virgina  which made him almost desperate seeing that on the other  Hand if I should not be there if any Accident of the Sea or of Mortality should take me away he should be the most undone Creature there in the World  THIS was very perplexing and I knew not what Course to take I told my Governess the Story of the Boatswain and she was mighty eager with me to treat with him but I had no mind to it till I heard whether my Husband or fellow Prisoner  so she call'd him  cou'd be at liberty to go with me or no at last I was forc'd to let her into the whole matter except only that of his being my Husband I told her I had made a positive Bargain or Agreement with him to go if he could get the liberty of going in the same Ship and that I found he had Money  THEN I read a long Lecture to her of what I propos'd to do when we came there how we could Plant Settle and in short grow Rich without any more Adventures and as a great Secret I told her that we were to Marry as soon as he came on Board  SHE soon agreed chearfully to my going when she heard this and she made it her business from that time to get him out of the Prison in time so that he might go in the same Ship with me which at last was brought to pass tho' with great difficulty and not without all the Forms of a Transported Prisoner  Convict  which he really was not yet for he had not been try'd and which was a great Mortification to him As our Fate was now determin'd and we were both on Board actually bound to  Virginia  in the despicable Quality of Transported Convicts destin'd to be sold for Slaves I for five Year and he under Bonds and Security not to return to  England  any more  as long as he liv'd he was very much dejected and cast down the Mortification of being brought on Board as he was like a Prisoner piqu'd him very much since it was first told him he should Transport himself and so that he might go as a Gentleman at liberty it is true he was not order'd to be sold when he came there as we were and for that Reason he was oblig'd to pay for his Passage to the Captain which we were not as to the rest he was as much at a loss as a Child what to do with himself or with what he had but by Directions  OUR first business was to compare our Stock He was very honest to me and told me his Stock was pretty good when he came into the Prison but the living there as he did in a Figure like a Gentleman  and which was ten times as much  the making of Friends and soliciting his Case had been very Expensive and in a Word all his Stock that he had left was an Hundred and Eight Pounds which he had about him all in Gold  I GAVE him an Account of my Stock as faithfully that is to say of what I had taken to carry with me for I was resolv'd what ever should happen to keep what I had left with my Governess in Reserve that in Case I should die what I had with me was enough to give him and that which was left in my Governess Hands would be her own which she had well deserv'd of me indeed  MY Stock which I had with me was two Hundred forty six Pounds some odd Shillings so that we had three Hundred and fifty four Pound between us but a worse gotten Estate was scarce ever put together to begin the World with  OUR greatest Misfortune as to our Stock was that it was all in Money which every one knows is an unprofitable Cargoe to be carryed to the Plantations I believe his was really all he had left in the World as he told me it was but I who had between seven and eight Hundred Pounds in Bank when this Disaster befel me and who had one of the faithfulest Friends in the World to manage it for me considering she was a Woman of no manner of Religious Principles had still Three Hundred Pounds left in her Hand which I reserv'd as above besides some very valuable things as particularly two gold Watches some small Peices of Plate and some Rings all stolen Goods the Plate Rings and Watches were put up in my Chest with the Money and with this Fortune and in the Sixty first Year of my Age I launch'd out into a new World as I may call it in the Condition as to what appear'd only of a poor nak'd Convict order'd to be Trasported in respite from the Gallows my Cloaths were poor and mean but not ragged or dirty and none knew in the whole Ship that I had any thing of value about me  HOWEVER as I had a great many very good Cloaths and Linnen in abundance which I had order'd to be pack'd up in two great Boxes I had them Shipp'd on Board not as my Goods but as consign'd to my real Name in  Virginia  and had the Bills of Loading sign'd by a Captain in my Pocket and in these Boxes was my Plate and Watches and every thing of value except my Money which I kept by itself in a private Drawer in my Chest which cou'd not be found or open'd if found without splitting the Chest to peices  IN this Condition I lay for three Weeks in the Ship not knowing whether I should have my Husband with me or no and therefore not resolving how or in what manner to receive the honest Boatswain's proposal which indeed he thought a little strange at first  AT the End of this time behold my Husband came on Board he look'd with a dejected angry Countenance his great Heart was swell'd with Rage and Disdain to be drag'd along with three Keepers of  Newgate  and put on Board like a Convict when he had not so much as been brought to a Tryal he made loud complaints of it by his Friends for it seems he had some interest but his Friends got some Checque in their Application and were told he had had  Favour enough  and that they had receiv'd such an Account of him since the last Grant of his Transportation that he ought to think himself very well treated that he was not prosecuted a new This answer quieted him at once for he knew too much what might have happen'd and what he had room to expect and now he saw the goodness of the Advice to him which prevail'd with him to accept of the offer of a voluntary Transportation and after his chagrine at these Hell Hounds  as he call'd them  was a little over he look'd a little compos'd began to be chearful and as I was telling him how glad I was to have him once more out of their Hands took me in his Arms and acknowledg'd with great Tenderness that I had given him the best Advice possible  My Dear  says he  Thou hast twice sav'd my Life from hence forward it shall be all employ'd for you and I'll always take your Advice    THE Ship began now to fill several Passengers came on Board who were embark'd on no Criminal account and these had Accommodations assign'd them in the great Cabbin and other Parts of the Ship whereas we  as Convicts  were thrust down below I know not where but when my Husband came on Board I spoke to the Boatswain who had so early given me Hints of his Friendship in carrying my Letter I told him he had befriended me in many things and I had not made any suitable Return to him and with that I put a Guinea into his Hands I told him that my Husband was now come on Board that tho' we were both under the present Misfortunes yet we had been Persons of a differing Character from the wretched Crew that we came with and desir'd to know of him whether the Captain might not be mov'd to admit us to some Conveniences in the Ship for which we would make him what Satisfaction he pleas'd and that we would gratifie him for his Pains in procuring this for us He took the Guinea as I cou'd see with great Satisfaction and assur'd me of his Assistance  THEN he told us he did not doubt but that the Captain who was one of the best humour'd Gentlemen in the World would be easily brought to Accommodate us as well as we cou'd desire and to make me easie told me he would go up the next Tide on purpose to speak to the Captain about it The next Morning happening to sleep a little longer than ordinary when I got up and began to look Abroad I saw the Boatswain among the Men in his ordinary Business I was a little melancholly at seeing him there and going forwards to speak to him he saw me and  came towards me but not giving him time to speak first I said smiling  I doubt Sir you have forgot us  for I see you are very busy he return'd presently come a long with me and you shall see so he took me into the great Cabbin and there sat a good sort of a Gentlemanly Man for a Seaman writing and with a great many Papers before him  HERE says the Boatswain to him that was a writing is the Gentlewoman that the Captain spoke to you of and turning to me he said I have been so far from forgetting your Business that I have been up at the Captain's House and have represented faithfully to the Captain what you said relating to your being furnished with better Conveniences for your self and your Husband and the Captain has sent this Gentleman who is Mate of the Ship down with me on purpose to show you every thing and to Accommodate you fully to your Content and bid me assure you that you shall not be treated like what you were at first expected to be but with the same respect as other Passengers are treated  THE Mate then spoke to me and not giving me time to thank the Boatswain for his kindness confirmd what the Boatswain had said and added that it was the Captain's delight to show himself Kind and Charitable especially to those that were under any Misfortunes and with that he sh  w'd me several Cabbins built up some in the Great Cabbin and s  me partition'd off out of the Stoorage but opening into the great Cabbin on purpose for the Accommodation of Passengers and gave me leave to chose where I would however I close a Cabbin which open'd into the  Steerage in which was very good Conveniencies to set our Chest and Boxes▪ and a Table to eat on  THE Mate then told me that the Boatswain had given so good a Character of me and of my Husband as to our civil Behaviour that he had orders to tell me we should eat with him if we thought sit during the whole Voyage on the common Terms of Passengers that we might lay in some fresh Provisions if we pleas'd or if not he should lay in his usual Store and we should have Share with him This was very reviving News to me after so many Hardships and Afflictions as I had gone thro' of late I thank'd him and told him the Captain should make his own Terms with us and ask'd him leave to go and tell my Husband of it who was not very well and was not yet out of his Cabbin Accordingly I went and my Husband whose Spirits were still so much sunk with the Indignity as he understood it offered him that he was scarce yet himself was so reviv'd with the Account I gave him of the Reception we were like to have in the Ship that he was quite another Man and new vigour and Courage appear'd in his very Countenance so true is it that the greatest of Spirits when overwhelm'd by their Afflictions are subject to the greatest Dejections and are the most apt to Despair and give themselves up  AFTER some little Pause to recover himself my Husband come up with me and gave the Mate thanks for the kindness which he had express'd to us and sent suitable acknowledgement by him to the Captain offering to pay him by Advance what ever the demanded for our Passage and for the Conveniences he had help'd us to the Mate told him that the Captain would be on  Board in the Afternoon and that he would leave all that till he came accordingly in the Afternoon the Captain came and we found him the same courteous obliging Man that the Boatswain had representd him to be and he was so well pleas'd with my Husband's Conversation that in short he would not let us keep the Cabbin we had chosen but gave us one that as I said before open'd into the great Cabbin  NOR were his Conditions exorbitant or the Man craving and eager to make a Prey of us but for fifteen Guineas we had our whole Passage and Provisions and Cabbin eat at the Captain's Table and where very handsomely Entertain'd  THE Captain lay himself in the other part of the Great Cabbin having let his round House  as they call it  to a rich Planter who went over with his Wife and three Children who eat by themselves he had some other ordinary Passengers who Quarter'd in the Steerage and as for our old Fraternity they were kept under the Hatches while the Ship lay there and came very little on the Deck  I COULD not refrain acquainting my Governess with what had happen'd it was but just that she who was so really concern'd for me should have part in my good Fortune besides I wanted her Assistance to supply me with several Necessaries which before I was shy of letting any Body see me have that it might not be publick but now I had a Cabbin and room to set things in I order'd abundance of gnod things for our Comfort in the Voyage as Brandy Sugar Lemons  c  to make Punch and Treat our Benefactor the Captain and abundance of things for eating and drinking in the Voyage also a larger  Bed and Bedding proportion'd to it so that in a Word we resolv'd to want for nothing in the Voyage  ALL this while I had provided nothing for our Assistance when we should come to the Place and begin to call ourselves Planters and I was far from being ignorant of what was needful on that Occasion particularly all sorts of Tools for the PlantersWork and for building and all kinds of Furniture for our Dwelling which if to be bought in the Country must necessarily cost double the Price  So I discours'd that Point with my Governess and she went and waited upon the Captain and told him that she hop'd ways might be found out for her two unfortunate Cousins  as she call'd us  to obtain our Freedom when we came into the Country and so enter'd into a Discourse with him about the Means and Terms also of which I shall say more in its Place and after thus sounding the Captain she let him know tho' we were unhappy in the Circumstance that occasion'd our going yet that we were not unfurnish'd to set our selves to Work in the Country and were resolv'd to settle and live there as Planters▪ if we might be put in a way how to do it The Captain readily offer'd his Assistance told her the Method of entering upon such Business and how easy nay how certain it was for industrious People to recover their Fortunes in such a manner Madam  says he  'tis no Reproach to any Man in that Country to have been sent over in worse Circumstances than I perceive your Cousins are in provided they do but apply with diligence and good Judgment to the Business of that Place when they come there  SHE then enquir'd of him what things it was Necessary we should carry over with us and he like a very honest as well as knowing Man told her thus Madam your Cousins in the first Place must procure some Body to buy them as Servants in Conformity to the Conditions of their Transportation and then in the Name of that Person they may go about what they will they may either Purchase some Plantations already begun or they may purchase Land of the Government of the Country and begin where they please and both will be done reasonably she bespoke his Favour in the first Article which he promis'd to her to take upon himself and indeed faithfull perform'd it and as to the rest he promis'd to recomend us to such as should give us the best Advice and not to impose upon us which was as much as could be desir'd  SHE then ask'd him if it would not be Necessary to furnish us with a Stock of Tools and Materials for the Business of Planting and he said yes by all means and then she begg'd his Assistance in it she told him she would furnish us with every thing that was Convenient whatever it cost her he accordingly gave her a long particular of things Necessary for a Planter which by his Account came to about fourscore or an Hundred Pounds and in short she went about as dexterously to buy them as if she had been an old  Virgina  Merchant only that she bought by my Direction above twice as much of every thing as he had given her a List of  THESE she put on Board in her own Name took his Bills of Loading for them and Endorst those Bills of Loading to my Husband Ensuring the Cargo afterwards in her own Name by our order  so that we were provided for all Events and for all Disasters  I SHOULD have told you that my Husband gave her all his whole Stock of  l  which as I have said he had about him in Gold to lay out thus and I gave her a good Sum besides so that I did not break into the Stock which I had left in her Hands at all but after we had sorted out our whole Cargo we had yet near  l  in Money which was more than enough for our purpose  IN this Condition very chearful and indeed joyful at being so happily Accommodated as we were we set Sail from  Bugby'sHole  to  Gravesend  where the Ship lay about ten Days more and where the Captain came on Board for good and all Here the Captain offer'd us a civility which indeed we had no Reason to expect Namely to let us go on Shore and refresh ourselves upon giving our Words in a solemn manner that we would not go from him and that we would return peaceably on Board again This was such an Evidence of his Confidence in us that it overcome my Husband who in a meer Principle of Gratitude told him as he could not be in any Capacity to make a sutiable return for such a Favour so he could not think of accepting of it nor could he be easy that the Captain should run such a Risque After some mutual Civilities I gave my Husband a Purse in which was Guineas and he puts it into the Captain's hand There Captain  says he  there's part of a Pledge for our Fidelity if we deal dishonestly with you on any Account 'tis your own and on this we went on Shore  INDEED the Captain had assurance enough of our Resolutions to go for that having made such  Provision to Settle there it did not seem Rational that we would chose to remain here at the Expence and Peril of Life for such it must have been if we had been taken again In a Word we went all on Shore with the Captain and Supp'd together in  Gravesend  where we were very Merry staid all Night lay at the House where we Supp'd and came all very honestly on Board again with him in the Morning Here we bought ten dozen Bottles of good Beer some Wine some Fowls and such things as we thought might be acceptable on Board  MY Governess was with us all this while and went with us Round into the Downs as did also the Captain's Wife with whom she went back I was never so sorrowful at parting with my own Mother as I was at parting with her and I never saw her more We had a fair Easterly Wind sprung up the third Day after we came to the  Downs  and we sail'd from thence the th of  April  nor did we touch any more at any Place till being driven on the Coast of  Ireland  by a very hard Gale of Wind the Ship came to an Anchor in a little  Bay  near the Mouth of a River whose Name I remember not but they said the River came down from  Limerick  and that it was the largest River in  Ireland    HERE being detain'd by bad Weather for some time the Captain who continu'd the same kind good humour'd Man as at first took us two on Shore with him again He did it now in kindness to my Husband indeed who bore the Sea very ill and was very Sick especially when it blew so hard Here we bought in again store of fresh Provisions especially Beef Pork Mutton and Fowls and the Captain stay'd to Pickle up five or six Barrels  of Beef to lengthen out the Ships Store We were here not above five Days when the Weather turning mild and a fair Wind we set Sail again and in two and Forty Days came safe to the Coast of  Virginia    WHEN we drew near to the Shore the Captain call'd me to him and told me that he found by my Discourse I had some Relations in the Place and that I had been there before and so he' suppos'd I understood the Custom in their disposing the convict Prisoners when they arriv'd I told him I did not and that as to what Relations I had in the Place he might be sure I would make my self known to none of them while I was in the Circumstances of a Prisoner and that as to the rest we left ourselves entirely to him to Assist us as he was pleas'd to promise us he wou'd do He told me I must get some Body in the Place to come and buy us as Servants and who must answer for us to the Governor of the Country if he demanded us I told him we should do as he should direct so he brought a Planter to treat with him as it were for the Purchase of these two Servants my Husband and me and there we were formally sold to him and went a Shore with him The Captain went with us and carried us to a certain House whether it was to be call'd a Tavern or not I know not but we had a Bowl of Punch there made of Rum  c  and were very Merry After some time the Planter gave us a Certificate of Discharge and an Acknowledgement of having serv'd him faithfully and we were free from him the next Morning to go whether we would  FOR this Peice of Service the Captain demanded of us weight of Tobacco which he said  he was Accountable for to his Freighter and which we immediately bought for him and made him a present of Guineas besides with which he was abundantly satisfy'd  IT is not proper to Enter here into the particulars of what Part of the Colony of  Virginia  we Settled in for divers Reasons it may suffice to mention that we went into the great River of  Potomack  the Ship being bound thither and there we intended to have Settled at first tho' afterwards we altered our Minds  THE first thing I did of Moment after having gotten all our Goods on Shore and plac'd them in a Storehouse or Warehouse which with a Lodging we hir'd at the small Place or Village where we Landed I say the first thing was to enquire after my Mother and after my Brother that fatal Person who I married as a Husband as I have related at large a little enquiry furnish'd me with Information that Mrs that is my Mother was Dead that my Brother or Husband was alive which I confess I was not very glad to hear but which was worse I found he was remov'd from the Plantation where he liv'd formerly and where I liv'd with him and liv'd with one of his Sons in a Plantation just by the Place where we Landed and where we had hir'd a Warehouse  I WAS a little surpriz'd at first but as I ventured to satisfy my self that he could not know me I was not only perfectly easy but had a great mind to see him if it was possible to do so without his seeing me in order to that I found out by enquiry a Plantation where he liv'd and with a Woman of that Place who I got to help me like what we call a  Chairwoman  I rambl'd about towards the Place as if I had only a mind to see the Country and look about me at last I came  so near that I saw the Dwellinghouse  I ask'd the Woman  whose Plantation that was  she said  it belong'd to such a Man and looking out a little to our right Hands there says she is the Gentleman that owns the Plantation and his Father with him What are their Christian Names said I I know not  said she  what the old Gentlemans Name is but his Sons Name is  Humphry  and I believe  says she  the Fathers is so too you may guess if you can what a confus'd mixture of Joy and Fright possest my Thoughts upon this Occasion for I immediately knew that this was no Body else but my own Son by that Father she shewed me who was my own Brother I had no Mask but I ruffled my Hoods so about my Face that I depended upon it that after above Years absence and withal not expecting any thing of me in that part of the World he would not be able to know any thing of me but I need not have us'd all that Caution for the old Gentleman was grown dim Sighted by some Distemper which had fallen upon his Eyes and could but just see well enough to walk about and not run against a Tree▪ or into a Ditch The Woman that was with me had told me that by a meer Accident knowing nothing of what importance it was to me As they drew near to us  I said  does he know you Mrs  Owen  so they call'd the Woman yes  said she  if he hears me speak he will know me but he can't see well enough to know me or any Body else and so she told me the Story of his Sight as I have related This made me secure and so I threw open my Hoods again and let them pass by me It was a wretched thing for a Mother thus to see her own Son a handsome comely young Gentleman in flourishing Circumstances and durst not make herself known to him and durst not take any notice  of him let any Mother of Children that reads this consider it and but think with what anguish of Mind I restrain'd myself what yearnings of Soul I had in me to embrace him and weep over him and how I thought all my Entrails turn'd within me that my very Bowels mov'd and I knew not what to do as I now know not how to express those Agonies When he went from me I stood gazing and trembling and looking after him as long as I could see him then sitting down on the Grass just at a Place I had mark'd I made as if I lay down to rest me but turn'd from her and lying on my Face wept and kiss'd the Ground that he had set his Foot on  I COU'D not conceal my Disorder so much from the Woman but that she perceiv'd it and thought I was not well which I was oblig'd to pretend was true upon which she press'd me to rise the Ground being damp and dangerous which I did accordingly and walk'd away  AS I was going back again and still Talking of this Gentleman and his Son a new Occasion of melancholy offer'd itself  thus  The Woman began as if she would tell me a Story to divert me there goes  says she  a very odd Tale among the Neighbours where this Gentleman formerly liv'd What was that  said I  why says she that old Gentleman going to  England  when he was a young Man fell in Love with a young Lady there one of the finest Women that ever was seen and Married her and brought her over hither to his Mother who was then living He liv'd here several Years with her  continu'd she  and had several Children by her of which the young Gentleman that was with him now was one but after some time the old Gentlewoman his Mother  talking to her of something relating to herself when she was in  England  and of her Circumstances in  England  which were bad enough the DaughterinLaw began to be very much surpriz'd and uneasy and in short examining further into things it appear'd past all Contradiction that she the old Gentlewoman was her own Mother and that consequently that Son was his Wives own Brother which struck the whole Family with Horror and put them into such Confusion that it had almost ruin'd them all the young Woman would not live with him the Son her Brother and Husband for a time went Distracted and at last the young Woman went away for  England  and has never been heard of since  IT is easy to believe that I was strangely affected with this Story but 'tis impossible to describe the Nature of my Disturbance I seem'd astonish'd at the Story and ask'd her a Thousand Questions about the particulars which I found she was thoroughly acquainted with at last I began to enquire into the Circumstances of the Family how the old Gentlewoman  I mean my Mother  died and how she left what she had for my Mother had promis'd me very solemnly that when she died she would do something for me and leave it so as that if I was Living I should one way or other come at it without its being in the Power of her Son  my Brother and Husband  to prevent it She told me she did not know exactly how it was order'd but she had been told that  my Mother  had left a Sum of Money and had tyed her Plantation for the Payment of it to be made good to the Daughter if ever she could be heard of either in  England  or else where and that the  Trust was left with this Son who was the Person that we saw with his Father  THIS was News too good for me to make light of and you may be sure fill'd my Heart with a Thousand Thoughts what Course I should take how and when and in what manner I should make myself known or whether I should ever make myself known or no  HERE was a Perplexity that I had not indeed skill to manage myself in neither knew I what Course to take It lay heavy upon my mind Night and Day I could neither Sleep or Converse so that my Husband perceiv'd it and wonder'd what ail'd me strove to divert me but it was all to no purpose he press'd me to tell him what it was troubled me but I put it off till at at last importuning me continually I was forc'd to form a Story which yet had a plain Truth to lay it upon too I told him I was troubled because I found we must shift our Quarters and alter our Scheme of Settling for that I found I should be known if I stay'd in that part of the Country for that my Mother being dead several of my Relations were come into that Part where we then was and that I must either discover myself to them which in our present Circumstances was not proper on many Accounts or remove and which to do I knew not and that this it was that made me so Melancholly and so Thoughtful  HE joyn'd with me in this that it was by no means proper for me to make myself known to any Body in the Circumstances in which we then were and therefore he told me he would be willing to remove to any other part of the Country or even to any other Country if I thought  fit but now I had another Difficulty which was that if I remov'd to any other Colony I put myself out of the way of ever making a due Search after those Effects which my Mother had left Again I could never so much as think of breaking the Secret of my former Marriage to my new Husband It was not a Story as I thought that would bear telling nor could I tell what might be the Consequences of it and it was impossible to search into the bottom of the thing without making it Publick all over the Country as well who I was as what I now was also  IN this perplexity I continu'd a great while and this made my Spouse very uneasy for he found me perplex'd and yet thought I was not open with him and did not let him into every part of my Grievance and he would often say he wondred what he had done that I would not Trust him with what ever it was especially if it was Grievous and Afflicting the Truth is he ought to have been trusted with every thing for no Man in the World could deserve better of a Wife but this was a thing I knew not how to open to him and yet having no Body to disclose any part of it to the Burthen was too heavy for my mind for let them say what they please of our Sex not being able to keep a Secret my Life is a plain Conviction to me of the contrary but be it our Sex or the Man's Sex a Secret of Moment should always have a Confident a bosom Friend to whom we may Communicate the Joy of it or the Grief of it be it which it will or it will be a double weight upon the Spirits and perhaps become even insupportable in itself and this I appeal to all human Testimony for the Truth of  AND this is the Cause why many times Men as well as Women and Men of the greatest and best Qualities other ways yet have found themselves weak in this part and have not been able to bear the weight of a secret Joy or of a secret sorrow but have been oblig'd to disclose it even for the meer giving vent to themselves and to unbend the Mind opprest with the Load and Weights which attended it nor was this any Token of Folly or Thoughtlessness at all but a natural Consequence of the thing and such People had they struggl'd longer with the Oppression would certainly have told it in their Sleep and disclos'd the Secret let it have been of what fatal Nature soever without regard to the Person to whom it might be expos'd This Necessity of Nature is a thing which Works sometimes with such vehemence in the Minds of those who are guilty of any atrocious Villany such as secret Murther in particular that they have been oblig'd to Discover it tho' the Consequence would necessarily be their own Destruction Now tho' it may be true that the divine Justice ought to have the Glory of all those Discoveries and Confessions yet 'tis as certain that Providence which ordinarily Works by the Hands of Nature makes use here of the same natural Causes to produce those extraordinary Effects  I COULD give several remarkable Instances of this in my long Conversation with Crime and with Criminals I knew one Fellow that while I was a Prisoner in  Newgate  was one of those they called then  NightFlyers  I know not what other Word they may have understood it by since but he was one who by Connivance was admitted to go Abroad every Evening when he play'd his  Pranks and furnish'd those honest People they call ThiefCatchers with business to find out next Day and restore  for a Reward  what they had stolen the Evening before This Fellow was as sure to tell in his sleep all that he had done and every Step he had taken what he had stole and where as sure as if he had engag'd to tell it waking and that there was no Harm or Danger in it and therefore he was oblig'd after he had been out to lock himself up or be lock'd up by some of the Keepers that had him in Fee that no Body should hear him but on the other Hand if he had told all the particulars and given a full account of his Rambles and Success to any Comrade any Brother Thief or to his Employers  as I may justly call them  then all was well with him and he slept as quietly as other People  AS the publishing this Account of my Life is for the sake of the just Moral of every part of it and for Instruction Caution Warning and Improvement to every Reader so this will not pass I hope for an unnecessary Digression concerning some People being oblig'd to disclose the greatest Secrets either of their own or other Peoples Affairs  UNDER the certain Oppression of this weight upon my Mind I labour'd in the Case I have been Naming and the only relief I found for it was to let my Husband into so much of it as I thought would convince him of the Necessity there was for us to think of Settling in some other Part of the World and the next Consideration before us was which part of the  English  settlements we should go to my Husband was a perfect Stranger to the Country and had not yet so much as a Geographical knowledge of the Situtation of the several  Places and I that till I wrote this did not know what the word Geographical signify'd had only a general Knowledge from long Conversation with People that came from or went to several Places but this I knew that  Maryland Pensilvania  East and West  Jersy New York  and  NewEngland  lay all North of  Virginia  and that they were consequently all colder Climates to which for that very Reason I had an Aversion for that as I naturally lov'd warm Weather so now I grew into Years I had a stronger Inclination to shun a cold Climate I therefore consider'd of going to  Carolina  which is the only Sourthern Colony of the  English  on the Continent of  America  and hither I propos'd to go and the rather because I might with great ease come from thence at any time when it might be proper to enquire after my Mothers effects and to make myself known enough to demand them  WITH this Resolution I propos'd to my Husband our going away from where we was and carrying all our Effects with us to  Carolina  where we resolv'd to Settle for my Husband readily agreed to the first Part  viz  that it was not at all proper to stay where we was since I had assur'd him we should be known there and the rest I effectually conceal'd from him  BUT now I found a new Difficulty upon me The main Affair grew heavy upon my Mind still and I could not think of going out of the Country without  some how or other  making enquiry into the grand Affair of what my Mother had done for me nor cou'd I with any patience bear the thought of going away and not make myself known to my old Husband  Brother  or to my Child his Son only I would fain have had this done  without my new Husband having any knowledge of it or they having any knowledge of him or that I had such a thing as a Husband  I CAST about innumerable ways in my Thoughts how this might be done I would gladly have sent my Husband away to  Carolina  with all our Goods and have come after myself but this was impracticable he would never stir without me being himself perfectly unacquainted with the Country and with the Methods of settling there or any where else Then I thought we would both go first with part of our Goods and that when we were Settled I should come back to  Virginia  and fetch the remainder but even then I knew he would never part with me and be left there to go on alone the Case was plain he was bred a Gentleman and by Consequence was not only unacquainted but indolent and when we did Settle would much rather go out into the Woods with his Gun which they call there Hunting and which is the ordinary Work of the  Indians  and which they do as Servants I say he would much rather do that than attend the natural Business of his Plantation  THESE were therefore difficulties unsurmountable and such as I knew not what to do in I had such strong impressions on my Mind about discovering myself to my  Brother  formerly my  Husband  that I could not withstand them and the rather because it run constantly in my Thoughts that if I did not do it while he liv'd I might in vain endeavour to convince my Son afterward that I was really the same Person and that I was his Mother and so might both lose the assistance and comfort of the Relation and the benefit of whatever it was my Mother had left me and yet on the  other Hand I cou'd never think it proper to discover myself to them in the Circumstances I was in as well relating to the having a Husband with me as to my being brought over by a legal Transportation as a Criminal on both which Accounts it was absolutely necessary to me to remove from the Place where I was and come again to him as from another Place and in another Figure  UPON those Considerations I went on with telling my Husband the absolute necessity there was of our not Settling in  Potwmack  River at least that we should be presently made publick there whereas if we went to any other Place in the World we should come in with as much Reputation as any Family that came to Plant That as it was always agreeable to the Inhabitants to have Families come among them to Plant who brought Substance with them either to purchase Plantations or begin New ones so we should be sure of a kind agreeable Reception and that without any possibility of a Discovery of our Circumstances  I TOLD him in general too that as I had several Relations in the Place where we was and that I durst not now let myself be known to them because they would soon come into a knowledge of the Occasion and Reason of my coming over which would be to expose myself to the last degree so I had Reason to believe that my Mother who died here had left me something and perhaps considerable which it might be very well worth my while to enquire after but that this too could not be done without exposing us publickly unless we went from hence and then where ever we Settled I might come as it were to visit and to see my Brother and Nephews make myself known to them claim and enquire after what was my Due be receiv'd with Respect  and at the same time have justice done me with chearfulness and good will whereas if I did it now I could expect nothing but with trouble such as exacting it by force receiving it with Curses and Reluctance and with all kinds of Affronts which he would not perhaps bear to see that in Case of being oblig'd to legal Proofs of being really her Daughter I might be at loss be oblig'd to have recourse to  England  and it may be to fail at last and so lose it whatever it might be With these Arguments and having thus acquainted my Husband with the whole Secret so far as was needful to him we resolv'd to go and seek a Settlement in some other Colony and at first Thoughts  Carolina  was the Place we pitch'd upon  IN order to this we began to make enquiry for Vessels going to  Carolina  and in a very little while got information that on the other side the  Bay as they call it  namely in  Maryland  there was a Ship which came from  Carolina  loaden with Rice and other Goods and was going back again thither and from thence to  Jamaica  with Provisions On this News we hir'd a Sloop to take in our Goods and taking as it were a final farewel of  Potowmack  River we went with all our Cargo over to  Maryland    THIS was a long and unpleasant Voyage and my Spouse said it was worse to him than all the Voyage from  England  because the Weather was but indifferent the Water rough and the Vessel small and inconvenient in the next Place we were full a hundred Miles up  Potowmack  River in a part which they call  Westmorland  Country and as that River is by far the greatest in  Virginia  and I have heard say it is the greatest River in  the World that falls into another River and not directly into the Sea so we had base Weather in it and were frequently in great Danger for tho' they call it but a River 'tis frequently so broad that when we were in the middle we could not see Land on either Side for many Leagues together Then we had the great River or Bay of  Chesapeake  to cross which is where the River  Potowmack  falls into it near thirty Miles broad and we entered more great vast Waters whose Names I know not so that our Voyage was full two hundred Mile in a poor sorry Sloop with all our Treasure and if any Accident had happened to us we might at last have been very miserable supposing we had lost our Goods and saved our Lives only and had then been left naked and destitute and in a wild strange Place not having one Friend or Acquaintance in all that part of the World The very thoughts of it gives me some horror even since the Danger is past  WELL we came to the Place in five Days sailing I think they call it  Philips  's  Point  and behold when we came thither the Ship bound to  Carolina  was loaded and gone away but three Days before This was a Disappointment but however I that was to be discourag'd with nothing told my Husband that since we could not get Passage to  Carolina  and that the Country we was in was very fertile and good we would if he lik'd of it see if we could find out any thing for our Turn where we was and that if he lik'd things we would Settle here  WE immediately went on Shore but found no Conveniences just at that Place either for our being on Shore or preserving our Goods on Shore but was directed by a very honest Quaker who we  found there to go to a Place about sixty Miles East that is to say nearer the Mouth of the  Bay  where he said he liv'd and where we should be Accommodated either to Plant or to wait for any other Place to Plant in that might be more Convenient and he invited us with so much kindness and simple Honesty that we agreed to go and the Quaker himself went with us  HERE we bought us two Servants  viz  an  English  WomanServant just come on Shore from a Ship of  Leverpool  and a  Negro  ManServant things absolutely necessary for all People that pretended to Settle in that Country This honest Quaker was very helpful to us and when we came to the Place that he propos'd to us found us out a convenient Storehouse for our Goods and Lodging for ourselves and our Servants and about two Months or thereabout afterwards by his Direction we took up a large peice of Land from the Governor of that Country in order to form our Plantation and so we laid the thoughts of going to  Carolina  wholly aside having been very well receiv'd here and Accommodated with a convenient Lodging till we could prepare things and have Land enough cur'd and Timber and Materials provid'd for building us a House all which we manag'd by the Direction of the Quaker so that in one Years time we had near fifty Acres of Land clear'd part of it enclos'd and some of it Planted with Tobacco tho' not much besides we had Garden ground and Corn sufficient to help supply our Servants with Roots and Herbs and Bread  AND now I perswaded my Husband to let me go over the  Bay  again and enquire after my Friends he was the willinger to consent to it  now because he had business upon his Hands sufficient to employ him besides his Gun to divert him which they call Hunting there and which he greatly delighted in and indeed we us'd to look at one another sometimes with a great deal of Pleasure reflecting how much better that was not than  Newgate  only but than the most prosperous of our Circumstances in the wicked Trade that we had been both carrying on  OUR Affair was in a very good posture we purchased of the Proprietors of the Colony as much Land for Pound paid in ready Money as would make a sufficient Plantation to employ between fifty and sixty Servants and which being well improv'd would be sufficient to us as long as we could either of us live and as for Children I was past the prospect of any thing of that kind  BUT our good Fortune did not End here I went  as I have said  over the  Bay  to the Place where my Brother once a Husband liv'd but I did not go to the same Village where I was before but went up another great River on the East side of the River  Potowmack  call'd  Rapahannock  River and by this means came on the back of his Plantation which was large and by the help of a Navigable Creek or little River that run into the  Rapahannock  I came very near it  I WAS now fully resolv'd to go up  Pointblank  to my Brother Husband and to tell him who I was but not knowing what Temper I might find him in or how much out of Temper rather I might make him by such a rash visit I resolv'd to write a Letter to him first to let him know who I was and that I was come not to give him any trouble upon the old Relation which I hop'd was entirely  forgot but that I apply'd to him as a Sister to a Brother desiring his Assistance in the Case of that Provision which our Mother at her decease had left for my Support and which I did not doubt but he would do me Justice in especially considering that I was come thus far to look after it  I said some very tender kind things in the Letter about his Son which I told him he knew to be my own Child and that as I was guilty of nothing in Marrying him any more than he was in Marrying me neither of us having then known our being at all related to one another so I hop'd he would allow me the most Passionate desire of once seeing my one and only Child and of showing something of the Infirmities of a Mother in preserving a violent Affection for him who had never been able to retain any thought of me one way or other  I did believe that having receiv'd this Letter he would immediately give it to his Son to Read I having understood his Eyes being so dim that he cou'd not see to read it but it fell out better than so for as his Sight was dim so he had allow'd his Son to open all Letters that came to his Hand for him and the old Gentleman being from Home or out of the way when my Messenger came my Letter came directly to my Sons Hand and he open'd and read it  HE call'd the Messenger in after some little stay and ask'd him where the Person was who gave him the Letter the Messenger told him the Place which was about seven Miles off so he bid him stay and ordering a Horse to be got ready and two Servants away he came to me with the Messenger Let any one judge the Consternation I was in when my Messenger came  back and told me the old Gentleman was not at Home but his Son was come along with him and was just coming up to me I was perfectly confounded for I knew not whether it was Peace or War nor cou'd I tell how to behave However I had but a very few Moments to think for my Son was at the Heels of the Messenger and coming up into my Lodgings ask'd the Fellow at the Door something I suppose it was  for I did not hear it so as to understand it  which was the Gentlewoman that sent him for the Messenger said  there she is Sir  at which he comes directly up to me kisses me took me in his Arms and embrac'd me with so much Passion that he could not speak but I could feel his Breast heave and throb like a Child that Cries but Sobs and cannot cry it out  I CAN neither express or describe the Joy that touch'd my very Soul when I found  for it was easy to discover that Part  that he came not as a Stranger but as a Son to a Mother and indeed as a Son who had never before known what a Mother of his own was in short we cryed over one another a considerable while when at last he broke out first MY DEAR MOTHER says he  are you still alive I never expected to have seen your Face  as for me I cou'd say nothing a great while  AFTER we had both recover'd ourselves a little and were able to talk he told me how things stood as to what I had written to his Father he told me he had not shewed my Letter to his Father or told him any thing about it that what his Grandmother left me was in his Hands and that he would do me Justice to my full Satisfaction that as to his Father he was old and infirm both in Body and Mind that he was very Fretful and Passionate almost Blind and capable of nothing and he question'd whether he would know how to act  in an Affair which was of so nice a Nature as this and that therefore he had come himself as well to satisfy himself in seeing me which he could not restrain himself from as also to put it into my Power to make a Judgement after I had seen how things were whether I would discover myself to his Father or no  THIS was really so prudently and wisely manag'd that I found my Son was a Man of Sense and needed no Direction from me I told him I did not wonder that his Father was as he had describ'd him for that his Head was a little touch'd before I went away and principally his Disturbance was because I could not be perswaded to conceal our Relation and to live with him as my Husband after I knew that he was my Brother That as he knew better than I what his Fathers present Condition was I should readily joyn with him in such Measures as he would direct That I was indifferent as to seeing his Father since I had seen him first and he cou'd not have told me better News than to tell me that what his Grandmother had left me was entrusted in his Hands who I doubted not now he knew who I was would  as he said  do me Justice I enquir'd then how long my Mother had been dead and where she died and told so many particulars of the Family that I left him no room to doubt the Truth of my being really and truly his Mother  MY Son then enquir'd where I was and how I had dispos'd myself I told him I was on the  Maryland  side of the  Bay  at the Plantation of a particular Friend who came from  England  in the same Ship with me that as for that side of the  Bay  where he was I had no Habitation he told me I should go Home with him and live with  him if I pleas'd as long as I liv'd That as to his Father he knew no Body and would never so much as guess at me I consider'd of that a little and told him that tho' it was really no concern to me to live at a distance from him yet I could not say it would be the comfortabless thing in the World to me to live in the House with him and to have that unhappy Object always before me which had been such a blow to my Peace before that tho' I should be glad to have his Company my Son or to be as near him as possible while I stay'd yet I could not think of being in the House where I should be also under constant Restraint for fear of betraying myself in my Discourse nor should I be able to refrain some Expressions in my Conversing with him as my Son that might discover the whole Affair which would by no means be Convenient  HE acknowledged that I was right in all this but then DEAR MOTHER says he  you shall be as near me as you can  so he took me with him on Horseback to a Plantation next to his own and where I was as well entertain'd as I cou'd have been in his own having left me there he went away home telling me we would talk of the main Business the next Day and having first called me his Aunt and given a Charge to the People who it seems were his Tenants to treat me with all possible Respect about two Hours after he was gone he sent me a MaidServant and a  Negro  Boy to wait on me and Provisions ready dress'd for my Supper and thus I was as if I had been in a new World and began secretly now to wish that I had not brought my  Lancashire  Husband from  England  at all  HOWEVER that wish was not hearty neither for I lov'd my  Lancashire  Husband entirely as indeed I had ever done from the beginning and he merited from me as much as it was possible for a Man to do but that by the way  THE next Morning my Son came to visit me again almost as soon as I was up after a little Discourse he first of all pull'd out a Deer skin Bag and gave it me with five and fifty  Spanish  Pistoles in it and told me that was to supply my Expences from  England  for tho' it was not his Business to enquire yet he ought to think I did not bring a great deal Money out with me it not being usual to bring much Money into that Country Then he pull'd out his Grandmother's Will and read it over to me whereby it appear'd that she had left a small Plantation  as he call'd it  on  York  River that is where my Mother liv'd to me with the Stock of Servants and Cattle upon it and given it in Trust to this Son of mine for my Use when ever he should hear of my being alive and to my Heirs if I had any Children and in default of Heirs to whomsoever I should by Will dispose of it but gave the Income of it till I should be heard of or found to my said Son and if I should not be living then it was to him and his Heirs  THIS Plantation tho' remote from him he said he did not let out but manag'd it by a head Clerk Steward as he did another that was his Fathers that lay hard by it and went over himself three or four times a Year to look after it I ask'd him what he thought the Plantation might be worth  he said  if I would let it out he would give me about sixty Pounds a Year for it but if I would live on it then it would be worth much more and he  believ'd would bring me in about  l  a Year but seeing I was likely either to Settle on the other side the  Bay  or might perhaps have a mind to go back to  England  again if I would let him be my Steward he would manage it for me as he had done for himself and that he believ'd he should be able to send me as much Tobacco to  England  from it as would yeild me about  l  a Year sometimes more  THIS was all strange News to me and things I had not been us'd to and really my Heart began to look up more seriously than I think it ever did before and to look with great Thankfulness to the Hand of Providence which had done such wonders for me who had been myself the greatest wonder of Wickedness perhaps that had been suffered to live in the World and I must again observe that not on this Occasion only but even on all other Occasions of Thankfulness my past wicked and abominable Life never look'd so Monstruous to me and I never so compleatly abhorr'd it and reproach'd myself with it as when I had a Sense upon me of Providence doing good to me while I had been making those vile Returns on my part  BUT I leave the Reader to improve these Thoughts as no doubt they will see Cause and I go on to the Fact my Sons tender Carriage and kind Offers fetch'd Tears from me almost all the while he talk'd with me indeed I could scarce Discourse with him but in the intervals of my Passion however at length I began and expressing myself with wonder at my being so happy to have the Trust of what I had left put into the Hands of my own Child I told him that as to the Inheritance of it I had no Child but him in  the World and was now past having any if I should Marry and therefore would desire him to get a Writing Drawn which I was ready to execute by which I would after me give it wholly to him and to his Heirs and in the mean time smiling I ask'd him what made him continue a Batchelor so long his answer was kind and ready that  Virginia  did not yield any great plenty of Wives and that since I talk'd of going back to  England  I should send him a Wife from  London    THIS was the Substance of our first days Conversation the pleasantest Day that ever past over my Head in my Life and which gave me the truest Satisfaction He came every Day after this and spent great part of his time with me and carried me about to several of his Friends Houses where I was entertain'd with great Respect also I Dined several times at his own House when he took care always to see his half dead Father so out of the way that I never saw him or he me I made him one Present and it was all I had of value and that was one of the gold Watches of which I mention'd above that I had two in my Chest and this I happen'd to have with me and I gave it him at his third Visit I told him I had nothing of any value to bestow but that and I desir'd he would now and then kiss it for my sake  I did not indeed tell him  that I had stole it from a Gentlewomans side at a MeetingHouse in  London  that's by the way  HE stood a little while Hesitating as if doubtful whether to take it or no but I press'd it on him and made him accept it and it was not much less worth than his Leatherpouch full of  Spanish  Gold no tho' it were to be reckon'd as if at  London  whereas it was worth twice as much there where I gave it him at length he took it kiss'd it told me the Watch should be a Debt upon him that he would be paying as long as I liv'd  A FEW Days after he brought the Writings of Gift and the Scrivener with them and I sign'd them very freely and deliver'd them to him with a hundr'd Kisses for sure nothing ever pass'd between a Mother and a tender dutiful Child with more Affection The next Day he brings me an Obligation under his Hand and Seal whereby he engag'd himself to Manage and Improve the Plantation for my account and with his utmost Skill and to remit the Produce to my order whereever I should be and withal to be oblig'd himself to make up the Produce a hundred Pound a Year to me When he had done so he told me that as I came to demand it before the Crop was off I had a right to the Produce of the current Year and so he paid me an hundred Pound in  Spanish  Peices of Eight and desir'd me to give him a Receipt for it as in full for that Year ending at  Christmas  following this being about the latter End of  August    I STAY'D here above five Weeks and indeed had much a do to get away then Nay he would have came over the  Bay  with me but I would by no means allow him to it however he would send me over in a Sloop of his own which was built like a Yatch and serv'd him as well for Pleasure as Business This I accepted of and so after the utmost Expressions both of Duty and Affection he let me come away and I arriv'd safe in two Days at my Friends the Quakers  I BROUGHT over with me for the use of our Plantation three Horses with Harness and Saddles some Hogs two Cows and a thousand other things the Gift of the kindest and tenderest Child that ever Woman had I related to my Husband all the particulars of this Voyage except that I called my Son my Cousin and first I told him that I had lost my Watch which he seem'd to take as a Misfortune but then I told him how kind my Cousin had been that my Mother had left me such a Plantation and that he had preserv'd it for me in hopes some time or other he should hear from me then I told that I had left it to his Management that he would render me a faithful Account of its Produce and then I pull'd him out the hundred Pound in Silver as the first Years produce and then pulling out the Deer skin Purse with the Pistoles and here my Dear  says I  is the gold Watch My Husband  so is Heavens goodness sure to work the same Effects in all sensible Minds where Mercies touch the Heart  lifted up both his Hands and with an extasy of Joy  What is God a doing  says he  for such an ungrateful Dog as I am  Then I let him know what I had brought over in the Sloop besides all this I mean the Horses Hogs and Cows and other Stores for our Plantation all which added to his surprize and fill'd his Heart with thankfulness and from this time forward I believe he was as sincere a Penitent and as thoroughly a reform'd Man as ever God's goodness brought back from a Profligate a HighwayMan and a Robber I could sill a larger History than this with the Evidences of this Truth and but that I doubt that part of the Story will not be equally diverting  as the wicked Part I have had thoughts of making a Volume of it by itself  AS for myself as this is to be my own Story not my Husbands I return to that Part which relates to myself we went on with our Plantation and manag'd it with the help and diversion of such Friends as we got there by our obliging Behaviour and especially the honest Quaker who prov'd a faithful generous and steady Friend to us and we had very good Success for having a flourishing Stock to begin with as  I have said  and this being now encreas'd by the Addition of a Hundred and fifty Pound  Sterling  in Money we enlarg'd our Number of Servants built us a very good House and cur'd every Year a great deal of Land The second Year I wrote to my old Governess giving her part with us of the Joy of our Success and order'd her how to lay out the Money I had left with her which was  l  as above and to send it to us in Goods which she perform'd with her usual Kindness and Fidelity and all this arriv'd safe to us  HERE we had a supply of all sorts of Cloaths as well for my Husband as for myself and I took especial care to buy for him all those things that I knew he delighted to have as two good long Wigs two silver hilted Swords three or four fine Fowling peices a fine Saddle with Holsters and Pistoles very handsome with a Scarlet Cloak and in a Word every thing I could think o  to oblige him and to make him appear as he really was a very fine Gentleman I order'd a good Quantity of such Houseshouldstuff as we yet wanted with Linnen of all sorts for us both as for my self I wanted very little of Cloths or Linnen being very well furnished before  The rest of my Cargo consisted in IronWork of all sorts Harness for Horses Tools Cloaths for Servants and WollenCloth stuffs Serges Stockings Shoes Hats and the like such as Servants wear and to whole peices also make up for Servants all by direction of the Quaker and all this Cargo arriv'd safe and in good Condition with three Women Servants lusty Wenches which my old Governess had pick'd up for me suitable enough to the Place and to the Work we had for them to do one of which happen'd to come double having been got with Child by one of the Seamen in the Ship as she own'd afterwards before the Ship got so far as  Gravesend  so she brought us a stout Boy about Months after her Landing  MY Husband you may suppose was a little surpriz'd at the arriving of all this Cargo from  England  and talking with me after he saw the Account of the particular my Dear  says he  what is the meaning of all this I fear you will  us too deep in Debt When shall we be able to make Return for it all I smil'd and told  that it was all paid for and then I told him that not knowing what might befal us in the Voyage and considering what our Circumstances might expose us to I had not taken my whole Stock with me that I had reserv'd so much in my Friends Hands which now we were come ove  safe and was Settled in a way to live I had sen  for as he might see  HE was amaz'd and stood a while telling upon his Fingers but said nothing at last he began thus Hold lets see  says he telling upon his Fingers still  and first on his Thumb there's  l  in Money at first then two gold Watches Diamond Rings and Plate  says he  upon the fore Finger then upon  the next Finger here's a Plantation on  York  River a  l  a Year then in Money then a Sloop load of Horses Cows Hogs and Stores and so on to the Thumb again and now  says he  a Cargo cost  l  in  England  and worth here twice the Money well  says I  What do you make of all that make of it  says he  why who says I was deceiv'd when I married a Wife in  Lancashire  I think I have married a Fortune and a very good Fortune too  says he    IN a Word we were now in very considerable Circumstances and every Year encreasing for our new Plantation grew upon our Hands insensibly and in eight Year which we lived upon it we brought it to such a pitch that the Produce was at least  l  Sterling a Year I mean worth so much in  England    AFTER I had been a Year at Home again I went over the Bay to see my Son and to receive another Year's Income of my Plantation and I was surpiz'd to hear just at my Landing there that my old Husband was dead and had not been bury'd above a Fortnight This I confess was not disagreeable News because now I could appear as I was in a marry'd Condition so I told my Son before I came from him that I believed I should marry a Gentleman who had a Plantation near mine and tho' I was legally free to marry as to any Obligation that was on me before yet that I was shye of it least the Blot should some time or other be reviv'd and it might make a Husband uneasy my Son the same kind dutiful and obliging Creature as ever treated me now at  his own House paid me my hundred Pound and sent me Home again loaded with Presents  SOME time after this I let my Son know I was marry'd and invited him over to see us and my Husband wrote a very obliging Letter to him also inviting him to come and see him and he came accordingly some Months after and happen'd to be there just when my Cargo from  England  came in which I let him believe belong'd all to my Husband's Estate not to me  IT must be observ'd that when the old Wretch my Brother Husband was dead I then freely gave my Husband an Account of all that Affair and of this Cousin as I had call'd him before being my own Son by that mistaken unhappy Match He was perfectly easy in the Account and told me he should have been as easy if the old Man as we call'd him had been alive for  said he  it was no Fault of yours nor of his it was a Mistake impossible to be prevented he only reproach'd him with desiring me to conceal it and to live with him as a Wife after I knew that he was my Brother that he said was a vile part Thus all these little Difficulties were made easy and we liv'd together with the greatest Kindness and Comfort imaginable we are now grown Old I am come back to  England  being almost seventy Years of Age my Husband sixty eight having perform'd much more than the limited Terms of my Transportation And now notwithstanding all the Fatigues and all the Miseries we have both gone thro' we are both of in good Heart and Health my Husband remain there sometime after  me to settle our Affairs and at first I had intended to go back to him but at his desire I alter'd that Resolution and he is come over to  England  also where we resolve to spend the Remainder of our Years in sincere Penitence for the wicked Lives we have lived  Written in the Year  FINIS
