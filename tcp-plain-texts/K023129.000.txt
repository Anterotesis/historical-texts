 THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF HORACE IMITATED  Ne Rubeam pingui donatus Munere  HOR  LONDON  Printed for T COOPER at the  Globe  in  PaternosterRow  MDCCXXXVII  Price One Shilling    ADVERTISEMENT  _THE Reflections of  Horace  and the Judgments past in this Epistle to  Augustus  seem'd so seasonable to the present Times that I could not help applying them to the use of my own Country The Author thought them considerable enough to address them to His Prince whom he paints with all the great and good Qualities of a Monarch upon whom the  Romans  depended for the Encrease of an  Absolute Empire  But to make the Poem entirely English I was willing to add one or two such as contribute to the Happiness of a  Free People  and are more consistent with the Welfare of  our Neighbours  This Epistle will show the learned World to have fallen into two mistakes one that  Augustus was a Patron of Poets in general  whereas he not only prohibited all but the Best Writers to name him but recommended that Care even to the Civil Magistrate  Admonebat Praetores ne paterentur Nomen suum obsolefieri  c The other to imagine this Piece to be a  general Discourse of Poetry  whereas it is an  Apology for the Poets  in order to render  Augustus  more their Patron  Horace  here pleads the Cause of his Cotemporaries first against the Taste of the  Town whose humour it was to magnify the Authors of the preceding Age secondly against the Court and Nobility who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre and lastly against the Emperor himself who had conceived them of little use to the Government He shews by a view of the Progress of Learning and the Change of Taste among the  Romans  that the Introduction of the Polite Arts of  Greece  had given the Writers of his Time great advantages over their Predecessors that their  Morals  were much improved and the Licence of those ancient Poets restrained that  Satire  and  Comedy  were become more just and useful that whatever extravagancies were left on the Stage were owing to the Ill Taste of the Nobility that Poets under due Regulations were in many respects useful to the  State  and concludes that it was upon them the Emperor himself must depend for his Fame with Posterity  We may farther learn from this Epistle that  Horace  made his Court to this Great Prince by writing with a decent Freedom toward him with a just Contempt of his low Flatterers and with a manly Regard to his own Character  THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF  HORACE  Cum tot sustineas c  _WHile You great Patron of Mankind

And estimating Authors by the year  Bestow a Garland only on a Bier  Ennius    sapiens fortis c  Shakespear  Shakespear and Ben Johnson may truly be said not much to have thought of Immortal Fame the one in many pieces composed in haste for the Stage the other in his Latter works in general which  Dryden  calls his  Dotages  whom you and ev'ry Playhouse bill  Style the divine the matchless what

Gold and Lawn  The Champion too and to complete the jest  The Coronation of Henry the Eighth and Queen Anne Boleyn in which the Playhouses tried with each other to represent all the pomp of a

With laughter sure Democritus had dy'd  Had he beheld an Audience gape so wide  Let Bear or Elephant be e'er so white  The people sure the people are the sight  Ah luckless Poet stretch thy lungs and roar  That Bear or Elephant shall heed thee more  While all its throats the Gallery extends  And all the Thunder of the Pit ascends  Loud as the Wolves on  Orcas' stormy steep  The furthest Northern Promontory of Scotland opposite to the Orcades  Orcas' stormy steep  Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep  Such is the shout the longapplauding note  At Quin's high plume or Oldfield's petticoat  Or when from Court a birthday suit bestow'd  Sinks the lost Actor in the tawdry load  Booth entershark the Universal Peal  " But has he spoken" Not a syllable  " What shook the stage and made the people stare  Cato's long Wig flowr'd gown and lacquer'd chair  Ac ne forte putes me c  Yet lest you think I railly more than teach  Or praise malignly Arts I cannot reach  Let me for once presume

Pity and with Terror tear my heart  And snatch me o'er the earth or thro' the air  To Thebes to Athens when he will and where  Verum age his c  But not this part of the poetic state  Alone deserves the favour of the Great  Think of those Authors Sir who would rely  More on a Reader's sense than Gazer's eye  Or who shall wander where the Muses sing  Who climb their Mountain or who taste their spring  How shall we fill  Munus Apolline dignum  The Palatine Library then building by Augustus  a Library with Wit  When  Merlin's Cave  A Building in the Royal Gardens of Richmond where is a small but choice Collection of Books  Merlin's Cave is half unfurnish'd yet  Multa quidem nobis c  My Liege why Writers little claim your thought  I guess and with their leave will tell the fault  We Poets are upon a Poet's word  Of all mankind the creatures most absurd  The season when to come and when to go  To sing or cease to sing we never know  And if we will recite nine hours in ten  You lose your patience just like other men  Then too we hurt our selves when to defend  A single verse we quarrel with a friend  Repeat unask'd lament the Wit's too fine  For vulgar eyes and point out ev'ry line  But most when straining with too weak a wing  We needs will write Epistles to the King  And from the moment we oblige the town  Expect a Place or Pension from the Crown  Or dubb'd Historians by express command  T' enroll your triumphs o'er the seas and land  Be call'd to Court to plan some work divine  As once for LOÜIS Boileau and Racine  Sed tamen est operae pretium c  Yet think great Sir so many Virtues shown  Ah think what Poet best may make them known  Or chuse at least some Minister of Grace  Fit to bestow the Laureat's weighty place  Gratus Alexandro regi Magno c  Charles to late times to be transmitted fair  Assign'd his figure to Bernini's care  And great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed  To fix him graceful on the bounding Steed  So well in paint and stone they judg'd of merit  But Kings in Wit may want discerning spirit  The Hero William and the Martyr Charles  One knighted Blackmore and one pension'd Quarles  Which made old Ben and surly Dennis swear  " No Lord's anointed but a Russian Bear"  Nec magis expressi vultus c  Not with such Majesty such bold relief  The Forms august of King or conqu'ring Chief  E'er swell'd on Marble as in Verse have shin'd  In polish'd Verse the Manners and the Mind  Oh could I mount on the Maeonian wing  Your Arms your Actions your Repose to sing  What seas you travers'd and what fields you fought  Your Country's Peace how oft how dearly bought  How barb'rous rage subsided at your word  And Nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword  How when you nodded o'er the land and deep  Peace stole her wing and wrapt the world in sleep  Till Earth's extremes your mediation own  And Asia's Tyrants tremble at your Throne  But Verse alas your Majesty disdains  And I'm not us'd to Panegyric strains  The Zeal of Fools offends at any time  But most of all the Zeal of Fools in ryme  Besides a fate attends on all I write  That when I aim at praise they say I bite  Nil moror officium quod me gravat c  A vile Encomium doubly ridicules  There's nothing blackens like the ink of fools  If true a woful likeness and if lyes  " Praise undeserv'd is scandal in disguise"  Well may he blush who gives it or receives  And when I flatter let my dirty leaves  Like Journals Odes and such forgotten things  As Eusden Philips Settle writ of Kings  Cloath spice line trunks or flutt'ring in a row  Befringe the rails of Bedlam and Sohoe  FINIS
